Self-management is a defining characteristic of socialism, with proposals for self-management having appeared many times throughout the history of the socialist movement, advocated variously by democratic, libertarian and market socialists as well as anarchists and communists. There are many variations of self-management. In some variants, all the worker-members manage the enterprise directly through assemblies while in other forms workers exercise management functions indirectly through the election of specialist managers. Self-management may include worker supervision and oversight of an organization by elected bodies, the election of specialized managers, or self- directed management without any specialized managers as such. The goals of self-management are to improve performance by granting workers greater autonomy in their day-to-day operations, boosting morale, reducing alienation and eliminating exploitation when paired with employee ownership. An enterprise that is self-managed is referred to as a labour-managed firm. Self- management refers to control rights within a productive organization, being distinct from the questions of ownership and what economic system the organization operates under. Self-management of an organization may coincide with employee ownership of that organization, but self-management can also exist in the context of organizations under public ownership and to a limited extent within private companies in the form of co-determination and worker representation on the board of directors.  Economic theory  An economic system consisting of self-managed enterprises is sometimes referred to as a participatory economy, self-managed economy, or cooperative economy. This economic model is a major version of market socialism and decentralized planned economy, stemming from the notion that people should be able to participate in making the decisions that affect their well-being. The major proponents of self-managed market socialism in the 20th century include the economists Benjamin Ward, Jaroslav Vanek and Branko Horvat. The Ward‚ÄìVanek model of self-management involves the diffusion of entrepreneurial roles amongst all the partners of the enterprise. Branko Horvat notes that participation is not simply more desirable, but also more economically viable than traditional hierarchical and authoritarian management as demonstrated by econometric measurements which indicate an increase in efficiency with greater participation in decision-making. According to Horvat, these developments are moving the world toward a self-governing socialistic mode of organization. In the economic theory of self-management, workers are no longer employees but partners in the administration of their enterprise. Management theories in favor of greater self-management and self-directed activity cite the importance of autonomy for productivity in the firm and economists in favor of self-management argue that cooperatives are more efficient than centrally- managed firms because every worker receives a portion of the profit, thereby directly tying their productivity to their level of compensation. Historical economic figures who supported cooperatives and self-management of some kind include the anarchist Pierre Joseph Proudhon, classical economist John Stuart Mill and the neoclassical economist Alfred Marshall. Contemporary proponents of self-management include the American Marxian economist Richard D. Wolff, anarchist philosopher Noam Chomsky and social theorist and sociologist Marcelo Vieta.  Labor managed firm  The theory of the labor manager firm explains the behavior, performance and nature of self-managed organizational forms. Although self-managed (or labor-managed) firms can coincide with worker ownership (employee ownership), the two are distinct concepts and one need not imply the other. According to traditional neoclassical economic theory, in a competitive market economy ownership of capital assets by labor (the workforce of a given firm) should have no significant impact on firm performance.Paul Samuelson, Wages and Interest: A Modern Dissection of Marxian Economic Models, 47 AM.ECON.REV. 884, 894 (1957): \\"In a perfectly competitive market it really doesn‚Äôt matter who hires whom: so have labor hire ‚Äòcapital‚Äô...‚Äù) The classical liberal philosopher John Stuart Mill believed that worker-run and owned cooperatives would eventually displace traditional capitalist (capital- managed) firms in the competitive market economy due to their superior efficiency and stronger incentive structure. While both Mill and Karl Marx thought that democratic worker management would be more efficient in the long run compared with hierarchical management, Marx was not hopeful about the prospects of labor-managed and owned firms as a means to displace traditional capitalist firms in the market economy.Where Did Mill Go Wrong?: Why the Capital-Managed Firm Rather than the Labor-Managed Enterprise Is the Predominant Organizational Form in Market Economies, by Schwartz, Justin. 2011. Ohio State Law Journal, vol. 73, no. 2, 2012: \\"Why, then, is the predominant form of industrial organization in market societies the traditional capital-owned and managed firm (the capitalist firm) rather than the labor-managed enterprise owned and managed by the workers (the cooperative)? This is exactly the opposite of the result predicted by John Stuart Mill over 150 years ago. He thought that such worker-run cooperative associations would eventually crowd capitalist firms out of the market because of their superior efficiency and other advantages for workers.\\" Despite their advantages in efficiency, in Western market economies the labor-managed firm is comparatively rare.Where Did Mill Go Wrong?: Why the Capital-Managed Firm Rather than the Labor-Managed Enterprise Is the Predominant Organizational Form in Market Economies, by Schwartz, Justin. 2011. Ohio State Law Journal, vol. 73, no. 2, 2012: \\"Mill was mistaken, and Marx correct, at least about the tendency for labor-managed firms to displace capital-managed firms in the ordinary operation of the market.\\" Benjamin Ward critiqued the labor managed firm's objective function. According to Ward, the labor-managed firm strives to maximize net income for all its members as contrasted with the traditional capitalist firms' objective function of maximizing profit for external owners. The objective function of the labor managed firm creates an incentive to limit employment in order to boost the net income of the firm's existing members. Thus, an economy consisting of labor-managed firms would have a tendency to underutilize labor and tend toward high rates of unemployment.  Classical economics  In the 19th century, the idea of a self-managed economy was first fully articulated by the anarchist philosopher and economist Pierre- Joseph Proudhon. This economic model was called mutualism to highlight the mutual relationship among individuals in this system (in contrast to the parasitism of capitalist society) and involved cooperatives operating in a free-market economy. The classical liberal philosopher John Stuart Mill argued that worker-run cooperatives would eventually displace traditional capitalist (capital-managed) firms in the competitive market economy due to their superior efficiency. Karl Marx championed the idea of a free association of producers as a characteristic of communist society, where self-management processes replaced the traditional notion of the centralized state. This concept is related to the Marxist idea of transcending alienation.  Soviet- type economies  The Soviet-type economic model as practiced in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc is criticized by socialists for its lack of widespread self-management and management input on the part of workers in enterprises. However, according to both the Bolshevik view and Marx's own perspective a full transformation of the work process can only occur after technical progress has eliminated dreary and repetitive work, a state of affairs that had not yet been achieved even in the advanced Western economies.  Management science  In his book Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us, Daniel H. Pink argues on the basis of empirical evidence that self-management/self-directed processes, mastery, worker autonomy and purpose (defined as intrinsic rewards) are much more effective incentives than monetary gain (extrinsic rewards). According to Pink, for the vast majority of work in the 21st century self-management and related intrinsic incentives are far more crucial than outdated notions of hierarchical management and an overreliance on monetary compensation as reward. More recent research suggests that incentives and bonuses can have positive effects on performance and autonomous motivation. According to this research, the key is aligning bonuses and incentives to reinforce, rather than hamper, a sense of autonomy, competence and relatedness (the three needs that self determination theory identifies for autonomous motivation).  Political movements = Europe  Worker self-management became a primary component of some trade union organizations, in particular revolutionary syndicalism which was introduced in late 19th century France and guild socialism in early 20th century Britain, although both movements collapsed in the early 1920s. French trade-union CFDT (Conf√©d√©ration Fran√ßaise D√©mocratique du Travail) included worker self- management in its 1970 program before later abandoning it. The philosophy of workers' self-management has been promoted by the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) since its founding in the United States in 1905. Critics of workers' self-management from the left such as Gilles Dauv√© and Jacques Camatte do not admonish the model as reactionary, but simply as not progressive in the context of developed capitalism. Such critics suggest that capitalism is more than a relationship of management. Rather, they suggest capitalism should be considered as a social totality which workers' self- management in and of itself only perpetuates and does not challenge despite its seemingly radical content and activity. This theory is used to explain why self-management in Yugoslavia never advanced beyond the confines of the larger state-monopoly economy, or why many modern worker-owned facilities tend to return to hiring managers and accountants after only a few years of operation. Guild socialism is a political movement advocating workers' control of industry through the medium of trade-related guilds \\"in an implied contractual relationship with the public\\".\\"Guild Socialism\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 31 May. 2012 It originated in the United Kingdom and was at its most influential in the first quarter of the 20th century. It was strongly associated with G. D. H. Cole and influenced by the ideas of William Morris. One significant experiment with workers' self-management took place during the Spanish Revolution (1936‚Äì1939). In his book Anarcho-Syndicalism (1938), Rudolf Rocker stated: > But by taking the land and the industrial plants under their own management > they have taken the first and most important step on the road to Socialism. > Above all, they (the Workers' and peasants self-management) have proved that > the workers, even without the capitalists, are able to carry on production > and to do it better than a lot of profit-hungry entrepreneurs.Rocker, Rudolf > (1938). Anarcho-Syndicalism. p. 69. At the height of the Cold War in the 1950s, Yugoslavia advocated what was officially called socialist self-management in distinction from the Eastern Bloc countries, all of which practiced central planning and centralized management of their economies. The economy of Yugoslavia was organized according to the theories of Josip Broz Tito and more directly Edvard Kardelj. Croatian scientist Branko Horvat also made a significant contribution to the theory of workers' self-management (radniƒçko samoupravljanje) as practiced in Yugoslavia. Due to Yugoslavia's neutrality and its leading role in the Non- Aligned Movement, Yugoslav companies exported to both Western and Eastern markets. Yugoslav companies carried out construction of numerous major infrastructural and industrial projects in Africa, Europe and Asia. After May 1968 in France, LIP factory, a clockwork factory based in Besan√ßon, became self-managed starting in 1973 after the management's decision to liquidate it. The LIP experience was an emblematic social conflict of post-1968 in France. CFDT (the CCT as it was referred to in Northern Spain), trade-unionist Charles Piaget led the strike in which workers claimed the means of production. The Unified Socialist Party (PSU) which included former Radical Pierre Mend√®s- France was in favour of autogesti√≥n or self-management.LIP, l'imagination au pouvoir, article by Serge Halimi in Le Monde diplomatique, 20 March 2007 . In the Basque Country of Spain, the Mondragon Cooperative Corporation represents perhaps the longest lasting and most successful example of workers' self- management in the world. It has been touted by a diverse group of people such as the Marxian economist Richard D. Wolff and the research book Capital and the Debt Trap by Claudia Sanchez Bajo and Bruno Roelants as an example of how the economy can be organized on an alternative to the capitalist mode of production.Richard D. Wolff (June 24, 2012). \\"Yes, there is an alternative to capitalism: Mondragon shows the way.\\" The Guardian. Retrieved 15 November 2013. Following the 2007-2008 financial crisis, a number of factories were occupied and became self-managed in Greece, France, Italy, Germany and Turkey.  North America  During the Great Depression, worker and utility cooperatives flourished to the point that more than half of American farmers belonged to a cooperative. In general, worker cooperatives and cooperative banking institutions were formed across the country and became a thriving alternative for workers and customers. Due to the economic downturn and stagnation in the rustbelt, worker cooperatives such as the Evergreen Cooperatives have been formed in response, inspired by Mondragon.  South America  In October 2005, the first Encuentro Latinoamericano de Empresas Recuperadas (\\"Latin American Encounter of Recovered Companies\\") took place in Caracas, Venezuela, with representatives of 263 such companies from different countries living through similar economical and social situations. As its main outcome, the meeting had the Compromiso de Caracas (\\"Caracas' Commitment\\"), a vindicating text of the movement. The Hotel Bauen in Buenos Aires, occupied and self-managed since 2003 = Empresas recuperadas movement = Poster for the Movimiento Nacional de Empresas Recuperadas (MNER) at a worker-recovered print shop, Chilavert Artes Gr√°ficas, Buenos Aires English-language discussions of this phenomenon may employ several different translations of the original Spanish expression other than recovered factory. For example, worker-recuperated enterprise, recuperated/recovered factory/business/company, worker-recovered factory/business, worker-recuperated/recovered company, worker-reclaimed factory, and worker-run factory have been noted.Vieta, Marcelo, 2020, Workers' Self-Management in Argentina: Contesting Neo- Liberalism by Occupying Companies, Creating Cooperatives, and Recuperating Autogesti√≥n, Brill, Leiden. The phenomenon is also known as autogesti√≥n,Vieta, Marcelo, 2020, Workers' Self-Management in Argentina: Contesting Neo- Liberalism by Occupying Companies, Creating Cooperatives, and Recuperating Autogesti√≥n, Brill, Leiden. coming from the French and Spanish word for self- management (applied to factories, popular education systems and other uses). Worker self-management may coincide with employee ownership. Argentina's empresas recuperadas movement emerged in response to the run up and aftershocks of Argentina's 2001 economic crisis and is currently the most significant workers' self-management phenomenon in the world. For various reasons, including broken labour contracts, micro- and macro-economic shocks and crises, rising rates of exploitation at work and threats of or actual unemployment and/or firm closure due to bankruptcy, workers took over control of the factories and shops in which they had been employed, often after a factory occupation to circumvent a lockout. Empresas recuperadas means \\"reclaimed/recovered/recuperated enterprises/factories/companies\\". The Spanish verb recuperar means not only \\"to get back\\", \\"to take back\\" or \\"to reclaim\\", but also \\"to put back into good condition\\".Vieta, Marcelo, 2020, Workers' Self-Management in Argentina: Contesting Neo-Liberalism by Occupying Companies, Creating Cooperatives, and Recuperating Autogesti√≥n, Brill, Leiden, pp. 517-519. Although initially referring to industrial facilities, the term may also apply to businesses other than factories (e.g. Hotel Bauen in Buenos Aires). Throughout the 1990s in Argentina's southern province of Neuqu√©n, drastic economic and political events occurred where the citizens ultimately rose up. Although the first shift occurred in a single factory, bosses were progressively fired throughout the province so that by 2005 the workers of the province controlled most of the factories. The movement emerged as a response to the years of crisis leading up to and including Argentina's 2001 economic crisis.Guido Galafassi, Paula Lenguita, Robinson Salazar Perez (2004) Nuevas Practicas Politicas Insumisas En Argentina pp. 222, 238. By 2001‚Äì2002, around 200 Argentine companies were recuperated by their workers and turned into worker co-operatives. Prominent examples include the Brukman factory, the Hotel Bauen and FaSinPat (formerly known as Zanon). As of 2020, around 16,000 Argentine workers run close to 400 recuperated factories.Vieta, Marcelo, 2020, Workers' Self-Management in Argentina: Contesting Neo-Liberalism by Occupying Companies, Creating Cooperatives, and Recuperating Autogesti√≥n, Brill, Leiden, pp. 517-519. The phenomenon of empresas recuperadas (\\"recovered enterprises\\") is not new in Argentina. Rather, such social movements were completely dismantled during the so-called Dirty War in the 1970s. Thus, during H√©ctor C√°mpora's first months of government (May‚ÄìJuly 1973), a rather moderate and left-wing Peronist, approximately 600 social conflicts, strikes and factory occupations had taken place.Hugo Moreno, Le d√©sastre argentin. P√©ronisme, politique et violence sociale (1930‚Äì2001), Editions Syllepses, Paris, 2005, p. 109 . Many recuperated factories/enterprises/workplaces are run co-operatively and workers in many of them receive the same wage. Important management decisions are taken democratically by an assembly of all workers, rather than by professional managers. The proliferation of these \\"recuperations\\" has led to the formation of a recuperated factory movement which has ties to a diverse political network including socialists, Peronists, anarchists and communists. Organizationally, this includes two major federations of recovered factories, the larger Movimiento Nacional de Empresas Recuperadas (National Movement of Recuperated Businesses, or MNER) on the left and the smaller National Movement of Recuperated Factories (MNFR)Movimiento Nacional de Fabricas Recuperadas on the right.Marie Trigona, Recuperated Enterprises in Argentina ‚Äì Reversing the Logic of Capitalism, Znet, March 27, 2006. Some labor unions, unemployed protestors (known as piqueteros), traditional worker cooperatives and a range of political groups have also provided support for these take-overs. In March 2003, with the help of the MNER, former employees of the luxury Hotel Bauen occupied the building and took control of it. One of the difficulties such a movement faces is its relation towards the classic economic system as most classically managed firms refused for various reasons (among them the ideological hostility and the very principle of autogesti√≥n) to work and deal with recovered factories. Thus, isolated recuperated enterprises find it easier to work together in building an alternative, more democratic economic system and manage to reach a critical size and power which enables it to negotiate with the ordinary capitalistic firms. The movement led in 2011 to a new bankruptcy law that facilitates take over by the workers.Pagina12: Nueva Ley de Quiebras (April 2011), F√°bricas recuperadas y tambi√©n legales (June 2nd 2011) The legislation was signed into law by President Cristina Kirchner on June 29, 2011.CFK promulg√≥ la reforma de la Ley de Quiebras in P√°gina/12, June 29, 2011  See also  * Agile software development * Anarcho-syndicalism * Co-determination * Collectivism * Consensus decision-making * Co-operatives * Council communism * Democratic socialism * Employee ownership * Industrial democracy * Lean manufacturing * Libertarian socialism * Management * Market socialism * Mutualism (economic theory) * Open allocation * Participatory economics * Socialization (economics) * Titoism * Workers' control * Workers' council * Worker cooperative * Workplace democracy * Works council  Self- managed organizations  * 1971 Harco work-in, a four-week work-in by Australian steelworkers * Carlist Party * Ceylon Transport Board * Confederaci√≥n Empresarial de Sociedades Laborales de Espa√±a * Corporate Rebels, website on organizational innovation and the future of work * Economy of Yugoslavia, an economy based on self-managed cooperatives * Socialist self- management, the form of self-management used in Yugoslavia * FDSA, Spanish self-managed software programming startup * Haier Group Corporation, the world's largest self-managed company * Mondrag√≥n Corporation, the world's largest group of industrial cooperative companies * The Morning Star Company, a fully self-managed private company * Orpheus Chamber Orchestra * Paris Commune * Springfield ReManufacturing * Unified Socialist Party (France) * United States Federation of Worker Cooperatives * W.

Paul Anthony Ciancia, aged 23, opened fire with a rifle, killing a U.S. government Transportation Security Administration officer and injuring several other people. Shooting On the morning of Friday, November 1, 2013, Ciancia entered Terminal 3 of Los Angeles International Airport after being dropped off there by a roommate. He was carrying a bag filled with a semiautomatic, .223-caliber Smith & Wesson M&P-15; rifle, five 30-round magazines, and hundreds of additional rounds of ammunition contained in boxes. Walking up to a TSA checkpoint, he pulled the rifle out of the bag and opened fire, shooting TSA Officer Gerardo Hernandez in the chest at point-blank range. He then went up an escalator, but returned to the checkpoint and shot Hernandez again after seeing him move. Ciancia then moved up the escalator into the TSA screening area, passed the checkpoint area, and moved farther into the secure airside area of the terminal. At the time, many people fled by going into the concourse area or through doors leading into the airfield. Others ran into the restaurant where staff locked the metal security doors and ordered customers to take cover under the restaurant‚Äôs tables. Entering the concourse area, Ciancia continued firing, wounding two TSA agents and a passenger. People hiding in the concourse area then fled the terminal through street exits. One witness, interviewed on CNN, said the gunman was walking, not running, down the terminal's concourse, and actor Tim Daly reported hearing shooting while in the Virgin America first- class lounge. According to several witnesses, Ciancia repeatedly asked passersby if they were TSA agents and then moved on without shooting when they said no. At 9:20 a.m., the first calls to 9-1-1 were made, followed by the arrival of the first LAX officers two minutes later. Ciancia made it as far as the end of the terminal in the food court, where LAX police officers confronted him and shot him in a gunfight. He was wounded four times by gunshots and captured before being transported via ambulance to a nearby trauma hospital. Witnesses saw a rifle with three magazines nearby on the floor of the waiting area near gates 35 and 36. Police were unsure whether the terminal was safe for paramedics to enter, and as a result Hernandez lay wounded about 20 feet from an exit without medical attention for 33 minutes. He bled out from his gunshot wounds before being put in a wheelchair and escorted out of the terminal. He was taken to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. Victims=Fatality The gunman shot TSA Officer Gerardo I. Hernandez, age 39, at the airport. Hernandez was pronounced dead after arriving at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, although coroner officials asserted that he was dead within a few minutes of getting shot.Richard Winton and Kate Mather (Los Angeles Times), November 20, 2013. TSA agent shot at Los Angeles airport died in two to five minutes . Hernandez is the first TSA officer in the twelve-year history of the agency to have been killed on the job. A behavior detection officer, Hernandez had immigrated to the United States from El Salvador at age 15. According to an autopsy report, Hernandez was shot 12 times, with his heart being grazed several times and his bladder and intestines pierced. More than 40 bullet fragments were also lodged in his body, and he died within two to five minutes after being shot. Injuries Seven victims were treated at the scene. Three victims were wounded by gunfire, including two TSA officers, identified as 54-year-old James Speer and 36-year-old Tony Grigsby; Grigsby was shot in the foot. The third shooting victim was 29-year-old Brian Ludmer, a schoolteacher from Lake Forest, Illinois, who was shot in the leg. Six victims were transported to area hospitals, including three men, two of whom had suffered gunshot wounds, who were treated at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. Some of the injuries were confirmed to have been caused by other factors, not gunshot wounds. Ciancia was shot four times, including wounds in the head and leg, by law enforcement in the food court area of Terminal 3 and was in critical condition. The officers kicked the rifle away from him. He was then transported to a local trauma hospital via ambulance. Video from KCAL-TV shows Ciancia brought into the hospital from an ambulance, surrounded by multiple police officers, while handcuffed to a gurney. Perpetrator Paul Anthony Ciancia, age 23 at the time of the shooting, perpetrated the attack.Matt Hamilton, LAX shooter's plea agreement reveals he did not consider himself a terrorist, but a 'patriot' , Los Angeles Times (September 1, 2016).Joel Rubin, LAX gunman who targeted TSA officers is sentenced to life in prison , Los Angeles Times (November 7, 2016). An unemployed car mechanic, he lived in the Sun Valley neighborhood of Los Angeles and grew up in Pennsville, New Jersey. In 2008, Ciancia graduated from Salesianum School. After the shooting ended, Ciancia was found to be carrying a note stating that he \\"wanted to kill TSA\\" and describing them as \\"pigs\\". It also mentioned \\"fiat currency\\" and \\"NWO\\", the latter likely being a reference to the New World Order conspiracy theory. On the day of the shooting and before Ciancia was identified as the suspect, the LAPD went to his residence when concerned family members wanted to file a missing persons report after not having heard from him after repeated attempts to make contact. Ciancia was not at home at the time and his roommates told them that he had been there earlier in the day. The police left and could not file a report, because they had no confirmation on where he was. Ciancia had talked about taking his own life a few days earlier. According to reports, on the day of the shooting, Ciancia burst into the room of an unidentified roommate and demanded him to drive him to the airport immediately, and the roommate, not sensing any intention of committing violence, agreed to do so. Days prior to the shooting, Ciancia had begun asking for a ride to the airport so he could fly back to New Jersey, claiming that his father was ill. Aftermath=Immediate reaction Los Angeles Airport Police evacuated several terminals and searched for any other possible suspects. They searched in cars with armed officers and a bomb- sniffing dog at the nearby parking garages that are connected to airport terminals by pedestrian bridges. The Federal Aviation Administration grounded all outbound flights at the airport. Runways 24L and 24R were shut down. Terminals 1, 2, and 3 were shut down and the 300 passengers were evacuated from these terminals to the Tom Bradley International Terminal for questioning, and then were re-screened as they exited the international terminal. Airlines diverted some flights to other airports in the Greater Los Angeles Area. Most were directed to Ontario International Airport, and others to Long Beach Airport. Most of the diverted flights were originally scheduled to taxi to gates at Terminals 1, 2, and 3. Over 1,500 flights and 171,000 passengers were affected by the incident. Later that afternoon, Ciancia's family released a statement, saying that they were \\"shocked and numbed\\" by his actions and also expressing their sympathies to the family of Gerardo Hernandez, and also to the wounded victims. Security and emergency response In the wake of the shooting, ongoing debates over the effectiveness of airport security were reignited, with several suggestions being made about arming TSA officers with guns. In response to these suggestions, TSA Administrator John S. Pistole commented, \\"[Officer safety] is something we have dealt with really since the standup of TSA, knowing that in many respects TSA employees are the first line of defense when it comes to airport security particularly. And so given this tragedy, we will obviously look at and review our policies with airport police both here at LAX and of course around the country.\\" Tom Ridge, the former secretary for the United States Department of Homeland Security, criticized the suggestion of arming TSA officers, calling it a \\"big mistake\\" and saying, \\"You have literally hundreds and hundreds of armed police officers roaming every major airport in America. And I don't think arming another 40 or 50 or 60 thousand people ... would have prevented this incident from happening.\\" An investigation by several agencies has been opened to determine whether paramedics should have been allowed inside the terminal much earlier to aid Hernandez and the other wounded victims. The Los Angeles Police Department has also opened an investigation into an officer who allegedly improperly told emergency responders that Hernandez was dead when he was checked five minutes after the shooting ended. On January 22, 2014, it was revealed that the two unarmed officers assigned to the area had gone on a break at the time of the shooting, without carrying out the requirement of informing a dispatcher, with one being at the bathroom of an adjacent terminal. In response to the new details, airport police union chief Marshall McClain stated that the two officers were still capable of quickly responding to the shooting, adding, \\"I want to make sure that in any terminal, there's always somebody there, that a bathroom break doesn't result in somebody, even for a few minutes, being out of the action.\\" On March 18, 2014, a released 83-page report highlighted flaws in various divisions and current systems of the airport, adding that emergency response had been hindered by \\"communication problems and poor coordination\\". The report also laid out an estimated 50 recommendations, including one for training airport police to be trained in tactical medicine and for training paramedics to enter more dangerous zones earlier with the protection of law enforcement. In addition, it was critical of the current airport emergency management program, saying that it was \\"not well-defined or widely understood across the agency, or perhaps even respected\\". It was also reported that at the time of the shooting, a union representing the airport's lower-level employees was not trained for an evacuation and did not know what to do or how to help passengers. Jeffrey David Cox, Sr., the president of the American Federation of Government Employees, called the lack of coordination \\"absolutely unacceptable\\" and criticized the report as being incomplete and failing to note the two airport officers who were not on their shifts at the time of the shooting. On June 6, 2014, Rep. Richard Hudson (R, NC-8) introduced the Gerardo Hernandez Airport Security Act of 2014 (H.R. 4802; 113th Congress) in response to the findings about events of the shooting. The bill would direct the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Transportation Security Administration, to undertake a variety of activities aimed at enhancing security at airports where TSA performs oversees security-related activities. The bill would require TSA to verify that all such airports have plans in place for responding to security threats and to provide technical assistance as necessary to improve such plans. H.R. 4802 also would require TSA to disseminate information on best practices for addressing security threats and ensure that all screening personnel have received training in how to handle potential shooting threats. Finally, H.R. 4802 would require the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Cybersecurity and Communications to report to the Congress on the capacity of law enforcement, fire, and medical response teams to communicate and respond to security threats at airports. It passed in the House on July 22, 2014. Charges and prosecution On November 2, 2013, federal prosecutors charged Ciancia with murder of a federal officer and committing violence at an international airport. Ciancia also faced additional federal and/or state charges, including attempted murder in relation to the two men who were wounded by gunfire. On November 19, 2013, Ciancia was released from hospital after recovering from his gunshot wounds, and was taken into custody by agents from the United States Marshals Service (US Marshals). On December 5, 2013, Ciancia appeared for the first time in court, where he was remanded without bail because he posed a threat to the community. On December 17, 2013, a federal grand jury indicted Ciancia on 11 counts, including first-degree murder. This raised the possibility that he could have received the death penalty if he was convicted. On December 26, 2013, Ciancia pleaded not guilty to the charge of first-degree murder. On March 3, 2014, a judge ordered that Ciancia be moved from a treatment facility at a San Bernardino County jail to a federal detention facility in Los Angeles.Federal Bureau of Prisons Inmate Locator : Paul Anthony Ciancia, #67089-112.

Blount Fine Foods is headquartered in Fall River, Massachusetts with a production facility in Warren, Rhode Island. History Blount Seafood Corporation was founded by F. Nelson Blount, whose family was involved in the shellfish industry since the 1880s. After a 1938 hurricane devastated the oyster business in Narragansett Bay, Blount helped introduce the bay quahog (a hard-shell clam) as a source of protein during the Second World War. In 1946, he entered the food-processing industry and consolidated several smaller shellfish firms to found the company, which provided chopped clams to soup manufacturers throughout the United States, including Campbell Soup. The corporation changed its name to Blount Fine Foods, Inc. in 2008. Todd Blount has served as president and CEO since 2000, and is the third generation of the Blount family to lead the company. In 2004, Blount Fine Foods expanded from its Warren location to include a headquarters facility in Fall River.

Previous studies have found correlations between exposure to vehicle pollutants and certain diseases such as asthma, lung and heart disease, and cancer among others. Car pollutants include carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter (fine dusts and soot), and toxic air pollutants While these pollutants affect the general health of populations, they are known to also have specific adverse effects on expectant mothers and their fetuses. The purpose of this article is to outline how vehicular pollutants affect the health of expectant mothers and the adverse health effects these exposure have on the adult. Population characteristics In Los Angeles County, researchers found a higher risk in premature birth (10-20%) and low birth weight for infants whose mothers lived near high traffic areas Wilhelm, Ritz. (2002). Residential Proximity to Traffic and Adverse Birth Outcomes in Los Angeles County, California, 1994-1996. Environmental Health Perspectives. doi: 10.1289/ehp.5688 Studies conducted on populations living near the 405 and 710 interstates in Southern California found their exposure to particulate vehicle emissions to be almost 25 times higher than for people living 1000 ft from the freeways. This research also concluded that particulate vehicle emissions are more toxic to children's health than other particles such as Carbon Monoxide and Nitrogen Dioxide Zhu, Hinds, Kim, Sioutas. Concentration and size distribution of ultrafine particles near a major highway. Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association. September 2002. Zhu, Hinds, Kim, Shen, Sioutas.

Atmos Environ 2003, 37:3455-3468 Dangers of vehicle emissions=Carbon monoxide Carbon monoxide (CO) is directly released from motor vehicles engines, which are a major source of this pollutant in the LA Basin 5\\\\. CO inhaled by pregnant women may threaten the unborn child's growth and mental development. Because CO competes with Oxygen to achieve dispersion throughout the blood stream, fetal hypoxia (lack of oxygen) may result at high levels of maternal CO exposure, however the exact amount of exposure of CO to become a fetal threat is unknown High levels of carbon monoxide are also found in cigarettes, it is advised that pregnant women avoid smoking so as to not run the risk of affecting their child's growth or mental development. For further information on Carbon Monoxide and its effects on human health please see, Carbon monoxide poisoning. Nitrogen oxides Nitrogen oxides (NO) are common air pollutants found throughout most of the United States. You can be exposed to these oxides by breathing polluted air, which is most commonly found in areas with heavy motor vehicle traffic Exposure to high levels of Nitrogen oxides damages tissues of the throat and upper respiratory tract and can interfere with the body's ability to carry oxygen. High exposure to nitrogen dioxide may cause fetal mutations, damage a developing fetus, and decrease a woman's ability to become pregnant. Studies have also shown that higher exposures to NO inhibit embryo development during both traditional pregnancies and artificial inseminations Particulate matter Examples of particulate matter include ash from smoke in campfires, dust particles around your house, and smoke coming from car exhaust pipes; in areas close to freeways this is a problem. A study conducted on European women indicated that higher exposure to particulate matter during the initial first weeks of their pregnancy resulted in low birth weight babies Dejmek, J., Selevan, S. , Bene≈°, I. , Solansk√Ω, I. , & ≈†r√°m, R. (1999). Fetal growth and maternal exposure to particulate matter during pregnancy. Environmental Health Perspectives, 107(6), 475-480 This toxin is also considered to be the most dangerous of the three because it can be basically anything small enough to be inhaled. This may also be due to the fact that brain growth begins within the first month of conception. Low-birth weight (LBW), and preterm delivery A previous study conducted in the Los Angeles Basin of Southern California reported a consistent association between levels of CO and particulate matter during the first trimester and the last six weeks prior to birth and risk of preterm birth. Prematurity in babies is accompanied by an array of health complications. Children born prematurely are at highest risk for developing Infant respiratory distress syndrome, gastrointestinal, and hematologic diseases, central nervous system (CNS) problems such as hearing loss, are more prone to infections, and at risk for hearing and vision loss. Babies born of low weight are also at risk for respiratory, gastrointestinal, cardiac, CNS, infection and vision problems. These gestational issues persist until the adult years for most children and result in high blood pressure, Type II Diabetes, and other heart diseases. Prematurity and Low Birth Weight caused by air pollution also affects fetal brain development. This is of importance since lack of proper brain development will not allow a child's brain to form proper synapse connections which will negatively affect the child's speech, learning abilities, and social skills. Long-term and short-term effects on babies Exposure to vehicle air pollutants has been noted as primary cause for infant mortality and morbidity, and is also argued to be a cause of chronic diseases such as asthma in child and adulthood Dollfus C, Patetta M, Siegel E, Cross AW. Infant mortality: a practical approach to the analysis of the leading causes of death and risk factors. Pediatrics 1990; 86:176‚Äì183 Asthma The number of children affected by asthma has increased in past decades the point where it is now the most chronic illness in children and the most common cause of children hospitalizations in the U.S. causing it to also be a number one contributor to school absencesGasana, J., Dillikar, D. , Mendy, A. , Forno, E. , & Ramos Vieira, E. (2012). Motor vehicle air pollution and asthma in children: A meta-analysis. Environmental Research, 117, 36-45 Excessive school absences ultimately affect the child's learning ability, and decrease their time to socialize with kids their age. It is not uncommon for children who suffer from asthma to oftentimes repeat grades due to failure to keep up academically. Respiratory problems Studies have found that children who are exposed to higher levels of car pollutants report higher respiratory problems including wheezing, ear and throat infections and have a higher incidence of physician-diagnosed asthma. Cancer Children living in close proximity to high traffic areas are also eight times more likely to develop leukemia compared to children who do not Vinceti, M., Rothman, K. , Crespi, C. , Sterni, A. , Cherubini, A. , et al. (2012). Leukemia risk in children exposed to benzene and pm10 from vehicular traffic: A case-control study in an italian population. European Journal of Epidemiology, 27(10), 781 This finding indicates that children who develop cancer as a result of traffic exposure will also spend more time in the hospital. This is not only a cause of school absences, but also a time of trauma for a child who is constantly visiting providers for treatment. Children with cancer have a harder time keeping up with school and keeping up with their friends Anonymous,. (2012). Awareness week highlights effects of cancer on young children. Cancer Nursing Practice, 11(10), 5 Traffic exposure and autism Autism is a spectrum of disorders that range from a severe inability to communicate and some mental disabilities to milder symptoms such as attention disorders. Some claims exist that the incidence of autism is higher for babies whose mothers spend time in ‚Äòhigh traffic pollution‚Äô areas compared to mothers who spend their pregnancy in cleaner air. In a recent study conducted by UCLA, air pollutant levels were measured for mothers who had children with autism and then compared to air pollutant levels in environments for mothers who had children without autism. This study found that babies who were exposed to higher levels of pollutants while in the womb had a 10% higher risk of autism than babies who had low levels of exposure; another finding from this study is that fine particulates had the strongest association with autism Becerra, T., Wilhelm, M. , Olsen, J. , Cockburn, M. , & Ritz, B.

Facial reconstruction of the skull of an indigenous woman who lived around 1600 years ago, found in Rocha Department, Uruguay. Arrowheads found in Colonia Department. Indigenous peoples in Uruguay or Native Uruguayans, are a very small share of the population. Scholars do not agree about the first settlers in what is now Uruguay; but there is evidence that there was human presence some 10,000 years BCE, the Homo catalanensis culture. Indigenous Uruguayans disappeared in the 1830s and with the exception of the Guaran√≠, little is known about these peoples and even less about their genetic characteristics. The Charr√∫a peoples were perhaps the most-talked- about indigenous people of the Southern Cone in what was known as the Banda Oriental.Burford, Tim. Uruguay. Bucks, UK: Bradt Travel Guides, 2011. . During pre-colonial times Uruguayan territory was inhabited by small tribes of nomadic Charrua, Chana, Arachan and Guarani peoples. They were a semi-nomadic people who survived by hunting, fishing and gathering and probably never reached more than 10,000 ‚Äì 20,000 people. It is estimated that there were about 9,000 Charr√∫a and 6,000 Chan√° and Guaran√≠ at the time of contact with the Spanish in the 1500s. By the time of independence, some 300 years later, there were only about 500 native peoples remaining in Uruguay. The cause of the decline in native populations was disease, as well as intermarriage. With little immunity to these diseases, native peoples and culture were gradually diminished. Native peoples had almost disappeared by the time of Independence as a result of European diseases and constant warfare. European genocide culminated on April 11, 1831 with the Massacre of Salsipuedes, where most of the Charrua men were killed by the Uruguayan army on the orders of President Fructuoso Rivera, and the remaining 300 Charrua women and children were divided as household slaves and servants among Europeans. By 1840 there were only 18 surviving Charrua in Uruguay.. According to the history professor and journalist Lincoln Maiztegui Casas, ‚Äúthe disappearance of the Charr√∫a people was a gradual process that took more than 200 years, and the root cause was territorial occupation by Europeans‚Äù. Other significant tribes were the Minuane, Yaro, G√ºenoa, Chan√°, Boh√°n, Arach√°n. Languages once spoken in the area include Charr√∫a, Chan√°, G√ºenoa, Guaran√≠. Nowadays a minor percentage of Uruguayans have indigenous descent. According to the 2011 Census, 2.4% of the population reported having indigenous ancestry. A 2009 DNA study in the American Journal of Human Biology showed a genetic composition of 92% European, 7% African, and 1% Native American in Montevideo.

McBratney, 104 U.S. 621 (1881), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that upon the admission of Colorado as a state, there being no reservation to the United States of jurisdiction over the Indian territory within the state limits, that the United States circuit court for the district of Colorado had no jurisdiction over the murder of one white man by another in the Ute reservation in said state.  Background  McBratney was convicted of the murder of Thomas Casey on the Ute Reservation in Colorado. Following conviction, McBratney appealed claiming that the federal courts did not have jurisdiction to try a white man for the murder of another white man on an Indian reservation. On appeal, the circuit court could not come to an agreement and issued a certificate of division.., 81 (2013).  Supreme Court  Justice Horace Gray delivered the opinion of the court. Gray stated that although the treaty with the Utes provided for federal jurisdiction, the act of Congress creating the state of Colorado did not reserve federal jurisdiction over Indian reservations. He noted that in the past, Congress had explicitly reserved such lands and jurisdiction, as in the case of Kansas. The federal court would still have jurisdiction for crimes committed against Indians by whites, or vice versa, but the state otherwise had jurisdiction., 192 (2001).

Nelson recorded the song while working as a disk jockey at KVAN in Vancouver, Washington, using a studio of the radio. Through a DJ he met during his time working on the radio in Texas, he contacted Starday Records, sending the tapes over to the label. Starday Records pressed for Nelson 500 copies of the single, issued under the custom label \\"Willie Nelson Records\\". The company initially reserved the rights for re-publications under the Starday label, but decided later not to exercise the right. Nelson sold the record over his radio show The Western Express, a final total of 3,000 units. Background After working in different radio stations as a disk jockey in Texas, Willie Nelson moved to Portland, Oregon in 1956. Nelson was soon hired by KVAN, where he hosted the hour-long show The Western Express. He soon gained popularity in the area, making public appearances singing in Vancouver clubs, and at other local events. Nelson's show was soon upgraded, hosting by 1957 a three-hour long show, and becoming one of the most listened radio personalities in the Portland-Vancouver area. Recording and release Taking advantage of his local popularity, Nelson decided that it was time to record his debut single. He chose, for the main side his original \\"No Place for Me\\", bringing local steel guitarist Buddy Fite to back him. Nelson played his own guitar on the recording in a boom-chicka-boom style> The song went for 78 seconds. He included on the flipside, for commercial purposes, Leon Payne's \\"Lumberjack\\", which was set in the state of Oregon. Nelson recorded both songs with the existing equipment in a studio of the radio station. During his time working on the radio in Texas, Nelson met disc jockey T. Texas Tyler. He called Tyler to ask for his help to press the records. Tyler called his acquaintance Don Pierce, who worked in Pappy Daily's Starday Records. Nelson mailed the tapes to Starday, who pressed 500 recordings under the custom \\"Willie Nelson Label\\". Nelson paid for the records, agreeing to Starday's policy of reserving the rights of the tracks for further releases on the Starday label or for the label to act as a publisher of the song. Ultimately, Starday decided not to exercise the right, since neither Pierce nor Daily felt that the songs had the potential for a label release. Nelson sold the records on-air during his show in February 1957, offering them for US$1, with the addition of an 8x10 autographed photograph. The single sold 3,000 copies.

Tarvin changed hands several times; initially it was garrisoned by Parliament and troops of both sides at different times were quartered in and around the village, which was not fortified. In September 1644 the Parliamentarians (Roundheads) fortified the village and garrisoned the place with sufficient troops to withstand a large attack and it remained in their hands until the end of the war. History On Sunday 12 November 1643, Royalists sallied out of Chester towards Tarvin ‚Äî which was garrisoned by Parliament under the command of Captain Gerard ‚Äî but the Royalists were intercepted at Stamford Bridge and prevented from crossing it. The two sides skirmished all the afternoon but then Parliamentary reinforcements from Cholmondeley arrived to assist Gerard and they drove the Royalists back, following them to Boughton, Cheshire and into Gorse Stacks on the outskirts of Chester, where they killed some of them. The Parliamentarians' only casualty was one man wounded. In late January 1644, some Parliamentary forces billeted in and about Tarvin were taken by surprise in an attack by the Chester Royalists. Some were wounded, and others were taken prisoner but as the Royalists returned to Chester with their captives, they were overtaken by a company of Parliamentary dragoons. In the melee that followed a Royalist captain and some of his men were killed, while others were wounded. The dragoons freed the prisoners and took eight of their own, all of whom were sent to Nantwich. On Sunday 18 August 1644, Colonel Marrow marched from Chester with a detachment of foot (infantry) and horse (cavalry) towards Northwich, and on the way they took cattle without paying for them. When Morrow's scouts approached Hartford Green, a party of soldiers from the garrison sallied out to chase them off, but the Parliamentary soldiers got too close to the main body. A skirmish ensued at Sandyway. The Royalists won the day taking fifteen prisoners, but Colonel Marrow was mortally wounded and died the next day in Chester. After the skirmish it seems that the Royalist detachment made for Tarvin, because two days later (Tuesday 20 August) a party of Parliamentarians from Nantwich with the assistance of Sir William Brereton's horse and reinforcements from Halton Castle attacked the Royalists quartered at Tarvin and for the fifteen prisoners they lost two days earlier taking between 200 and 300 horses, capturing 45 prisoners and killing 15, all for the loss of only one man. On Friday 30 August 1644, all the Parliamentary garrison of Nantwich, except Major Croxton's and the Town's trained bands, marched to Middlewich where they encamped for the night. The next day they proceeded to Northwich and Great Budworth, and then to Tarvin, which they fortified with strong earth works and garrisoned it, declaring it to be a market town. They also garrisoned Huxley Hall and Oulton Hall near Little Budworth.Burghall states that the expedition left Nantwich on 5 September . The fortifications and the garrison must have been stronger than those of other garrisons because Tarvin appears to have been the only garrison in Cheshire, except Nantwich, which was not abandoned on the reported approach of the King, in May 1645. On Monday, 9 June 1645, three companies of horse and six of Royalist foot sallied out of Chester and captured the Parliamentary Captain Glegge and his troop of horse before they could escape from their quarters. They were quickly rescued in a counterattack mounted by the Tarvin garrison. The Royalists retreated to the parish of Eaton and Rushton, where near the forest of Delamere they turned to give battle. The Parliamentarians killed ten and captured two captains, some more junior officers and about two hundred and ten soldiers with many bags of powder and some about 300 fire arms. The Parliamentarians' casualties were three killed and taken prisoner. The following day the Royalist prisoners were sent from Tarvin to Nantwich. On 11 June 1645 fourteen or fifteen of the prisoners were tried under a council of war. Three were judged to be Irish and were hanged under the provisions of the Ordinance of no quarter to the Irish. On 19 September 1645 large pieces of ordinance which were within the fortifications at Tarvin were moved to Chester to help to batter the city into submission. Within a few hours the artillery pieces had done their work making a breach four men wide in the city wall to the left of the Newgate. At eight that night the city was assaulted through the breach and captured. The church at Tarvin shows signs of its part in the battles. There are cannonball and musket ball holes in the wall of St Andrews church tower next to the west door. It has been said that prisoners were shot against this wall, which explains some of the bullet holes. The church was also used as a refuge by soldiers and the tower was probably used as a lookout post.

Then Nothing.\\" National Interest is an American hypersonic UAV concept intended for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance proposed privately in 2013 by Lockheed Martin as a successor to the retired Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird. The company expected an SR-72 test vehicle could fly by 2023. Design and development=Background and early work The SR-71 Blackbird was retired by the USAF in 1998, leaving what was considered a coverage gap between surveillance satellites, manned aircraft, and unmanned aerial vehicles for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) and strike missions. With the growth of anti-satellite weapons, anti-access/area denial tactics, and counter-stealth technologies, it was thought that a high-speed aircraft could penetrate protected airspace and observe or strike a target before enemies could detect or intercept it. The proposed reliance on extremely high speed to penetrate defended airspace is considered a significant conceptual departure from the emphasis on stealth in fifth-generation jet fighter programs and projected drone developments. There were unconfirmed reports about the SR-72 dating back to 2007, when various sources disclosed that Lockheed Martin was developing an airplane able to fly six times the speed of sound or for the United States Air Force. Lockheed Martin Skunk Works' development work on the SR-72 was first published by Aviation Week & Space Technology on 1 November 2013. Public attention to the news was large enough to overwhelm the Aviation Week servers. To attain its design speeds, Lockheed Martin has been collaborating with Aerojet Rocketdyne since 2006 on an appropriate engine. The company is developing the system from the scramjet-powered HTV-3X, which was canceled in 2008. The SR-72 is envisioned with an air-breathing hypersonic propulsion system that has the ability to accelerate from standstill to Mach 6 using the same engine, making it about twice as fast as the SR-71. The challenge is to design an engine to encompass the flight regimes of subsonic, supersonic and hypersonic speeds. Using turbine compression, turbojet engines can work at zero speed and usually perform best up to Mach 2.2. Ramjets, using aerodynamic compression with subsonic combustion, perform poorly under Mach 0.5 and are most efficient around Mach 3, being able to go up to around Mach 6. The SR-71's specially designed engines converted to low-speed ramjets by redirecting the airflow around the core and into the afterburner for speeds greater than Mach 2.5. Finally, scramjets with supersonic combustion cover the range of high supersonic to hypersonic speeds. The SR-72 is to use a turbine- based combined cycle (TBCC) system to use a turbine engine at low speeds and a scramjet engine at high speeds. The turbine and ramjet engines share common inlet and nozzle, with different airflow paths in between. At speeds of Mach 5 and above, aerodynamic heating creates temperatures hot enough to melt conventional metallic airframes, so engineers are considering composites such as high-performance carbon, ceramic, and metal mixes, for fabrication of critical components. Such composites have been used in intercontinental ballistic missiles and the retired Space Shuttle. , the SR-72 was envisioned as an ISR and strike platform, but no payloads were specified, likely because current payloads would be insufficient on an aircraft flying at Mach 6 up to high requiring hundreds of miles to turn. New sensors and weapons would likely have to be created specifically to operate at such speeds. In November 2013, construction of an optionally-piloted scaled demonstrator was planned to start in 2018. The demonstrator was to be about long, about the size of a Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor, and powered by one full-scale engine to fly for several minutes at Mach 6. SR-72 flight testing was planned to follow the timeline for the hypersonic High Speed Strike Weapon. The SR-72 is to be similar in size to the SR-71 at over long and have the same range, with entry into service by 2030. The SR-72 follows the US Air Force's hypersonic road map for developing a hypersonic strike weapon by 2020, and a penetrating ISR aircraft by 2030. At the time of the concept's unveiling, Lockheed Martin had engaged in talks with government officials, but has not secured funding for the demonstrator or engine. On 13 November 2013, Air Force Chief of Staff General Mark Welsh revealed that the service was interested in the SR-72's hypersonic capabilities, but had not spoken with Lockheed Martin about the aircraft. Its high speed appeals to the service to reduce the time an adversary would have to react to an operation. They are pursuing hypersonic technology, but don't yet have the material ability to construct a full-size plane like the unmanned SR-72. The SR-72 was unveiled in the midst of sequestration budget cuts that have required the Air Force to balance capability, capacity, and mission readiness. By the mid-2020s, it is believed that foreign countries will produce and export advanced aerial technologies that could end up in battlespaces against the U.S. This drives the Air Force to further develop new systems, including hypersonic, to replace outclassed legacy systems. In 2013, it was reported that the SR-72 may face significant challenges to being accepted by the Air Force, as they are opting to develop the Northrop Grumman RQ-180 stealth UAV to perform the task of conducting ISR missions in contested airspace. Compared to the SR-72, the RQ-180 is less complex to design and manufacture, less prone to problems with acquisition, and could enter service as soon as 2015. 2014 NASA contract In December 2014, NASA awarded Lockheed Martin a contract to study the feasibility of building the SR-72's propulsion system using existing turbine engine technologies. The $892,292 contract funds a design study to determine the viability of a TBCC propulsion system by combining one of several current turbine engines, with a very low Mach ignition Dual Mode Ramjet (DMRJ). NASA previously funded a Lockheed Martin study that found speeds up to Mach 7 could be achieved with a dual-mode engine combining turbine and ramjet technologies. The problem with hypersonic propulsion has always been the gap between the highest speed capabilities of a turbojet, from around Mach 2.2 to the lowest speed of a scramjet at Mach 4. Typical turbine engines cannot achieve high enough speeds for a scramjet to take over and continue accelerating. The NASA-Lockheed Martin study is looking at the possibility of a higher-speed turbine engine or a scramjet that can function in a turbine engine's slower flight envelope; the DARPA HTV-3X had demonstrated a low-speed ramjet (Dual Mode Ram Jet) that could operate below Mach 3. Existing turbofan engines powering jet fighters and other experimental designs are being considered for modification. If the study is successful, NASA will fund a demonstrator to test the DMRJ in a flight research vehicle. In March 2016, Lockheed Martin CEO Hewson stated that the company was on the verge of a technological breakthrough that would allow its conceptual SR-72 hypersonic plane to reach Mach 6\\\\. A hypersonic demonstrator aircraft the size of an F-22 stealth fighter could be built for less than $1 billion. From 2017 In June 2017, Lockheed Martin announced that the SR-72 would be in development by the early 2020s, with top speed in excess Mach 6. Executive Vice President Rob Weiss commented that \\"We've been saying hypersonics [are] two years away for the last 20 years, but all I can say is the technology is mature and we, along with DARPA and the services, are working hard to get that capability into the hands of our warfighters as soon as possible.\\" In January 2018, Lockheed Vice President Jack O'Banion gave a presentation that credited the advancements in additive manufacturing and computer modeling, stating that it would not have been possible to make the airplane five years ago, and that 3D printing allowed a cooling system to be embedded in the engine. In February 2018, Orlando Carvalho, Executive Vice President of aeronautics at Lockheed Martin, pushed back on reports of the SR-72's development stating that no SR-72 had been produced. He also clarified that hypersonic research is fueling weapons systems development, and that \\"Eventually as that technology is matured, it could ultimately enable the development of a reusable vehicle. Prior to this we may have referred to it as a \\"like an SR-72\\", but now the terminology of choice is \\"reusable vehicle\\".Waldron, Greg. \\"SINGAPORE: Lockheed's Carvalho kiboshes SR-72 idea\\". Flight Global, 8 February 2018. In November 2018, Lockheed Martin stated that a prototype of the SR-72 was scheduled to fly by 2025. The aircraft will be capable of firing hypersonic missiles.

Background A native of Chattanooga, Tennessee, Bolton was the daughter of Elizabeth Griffiths and Archibald Stevenson McLundie. She moved to Alexandria at an early age and graduated from Bolton High School in 1933. After graduation from the female Stephens College in Columbia, Missouri, she attended Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. On April 14, 1939, she married the banker Robert H. Bolton, son of James W. Bolton in Alexandria and remained in Alexandria. The couple had three children, Robert H. Bolton, Jr., of Princeton, New Jersey, Elizabeth Bolton Hassinger, wife of Robert C. Hassinger of New Orleans, and Mary Bolton Jennings, wife of James K. Jennings, Jr., of Houston, Texas. Cultural contributions In 1977, Bolton founded the Alexandria Museum. She received a special congressional citation from Louisiana's 8th congressional district, since disbanded, for outstanding civic and community service to the nation, state and community. She organized and was the first president of the Historical Association of Central Louisiana. From the New Orleans chapter of the Landmarks Society, she received the Harriet Kane Award, which designates the individual who has best promoted an understanding of historic Louisiana. The Alexandria Daily Town Talk honored Bolton with the Alexandria Civic Oscar Award for achievement in community service. Bolton was a president of the Louisiana State Museum Board, the first woman and the first non-resident of New Orleans ever to hold this position. She was also a founder of the museum board foundation. She was a member of the President's National Council on Historic Preservation and the state review committee which recommends entries to the National Register of Historic Places. Bolton was a president and chairman of board of the restored Kent Plantation House in Alexandria, the oldest known standing structure in Rapides Parish, completed in 1800. Bolton was a member of the boards of the Alexandria Historical and Genealogical Library and the Anglo American Art Museum in Baton Rouge. She donated two sculptures, \\"Moses\\" and \\"John the Baptist,\\" by Charles Umlauf to Louisiana College in Pineville and the sculpture \\"Angels\\" by Lyn Emory to Emmanuel Baptist Church, her home congregation in downtown Alexandria. Death and legacy Bolton died in Alexandria at the age of sixty-nine. Along with other Bolton family members, she and her husband Robert are interred at Greenwood Memorial Park in Pineville. Bolton received posthumous recognition from the Louisiana Association of Museums, the Louisiana Department of Culture, Recreation, and Tourism, and the Historical Association of Louisiana. The Elizabeth McLundie Bolton Golden Circle Award recognizes those who promote excellence in the arts. The annual Peggy Bolton Lecture Series, sponsored by the Historical Association of Central Louisiana, was organized and named in her honor by the late Louisiana College psychology professor George E. Hearn.

The ridge is normally covered by ice year-round, and reaches an approximate bathymetric prominence of 3,400 m with its highest point at 246 m below sea level. As a subsea ridge extending from the continental shelf of the United States north of Alaska, the Chukchi Plateau is an important feature in maritime law of the Arctic Ocean and has been the subject of significant geographic research. The ridge has been extensively mapped by the USCGC Healy, and by the Canadian icebreaker CCGS Louis S. St- Laurent (with the Healy) in 2011 and RV Marcus Langseth, a National Science Foundation vessel operated by the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University.  Geology  The cap is normally ice-covered, year-round. The cap lies roughly about 800 kilometres north of the Point Barrow, Alaska. The area is notable because it is believed to be rich in natural resources (especially oil, natural gas and manganese). The geologic history of Arctic Ocean basins is a major source of debate among marine geophysicists. The difficulties associated with collecting marine geologic and geophysical data in this remote region has added to the debate on the tectonic history of the Arctic Ocean and the formation of its bathymetric features. The Chukchi Borderland, which comprises the subsea region north of the Alaskan coast as well as the bathymetric highs of the Chukchi Plateau and the adjacent Northwind Ridge, is a continental fragment that is thought to have drifted from the Canadian continental margin.http://www.agu.org/books/gd/v006/GD006p0045/GD006p0045.pdf The geomorphology of the region is defined by north-south trending normal faulting ‚Äìtectonic activity typical of continental rifting. Although there is no consensus as to the pre-rift location of the Chukchi Borderland, its tectonic migration could be attributed to an inferred spreading center indicated by a linear gravity low in the Canada Basin . Sediments transported from the Mackenzie River Delta would have buried the spreading center. The Chukchi Plateau, which could have been connected to Canada in the vicinity of Ellesmere Island, would have rifted along the spreading center to its current location. A competing hypothesis suggests that the Chukchi Plateau may have once been attached to the Siberian shelf. The Chukchi Plateau also shows substantial evidence of pockmarks, which indicates subsurface hydrocarbon activity.  Law of the sea implications  The Hedberg and Gardiner Lines Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, party states may submit claims to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf to extend its continental shelf beyond the 200-mile buffer that comprises a state‚Äôs exclusive economic zone. This requires that the proposed extension be a natural prolongation of the state‚Äôs continental shelf, which can be concluded through bathymetric mapping and analysis. If a state can prove that a subsea formation is a natural prolongation of its continental shelf, it must consequently locate the foot of the slope, the physical boundary between the natural prolongation and the abyssal plain of the ocean basin. The foot of the slope is then applied to two equations that inform the claim made by a state for the legal extension of its continental shelf. The first equation calculates the Hedberg Line, which is derived by adding 60 nautical miles to the foot of the slope of the natural prolongation. The second yields the Gardiner Line, which refers to the point at which the measurement of subsea sediment thickness is 1% of the distance back to the foot of the slope. The two formulae for deriving these values can be substituted in order to form a composite continental shelf for a coastal state that yields the most advantageous possible maritime territory extension. The United States has not ratified UNCLOS, although there is a concerted, bipartisan effort in Congress and among the various branches of the United States Military to do so. On May 10, 2013, the Obama White House released the National Strategy for the Arctic Region, which supported ratification of the treaty. Alt URL If the United States were to accede to UNCLOS, they would accrue the exclusive rights to exploit the natural resources on and under the continental shelf. Some potentially extractable resources include manganese and metallic sulfides, oil, gas and gas hydrates, and sedentary species such as mollusks and clams.  USCGC Healy expeditions  USCGC Healy Since 2003, USCGC Healy has undertaken eight expeditions to the Chukchi Sea with researchers from the Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping/Joint Hydrographic Center at the University of New Hampshire and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The cruises investigated the bathymetry of the Chukchi Borderlands in order to inform discourse involving the potential ratification of UNCLOS by the U.S. The latest cruise (HEALY-1202), lasting from 25 August to 27 September 2012, traversed 11,965 km of the Arctic Ocean and mapped about 68,600 km2 of the seafloor. The Healy was equipped with multi-beam sonar devices and seismic measurement devices, and was manned by a 34-person scientific party and around 100 US Coast Guardsmen. The expedition collected 10,030 km (5,416 nm) of multi-beam sonar data. HEALY-1202 began in Barrow, Alaska, reached a northernmost point of 83¬∞ 32‚Äô N, 162¬∞ 36‚Äô W, and culminated in Dutch Harbor, Alaska. Prior to the Healy cruises, the foot of the slope of the US continental shelf was believed to lie at the margin of the Chukchi Plateau. The cruises revealed that the foot of the slope was significantly further north at 81¬∞ 15‚Äô N and a depth of approximately 3,800 m‚Äìthe boundary of the Northern Chukchi Borderland with the Nautilus Basin. Voyage of the USCGC Healy and the Chukchi cap In 2011 scientists aboard sea vessel, Marcus G. Langseth, ran tests to increase understanding of the geology, structure and history of the continental shelves running underwater off Asia and North America, and the Chukchi Borderland, an adjoining region of dramatic deep-sea plateaus and ridges some 800 miles from the North Pole. One test includes sending sound pulses to the seabed and reading the echoes.blogs.ei.columbia.edu  References  Category:Oceanic plateaus Category:Landforms of the Arctic Ocean Category:Landforms of the Chukchi Sea Category:Plateaus of Asia Category:Plateaus of North America Category:Arctic Ocean ","title":"Chukchi Plateau"},{"id":"40950156","text":"Godbless Jonathan Lema (born 26 October 1976) is a Tanzanian Chadema politician and Member of Parliament for Arusha City constituency from 2010 to 2015.

One project often called \\"public philosophy\\" is to address issues of public importance through philosophy, especially in the areas of public policy, morality and social issues. In this conception, public philosophy is a matter of content, not style. It must concern certain philosophical issues, but may be undertaken in any venue. The second project often called public philosophy is to engage in philosophy in public venues. This view is exemplified by the Essays in Philosophy special issue on public philosophy (Volume 15, issue 1, 2014), which defined public philosophy as \\"doing philosophy with general audiences in a non-academic setting\\". Public philosophy, in this conception, is a matter of style not content. It must be undertaken in a public venue but might deal with any philosophical issue. Some public philosophers are academic professionals, but others may work outside of the usual academic contexts of teaching and writing for peer-reviewed journals. Perspectives According to one of the founders of the Public Philosophy Network, Sharon Meagher, ‚Äú'public philosophy' is not simply a matter of doing philosophy in public. A truly public philosophy is one that demands that the philosopher both become a student of community knowledge and reflect on his or her public engagement, recognizing that philosophy can benefit at as much from public contact as can the public benefit from contact with philosophy. The publicly engaged philosopher does not assume that he or she knows the questions in advance, but draws on his or her experiences in the community to develop and frame questions. Further, publicly engaged philosophy demands accountability on the part of the philosopher to his or her publics‚Äîunderstanding that philosophers are themselves members of those publics.\\"http://api.ning.com/files/C*75Xw4bA4cU7vHOHS- zlLRmkdBskXa9IzuVBCJKtjhmSgMrQy8tWTu1s9vqumPuG2gyJfaPzwWJ1Tu4*NoJIUVYUXtPpC37/KetteringreportfinalcorrectedFeb2013.pdf Philosophers who hold the alternative view, that public philosophy is simply philosophy undertaken in public venues, are engaged in two projects. One of these is to educate the public and the other to engage with the public collaboratively to identify and address public problems. The second approach is often inspired by John Dewey's work on democracy and the need to reconstruct philosophy.See part two of Volume I of The Essential Dewey: Pragmatism, Education, Democracy edited by Larry A Hickman and Thomas M. Alexander, Bloomington: Indiana University Press. The two approaches are not exclusive. For instance, philosopher Michael J. Sandel describes public philosophy as having two aspects. The first is to \\"find in the political and legal controversies of our day an occasion for philosophy\\". The second is \\"to bring moral and political philosophy to bear on contemporary public discourse.\\" James Tully says, \\"The role of a public philosophy is to address public affairs\\", but this \\"can be done in many different ways.\\" Tully's approach emphasizes practice through the contestable concepts of citizenship, civic freedom, and nonviolence.James Tully, especially Chapter 9 \\"On local and global citizenship: an apprenticeship manual,\\" Public Philosophy in a New Key, Volume II: Imperialism and Civic Freedom. Ideas in Context series. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. pp. 243-309. Public philosophy, in some conceptions, is a matter of content rather than style. Public philosophy, in this sense, need not be undertaken in a public venue but must deal with a particular subset of philosophical problems. Public philosophers The American Philosophical Association created a Committee on Public Philosophy in 2007.http://www.apaonline.org/members/group.aspx?id=110441 Also the Public Philosophy Network has been holding conferences once every two years on advancing public philosophy.http://publicphilosophynetwork.ning.com/ A variety of individuals have been identified, either by themselves or others, as public philosophers. These include academics such as Cornel West, J√ºrgen Habermas, Martha Nussbaum, Richard Rorty, and James Tully, and non-academics such as social activist Jane Addams and novelist Ayn Rand.

History  Francis Greville owned the Clutton Collieries which were part of the Somerset Coalfield and many of his workers lived in Clutton. Local residents had organised and signed a petition pressing him to supply suitable accommodation for the miners. As Francis was anxious that his miners \\"should be able to get to work as dry as possible\\", he had a row of cottages built to accommodate them on Greyfield Colliery Road near the pit.High Littleton & Hallatrow History and Parish Records ‚Äî written and transcribed by Michael L. Browning In 1900 the cottages were completed and named after Maynard Greville, his 4th child, and colloquially known as Maynard's Terrace. Over time, the road name changed to Maynard Terrace. The Earl's wife was Daisy Greville. She is usually best known as a long term mistress of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, who later became King Edward VII and the inspiration behind the song Daisy, Daisy. However, she was also a staunch supporter of social reform and had a keen interest in the welfare of her husband‚Äôs employees and the children of Clutton. Both she and her husband were frequent visitors to Clutton. In 1902 she laid the foundation stone of the current village primary school and officially opened the school in 1903. Her school opening speech was reported in the Somerset Guardian and Radstock Observer. The report noted that she personally donated ¬£5 to the school library and suggested that the building should be put to useful purpose in the evenings both social and recreative. It was her wish to see \\"the mining element represented on the managing authority of the school seeing that the majority of the children will come from that class of parent\\".5 Arches ‚Äî Radstock, Midsomer Norton & District Mining Society Issue number 26 Summer 1996 Image of Maynard Terrace from 2011. Maynard Terrace is bounded on one side by a disused railway siding that linked the Earl's Greyfield Colliery with the now disused Clutton mainline railway station, and on the other side by a set of fields containing historic bell pits. Mining in Clutton was first reported in 1610. The engines used to move the coal along the siding were named Francis and Daisy, after the Earl and his wife.

Cultural heritage can be subdivided into two main types‚Äîtangible and intangible heritage. The former includes built heritage such as religious buildings, museums, monuments, and archaeological sites, as well as movable heritage such as works of art and manuscripts. Intangible cultural heritage includes customs, music, fashion and other traditions within a particular culture. This article mainly deals with the destruction of built heritage; the destruction of movable collectible heritage is dealt with in art destruction, whilst the destruction of movable industrial heritage remains almost totally ignored. Deliberate and systematic destruction of cultural heritage, such as that carried out by ISIL and other terrorist organizations, is regarded as a form of cultural genocide.  Afghanistan  One of the Buddhas of Bamiyan, which were destroyed by the Taliban in 2001 * During the Soviet invasion, large-scale looting occurred in various archaeological sites including Hadda, ancient site of Ai-Khanoum, the Buddhist monastery complex in Tepe Shortor which dates back to the 2nd century AD, and the National Kabul Museum. These sites were ransacked by various pillagers, including the pro-Russian government forces, destitute villagers, and the local crime rings. The National Museum of Afghanistan suffered the greatest damage, in which the systematic looting has plundered the museum collection and the adjacent Archaeological Institute. As a result, more than two-thirds of one hundred thousand pieces of museum treasures and artifacts were lost or destroyed. * A pair of 6th-century monumental statues known as the Buddhas of Bamiyan were dynamited by the Taliban in 2001, who had declared them heretical idols.

Afterward, the government engaged in a full-scale detatarization campaign to continue the ethnic cleansing campaign, all the Tatar placenames being replaced with Russian ones, and the Muslim graveyards and religious objects were destroyed or converted into secular places. * With the change in values imposed by communist ideology, the tradition of preservation was broken. Independent preservation societies, even those that defended only secular landmarks such as Moscow-based OIRU were disbanded by the end of the 1920s. A new anti-religious campaign, launched in 1929, coincided with collectivization of peasants; destruction of churches in the cities peaked around 1932. A number of churches were demolished, including the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow and St. Michael's Cathedral in Izhevsk. Both of these were rebuilt in the 1990s and 2000s. * In 1959 Nikita Khrushchev launched his anti-religious campaign. By 1964 over 10 thousand churches out of 20 thousand were shut down (mostly in rural areas) and many were demolished. Of 58 monasteries and convents operating in 1959, only sixteen remained by 1964; of Moscow's fifty churches operating in 1959, thirty were closed and six demolished.  Spain  * Because of the Ecclesiastical confiscations of Mendiz√°bal, secularization of church properties in 1835‚Äì1836, several hundreds of church buildings, monasteries, etc., or civil buildings owned by the Church were partly or totally demolished. Many of the art works, libraries and archives contained were lost or pillaged in the time the buildings were abandoned and without owners. Among them were important buildings as Santa Caterina convent (the first gothic building in Iberian Peninsula) and Sant Francesc convent (gothic too, one of the richest in the country), both in Barcelona, or San Pedro de Arlanza Roman monastery, near Burgos, now ruined. * Several monuments demolished in Calatayud: the church of Convent of Dominicos of San Pedro M√°rtir (1856), Convent of Trinidad (1856), Church of Santiago (1863), Church of San Torcuato and Santa Luc√≠a (1869) and Church of San Miguel (1871). * The leaning Torre Nueva in Zaragoza was demolished in 1892 amidst fears that it would topple. * Churches, monasteries, convents and libraries were destroyed during the Spanish Civil War.

A few fragments of the structure still survive in situ. * The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, another Wonder of the Ancient World, was destroyed by a series of earthquakes between the 12th and 15th centuries. Most of the remaining marble blocks were burnt into lime, but some were used in the construction of Bodrum Castle by the Knights Hospitaller, where they can still be seen today. The only other surviving remains of the mausoleum are some foundations in situ, a few sculptures in the British Museum, and some marble blocks which were used to build a dockyard in Malta's Grand Harbour. * During the Armenian Genocide and its aftermath, the abandonment and confiscation of Armenian monasteries and cultural heritage in places such as Ani contributed to their eventual destruction. In 1974, UNESCO stated that after 1923, out of 913 Armenian historical monuments left in Eastern Turkey, 464 had vanished completely, 252 were in ruins, and 197 were in need of repair.

It was part of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of World War I. The Jifkafa well (Bir el Jifjafa) is located in the Sinai Desert to the east of Ismalia on the Suez Canal. The raid was carried out by men from the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, supported by small detachments of other corps and a larger group from the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps. Although some of the Australians had seen action in the Gallipoli Campaign, this was the first offensive operation, conducted by any Australian force, during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. The raid was a complete success for the British. For the cost of one man killed, the first light horse casualty of the campaign, they killed six men, captured another thirty-six, and destroyed the well's infrastructure. The raiders returned safely to their own lines. In recognition of their achievement, Major William Henry Scott the commander of the raid was invested as a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order. Background Bir el Jifjafa or the Jifjafa well is located on the central of three traditional routes crossing the Sinai Desert. Its east of Ismalia on the Suez Canal,Gullet, p.71 about midway between there and Magdhaba, which is near the Egyptian-Palestine border.Woodfin p.xviii The central crossing which winds its way across the mountains, to the well which is at an altitude of , was the most likely route used in antiquity to cross the desert.Gullet, p.44 In January 1916, British agents reported there was a Turkish force of around 25,000 in the Sinai, which reinforced the British high command's belief that a Turkish attempt to attack the Suez Canal was imminent.Gullet, p.47 Aerial reconnaissance seemed to confirm the information, reporting Beersheba was a large encampment where the Turkish Army was already digging trenches and other defences.Gullet, p.48 Following reports from the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and agents of a Turkish post being established at the Jifjafa well Brigadier- General John Antill commanding the 3rd Light Horse Brigade was ordered to send a unit to verify the information. They were tasked to destroy the two wells, which were believed to be defended by heavy guns, and if possible capture the position. Secondary they were to report on any other wells or water in the region. Any defensive works established or being built. Any other information of military value and finally capture if possible enemy personnel or inhabitants. The force would be commanded by Major William Henry Scott, the second-in-command of the 9th Light Horse Regiment (9th LHR). With him in the forces headquarters was Captain Macaulay, a General Staff Officer belonging to the 2nd Australian Division. Captain Albert Ernest Wearne, of the 8th Light Horse Regiment (8th LHR), Captain Ayris, from the Headquarters 3rd Light Horse Brigade. The 9th LHR and 8th LHR provided the fighting component, of another eight officers and 122 men. Supporting them the ANZAC Mounted Division provided the engineers, one officer and eight men. The Royal Flying Corps, provided a ground signals unit of two officers and two men. Radio communications were provided by a Royal Engineers Wireless Section of one officer and eight men. Medical support was from the 3rd Light Horse Field Ambulance, one officer and eight men. Additional transport capacity came from the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps (ECTC), one officer, thirty-one Light Horseman drivers and ninety-five Egyptian drivers. The Australian Army Service Corps provided an officer to assist with supply. To protect the ECTC the Bikanir Camel Corps provided one officer and twenty-four men. There was also two guides and an Arabic interpreter. Comprising a total force of eighteen officers, 302 men, 175 horses and 261 camels.Darley, pp.37‚Äì38 The Australians and New Zealanders had carried out some reconnaissance patrols in the desert, but this would be their first offensive action. A second RFC reconnaissance, on 9 April, reported that Jifjafa may have been evacuated, as no men were seen but tents and equipment were still in place. Further intelligence reported Turkish garrisons in that area as 900 men at Hassana, fifty men at Bir el Hamma, and 200 men at Nekhel. Raid=Approach Australian Light Horse in 1916 Scott's force left the on the raid just after 14:00 11 April 1916. Adopting the normal cavalry or mounted force procedure they rode for fifty minutes then, to rest their mounts, walked for the next ten minutes every hour. They rested at 17:00 to feed the animals, starting out again at 19:30, they eventually halted that night at the Wady um Muksheib at 22:30. The next day the force started out at 07:30 heading for a known water source, reconnoitred earlier in the year by a patrol from the ANZAC Mounted Division. The horse mounted troops arrived there at 11:20, but the slower camels did not arrive for another two hours. While waiting for the camels, patrols were sent out to look for signs of any Bedouin activity and water sources. The force set out again this time on a bearing of north-north-east, until coming to a halt at 02:30 13 April from the well. This camp would be their forward operating base where the Royal Engineers Wireless Section and the camel transport would wait, while the light-horsemen carried out the attack. The raiding force left three hours later reaching Hill 1082 at 07:30. Here they halted waiting for a RFC reconnaissance aircraft to check the well. The aircraft appeared thirty minutes later and dropped a message saying the way ahead was clear. During this period the force also, in connection with the secondary part of their orders located several sources of water, in the region of . Setting out again the raiding force established their base at Hill 1080, just out of view of the Jifjafa well. The RFC reconnaissance had reported that the wells inhabitants took cover whenever an aircraft appeared. So it was believed a hostile force still occupied the well and the attack was planned for the next day, 13 April at 09:00. Assault Turkish troops in the Sinai, this image dates to 1915 but their uniform and equipment is what the wells defenders would be equipped with. This position allowed Scott to carry out a close reconnaissance of the Turkish positions using field glasses and he was able to plan his assault. One troop would move to a position north-west of the well. Another troop would move around to the southwest of the well. A third troop would position itself to the south of the well, While the fourth troop would carry out a frontal assault, supported by a machine-gun section, from their present position. Four men of the assault troop were detached to protect the engineers and another four for the machine-gun section.Gullet, p.72 When the assault began a Turkish sentry on seeing them, withdrew back to the well. the rest of the wells defenders evacuated the position, some headed for the hills and others south- east away from the well. Those that headed to the hills were cut off by the troop positioned there, and all the fighting took place. During which six Turkish soldiers were killed, and five wounded. Afterwards several prisoner were taken, which included an Austrian Engineer officer and 34 soldiers. The Austrian officer revealed that the Turkish garrison consisted of one Turkish officer, 25 soldiers and 15 men from the Turkish labour corps. The soldiers belonging to the 2nd Company, 4th Battalion, 79th Regiment. So the attack had dealt with the entire garrison less two men who were observed to have ridden off towards the east. Casualties for the raiding force were one man and a horse killed. The first light horse casualty in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. The well consisted of three bore holes, and water abstraction equipment, which was destroyed. As well as other equipment and supplies stored around the camp. Including 4,000 rounds of small arms ammunition. When the raiding force examined the Turkish defences, they located three trench systems, which had not yet been finished, and a concrete emplacement designed for an anti-aircraft gun. At 12:00 the raiding force, covered by a rear guard, started back toward the Suez Canal. Making frequent stops to accommodate the camels they halted for the night at 22:30. The next day, 14 April, the raiding force returned safely to their own lines. Aftermath Several men who participated on the raid were mentioned in dispatches in Scott's report. For his own leadership skills Scott became a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order. The citation reading \\"For conspicuous ability and good work. He led a small column to reconnoitre a distant enemy post, attacked it, killed several of the enemy, and brought in thirty-eight prisoners, including the officer in command. His plans were so well laid that he effected this with the loss of only one man and one horse\\". The details of the raid, although for the time a minor event, was also published In the London Times, and the New York Times.

Zemor, who is Jewish, maintains that Israel seeks the extinction of the Palestinian people and that it denies Palestinians their human rights. She has been denied entry into Israel for security reasons on several occasions. Zemor is of Turkish and Algerian ancestry. Career=Journalism From 1980 to 1989, Zemor worked as a journalist for Agence France-Presse. She later founded APM International, a news agency that was bought by Reuters in 1999. Activism=Founding of EuroPalestine In 2002, the couple founded EuroPalestine, which describes itself as being engaged in consciousness- raising activities which seek to enlighten the media, politicians, and the general public about the purported denial of rights and justice to the Palestinian people, and the need to impose sanctions on Israel in order to compel it to respect international law. Librarie R√©sistances Zemor and Shahshahani also own a Paris bookstore called Librarie R√©sistances. It is the site of many EuroPalestine meetings and events. 2004 European Parliament elections In the 2004 European Parliament elections, EuroPalestine ran a slate of 28 candidates in one French district, Ile-de-France, with Zemor at No. 4 on the list, following a surgeon, Christophe Oberlin, who ‚Äúregularly conducts missions to Gaza,‚Äù at #1, and anti-Semitic comedian Dieudonne M‚ÄôBala at #2. Reportedly, the Palestinian Delegate General to France, Leila Shahid, was ‚Äúshocked‚Äù by the extremism of some of EuroPalestine's candidates. According to a Brookings Institution report, EuroPalestine's list ‚Äúonly received 50,000 votes overall (or 1.83 percent), far short of the number required to secure representative in Brussels, but it did much better in certain area of Ile-de-France, at times surpassing the Greens and the Communist Party in poor neighborhoods with a strong Arab presence. In its best showings, the Euro-Palestine got 10.75 percent in the small city of Garges- les-Goness (Val d‚ÄôOise, D√©partment 95); 8.1 percent in Villetaneuse (Seine- Saint-Denis, D√©partment 93), 19 percent in the Val-Fourre neighborhood in the Yvelines (D√©partment 78), famous for urban unrest and riots in the 1990s and again in 2005; and 20.33 percent in the Luth neighborhood in the Genevilliers (Hauts-de-Sein, D√©partment 92).‚Äù Ariel Sharon's 2005 visit to France After the French Minister of Foreign Relations announced that Ariel Sharon would be visiting France in April 2004, EuroPalestine launched a campaign protesting the visit. Sharon's trip was cancelled. In Zemor's view, however, ‚Äúthe French government kept making concessions to Israel‚Äù and Nicolas Sarkozy, Jean-Pierre Raffarin and Michel Barnier were ‚Äúastonishingly submissive to Israel and its Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who did not miss a chance to insult France and the French.‚Äù She accused the French government of having a ‚Äúdouble standard,‚Äù in that it ‚Äúsupports the creation of a Palestine State and welcomes a dying Arafat‚Äù but also ‚Äúencourages Israel‚Äôs colonial and annexation policy.‚Äù Chirac then invited Sharon to come to France following the 2005 Bastille Day celebrations. Zemor organized a large demonstration against the visit that took place in Paris on July 9, 2005. In an interview a few days before the protest, she complained that the French media were pro-Israel, saying that even ‚Äúnewspapers that define themselves as 'progressive', such as Le Monde and Lib√©ration,...refuse to give space to Israelis such as Tanya Reinhart, Emmanuel Farjoun and Ilan Ppappe, who openly oppose Israel‚Äôs colonial policy,‚Äù or to cover abuses committed by ‚Äúfar-right Zionist groups like Betar and the Jewish Defense League.‚Äù She further charged that ‚Äúpro- Israeli pressure groups in France‚Äù have support in the media and government. She also maintained that Israel ‚Äúwants the war to be extended in Iraq, Iran, Syria and Lebanon so that it can go on with the elimination of as many Palestinians as possible.‚Äù 2009 video about Israel In a YouTube video that was uploaded in 2009, Zemor complained about the harassment and character defamation she claims to have endured at the hands of the Israelis. 2009 About Hamas In 2009, Zemor added her name, on behalf of EuroPalestine, to a list of those calling for Hamas to be removed from the European Union Terror List. The campaign was initiated by Nadine Rosa-Rosso, a self-proclaimed ‚Äúcommunist militant.‚Äù 2010 expulsion from Israel In December 2010, Zemor was taken into custody upon arrival at Ben Gurion airport. After being interrogated and detained, she was told that she would be expelled from Israel because of her organization of demonstrations in France. Zemor protested that she defends ‚Äúideas of peace and justice‚Äù and asked: ‚ÄúIn what way do my activities in France have anything to do with you?‚Äù She was then driven in a police van to a detention center at the airport, where her belongings were confiscated. Some time later she was taken to board a plane. Her request to see a lawyer was denied, and she was handcuffed. ‚ÄúCarried by four policemen,‚Äù she later wrote, ‚ÄúI arrive at the top of the gangway of a Turkish Airline plane that is ready to take off. The passengers are already seated. I scream that I refuse to get into the plane. I struggle. The crew refuse to force me to board the plane. I am returned to the detention center.‚Äù She was placed in solitary confinement and visited by the French Vice-Consul. Eventually she boarded a plane for Istanbul. 2011 court appearance In June 2011, Zemor was ordered to appear before a Paris court for publishing a BDS video against Israel on the website of EuroPalestine. The video features pro-Palestinian activists dancing in a supermarket in √âvry, near Paris, wearing T-shirts with pro-BDS slogans on them. Zemor claimed in her defense that she was not actually in the video, but had only published it on the internet. Zemor was charged by the government and four Israeli associations, including the Israeli Chamber of Commerce, with discrimination against the Israeli nation and incitement to racial hatred, but was acquitted on July 8. Ruling that it is not illegal in France to call for a boycott of Israeli products, the court wrote that ‚ÄúCriticism of a State or its policies cannot be regarded, in principle, as infringing the rights or dignity of its nationals, without seriously affecting freedom of expression.‚Äù On May 24, 2012, however, the Cour de Cassation (France's Supreme Court) ruled that calls to boycott Israeli products constitute discrimination and are thus illegal. The French Appeals Court, moreover, found Zemor guilty of ‚Äúprovoking hatred or violence against a group of people, Israeli producers, because they belong to a particular nation, the State of Israel.‚Äù Specifically, the Appeals Court found that ‚Äúin choosing to distribute outrageous remarks, and most notably the declaration that buying an Israeli product amounts to killing a Palestinian child with a bullet, Zemor incited hatred and violence.‚Äù Zemor was compelled to pay a one- euro fine to the National Bureau of Vigilance Against Anti-Semitism (BNCVA), and to cover 1500 euros in legal fees. 2012 JDL attack On June 28, 2012, Zemor was attacked at a caf√© in Bastille by members of the Jewish Defense League who struck her in the head and sprayed her in the face with toxic oil paint. Denied entry into Israel On at least three occasions, in July 2011, April 2012 and August 2012, Zemor has attempted to enter Israel and has been denied entry. On July 8, 2011, Zemor led a large group of Frenchmen who were scheduled to carry out a ‚Äúflytilla‚Äù from Paris to Tel Aviv on their way to Bethlehem to take part in the ‚ÄúWelcome to Palestine‚Äù initiative, a campaign to protest Israeli policies and demonstrate solidarity with the Palestinians. However, Zemor, along with her followers, was barred from boarding a flight to Tel Aviv at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, because her name was on a list of ‚Äúundesirable people‚Äù that had been circulated to the airlines by the Israeli government. Accusing Israel of abusing its power and declaring that ‚ÄúRoissy-Charles de Gaulle is under Israeli occupation,‚Äù Zemor led her colleagues in a protest at the airport. ‚ÄúThis is a total circus by the Israeli authorities, who are painting us as criminals, who think we will hijack the plane and go to Gaza,‚Äù Zemor told the media. Insisting that her group planned only nonviolent activities, she later released a statement calling the moves to prevent activists from reaching Israel ‚Äúprovocative, blackmailing and illegal.‚Äù In April 2012 Zemor was again prohibited from flying to Tel Aviv. Leading a group of Frenchmen who were headed to Israel to participate in the second ‚ÄúWelcome to Palestine‚Äù initiative, she managed to fly from Paris to Istanbul but was prevented, along with her contingent, from boarding the connecting flight to Tel Aviv. ‚ÄúWelcome to Palestine‚Äù organizers had expected approximately 2,000 activists to take part in the campaign, but only hundreds made it to Ben Gurion, and only an estimated 12 persons actually made it to Bethlehem. ‚ÄúWe have been squatting here to protest and to get our money back,‚Äù Zemor told a reporter in Istanbul. ‚ÄúWe wanted a piece of paper stating that we were denied boarding, and we finally got it,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúNow we are asking Turkish Airlines to pay our return ticket.‚Äù She added that ‚ÄúI think the Israeli government is just crazy because it would have been easy to let us go to Bethlehem,‚Äù where, she claimed, the group had planned to build a school and participate in other such activities. Although Israeli police described the ‚ÄúWelcome to Palestine‚Äù activists as hostile and provocative, Zemor said that her fellow participants were not activists but were simply people aged from nine to 83 who opposed the occupation, among them her 23-year-old daughter Adele. ‚ÄúThey want a free Palestine. They want Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace with equal rights,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey have wanted to meet Palestinians and to go to Palestine to tell them they support their struggle for freedom, but they were scared to do it alone.‚Äù In August 2012 Zemor and around 100 other anti-Israel activists tried to enter the West Bank via Jordan. The group tried to travel across King Hussein bridge, but were stopped at an Israeli checkpoint. ‚ÄúWe were on two buses,‚Äù Zemor told a reporter. ‚ÄúThey took all passports and stamped 'rejected' for everyone, without questioning or even inspecting the things we have. They did not even allow the second bus to reach the checkpoint. They sent them back immediately.‚Äù She added that ‚ÄúIf Israel prevents us from entering, they need to say why. Is it because we are not agreeing with [Israeli Prime Minister] Netanyahu's policy?‚Äù In addition, she said, ‚ÄúConsidering the way Israel treats the Palestinians, we are not surprised. Israel claims to be the only democracy in the region, but in fact it is only a prison, where even visitors are not allowed to enter.‚Äù Zemor told reporters in Amman that her group had planned ‚Äúto deliver 1 ton of school supplies to Palestinian children in refugee camps in Bethlehem. In a statement, Israel‚Äôs Defense Ministry denounced her and her protesters as ‚Äò‚Äòprovocateurs and known troublemakers‚Äù and called their effort a ‚Äò‚Äòfailed publicity stunt.‚Äô‚Äô The Defense Ministry explained that Israel exercised its right to deny them entry. ‚Äò‚ÄòThere are no restrictions whatsoever on bringing in school supplies,‚Äô‚Äô the statement said. ‚Äò‚ÄòIf these activists sincerely wanted to bring in school supplies, they had countless options to do so. There are no shortages of school supplies in the West Bank\\". December 2012 Gaza visit Zemor led a group of about 100 EuroPalestine members who were hosted by Hamas officials during a visit to the Gaza Strip on December 27, 2012. The EuroPalestine members had entered the Gaza Strip via the Rafah crossing and sought to break what they described as the ‚Äúillegal siege of the Gaza Strip.‚Äù Headed by Zemor, the group held a display near the border fence and promised to promote Hamas's political agenda in France and elsewhere. They also met with senior PFLP officials and with representatives of other terrorist organizations. Zemor said the purpose of the visit was to send the message to the international community that Israel's ‚Äúsiege‚Äù of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank was illegal and had to be reversed. Zemor and her colleagues were also taken on Hamas-organized visits to the Al-Shifaa hospital and various places that had been the targets of IDF attacks during Operation Pillar of Defense, which Zemor and her colleagues described as indicative of Israel‚Äôs determination ‚Äúto damage the civilian infrastructure.‚Äù 2013 UEFA protest Zemor led a group of EuroPalestine members who occupied the Union of European Football Association (UEFA) offices in Switzerland in January 2013. She met with UEFA president Michel Platini, telling him that UEFA was ‚Äúencouraging war crimes‚Äù by choosing Israel to host the eight-nation event in June, and that it as a ‚Äúshame to grant Israel this honor.‚Äù After Zemor and her colleagues left, Platini cited a letter he had recently received from the president of the Palestinian football association, Jibril Rajoub, thanking him for his support in getting young men released from prison. ‚ÄúThe people that came here today were not fully aware of what we do.‚Äù Condamnation in Court On May 28, 2015, Zemor has been condemned by a French high court (Cour d'appel de Paris) as ¬´ guilty of provoking hate against a group, the Israeli producers, because they belong to a nation, the State of Israel.¬ªSee lemondejuif.info (french).

There are some similarities and differences between the two religions. Temples, gods, rituals, fasts and other religious components of Jainism are different from those of Hinduism. \\"Jain\\" is derived from the word Jina, referring to a human being who has conquered all inner passions (like anger, attachment, greed and pride) and possesses Kevala Jnana (pure infinite knowledge). Followers of the path shown by the Jinas are called Jains. Followers of Hinduism are called Hindus.  Philosophical similarities and differences  Jainism and Hinduism have many similar characteristic features, including the concepts of samsara, karma and moksha. However, they differ over the precise nature and meaning of these concepts. The doctrine of Jainism has minor similarities with the Nyaya- Vaisheshika and samkhya school. The Jain doctrine teaches atomism which is also found in the Vaisheshika system and atheism which is found in Samkhya. Within the doctrine of Jainism, there exist many metaphysical concepts which are not known in Hinduism, some of which are dharma and Adharma tattva (which are seen as substances within the Jain metaphysical system), Gunasthanas and Lesyas. The epistemological concepts of Anekantavada and Syadvada are not found in the Hindu system. There were, in the past, attempts made to merge the concepts of Hindu gods and the Tirthankara of Jainism. The cosmography of Hindus resembles that of the Jains and there are similar names of heavenly gods within these systems. In the Upanishads, there also occur the first statements of the view, dominant in Jainist teachings and elsewhere, that rebirth is undesirable and that it is possible by controlling or stopping one's actions to put an end to it and attain a state of deliverance (moksha) which lies beyond action. Moksha (liberation)  In Hinduism, moksha means merging of soul with universal soul or eternal being and escaping the cycle of births and deaths; in Jainism, it is action-less and peaceful existence. In Vedic philosophy or Sanatana Dharma, salvation is giving up the sense of being a doer and realizing Self to be the same as Universe and God. In Jainism, salvation can be achieved only through self-effort and is considered to be the right of human beings. In Jainism, one definite path to attain liberation (moksha) is prescribed. The prescribed threefold path consists of the three jewels of Jainism (Right belief, Right knowledge, Right conduct). In Hinduism, no one definite path to salvation is prescribed.  Universe  According to Jain cosmology, the universe is eternal, it is neither created nor it can be destroyed. In Hinduism, it is believed to by a creator, and destroyed by God, to be created again.  Karma  Karma is an invisible force in Hinduism, whereas in Jainism it is a form of matter which can stick to the soul.  Worship  In Hinduism, Gods are worshiped in several ways and for several reasons such as knowledge, peace, wisdom, health, and it also believed to be one's duty to pray god as God is considered as our maker (as we originated from them and we are staying in them and at last will merge with them), for moksham (by attaining moksham we can join him and escape this Maya or dualistic nature which makes us think that we are different from the universal soul) and are also offered food as a respect, etc. In Jainism, the siddhas represent the true goal of all human beings, their qualities are worshiped by the Jains.  Self-defence and soldiering  Jains agree with Hindus that violence in self-defence can be justified,Nisithabhasya (in Nisithasutra) 289; Jinadatta Suri: Upadesharasayana 26; Dundas pp. 162‚Äì163; T√§htinen p. 31. and they agree that a soldier who kills enemies in combat is performing a legitimate duty.Jindal pp. 89‚Äì90; Laidlaw pp. 154‚Äì155; Jaini, Padmanabh S.: Ahimsa and \\"Just War\\" in Jainism, in: Ahimsa, Anekanta and Jainism, ed. Tara Sethia, New Delhi 2004, p. 52‚Äì60; T√§htinen p. 31. Jain communities accepted the use of military power for their defence, there were Jain monarchs, military commanders, and soldiers.Harisena, Brhatkathakosa 124 (10th century); Jindal pp. 90‚Äì91; Sangave p. 259.  Women  The religion of Jains included women in their fourfold sangha; the religious order of Jain laymen, laywomen, monks and nuns. There was a disagreement between early Hinduism, and ascetic movements such as Jainism with the scriptural access to women. However, the early svetambara scriptures prevented pregnant women, young women or those who have a small child, to enter to the ranks of nun. Regardless, the number of nuns given in those texts were always double the number of monks. Parshvanatha and Mahavira, the two historical teachers of Jainism, had large numbers of female devotees and ascetics. Tirthankara Mahavira and Jain monks are credited with raising the status of women.  Religious texts  Hindus do not accept any Jain text and Jains do not recognize any Hindu scripture.  The Vedas  The scriptures known as Vedas are regarded by Hindus as one of the foundations of Hinduism. Those who rejected the Vedas as the prime source of religious knowledge were labeled \\"nƒÅstika\\". As a consequence, Jainism and Buddhism were categorized as nƒÅstika dar≈õana. The orthodox schools of Hinduism, such as Vedanta, Mimamsa and Samkhya, claim the Sruti do not have any author and hence are supreme to other religious scriptures. This position was countered by Jains who said that saying Vedas are authorless was equivalent to saying that anonymous poems are written by nobody. Jain scriptures, on the contrary, were believed by them to be of human origin, brought through omniscient teachers, and hence claimed greater worth. According to Jains, the origin of Vedas lies with Marichi, the son of Bharata Chakravarti, who was the son of the first Tirthankara Rishabha. Jains maintain that these scriptures were later modified. Jains pointed that Hindus do not know their own scriptures since they were unaware of the names of tirthankaras present in Vedas. Jains had a long-standing debate with Mimamsa school of Hinduism. Kumarila Bhatta, a proponent of Mimamsa school, argued that the Vedas are the source of all knowledge and it is through them that humans can differentiate between right and wrong. Jain monks, such as Haribhadra, held that humans are already in possession of all the knowledge, which only needs to be illuminated or uncovered in order to gain the status of omniscience. = Vedic sacrifices = The practice of Vedic animal sacrifices was opposed by Jains. Hemachandra, a Jain monk, cites passages from Manusmriti, one of the law book of Hindus, to demonstrate how, in light of false scriptures, Hindus have resorted to violence. Akalanka, another Jain monk, sarcastically said that if killing can result in enlightenment, one should become a hunter or fisherman. Hindu epics and Jain counter epics The rejection of Hindu epics and scriptures were dominant in Jainism since very early times. The central Hindu scriptures and epics like Vedas, Mahabharata and Ramayana are categorized as false scriptures in Nandi-sutra, one of the svetambara's canonical literature. Later, Jains adapted various Hindu epics in accordance with their own system. There were disputes between Jains and Hindus in form of these epics.  Jain deities and Hindu texts  Within the doctrine of Jainism, the tirthankara holds the highest status. Hemachandra says that a deva (roughly god) is the one who has conquered his internal desires and passions. This requirement, according to him, was fulfilled only by the tirthankara. The gods of Hindus are considered worldly having desires for women and weapons. Hence their path for spiritual upliftment and salvation is rejected by the Jains. Some personage mentioned in the Vedas and Jain scriptures are same. There is mention of the first tirthankara, Rishabhanatha in Rig Veda and Vishnu Purana. Rig Veda, X. 12. 166 states- Vishnu PurƒÅna mentions: :‡§ã‡§∑‡§≠‡•ã ‡§Æ‡§∞‡•Å‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§∂‡•ç‡§ö ‡§ã‡§∑‡§≠‡§æ‡§§ ‡§≠‡§∞‡§§‡•ã ‡§≠‡§µ‡•á‡§§‡•ç :‡§≠‡§∞‡§§‡§æ‡§¶ ‡§≠‡§æ‡§∞‡§§‡§Ç ‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§∑‡§Ç, ‡§≠‡§∞‡§§‡§æ‡§§ ‡§∏‡•Å‡§Æ‡§§‡§ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§≠‡•Ç‡§§‡•ç :Rishabha was born to Marudevi, Bharata was born to Rishabh, :Bharatavarsha (India) arose from Bharata, and Sumati arose from Bharata. ::‚ÄîVishnu Purana (2,1,31) In the Skanda Purana (chapter 37) it is stated that \\"Rishabha was the son of Nabhiraja, and Rishabha had a son named Bharata, and after the name of this Bharata, this country is known as Bharata-varsha.\\" In the \\"Brahmottara-candam\\" section of the Brahma Purana, the narrator Suta describes many matters relating to Shaivism and in the 16th portion, there is a story about Bhadrabahu receiving instructions in a mantra from Rishabha yogi.P. 88, Madras Journal of Literature and Science, Volume 11 By Madras Literary Society and Auxiliary of the Royal Asiatic Society The Linga Purana mentions that in every kali yuga, Lord Shiva has incarnated, and that in one kali yuga he was a Yogeshwara (one of His 28 incarnations) named Rishabha.P. 16 Linga Purana By Vinay. The list is in order is: Shweta, Sutara, Madana, Suhotra, Kanchana, Lokakshee, Jagishavya, Dadhivahana, Rishabha, Muni, Ugra, Atri, Vali, Gautama, Vedashrira, Gokarna, Guhavasi, Shikhandabhriti, Jatamali, Attahasa, Daruka, Langali, Mahakaya, Shuli, Mundishvara, Sahishnu, Somasharma, and Jagadguru. History Jainism is considered by some to be distinct from Vedic religion and from a pre-Aryan tradition viz. Sramana or Aarahata tradition. Ancient Jains and Hindus have coexisted in Tamil country since at least the second century BCE. Medieval Competition between Jains and Brahmans, between Jains and Shaivas, is a frequent motif of all medieval western Indian narratives, but the two communities for the most part coexisted and coprospered. Shaiva kings patronised Jain mendicants, and Jain officials patronised Brahmana poets. Decline of Jainism Around the 8th century CE, Hindu philosopher ƒÄdi ≈öa·πÖkarƒÅcƒÅrya tried to restore the Vedic religion. ≈öa·πÖkarƒÅcƒÅrya brought forward the doctrine of Advaita. The Vaishnavism and Shaivism also began to rise. This was particularly in the southern Indian states. According to a Saivite legend, the Pandya king Koon Pandiyan ordered a massacre of 8,000 Jain monks. This event is depicted graphically in walls of Tivatur in North Arcot. However, this legend is not found in any Jain text, and is believed to be a fabrication made up by the Saivites to prove their dominance. Jains and the Hindu society Jain scholars and some monks in general allowed a sort of cautious integration with the Hindu society. In today's date, there are a lot of common aspects in social and cultural life of Hindus and Jains. It is quite difficult to differentiate a lay Jain from a lay Hindu. The Jain code of conduct is quite similar to that which is found in Hindu Dharmasashtra, Manusmriti and other Law books of Brahmans. Many Jains now worship Hindu gods and celebrate Hindu festivals. The difference in the rituals of practitioners of the two religions would be that the Jains do not give any importance to bathing in holy water. According to religious scholar M. Whitney Kelting, some of the \\"names and narratives\\" in the Hindu's list of satis are also found in the Jain tradition. In the Hindu context, a sati is a virtuous wife who protects her husband and his family and has the \\"intention to die before, or with,\\" her husband. Kelting notes that those satis who die on the funeral pyre of their husband, or who \\"intended to die\\" but were prevented from death, may attain a status called satimata. Kelting says that the Jain tradition, due to principle of non-violence and equanimity, doesn't allow self-immolation. They, instead, see renunciation rather than self-sacrifice as the highest ideal for a Jain sati. Hindus think Jainism is simply another branch of Hinduism. Jain apologist like Champat Rai Jain, held that Hindus are Jaina allegorists who have allegorised the Jain teachings. However, such claims are not supported by historical facts. Hindu revivalism and Indian identities With the onset of British colonialism, select groups of Indians developed responses to the British dominance and the British critique of Hinduism. In this context, various responses toward Jainism developed. =Dayanand Saraswati and the Arya Samaj= The Arya Samaj was founded by Dayanand Saraswati (1824-1883), who \\"was the solitary champion of Vedic authority and infallibility\\". Swami Dayanand Saraswati authored Satyarth Prakash, a book containing the basic teachings of Saraswati and the Arya Samaj. It contains \\"Dayananda's bitter criticisms of the major non-Vedic religions of Indian origins.\\" In the Satyarth Prakash, he writes that he regarded Jainism as \\"the most dreadful religion\\", and that Jains are \\"possessed of defective and childish understanding.\\" A recent strategy, exemplified by Rajiv Malhotra, is the use of the term dharma as a common denominator, which also includes Jainism and Buddhism. Communal harmony Dharmasthala Temple shows the communal harmony between Jains and Hindus, as the priests of the temple are Shivalli Brahmins, who are Vaishnava, and the administration is run by a Jain Bunt family.

Tom Dalgliesh is the owner of Columbia Games and a designer of many wargames and fantasy role playing materials. Biography Dalgliesh began his career playing poker as a midshipman in the British Merchant Navy, then emigrated to Canada in 1967. In 1972, Dalgliesh, Steve Brewster, and Lance Gutteridge formed a new gaming company called Gamma Two Games, which became Columbia Games in 1982. Brewster soon left and Gutteridge departed in the mid-1980s, leaving the company in the hands of Dalgliesh. Dalgliesh's designs, starting with Quebec 1759, include War of 1812, Napoleon, Slapshot, Klondike, Smoker's Wild, Bobby Lee, Sam Grant, Dixie, Eagles, Victory, Pacific Victory, and Liberty. He also co- designed Wizard Kings with his son Grant Dalgliesh, EastFront with Craig Besinque, Hammer of the Scots, Crusader Rex, and Richard III with Jerry Taylor, and Sam Grant, and Shenandoah with Gary Selkirk. Dalgliesh also entered into a partnership with N. Robin Crossby to publish a fantasy game called H√¢rn. Dalgliesh followed what he called a \\"Rolls Royce business strategy\\" for Columbia (with the intention to produce quality product with limited appeal but loyal following), and had to defend Columbia several times over the higher price of the H√¢rn books. Dalgliesh's work on the H√¢rn system includes the sourcebooks Kanday (1986), Kaldor (1986), Azadmere (1986), Melderyn (1987), and Pilots' Almanac (1988). Dalgliesh's company Columbia Games published the original work in 1983, and it has remained continuously in print by that company since then. After a disagreement, this partnership ended and Crossby continued to develop the game without the input of Delgliesh or Columbia Games. Dalgliesh decided to move Columbia Games from Canada into Washington state in 1994; Crossby did not move with the company and afterward stopped producing new material for Columbia. Dalgliesh's War of 1812 in Strategy & Tactics magazine from Decision Games won the 2001 Charles S. Roberts Award for Best Magazine Game. His Hammer of the Scots board game won in the category of best historical simulation in the 2004 Games 100 \\"Top 100 Games of the Year\\" contest. He was chosen by vote as a \\"famous game designer\\" to be featured as the king of clubs in Flying Buffalo's 2014 Famous Game Designers Playing Card Deck.

Briefly, an admission is a statement made by a party, in civil or criminal proceedings, which is adverse to that party's case. Informal admissions, which are usually made out of court, must be distinguished from formal admissions, made in the pleadings or in court. Formal admissions are binding on the maker, and are generally made in order to reduce the number of issues before the court; an informal admission is merely an item of evidence that can be contradicted or explained away. Informal admissions may be admitted to prove the truth of their contents. The rationale for admitting such evidence would appear to be that a person is unlikely to make an admission adverse to his interests if the contents of that admission are not true. Since, however, a statement may constitute an admission even though a party is unaware that what he is saying is contrary to his interests,The test employed in determining whether a statement or conduct constitutes an admission is an objective one. See R v Barlin 1926 AD 459 at 465; S v Grove- Mitchell 1975 (3) SA 417 (A) 420. > [i]t is probably better to say that admissions or confessions do not have > some of the drawbacks inherent in hearsay because a party can hardly > complain that when he made the statement he was not on oath or did not have > an opportunity to cross-examine himself.Zeffertt, Paizes & Skeen 429.See > Randfontein Transitional Council v ABSA Bank Ltd 2000 2 SA 1040 (W). Nevertheless, informal admissions in many instances will be hearsay in nature. Section 3(4) of the Law of Evidence Amendment ActAct 45 of 1988. defines hearsay evidence as ‚Äúevidence, whether oral or in writing, the probative value of which depends upon the credibility of any person other than the person giving such evidence.‚Äù When the probative value of an informal admission depends primarily on its maker (which will almost invariably be the case), it will be a hearsay statement. As, however, section 3 of the Law of Evidence Amendment ActAct 45 of 1988. is ‚Äúsubject to the provisions of any other law,‚Äùs 3(1). existing statutory provisions will remain the primary route to admission, and the common law will remain ‚Äúany other factor‚Äù to be taken into account by the court in the exercise of its discretion to admit hearsay in the interests of justice.s 3(1)(c)(vii). While Paizes also takes the view that section 3(4) brings confessions and admissions within the hearsay rule, and that the probative value of a statement depends on the credibility of its maker,Paizes in Du Toit et al Commentary 24-50J.See Paizes 1985 SALJ 258.See S v Holshauzen 1984 (4) SA 852 (A). he concludes that section 3 does not require any significant departure from the traditional approach to the admission of confessions and admissions, because > the more contentious aspects of the problem of the admissibility of > confessions or admissions are not the concern of s 3. And, since it is > difficult to imagine how the interest of justice could be served by the > exclusion of a relevant, voluntarily made admission or confession which > satisfies the other statutory requirements, it is submitted that subjecting > such evidence to the scrutiny required in s 3 will be a harmless but usually > futile exercise. The hearsay objection will be met, in any event, should the > accused himself testify at his trial.Paizes in Du Toit et al Commentary > 24-50K. Once part of a statement has been allowed into evidence as an admission, the maker is entitled to have the whole statement put before the court, even where it includes self-serving statements,R v Valachia 1945 AD 826.S v Cloete 1994 (1) SACR 420 (A). provided the two components form part of a single statement.R v Vather 1961 (1) SA 350 (A).See also S v Telani 1989 2 SA 43 (A).S v Mkire 1992 (2) SACR 347 (A). An informal admission, which is made extrajudicially, must also be distinguished from a statement made against a party's interest during the course of a trial. The latter is treated as ordinary evidence.  Requirements for Admissibility  In civil matters, there is only one general requirement for admissibility: relevance.In respect of informal admissions, the effect of section 42 of the CPEA is to apply the English law as it was on May 30, 1961. An additional requirement must be met where statements are made in the course of negotiations for the settlement of a dispute, in that such statements cannot be disclosed without the consent of both parties. In criminal matters, an admission must be proved to have been made voluntarily before it can be admitted into evidence.  Admissions by conduct  Admissions may be contained in a verbal or written statement, and may also be inferred from conduct. For example, in S v Sheppard,1966 (4) SA 530 (W). it was held that a party's payment of an invoice was an admission that the services specified in that invoice had been performed. Conduct, however, does not need to be positive if it is to constitute an admission, and an admission may be inferred from silence. The constitutional right to remain silent, and the presumption of innocence, \\"will no doubt severely restrict the inferences that can be drawn from an accused's silence.\\"Schwikkard & Van der Merwe Evidence 307.See also Schwikkard Presumption of Innocence (1999) 118-25.  Admissions by silence  Silence in the face of an accusation may amount to an admission when it forms the basis of a commonsense inference against a party.See Van der Merwe (ed) Evidence 219.See also Elliot (ed) Elliot & Phipson Manual of The Law of Evidence 12 ed (1987) 181 for discussion of the dangers which may arise from drawing ‚Äúcommonsense inferences.‚Äù For example, in Jacobs v Henning,1927 TPD 324. the plaintiff, in bringing an action for damages for seduction, led evidence that the defendant, when confronted and accused by the plaintiff's father of having caused his daughter's pregnancy, remained silent and simply lowered his head. The court found that this conduct was sufficient corroboration of the plaintiff's version. The nature of the inference that can be drawn from silence will always depend on the surrounding circumstances.Elliot Elliot & Phipson 182. In the past, one of the reasons for not readily drawing an inference from the accused's silence was the common-law right to remain silent and the presumption of innocence, which requires the prosecution to make out a prima facie case before there can be any obligation on the accused to speak.R v Weger 1958 (3) SA 467 (G).Gosschalk v Rossouw 1966 (2) SA 476 (C).See also R v Barlin 1926 AD 459. These rights now enjoy protection in the Constitution.s 35(1)(a).s 35(3)(h). The right to remain silent may be described as the absence of a legal obligation to speak.S v Thebus 2003 (2) SACR 319 (CC) para 55.R v Esposito (1985) 49 CR (3d) 193 (Ont CA). Its rationale is three-fold: # concern for reliability (by deterring improper investigation), which relates directly to the truth-seeking function of the court; # a belief that individuals have a right to privacy and dignity, which, while not absolute, may not be lightly eroded; and # the necessity of giving effect to the privilege against self-incrimination and the presumption of innocence.Thebus para 55.See also S v Manamela 2000 (3) SA 1 (CC).Osman v Attorney-General Transvaal 1998 (2) SACR 493 (CC). In the constitutional context, an issue that has been the subject both of nationalSee South African Law Commission, Project 73, Simplification of Criminal Procedure A More Inquisitorial Approach to Criminal Procedure‚ÄîPolice Questioning, Defence Disclosure, the Role of Judicial Officers and Judicial Management of Trials (2002).See also Van Dijkhorst (2001) 118 SALJ 26.Nugent (1999) 116 SALJ 501.Schwikkard \\"Silence and Common Sense\\" (2003) Acta Juridica 92. and of internationalSee, for example, Easton The Case for the Right to Silence 2 ed (1998).See also Dennis ‚ÄúSilence in the Police Station: The Marginalisation of Section 34‚Äù [2002] Criminal Law Review 25.Jackson, Wolfe & Quinn Legislating Against Silence: The Northern Ireland Experience (2000). debate is whether or not a negative inference may be drawn from an accused's election to exercise his right to remain silent. Although the issue of a negative inference will arise only at the trial stage, there are significant policy issues differentiating silence prior to trial from silence at trial. At common law, the right to remain silent prohibited a court from drawing adverse inferences from silence at the investigative stage of the proceedings. If, however, an alibi defence is raised for the first time at trial, then the court, in determining whether the alibi is reasonably possibly true, may take into account, in terms of the common law, that there has been no opportunity for the state to investigate the alibi properly.R v Mashele 1944 AD 571.S v Zwayi 1997 (2) SACR 772 (Ck). The constitutionality of the common-law approach to the late disclosure of an alibi was considered by the Constitutional Court in S v Thebus, where the court also applied its mind to the issue of the permissibility of drawing an adverse inference of guilt from pre-trial silence and the constitutionality of drawing an adverse inference as to the credibility of the accused from pre-trial silence. These issues were raised on appeal by one of two co-accused, whose conviction on a charge of murder and two counts of attempted murder had been confirmed by the Supreme Court of Appeal. On arrest, the accused had been warned of his right to remain silent, but nevertheless elected to make an oral statement in which he described the whereabouts of his family at the time of the shooting. At trial, he testified that this statement had not been intended to include himself. (If it had been, it would have contradicted the details of his alibi defence.) After making this initial oral statement, the accused refused to make a written statement and only disclosed his alibi defence two years later, when the matter came to trial. The alibi defence was rejected by the trial court, and the accused was convicted. The accused's appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeal failed, and the matter then proceeded to the Constitutional Court, where the accused contended that the Supreme Court of Appeal had erred in drawing a negative inference from his failure to disclose his alibi defence timeously. Although there was concurrence on the ultimate fate of the appeal on this point, it attracted four separate judgments. Moseneke J (Chaskalson CJ and MadalaJ concurring) emphasised the distinction between pre-trial silence and trial silence. In terms of this distinction, the objective of the right to silence during trial is to secure a fair trial, whereas \\"the protection of the right to pre-trial silence seeks to oust any compulsion to speak.\\"Para 55.See also S v Sithole 2005 (2) SACR 504 (SCA) n 4, para 11 for a brief summary of the four separate judgments in Thebus. Moseneke J then categorically stated that, \\"in our constitutional setting, pre-trial silence of an accused can never warrant the drawing of an inference of guilt,\\"Para 57. as this would undermine both the right to remain silent and the right to be presumed innocent.Para 58. It is the ambiguity of pre-trial silence that prohibits an inference from silence being drawn. On Moseneke J's account, the drawing of an inference would render the mandatory warning of the right to remain silent \\"a trap instead of a means for finding out the truth in the interests of justice.\\"Para 58. Moseneke J drew a distinction between an inference as to guilt and an inference pertaining to credibility on the basis of a person's pre-trial silence. The latter would not necessarily infringe on the presumption of innocence.Para 59. \\"This distinction,\\" argues PJ Schwikkard, > is somewhat tendentious. For example, with respect to the late disclosure of > an alibi defence, a negative inference as to credibility will inevitably be > a factor taken into consideration in the ultimate determination of guilt or > innocence.Schwikkard & Van der Merwe Evidence 309. Moseneke J's judgment also supports a distinction between an inference as to guilt and the effect of late disclosure on the weight to be accorded the alibi evidence. The latter is simply treated as an unavoidable consequence of adversarial proceedings: Late disclosure precludes the prosecution from properly investigating the alibi defence. As a result, the alibi evidence will not be fully tested; less weight must be attached to it. The effect on weight is not the result of a negative inference as to credibility or guilt, but simply a product of the evaluation of evidence in the context of an adversarial system. As Schwikkard notes, however, > Moseneke J appears to equate this procedural consequence with an inference > as to credibility and argues that drawing an inference as to credibility > amounts to a compulsion to speak and consequently limits the accused‚Äôs right > to silence.Schwikkard & Van der Merwe Evidence 309. Moseneke J further noted that it is constitutionally mandatory to warn accused of their right to remain silent, but that it is not mandatory that they be warned that their silence may possibly be used against them, and that their silence will be taken into account in determining the weight to be accorded an alibi. Taking into account the limited use of an inference based on the late disclosure of an alibi, he concluded that the common-law rule is a justifiable limitation of the right to remain silent, and that late disclosure of an alibi may have consequences which \\"can legitimately be taken into account in evaluating the evidence as a whole.\\"Para 68. Moseneke J acknowledged that ‚Äúan election to disclose one‚Äôs defence only when one appears on trial is not only legitimate but also protected by the Constitution.‚ÄùPara 69. He then held, however, that this protection would not preclude cross-examination on the accused's election to remain silent, as such cross-examination would go to credit. Such cross-examination ‚Äúwould not unjustifiably limit the right to remain silent,‚ÄùPara 69. provided it was conducted with due regard to the dictates of trial fairness.Para 70. Goldstone and O‚ÄôRegan JJ (Ackermann and Mokgoro JJ concurring) concurred in the result, but dissented insofar as they reached the conclusion that drawing an adverse inference from the first appellant's failure timeously to disclose his alibi was an unjustifiable infringement of the right to remain silent. In considering the rationale for prohibiting inferences from silence, they rejected the argument that it is unfair to place the accused in a position where he will suffer adverse consequences whatever his election, on the basis that hard choices were unavoidable in the adversarial process.Para 83. They went no further, though, than suggesting that it is inevitable that there may be adverse consequences from exercising the right to remain silent. They avoided concluding that silence itself is an item of evidence. Goldstone and O‚ÄôRegan JJ also rejected the argument that drawing an adverse inference infringes the presumption of innocence because it relieves the state of part of its burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. They argued that the Constitution ‚Äúdoes not stipulate that only the state‚Äôs evidence may be used in determining whether the accused person has been proved guilty‚Äù.Para 83. Taking the historical record of policing into account, however, they found that the prohibition on adverse inferences was justified insofar as it protected accused persons from improper police questioning and procedures.Para 85. They held that this rationale does not extend to silence in court. They also endorsed the view that it is unfair to warn accused persons of their right to remain silent in a formulation that implies that there will be no penalty for silence, and then to permit a court to draw a negative inference from that silence.Para 86. Although it is legitimate for an accused to be compelled to make a choice, that choice must be an informed choice: ‚ÄúAn accused person needs to understand the consequences of remaining silent.‚ÄùPara 87. The warning also constitutes a barrier to drawing an adverse inference, in that, in many cases, it ‚Äúwill render the silence by the accused ambiguous.‚Äù Goldstone and O‚ÄôRegan JJ rejected the distinction between adverse inferences going to guilt and those going to credit. Although they might be conceptually different, the two justices wrote, ‚Äúthe practical effect of the adverse inference to be drawn for the purposes of credit, namely, that the alibi evidence is not to be believed, will often be no different to the effect of the inference to be drawn with respect to guilt, namely that the late tender of the alibi suggests that it is manufactured and that the accused is guilty.‚ÄùPara 90. They also rejected Moseneke J's conclusion that it is constitutionally permissible to cross- examine accused on their election to remain silent: # An accused should not be required to explain why she chose to exercise a constitutional right. # It would be unfair in the light of the constitutionally mandated warning in respect of silence.Para 91. The two justices concluded, however, that, if the warning was revised, an adverse inference from the late disclosure of an alibi would constitute a justifiable limitation on the right to remain silent. Yacoob J, although concurring in the result, took a somewhat different approach. He rejected the distinction between trial and pre-trial silence and held that section 35(1)(a) and section 35(3)(h) ‚Äúrepresent a continuum.‚ÄùPara 104. He identified the purpose of the right to silence as being to ‚Äúensure that people are protected from self-incrimination in the process of police interrogation.‚ÄùPara 105. However, the ultimate objective of the right to remain silent, Yacoob J held, is to ensure a fair trial. Furthermore, he wrote that the right to a fair trial > is not limited to ensuring fairness for the accused. It is much broader. A > court must also ensure that the trial is fair overall, and in that process, > balance the interests of the accused with that of society at large and the > administration of justice.Para 107. Because this broad concept of trial fairness cannot, presumably, be found in section 35(3), Yacoob J locates it in section 35(5). Section 35(5) confers a discretion on the courts to admit evidence even if it was unconstitutionally obtained, provided that it is fair to do so and its admission is not detrimental to the interests of justice. Consequently, Yacoob J held that, provided that the drawing of inferences from the exercise of the right to remain silent, or the interrogation of such exercise on cross-examination, does not ultimately render the trial unfair, there is no basis on which to forbid the drawing of such inferences. He reasoned as follows: > In the exercise of the duty to ensure a fair trial, it would become > necessary to balance the rights of the accused, the rights of the victim and > society at large. The right to silence of the accused could well become > implicated in this balancing exercise when the judicial officer makes > decisions concerning the admissibility of evidence, the allowing of cross- > examination, as well as the drawing of inferences. Indeed inferences arising > out of silence cannot ordinarily be drawn unless there is evidence of the > silence of the accused and evidence of the circumstances surrounding the > silence. Any investigation around the accused‚Äôs silence cannot be said to > infringe his right to silence unless the trial is thereby rendered unfair. > The same goes for all decisions concerning admissibility of evidence as well > as the use of silence in the drawing of inferences. The fairness of the > trial as an objective is fundamental and key. The right to silence can only > be infringed if it is implicated in a way that renders the trial unfair. It > is a contradiction in terms to suggest that the right to silence has been > infringed if it is implicated in a way that does not compromise the fairness > of the trial but enhances it.Para 109. \\"The reasoning in this passage,\\" writes Schwikkard, > is difficult to sustain. First, s 35(5) only becomes applicable once it has > been established that evidence has been unconstitutionally obtained. In > respect of the right to remain silent, it first needs to be established > whether the right to remain silent in s 35(1)(a) or s 35(3)(h) has been > infringed. The right to remain silent attaches only to arrested and accused > persons and does not embrace the rights of the victim and society at large. > The broader notion of trial fairness may possibly be read into s 35(5) but > is precluded at any earlier stage of the inquiry. Secondly, by conflating > the right to silence and the right to a fair trial at all stages, Yacoob J > implies that the only remedy for infringing the right to remain silent is > the exclusion of evidence. An arrested person who is subjected to improper > police questioning that infringes her right to remain silent must surely (at > least theoretically) be able to seek relief for the infringement of this > pre-trial right prior to going to trial. Undue emphasis on trial fairness > may result in insufficient attention being given to the underlying > relationship between the right to remain silent and the right to > dignity.Schwikkard & Van der Merwe Evidence 312. Schwikkard finds, though, that \\"much is to be said for the contextual approach taken by Yacoob J in respect of the appropriate warning to be given to arrested persons.\\"Schwikkard & Van der Merwe Evidence 312. Yacoob J suggested that a more complex warning as to the consequences of remaining silent may well ‚Äútilt the balance in favour of getting [a] person to speak,‚Äù and that such a consequence may not necessarily be fairer than the constitutionally prescribed warning that ‚Äúencourages silence on the part of an arrested person.‚Äù As a result, Yacoob J concluded that the more limited warning did not result in any unfairness to the appellant.Para 111. Schwikkard suggests that > contextualising these particular constitutional rights might also lead to > the conclusion that a more complex warning will make little difference to > the fairness of the trial: it is very likely that neither warning will be > properly understood. Therefore adverse inferences should not be permitted in > these circumstances as silence in response to an incomprehensible warning > would inevitably be too ambiguous to sustain an inference.Schwikkard & Van > der Merwe Evidence 312.Yacoob J, like Goldstone and O‚ÄôRegan JJ, rejected the > distinction between inferences that go to credibility and those that go to > guilt. Schwikkard finds that, \\"given the divergent judgments, it is difficult to state, with any clarity what the law now is.\\"Schwikkard & Van der Merwe Evidence 312. Ten judges heard the case. Only two of them,Ngcobo J, with Langa DCJ concurring. \\"surprisingly,\\"Schwikkard & Van der Merwe Evidence 312. found that it was unnecessary to determine whether the failure to disclose an alibi defence to the police could attract an adverse inference. On the facts of the case, the appellant had not exercised his right to silence and, after being duly warned, had responded to a question concerning his whereabouts. \\"In effect,\\" writes Schwikkard, \\"the court treated the matter as a previous inconsistent statement.\\"Schwikkard & Van der Merwe Evidence 312. Seven of the ten judges held that it was constitutionally impermissible to draw an adverse inference as to guilt from the accused's pre-trial silence. Four of the seven, however, indicated that, if the constitutionally-mandated warning was rephrased so as to apprise arrested persons of the consequences of remaining silent, an adverse inference for pre-trial silence might be constitutionally justifiable. Three other judges held that, although an adverse inference as to guilt was not justifiable, an adverse inference as to credibility was a justifiable limitation on the right to remain silent, and that it was permissible to cross-examine the accused on his failure to disclose an alibi timeously. Four justices expressly rejected this conclusion. All eight of the judges dealing with the question of adverse inferences would appear to have concurred with the view that there may well be acceptable negative consequences which attach to remaining silent: > It would seem, therefore, that the common-law position remains largely > intact and that it is constitutionally permissible to take the late > disclosure of an alibi into account in determining what weight should be > attached to the alibi defence.Schwikkard & Van der Merwe Evidence 313. As to the drawing of inferences from pre-trial silence, Moseneke J makes it clear that negative inferences are constitutionally impermissible. On the other hand, the concurring judgment of Goldstone and O‚ÄôRegan JJ suggests that such inferences might be constitutional if arrested persons are warned of the consequences of their silence. One conclusion that would be consistent with both judgments, and which is suggested by Schwikkard, > is that the ambiguity of silence (and the impermissibility of drawing any > inference) would remain if an arrested person did not understand the revised > warning. Such a restatement of the law would make it highly unlikely that a > negative inference could ever be drawn from silence at any stage where an > arrested person or accused person is not represented by counsel.Schwikkard & > Van der Merwe Evidence 313. The position on inferences to be made from trial silence \\"likewise remains unclear.\\"S v Brown 1996 2 SACR 49 (NC).S v Hlongwa 2002 2 SACR 37 (T).S v Scholt 1996 2 SACR 40 (NC).S v Lavhengwa 1996 2 SACR 453 (W). At common law, the prosecution could refer to the accused's silence once a prima facie case had been established. Clear authority exists for the proposition that, in certain circumstances, an accused's refusal to testify, when the prosecution had established a prima facie case, could be a factor in assessing guilt.S v Mthetwa 1972 3 SA 766 (A).S v Snyman 1968 2 SA 582 (A).S v Letsoko 1964 4 SA 768 (A).R v Ismail 1952 1 SA 204 (A). The Constitutional Court has not expressly ruled on whether drawing an adverse inference from silence at trial would pass constitutional muster, but it has on more than one occasion pronounced that trial silence may have such untoward consequences. In Thebus, the court wrote that > if there is evidence that requires a response and if no response is > forthcoming [...] the Court may be justified in concluding that the evidence > is sufficient, in the absence of an explanation, to prove the guilt of the > accused.Para 58.See also S v Boesak 2001 1 SA 912 (CC).S v Mokoena 2006 1 > SACR 29 (W).S v Hena 2006 2 SACR 33 (SE).S v Sithole 2005 2 SACR 504 (SCA). The precise nature of the negative consequences of remaining silent at trial is \\"not altogether clear.\\"Schwikkard & Van der Merwe Evidence 313. Schwikkard believes there to be two options: > (a) an adverse inference as to credibility or guilt; (b) a conclusion that > in the absence of contradictory evidence the evidence is sufficient to > convict. In (a) silence becomes an item of evidence whereas in (b) the > negative consequence is simply an unavoidable possibility in the final > evaluation of evidence. The problem with (a) is that to use silence as an > item of evidence against the accused may well infringe the right to remain > silent.Schwikkard & Van der Merwe Evidence 313. To date the Constitutional Court has avoided pronouncing upon the constitutionality of using trial silence as an item of evidence. However, the language employed by Ponnan JA in S v Monyane2008 1 SACR 543 (SCA). would suggest that the Supreme Court of Appeal is prepared to expand the ambit of negative consequences to include using silence as an item of evidence. This is suggested in the following passage: > [S]omewhat surprisingly, the fourth appellant did not testify. The presence > of his vehicle and the evidence of the second appellant linked him to the > crime scene. In those circumstances, a reasonable expectation existed that, > if there were an explanation consistent with his innocence, it would have > been proffered. He, however refused to rise to the challenge. For him to > have remained silent in the face of the evidence was nothing short of > damning.Para 19. It appears to Schwikkard that, in the circumstances of the case, there was sufficient evidence to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt without using silence as evidence. He finds > [a]nother difficulty that arises with drawing inferences from trial silence > [...]: what is the inference to be drawn if the accused remains silent on > the advice of counsel? In these circumstances it would very difficult for > any court to conclude that an inference to credibility or guilt was the only > reasonable inference‚Äîthe consequence outlined in (b) above would not > necessarily be precluded.Schwikkard & Van der Merwe Evidence 314 This issue was \\"skirted,\\" Schwikkard believes, by the Supreme Court of Appeal in S v Tandwa,2008 1 SACR 613 (SCA). in which the first accused alleged that his right to a fair trial had been compromised as a result of incompetent legal representation. The basis of this complainant was that counsel had advised him not to testify. The court, taking a similar approach to that in Monyane, held that silence could, depending on the circumstances, give rise to an inference of guilt: that is to say, could be used as an item of evidence against the accused in establishing guilt beyond reasonable doubt; indeed it was such an inference that led to the accused's conviction. The court did not explain how it discounted the undisputed fact that the accused remained silent on counsel's advice. \\"That being so,\\" writes Schwikkard, \\"it is difficult to understand how an inference as to guilt could be the only reasonable inference in the circumstances.\\"Schwikkard & Van der Merwe Evidence 314  See also  * Law of South Africa * South African civil procedure * South African criminal procedure * South African law of evidence  References = Books  * Du Toit, E.

It developed into a tropical storm late on October 20. After Lekima intensified into a typhoon and underwent rapid deepening in a very favorable environment on October 22, the system reached peak intensity on the following day. Maintaining its strength for over one day, Lekima began to weaken on October 24, as stronger vertical wind shear and mid-latitude westerlies began to make the typhoon significantly decay. On October 26, Lekima transitioned into an extratropical cyclone east of Japan. Despite its violent strength, Lekima caused minimal damage because it did not affect populated places. Meteorological history Early on October 19, 2013 the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) reported that a tropical depression had developed, within an area of strong vertical windshear, about to the northeast of the Micronesian island of Pohnpei. During that day as the system moved slowly westwards, upper level divergence helped to offset the vertical windshear and enhanced the atmospheric convection surrounding the system. As a result of this increase in convection and a consolidating low level circulation centre, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued a tropical cyclone formation alert on the system later that day. During October 20, the system continued to develop as it moved around the outer edge of a low level reflection of the subtropical ridge of high pressure. Later that day the JTWC initiated advisories on the system and designated it as Tropical Depression 22W, before the JMA named the system Lekima at 1800 UTC after it had developed into a tropical storm. Early on October 21, JMA upgraded Lekima to a severe tropical storm. Although a weak trough east of the cyclone was causing subsidence, vigorous eastward and equatorward outflow were helping sustain the convection. Late on the same day, JTWC upgraded Lekima to a typhoon. After JMA upgraded Lekima to a typhoon early on October 22, the system began to undergo rapid deepening, developing a well-defined eye with a symmetric eyewall and further improved deep convective banding owing to weak vertical wind shear and radial outflow. When Lekima was tracking along the southwestern periphery of a deep-layered subtropical ridge late on the same day, JTWC upgraded the system to a super typhoon with category 5 strength on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale, as an anticyclone was providing very favourable dual-channel outflow. Early on October 23, JMA reported that Typhoon Lekima had reached peak intensity, with 10-minute maximum sustained winds at 115 knots (215 km/h, 130 mph) and atmospheric pressure at . Since then, the typhoon has maintained its peak intensity for over one day, with a larger and sharply defined eye surrounded by a thick eyewall of deep convection. However, morphed integrated microwave imageries at CIMSS (MIMIC) depict that Lekima underwent an eyewall replacement cycle late on October 23 and completed it one day later. Lekima becoming extratropical on October 26 As Lekima began to approach mid-latitude westerlies and stronger vertical wind shear, JMA reported that the typhoon north of the Northern Mariana Islands started to slowly weaken at noon on October 24, yet JTWC analysed it had weakened earlier. JTWC best track data indicated that Lekima weakened into a typhoon at noon, for elongation becoming evident along the northern flank. On October 25, when Lekima was located east of the Bonin Islands, it crested the western periphery of the subtropical ridge and was poised to accelerate northeastwards. Meanwhile, a point source anticyclone continued to provide favorable radial outflow, but convection became more shallow over the system. Under moderate to strong westerly vertical wind shear and interacting with the mid-latitude westerlies in the afternoon, Lekima has begun extratropical transition; as the result, the typhoon lost the eyewall structure, but it still maintained tightly curved banding wrapping into a well-defined centre. Early on October 26, the low-level circulation centre became partially exposed, positioning along the western edge of the deep convection. JMA later depicted that a warm front had formed over the eastern side of Typhoon Lekima, as well as JTWC issued a final warning to the system. At noon, Lekima completed its extratropical transition east of Japan, having weakened into a storm-force developed low. After crossing the International Date Line on October 28, the system was absorbed by another developing low on October 30. Impact The west rain-bands of Lekima passed through the northern part of the Northern Mariana Islands on October 24 and later the Bonin Islands on October 25. Although JMA even issued gale and storm surge warnings over the Ogasawara Islands, there is no damage from the typhoon in the islands.

William Humfrey (d.1579), who had been appointed Assay Master at the Royal Mint in 1561, needed someone knowledgeable about calamine ore, used in the production of latten and brass, and paid Schutz' way to England. In 1564 Schutz, aided by twenty German- speaking workers, built England's first blast furnace at Tintern. In a letter of 16 August 1565 to Sir William Cecil, Humfrey stated that Schutz was 'bound in ¬£10,000 to communicate his art in working metals', and requested that he and Schutz be granted a joint patent. In September 1565 Humfrey and Schutz were granted licences to prospect for calamine in England and in the Pale in Ireland, and to mine and process the ore, being joined in some of their licences with Thomas Smythe, William Williams and Humfrey Cole. Only a few months later, in early 1566, William Humfrey and Schutz found calamine in the Mendip Hills, and Daniel Hoechstetter designed a refining process by which it could be used in Schutz' furnace at Tintern. As a reward for his work at Tintern, Schutz was granted denization on 9 April 1568, but the extraction of calamine ore at Worle Hill proved prohibitively expensive for the production of brass, and on 28 May the Company of Mineral and Battery Works, a newly incorporated joint stock company in which both Humfrey and Schutz held shares together with many influential members of the English court and government, took over the operation of the furnace, and converted it to the production of iron wire. A by-product of Schutz' first venture was the use of calamine lotion in the treatment of burns from furnaces, which Schutz developed with Burchard Kranich, another German-born metallurgist and one of the Queen's physicians. Schutz' expertise was made use of by the Company of Mineral and Battery Works over the next decade in the design of a steel furnace at Robertsbridge, Sussex, and smelters at Beauchief Abbey near Sheffield, Bristol, Nottingham, London and elsewhere. The company is said to have employed 8,000 workers at this time. Frobisher voyages Modern-day Kimmirut, in the area known to Schutz as Meta Incognita Schutz' next venture, however, was a financial disaster. In January 1577 Schutz assisted Giovanni Battista Agnello, a Venetian then living in London, in the assaying of a black stone which had been picked up lying loose on the surface of Hall's Island by Robert Garrard during Sir Martin Frobisher's first voyage to the Canadian Arctic in search of the Northwest Passage.Garrard was one of five men captured by the Inuit several days later; . Agnello's claim that the stone was gold- bearing (apparently confirmed or at least accepted by Schutz) caused government officials to authorise a second voyage by Frobisher to Baffin Island. Schutz accompanied Frobisher's ships to Meta Incognita, where he is said to have found a 'great ruby stone' which Frobisher promised to present to the Queen in Schutz's name, but which was apparently not heard of again after it came into Frobisher's hands. In August 1577 Schutz, Robert Denham and Gregory Bona, in a brick-lined furnace built for the purpose, assayed black ore mine at the Countess of Warwick's Island, (now Kodlunarn Island) in Frobisher Bay. Back in England, between 1 November 1577 and 6 March 1578 Schutz performed three 'great proofes' of the black ore brought back from this second voyage. Agnello and Kranich were also brought in to assay the ore, and Kranich and Schutz were soon at odds, with Schutz accusing Kranich, who was favoured by Frobisher, of 'evil manners and ignorance'. It was later alleged by Robert Denham, who had assisted Kranich with his tests, that Kranich had added gold and silver coins of his own to bring the projected value of the refined ore to ¬£50 per ton. Schutz' tests were conducted in a small furnace in the garden of the London residence at Tower Hill of Sir William Wynter, the Queen's Master of the Naval Ordnance. The second of these tests, completed on 6 December 1577, found that the ore contained ¬£40 worth of gold and silver per ton. Although this result fell short of Frobisher's claim that the ore would yield ¬£60 worth of gold per ton, government officials were sufficiently impressed to authorise a third voyage to Baffin Island to secure 2000 additional tons of ore. The results from Schutz' third test, completed on 6 March 1578, were even less promising: the refined ore was projected to yield only ¬£23 15s worth of gold and silver per ton. Nonetheless, Frobisher's third voyage went ahead, and a smelter was built at Dartford under Schutz' direction at a cost of ¬£583. Schutz made further tests at Dartford of a ton of ore on 29 December 1578, and a half ton of ore on 20 January 1579. The latter test yielded a value of only ¬£10 per ton, causing suspicion to fall on Schutz, Denham, Frobisher and Michael Lok, a major promoter of the Frobisher voyages. The Commissioners appointed to supervise the voyages then ordered Schutz to perform a further test in their presence at Tower Hill, which he did on 22 March 1579. This time he obtained results of ¬£15 a ton, which appeared to satisfy the Commissioners. Seeing his reputation being thus brought into discredit Schutz offered, in partnership with Robert Denham, to buy the entire 1300 tons of ore at Dartford at 20 marks a ton, and to refine it at their own cost; their offer was delivered by Lok to Lord Burghley and Sir Francis Walsingham on 18 April 1579, along with a separate offer from Lok himself for 150 tons of the ore. The Privy Council was at first inclined to accept the offer; however Frobisher insinuated that Lok and Schutz were fraudulently trying to get valuable ore worth ¬£40 a ton into their own hands, and Sir Thomas Gresham and the other Commissioners, influenced by Frobisher, then termed it a disgrace to the Queen to sell it. The work at Dartford thus came to a halt. In a report in 1581 Schutz' design for the Dartford furnace was blamed, but recent modern research has shown that the real problem was that the 1400 tonnes of ore brought back to England from Baffin Island were not gold-bearing. Hogarth concluded that since Schutz had attempted to buy all the ore himself, he was unlikely to have tampered with the tests, and the 'inescapable conclusion' is that the assay method was at fault, perhaps because of contamination from additives necessarily used in the process. McDermott also notes that Schutz' original test while he was on Countess of Warwick Island had been on a 'rich red ore' from Jonas' Mount, but little of that ore was brought back on the 1577 voyage because the ships were already laden with black ore before the red ore was found, and Frobisher did not mine at Jonas' Mount on the 1578 voyage. Moreover, the original black stone had been found by Garrard on Hall's Island during the 1576 voyage, and according to Michael Lok's account, no ore was discovered during a search of Hall's Island on the second voyage of 1577, and Frobisher 'never after brought home one stone more of that rich ore which he brought in the first voyage, for there was none of it to be found'. Later years Little is known of Schutz' last years. He appears to have survived the Frobisher debacle relatively unscathed, although investors, including a number of prominent courtiers,'East Indies: December 1577', Calendar of State Papers Colonial, East Indies, China and Japan, Volume 2: 1513‚Äì1616 (1864), pp. 27‚Äì30 Retrieved 4 November 2013. lost ¬£20,000, and the lawsuits which followed ruined one of the scheme's principal proponents, Michael Lok. The Dartford furnace was eventually sold, and by 1586 had become England's first paper mill under the auspices of John Spilman. Schutz is said to have been employed by King James of Scotland as Master of the Works for Ores from Cathay and the North West Parts, and to have been replaced in that position by Act of the Scottish Parliament in 1593 by Bevis Bulmer. Schutz' date of death is not known. He owned a house in London in St Giles Cripplegate, and in his will dated 8 February 1574 requested burial in that parish. His will was not proved until 8 June 1592. In it he left nothing to his wife (thought to have been named Orothea). Apart from a few bequests, including ¬£100 left to his brother, Balthazar, his estate went to his executor, Francis Barty (or Berty) (d. 5 June 1611), a native of Antwerp of Florentine parentage who married Katherine Leake, the daughter of the Southwark brewer, Henry Leake (d.1559). Barty was one of the original shareholders in the Company of Mineral and Battery Works. The relationship between Shutz and his executor was a long-standing one: on 14 June 1566 Barty had sent a letter from Sluys to Sir William Cecil, recommending Schutz, who was 'coming to England to establish battery and wire works'.

At the time, it was a part of Ust-Kamenogorsky Uyezd of Semipalatinsk Oblast, which in 1920 was transformed into Semipalatinsk Governorate. On January 17, 1928 Semipalatinsk Governorate was abolished, and Charsky became a part of Zharma (Dzharma) District of Semipalatinsk Okrug of the Kazak Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic. On December 17, 1930 the okrug was abolished, and the districts were directly subordinated to the republic. On February 20, 1932 East Kazakhstan Oblast was established, and Zharma District became a part of the region. On October 14, 1939 Semipalatinsk Oblast was split off East Kazakhstan Oblast, and Zharma District was moved into Semipalatinsk Oblast. On October 16, 1939 Charsky District was established, with the administrative center located in Charsky. The district was split off Zharma District. In 1963, Charsky was granted town status and renamed Charsk. In 1964, the district was merged into Zharma District, and re-established on March 10, 1972. On May 3, 1997 Semipalatinsk Region was abolished and merged into East Kazakhstan Region. On May 23, 1997 Charsk District was abolished and merged into Zharma District.

After winning his only race as a two-year-old, Light Cavalry was one of the best three-year- olds in Britain in 1980, winning the King Edward VII Stakes and being placed in the Chester Vase, Gordon Stakes and Great Voltigeur Stakes before winning the St Leger by four lengths. He remained in training in 1981 and won the Princess of Wales's Stakes, but his season was restricted by injury problems. After his retirement from racing he stood as a breeding stallion in the United States and Argentina with limited success. Background Light Cavalry was a \\"big, rangy\\" heavily built bay horse with a white blaze and a white sock on his right hind leg bred by his owner Jim Joel. He was the only British classic winner sired by Brigadier Gerard, an outstanding racehorse who won seventeen of his eighteen races between 1970 and 1972 including the 2000 Guineas, Champion Stakes (twice), Eclipse Stakes and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. Apart from Light Cavalry, his best offspring was probably the Champion Stakes winner Vayrann. Light Cavalry's dam Glass Slipper was a half-sister of the Derby winner Royal Palace and showed good form during a brief racing career, finishing second in the Musidora Stakes. A year after Light Cavalry was foaled, Glass Slipper produced Fairy Footsteps, a filly who won the 1000 Guineas in 1981. Joel sent the colt into training with Henry Cecil at his Warren Place stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. Light Cavalry was ridden in his all his races by the retained stable jockey: the veteran English jockeys Joe Mercer (as two-year-old and three-year-old) and Lester Piggott (as a four- year-old). Racing career=1979: two-year-old season On his racecourse debut, Light Cavalry contested a maiden race over seven furlong at Sandown Park Racecourse in October. He took the lead two furlongs from the finish and won comfortably by a length from Himalia. In their annual Racehorses of 1979, Timeform described him as having \\"considerable scope for improvement\\". 1980: three-year-old season Light Cavalry began his three-year-old season in May, when he contested the Group Three Chester Vase, a trial race for the Epsom Derby. He was settled behind the leaders in the early stages, but when asked to accelerate in the straight he made no progress and finished third behind Henbit and Moomba Masquerade. Later that month he was dropped in class for a handicap race at Newbury Racecourse over one and a half miles. He started the odds-on favourite and won the race, but had to work hard to secure the prize from Ayyabaan, and was not particularly impressive. Light Cavalry missed the Derby (won by Henbit) and reappeared in the Group Two King Edward VII Stakes at Royal Ascot in June when he started at odds of 9/2. Joe Mercer adopted more aggressive tactics, racing in first or second place throughout, and Light Cavalry responded by staying on strongly in the straight to win by three-quarters of a length and a length from Saviour and Saint Jonathon. Cecil then prepared the colt for the St Leger, beginning with a run in the Gordon Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse in July, when Light Cavalry finished third behind the Irish Derby runner-up Prince Bee and Fingal's Cave. Light Cavalry met Prince Bee in the Great Voltigeur Stakes at York Racecourse. Light Cavalry led from the start and went clear of the field in the straight but was overtaken in the final quarter mile and beaten two lengths by Prince Bee. In both of his defeats by Prince Bee, Light Cavalry had been conceding weight to the Dick Hern-trained colt. Prince Bee was aimed at the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and Light Cavalry started the 3/1 second favourite against six opponents for the 204th running of the St Leger Stakes over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse on 13 September. The Alycidon Stakes winner Water Mill was a short-priced favourite, while the other contenders included Saviour, World Leader and the French-trained Lancastrian. The start of the race was delayed when Lancastrian threw of his jockey Freddy Head and broke loose, but the colt was sson reunited with his rider and was able to take part in the classic. Mercer repeated the tactics employed at York, taking the lead from the start and setting a steady pace before accelerating on the turn into the straight. Water Mill emerged as his only serious challenger, but Light Cavalry stayed on very strongly in the final quarter mile and drew away in the closing stages to win by four lengths. Water Mill finished second, four lengths clear of World Leader in third place. 1981: four-year-old season On his four-year-old debut, Light Cavalry started favourite for the John Porter Stakes over one and a half miles at Newbury Racecourse in April. He ran very poorly, finishing unplaced behind Pelerin, and returned from the race with a tendon injury and a swollen hock, leading Cecil to speculate that the colt might never run again. Light Cavalry recovered from his injuries in time to run in the Hardwicke Stakes at Royal Ascot in June. He set a strong pace from the start and stayed on after being overtaken in the straight and finished second, three lengths behind Pelerin, to whom he was conceding weight. In the Princess of Wales's Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse three weeks later, Light Cavalry conceded at least twelve pounds to his seven opponents in the Group Two Princess of Wales's Stakes in which he was ridden by Lester Piggott and started at odds of 11/4. Piggott sent Light Cavalry into the lead from the start and set a strong pace before being overtaken by Royal Fountain three furlongs from the finish but quickly regained the lead. A furlong from the finish Light Cavalry was challenged by Castle Keep and Centurius and appeared beaten but rallied under strong pressure and won by a neck. Light Cavalry was then aimed at the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot in July, but suffered a recurrence of his tendon injury and appeared before the race with heavily bandaged legs. He led the race for a mile, but eventually finished last of the seven runners behind Shergar. Assessment In 1979, the independent Timeform gave Light Cavalry a rating of 95p, the \\"p\\" indicating that the colt was likely to make more than normal improvement. In 1980, Timeform gave Light Cavalry a rating of 128, nine pounds below the top- rated horse Moorestyle. In the official International Classification he was rated the eighth-best three-year-old colt in Europe, four pounds below Moorestyle. In the following year, Timeform rated him at 124, while in the International Classification he was rated the fourth-best older male racehorse in Europe, and the tenth-best horse of any age. In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Light Cavalry an \\"inferior\\" winner of the St Leger. Stud career In September 1981, Light Cavalry was sold for an estimated $2,500,000 and exported to stand at Crescent Farm, Kentucky, U.S.A. at a stud fee of $12,500 a mare. He was exported to Argentina in 1987 and died in December 2004. The best of his offspring was probably Mr Light Tres who won the Argentinian Gran Premio del Jockey Club in 1992.

South African Railways and Harbours Magazine, October 1943. pp. 731-734. In attempts to overcome the problem, John D. Tilney, the Eastern System's Locomotive Superintendent, carried out many experiments on some of the 4th Class locomotives which had entered service on the Eastern System in 1880 and 1882. The most significant of these experiments involved modifying the boilers and frames to accommodate oscillating firebars and larger fireboxes. Manufacturer Based on the results of Tilney's experiments, complete sets of drawings for a tank-and-tender goods locomotive as well as a American type tender passenger locomotive were prepared at the CGR's Salt River shops in 1882. It was submitted to Neilson and Company for the construction of two and four locomotives. In 1884, the experimental locomotives, numbered in the range from E49 to E52, entered service on the Eastern System for evaluation by Tilney. Characteristics The design of the two types was an early attempt at standardisation, since the boilers and tenders and many other parts were made interchangeable. The three-axle tender was unusual, since the leading axle was mounted in a rigid frame while the other two were mounted in a bogie, a design which possibly had the aim of improving stability when running tender-first. This was the first time that a bogie was used under a tender in South Africa, but also the only time that this tender wheel arrangement was used on the CGR. This peculiar tender wheel arrangement appeared in South Africa on only one other occasion, eighteen years later on the Baldwin-built Zululand Railway Company contractor's locomotive in Natal. Like the Neilson-built 4th Class of 1882, these locomotives were built with Joy valve gear, but they had smaller coupled wheels of diameter. The coupled wheels were not spaced equidistant from each other, with a wheelbase of between the leading wheel and the driver and between the driver and the trailing wheel. The locomotives gave good results in service, but were difficult to fire due to their very long and narrow grates. When better quality coal, more suitable for use in the standard locomotives, began to become available from the coalfields in Natal, no more locomotives of this experimental design were ordered. Service=Cape Government Railways The Joy valve gear was not considered entirely satisfactory. After Michael Stephens retired and H.M. Beatty took over as Chief Locomotive Superintendent of the CGR in 1896, these locomotives were converted to Stephenson valve gear and had their side-tanks removed. By the time the three CGR systems linked up, the system number prefixes had been done away with and these locomotives were renumbered into the range from 641 to 644. By 1904, numbers 641 and 643 no longer appeared in the CGR locomotive register. South African Railways When the Union of South Africa was established on 31 May 1910, the three Colonial government railways (CGR, Natal Government Railways and Central South African Railways) were united under a single administration to control and administer the railways, ports and harbours of the Union. Even though the South African Railways and Harbours came into existence in 1910, the actual classification and renumbering of all the rolling stock of the three constituent railways was only implemented with effect from 1 January 1912. By 1912, only no. 644 survived. Like the rest of the 4th Class locomotives, it was considered obsolete by the SAR, designated Class 04 and renumbered to 0644. It was scrapped by 1918.Classification of S.A.R. Engines with Renumbering Lists, issued by the Chief Mechanical Engineer's Office, Pretoria, January 1912, p. 26.

He is a critic of the open access publishing movement and particularly how predatory publishers use the open access concept, and is especially known for his blog Scholarly Open Access. He has also written on this topic in The Charleston Advisor, in Nature, in Learned Publishing, and elsewhere. When Beall created his list, he was employed as a librarian and associate professorNo More 'Beall's List', Inside Higher Ed at the University of Colorado Denver. More recently, he was a librarian at Auraria Library in Denver until March 2018.In copies of the staff directory of Auraria Library archived in the Wayback Machine, the library listed Beall as Scholarly Communications Librarian on August 27, 2017, as Copyright and Information Access Librarian on March 7, 2018, and no longer listed Beall on April 30, 2018. See also his credentials reported in a 2014 interview:  Education and career  Beall has a bachelor's degree in Spanish from California State University, Northridge (1982), as well as an MA in English from Oklahoma State University (1987) and an MSc in library science from the University of North Carolina (1990). Until December 2012, he served on the editorial board of Cataloging & Classification Quarterly. In that same year, Beall was awarded tenure by the University of Colorado Denver. In an interview with The Charleston Advisor in July 2013, he said that his biggest influence was Fred Kilgour.  Criticism of open access publishing  Beall classifies open access (OA) publishers as following a \\"gold model\\" in which authors pay for their work to be published and a \\"platinum model\\" in which they do not pay, and sees the gold model as being prone to abuse. He has argued that \\"the act of instituting financial transactions between scholarly authors and scholarly publishers is corrupting scholarly communication. This was one of the great benefits of the traditional scholarly publishing system ‚Äì it had no monetary component in the relationship between publishers and their authors. Adding the monetary component has created the problem of predatory publishers and the problem of financing author fees.\\" In a June 2012 interview, Beall said that while he supported what he called \\"platinum open-access\\", he concluded: \\"The only truly successful model that I have seen is the traditional publishing model.\\" In December 2013, Beall published a comment in tripleC, an open access journal, in which he articulated his criticism of open access publishing advocates. He noted that the quality of articles published in many OA journals is low, that peer review in many OA journals is negligible or non-existent, that public access to poor-quality articles harms the public, and that the careers of young scholars who publish in poor-quality OA journals are harmed. He portrayed the open access movement as an anti-corporatist movement whose advocates pursue the goal of \\"kill[ing] off the for-profit publishers and mak[ing] scholarly publishing a cooperative and socialistic enterprise\\" while ignoring the benefits of traditional academic publishers, including consistent peer review and attention to the long-term preservation of articles they publish. He has also been critical of the Directory of Open Access Journals for relying on data supplied by journal publishers to determine whether the journal in question should be included in the directory. Beall provided an overview of the history of predatory publishing, his involvement with the issue, and a summary and reiteration of most of the above criticisms in an article published in June 2017. Predatory open access publishing Beall is well known for his investigations of predatory open access publishing, a term he coined. He has published a number of analyses of predatory OA journals, such as one of Bentham Open in The Charleston Advisor in 2009. However, his interest in such journals began when, in 2008, he started to receive numerous requests from dubious journals to serve on their editorial boards. He has said that he \\"immediately became fascinated because most of the e-mails contained numerous grammatical errors.\\" Since 2008, he has maintained a well-known and regularly updated list of what he states are \\"potential, possible, or probable predatory scholarly open-access publishers\\". In 2011, Beall's list had 18 publishers on it; by December 29, 2016, this number had grown to 923. Beall has estimated that predatory open access journals publish about 5-10 percent of all open access articles, and that at least 25 percent of open access journals are predatory. He has been particularly critical of OMICS Publishing Group, which he described as \\"the worst of the worst\\" in a 2016 Inside Higher Education article. Predatory meetings Beall coined the term \\"predatory meetings\\" for a new activity of OMICS and others in organising scientific conferences claiming editorial boards and organising committees with prominent academics who have not agreed to participate, with high fees for attendance, and with poor reviewing standards for acceptance. Deceptively similar names to existing reputable conferences are also used. Beall has criticised the financial arrangements for OMICS conferences, noting that the \\"registration policy shows that they never grant refunds for registration fees - even if they themselves cancel or postpone the conference. Instead, they grant a credit for other OMICS conferences.\\" He also recommends, \\"in the strongest terms possible, that all scholars from all countries avoid doing business in any way with the OMICS Group. Do not submit papers. Do not agree to serve on their editorial boards. Do not register for or attend their conferences.\\" He notes a profusion of such conferences located in Asia and identified features of these predatory meetings.  Beall's list and the Science sting  In 2013, Science published the results of a sting operation in which a scientifically flawed spoof publication was submitted to open access publications. Many accepted the manuscript, and a disproportionate number of the accepting journals were on Beall's list. The publication, entitled Who's Afraid of Peer Review?, concluded that Beall is \\"good at spotting publishers with poor quality control\\". Of publishers on his list that completed the review process, it was accepted by 82%. Beall remarked that the author of the sting, John Bohannon, \\"basically found what I've been saying for years\\". Counter-criticism Phil Davis, in an analysis of the Who's Afraid of Peer Review? sting operation, observed that \\"Beall is falsely accusing nearly one in five as being a 'potential, possible, or probable predatory scholarly open access publisher' on appearances alone.\\" He continued to say that Beall \\"should reconsider listing publishers on his 'predatory' list until he has evidence of wrongdoing. Being mislabeled as a 'potential, possible, or probable predatory publisher' by circumstantial evidence alone is like the sheriff of a Wild West town throwing a cowboy into jail just 'cuz he's a little funny lookin.' Civility requires due process.\\" Joseph Esposito wrote in The Scholarly Kitchen that he had been following some of Beall's work with \\"growing unease\\" and that Beall's \\"broader critique (really an assault) of Gold OA and those who advocate it\\" had \\"crossed the line\\". Wayne Bivens-Tatum, librarian at Princeton University, published a rebuttal in tripleC, regarding Beall's criticisms of open access publishing. He stated that Beall's \\"rhetoric provides good examples of what Albert O. Hirschman called the 'rhetoric of reaction'\\", and concluded Beall's \\"argument fails because the sweeping generalizations with no supporting evidence render it unsound.\\" City University of New York librarians Monica Berger and Jill Cirasella said his views are biased against open-access journals from less economically developed countries. Berger and Cirasella argued that \\"imperfect English or a predominantly non-Western editorial board does not make a journal predatory\\". While recognizing that \\"the criteria he uses for his list are an excellent starting point for thinking about the hallmarks of predatory publishers and journals,\\" they suggest that, \\"given the fuzziness between low-quality and predatory publishers, whitelisting, or listing publishers and journals that have been vetted and verified as satisfying certain standards, may be a better solution than blacklisting.\\" One major journal whitelist is the Directory of Open Access Journals; Lars Bj√∏rnshauge, its managing director, estimated that questionable publishing probably accounts for fewer than 1% of all author- pays, open-access papers, a proportion far lower than Beall's estimate of 5‚Äì10%. Instead of relying on blacklists, Bj√∏rnshauge argues that open-access associations such as the DOAJ and the Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association should adopt more responsibility for policing publishers: they should lay out a set of criteria that publishers and journals must comply with to win a place on a whitelist, indicating that they are trustworthy. Rick Anderson, associate dean in the J. Willard Marriott Library, University of Utah, challenged the term \\"predatory open access publishing\\" itself: \\"what do we mean when we say 'predatory,' and is that term even still useful?... This question has become relevant because of that common refrain heard among Beall's critics: that he only examines one kind of predation‚Äîthe kind that naturally crops up in the context of author-pays OA.\\" Anderson suggested that the term \\"predatory\\" be retired in the context of scholarly publishing. \\"It's a nice, attention-grabbing word, but I'm not sure it's helpfully descriptive‚Ä¶ it generates more heat than light.\\" In its place, he proposed the term \\"deceptive publishing\\". Website removal On 15 January 2017, the entire content of the Scholarly Open Access website was removed, along with Beall's faculty page on the University of Colorado's website. The removal was first noticed on social media, with speculation on whether the removal was due to migration of the list to the stewardship of Cabell's International. The company later denied any relationship, and its vice president of business development declared that Beall \\"was forced to shut down blog due to threats and politics\\". The University of Colorado also declared that the decision to take down the list was a personal decision from Beall. Beall later wrote that he had taken down his blog because of pressure from the University of Colorado, which threatened his job security. Beall's supervisor, Shea Swauger, wrote that the university had supported Beall's work and had not threatened his academic freedom. A demand by Frontiers Media to open a research misconduct case against Beall, to which the University of Colorado acquiesced, is reported as the immediate reason for Beall to take down the list. The university's investigation was closed with no findings. At least two projects continue Jeffrey Beall's work on lists of predatory publishers and journals. After the website was taken down, medical researcher Roger Pierson of the University of Saskatchewan said, \\"To see Beall's work disappear would be an absolute disaster,\\" adding, \\"From an academic perspective, this represents the absence of an extremely important resource.\\" Legal threats In February 2013, the open-access publisher Canadian Center for Science and Education sent a letter to Beall stating that Beall's inclusion of their company on his list of questionable open-access publishers amounted to defamation. The letter also stated that if Beall did not remove this company from his list, they would subject him to \\"civil action\\". In May 2013, OMICS Publishing Group, which had also been included on Beall's list of predatory open access publishers, issued a warning to Beall in a poorly-written letter stating that they intended to sue him, and were seeking $1 billion in damages under section 66A of India's Information Technology Act, 2000. However, section 66A was struck down as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of India in an unrelated case in 2015. In 2016, Beall welcomed news that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission had filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court against the OMICS group. The complaint is the first against an academic publisher and alleges that the defendants have been \\"deceiving academics and researchers about the nature of its publications and hiding publication fees ranging from hundreds to thousands of dollars\\", holding manuscripts hostage by seeking fees to allow them to be withdrawn, and promoting predatory conferences; Inside Higher Education reports that Beall has published examples of these sorts of activities by OMICS, and he has previously said of the organisation: \\"If anything is predatory, it's that publisher. It's the worst of the worst.\\" OMICS' attorneys have described the allegations as baseless. In November 2017, a federal court in the District of Nevada granted a preliminary injunction that > \\"prohibits the defendants from making misrepresentations regarding their > academic journals and conferences, including that specific persons are > editors of their journals or have agreed to participate in their > conferences. It also prohibits the defendants from falsely representing that > their journals engage in peer review, that their journals are included in > any academic journal indexing service, or any measurement of the extent to > which their journals are cited. It also requires that the defendants clearly > and conspicuously disclose all costs associated with submitting or > publishing articles in their journals.\\" ReferencesExternal links * (now offline) * Updated Beall's List of Predatory Publisher maintained by an anonymous postdoctoral European researcher * Category:Academic librarians Category:American male bloggers Category:American bloggers Category:American librarians Category:California State University, Northridge alumni Category:Living people Category:Oklahoma State University alumni Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:University of Colorado Denver faculty Category:UNC School of Information and Library Science alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Jeffrey Beall"},{"id":"40950841","text":"Dirofilaria tenuis is a species of nematode, a parasitic roundworm that infects the subcutaneous tissue of vertebrates. D. tenuis most commonly infects raccoons,Studies on the Development of Dirofilaria tenuis Chandler 1942. Warren R. Pistey, The Journal of Parasitology, Vol. 44, No. 6 (Dec., 1958), pp. 613-626 but some human cases have been reported They are vectored by mosquitoes and follow similar development and transmission patterns as other Dirofilaria.  Morphology  Adults of D. tenuis are long and thin with a pointed anterior end. The posterior end is long, drawn out, and typically remains coiled. It possesses a hook and may have up to fifteen pairs of sensory organs known as papillae covering the posterior region of the body. Females vary in length, from 8‚Äì13 cm, averaging about 9 cm, while males are 4-4.8 cm in length, averaging 4.5 cm. D. tenuis possess eight papillae in addition to two amphids around the mouth opening. The mouth leads to a short esophagus, which is connected to the intestine and leads to the excretory opening. D. tenuis also possesses a nerve cord at the anterior end of the body cavity and differentiated reproductive organs. The outermost surface of the cuticle, or outer covering of the worm, is covered in small lines running transversely and more prominent ridges arranged longitudinally. These ridges are less prominent at the head and anal ends. The combination of the transverse lines and longitudinal ridges can give D. tenuis a beaded appearance.  Life cycle  D. tenuis is introduced to the host (either a raccoon or, as in some rare cases, a human) as a larva when the vector, most commonly an Aedes or Anopheles mosquito, takes a blood meal and the parasite enters the host through the bite wound. Once inside the host, the larva molts into its final larval stage and then into an adult. As an adult it resides in the subcutaneous tissue of the host. These adults are able to live up to ten years within the tissue of the host. The female is able to reproduce throughout her entire adult life and her eggs and microfilariae enter the peripheral blood stream of the host. They are then ingested by the vector mosquitoes during a blood meal and travel to the malphigian tubules of the mosquito. There, they undergo development, from microfilaria, to first, second, and finally third stage larvae. This typically spans a length of 10‚Äì12 days. Following the third larval stage, at which point they have become infective, they travel back to the proboscis of the mosquito via the haemocoel and enter another definitive host. If the mosquito is highly infected, multiple larvae can be transmitted in one blood meal. Humans are a dead-end host for D. tenuis; after the larva molts into an adult, it cannot reproduce. The worm may live subcutaneously for several months before it dies.  Pathology and Treatment  D. tenuis is frequently found in the southeastern part of the United States and is most commonly a parasite of raccoons, but some human cases have been reported. Although there are multiple species of mosquitoes that can become infected with and possibly vector the nematode, Anopheles quadrimaculatus and Aedes taeniohynchus have proven to be the most effective and most common host species. There does not seem to be an overwhelming effect on the definitive host, the raccoon, that would cause significant health issues. The only apparent disturbances to the host are the small nodules that form as an inflammatory response at the surface of the skin when one of the worms dies. Most research suggests that the parasite and the host are compatible and able to coexist over a time period of many years. D. tenuis is not compatible with a human host, so it dies much more quickly, living only a few months. During this time, a lump or nodule will form where the worm is located. This most commonly occurs near the site of the mosquito bite, but can also be much farther away. D. tenuis may migrate using the host‚Äôs blood, leaving the worm anywhere in the body, even the conjunctiva of the eye. As the body attempts to clear the worm, the nodule may become painful. If the patient continues to experience discomfort, the worm may be surgically excised. Excision is a curative treatment and the worm is diagnosed as D. tenuis easily using its unique morphology.

The Corps of Canadian Voyageurs was raised in September 1812, by the British Army, as a military water transportation corps. Its mission was to maintain the supply lines, between Montreal and the western posts. The corps was disbanded in March 1813, and its mission was taken over by the Canadian branch of the British Commissariat Department, a department of HM Treasury, as the Provincial Commissariat Voyageurs.

Weapons The Army-issued swords, pikes and pistols were impractical, and they were thrown away or sold and the men used their own frontier weapons: they were issued with brown bess muskets, axes and knives. Discipline The Corps was known for its lack of discipline, at least in comparison with the iron discipline required by the British Army.

Shirley, 532 U.S. 645 (2001), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held the Navajo Nation's imposition of a hotel occupancy tax upon nonmembers on non-Indian fee land within its reservation is invalid.  Background  The Atkinson Trading Company, Inc. owns a hotel, restaurant, cafeteria, gallery, curio shop, retail store, and recreational vehicle facility, which are located on non-Indian fee land within the Navajo Nation Reservation. The tribe provided police, fire, and ambulance services for the area, including the hotel complex. In 1992, the Navajo Nation enacted an 8 percent hotel occupancy tax on hotel rooms located within the reservation. Atkinson sought a declaratory judgment that the tax was invalid under Montana v. United States.; , 256 (2005). Under Montana, Indian tribes lack civil authority over the conduct of non-Indians on non-Indian land which is located on a reservation. An exception to Montana is where the non-Indian had entered into a consensual relationship with the tribe. Here, the hotel complex was surrounded by the reservation and received numerous services from the tribe. The District Court granted summary judgment to the tribe and the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.Atkinson, 532 U.S. at 647-49; Jacob T. Levy, Three perversities of Indian law, in 148, 154 (Lisa Ford & Tim Rowse eds. 2012); , at 256.  Supreme Court  Chief Justice William Rehnquist delivered the opinion of a unanimous court. Rehnquist stated that while Indian tribes have unique attributes of sovereignty over both their members and their territory, they do not have civil authority past those limits, with minor exceptions. The tribe's imposition of a tax upon nonmembers on non-Indian fee land within the reservation was presumptively invalid without establishing that the tax was related to a consensual relationship with Atkinson.Atkinson, 532 U.S. at 659.  Subsequent developments  The decision appeared to defy established Indian law, and significantly affected the ability of a tribe to build a significant tax base. The ruling significantly affected the Navajo's revenue in a negative manner. Although they still provided services, tax revenue had dropped from $1,167,000 to $881,000 in 2001. The tribe now requires a consent to taxes clause in all contracts., 11 (2009); Sarah Krakoff, Healing the West with Taxes: The Navajo Nation and the Enactment of Sovereignty, in 27, 43 (Patricia Nelson Limerick, Andrew Cowell, & Sharon K.

Biography  Kent was born of poor, religious parents in Devonshire, and was apprenticed to his father, a shipwright. He began to write verse in his youth, and worked hard to educate himself despite limited opportunities.Miller, Josiah. Singers and Songs of the Church. Longmans, Green and Co., 1869, p. 333-4. His hymns are first known to have been published in 1799 in Samuel Reece's A Selection of Evangelical Hymns,John Kent - Hymnary. <http://www.hymnary.org/person/Kent_J1?sort=asc‚Ñ¥=Instances> compiled for the Barrack-Street Baptist congregation near Plymouth Dockyard, where he and his father worked. The first collection composed entirely of John Kent's hymns was his Original Gospel Hymns, published in 1803; though he gained a reputation as a hymnist, he continued as a shipbuilder, writing hymns as his work allowed. His collection passed through ten editions between 1803 and 1861, being expanded with new material as it became available. Kent became blind by 60 years of age, and mostly ceased authoring new hymns until his death seventeen years later in 1843. His last words were \\"I am accepted.\\"  Character of his works  The simplicity and force of Kent's hymns' expression of Calvinism has limited their adoption outside a narrow segment of Christian churches, but they have been fairly broadly employed in various Predestinarian Baptist churches, with 51 of them contained in William Gadsby's A Selection of Hymns for Public Worship and twelve in Charles Spurgeon's Our Own Hymn Book. His most frequently-printed hymns include \\"What Cheering Words Are These\\", \\"O Thou, Before Whose Gracious Throne\\", \\"On Zion's Glorious Summit Stood\\", and \\"Where Two or Three Together Meet\\".

He is also the former President of Tanganyika Law Society (TLS), the bar association of Tanzania mainland, and Chief Legal Officer for Tanzanian opposition party CHADEMA.  Biography = Early life  Lissu was born in Mahambe village in Ikungi District Tanzania. He attended Ilboru Secondary School in 1983.

Tundu Lissu addressing the parliament of Tanzania in Dodoma. Lissu in Kibaigwa, Dodoma during 2015 General Elections Campaign. Lissu began his career in public interest advocacy. He worked with the Lawyers Environmental Action Team (LEAT) and the World Resources Institute as a lawyer and worked on various land rights issues with regards to protected areas and mining. Lissu entered politics in 2010 by winning the Member of Parliament seat for Singida East. Over the years Lissu has built a reputation as a prominent lawyer, fierce opposition figure and outspoken government critic, especially with his repeated confrontations with the government in President Magufuli's tenure in the country. Lissu was responsible for the research and preparation of the document that revealed the involvement of the state's high ranking officials in plundering of public funds, famously known as the 'List of Shame'. The fierce lawmaker has been arrested at least six times in 2017 alone, accused of insulting the president and disturbing public order, among other charges. On 23 August 2017 his home was searched by the police after he was arrested and questioned over allegations of sedition and insulting President John Magufuli, calling him a 'petty dictator'. His arrest came after he revealed to the public that a plane bought for the national carrier had been impounded in Canada over unpaid government debts  Assassination attempt and exile  Tundu Lissu is with wife Alicia in Belgium, where he is undergoing treatment and rehabilitation. In the afternoon of September 7 2017 during a parliamentary session break, Tundu Lissu, whilst in his car, was shot multiple times and seriously injured by unknown assailants in the parking lot of his parliamentary residence in Area D, Dodoma. This happened merely weeks after Lissu declared publicly that certain people instructed by IGP Sirro had been stalking him for weeks. Tundu Lissu received emergency treatment for some hours at Dodoma General Hospital before, in fear of his safety, was air-lifted to Aga Khan Hospital in Nairobi, Kenya where he was hospitalized for months before being flown to Belgium to undergo further treatment and rehabilitation . He was hospitalized at the Leuven University Hospital in Gasthuisberg, where he has reportedly undergone nineteen (19) operations to date. Lissu's party officials openly addressed their concerns to the public and to President Magufuli, who is also Chairman of the nation's ruling party CCM, that the attempt on Lissu's life was politically motivated and just another retaliation on the lawmaker's repeated run-ins with the government. While President Magufuli condemned the attack, he was 'shocked' and 'saddened' by the shooting and was praying for Lissu's 'quick recovery', a number of Tanzanian politicians have aired their comments on the attack, with CHADEMA Chairman Freeman Mbowe and opposition figure Zitto Kabwe hinting on the necessity of having a foreign body man the investigation on the brutal attack. No one was convicted for the attack on his life. On 27 July 2020, Lissu returned to Tanzania after three years in exile to contest in the general elections.https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/07/election-race-heats-tundu- lissu-returns-tanzania-200728061433202.html  Presidential aspirations  Lissu returned to Tanzania from exile to be able to contest in the Tanzanian general elections.

Although he wrote on Shakespeare and other subjects, his most successful work was his 1862 book The New Forest: its History and its Scenery, which describes the scenery, the natural history, the antiquities, and the dialect of the New Forest, in Hampshire, England. Life Wise was born in 1831, and was the eldest son of John Robert Wise, (a former British consul- general in Sweden) and his wife Jane. He attended Grantham Grammar School, and then in 1849 enrolled at Lincoln College, Oxford. He took no degree, and left the university to travel abroad. On returning to England he wandered through country districts, frequently changing his residence.\\"Wise, John Richard de Capel\\", Dictionary of National Biography, 1885‚Äì1900, Volume 62 Wise held radical views on religion and politics. According to his friend, Walter Crane, Wise was intended for the Church, but he left Oxford and quarrelled with his parents \\"on account of his free opinions.\\"\\"Wise, John Richard de Capel\\" entry in A Biographical Dictionary of Modern Rationalists, 1920. He came to know John Chapman, editor of the Westminster Review. For many years he wrote the section on Belles-Lettres in that magazine, but withdrew suddenly owing to political differences with Chapman. His relations with the Westminster brought him the acquaintance of George Henry Lewes and George Eliot. Subsequently he was a contributor to The Reader, a weekly periodical which also advocated advanced views. He was a correspondent for a London paper during the Franco- Prussian War in 1870. Wise never married. He was resident in the New Forest in the early 1860s which allowed him to research and write his book on the locality, but by the summer of 1863 he was residing in lodgings near Hathersage in the Peak District.Walter Crane (1907), An artist's reminiscences pages 73‚Äì4. Macmillan He hoped to write a book on the Peak District, similar to the one he had written for the New Forest but did not receive sufficient encouragement to go on with the work. By 1875 he was settled at Sandsend, near Whitby. Some years later he had migrated to Edwinstowe, Nottinghamshire. He visited Lyndhurst in the New Forest in August 1889, and being in a weak state of health he remained there through the winter.Obituary in The Hampshire Antiquary and Naturalist, Volume 1, (1890), page 67 He died on 1 April 1890, aged 59, and was buried in Lyndhurst cemetery. Writings His first work was a pamphlet of poems called Robin Hood published in 1855. In 1860 he issued a novel in two volumes called The Cousin's Courtship with little success. Following repeated visits to Stratford-upon-Avon he published (1861) a volume on Shakspere: his Birthplace and its Neighbourhood. The book contained a description of the local scenery, the natural history, the literary associations and dialect of Stratford-on-Avon. In 1862 he wrote The New Forest: its History and its Scenery. The book contained sixty-two illustrations drawn by Walter Crane and engraved by William James Linton. Wise walked through the district with Walter Crane selecting the views to illustrate. This would prove to be Wise's most successful book, and it went through five editions up to 1895. The most sought after edition by collectors was the \\"artist's edition\\" of 1883, to which Heywood Sumner added twelve etchings, and which had Linton's woodcuts mounted on India paper.Obituary in The Academy (1890), Volume 37, page 267 In 1881 he anonymously published an elaborate volume called The First of May: a fairy Masque, which he dedicated to Charles Darwin. The text, a collection of lyrics from Wise's pen, was illustrated with fifty-two pictures by Walter Crane. The book was financially unsuccessful.

They are typically constructed to fit into a 19-inch rack although there are manufacturers who offer a KVM that can be mounted to a flat surface such as a control console. Etymology KVMs did not exist until the advent of the LCD computer monitor. Prior to the introduction of the KVM, there existed rack-mounted CRT monitors and separate rack-mounted keyboards and mice. With the introduction of the LCD computer monitor, it became possible to combine the display with the keyboard and pointing device into a 1U, 2U or 3U rackmount form factor to create the KVM. Ibus, a now defunct computer company, secured patent US5388032, filed May 4, 1993, showing a KVM with a \\"discriminator\\" to connect to multiple computers. The \\"discriminator\\" is now known as a KVM switch. Designs There are two basic designs for KVMs: clamshell and lay-flat. A Clamshell design hinges the display at the rear so that it folds forward over the keyboard for storage. The advantage to this design is shorter installed depth. The disadvantage is the 1U thickness of the assembly limits the available height for the keyboard and track-ball (if installed). Some KVMs have been designed to fit into 2U to allow a larger track-ball and full-travel keyboard to be installed. A Lay-flat design hinges the display at the front edge of the display so that the display folds back. The advantage to this design is the full 1U height can be used for keyboard and track-ball height. The disadvantage is a much greater installed depth. A design variation provides for a slim profile keyboard mounted in independent slides under the display and the display is hinged and mounted at the front of the unit. This allows the display to be deployed with the keyboard stowed so it does not protrude into aisle space. The display, when tilted upright, may only protrude an inch or so, effectively flush with the front of the rack. The keyboard can then be pulled out, used, and pushed back into the rack. These units still fit within 1U with a short installed depth. The disadvantage in this design is typically a laptop style keyboard will be used with limited keystroke. Signals Input signals can be anything supported by the installed LCD controller and includes, but is not limited to, VGA, DVI-D, DVI-I, HDMI, Display Port, Video (Composite, HD-SDI) and so forth. The form factor will also support non-traditional video and keyboard/mouse signals such as KVM over IP, depending on the installed control circuitry. Output from the keyboard and pointing device can be either PS/2 or USB, or both, or can be routed through KVM over IP or similar technology. LCD size limitation Due to width limitations of a 19-inch rack (approximately 17.75\\" between the inside rails), the largest LCD to be incorporated into a KVM was 20.1\\" with a 3:4 aspect ratio. A wide-format 16:9 or 16:10 20.1\\" display is too wide. It had been previously reported that LG, the last manufacturer for this form factor display, announced the product was End Of Life (EOL) in 2013. However, Sharp Electronics has introduced a new 20.1\\" display as of 2 December 2014. The most common LCD sizes currently in production are 15\\", 17\\", 19\\" and 20\\". Multi-display rackmount lay-flat KVM with three 17-inch LCDs Multi- display KVMs Several manufacturers have released KVM models providing two or three displays in a 2U or 3U height. Pointing device (mouse) A wide variety of pointing devices are available to provide mouse functionality. Many keyboards include pointing devices such as a small trackball, touch pad, joy stick (Hulapoint), or pointing stick. Similar pointing devices are available as stand-alone modules and can be installed separately from the keyboard. In a lay-flat design, there is sufficient height in a 1U design to install a larger 1-1/2\\" trackball and larger trackballs in the KVMs which are 2U in height. Some manufacturers have made provision for using a true mouse by providing a location for storage and a flat surface to use it on. Built-in KVM switch Many KVMs are offered with a built-in KVM switch allowing the one KVM to control a number of connected computers without using an external KVM switch. The KVM switch can be controlled either by on-screen menus, hot-key commands, or, on some KVM models, via front accessible push buttons.

More than the smart production, Fuego is a standout in Phish's sometimes less-than- impressive studio catalog on the strengths of its ten stellar tracks, inspired tunes that share a loose thread as they bound between virtuosic playing, flirtations with gospel and funk, and the kind of eclectic rock jamming Phish have made their name on.... With sharp production and some of the better compositions Phish have managed in ages, Fuego ranks among their best studio albums, capturing strands of the frenetic, cartoonish, darkly cautionary, and open-hearted expressions that make their concerts such moving experiences, but which often get lost when the tape starts rolling.\\"Thomas, Fred. Fuego, AllMusic. Retrieved June 27, 2014. On Consequence of Sound, Jake Cohen wrote, \\"... we must judge Fuego on its ability to stand alone as a work of studio art. On that merit, it has much to applaud.

Like the compositions themselves, the brilliance of Ezrin‚Äôs work here is in the nuances.... Thankfully, this album's shortcomings are not due to a drying up of creativity or motivation.... Phish wrote most of these songs together, while the basic rhythms and progressions come directly from some of their best recent concert jams.

It has an area of about 50 km¬≤.  Geography  The Diemerstein Forest lies in the north of the Palatine Forest, north of the hamlet of Diemerstein, which belongs to the municipality of Frankenstein (Enkenbach-Alsenborn collective municipality, Kaiserslautern district). The Autobahn 6 motorway from Saarbr√ºcken to Mannheim runs for just under 10 km through the northern part of the forest, reaching its highest point at 403 metres above sea level (NN) for this section. The forest is bounded roughly by the B 37 federal highway from Kaiserslautern to Bad D√ºrkheim in the south, by the B 48 from Rockenhausen to Annweiler in the west and by the Landesstra√üe 395 state road, that links Enkenbach-Alsenborn and Gr√ºnstadt, in the north. In the east near Carlsberg the Diemerstein Forest has not visible boundary with other parts of the Palatine Forest. The settlements of Hochspeyer in the southwest, Enkenbach-Alsenborn in the northwest and Carlsberg in the northeast form a triangle that roughly encloses the Diemerstein Forest. Elevations generally range between 300 and 450 metres. Amongst the most important hills are the Kieskautberg (461 m), the Krummes Eck (449 m) and die Hohe B√ºhl (443 m), on which are the sources of both the Eisbach (north flank) and the Isenach (south flank). The watershed between the northern catchment area of the Eisbach und Eckbach and the southern catchment of the Isenach und Speyerbach (Hochspeyerbach) runs over the Krummes Eck in the west via the Hohe B√ºhl in the north and the Kieskautberg in the east.  History  Above the hamlet of Diemerstein lie the ruins of the eponymous castle, which is first recorded in 1216. In 1521, during the Reformation period, the knight Ulrich von Hutten lived here. The present Diemerstein Forest is, in large part, identical with the forest estate of the ords of the castle and hence bore their name.

He is considered to be one of the fathers of developmental cognitive neuroscience. Work He discovered that synapses are created in the first few months of a child's development, and then \\"pruned\\", by examining the brains of about 50 people, mostly infants and young children who had died unexpectedly, but also a few adults, one of them age 90. Using an electron microscope to count image samples of material, and then manually counting the synapses, he showed that synaptic density was low at birth, about 2,500 connections per neuron. It increased rapidly to levels 50 to 60 percent above adult levels, and then gradually declined, falling to typical adult values. He had originally intended to study defective parts of the brain, but found that: \\"Paradoxically, in our early studies, the findings in the normal population were more interesting than the abnormal population.\\" The individuals with intellectual disability he studied were discovered to have the same number of synapses as those without, but of a different shape. This \\"pruning\\" mechanism removes redundant connections in the brain. Huttenlocher found that in individuals with intellectual disabilities, this mechanism works differently. Huttenlocher also became an early authority on Reye's syndrome, and in 1987 launched the first clinic in the United States for children with tuberous sclerosis. His findings have influenced government policy and parents‚Äô priorities, putting more emphasis on the importance of early education. He correlated the acquisition of skills and the development of the parts of the brain associated with them. Personal life Huttenlocher was born in Oberlahnstein bei Koblenz on 23 February 1931. His parents became divorced when he was young, and his mother, Else, an opera singer, refused to join the Nazi Party and fled to the United States in 1937. Peter and his brothers were raised by their father, Richard, who was a chemist. The experience of growing up under Nazism contributed to his lifelong interest in ethics and morality. He travelled in 1949 to the United States with his older brother Dieter to meet his mother, and decided to stay. He met his future wife Janellen Huttenlocher (n√©e Burns) (February 17, 1932 - November 20, 2016) at the University of Buffalo in New York, from where he graduated summa cum laude in philosophy in 1953. He married Janellen a year later, and moved with her to Harvard University, where she obtained a Phd in Psychology and he his MD, magna cum laude, from Harvard Medical School in 1957. After an internship at Harvard‚Äôs Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, he completed his residency at Boston Children's Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), followed by research fellowships at the National Institutes of Health and MGH. He was an assistant professor in pediatric neurology at Harvard from 1964 to 1966, followed by eight years at Yale School of Medicine. In 1974, he moved with Janellen to the University of Chicago as a professor of pediatrics, adding neurology in 1976. He stayed for almost 30 years, the remainder of his career, shifting to emeritus status in 2003. Huttenlocher enjoyed classical music, and played the flute, as well as gardening and baking. He died of pneumonia and complications of Parkinson's disease on 15 August 2013 in Chicago. He is survived by his wife and three children, and four grandchildren. Publications He published more than 80 papers on a wide variety of topics related to the development of the brain in children.

The ZNG placed the JNA-held Logori≈°te barracks under a blockade as part of the countrywide Battle of the Barracks, which aimed to pin down JNA units isolated in their bases and force them to surrender weapons and ammunition to the ZNG. However, the JNA garrison broke out from the besieged barracks with part of its stored equipment before the ZNG claimed the vacant base. The breakout was supported by JNA units and SAO Krajina units deployed to lift the blockade of the barracks and other JNA garrisons in Karlovac. A battle ensued as the ZNG attempted to contain advancing JNA units, ending with a ceasefire signed in The Hague. Although both sides claimed victory, neither achieved all their objectives; the JNA garrison evacuated the Logori≈°te barracks, but Croatian defences elsewhere held. Particularly heavy fighting was reported in the Karlovac suburb of Turanj, identified as the primary axis of the JNA effort. While the JNA removed some weapons and equipment stored in the Logori≈°te barracks, the remaining supplies were removed by the ZNG over a one-week period after the battle. Background In 1990, after the electoral defeat of the government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, ethnic tensions between Croats and Croatian Serbs worsened. The Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija ‚Äì JNA) confiscated the Croatian Territorial Defence Force's (Teritorijalna obrana ‚Äì TO) weapons to minimize resistance. On 17 August, tensions escalated into an open revolt by the Croatian Serbs centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin, parts of Lika, Kordun, Banovina and Slavonia. After two unsuccessful attempts by Serbia (supported by Montenegro and the Serbian provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo) to obtain the Yugoslav Presidency's approval for a JNA operation to disarm Croatian security forces in January 1991‚Äîand a bloodless skirmish between Serb insurgents and Croatian special police in March‚Äîthe JNA, supported by Serbia and its allies, asked the federal presidency for wartime powers and the declaration of a state of emergency. The request was denied on 15 March, and the JNA came under the control of Serbian President Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá. Milo≈°eviƒá, preferring a campaign to expand Serbia rather than preserve Yugoslavia, publicly threatened to replace the JNA with a Serbian army and declared that he no longer recognized the authority of the federal presidency. The threat caused the JNA to gradually abandon plans to preserve Yugoslavia in favour of Serbian expansion. By the end of March the conflict escalated with its first fatalities, during the Plitvice Lakes incident. The JNA stepped in, supporting the insurgents and preventing the Croatian police from intervening. In early April, leaders of the Serb revolt in Croatia declared their intention to integrate the area under their control with Serbia; this was seen by the Croatian government as an intention to secede from Croatia. At the beginning of 1991 Croatia had no regular army, and in an effort to bolster its defence the country doubled its police force to about 20,000. The force's most effective component was its 3,000-strong special police, deployed in 12 battalions with a military structure. There were also a 9,000‚Äì10,000-strong regionally-organized reserve police, grouped into 16 battalions and 10 companies. The reserve police carried only small arms, and a portion of the force was unarmed. Although the Croatian government responded in May by forming the Croatian National Guard (Zbor narodne garde ‚Äì ZNG), its development was hampered by a United Nations arms embargo introduced in September. On 12 September the ZNG was ordered to blockade all JNA facilities it could reach, beginning the Battle of the Barracks. Prelude In late September and early October 1991, the blockade of JNA barracks in and around Karlovac and Croatian defences in the city were maintained by about 900 police and ZNG troops. The troops were assigned to the 110th Infantry Brigade and the under-strength 3rd Battalion of the 2nd Guards Brigade. The 110th Infantry Brigade, at one-third of its planned strength due to poor organisation and a shortage of weapons, was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Rudolf Brleƒçiƒá. The JNA's Stjepan Mila≈°inƒçiƒá-Seljo barracks in Logori≈°te, south of Karlovac, was one of the largest weapons-storage facilities in Croatia. The barracks contained weapons and equipment for the 8th Proletarian Motorised Brigade, the 471st Mixed Antitank Artillery Brigade, elements of the logistics battalion of the 580th Mixed Artillery Brigade, an armoured battalion of the 236th Proletarian Motorised Brigade and 200 tonnes of fuel and stockpiled food assigned to the 944th Logistics Base. During the summer of 1990, a mechanised battalion of the 4th Armoured Brigade was moved from Jastrebarsko to the Logori≈°te barracks. When the battalion was deployed to Lika in late March 1991, about 40 men remained at the barracks (whose fortifications were improved). The barracks commander was Lieutenant Colonel Boro Ercegovac, who was also commanding officer of the 8th Proletarian Motorised Brigade. The 1st Battalion of the ZNG's 110th Infantry Brigade blockaded the barracks on 19 September to contain the JNA and prevent the removal of weapons. The blockade was poorly organised, allowing a pair of tanks to leave the barracks and raid a nearby settlement two days later; however, according to Croatian sources one tank was destroyed during the raid. To relieve blockaded garrisons in the Karlovac area the JNA redeployed the 169th Motorised Brigade from Loznica and three detachments of the TO from Vojniƒá, assigning them to Operational Group 1 (OG-1). OG-1 attacked Croatian defences on 4 October, reaching the east bank of the Korana River on 8 October. The 169th Motorised Brigade collapsed due to inadequate manpower, and was replaced by the 9th Motorised Brigade (brought in from Serbia) on 15 October. Order of battle According to the JNA an additional 450 troops were deployed to the barracks (despite the blockade) from 22 October to 4 November, primarily tank crews assigned to the 9th Motorised Brigade and two companies of SAO Krajina TO from Vojniƒá. The reinforcements crossed the Korana River, adjacent to the barracks, and their movements led to several skirmishes. By 4 November, the barracks housed a 685-strong garrison. During the second half of October, the 129th and 137th Infantry Brigades were established in Karlovac and nearby Duga Resa to bolster Croatian defences. The two new brigades were assigned areas of responsibility (AORs) on 29 November by the Karlovac Operational Zone commanding officer, Colonel Izidor ƒåe≈°njaj; the 110th and 137th Brigade AORs were just south of the Logori≈°te barracks. The 137th Infantry Brigade was commanded by Major Nedjeljko Katu≈°in. The 110th Infantry Brigade deployed three companies of its 1st Battalion north and west of the Logori≈°te barracks, while three companies of its 3rd Battalion were deployed south of the barracks. Further south, three companies of the 3rd Battalion of the 137th Infantry Brigade faced the Korana. The 1/110th Brigade was supported by two companies of police (including an antitank and sniper group of special police reserve troops commanded by ≈Ωelimir Feitl) in Sv. Doroteja, north of the barracks. The 3/137th Brigade was supported by an additional company of police. The 3rd Battalion of the 2nd Guards Brigade was ordered to redeploy to Banovina; most of its troops were on leave or had left the area, and only a squad remained in the rear of the 137th Infantry Brigade. Timeline Map of the battle The JNA 5th Military District command instructed OG-1 to relieve blockaded JNA garrisons in the Karlovac and Zagreb areas. During the first stage of the advance, OG-1 intended to reach the Kupa River via Turanj (breaking through the ZNG positions) while the second stage relieved JNA garrisons blockaded in Karlovac. On 2 November OG-1 began artillery bombardment in the Karlovac area, forcing the 2nd Battalion of the 110th Infantry Brigade to abandon its positions in Turanj the following day. The abandoned defences were occupied by elements of the brigade's 1st Battalion. On 3 November, the ZNG was renamed the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska ‚Äì HV). OG-1 supplemented its orders with instructions to capture the village of Bariloviƒá and its surroundings (south of the Logori≈°te barracks) to facilitate the evacuation of the barracks. Anticipating the JNA advance, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Croatia instructed the Karlovac Operational Zone and the 110th Infantry Brigade to capture the Logori≈°te and Jamadol barracks and secure ammunition for HV (whose stock was dwindling). Brleƒçiƒá ordered the police force, commanded by Feitl, to capture the barracks that night; Feitl refused, and the order was rescinded by ƒåe≈°njaj. The JNA artillery bombarded Karlovac during the night of 3‚Äì4 November. 4 November The breakout from the Logori≈°te barracks began on 4 November at 7:30 a.m., after an hour-long artillery bombardment and airstrikes on battalion and company command posts. The JNA simultaneously attacked HV defences at Turanj (further north), threatening Karlovac. The breakout was commanded by the OG-1 chief of staff, Colonel Mirko Rakoviƒá. While most of the JNA garrison in the Logori≈°te barracks remained in place, a group of 10 to 16 tanks deployed south (without significant resistance) toward the villages of Belajske Poljice and Belaj. The armoured force went through Belaj before it was stopped at Gornji Velemeriƒá and about north of the village of Carevo Selo by elements of the 2nd Guards Brigade and the 137th Infantry Brigade. The JNA force retreated to Belaj after losing two tanks, mounting another attack on the road to Bariloviƒá. The four tanks dispatched to Bariloviƒá were also stopped by 137th Brigade troops before reaching their objective. By evening the 137th Infantry Brigade was reinforced by two companies redeployed from Generalski Stol and Erdelj, elements of the 3rd Battalion of the 2nd Guards Brigade, one tank, three armoured personnel carriers (APCs) and an antitank missile system to contain the JNA advance. During the night of 4‚Äì5 November, the civilian population was evacuated. A secondary force of four JNA tanks, supported by infantry, was deployed from the Logori≈°te barracks to secure high ground north and east of the barracks and protect the flank of the armoured force in Belaj. According to the HV, advancing troops were met by the 2nd Company of the 3rd Battalion of the 110th Brigade (supported by a T-55 tank) in Mala Vinica after the JNA force secured its immediate objectives. The JNA lost three tanks and a truck in the clash. According to them one tank was destroyed and another damaged, forcing the remaining two to retreat to the barracks. The secondary force was limited to within from Belajske Poljice after the HV secured Vinica Hill, which was attacked by a Yugoslav Air Force Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 at 2:00 p.m. The Karlovac Operational Zone did not assist the 137th Infantry Brigade, instead directing subordinated units to lift JNA sieges of Slunj and Saborsko and securing the Karlovac‚ÄìSlunj road. This prompted Katu≈°in to request help from Zagreb Operational Zone commander Colonel Stjepan Mate≈°a. Mate≈°a, a native of Duga Resa, ordered the 7th Brigade of the Croatian TO to deploy a battalion to Karlovac. Although the General Staff approved the order (instructing the 8th Brigade of the Croatian TO to add one of its battalions), no 8th Brigade troops were sent. 5 November The JNA, warned about reinforcements to the 137th Infantry Brigade, abandoned its plan to advance to Bariloviƒá. It reoriented its efforts to reach the Korana Bridge in the village of Maliƒái, down the road from Gornji Velemeriƒá and Carevo Selo (where its tanks were stopped the day before). The battle resumed in the morning when JNA tanks (supported by the Yugoslav Air Force, artillery and multiple rocket launchers) broke through positions held by the 2nd Guards Brigade at 1:00 p.m., reaching Carevo Selo before they were stopped again by the HV. Shortly afterwards, the 2nd Battalion of the 7th Brigade arrived from Zagreb to Duga Resa and were attached to the 137th Infantry Brigade. One company of the battalion was deployed to Vinica Hill, and a second was deployed west of Carevo Selo (where it relieved troops from the 2nd Guards Brigade). The 110th Infantry Brigade assigned secondary importance to the fighting around the Logori≈°te barracks, since it was struggling to hold its positions at Turanj (where the HV estimated a two-battalion-strong attack was in progress, with artillery and air support). At 5:00 a.m. the Vinica Hill positions were reinforced by the Sports Company (composed of Zagreb University Faculty of Kinesiology students) and a platoon of mortars attached to the 3rd Battalion of the 110th Infantry Brigade. The battalion was tasked with blocking the Logori≈°te‚ÄìBelajske Poljice road leading south from the Logori≈°te barracks and capturing Belajske Poljice by noon. Since there were only 40 trained drivers in the Logori≈°te barracks, Boro Ercegovac ordered soldiers who had never operated military vehicles to drive in a column starting from the barracks under fire at 3:30 p.m. As the column advanced south towards Maliƒái, elements of the 110th Infantry Brigade retreated from the village of Zastinja (on the right bank of the Korana River). The evacuating JNA column sustained casualties, although it was supported by the 9th Motorised Brigade and two detachments of the SAO Krajina TO from Vojniƒá. The SAO Krajina TO were later accused of killing civilians in the area. 6 November During the night of 5‚Äì6 November, fighting died down after a ceasefire was brokered in The Hague. The lull was used by the 137th Infantry Brigade to extract its encircled troops and civilians near the Korana River, east of Maliƒái. The JNA column began moving south again at dawn; it reached Maliƒái at about 9:00 a.m., crossed the Korana River (over the village bridge and a pontoon bridge) by 11:00 and proceeded to Vojniƒá. Shortly afterwards, the Logori≈°te barracks and its surroundings were secured by the HV. Aftermath T-34 tank destroyed in fighting near Karlovac Both sides claimed victory after the battle, with the JNA hailing the evacuation of the garrison as its greatest success. However, they achieved only part of their objectives; the JNA failed to secure the area surrounding the barracks or remove all the weapons and equipment in it, and the planned coordinated advance against Turanj also failed. Croatian forces failed in their primary objective: containing the garrison. Nonetheless, the JNA threat from the Logori≈°te barracks was removed (freeing up forces assigned to the blockade of the barracks) and a large number of weapons were captured. The 137th Infantry Brigade had 17 fatalities in the battle, and the 2nd Guards Brigade had one. The 110th Infantry Brigade had 14 killed and 26 wounded, but the brigade sustained most of its casualties at Turanj rather than Logori≈°te. The JNA had 14 dead and 33 wounded troops. In addition, 14 civilians were killed and 14 captured and held by the JNA and the SAO Krajina TO. One prisoner died in captivity, and the remainder were later exchanged. Seven of the exchanged prisoners had been severely injured, and died shortly after the exchange. The Central Intelligence Agency estimated that the JNA lost most of its tanks which had been housed in the Logori≈°te barracks. The JNA evacuated 21 T-55 tanks, nine T-34s, an armoured recovery vehicle, an armoured vehicle-launched bridge, ten APCs (including an armoured command vehicle) and 50 vehicles carrying military equipment. Elements of the 110th Infantry Brigade entered the Logori≈°te barracks on the morning of 6 November, removing some of the military hardware in the barracks before pulling out at 1:00 p.m. after being informed that the JNA was planning an artillery attack. Captured equipment continued to be removed from the barracks until 13 November. Command-system failure The destruction of property caused outrage in Duga Resa, largely directed at Nedjeljko Katu≈°in (who fled for his life to Karlovac and then to Zagreb Operational Zone headquarters on the morning of 6 November). The 110th Infantry Brigade blamed the 137th Brigade for all mistakes, including the breakout from the barracks (which occurred in the brigade's AOR). Izidor ƒåe≈°njaj also blamed Katu≈°in. However, Katu≈°in was supported by the General Staff and was soon appointed commanding officer of the 140th Infantry Brigade based in Jastrebarsko. In fact, Croatian command and control systems failed (especially the Karlovac Operational Zone command, in the immediate vicinity of the battlefield). Communications were poor, and the zone command issued no instructions to the troops fighting near Logori≈°te. The 110th Infantry Brigade was focused on the fighting at Turanj, paying little attention to Logori≈°te, and the 137th Infantry Brigade made poor use of reinforcements deployed from Zagreb. The JNA command was more effective, probably because of the proximity of its command post on ≈†anac Hill, away (permitting direct observation of part of the battlefield). War crimes trial Croatian authorities charged two former members of the SAO Krajina TO with shooting two HV soldiers who had tried to surrender to the JNA on 4 November. One of the two was arrested in October 2010, and was convicted and sentenced to nine years in prison in November 2013.

He was one of the leading two-year-old in Britain in 2013 when he won the Champagne Stakes and was placed in both the Vintage Stakes and the Dewhurst Stakes. In November he was sent to the United States where he won the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Turf. Background Outstrip is a grey colt bred by the Darley Stud. He was sired by the Australian stallion Exceed and Excel, whose other European progeny have included the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes winner Excelebration. Outstrip's dam, Asi Siempre, from whom he inherited his grey colour, was a top class American racemare whose wins included the Spinster Stakes. The colt was sent into training with Mahmood Al Zarooni at Godolphin's British base at Moulton Paddocks, in Newmarket, but the stable was taken over by Charlie Appleby when Zarooni was banned after a doping scandal. Racing career=2013: two-year-old season Outstrip was ridden in all his European races by Mickael Barzalona. He made his racecourse debut in a seven furlong maiden race at Newmarket Racecourse on 22 June. He was made the 4/1 third favourite in a field of twelve runners and recovered from a slow start to win by one and a half lengths from True Story. The colt was then moved up sharply in class for the Group Three Vintage Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse on 31 July. He took the lead a furlong from the finish but was overtaken in the final strides and was beaten a neck by the Richard Hannon, Sr.-trained favourite Toormore. Outsrip's next race was the Group Two Champagne Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse on 14 September. He started slowly but accelerated in the last quarter mile to take the lead a furlong from the finish and won by three lengths and a head from The Grey Gatsby and Cable Bay at odds of 13/8. Barzalona described the winner as \\"a nice horse who will improve for this race. He will be a serious horse next year.\\" After the race bookmakers offered the horse at odds of 20/1 for the following year's 2000 Guineas. On 12 October, Outsrip contested Britain's most prestigious two-year-old race, the Group One Dewhurst Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket. He started the 15/8 second favourite behind the Aidan O'Brien-trained War Command. Barzalona settled the colt behind the leaders but was unable to make significant progress in the closing stages and finished third behind War Command and Cable Bay. On his final appearance of the season, Outstrip was sent to California to contest the Grade I Breeders' Cup Juvenile Turf over one mile at Santa Anita Park. Ridden by the American veteran Mike Smith (Barzalona was committed to ride for Godolphin in Japan) he came from well off the pace to win from Giovanni Boldini and Bobby's Kitten. In the official ratings published in January 2014, Outstrip was rated the sixth-best European two-year-old of 2013, five pounds behind of the Toormore. 2014: three-year-old season On his first appearance as a three-year-old, Outstrip started at odds of 25/1 for the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket on 3 May. He was held up in the early stages and after struggling to obtain a clear run in the final quarter mile he was eased down and finished last of the fourteen runners behind Night of Thunder. After his poor run at Newmarket, Outstrip started a 33/1 outsider for the St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot. Ridden for the first time by William Buick he produced a much better effort to finish third, beaten two and a quarter lengths and a length by Kingman and Night of Thunder, despite his jockey dropping his whip a furlong from the finish. In the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood on 30 July Outstrip started at odds of 20/1 and finished last of the four runners behind Kingman, Toronado and Darwin. Pedigree Outsrip is inbred 4 x 4 x 4 to Northern Dancer. This means that the stallion appears three times in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

From c. 1604 he attended school at Medebach in the Duchy of Westphalia; as a Protestant, he moved to Sachsenhausen in the Duchy of Waldeck in 1606. He spent several years in Wildungen and Korbach before enrolling at the Soest Archigymnasium. He attended the University of Giessen from 1615 to 1620 before serving as tutor to Prince Charles Ludwig of Pfalz-Veldenz until 1623. Subsequently, he studied at Strasbourg, obtaining his doctoral degree on November 4, 1626 with a study of fideicommissa. He became engaged to Elisabeth Kreidenmann from Esslingen that same year.

The contemporary historian Niketas Choniates describes him as a brave, audacious and experienced soldier but frequently led astray by his foolhardiness and presumption.  Life  He was one of the victims of the reign of terror unleashed by the usurper Andronikos I Komnenos (reigned 1183‚Äì1185) in 1183, who had him blinded, though possibly not completely, then thrown into prison, because he attacked a court eunuch who blamed the disasters befalling the empire on the incompetence of Andronikos' predecessor, his under-age nephew Alexios II Komnenos (). Donald Nicol argues this shows he was a partisan of the House of Angelos, and he had his reward when Isaac II Angelos () came to the throne in 1185: the new emperor give him the rank of Caesar and appointed him to command the expedition against the Bulgarians in 1186, who had recently rebelled against the Byzantine rule and had restored the Bulgarian Empire. The rebels did not oppose the Byzantines in the open field, and instead retired to their mountain stronghold. John followed them there, but due to his overconfidence neglected to fortify his camp and allowed it to be surrounded, suffering a humiliating defeat. His robes of office were captured and displayed by the Bulgarian leaders Peter and Asen. John was relieved of command by the Emperor in favour of Alexios Branas, and lived in retirement. He married Irene Angelina, daughter of Andronikos Doukas Angelos and sister of the emperors Isaac II and Alexios III Angelos (). The marriage was first disallowed by the Patriarch of Constantinople, Luke Chrysoberges, and the then-reigning emperor, Manuel I Komnenos (), because a seventh degree of consanguinity existed between John and Irene. However, in 1185/86, after Isaac Angelos came to power, a synod overthrew Patriarch Basil II Kamateros‚Äîan appointee of Andronikos I‚Äîand the new patriarch, Niketas Mountanes, gave his approval to the marriage. They appear to have had a son, for the man was put forth as a possible candidate to the throne during the illness of Alexios III. John's parents are not known, but he may have been brother to Theodore Kantakouzenos (died 1184), whom Niketas Choniates states was killed assisting Isaac Angelos defend the city of Nicaea against Andronikos Komnenos.

The recruitment was controversial, with several teams and manufacturers ‚Äì particularly Renault ‚Äì expressing concerns that Simon's previous position with the FIA would grant him access to sensitive technical data about engine designs that could potentially be used by PURE in the development of their own engine. Simon and PURE rejected these suggestions, stating that the process of developing the 2014 engine regulations had been transparent, and that all parties involved had access to the same information so that no individual group would have an advantage. PURE used Toyota Motorsport's facilities in Cologne, Germany, whilst also maintaining a French base.

(A) Sampling from habitat; (B) filtering particles, typically by size; (C) Lysis and DNA extraction; (D) cloning and library construction; (E) sequencing the clones; (F) sequence assembly into contigs and scaffolds. Viral metagenomics is the study of viral genetic material sourced directly from the environment rather than from a host or natural reservoir. The goal is to ascertain the viral diversity in the environment that is often missed in studies targeting specific potential reservoirs. It reveals important information on virus evolution and the genetic diversity of the viral community without the need for isolating viral species and cultivating them in the laboratory. With the new techniques available that exploit next-generation sequencing (NGS), it is possible to study the virome of some ecosystems, even if the analysis still has some issues, in particular the lack of universal markers. Some of the first metagenomic studies of viruses were done with ocean samples, and revealed that most of the sequences of DNA and RNA viruses had no matches in databases. Subsequently, some studies about the soil virome were performed with a particular interest on bacteriophages, and it was discovered that there are almost the same number of viruses and bacteria. This approach has created improvements in molecular epidemiology and accelerated the discovery of novel viruses. Acknowledging the importance of viral metagenomics, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) recognizes that genomes assembled from metagenomic data represent actual viruses and encourages their official classification following the same procedures as those used for viruses isolated and characterized using classical virology approaches. The IMG/VR system and the IMG/VR v.2.0 ‚Äì the largest interactive public virus database with over 760,000 metagenomic viral sequences and isolate viruses ‚Äì serves as a starting point for the sequence analysis of viral fragments derived from metagenomic samples. The virus detection method and host assignment approach in IMG/VR is described in a paper discussing Earth's virome and is fully presented as a protocol.  The Global Virome Project  The aim of the Global Virome Project (GVP) is to expand the viral discovery to reduce the risk of harm for new viral large-scale outbreak. It is centered on the massive collection and sequencing of the majority of the planet‚Äôs unknown viruses. In fact, it was estimated that between 631,000 to 827,000 yet-to-be-discovered viral species in animal reservoirs (as mammal and bird host) have a zoonotic potential. Total transparency of the data acquired, and the correlated possible development of some medical products (vaccine) are two main benefits of this project. The main limit of this project is the cost. To analyse the majority of viruses with a zoonotic potential, the total cost has been estimated around $1.2 billion. Another GVP‚Äôs aim is also to improve the possibility to detect with low cost sequencing viruses also in developing countries in order to avoid possible outbreaks. For a worldwide sample collection some network between different agencies and nations must be created. For example, the USAID (agency for international development) EPT (Emerging Pandemic Threats) PREDICT project is included in this plan and it is focused on the study of the biology of some dangerous viruses, such as Ebola, Lassa fever, Rift Valley fever and avian influenza. PREDICT project was founded also to discover new viral species in the animal reservoir host and individuate the main characteristics that can cause the viral transmission to human, to avoid the viral outbreak in the population. Next-generation sequencing can help the massive sequencing of this viral genome samples collected, allowing the increase of speed and efficiency and moreover reducing the cost of sequencing. To validate the possibility for these new-discovered viruses to be transmitted from animal to human, new approaches must be developed for the study of their pathogenicity. The Global Virome Project could help the current pandemic surveillance, diagnosis techniques and prevention strategies, as far as helping for pre-emptive production of vaccine and other countermeasures for candidate high-risk viruses. Another benefit of this research could be a deeper comprehension of the viral biology. Its discovers can be applied not only for medical need, but also in other field as the agricultural and food one, for example to enhance biosecurity of food.  Methods = Metagenomic approach  It is used to sequence all the microbial genomes in a sample by using the Shotgun approach. Its aim is to identify the nucleic acid diversity present in the sample (either DNA, RNA or both, depending on the sequencing method), in order to provide information about features of the viruses within the samples such as drug resistance, viral genotypes and virus epidemiology. The sensitivity of this method is affected by the presence of contaminating nucleic acids from the host and other microorganisms. This method has been used for the sequencing of viruses like Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and HCV. It may be used also to provide information about cancer evolution and integrated virus genomes in cases of virus-associated cancers. This method requires a low number of PCR cycles, so the consequent risk of contamination is decreased. Although no primers or probes are required, the cost to obtain enough data is high. Because this method is agnostic to expected viral content of a sample, it can be used to identify new virus species or divergent members of known species. It therefore has a role in clinical diagnostics, such as identification of pathogens causing encephalitis.  PCR amplicon enrichment  Its aim is to identify the organism and in order to do that, it enriches a portion of the genome of the virus before sequencing. For the amplification it uses specific primers for a highly-conserved target sequence. This method has been used to track Ebola virus and Zika virus during their outbreaks or to sequence the whole genome of HCMV. Another possible application is the monitoring of mutations associated to drug-resistance in order to administer the more efficient drug to the patient. Although this method is cheaper than the metagenomic approach and has a great specificity and sensitivity, it has some limits: it requires many PCR cycles so it can introduce mutations and contaminants and the primers may be subjected to mismatches. Clinical samples may lack sufficient nucleic acid to enable many PCR reactions; this makes PCR amplicon sequencing of viruses more appropriate if the viral genome is small (eg influenza, norovirus or HIV), or if the virus has been cultured to increase the available genomic material.  Target enrichment  It is an overlapping PCR method. It does not require a culture step because it sequences the whole viral genome directly from the clinical sample. Small oligonucleotides, complementary to the target, are used as probes for a hybridization reaction. The probes can be bound to a solid phase or to magnetic beads in liquid phase. Capture is followed by a small number of PCR cycles and shotgun sequencing. This method can be used to compare the genome of healthy cells and of tumor cells in cases of virus-associated cancer. It has been used to characterize HCV, HSV-1, HCMV and other viruses. The presence of overlapping probes increases the tolerance for primer mismatches but their design requires high cost and time so a rapid response is limited.

Judicial campaign complaint against O'Toole Prior to the 2012 election, a close personal friend of her electoral opponent, Mary Jane Trapp, filed a 12-count grievance against O'Toole alleging that she had violated the Ohio Code of Judicial Conduct. Nine of the charges were dismissed at the probable- cause stage. One month before the 2012 election, two of the three remaining violations were found to have merit. Despite this finding O'Toole won the election, resoundingly defeating her opponent, Trapp. O'Toole appealed and in 2014, the Ohio Supreme Court dismissed one of the two remaining counts, finding O'Toole had violated the remaining charge related to a name badge that she wore during the 2012 election. O'Toole relied upon the case of In re Judicial Campaign Grievance Against O'Neill, 132 Ohio St.3d 1472, 2012-Ohio-3223, in asserting her first amendment right to use the honorary title as she had earned in her prior election. Two of the judges appointed to hear O'Toole's case, [Judge Patrick F. Fischer and Judge Vernon L. Preston,] had dissented in the O'Neill case. The Ohio Supreme Court fined O'Toole and ordered her to pay the complainant's attorney's fees. Justice Paul E.

Having been used as sidings until 2016, the depot is presently operated by Agility Trains as part of their contract to maintain the Class 800 fleet for Great Western Railway. History Maliphant Street and Maliphant Sidings,from an Ordnance Survey map of 1884.Swansea (High Street) station is to the south of the mapped area. Swansea (High Street) railway station was built in 1850 for the South Wales Railway, which was absorbed into the Great Western Railway in 1863. Sidings were constructed north of the station on the east side of the main line railway out of High Street station, opposite a goods station on the west side; Maliphant Street passed beneath the main line of the railway north of the goods station. The original facilities included a workshop, turntable, and carriage shed.Ordnance Survey, 1879, 1:500 By the 20th century the turntable and workshops had been removed and the site had been converted into extensive linear sidings, the sidings remained in that form for the next 100 years, with some changes to layout.Ordnance survey, 1:2500; 1899, 1919, 1951‚Äì7. 1:10560/1:1:10000; 1921, 1938, 1964, 1972‚Äì1995 Present  It was first announced in 2012 that the current sidings were to be the site of a new service depot for Great Western Railway's new AT300s from the Intercity Express Programme, with construction due to start in 2015. Modifications of the original plans were submitted in 2013; changes to the plans included expansion of some buildings, but they did not expand the scale of work expected to be carried out at the site. The depot was completed in 2016 and became operational in 2017, employing 80 people. It includes an inspection building as well as train-washing and fuelling facilities.

They have vesicular nuclei and conspicuous nucleoli. \\\\- \\"This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.\\" Model of Centroblast Development A centroblast generally refers to an activated B cell that is enlarged (12-18 micrometer) and is rapidly proliferating in the germinal center of a lymphoid follicle. They are specifically located in the dark zone of the germinal center. Centroblasts form from naive B cells being exposed to follicular dendritic cell cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-15, 8D6, and BAFF. Stimulation from helper T cells is also required for centroblast development. Interaction between CD40 ligand on an activated T helper cell and the B cell CD40 receptor induces centroblasts to express activation-induced cytidine deaminase, leading to somatic hypermutation, allowing the B cell receptor to potentially gain stronger affinity for an antigen. In the absence of FDC and helper T cell stimulation, centroblasts are unable to differentiate and will undergo CD95-mediated apoptosis. Morphologically, centroblasts are large lymphoid cells containing a moderate amount of cytoplasm, round to oval vesicular (i.e. containing small fluid-filled sacs) nuclei, vesicular chromatin, and 2‚Äì3 small nucleoli often located adjacent to the nuclear membrane. They are derived from B cells. Immunoblasts are distinguished from centroblasts by being B cell-derived lymphoid cells that have moderate-to-abundant basophilic cytoplasm and a prominent, centrally located, trapezoid-shaped single nucleolus which often has fine strands of chromatin attached to the nuclear membrane (‚Äòspider legs‚Äô). In some cases, immunoblasts can show some morphologic features of plasma cells. Centroblasts do not express immunoglobulins and are unable to respond to the follicular dendritic cell antigens present in the secondary lymphoid follicles. However, they are able to promote the secretion of immunoglobulins though CD27/CD70 interactions. B cells begin expressing CD27 at the beginning of the centroblast stage and lose the cell marker after differentiating into centrocytes. CD27 is an important marker for germinal center formation in the lymphoid follicle and is produced by centroblasts interacting with CD28+ helper T cells. The production of the germinal center is important for the production of antibody secreting plasma cells and memory B cells. After proliferation, centroblasts migrate to the light zone of the germinal center and eventually give rise to centrocytes.

In 1928 following an extensive sketching tour of Europe she held a solo exhibition in Adelaide which achieved a near record sale (over ¬£1000) for an Australian woman. She died in Adelaide on 26 August 1960 after a long illness.

The episode was written by Sonny Postiglione and directed by Kellie Cyrus. Plot After Professor Wes Maxfield (Rick Cosnett) killed Jesse (Kendrick Sampson) at the end of the last episode, this episode starts with him performing experiments on Jesse for unknown reasons and it seems that this is not the first one. Meanwhile, Elena (Nina Dobrev) attempts to deal with Bonnie's (Kat Graham) death by distracting herself with her research about Megan's death and why Professor Maxfield covered the reason she died. While she ponders how to get the information she needs, she sees someone at Megan's grave. She approaches the stranger and asks him his name and if he knew Megan, but the man seems reluctant to answer her questions. It is later revealed that the man's name is Aaron (Shaun Sipos) and Professor Wes is his guardian. Wes asks Aaron to stay away from Elena and then, on an encounter with Elena at the Whitmore Historical Ball, he tells her to leave college and go back to Mystic Falls with her friends as there are people at Whitmore who are watching her. Tyler (Michael Trevino) returns for Bonnie's funeral and spends some time with Caroline (Candice Accola) who still tries to convince him to cease what he is doing and come to college. Tyler informs her that he cannot let Klaus get away with what he did to his mom, Carol, and that he will hunt him down and kill him. Caroline tries to change his mind with no such luck. The two part ways, ending their relationship. Nadia (Olga Fonda) still has Katherine captured and Silas (Paul Wesley) commences to try to find them but is unable to without his mental power. Katherine consistently asks Nadia what she wants from her and Nadia reveals to her that she is her daughter whom she left behind in 1492 and the only reason she became a vampire was to find her. In the meantime, Damon (Ian Somerhalder) tells Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) his plan about how they can bring Bonnie back to life. Because someone has to die to bring another back, Damon says that they should take advantage of the fact that Silas wants to die to be with his true love, Amara, so that Bonnie comes back. They have to work with Silas to do so and Bonnie does not agree with the idea. Damon meets Silas to inform him about his plan and Silas agrees but own his terms; he wants Damon to \\"kill\\" his brother. By \\"killing\\" Stefan, the link between the two of them will be broken and Silas will have his mental power back. Damon just has to keep Stefan \\"dead\\" as long as Silas will be pretending to be Stefan so he can get the information he needs from Quetsiyah's (Janina Gavankar) head. The plan goes well until the moment Stefan escapes from Damon before he \\"kills\\" him again and lets Quetsiyah know that she is talking to Silas and not him. Quetsiyah becomes enraged, reaches into his heart and twists it whilst making a spell causing it to stop. The spell turns Silas cold and grey and unable to move or do anything, but not dead. Damon and Elena find him and take him back to the Salvatore house. Katherine arrives at the Salvatore home after Damon calls her and she is happy to see that Silas is gone, unbeknownst to the real reason Damon called her, to use her to bring Silas back. Silas starts to wake up after feeding on Katherine and while Katherine should be dead after this, she also wakes up with Elena and Damon not knowing why.

Club gave a B rate to the episode saying that it still feels like the show hasn‚Äôt shifted gears from its season five premiere. \\"This episode was perfectly fine, in a season five that‚Äôs been full of fine so far. What I‚Äôm waiting for, and what I hope this Katherine story is going to bring, is the thing that elevates it beyond the fine to the fabulous.\\" Christopher Monigle from Star Pulse gave a good review to the episode but he stated that this season \\"is either on a path towards brilliance or going completely off the rails.\\" and that too many plots might not be good for the show. \\"On the surface the amount of plot and movement through five episodes is exciting. TVD hasn‚Äôt lost the knack for break-neck pacing and crazy reveals. I don‚Äôt want TVD to lose its identity. Throwing as much plot into a story can trigger something bad.\\" Matt Richenthal from TV Fanatic rated the episode with 3.7/5. \\"The Vampire Diaries treated viewers to a trick-filled installment on Halloween night, one filled with multiple storylines, a lot of exposition and at least one mother of a surprise.\\" Stephanie Flasher from TV After Dark gave an A rate to the episode saying that it had a very similar feel to the earlier seasons of the series. \\"‚ÄùMonster‚Äôs Ball‚Äù was everything a TVD fan could ask in an episode centered on a ball, dance, gala or any social gathering of that matter. It fully took advantage of most of the characters being together. There was romance, dancing, family, friendship, heartbreak and it wouldn‚Äôt be TVD if we didn‚Äôt have some doppelganger hi-jinx every now and then.\\" Stephanie Hall of KSiteTV gave a good review to the episode stating that the episode was fill of emotion. \\"Though not the most surprising or action packed episode of The Vampire Diaries, \\"Monster's Ball\\" was full of enough emotion to overshadow these minor missing elements. This season has so far done well to balance the Silas story with the characters' average life struggles by gearing an episode towards one or the other. \\"Monster's Ball,\\" on the other hand, beautifully balanced both.\\" Tyler Olson from Crimson Tear though, rated the episode with 2/5 saying that the episode was \\"disappointing\\" and that \\"The only real saving grace in Monster's Ball was Katherine Pierce\\".

It is an independent charter school that opened in September 2013 and is accredited by the Western Association of Secondary Schools. It is housed on the sixth and seventh floors of the city's central public library in Downtown San Diego and is billed as the first public school in the United States to be located inside a library. History The city of San Diego had been studying the possibility of a new central library for years, and a site had been identified, but funding was insufficient. In April 2010 the city and the school district reached an agreement to house a school in leased space within the library; the district's rent payments would help to make the new downtown library financially possible. The sixth and seventh floors of the library, amounting to , were designed from the outset as a school. The city approved construction plans for the library in June 2010. A petition for a new charter high school, initially referred to as Downtown Charter High, was submitted to the San Diego Unified School District in September 2010. Several other charter petitions were also filed, but the school district chose Downtown Charter and approved the application in August 2011. The name was later changed to e3 Civic High (for \\"engage, educate, empower\\"). The new library and the school both opened in September 2013. The initial enrollment consisted of 260 students in the 9th and 10th grades. Additional 9th graders were added in 2014 and 2015; as of the 2015-16 school year the enrollment is 403, with a target total enrollment of approximately 500 students. The first senior class graduated in June 2016. School operation The school is open to all high school students in San Diego County. Students must submit an application to attend. If more applications are received than there are available slots, students are accepted by lottery, with preference given to students from within the school district and particularly those whose neighborhood high school is identified as underperforming. The school design includes variably sized rooms and open spaces. Most of the rooms have modular glass walls and movable furniture intended to facilitate collaboration among students and between students and teachers. It is described as looking \\"more like a Starbucks and less like a school.\\" Library patrons can see inside the school, though they cannot access it; the school has a separate entrance and separate elevators. The curriculum incorporates internships and other real-world experiences with downtown businesses, organizations and facilities. Local college students and library staff augment the faculty by mentoring students and teaching them research skills. Students choose one of the school's two pre-professional pathways: biomedical health or digital media. Students can graduate with both a high school diploma and a community college degree. The school does not have a sports program, although it does have exercise facilities, and there is some access to outdoor activities at nearby Petco Park.

Plan of the elective camp. On 16 September 1668, King John II Casimir abdicated the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian throne. He left for France and joined the Jesuits where he became Abbot of Saint- Germain-des-Pr√©s Abbey in Paris which resulted in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth being left without a monarch, making it necessary for a free election. The pro-French faction, which was backed by Michal Prazmowski and Crown Hetman Jan Sobieski, was strong. During the Convocation, several Sejm members of the szlachta urged the election of a native Piast king instead. There were widespread rumors that supporters of foreign candidates had been bribed. Under the circumstances, the Bishop of Che≈Çmno, Andrzej Olszowski, suggested that instead of a foreigner, a Pole should be elected. Olszowski suggested the candidacy of Micha≈Ç Korybut Wi≈õniowiecki, who was the son of legendary Ruthenian magnate, Jeremi Wi≈õniowiecki. Micha≈Ç Korybut was an exceptional individual, but the Szlachta who were afraid of growing French influences, decided to back him. Local sejmiks urged the nobility to come to Warsaw as pospolite ruszenie. The free election, which took place in May and June 1669 in Wola, near Warsaw, is regarded as the epitome of szlachta anarchy (see Golden Liberty). After heated arguments on June 6, a crowd of nobility electors forced senators to void the candidacy of Louis, Grand Cond√©. Some senators tried to oppose, but most gave way to the threats and eventually supported the Bishop of Kujawy, Florian Czartoryski, who stated: ‚ÄúThe voice of the people is the voice of God‚Äù. On June 17, some districts of Warsaw burned in a fire and rumors soon spread that the fire was intentionally set. Szlachta surrounded the wooden shed in which the senators convened, accusing them of treason and conspiring with foreign envoys. Shots were fired and, as Jan Chryzostom Pasek later wrote in his diaries, ‚Äúbishops and senators hid themselves under chairs, emerging only after the situation had been defused.‚Äù Two days later, on June 19, Wi≈õniowiecki was elected the new king. A Polish nobleman, Jan Antoni Chrapowicki, who participated in the free election, wrote later: ‚ÄúThere were different factions: some wanted the Neuburgian, others supported the Lotharingian. Since neither side wanted to resign their candidacy, it was decided that in order to avoid commotion, a Piast will be elected, who turned out to be Micha≈Ç Korybut Wi≈õniowiecki. Primate Prazmowski, who was hesitant at the choice, was eventually forced to sing the Te Deum hymn‚Äù. Even though Wisniowiecki won the support of the majority of electors, a faction led by Prazmowski and Sobieski continued to oppose him. The Crowning by the Sejm, which took place in Krak√≥w, was dismissed. The Commonwealth, which suffered from continuous Crimean Tatar raids, was on the brink of civil war. Outbreak of the Polish‚ÄìOttoman War (1672‚Äì76) changed this situation, ending internal conflicts.

It is operated by the Antara Society. Antara was established in 1971 and got Registered in 1972 by a group of like minded psychiatrists and other mental health professionals.http://www.heraldofindia.com/article.php?id=445 Organisation and administration Antaragram is operated by the charitable trust Antara. Prior to the establishment of Antaragram, the group of founders including Dr. Satrujit Dasgupta, Maj. (Dr.) R B Davis, P M John, and Bro Andrew along with Mother Teresa and Mar Thoma Church, Calcutta operated an Outpatient Psychiatric Unit in 1971. Next year, the group provided residential facilities to mentally ill patients. From 1982 onward, a need arose to cater to a much larger patient population. Land was purchased in the outskirts of Kolkata to establish the larger Mental Health Hospital. The site was called 'Antaragram'. The foundation stone was laid by Mother Teresa in 1980.

They kept it in watch list and check for edits. Controversy and criticisms=Involuntary admission of female patient In January, 2013, Times of India reported that a female individual was sent to Antara because she alleged that her family member molested her. The institution admitted her without her consent. The treating psychiatrist was Dr. Payal Roy. Another psychiatrist who previously saw the individual commented: Clarification on the above statement: Adult psychiatric patients can be admitted in a Psychiatric hospital without the patient's consent -- there are provisions for this in the Mental Health Act, 1987. Consent of the patient is not required under special circumstances. Again, in the case of a minor (below 18 years of age), the patient can be admitted by the guardian, either natural parent or a court-appointed guardian. The patient in question was a minor and she was admitted by her father. Also note, Antara breaks the law by forcefully taking people from their home and taking them to the hospital. Indian laws state that involuntary admission is permissible only in the premises of the hospital. Forcefully taking a person from their residence against their will to the hospital is against the law. Tieing of Patients to Hospital Beds Patients in Antara are sometimes tied to their hospital beds with rope. The staff at Antara fail to mitigate the patient's distress and instead use coercive measures against them. Hospital staff are well known to use aggression against the patients and many staff have antisocial personalities themselves. The doctors are also poorly trained and use outdated medical and psychiatric practices which cause iatrogenic or harmful effects on patients. The patients live in very confined areas and show signs of institutional syndrome and one major problem being positive symptoms. Families with psychiatric patients that don't care about them are left to decay in the psychiatric ward. Another unusual policy that Antara follows is that of DAMA (Discharge Against Medical Advice). Even when a patient doesnt medically indicate the hospitalization for over a month, psychiatrist still keep the patients for beyond that time period. Excessive hospitalization can lead to long term negative and positive symptoms and be detrimental to the patient. Key characteristics of the hospital is that hospital staff use coercive approaches against the patients rather than a therapeutic approach.

The Polish throne was vacant again, so another free election was necessary. As in 1669, the main candidates were French Duke Louis, Grand Conde, Philip William, Elector Palatine (both supported by Louis XIV of France), and Charles V, Duke of Lorraine. Hetman John Sobieski, who was a very influential figure in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, did not express interest in the Polish crown, and before the election stated that he did wish to be elected. Sobieski was hated by Lithuanian magnates of the Pac family, who in January 1674, during the Convocation Sejm, demanded that a bill prohibiting native Poles (or Piasts) from running in the election should be introduced. The very fact that the Pac family promoted such a bill means that Sobieski was regarded by many as a possible candidate. His name was mentioned by envoys of the House of Habsburg, and by French newspaper La Gazette. French diplomats later stated that Sobieski himself hesitated between running in the election, and supporting the Grand Conde. The election began on Saturday, June 19, 1674. Despite the protests of Lithuanians, the Bishop of Krak√≥w Andrzej Trzebicki initiated the process, by singing the hymn Veni Sancte Spiritus. The next day, Sunday, June 20, was dedicated to religious ceremonies and behind the scenes negotiations. On Monday, June 21, the Bishop of Vilnius, Micha≈Ç Pac stated that Lithuania agreed to the Piast candidate. In the afternoon of the same day, John III Sobieski became King of Poland.  Sources  U.

In that city he attended to the Instituto Nacional Mej√≠a. In the 1930s, after the resignation of President Isidro Ayora in 1931, Ecuador went through seventeen governments in a decade. Artists and intellectuals belonged to two camps: one with Marxist socialist tendencies, and a conservative group. At the Mejia School, one of the most notable learning institutions in Quito, Professor Jos√© Enrique Guerrero had great influence on Mu√±oz Mari√±o with his style. Mu√±oz Mari√±o's passion was also architecture. He painted buildings, evaluating their proportions, which helped in his becoming one of the most talented architects of Ecuador in recent decades. He co-wrote a study titled Ecuador en gr√°ficos (Ecuador in graphs), which he traveled to Guayaquil to present with the help of Benjam√≠n Carri√≥n. He was fascinated with the city, and having just graduated from high school, he got a job at Tucker Mc Klure, which was in charge of building the roads between Guayaquil-Salinas, and between Quito-Esmeraldas. This experience eventually defined his vocation as an architect. He yearned to move to Mexico to study architecture, and with the support of Benjamin Carrion and the Minister of War, he was able to do it. In 1974 he worked on the project Huayra Huanca (El origen del tiempo), which was commissioned by the Mexican government in accordance with a proposal by Oswaldo Guayasam√≠n. In 1962 he participated in a contest for the New City Hall building of Quito, for which he was awarded a prize. Unfortunately his design was never built. In 1962 and 1964 he exhibited his work in Mexico City and in its College of Architects. But in 1965 he won the first prize in the Annual Watercolor Exhibition in the College of Architects of Mexico, which opened the door to fame. He has traveled almost 100 cities around the world, of which he has painted 74. In 1999 he was awarded Ecuador's highest national art prize Premio Eugenio Espejo by the President of Ecuador.List of winners of the Premio Eugenio Espejo and Spanish biographies  References  Category:1923 births Category:2016 deaths Category:People from Riobamba Category:Ecuadorian painters ","title":"Oswaldo Mu√±oz Mari√±o"},{"id":"40952291","text":"Tulee v. Washington, 315 U.S. 681 (1942), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held the Washington statute prescribing license fees for fishing is invalid as applied to a Yakima Indian convicted on a charge of catching salmon with a net without first having obtained a license, in view of Treaty with Yakima Indians securing to them the exclusive right of taking fish in all streams running through or bordering reservation and right of taking fish at all usual and accustomed places in common with citizens of Washington.  Background  Sampson Tulee was a Yakama Indian who was arrested in 1939 for fishing for salmon with a net, without a state license. Tulee contended that the 1855 treaty gave him the right to fish, while the state contended that this right was limited to the reservation. Tulee was convicted in state court and his conviction was affirmed at the Washington Supreme Court.Tulee v. Washington, 315 U.S. 681, 682 (1942); , 142 (2006).  Supreme Court  Justice Hugo Black delivered the opinion of the court. Black found that the terms of the treaty granted tribal members fishing rights both on and off of the reservation. The state was not allowed to charge fees for Indians to be able to exercise those rights. He noted that the court had clearly ruled on fishing rights in United States v. Winans in 1905 and in Seufert Bros. Co. v. United States in 1919. The court therefore ruled that the state was without power to regulate tribal fishing.Tulee v. Washington, 315 U.S. at 685; , at 142.  Subsequent developments  Although the tribe had won the case, they still faced discrimination from the state and from non-Indian commercial fishermen. It was not until 1974 when U.S. District Judge George Boldt ruled on the discrimination in United States v. Washington. He later ordered the United States Coast Guard to enforce his order that the state began to revise its methods, and the U.S. Supreme Court later affirmed his decision in Washington v.

He represents Nayarit and the first electoral region as a deputy to the LXIII Legislature of the Mexican Congress. Life While he was born in Sinaloa, most of Acosta Naranjo's political career has developed in the state of Nayarit. He attended the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Nayarit, obtaining a degree in economics and becoming the school of economics's student leader. A devout Marxist, he argued against participating in elections and worked in labor activism against the powerful, PRI-linked unions. He also served in various left-wing organizations, including the Movimiento Lucha Popular and Organizaci√≥n Revolucionaria Punto Cr√≠tico. In 1989, Acosta Naranjo became a founding member of the new PRD, and the next year, he began the first of two terms in the state congress of Nayarit, serving between 1990‚Äì93 and again from 1996‚Äì99; in his first term, he was the youngest legislator in the state, and during his second stint, he headed the PRD faction in the congress. He also made an unsuccessful run at the municipal presidency of Tepic in 1993. He was jailed after holding a rally to denounce fraud in the election. In 1999, after a PRD-PAN alliance beat the PRI in the gubernatorial elections, Acosta became the subsecretary of government but soon after clashed with Antonio Echavarr√≠a when the latter asked him to support the PAN's presidential candidate in 2000, Vicente Fox. After some time away from politics, Acosta Naranjo made a mark again in the mid-2000s within the PRD party structure. He was the subsecretary general during 2003, the national Secretary of Planning and Institutional Development from 2003 to 2004, and the Secretary of Organization from 2004 to 2005. Most notably, he became the secretary general, the second-in-command of the party, from 2005 to 2008, and the interim president during 2008 after Leonel Cota Monta√±o left. He also clashed with Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador, disagreeing with his decision to disrupt the delivery of Vicente Fox's final government report in the aftermath of the 2006 presidential election. In 2009, the PRD placed Acosta Naranjo on its list from the fifth region, sending him to the Chamber of Deputies for the LXI Legislature representing the State of Mexico. He was a president of the Board of Directors and served on commissions dealing with public spending, government, labor and social welfare, and the sugar industry. While a deputy, he made a failed bid for governor of Nayarit, and from 2013 to 2014, he was the PRD's technical secretary for the Guiding Council of the Pacto por M√©xico. In 2015, Acosta Naranjo returned to San L√°zaro, this time representing the first region and Nayarit, for the LXIII Legislature. He serves on commissions related to national defense, hydraulic resources, and foreign relations, and is a secretary of the Permanent Commission's Board of Directors for the second recess of 2016. Acosta Naranjo is noted for his positions on opposing the PRI at all costs, sometimes even supporting other political parties to get the PRI out of office. In the 2016 Tamaulipas gubernatorial elections, he called on the opposition to unite behind PAN opposition candidate Francisco Javier Garc√≠a Cabeza de Vaca, claiming his endorsement was not an abandonment of his party and threatening legal action if the PRD responded with a move to expel him. In a May 2016 radio interview, he also claimed that if the opposition united under a single candidate, the PRI would not win any elections.

His works have been adapted into many different media including television drama, anime, and live action film. In 2001, he won the Tetsuya Chiba Award. Background Oshimi's hometown is in the countryside of Kiryu, Gunma, which also served as the setting of his manga The Flowers of Evil. While growing up there, the main places he would visit were the riverbank, the stairs of his junior high school, and the bookstore. Oshimi currently resides in Tokyo.Oshimi, The Flowers of Evil Vol. 2, p. 126 Career Oshimi debuted with Superfly in Kodansha's Monthly Sh≈çnen Magazine. He would go on to start his first series Avant-Garde Yumeko in the magazine. His works have been adapted into many different media, with Drifting Net Caf√© and Inside Mari into television dramas, The Flowers of Evil into an anime, and Sweet Poolside into a live action film. In 2001, he won the Tetsuya Chiba Award. Influences In his childhood Oshimi would read modernist poems from authors like Sakutar≈ç Hagiwara and Mitsuharu Kaneko.Oshimi, The Flowers of Evil Vol. 1, p. 140 Oshimi also thought that surrealist artists like Andr√© Breton, Max Ernst, and Paul Delvaux were cool.Oshimi, The Flowers of Evil Vol. 2, p. 34 His favorite artist is Redon.Oshimi, The Flowers of Evil Vol. 1, p. 44 and he also likes Francisco Goya.Oshimi, The Flowers of Evil Vol. 2, p. 96 In his youth, Oshimi heavily identified with the protagonist of Tetsu Adachi's Song of Cherry Blossoms and it would later influence his manga The Flowers of Evil. Themes Oshimi's narrative style consists of stories presenting quirky, clumsy main characters, usually a boy and a girl couple, and how their relationship unfolds as the narrative progresses. He also presents uncommon, uncomfortable and, sometimes, disturbing situations through which the protagonists take part. This narrative style has been seen in all of the author's works, including his best-known work, The Flowers of Evil. Oshimi likes to explore themes such as coming-of-age and perversion, combined with his experiences in his youth. He thinks that the end of adolescence is hard to define, and is up to an individual to discover, such as in The Flowers of Evil.Oshimi, The Flowers of Evil Vol. 3, p. 172 He also believes that perversion is a characteristic of every person that is surrounded by stigma which he wants people to think about.Oshimi, The Flowers of Evil Vol. 1, p. 172 Oshimi also wants to explore the female perspective in his gender-bender manga Inside Mari, because to him, girls are \\"half of the world\\".

Officers may be variously described as \\"State Constable\\", \\"Special State Constable\\", \\"Department of Public Safety (DPS) Special Constable\\" and \\"Magistrates' Constable\\". State Constables are appointed by the Governor of South Carolina, and regulated by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division. History Many types of law enforcement officers have been created with titles throughout history. One of the most common types is \\"constable\\" and multiple references in South Carolina state law describe various law enforcement officers having powers of constable with this authority originating from common law. Continual referencing by officials as to their authority and intent come from State Supreme Court rulings referenced throughout history in South Carolina with the following language, \\"...State Constables possess the authority of regularly commissioned peace officers, including powers of arrest.\\" (State v. Luster, 1935), \\"Our Supreme Court has stated that constables perform all the duties of law enforcement officers and in particular 'a constable stands on the same footing as a sheriff.'\\" (State v. Franklin, 1908). State Law also specifies that SLED advises the Governor regarding State Constables related to approving candidates and specifies qualifications, training, conduct and has general oversight of the State Constable Program. Constableship in South Carolina consists of a wide range of laws and regulations with the intent to help provide an effective and efficient resource of law enforcement personnel for the citizens and agencies of South Carolina. State Constables are appointed by the Governor of South Carolina (SC ST SEC 23-1-60) and overseen by the South Carolina State Law Enforcement Division (SLED). All State Constables are certified as a law enforcement officer by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Training Council, in compliance with the law SC ST 23-23-40 Certification Requirement. Since 1989 all State Constables were required to be certified. State Constables are employees of the State, including uncompensated/volunteer State Constables, as stated in SC ST 42-1-130. Additionally, they are provided insurance related to tort liability as specified in SC ST 1-11-140 and workers' compensation as specified in SC ST 23-1-60 and SC ST 42-1-130 while working in a law enforcement capacity. State Constables are appointed officers and officially sworn peace officers authorized to enforce the Laws of the State with statewide jurisdiction. As with Reserve Police Officers being \\"appointed officers\\" by county or municipal agencies and uncompensated volunteers, Group II and III State Constables are also \\"appointed officers\\" by the Governor after approval from SLED is granted and are also uncompensated volunteers. As with other States in the U.S., recognition of these auxiliary police officers designated in South Carolina as Group II and III State Constables and Reserve Police Officers as \\"law enforcement officers\\" provides for the necessary compliance with Federal and State Laws since they work on- duty for patrol and special events within areas currently designated as Gun Free Zones like schools and government buildings (except for Federal buildings and military bases where only Federal law enforcement officers have exclusive jurisdiction.) The South Carolina Attorney General has supported this recognition whereby auxiliary police officers are considered \\"law enforcement officers\\" and they comply with the laws related to possession of weapons (i.e. qualified service weapons only) in publicly owned buildings and schools and there is no requirement for them to be on-duty or in uniform to do so. This recognition is further supported throughout the Basic State Constable Training courses by the instructor along with multiple references within the Policies and Procedures published by SLED for Group III State Constables. The Commissioning of State Constables to enforce the Laws of the State with Regulation by SLED establishes compliance with Federal and State laws and regulations for them to serve as law enforcement officers. When armed, State Constables have their credentials in their immediate possession for display if circumstances warrant. Any handguns they carry are concealed unless they are in a state approved uniform. Credentials are issued by SLED and contain approval signatures and a photograph. State Constables are required to comply with the Federal and State Laws governing actions of law enforcement officers. Groups=Group I A South Carolina State Constable Group I can be a uniformed police officer or a plainclothes investigator for the state with statewide jurisdiction. Agencies that have a law enforcement division or services (e.g. SCDC investigators, SC Dept. of Mental Health Public Safety, USCPD, CUPD, SCDHEC, state colleges, state universities) are commissioned constables through SLED (State Law Enforcement Division). Group II Group II State Constables are retired police officers in good standing that can receive a State Constable Commission to continue to have authority and carry a weapon as set forth by SLED for Group III State Constables. Group III Group II and III State Constables serve the public and assist law enforcement agencies as a State reserve police force to help maintain public safety and officer safety for routine activities, special events, emergencies and fulfill needs for additional law enforcement personnel that arise during various circumstances. =Qualifications= Group III State Constables are evaluated by the South Carolina State Law Enforcement Division for meeting required qualifications. The candidate must submit an application to SLED for approval involving an evaluation to determine suitability to serve in a law enforcement capacity. This involves a review of personal and professional details, interviewing, a background check, medical evaluation, etc. If approved the candidate must complete the Basic State Constable training program unless existing law enforcement certification (e.g. Class 1) is current and accepted by SLED Regulatory. Candidates who are required to complete the Basic State Constable training program must acquire written authorization from SLED to attend and they must successfully demonstrate competency via certification testing prior to receiving a recommendation for a State Constable Commission. SLED generates a recommendation submitted to the Governor upon successful completion of all requirements, qualifications and certification test results. The State Constable Training Program is regulated by SLED and established by the SC Law Enforcement Training Council. Courses are presented by the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy instructors and Certified Law Enforcement Instructors. The Basic Constable Training manual consists of 395 pages of law enforcement officer training material covered in approximately 92 hours of classroom instruction at a Technical College in the State. This also includes Firearms Training and Firearms Qualification Testing administered by a Certified Law Enforcement Firearms Training Instructor. Advanced Constable training requires an additional 272 pages of law enforcement training material covering additional topics in approximately 60 hours of classroom and physical training including practical examinations. Both manuals are generated by the SC Criminal Justice Academy and are approved by SLED. Basic Constable and Advanced Constable Certification testing are administered at the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy. =Duties= Group III State Constables serve under the following conditions: 1. They can be assigned to work with agencies (e.g. Sheriff's Departments, Police Departments, University Police Departments, State agencies, Airport Police, etc.) for routine patrol, special events (e.g. festivals, fairs, school events, parades or other scheduled events of limited duration or emergency or critical incidents) and other law enforcement activities of the agency. They may also serve under other conditions as approved by the Chief of SLED. 2. They may take law enforcement actions while not working with an agency if encountering an imminent and urgent situation with either a threat to public safety or a need to preserve life. 3. They may take law enforcement action if an officer requests assistance or when assistance is not requested, but the need for assistance is obvious due to imminent and urgent danger of the circumstances. Restrictions on Group III State Constables independently using their law enforcement authority (i.e. while not working with an agency) specify they may take law enforcement actions if encountering imminent and urgent circumstances when it is necessary to preserve life or protect public safety and they are required to notify the appropriate local law enforcement agency by the fastest means available as specified in the SLED policies and procedures. This detailed and restricted function identifies one of the most significant purposes of a State Constable in their service as intended. Training requirements Annual firearms qualification and annual training consisting of additional law enforcement officer training including standardized legal updates via in- service training are required for all South Carolina State Constables and all activities are required to be conducted in accordance with the South Carolina Law Enforcement Training Council and policies established by SLED. Group II and Group III (uncompensated) State Constables are required by law to submit quarterly reports with the Governor (SC ST SEC 23-1-80) via SLED Regulatory of all work assignments, training and actions taken as a law enforcement officer.

Offensive=Push into Eastern Ghouta During late March 2013, government forces opened a new front in the town of Otaiba, in an effort to divert rebel war-efforts and to attack rebel forces in the eastern Ghouta from the rear. On 7 April, government force launched an offensive east of Damascus, with the state news agency SANA claiming the military imposed a siege on the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta area. Rebels stated that intensified Army attacks on the area had been going on since mid-March. A rebel commander confirmed that the northern entrance to Ghouta was under siege and an opposition activist stated that a government tank-led assault on Eastern Ghouta had been launched towards the south from the direction of the Damascus international airport. On 15 April, at least 20 people were killed in air strikes and rocket barrages in the north and east of Damascus. Rebel fighters were reportedly increasing their strength in the Qaboun and Barzeh neighbourhoods to minimise the risk of chemical weapons being used on them, as they would likely inflict casualties on the Syrian Army fighting rebels at close quarters. On 18 April, \\"gunmen\\" assassinated Ali Ballan, head of public relations at the Ministry of Social Affairs and a member of Syria's relief agency, in a restaurant at Mazzeh district. On 20 April, the Syrian army was pressing to take full control of the town of Jdaidet al-Fadl, southwest of Damascus. Sixty-nine people were killed in the four-day battle, most of them rebels.Dozens killed in battle near Damascus: Watchdog The fighting also affected the nearby town of Jdeidit Artouz, which is predominantly Christian. Fall of Jdaidet al-Fadl and Otaiba On 21 April, the Syrian Army captured Jdaidet al-Fadl, with the opposition making claims of a massacre being committed. SOHR stated 250 people were killed since the start of the battle for Jdaidet al-Fadl, five days prior, with them being able to document, by name, 127 of the dead, including 27 rebels. Another opposition claim put the death toll at 450. One activist claimed he counted 98 bodies in the town's streets and 86 in makeshift clinics who were summarily executed. Another activist stated they documented 85 people who were executed, including 28 who were killed in a makeshift hospital. The opposition activist group LCC reported 483 people were killed in the battle for the town, around 300 of them civilians and 150 rebels. The Syrian army claimed 190 rebels were killed during the battle and they discovered a mass grave in the town, where they claimed rebels used it to bury their dead and government soldiers and civilian supporters they had killed. On 24 April, the military captured the town of Otaiba, after a 37-day battle. The Army victory was a major setback for the rebels, as Otaiba was the gateway to Eastern Ghouta and the main, if not the only, weapons supply route for the Damascus area. A rebel fighter predicted other villages in the Eastern Ghouta will fall one after another and the fighting will become a war of attrition. During the fighting, rebels from Otaiba called for reinforcements from Islamist brigades in the area, with whom they were in competition for influence and weapons, but their calls went unanswered. Rebels said they planned to retake the town at all costs. Attack on Jobar and Barzeh On 26 April, government forces continued with their offensive by pushing into the Damascus districts of Jobar and Barzeh, which have a high rebel presence. Troops were encountering heavy rebel resistance as they advanced with air and artillery support. Rebel positions in the nearby Qaboun district were also bombarded with mortars and multiple rocket launchers. An Army siege of the town of Moadamiyet, a rebel stronghold close to Darayya, was also tightening with daily bombardment and a shortage of food. On 27 April, rebels launched a counter-attack in Otaiba, using both infantry and vehicles. Airstrikes were reported on the town, though most of the battle was taking place on its outskirts and at the Saiqa camp, a Syrian army base. On April 28, and for the third consecutive day, the Army continued its offensive with heavy fighting in the area of Barzeh. On 29 April, heavy fighting took place on the outskirts of Damascus International Airport. According to a security source, the fighting took place on the highway leading to the airport and had to be closed for one hour. In the district of Mazzeh, Prime Minister Wael Nader Al-Halqi survived a suicide car bomb targeting his convoy. Continuing Army offensive On 1 May, according to SOHR, fighting took place in the towns of al-Ebada, al-Maliha and Qaysa in the Rif Dimashq. On 2 May, the Syrian Army captured the town of Qaysa in the eastern Ghouta. A call issued by several activists in the area warned the disparate rebel forces to pull together or face defeat. \\"If you do not unite under one flag the regime is going to hunt you down, one brigade after another,\\" it said. Between 4 and 6 May, fighting raged all around Damascus and its countryside with clashes and bombing being reported in the Palestinian refugee camp of Yarmouk, the town of Drosha and the Khan al-Sheikh camp, where the Army was trying to take control of the area, and towns of Beit Sahm, Thiyabiya and Sayyeda Zeinab and Huseiniya camp. Fighting also raged in Derkhabiya al-Buweida and the Barzeh neighbourhood. Although fighting was still ongoing in the outskirts of Drosha after two days of clashes, according to SORH, there were reports of a partial retreat of regular forces from the area. The Syrian military claimed that their troops captured the towns of al-Abbada and Ghraika in Eastern Ghouta, but there was no independent confirmation. On 8 May, the leader of the Al-Nusra Front rebel group, Abu Mohammad al-Golani, was wounded during an artillery bombardment south of Damascus. On 9 May, the Syrian Army captured the town of Jarba. Meanwhile, mortars were being fired into Jaramana, a government-controlled town. In the following days fighting continued in the Barzeh and Jobar neighbourhoods of Damascus, where a rebel commander was killed in clashes with the local pro-government militia. Fighting was also once again reported in Qaysa. Rebel counter-attack On 14 May, several rebel brigades, including the Islamist Al Nusra Front, united temporarily under the same command and launched operation Al Furqaan. The stated aim of the operation is an attempt to recapture Otaiba and to try and reopen the rebel supply line into Damascus and the Ghouta area. In the case they recapture Otaiba, they planned to press on towards the Damascus international airport. SOHR said that Islamic units, including Jabhat al-Nusra, and Syrian opposition fighters were battling around Otaiba. However, by the next day, there was little evidence of the renewed fighting around Otaiba available on the usual opposition YouTube channels, so it was impossible to independently confirm the extent of the fighting. On 15 May, rebels claimed to had recaptured the town of Qaysa. However, in early June, the town was still reported to be government-held. The Army capture of Harran Al-Awamid and Abadeh was also reported. Renewed Army push On 27 May, Hezbollah forces reportedly engaged in combat operations against the rebels in the Eastern Ghouta area. Hezbollah fighters had captured nine towns in the Al-Murj area neighboring Ghouta and opposition activists claimed thousands of members of the Lebanese group were training in an air force intelligence center near Damascus International Airport. On 28 May, the Army launched a major operation against the Barzeh neighborhood in Damascus. Government troops advanced 400 meters in the district, after attacking from the north, east and south-east. The aim of the operation was to isolate the rebel area near Qaboun. It was also reported that the military reached the town of Adra, east of Damascus, completing a sweep through rebel-held territory and cutting more rebel supply lines. The Army was planning to continue their push to the west, squeezing the rebels between the advancing forces and the government-held areas in Damascus. By 30 May, rebel forces in Eastern Ghouta were surrounded and pleading for reinforcements and aid to be sent as they feared government troops were \\"preparing to commit more massacres\\". The next day, Hisham Jaber, a retired Lebanese army general who heads the Middle East Center for Studies and Political Research in Beirut, said that government troops cleared up to 80 percent of the areas around the capital during the offensive. On 2 June, during intense clashes between rebels and government forces in the Jobar district of Damascus, a car bomb exploded near a police station, killing nine policemen.Car bombing in Damascus kills nine Also, near the Lebanese town of Ain el-Jaouze, which is close to the border area between Lebanon and Syria, and Damascus itself, Hezbollah fighters attacked a rebel rocket team which was reportedly preparing to fire rockets into Shi'ite areas of the Lebanese Beqaa Valley. 14‚Äì17 rebels and one Hezbollah fighter were killed. On 4 June, state TV claimed that government troops had pushed out rebels from the Jobar district. Opposition sources were not available for comment on the claim. Government troops, reinforced by hundreds of Hezbollah fighters, attempted to infiltrate Madhamiya. Opposition activists claimed that during the attempt, two Hezbollah members, including a field commander, were killed. More government forces were also being deployed at Darayya. On 11 June, rebel forces suffered heavy casualties when 27 of their fighters were killed in an Army ambush in the al-Marj area of Eastern Ghouta, while they were attempting to break through the military blockade to bring in supplies. Another seven fighters were missing. On 15 June, state TV reported that government troops had captured the Ahmadiyeh suburb of Damascus, which is part of Eastern Ghouta. A rebel commander confirmed there was fighting in the area a day earlier. An Army source also claimed that troops captured parts of the nearby town of Khamissiyeh. On 16 June, a large car-bomb was detonated at an Army checkpoint outside the Mazzeh Military Airport, killing 10 soldiers and wounding 10 others. According to SOHR, the car-bomb was followed by smaller explosions from rockets fired by rebels. Battle for the suburbs On 18 June, the Army launched operations in an attempt to storm rebel-held parts of the Damascus Qaboun district. As of 22 June, the rebels were still managing to hold the military forces back. The Army was also making attempts to storm the Barzeh district,Syrian regime, rebels step up offensives against each other as international community begins where rebels were defending against the military's push. On 19 June, Army and Hezbollah forces clashed with rebels near the Khomeini hospital in the village of Zayabiyeh, close to the Shiite Sayyidah Zaynab Mosque. Government forces were attempting to capture villages near Zayabiyeh and Babila, which were both shelled by the Army. The Army was reportedly advancing towards Zayabiyeh, which is just south of the Damascus suburb in which the shrine was located. State TV claimed that government troops managed to capture the neighborhood of al-Bahdaliya, outside Sayyidah Zaynab, while the rebels claimed of being able to capture the hospital. On 20 June, Army forces were slowly but steadily advancing in the Al-Murj area of Eastern Ghouta, where they had captured several towns, and were also advancing in the Sayyidah Zaynab area. Rebels confirmed they were still surrounded in Eastern Ghouta, with no way of escape. In the coming weeks, Hezbollah and Iraqi Shi'ite militia forces captured the areas of Bahdaliyeh and Hay al Shamalneh on the south-eastern approaches to the capital. On 25 June, the attack on Qaboun had entered its sixth day. Army forces also launched a large offensive on other districts across Damascus and its outskirts. According to SOHR, \\"The army is trying to take over Qaboon, Barzeh, Jobar, Al-Hajar Al- Aswad and Yarmouk\\". They also added that \\"The army doesn't have the capacity to take over these neighborhoods, and the rebels are fighting back. But the humanitarian situation there is catastrophic.\\" Still, rebels stated that the Army was making a \\"grinding advance\\" against them and they were in fear of losing arms supply routes into the capital, which would be a severe blow to their attempts to capture Damascus. By 27 June, according to SOHR, the Syrian Army took control of parts of Barzeh. On 6 July, government forces overran the industrial area of Qaboun. With the capture of the industrial area Qaboun was besieged and rebel lines towards the town of Harasta were cut. T-72 tanks surrounded the district while artillery on high ground in the center of the capital heavily shelled Qaboun for a week. On 13 July, the Army captured the al-A'mri mosque in Qaboun. On 14 July, a government official stated that Army troops had recaptured 60 percent of the Jobar district. Reporters were led on a military tour of the recaptured areas which suffered massive destruction. Fighting was also continuing around the al-A'mri mosque in Qaboun after the military captured it along with 200 people who were inside at the time.Syrian troops advance against rebels in key neighborhoods on edge of capital On 15 July, government troops backed by tanks and artillery moved into Qaboun after breaching rebel defenses. Opposition activists claimed Republican Guards troops detained hundreds of people in public places to prevent rebel fighters from hitting their forces. The next day, rebels sent reinforcements to the district. Continued fighting On 21 July, government forces ambushed a rebel force near the town of Adra, northeast of Damascus. 49 rebels were killed. An elite Republican Guard officer who led the ambush was also killed.Activists: Kurds Free Al-Qaida-Linked Commander On 26 July, pro- government Palestinian officers claimed to had captured a third of the rebel- held Yarmouk camp in fighting in which government Palestinian militias were also involved.Syrian Troops Advance In Central City Two days later, rebels claimed to had captured the Jobar-Qaboun highway, however it was not independently confirmed. On 6 August, a possible mutiny occurred in the ranks of the government forces, after hundreds of Druze militiamen belonging to the \\"popular committees\\" militias handed their weapons back in and abandoned their posts in Jarmana district, choosing to return home. The desertions were either due to the arrest of a Druze militia leader, the militiamen not receiving their salaries or the militia's unwillingness to let their area be used as a platform to shell East Ghouta. On the next day, 62 rebels were killed and eight went missing after another Army ambush near Adra. On 10 August, the Syrian army stormed the town of al-Ghazlaniya and several houses were raided. Territories held by government forces, by rebels or under continuous clashes as of September 2013. On 16 August, mortar fire by the Syrian Army on the Mleha district, southeast of Damascus, killed at least 14 civilians, four of them children. The evening's bombardment came as troops pressed a months-old offensive in the suburbs of Damascus in a bid to clear the region of rebel rear bases, according to SOHR. Ghouta gas attacks On 21 August, an alleged chemical attack on the Ghouta region claimed lives of hundreds of people, both civilians and rebels. Estimates of dead varied from 355 up to 1,429. On 22 August, according to the Syrian opposition, the Syrian Army launched a new offensive against rebel positions in Rif Dimashq. The Army entered Erbine, Harasta, Jobar, Zamalka and Ain Tarma, but without taking full control. They did however capture strategic points. Aftermath - Renewed Army Offensive Threatened by a Western intervention after the 2013 Ghouta attacks, the Syrian Army had repositioned in early-September. On 1 September, 46 rebel fighters were killed after they attacked Army positions in Rouhaiba, northeast of Damascus. The fighting began at dawn and lasted throughout the day, including air raids on Rouhaiba and clashes outside the town. The next day, for a third time in just over a month, government forces ambushed rebels in the industrial area of Adra killing 29 rebel fighters. On 3 September, rebels of the Free Syrian Army stormed a government position in the mountainous area of Al Qalamoun. On 6 September, the Army launched an operation with the apparent intention to retake the town of Mouadamiyat al- Sham. On 8 September, according to SOHR, fighting continued in the north of Mouadamiyat al-Sham. Once the threat of western air-strikes had passed, the Army launched a new offensive against rebel positions on 10 September, primarily in the southern suburbs of Damascus.

The etiologic agent is the larval development of botflies within the Cuterebra or Trypoderma genera, which occurs obligatorily in rodents and lagomorphs, respectively. Felines and canines serve as accidental hosts, but research suggests only by Trypoderma spp. Entrance into the body by first-instar larvae occurs via mucous membranes of natural orifices or open wounds as opposed to direct dermic penetration. Clinical signs In rabbits, hares, and lagomorphs, clinical signs usually do not appear. Subcutaneous cysts, warbles, may present upon larval deposition out of the body at maturation. Three forms in which cuterebriasis may present in canines and felines: * Myasis involves subcutaneous cyst formation due to third larval-instar maturation, occurring about 30 days after entry into the body. Cysts are often found on the face, neck, and trunk, but location varies with larval migration within the host. Serous discharge may be observed from these cysts, which are typically 3-5 mm in diameter and include a central pore through which the larvae respire. This pore also serves as a means of exit for the larvae, which occurs between 3 and 8 weeks after entry., p. 213. *Cerebrospinal cuterebriasis results from larval migration to the brain. This is seen in cats, and is the proposed cause for feline ischemic encephalopathy and a suggestive causative agent of feline idiopathic vestibular disease. Symptoms of this type of presentation include lethargy, seizures, blindness, abnormal vocalization or gait, circling, and abnormal or no reflex responses. When affecting the central nervous system, cats are known to exhibit violent sneezing attacks that can begin weeks prior to manifestation of other clinical signs. *Respiratory disease results when larval migration occurs through the trachea, pharynx, diaphragm, or lungs. Cuterebriasis has been increasingly noted as a cause for dyspnea in felines. Diagnosis Definitive diagnosis can only occur with positive identification of the larvae. This involves radiologic imaging (preferably MRI, which can reveal larval migration tracks and in some cases the larvae themselves), as well as surgical exploration during which larvae can be removed and examined for identification. Identification of exact species is often impossible, as the instars of the various Cuterebra and Trychoderma spp. exhibit significant resemblance, but identification as a Cuterebra botfly is sufficient for diagnosis as cuterebriasis. Typically, a third larval-instar is found and identifiable by its dark, thick, heavily spined body. Treatment Subcutaneous cysts may be surgically opened to remove less-mature bots. If matured, cysts may be opened and Cuterebra may be removed using mosquito forceps. Covering the pore in petroleum jelly may aide in removal. If larvae are discovered within body tissues, rather than subcutaneously, surgical removal is the only means of treatment. Ivermectin may be administered with corticosteroids to halt larval migration in cats presenting with respiratory cuterebriasis, but this is not approved for use in cats. A cure for cerebrospinal cuterebriasis has not been reported.

It lies on what were formerly the lands of the Pilatapa. It is situated about north east of Blinman and north west of Broken Hill, on the plains between the northern end of the Flinders Ranges and Lake Frome. The land is part of the traditional lands of the Adnyamathanha people. It has been recorded that the name 'Wooltana' is a corruption of an Aboriginal (presumably Adnyamathanha) word, 'ooltulta'. However, it is unclear what that word means. The station contains the Paralana Hot Springs, which issue from rich veins of uranium ore. Carbon dioxide, nitrogen, radon and helium bubble forth continuously. Because the Springs contain small amounts of uranium and radon, staying near the Springs for a prolonged period constitutes a health hazard. Living on the floor of the Springs is an extremophile algal mat that survives the warm temperatures of 62 ¬∞C and high radioactivity. The Springs are listed on the South Australian Heritage Register as a designated place of geological significance.  History  Donkey team carting wool bales at Wooltana Sheep Station, ca. 1915 The station was initially established by the pioneer John McTaggart who arrived in South Australia from Scotland in 1852. In 1856 McTaggart left the property near Mount Gambier where he was working and headed north with his brother-in- law John McCallum to search for suitable lands. Having found the plains of Wooltana, he returned to Mount Gambier and drove his flock of 1500 sheep, along with his wife and four children, via Port Augusta to Wooltana. The McTaggarts became at this time the northernmost European settlers in South Australia, with the nearest station being Arkaba Station some south. The area was struck by drought from 1863 to 1865 and McTaggart retired in 1882, leaving the property in the hands of his son, Lachlan McTaggart. The property was enlarged in 1907 when McTaggart acquired the neighbouring property, Paralana Station. Paralana Station occupied an area of , and when absorbed into Wooltana, the total area was brought to . A South Australian shearing record was set at Wooltana in 1912 when shearer G. Denman shore 274 sheep in 8 hours and 40 minutes. The record was broken in 1927 by a shearer from Arkaba Station completing 277. The McTaggart family sold the property in 1918 to father and son, A.J. McBride and Philip McBride of Burra for ¬£60,000. At the time the property comprised of leasehold and was stocked with 30,000 sheep as well as cattle, horses and camels. A.J. McBride died in 1928. Philip McBride would go on to become a leading member of the Menzies government, and a knight. In 1924 the area was affected by drought and two flocks totalling 9000 sheep were overlanded off the property to Hawker to be trucked further south. Over 30,000 sheep were shorn at Wooltana in 1928. During the drought of 1948 over 10,000 sheep were sold off from Wooltana. Hundreds of sheep died from lack of feed in the area and the station's flock was reduced to half its size. Wild dogs became problematic during the course of the drought, feeding on weakened sheep. In 1950, Wooltana served as a base for the dropping of 90,000 wild dog baits, containing strychnine, to reduce the population of the pest. The area was struck by drought in 1954 with rains finally falling in December, Wooltana receiving over a two-day period. Also in 1954, John French, a 74-year-old station employee, was accidentally shot dead while kangaroo hunting with others on the station. In 1954, the station was still owned by the McBrides. In 1984, Robert Cameron bought Wooltana for $1.9 million, believed to be a South Australian record price at that time. The land occupying the extent of the Wooltana pastoral lease was gazetted as a locality by the Government of South Australia on 26 April 2013 under the name 'Wooltana '.

Family background Coleman was born at home to a farm couple, Grover Cleveland Coleman (1913-1993) and Jewell Christeen Coleman (1916-1998) in Wilson in Lynn County south of Lubbock. A physician from nearby Slaton in Lubbock County came to the Coleman home and worked eight hours delivering him for a $15 fee. As a teenager, Coleman worked in the cotton fields for 50 cents an hour, but only after his own farm duties had been completed: \\"I thought, golly ... I may move to Lubbock,\\" then a \\"big city\\" of 30,000 persons. Coleman is an alumnus of Texas Tech University in Lubbock. Coleman's parents married in Clovis, New Mexico, and farmed in Wilson until 1973, when they moved to Lubbock. They are interred at Green Memorial Cemetery in Wilson. Coleman has one sibling. Coleman's daughters are Christy Carol Coleman Brijalba (born 1971) and Julie Ellen Coleman Lewis (born 1972) and four grandchildren. Radio career In Lubbock, young Coleman first worked for the RC Bottling Company. Then the door to radio opened for him in 1956 at KLLL, 1460 on the dial. His first time on the air was declared a failure, and Coleman was ordered to return to working on the transmitter. KDUB, however, soon hired him for on-air announcing. He went to other stations, such as KSEL, for which he played the \\"Top 40\\" hits in a night-time show called the Hi-D-Ho Hit Parade, referring to the Hi-D-Ho drive-in restaurant, which attracted a large number of young people. Coleman's program became the highest-rated radio show in Lubbock. Coleman became well known in the Lubbock area and was a personal friend of Buddy Holly, Snuff Garrett, and Waylon Jennings. He had just moved to Los Angeles, when he learned of the airplane crash which in 1959 claimed Holly's life. Coleman left KSELThe call letters KSEL (AM) are now assigned to a station in Portales, New Mexico. to return to KLLL to host a country music show. Under the ownership of the Larry Corbin family, Coleman was made a stockholder of KLLL. Coleman's afternoon show consisted of 1950s and 1960s favorites, many at listener request, interspersed with his comments about the West Texas weather, birthdays of celebrities, and any other information, often from personal experiences, that he thinks would interest his listeners, much of which would be called \\"old-fashioned\\", a proper venue for his oldies music. When the program was available, many listened loyally to Coleman via Internet connection to KDAV.

Tipe dei Successori Le Monnier, 1889, page 70. He trained as an artist of stained glass, closely studying Italian stained glass from the 14th and early 15th century to discover their techniques. He did so well that he was, erroneously, credited for rediscovering \\"the ancient manner\\" of painting on glass. He was sponsored by Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany, developing new stained-glass techniques. He avoided a composition of many separate pieces of colored glass by keeping the lead lines to a minimum and painting directly on the larger panes of glass with many colors of enamel pigments. Shortly afterwards he was asked (together with Tito Gordini) by patrons in Pisa to create stained-glass windows for the Pisa Baptistry. He also put his technique to practical use in churches of Pisa (San Paolo, 1853), Livorno, Grosseto, Siena, Perugia, Lucca, and Padua. He also helped to restore and protect frescoes. He worked on the frescoes in the Camposanto of Pisa and the frescoes by Taddeo di Bartolo in the sacristy of the church of San Francesco, Pisa.Encyclopedia Treccani entry. Some of his restorations were not without controversy. From 1869-1870, Botti was called to help restore the Giotto frescoes in the Scrovegni Chapel in Padua. He had been hired by recommendation of a technical committee, consisting of the Marquis and art-critic Pietro Selvatico, the engineer Benvenuto Benvenisti and the sculptor Gradenigo. The work was then interrupted for a decade, and restarted in 1880 and continued till 1899 under Antonio Bertolli, a student of Botti. History of Scrovegni Chapel . In 1873 he was nominated inspector of the Gallerie of Venice; and in 1883 director. From 1874 to 1887 he was resident academic of merit resident and professor of restorations and painting at the Academy of Fine Arts of Venice and in 1891 published the first catalogue of the works of art at the Gallerie of Venice.

It is formed by the crossing of Tutwiler's spleenwort (A. tutwilerae) with ebony spleenwort (A. platyneuron). The hybrid was produced in culture in 1954. It was not discovered in the wild until 1971, when it was found by Kerry S. Walter at Havana Glen, Alabama, the only known wild site for Tutwiler's spleenwort. Walter named it for Kathryn E. Boydston, an expert in fern culture. Except for the tip of its leaf blade, it largely resembles its ebony spleenwort parent. Description Asplenium √ó boydstoniae is a small fern, similar to ebony spleenwort. The stem is a shiny dark brown, its color extending almost to the tip of the leaf blade, where it becomes green. Most of the blade is cut into pinnae, but it has an elongated, lobed tip. The fronds of A. √ó boydstoniae can be up to or long and or wide. The stipe (the stalk of the leaf, below the blade) is long in medium-sized specimens and a glossy dark brown in color. Overall, the blade is lance- shaped, and truncated at the base. It is pinnately cut, having from 15 up to 27 pinnae, or from 25 to 35 in larger, cultivated specimens, on each side of the rachis (leaf axis). The tip of the blade is elongated, with the pinnae diminishing into fused lobes and then curved edges before reaching the acute tip. The dark glossy color of the stipe extends into the rachis, going about seven-eighths of the way up the length of the frond (including the stipe), extending further along the underside of the rachis than the upper side. The pinnae are sessile (stalkless), and may have a variety of shapes: roughly triangular, with one side distinctly longer than the other, lance-shaped, or slightly curved. In specimens produced in culture, the pinnae were quite regular in size (that is, similar in size to their immediate neighbors) and in shape, while they were more irregular in wild specimens. Illustrations show a small auricle at the base of each pinna, pointing towards the blade tip. Nonviable spores are borne in irregularly placed sori up to long. The sporophyte is triploid and has a chromosome number of 108. The literature does not discuss whether the species possesses the frond dimorphism typical of its parent A. platyneuron. A. √ó boydstoniae can potentially be confused with other Asplenium hybrids and orthospecies (non-hybrids) in the Appalachian Asplenium complex. Among orthospecies, it is most similar to A. platyneuron, from which it can be distinguished by its elongated blade tip, the green color on the apical one-eighth of its rachis, and, microscopically, by its abortive spores. It is similar to two other hybrids in the complex, Graves' spleenwort (A. √ó gravesii) and Kentucky spleenwort (A. √ó kentuckiense). In both of these, the pinnae have short stalks, rather than being sessile; the pinnae are fewer, typically from 5 to 12 rather than 25 or more; and the dark color of the stipe and rachis extends only halfway up the frond. It is easily distinguished from A. tutwilerae, which has fewer pinnae which are more pointed and dramatically irregular, and a longer stipe and shorter leaf blade. Taxonomy The species was first discussed by Herb Wagner, who produced it in culture in 1954 by breeding gametophytes of Tutwiler's spleenwort with those of ebony spleenwort, although he did not bestow a specific epithet on it. Wagner noted that it was unlikely to be discovered in the wild, except possibly in Hale County, Alabama (site of the only wild population of Tutwiler's spleenwort). The species was, indeed, first discovered in the wild there, in 1971, by Kerry S. Walter. Walter described the species in 1982, naming it √óAsplenosorus boydstonae in honor of Kathryn E. Boydston, an expert in the artificial culture of spleenworts and other ferns. He placed it in √óAsplenosorus to indicate its descent from walking fern, one of the hybrid parents of Tutwiler's spleenwort, which was often placed in the genus Camptosorus instead of Asplenium. In the following year, John W. Short, who did not recognize Camptosorus as a separate genus, transferred the combination to Asplenium and corrected the grammar of Walter's epithet, making it Asplenium √ó boydstoniae. Since then, phylogenetic studies have shown that Camptosorus nests within Asplenium, and current treatments do not recognize it as a separate genus. Distribution and habitat Asplenium √ó boydstoniae was produced in culture in the laboratory before it was ever discovered in the wild, and was probably the first fern to be so described. It is known in the wild only from Havana Glen, Hale County, Alabama. The type specimens were found growing on a moss- and crustose lichen- covered rock. The local rock is a conglomerate, with siliceous pebbles cemented in sandstone of the Pottsville Formation, which contains iron and small amounts of calcium. The soil pH is slightly acid (5 to 6).

He served in the Tasmanian House of Assembly from 1946 to 1964, including as Speaker of the House from 1959 to 1964. During his political career he simultaneously ran a pub in Hobart. Aylett was born in Waratah, Tasmania, as one of twelve children. His older brother Bill Aylett was a senator. In 1946 he was elected to the House of Assembly as a Labor member for Darwin. He was promoted to the ministry in December 1947 with responsibility for housing, initially as an honorary minister and then as Minister for Housing. He resigned from cabinet in April 1949 after a select committee found that he had misled parliament about the amount of materials held by the State Housing Authority. Aylett was a talented field hockey player and was playing at state level as late as 1952, when he represented Tasmania at the national championships in Perth. After being forced out of the ministry Aylett served as Chair of Committees from 1950 to 1955. In 1959 he transferred to the seat of Denison, after taking up the licence of a pub in Hobart. After the election he was elected to the speakership. In 1961, Opposition Leader Angus Bethune moved a motion of no confidence in the speaker, over allegations of misconduct relating to the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race. Bethune claimed that Aylett had entertained yachtsmen at \\"an alcoholic party\\" at Parliament House, had pulled beer in his pub while wearing the speaker's robes, had frequently been absent from the speaker's chair, and had been drunk while presiding over parliament. He denied the accusations, stating \\"every other member has fallen asleep in the House at one stage or another\\", and the motion failed. In March 1962, Aylett was fined ¬£30 for serving alcohol in his pub during prohibited hours. The controversies led the ALP caucus to press him to resign, which he resisted. In December 1963, he lost the party's endorsement for the 1964 state election. He remained as Speaker, but subsequently became an independent and lost his seat at the election. He died in 1966 in Double Creek.

The facilities of the station occupy both sides of Route 27, with the main inspection building on the south side and a pair of residences on the north side. The inspection building is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, finished in brick veneer, with single-story garage wings extending from either side. A metal porte-cochere extending across two lanes provides shelter to vehicles as they are processed crossing the border. The building interior is divided into three sections, with a central lobby area separating service areas for immigration and customs.

Both are single- story vernacular Cape style wood frame structures clad in vinyl siding. They are basically rectangular, with a shed-roof section projecting from the front. The projecting section has the main entrance at the center, flanked by narrow windows. The outer bays of the front facade have standard sash windows. The Coburn Gore station was built in 1931, during the first phase of a major program in which the United States government sought to improve its border security while producing jobs during the Great Depression. This program was motivated by rampant smuggling during Prohibition, the increased use of the automobile, the introduction of immigration quotas based on the country of origin, and an increase in smuggling that was a consequence of Prohibition. Due to the remote location, this station was built to include housing for its principal officers. The designs of the buildings generally follow standard drawings developed for border stations built during this period. The border station was listed on the United States National Register of Historic Places in 2014.

His parents hailing from the South Canara district of Coastal Karnataka, later moved to Mumbai. His father K. S. Nayak retired from his services as a Banker with Canara Bank and is currently engaged in the practice and propagation of Vipassana meditation under the aegis of the Vipassana International Academy. Sudhir's mother, Suvarny Nayak is also engaged in teaching music and also performs religious and devotional songs in Hindi, Marathi, Kannada, Konkani, etc. through music concerts. Sudhir Nayak holds a bachelor's degree in Commerce from Pune university studying at MES's Garware College of Commerce, Pune. Music education  Following his father's inclination, Sudhir was introduced to Indian music at the age of eleven, when Sudhir and his brother started learning the Tabla from Pandit Madhukar Samant of Goregaon, Mumbai at his music class named ‚ÄòSwar- Ninad‚Äô which facilitated Sudhir to listen and relate to sounds of different musical instruments taught at the class. In the meantime, he also got acquainted with Hindustani Raag Sangeet through Pandit Pundalik Prabhu who used to visit their residence to teach vocal music to his mother. But Sudhir's actual initiation in Music followed his association with the legendary Harmonium maestro Pandit Tulsidas Borkar in 1983 when Borkarji started frequenting to his residence to teach Marathi Natya Sangeet to his mother. The captivating persona of Pandit Tulsidas Borkar and the subtle touches used by him while playing the Harmonium coupled with the grace with which he approached the instrument, deeply attracted young Sudhir to pursue learning the art from him. Seeing Sudhir's fascination, Borkarji accepted Sudhir as his disciple which enabled Sudhir to learn and imbibe the stylistic techniques used by his Guru and grand Guru Pandit P. Madhukar (Madhukar Pednekar) greatly influencing and enriching Sudhir's style of exploring the Harmonium as a solo instrument apart from playing it as an accompanying instrument for vocal music. Pandit Tulsidas Borkar and Pandit Jitendra Abhisheki Another great turn in Sudhir's life was his association with legendary vocalist and composer Pandit Jitendra Abhisheki, whose music and versatility greatly inspired Sudhir's journey as a student of music. His taleem from Panditji in Pune from 1988 till his demise in 1998 allowed Sudhir to gain knowledge of the intricacies of Hindustani Raag Sangeet and the nuances in the styles and approach of different Gharanas and Gayakis. Sudhir also accompanied Pandit Jitendra Abhisheki on the harmonium for his vocal concerts and also assisted him in composing music for different projects.http://ragatunes.com/MyRagaTunes/sudhir.nayak/readmore?fieldid=50 Sudhir also benefitted from the guidance he received from Shri.

History  Telj√§ is considered to be the predecessor of Medieval Ulvila town and the 1558 founded city of Pori.

In the Roman Catholic Church a consistory is a formal meeting of the College of Cardinals called by the pope. There are two kinds of consistories, extraordinary and ordinary.Code of Canon Law Canon 353. An \\"extraordinary\\" consistory is held to allow the pope to consult with the entire membership of the College of Cardinals. An \\"ordinary\\" consistory is ceremonial in nature and attended by cardinals resident in Rome. For example, the pope elevates new cardinals to the College at a consistory; Pope Francis has called consistories for ceremonies of canonization. A meeting of the College of Cardinals to elect a new pope is not a consistory, but a conclave. History The term consistory comes from the ; \\"stand together\\".Papal Consistory by Kevin Knight (Catholic Encyclopedia, 2009) Early popes conferred with their Roman presbytery which included the deacons appointed to oversee different parts of Rome. This tradition continued as deacons were replaced with cardinals and those cardinals (from among whom the pope was chosen) continued to meet at the request of successive popes. Consistories became an opportunity for the pope to decide matters of state and dispense justice directly, with the support and advice of Roman bishops and those bishops from other regions who happened to be in Rome. Pope Leo IV ordered that consistories be held twice weekly. Pope John VIII relaxed that edict slightly and an order of twice-monthly consistories. With the Gregorian Reform, the Church limited outside influences on the papacy and the selection of popes and the power of cardinals increased. Tradition developed that the pope would use consistories (closer to twice-yearly by the 17th century) to reveal a list of those that were to be elevated to the rank of cardinal. Eventually, responsibility for matters of justice was transferred to the Roman Rota and the functions of the Church were transferred to the Roman Curia reducing the need for regular consistories. Subsequently, consistories became primarily ceremonial in function. Consistory for the creation of cardinals Medal of the consistory of Pope Paul II (c. 1466 or 1467) At a consistory for the creation of cardinals, the pope creates new cardinals in the presence of a number, if not all, of the cardinals. Though the names of the new cardinals have been announced in advance, they only become cardinals at the consistory when the pope formally publishes the decree of elevation, even if the new cardinal is not present. New cardinals present are presented with their rings, zucchetti (small skullcaps), and birette (four-cornered silk hats) by the pope. The zucchetto and the biretta are scarlet, the distinctive color of cardinals' vesture. At the consistory new cardinals, with certain exceptions, are assigned titular churches in the Diocese of Rome. Recent consistories Pope Benedict XVI in 2007 and 2010 held a day-long meeting with the entire College, the cardinals designate, and various advisers on the day preceding the Consistory of Creation. Francis followed this custom for his first two consistories. His 2014 consistory for creating new cardinals was preceded by an extraordinary consistory where Cardinal Walter Kasper gave an address designed to launch the discussions of the Synod on the Family held later in the year. In 2015 a similar extraordinary consistory on the eve of a consistory to create cardinals discussed the reform of the Roman Curia just a few days before Francis formed the Council of Cardinals to advise him on that reform. In total, Benedict held five consistories. Pope Francis has held six consistories at roughly annual intervals, .

National Ministry of Health statistics indicate that the number of violent incidents against hospitals and medical staff increased from about 10,000 in 2005 to more than 17,000 in 2010. A survey by the Chinese Hospital Association reported an average of 27.3 assaults per hospital per year in 2012, up from 20.6 assaults per hospital per year in 2006. In 2012, an editorial in The Lancet described the situation as a \\"crisis\\" for the practice of medicine in China. Causes Many of the reported attacks on Chinese medical practitioners have been by patients or their family members who were dissatisfied with the care they received. In one widely publicized incident in March 2012, a patient suffering from ankylosing spondylitis and tuberculosis used a knife to attack several doctors in Harbin after the patient was refused a drug treatment that he had requested. One doctor who had not been involved in the patient's case died. In August 2012, the family and friends of a patient who died in surgery in southern Nanchang started a \\"full-scale melee\\" that involved more than 100 hospital personnel; the hospital staff armed themselves with sticks and mace for self-protection. In November 2013 several hundred doctors and nurses protested at the No. 1 People's Hospital in Wenling after a patient dissatisfied with his sinus surgery overpowered security personnel and stabbed three doctors. Violence may stem from patient dissatisfaction with care, costs associated with insurance premiums, unrealistic expectations, and overworked and underpaid hospital staff, as well as the rising cost of health care due to the government's inability to subsidize hospital operations. Lack of a third-party formal dispute resolution system in many hospitals has been suggested as a factor, and the acceptance of bribes or good-faith money in the form of red packets has been implicated. Media coverage, and a lack of health literacy amongst the Chinese population, who may often seek unnecessary high-level care, have also been implicated. Yi Nao The phenomenon of Yi Nao () has been identified as a contributing factor in violence against medical personnel. Yi Nao is the organized disturbance of hospitals or medical staff, usually to obtain compensation for actual or perceived medical malpractice. Yi Nao is usually perpetrated by organised criminal groups hired by patients or their families, although Yi Nao gangs may also solicit activity. Yi Nao has been increasing in recent years. A 2013 article in the British Medical Journal describes Yi Nao gangs as consisting \\"largely of unemployed people with a designated leader. They threaten and assault hospital personnel, damage facilities and equipment, and prevent the normal activities of the hospital.\\" Citing a survey published in 2006 of 270 tertiary hospitals, over 73% of the hospitals reported experiencing Yi Nao. Response The Chinese Medical Association has issued a statement calling for system-wide reforms to be made. In October 2013 the Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China advised hospitals with over 2,000 beds to hire \\"at least 100 security guards\\". However, increased implementation of security guards, metal detectors, and legal threats has been criticised as failing to deal with the underlying causes of the violence. The International Business Times reported in November 2013 that hospital personnel at Zhongshan Hospital and Huashan Hospital were learning taekwondo from a martial arts instructor after a chief physician of the head of the otolaryngology department of Wenling Hospital was murdered by an angry patient in October 2013. Violence against doctors has been cited as one reason for a decrease in the popularity of medicine as a profession.

He wrote both solo piano works and parlor songs. Heins' pieces show a special pianoesque ability to fashion pretty melodies picturesquely in the salon style of the time. His competency on the keyboard led him to perform and compose. He composed the song 'Zwei Dunkle Augen', which was recorded by the tenor Fritz Wunderlich. Stylistically his music is similar to that of his older compatriot Carl Bohm. Robert Leonhardt, an operatic baritone who sang with the New York Metropolitan Opera company between 1913 and 1922, made numerous recordings for many major record labels, both in Europe and in the United States. An early recording he made on Gramophone 42325 with matrix number 1113B[54] was \\"Zwei dunkle Augen\\" by Carl Heins. Leonhardt recorded it onto a 78rpm in October 1901 when he was 24.

The manga is mirrored from its original to read from left to right. Starting with the sixth volume, many of the names were changed to the ones used in the Phuuz English version of the anime, even though the dub never aired in North America. This translation is rated Teen. Since then, American publisher DrMaster took over the licenses of several manga series, including Crayon Shin-chan, from ComicsOne. No new volumes of Crayon Shin-chan were released under the DrMaster imprint. On July 28, 2007, DC Comics' manga division CMX announced the acquisition of the Crayon Shin-chan manga. The CMX version is rated Mature instead of Teen from ComicsOne, because of nudity, sexual humor, and bad language. The first volume was released on February 27, 2008, with uncensored art, and the style of jokes that frequent the Adult Swim dub with some throw backs to the original version, such as his original greeting. However, volume 10 omitted a gag which was in the ComicsOne version.

It was opened in a series of sections between 1867 and 1928. It commences at Rockhampton and extends west to Winton. History Following the separation of Queensland from the colony of New South Wales in 1859, Queensland consisted of a vast area with a non-indigenous population of approximately 30,000 people, most of who lived in the southeast corner of the colony. The new Queensland Government was keen to facilitate development and immigration, and had approved the construction of the Main Line from Ipswich, about to the fertile Darling Downs region in 1864. This was the first narrow gauge () main line in the world.Kerr, J. 'Triumph of Narrow Gauge', Booralong Publications, 1990 Following the establishment of the settlement of Rockhampton in 1858, and the discovery of gold at nearby Canoona in 1859, there were calls for improved land transportation in the region. Despite the goldrush being short-lived, it established Rockhampton as the main port for Central Queensland, and the Queensland Parliament approved the Central West line once the Main Line had proven the viability of the controversial narrow gauge. The first section opened to Westwood, the place where the roads to Taroom, Springsure, Peak Downs and the central west diverged, from Rockhampton, in September 1867. Freight being carried by bullock teams from further west found no advantage to transferring to rail for such a short distance, and so the government was forced to extend the line in sections from 1874, reaching Blackwater in 1877 and the Nogoa River in 1879, leading to the establishment of the town of Emerald. Construction then proceeded west virtually tracking the Tropic of Capricorn, with settlements developing once the line was built. It reached Barcaldine in 1886 after crossing the Drummond Range using 1 in 33 (3.3%) grades and radius curves (the tightest used on the system) to avoid major earthworks, and reached Longreach in 1892. The town of Winton became the terminal of the Great Northern line from Townsville in 1899, and became a major livestock loading point for the central western region. Linking Winton to the Central West line was seen as providing additional markets for the livestock, and the extension opened in September 1928. Export coal traffic Coal had been noted by the earliest explorers to the Central Queensland region, but domestic demand was met by relatively small local mines. In the 1950s major exploration programs identified large reserves of high quality coal, and a series of mines and associated railways have been developed since that time. The first line, to the Callide mine, was connecting to the Callide Valley branch opened in 1953, with coal railed to Gladstone via Mount Morgan (the Abt rack section being bypassed in 1952) and Rockhampton. Further mines opened, increasing tonnage to the point where a new direct line to Gladstone was built, known as the Moura Short line, opened in 1968. Other mines were developed in the Blackwater-Emerald region, with a series of lines built to enable the coal to be railed to Gladstone, known as the Blackwater system. The individual branch lines in this system are detailed in the Branch Lines section below. Coal is also railed to the Stanwell Power Station. Coal tonnage railed to Gladstone steadily increased, requiring innovations such as multiple locomotives (up to 6 diesel-electrics and then 5 electric) distributed front and mid-train and controlled by radio (Locotrol) from the front locomotive, introduced in 1976. The length of the longest trains on the system is 1.7 km. System upgrades As a result of the growing traffic volumes, CTC signalling was introduced between Rockhampton and Blackwater in 1979-80. In November 1980 a new line from Gracemere to Rocklands (junction with the North Coast line) opened, enabling coal trains to bypass Rockhampton. The only tunnel on the system was ‚Äòdaylighted‚Äô as part of an upgrade in 1983. The system was electrified at 25 kV, 50 Hz in 1987, including the line as far as Emerald. For details of this project see Rail electrification in Queensland. Duplication of the line has occurred in sections, listed from east to west below: * Rocklands ‚Äì Stanwell (18 km) opened 2014 * Westwood ‚Äì Windah (10.3 km) * Tunnel ‚Äì Aroona (19.8 km) * Duaringa ‚Äì Wallaroo (11.1 km) * Dingo ‚Äì Bluff (24 km) opened 2015 *Bluff ‚Äì Rangal (29 km) opened ~2011 Approximately 60% of the 199 km Rocklands ‚Äì Rangal section is duplicated. Branch lines QR loco 1740 at Springsure Station, ~1991 Jericho station, 1908 Weir at Dingo, 1878 1604 crossing the westbound Midlander, September 1989 A series of traditional branch lines were built to connect to the Central West line, and these are listed from east to west below. The more recent lines to serve coal mines are listed separately below. Kabra ‚Äì Theodore and Lawgi (Dawson Valley line and Callide Valley line), opened in sections between 1898 and 1932, it included a section of rack railway to Mt Morgan, which was replaced by a deviation in 1952. The last sections of this system closed on 26 June 2013. Nogoa ‚Äì Springsure, . This line opened in 1887 to provide access to a fertile valley. Although built to pioneer standards such as 10 tonne axle load, it has remained in service, with the first 43 km to Wurba Junction being upgraded in conjunction with the opening of a coal loading balloon loop serving the Minerva mine in 2006. The section beyond Wurba Junction was closed on 26 June 2013. Emerald ‚Äì Blair Athol, . This line was opened via Capella to Clermont (100 km) in 1884 to serve the developing Peak Downs copper mine. It was extended north to the Blair Athol coal mine in 1910, and a short extension was opened in 1912 to Birimgan to access a source of timber for sleepers in conjunction with the Great Western Railway proposal. The line was upgraded to 15 tonne axle load in 1979. A connection to the separate but proximate Blair Athol-Mackay line was opened in 1986, providing the Emerald district with rail access to the Mackay port, and closed on 26 June 2013. Blair Athol had the first Rail ambulance in Queensland. Blair Athol coal, considered the best steaming coal in Queensland, was railed to Mount Isa via Winton and Hughenden in the 1960s, a distance of 1,510 km. Jericho ‚Äì Yaraka, . Opened to Blackall in 1908, the line was extended as part of the Great Western Railway proposal between 1913 ‚Äì 1917, with Yaraka becoming the terminus when construction halted due to difficulties in obtaining materials and labour due to the First World War. Intended to reach Windorah, construction never resumed. The line closed in 2005. Blackall had one of the last Rail ambulances in Queensland, withdrawn in 1990. Aramac Tramway, . Aramac was one of the few existing settlements in the region when the Central West line was being constructed, but that line maintained its due west path and was built well south of the town. After unsuccessfully lobbying for the State to build a line, the Aramac Shire Council funded what was technically a tramway (but built to QR standards), providing the line to Barcaldine which opened in July 1913. The line was invaluable during wet weather, as the heavy clay ‚Äòblack soil‚Äô became impassable for days after rain. Once an all-weather road was provided, the line was seen as a burden on rate payers and closed in 1975. Winton ‚Äì Springvale - Construction started on a line heading south west from Winton as part of the Great Western Railway proposal in 1912, and about was built before work halted in 1917. Although construction resumed in 1920, it was again abandoned without ever being opened for traffic, and was dismantled as a work creation program in the 1930s depression. Contemporary coal lines Rangal ‚Äì Kinrola, 18.5 km, opened 1967 Blackwater ‚Äì Laleham 41 km, opened 1970 Burngrove ‚Äì Gregory 65 km, opened 1980. This line was connected to the Goonyella system in 1983. 2 spurs branch from this line, to Ensham (13.4 km) opened 1997 and Gordonstone (12.8 km), opened 1992. Sagitarrius ‚Äì Curragh 12 km, opened 1983 Kinrola ‚Äì Rollestone (Bauhinia line), 107 km, opened 2005. This line was not electrified when built, with electrification commissioned in December 2014. Services In 1892 the Central Western Mail train, with first class sleeping carriages and a travelling post office (TPO), departed Rockhampton three times each week at 10pm, arriving in Longreach at 5pm the following day. Second class sleeping cars were introduced in 1896. The service was extended to Winton when the line was extended there in 1928. Sleeping cars were also provided to Clermont, Springsure and Blackall. Foot-warmers were introduced in the first class compartments on trains departing Rockhampton in 1911, and provided each winter until 1958. The first buffet car in Queensland operated between Emerald and Longreach commencing in 1912. The TPO was withdrawn in 1932 as an economic measure. The air-conditioned Midlander was introduced on 4 May 1954. It was replaced by the Spirit of the Outback in November 1993, commencing from Brisbane and terminating at Longreach, Winton losing its passenger service from that time.

The case was the second case heard by the High Court. Background Mr. Bond had been an employee of the Post and Telegraph Department of the State of Victoria, before it was transferred to the Commonwealth postal service on 1 March 1901, soon after federation, in accordance with Section 69 of the Constitution. Transfer of certain departments. Following the transfer, the Commonwealth paid Bond wages at the rate of ¬£132 per annum instead of his previous wage of ¬£150, and sued for the balance, under section 84 of the Constitution, Transfer of officers. which guaranteed commensurate wages for employees transferred to Commonwealth jurisdiction. Mr Bond was represented by Isaacs . Mitchell argued for the Commonwealth that the claim was not enforceable in a Court of law by virtue of sec. 78(1) of the Public Service Act 1902, which came into effect on 1 January 1903, and provided: :\\"Nothing in this Act shall authorize the expenditure of any greater sum out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund by way of payment of any salary than is from time to time appropriated by the Parliament for that purpose\\"‚Ä¶ s 78 Payments. Decision Chief Justice Griffith, held that the Constitution did grant rights, which in Bond's case was a right to continued employment and receive equivalent wages. Regarding the Commonwealth‚Äôs case ‚Äì the Court held that in the face of Bond's constitutional right, whether sec. 78(1) of the Public Service Act, was or was not defensible in a court became irrelevant and the judgment ruled it unnecessary to consider the question altogether. Consequences The intention apparent in the Constitution, was that public servants who transferred to the Commonwealth would continue to receive the same benefits they received from the States. The High Court's decision in Deakin v Webb, finding that Commonwealth officials and public servants were not liable to pay State income tax, increased their effective salary. Higgins who appeared in the High Court on behalf of Alfred Deakin wrote in 1905 that \\"The man in the street is startled and puzzled.

Aims The Fair Admissions Campaign aims to open all state funded schools in England and Wales to all pupils regardless of the religion of pupils or their parents and views the current admissions system as unfair. Although some of the supporting members of the Fair Admissions Campaign are opposed to state-funded faith schools the Fair Admissions Campaign itself is not. History Many of the organizations which would later become supporting members of the Fair Admissions campaign wrote a letter to the Secretary of State for Education on 16 December 2012 which called for end to faith-based selection policies at English and Welsh state funded schools. The Fair Admissions campaign was officially launched in June 2013. Support A ComRes poll conducted on behalf of the Accord Coalition indicated that 73% of British adults agreed that 'State funded schools, including state funded faith schools, should not be allowed to select or discriminate against prospective pupils on religious grounds in their admissions policy.' The Fair Admission Campaign is supported by both local and national organizations including the Accord Coalition, the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, the British Humanist Association, British Muslims for Secular Democracy, ICoCo Foundation, the Centre for Studies on Inclusive Education, Ekklesia, the Hindu Academy, the Liberal Democrat Education Association, Richmond Inclusive Schools Campaign, the Runnymede Trust, the Socialist Educational Association, the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches. On 8 October 2013 an Early day motion was tabled by Barry Sheerman, the motion currently has 12 signatories which include MP's from the Labour Party, Liberal Democrats and Green Party of England and Wales.

Law regarding religious selective admissions Section 85 of the Equality Act 2010 provides protection for pupils against discrimination based on protected characteristics, which includes religion and belief, in the admission of the pupil to the school.

At altitude, the Piyerloti Hill is named after the French naval officer, novelist and Orientalist Pierre Loti (1850‚Äì1923), who used to visit the site during his time in Istanbul. The historic Rabia Kadƒ±n Caf√© on the top of the hill, at which he used to drink Turkish coffee, was later renamed also after him. Another establishment on the hill, of which name recalls him, is a restaurant named after his novel Aziyad√©, which is the name of the main character as an Ottoman woman. There are six historic mansions on the hill, which were restored in 2000 and converted into hotels having 130-bed capacity in 68 rooms in total.

After receiving his degree in economics, he worked in a factory. However, in 1950, Grossman was drafted into the United States Army and stationed in Germany. Defection In 1952, while serving in Austria, Grossman swam the Danube and became one of a handful of soldiers from the NATO nations who defected to the Eastern Bloc. Grossman later stated he defected because he feared prosecution by U.S. authorities for not declaring his membership in left-wing political organizations prior to his entering the army. Following assessment by Soviet authorities, Grossman was sent to East Germany, where he continued his studies in journalism at Karl Marx University.Thanksgiving for Odd Sort of Harvard Expatriate; www.nytimes.com; November 29, 1996 article; While in East Germany, Grossman was a good friend of his fellow US exile, the singer and actor Dean Reed.

Manthai functioned as the main port of the Anuradhapura Kingdom throughout its history. Historically known as Manthottam in Tamil and Manthota or Mahathiththa in Sinhalese, it is an important religious site in the island for the Hindus, due to the Ketheeswaram Kovil, one of the five Ishwarams dedicated to Shiva in the island.Arumugam pp-15 Etymology Manthai the present day name given by the locals for the town, is possibly a derivation from the ancient Tamil name Manthottam which may translate into Garden of the Deers. The term Manthottam is mentioned in many ancient Tamil epics. Sinhalese epics refer to both the town as well as the town of Mannar by the term Mahathittha. The place was also known as Rajarajapuram when the northern part of Sri Lanka was ruled by Raja Raja Chola I in the 10th century AD as mentioned in an inscription of the Cholas found in Manthai. History=Ancient history During the ancient period, Manthai was a center of international trade with trading contacts to the Red Sea, Persian Gulf, East Africa, Far East and Greater India as testified with archeological excavations.Cassie Chetty, Simon Coins of the Pandyan dynasty and Chola dynasty of the Sangam period were discovered in Manthai. With the likes of Arikamedu and Karaikadu of Tamil Nadu, Manthai was a major exporter of beads since the early first millennium AD. The Kuruntokai of Sangam literature mentions the Chera king Kuttuvan of Manthai, suggesting that Manthai was ruled by Senkuttuvan. According to Dr. Paul E. Peiris, an erudite scholar and historian, Thiruketheeswaram in Manthai was one of the five recognized Eeswarams of Siva in Lanka very long before the arrival of Vijaya in 600 B.C PaulEPieres, 1917 Rule of the Cholas During the reign of the Cholas, between the 10th and 11th Centuries C.E., the town had developed into a major port, with many highways and served as an important link between the island and the mainland Chola kingdom.Sastri, pp 172‚Äì173 Somewhere around 1070, Manthai, which was a thriving Chola seaport town came under attack from Vijayabahu, a Sinhalese monarch leading a military campaign to expel the Cholas from the island. The Cholas, who by then had lost control of most of the island, withdrew from Manthoddam, thus ending their century- long rule in the island. Under the rule of Raja Raja Chola I and his son Rajendra Chola I, was a Shaivite Hindu temple built known as Rajaraja Ishwaram Kovil, named after the king. Buried city Mathoddam is currently viewed as the only port on the island that could be called a \\"buried city,\\" with much of the ancient ruins under sand today. The existence of the Thiruketheeswaram temple attests to the antiquity of the port. Manthoddam finds mention as \\"one of the greatest ports\\" on the seaboard between the island and Tamilakam in the Tamil Sangam literature of the classical period (600 BCE - 300 CE).Perera Historical Sites=Thiruketheeswaram temple The Ketheeswaram temple situated at Manthai, is one of the five major Saiva temples in the island and among the 275 Paadal Petra Sthalams of Lord Shiva in the continent. The temple remains as a significant religious center for the Hindus in the country. The shrine's initial installment is credited to the indigenous Karaiyar Naga tribe, The Karaiyars claimed to be related to several classical period public figures hailing from the international port town, including the creator of the oldest extant Tamil literature by a Sri Lankan Tamil, the Sangam poet Eelattu Poothanthevanar.Xavier, J.T. (1977). ‚ÄúThe Land of Letters‚Äù. 8-13Muthuthampipillai. (1915). 56 Though there has been no substantial confirmations regarding the temple's original date of construction, the shrine is believed to have existed for possibly more than 2400 years together, with inspirational and literary evidence of the postclassical era ( 600BC - 1500AD) attesting to the shrine's classical antiquity. The temple along with other major Hindu and Buddhist shrines of worship, was destroyed by the Portuguese conquests of the late 16th century and its very stones were used to build the Mannar fort, a Catholic church and the Hammershield Fort at Kayts. The local Tamils under the urging of the famous Hindu reformer Arumuka Navalar rebuilt the present-day temple at its original site. Since outbreak of the Sri Lankan Civil War, the town and the temple has come under the occupation of the Sri Lankan military. Palavi Tank The Palavi Theertham is a tank situated near the Thiruketheeswaram temple. The Palavi tank is prospered by the river Palavi, which had been the outlet of Matale waters via Malwattu Oya and other natural waterways of the extensive basin. The sacred Palavi Theertham which was described in ancient Tamil hymns as sacred as the river Ganges, is used by the Hindus to offer rites and rituals for their ancestors. An effigy of Lord Ketheeswarar is immersed in the scared tank as a part of the ritual bath, during the annual temple festival. Ancient harbour Manthai, known as Mahathiththa during ancient times, was situated north of the mouth of the Malvathu River (Aruvi Aru). There is evidence of an ancient river bed that ran close to the ancient port site that allowed for river traffic. This allowed for the development of Manthai as the main port of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, dating back at least to the 3rd century B.C. Bohingamuwa, W. 2017a. Ancient Mahatittha (Mantai) in Sri Lanka: a historical biography. Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Sri Lanka 62(2): 23‚Äì50. During its early development Manthai likely traded predominantly with ports in India. After the 1st century A.D. Manthai appears to have developed into a regional hub soon becoming one of the most important ports in the maritime silk route. This is supported by various Persian, Sassanid, Greeco-Roman, Indian and Chinese artifacts and coins that have been found during excavations.An excavation in Mantai: city by the sea. Carswell, J., S. Deraniyagala & A. Graham. 2013. Aichwald: Linden Soft.ed An excavation by an international team of researchers in 2010 found archaeobotanical evidence of black Pepper, cloves and various cereals. In addition to these, pottery and semi-precious stones have been unearthed. These material were dated all the way from the 2nd century B.C. to the second millennium A.D., indicating a flourishing, cosmopolitan port. Kingwell-Banham, E., Bohingamuwa, W., Perera, N., Adikari, G., Crowther, A., Fuller, D., & Boivin, N. (2018). Spice and rice: Pepper, cloves and everyday cereal foods at the ancient port of Mantai, Sri Lanka. Antiquity, 92(366), 1552-1570. doi:10.15184/aqy.2018.168 While the Mahathiththa harbor and its river link to the city of Anuradhapura provided a valuable trade route, it also made the Anuradhapura Kingdom vulnerable to conquests with numerous South Indian invaders landing at Manthai and marching to the city along the Malvathu oya. The port seems to have diminished in importance with the collapse of the Anuradhapura Kingdom. Transportation The town is situated on the A32 Highway that runs between Mannar and Jaffna. The town of Adampan is located 5 km east of Manthai. Other towns in close proximity are Vankalai, Uyilankulam, Achchankulam, Andankulam etc. See also * Kudramalai * Mannar NotesReferences  Dr.Paul E.Pieris declared in 1917, at a meeting of the Royal Asiatic Society (Ceylon Branch), there was in Lanka five recognized ‚ÄòEeswararns‚Äô of Siva, which claimed and received adoration of all India. These were Tiruketheeswaram near Manthottam, Munneswaram, Thondeswaram, Tirukoneswaram and Naguleswaram. Royal Asiatic Society (Ceylon Branch) *Perera, B.J. ‚ÄúAlthough Mahathitha (Mathoddam) is first mentioned in connection with the landing of Vijaya‚Äôs second wife, a royal princess from the Pandyan Kingdom, there is no doubt that it was used as port by the Tamils long before the Aryan settlement in Ceylon. The existence of the Temple Tiruketheeswaram, the origin of which is not covered by existing records, is an indication of the antiquity of the port. Indeed Mahathitta is the only port in the Island which can be called a buried city. Mahathittha was a great port in the early centuries of the common era. Next we have the references in the Sangam literature of the Tamils describing Mahathitta as a great port.‚Äù Category:Towns in Mannar District Category:Manthai West DS Division ","title":"Manthai"},{"id":"40954000","text":"Zingiber spectabile is a species of true ginger, native to Maritime Southeast Asia. It is primarily grown in the West as an ornamental plant, although it has been used in South-East Asia as a medicinal herb. Name The scientific name of the species is Zingiber spectabile. \\"Zingiber\\" is originally from a Sanskrit word that means \\"shaped like a horn\\" and refers to the horn-shaped leaves of most species of ginger. \\"Spectabile\\" is derived from the Latin spectabilis, meaning 'visible' or 'spectacular'. The plant is commonly known in the West by the common name \\"beehive ginger\\", due to its unusual inflorescences which resemble a skep beehive. It is also referred to by the common names \\"Ginger wort\\" or \\"Malaysian ginger\\". Description Zingiber spectabile In common with most plants in genus Zingiber, the leaves of the plant are long and mostly oblong shaped, tapering to a single point at their tip. Under ideal circumstances, the plant can reach a height of , or even more. The plant's inflorescence is set atop a spike and can measure up to in height. The bracts attached to the structure can differ in colour, from white, to yellow, orange, or even red, often darkening as the bracts mature and develop. The flowers themselves are small, with purple petals and yellow spots, and a fragile, papery texture. Uses In Indonesia, the plant has been used in traditional medicine to treat inflammation of the eyes. It is prepared for use by pounding the leaves of the plant into a thick paste, and then topically applying it to the required part of the body. It has also been recorded being used to treat burns, as a treatment for headaches and back pain, and as an agent for food preservation. Academic research has found that the plant has antimicrobial properties, and significant concentrations of the Zerumbone synthase enzyme, which may be effective in treating colon cancer.

He reached fame in the 1970s and 1980s in Latin America. The name \\"Jinsop\\" means \\"Fire Star\\" in Korean.The singer Jinsop Ho has died in the Santa Elena province Personal life Jinsop was born in Seoul, South Korea. His father was an American diplomat named Fred Odirling, and his mother was a Korean woman named Myonghui. When he was a child in South Korea he was discriminated against for having a non-Korean father. He then moved to the United States because his father got work as an electrical engineer at NASA. When he was 15 years old he moved to Quito, Ecuador where his father began work as a diplomat at the research station. His parents returned to the United States, but he remained in Ecuador because he liked the country. At sixteen he studied at the Academia Cotopaxi and Anderson College where he met his wife Silvia Jarrin, who taught him Spanish with beginning language books, and with whom he had three children; Jinsop Junior, a business manager in South Carolina, Alexander, who studied systems engineering in Quito, and David, who earned a doctorate in economics.Softek - informacion variada en un solo lugar Beginning of singing career Jinsop, who spoke English and Korean, learned to sing in Spanish before learning how to talk it, since he had no knowledge of the language before arriving to Ecuador. Soon after, in 1972, Jinsop and his mother organized a music festival where they sang for a rock band called \\"Las Hormigas\\" (The Ants). At the conclusion of the festival, they won first prize, but people were angry because another band called The Apostles (who received greater applause) did not win, and so the crowd lit the dais on fire in protest. The prize was then taken from Jinsop and awarded to The Apostles. Jinsop fled the festival, but was arrested a few days later. Soon after he became a member of The Apostles, and one of the judges of the aforementioned festival, H√©ctor Napolitano, who was a famed singer at the time, invited him to the recording studio of the label Ifesa to interpret the songs of Paul Anka and other artists, and that is how he released his first album called Puppy Love, which reached major airplay throughout Ecuador, and which marked the beginning of his career as a solo artist. Years of popularity Jinsop's height of popularity was in the years 1973-1978, which is referred to as the epoch of \\"modern music\\" in Ecuador. At this time he sang songs written by Luis Padilla, Gustavo Pacheco, and covered the songs of James Brown, Simon and Garfunkel, Paul Anka, etc. At eighteen he moved to Guayaquil at the home of the composer and musician Gustavo Pacheco, a member of the group Boddega, who composed the following songs for Jinsop: \\"Ven chiquilla ven\\" (Come see, girl), \\"Rosas y claveles\\" (Roses and carnations), \\"Volvamos a empezar\\" (Let's start over), \\"Extra√±o\\" (Strange), \\"Hay un motivo por vivir\\" (There's a reason for living), and \\"Silvy\\" which was dedicated to his wife. The songwriter Luis Padilla wrote the song \\"Estrellita solitaria\\" (Lonely star) for Jinsop. Although Jinsop had some doubt because he sang Spanish-language songs with an accent, the producer Efr√©n Avil√©s explained to him that people liked his sound, and so they recorded these songs at the Ifesa studio, and Jinsop was widely accepted and praised. In 1973 he recorded his first album \\"Mi Oraci√≤n\\" (My Prayer) in the Ifesa and Orion studios (with music by the orchestra of Hector \\"Manito\\" Bonilla), which included hits such as: \\"Los campos verdes\\" (Green Fields), \\"Ven chiquilla ven\\" (Come see, girl), \\"Mi bella ni√±a\\" (My beautiful girl), \\"Yo pienso que tu eres la mujer\\" (I think you're the woman), \\"Silvy\\", and \\"Atar un lazo arriba de un rosal\\" (cover version of \\"Tie a Yellow Ribbon 'Round the Ole Oak Tree\\"). In his second album appeared the songs: \\"Estrellita solitaria\\" (Lonely star), \\"Caballo de acero\\" (cover version of \\"Iron horse\\", original by Christie), \\"Rosas y Claveles\\" (Roses and carnations), \\"Volvamos a empezar\\" (Let's start over) among others. In the 1980s he gave up music for several years. In 1986 he became an Ecuadorian citizen under the government of President Le√≥n Febres Cordero. He moved to the United States to work for some years, but returned to Ecuador where he said he wanted to spend the last years of his life. He divorced his wife who stayed in the U.S. with two of his sons. He continued to make music, and in 2011, suffering from lung problems, and on the advice of his doctors, he moved to a neighborhood named Mar√≠a Auxiliadorato in Ayangue, Santa Elena, Ecuador which is known for its hot springs. He moved to a beach-side inn with his youngest son Alexander, in hopes that the salty air of the beach would help him breathe better. He also suffered from a heart condition. His last performances were in Guayaquil on March 8, 2012 at the Simon Bolivar Convention Center alongside the Spanish singer Jeanette and the Argentine singer Elio Roca. He also performed on June 9, 2012 for Father's Day at the Hotel Oro Verde in Machala with the Uruguayan band Los Iracundos, Los Golpes, and the Argentine singer Leonardo Favio. Death His friend Arturo Cisneros said he missed a call from Jinsop June 24, 2012 at 3:50 am. He said he would forever wonder what Jinsop wanted to talk to him about at that hour. Later that morning, Jinsop was found in his home dead from cardiac arrest by his son Alexander.Jinsop of the Green Fields has died Three before his death, Jinsop's former wife Sylvia died of pancreatic cancer. The Guayaquilean songwriter and musician Gustavo Pacheco said that only three days before Jinsop's death, they had spoken about organizing a tour in August in New York, Los Angeles, Washington, and Chicago. Due to Jinsop's untimely death that tour would never happen. Jinsop's body was buried on June 26, 2012 at 5:00 pm, at the General Cemetery of Guayaquil.

This was one of a number of options taken. In some places community services were transferred to an existing mental health trust or hospital trust. In South West England there was considerable pressure for staff to establish social enterprises such as Peninsula Community Health to take on these services. Campaigners in Gloucestershire successfully challenged the decisionhttp://www.stroudagainstcuts.co.uk/fightback/healthcarecuts/38-healthcare/118-briefing- on-future-of-glos-nhs.html to establish a social enterprise to provide community health services there in 2012. Contracts to run NHS community services are subject to competitive tendering processes under the Health and Social Care Act 2012, so it is not clear whether these organisations will survive. The NHS community health services sector, not including mental health services is said to be worth ¬£9.7 billion - about 10% of the entire NHS budget. This is the sector in which competition from private providers such as Virgin Healthcare and Serco is most intense. There is a great deal of pressure to move NHS services out of hospitals and into the community, but up to now most of these services have been funded by block contracts. There are measures of activity but no outcome measures and no NHS tariff, so there is no financial incentive for providers to ensure services are effective. It remains to be seen what impact the instigation of Any Qualified Provider contracts will have on this sector. Community services have been repeatedly reorganised since the abolition of district health authorities in 1996. Established as NHS trusts they were under the same imperative to become NHS foundation trusts as existing trusts, but it seems unlikely that many of them will be able to pass the tests in their present form. Community healthcare trusts may provide services including: *District nursing, including out of hours nursing *Health visiting *School nursing *Community physiotherapy *Speech and language therapy *Community podiatry Free-standing community health trusts existing in 2013 * Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust * Bridgewater Community Healthcare (based in Wigan) * Cambridgeshire Community Services NHS Trust * Central London Community Healthcare NHS Trust (also provides services in Hertfordshire) * Croydon Community Health Services * Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Trust * Gloucestershire Care Services NHS Trust * Hertfordshire Community NHS Trust * Hounslow and Richmond Community Healthcare NHS Trust * Kent Community Health NHS Foundation Trust * Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust * Lincolnshire Community Health Services * Liverpool Community Health NHS Trust * Medway Community Healthcare * Norfolk Community Health and Care NHS Trust * Shropshire Community Health NHS Trust * Sussex Community NHS Trust * Tameside and Glossop Community Healthcare * Wirral Community NHS Trust See also :Category:Community health NHS trusts References Category:National Health Service (England) ","title":"Community health trust"},{"id":"40954117","text":"Pat Johnson may refer to: *Pat E.

Knopf and Random House in 2013. The book received praise from critics and was commercially successful. On October 13, 2013 The Lowland reached #5 of the New York Times Best-sellers list of combined print and ebooks. The book also was at #3 on the hardcover list. Plot=Part I Raised in Tollygunge in Calcutta, brothers Subhash and Udayan are inseparable; they find joy in fixing and listening to radios, learning Morse Code, and looking out for each other at school. When they leave home for university studies, their ideologies are challenged; Udayan embraces the Naxalite Movement while Subhash is more interested in further education in preparation for his career and leaves for graduate studies in Rhode Island. Subhash learns that despite the massive bloodshed as a result of the Naxalite Movement, all attention from the press is focused on the Vietnam War; this becomes crystal clear to him when his roommate Richard, an earnest student activist, ignorantly remarks \\"Naxalbari? What's that?\\" At the end of his first year in the United States, Subhash learns that Udayan has found a wife, Gauri. Part II Gauri, who meets Udayan through her brother, is at first apathetic to him. As time passes, however, they talk and trade ideas. Udayan tells of his CPI(M) days while Gauri discusses philosophy. Udayan proves his love for Gauri when he waits for her indefinitely outside a movie theater. Meanwhile, Subhash befriends Holly and her son Joshua, who he meets on a beach in Rhode Island. He learns that she is a single mother, separated from her husband Keith. They have sex one night while Joshua is at his father's place. Despite this, Subhash wonders at how Holly is able to be so calm when communicating with \\"someone who had hurt her\\" in Subhash's mind; this is evident when Subhash notices how she is able to calmly relay Keith directions over the telephone on how to treat an ill Joshua who is in his care for the weekend. Holly ultimately decides to go back to Keith for Joshua's sake. Shortly after beginning his third year, Subhash learns from his parents in a letter that Udayan has been killed. Part III Subhash returns to Calcutta to find Gauri staying with his parents, who do not treat her with respect. Gauri is pregnant with Udayan's child. His mother Bijoli and his father plan to take the child and forsake Gauri. He asks what happened to Udayan but parents refuse to tell him but Gauri does tell him after initially offering some resistance. After successfully fleeing from the paramilitary police one night, the police come to his parents' house. The police chief orders his parents and Gauri onto the street and threaten to kill them if Udayan does not surrender himself. Udayan, nearby in the water, surrenders and is subsequently shot and killed. In order to prevent his parents from taking custody of Gauri's child and out of respect for Udayan, Subhash asks Gauri to marry him and to come and live with him in Rhode Island. Part IV Gauri agrees to Subhash's proposal, but is still distraught. She distracts herself, however, by going to the nearby university and sitting-in on philosophy lectures. She then gives birth to Bela. Shortly after, Subhash and Gauri have sex for the first time, although it is unsatisfying for both parties. Subhash proves to be an outstanding parent to Bela, and this causes Gauri discomfort knowing that he is not her biological father. When Bela is four, he runs into Holly (and Keith) again, but they merely exchange greetings. Subhash asks Gauri to have another child for Bela's sake but she is unsure. Gauri begins to attend graduate school when Bela is five and Subhash agrees to find time to watch Bela. Gauri meets professor Otto Weiss, who notices her talent and encourages her to pursue a doctorate, which she does. Gauri also becomes uneasy with keeping Bela in the dark regarding Udayan and when she expresses this to Subhash they agree that they will tell her one day together. Several times when it is Gauri's responsibility to looking after Bela, she neglects that obligation for some alone time. One day, when Subhash returns home early, he learns of this neglect and gives Gauri the silent treatment. Part V Subhash's father dies sometime while Subhash is in the states but Subhash is not able to visit Calcutta to pay his respects until Bela is seven. Subhash brings Bela and tells his mother in a letter not to reveal Udayan's connection to Bela during their stay. However, one day, while Bijoli is in a trance, she asks Bela where her father is before snapping out of it, almost revealing the truth. Bela sees pictures of Udayan and asks Subhash who it is. He responds that he is Udayan, her deceased uncle. During their final days in Calcutta, they go shopping for gifts for Bijoli and Gauri. When they return to Rhode Island, they learn that Gauri has left. She leaves a note in Bengali telling Subhash that he has been a fine father and that he should raise her alone and that she has left for California. As Bela comes of adolescent age, she begins to become more mentally unsound and needs the assistance of a psychologist. She recovers, and during high school, Bela becomes very active in club activities. For college, she attends a Midwest liberal arts school. After graduating, Bela lives a nomadic life, traveling around the United States advocating for conservation of the environment. Part VI After bouncing around all of California teaching, Gauri finds a stable job teaching at presumably one of the Claremont Colleges. Gauri contemplates reaching out to Subhash, Bela, and her friends but never does, living a mostly solitary life. After becoming a notable name in her field, she draws some attention and one day, UCLA graduate student Lorna asks Gauri for help with her dissertation. Gauri develops an ephemeral, lesbian relationship with Lorna, one that she clings to over the years. During his sixties, Subhash runs into Richard again. Subhash learns that Richard has continued his activism throughout his life and is a grandfather. Richard dies shortly afterward and through his funeral, Subhash meets Elise, one of Bela's teachers and they begin a relationship. Bela intermittently visits Subhash and Elise over the years. When she is in her mid-thirties, Bela reveals to Subhash that she is pregnant, but the father is unknown and she wishes to keep it that way. This sends Subhash into a frenzy. He is compelled to reveal Udayan's connection to her. When he does, Bela, upset and disgraced, walks out on him. After spending some time musing, she forgives Subhash and asks to live with him again in Rhode Island; he agrees. She gives birth shortly afterwards to a daughter she names Meghna. Part VII Gauri, in her later years, receives a visit from graduate student Dipankar who wishes to write a dissertation about the Naxalite movement and SDS and approaches her looking for a primary source (Gauri attended Presidency before moving to Rhode Island). She says that she will help him but does not want to be acknowledged. Gauri also learns of the recent death of Kanu Sanyal and she soberly remembers Udayan. Shortly afterwards, Subhash emails Gauri asking for a formal divorce, which she agrees is the best course of action. Bela meets Drew and they two become engaged after a short courtship. Meanwhile, Gauri visits Subhash's house and finds Bela and her daughter Meghna. Bela, full of enmity, courteously greets Gauri for Meghna's sake, but tells Meghna that Gauri is her great aunt. When Meghna is out of earshot Bela tells Gauri she can not forgive her. Bela tells Gauri she knows Udayan was her father but that gave Gauri no right to walk out on Subhash and her. Gauri leaves the divorce papers; Bela is glad that she was coincidentally able to spare her father the pain of seeing Gauri again. Gauri then takes a trip back to Kolkata, where, alone and in complete despair, she comes within a step of committing suicide. Later, after returning to California, Gauri receives a letter from Bela saying that Meghna asks about her, that Bela has decided she will tell Meghna the truth someday, and that perhaps at some point in the future, the three of them can try to meet again. Part VIII Subhash and Elise marry and go on their honeymoon to Kenmare. When he sees certain rock formations, he is reminded of Udayan. The final chapter revisits the day Udayan was killed. Udayan is no angel; he participates in murder. Despite this, he feels some regret, feeling that if he had met Gauri a little sooner, he could have saved himself from such a life. As he dies, he thinks fondly of Gauri. Reception In September 2013, The Lowland was placed on the shortlist for the 2013 Man Booker Prize, which ultimately went to The Luminaries by Eleanor Catton. The following month it was also long-listed for the National Book Award for Fiction, and revealed to be a finalist on 16 October 2013. In April 2014, it was shortlisted for the Baileys Women's Prize for Fiction. It won the DSC Prize for South Asian Literature (2014). Vogue stated Lahiri to be \\"at the height of her artistry\\" in a review for the book. The Oprah Magazine called the book \\"intriguing\\" while Chicago Tribune called her \\"A great American writer\\".

It was believed at one time that they were a subspecies of the African bush elephant, but this is no longer thought to be the case. Desert-dwelling elephants were once more widespread in Africa than they are now and are currently found only in Namibia and Mali. They tend to migrate from one waterhole to another following traditional routes which depend on the seasonal availability of food and water. They face pressure from poaching and from changes in land use by humans. Namibia The Kunene Region in the northwest of Namibia is an area of mostly sandy desert, rocky mountains and stony plains which covers about . Elephants have traditionally lived in this area and in the earlier part of the 20th century there were about 3,000 in the Kunene Region. By the 1980s these had greatly diminished in number, however since then, conservation measures have been put in place and by 2013 the number of elephants had increased to about 600. In 1995‚Äì1996 there were good rains in Namibia and the elephants expanded their range southwards to the Ugab River. The desert elephants were absent from the southern Kunene Region during the war for independence. They moved north for safety, returning to the Ugab River in the mid 1990s by which time many indigenous people had moved into the area following Namibia's independence. Many of these new residents had no experience of living with wild elephants. In the Hoanib River area male elephants have tusks, but about a third of the female elephants there are tuskless. Adult bull desert elephants are usually solitary and roam over large areas. One was recorded as travelling between the Skeleton Coast National Park and the Etosha National Park in a few months. Other bulls have occasionally moved into the area from better-watered regions to the east. The family groups in which most desert elephants move are small and usually consist of a female elephant and her offspring or two sisters and their dependent young. They tend to stay near the ephemeral rivers where there is greater availability of food. Some groups are resident in the Hoarusib River valley and a single group stays permanently near the Hoanib River while other groups move between the two, a distance of about . They usually make the trek in a single night, when the temperature is cooler than by day. At certain times of year they move inland along narrow traditional paths to mountain areas in search of myrrh bushes (Commiphora spp.) which seem to be a favourite foodstuff. Desert elephant (Loxodonta africana) male.jpgmale Desert elephant (Loxodonta africana) young female.jpgyoung female Desert elephant (Loxodonta africana) female head.jpgfemale head Desert elephant (Loxodonta africana) feet.jpgfeet Desert elephant (Loxodonta africana) tail.jpgtail Mali Rock art dating back to Neolithic times throughout the Sahara show that elephants were at that time widespread across much of North Africa. Nowadays they are restricted to the Gourma area, a remote region in Mali south of a loop made by the River Niger near Timbuktu. These elephants are the remnants of a number of groups which used to inhabit large areas of the Sahel as recently as 1970, before mostly being eliminated by poachers. The Malian population, which is believed to number about 400, makes a three hundred mile migratory journey each year, moving up to 35 miles a day. The elephants follow an anticlockwise route that takes them past temporary and permanent water holes. They remain in the northern parts of their range until the rains arrive in June. They then head southwards, moving briefly into northern Burkina Faso before moving northwards again. They are elusive and tend to seclude themselves among Acacia trees during the day, emerging to drink and feed at night. The WILD Foundation and Save the Elephants are conservation charities that have been working with the Malian Government to conserve these elephants. Some animals were fitted with GPS collars to track their movements and identify corridors through which they need to traverse to complete their journey, so that their routes could be avoided when new human settlements were established. The nomadic Touareg people who live in this region with their herds have been tolerant of the elephants. They are philosophical, stating that the elephants eat the topmost foliage of a tree, the camels browse the sides and the goats browse near the base. They know when the elephants will pass through their villages, visiting the ponds they also use for watering their herds. Nowadays, these people are living more settled lives and building huts, tending gardens, planting orchards and growing fodder grass at the water's edge of ponds. This means there is more competition between the elephants and the humans. A local initiative was set up in 1997, \\"Les Amis des Elephants\\", which aims to inform villagers of when the elephants are expected to arrive in their area. It also encourages them to act as guides and generate income from eco-tourism. During a prolonged drought in 1983, the Malian Government trucked in water for the elephants. The rains failed again in 2008 and the following year the adult elephants were digging down to access water deep below the surface but the youngsters could not reach the water with their trunks and were dying. The charities did what they could but the weakened state of the animals made it difficult to help them. Behaviour These elephants have developed certain adaptations for desert life and tend to have relatively broader feet, longer legs and smaller bodies than other African bush elephants. They are herbivorous, and their diet varies with the time of year. They may walk up to 70 kilometers at night to find water points, which is the cause of their bigger feet. In the wet season they prefer buds and fresh green leaves but in the dry season they subsist on drought-tolerant plants such as the camelthorn (Acacia erioloba), myrrh bushes, the mopane or turpentine tree (Colophospermum mopane) and the leaves and seedpods of the ana tree (Faidherbia albida). Adult bull elephants can eat about of fodder a day and drink about , but they can go without water for up to three days at a time. They use water, mud or dust for bathing or coating their skin.

While there, he provided information which contributed to Charles Darwin's first realisation that species might be changeable, and eventually to Darwin's theorising about evolution.Kvernberg, Anders. Mannen som visste s√• mye om skilpadder at han endret verdenshistorien. I: \\"√Örsskrift 2013\\". Romsdal sogelag. Molde, 2013. s. 260-286 Life and interaction with Darwin Nicolai Olaus Lossius was born on the island of Sekken in Romsdal, Norway. He was baptized in Ve√∏y Church outside Molde in Romsdal during late 1790. At 16, he went to sea where he sailed from England. As Nicholas Oliver Lawson, he took citizenship in the United States in 1811. He participated as a naval officer in the War of 1812 and later settled in Canada. By 1818, he had joined the Chilean Navy and fought in the Chilean War of Independence (1810‚Äì1821). In 1824, he married Rosario Asenjo (b. 1807) daughter of an officer in the Spanish Army. He operated as a ship builder, owner and trader. He was deputy governor of the Gal√°pagos Islands from approximately 1832 to 1837 and acting governor when Charles Darwin visited the islands in September 1835. By 1839, Lawson returned to his wife and children in Valpara√≠so, Chile where he died in 1851. Darwin named Lawson several times in his notes and diaries. When the Beagle survey expedition arrived at Charles Island (Floreana Island) in September 1835, Darwin noted in his diary: \\"An Englishman Mr Lawson is now acting as Governor. ‚Äî By chance he came down to visit a Whaling Vessel & in the morning accompanied us to the Settlement.\\" Lawson described having seen a reduction in the numbers and size of Gal√°pagos tortoises taken for meat by the whalers.Keynes, R. D. ed. 2001. Charles Darwin's Beagle Diary. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 354‚Äì357. In his zoological notes, Darwin recorded that \\"It is said that slight variations in the form of the shell are constant according to the Island which they inhabit ‚Äî also the average largest size appears equally to vary according to the locality.‚Äî Mr Lawson states he can on seeing a Tortoise pronounce with certainty from which island it has been brought.\\" This was one of the points which Darwin listed later in the voyage, between mid-June and August 1836, as arousing his first suspicion that \\"such facts would undermine the stability of Species\\". After the voyage, Darwin developed this idea during his investigations into transmutation of species, resulting in his theory of evolution.Keynes, Richard ed. 2000.

Mallonee Middle School, is a historic former school campus located at 1201 City Point Road in Hopewell, Virginia, United States. Contributing properties in the complex include the original school building, athletic field, club house, concession stand, press box, Home Economics Cottage, gymnasium and Science and Library Building. There are two non-contributing structures on the property. Built in 1925, the Tudor Revival style school building served white high school students of Hopewell until 1967 when a new racially integrated facility was built and the former high school was converted into a middle school. The building was abandoned in 1988 after students were moved to another location. The athletic field, a project of the Works Progress Administration, is still used by Hopewell High School teams and the local school board offices are housed in the Home Economics Cottage and Science and Library Building. The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and Virginia Landmarks Register in 2009. The following year, renovation of the school building into loft-style apartments was completed. The building is now known as the Hopewell Lofts. History=School usage Following a devastating fire in 1915 that destroyed much of Hopewell, local citizens rebuilt the town and the local school system established a high school department. There were reportedly 21 students and 4 teachers the first year. During the next few years, classes were held in various locations including an old school building and a local YMCA facility on 3 ¬Ω Avenue. Hopewell High School was formally established in 1921 and served only white students. There were only 11 graduating students in 1922, but the number of enrolled pupils soon increased when Hopewell, City Point, and surrounding villages were annexed and combined into an independent city, Hopewell. An influx of people working at local industrial plants resulted in a sharp increase in the population during the 1920s and plans were made for a new school facility. During the Progressive Era, schools were envisioned as being centers of the community. Virginia State Board of Education officials also sought to replace smaller school buildings with larger, architecturally significant facilities. Hopewell was \\"developed with the intention of being a comprehensive school with courses as varied as the demand and facilities would permit.\\" Construction began on the new high school building in 1924. Frederick A. Bishop, a prolific architect and contractor from nearby Richmond, was selected to design the school. His other designs include schools, banks and theaters in the Richmond-Petersburg- Hopewell area and Tidewater region. Bishop's best known work is the Byrd Theatre in Richmond and his other designs in Hopewell include Hopewell City Hall and the Beacon Theatre. Both school names are above the entrance. The high school building, which could accommodate 725 students, was completed in the fall of 1925 and following the Thanksgiving holiday, pupils were moved to the new facility. There were 10 teachers for the 281 grades 8-11 students. Because of the school's extra space, over 300 grades 5-7 students were transferred to the new facility. The students in the lower grades were later transferred to other schools when high school enrollment increased in the 1930s. That decade also saw the expansion of the school complex. A small cottage, located across 12th Avenue, was built for home economics courses. Construction of the athletic field and club house was a project of the Works Progress Administration. In the 1940s, a gymnasium was built beside the cottage and a metal and woodworking shop was added to the rear of the school building. Both projects were designed by Richmond architects and engineers Carneal & Johnson. The firm, along with Richmond architect J. Henley Walker Jr., designed the Science and Library Building, located across 12th Avenue and completed in 1959. In 1967, construction of a new racially integrated high school at 400 South Mesa Drive was completed and Hopewell High School became the James E. Mallonee Middle School, named in honor of the high school's principal from 1923 until the 1940s. The complex continued to serve as a middle school until 1988 when students were transferred to another facility. Mallonee School was then used as storage space for the Hopewell school system. The city purchased the building from the School Board in 2001 and planned to use it as government office space, but the plans were deemed infeasible. Restoration Hopewell Lofts first floor hallway The school building sat vacant until January 2008 when Hopewell city officials approved plans by Garcia Development, LLC to convert it into 50 loft-style apartments. The co- developer of the project was David McCormack, president of Waukeshaw Development, Inc. The renovation was delayed by 16 months due to the 2008 economic downturn, a fire in April 2008 which damaged the property, and the developers waiting for historic tax credit approval. During this time the school complex was added to the Virginia Landmarks Register on June 18, 2009, and the National Register of Historic Places on September 16, 2009. It was described as a \\"representative and intact example of an early 20th-century urban school complex\\" that \\"retains the integrity of its historic location, association, setting, feeling, design, materials, and workmanship.\\" The $8 million project, named the Hopewell Lofts, was completed in May 2010. The renovation was designed by McEntire Davis Architects and the contractor was Haase, Inc. Many of the 1, 2, and 3 bedroom apartments feature original details such as chalkboards and large windows. Residents living in rear units face the athletic field and can watch football games. The hallways feature the original butterscotch tiles, terrazzo floors and marble staircase. The central auditorium is a public area that can be rented and the back stage has been turned into apartments. The Home Economics Cottage and the Science and Library Building now serve as offices for the Hopewell School Board. The athletic field continues to be used for the Hopewell High School Blue Devils home football games. The Boys & Girls Club used the gymnasium until 2013 when the after-school program was moved to the Harry E. James Elementary School. The gymnasium began serving as a cold weather shelter for the homeless during the 2014‚Äì2015 winter season. In 2016, former NFL players Wali Rainer and Hopewell High School graduate Monsanto Pope joined other professional athletes in urging Hopewell government officials to renovate the gymnasium to reuse as a teen center focusing on tutoring and sports. Layout and design Complex diagram The Hopewell High School Complex is located on the north side of City Point Road near Hopewell's commercial center. The boundaries of the complex include West Broadway Avenue to the north, North 14th Avenue to the east, West City Point Road to the south and North 11th Avenue to the east. North 12th Avenue divides the complex and the main school building features a circular driveway off of City Point Road. The complex includes eight contributing properties and two non-contributing. The contributing properties, built between 1925 and 1959, include the original school building, athletic field, club house, concession stand, press box, Home Economics Cottage, gymnasium and Science and Library Building. The two non-contributing properties are late 20th-century storage sheds on the west side of the athletic field.

There are two modern doors on the west side of the building and a metal door on the southeast corner. The building originally featured a metal shop, woodworking shop, finishing room, tool and supply rooms, an office and wash room. William L. Merner Athletic Field The athletic field, built in the 1930s as a Works Progress Administration project, is sited on the north side of the complex directly behind the main school building. In 1965, the field was renamed in honor of William \\"Bill\\" Merner (1915‚Äì1965), a Hopewell High School graduate and Blue Devils football player who later returned to the school and coached the football team from 1949‚Äì1958. The field features two goal posts, a metal scoreboard and concrete track and sidewalks. Concrete bleachers, believed to be built in the late 1930s, are on the east side of the field and modern, metal bleachers are on the west side. A concrete wall built in the late 1930s surrounds the perimeter of the field. It features capped pilasters approximately every six feet. A parking area is sited just north of the field. Club house The club house, built in 1936, is located near the athletic field's southeast corner. It is a one-story concrete building with a flat roof that features identical capped pilasters found on the concrete wall surrounding the athletic field. There are six boarded up, square windows and three doors. The only accessible door is on the building's west side. The interior of the building is made up of small rooms that connect to a larger one. Concession stand The concession stand, built sometime between 1936 and 1959, is located just west of the club house. The concrete building features a bump-out with three windows and sliding metal shades. Men's and women's restrooms are located in this building. Press box The press box, built sometime between 1936 and 1959, is located at the top of the athletic field's concrete bleachers. It features many of the same elements as the concession stand. It is made of concrete and has five window openings with sliding metal shades. There is one door that is connected to the bleachers by metal stairs. The metal roof extends over this doorway and the window openings to provide a canopy. Home Economics Cottage The cottage, built in the late 1930s, is a -story Colonial Revival brick building featuring a pair of brick chimneys. It is located across North 12th Avenue, east of the athletic field and beside the gymnasium. Windows on the first floor, which are covered with metal bars, and the three gabled dormers are 6/9 wood sash windows. Others throughout the building are 6/6 sash windows. There is a four-light transom above the solid wood front door. The interior features many of the cottage's original details including mantels, woodwork and built-in cabinets. There is an arched opening between the former dining and living rooms. A large room, which features the same design and materials as the original portion and is located at the rear of the building, is believed to be a later addition to the cottage. Gymnasium Gymnasium and Home Economics Cottage (far left) The two-story, Colonial Revival gymnasium was built in 1949 and features a cornerstone on the northwest corner inscribed with the year construction was completed. It is located at 111 North 12th Avenue, east of the club house and beside the Home Economics Cottage. The nine-bay brick building features quoining, decorative pilasters and a pedimented stone cap.

A boiler room is in the rear portion of the building. The building features wood floors in the gymnasium and concrete floors elsewhere. In addition to the two-story gymnasium, the original layout included classrooms, a band room, boys and girls locker rooms and storage space. Science and Library Building The two-story, International Style Science and Library Building, which includes a full basement, was built in 1959. It is located at 103 North 12th Avenue, east of the main school building and south of the gymnasium. The projecting one-story entrance, featuring four-bay store front windows with transoms and a pair of full light doors with transoms, is covered by a flat aluminum roof. \\"Hopewell School Board Office\\" is lettered above the entrance. There are aluminum frame sliding glass windows on the north and south sides of the building. The exterior walls on these sides are clad with EIFS (exterior insulation finishing system) which was added in the 1990s after a storm damaged the building. An aluminum canopy covers the entrance on North 11th Avenue. The original layout of the basement featured offices, testing rooms, work rooms, a board room, an elementary education room, an employee lounge, restrooms, the janitor closet and a boiler room. Classrooms, a faculty lounge, a library and A.V. room, restrooms and storage space were on the first floor.

The proband has to discriminate continually between geometric target and nontarget items as accurately and quickly as possible. Both, target items as well as non-target items require a specific reaction button. Thus a directed attention is required for all items. The first edition of the test was introduced in 1997 by Moosbrugger and Heyden, the second edition 2005 by Moosbrugger and Goldhammer, each at Goethe University Frankfurt.

Test Versions  There are three versions of the test: * FACT-I: only one item is displayed on the screen, immediate discrimination, adaptability of the rate (high stress) * FACT-S : simultaneously 10 items in a row, discrimination from left to right one by one, adaptability of the rate (average stress) * FACT-SR: simultaneously 10 items in a row, discrimination from left to right one by one, no adaptivity of the rate, response times for the discrimination are measured (low stress) The adaptivity of the rate means that the duration, how long the screen content with one or more items are displayed, is varied by an algorithm until it matches the individual capacity of the test subject. The rate is the higher, the better the power of concentration.  Test Duration  For each test version different durations can be selected: * Adaptive duration: the test ends as soon as the measurement reaches an accuracy criterion (at least 2 minutes at most 6 minutes) * Fixed duration: 6 minutes (standard test time), 12, 18, 24 or 30 minutes can be selected  Evaluation  The test examines the extent to which the subject is able to focus its attention over a long period of time to certain stimuli or activities. These are continuous selection, coordination and control of action patterns using voluntary effort. The FACT-2 covers the following aspects: * Power of concentration (work rate) * Accuracy of concentration (relative correctness) * Homogeneity of concentration (uniformity of work rate) The results are calculated for the adaptive test time and for any 6-minute section. Standard values are available for the interpretation.  References  * Helfried Moosbrugger & Frank Goldhammer: FACT-2. Frankfurt Adaptive Concentration Test. English Version of FAKT-II.

It featured a relatively short wingspan (ten meters). One example was built in the early 1950s. Development The Ghoppia was a cantilever mid- wing monoplane. Its straight tapered wing was built in one piece for lightness around a single spar and had marked dihedral. The outer half of the wing's trailing edge carried ailerons mounted on a false spar; trailing edge airbrakes occupied the inner portion of the wingspan. These airbrakes turned out to be rather ineffective. The wing terminated in small tip bodies. The fuselage was built in two sections that bolted together. It was ovoid in cross-section, tapering aft to a conventional but integral tail. The fin was straight edged with a rounded tip and a small fillet at its base. Its rudder extended down to the keel. The tailplane was mounted on the fin near the top of the fillet, carrying elevators that had a large cut-out for rudder movement. The Ghoppia's cockpit was over the wing, under a rather prominent canopy which opened by sliding rearwards. This had perspex transparencies forwards and to the sides but was opaque rearwards and above. A skid, reaching aft to about mid-chord, and a tail bumper formed the undercarriage. Partly due to the single-piece wing, the Ghoppia was unusually light with an empty weight of only . Operational history The Ghoppia was first flown from Bresso, then later from Linate, sometimes launched by aerotow.

It was established on Monday 8 September 2014 following the windup of the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which had been the main industry regulator of the press in the United Kingdom since 1990. IPSO exists to promote and uphold the highest professional standards of journalism, and to support members of the public in seeking redress where they believe that the Editors' Code of PracticeEditors' Code of Practice has been breached. The Editors' Code deals with issues such as accuracy, invasion of privacy, intrusion into grief or shock and harassment. IPSO considers concerns about editorial content in newspapers and magazines, and about the conduct of journalists. IPSO handles complaints and conducts its own investigations into editorial standards and compliance. It also undertakes monitoring work, including by requiring publications to submit annual compliance reports. IPSO has the power, where necessary, to require the publication of prominent corrections and critical adjudications, and may ultimately fine publications in cases where failings are particularly serious and systemic. Report of the Leveson Inquiry The Leveson Inquiry reported in November 2012, recommending the establishment of a new independent body. The PCC had received extensive criticism for its lack of action in the News International phone hacking scandal, including from MPs and Prime Minister David Cameron, who called for it to be replaced with a new system in July 2011. The Leveson Inquiry concluded that a legal framework was necessary to give a new regulatory body powers of enforcement such as exemplary damages and suggested the possibility of a Royal Charter to provide this. This route was accepted by David Cameron and, following extensive political discussion, a Royal Charter on self-regulation of the press was granted by the Privy Council in October 2013, despite legal challenges by newspaper publishers (Pressbof) to prevent it. The publishers characterised the Charter as \\"deeply illiberal\\" and presented their own alternative proposals, which the High Court did not accept as they did not comply with the principles set out in the Leveson report, including independence and access to arbitration. The industry therefore continued with its own proposals, despite fears that industry representatives would still have powers of veto over the chairman and other board members. The Media Standards Trust also published a critique analysing in detail where the proposals met and fell short of Leveson's recommendations. One of the government's commitments in implementing the Inquiry's recommendations related to the idea that, while the industry should regulate itself, there should be some independent verification (or \\"recognition\\") of the regulatory arrangements the press put in place. The Press Recognition Panel was created on 3 November 2014 as a fully independent body with the purpose of carrying out activities in relation to the recognition of press regulators. IPSO has said that it will not seek approval from the Press Recognition Panel (PRP), which has officially recognised the regulator IMPRESS.. The Hacked Off campaign has described IPSO as a \\"sham\\" and \\"the illusion of reform\\".  Membership  Several of the broadsheet newspapers, including the Financial Times, The Independent and The Guardian, have declined to take part in IPSO. The Financial Times and The Guardian have established their own independent complaints systems instead. IPSO regulates more than 1,500 print titles and more than 1,100 online titles, including most of the UK's national newspapers.  Funding  IPSO is a self regulator paid for by its member publishers though the Regulatory Funding Company.

At the age of 18 he became the South Pacific heavyweight champion and in 1956 he unsuccessfully challenged Joe Bygraves for the vacant Commonwealth title. A heavy hitting fighter, with the vast majority of his victories ending in knockouts, he was known as The Tongan Torpedo. After retiring from boxing he had a brief career as a professional wrestler. Personal history Lave was born in the village of Hunga in Tonga in 1934. In 1953 he travelled to New Zealand and set himself up in Auckland. As well as fighting professionally, Lave also found work as a gardener at the Auckland residence of Queen SƒÅlote Tupou III. In 1955 his boxing took him to Great Britain, where he met school teacher Patricia Gee. The two were married in 1957 and they had one daughter, also Patricia. While in Britain Lave joined the Royal Air Force, and served for sometime in Singapore. After retiring from boxing, whilst in Britain and Singapore, he took up professional wrestling. Once he had completed his time with the RAF, Lave became a successful nightclub owner running an establishment in Sheffield. He and Patricia moved to New Zealand in 1971 where he attempted to run a casino, but with little success. Lave died after a long illness at a rest home in Beach Haven in 2006. Boxing career=Early career Kitione Lave began his boxing career as a teenager on the island of Vava'u, Tonga. His first recorded fight took place on Vava'u where, at the age of 16, he won a three round fight on points. By February 1952 Lave had seven fights under his belt, having lost only one. He then moved to Fiji, where in August 1952 he beat Semi Galoa with a last round knockout. After two more successful bouts, Lave was matched against Fijian Miliano for the South Pacific heavyweight title. The contest took place on 7 March 1953 in the town of Ba and was scheduled for 12 rounds. Lave knocked out his opponent in the fifth round to take his first belt. He defended this title on 13 April 1953 in Fiji through another knockout victory in the second round against Inoke Davu. In June 1953 Lave travelled to New Zealand on the steamship Tofua. Within a month he was boxing at the Town Hall in Auckland and quickly became a regular fighter at the venue. Described as a \\"boxing promoter's dream drawcard\\", Lave was young, good looking and was able to knockout opponents with either hand, and in his first three months in Auckland he fought six times, winning all of them within the distance. The last of these six fights was against Don Mullett, the New Zealand heavyweight champion, who he stopped in the seventh round through a cut eye. This string of wins brought Lave to the public's attention and he was summoned to meet with Queen SƒÅlote, who wished to advise him on his role as a cultural ambassador for Tonga. Three months later a rematch was arranged between Lave and Mullett and the two men met at the Race Course in Stratford. This time the match lasted until the tenth, when Lave knocked out his opponent. A month later, Lave was matched with experienced English fighter Ken Brady, who had also beaten Mullett earlier in the year. The contest, held at the Western Springs Stadium, would turn out to be Lave's first defeat in New Zealand, with Brady taking the fight on points after the fight went the full distance. Despite the defeat, Lave's career continued to flourish and he let New Zealand for Australia. Lave continued to be matched against top opponents, and his very next fight was against Australian Allen Williams, the New South Wales State Heavyweight Champion. Held at Leichhardt Stadium in Sydney, Williams entered the fight on a nine match unbeaten run. Lave failed to be overwhelmed by his opponent and stopped the future Australian champion in the eighth round. After stopping an inexperienced Paul Butler in April he was rematched with Williams. Williams fared no better the second time around, being knocked out again in the eighth round. In September 1954 Lave travelled to Melbourne to face Brady for a second time. Again the Englishman had the advantage and Lave was knocked out for the first time in his career. A second rematch was quickly arranged and two days before Christmas Lave and Brady travelled to New Zealand to fight at Carlaw Park in Auckland. Lave finally managed to get his revenge, knocking Brady out in the final round of a twelve round contest. Lave was back in Australia at the start of 1955, and in January he beat Ross Jenkins in Sydney following this with a win over Steve Zoranich in Perth. Then in April he was again lined up to fight Allen Williams. The contest, held at Broken Hill Stadium went the distance, with Lave taking the decision. Move to Britain While in New Zealand Lave had made contact with former British boxer Bruce Woodcock, who suggested that Lave come to Britain. In 1955 Lave travelled to England to continue his career, under the management of Woodcock, where he was dubbed The Tongan Terror. He was given a baptism of fire when his first opponent being Commonwealth Heavyweight champion Johnny Williams. It was an inauspicious start to his European career as Lave was stopped via a technical knockout in the first round. Lave followed this fight with a contest against up and coming title challenger from Tyne and Wear, Manuel Burgo. Despite an unbeaten career of eight fights, Burgo was stopped after just 71 seconds of the first round against the heavy hitting Tongan. Three weeks later Lave beat Eddie Hearn, before resting for seven days to travel to Birmingham to face the dangerous Jamaican Joe Bygraves. Lave started the fight well, but Bygraves slowly took control of the fight and took the points decision after the eight round contest came to an end. He followed the defeat with a victory over Fred \\"Nosher\\" Powell in Lave's first match in London. He ended the year in defeat, this time to former European Boxing champion Jack Gardner. The result was met with derision by the British Press, as Lave not only put Gardner down for the first time in his career, but also did enough throughout the match to take the decision. Lave began 1956 in better form, winning three consecutive fights. Travelling to Newcastle, he stopped undefeated German Hans Brendemuehl in the second, former and future Italian heavyweight champion Uber Bacilieri in the fourth before scoring a second round victory over ex-Commonwealth and European champion Don Cockell. Cockell retired after his contest with Lave, having just a year earlier faced Rocky Marciano for the World Heavyweight title. Lave's successes led to a title challenge for the vacant Commonwealth heavyweight title. His opponent was Joe Bygraves, who had defeated Lave in 1955. The two met on the 26 June 1956 at the Empire Pool in Wembley, and again the fight went the full distance, with the result going the same way, to Bygraves. Lave ended the year with a win over American Young Harry Wills at the ice rink in Nottingham, before travelling to Germany to knockout Guenter Nurnberg in the first round in an encounter in Berlin. Lave fought infrequently in 1957, with just three matches, all of them ending in defeat. The first of the loses was against Brian London in an eliminator contest for another shot at the Commonwealth title. This was followed by a third defeat to Bygraves, yet another points decision, and finally a loss against German heavyweight title challenger Hans Friedrich. Career end Lave left Britain in 1958 and returned to the Southern hemisphere. He fought just once that year, losing to American Mormon missionary, Chuck Woodworth at Carlaw Park in Auckland. In 1959 he travelled to Fiji, where he fought seven bouts within two months. He won six of them through knockouts, but he lost his South Seas Heavyweight title to Mosese Varasikete after suffering a technical knockout in the first round. In May he was back in Tonga, there he fought five times against local opponents, winning all within distance. He then returned to Fiji, where on 25 August he regained his South Seas belt by defeating Mosese Varasikete in a first round knockout display. He fought twice in September, both third round stoppages, before heading to French Polynesia where he dispatched Sakiusa Cawaru in the final round of a ten round contest. In October he was back in Fiji, facing Varasikete in a third challenge for the South Seas Heavyweight title. the belt changed hands again with Varasikete taking the referee's decision after the match went the full twelve rounds. Lave ended the year back in Europe, facing the European champion Franco Cavicchi in Bologna, Italy. Lave took Cavicchi the distance but again lost on points. In 1960, Lave was back in Great Britain, but his best was behind him. His first fight back in England ended in controversy after the referee stopped the match against Joey Armstrong in the fifth, declaring neither boxer was 'giving their best'. Just a week later Lave was back in the ring, stopping Jim Cooper, the twin brother of heavyweight champion Henry Cooper, in the sixth. In March he returned to Bologna where he achieved a rare points decision over Federico Friso. He ended 1960 with a win over former ABA champion Dave Rent, before losing to both Ulli Nitzschke in Germany and Tony Smith back in England. In 1961 he fought just once, in an ill-advised trip to America, where he fought World title challenger Tom McNeeley. McNeeley stopped Lave in the third. Lave fought only twice more, both in 1963 when he was stationed in Singapore with the RAF. He won both fights, against Australian Tony Vickers and Fijian heavyweight champion Isimeli Radrodro. In 2007, a year after his death, Lave was inducted at the inaugural Tongan Sporting Hall of Fame. Wrestling career With his boxing career behind him, Lave found employment in professional wrestling. He wrestled in Sheffield where he owned his night club, and while in Singapore he was managed by Emile Czaja, fighting alongside the likes of Prince Kumali.

Nijnsel is a parish of the municipality of Sint-Oedenrode and has around 2,600 inhabitants. Etymology The word Nijnsel means reliving. The name of the nearby hamlet Vressel means Old residence. \\"Sel\\" being derived from the word \\"sale\\", which refers to the largest house in the area which belonged to the local nobleman in the early medieval period.http://www.etymologiebank.nl/trefwoord/zaalhttp://cultuurtijdschriften.nl/download?type=document&docid;=460463  History  Source: The hamlets Nijnsel and Vressel on either side of the Dommel river are known to be habituated in prehistoric times. There are archaeological remains of the Bell Beaker culture and also remains of the Roman era were found. There are numerous archaeological monuments which also remain from the Mesolithic era.http://natuurcultuur.nl/download?type=document&docid;=460463 A settlement from the early Bronze Age, around 1500 BC was excavated in Nijnsel. thumbA map of the excavation of a settlement from the early Bronze Age, around 1500 BC Just north of the fen De Hazenputten in the Vresselse Bossen in Nijnsel. The main building within the excavated portion is a farm of 17 meters by 6 meters. The outer wall consisted of poles that were connected with braid and were covered with clay. The posts within the farm will have borne the roof. A series of heavy poles on the south side of the farm probably supported a far extended roof on that side that was necessary in view of the down pouring rain that could wash away the clay there. In the long walls of the farmhouse opposite to each other there are two wide entrances forming a corridor which divided the building into a living area and a shed or barn. Around the farm there were numerous outbuildings. The most notable was a circular building that was probably a sheepfold. The other buildings are square or rectangular sheds and called \\"Spiekers\\": constructions of four or six poles with a raised floor for the storage of grain and hay. Northwest of the main building was a large barn of 7 by 3.5 meters. The many other posts will have served a variety of small buildings that belong to a farm like racks, an apiary, doghouse etc. The dark spots on the map were pits which were probably used for manure or the storing of winter silage. Nijnsel originated as a settlement around a chapel which was dedicated to Anthony the Great and was already mentioned in the 15th century. The village traditionally belonged to the ancient vrijheerlijkheid of Sint-Oedenrode and was just as nearby Vressel a hamlet. After the Peace of M√ºnster in 1648, the chapel was closed. The Catholic population used now a clandestine church in a barn in Sint-Oedenrode, while the empty chapel was used as a Protestant school since 1731, after the hamlets Nijnsel and Vressel sent a petition to establish their own school in 1728 to the Council of State of the Netherlands in The Hague. In 1892 the chapel was demolished. The village Nijnsel includes the possible remains of castle Ten Houte, which is founded in the 15th century and demolished in the 19th century. These remains are located between the Houtsestraat and the Hoogstraat. Nijnsel continued into the twentieth century as a small linear settlement on the old road between Sint-Oedenrode and Lieshout. Later on the development of the village was further determined by both the construction of the Catholic Church, and by the proximity to the Veghelseweg - Sonseweg (Road to Veghel and to Son). The \\"Sint Antonius van Padua\\" Church was inaugurated in 1911 and around the church formed a village. The largest change over the last decades was the arrival of a new neighborhood in the 60s-80s and an industrial area in 1970. Initially, only small-scale and 'clean' companies were admitted at the industrial area. Nijnsel was notorious for the Provincial Road N265 which for years separated the village from the nearby Sint-Oedenrode. Since the opening of the State Highway A50 in 2003, the traffic nuisance has diminished, as the A50 since then passes through a tunnel next to the village. The construction of this highway was accompanied by an expansion of the business area. Sights * The Saint Anthony of Padua Church is a rustic brick church which was consecrated in 1911 and designed by the architect Louis Kooken from Eindhoven. The choice of Anthony of Padua as the patron saint of the church arose from the fact that the construction pastor, Johannes Panken, was born on the feast day of this saint. The same priest organized an annual pilgrimage, which was called the Meierijsche Pilgrimage in which thousands of people participated. This pilgrimage began to languish after 1960 and is now long gone. However, an open-air mass is held every year in honor of Anthony of Padua, using a stone niche with canopy in a small park to the rear of the church and the cemetery. This is sometimes called the \\"green cathedral\\". Next to the church is a Sacred Heart statue. * Some characteristic old hall houses in traditional Brabantian style can be found at the provincial road (Lieshoutseweg) to Mariahout and along the Vresselseweg. Nature and landscape East and north of Nijnsel runs the river the Dommel through the Dommel valley. On both sides of it there are some old fields. Further west is a heath reclamation: the Rooise Heath. East of the Dommel more nature can be found: * The Vresselse Bossen (The Vressel's Forests). This area consists of a sand ridge with pine and deciduous forest and covers around . It was once a production forest with Scots pine for the Limburgian mines and was built on a drift-sand ridge to stop the sand being blown onto the farmlands, but has become gradually more varied. The forest contains some important fen complexes, of which the Hazenputten is the most important. There are also areas with wet heaths. The area is managed by the National Forestry Service (Staatsbosbeheer). The \\"Hazenputten\\" was nominated by Staatsbosbeheer for the title of \\"Most beautiful spot\\" in the Netherlands in 2013. There are several hiking trails in this forest, including the famous ‚Äúgeerzingel‚Äù path. * The Moerkuilen. This is an area of pools created by the dredging of Moer, which is quagmire consisting of decayed plant material that could be used as Peat (fuel) after drying. A carr borders these pools. There are hiking trails. * The Dommelbeemden. This divers area is designated as a natural monument in 1977. There are wet meadows in which rare plants such as Marsh Lousewort can be found. There is a hiking path and a watchtower has been built. These three nature areas are located close together and between them some ancient infield can be found, such as small-scale fields. Together these areas form a part of \\"Het Groene Woud\\". * Het Groene Woud. Het Groene Woud (The Green Forest) covers a total of of marshes, meadows and agricultural landscape between Den Bosch, Eindhoven and Tilburg. The most original part and natural state of the Dommel can be found between Eindhoven and Boxtel and hence in Nijnsel. Here the Dommel has still its original winds and meanders and forms a cultural-historical and valuable landscape area. Hiking, canoeing and cycling activities are possible in this area.

Palmer is an associate professor of family and community medicine at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UTHSCSA), a post he has held since 2003.

In one study, Palmer et al. correlated Environmental Protection Agency data about the release of mercury in 254 Texas counties with special education cases and autism diagnoses in the state's 1,200 school districts. At a press conference, Palmer stated that \\"This is not a definitive study, but just one more that furthers the association between environmental mercury and autism.\\" Thomas Lewandowski stated in a viewpoint that \\"... the conclusions drawn from the analysis are questionable\\", and Palmer told WebMD that this type of study is not necessarily proof of a causative link between mercury and autism. Palmer has studied baby teeth for environmental toxins the children could have been exposed to during the prenatal period; this research was funded by a Suzanne and Bob Wright Trailblazer grant from Autism Speaks. He has also studied the differences in autism rates between Hispanic children and white children, and has concluded that the former are less likely to be diagnosed with the disorder than the latter. He says that this difference is unlikely to be solely an artifact of socioeconomic factors. Education Palmer has a bachelor's degree in psychology from Long Beach State University (1980), as well as an M.A. in psychology from California State University, Dominguez Hills (1985) and a PhD in preventive medicine from the University of Southern California (1995).

In 2013 she won two of her five races in Europe, establishing herself as one of the leading British-trained fillies of her generation by winning the Fillies' Mile. She was then sent to the United States in November where she recorded a decisive win in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies Turf. She was awarded the title of Cartier Champion Two-year- old Filly and was officially rated the best two-year-old filly in Europe. She died in February 2014 after contracting a bacterial infection. Background Chriselliam was a bay filly with a white star and a white sock on her left hind leg bred by the Ballylinch Stud of County Kilkenny. She was one of the best horses sired by Iffraaj, a high-class sprinter whose wins included the Wokingham Stakes, Lennox Stakes and Park Stakes (twice). Chriselliam's dam Danielli failed to win a race but was a half-sister of the Moyglare Stud Stakes winner Priory Belle. In 2012, Chriselliam was sent to the Tattersalls October Yearling Sale and was bought for 40,000 guineas by the bloodstock agent SackvilleDonald. The filly became the property of a partnership of Willie Carson, Emily Asprey and Christopher Wright and was sent into training with Charles Hills at Lambourn. Racing career=2013: two-year-old season Chriselliam made no impact on her racecourse debut, finishing ninth of fourteen runners in a six furlong maiden race at Haydock Park in May. She reappeared in July for a seven furlong maiden race at Warwick Racecourse, and recorded her first success, winning by two and a half lengths at odds of 5/1. A month later the filly was sent to France and moved up sharply in class for the Group Three Prix du Calvados at Deauville Racecourse. Ridden by Olivier Peslier, she briefly challenged the leaders but faded in the closing stages to finish ninth of the eleven finishers behind Sandiva. In September Chriselliam was moved up in distance to one mile and matched against colts in the Ascendant Stakes at Haydock. Ridden by Gerald Mosse, she took the lead in the straight but was overtaken in the final strides and beaten a neck by the Richard Hannon Sr.-trained colt Chief Barker. Three weeks after her narrow defeat at Haydock, Chriselliam was one of eight fillies to contest the Group One Fillies' Mile at Newmarket Racecourse. The Moyglare Stud Stakes winner Rizeena was made the 7/4 favourite, while Chriselliam, ridden for the first time by Richard Hughes started a 28/1 outsider. Hughes restrained the filly at the back of the field before switching left to make a challenge a furlong from the finish. She produced a strong late run to overtake Rizeena 75 yards from the finish and won by a length. Hughes described the winner as \\"the ideal Guineas candidate. She moves good and travels well and she has just shown she has a very good turn of foot\\". On her final appearance of the season, Chriselliam was sent to California to contest the Grade I Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies Turf over one mile at Santa Anita Park. She was the 6.9/1 fourth choice in the betting behind Vorda (winner of the Cheveley Park Stakes), My Conquestadory (Alcibiades Stakes) and Al Thakhira (Rockfel Stakes). She started slowly, but made steady progress and turned into the straight just behind the leaders. A furlong from the finish she overtook My Conquestadory and accelerated clear to win by two and a half lengths from Testa Rossi. After the race Hills said of Chriselliam: \\"She's exceptional ‚Äì she's got everything you want, really. She travels very well. She's so professional, you can put her anywhere you want in a race. She also has a very good turn of foot\\". In November, Chriselliam was voted Champion Two-year-old Filly at the Cartier Racing Awards. In the official ratings published in January 2014, Chriselliam was rated the best European two-year-old filly of 2013. Death On 16 January 2014 it was announced that Chriselliam was suffering from a \\"poisoned foot\\", but that the infection was \\"under control\\". In early February, she was transferred to the Newmarket Equine Hospital where it was found that the infection had spread to the pedal bone and was untreatable. Chriselliam was euthanised on 7 February. Hills described her as \\"hugely talented, with a wonderful temperament\\". Pedigree Chriselliam is inbred 4 x 4 to Northern Dancer. This means that the stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of her pedigree.

Universal Music New Zealand's corporate headquarters are located in Auckland, New Zealand. Universal Music New Zealand represents all of UMG's international labels within New Zealand and signs, markets, and distributes New Zealand artists and labels within New Zealand and around the world. Company history in New Zealand Universal Music New Zealand's history goes back to 10 May 1926 when His Master's Voice (NZ) Limited was incorporated as a subsidiary of the UK's The Gramophone Co. Ltd. with E J Hyams as its Managing Director and largest shareholder. In 1931, on Hyams' retirement, The Gramophone Co. Ltd. purchased the balance of the shares and appointed Alfred Wyness as the new Managing Director. In 1948 Wyness arranged for a record pressing plant to be imported from England. Over the next three decades, the company dominated the New Zealand music industry selling records, tapes, whiteware, electronics and more, with factories in Masterton and Wellington, where it owned a record pressing plant until 1987. His Master's Voice (NZ) Ltd. was renamed EMI (New Zealand) Ltd. in 1972. The Dutch company Philips introduced a record division into the New Zealand market in 1951 but it wasn't until the mid to late 1960s that the Philips label began to eat into HMV's market dominance. In the 1970s, Philips Records division was renamed Phonogram Ltd. and then PolyGram Records Ltd In 1951 the UK company Pye Ltd. created Pye (N.Z.) Ltd and purchased the Paeroa based interests of Akrad Radio Corporation Ltd. headed by George Wooller which included G.A. Woolller & Co. Ltd. under which it established a record division. By the turn of the 1960s, this was the second-largest record company in New Zealand. In 1961 Wooller acquired Allied International Records, and, then, in 1964 the Radio Corporation Of NZ. This succession of acquisitions brought the catalogues of Prestige Records, TANZA, and Allied International into the company In 1966, Pye UK was purchased by Philips but Pye/Allied retained autonomy in New Zealand until 1976 when it was folded into PolyGram. Universal in New Zealand Universal Records opened a New Zealand office, as MCA Records, in Auckland in 1996, and in January 1999 took over the operations of PolyGram New Zealand as part of the global merging of the two companies with George Ash as the first Managing Director of the larger company. He was succeeded in 2001 by Adam Holt who currently heads the company. Following the 2012 takeover of EMI by Universal worldwide and regulatory approval in NZ, EMI New Zealand was absorbed into Universal Music New Zealand in September of that year, thus bringing much of New Zealand's recorded past including TANZA, EMI, HMV, PolyGram/Phonogram/Philips, Pye, Prestige, Allied International and other labels under one ownership umbrella. Since 2000, Universal Music New Zealand successfully launched the careers of, amongst others, Lorde, Sole Mio, Gin Wigmore, Hayley Westenra, Elemeno P and Zed. The New Zealand reissue programme In 2012, given the breadth of the Universal New Zealand catalogue, the company embarked on an extensive reissue programme. The scope was ambitious: to reissue everything the company owned which was recorded in New Zealand or by New Zealanders, even catalogue that was now in the public domain in New Zealand, digitally, remastered where possible from the original master tapes. The company appointed former EMI NZ Managing Director Chris Caddick to undertake this task. Caddick was in the midst of an earlier reissue programme, under the wing of Recorded Music New Zealand, the New Zealand Music Industry body of which he was the Board Chair, called Tied To The Tracks. The relatively small size of New Zealand and the fact that most recordings done by New Zealanders in New Zealand have been made after 1949 helped make the programme achievable. That, coupled with the fact that Universal NZ owned the rights to the vast bulk of these recordings up to the 1980s, also gave this historic importance. More than that, it would likely be the first time globally that much of a nation's musical past was available online. That it was driven by the local operating company of a multi-national media corporation made the process even more unique. The programme in New Zealand was supported by, George Ash, President of Universal Music, Australia and New Zealand. Ash, a New Zealander based in Sydney, Australia, also gave Universal NZ access to works recorded in Australia by New Zealanders. A major part of the process was the establishment of a clear chain of ownership especially to the smaller independent labels acquired by Universal NZ's predecessor. This was done by an independent researcher using resources from local government records, private archives and Archives New Zealand. The bulk of the catalogue, this being the albums, was sourced, remastered and digitised by the end of 2019, with new artist contracts signed at contemporary rates and singles not found on the original albums added as bonus tracks. This numbered 393 albums. That left the stray tracks by artists who had never recorded an album. In 2020 Caddick compiled a list of some 19 collections of between 30 and 40 tracks, gathered thematically and began the slow process of clearing and collating these.

He was active during the reign of shah Peroz I (r. 457-484), Balash (r. 484 ‚Äì 488) and Kavad I (r. 488-496). He is often confused with his father Zarmihr Hazarwuxt and son Zarmihr Karen. He first appears in 484, when Peroz I appoints him as the minister (wuzurg framadƒÅr) of the empire. Peroz I was defeated and killed the same year during a campaign against the Hephthalite Empire, which seized much of the empire's eastern territory. Sukhra then avenged Peroz I by invading Hephthalite territory and inflicting a major defeat on them. When he returned from his campaign, he was praised by the Sasanian nobles, and Balash was elected as king. However, it was in reality Sukhra that had control over the empire. In 488, Sukhra had Balash deposed and installed Peroz I's son Kavad I as the new king. However, Sukhra still remained the power behind the throne. In 493, Kavad I had Sukhra exiled to Shiraz in order to minimize his power. Fearful of rebellion, Kavad I asked for the assistance of Shapur of Ray, who defeated Sukhra's loyalists, and had him captured and sent to Ctesiphon, where he was executed.  Biography =The death of Peroz I and the reign of Balash Sukhra was born in Shiraz in the administrative division of Ardashir-Khwarrah in Pars‚Äîhe was the son of Zarmihr Hazarwuxt, a Sasanian commander who was active in Armenia. In 484, Peroz I, before invading the territory of the Hephthalite Empire, had his brother Balash installed as viceroy, and Sukhra appointed as his minister. Peroz I, however, suffered a major defeat to the Hephthalites and was killed at the battle of Herat. According to al-Tabari, Sukhra was the governor of Sakastan before his appointment as minister. Sukhra then set out to avenge his death, and took the majority of the Sasanian army with him; when he reached Gorgan, the Hephthalite king Khushnavaz got informed of his plan to attack him, and quickly prepared his men for war. He then sent a message to Sukhra \\"asking him about his intentions and enquiring what his name and his official position were.\\" Sukhra shortly sent a message back to Khushnavaz, informing him about his name and position. Khushnavaz thereafter sent another message, warning him of doing the same mistake as Peroz I. However, his words did not discourage Sukhra, who then marched against Khushnavaz, and inflicted a heavy defeat on his men. Khushnavaz thereafter sued for peace, which Sukhra would only accept if he would give him everything Khushnavaz had seized from Peroz I's camp, which included his treasuries, the chief priest (mowbed) of the empire, and his daughter Perozdukht. Khushnavaz accepted his demands, and peace was made. Hephthalites in the Shahnameh. After his victory, he returned to the Sasanian capital of Ctesiphon, where the nobles \\"received him with great honor, extolled his feats, and raised him to a lofty status such as none but kings were able to attain after him\\" Balash was thereafter crowned as the new king of the empire. However, he proved unpopular among the nobility and clergy who had him deposed after just four years in 488. Sukhra, who had played a key role in Balash's deposition, appointed Peroz I's young son Kavad I as the new shah of Iran. According to Miskawayh (d. 1030), Sukhra was Kavad's maternal uncle. Reign of Kavad I and Sukhra's fall from power and death Even after the ascension of a new Sasanian king, Sukhra still possessed a massive amount of power. The young and inexperienced Kavad was tutored by Sukhra during his first five years as shah. During this period, Kavad was a mere figurehead, whilst Sukhra was the de facto ruler of the empire. This is emphasized by al-Tabari, who states that Sukhra \\"was in charge of government of the kingdom and the management of affairs ... [T]he people came to Sukhra and undertook all their dealings with him, treating Kavad as a person of no importance and regarding his commands with contempt.\\" Numerous regions and the representatives of the elite paid tribute to Sukhra not to Kavad. Sukhra controlled the royal treasury and the Iranian military. In 493, Kavad, having reached adulthood, wanted to put an end to Sukhra's dominance, and had him exiled to his native Shiraz in southwestern Iran. Even in exile, however, Sukhra was in control of everything except the kingly crown. He bragged about having put Kavad on the throne. Alarmed by the thought that Sukhra might rebel, Kavad wanted to get rid of him completely. He lacked the manpower to do so, however, as the army was controlled by Sukhra and the Sasanians relied mainly on the military of the Seven Great Houses of Iran. He found his solution in Shapur of Ray, a powerful nobleman from the House of Mihran, and a resolute opponent of Sukhra. Shapur, at the head of an army of his own men and disgruntled nobles, marched to Shiraz, defeated Sukhra's forces, and imprisoned him in Ctesiphon. Even in prison, Sukhra was considered too powerful and was executed. This caused displeasure among some prominent members of the nobility weakening Kavad's status as shah.  Legacy  Even after Sukhra's death, his family still possessed much power within the Sasanian Empire. His son, Zarmihr Karen, helped Kavad in 488 to reclaim the Sasanian throne from his younger brother Djamasp. In the same year, one of Sukhra's other sons, Bozorgmehr, was appointed as the minister of the empire, and continued serve under the office during the reign of Kavad's successor, Khosrow I (r. 531‚Äì579). He thereafter served as spahbed under Khosrow I's successor Hormizd IV. Zarmihr Karen, along with Sukhra's other son Karin, aided Khosrow I in his war against the Turks. As a reward for their aid, Zarmihr Karen was rewarded with land in Zabulistan, while Karin was rewarded with land in Tabaristan,Pourshariati (2008), p. 113 thus starting the Qarinvand dynasty, which ruled until the 11th-century. Sukhra's son Simah-i Burzin served as the spahbed of the kust of Khorasan during the reign of Khosrow I. A descendant of Sukhra, Burzin Shah, was the governor of Nishapur during the reign of Yazdegerd III (r. 632‚Äì651).Pourshariati (2008), pp. 273-274  References  Sources   * * Category:5th-century Iranian people Category:493 deaths Category:Generals of Peroz I Category:Year of birth unknown Category:House of Karen Category:People executed by the Sasanian Empire Category:People from Shiraz Category:Viziers of the Sasanian Empire Category:Sasanian governors of Sakastan Category:Shahnameh characters Category:450s births Category:Generals of Kavad I ","title":"Sukhra"},{"id":"40954783","text":"Oberkassel Nord is a station served by line 66 of the Bonn Stadtbahn and line 62 of Bonn's tram system.
