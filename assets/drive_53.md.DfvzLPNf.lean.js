Egbert was the scion of the influential Eastphalian family of the Brunonen. He inherited the familial lands in Brunswick and from about 1051 he shared the chief authority in the region with the Bishop of Hildesheim. Egbert also extended his authority and estates into Frisia under the suzerainty of the Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen. Although closely related to the Salian dynasty, Egbert participated in the coup d'√©tat of Kaiserswerth in 1062, whereat a group of nobles acting under Anno II, Archbishop of Cologne, tried to seize authority in the kingdom from King Henry IV and his regent mother, the Empress Agnes. In 1058, Egbert married Immilla, the daughter of Ulric Manfred II of Turin, and widow of Otto of Schweinfurt. Egbert tried to repudiate Immilla shortly before his death in 1068.

The society is also mandated to regulate the practice of law, and support and assist lawyers, articled students and lawyers of other jurisdictions who are permitted to practise law in British Columbia in fulfilling their duties in the practice of law. == Governance structure == The Law Society is overseen by a board of governors known as Benchers, composed of 25 lawyers elected by the registrants of the Law Society, up to six Benchers who are not lawyers and who are appointed by the government, and the attorney general of BC. The attorney general is typically represented in this role by the deputy attorney general. The Benchers are responsible for governing and administering the affairs of the Law Society including setting standards for admission, conduct and competence. These are established through the Law Society Rules. The Law Society is a member of the Federation of Law Societies of Canada, the national coordinating body of Canada‚Äôs 14 law societies. With the exception of the president, first vice-president and second vice- president, all elected Benchers, as well as all members of Bencher committees, subcommittees and task forces, are volunteers to the Law Society. Benchers serve two-year terms up to a maximum of four terms and can be re-elected. The senior Bencher is the president, who serves a one-year term in that position. The executive director, or chief executive officer, of the Law Society directs the Society‚Äôs operations. == History == The roots of the Law Society trace back to England. Motivated in part by the new-found wealth of the gold rush, Queen Victoria dispatched an experienced English lawyer, Matthew Baillie Begbie, to establish and protect the lands to which her country laid claim. Begbie crossed the Atlantic Ocean, bringing with him official documents establishing the Colony of British Columbia. Those papers were signed by Governor James Douglas on November 18, 1858 at Fort Langley. The following day, Begbie was sworn into office as high court judge of the colonies of British Columbia and Vancouver Island. On December 24, 1858, Justice Begbie published an Order of the Court which gave the first official recognition to barristers and solicitors in the colonies. The Order noted that only one lawyer was qualified to act as a barrister in a court of law ‚Äî Henry Pering Pellew Crease. Crease believed that the legal profession needed to be regulated, particularly since Begbie‚Äôs lengthy absences while administering justice in BC‚Äôs vast frontier made it difficult for the judge to do so in a timely and effective manner. On July 15, 1869, Crease assembled 13 members of the legal profession in the colony. Together, they founded the Law Society of British Columbia, the objectives of which were: creation of a law library; publication of legal decisions; regulation of calls to the bar; and protection of the interests of the legal profession. The province formally incorporated the Law Society in 1884. === Historical timeline === * 1884: the Law Society is incorporated by the BC legislature * 1912: the first woman, Mabel Penery French, is called to the Bar in BC * 1921: the Law Society adopts the Canons of Legal Ethics * 1947: the Law Society establishes a Special Compensation Fund for victims of theft by a lawyer * 1953: the first Chinese Canadian, Andrew Joe, is called to the Bar in BC * 1957: the first Black Canadian, Edsworth McAuley Searles, is called to the Bar in BC * 1958: the first Japanese Canadian, George Fujisawa is called to the Bar in BC * 1962: the first Aboriginal person, Alfred J. Scow, is called to the Bar in BC * 1969: the Law Society proposes a Legal Aid Society * 1970: the Law Society publishes the Professional Conduct Handbook * 1971: the first woman, Mary Southin, QC, is elected a Bencher * 1980: the first Benchers‚Äô Bulletin is published * 1983: the Law Society begins the Professional Legal Training Program for new lawyers * 1988: the first Benchers without a legal background are appointed; among them is well-known BC journalist Jack Webster == Functions of the Law Society == Law Society of BC provides a range of services for lawyers and the public including: * determining the standards for admission to the legal profession; * providing several educational programs and overseeing the required annual ongoing development program for lawyers; * setting ethical standards for all lawyers; * setting practice standards of competency; * providing liability insurance for lawyers and trust protection coverage for the public; * investigating allegations of lawyer misconduct, resolving complaints and taking disciplinary action where necessary. === Determining the standards for admission to the legal profession === The Law Society ensures new lawyers are qualified to practice in BC by managing admissions and credentials. The Professional Legal Training Course (PLTC) is the Law Society's 10-week, bar admission course. Successful completion of the course is one of the requirements for becoming a lawyer in BC. PLTC emphasises practical skills training, ethics, practice management and procedure to help new lawyers bridge the gap between law school and practice. The Credentials Committee is responsible for overseeing the enrolment, education, examination and call to the bar of articled students, the transfer of lawyers to BC and the reinstatement of former lawyers. When the character or fitness of an applicant for admission, readmission or transfer needs to be addressed, the committee considers the application directly or orders a formal credentials hearing. The committee is also responsible for reviewing applications relating to a student's failed standing in PLTC and for considering any matters arising from the articling system. === Educational programs === The Law Society provides several educational programs online and oversees the mandatory continuing professional development program. It requires that, each calendar year, all practising BC lawyers complete and report completion of at least 12 hours of continuing professional development in accredited educational activities. === Setting ethical standards for all lawyers === The Law Society employs a team of staff lawyers, designated as practice advisors and dedicated to giving professional ethical advice. In carrying out their work, BC lawyers must maintain acceptable standards of conduct, many of which are set out in the Code of Professional Conduct for British Columbia (BC Code), as adopted by the Benchers. Chapter 2 of the BC Code contains the Canons of Legal Ethics, which sets out some of the overriding principles of ethical conduct. It is a lawyer‚Äôs duty to promote the interests of the state, serve the cause of justice, maintain the authority and dignity of the courts, be faithful to clients, be candid and courteous in relations with other lawyers and demonstrate personal integrity. The Ethics Committee assists the Benchers in the setting ethical standards for BC lawyers. The committee identifies current professional responsibility issues and makes recommendations on changes to the BC Code for consideration by the Benchers. The committee also interprets existing BC Code rules, gives advice to individual lawyers and publishes opinions to the profession at large on matters of professional responsibility. === Setting practice standards of competency === To qualify as competent, the Law Society maintains that a lawyer in BC must acquire and maintain adequate knowledge of the substantive law, knowledge of the practice and procedures by which that substantive law can be effectively applied and skills to represent the client's interests effectively. The Practice Standards Committee reviews information about lawyers who may have competency-related problems and, when appropriate, orders investigations. The Committee recommends ways for lawyers with competency problems to become competent, such as through remedial programs, or restricts them from some areas of practice when necessary to protect the public. The Committee also helps plan programs to assist lawyers to practise more competently and maintain their own competence, and assists the Benchers in setting competency-related policy. === Providing liability insurance for lawyers === The Lawyers Insurance Fund is the program established by the Law Society to provide insurance for BC lawyers, and protects the profession and the public from the risks associated with the practice of law by providing high quality professional liability and defalcation insurance. Professional liability insurance protects lawyers who are liable for negligence and ensures that clients receive compensation to which they are entitled. Lawyers are also protected if they fall victim to the \\"bad cheque\\" scam, helping ensure that clients do not suffer a financial loss. === Providing trust protection coverage to the public === Since 1949, the Law Society has provided financial protection so that innocent members of the public do not suffer hardship because of the actions of a dishonest lawyer. Since 2004, this protection has been provided under the compulsory insurance program of the Lawyers Insurance Fund. Law firms are required to submit an annual trust report to the Law Society. Some are also asked to file an additional accountant‚Äôs report if a further review is necessary. Law Society compliance auditors conduct on-site audits of all law firms at least once every six years. The goal of the audits is to help law firms correct minor problems with record-keeping, do an in-depth review of client files to ensure trust funds are being handled properly, to answer any questions lawyers may have about trust accounting. The audits also ensure lawyers develop proper accounting systems, record-keeping practices and trust fund handling procedures. === Investigating lawyer misconduct, resolving complaints and taking disciplinary action === The Law Society has authority to review the conduct and competence of lawyers practising in BC, including lawyers in private practice, legal aid lawyers, government lawyers and Crown prosecutors. The Law Society can also review the conduct of a lawyer outside the practice of law if the alleged conduct is in violation of the BC Code. Every formal complaint about conduct and competence is reviewed and considered, approximately 1,100 complaints are handled each year. Like most regulatory bodies, the Law Society uses a system of progressive or graduated discipline to respond to lawyer violations of the Act, Rules and the BC Code. After a full investigation, about 13-16% of complaints made to the Law Society are considered for progressive discipline. These complaints are referred to the Discipline Committee, which then decides whether any further action is required and if so, whether to issue letter of reprimand, order a conduct meeting or conduct review or direct that a citation be issued. == Honours and awards == The Benchers offer formal recognition of those in the legal community for achievement and service to the public and the profession. === The Law Society Award === The Law Society Award honours the lifetime contribution of the truly exceptional in the legal profession. Offered every two years, the award is based on the criteria of integrity, professional achievement, service and law reform. The Award is made chiefly in recognition of contributions to the advancement of the profession or the law, but public service outside the legal profession will be considered. === 50 and 60-year certificates === Each year the Law Society honours longstanding lawyers through the presentation of 50 and 60-year certificates, in tribute to their cumulative years in the profession. For those lawyers who have previously served as a judge, all years of service on the Bench are acknowledged as forming part of that service record. === Law Society Gold Medal === Each year the Law Society awards gold medals to each of the graduating law students from the University of British Columbia, the University of Victoria and Thompson Rivers University who have achieved the highest cumulative grade point average over their respective three-year programs. === Law Society scholarship for graduate legal studies === The Law Society Scholarship encourages and financially assists a law graduate to complete a full-time program of graduate legal studies that will benefit the student, the province and the legal profession in BC. === Aboriginal scholarship === The Law Society offers a scholarship for Aboriginal graduate students in the field of law. The annual award aims to enhance the retention of Aboriginal lawyers by supporting the development of Indigenous leaders and role models in the legal academic community. Retaining Aboriginal lawyers in the profession has been a key objective for the Society. ==References== ==External links== * The Law Society of British Columbia * The Federation of Law Societies * Province of British Columbia British Columbia Category:British Columbia law Category:1869 establishments in the British Empire * Category:Organizations established in 1869 ","title":"Law Society of British Columbia"},{"id":"11642339","text":"Camponotus pennsylvanicus, or the black carpenter ant, is one of the largest and most common species of carpenter ant native to the central and eastern United States as well as eastern Canada. ==Description== Black carpenter ant male C. pennsylvanicus can be distinguished from other carpenter ant species by the dull black color of the head and body, and by whitish or yellowish hairs on the abdomen. All castes of this species (including the major and minor workers, queens, and males) are black or blackish. Colonies' workers are not all the same size (polymorphism). The queens can reach a length of 19‚Äì21 mm and the largest workers (super majors) can achieve similar sizes of around 14‚Äì17 mm . They, along with several other Camponotus species, are among the largest species of ant in North America. As with all ants, the antennae are elbowed. Workers usually have 12 antenna segments. Alates typically have yellowish wings. ==Behavior== Black carpenter ants are known to forage up to 100 yd (91 m) in search of food, establishing chemical (pheromone) trails as they forage. Nests can contain thousands of individuals, and such large nests may be noticed by the audible cracking sound the workers produce. The black carpenter ant cannot sting, but the larger workers can administer a sharp bite, which can become further irritated by the spraying of formic acid onto the wound. Workers tend aphids, with the smaller workers collecting honeydew and transferring it to larger workers that carry it back to the nest. In addition, foragers feed on dead insects and plant juices. ==Range== The black carpenter ants range is almost everywhere east of the Rocky Mountains in woodlands, forest edges, and suburban communities. ==Control measures== In their natural environment, carpenter ants nest in dead trees and other dead wood. This enhances decay, which has ecological benefits. However, the ant achieves pest status when a colony invades the wood of a house or other structure, damaging its structural integrity.http://lancaster.unl.edu/pest/resources/carpant004.shtml Carpenter Ant Management Since they favor moist wood as a habitat, any condition that promotes moisture should be eliminated to prevent infestation. The easiest of these is keeping gutters clear so water does not run down the side of the structure or gain entry. Moist wood is much easier to chew. The ants do not eat the wood, but remove it to create galleries for their activities. The galleries run parallel to the grain, as they are created in the softer, nonlignin portions of the timber. The galleries have a sandpaper-like feel, due to fecal remnants, but the mud tubes produced by termites will not be present. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Camponotus Category:Household pest insects Category:Insects described in 1773 Category:Insects of the United States Category:Insects of Canada ","title":"Black carpenter ant"},{"id":"11642350","text":"Elizabeth Stuart may refer to: ==Members of the royal House of Stuart== *Elizabeth Stuart, Countess of Lennox (1555‚Äì1582), mother of Arabella Stuart *Elizabeth Stuart, 2nd Countess of Moray (1565‚Äì1591), daughter of James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray and Agnes Keith *Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia (1596‚Äì1662), daughter of James VI/I of Scotland and England *Elizabeth Stuart (1610‚Äì1674), daughter of Esm√© Stewart, 3rd Duke of Lennox *Elizabeth Stuart (daughter of Charles I) (1635‚Äì1650), daughter of Charles I of England and Scotland *Elizabeth Stuart (daughter of James II) (1678‚Äì1678/1679), daughter of James II/VII of England and Scotland and Mary of Modena == Other people == *Elizabeth Stuart (theologian) (born 1963), British theologian *Elizabeth A.

The station currently broadcasts a Top 40/CHR format branded as 99.7 Now. KMVQ's studios are located at 3rd and Howard in downtown San Francisco, while its transmitter is located on San Bruno Mountain. KMVQ-FM is owned by Bonneville International. KMVQ directly competes with crosstown Top 40s KYLD and KREV. Other competing stations include heritage Urban KMEL and Rhythmic AC KRBQ. KMVQ broadcasts in the HD Radio format. HD Radio Guide for San Francisco ==History== The 99.7 FM frequency was originally owned by NBC, with sister station KNBR. The station signed on the air on October 12, 1949 as KNBC-FM. At various times, it aired a middle of the road format as KNBR-FM and an all-news format as KNAI-FM. The KNBR-FM call letters returned to the market in 2019, this time on 104.5, the former KFOG. ===KYUU=== In 1978, NBC decided to take advantage of the newfound success of FM radio, so programmers were hired to create a new format, similar to Top 40 but targeting a market they felt was underserved, adults in the 25-34 age range. Years later, this approach would be labeled as \\"Hot adult contemporary.\\" The station became KYUU. Over time, the station migrated to more of a Top 40 format as \\"The Hit Music Station\\". By 1986, with KMEL dominating as the Bay Area's Top 40 station, the station migrated back to its Hot AC direction. During much of this time, KYUU's morning host was Don Bleu. ===X-100=== In 1988, NBC decided to sell all its owned-and-operated radio stations and concentrate on television. KYUU was among the last to be sold when Emmis Communications bought the radio station. Emmis made many changes, and due to heavy competition, in October 1988, decided to relaunch the station as X-100 and changed the call letters to KXXX. It had a dance-leaning CHR approach, mixing Top 40 hits with dance music. Notable personalities included George McFly, Chuck Geiger, Super Snake, Rex McNeil and morning hosts Bill Kelly & Al Kline. X-100 fared poorly, unable to topple KMEL in the ratings, compared to the legacy of KYUU. This led Emmis to sell the station to real estate developer Peter Bedford under his \\"Coast Broadcasting\\" division. X-100 flipped to oldies as KFRC-FM on March 18, 1991.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- Billboard/90s/1991/BB-1991-03-16.pdf The following month, Bedford would buy 610 AM from RKO General, completing the sell-off of RKO's radio division. In January 1993, Alliance Broadcasting, a company run by former KYUU general manager John Hayes, would buy KFRC. On August 12, 1993, KFRC-FM began simulcasting on 610 AM.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1993/RR-1993-08-20.pdf ===Oldies 99.7 KFRC=== This was not KFRC's first attempt at FM broadcasting. For many years, KFRC owned an FM counterpart at 106.1 FM, which carried a variety of formats. In 1977, KFRC's owners sold off the money-losing FM station at 106.1 (which soon became successful AOR station KMEL). Over the next few years, as the FM band eclipsed AM in popularity, it became clear that the owners had made a mistake. This was finally remedied in 1991 under different ownership with the purchase of KXXX. As KFRC, 99.7 FM simulcast the oldies format of its well-known sister AM station. The oldies format proved very successful in the Bay Area market, reaching number one with the 25-54 year old demographic. In September 1995, Alliance would be bought out by Infinity Broadcasting. In 2005, Infinity Broadcasting (later becoming CBS Radio) traded 610 AM to Christian radio broadcaster Family Stations, the owners of KEAR, for their station at 106.9 FM. On April 29, 2005, Family Stations began simulcasting the signal of their FM station on 610 AM, and the oldies format and KFRC call letters remained at 99.7 FM. On September 5, 2005, KFRC relaunched its oldies format, this time focusing on 1970s & 1980s music with a low-key approach. The station billed itself as \\"the Bay Area's Classic Hits.\\" ===MOViN' 99.7=== Logo for MOViN 99.7, 2006-2007 At 10:03 a.m. on September 22, 2006, after playing \\"American Pie\\" by Don McLean, KFRC switched to a Rhythmic AC format, relaunching this time as \\"The New Movin' 99.7\\" (with KFRC calls) with \\"Gonna Make You Sweat\\" by C+C Music Factory as the first song. The Movin' brand had previously been picked up by KQMV/Seattle, KMVN/Los Angeles, KYMV/Salt Lake City, KMVK/Dallas and WMVN/St. Louis. The format switch was met with sharp criticism from long time listeners of the oldies format because it was the last remaining oldies station in the region. On May 17, 2007, CBS Radio decided to bring back the old KFRC, as they dropped the \\"Free FM\\" talk format on 106.9 FM and revived the old \\"classic hits\\" format. The KFRC call sign moved to 106.9 FM. As a result, 99.7 FM received the new call sign KMVQ. (KFRC-FM is now an All-news radio station, simulcasting KCBS 740.) ===Transition to CHR=== During the late summer and early fall of 2008, KMVQ evolved towards a Rhythmic-leaning Top 40 format with occasional classic rhythmic songs carried over from the previous format, becoming the first mainstream top 40 station for San Francisco in six years since KZQZ flipped to country in 2002. As a result, KMVQ became musically similar to CBS Radio's other newly launched top 40 stations in Houston, Los Angeles, New York City and Detroit. To fill the void, Clear Channel's KISQ shifted from urban AC to rhythmic AC. In early 2009, KMVQ added many former DJ's from KYLD, including St. John and Strawberry to its weekday lineup. Later that year, on November 12, KMVQ added Fernando and Greg in the Morning as the station's new morning show, replacing Baltazar and Maria. The pair are the first openly gay duo to host a morning broadcast on American commercial radio. Before moving to KMVQ, the show was initially established on KNGY. ====99.7 NOW==== In mid-2010, KMVQ changed its logo to match the \\"AMP Radio\\" stations in Los Angeles (KAMP-FM) and Detroit (WDZH). The station began using the slogan \\"All The Hits!\\" On December 31, 2010, the station re-branded as \\"99-7 Now\\" to match the CBS owned WNOW-FM (92-3 Now) in New York City. On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced that it would merge with Entercom. To comply with FCC ownership limits, it was announced that KMVQ, Entercom's KBLX, KOIT, and KUFX, and a cluster in Sacramento, would be divested. Under a local marketing agreement, Bonneville assumed operations of the stations following the completion of the merger on November 17. On August 3, 2018, Bonneville announced that it would acquire all of the divested Entercom stations it had been operating for $141 million; the sale was completed on September 21, 2018. ==Booster== KMVQ is rebroadcast on the following FM booster: ==HD Radio== KMVQ-HD1 airs the same programming as the analog frequency. KMVQ-HD2 features a Dance format, billed as \\"Pulse Radio.\\" The move came about after KNGY dropped its Dance format for Top 40/CHR in September 2009. The station became a full-time reporter on Billboard's Dance/Mix Show Airplay reporting panel in May 2019.\\"Billboard Dance Chart Upstarts: Dynoro & Ina Wroldsen, Flying Lotus, Don Diablo\\" from Billboard (May 9, 2019) ==References== ==External links== * *The Unplugged 99.7 KYUU Radio Archive *KFRC switches from oldies to music of 1970s and '80s, from the San Francisco Chronicle *The History of KFRC Radio MVQ-FM Category:Mass media in Oakland, California Category:Radio stations established in 1949 Category:Contemporary hit radio stations in the United States Category:Dance radio stations Category:NBC Radio Network affiliates Category:1949 establishments in California Category:Bonneville International ","title":"KMVQ-FM"},{"id":"11642389","title":"KFRC (defunct)"},{"id":"11642435","text":"Tom Daly may refer to: *Tom Daly (catcher) (1891‚Äì1946), American baseball catcher for the Chicago White Sox, Cleveland Indians, and Chicago Cubs, and Boston Red Sox coach, 1933‚Äì1946 *Tom Daly (infielder) (1866‚Äì1938), American baseball second baseman for the Chicago Cubs, Washington Nationals, Brooklyn Dodgers, Chicago White Sox, and Cincinnati Reds *Tom Daly (filmmaker) (1918‚Äì2011), Canadian film producer *Tom Daly (basketball) (born 1991), Australian basketball player *Tom Daly (American politician) (born 1954), American politician in California *Tom Daly (Irish politician) (born 1938), Irish nationalist politician *Tommy Daly (1894‚Äì1936), Irish hurler *Tom Daly (rugby union) (born 1993), Irish rugby player ==See also== *Thomas Daly (disambiguation) *Tom Daley (disambiguation) ","title":"Tom Daly"},{"id":"11642469","text":"Virginia \\"Ginni\\" Lamp Thomas (born February 23, 1957), is an American attorney and lobbyist who founded Liberty Consulting. She had previously founded the conservative advocacy group Liberty Central, and served as its president until its merger with the Patrick Henry Center for Individual Liberty. She writes columns for The Daily Caller and previously worked at The Heritage Foundation. She is the wife of U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Clarence Thomas. Her lobbying activities have been raised as a potential source of conflict of interest for her husband. ==Early life and education== Thomas grew up in Omaha, Nebraska, the youngest of four children born to Donald Lamp, a successful engineer who owned his own firm, and Marjorie Lamp, a stay-at-home mother. Her parents were Republicans. Thomas attended Westside High School in Omaha, where she was a member of the student government, the debate club, and the Republican club. While she was still in high school, her ambition was to be a member of Congress. She enrolled in a woman's college in Virginia because of its proximity to Washington, D.C., subsequently transferred to the University of Nebraska, and then to Creighton University to be closer to a boyfriend. She received a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and Business Communication from Creighton University (1979) and a Juris Doctor from Creighton University School of Law (1983), after a hiatus working as a legislative aide for Congressman Hal Daub. ==Career== ===1981‚Äì1995=== When Congressman Daub took office in 1981, Thomas moved to Washington, D.C., and worked in his office for 18 months. After completing her degree at Creighton University School of Law (1983), she worked one more year for Daub in Washington as his Legislative Director. From 1985 to 1989, she was employed as an attorney and labor relations specialist at the United States Chamber of Commerce, attending congressional hearings where she lobbied on behalf of the interests of the business community. Her advocacy included arguing against the passage of the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which requires larger employers to provide temporary unpaid leave to employees to care for a new child or during a serious personal or family illness. In 1989, she became Manager of Employee Relations at the Chamber of Commerce. ===1991‚Äì2009=== Virginia Thomas at her husband's swearing in as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court In 1991, Thomas returned to government service in the Legislative Affairs Office of the United States Department of Labor, where she argued against comparable-worth legislation that would have mandated equal pay for women and men in jobs deemed to be comparable. That year, her husband, Clarence Thomas was nominated by President George H. W. Bush to fill the open seat on the U.S. Supreme Court left by the retirement of Justice Thurgood Marshall. She attended the contentious Senate confirmation hearings and stood by her husband as he was accused of sexual harassment. During the confirmation hearings, several Democratic Senators claimed that her job with the Labor Department might create a conflict of interest for her husband if he was seated on the Supreme Court. After her husband was narrowly confirmed by a majority vote of 52 to 48, Mrs. Thomas described the televised scrutiny and confirmation process as a \\"trial by fire\\". Her next job was as a Policy Analyst for Congressman Dick Armey, who was then the Republican House Conference Chairman. In 1994, while Thomas was working for Armey. By 2000, she was working for the Heritage Foundation. Conflict of interest was raised yet again because she was collecting r√©sum√©s for potential Presidential appointments in the George W. Bush Administration when the Supreme Court was deciding Bush v. Gore. She continued to work at the Heritage Foundation during the administration of George W. Bush, serving as the White House Liaison for the think tank. She serves on the Alumni Advisory Board of her alma mater, Creighton University School of Law. ===2009‚Äìpresent=== In late 2009, Thomas started a nonprofit lobbying group, Liberty Central, to organize conservative activists, issue score cards for Congress members, and be involved in elections. The group is aimed at opposing what Thomas has called the leftist \\"tyranny\\" of President Barack Obama and Congressional Democrats and \\"protecting the core founding principles\\" of the nation. Thomas was interviewed by Sean Hannity on his Fox News show Hannity in June 2010. When asked about potential conflicts between her Liberty Central activities and her husband's position, Thomas replied, \\"there's a lot of judicial wives and husbands out there causing trouble. I'm just one of many.\\" In February 2011, Politico reported that Thomas was the head of a new company, Liberty Consulting, which filed incorporation papers in mid-November 2010. The company's website states that clients can use Thomas's \\"experience and connections\\" to help \\"with \\"governmental affairs efforts\\" and political donation strategies. The Washington Post described Liberty Consulting as \\"a one-woman shop\\" where Thomas advised political donors how to direct funds in the post-Citizens United landscape. In July 2013, Thomas was identified as a key member of Groundswell, a coalition of right-wing activists and journalists attempting to make political change behind the scenes through lobbying of high-level contacts. Thomas endorsed Ted Cruz in the 2016 Republican primaries. After Cruz dropped out, she supported Donald Trump. Thomas serves on the advisory council of Turning Point USA. Thomas has stirred controversy due to her inflammatory political rhetoric and promotion of conspiracy theories. In 2018, she shared Facebook posts that characterized California as a war zone, alleged voter fraud by Democrats in four elections, described the teenage survivors of the Parkland shooting \\"dangerous to the survival of our nation\\" (because they advocated for gun control) and accused President Obama and Hillary Clinton of being involved in wiretapping then-candidate Donald Trump. In 2017, she held a speech saying the left wants \\"to extinguish our rights,\\" that the left \\"moves its forces across our country,\\" and that the NFL was \\"mainstreaming anti-Americanism\\" because some NFL players kneeled during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racial discrimination. She harshly criticized Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell as \\"useful idiots\\" for \\"LiberalFascists\\" because they did not condemn violence on the left during the violent white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017. She has made videos for the Daily Caller where she wondered whether \\"cultural Marxists have already won in our country.\\" On February 23, 2020, Axios reported that right-wing activists had compiled the names of individuals who were deemed to be disloyal to President Donald Trump into a list. As the leading figure in a right-wing network that works to recommend people as staffers at the White House, the article stated that Thomas had been advising Trump to purge the \\"snakes\\" who were disloyal to him from the government. It was revealed that she had directly sent a memo to Trump directly in the preceding year and a personnel office for the president had deemed some of her suggestions to be inappropriate candidates as White House faculty. After Trump was acquitted by Senate in his trial of impeachment, it was alleged that Trump would revisit some of her recommendations in subsequent pursuit of vengeance against those who testified against him throughout his impeachment. On May 28, 2020, Trump appointed Thomas as a member of the trust fund board of the Library of Congress. In October, 2020, shortly before the 2020 U.S. Presidential election, Thomas advanced the antisemitic conspiracy theory via social media that George Soros \\"is really running the Democratic Party.\\" Haaretz, the Jerusalem Post, and the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported that \\"Republican officials and activists, as well as far-right extremists and conspiracy theorists, regularly assert with scant or no evidence that he is secretly funding, or in control of, a broad array of liberal causes, or otherwise out to undermine the United States government.\\" And, that \\"[t]he idea that rich Jews are conspiring to secretly control world leaders is an age-old anti- Semitic stereotype.\\" ==Personal life== Virginia and Clarence Thomas married in 1987. They live in Virginia. Thomas converted from Protestantism to the Catholic faith in 2002. She was inspired by her husband's devotion of praying the Litany of Humility and participating in the Mass. She credits Justice Antonin Scalia, and his wife Maureen, for their love, praying Clarence Thomas back into the Church.Desmond, Joan Frawley. \\"'Fearless' Justice Clarence Thomas Walks 25 Years in Footsteps of St. Thomas More.\\" National Catholic Register, 31 Oct. 2016, On October 9, 2010, Thomas left a voicemail message for Anita Hill, whose accusations of sexual harassment complicated her husband's Senate confirmation hearings 19 years earlier. In the voicemail, Thomas said that Hill should apologize to Thomas's husband. Hill responded that she believed there was nothing to apologize for and said that her 1991 testimony about her interactions with Clarence Thomas was truthful. ===Lifespring=== In the 1980s, while a congressional aide, Thomas took training with the self-awareness program Lifespring. In 1987, she related to The Washington Post that, during her training several years earlier, she had been \\"confused and troubled\\" by lessons such as one where trainees were told to disrobe to bikinis and bathing suits then \\"made fun of fat people's bodies and riddled one another with sexual questions\\". After realizing that membership in her Lifespring group was separating her from her family, friends, and co-workers, Thomas began what proved to be a difficult and months-long process of breaking away. At one point, she hid in another part of the U.S. to avoid a constant barrage of high-pressure phone calls from Lifespring members, who felt they had a duty to keep her in the organization. Thomas ultimately came to believe that Lifespring was a cult. After leaving the group in 1985, she sought counseling and joined the Cult Awareness Network. She became a critic of controversial religious groups, speaking on panels and organizing anti-cult workshops for Congressional staffers in 1986 and 1988. In a 1991 interview, Thomas remarked, \\"I was once in a group that used mind control techniques\\"; and she called its members \\"pretty scary people.\\" ==References== ==Further reading== ;Published works * * ;Financial information * Profile at OpenSecrets.org ;Media appearances * * ==External links== * Liberty Central Category:1957 births Category:American Roman Catholics Category:Converts to Roman Catholicism from Protestantism Category:American conspiracy theorists Category:Critics of new religious movements Category:Creighton University alumni Category:Creighton University School of Law alumni Category:The Heritage Foundation Category:Living people Category:Tea Party movement activists Category:Lawyers from Omaha, Nebraska Category:Lawyers from Washington, D.C.

In 1915 he attained the chair of physiology at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, where he remained for the rest of his life. Bainbridge is best remembered for showing that an increase in pressure on the venous side of the heart resulted in an increased heart rate due to denervation of vagal influences to the heart. The eponymous \\"Bainbridge reflex\\" is named after him, being explained as an increased heart rate due to an increase of right atrial pressure. Bainbridge's findings contradicted \\"Marey's Law\\", a law that stated that an increase in blood pressure caused a lowering of the heart rate. Marey's Law was devised in 1861 by French physiologist √âtienne-Jules Marey (1830‚Äì1904). Bainbridge also made important contributions in his studies of the mechanism of lymph formation, as well as on filtration properties of the glomeruli in the kidneys.

It is common in eastern and southeastern Asia and maritime Southeast Asia, where it lives in several types of forests as well as on plantations and other cultivated areas. It is a green bird with a black head and chestnut crown. It forages on the ground for insects and their larvae, and also eats berries. It breeds between February and August, the pair being strongly territorial and building their nest on the ground. Incubation and care of the fledglings is done by both parents. The bird has a wide range, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\". ==Taxonomy== The hooded pitta was described by the German zoologist Philipp Statius M√ºller in 1776 and given the binomial name Turdus sordidus. Statius M√ºller's description was based on a plate showing the \\"Merle des Philippines\\" published by Comte de Buffon in his Planches Enlumin√©es D'Histoire Naturelle. The species is now placed in the genus Pitta that was erected by the French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1816. The specific epithet sordida is Latin for \\"shabby\\" or \\"dirty\\". Twelve subspecies are recognised: * P. s. cucullata Hartlaub, 1843 ‚Äì north India to south China and Indochina * P. s. abbotti Richmond, 1902 ‚Äì Nicobar Islands * P. s. mulleri (Bonaparte, 1850) ‚Äì Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Java, Borneo and Sulu Archipelago * P. s. bangkana Schlegel, 1863 ‚Äì Bangka and Belitung Islands (east of Sumatra) * P. s. sordida (Statius M√ºller, PL, 1776) ‚Äì Philippines (except Palawan group) * P. s. palawanensis Parkes, 1960 ‚Äì Palawan Islands (west Philippines) * P. s. sanghirana Schlegel, 1866 ‚Äì Sangir Island (northeast of Sulawesi) * P. s. forsteni (Bonaparte, 1850) ‚Äì north Sulawesi * P. s. goodfellowi White, C.M.N., 1937 ‚Äì Aru Islands (off south New Guinea) * P. s. mefoorana Schlegel, 1874 ‚Äì island of Numfor (off northwest New Guinea) * P. s. rosenbergii Schlegel, 1871 ‚Äì island of Biak (off northwest New Guinea) * P. s. novaeguineae M√ºller, S. & Schlegel, 1845 ‚Äì west Papuan islands, New Guinea and Karkar Island (off north New Guinea) ==Behaviour== Sri Phang-nga National Park, Thailand Hooded pittas can reach a length of and a weight of . It has a black head, chestnut crown and green body and wings. Its diet consists of various insects (including their larvae), which they hunt on the ground, and berries. In the breeding period, which lasts from February to August, they build nests on the ground; both parent take care of the eggs and the fledglings. They are highly territorial and their fluty double-noted whistle calls (\\"qweeek-qweeek\\") can be constantly heard from their territories, sometimes throughout the nights. The International Union for Conservation of Nature is concerned in particular about the ongoing loss of habitat that this bird suffers, which is reducing its numbers, but has rated it as being a \\"least concern species\\" because the rate of population decline is insufficient to warrant a threatened category. In captivity, hooded pittas mix well with other species although they may be aggressive toward other pittas when breeding. In London Zoo they are kept in a large walk-through aviary in the restored Blackburn Pavilion bird house, while at the Durrell Wildlife Park they are in a large walk-through exhibit with birds such as Palawan peacock-pheasants and white-rumped shamas. ==Gallery== Hooded Pitta RWD2.jpg|At San Diego Zoo Hooded Pitta Nest and Egg (14077099132).jpg|Nest with egg in Borneo Naturalis Biodiversity Center - RMNH.AVES.49765 1 - Pitta sordida muelleri Bonaparte, 1850 - Pittidae - bird skin specimen.jpeg|P. s. mulleri Bonaparte, 1850, lateral aspect of male specimen, Naturalis Pitta forsteni - 1848- - Print - Iconographia Zoologica - Special Collections University of Amsterdam - UBA01 IZ16400263, crop.tif|P. s. forsteni (Bonaparte, 1850), native to the Minahassa Peninsula == References == == External links == * BirdLife Species Factsheet hooded pitta Category:Birds of Nepal Category:Birds of Eastern Himalaya Category:Birds of Southeast Asia Category:Birds of New Guinea Category:Least concern biota of Asia hooded pitta ","title":"Hooded pitta"},{"id":"11642595","text":"T≈çkaid≈ç The is a Japanese geographical term.Deal, William E.

He was cited three times for bravery, once for capturing bandits who \\"had peppered him for a mile and a half\\" with a machine gun until their car overturned. He later became a member of the bomb squad. In 1929 he was assigned as a bodyguard whenever New York's governor was in the city. He was assigned to Albany with then-Governor Roosevelt. In the winter of 1933, when the Roosevelts moved to Washington, D.C., Gennerich was given a 60-day leave of absence so that he could complete his 25 years on the force, and retire on a $1,500-a-year pension. This allowed him to join the United States Secret Service and continue to work as President Roosevelt's bodyguard. The very first executive order issued by the newly-appointed President Roosevelt was Order 6071, which ensured Gennerich would be able to resume his position as Roosevelt's bodyguard immediately. Gennerich had grown close to Roosevelt and his family; Eleanor Roosevelt said in an edition of her newspaper column My Day that \\"He was cheerful, kindly and always willing to think of other people. He would play the piano for hours to amuse the children at Warm Springs.

His real name was Kawabata Shotar≈ç. == Biography == He was born in Wakayama city in Wakayama Prefecture. He moved to Tokyo in 1895. Initially interested in literature, he studied under the poet Kawabata Hoja, who introduced him to the Hototogisu artistic circle. He then became interested in painting instead, and studied y≈çga painting techniques as an apprentice in the studios of the Hakubakai. When he was 18, he entered a Yomiuri Shimbun illustration contest, from which his work was selected. He continued working on newspaper illustrations to earn a living as he studied oil painting. In 1913, he traveled to the United States to study western-style painting techniques in more depth, but was so impressed with the Japanese art that he saw during a visit to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts that he switched to the Nihonga genre on his return to Japan in 1914, displaying at the Inten Exhibition in 1915. He left Inten in 1928 in protest of its increasing rigid rules, and established his own Nihonga art circle, the Seiry≈´sha in 1928. The Seiry≈´sha held an exhibition on competition to the Inten twice a year from 1929 to 1965 in Tokyo. In addition, Ry≈´shi usually held a personal exhibition in Osaka once per year. Ry≈´shi was a major advocate of , which emphasized the public nature of art. His works therefore tended to be on a huge scale, and were intended for public display in large areas. After World War II, together with Yokoyama Taikan and Kawai Gyokud≈ç, he came to be regarded as one the \\"Three Big Figures\\" in the field of Nihonga painting. In 1950, after the death of his wife and son, he went on a pilgrimage of the 88 holy places in Shikoku, taking a total of six years to make the circuit, and sketching extensively along the way. In 1959, he was awarded the Order of Culture by the Japanese government.

The utility first searches and analyzes the hard drive for files that are no longer of any use, and then removes the unnecessary files. There are a number of different file categories that Disk Clean-up targets when performing the initial disk analysis: * Compression of old files * Temporary Internet files * Temporary Windows files * Downloaded program files * Recycle Bin * Removal of unused applications or optional Windows components * Setup log files * Offline web pages (cached) * WinSxS (Windows component store) The above list, however, is not exhaustive. For instance, 'Temporary Remote Desktop files' and 'Temporary Sync Files' may appear only under certain computer configurations, differences such as Windows Operating System and use of additional programs such as Remote Desktop. The option of removing hibernation data may not be ideal for some users as this may remove the hibernate option. Aside from removing unnecessary files, users also have the option of compressing files that have not been accessed over a set period of time. This option provides a systematic compression scheme. Infrequently accessed files are compressed to free up disk space while leaving the frequently used files uncompressed for faster read/write access times. If after file compression, a user wishes to access a compressed file, the access times may be increased and vary from system to system. In addition to the categories that appear on the Disk Clean- up tab, the More Options tab offers additional options for freeing up hard drive space through removal of optional Windows components, installed programs, and all but the most recent System Restore point or Shadow Copy data in some versions of Microsoft Windows.

He played 10 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the St. Louis Cardinals, Seattle Mariners, New York Yankees and Los Angeles Angels. Ryan was a shortstop but was a versatile enough defender that he made professional appearances at every position but catcher. The 2012 winner of the Fielding Bible Award, Ryan had a reputation as one of the best defensive players in baseball. ==Early and personal life== Ryan was born in Los Angeles on March 26, 1982, to Katie and Jim Ryan. He is the youngest of their four children. Ryan attended Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks, California. His father was an infielder for Loyola Marymount University and holds the school's single-season record for the most hits with a wooden bat. One of his uncles, Willie Ryan, was a National Champion First Team All-American first baseman for the USC Trojans baseball team; his other uncle, Dr. Patrick Ryan, was a college sprinter at UCLA and Michigan State. ===College career=== In the fall of 2000, Ryan enrolled at Lewis‚ÄìClark State College to play college baseball in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics. In his first season, he batted .375 with 5 triples, the third most ever by a Warrior. As a sophomore shortstop, he hit .359 with 34 RBIs and hit .378 with runners on. During the 2002 season, he hit safely in 18 straight games. Beyond his solid offensive numbers, Ryan gained a reputation as a good defensive infielder. In the 2002 summer season, Brendan played collegiate summer baseball for the Alaska Goldpanners of Fairbanks in the Alaska Baseball League. ==Professional career== In 2003, Ryan entered the MLB amateur draft and was selected in the seventh round (215th overall) by the St. Louis Cardinals. Ryan hit .311 for the Cardinals' rookie league affiliate, the New Jersey Cardinals, in 2003. In 2004, he was promoted to the Cardinals' Class A affiliate, the Peoria Chiefs. With a .322 batting average and 30 steals in the 2004 season, another promotion came for Ryan, this time to the High A Class team, the Palm Beach Cardinals, where Ryan was selected as a Florida State League All-Star. He was promoted again during the middle of 2005 season to the Class AA Springfield Cardinals. In 2006, Ryan suffered a wrist injury in spring training limiting him to 28 games spread among four stops in the minors. That same year, Ryan appeared in 28 games for the Peoria Saguaros in the Arizona Fall League and batted .310 (39-for-126) with two home runs, 19 runs and 20 RBI. His 39 hits were tied for tops for the 2006 AFL season. He collected two four-hit games and hit safely in his first eight AFL games (.425 BA) and 10 of his first 11 (.396). ===St. Louis Cardinals=== St. Louis Cardinals in 2007 Ryan was originally called up on and made his major league debut for the Cardinals on June 2, 2007, against the Houston Astros. He was later sent down on July 27, 2007, but was recalled on August 12, 2007, and remained with the Cardinals for the rest of the season. In his rookie year, he hit for a .289 batting average with 4 home runs and 11 runs batted in. Ryan also scored 29 runs and recorded 7 stolen bases without being caught stealing. He batted significantly better against left-handed pitching in his first season with a batting average of .354, as opposed to his .232 average against right-handers. His first major league home run was a game-winner in the top of the 11th inning off of Scott Schoeneweis of the New York Mets on June 26, 2007. His second home run also came rather dramatically, as he contributed to a four run comeback on July 4, 2007 when the Cardinals were at one point behind 4‚Äì1. The Cardinals won the game 5‚Äì4 against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Ryan opened the 2008 season on the 15-day disabled list with a right oblique strain suffered in spring training. He rehabbed injury in the minor leagues in the first month of the season until called up on April 23. He was the Cardinals' primary utility infielder for the most of the season, although he played three games in the outfield. He was optioned to Memphis on August 6 and recalled again on September 2. Ryan started the 2009 season in St. Louis. He went on the 15-day disabled from April 30 through May 15 with a left hamstring strain, making a rehab stint in Memphis. By June, he moved up to be the everyday shortstop, batting over .300 and playing spectacular defense. On August 20, 2009, in the second inning of the Cardinals and Padres Game, Ryan hit his first career grand slam off of San Diego pitcher Tim Stauffer. On September 19, 2009, Ryan hit a walk off single off Chicago Cubs closer Carlos M√°rmol. Ryan also had a home run in the 2‚Äì1 win. His game-winning single was the first walk-off hit of his career. By the end of the 2009 regular season, Ryan's defense at shortstop had been recognized as a major factor in the Cardinals' divisional title. However, in February 2010, he underwent a procedure to debride dead tissue from his right wrist performed by Dr. Steven Shin in Los Angeles.Cardinals Press Release stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com, February 10, 2010 (accessed August 1, 2010) The start to his 2010 spring training debut was delayed due to the surgery. He made his 2010 Grapefruit League debut on March 20, but he showed no lingering effects.Dorsey, Steve Ryan shows no rust in Grapefruit debut MLB.com, March 20, 2010 (accessed August 1, 2010) Seattle Mariners in 2013, warms up before a game against the Oakland Athletics in Oakland. ===Seattle Mariners=== On December 12, 2010, Ryan was traded to the Seattle Mariners for Maikel Cleto. On July 26, 2011, Ryan broke up CC Sabathia's bid for a perfect game with a base hit with one out in the seventh inning. On August 2, 2011, during a game against the Oakland Athletics, alert play by Ryan led to the unusual result of his reaching third on an infield hit. Ryan hit a ground ball fielded by Oakland shortstop Eric Sogard, but Sogard was left off-balance and his throw to first was late. Behind the back of Oakland first baseman Conor Jackson, Ryan ran for second which was left uncovered by Sogard, and then immediately for third as that base was also uncovered. While referred to in the media as an \\"infield triple\\", the play was officially scored as a single and fielder's choice. In 2011, Ryan finished second for the second straight year in the voting for the Fielding Bible Award. On April 21, 2012, Ryan was the final out of Philip Humber's perfect game. He was called for a swinging third strike on a checked swing, though the ball was not caught cleanly. Rather than running to first base, Ryan momentarily argued umpire Brian Runge's decision that he had swung, allowing catcher A.J. Pierzynski to throw the ball to first base for the final out. On June 8, he entered as a defensive replacement in the ninth inning of the Mariners' combined no-hitter against the Los Angeles Dodgers and made one of the game's closest putouts by throwing Dee Gordon out at first base. On August 15 of that same year, he scored the game's only run in the third inning of teammate F√©lix Hern√°ndez's perfect game, the Mariners defeating the Tampa Bay Rays. In 2012, he won a Fielding Bible Award as the best fielding shortstop in MLB. In 2013, Ryan was replaced as the starting shortstop by Brad Miller mid-season, as Ryan had been hitting around the Mendoza Line. ===New York Yankees=== Ryan's pitching debut On September 10, 2013, Ryan was traded to the New York Yankees for a player to be named later. On November 18, 2013, he agreed to a new contract with the New York Yankees, and on November 27, 2013, he finalized a deal worth $5 million over two years. His deal also includes a club option for $2 million, and a player option for $1 million, for the 2016 season. Ryan opened the 2014 season on the 15-day disabled list with back issues. As of May 2, 2014, he was on the 15-day disabled list with cervical spine nerve damage and was playing rehab games at AA Trenton. Ryan played only 49 games in 2014, batting .167 with 8 RBI. Ryan began the 2015 season on the 15-day disabled list due to a right calf strain. On August 25, 2015, Ryan made his MLB pitching debut in the eighth inning against the Houston Astros, throwing two scoreless innings. Ryan exercised his $1 million player option for the 2016 season. ===Chicago Cubs=== On December 17, 2015, the Yankees officially announced that Ryan had been the player to be named later in their trade with the Chicago Cubs for shortstop Starlin Castro.Hatch, Ryan \\"Yankees officially send infielder Brendan Ryan to Chicago Cubs, \\"NJ.com\\" December 17, 2015 He was released by the Cubs on December 23, 2015. ===Washington Nationals=== On February 2, 2016, the Washington Nationals signed Ryan to a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training.

It is located in the administrative district of Bijnor. ==Historical background== Ratangarh was founded in the early nineteenth century by Rao Zokha Singh Tyagi Atri . He was a former commander (or Rao) of the northern branch of the Maratha Confederate Army, whose control ranged to the Tarai baselands of the Himalayas. After the Maratha decline that followed the Battle of Delhi, he became a mercenary-adventurer. For a period, he served as the Commanding General (Sipehsalar) of the principality of Sardhana near Meerut. He then moved on to found his own principality (or riyasat) with Ratangarh at its center. Ratangarh (literal meaning: Jewel Fort) was established near the site of an older defunct settlement called Azamgarh (literal meaning: Supreme Fort). Since the last days of the Mughal Empire, government revenue documents have interchangeably referred to the village as Ratangarh, Azamgarh-urf-Ratangarh (literally: Azamgarh-alias-Ratangarh), or Ratangarh-urf-Azamgarh. Along with the rest of Rohilkhand, Ratangarh was affected by the general rebellion against the British in 1857. Economic depression followed for a period. However, it was one of the first settlements in India to be electrified, in the mid-1920s, and this brought about a revival. A school was established in the 1930s. A largely feudal agrarian system (Zamindari) held sway until the 1940s, after which a combination of legislature-driven Land Reform (such as the Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition Act, 1950 and the Uttar Pradesh Imposition of Ceiling on Land Holdings Act, 1960) and the Bhoodan movement brought about land redistribution, similar to other areas of Rohilkhand. At the independence and partition of India in 1947, the region as a whole witnessed an influx of Punjabis and Sikhs from the areas that now comprise Pakistan, though Ratangarh itself was relatively unaffected by this demographic change. In a notable event, on 6 April 1885, a meteorite was sighted over Ratangarh and fell close to the nearby settlement of Chandpur. The Shiv Bhavan Haveli in Ratangarh, built by Shiv Dayal Singh and Shiv Nath Singh, two grandsons of Rao Zokha Singh The cement-renovated village temple, originally built by Zokha Singh Haveli built by Shiv Dayal Singh (grandson of Rao Zokha Singh) ==Demography and culture== The village reflects the broader cultural background of the region of Rohilkhand, flavored by its proximity to the hill state of Uttarakhand. The language is the Western Hindi/Urdu dialect of Khari Boli, and is extensively Persianized in its vocabulary. The population is largely Hindu with a significant Muslim (both Shia and Sunni) minority. Local castes in this region of Rohilkhand include Tyagi, Ahirs/Yadavs, Jat, Rajput, Rohilla Pashtun (after whom the region is named), and Dalit. As in Uttarakhand and Nepal, the most important festival is Dashehra, commemorating the victory of Lord Ram over Ravan. A traditional folk-play (Ramlila), that dramatizes the Ramayan, is enacted over several consecutive nights, culminating on Dashehra. Though the play has Hindu religious significance, both the Hindu and Muslim communities participate in the festivities. Other important festivals include Holi, Eid-ul-Fitr, Eid-ul- Azha, Moharram and Diwali. ==Ecology== For the first century after its foundation, the environs of the village were heavily forested, and contiguous with the Tarai forests that hemmed the Himalayan foothills. Wildlife (chital deer, monkey, hare, porcupine, wolf and leopard) was widespread. Pressures stemming from the rapid population increase in the twentieth century resulted in mass-deforestation. These species are now confined to the nearby Jim Corbett National Park, with only monkeys and peacocks remaining in numbers in the village area. Snakes and hares continue to be common in the farm fields. ==Geography and climate== Ratangarh is located at latitude 29¬∞6'10\\"N and longitude 78¬∞21'50\\"E, along the highway that connects Fina (often anglicized as \\"Pheona\\") with Noorpur. The main village has a triangular shape with the highway, a string of ponds and a rural road as the three edges. The village is at an approximate altitude of 750 feet, and the terrain is largely flat. The temperature ranges from a daytime maximum of about 42¬∞C (108¬∞F) at the height of summer to a nighttime minimum of about 0¬∞C (32¬∞F) during the coldest period of winter. There are five seasons - hot and dry summer, monsoonal rains, mild autumn, moderate winter and mild spring. Midwinter frost is common, and often damaging to crops and fruit. As with many areas of northwestern India, northern Pakistan and western Nepal, the region is part of the non-monsoonal Western Disturbance rain system that provides winter rains necessary for the wheat crop. While it gets relatively hot in the summer, the 1886 edition of the Imperial Gazetteer of India compared the district's climate favorably to that of both the Tarai and areas further south: \\"Its proximity to the Himalayas renders the climate of Bijnor cool and pleasant, while the abundance of drainage channels prevents the District from being as unhealthy as other tracts near the foot of the mountains.\\" ==Economy== The economy is primarily based on agriculture (grains and fruit). Staples (mainly wheat, with some jau or barley and bajra or pearl millet) are produced. There are also many sugarcane fields, and fruit orchards (mango, mulberry, pomegranate, jamun or rose apple and shareefa or sugar apple). Limited quantities of anjeer or fig and ber or Indian jujube are also produced. In non-agricultural activity, there are some retail outlets, doctors, flour mills and teachers. Land reform and urban-bound migration and divestment by the former zamindars has resulted in some economic equalization, with a more evenly distributed pattern of land ownership, including by Dalits. Many youth from all segments of the population seek careers in the small towns nearby (Fina, Chandpur, Sherkot, Bijnor) or the larger towns further afield (Meerut, Hardwar, Delhi). == Notable residents == * Deep Tyagi (1928‚Äì1969), Assistant Commissioner for the Indian Family Planning program until 1969 * Mahavir Tyagi (1899-1980), Indian independence activist and parliamentarian *Munishwar Dayal Tyagi (1935-2003), joint director All India Radio Durgesh Tyagi One of the Royal personality belonging to royal lineage of Seohara Rihasat. *Avnish Tyagi (1968- present) , CPRI, shimla *Sunil Tyagi, a lawyer based in Delhi and founder partner of law firm Zeus Law www.zeus.firm.in (1967 - present).

The Pilgrim's Progress: The Third Part is a pseudepigraphic sequel to John Bunyan's 1678 novel The Pilgrim's Progress, written by an anonymous author. It was published with Bunyan's work in editions from 1693 to 1852 because it was believed to be written by Bunyan. New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia, vol. 2 sub loco : \\"A third part falsely attributed to Bunyan appeared in 1693, and was reprinted as late as 1852.\\" It presents the pilgrimage of Tender-Conscience and his companions. In the 19th century it was bowdlerized to omit a few sexual situations and allusions. ==Plot== Tender- Conscience, a native of the town of Vain Delights goes on the pilgrimage of Christian and Christiana to the Celestial City. He stops at some of the same places as they, but he encounters new places not visited by either Christian or Christiana and her party. All of the lands that are outside of the Wicket Gate and the area encompassed by the \\"walls and borders of that region, wherein lay the way to the heavenly country\\" are known as the \\"Valley of Destruction.\\" The time that Tender-Conscience begins his pilgrimage is a time of drought and heat, which is emblematic of a time of the persecution. Some of them are deterred in their progress, and return to their old homes in the Valley of Destruction during the night. Tender-Conscience has a difficult time crossing the Slough of Despond, and he does not get by it without being covered in mud from it. This mud has the effect of weakening the body and blinding his eyes, and Tender-Conscience gropes along until he is overshadowed by a bright cloud from which a hand appears that washes away the mud enabling Tender-Conscience to continue his journey with vigor. At the Wicket Gate Tender-Conscience does not escape the arrows shot against callers from Beelzebub's castle. These stick to his flesh and cause him to bleed profusely. Good-Will lets him in, and registers his name as a pilgrim. He gives Tender- Conscience a crutch that is made of wood from the Tree of Life (Lignum Vit√¶). This crutch stanches the bleeding and strengthens Tender-Conscience, who must bear with the arrows of Beelzebub until he reaches the House of the Interpreter. The Interpreter removes the arrows of Beelzebub from Tender- Conscience's body and lodges him for the night, showing him the same emblems and scenes enjoyed by Christian, Christiana, and their children and companions. The next day the Interpreter goes a little way with Tender- Conscience to where the King's Highway is walled on either side by the Wall of Salvation. Before they reach this wall they come to two farms on either side of the way. The farm on the right is well-cared for and the one on the left is not. The Interpreter tells Tender-Conscience that this provides an example to pilgrims that they should be like the caretaker of the farm on the right, who gradually improved his farm until it was in its present good condition. Tender-Conscience when parted from the Interpreter comes to the place where Christian found the cross and the sepulchre. On either side of the cross were now erected two houses as competing lodging places for pilgrims. On the right was the House of Mourning, and on the left was the House of Mirth. The House of Mirth is like an ale house with carousing men, but the House of Mourning is tended by pious women called \\"matrons.\\" Tender-Conscience decides to go to the House of Mourning despite the agitation induced in the men of the House of Mirth, who form a mob surrounding the House of Mourning demanding that Tender- Conscience be handed over to them. Three shining ones appear to Tender- Conscience promising to rescue him. The first shining one breathes on Tender- Conscience making him a new creature, the second clothes him in a white robe in place of his crimson clothes, and the third one gives him a sealed roll. With this change Tender-Conscience is able to get by unrecognized by the men from the House of Mirth and, so, go on his way. At the Hill Difficulty Tender- Conscience had the choice of the three ways: the one going up the hill also called \\"Difficulty,\\" the one going around the right hand of the hill called \\"Danger,\\" and the one going around the left side of the hill called \\"Destruction.\\" The broadness and pleasantness of the two byways induced Tender-Conscience to take the right-hand byway Danger. He thought that this way would also lead him to the top of the hill, but the growing denseness of the forest surrounding the way and the howlings of wild beasts that he heard induced him to go back to the foot of the hill. He then remembered the Bible passages that characterized the right way as narrow, so he chose to go up the hill by way of the steep and narrow path. Working his way up the hill, he is taken into two caves tended by Good-resolution and Contemplation where he is shown alabaster statues of famous pilgrims from the Bible who had gone on before, and an image of the Celestial City from a carved diamond. He is given respite and food by Good-Resolution, who warns him about places he should avoid staying while on the hill, and then he continues on the path, where he is stopped by a flattering man Spiritual-Pride, who convinces him there is a quicker way to his award, and leads him to a tower of Lofty-Thoughts with the plans of throwing Tender-Conscience off it, and dashing upon the bottom of the hill below. Tender remembers the warnings from Good-resolution, and he runs away, going on further he is stopped by an old man, Carnal-Security, who also convinces him to turn from the road, and he leads to a grand palace tended by the old man's wife Intemperance and his daughters Wantonness and Forgetfulness, where he is enticed to drink wine, dabbles with Wantonness and fall asleep in Forgetfulness' arms. Servants carry him inside and put him on a bed, and music begins to play with the intent of keeping him asleep until he dies, in which case his corpse would be carried down the hill to the path of Destruction, tossed into the fiery Lake of Destruction at the end of the road and die the 'second death'. Tender's crutch awakens him, and he gets up, and a storm and voices in his ear urge him to escape. On the way he runs into Gluttony who tries to get him stay for a feast that is prepared for him; avoiding that, he runs into the old man, who tries to convince him to stay, and if he will not to take another drink of the grapes before he leaves. Tender continues to run from the debate, and as he passes the fountain in the palace courtyard Wantonness, who is bathing in it, arises out naked and tries to seduce Tender. He narrowly avoids her grasp to escape, and run back to the main highway on the hill, and reaches the House Beautiful and is let in due to his pass. At the palace, Tender has long conversations with the virgins Discretion, Charity, Prudence, and Piety about how he escaped danger on the way up the hill, and then is taken to a feast, where he was served by others of the society (Temperance, Decency, Frugality and Bounty). He then has a conversation on how they came to that place themselves to take on their positions (they were devotees to the woman Religion who originally lived there, and promised to keep her rules), and the discussion of the role of healthy food and moderation in a Christian lifestyle. Tender sets off again, reaching the Valley of Humuliation, which has been covered with traps, nets and gins set up by the prince of the air, to stop high-minded pilgrims from proceeding further. Tender realizes he has to crawl under them in order to make any progress. He reaches a bridge, and is met with men in rowboats he thought might be murderers and robbers who infested the place. They began to shoot arrows at him, some of which missed him, and others which hit the shield he had received from House Beautiful. The men shooting at him included Worldly-honour, Arrogancy, Pride, Self-conceit, Vain-glory, and Shame. The last of these wounded him in his cheek, but barely drew blood. He continued on until he was past the bridge, and could again walk upright, and then praised the Lord. Tender finally reached the Valley of Shadow of Death... ==Context== The first part of the Pilgrim's Progress was very popular and elicited many anonymous second parts, few of which survive. Bunyan appeared to intend to write a third part but died before it could be completed.John Bunyan, The Pilgrim's Progress, W.R. Owens, ed., Oxford World's Classics (Oxford: University Press, 2003), 290: concluding his Second Part (1684) Bunyan writes, \\"Shall it be my Lot [sic] to go that way again, I may give those that desire it, an Account [sic] of what I here am silent about ....\\" This false third part was denounced as early as 1708 but remained quite popular. == References == Category:Christian novels Category:Sequel novels Category:1693 books Category:Works published anonymously ","title":"The Third Part of the Pilgrim's Progress"},{"id":"11642907","text":"The Liberty of the Rolls was a liberty, and civil parish from 1866, in the metropolitan area of London, England.

In 1889 the parish became part of the County of London and in 1900 it became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Westminster. It was abolished as a civil parish in 1922. However, its boundary could be readily seen as that area of Westminster which was the conjunction between the City of London and the Metropolitan Borough of Holborn (and later the London Borough of Camden).

By the strictest definition of a push, any contact from behind could be considered a push in the back, so the rule is usually enforced under only the following three circumstances: *If a player is bent over or on his knees, usually to win or protect the football, and an opponent knocks him over from behind. *If a player is lying face down on the ground, and an opponent falls onto his back, intentionally or unintentionally. The first circumstance often directly causes this second circumstance also. *If a tackler pursuing a ball-carrier uses one or both hands to push him from behind, causing him to be knocked off-balance as he attempts to dispose of the ball. A chaser often attempts this when he sees that the ball-carrier is about to kick the ball, and he is not close enough for a tackle. While the second and third circumstances are objectively applied by umpires, there is some subjectivity concerning the first interpretation. This arises because a bent-over player can be easily knocked over by incidental contact, forcing the umpire to make a judgement call regarding whether or not be considers the push to be sufficiently substantial to warrant penalty. Furthermore, it is not uncommon to see a player \\"take a dive\\" when he feels contact from behind, and umpires will not pay a free kick if they believe this to be the case. Nevertheless, it is relatively easy for fans to predict when these free kicks are going to be paid. Umpires are much less lenient if a player pushes another near the boundary line, due to the increased danger of crashing into the fence. ==Push in the Back: Marking Contest== One of the rules introduced by the VFL when they split from the VFA 1897 was the protection of a player who jumped for a mark from being put off balance by a player pushing him from behind. Pushes in the back are usually paid under the following three circumstances. *If a player pushes an opponent who has jumped to take a mark. *If a player on the lead is put off-balance by contact from behind with the arms of an opponent. *If a player in a pack or standing one-on-one marking contest is pushed out from behind, with the use of the hands. Free kicks under the first circumstance are easy to spot and are always paid, because a player already in the air cannot take a dive when pushed. However, under the other two circumstances, making judgement calls can be very difficult: it is easy for a player to take a dive in these circumstances; a sprinting player who is pushed may, in the act of trying to fall safely, take an unnatural leap which inadvertently makes the play look like a deliberate dive. As such, paying free kicks for pushes in the back in marking contests has always been contentious. However, these pushes are all caused by the arms. Players in marking contests are allowed to push their opponents out of the contest with their bodies, within reason; so, a subtle nudge with the shoulder would not be penalised, but a full-blooded bump in the back would be penalised. ===\\"Hands in the Back\\"=== In 2007, the AFL introduced an interpretation of the push in the back in marking contests, referred to as hands in the back. Under the rule, any player who placed his hands upon an opponent's back in a marking contest, whether there was a visible push or not, would be penalised. The rule was introduced after a 2006 season, in which there was an increasing tendency for forwards to play from behind in standing one-on-one marking contests, using their hands or bodies to nudge their opponents under the ball. It has become very difficult to adjudicate whether or not these nudges should be penalised, and there was a high degree of inconsistency. The AFL introduced the hands in the back rule to remove the subjectivity of these calls: in other words, a push with the body/forearms/closed hand was fine, but a push with open hands was not, regardless of the strength of the push. The rule has encountered a wide range of problems, with two particularly notable ones. *Players were being penalised because they were unable to use their hands to protect their positions, or even feel the position of their opponent while their eyes were on the ball. *Umpires were frequently caught in the wrong position to see hands in the back calls, so the application of the rule ended up just as inconsistent as the previous season. There were repeated calls for the rule to be repealed, even midseason, and there has been much criticism of the AFL for introducing the rule into the regular season without trialling it first in the NAB Cup. The AFL has stated that the rule would remain beyond 2007, and fans' angst decreased as the season progressed, and as players became used to working within the interpretation. The \\"hands in the back\\" interpretation was revised for the 2019 season. ==Signal== The umpire signals a push in the back by holding both hands open, palms facing outwards, in front of his chest, then making a pushing motion outwards with them. However, his action often reflects the push which is being penalised so a push in a marking contest will see the umpire push his hands outwards, while driving a player into the ground will see the arms pushed further downwards. ==Famous Push in the Back Incidents== In Round 9, 2007, with the scores tied between Essendon and Richmond and with about three minutes to go, Matthew Richardson nudged Mal Michael out of a standing one-on-one marking contest, using his right hand on Michael's right shoulder blade. Michael, who was in front but slightly out of position, jumped to take the mark exactly as he was pushed, but missed the ball; Richardson took the mark and played on immediately, kicking the ball between the goal posts from 50m out, but was penalised for a push in the back, plus fifty metres for wasting time. The Tigers lost the game, and widespread debate about the hands in the back interpretation followed in the next week. ==References== Category:Australian rules football terminology Category:Laws of Australian rules football Category:Banned sports tactics ","title":"Push in the back"},{"id":"11642960","text":"Alex Afonso (born 24 March 1981 in Ja√∫, S√£o Paulo) was a Brazilian football (soccer) forward. == Career == Alex Afonso previously played for Fortaleza, Portuguesa and Palmeiras.

The aircraft was ordered in 1938. It was intended that it would be powered by six Gnome et Rh√¥ne P.18 engines of each. A competitor for this specification was the SNCASE SE.200 Amphitrite. Construction of the aircraft was stopped due to the outbreak of World War II and was not resumed until after the signing of the Franco-German Armistice. The prototype, registered F-BAHG, first flew on 11 November 1942. It was subsequently confiscated by the Germans, and passed to the Luftwaffe, who allocated the codes 61+11. The aircraft was flown to Lake Constance, where it was destroyed in an attack by two Royal Air Force de Havilland Mosquito aircraft on 17 April 1944. SNCASE SE.200 Amphitrite 20+01 was destroyed in the same attack. ==History== The second aircraft, F-BANT, first flew on 7 March 1945. It was powered by six Wright Cyclone engines of each. Four aircraft were purchased by Air France, and entered service on the Biscarrosse-Port-√âtienne- Fort de France route in July 1947. The aircraft were withdrawn from service in August 1948 following the loss of F-BDRC. SEMAF operated two aircraft until 1950, when the survivor was withdrawn following the loss of F-BANU. The Soci√©t√© France Hydro operated one aircraft until it was lost on 10 September 1955. This was the last flying aircraft, with the remaining four survivors being scrapped. The Lat√©co√®re 631 was not a success due to it being unreliable and uneconomic to operate. ==Accidents and incidents== *On 31 October 1945, Air France's F-BANT was operating a flight from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Montevideo, Uruguay, and Buenos Aires, Argentina, when the propeller of No. 3 engine separated in flight, damaging No. 2 engine. A propeller blade sliced a hole in the cabin, killing two passengers. A fire started and an emergency landing was made in the Laguna de Rocha, Uruguay. The aircraft was subsequently repaired and returned to service., The celebrated poet, diplomat and composer Vinicius de Moraes and writer Rubem Braga, both Brazilians, were on board. *On 21 February 1948, Lat√©co√®re's F-BDRD crashed into the English Channel off Saint-Marcouf, Manche, in a snowstorm with the loss of all nineteen people on board.

Permanent European presence in the area came with the 1770 founding of the Presidio of Monterey and Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo by Gaspar de Portol√† and Jun√≠pero Serra, about sixty miles (100 km) to the south. Don Pedro Fages, the military governor at Monterey, passed through the area on his 1770 and 1772 expeditions to explore the East Bay and Sacramento River Delta.

He left the colonists at Monterey in 1776, and explored north with a small group. He selected the sites of the Presidio of San Francisco and Mission San Francisco de As√≠s in what is now San Francisco; on his way back to Monterey, he sited Mission Santa Clara de As√≠s and the pueblo San Jose in the Santa Clara Valley.

El Pueblo de San Jos√© de Guadalupe (The Town of Saint Joseph of Guadalupe) was founded by Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Moraga on November 29, 1777, the first pueblo-town not associated with a mission or a military post (presidio) in upper Las Californias. (Mission Santa Clara, the closest mission, was founded earlier in 1777, three miles (5 km) from the original pueblo site in neighboring Santa Clara. Mission San Jos√© was not founded until 1797, about 20 miles (30 km) north of San Jose in what is now Fremont.) The town was founded by the colonists led to California by Anza, as a farming community to provide food for the presidios of San Francisco and Monterey. In 1778, the pueblo had a population of 68.For the Revillagigedo Census of 1790, see The Census of 1790, California, California Spanish Genealogy. Retrieved on 2008-08-04.

In 1781, Governor Felipe de Neve issued the first rules regarding governance of secular pueblos (only two at that time; San Jos√© and Los √Ångeles), the \\"Regulations for the Government of the Province of the Californias\\" (Reglamento para el gobierno de la provincia de Californias)Spanish reprint plus English translation in Land of Sunshine magazine, volume 6, January 1897. Available online at Internet Archive (retrieved July 2018) In 1797, the pueblo was moved from its original location, near the present-day intersection of Guadalupe Parkway and Taylor Street, to a location in what is now Downtown San Jose, surrounding Pueblo Plaza (now Plaza de C√©sar Ch√°vez). In the ensuing years a number of Mexican Rancho Land Grants Land Grants were confirmed within the lands now considered San Jose. ===Alcaldes of San Jose=== List of Spanish and Mexican Alcaldes of San Jose:History of San Jose, California - Alley, Bowen & Co.

John Ross Key. During the Bear Flag Revolt, Captain Thomas Fallon led a small force from Santa Cruz and captured the pueblo without bloodshed on July 11, 1846. Fallon received an American flag from John D. Sloat, and raised it over the pueblo on July 14, as the California Republic agreed to join the United States following the start of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Fallon would later become the tenth mayor of San Jose. It's unclear whether or not Fallon ordered all townspeople of Spanish/Mexican origin out of San Jose, as some local historians claimed. During the California Gold Rush period, the New Almaden Quicksilver Mines just south of the city were the largest mercury mines in North America (mercury was used to help separate gold from ore). The cinnabar deposits were discovered in 1845 by a Mexican cavalry captain, Andres Castillero, when he recognized the red powder used by local Ohlone Indians to decorate the chapel at Mission Santa Clara. Mining operations began in 1847 at what was the first operating mine in the province, just in time for the Gold Rush. The importance of the mercury industry at the time explains why the local newspaper is named the Mercury News. On March 27, 1850, San Jose became the first incorporated city in the U.S. state of California; the first mayor was Josiah Belden. It also served as the state's first capital with the first and second sessions of the California Legislature, known as the Legislature of a Thousand Drinks, being held there in 1850 and 1851. The legislature was unhappy with the location, as no buildings suitable for a state government were available in the city, and took up State Senator Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo's offer to build a new capital on land he donated to the state in what is now Benicia. From 1858 to 1861, San Jose was a stop on the Butterfield Overland Mail stage line. ==Notable events== This replica of the Light Tower at the San Jose History Park stands only half of the original tower's 237 feet (72 m). In 1881, because of a forceful campaign by editor J.J. Owen of the San Jose Mercury, the city council authorized the construction of the San Jose Electric Light Tower, ostensibly to replace the gas streetlights that had illuminated downtown San Jose since 1861. It didn't provide sufficient illumination, and by 1884 was used only for ceremonial purposes. It collapsed during the great gale of 1915. In 1989, an informal \\"Court of Historical Inquiry\\" looked into the issue of whether the Eiffel Tower was a copyright infringement of the Electric Light Tower; the Justice ruled that it was not. In 1884, Sarah L. Winchester (n√©e Pardee), the widow of William Winchester and heiress to the empire that manufactured the Winchester rifle, moved from Connecticut to San Jose and began a construction project of such magnitude that it was to occupy the lives of carpenters and craftsmen until her death: the house was continually under construction for thirty-eight years. Before the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the Winchester Mystery House reached a height of 7 stories; today it stands three stories with approximately 160 rooms. Many visitors to the house claim to have felt the presence of ghosts, while others claim there is no detectable presence. In 1909, Dr. Charles Herrold began experimental radio broadcasts in downtown San Jose. His station was commercially licensed in 1921 as KQW, then moved to San Francisco, where it became KCBS in 1949. The 1933 kidnapping and murder of Brooke Hart resulted in mob violence in San Jose. About 10,000 residents (approximately 1/6 of the city's population at the time) stormed the jail and lynched the two men who had confessed to the killing. The case drew international attention to San Jose, for the kidnapping, lynching, and for the praise that Governor, James Rolph directed to those who participated. It is also notable as the last public lynching in California's history. Photos of the lynchings were even used as Nazi propaganda, to demonstrate that Americans were supportive of their Jewish population (the Harts were Jews). During World War II, San Jose experienced racial tension in neighborhoods where large populations of African Americans, Mexican Americans and Japanese Americans lived on the city's western and eastern edges. Most of the Japanese community were removed and interned in war detention camps in the course of the war. Anti-Mexican violence based on the earlier Zoot Suit Riots in Los Angeles took place in the summer of 1943 in San Jose. After large numbers of blacks from the Southern states during the Second Great Migration moved to San Jose's growing wartime manufacturing industry, locals were divided, but grew to accept the thousands of new black residents. San Jose was a conservative Republican bastion until the 1980s, when continued population growth yielded a political shift away from the more conservative agricultural heritage still shared by most of rural California to a more urban outlook, mirroring the voting patterns of the more densely populated urban centers of Los Angeles and San Francisco. San Jose now has a Democratic majority in party registration. In December 2014, the city demolished the \\"Jungle\\", the nation's largest homeless person encampment. On September 15, 2020, two men were killed (ages 21 and 22), and four other people were wounded in a drive-by shooting at the 600 block of South Eighth Street, two blocks from San Jose State University. The group of people were fired on from a passing muscle car as they were mourning a man who died in a car accident. The case remains unsolved. According to authorities, it is not determined if it had gang motivations. ==Earthquakes== San Jose lies near several active faults, including the Monte Vista Fault, Hayward Fault Zone, Calaveras Fault, Silver Creek Fault, and the San Andreas Fault. Significant events occurred in 1856, 1858, 1864, 1865, 1868, 1881, 1891, 1897, 1898, 1906, 1957, 1989, and 2007. The 1906 San Francisco earthquake, with its epicenter slightly off the coast of San Francisco near Golden Gate Park,Officials unmoved by quake notoriety Plan to note change of 1906 epicenter lacking support devastated many buildings in San Jose. The city was still primarily rural and the population was much smaller than San Francisco. Houses and businesses were not built as close as they were on the peninsula, and this provided less opportunity for major fires. The all-brick Agnews Asylum (later Agnews State Hospital) was destroyed, killing over 100 people as the walls and roof collapsed. The 8-year-old San Jose High School's three-story stone and brick structure also collapsed, and many other buildings were severely damaged. There have been many other moderate earthquakes that have been felt in San Jose that caused little or no damage. Most damage from earthquakes are quickly repaired, but some effects may still be seen in the form of cracked sidewalks and raised curbs. ==Transition from agriculture to technology== For nearly two centuries a farming community, San Jose produced a significant amount of fruits and vegetables until the 1960s, and many past and current names of teams, streets, buildings, and so on reflect its agricultural beginnings. Prunes, grapes, and apricots were some of the major crops. In 1922, the first commercial farming of broccoli in the U.S. was started in San Jose, by brothers Stephano and Andrea D'Arrigo. The Del Monte cannery in Midtown was the largest employer in the city for many years.Flashback: A short political history of San Jose There were so many orchards in the Santa Clara Valley, which emitted a delightful smell of ripening fruit, that a common nickname for the Santa Clara Valley was The Valley of Heart's Delight. Food Machinery Corporation (FMC) was founded in nearby Los Gatos as the Bean Spray Pump Company in 1884 and moved to San Jose in 1903. In 1941 the company received an order from the United States War Department for one thousand LVTs, bringing defense contracts to San Jose for the first time. After World War II, FMC continued as a defense contractor, with the San Jose facilities designing and manufacturing military platforms such as the M113 Armored Personnel Carrier, the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, and various subsystems of the M1 Abrams. FMC's military business would later be spun off into United Defense. IBM established their west coast headquarters in San Jose in 1943. In 1952 they opened a research and development facility in downtown, where Reynold Johnson and his team invented RAMAC (Random Access Method of Accounting and Control). In 1956 IBM opened its Cottle Road manufacturing facility in the Santa Teresa neighborhood, where disc drives were invented in 1962. It was sold to Hitachi, who in turn sold the property to a developer. IBM still rents two buildings on the campus. IBM moved the research and development operation out of downtown, opening the Silicon Valley Laboratories in the Coyote Valley in 1976, and the Almaden Research Center in 1986.Winslow, Ward (editor); The Making of Silicon Valley: a One Hundred Year Renaissance; 1995; By the 1970s, urban sprawl had eliminated most of the orchards, and the Valley of Heart's Delight had been transformed into Silicon Valley. ==Growth== Circle of Palms in downtown San Jose today marks the historical site of California's first state capitol Tech Museum towards Mount Hamilton; hills in the background show their winter green color. A. P. Hamann (nicknamed \\"Dutch\\") became city manager in 1950. At the time, the city had a population of 95,280 and a total area of only . Hamann instituted an aggressive growth program by annexation of adjacent areas, such as Alviso and Cambrian Park, and a program of dispersed urbanization, called urban sprawl. Hamann also spent significant time on the East Coast, selling San Jose as an ideal place for businesses to expand into. Hamann's efforts resulted in an annual population growth rate of over eight percent. When Hamann left office in 1969, San Jose had grown to 495,000 residents and 136 square miles. The costs of uncontrolled growth‚Äîhigh municipal debt load, deteriorating public services (including double sessions at public schools and overtaxed fire and police services), and environmental degradation‚Äîtriggered a populist revolt against Hamann's growth machine. In the late 1960s, several anti-growth candidates were elected to the City Council. Seeing the writing on the wall, Hamann retired. In 1971, Norman Mineta‚Äîwho had been appointed to fill a vacant City Council seat by pro-growth Mayor Ron James but who proved to be an independent‚Äîwas elected Mayor. During the early 1970s, a feminist-environmentalist electoral alliance consolidated a liberal, anti-growth majority on the City Council. In a final coup against the growth machine, voters elected Janet Gray Hayes as mayor in 1974. Since then, San Jose has been governed by a liberal-managerial regime focused on growth management, neighborhood services, and fiscal solvency. Subsequently, the city adopted a general plan that established an \\"urban service area\\" (also known as \\"urban growth boundary\\") within existing city boundaries, limited development in the eastern foothills, and deferred growth in Coyote Valley to the south. To the west, communities such as Campbell and Cupertino had incorporated as cities to avoid being annexed to San Jose, while expansion to the north was impossible because of San Francisco Bay. The city also adopted more rigorous planning practices and a \\"pay-as-you-grow\\" system of paying for new infrastructure. However, San Jose's new policies did not stop or even significantly restrict growth; rather, they directed growth towards incorporated areas and mitigated the costs of growth. The city's housing stock and population steadily increased during subsequent decades. Indeed, continued growth has created enormous challenges for the city and region. With the boom of the electronics industry, specifically personal computers and integrated circuits, the population of San Jose and Silicon Valley continued to grow rapidly. By 1980, the city's population was 629,442; it reached 782,248 by 1990; and at which point Santa Clara County as a whole had grown to 1,682,585 residents.For complete statistics regarding the population growth of San Jose please refer to the Historical Census Populations of California State, Counties, Cities, Places, and Towns, 1850‚Äì2000 Because of rapid job growth and in-migration, housing costs in San Jose and the rest of the Bay Area rose faster than the national average in the 1980s and 1990s; between 1976 and 2001, San Jose's housing costs increased by 936%, the fastest growth in the nation over that time. The average 2003 home price in Santa Clara County was approximately 330% of the national average.San Jose case study, part one: the urban-growth boundary In August 1989, San Francisco was surpassed for the first time in population by San Jose, and San Francisco is now the second largest city in the San Francisco Bay Area in population after San Jose. In the early 1990s, San Jose and Santa Clara valley had received a heavy dose of negative press as a poorly planned and troubled suburban community, said the November 25, 1991 Time Magazine article: How gray is my valley part of the special issue on California: The Endangered Dream. In response, the city has tried to direct growth inward and densify already urbanized areas. In 1994, the city council approved another general plan with the original 1974 urban growth boundaries intact. In 1998, city voters rejected a ballot measure that would have eased development restrictions in the foothills. Sixty percent of the housing built in San Jose since 1980 and over three-quarters of the housing built since 2000 have been multifamily structures, reflecting an orientation towards Smart Growth planning principles.City of San Jose Planning: Building Permit History == See also == *San Jose, California **List of city managers of San Jose, California **List of streets in San Jose, California, with name origins **Mayor of San Jose **Timeline of San Jose, California *Las Californias **Alta California **List of ranchos of California **Population of Native California *History of California **History of California before 1900 ==References== ==Bibliography== ==External links== *History San Jose website, for History San Jose, the largest historical organization for the city *\\"Happy Birthday San Jos√©\\", an article about the celebration of the founding of the city on the California Frontier Project website.

It is named after its street address along Grand Avenue in the downtown area of the city between 8th and 9th Streets, with High Street the northern border. Completed in 1991 and standing , it is the tallest building in the state of Iowa. The building is primarily office space, largely occupied by its owner, Principal Financial Group. The lower three floors contain retail and restaurant space, including the 801 Chophouse, and provide a connection to Des Moines' skywalk system. Other tenants include the Hutchison Dental, law firms of McKee, Voorhees, & Sease; Bradshaw, Fowler, Proctor & Fairgrave; and Faegre Baker Daniels. 801 Grand's roof is covered with copper sheeting that was designed to form a green coating of verdigris over time, much like the Statue of Liberty. However, unlike New York City, the air salt content in Des Moines was so low that the desired oxidation process failed. The copper turned a dark brown instead. Discussions on possible removal of the top layer of copper to allow crews to restart the oxidation process to create verdigris resulted in the decision to leave the roof as it is. ==See also== * Des Moines, Iowa * List of tallest buildings in Iowa * List of tallest buildings by U.S. state ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:Office buildings completed in 1991 Category:Skyscraper office buildings in Des Moines, Iowa Category:Financial services company headquarters in the United States Category:Modernist architecture in Iowa Category:1991 establishments in Iowa Category:HOK (firm) buildings ","title":"801 Grand"},{"id":"11643200","text":"Khakhara or Khkhra is a village in Sahabganj, Chandauli, Uttar Pradesh, India.\\"Details of UTTAR PRADESH till Village Panchayat Tier.\\" Admin Reports of NPP.

By far the most common solvent for perfume oil dilution is ethanol or a mixture of ethanol and water.

Colognes have about 3‚Äì5% perfume oil mixed with 80‚Äì90% alcohol with about 5 to 15 percent water in the mix. Originally, eau de cologne was a mixture of citrus oils from such fruits as lemons, oranges, tangerines, limes, and grapefruits.

Employers can offer a one-time signing bonus or promise a specific timeline for raises to salaries. ==== Building trust between employee and new hire ==== Golden Hello build the foundation for a positive relationship between an employer and a new employee. The study ‚ÄúCan a Signing Bonus Motivate Effort?‚Äù indicated that trust is built between employers and new hire when employers offer signing bonuses. This is also incentive for new employers to work harder. === Golden Hello for academies === In the UK, a golden hello is financial incentive, not for executives, but for attracting graduates in STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) into teaching in an maintained secondary school.

It defines the posterior pole during early embryogenesis. Its two isoforms, short and long, play different roles in Drosophila embryonic development. == Translational-level regulation == oskar is translationally repressed prior to reaching the posterior pole of the oocyte by Bruno, which binds to three bruno response elements (BREs) on the 3' end of the transcribed oskar mRNA. The Bruno inhibitor has two distinct modes of action: recruiting the Cup eIF4E binding protein, which is also required for oskar mRNA localization due to interactions with the Barentsz microtubule-linked transporter, and promoting oligomerization of oskar mRNA. Oskar mRNA harbours a stem-loop structure in the 3‚ÄôUTR, called the oocyte entry signal (OES), that promotes dynein-based mRNA accumulation in the oocyte. == P granule formation == oskar plays role in recruiting other germ line genes to the germ plasm for PGC (primordial germ cell) specification. oskar mRNA locates to the posterior end of an oocyte and, once translated, the short isoform of oskar (Short oskar) recruits germ plasm components such as the protein Vasa and the RNA-binding proteins of the Piwi family, among many others. The long isoform of oskar (Long oskar) has been implicated in creating an actin network on the posterior pole end. A second role has been discovered that relates to the formation of P granules, or germ granules. These ribonucleoprotein granules are found in every species' germ line cells. Although they are mobile, they typically localize to the nuclei and sit on nuclear pores. This positioning makes them ideal mRNA regulators, as the mRNA must pass through to exit the nucleus. Translational regulation also makes sense due to the granules' close association with ribosomes. These P granules are phase-transition entities, which means that they can display both liquid-like and hydrogel-like properties. This allows them to be very versatile structures, able to dissolve, condense, and exchange their protein content with their environment at will. Recent studies have shown that the short isoform of oskar has another function as the nucleator of nuclear germ granules. oskar recruits vasa to these round granules, then promotes the localization to the nucleus. oskar was ablated to explore the function of these nuclear germ granules. The results showed that the division of PGCs was compromised without oskar, meaning that the P granules play a role in the cell cycle of germ cells. It is still unclear exactly how the nuclear granules interact with certain factors and what factors (proteins, regulators, inhibitors) they interact with in order to regulate cell division. == Domain families == oskar contains two RNA-binding protein domains: the OSK RNA- binding domain and the OST-HTH/LOTUS domain. The former is structurally related to SGNH hydrolases but lack the active site residues. The latter is a winged helix-turn-helix domain also found in human TDRD5/TDRD7. The OST-HTH domain in oskar is mainly responsible for recruiting the Vasa helicase by binding to it. == References == Category:Developmental genes and proteins Category:Drosophila melanogaster genes ","title":"Oskar"},{"id":"11643244","text":"Dhaka Shishu (Children) Hospital is a children's hospital in Bangladesh, located in the capital city of Dhaka. ==History== The hospital was established in 1972, immediately following independence.

Some historians consider it a literary forgery, and others consider it true. ==Creation== According to historians who consider the document to be real, the need for it would have been the result of a meeting of Moreno, Manuel Belgrano, and Juan Jos√© Castelli, the latter two requesting Moreno to write it; by August 31, 1810, he proposed it to the whole Junta. ==Content== ===Actions against royalists=== Mariano Moreno did not consider necessary to take any measures against absolutist monarchy itself. He thought that, in the wake of the events of the Peninsular War, the House of Bourbon had destroyed itself, and it would be enough to simply let it stay that way.\\"The house of the Bourbons was in the ground, and none of their coward friends showed up in time to lend a hand; it was't needed but to let it sleep and forget it.\\" (Moreno) - Operations Plan, p. 278 The document states the need to defeat the royalist forces and therefore proposes many possible actions similar to those employed by Jacobins during the Reign of Terror of the French Revolution. It rejected the use of political moderation, considering that it would be dangerous during revolutionary times.\\"Moderation out of time is no sanity, nor is a truth; on the contrary, it is a weakness to adopt a system whose circumstances do not require; never in any time of revolution was moderation or tolerance adopted by governors, the mere thought of a man who opposes the new system is a crime because of the influence and harm he may cause with his example, and punishment is unavoidable\\" (Moreno) - Operations plan, p. 276 It compared the South American revolution, still in its early steps, with the French and North American\\"My Nation, how many mutations you must suffer! Where are, noble and great Washington, the lessons of your politics? Where the laborious rules of the arquitecture of your great work? Your principles and your regime could be capable to guide us, giving us your lights, to fill the goals we have proposed to ourselves\\" (Moreno) - Operations plan, p. 273-274 ones, and even the revolution in Spain itself, pointing that none of those relied solely in conspirations or secret meetings.\\"Let's talk with frankness: so far we have only seen the speculation of conspiracies, and as such when we try to approach practical matters we are deterred. Well, no: these are not the lessons taught by the masters of the great revolutions; fix your view over the annals of the histories of the North, of the France, etc; and even Spain itself, and you shall see the plots and political cunning, aiming only to get by that way the goals they had proposed themselves (Moreno) - Operations plan, p. 281-282 The document divides people into three main groups, loyals, open enemies and neutrals.\\"In every revolution there are three types of individuals: first, loyals of the defended system; second, declared and known enemies; third, the silent spectators\\" (Moreno) - Operations plan, p. 283 It proposes to give privileges to the loyals, and fill the state offices with them,\\"All true patriots, whose conduct is satisfactory and had given notable proof of it, if they made a crime which does not concern the system, they must receive consideration and kindness; in a word, during revolutionary times no crime shall be punished save for infidelity and rebellion\\" (Moreno) - Operations plan, p. 283-284 but using circumstantial honours rather than rushed promotions.\\"In all medium jobs, after they are filled with them (N: loyals to the government) the run of their promotions must be very slow, because if we understand that the establishment of our system is a work of some years, everybody would aspire to be generals or magistrates, and to skip this we should establish rewards like shields, columns, pyramids, etc. [...] How would it harm the nation if a citizen has an arm full of shields, or has his name written at some public place, if that doesn't generate a debt for the public treasury? (Moreno) - Operations plan, p. 284 Moreno made an exception with moderated supporters driven by a desire of honours or recognition, he considered that they may be useful at a later stage of the revolution, but not at the early ones.\\"There are good men (if ambitious men can truly be so) who really loathe the ideas of monarchic governments, whose style feels terrible to them, and who would want without bloodspill, to sanction the true liberties of the nation, they do not share the abominable principles of the turbulents, but as they have talent, some political virtues and good credit, may be more fearable; without aggravating them (because some day they may be useful) they must be set apart; because, some for thrive, others to stay, some for taste of plotting, some for ambition of honours, and the small number for desire of glory, or to be more exact, for vanity of renown, are not appropriate by their character to make the great work of the american freedom, in the first steps of its infancy\\" (Moreno) - Operations plan, p. 278-279 Peninsulars, on the other hand, should be carefully monitored, and punished at the slightest proof of action against the Junta; and executed when they were rich or influential.\\"With the seconds (N: the enemies of the government) at the slightest semiproof of deeds, words, etc. against the cause, they shall be punished with capital punishment, specially when they convene with the circumstances of being people of skill, wealth, personality and some opinion, but when they do not convene in such a man, it may be possible to have consideration and moderate the punishment, but never having any trusting on them\\" (Mariano Moreno) - Operations plan, p. 284-285 For this end, the Junta would need to create an espionage network.\\"The government must [...] keep some spies, not of the first or second skill level, but of a known loyalty to the cause, secretly instructed to sneak into the most dubious people, talk with them and manifesting themselves in an opposing manner to the real cause they defend, to discover thus the thoughts of our enemies or any plot they may try\\" (Moreno) - Operations plan, p. 285 Top military or political personnel, such as enemy governors or generals, should be executed after their capture.\\"All exterior and interior enemies that fall into the hands of the Nation, such as governors, captain generals, field marshals, colonels, brigadiers [...] must be beheaded; first, because they are some of the main bulwarks we must break that would oppose us; second, because the example of this punishments shall be a wall of our defense, and we would attract public reputation; and third, because the nation is worthy of the sacrifice of these victims as a triumph of outmost reputation and importance\\" (Moreno) - Operations plan, p. 286 This policy towards peninsulars is coherent with the actions taken against the Liniers counter-revolution, and similar to the one employed by Sim√≥n Bol√≠var in the North shortly after. In respect to the press, the document proposed to give broad press coverage to the news that may benefit the government and conceal the ones that may harm it.\\"...it must be arranged that each week when the public must receive adverse news the number of printed Gazetas should be really scarce, as with a short number, they may spread less, both inside our provinces an outside of them\\" (Moreno) - Operations plan, p. 287 Moreno thought that a blockade against Montevideo would not be effective, for the Montevidean naval supremacy over Buenos Aires.\\"...we do not have a capable and superior navy than that of the Montevideo plaza, that a blockade by sea and land would not need more plans and designs for its defeat, but as luck is not complete, it is precise to seek other ways\\" (Moreno) - Operations plan, p. 291 He proposed instead to weaken Montevideo by getting the support of the nearby smaller cities and villages.\\"The attention must not be aimed first to the plaza of Montevideo, but to the villages of the countryside, as it is easier to dissuade and persuade ten than hundred, and defeat 20.000 lined soldiers than 10.000 as a mob\\" (Moreno) - Operations plan, p. 287 Moreno thought as well that Jos√© Gervasio Artigas and Jos√© Rondeau would be invaluable allies, and that Buenos Aires should use any resource at its disposal to have them join the fight against absolutism.\\"...it would be advisable to draw two men by any interest or promise, because of their knowledge, which we know is great in the countryside, as for their skill, opinion, concept and respect, as it is the captain of dragoons don Jos√© Rondeauand the captain of blandengues don Jos√© Artigas\\" (Moreno) - Operations plan, p. 294-295 Once the city was captured, he proposed to confiscate the ships and properties of royalists.\\"Then, in the act of rendition of the plaza of Montevideo, all ships, big and small [...] shall be confiscated for the benefit of the state, including as well every Spanish ship\\" (Moreno) - Operations plan, p. 299 All the people that could not prove loyalty to the cause would be banished to the Malvinas or Carmen de Patagones, or drafted in the army for 15 years; the old people would be only banished, but spared from prison or hard works. He also noticed the internal conflicts at Chile and Paraguay, and urged to provide support to the local patriots against the local royalists. The text was abolitionist as well. It proposed to end the slave trade, and emancipate the slaves with peninsular masters. To avoid conflicts with patriots owners of slaves, those slaves would be drafted into the militias, with the option of becoming free negros after their military service.\\"The rules to avoid the introduction of slavery must be arranged as well as freedom [...] but always protecting those who join our flags, emancipating some, if their masters belong to the other party, and the others, rescued with part of the wages they would get in the militia, so not to displease their masters, as it is evident that touching a man's interest not only patriotism tremble but also good faith [...] (Moreno) - Operations plan, p. 289-290 ===International relations=== On the level of international relations, Mariano Moreno rejected the slavery in Brazil, a neighbour Portuguese colony. He proposed to distribute large numbers of Gazeta de Buenos Ayres newspapers, filled with libertarian ideas and translated to Portuguese language, and provide military support to the slaves that may riot. He considered a great menace the risk of a complete Spanish defeat in the Peninsular War or a restoration of absolutism and regarded Britain as a potential ally against such menaces. During a conflict, Britain would be able to provide them with weapons, and other goods that were not produced locally. Critics of Moreno consider him an Anglophile because of this proposal, but the same documents warns later against the risk of Britain having too much influence in the economic life of the country. He also criticized the relation between Britain and Portugal, considering that Portugal was subject to a \\"shameful slavery\\" to Britain, and that the British influence in Brazil was so high that the Portuguese colonies may eventually become British ones. Moreno held the same ideas about being friendly but cautious with Britain in the pages of the Gazeta newspaper. In respect to the relation with Spain, Moreno thought that a premature declaration of independence would not be appropriate, and advised to wait for the revolution to strengthen and to see the final outcome of the Peninsular War.\\"...it wouldn't be advisable a contrary and so out of time declaration, until we radically establish our principles over solid bases and see the luck of the events in Spain\\" - (Moreno) Operations plan, p. 290-291 He thought that it was advisable to proclaim loyalty to Ferdinand VII at every document, as it would ease the relation with foreign countries, and Spain itself would doubt which party, the patriots or the royalists, was more loyal to the king.\\"Ultimately, the mistery of Ferdinand is a circumstance of utmost importance to give all prominence, both in mouth as in official papers and decrees, because it is the most superb aid to our cause, because even when our works and conduct may deny this semblance before other provinces, it is not the case with foreign courts [...] as with the Spain, which we may make doubt which party is the real royalist...\\" - (Moreno) Operations plan, p. 290 ===Economy=== In the economic field, it addressed the lack of a bourgeoisie that may turn the political changes into economic development and proposed to overcome such lack with an active state intervention. Mariano Moreno proposed that the state destined 200 or 300 million to create factories, manufacturing, arts, agriculture, navigation, and other critical areas. There would be no risk of bankruptcy because the state would manage those businesses. With the money generated from those activities, the state would then seek seeds and tools, and ultimately allow the continent to be economically self-reliant. The initial money that the state would need to become such an active economic force would come from the mines in Potosi, where the slavers had nearly 500 or 600 million. Moreno proposed simply to confiscate it, and nationalize the mines. He reasoned that five or six thousand people would be harmed by such action, but eighty or a hundred thousands would be benefited. The state would not manage those areas indefinitely; Moreno proposed that this should be done only until there was a strong economic activity in each area, and then the state would just watch the activities, making sure that they followed laws enacted for the common good of society. The early 19th-century liberalism did not promote confiscation among their common proposals, but a similar antecedent of this proposal was the Conspiracy of the Equals, promoted by Fran√ßois-No√´l Babeuf during the French Revolution. Moreno thought that state-sized fortunes managed by a few individuals were detrimental to civil society, and those individuals would tend to take up the roles of the state in their own benefit, but without fixing the problems of society at large. The document proposed as well to avoid exporting money, and to include high tariffs to the import of luxury goods. This is often seen as a contradiction with The Representation of the Hacendados, but both ones request different things. The Representation opposed the absolute prohibition to trade with Britain, which is not the same as allowing it but following a protectionist policy. As secretary, Moreno reduced the tariffs over national exports, but kept high ones for imports, which would only be removed during the First Triumvirate, years later. ==Controversy== The first copy of the Plan was found in the Archives of Indias of Sevilla (Spain) by Eduardo Madero, who was studying the history of the port of Buenos Aires. He sent it to Argentina. Bartolom√© Mitre received it but lost it, in unknown circumstances. Norberto Pi√±eiro found a second one, but instead of sending it back to Buenos Aires, he published it. Other historians would later draw relations between the Plan and the government acts of the Junta such as the execution of Santiago de Liniers after the Liniers Counter-revolution or the work of Castelli at the Upper Peru. Historian Paul Groussac and later Ricardo Levene accused the document of being a forgery, written by an enemy of the revolution in order to discredit it. Levene also insisted in that the copy found was not handwritten by Mariano Moreno but by Andr√©s √Ålvarez de Toledo. Supporters of the document accepted it, stating that the document found was not the original but a copy, and that it was not something unexpected that the copy was handwritten by another man. The original document, handwritten by Mariano Moreno, has not been discovered yet. No other texts of the time written by the members of the Junta, either public or private, make mention to the Operations plan. However, Enrique Ruiz Gui√±az√∫ published in 1952 a pair of letters of Carlota Joaquina and Ferdinand VII, where both members of the house of Bourbon make direct reference to the plan written by Moreno. Carlota also cited in it parts of such document, which are coherent with the copy found by Pi√±eiro. Later, some authors question the authorship of Moreno, and stated that some expressions or redaction styles may suggest it to be the work of Manuel Belgrano or Hip√≥lito Vieytes. Supporters of the document like Norberto Galasso accept a middle ground option: the document may be the result of a collaborative writing instead that of a single author, even if Moreno wrote most of it. ==See also== * Mariano Moreno * Primera Junta * May Revolution ==References== * * ==References== ==External links== * Plan revolucionario de operaciones Category:Argentine War of Independence Category:Conspiracy theories Category:Argentine books Category:1810 non-fiction books Category:May Revolution Category:Political books ","title":"Operations plan"},{"id":"11643354","text":"Irving Kayton, Esq. is the founder of the Patent Resources Group, Inc.

He is currently Professor of English at the University of Sydney. == Career == Frow‚Äôs research is situated at the boundary between the humanities and the social sciences, and ranges from quite technical work in literary theory and discourse analysis through to empirical and statistically-based sociology. His doctoral work and his first book, \\"Marxism and Literary History\\" (1986), sought to rework Marxist theory for a non-determinist account of literary systems. Drawing on Althusser and Foucault, as well as on Russian Formalist theory, German reception aesthetics, a critical engagement with post-structuralist theory, and on a broad range of literary texts, it theorized the relation between discourse and power, the relational structure of literary texts and systems, and the dynamics of literary change.Jane A. Nicholson, Review of \\"Marxism and Literary History\\", \\"SubStance\\" 18: 1, Issue 58 (1989), 94-6. All of Frow‚Äôs later work draws on the framework elaborated in this book, although he has subsequently moved away from a commitment to Marxism towards a more Foucauldian understanding of social and discursive power. Philip Goldstein, \\"Post-Marxist Theory: An Introduction\\" (Albany: SUNY Press, 2005), pp. 97-108. \\"Cultural Studies and Cultural Value\\" (1995) undertook a critique of the hierarchy of value that sorts ‚Äòhigh‚Äô and ‚Äòlow‚Äô culture into distinct domains, arguing that the field of culture now has multiple centres and multiple domains of value which are irreducible to a single scale. The book formulated an account of the ‚Äòknowledge class‚Äô of information workers and argued that it has specific interests in the field of culture. The central essay of \\"Time and Commodity Culture\\" (1997) theorized the distinction and the inter-dependence of gift and commodity economies as a way of analysing the encroachment of the commodity form on the commons in information; other essays in the book explored the temporality of capital as the basis for historical understanding and the technologies of memory. Randy Martin, Review of \\"Time and Commodity Culture\\", \\"Science and Society\\" 63: 2 (1999), pp. 256-8. \\"Accounting for Tastes: Australian Everyday Cultures\\" (1999), written with Tony Bennett and Michael Emmison, is a study, based on a broad survey and the resulting quantitative analysis, of the cultural practices and preferences of Australians across a range of cultural areas. It sought to develop an account of social class in which cultural capital plays a central and formative role, and developed the concept of the regime of value to theorize the structural regularities it found. == Books == Frow‚Äôs most recent books have focused on questions of literary theory and its relation to cultural studies. \\"Genre\\" (2006; second revised edition 2015) explores the work of generic classification across a range of literary and cultural texts, understanding genres not as fixed frameworks but as dynamic processes of organization of social knowledge. \\"The Practice of Value\\" (2013) is a collection of essays on the relationship between literary and cultural studies. And \\"Character and Person\\" (2014) explores the nature of human personhood by setting models of the person in relation to models of fictional character in a number of distinct literary and cinematic systems. The book argues both for the specificity of the person and fictional character, and for the ways in which each of them depends upon and informs our understanding of the other.

The church was founded in Townsville, Queensland in 1924 by Charles Enticknap and has expanded into other cities in Australia and around the world with campuses in Cairns, Sunshine Coast, Emerald, Rockhampton, Yeppoon, Gold Coast and East London (South Africa). ==Senior Pastors== In October 2007, James and Samantha Macpherson took leadership of Calvary Christian Church. James, who was previously a journalist, was a leading preacher who spoke in churches all over the world, and was on the national and state executive for Australia Christian Churches. James was also featured in The Bolt Report, where he interviewed Andrew Bolt on the topic of Christianity in a secular society. In December 2018 James and Samantha divorce and 6 months later , in May 2019, James Macpherson decided to step down as Senior Pastor after over 11 years of service. Dustan and Sarah Bell were invited to take on the leadership of the church and oversee its continued expansion across Australia and abroad. ==Campuses== ===Australia=== ====Townsville==== Townsville is the headquarters campus, formerly known as Calvary Temple Assembly of God, founded in 1924, and is the main campus where James Macpherson resides. ====Sunshine Coast==== The Sunshine Coast campus was added to Calvary when the Macphersons took on the leadership in of what was known as Kings Christian Church, previously pastored by Steve Penny. The team are led by Pastors Daniel and Elise Pappas. ====Cairns==== Cairns was added to Calvary when public meetings where started in 2013 by a team sent out from the Townsville Campus. The congregation is led by Michelle and Matthew Fredericks. ====Emerald==== In 2015, James and Sam Macpherson were asked to take on leadership of Harvest Life Christian Church which was renamed as Calvary Emerald and added to the growing family of Calvary Christian Church. Pastor Chris and Beck Yelland lead the charge in Emerald. ====Yeppoon==== Also in 2015, Yeppoon Family Christian Church, previously led by Pastors Ernie and Cheryl Peters, was replanted as Calvary Yeppoon when they invited the Macphersons to take on leadership of the church. The church is currently led by Pastors Daniel and Joanna James. ====Rockhampton==== Calvary Rockhampton was planted in March 2016 and is led by Pastor Mark and Chevaun Tabacaru. ====Gold Coast==== Pastor Andrew and Christie Kirk planted Calvary Gold Coast in April 2017 at Robina State Primary School and numbers have been steadily growing since then. ====Geelong==== In 2020, Calvary will establish a campus in Geelong, Victoria. ===South Africa=== ====East London==== Formerly known as City Life Church (lead by Pastor David and Bev Gernetzky), Calvary East London has been running since February 2018 and was initially led by Pastors Dustan & Sarah Bell. Since Dustan and Sarah were invited to become the senior pastors of Calvary Christian Church, Tim and Ayesha Peters have transitioned to lead the team in South Africa. ===India=== Calvary will also commence establishment of a campus in India in 2022. ==Calvary Leadership College== Calvary Leadership College is the bible college of Calvary Christian Church, training future pastors and leaders from churches all over Australia and other countries. At current the leadership college offers diplomas in Church Leadership, Ministry and Business. ==Calvary Christian College== Linked with the Townsville Church is Calvary Christian College, a K-12 independent Christian school founded in 1978.

Part of the drainage basin of the Columbia River, its watershed covers about in Multnomah and Clackamas counties. The stream flows southeast from the Tualatin Mountains (West Hills) through the Multnomah Village neighborhood of Portland and the Tryon Creek State Natural Area to the Willamette in the city of Lake Oswego. Parks and open spaces cover about 21 percent of the watershed, while single-family homes dominate most of the remainder. The largest of the parks is the state natural area, which straddles the border between the two cities and counties. The bedrock under the watershed includes part of the last exotic terrane, a chain of seamounts, acquired by the North American Plate as it moved west during the Eocene. Known as the Waverly Hills Formation, it lies buried under ash and lava from later volcanic eruptions, sediments from flooding and erosion, and layers of wind-blown silt. Two dormant volcanoes from the Boring Lava Field are in the Tryon Creek watershed. Named for mid-19th century settler, Socrates Hotchkiss Tryon, Sr., the creek ran through forests of cedar and fir that were later logged by the Oregon Iron Company and others through the mid-20th century. Efforts to establish a large park in the watershed began in the 1950s and succeeded in 1975 when the state park was formally established. As of 2005, about 37 percent of the watershed was wooded and supported more than 60 species of birds as well as small mammals, amphibians, and fish. At the same time, the human population was about 18,000. == Course == Tryon Creek begins slightly north of Interstate 5 (I-5) and Oregon Route 99W near Multnomah Village and flows southeast for Although other sources give the creek's length as , Chapter 10 of Fanno and Tryon Creeks Watershed Management Plan by the Portland Bureau of Environmental Services gives a precise length of . The plan describes inflow above that point as a \\"headwaters complex\\" that \\"includes all small upper tributaries above RM 4.85.\\" By convention, stream lengths do not include tributary lengths. through Portland residential neighborhoods as well as Marshall Park and the Tryon Creek State Natural Area to its confluence with the Willamette River in the city of Lake Oswego. Not far from its source, the main stem runs through three closely spaced culverts with a combined length of then flows on the surface before entering another culvert, long under Southwest 30th Avenue at river mile (RM) 4.56 or river kilometer (RK) 7.34. Shortly thereafter, the stream passes under Route 99W (Barbur Boulevard) and I-5 through another culvert, long. Tryon Creek receives Falling Creek from the right at from the mouth. Quail and Burlingame creeks enter from the right shortly thereafter. At Marshall Park, the stream passes through a series of rock pools and steps known as the Marshall Cascade from RM 3.48 (RK 5.60) to RM 3.28 (RK 5.28). Arnold Creek, which is Tryon Creek's largest tributary, enters from the right from the mouth. Almost immediately, the creek enters a culvert, about long, that passes under Southwest Boones Ferry Road. Shortly thereafter, Tryon Creek enters the Tryon Creek State Natural Area. To the stream's right is the North Creek Trail. Soon the creek receives Fourth Avenue Creek from the left. At this point, the Fourth Avenue Trail runs parallel to the creek along the left bank. This trail soon merges with the Lewis and Clark Trail, which also runs parallel to the creek along the left bank. Then Tryon Creek passes under the High Bridge, the uppermost of five footbridges that span the main stem within the park. High Bridge carries the Middle Creek Trail as well as a linear horse trail connecting the park's North and South horse loops. Below this bridge, the creek flows for about before passing under the Beaver Bridge. In this stretch, the Middle Creek Trail parallels the stream along the right bank but crosses to the left bank at the bridge. Shortly thereafter, the creek passes under Obie's Bridge, which carries the Old Man Trail. Tryon Creek at Obie's Bridge Park Creek enters from the right at RM 1.80 (RK 2.90). Slightly below the confluence, the creek passes under the Red Fox Bridge, which carries the Red Fox Trail. Thereafter, the creek runs roughly parallel to the South Creek Trail, which is on the right for about . The creek receives Red Fox Creek from the right and Palatine Hill Creek from the left, then flows out of Portland and Multnomah County and into the city of Lake Oswego and Clackamas County. The stream then passes under the Iron Mountain Bridge, which carries the Iron Mountain Trail. Just below the bridge, Nettle Creek enters from the right at from the mouth, and shortly thereafter the creek passes a United States Geological Survey (USGS) stream gauge, which is on the right. The creek leaves the Tryon Creek State Natural Area just before entering a culvert under Oregon Route 43 at RM 0.24 (RK 0.39) and soon thereafter a set of Union Pacific Railroad tracks. Below this, Tryon Creek forms the boundary between the city of Lake Oswego and Briarwood, an unincorporated Clackamas County community, which is to the left. The Tryon Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant is on the right during this last stretch before the creek enters the Willamette River about upstream from its confluence with the Columbia River. === Discharge === Since 2002, the USGS has monitored the flow of Tryon Creek at a station from the mouth. The average flow between 2002 and 2011 was . This is from a drainage area of , about 97 percent of the total Tryon Creek watershed. The maximum flow recorded during this period was on December 9, 2010. The minimum was on September 4, 5, and 12, 2002. == Geology == Mount Sylvania as seen from Tualatin, southwest of the Tryon Creek watershed One hundred and fifty million years ago, Oregon did not exist. Not until plate tectonics separated North America from Europe and North Africa and pushed it westward did the continent acquire, bit by bit, what became the Pacific Northwest. Over many millions of years, the continent collided with and incorporated islands, reefs, and other exotic terranes. Part of the last major exotic terrane acquired by the North American Plate during the Eocene lies under the Tryon Creek watershed. The terrane consisted of a chain of seamounts that by 34 million years ago was being uplifted to become the Oregon Coast Range and the Tualatin Mountains (West Hills). The easternmost exposure of the basalts of this terrane is in Waverly Heights, near Milwaukie, across the Willamette River from Tryon Creek, and this formation underlies most of Tryon Creek State Park. Between 15 and 16 million years ago, in the Middle Miocene, eruptions of Columbia River basalts from volcanic vents in eastern Oregon and Washington flowed across much of northern Oregon, sometimes reaching the Pacific Ocean. Although these basalts have been mapped in the West Hills under Marquam Hill, Hoyt Arboretum, and the steepest slopes of Forest Park, they flowed around but did not completely cover the Waverly Hills Formation in the Tryon Creek watershed. Starting about 3 million years ago and continuing at least through the late Pleistocene, extensional faulting of the Earth's crust led to eruption of small volcanoes in the Boring volcanic field. This field extended roughly from Portland and Tualatin on the west to Battle Ground, Washington, on the north to Sandy and Boring on the east. Two of these volcanoes, Mount Sylvania and Cook's Butte, are in the Tryon Creek watershed. The Mount Sylvania eruptions included ash plumes and lava flows that covered some of the Waverly Heights Formation and Columbia River basalts. About 15,000 years ago, cataclysmic ice age events known as the Missoula Floods or Bretz Floods originating in the Clark Fork region of northern Idaho inundated the Columbia River basin many times. These floods deposited huge amounts of debris and sediment and created new floodplains in the Willamette Valley. Over long stretches of time between the great floods, dry winds deposited silt. At elevations above in the Tryon Creek watershed, wind-blown silt covers the lava, while at lower elevations sand and gravel cover the bedrock. == Watershed == A path runs through the forest near Tryon Creek in Marshall Park. The Tryon Creek watershed covers about or . Of this, about 80 percent is within the Portland city limits, and the remaining 20 percent is split among the jurisdictions of the city of Lake Oswego, and the counties of Multnomah and Clackamas. These four overlap with the jurisdiction of the State of Oregon, which owns the natural area. Watersheds that border the Tryon Creek watershed are Fanno Creek to the west and northwest, Stephens Creek to the north, the Willamette River to the east and Oswego Lake to the south. More than of surface streets, including parts of Interstate 5, Oregon Route 99W, Oregon Route 43, Boones Ferry Road, Taylors Ferry Road, and Terwilliger Boulevard, run through the watershed. About of precipitation, almost entirely rain, fall on the watershed each year. Summers are dry, and most of the precipitation occurs between October and May. Elevations within the drainage basin vary from Mount Sylvania, which rises to above sea level in the West Hills, to where the creek enters the Willamette River. Between 60 and 75 percent of the slopes in the watershed exceed a 30-percent grade and are especially steep near the headwaters. Impervious surfaces cover about 24 percent of the basin. These surfaces and the relatively impermeable silt and clay soils that underlie the area contribute to rapid runoff and low baseflows in the creek and its tributaries. The total length of surface streams in the drainage basin is about , while another run through culverts or pipes. Although major flooding in 1996 caused landslides and severe damage to stream beds and banks along Tryon Creek and its tributaries, it caused no significant property damage in the watershed. In 2000, the population of the Tryon Creek watershed within Portland was about 18,000. In 2005, Portland's Bureau of Environmental Services (BES) described land-use zoning in the watershed as follows: single-family residential, 55 percent; parks and open space, 14 percent; multi-family residential, 5 percent; commercial, 3 percent, and insufficient data, 2 percent. To reach 100 percent, BES listed but did not differentiate by zoning type the roughly 20 percent of the watershed that lies beyond the Portland city limits. Metro, the regional government for the Portland metropolitan area, says that parks and natural areas cover about 21 percent of the total watershed, while single- family housing dominates most of the rest. === Tributaries === The major smaller streams in the Tryon Creek watershed are Arnold Creek and Falling Creek. The larger of the two, Arnold Creek, has a watershed of roughly or 18 percent of the total, while Falling Creek's watershed covers or 6 percent of the total. The seven named tributaries from mouth to source are Nettle, Palatine Hill, Red Fox, Park, Fourth Avenue, Arnold, and Falling creeks. === Water quality === High Bridge over Tryon Creek in Tryon Creek State Natural Area Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) developed the Oregon Water Quality Index (OWQI) in the 1970s to rate general water quality at different locations. Scores can vary from 10 (worst) to 100 (ideal). Portland's Bureau of Environmental Services (BES) incorporated the OWQI into its monitoring of Tryon Creek in 1997. As of 2004, the overall OWQI score for Tryon Creek was 74 or \\"poor\\"; this was slightly better than nearby Fanno Creek at 67. The State of Oregon listed Tryon Creek as \\"water-quality limited\\" in 1998 because water temperatures on the lower of the main stem as well as on Nettle, Arnold, and Falling creeks exceeded the upper limit for protecting salmonid fish rearing and migratory fish passage during the summer. BES monitors water quality at three Tryon Creek sites. Two are near I-5 and Barbur Boulevard in the upper watershed, and the third is at Southwest Boones Ferry Road, about from the mouth. BES looks at several indicators such as dissolved oxygen, nutrients, and total suspended solids. Diffuse pollution from nonpoint sources enters the creek from its urban surroundings. Point sources of pollution in the creek include two major upper-watershed stormwater outfalls draining of the upper watershed and contributing about half of the creek's total suspended solids. As of 2004, the only water-quality indicator in the watershed that failed to meet minimal standards was the water temperature. ===Annual report card=== In 2015, BES began issuing annual \\"report cards\\" for watersheds or fractions thereof that lie within the city. BES assigns grades for each of four categories: hydrology, water quality, habitat, and fish and wildlife. Hydrology grades depend on the amount of pavement and other impervious surfaces in the watershed and the degree to which its streams flow freely, not dammed or diverted. Water-quality grades are based on measurements of dissolved oxygen, E-coli bacteria, temperature, suspended solids, and substances such as mercury and phosphorus. Habitat ranking depends on the condition of stream banks and floodplains, riparian zones, tree canopies, and other variables. The fish and wildlife assessment includes birds, fish, and macroinvertebrates. In 2015, the BES grades for Tryon Creek are hydrology, B; water quality, B; habitat, B, and fish and wildlife, C‚àí. == History == The Tryon house, built in 1850 and demolished in the 1990s Multnomah and Clackamas counties were named after groups of Native Americans who lived in the area before settlement by European Americans in the 19th century. Evidence suggests that people lived in the northern Oregon Cascades as early as 10,000 years ago. By 2,000 to 3,000 years ago, the Clackamas River basin, about upriver from the mouth of Tryon Creek and on the east side of the Willamette, was home to the Clackamas tribe. They were a subgroup of the Chinookan speakers who lived near the Columbia River from Celilo Falls to the Pacific Ocean. The Clackamas lands included the lower Willamette River from Willamette Falls at what became Oregon City to its confluence with the Columbia River. When Lewis and Clark visited the area in 1806, the Clackamas tribe consisted of about 1,800 people living in 11 villages. Epidemics of smallpox, malaria, and measles reduced this population to 88 by 1851, and in 1855 the tribe signed a treaty surrendering its lands. Another group of Chinookans, the Multnomahs, lived on Sauvie Island, about downriver from the mouth of Tryon Creek. Lewis and Clark estimated that 800 Multnomahs inhabited 5 villages on the island in 1806, but disease reduced them later in the century to near extinction. In 1850, Socrates Hotchkiss Tryon, Sr., a pioneer settler of European descent, established a donation land claim at the south end of Tryon Creek canyon. Five years later, he died, leaving the land to his wife, Frances. The land then passed to other relatives, including Socrates Tryon, Jr., who sold the in 1874 to the Oregon Iron Company. For nearly 25 years, the company cut virgin cedar and fir to use in its foundry in Lake Oswego. Its logging road later became Old Iron Mountain Trail in the Tryon Creek State Natural Area. In 1900, fire in the upper canyon left charred snags still visible along the natural area's Center and Big Fir trails. Logging resumed in 1912 in the north part of the canyon, where The Boone's Ferry Wood and Tie Company had a site near what became Alfred Street. A sawmill and steam donkey engine operated near the future sites of Beaver Bridge and Obie's Bridge. The lumber was used chiefly for railroad ties, cordwood and flagpoles, and left huge cedar stumps that remain in the park. Intermittent logging continued through 1961, and a 1962 windstorm known as the Columbus Day Storm blew down many remaining trees. Local efforts began in the 1950s to establish a park along the creek, In 1969, the government of Multnomah County bought to start a large regional park and sought citizen assistance with the project. This led to formation of Friends of Tryon Creek Park, which raised funds, helped arrange land deals, worked on problems of jurisdiction in a two-county, two-city park, and sought help from the state. In 1970, Oregon Governor Tom McCall announced the formation of Tryon Creek State Park. Over the next few years, the state bought more than of land for nearly $3 million, including federal matching funds. The Friends and the state collaborated in park planning and further fund-raising. In 1973, more than 300 volunteers built trails, and the nature center and shelter were finished by 1975. The park was officially dedicated on July 1, 1975 and later renamed Tryon Creek State Natural Area. == Vegetation and wildlife == Western trilliums flourish in the Tryon Creek State Natural Area. About 37 percent of the watershed is wooded. Dominant trees are red alder, bigleaf maple, Douglas-fir, western redcedar, and western hemlock. The forest understory in the Tryon Creek State Natural Area includes many trilliums; they are celebrated each spring during the park's Trillium Festival. More than 90 species of wildflower such as fringecup are found in the park as well as plants such as sword fern. Invasive species found in many parts of the watershed include English ivy, Himalayan blackberry, English holly, garlic mustard, and western clematis. Riparian zones and floodplains are relatively intact along the lower reaches of the main stem in the state natural area, fairly intact in Marshall Park, and marginal in the upper reaches surrounded by homes. Arnold Creek has riparian corridors wider than in good condition, while Falling Creek's riparian zones, surrounded by homes, are in poor condition. Damaged zones from which native vegetation has been removed lead to erosion, stream bank failure, sedimentation, lack of shading, and higher stream temperatures. Tryon Creek is among the few streams in the Portland metropolitan area with a run of steelhead Trout, and coho salmon have been recorded spawning in the creek. Surveys by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife in 2002 found coho, chinook salmon, steelhead, and coastal cutthroat trout in different parts of the creek at different times of the year. None was present in large number. Cutthroat trout had the biggest population, estimated at 53 individual fish during the spring of 2002. Water striders, which are invertebrates that can walk on water, are common in the pools of Tryon Creek. More than 60 species of birds, including Cooper's hawks, great blue herons, kingfishers, towhees, waxwings, and wrens frequent the area. Some of the resident mammals are bats, coyotes, moles, rabbits, skunks, and squirrels, while frogs, salamanders, snakes, and turtles also do well in the watershed. == Parks == Nature Center at Tryon Creek State Natural Area Parks in the Tryon Creek watershed include Tryon Creek State Natural Area, Oregon's only metropolitan state park. At about , the natural area is much larger than the watershed's other parks. The state park includes a bicycle path that runs along Terwilliger Boulevard on the east edge of the park as part of the Portland metropolitan area's system of greenway trails known as the 40-Mile Loop. Equestrians can ride through the woods on horse trails totaling about . Hikers can use the bike path, horse trails, and about of hiking trails. A paved loop trail of about , furnished with drinking fountains and interpretive signs, can accommodate wheelchairs. A park building called the Nature Center houses a gift shop, a large classroom, space for educational exhibits, and a play area for small children. Tryon Creek, which flows through the middle of the state park, also runs through Marshall Park, a modified natural area of about in a canyon in the hills northwest of Mount Sylvania. It features hiking trails, a playground, picnic tables, a waterfall, and a stone bridge over the creek. Other parks in the watershed include West Portland Park, a natural area of about , and Maricara Park, a natural area of about .

It is the only Oregon state park within a major metropolitan area. The park lies between Boones Ferry Road and Terwilliger Boulevard in southwest Portland in Multnomah County and northern Lake Oswego in Clackamas County and is bisected from north to south by Tryon Creek. ==Resources== The park includes hiking trails, a paved bicycle path, and horse trails. The bicycle path, which runs along Terwilliger Boulevard on the east edge of the park to Lake Oswego, is part of the Portland metropolitan area's system of greenway trails known as the 40-Mile Loop. Near the main entrance off Terwilliger, part of the parking lot is devoted to horse trailers. Riders can choose between the North Horse Loop and the West Horse Loop. Hikers can use the bike path, the horse trails, and of hiking trails. The paved Trillium Trail, a loop furnished with drinking fountains and interpretive signs, can accommodate wheelchairs. Trillium Trail has benches and two viewing decks. A park building called the Nature Center is near the main park entrance. It has a small play area for toddlers, a gift shop, a large classroom, and a separate area for educational exhibits. Nearby is the Glenn Jackson Shelter, a covered structure for outdoor events. ==History== In 1850, Socrates Hotchkiss Tryon, Sr., pioneer settler, established a donation land claim at the south end of the canyon. Five years later, he died, leaving the land to his wife, Frances. The land then passed to other relatives, including Socrates Tryon, Jr., who sold the in 1874 to the Oregon Iron Company. For nearly 25 years, the company logged virgin cedar and fir to use in its foundry in Lake Oswego. Its logging road later became Old Iron Mountain Trail in the state park. In 1900, fire in the upper canyon left charred snags still visible along the park's Center and Big Fir trails. Logging resumed in 1912 in the north part of the canyon, where The Boone's Ferry Wood and Tie Company had a site near what became Alfred Street. A sawmill and steam donkey engine operated near what became the sites of Beaver Bridge and Obie's Bridge. The lumber was used chiefly for railroad ties, cordwood and flagpoles, and left huge cedar stumps that remain in the park. Intermittent logging continued through 1961, and a 1962 windstorm known as the Columbus Day Storm blew down many remaining trees. Local efforts began in the 1950s to establish a park along the creek, In 1969, the government of Multnomah County bought to start a large regional park and sought citizen assistance with the project. This led to formation of Friends of Tryon Creek Park, which raised private funds for the park, helped arrange land deals, helped solve problems of jurisdiction in a two-county, two-city park, and sought help from the state. In 1970, Oregon Governor Tom McCall announced the formation of Tryon Creek State Park. Over the next few years, the state bought more than of land for nearly $3 million, including federal matching funds. The Friends and the state collaborated in park planning and further fund-raising. In 1973, more than 300 volunteers built trails, and the nature center and shelter were finished by 1975. The park was officially dedicated on July 1, 1975. On May 6, 2020, the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department announced that the park was one of eight state parks to reopen after being shut down almost two months earlier on March 23 by Governor Kate Brown in the effort to curb the spread of COVID-19 during the 2019‚Äì20 coronavirus pandemic. ==Vegetation and wildlife== Dominant plants in the Tryon Creek watershed are red alder, bigleaf maple, Douglas-fir, Western redcedar, and Western hemlock. The forest understory in the park includes many trilliums, celebrated each spring during the park's Trillium Festival. More than 90 species of wildflower such as fringecup are found in the park as well as plants such as sword fern. More than 50 species of birds as well as small mammals such as beaver inhabit the park. Tryon Creek is among the few streams in the Portland metropolitan area with a run of steelhead trout, and coho salmon have been recorded spawning in the creek. Water striders, invertebrates that can walk on water, are common in the pools of Tryon Creek. ==See also== * Arnold‚ÄìPark Log Home * List of Oregon state parks ==References== ==External links== * Friends of Tryon Creek * Tryon Creek Watershed Council * Tryon State Park in The Oregon Encyclopedia Category:1975 establishments in Oregon Category:Nature centers in Oregon Category:Parks in Multnomah County, Oregon Category:Parks in Portland, Oregon Category:Protected areas established in 1975 Category:Southwest Portland, Oregon Category:State parks of Oregon ","title":"Tryon Creek State Natural Area"},{"id":"11643453","text":"Ideal Jawa (India) Ltd was an Indian motorcycle company based in Mysore which sold licensed Jawa motorcycles beginning in 1960 under the brand name Jawa and from 1973 as Yezdi. The catchphrase for the bikes sold by the firm was \\"Forever Bike, Forever Value\\". Jawa motorcycles were introduced in India in 1960 and they have a cult following to this present day. Production was carried out directly in India by Ideal Jawa India Ltd based out of Mysore . The Yezdi factory was located along the railway line which heads to Mysore Junction. The factory was inaugurated by the then Governor of Mysore State, H.H Sri Jayachamaraja Wadiyar, Maharaja of Mysore in 1961. The Jawa 250 Type 353/04 designated as 'A' Type, Yezdi 250 'B' Type, Yezdi 250 Roadking, Yezdi 350 Twin (type 634) and Yezdi 250 Monarch models are driven to this day in various parts of the country. Jawa and Yezdi bikes, especially the ones with fuel tank paddings and ignition systems on the fuel tank are now collectors items. The company stopped production in 1996. There are still several bike enthusiasts in the country. There are several bike clubs across the country, some of them even organizing long distance rallies.

Ideal Jawa also exported many of the above models to over 61 countries around the world including Turkey, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Egypt and others. Guatemala was supplied with custom White Yezdi Roadkings for their Police forces. Some Yezdi 175s were supplied to an oil company in Ghana. A model exported to Venezuela was called the Yezdi 250 MT. A few Yezdi Monarchs were used for Pizza delivery in Abu Dhabi, UAE ==End of production== When the company was forced to shut down, it was producing the 175, Monarch, Deluxe, Road Kings and CL II. The main reason for the company's collapse was labor trouble and increasing levels of pollution control norms which were making the two stroke bikes that the company produced obsolete. With the advent of Yamaha and Honda in India, these bikes lost their status as Yezdi's were heavier and in some cases slower with lower fuel efficiency. ==In motorsports== Ideal Jawa had factory teams for both road races at Sholavaram and the National Motorcycle Rally Championships. Yezdi's were preferred rally bikes in the 80s and 90s. ==Aftermath== Though the Yezdi factory is closed and Yezdi bikes are vintage to the present day many people in India are having a craze for these bikes and own them. Yezdi bike clubs have been created where members show off their Yezdi bikes and by doing so, are trying to revive the craze for these bikes. ==Photo gallery== File:Yezdi 60 Jet.jpg|Yezdi Jet 60 'B' Series File:Yezdi 175 Deluxe.jpg|Yezdi 175 Deluxe File:Yezdi Deluxe.jpg|Yezdi 250 Deluxe 'CL2' Type File:Yezdi D 250 Classic.JPG|Yezdi 250 Classic 'D' Type File:YEZDI CLASSIC 250CC CLASSIC.jpg|Yezdi 250 CL-II 'CL2' Type File:Yezdi Oilking.jpg|Yezdi 250 Oilking 'C' Type File:Yezdi Roadking.jpg|Yezdi 250 Roadking 'C' Type File:Yezdi Monarch.jpg|Yezdi 250 Monarch 'C' Type File:Yezdi 350 Twin.jpg|Yezdi 350 Twin (Type 634) ==See also== * Jawa Motors ==References== ==External links== *www.yezdi.com * * * Category:Motorcycle manufacturers of India Category:Defunct motor vehicle manufacturers of India Category:Indian motorcycles ","title":"Ideal Jawa"},{"id":"11643454","text":"William Patrick Watkins (born September 2, 1972) is a former Major League Baseball player who played outfield for the Cincinnati Reds and Colorado Rockies. ==Early life== Watkins had planned on playing football at Duke after graduating from Garner Magnet High School, and had even talked to their coach, Steve Spurrier, about playing under him.

In the last years of the Mommu's reign, the extensive preparations for this projected move had begun; but the work could not be completed before the late-emperor's untimely death. Shortly after the neng≈ç was changed to Wad≈ç, an imperial rescript was issued concerning the establishment of a new capital at the Heij≈ç-ky≈ç at Nara in Yamato Province. It had been customary since ancient times for the capital to be moved with the beginning of each new reign. However, Emperor Monmu decided not to move the capital, preferring instead to stay at the Fujiwara Palace which had been established by Empress Jit≈ç.Varley, p. 140. * Wad≈ç 5, 1st month, 28th day (711): ≈å no Yasumaro completes the KojikiHioki (2007:250) * 712 (Wad≈ç 5): The Mutsu Province was separated from Dewa Province. * 713 (Wad≈ç 6, 3rd month): Tanba Province was separated from Tango Province; Mimasaka Province was divided from Bizen Province; and Hy≈´ga Province was divided from ≈åsumi Province. * Wad≈ç 6, 5th month, 2nd day (713): imperial decree to compile Fudoki Hioki (2007:253) * 713 (Wad≈ç 6): The road which traverses Mino Province and Shinano Province was widened to accommodate travelers; and the road was widened in the Kiso District of modern Nagano Prefecture. After Empress Gemmei transferred the seat of her government to Nara, this mountain location remained the capital throughout the succeeding seven reigns. In a sense, the years of the Nara period developed into one of the more significant consequences of her comparatively short reign. After reigning for eight years, Empress Genmei abdicated in favor of her daughter. ==Notes== ==References== * Brown, Delmer M. and Ichir≈ç Ishida, eds. (1979). Gukansh≈ç: The Future and the Past.

It was based on the CZ 250 motocross (type 980.5) ridden by Jaroslav Falta to the runner-up spot in the 1974 motocross world championship. It was sold under the brand name Yezdi. The bike won several Indian rallies and road races. The bike had a 250 cc engine with dual exhausts and a semi-automatic clutch and Jawa/CZ's trademark integrated gear shifter/kick-starter. == Origins == The Yezdi Roadking was the successor of the short-lived Yezdi Oilking. The Oilking was the first motorcycle in India to attempt to move away from pre-mixed fuel to a separate oil lube system via an oil pump. The box-like shape on the left hand cover housed the oil pump. Unfortunately this system had a very high failure rate resulting in piston seizures. This resulted in the discontinuation of the Oilking and the birth of the Roadking. The Roadking though, still retained the protuberance on the left engine cover that housed the oil pump in the Oilking. The Yezdi Roadking was based on the 1974 CZ 250 Falta, where the original bore and stroke of was retained, but detuned for lower power than its Motocross original. The engine block is smaller than and different from the Yezdi Classic/Model B in appearance. Also the CZ original had a \\"Porcupine\\" cylinder head, which was used only in the initial models; the cylinder head later reverted to regular straight fin design. The cylinder block (Type 980.5) was from CZ. Just like in the older Jawa 353 Kyvacka and the Yezdi Model B, the Roadking also came with an original Tesla (Czechoslovakian) headlight bulb as standard. ==Frame== The frame is a single frame of motocross origin and was built out of square tube. The fork was more pronounced with a higher rake angle and came with adjustable shock absorbers. Rims were 16 inches. The motocross and ice racing origin frame and proper weight balance made handling very easy and agile compared to its rivals in India. ==Engine== The cylinder block was carried over from the CZ 250 motocross, which had an over-square stroke ratio. Carburetors were either Jikov (tickler choke) or Pacco, wherein the former was exclusively for the Roadking while the latter was used for the Classic D250 model. The spark plugs were cold and the bike also featured a semi-automatic clutch, where a mechanism by the name cam and roller connected to the clutch push rod to engage/disengage the clutch which is unique to this and other Yezdi/Jawa models. The cam and roller is mechanically coupled to the gear selector thereby eliminating the need for a hand-clutch while engaging the gears. The motorcycle featured dual exhaust ports with dual silencers akin to most Jawa motorcycles, but unlike the CZ 250 on which it was based, which featured a single exhaust port. Another unique feature of the bike was that the kick- starter and the gear shared the same shaft as with all Jawa/CZ/Yezdi motorcycles. Once the gear rod is reversed it doubles as a kicker and once started it automatically returns to the original position. == Models == ===CB unit models=== An early Yezdi Roadking CB Unit Model The bike was silently launched in India in the late 1970s by Ideal Jawa. It had a prominent fuel tank and was finished in signature Jawa maroon and sometimes in black and gold pinstripe, priced slightly higher than the Classic and CL II models. The troublesome contact breaker ignition was replaced in 1993 with an electronic CDI unit. Until 1989, Roadkings had a provision for adjusting the front fork dampers. ===Oilking=== Yezdi OilKing During the late 1970s, another model known as Oil King was also launched which featured an oil pump for the 2T mix with petrol but later production ceased due to rampant issues with fuel pump failure. The prominent protrusion on the left hand side gearbox housing was the original location of the pump. Though the model was discontinued, the engine casing found its way into the Roadking and hence all Roadkings have this protrusion even though the oil pump is not included. ===CDI unit models=== In 1993, in an effort to increase fuel efficiency and to solve starting problems the CB or contact breaker ignition units were replaced with CDI electronic ignition units. The livery was also changed. Fuel efficiency was increased by 30%, however the motorcycle's competitors were getting better and with rising fuel prices the sales plummeted until finally it ceased operations in 1996. ===Monarch=== Yezdi Monarch At the 1996 Auto Expo, Yezdi displayed a model which used the Yezdi 350 Twin frame & fuel tank, and the Roadking engine. The rims were 18 inch as opposed to the regular 16 inch. However, it sold only in few numbers. Although some attribute its low sales volume to the company's need to get rid of the surplus Yezdi 350 frames that remained in the factory after the Twin was discontinued. ==Indian Motorsports== In road races at Sholavaram, the Roadking ran in its own 250 cc class, while in the Indian open class category its main rival was Royal Enfield Bullet and later the much more powerful Rajdoot 350. Power was usually increased to 25+ bhp or beyond for Group E categories where the engine was bored up till 300 cc and over-engineered in stock trim. Among prominent racers were C.K. Chinnappa and Somender Singh. In rallies, N. Jagadeeswara Reddy won many rallies until 1980. Then racing couple Jagat and Anita Nanjappa and Thirumal Roy won several victories before switching to the Rajdoot Yamaha RD350. During the early 1990s FMSCI, the sporting federation of India banned two-wheelers above 120 cc from rallies thus ending the Roadking's run in motor sports. ==Powergliders== The Roadking engines were a favorite among the hang- glider manufacturers in India. A Coimbatore based manufacturer headed by late motor racing driver and constructor, S. Karivardhan manufactured and exported several Powergliders using Roadking engines with modified aluminium heads, K & N filters and sleeved bore. ===Further developments=== As a result of power glider efforts, during 1996 Somender Singh, a former Ideal Jawa road and rally racer developed a more refined engine, made from aluminium as opposed to the usual cast-iron, with increased power and fuel efficiency which was featured in Car & Bike magazine. The design was never put into production even though it ended up with Ideal Jawa. These motorcycles were also used by various police forces around the world, examples being Guatemala, Sri Lanka, Egypt, Turkey etc. == External links == * Official Ideal Jawa site Category:Ideal Jawa motorcycles Category:Motorcycles introduced in 1978 ","title":"Yezdi Roadking"},{"id":"11643511","text":"Chris Wilkinson is a British architect and founder of WilkinsonEyre.

The organization was originally known as the Walnut Control Board, changing its name to the Walnut Marketing Board in 1962 and to the California Walnut Board in 2008. Its formation was authorized by the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA). Under the AAA, the Walnut Control Board was authorized to assess crops and declare a percentage as surplus. Its 1934 assessment designating 30% of the crop as surplus met with local resistance. In 2009, responding to a request from the Board, the United States Department of Agriculture purchased $30 million of the crop, which was distributed to nutrition assistance programs. The AAA's application to walnuts was affirmed by Federal Marketing Order 984 in 1948. The USDA and the organization date its foundation to that year. Federal regulations govern its operations. As of 2008, the Board consisted of five grower representatives, four handler representatives, and one member of the public, all serving two- year terms. The Board continues to implement the Marketing Order. Its activities now include the promotion of walnuts in the US diet, research funding, product grading, and compilation of crop statistics. The USDA oversees its operations. An analysis of its domestic marketing program, published in 2002, concluded that its cost-benefit ratio was favorable. ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:Agricultural organizations based in the United States Category:Agricultural marketing organizations Category:Marketing boards Category:Edible nuts and seeds Category:Agricultural marketing in the United States ","title":"Walnut Marketing Board"},{"id":"11643520","title":"Nawabganj, Barabanki"},{"id":"11643532","text":"The conflicts between the G√∂kturks and the Sassanid Empire include: * First Perso-Turkic War (588‚Äì589) * Second Perso-Turkic War (606‚Äì608) * Third Perso- Turkic War (627‚Äì629) Category:Wars involving the Sasanian Empire ","title":"G√∂kt√ºrk‚ÄìPersian wars"},{"id":"11643536","text":"{| | The entrance reflects the park's established roots. | The sports field is large enough for several soccer fields. | This picnic shelter may be reserved.

Kristin Neff has defined self-compassion as being composed of three main components ‚Äì self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness. *Self-kindness: Self-compassion entails being warm towards oneself when encountering pain and personal shortcomings, rather than ignoring them or hurting oneself with self-criticism. *Common humanity: Self-compassion also involves recognizing that suffering and personal failure is part of the shared human experience. *Mindfulness: Self- compassion requires taking a balanced approach to one's negative emotions so that feelings are neither suppressed nor exaggerated. Negative thoughts and emotions are observed with openness, so that they are held in mindful awareness. Mindfulness is a non-judgmental, receptive mind state in which individuals observe their thoughts and feelings as they are, without trying to suppress or deny them. Conversely, mindfulness requires that one not be \\"over- identified\\" with mental or emotional phenomena, so that one suffers aversive reactions. This latter type of response involves narrowly focusing and ruminating on one's negative emotions. Self-compassion has been considered to resemble Carl Rogers' notion of \\"unconditional positive regard\\" applied both towards clients and oneself; Albert Ellis' \\"unconditional self-acceptance\\"; Maryhelen Snyder's notion of an \\"internal empathizer\\" that explored one's own experience with \\"curiosity and compassion\\"; Ann Weiser Cornell's notion of a gentle, allowing relationship with all parts of one's being; and Judith Jordan's concept of self-empathy, which implies acceptance, care and empathy towards the self.Gary Buck, David Lukoff: Self-Compassion i: Spiritual and Psychological Roots (course description), SCRC Self-compassion is different from self-pity, a state of mind or emotional response of a person believing to be a victim and lacking the confidence and competence to cope with an adverse situation. Research indicates that self-compassionate individuals experience greater psychological health than those who lack self-compassion. For example, self-compassion is positively associated with life satisfaction, wisdom, happiness, optimism, curiosity, learning goals, social connectedness, personal responsibility, and emotional resilience. At the same time, it is associated with a lower tendency for self-criticism, depression, anxiety, rumination, thought suppression, perfectionism, and disordered eating attitudes.Adams, C. E., & Leary, M. R. (in press). Promoting Self-compassionate Attitudes toward Eating Among Restrictive and Guilty Eaters. Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology.Gilbert, & Irons, 2005 Self-compassion has different effects than self-esteem, a subjective emotional evaluation of the self. Although psychologists extolled the benefits of self-esteem for many years, recent research has exposed costs associated with the pursuit of high self-esteem, including narcissism, distorted self-perceptions, contingent and/or unstable self-worth, as well as anger and violence toward those who threaten the ego. As self-esteem is often associated with perceived self-worth in externalised domains such as appearance, academics and social approval, it is often unstable and susceptible to negative outcomes. In comparison, it appears that self-compassion offers the same mental health benefits as self-esteem, but with fewer of its drawbacks such as narcissism, ego-defensive anger, inaccurate self-perceptions, self-worth contingency, or social comparison.Neff, K. D & Vonk, R. (submitted). Self-compassion versus self- esteem: Two different ways of relating to oneself. Manuscript submitted for publication. == Scales == Much of the research conducted on self-compassion so far has used the Self-Compassion Scale, created by Kristin Neff, which measures the degree to which individuals display self-kindness against self- judgment, common humanity versus isolation, and mindfulness versus over- identification. The Self-Compassion Scale has been translated into different languages. Some of these include a Czech, Dutch, Japanese, Chinese, Turkish and Greek version. === Development === The original sample for which the scale was developed consisted of 68 undergraduate students from a large university in the United States. In this experiment, the participants narrowed down the potential scale items to 71. The next stage of development involved testing the reliability and validity of the scale among a larger group of participants. During this research study, 391 undergraduate students were selected at random to complete the 71 previously narrowed down scale items. Based on their results, the number of items was reduced to 26. The self- compassion scales have good reliability and validity. A second study was conducted to look more closely at the difference between self-esteem and self- compassion. This study consisted of 232 randomly selected, undergraduate students. Participants were asked to complete a number of different scales in questionnaire form. They were as follows: The 26-item Self-compassion Scale, the 10-item Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale, the 10-item Self-determination Scale, the 21-item Basic Psychological Needs Scale, and the 40-item Narcissistic Personality Inventory. Based on the findings, Neff reports \\"that self- compassion and self-esteem were measuring two different psychological phenomena.\\" A third study was conducted to examine the construct validity. By comparing two different groups of people, researchers would be able to see the different levels of self-compassion. Forty-three Buddhist practitioners completed the Self-compassion Scale as well as a self-esteem scale. The sample of 232 undergraduate students from the second study was used as the comparison group. As expected by Neff, the Buddhist practitioners had significantly higher self-compassion scores than the students. === Self-compassion scale === The long version of the Self-compassion scale (SCS) consists of 26 items. This includes 6 subscales ‚Äì self-kindness, self-judgement, common humanity, isolation, mindfulness, and over-identification. Neff recommends this scale for ages 14 and up with a minimum 8th grade reading level. Presented on a Likert scale, ranging from 1 (almost no self-compassion) to 5 (constant self- compassion), those completing the SCS are able to gain insight on how they respond to themselves during a struggle or challenging time. A shorter, Dutch version of the SCS scale has been developed that uses 24 items. === Short form === The short version of the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS-SF) consists of 12 items and is available in Dutch and English. Research reveals that the short form scale can be used competently as a substitute for the long form scale. A study conducted at the University of Leuven, Belgium concluded that when examining total scores, this shorter version provides an almost perfect correlation with the longer version. === Six-factor model === Neff's scale proposes three interacting components of self-compassion, which are each composed of two opposite facets. The first dimension is self-kindness versus self-judgment. Self-kindness refers to one's ability to be kind and understanding of oneself, whereas self-judgement refers to being critical and harsh towards oneself. The second dimension is common humanity versus isolation. Common humanity refers to one's ability to recognize that they are part of a related group of others and that suffering is part of the human condition. The third dimension is mindfulness versus over-identification. Mindfulness refers to one's awareness and acceptance of painful experiences in a balanced and non-judgmental way. Neff describes these three dimensions interacting to enhance and engender one another. === Criticisms of Neff's scale === Currently, Kristin Neff's Self-Compassion Scale is the only self- report instrument used to measure self-compassion. Although it is widely accepted as being a reliable and valid tool to measure self-compassion, recent research has posed questions regarding the scale's generalizability and its use of a six-factor model. ==== Generalizability ==== The generalizability of Neff's Self-Compassion Scale can be questioned; although the scale is used to measure self-compassion in the general population and has been translated into many languages, the scale itself has mostly been tested on college students. ==== Six-factor model ==== A recent study performed by Ang√©lica L√≥pez et al. examined the factor structure, reliability, and construct validity of Neff's Self-compassion Scale using a large representative sample from the general population. The study consisted of 1,736 participants and used both a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to determine if Neff's six-factor structure could be replicated. Lopez's study could not replicate the six-factor structure of Neff's Self-compassion Scale, but rather suggested a two-factor model of the scale, created by grouping the positive and negative items separately. Lopez's study also suggests it is important to view self-compassion and self-criticism as being distinct from one another, traits that Neff's Self-compassion Scale assumes are opposites. Lopez's study makes it clear that there is room for further research into the validity of the six-factor structure used by Neff's Self-compassion Scale. == Exercises == Self-compassion exercises generally consist of either a writing exercise, role-playing, or introspective contemplation, and are designed to foster self-kindness, mindfulness, and feelings of common humanity. Self- compassion exercises have been shown to be effective in increasing self- compassion, along with increases in self-efficacy, optimism, and mindfulness. These exercises have also been shown to decrease rumination. In individuals who were vulnerable to depression, one week of daily self-compassion exercises lead to reduced depression up to three months following the exercise, and increased happiness up to six months following the exercise, regardless of the pre-exercise levels of happiness. === How would you treat a friend? === This exercise asks the user to imagine that they are comforting a close friend who is going through a tough situation. The user is then asked to compare and contrast how they react internally to their own struggles, and to endeavour applying the same loving kindness to themselves that they would apply to a friend. === Self-compassion break === This exercise is to be used during times of acute distress. The user is asked to focus on a stressful event or situation. Then, the user is asked to repeat several prompts to themselves, each of which emphasizes one of the three main tenets of self-compassion: mindfulness, common humanity, and self-kindness. === Exploring through writing === In this exercise, the user is asked to focus on a facet of themself that they believe to be an imperfection, and that makes them feel inadequate. Once they have brought this issue to mind, they are asked to write a letter to themself from the perspective of an unconditionally loving imaginary friend. The user is then asked to focus on the soothing and comforting feelings of compassion that they have generated for themself. === Criticizer, criticized, and compassionate observer === This exercise asks the user to occupy several \\"chairs\\" during the course of the practice. Initially, they are asked to occupy the chair of the self-critic, and to express their feelings of self- criticism. They are asked to analyze this criticism and make note of its defining characteristics. Then, the user is asked to take the chair of their criticized self, and to imagine verbally responding to their inner critic. Subsequently, the user is prompted to conduct a dialogue between these two aspects of the self, the criticizer and the criticized. Following this, the user is asked to imagine themself as a compassionate observer of this dialogue, and finally the user is asked to reflect upon the experience. === Changing your critical self-talk === This exercise is meant to be conducted over several weeks, in the form of recurring reflection on the nature of their self-criticism. Users are asked to aim to notice when they are being self- critical, to react to their self-criticism with compassion, and to reframe the language of their inner critic. === Journal === This exercise entails keeping a daily journal for at least one week, and is used to reflect on difficult experiences, self-criticisms, and other stressors. The user is asked to analyze each of these events through the lenses of self-kindness (using gentle, comforting language to respond to the event), mindfulness (awareness of the negative emotions elicited by the situation), and common humanity (how the experience is part of the human condition). === Identifying what we really want === In this exercise, the user is asked to think about the ways that they use self-criticism as a way to motivate themself. Then, the user is asked to try to come up with a kinder and gentler and more caring way of motivating themself to make the desired change, and to try and be aware of how they use self-criticism as a motivational tool in the future. === Taking care of the caregiver === This exercise prompts the user to engage in meaningful self-care on a regular basis, and to practice these techniques while they are actively caring for others. == Self-forgiveness as an element == Self-forgiveness is an element of self-compassion that involves releasing self-directed negative feelings. Research has found that self-forgiveness promotes greater overall well-being, specifically higher self-esteem and lower neuroticism. === Pro- social behavior === When self-directed negative feelings are a result of negative past action, self-forgiveness does not mean ignoring or excusing offenses, but rather practicing self-compassion while taking full responsibility for past action. In this way, self-forgiveness may increase people's willingness to repent for wrongdoing. Despite this research, there is not yet a clear link between self-forgiveness and pro-social behavior. It would seem that accepting responsibility for negative actions leads to pro- social behavior, and coupling acceptance with self-forgiveness increases this effect. == Self-acceptance as an element == Self-acceptance is an element of self-compassion that involves accepting oneself for who and what they are. Self-acceptance differs from self-esteem in that self-esteem involves globally evaluating one's worth. Self-acceptance means accepting the self despite flaws, weaknesses, and negative evaluations from others. ==Mindfulness == ===History === The concept of mindfulness and self-compassion has been around for over 2500 years, and is rooted in Eastern traditional Buddhist philosophy and Buddhist meditation. In Buddhist philosophy, mindfulness and compassion is considered to be two wings of one bird, with each concept overlapping one another but producing benefits for wellbeing. The word Mindfulness is the English translation of the word Vipassan, which a combination of two words Vi, meaning in a special way and Passana, to observe, hence implying to observe in a special way.Nehra, D. K., Nehra, S., & Dogra, R. (2012). Positive psychological functioning with mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) program. Biopsychosocial issues in positive health. Delhi: Global Vision Publishing House. from http://globalvisionpub.com/globaljournalmanager/pdf/1389680520.pdf Compassion (karunaa) can be defined as an emotion that elicits the wanting to be free from suffering. Mindfulness in the context of self-compassion comprises acknowledging one's painful experiences in a balanced way that neither ignores, or ruminates on the disliked characteristics of oneself or life. According to Neff (2012) it is essential to be mindful of one's own personal suffering in order to extend compassion towards one's self. However it is essential to pay attention to self suffering in a grounded way in order to avoid \\"over-identification\\". Mindfulness tends to focus on the internal experience such as sensation, emotion and thoughts rather than focusing on the experiencer. Self-compassion focuses on soothing and comforting the self when faced with distressing experiences. Self-compassion is composed of three components; self kindness versus self-judgement, a sense of common humanity versus isolation and mindfulness versus over-identification when confronting painful thoughts and emotions. ===Mindfulness-based stress reduction === Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn is a structured group program that uses mindfulness meditation to relieve suffering associated with physical, psychosomatic and psychiatric disorders. Mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy seeks to increase the capacity for mindfulness, by reducing the need for self-focused thoughts and emotions that can lead to poor mental health. The exercise of mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy brings together the elements of meditation and yoga, greater awareness of the unity of mind and body, as well as the ways that the unconscious thoughts, feelings, and behaviors can undermine emotional, physical, and spiritual health.Mindfullivingprograms.com,. (2015). Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction. Retrieved 2 August 2015, from Clinical research from the past 25 years has found that MBSR is efficacious in reducing distress and enhancing individual well-being. Self-Compassion can play a critical role in mindfulness-based cognitive therapy interventions. In the study Shapiro et al. (2005) found that health care professionals who underwent a MBSR program reported significantly increased self-compassion and reduced stress levels compared to the waitlist control group. It was also reported that the increase of self-compassion appeared to reduce stress associated with the program. ===Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy === Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is an intervention therapy that combines meditation practices, psycho- education and cognitive behavioral strategies to prevent the relapse or recurrence of major depression.Segal, Z., Williams, J., & Teasdale, J. (2009). Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for depression (pp. 307-312). New York, NY: Guilford Press. MBCT teaches individuals how to observe their thoughts and feelings by focusing their attention on natural objects, such as breathing and bodily sensations. Individuals are taught how to achieve awareness while holding an attitude of non-judgemental acceptance. Within MBCT, mindfulness skills are taught in order to recognize distressing thoughts and feelings, to be aware of these experiences, and utilize acceptance and self-compassion to break up associative networks that may cause a relapse. Self-compassion in response to negative thoughts and feelings is an adaptive process, which validates it as a key learning skill in MBCT. Self-compassion has been found to be a key mechanism in the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions such as mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT). Kuyken et al. (2010) compared the effect of MBCT with maintenance antidepressants on relapse in depressive symptoms. They found that mindfulness and self-compassion were increased after MBCT was introduced. They also found that MBCT reduced the connection of cognitive reactivity and depressive relapse, and that the increased self-compassion helped mediate this association. === Mindfulness- based pain management === Mindfulness-based pain management (MBPM) is a mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) providing specific applications for people living with chronic pain and illness. Adapting the core concepts and practices of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), MBPM includes a distinctive emphasis on the practice of 'loving-kindness', and has been seen as sensitive to concerns about removing mindfulness teaching from its original ethical framework within Buddhism. It was developed by Vidyamala Burch and is delivered through the programs of Breathworks. It has been subject to a range of clinical studies demonstrating its effectiveness. ===Mindful self-compassion therapy === Mindful self-compassion (MSC) therapy is a hybrid therapy consisting of self- compassion and mindfulness practices. The term mindful is referred to in the MSC program as the basic mindfulness skills which is turning toward painful thoughts and emotions and seeing them as they are without suppression or avoidance which is crucial to the development of self-compassion. The MSC program however focuses more on self-compassion and sees mindfulness as a secondary emphasis. MSC teaches both formal (meditation) and informal (daily life) self-compassion practices. In addition there are homework MSC assignments that teaches participants to be kinder to themselves. The goal of MSC therapy is to provide participants with a variety of tools to increase self-compassion which they can then in turn integrate into their lives. A study conducted by Neff and Germer (2012) found that compared with the control group, MSC intervention participants reported significantly larger increases in self-compassion, mindfulness, wellbeing and a decrease in depression, stress and anxiety which were maintained for 6 months after the initial intervention. ===Compassion focused therapy === Paul Gilbert (2009) developed compassion focused therapy (CFT) that teaches clients that, due to how our brains have evolved, anxiety, anger and depression are natural experiences that are occur through no fault of our own. Patients are trained to change maladaptive thought patterns such as \\"I'm unlovable\\" and provide alternative self-statements, such as \\"know for sure that some people love me\\". The goal of CFT is to help patients develop a sense of warmth and emotional responsiveness to oneself. This is achieved through a variety of exercises including visualization, cultivating self-kindest through language by engaging in self- compassionate behaviors and habits. In CFT self-compassion is utilized through thoughts, images, and attention which is needed to stimulate and develop the contentment, sooth and safeness system. ===Mindfulness skills in dialectical behavior therapy === Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), is a derivative of cognitive behavior therapy that incorporates Eastern meditative practice. DBT is based on a dialectical world view that incorporates the balance and integration of opposing beliefs, particularly in acceptance and change. We accept ourselves as good enough, and we recognize the need for all of us to change and grow. Unlike MBCT and MBSR therapies, dialectical behavior therapy does not use meditation but less formal exercises, such as individual therapy sessions and group skill sessions. In general last for approximately a year where participants will engage in weekly individual skill therapy sessions and group skill sessions.Baer, R. (2006). Mindfulness-based treatment approaches. Amsterdam: Elsevier, Academic Press. The skills therapy sessions include four segments; core mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness, emotion regulation, and distress tolerance skills. Dialectical behaviour therapist recommend developing self-compassion. The basic premise of using self-compassion therapies in DBT is to cultivate a compassionate mind state, defined by feelings of warmth, safety, presence and interconnectedness that can in turn relieve emotional dysregulation. ===Mindfulness and related skills in acceptance and commitment therapy === Acceptance and commitment therapy utilizes behavior change process, mindfulness and acceptance process. ACT, involves non-judgmental awareness and openness to cognitive sensation an emotional experiences. It also promotes exposure to previously avoided situations that have caused anxiety in order to promote acceptance. The avoidant behavior is treated by having clients observing their thoughts and accepting that their thoughts are not necessarily harmful. In general ACT strategies are customized to fit each participant so they obtain psycho- education, problem solving skills and psychological flexibility. Mindfulness and acceptance exercises and skills facilitate the behavioral changes necessary for its user to pursue a life that they feel is vital and meaningful. Various sources have indicated that acceptance and commitment therapy overlaps with Neff's conceptualization of self compassion particularly ACT's relational frame theory. The basic theories and concepts underlining ACT, may be relevant and have shown to be parallels and hold similarities found in self-compassion The first is ACT's perspective and Neff's concept of self-kindness are both linked to self-acceptance. Acceptance of one's painful experiences and hurt is related to kindness to one's self. Second Neff's conceptualization of self-compassion and ACT both emphasize mindfulness, which is practiced in ACT through the concepts of defusion, acceptance, contact with the present moment and the self as a context. Defusion is also used in self- compassion as a means of allowing self-criticisms to pass through the mind without believing, proving them wrong or engaging in a stance to make these thoughts workable. In a study conducted by Yadavaia, Hayes & Vilardaga, 2014 test the efficacy of an ACT approach to self-compassion as compared to a waitlist control, the study showed that ACT interventions led to a large increase in self-compassion and psychopathology compared to the waitlist control at post-treatment and two months post intervention. ==See also== * Self * Self-acceptance * Self-awareness * Self-concept * Self-esteem * Self- image * Self-love ==References== ==External links== *Self-Compassion Category:Self Category:Spiritual faculties Category:Mindfulness movement ","title":"Self-compassion"},{"id":"11643542","text":"The term safe work procedure (SWP) originated in Victoria, Australia, and is predominantly used as a risk management tool by industries throughout Australia, particularly in the mining sector.

It strongly emphasizes the communication about software- intensive systems by using a semi-formal graphical notation that can easily be understood. == Introduction == FMC distinguishes three perspectives to look at a software system: * Structure of the system * Processes in the system * Value domains of the system FMC defines a dedicated diagram type for each perspective. FMC diagrams use a simple and lean notation. The purpose of FMC diagrams is to facilitate the communication about a software system, not only between technical experts but also between technical experts and business or domain experts. The comprehensibility of FMC diagrams has made them famous among its supporters. The common approach when working with FMC is to start with a high-level diagram of the compositional structure of a system. This ‚Äúbig picture‚Äù diagram serves as a reference in the communication with all involved stakeholders of the project. Later on, the high-level diagram is iteratively refined to model technical details of the system. Complementary diagrams for processes observed in the system or value domains found in the system are introduced as needed. == Diagram Types == FMC uses three diagram types to model different aspects of a system: *Compositional Structure Diagram depicts the static structure of a system. This diagram type is also known as FMC Block Diagram *Dynamic Structure Diagram depicts processes that can be observed in a system. This diagram type is also known as FMC Petri-net *Value Range Structure Diagram depicts structures of values found in the system. This diagram type is also known as FMC E/R Diagram All FMC diagrams are bipartite graphs. Each bipartite graph consists of two disjoint sets of vertices with the condition that no vertex is connected to another vertex of the same set. In FMC diagrams, members of one set are represented by angular shapes, and members of the other set are represented by curved shapes. Each element in an FMC diagram can be refined by another diagram of the same type, provided that the combined graph is also bipartite. This mechanism allows modeling all relevant layers of abstraction with the same notation. === Compositional Structure Diagram === Example of FMC Compositional Structure Diagram Compositional structure diagrams depict the static structure of a system, and the relationships between system components. System components can be active or passive. Agents are active system components. They perform activities in the system. Storages and channels are passive components which store or transmit information. The image to the right is an example of a compositional structure diagram. It contains the agents Order Processor, Supplier Manager, Supplier, Online Shop and an unnamed human agent. Agents are represented by rectangles. The dots and the shadow of the agent Supplier indicate that this agent has multiple instances, i.e. the Supplier Manager communicates with one or many suppliers. The so-called human agent represents a user interacting with the system. The diagram contains the storages Orders, Purchase Order and Product Catalog. Storages are represented by curved shapes. Agents can read from storages, write to storages or modify the content of storages. The directions of the arrows indicate which operation is performed by an agent. In the diagram, the Supplier Manager can modify the content of the Product Catalog, whereas the Order Processor can only read the content of the Product Catalog. Agents communicate via channels. The direction of information flow is either indicated by arrows (not shown in the picture), by a request-response- symbol (e.g. between Supplier Manager and Supplier) or omitted (e.g. between Order Processor and Supplier Manager). === Dynamic Structure Diagram === Dynamic structures are derived from petri nets. :\\"They are used to express system behavior over time, depicting the actions performed by the agents.

It is migratory wintering through most of Australia, with some birds reaching New Guinea and Indonesia. It is increasingly a wanderer to New Zealand, where it may have bred. This species is frequently placed in the genus Hirundo as Hirundo ariel. It is monotypic. This is a bird of open country near water, and is usually seen near its nest sites in cliffs, culverts or bridges. ==Description== The fairy martin is dumpy and square tailed. It averages 12 cm long and weighs 11 g. The adult has an iridescent blue back, brown wings and tail, a rufous crown and nape, and a whitish rump. The underparts are dull white. The sexes are similar, but young birds are duller and browner, with a paler forehead and pale fringes to the back and wing feathers. This species can be distinguished from other Australian swallows by its pale rump. The most similar species, the tree martin, has a shallowly forked tail and blue-black head and nape. The call of this vocal swallow is a chrrrr and the song is a high-pitched twitter. The vocalizations are higher pitched than those of the tree martin. ==Behaviour== Dayboro, SE Queensland, Australia Fairy martins breed from August through to January in colonies usually of a few tens of nests, but the largest known site had 700 nests. Nests are constructed in natural holes in dead trees, riverbanks, cliff faces or rock crevices, but increasingly in artificial sites on bridges, in culverts and pipes, and on buildings. The nest is a retort or bottle shaped structure, made from up to 1000 mud pellets and lined with dried grasses and feathers. The bowl is about 15 cm in diameter, and the entrance tunnel is 5‚Äì30 cm long. The nests in a colony are clustered together. Both sexes build the nest and share incubation and care of the young. The clutch is usually four, sometimes five, reddish-brown speckled white eggs, and this species is often double or triple brooded. The fairy martin feeds high in the air on flying insects, usually in large flocks. Fairy martins have a slow fluttering flight and feed higher than welcome swallows. They will also feed on insect swarms low over water, and have been recorded feeding on injured moths on a newly cut lawn. This species is highly gregarious and forms large flocks, often with tree martins. == Ecology == Nests When the mud nest is vacated after breeding, it may become occupied by several species of microbats. These opportunists include the wattle bats of genus Chalinolobus, Chalinolobus morio, C. dwyeri and C. gouldii, and the small long-eared Nyctophilus geoffroyi. == References == * *Birds in backyards fairy martin Category:Birds of Australia fairy martin Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Fairy martin"},{"id":"11643788","text":"Zac Tubbs (born May 14, 1984) is a former Division I athlete who earned athletic honors on the high school, collegiate, and professional level.

His feast day is commemorated on April 8. ==Date== The date is established by the fact that he wrote to Pope St Soter.Pope from around 168 to 176; Harnack gives 165-67 to 173‚Äì5. Eusebius in his Chronicle placed his \\"floruit\\" in the eleventh year of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius (171). When Hegesippus was at Corinth in the time of Pope Anicetus, Primus was bishop (about 150-5), while Bacchyllus was Bishop of Corinth at the time of the Paschal controversy (about 190-8). Dionysius is only known to us through Eusebius. Eusebius knew a collection of seven of the Catholic Letters to the Churches of Dionysius, together with a letter to him from Pinytus, Bishop of Knossus, and a private letter of spiritual advice to a lady named Chrysophora.Chapman, John. \\"St. Dionysius.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 30 June 2019 Eusebius mentions (1) a letter to the Lacedaemonians, teaching orthodoxy, and enjoining peace and union. (2) Another letter was to the Athenians, stirring up their faith exhorting them to live according to the Gospel, since they were not far from apostasy. Dionysius spoke of the recent martyrdom of their bishop, Publius (in the persecution of Marcus Aurelius), and says that Dionysius the Areopagite was the first Bishop of Athens. (3) To the Nicomedians he wrote against Marcionism. (4) Writing to Gortyna and the other dioceses of Crete, he praised their bishop, Philip, for efforts on behalf of the church then warned him of the distortions of heretics. (5) To the Church of Amastris in Pontus he wrote at the instance of Bacchylides and Elpistus (otherwise unknown), mentioning the bishop's name as Palmas; he wrote in this letter of marriage and celibacy, and recommended the charitable treatment of those who had fallen away into sin or heresy. (6) In a letter to Pinytus, bishop of Knossus, he recommended that he should not lay the yoke of celibacy too heavily on his brethren, but consider the weakness most of them have. Pinytus replied, after polite words, that he hoped Dionysius would send strong meat next time so his people might not grow up on the milk of babes. But the most important letter is the seventh one, addressed to the Romans, and the only one from which extracts have been preserved. Pope Soter had sent alms and a letter to the Corinthians, and in response Dionysius wrote: :For this has been your custom from the beginning, to do good to all the brethren in many ways, and to send alms to many Churches in different cities, now relieving the poverty of those who asked aid, now assisting the brethren in the mines by the alms you send, Romans keeping up the traditional custom of Romans, which your blessed bishop, Soter, has not only maintained, but has even increased, by affording to the brethren the abundance which he has supplied, and by comforting with blessed words the brethren who came to him, as a father his children.The second extract is from H.E. 2.26; the rest are preserved in H.E. 4.23. Again: :You also by this instruction have mingled together the Romans and Corinthians who are the planting of Peter and Paul. For they both came to our Corinth and planted us, and taught alike; and alike going to Italy and teaching there, were martyred at the same time. Again: :Today we have kept the holy Lord's day, on which we have read your letter, which we shall ever possess to read and to be admonished, even as the former one written to us through Clement. The witness to the martyrdom of Sts. Peter and Paul, kata ton auton kairon, is of importance, and so is the mention of the Epistle of Clement and the public reading of it. The letter of the pope was written \\"as a father to his children\\". Dionysius's own letters were evidently much prized, for in the last extract from this letter he writes that he wrote them by request, and that they have been falsified \\"by the apostles of the devil\\". \\"Small wonder then\\", he observes, \\"if some have dared to tamper even with the word of the Lord himself, when they have conspired to mutilate my own humble efforts.\\" ==References== ==Sources== *Urdang, Laurence.

The Irvington neighborhood in Portland, Oregon is named in his honor and in New Westminster, British Columbia his home, \\"Irving House\\", is now a heritage site.nwpr page He was one of the earliest pioneers of steamer travel in the Pacific Northwest and is remembered as one of the most successful and popular captains of the era. ==Early years== William Irving was born in 1816 in Annan, Dumfriesshire Scotland.Samson Irving obituary In 1831, he journeyed to Boston, Massachusetts and by the age of twenty-five he was a licensed steamship captain.Irvington Community Association ==Oregon== In 1849 he traveled to Oregon, stopping along the way in Sacramento, California, where he worked unloading cargo during the California Gold Rush before continuing on to Portland. He purchased Block 12 of the Portland townsite and began a transportation business that delivered lumber by steamer up from California to Portland. In 1851 he married 18-year- old Elizabeth Dixon who had just arrived in Oregon from Indiana the previous year. William built his new bride a large house along the river and they stayed there for nine years and had five children: Mary, John, Susan, Elizabeth, and Nellie. When the family moved to British Columbia in 1859, their Portland home was taken over by Elizabeth's sister and her husband, George Shaver and would be called the \\"Shaver House\\". After his death in 1872, his wife would return to Portland and continue to manage the family's holdings. His daughter Elizabeth would marry and also build a home in the neighborhood in 1884, named the \\"Spencer House\\", which still exists today and has the honor of being the oldest in the neighborhood. ==British Columbia== In 1859, William Irving and his family moved to Victoria, where he became a partner in the Victoria Steam Navigation Company and built two sternwheelers, the Governor Douglas and the Colonel Moody to serve between New Westminster and Victoria. However, Irving did not have a monopoly on the route and rate wars soon erupted between him and his main rival, Captain William Moore who was running his Henrietta on the same route. By that September, freight rates, which had begun at $12 at ton, dropped to 50 cents a ton and fares, which had been $10 a passenger also dropped to 50 cents. Yale (1880) By 1860, when the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush was starting to decline, more than a dozen sternwheelers were working in the on the Fraser River between New Westminster, Fort Hope and Port Douglas and more were arriving from American waters or were being built locally. Finally the individual owners got together and put an end to the rivalry by cooperatively increasing their rates. In 1862, news of the gold strikes in the Cariboo Gold Rush brought 4,000 miners to the area and the rate wars began anew. Irving sold his boats to John Wright and William Moore left to go work on the Stikine River, briefly putting an end to their rivalry. Irving immediately had another sternwheeler built, the Reliance and was kept busy shipping miners and supplies to Yale where they could travel on the nearly completed Cariboo Wagon Road to the goldfields at Barkerville. In 1863 and '64 rate wars erupted again when Irving's old rival, Moore returned from the Stikine River, rich with profits and ready to take on the new Reliance with his Flying Dutchman and Alexandra. Nevertheless, Irving managed to keep most of his customers and Moore claimed bankruptcy and his boats were taken from service. Captain William Irving moved his family to New Westminster, into their new house at 302 Royal Avenue, on August 5, 1865. This house is preserved as Irving House and is the oldest intact house in the Lower mainland of British Columbia. By 1865, there were only four sternwheelers on the lower Fraser River, Irving's Reliance and Onward and Captain Fleming's Lillooet and Hope. The two captains agreed to run their sternwheelers on alternate years and take an equal share of the profits. 1871 was the year that British Columbia went from being the Colony of British Columbia and became a province in Canada, an arrangement that included the promise of a railway constructed to the coast. The construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway would breathe new life into the area and make the faltering river trade profitable again. Tragically, William Irving would not live long enough to enjoy the prosperity of this new era. He died on August 28, 1872 at New Westminster. On the day of his funeral all of the flags in town were flown at half-mast and all of the stores were closed. He is buried at the Fraser Cemetery in New Westminster.A Virtual Tour of Fraser Cemetery Captain William Irving Although he was only eighteen, William's son, John Irving, would take over his father's business and become every bit as successful in the river trade in British Columbia in the following decades.Samson Captains ==Notes== ==Further reading== * Paddlewheels on the Frontier Volume One Art Downs * Captain William Moore BC's Amazing Frontiersman Norman Hacking . ==External links== *Irvington, Oregon *Irving House *William Irving obituary *Fraser Cemetery New Westminster Category:Steamship captains Category:History of British Columbia Category:History of transportation in Oregon Category:1816 births Category:1872 deaths Category:People from Annan, Dumfries and Galloway ","title":"William Irving (steamship captain)"},{"id":"11643809","text":"Enigform is a Mozilla Firefox extension authored by Arturo 'Buanzo' Busleiman which uses GnuPG to implement OpenPGP-signed HTTP requests.

The Brandenburg Navy was the navy of the Margraviate of Brandenburg in Germany from the 16th century to 1701, when it became part of the Prussian Navy. The Navy was originally assembled as the Hohenzollern rulers of Brandenburg began to increase in importance and to desire the prestige and security of having a suitable naval defence force. During the 17th century, the navy was of great use in numerous battles in the Baltic Sea, and it also served the interests of Brandenburg's colonies in Africa (specifically the Brandenburger Gold Coast) and the Caribbean. By the year 1680, the Brandenburg Navy had almost thirty active warships. These ships were used primarily to secure control over hostile trade routes and maritime trading, as blockades and to provide naval defence, and to also provide reinforcement on various military operations, which would frequently involve engagements with unfriendly warships. In 1682, Frederick William, the prince-elector of Brandenburg, who was intensely involved in the navy's affairs, secured the navy a base at Greetsiel, but they shifted to Emden a year later. Frederick William died in 1688, and his descendants took no interest in the Brandenburg Navy. Frederick III and his grandson Frederick the Great recognized that they could never compete directly with the great maritime powers and concentrated instead on building the best army in Europe while maintaining good relations with naval powers such as Denmark and the Netherlands. The overseas colonies were eventually sold to the Dutch in 1721. In 1701, Frederick was crowned King in Prussia, marking a shift from Brandenburg to Prussia as the most important Hohenzollern realm. The Brandenburg Navy was consequently merged into the Prussian Navy that year. == Ships in the Brandenburg Navy == Frederick William of Brandenburg.

He was present at the Battle of the Somme, the Battle of Arras and the Third Battle of Ypres. Lo√überg was born in Bad Homburg in Hesse-Nassau.

Some of the OHL staff foresaw that with more guns and ammunition the French and British preliminary barrages would soon be converting their crowded front line into a slaughterhouse. Their thinking was stimulated by instructions captured from the French Fifth Army in May 1915 stipulating three lines of defense. The first line was manned by sentry groups, with listening posts in front. It was to be strongly built but lightly garrisoned. If attackers broke through they would face a second, main line of resistance, which included dugouts to accommodate all of the defenders of the first two lines. A third line incorporated shell-proof shelters for the reserves with the artillery just behind it.Wynne, 1940, pp. 98-99. On the OHL staff colonels Max Bauer and Bussche and captains Geyer and Harbou liked the idea of defense in depth and discussed making it flexible, by permitting the garrison of the front line to retreat to join the main line of resistance if the front was breached.Meyer, 1981, p. 33. Lo√überg argued against elasticity, because he had been impressed in battle by the demoralizing effect of fleeing men. ==Chief of staff== ===3rd Army=== In September 1915 the French attacked in Champagne, east of Reims along a front of , advancing behind a cloud of poison gas and smoke. The German 3rd Army was driven out of their front line, their chief of staff proposed to withdraw further to shelter behind a river. He was replaced by Lo√überg, who just as he arrived at army headquarters was telephoned by a corps commander asking whether they would still withdraw that night. Lo√überg ordered him to hold where they were. A few minutes later he met his commander, General Karl von Einem, who endorsed the cancellation and agreed that Lo√überg might go immediately to the front with full powers. The French were sure to attack again once they had moved their artillery forward. When Lo√überg arrived at the height on the north side of the valley they had been driven into, he was immediately struck by the strength of the position they had been forced to occupy. They were now defending a reserve trench on a reverse slope beneath the crest. The line was hidden from French observation and the defenders could shoot down attackers as they emerged over the crest. Its flaw was that the German artillery observers, usually placed in the front line, were also blind. Lo√überg ordered the observers to set up their positions along the crest where he was standing, which gave them a perfect view of the slope opposite where attackers would appear and they would no longer work in the noisy, smoky confusion of the front line during an attack. The reserves were placed just behind the northern hill, Lo√überg ordered shelters to be built for them. Pickets were dotted along the crest of the hill facing the French. These depositions fit perfectly to his belief that the \\"Strength of the defense lies in concealment from enemy observation\\".Wynne, 1940, p. 332. Then he motored to the headquarters of each of his corps to direct them to position their lines similarly. The new defense stymied further French attacks. ===2nd Army=== When the British and French attacked at the opening of the Battle of the Somme, Falkenhayn summoned Lo√überg to his bedside at 0100 to ask him to take over as chief of staff of the 2nd Army, the southernmost on the attacked front, where the French had penetrated.Lossberg, 1939, p. 215. Lo√überg would agree only if the German attacks at the Battle of Verdun were stopped. Falkenhayn shook hands‚Äîbut never kept his promise.Wynne, 1940, p. 118. At 2nd Army headquarters its commander, Fritz von Below, gave Lo√überg permission to go to front with full power to issue commands. When Lo√überg saw how the original front line trenches had been utterly demolished by the enemy barrage, he ordered the defenders to stand where they were but to adopt a mobile defense in depth. The front line was to be held lightly, with the defenders moving forward into shell holes as soon as a bombardment began. The artillery observers were moved behind the main line of resistance to heights where the reserves for the battalion holding the sector were also sheltered. Enemy penetrations would be driven back by counter-attacks. If possible an immediate counter-attack would be launched by the two reserve battalions of the regiment holding the sector. It would be led by the front-line battalion commander, who knew the conditions best. Close behind the front Lo√überg stationed counter-attack divisions. In Lo√überg's system, corps, which had contained a set trio of divisions, became responsible for the length of front held by three divisions: the divisions making up the corps were changed if necessary, but the corps remained responsible for its terrain. If an attack threatened, Lo√überg tried to be in the front line at daybreak to gauge morale. Most days Bellow and Lo√überg visited a section of the front, except during attacks when they had to be at the telephone exchange. They were careful to relieve divisions when they had given their all. After Hindenburg and Ludendorff took over OHL on 29 August 1916, Lo√überg was delighted to watch the spirit of the army revive.Lossberg, 1939, p. 359. The German attacks on Verdun were stopped immediately. Unlike their predecessors Moltke and Falkenhayn, the new team solicited and freely discussed ideas.Rupprecht, 1929, p. 3 Lo√überg was asked for a report describing his defensive tactics. In September construction began on a new backup line well behind the current front, which the enemy called the Hindenburg line. It was built with all recent refinements, including shallow dugouts with concrete roofs that could be left quickly when attacks began. When Lo√überg motored through the almost completed line he saw that the artillery observation posts were built into the front line trenches, which therefore were on a forward slope exposed to enemy ground observers. Supported by Below and their Army Group Commander the Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria, Lo√überg successfully argued for building a new front line, wherever possible on a reverse slope, with positions for a light line of first resistance on the crest, so now the artillery observers were in the second line, overlooking the enemy. OHL issued a paper the \\"Conduct of the Defensive Battle\\" on 1 December 1916. Mostly written by junior staff officers, it incorporated many of Lo√überg's ideas for mobile defense in depth but also recommended elasticity: permitting the defenders of the front line to retreat if forced. Lo√überg still strongly opposed elasticity in his report that OHL published on 30 January 1917. ===6th Army=== The British attacked the 6th Army near Arras on 9 April 1917, advancing behind a creeping barrage for almost , capturing the heights of Vimy Ridge, which gave their observers a commanding view over the Douai Plain.Meyer, 1981, p. 67. On 11 April, Lo√überg was made chief of staff of the 6th Army. He found the defenders in chaos but in the Crown Prince Rupprecht's words he was \\"almost superhumanly imperturbable\\".Wynne, 1940, p. 206. He swiftly organized new defensive lines, telephoning Ludendorff that this time the defense would be elastic because the front line was so readily observed. If forced the front line defenders would withdraw and the battle would be fought at the second line, which was mostly on a reverse slope, easily observed by artillery observers. Counter-attacking infantry were now using stormtrooper tactics. When reserve divisions advanced from the artillery protection line to counter-attack, they came under the command of the division they were supporting. Repeated British attacks gained no significant ground. ===4th Army=== After the brilliant British capture of the Messines Ridge on 8 June 1917, Ludendorff asked Lo√überg to move to Flanders as chief of staff of the Fourth Army, commanded by General Friedrich Sixt von Armin. Lo√überg knew the typography of the Ypres Salient from 1914. For the first time he could organize a mobile defense in depth before an attack began.Meyer, 1981, p. 71. He strove to make the defenders invisible to attackers on the ground and even to their aerial observers. As soon as the bombardment began the men in the foremost line left their trenches to shelter in shell holes scattered randomly about in front of the line that the British artillery was smashing. These defenders were provided with boards so they could shelter above the ground water that filled the bottoms of the holes and with corrugated iron and canvas for crude roofs. They were to fight to the end from these holes with their light machine guns. The second line of resistance was about behind the front, near the effective limit of the enemy's field guns. It had concrete nests for heavy machine guns and shelters for riflemen, mortar crews and light machine gunners but if the attackers broke through, most of the defenders moved into shell holes so they could strike from unexpected directions. They also were to hold their positions even if their line was penetrated. Before successful attackers reached the artillery protection line, they would be met by counter- attackers from the reserve division. The 14-day, 6-million-shell bombardment ended on 31 July 1917; the British anticipated that their infantry would advance on the first day. By midday the surviving attackers were penetrating the second line of resistance when they were smashed into by counter- attackers, who pushed them back even as the rain began to pour down, the start of dismal, sodden, bloody weeks. The day after the attack, Lo√überg was promoted to Major-General. On 16 August, the British attacked again but with orders to advance only before digging in to repel counter-attacks. Such bite and hold tactics forced the Germans to change also. Ludendorff, who increasing directed the defense, placed more men in the foremost line and waited until the following day to mount a carefully organized counter-attack. The British artillery overwhelmed the foremost defenders and their immediate supports. On 7 October the Germans returned to a lightly held front which would retire to the main resistance line where they would be joined by counter-attack troops, while a dense artillery barrage would be laid in front of the main resistance line. The emphasis was still on a mobile defense, companies were assigned zones, rather than lines, to defend. After Ludendorff took responsibility, Lo√überg does not describe the further changes in his book, which was based on a diary. Their final configuration was that each front division should establish a main line of resistance behind the front. It consisted of strong points which would hold out even if the line was breached. Heavy machine guns, working in pairs, were just behind this position, along with a few field guns as anti-tank weapons. The battle zone extended to a depth of behind the front; it was dotted with points of resistance that if necessary would be held until relieved by the counter-attack. Since the maximum range of field artillery was attackers nearing the end of the battle zone could only be supported by their heavier guns. A reserve division was in position close behind this battle zone. If it launched a counter-attack it was led by the commander of the division at the front.Wynne, 1940, pp. 310‚Äì313. This defensive doctrine was carried over after the end of World War I. After enormous sacrifice, by bite and hold, the British took the Passchendaele Ridge on 30 November 1917. Now they faced another strong line of German field works while still another behind that was close to completion. ===1918=== Lo√überg retired to this house in L√ºbeck. Lo√überg wrote little in his memoirs about 1918, the year in which the Germans launched their astonishing breakthrough offensives on the Western Front, starting with Operation Michael which smashed through the British lines near Cambrai. It created a vast salient that increased the length of the German defensive front but failed to take any strategic objective. Lo√überg urged OHL to withdraw from the useless but costly salient but they did not. The next offensive was by the 4th Army in Flanders, in which Lo√überg was chief of staff, at the Battle of the Lys. There was another brilliant breakthrough, which after the initial successes was stalled by reserves manning a stout mobile defense in depth. On Lo√überg's advice they stopped attacking even though they had not reached the major railway junction that was their objective.Churchill, 1949, p. 800 OHL then shifted the attack to Champagne, to draw away the French troops who had been sent to help the British in Flanders. The German advance in the Third Battle of the Aisne was the most remarkable yet, they reached the right bank of the River Marne, only from Paris, which the French government prepared to evacuate. OHL decided that they must enlarge this salient, so they would be able to bring forward enough supplies to drive on to Paris. On part of the sector assaulted the French front line was lightly held and easily overrun but as they thrust forward the attackers unexpectedly encountered the main line of resistance, beyond the range of the German field guns, where they were stopped. OHL decided to strike again in Flanders, to finish off the British. Ludendorff came on 18 July 1918 to discuss the next operation with the commanders there, including Rupprecht and Lo√überg, who found Ludendorff \\"aggressive and confident\\".Lossberg, 1939, p. 343. His mood was shattered by a telephone call reporting that the French and Americans had smashed through the right flank of the salient pointing toward Paris, on the opening day of the Battle of Soissons. Everyone in the room realized that they had lost the war. There were no more German attacks; OHL was forced slowly to withdraw their Western Front, hoping to establish a shorter defensive line that could be held. First they had to evacuate all of their wounded, then essential supplies like food and ammunition, and finally the fighting troops, who were being assaulted all along the front. They reorganized for withdrawing, on 8 August, Lo√überg became chief of staff of Army Group von B√∂hn, made up of the 2nd, 18th, and 9th Armies. Early in November he was reassigned to OHL. The Armistice specified that all German troops still remaining in France, Belgium, Luxembourg or Alsace-Lorraine after 14 days would become prisoners of war. They were all out in time, a final display of the organizational skill of the German staffs. ==Post war== In the small post- war German Army, the , Lo√überg was first in charge of defending the new eastern border with Poland.Fisher, 1996, pp. 440‚Äì441 Then he became general chief of staff and later commanded the 6th Division. He retired in 1927 as a general of infantry and died in L√ºbeck on 14 May 1942. His son Bernhard was also a general staff officer, known for the Lossberg study for the invasion of Russia. ==Decorations and awards== Lo√überg was an honorary citizen of Bad Homburg, his town and received medals and decorations: * Iron Cross of 1914, 1st and 2nd class * Pour le M√©rite (21 September 1916) with oak leaves (24 April 1917) * Order of the Red Eagle, 4th class * Order of the Crown, 3rd class (Prussia) * Knight's Cross of the Royal House Order of Hohenzollern with Swords * Service Award (Prussia) * Honor Cross 2nd Class of the Princely House Order of Hohenzollern with Swords * Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Max Joseph (Bavaria) * Military Merit Order, 3rd class with Swords and Crown (Bavaria) * Commander's Cross Second Class of the Military Order of St. Henry (Saxony) * Knight's Cross Second Class of the Albert Order with Swords (Saxony) * Commander of the Military Merit Order (W√ºrttemberg) * Knight's Cross of the Order of the Crown (W√ºrttemberg) * Commander Second Class of the Order of the Z√§hringer Lion (Baden) * Bravery Medal (Hesse) * Military Merit Cross, 2nd class (Mecklenburg-Schwerin) * Knight's Cross, First Class of the Order of Henry the Lion * Knight's Cross, First Class of the House and Merit Order of Peter Frederick Louis (Oldenburg) * Commander of the Order of the White Falcon * Hanseatic Cross of Bremen * Commander, First Class of the Ducal Saxe-Ernestine House Order with Swords * Cross for Merit in War (Saxe- Meiningen) ==Footnotes== ==References== Books * * * * * * * * Encyclopedias * Journals * Theses * * ==Further reading== * Translation of Meine T√§tigkeit im Weltkriege 1914‚Äì1918 (Berlin, Mittler und Sohn 1939) ==External links== * Blue Max website * * * Awarded Oakleaves Friedrich Karl von Lo√überg, 24 April 1917 * Genealogy site * Times, 6 October 1917; pg. 5; Issue 41602; col G Through German Eyes.

Micro lathes are related to (full-sized) lathes but are distinguished by their small size and differing capabilities, application, use, and locations. Sometimes referred to as desktop lathes or table-top lathes, micro lathes can be comfortably used in areas where a full-sized lathe would be impractical. Micro lathes are well suited for use in restricted spaces where heavy machining or high accuracy are not requirements. Micro lathes find a place in homes, basements, and garages. As they are a popular tool for hobbyists, they are commonly sold through hobby catalogs and hobby websites. Micro lathes are preferred over larger lathes by some professionals, commonly locksmiths, jewelers, designers, and engineers for prototyping or fabrication work. Despite a more available price point and lower rigidity than their larger counterparts, micro lathes still operate within the required tolerances of many tasks. This makes them particularly useful in applications where small precision pieces are needed for projects like miniature engines that require fine detail and mechanical accuracy. Small ultra-precision and diamond turning lathes exist, but have little in common with a desktop-style micro lathe other than form factor. The smallest CNC micro lathe was made by researchers at the Mechanical Engineering Laboratory of Japan‚Äôs Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and Olympus Optical Co. It is 32 mm long, 25 mm wide, and 30.5 mm high, the lathe weighs just 100 grams. In test runs, the tiny lathe produced a brass needle 0.05 mm wide and 0.6 mm long and screws that are 0.05 mm thick. == Materials == Micro lathes are not commonly used to cut wood. Though accessories for woodcutting are available, a reduced work envelope limits the machine to small projects and increases difficulty. A majority of micro lathes utilize a variable speed electric motor and are usually employed to turn metals such as iron, aluminum, copper, and titanium. Delrin and other free-machining plastics can be effectively cut, but others (such as Acetate and PVC) require experience and specialized knowledge of machining, and are commonly found to be difficult to machine by micro lathe users who are not professional machinists. == References == == Further reading == * *Jeffree, Tony (2003).

Cristea was born in a poor workers family in Gala≈£i. During the Great Depression he participated in the protests organized by the Romanian Communist Party in Bucharest, afterwards being forced by the Siguran≈£a Statului (Romania's secret police) to move back to his native town. He returned to Bucharest in 1931, and in 1933 was admitted into the then-illegal Communist Party. He became member in the Committee of the Bucharest Organization of the Party and, later, he was elected member in the Bureau of the Party Committee of the city. In this period he worked at the Army Pyrotechnics in Bucharest. After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he left for Spain, arriving there in October 1936, during the Battle for Madrid. He joined the Romanian Motorized Artillery Regiment of the XI International Brigade, commanded by Valter Roman. In 1937, he participated in the battles of Brunete, Quinto-Belchite and Teruel. In December 1937, during the latter confrontation, his leg was injured, but Cristea refused to be hospitalized, deciding instead to remain present on the battlefield. Afterwards, he was promoted to captain and became the commander of the \\"Tudor Vladimirescu\\" Battery. At the Battle of the Ebro, he had an important role in the crossing of the river. Demobilized along the other volunteers in December 1938, he continued to fight in Catalonia in January‚ÄìFebruary 1939. In February 1939, Cristea passed into France where he was interned in the Gurs and Argel√®s concentration camps. Along with Joseph Boczov, Mihail Patriciu and other Romanians, he escaped the latter camp on March 28, 1941, after the onset of German occupation.

The reduction of herds was conducted because grazing areas were becoming eroded and deteriorated due to too many animals.Peter Iverson, Dine: A History of the Navajos, 2002, University of New Mexico Press, Chapter 5, \\"Our People Cried\\": 1923-1941. ==Background== In a 1930 report, William Zeh, a forester for the Navajo Reservation, observed there was serious erosion in different parts of the reservation. He suggested a minor reduction in livestock, with an emphasis upon the number of goats. He believed the Navajo way of life was threatened. There was also a drought in the Midwest. By 1933, inappropriate crop cultivation had left the Great Plains susceptible to erosion and dust storms turning it into a Dust Bowl. Thousands of people left the Midwest after their lands literally blew away. John Collier. In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed John Collier as Commissioner of what is now called the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). He had studied issues of Native Americans and hoped to improve their lives. Agreeing with Zeh's and other later analysts, he concluded that the Navajo owned far too many livestock for the carrying capacity of their reservation. The capacity for sheep was about 500,000, but the people owned 2 million in 1931; the sheep provided half the cash income for the individual Navajo. Historians such as Lawrence A. Kuznar have noted that the analysis by Washington was quite thin, and dissent with its conclusions was suppressed. == Navajo and sheep== A modern Navajo woman shows the hair of her sheep to a child. Spanish explorers and colonists had brought sheep and horses to North America and the Southwest for meat, wool, and transport. This was part of the Columbian Exchange, by which products, plants and animals were traded between the hemispheres. By the 18th century, the Navajo had adapted to these new animals, making use of them and developing their own flocks of Navajo-Churro sheep and herds of horses. In the 19th century, the government killed many of the herd animals after defeating the Navajo, whom they forced on the Long Walk and years as prisoners. The United States government and Navajo signed a treaty in 1868 that returned the Navajo people to their traditional lands. Among the provisions of the treaty was giving each Navajo family two sheep, one male and one female, to start breeding their own herds again. The Navajo were good shepherds and increased their number of livestock dramatically over the next 60 years. The government authorized increases in the size of their reservation, and stopped raiding and looting of the Navajo by outsiders. The Navajo marketed their wool both as a raw material and woven into Navajo rugs and blankets. The revenues they earned gave them incentives to increase the number of sheep; from 15,000 in the 1870s, the number rose to 500,000 in the 1920s. A reduction of livestock was against many Navajo traditions, and destroyed a main source of income. For example, the Navajo considered their livestock sacred and integral to their lives. They were given to them by the Holy People. ==Federal reduction plan== Pictures from a report on overgrazing. A Navajo corral in the 1930s. The federal government at first recommended that the numbers of livestock on the reservation be dramatically reduced. The chairman of the Navajo Tribal Council, Thomas Dodge, tried to present the government's arguments to the people. Because of the strong cultural and economic importance of the livestock, he was unable to sway most of the people.Peter Iverson, Dine: A History of the Navajos, 2002, University of New Mexico Press, pp. 147-151 Collier approved a program that resulted in the purchase and removal of more than half of the livestock. Analysts did not understand the deep cultural ties the Navajo had to their herds. Many women suffered economically, often losing their only source of income.Marsha Weisiger, \\"Gendered Injustice: Navajo Livestock Reduction in the New Deal Era,\\" Western Historical Quarterly (2007): 437-455. in JSTOR The Navajo became united in opposition to the program but, after Collier had opponents arrested, they were unable to stop it. The Navajo did not agree with this plan. After purchasing animals, the government sent many animals to market or slaughtered them on the reservation. There was a \\"voluntary\\" program from 1933. In 1935 it became mandatory. The Navajo referred to these events as the Second Long Walk, because they were so destructive on their economy, society and way of life. Historian Brian Dippie notes that the Indian Rights Association denounced Collier as a 'dictator' and accused him of a \\"near reign of terror\\" on the Navajo reservation. Dippie adds, \\"He became an object of 'burning hatred' among the very people whose problems so preoccupied him.\\"Brian W. Dippie, The Vanishing American: White Attitudes and U.S. Indian Policy (1991) pp 333-36, quote p. 335 The long-term result of livestock reduction was strong Navajo opposition to other elements of Collier's Indian New Deal. He encouraged tribes to re-establish their governments, ended allotment of communal lands, and encouraged revival of Native American cultures.Donald A. Grinde Jr, \\"Navajo Opposition to the Indian New Deal,\\" Integrated Education, (1981) 19#3-6, pp: 79-87. ==Outcomes == In the late 1930s, the government established a quota for different types of livestock on specific areas of the reservation. Navajo family grazing ranges were assigned quotas in each area. In the 1950s the Navajo Tribal Government took over administration of the quota system. in 1967 there were 600,000 sheep units. The livestock quota system is still being used today. ==References== * ==Further reading== * Bailey, Garrick and Roberta Bailey.

Initially training as a secretary, Casson began studying medicine at the University of Bristol when she was 32. She received her medical degree in 1926, becoming the first woman to receive one from the University of Bristol. She also attained the Gaskell prize from the Royal Medico-Psychological Association and a diploma in psychological medicine from the University of London. Casson set up a residential clinic for women with mental disorders at Dorset House in Bristol in 1929 with enough residential space for 800 patients, and she opened the first school of occupational therapy in the UK in the same building the following year. She took an active role in the therapeutic activities at Dorset House, even playing a part in the patient's production of Pride and Prejudice. Casson moved control of the school to a non-profit company in 1948, remaining as vice-chairman and medical director. She created the Elizabeth Casson Trust in 1949, intended to improve occupation therapy education and treatment. In 1951, Casson was awarded an OBE for her work at Dorset House and was also made an honorary fellow of the World Federation of Occupational Therapists. A memorial lecture was set up in her name in 1973 with presenters being selected by their peers, and a psychiatric unit was named after her at Bristol's Callington Road Hospital. ==Biography== Casson, known as Elsie, was born on 14 April 1881 in Denbigh, Wales. She was the sixth child of a bank manager and amateur organ- builder, Thomas Casson, from Wales, and his wife Laura Ann. One of her brothers, Lewis Casson, went on to be an actor and theatre director. Whilst living in Denbigh, the family encouraged the seven children to enjoy the arts. In 1891, Thomas decided to set up a business in organ-building and the family moved to London. There, Casson was educated at St Mary's College, Paddington before going to secretarial college at her father's behest. After qualifying, she worked as a secretary for her fathers' organ-building business until his retirement. In 1908, Casson was a working as housing manager for the social reformer, Octavia Hill, taking care of the living conditions of residents at Red Cross Hall in Southwark. For the next five years she organised recreational activities at the hall, focusing on the arts. Octavia Hill's philosophy influenced Casson's work over the following years. In 1911, Casson's uncle, Isambard Owen, vice-chancellor at University of Bristol, promised her a place studying medicine if she could be formally matriculated to the university. She struggled with her Latin exams for two years, but eventually passed them and registered to study medicine on 1 October 1913 at the age of 32. She graduated with her Bachelor of Medicine degree in 1919, and took on a role at the West Hertfordshire Hospital in Hemel Hempstead. There she noticed that patients in the women's wards were enjoying using artistic talents, and decided that such pursuits were important to treatment. She realised that these pursuits were not only keeping the patients occupied but also helping them to gain self-esteem and to work through their issues. Casson became a medical officer at the Holloway Sanatorium in 1921, developing an interest in occupational therapy whilst working there until 1929. In that time she gained a diploma in psychological medicine from the University of London in 1922, achieved her Doctorate of Medicine from the University of Bristol in 1926 (becoming the first woman to do so), and winning the 1927 Gaskell prize from the Royal Medico-Psychological Association. She also helped set up the Standing Committee in Psychological Medicine of the Medical Women's Federation and the Gaskell club for those recipients of the prize. ==Dorset House== In 1926, Casson visited an occupational therapy centre in Bloomingdale Hospital, New York City, whilst on holiday, and decided that the UK needed a similar facility; in the late 1920s, Casson decided to establish one. She borrowed ¬£1000 () from her brother, Lewis, to help set up the occupational therapy centre. Dorset House opened in Clifton, Bristol, in 1929 as a residential centre for women with mental health issues. She expanded Dorset House and on 1 January 1930 the UK's first occupational therapy school, known as Dorset House School opened, and she became medical director herself. The school's course would teach not only the medical subjects such as anatomy and physiology, but also occupational treatments such as weaving, bookbinding, and other crafts, as well as how to organise activities such as country dancing and how these activities applied to occupational therapy. Wonderful cin√© films of these activities can be found at the Dorset House archive held by Oxford Brookes University library. Casson's vision for Dorset House was that of a 'community where every individual was encouraged to feel that she had a real object'. Having seen the benefit, in the United States and at Octavia Hill, she combined medical interventions with education and recreational approaches. She actively involved herself in the daily therapeutic activities, often inspired by her artistic childhood and build closer relationships between patients and staff, creating a community feel. At one point she even cast herself in Dorset House's drama production, playing Mr. William Collins in their 1934 rendition of Pride and Prejudice. Days would be structured so that activities would be planned throughout, with occupational therapy carrying on into evenings and at weekends. A typical day would include breakfast then flower arranging until 10:30, followed by an hour in the occupation room for therapy. After their work, the patients would go for a walk or join in community singing until 2pm. Between 2pm and 8pm there would be more time in the occupation room, a period of rest and time in the garden. At 8 pm there would be community games and country dancing. Casson believed it was important to keep the therapy room separate from the rest of the department, as it was specialised knowledge. She also insisted that certain activities, such as knitting, were not used as it was not sufficient distraction from the patient's fantasy system. Some concern existed that patients would not accept being put to work, but of her 100 patients in 1931, only six refused the therapy. A member (and later fellow) of the British Homeopathy Society, Casson also included homeopathic treatments in her programme for the patients. Dorset House had space for 800 patients in residence during the 1930s, moving to Bromsgrove during World War II. The building was damaged during the war, so in 1946, the School of Occupational Therapy moved to Oxford, whilst the patients moved to Clevedon. To ensure costs were kept down for the patients, Casson subsidised their treatment from her own funds. She began to release control of the projects in 1948, first by passing the school to a nonprofit company with her as vice-president and remaining as medical director. Then, in 1949, Casson created the Elizabeth Casson Trust which focused on occupational therapy treatment and education, with the majority of funds going to Dorset House school. In 1992, the school became part of Oxford Brookes University; the Elizabeth Casson Trust continues to support occupational therapists in professional development activities, service development and leadership. ==Societies== Outside of her work, Casson was a member of Bristol societies. She never lost touch with her Welsh roots, discussing the similarities between Wales and Bristol with the Lord Mayor at a meal in 1931 and becoming president of the Bristol Cambrian Society in 1934. She also became the president of the Soroptimist Club of Bristol between 1938 and 1939 and was vice president of the Bristol branch of the British Social Hygiene Council in 1939. She was an advocate for women working in roles outside offices, suggesting government grants for women who wanted to be nurses or teachers and giving lectures to parents about her work in occupational therapy in 1935. With the Soroptimist club she gave talks to her fellow members, praising the influence of Octavia Hill and explaining that she was interested more in mental health than physical health. She advocated an ordered life and a happy atmosphere for everyone. As the vice president of the Social Hygiene Council, she worked to ensure that the people of Bristol could give better sex education to their children, without shocking them. She did this in part by hosting a series of lectures called \\"Sex Education and the Child\\", investing the profits from the lectures in providing educational materials for those who could not afford them. ==Legacy== In 1951, Casson received an OBE for her work establish Dorset House and was also elected a fellow of the World Federation of Occupational Therapists. She was considered a pioneer in the field of occupational therapy. Casson died in Bristol on 17 December 1954 after suffering with anaemia. The College of Occupational Therapists hold a memorial lecture in her name and the Callington Road Hospital in Bristol has a psychiatric intensive care unit named after her. More recently a beautiful pink rose has been named in her honour and planted in the Red Cross Rose Garden in London. ==References== ==External links== Category:1881 births Category:1954 deaths Category:20th-century English medical doctors Category:Alumni of the University of Bristol Category:People from Denbigh Category:Occupational therapists Category:Members of the Order of the British Empire ","title":"Elizabeth Casson"},{"id":"11644369","text":"The Proteus Operation is a science fiction alternate history novel written by James P. Hogan and published in 1985. The plot concerns time travel by one group which brings Adolf Hitler to power, who then wages and wins World War II; and then another group which tries to prevent the Axis victory in World War II ==Plot== Originally, the First World War was a complete wake-up call for the human race, leading to greater internationalism and a \\"Never Again\\" spirit towards war that would eventually wear away the differences between the various power-blocs. By the 2020s, a global League of Nations oversees a planet totally at peace. The fledgling Nazi Party, in this 'original' timeline, simply faded out after the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch. Many in the modern aristocracy, corporate dynasties, and others feel they have lost out because of the social transformations enabled by decades of peace and co-operation. This group come up with a plan to build a functional \\"time machine\\" and change history for their benefit. Their scheme is to go back as far as they can (roughly a century, to the very early 1920s) and mentor the fledgling Nazi Party. They regard the Nazis as the perfect tool for destroying the Soviet Union and establishing an elitist tyranny with which they can live the lives of luxury and entitlement they believe have been stolen from them. This 'Uptime' initiative sends 21st century advisors, armament, and nuclear weapons to support Adolf Hitler. The Hitler that they seek to advise soon develops other plans. Learning about the original history from his time traveling advisors, Hitler uses these lessons to ensure that Western Europe falls swiftly, followed by dropping a few of the Uptime nuclear weapons to wipe out the Soviet Union. He then destroys his end of the \\"time conduit\\" and declares independence from his former sponsors. By the 1970s, Nazi Germany and the Empire of Japan have conquered everything other than North America, Australasia, and parts of South America. Africa has suffered an enormous genocide every bit as complete as the one inflicted upon the Jews, and the Axis powers stand poised in 1975 to start a final war that the United States is bound to lose, given the military power of Nazi Germany. An organization in this altered 1975 discovers the secret behind the Nazi successes of the previous decades. The group decides that it will build its own time machine to go back and stop the present nightmare of Nazi world domination. This 1975 time machine is not as advanced or powerful as the original 2020s machine, so they can only open a gate to 1939. The plan is to establish a military alliance between the 1975 America of President John F. Kennedy and the 1939 America of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The team starts noticing that events they had no hand in are different (such as the Joe Louis versus John Henry fight and the death of Pope Pius XI) and with Einstein's help realize that all possible outcomes already exist and all time travel does is take you to one of these other branches. Realizing why things have gone wrong, it is up to the 1975 Uptime agents, cut off in 1939, to keep the western Allies, including the United Kingdom and the United States in the fight, while working to close off Hitler's gateway to the alternate 2020s before he gets his atomic bomb and missile advantage. In the end, they succeed, and this second \\"alternate timeline\\" they create turns out to be our own world. They also realize that the United States of their own time knew they couldn't really change their present and was in reality planning to escape to the reality they would create just as the people backing Hitler had planned to do. To prevent their United States or Nazi Germany from invading our world they have the gate destroyed. Historical figures in the book include Isaac Asimov, Wilhelm Canaris, Winston Churchill, Duff Cooper, Anthony Eden, Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, Reinhard Heydrich, Adolf Hitler, Heinrich Himmler, John F. Kennedy, Frederick Lindemann, George Pegram, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Leo Szilard, and Edward Teller.

Zellweger‚Äôs lifetime achievements and academic contributions to education continue to be significant. He received his Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology at Temple University in 1966. His doctoral dissertation focused on early visual stimulation experience and its later effects on discrimination learning. Zellweger is probably best known for his creation of a simpler and more mentally intuitive system of logic notation called the Logic Alphabet.X-stem Logic Alphabet The Logic Alphabet, also known as the X-stem Logic Alphabet (XLA), is a notation system that contains a unique and visually iconographic approach to learning and performing logic operations. Patents have been issued on its design in the United States, Canada and Japan. ==Background== Zellweger's X-stem Logic Alphabet (XLA) shape value notation for the 16 binary logical connectives. The count of the iconographic letter shapes, 8 odd-stem (‚Äì 4 ‚Äì 4 ‚Äì) and 8 even-stem (1 ‚Äì 6 ‚Äì 1), corresponds to the fifth row of Pascal's Triangle (1 4 6 4 1).

(Click Image to Enlarge) Zellweger‚Äôs background is a combination of formal education and extensive research in the fields of Psychology, Pedagogy, Semiotics and Logic. In 1949, Zellweger attended a summer seminar at the Institute of General Semantics with Alfred Korzybski. In 1949‚Äì52, still in the era of Robert M. Hutchins and the Great Books Program, he earned his undergraduate degree at the University of Chicago. In 1975‚Äì76, he spent a year at the Biological Computer Laboratory, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, under the direction of Heinz von Foerster. In 1982, while on sabbatical leave at the Peirce Edition Project, in Indianapolis (IUPUI), he examined and carefully reordered a 900 page section of manuscripts written by Charles Sanders Peirce entitled ‚ÄúThe Simplest Mathematics‚Äù (1902). In 1989, he served the Peirce Edition Project again when he added to the proper sequencing of specific sections of Peirce‚Äôs extensive manuscripts. These multidisciplinary experiences contributed to the development, over a forty year period, of his X-stem Logic Alphabet. Zellweger has been a respected academic speaker and author, especially in the fields of Semiotics and Education.Zellweger's evolution of a logic truth table into a four quadrant truth matrix. (Click Image to Enlarge) ==Publications== Geometric structures and symmetry relations revealed by XLA in one to four spatial dimensions. (Click Image to Enlarge) Zellweger‚Äôs publications, as well as his unpublished materials, are extensive.Publications list A general principle expressed throughout his writings is the need for conscious and deliberate efforts that focus on the sign design and sign engineering of any and all kinds of notation (e.g. natural language and its specialized systems of logical, mathematical, chemical and musical notation). Moreover, his publications primarily center on the formal language of logic and improving the structure of its symbols. Specifically, he focuses on the deliberate engineering of a constructed language for logic called the X-stem Logic Alphabet (XLA). He emphasizes, with the mounting global prevalence of computers or ‚Äúlogic machines‚Äù, the importance of adopting a higher standard for the way we write and communicate logic. He brings to light the importance of a carefully constructed user-friendly notation that would allow students, at earlier stages of cognitive development, to learn and incorporate the fundamental skills of logic. He further highlights the importance of purposely designing our symbols of notation to be as cognitively ergonomic as possible, while simultaneously possessing multiple layers of rich content. The fundamental and applied principles of semiotic engineering are exemplified throughout his publications. ==Contribution== Zellweger‚Äôs contribution to the field of logic is best demonstrated through his development of the X-stem Logic Alphabet (XLA). The XLA notation is a highly advanced extension of both Charles Sanders Peirce‚Äôs box-X notation (1902) and Warren Sturgis McCulloch‚Äôs dot-X notation (1942). It could be said that XLA (1961‚Äì62) is the evolutionary product of the comprehensive work of Peirce, McCulloch, and Zellweger, or PMZ as an acronym. The standard notation used today (dot Logical conjunction, vee Logical disjunction, horseshoe Material conditional representing and, or, if) is a lingering, overly abstract, unsystematically selected set of symbols that was primarily developed and used by Peano, Whitehead, and Russell, or by common acronym PWR. This already exposes the primary weakness. Dot, vee, horseshoe do not carry any information that identifies, specifies, and encodes the truth tables they represent, namely, TFFF, TTTF, and TFTT. In marked contrast, XLA is an intentionally engineered set of sixteen iconographic letter shape symbols specifically designed to improve the efficiency of learning and performing logical operations. Serving as a system of highly abbreviated mini truth tables, Zellweger‚Äôs claim is that XLA is not only much easier to learn. It is also much easier to use. In fact, when ten-base numerals are used without the abacus and when XLA is used without written laid out rows and columns of truth tables, ordinary operations in both notations are easier to perform during the act of computational writing. It can be said that the current PWR symbols are to logic what Roman Numerals are to arithmetic. Roman Numerals (I, II, III) were cumbersome to use and only maintained a dominant role in arithmetic until 1202, when Leonardo Fibonacci in his work Liber Abaci, demonstrated that calculations with Hindu-Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3) were far more efficient. The lack of mental and written efficiency in the use of traditional PWR symbols may be because they are not icons. Therefore, these extremely abstract symbols cannot in writing visually depict the truth tables themselves, the simple geometric forms, the notational symmetry relations, and the isomorphic sets of interrelations inherent in logic. Conversely, the XLA symbols are iconographic and they possess a shape value. This enables complex logical operations to be performed through easy flips and rotations of the letter shape symbols themselves. By design, the letter shape of each X-stem Logic Alphabet symbol visually embodies and displays its individual underlying logic truth table. In other words, after the simple and exact truth table code in the deep structure of XLA has been learned, operations performed on the letter shape symbols are equivalent to logical operations acting on highly abbreviated sets of mini truth tables. Consequently, those using XLA never have the need to interrupt their calculations to check rows and columns of laid out truth tables. This basic and central advantage of XLA over PWR is often not fully recognized, even by practiced logicians. Nonetheless, systems of notation evolve and improve over time (e.g. Roman Numerals to the Decimal System and Imperial Units to the Metric System). In brief, XLA is described in two steps: (1) give the 16 binary connectives the right geometry, the right shape value anatomy; and (2) add the transformational physiology, namely, apply the algebra of simple symmetry groups to the 16 iconic letter shape symbols. Change comes with a whisper. This whisper presents a triple isomorphism. The mental operations are the same as the symmetry operations are the same as the logical operations. Said the other way around, the logical operations are the same as the symmetry operations are the same as the mental operations. Said again in a different order, the logical operations are the same as the mental operations are the same as the symmetry operations. Here we have a prime example of cognitive ergonomics at its best. The single act of performing any one automatically performs the other two. Whether or not the (PMZ) (XLA) system, or something similar to it, replaces the traditional PWR symbols remains to be seen. Nonetheless, for researchers and semioticians, Zellweger's contributions to logic notation will most likely play a valuable role in future developments. ==Teaching== Zellweger‚Äôs teaching system, for logic, integrates the developmental and interactive approaches of Fr√∂bel, Montessori, and Piaget. This is accomplished through the use of educational tools and models that predominantly focus on visual and kinesthetic learning modalities. At every level in the educational ladder, students of Zellweger‚Äôs system learn in a natural and intuitive way through the use of sensory-motor exercises and a variety of interactive geometric models. (See video of Zellweger‚Äôs teaching models at the Museum of Jurassic Technology:) These models, at the most advanced level, become extremely complex and beautiful. Each X-stem Logic Alphabet symbol can be easily flipped or rotated, by eye-hand coordination, through a series of simple symmetry transformations. When a student can visually and manually observe the geometry and the network of symmetry relationships among all 16 binary connectives of two-valued logic, it then becomes far easier for them to perform what are normally considered to be highly abstract logical operations. Zellweger‚Äôs publications and models permit students to literally ‚Äúsee‚Äù, ‚Äútouch‚Äù, ‚Äúplay with‚Äù, ‚Äúwork with‚Äù, and ‚Äúthink about‚Äù the natural beauty of logic. His work is now on display at the Museum of Jurassic Technology, Culver City, California.

Writing in several languages (Romanian, Yiddish, French), he focused his studies on the Romanian Jewish community, while steadily publishing articles and brochures which confronted antisemitism. The brother of literary historian Moses Schwarzfeld, Elias was the uncle of poet-philosopher Benjamin Fondane. Harassed and expelled by Romanian authorities, Schwarzfeld settled in France and became a French citizen. While pursuing his literary and scientific activities, he also worked as an assistant to Maurice de Hirsch, managing his various philanthropic projects and, after 1891, the Jewish Colonization Association. ==Biography== ===Romanian career=== Born in Ia≈üi, Elias Schwarzfeld belonged to a family of intellectual prominence: his father B. Schwarzfeld was a poet Z. Ornea, \\"Iudaismul √Æn eseistica lui Fundoianu\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 48/1999 and owner of a large book collection.Paul Daniel, \\"Destinul unui poet\\", in B. Fundoianu, Poezii, Editura Minerva, Bucharest, 1978, p.597. The future writer, who was two years older than Moses, also had a sister, Adela Schwarzfeld-Wechsler (1859 ‚Äì 1953), mother of Benjamin Fondane. Elias received his early education in the city's public schools, and while still a student, between 1871 and 1873, contributed to the Ia≈üi papers Curierul de Ia≈üi and Noul Curier Rom√¢n.Isidore Singer, \\"Schwarzfeld\\", Jewish Encyclopedia entry Like his two siblings, Elias was raised within an intellectual environment shaped by Junimea literary society, his family being acquainted with several of Junimeas leading members. In 1872, Schwarzfeld participated in setting up Vocea AparƒÉtorului (\\"The Defender's Voice\\"), a review started on behalf of the Jews. In May 1874, he founded in Ia≈üi Revista IsraeliticƒÉ (\\"The Israelites' Review\\"), in which he published his first Jewish novel, Darascha. From 1874 to 1876, Elias Schwarzfeld studied medicine at the University of Bucharest, abandoning it later to take up the study of law. In 1881, he became a Doctor of Law, the title being awarded to him by the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles in Belgium. Between 1877 and 1878, Schwarzfeld edited the Yiddish daily J√ºdischer Telegraf; after this had ceased publication, he edited the Yiddish biweekly Ha-Yoetz. During this period, Schwarzfeld became interested in advancing the cause of the non-emancipated Jewish community in the Kingdom of Romania: in 1878 he published his first pamphlet, Chestia ≈ücoalelor israelite ≈üi a progresului israelit √Æn Rom√¢nia (\\"The Issue of Israelite Schools and the Israelite Progress in Romania\\"), occasioned by a circular which the Alliance Isra√©lite Universelle had issued calling for information regarding the state of education among the Romanian Jews. In 1881, on settling in Bucharest, he took charge of the paper Fraternitatea (\\"Brotherhood\\"). He was at this time one of the principal collaborators on Anuarul pentru Israeli≈£i (\\"Yearbook for Israelites\\"), founded by his brother Moses in 1877. Presided upon by scholar Moses Gaster, the Anuarul pentru Israeli≈£i staff, Elias included, promoted a moderate assimilationist agenda (Haskalah).MƒÉriuca Stanciu, \\"A Promoter of the Haskala in Romania‚ÄìMoses Gaster\\" , in the University of Bucharest's Studia Hebraica I , 2003 It was in this journal that he published, from 1884 to 1898, his numerous studies on the history of the Jews in Romania. In 1883, he published another novel, Rabinul fƒÉcƒÉtor de minuni, conte populaire (\\"The Miraculous Rabbi, a Folk Tale\\"). Involved with the B'nai B'rith, an international service club for the Jewish communities, he was vice-president of the Fraternitatea lodge, and later as secretary-general of the supreme council of the Jewish lodges of Romania. In 1885 he published, in behalf of coreligionists in the small towns and villages, two pamphlets discussing cases of antisemitic persecution and Jewish reactions: Radu Porumbaru ≈üi isprƒÉvile lui la Fabrica de H√¢rtie din BacƒÉu (\\"Radu Porumbaru and His Doings at the BacƒÉu Paper Mill\\"), AdevƒÉrul asupra revoltei de la Brusturoasa (\\"The Truth on the Revolt in Brusturoasa\\"). ===Expulsion and move to France=== Schwarzfeld's activities having rendered him objectionable to the National Liberal government of Ion BrƒÉtianu, he was expelled October 17, 1885, only forty-eight hours being given to him to arrange his personal affairs. Driven out of Romania at roughly the same time as Gaster, who had also spoken out against official antisemitism, he consequently moved to France, settling in Paris. In 1886, he was appointed by Baron Maurice de Hirsch secretary of his private bureau of charity. When Hirsch founded the Jewish Colonization Association (1891), Schwarzfeld became its secretary-general; up to the death of Clara Baroness Hirsch he acted as her secretary in the distribution of her charities. Eventually, Schwarzfeld was naturalized a French citizen. From Paris, Schwarzfeld continued his literary activity in behalf of his Romanian coreligionists, and he was co-editor of Egalitatea (\\"Equality\\"), the Bucharest-based Jewish periodical founded in Bucharest by his brother. He had an international career as an essayist and historian: in 1901, the American Jewish Year Book published his The Jews of Rumania from the Earliest Time to the Present Day and The Situation of the Jews in Rumania Since the Berlin Treaty (1878); an essay on The Jews of Moldavia at the Beginning of the Eighteenth Century appeared in The Jewish Quarterly Review, vol. xvi., and another entitled Deux episodes de l'histoire des juifs roumains in the Revue des √âtudes Juives, vol. xiii. His Les juifs en Roumaine depuis le Trait√© de Berlin (\\"The Jews of Romania since the Berlin Treaty\\") appeared under the pseudonym Edmond Sincerus (London, 1901). Elias Schwarzfeld also completed work on several new novels: in 1890, Bercu Batlen; in 1895, G√¢ngavul (\\"The Stammerer\\"), Be≈£ivul (\\"The Drunkard\\"), Prigonit de soartƒÉ (\\"Persecuted by Fate\\"); in 1896, O fatƒÉ bƒÉtr√¢nƒÉ (\\"An Old Maid\\"), Unchiul Berisch (\\"Uncle Berisch\\"), Un vagabond (\\"A Vagabond\\"), Schimschele Ghibor, Judecata poporanƒÉ (\\"The People's Judgment\\"); in 1897, Polcovniceasa (\\"The Polkovnik's Wife\\"). Most of these novels have been translated into the Hebrew language and published by M. Braunstein-Mebaschan. Schwarzfeld also translated into Romanian several novels by, among others, S√°muel Kohn, Leopold Kompert, Marcus Lehman, Ludwig Philippson, Leopold von Sacher-Masoch. In addition, he published Romanian versions of Isidore Loeb's article Juifs (\\"Jews\\"), Ars√®ne Darmesteter's pamphlet on the Talmud, and the two lectures by Ernest Renan on Judaism. Elias Schwarzfeld's death was marked with an obituary piece in the Jewish magazine M√¢ntuirea, which was incidentally Benjamin Fondane's earliest contribution to this periodical. Fondane praised his uncle as \\"the only historian of the Romanian Jews\\", a \\"living archive\\", and the wager of a \\"holy battle\\" for the defense of Jewish rights. Schwarzfeld's contribution also earned posthumous praise in later decades. Writing in 1999, literary historian Z. Ornea described his predecessor's contribution to the field of Jewish Romanian history as \\"remarkable\\". In 2002, Editura Hasefer republished some of Schwarzfeld's scholarly contributions in an anthology edited by historian Lya Benjamin: Evreii √Æn texte istoriografice. It notably includes his posthumously published reply to Romanian ethnic nationalist historian Nicolae Iorga's Istoria evreilor √Æn ≈£ƒÉrile noastre (\\"The History of the Jews in Our Countries\\", 1913). \\"Evreii √Æn texte istoriografice.

He was an attorney for the Soo Line before joining the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad in 1954 and later from 1957 to 1966, served as President. In 1966, he became president of the Burlington Railroad. He later returned to the Milwaukee Road, where he was chairman from 1970 until shortly after it went bankrupt in December 1977. == Early life and education == Born in St. Paul, Minnesota, Quinn earned an undergraduate degree from the University of St. Thomas in 1933 and then earned a law degree from the University of Minnesota Law School in 1935. == Career == After law school, Quinn worked in private law practice in Minnesota and as an assistant U.S. attorney. He then took a job with the Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railroad as an in-house attorney. During World War II, Quinn was posted to work for the Federal Bureau of Investigation as a counterespionage agent. After the war, he returned to the Soo Line. In 1954 the Milwaukee Road recruited Quinn to join the railroad as a general solicitor. By 1958 he had risen up to become the railroad's president. Quinn left the Milwaukee Road in 1966 to become president of the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy. He returned to the Milwaukee Road in 1970 as chairman, shortly after the CB&Q; merged with several related lines. Quinn was the last leader of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad and was involved in its notorious scheme of de-electrification in 1972, right before the 1973 oil crisis. This and the general collapse of the road in the 1960s led to the final bankruptcy of the famous Milwaukee Road. Quinn retired in 1978. He died in Glenview, Illinois at the age of 104. ==References== *Milwaukee Road in the 70's: What really happened? from Trainweb *Presidential Turntable (Time Magazine article from Oct. 21, 1966 *Biography of William John Quinn Category:1911 births Category:2015 deaths Category:American centenarians Category:American people in rail transportation Category:American railroad executives Category:University of Minnesota alumni Category:University of Minnesota Law School alumni Category:Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad Category:Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad people Category:20th-century American businesspeople ","title":"William John Quinn"},{"id":"11644470","text":"Microinsurance is the protection of low-income people (those living on between approximately $1 and $4 per day( below $4)) against specific perils in exchange for regular premium payment proportionate to the likelihood and cost of the risks involved. This definition is exactly the same as one might use for regular insurance except for the clearly prescribed target market: low- income people. The target population typically consists of persons ignored by mainstream commercial and social insurance schemes, as well as persons who have not previously had access to appropriate insurance products. The institutions or set of institutions implementing microinsurance are commonly referred to as a microinsurance scheme. == Definitions of microinsurance == #Microinsurance is insurance with low premiums and low caps / coverage. In this definition, \\"micro\\" refers to the small financial transaction that each insurance policy generates. \\"General micro insurance product means health insurance contract, any contract covering the belongings, such as, hut, livestock or tools or instruments or any personal accident contract, either on individual or group basis, as per terms stated in Schedule-I appended to these regulations\\"; and \\"life microinsurance product\\" means any term insurance contract with or without return of premium, any endowment insurance contract or health insurance contract, with or without an accident benefit rider, either on individual or group basis, as per terms stated in Schedule-II appended to these regulations as those within defined (low) minimum and maximum caps. The Indian Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDAI) characterizes microinsurance by the product features. This is further complemented by their definition for microinsurance agents, those appointed by and acting for an insurer, for distribution of microinsurance products (and only those products). #Microinsurance is a financial arrangement to protect low-income people against specific perils in exchange for regular premium payments proportionate to the likelihood and cost of the risk involved. The author of this definition adds that micro-insurance does not refer to: (i) the size of the risk-carrier (some are small and even informal, others very large companies); (ii) the scope of the risk (the risks themselves are by no means \\"micro\\" to the households that experience them); (iii) the delivery channel: it can be delivered through a variety of different channels, including small community-based schemes, credit unions or other types of microfinance institutions, but also by enormous multinational insurance companies, etc. #Microinsurance is synonymous to community-based financing arrangements, including community health funds, mutual health organizations, rural health insurance, revolving drugs funds, and community involvement in user-fee management. Most community financing schemes have evolved in the context of severe economic constraints, political instability, and lack of good governance. The common feature within all, is the active involvement of the community in revenue collection, pooling, resource allocation and, frequently, service provision. #Microinsurance is the use of insurance as an economic instrument at the \\"micro\\" (i.e. smaller than national) level of society. This definition integrates the above approaches into one comprehensive conceptual framework. It was first published in 1999, pre-dating the other three approaches, and has been noted to be the first recorded use of the term \\"microinsurance\\". Under this definition, decisions in microinsurance are made within each unit, (rather than far away, at the level of governments, companies, NGOs that offer support in operations, etc.). Insurance functions on the concept of risk pooling, and likewise, regardless of its small unit size and its activities at the level of single communities, so does microinsurance. Microinsurance links multiple small units into larger structures, creating networks that enhance both insurance functions (through broader risk pools) and support structures for improved governance (i.e. training, data banks, research facilities, access to reinsurance etc.). This mechanism is conceived as an autonomous enterprise, independent of permanent external financial lifelines, and its main objective is to pool both risks and resources of whole groups for the purpose of providing financial protection to all members against the financial consequences of mutually determined risks. The last definition therefore, includes the critical features of the previous three: # transactions are low-cost (and reflect members‚Äô willingness to pay); # clients are essentially low-net-worth (but not necessarily uniformly poor); # the essential role of the network of microinsurance units is to enhance risk management of the members of the entire pool of microinsurance units over and above what each can do when operating as a stand-alone entity. == Microinsurance products == Microinsurance, like regular insurance, may be offered for a wide variety of risks. These include both health risks (illness, injury, or death) and property risks (damage or loss). A wide variety of microinsurance products exist to address these risks, including crop insurance and livestock/cattle insurance, which are increasingly sold as index-based insurance, theft or fire insurance, health insurance, term life insurance, death insurance, disability insurance, and insurance for natural disasters. Microinsurance has made a significant difference in countries like Mali, as Maxime Prud'Homme and Bakary Traor√© describe in Innovations in Sikasso. Still, many countries face continuing challenges. Specifically in Bangladesh, micro health insurance schemes are having trouble with financial and institutional sustainability, Syed Abdul Hamid and Jinnat Ara describe, but things are improving. Progress in Bangladesh == Microinsurance delivery models == One of the greatest challenge for microinsurance is the actual delivery to clients. Methods and models for doing so vary depending on the organization, institution, and provider involved. As Dubby Mahalanobis states, one must be thorough and careful when making policies, otherwise microinsurance could do more harm than good. Tricky challenges In general, there are four main methods for offering microinsurance the partner-agent model, the provider-driven model, the full-service model, and the community-based model. Each of these models has their own advantages and disadvantages. *Partner agent model: A partnership is formed between the micro insurance(partner as MFI) scheme and an agent (insurance companies), and in some cases a third-party healthcare provider. The microinsurance scheme is responsible for the delivery and marketing of products to the clients, while the agent retains all responsibility for design and development. In this model, microinsurance schemes benefit from limited risk, but are also disadvantaged in their limited control. Micro Insurance Centre is an example of an organization using this model. *Full service model: The microinsurance scheme is in charge of everything; both the design and delivery of products to the clients, working with external healthcare providers to provide the services. This model has the advantage of offering microinsurance schemes full control, yet the disadvantage of higher risks. *Provider-driven model: The healthcare provider is the microinsurance scheme, and similar to the full-service model, is responsible for all operations, delivery, design, and service. There is an advantage once more in the amount of control retained, yet disadvantage in the limitations on products and services. *Community-based/mutual model: The policyholders or clients are in charge, managing and owning the operations, and working with external healthcare providers to offer services. This model is advantageous for its ability to design and market products more easily and effectively, yet is disadvantaged by its small size and scope of operations. ==Microinsurance scheme== A microinsurance scheme is a scheme that uses, among others, an insurance mechanism whose beneficiaries are (at least in part) people excluded from formal social protection schemes, particularly, informal economy workers and their families. The scheme differs from others created to provide legal social protection to formal economy workers. Membership is not compulsory (but can be automatic), and members pay, at least in part, the necessary contributions in order to cover benefits. The expression \\"microinsurance scheme\\" designates either the institution that provides insurance (e.g., a health mutual benefit association) or the set of institutions (in the case of linkages) that provide insurance or the insurance service itself provided by an institution that also handles other activities (e.g., a micro-finance institution). The use of the mechanism of insurance implies: * Prepayment and resource-pooling: the regular prepayment of contributions (before the insured risks occur) that are pooled together. * Risk-sharing: the pooled contributions are used to pay a financial compensation to those who are affected by predetermined risks, and those who are not exposed to these risks do not get their contributions back. * Guarantee of coverage: a financial compensation for a number of risks, in line with a pre-defined benefits package. Microinsurance schemes may cover various risks (health, life, etc.); the most frequent microinsurance products are: * Life microinsurance (and retirement savings plans) * Health microinsurance (hospitalisation, primary health care, maternity, etc.) * Disability microinsurance * Property microinsurance ‚Äì assets, livestock, housing * Crop microinsurance Dirk Reinhard provides a good list summarising reading pertinent to microinsurance. Small means, massive impact == Microinsurance and development == Microinsurance is recognized as a useful tool in economic development. As many low-income people do not have access to adequate risk- management tools, they are vulnerable to fall back into poverty in times of hardship, for example when the breadwinner of the family dies, or when high hospital bills force families to take out loans with high interest rates. Furthermore, microinsurance makes it possible for people to take more risks. When farmers are insured against a bad harvest (resulting from drought), they are in a better position to grow crops which give high yields in good years, and bad yields in year of drought. Without the insurance, however, they will be inclined to do the opposite; since they have to safeguard a minimal level of income for themselves and their families, crops will be grown which are more drought resistant, but which have a much lower yield in good weather conditions. ==Notable companies== * Milvik * Stonestep * OKO ==See also== *Friendly society *Health economics *Insurance in India *Microfinance ==References== ==External links== * Category:Types of insurance Category:Poverty Category:Health economics ","title":"Microinsurance"},{"id":"11644477","text":"This is a list of Canadians who have raced in at least one NASCAR national series event. ==Active drivers== All statistics in this table are as of October 4, 2020. {| class=\\"wikitable sortable sortable\\" style=\\"font-size: 100%;\\" |- !

He joined the Luftwaffe in 1936 and served almost all of his career with Demonstration Wing 1 (Lehrgeschwader 1 (LG 1)). With his unit, he participated in the Invasion of Poland, the Norwegian Campaign, the Battles of the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Britain in 1939‚Äì40. For his contributions in these campaigns, Helbig received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross in late 1940. He was then transferred to the Mediterranean theater where he bombed Malta, the British Mediterranean Fleet and flew in support of the Afrika Korps. Helbig received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords in late 1942 for the support of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's 1942 summer offensive. He was then banned from further combat flying and was assigned to the staff of the General of Bombers, the senior officer responsible for the Luftwaffe's bomber force. In August 1943 the ban was revoked and Helbig was appointed commander of LG 1 which was then operating against the Allied forces in Italy. In June 1944, he and LG 1 were transferred to France after the Invasion of Normandy. In early 1945, LG 1 was transferred to the Eastern Front and Helbig was tasked to destroy the bridges over the Oder. He surrendered to the American forces at the end of the war in May. After the war, Helbig pursued a civilian career; he died in 1985. ==Early life== Joachim Helbig was born on 10 September 1915 in Dahlen, Saxony. He volunteered for military service on 1 April 1935 and initially served one year with an artillery regiment. In the fall of 1936, he transferred to the Luftwaffe and entered the Bomber Flying School in Lechfeld. After completing his training as an observer and aerial gunner on 20 April 1937, he was posted as an observer to the Bomber Wing (Kampfgeschwader (KG)) 152 in Schwerin.Berger 1999, p. 120.Schumann 2007, p. 80.Stockert 1996, p. 322.Taghon 2004a, pp. 22‚Äì23. ==World War II== ===Western Europe; Battle of Britain=== At the beginning of World War II in September 1939, Helbig held the rank of Second Lieutenant and was serving as an observer in a He 111 reconnaissance aircraft of Demonstration Wing 1 (Lehrgeschwader 1 (II./LG 1)) in 1938. He was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class following the campaign.Thomas 1997, p. 265. Helbig took part in the April 1940 invasion of Norway (Operation Weser√ºbung). As part of II. Gruppe, he flew missions in support of the German ground forces, particularly in the √Öndalsnes area. During one of these missions on 2 May, his unit sank the Norwegian hospital ship with heavy losses. Following their attack on Dronning Maud, the German aircraft then bombed the nearby village of Gratangen, destroying several houses and killing two civilians. Shortly afterwards, the unit returned to Germany.De Zeng, Stankey and Creek 2008, p. 359.Hafsten 1991, p. 43Shores et al. 1991, p. 304. During the Battle of France later that month, Helbig served as squadron commander of the Fourth Squadron of LG 1, flying both He 111 and Junkers Ju 88 bombers, a position he held until 5 November 1941. While attacking shipping during the Battle of Dunkirk on 1 June, Helbig's Ju 88 was intercepted by Supermarine Spitfires of No. 616 Squadron RAF. They damaged the aircraft, and lightly wounded Helbig, but he was able to return to base.Taghon 2004a, p. 95; Cornwell 2007, p. 410 For his actions, he was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class. Following the defeat of France, Helbig was promoted to captain (Hauptmann) in JulyStockert 1996, p. 323. and his unit remained in France to participate in the Battle of Britain. On 15 August 1940, Helbig and his squadron, consisting of seven Ju 88s, took off with the primary target of the British airfield at Worthy Down together with other German units. The Germans were intercepted by British fighters and the mission was very costly for 4. Staffel as over half the bombers were shot down by the British or were written off after landing. Helbig was forced to jettison his bombs before reaching the target and return to base, flying on a single engine with wounded crewmen aboard.Taghon 2004a, pp. 124‚Äì26. During the battle, Helbig reported that his badly damaged Ju 88 was intercepted by a Spitfire over the English Channel. The RAF pilot did not fire, but instead flew alongside the crippled bomber until the French coast was in sight, waved and flew away.Taghon 2004a, pp. 124‚Äì25 Historian Christer Bergstr√∂m has suggested that this might have been Pilot Officer Richard Hardy from No. 234 Squadron RAF.Bergstr√∂m 2015, p. 128. As the battle continued, LG 1 mostly switched to bombing cities at night. Helbig was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 24 November, after having flown 75 combat missions.Schumann, p. 81. ===North African and Mediterranean campaign=== alt=A twin engine propeller powered aircraft in flight and viewed from the right side. The aircraft bears multiple markings including a black and white cross on its side and swastika on the tail fin The Gruppe flew to Sicily in mid-January 1941 and attacked targets in Malta as well as British ships in the Mediterranean. On one of these missions they damaged the aircraft carrier on 16 January while she was docked for repairs in Grand Harbour, Malta. The unit was transferred to Bulgaria in early April in preparation for Operation Marita, the German invasions of Greece and Yugoslavia, where it participated in the bombing of Belgrade, Yugoslavia on 6 April. Shortly afterwards, it returned to Sicily and spent the rest of the campaign on anti-shipping missions near Southern Greece and Crete with occasional ground-attack missions. Two weeks later, on 21 April, II./LG 1 damaged the oil tanker south of CreteTaghon 2004a, p. 223. and unsuccessfully attacked a British convoy near Malta during Operation Tiger on 11 May.De Zeng, Stankey and Creek 2008, p. 361. The unit transferred to Athens on 16 May in preparation for the invasion of Crete (Operation Merkur) and continued its efforts to interdict shipping in Greek waters. It may have damaged the battleship on 27 May as the British were evacuating the island.Shores, Cull and Malizia 1987, p. 386. II./LG 1 remained in the Mediterranean for the rest of the year, attacking targets in Palestine, Egypt and Libya, including long-range missions mining the Suez Canal and various ports at night. Helbig became Gruppenkommandeur (group commander) of I./LG 1 on 5 November. The Gruppe briefly came under the command of Fliegerf√ºhrer Afrika on 21 November and assisted III./LG 1 in supporting German ground forces during the British Operation Crusader offensive for five days. He was slightly wounded during a Royal Air Force bombing raid on the airfield at Benina, Libya, on 29 November, as his unit was staging through en route back to Greece. Helbig commanded the unit on operations against the Sidi Barrani‚ÄìAlexandria rail line on 3 and 4 December. On 10 December the unit flew interdiction operations against the British Army south of Tobruk. Thereafter, the unit flew mine-laying operations off the Libyan coast.De Zeng, Stankey and Creek 2008, pp. 354‚Äì55, 361; Taghon, 2004a, p. 290; Weal 2009, p. 54. On 16 January 1942, Helbig became the 64th recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves after having completed 210 combat missions. While on patrol approximately south of Crete on 11 May, Ju 88s from I./LG 1 detected four British destroyers, , Kipling, Jackal and Lively. The first wave of 14 Ju 88s from I./LG 1 attacked the destroyers later that afternoon, sank Lively and crippled Jackal. A second wave failed to find the destroyers, but the third wave of seven Ju 88s, led by Helbig, attacked the destroyers with the setting sun behind them. Helbig's aircraft sank Kipling at while Jackal later had to be scuttled.De Zeng, Stankey and Creek 2008, pp. 355; Taghon 2004b, pp. 11‚Äì12. The attack was successful despite the presence of defending Bristol Beaufighters from No. 272 Squadron RAF.Goss 2007, p. 102. In June, British commandos attacked Helbig's unit at their base in Heraklion, Crete, and succeeded in blowing up seven Ju 88s.Hooton 1997, p. 212. On 28 September 1942 he was awarded the 20th Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords. ===Italian campaign and post-war life=== In January 1943, Helbig was transferred to the staff of the General der Kampfflieger (Commander of Bombers). In March 1943 he was appointed the General der Kampfflieger and was promote to Oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel) on 1 September.Schumann 2007, p. 88. After numerous difficulties and clashes with his superiors, including Field Marshal Albert Kesselring, he returned to LG 1 as its Geschwaderkommodore (wing commander) on 14 August.Taghon 2004b, p. 231. When his Geschwader was transferred to Italy to operate against the Allied beachheads at Anzio and Nettuno in Italy after the landings there (Operation Shingle) on 22 January 1944, Helbig was appointed as the commander of all bomber units in Italy. On the night of 23/24 January, his aircraft sank the destroyer HMS Janus with a torpedo and damaged severely Jervis with a Henschel Hs 293 glider bomb at the cost of 11 aircraft.Langtree 2002, p. 168; Taghon 2004b, pp. 286‚Äì88 The Corsica operation was a success and these long-range operations destroyed 23 aircraft and damaged 90.Hooton 1997, p. 240. In June 1944, LG 1 was ordered to transfer to Belgium for air defense during the Allied invasion of France.Br√ºtting 1974, p. 99. Helbig formed a combined ground support and reconnaissance battle group as part of the Luftwaffe's operations against the Allied bombing campaign on 10 September 1944. Visiting unit at the Vogelsang Airfield, he was severely wounded by strafing Allied aircraft. Due to his injuries Helbig had to surrender command of his unit.Taghon 2004b, p. 372. In the last weeks of the war in Europe, Helbig commanded a combat unit on the Eastern Front; he surrendered to the American forces on 8 May 1945.Berger 1999, p. 121. After the war he returned to civilian life, becoming the director of the Schultheiss brewery plant in Berlin.Bergstr√∂m 2015, p. 127. Helbing died in Malente on 5 October 1985 following a car accident on vacation in Spain. ==Awards== * Medaglia d'Argento al Valor Militare * Iron Cross (1939) 2nd class (16 September 1939) & 1st class (20 June 1940)MacLean 2007, p. 229. * Ehrenpokal der Luftwaffe (6 October 1940) * Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords ** Knight's Cross on 24 November 1940 as Hauptmann and Staffelkapit√§n of the 4.(K)/Lehrgeschwader 1Scherzer 2007, p. 378. ** 64th Oak Leaves on 16 January 1942 as Hauptmann and Gruppenkommandeur of the I.(K)/Lehrgeschwader 1 ** 20th Swords on 28 September 1942 as Hauptmann and Gruppenkommandeur of the I.(K)/Lehrgeschwader 1 ==Notes== ==Citations== ==Bibliography== * * Bergstr√∂m, Christer (2015).

The cook was forced to reveal that the unusual taste was due to his (the cook's) own blood, which had dropped into the dish when his hand was bleeding. The king deduced that the blood was the ingredient to make all his food delicious and commanded that all his food be cooked in human blood from then on. His taste for blood grew so intense that over time he grew fangs and began attacking his own people to feast on them.

On June 7, 2007, Presti was hired as the general manager of the Seattle SuperSonics, who later relocated and became the Oklahoma City Thunder.Sonic youth: Presti, 30, gets job as GM In the summer of 2010, the team extended his contract. Presti previously served in several progressively more significant positions for the San Antonio Spurs after beginning as an intern. He met their general manager R. C. Buford at a basketball camp in Aspen, Colorado. He is given much of the credit for encouraging the Spurs to draft point guard Tony Parker in 2001. In his first move as general manager of the SuperSonics, he traded multiple-time All-Star Ray Allen to the Boston Celtics, whom Allen helped win the NBA title in 2008, in a large trade that included the draft rights to Jeff Green. He shortly thereafter traded All-Star Rashard Lewis to the Orlando Magic for a second-round draft pick, generating a 9-million-dollar trade exception which Presti later used to land Kurt Thomas and two first-round draft picks from the Phoenix Suns.http://www.nba.com/suns/news/thomas_trade_070720.html To lead the team, he selected as head coach P. J. Carlesimo, whom he knew as an assistant coach at San Antonio. In Presti's first season in charge, the team was a franchise worst 20‚Äì62. Toward the end of that season, the league authorized a move and after a court battle and settlement, the team was allowed to move to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Subsequently, they were renamed the Thunder. During his second season, the Thunder began the season 1‚Äì12 and Presti fired Carlesimo, and hired assistant coach Scott Brooks as the interim coach. Under Brooks, the Thunder went 22‚Äì47. Presti acquired Thabo Sefolosha from the Chicago Bulls for a late first-round pick. Presti also initiated a trade for Tyson Chandler from the New Orleans Hornets for two backups (Chris Wilcox and Joe Smith), but the trade was later rescinded because Chandler failed his required physical. Coach Brooks was retained and in Presti's third season the plan began to provide much improved results. A strong defense arose with the help of Assistant Coach Ron Adams. Kevin Durant, whom Presti drafted in 2007, became the league's leading scorer and other higher draft picks obtained in the previous weak seasons and a few veterans successfully filled roles and improved the team's record to 50‚Äì32. The Thunder played the eventual champion Los Angeles Lakers in the first round, forcing them to six games before losing, 4‚Äì2. On October 28, 2012, after unsuccessfully negotiating a contract extension, Presti traded reigning Sixth Man of the Year James Harden, along with Center Cole Aldrich and forwards Daequan Cook and Lazar Hayward to the Houston Rockets for guards Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb, two first round picks and a second round pick. On July 4, 2016, Kevin Durant parted ways with Oklahoma City, tasking Presti with retaining Russell Westbrook or otherwise rebuilding the roster from scratch.https://www.sbnation.com/2016/7/5/12097050/kevin-durant-leaves- warriors-oklahoma-city-thunder-dynasty On August 4, 2016 Presti held a press conference at the Chesapeake Energy Arena to announce that Westbrook had extended his contract until July 2018.http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/17220556/russell-westbrook-signs- contract-extension-oklahoma-city-thunder Following a modest 2016-2017 season with Oklahoma City, Presti was the driving force behind two major acquisitions during the 2017 off season as Paul George and Carmelo Anthony would join the Thunder.https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/paul-george-on-thunder-trading-for- melo-this-feels-like-a-championship-team/ ==Personal life== After graduating from Concord-Carlisle High School, Presti attended Virginia Wesleyan College from 1995‚Äì97, where he played Division III basketball.

His father was Byron George Clark, an American businessman who worked for United Shoe Machinery (USM). In 1905 Clark was brought to England by his parents. Following his education at Felsted School, Clark joined the British Army and was wounded at Cambrai in 1917. Clark later joined the Royal Flying Corps and served in Egypt. In 1927 he became a British citizen. ==Career== Clark joined the Plessey company in 1921 when his father bought a share of the company. Plessey was a small engineering company based in Ilford, Essex. Throughout the 1920s and 30s, Clark along with the engineer William Oscar Heyne, built Plessey into a large engineering company. During World War II, Plessey made an outstanding contribution to the nation's war effort producing munitions, aircraft components and electronic equipment. Clark remained in charge of the company throughout these times. After the war Plessey continued to expand under the guidance of Clark, new products included industrial hydraulics, radar equipment, telecommunications equipment and semiconductors. In 1961 Plessey acquired the British Ericsson Telephones and AT&E; companies, to become Britain's largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer. Clark was awarded a knighthood in 1961.

It is situated in Sremska Mitrovica, Vojvodina province. ==History== ===Foundation and early history=== It was formed by the order of Habsburg emperor Franz Joseph between 1895 and 1899. From 1918 to 1941, it functioned under administration of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and after 1944 under administration of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. ===Yugoslav wars period=== During Yugoslav wars, some Croatian prisoners of war were kept in this prison. The main prison facility; the largest known in Serbia, was open from November 1991 to August 1992 and was a scene where many prisoners were tortured, abused and raped. At least 25 prisoners were killed in front of witnesses, but the actual number is believed to be much higher. International organizations collected detailed information from reports, inspections and survivors regarding Sremska Mitrovica prison.http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/comexpert/ANX/VIII-10.htm#III.C.3 One of the two facilities making up the prison is Sremska Mitrovica-\\"Fru≈°ka Gora\\", which was a secondary location where an unknown number of detainees were kept. Information on this facility is very scarce and most of the reports by international institutions focuses on the primary facility. The primary facility was the \\"Penal Correctional Facility\\" (\\"Kazneno Popravni Dom\\" - KPD for short) which was primarily a civilian rehabilitation center for civilians. The facility was located in the center of Sremska Mitrovica and was an old brick building surrounded by walls with barbed wire. The main building was two stories high and 60‚Äì70 meters long and 8 meters wide. The building was composed of multiple pavilions with rooms of varying sizes. Along with these rooms, there were also solitary confinement cells and segregation cells of unknown purpose. The basement of the building was used for torture of prisoners. During the 1991-1995 War in Croatia, the Croatian city of Vukovar was captured by JNA and Serb paramilitary forces on November 18 following a three-month siege. While Croats surrendered under the agreement that the civilians from Vukovar would be allowed to go free, the JNA did not honor this agreement, and held the remaining Croatian military personnel and captured civilians in custody. Among the civilians, a large number of medical personnel from Vukovar's main hospital were also arrested, which was where many of the survivors in Vukovar took refuge. Among the prisoners was Dr. Vesna Bosanac, chief of medical staff at Vukovar. The remaining prisoners were transported to Sremska Mitrovica (which is only 75 kilometers southeast of Vukovar) over the next few days, and the KPD (the prison) was now expanded for this purpose. This was the first of several large groups transferred to the prison. On the way to KPD, buses full of prisoners were often stopped, so that Serbian reservists guarding the prisoners could take some of them out and kill them. Later, other groups would be transferred to the KPD from other locations in Croatia and Serbia. Later, during December, civilians wounded in the Lovas minefield massacre were also brought to the KPD. As the War in Bosnia and Herzegovina erupted in 1992, Bosniak prisoners were also brought to the camp, but Croats remained a majority of war prisoners there (since Bosnian Serbs opened concentration camps in Bosnia and Herzegovina to hold Bosniaks there). The majority of the war prisoners were from Vukovar (army and police) and Muslim and Croatian POWs from Bosanski ≈†amac (BiH). Along with them, there was at least one American, Ruthenian, a Slovenian woman and several Albanians. Serbs from Vukovar, who refused to collaborate with Serb forces were also detained, along with one JNA soldier. Since the facility was a primarily civilian prison, the KPD was also populated by civilian criminals who were also encouraged by the guards to participate in the abuse. Some of them raped female prisoners. The number of non-Serb war prisoners at the facility is reported to be between 3,000 and 4,000 after the fall of Vukovar. More prisoners were transferred in and out of the facility to other locations (Stajiƒáevo, Ni≈°, etc.), and some were executed, making an exact figure unknown. Many prisoners were also released for prisoner exchanges. The Yugoslav Army (JNA) was in charge of the prison, although Serb paramilitary units (known as being particularly brutal) and local Serb civilians were also among the guards. Several survivors described the brutality they survived at the hands of the paramilitaries, assessing that if they were in charge, everyone would have been killed. The commander of the guards at the KPD was nicknamed KOS (acronym for Yugoslav counter intelligence agency) by the prisoners, while the guards referred to him by a code name. He has personally participated in the beating of prisoners. He is believed to be a JNA Captain. The guards were a wide collection of JNA reservists, military police, paramilitaries and local Serb civilians who sometimes came to the camp simply to abuse and beat up the prisoners. Five prison guards (aged 18‚Äì20) were JNA privates in KPD for military training. They regularly tortured the inmates and killed at least 18 prisoners. Four Serbs from Vukovar knew some of the prisoners and inflicted the worst beatings and torture and were brought into interrogations of the prisoners. Two of them were called executioners by the prisoners. In January or February 1992, some of the original guards were replaced by 18- to 20-year-olds who increased the frequency and severity of the beatings. The guards were again replaced in March, following Red Cross requests, and food was improved. Following reports on the prison, International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) first visited the detention facility on December 2, 1991. ICRC registered the detainees it could (many were hidden away) and monitored their treatment. The prison guard went to some trouble to cover up the abuse. For the first two months, the Red Cross was not allowed access. Once they were allowed, they were banned from certain areas where heavily abused prisoners were moved. The ICRC sent inspectors there every month, which improved the conditions for a short time. Prisoners who complained to the ICRC over their treatment were later beaten severely. Most women were released following news of ICRC inspection. Upon arrival, the prisoners were forced to undress and strip-searched. All their belongings were confiscated, and anything valuable was never returned. The prisoners were put in rooms with wooden floors and no beds. Nearly 100 prisoners were situated in rooms between 50 and 92 square meters, which forced some prisoners to stand so that others could sleep. In such conditions, no one was able lie down on their backs. Wounded and sick were held among the general population and were denied medical treatment unless absolutely necessary. Since a number of hospital staff was also held, they tended to the wounded prisoners, but were denied medication and equipment. Many wounded died because of this treatment. Cold water was available, but the detainees had no soap, towels, toilet paper or detergent. Some of these were later provided, but were always scarce. Consequently, hygiene was non-existent. For months, the prisoners weren't able to shave or wash and became infested with lice, upon which they were sprayed with insecticide by the guards. The prisoners were given soap and toilet paper only when the Commission came to inspect the camp - but these were taken away the moment the inspection ended. After two and a half months, the prisoners were finally allowed to bathe due to ICRC pressure, which occurred only during inspections. During the night, a strong light was constantly on, preventing prisoners from sleeping easily. The prisoners were fed food they described as \\"terrible\\" and \\"horrible\\" and the portions were inadequate. Most prisoners lost weight, some up to 30 kg. Some were not fed at all for the first two days after their surrender. Prisoners were sometimes forced to eat unplucked chicken and never received any fruit or vegetables. Of the three daily meals, only one was hot. According to one prisoner, the guards always fed the prisoners one slice of bread short in order to cause friction among the inmates. For a full month and a half, the prisoners were not taken out into the fresh air. After that, they were forced to work in the fields, clean sewers and do other hard labor until exhaustion. Immediately upon arrival to the prison, male prisoners would be offloaded and \\"run a gauntlet\\" - i.e. run into the prison along a line of guards beating them with clubs, truncheons, axe handles, black jacks or simply hands and legs. At least 84 women were held after the fall of Vukovar and more were transferred there later. Most of them were separated, transferred to other locations and eventually released. Prisoners were beaten severely on a regular basis. Several were beaten so powerfully that they suffered from permanent body harm. Some were beaten until they passed out from the pain. A common practice was beating prisoners on the soles of their feet. The prisoners were ordered to stand with bowed heads and hands behind their backs whenever guards entered the room. They were forced to stand or sit like this for hours at a time. Guards would sometimes pick a prisoner for \\"not lowering his head low enough\\" for beating. Sometimes the guards would line up the detainees against a wall and beat every second or third in the line. Prisoners were beaten more severely each time Croatia had an important success (such as international recognition or successful military action). A group of 180 Croatian soldiers from Vukovar was isolated in pavilion three and was treated worse than other prisoners. They were beaten with iron rods on their feet and in the groin and kidney areas. Along with torture, the detainees were abused verbally and psychologically - a regular practice were mock executions: leading a prisoner to be \\"shot\\" by a firing squad and then returning him to the prison. Some prisoners were held in solitary confinement cells for two to five days where they were physically abused and forced to listen to Chetnik songs for days on end. While the beatings of those in confinement could not be seen by other prisoners, they were heard and the victims had to be dragged out, as some could not even walk for seven to ten days after solitary confinement. One prisoner was held for four months in solitary confinement. JNA officers, along with various soldiers, held interrogation sessions with the prisoners, which continued constantly. Many prisoners were beaten to extract confessions to false admittance of their \\"crimes\\". The brutality towards the prisoners was selective: some were not harmed, while others were beaten indiscriminately. Some prisoners were given statements to read aloud for cameras. These films were later shown on Serbian television. Many were charged with crimes and sent to Belgrade for trial. They would be charged with armed insurrection or genocide based on statements extracted from the prisoners during beatings. Sometimes, the guards would hold a mock trial and beat the accused. One such was found dead the morning after the \\"trial\\". An unknown number of prisoners were beaten to death. According to one survivor, two prisoners in the same room died due to beatings and were left to lie there for 20 hours with the other prisoners. Other prisoners also speak of prisoners being beaten or tortured to death. According to the U.S. Department of State's declassified materials,U.S. Department of State, Declassified Materials, 1992, IHRLI Doc. No. 56582 - 56583 at least 18 prisoners were tortured to death. Another survivor claims that people were killed, but not in front of witnesses, while at least two others said they witnessed at least two deaths. Some prisoners were transferred to solitary confinement cells and never returned. Throughout 1992, prisoners were regularly exchanged. On August 7, 1992, an agreement was reached between Yugoslav Prime Minister Milan Paniƒá and Croatian Prime Minister Franjo Greguriƒá in Budapest for a mass exchange of prisoners. About 500 prisoners from the KPD were to be exchanged at Nemetin, near Osijek. During the ride towards their destination, many were mistreated. On August 14, approximately 1500 prisoners from both sides were exchanged. The prison reportedly did no longer kept war prisoners after August 13. Some of the inmates survived for nine months in the prison.

Enlisting in the Luftwaffe in 1937, prior to World War II, Clade served throughout the war as a fighter pilot in the Western and African fronts. Clade is credited with either 26 or 27 aircraft kills, and was shot down himself six times. He commanded the flight that shot down the transport of British Lieutenant General William Gott, the newly appointed Commander of the British 8th Army. ==Early life== Clade was born in Hambach, now part of Neustadt an der Weinstra√üe in Rheinland-Pfalz. After completing his schooling, he originally trained to become a merchant. However, he became interested in aviation in 1934, and became a glider pilot, participating in the German national civilian aviator's competition. ==Military career== Joining the Luftwaffe in April 1937, Clade was initially certified to fly the Junkers Ju 52. However, he quickly moved to become a fighter pilot. ==World War II== Clade served with 1./JG 1, flying the Messerschmitt Bf 109. He scored his first kill on 11 May 1940 near Maastricht, Netherlands against a Belgian Air Force Gloster Gladiator biplane of 1/I/2.The Silent Attack: The Taking of the Bridges at Veldwezelt, Vroenhoven and Hanne 1940, By Oscar Gonzalez, Thomas Steinke, Ian Tannahill, page 288 On the evening of the same day, he claimed a French LeO 451 twin-engine bomber of GB I/12 or GB II/12, also in the Maastricht area. Victories over an RAF Spitfire and Morane MS.406 followed in May and June 1940. Encountering Supermarine Spitfires for the first time over Dunkirk, Clade was impressed saying that the British fighters were almost the Germans' equals. During the Battle of Britain, Clade flew approximately 80 combat missions over Britain.Alarmstart: The German Fighter Pilot's Experience in the Second World War, Patrick G. Eriksson In March 1941, Clade was made an instructor attached to Jagdgeschwader 27 into which 1./JG 1 had been merged, and stayed with this fighter unit for essentially all his remaining wartime career. By now an oberfeldwebel, Clade was assigned to the Mediterranean theatre with 5./JG 27, operating from bases in North Africa alongside legendary \\"Star of Africa\\" Hans-Joachim Marseille.The Star of Africa: The Story of Hans Marseille, the Rogue Luftwaffe Ace Who Dominated the WWII Skies, Colin D.

Airborne over the desert south of Alexandria in Egypt, he chanced upon a Bristol Bombay transport of No. 216 Squadron RAF, flown by 19-year-old Sergeant Pilot H.E. 'Jimmy' James, who was flying Lieutenant General William Gott, the newly appointed Commander of the British 8th Army, to a staff meeting in Cairo. The plane was also carrying a number of wounded British soldiers.

Ella Shields (September 27, 1879 - August 5, 1952)Ella Shields biography at BFI accessed 20 Jun 2007 was a music hall singer and male-impersonator. Her famous signature song, \\"Burlington Bertie from Bow\\", a parody of Vesta Tilley's Burlington Bertie, written by her manager and first husband, William Hargreaves, was an immediate hit.Pegler, Martin, Soldiers' Songs and Slang of the Great War Osprey Publishing, 2014, , page 256. Though American-born, Shields achieved her greatest success in England. ==Biography== Ella Shields was born in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1879.The Times(London, England), 6 August 1952, p. 6 Obituary: Miss Ella Shields. Her true surname appears to have been BuscherAccording to an obituary her father was Edward T. Buscher: The Times, 6 August 1952, p.6 (sometimes spelled Busher). She was educated at South Bend, Indiana. It is not certain when she adopted the stage name Shields. \\"Ella\\" might also have been a stage name. She began her career in 1898The Times(London, England), 6 August 1952, p. 6 Obituary: Miss Ella Shields. First stage appearance at Altoona, Pennsylvania. doing a vaudeville song-and-dance act with her sisters. In 1904The Times(London, England), 6 August 1952, p. 6 Obituary: Miss Ella Shields. First English appearance on 10 October 1904 at Forester's Music Hall. a talent scout lured Shields to London, where she was billed as the \\"Southern Nightingale.\\" In 1906 she married the songwriter William Joseph Hargreaves in Lambeth, London.See: England & Wales marriages 1837-2008, Volume 1D, Page 840, Line Number 150 In 1910 she appeared at the opening night of the London Palladium. It was at this time that she became a male impersonator. The story goes that one night in 1910 Shields was attending a party at which music-hall performers did their acts for one another. Half of a two-man musical act was out sick, and Shields put on trousers to fill in for him. This impromptu turn in trousers proved to be the turning point of her career and she rarely wore dresses on stage again. > ‚ÄòWith wavy auburn hair and dressed as a young man in evening dress, > nervously fingering his white tie, she made a very charming and gay > figure...and though she adopted the tattered clothes and worn top hat of the > traditional ‚Äúbroken down swell‚Äù act she did so with a difference, making of > what might have been ordinary broad comedy something delicate and, in its > way, almost moving.‚Äô In 1915 her song-writing husband, William Hargreaves, wrote \\"Burlington Bertie from Bow\\", a comic ditty about a penniless Londoner who affects the manner of a well-heeled gentleman. It was a parody of an earlier song, simply called Burlington Bertie, written by Harry B. Norris and made famous by Vesta Tilley.The Times(London, England), 6 August 1952, p. 6 Obituary: Miss Ella Shields. The song was allegedly intended by Hargreaves for a comic singer, J. W. Rickaby, who turned it down as too closely modelled on another. Shields sang the song, dressed up in slightly battered top hat and tails, in the role of Burlington Bertie 'himself'. She toured the world in this role, including appearances at Baltimore's now-demolished Maryland Theatre in 1924 and '26. The persona of Bertie haunted the rest of her life and she was known as Bertie as much as Ella. She and Hargreaves had separated in 1916 and they divorced in 1923.The Times (London, England), 8 May 1923, p. 5: High Court Of Justice. Under the name Mrs Ella Hargreaves, Shields petitioned for divorce from William Joseph Hargreaves, claiming her husband had treated her with aggravated cruelty before deserting her in 1916. She admitted that subsequently, between August 1917 and 1918, she had entered an adulterous relationship with a Colonel Christie, which had now ended. After evidence was given in corroboration she was granted a decree nisi with costs. The Depression brought difficult times for many entertainers, and Shields announced her retirement in 1929. She spent time working at a Macy's jewellery counter in New York. After a period of performing in obscurity, a music-hall reunion show called Thanks for the Memory put \\"Bertie\\" back in the spotlight. This show ran throughout England for over three years from 1947‚Äì51. Ella worked with many stars over the years, including a very young Julie Andrews in the late 1940s with whom she shared the same bill of a Royal Command Performance. Julie Andrews pays tribute to Ella Shields in her own one woman show and has recorded Shields' famous song \\"Burlington Bertie from Bow\\". It is possible that Julie Andrews used Ella Shields as her role model for 'Victor' in the film and stage musical Victor/Victoria. In August 1952, a septuagenarian Shields performed in northern England. Her death was dramatic. Singing her trademark song, in what would be her final show, instead of the traditional opening lines 'I'm Burlington Bertie', she began with 'I was Burlington Bertie'. After finishing the song she collapsed on stage and died three days later, without regaining consciousness, at Lancaster in Lancashire, on August 5, 1952. Her body was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium in London. In the cemetery courtyard she shares a memorial plaque with music hall star Nellie Wallace. Her repertoire of songs was related to her male- impersonation act, which was often in military attire. They included: :\\"Burlington Bertie from Bow\\" :\\"Baa Lambs\\" :\\"I'm Walking 'round the World\\" :\\"I Don't Admire the Girl in White (In the Army)\\" :\\"Oh!

It is the only species in the genus Pachydiplax. It is very common and widely distributed through North America and into the Bahamas. Although the species name longipennis means \\"long wings\\", their wings are not substantially longer than those of related species. Females do, however, have a short abdomen that makes the wings appear longer in comparison. The blue dasher grows up to 25‚Äì43 mm long (1-1.5 in). The males are easy to recognize with their vibrant blue color, yellow-striped thorax, and metallic green eyes. Females are somewhat less colorful than the male, an example of sexual dimorphism. While they have a matching yellow-striped thorax, their abdomen has a distinct brown and yellow striping that sets them apart from the male, along with contrasting red eyes. Both sexes develop a frosted color with age. File:Blue Dasher 039.jpg|thumb|Male on a lotus leaf File:Pachydiplax longipennis-female ovipositing.webm|thumb|Ovipositing Naperville USA ==Habitat== Blue dashers live near still, calm bodies of water, such as ponds, marshes, slow-moving waterways, and ditches, in warm areas typically at low elevations. The adults roost in trees at night. ==Diet== These dragonflies, like others of their infraorder, are carnivorous, and are capable of eating hundreds of insects every day, including mosquito and mayfly larvae. The adult dragonfly will eat nearly any flying insect, such as a moth or fly. Nymphs have a diet that includes other aquatic larvae, small fish, and tadpoles. These dragonflies are known to be voracious predators, consuming up to 10% of their body weight each day in food. The blue dasher hunts by keeping still and waiting for suitable prey to come within range. When it does, they dart from their position to catch it.http://ibis.geog.ubc.ca/biodiversity/factsheets/pdf/Pachydiplax_longipennis.pdf ==References== ==External links== Category:Libellulidae Category:Odonata of North America Category:Insects described in 1839 ","title":"Blue dasher"},{"id":"11645164","text":"Madame Irma is a 2006 comedy French film directed by Didier Bourdon and Yves Fajnberge and starring Didier Bourdon and Pascal L√©gitimus. ==Plot== Francis, a recently laid-off CEO, takes up dressing up as a woman Romanian fortune- teller to earn money.T√™tu, July‚ÄìAugust 2007 issue, page 212 ==Cast== * Didier Bourdon : Francis / Irma * Pascal L√©gitimus : Ludovic * Arly Jover : In√®s * Catherine Mouchet : Brigitte * Claire Nadeau : Nicole * Jacques Herlin : Mr. Blanchard * Julie Ferrier : The seer * Nad√®ge Beausson-Diagne : Sylvie * Soko : The schoolgirl ==References== ==External links== * Category:2006 films Category:French films Category:Films directed by Didier Bourdon ","title":"Madame Irma"},{"id":"11645172","text":"Applegate Lake is a reservoir located in the Rogue River‚ÄìSiskiyou National Forest about southwest of Medford in the U.S. state of Oregon. It is south of Oregon Route 238 along Applegate River Road and slightly north of the Oregon- California border. The lake is an impoundment of the Applegate River about from its confluence with the Rogue River. ==History== The United States Congress authorized construction of the Applegate Dam in 1962 as part of a flood-control project. In 1976, the Corps of Engineers began work on the dam, which was finished in 1980 at a final cost of $96 million dollars. In addition to controlling floods, the dam was intended to store water for irrigation and recreation. Applegate Dam, long and high, created a lake stretching upstream. As the reservoir filled with water, it inundated the remnants of Copper, a community that had once had a post office and a few buildings. Since then, when water levels in the lake fall sufficiently, the highway that formerly ended at Copper reappears at the south (upstream) end of the lake and serves as the lower end of a boat ramp. Over 5,000 ounces of gold were recovered in the final two years of construction and proceeds were split between the federal government and two engineering firms involved. Applegate Lake holds up to of water. It and Lost Creek Lake, on the main stem of the Rogue River, are the only large multi-purpose Corps of Engineers reservoirs in the Rogue River basin. The lake, the dam, and other entities in this region were named for Lindsay Applegate. In 1848, he led a party of settlers through the Rogue River Valley on the way to mines in California. ==Recreation== Applegate Dam Applegate Lake has large populations of trout, landlocked Chinook salmon, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, and crappie. It is stocked each year with about 120,000 rainbow trout and about 50,000 young Chinook. Ramps, including two that are open year-round, provide access for boats. About of trails circle the reservoir. The United States Forest Service maintains campgrounds as well as places along the shore for fishing, picnicking, and swimming as well as boating. Mountain biking is allowed on one of the trails, and horses are allowed on three. ==See also== * List of lakes in Oregon ==References== Category:Reservoirs in Oregon Category:Rogue River (Oregon) Category:Lakes of Jackson County, Oregon Category:Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest Category:Protected areas of Jackson County, Oregon Category:Dams in Oregon Category:Buildings and structures in Jackson County, Oregon Category:United States Army Corps of Engineers dams Category:Dams completed in 1980 Category:1980 establishments in Oregon ","title":"Applegate Lake"},{"id":"11645173","text":"She's My Baby may refer to: * \\"She's My Baby\\" (Traveling Wilburys song), 1990 * \\"She's My Baby\\" (Wings song), 1976 * \\"She's My Baby\\", a song by Faithless from Sunday 8PM * \\"She's My Baby\\", a song by Fats Domino * \\"She's My Baby\\", a song by Johnny O'Keefe * \\"She's My Baby\\", a song by Mazzy Star from So Tonight That I Might See * \\"She's My Baby\\", a song by the Rocket Summer from Calendar Days * \\"She's My Baby (And She's Outta Control)\\", a song from the soundtrack to Fast Times at Ridgemont High * She's My Baby, a 1928 musical by Rodgers and Hart ","title":"She's My Baby"},{"id":"11645231","text":"Obtained Enslavement was a black metal band from Stord, Norway.

Instead they end up waking and taking Meeko as well. She accompanies them in their vehicle (a balloon that resembles a cheshire cat) with a tired Toriyasu. The cats soon reach their own world: Banipal Witt, a world of incredibly strange variety. Suddenly, they run into the Sleeping Cat, the very support of Banipal Witt. If the Sleeping Cat wakes, their world would be destroyed. The two children soon find that Banipal Witt is far different than their home: Three minutes in the human world is one day in Banipal Witt and the cats are only anthropomorphic in Banipal Witt (Henoji having remarked that, because of the human world, their life expectancy has decreased). Both Toriyasu and Meeko are turned into anthropomorphic kittens by the sun of Banipal Witt (which is magical in nature) as soon as they set foot on Banipal Witt. Soon, the kids meet the leader of a resistance: Master Sandada, a powerful wizard. Sadly, in the absence of the trio sent to find Toriyasu and Meeko, Sandada has fallen victim to a curse from Lady Buburina, a dictator-like princess that has gone insane and (due to an enchantment) turns anyone she touches into a balloon. Sandada was unable to protect himself, because his last line of defense- a mystic glove called the Sorcerer's Arm -was stolen by DohDoh, his apprentice that had fallen to insanity due to a curse. Master Sandada explains that he brought Toriyasu here to catch Papadoll, who has supposedly been wreaking havoc across Banipal Witt. ChuChu, DohDoh's younger sister and the strongest fighter for the resistance, comes to warn that Papadoll has been abducting more villagers and is approaching their location fast. Papadoll soon arrives and the kids can't believe their eyes: Their dog has been turned into a giant, flying monster. DohDoh leaves Sandada with an ultimatum from Buburina: If Sandada doesn't surrender before the next sunrise, great disaster shall befall Banipal Witt. Meeko manages to get Papadoll to calm down, but an interruption from Toriyasu sends Papadoll into a fit of rage. In the confusion, Meeko is taken hostage and things begin to look grim. Some time later, Sandada explains that when a creature from another world is touched by the sun twice, they become what Papadoll has become. Expectedly, Toriyasu freaks out, demanding to go home, but the others manage to reason with him because of the fact that he needs to save his sister. Meanwhile, at the palace, the prisoners (including Meeko) attempt to break out. Meeko comes close, but ends up trapped near the throne room. Listening in on a conversation between Buburina and her parents, she finds out that Buburina's power is supposed to be a punishment that was cast by a wizard who sought revenge against her for sending his daughter to her death (even though Buburina claimed that it wasn't her fault). Back at Sandada's manor, Toriyasu (along with Henoji, Suttoboke, HoiHoi and ChuChu) are sent by Sandada to Buburina's palace to knock Papadoll out with a pill that contains sleeping powder that Sandada claims would make an animal like Papadoll sleep for a week and Papadoll's chain. Before leaving, Sandada says that only Toriyasu has the power to turn Papadoll back to normal. Later that night, Buburina calls an assembly to inform her prisoners of their fate. She tells her prisoners of her plan to create a giant mouse that would be used to wake the Sleeping Cat should anyone rebel against her, sending Banipal Witt into turmoil. Meeko, however, ridicules Buburina's plan, claiming that Papadoll wouldn't do that. Meeko demands the return of Papadoll and insults the princess by calling her a witch. Buburina, having been upset by Meeko's insult, tries to turn her into a balloon and pop her, but finds she cannot (the curse only affects people from Banipal Witt). Realizing that Meeko is a human, Buburina plans to make Meeko her new monster slave once the sun rises. She then turns all her prisoners into balloons (so that she can finish her mouse balloon) and throws Meeko inside also. Under cover of night, Toriyasu and the others prepare to sneak into the castle to free Papadoll and save Meeko. Unfortunately, the plan goes awry, as Toriyasu accidentally wakes Buburina up when the rope he is on slips, setting off alarms all over the castle. Toriyasu and ChuChu make an escape, while Suttoboke (who broke off from the group because he got Meeko's scent) runs into DohDoh in an attempt to save Meeko. Quickly, Toriyasu and ChuChu (after having a bonding moment) regroup in time to see Suttoboke and Meeko release the mouse balloon. With Buburina's plan falling apart at the seams, DohDoh goes to try to kill Meeko and Suttoboke, while Toriyasu and ChuChu go to try to get Papadoll under control and stop Buburina. In the ensuing air battle, Toriyasu suffers through a temporary depression caused by DohDoh's taunting (having remembered a time when he beat Papadoll to release some built-up anger that had been caused by teasing from three neighborhood bullies). DohDoh, however, is dealt a hard fate by karma, as he breaks the mouse balloon when he gets too close to the castle and loses his hold on the Sorcerer's Arm. Toriyasu, remembering what Master Sandada had said before he left, regains faith in himself and tries to take Papadoll back. Buburina, however, refuses to give back Papadoll and nearly makes Toriyasu fall to his death after Buburina tears Papadoll's collar off. During his fall, Papadoll finally remembers Toriyasu (having ignored Buburina's orders to eat Toriyasu) and Toriyasu remembers how much Papadoll means to him (shown in flashback form). Toriyasu then goes insane for only a few seconds before regaining composure after landing on one of Buburina's victims. Using the victim as a means of transportation (even though the said victim tries to protest as best he can to this idea), he reaches Papadoll (avoiding seeking missiles fired by Buburina) and regains control of him with ChuChu's help. However, the signal tower (the enormous flare gun-like device that lights Banipal Witt's sun every morning) goes off, leaving Toriyasu and the others only a few seconds to save Meeko. Quickly, they rescue Meeko and make it home. Buburina and DohDoh both end up with miserable fates: Buburina is left sinking into a small lake, and DohDoh tangled in what remains of the mouse balloon. Toriyasu and Meeko return to normal (no longer transformed by Banipal Witt's sun), Toriyasu and ChuChu develop a relationship and the cats say that the two can visit any time and they can also choose to be cats again if they want. Before returning home, Meeko makes a prediction that Buburina will make a comeback. The next morning, Toriyasu and Meeko return to a normal life. Unbeknownst to the children, Meeko is right again: The cats go to Toriyasu and Meeko's school due to some urgent business that came up only recently, leaving the movie on a cliffhanger. ==Staff== *Original Creator, Director, Character Designs: Takashi Nakamura *Screenplay: Takashi Nakamura, Chiaki J. Konaka *Producers: Tar≈ç Maki, Yoshimi Asari, Hiroaki Inoue *Art Director: Shinji Kimura *Music: Shigeaki Saegusa *Sound Director: Shigeharu Shiba *Production: Triangle Staff *Distribution: T&K; Telefilm Sources: ==Cast== The actors are listed original voice actor first, English voice actor second. *Hiroaki Hori/Dorothy Elias Fahnhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114689/ as Toriyasu: One of the main characters and the primary protagonist of the movie. He is the older brother of Meeko. When first brought to Banipal Witt, he is freaked out by the prospect of a strange, new world that is hidden from sight, but he eventually warms up to the people of Banipal Witt and makes a few friends along the way (most notably ChuChu, who seems to be his love interest by the end of the film). Though he is, at first, uncaring as to the fact that Papadoll has gone missing, he begins to show care towards Papadoll, and becomes determined to bring him back home. Because he is a human, he is left unaffected by Buburina's curse. *Mirai Sasaki/Sandy Fox as Meeko: Toriyasu's little sister, and one of the main characters. She is the first to realize Papadoll's disappearance is by less-than-ordinary causes. She is kidnapped and taken to Buburina's castle as a prisoner early in the film, and is also the only prisoner not to be affected by Buburina's curse (because she is a human). She and Suttoboke are very close, Suttoboke acting as somewhat of a father figure to her. Unlike her brother, she was excited to be heading to another world. *Noriko Hidaka/Mary Elizabeth McGlynn as Buburina: One of the main characters, and the primary antagonist of the movie. She is a spoiled, rotten-to-the-core princess, who believes that everything belongs to her. When she was young, she inadvertently caused the death of a daughter to a court magician, who cursed Buburina with a spell that turns whatever living thing from Banipal Witt that she touches to be turned into a balloon. Unexpectedly, humans are left unaffected by Buburina's curse. She uses DohDoh's love for her as a weapon against him, taunting and teasing him (because he knows that if he even touches Buburina, he will end up another victim to her curse). She, apparently, has an extreme aversion towards water (as is shown near the end of the film, when her evil ways turn against her). *Mayumi Iizuka/Lia Sargent as ChuChu: One of the film's main characters and a protagonist. She is the little sister of DohDoh, and hopes he will break free of Buburina's control (though it seems unlikely this will happen). From her choice of clothes, it's apparent she is a knight or warrior of some kind. Apparently, she was looking forward to seeing a human (for reasons unknown), but is less than happy when Toriyasu shows up and begins to act like a jerk. However, as time goes on, she begins to respect and (eventually) love Toriyasu. *Masato Yamanouchi/Tom Wyner as Sandada: An elderly wizard, who is the leader of the resistance against Buburina. For most of the movie, he has been cursed by Buburina and forced to be pulled around by someone (usually Suttoboke or one of the rebel troops). His only source of protection, the Sorcerer's Arm, was stolen by DohDoh, who was his former apprentice. Near the end of the film, he regains the Sorcerer's Arm and everyone affected by Buburina's curse is restored (including himself). *Ichir≈ç Nagai/Michael Sorich as Henoji: One of three feline scientists sent by Master Sandada to find Toriyasu. He serves as the leader of the little expedition to the human world. He is generally pessimistic with many situations (such as Meeko wanting to come with Toriyasu to Banipal Witt). Like ChuChu, Henoji was extremely frustrated when Toriyasu began to act like a jerk, though Henoji later begins to respect Toriyasu as he begins to show care towards and becomes determined to bring Papadoll back home. He serves as the lookout on the Tomcat, as well as a timekeeper. Despite the fact he is a scientist, he is dressed very much like a nobleman. *J≈çji Yanami/Simon Prescott as HoiHoi: One of three feline scientists sent by Master Sandada to find Toriyasu. Unlike Henoji, he is cool and collected (though this doesn't mean he is always in a calm mood). He serves as the pilot on the Tomcat. Despite being a scientist, he is dressed like an actual pilot. *Sukekiyo Kameyama/Michael Forest as Suttoboke: One of three feline scientists sent by Master Sandada to find Toriyasu. He is the sensible member of the team. He shows great concern for Meeko, acting as a father figure of sorts. He shows great care towards his friends (and DohDoh, having expressed his and everyone's concern for him). He serves as a secondary pilot on the Tomcat. Despite the fact he is a scientist, he is dressed very much like a butler. *Fumihiko Tachiki as Papadoll: Toriyasu's dog. Though he and Toriyasu were once close friends, when Toriyasu unintentionally attacked Papadoll (due to a rage that was caused by the local bullies), Papadoll became unhappy living with Toriyasu. DohDoh soon came to the human world and \\"rescued\\" Papadoll, bringing him to Banipal Witt. Due to over-exposure from the sun, he mutated into a gigantic, flying dog monster. He had been in Banipal Witt for so long that he had forgotten who he really was. Only Toriyasu had the power to restore Papadoll to his former self. Papadoll was (of course) restored to his former self by the end of the movie, and once again became Toriyasu's friend. He was the only one to see Henoji, Suttoboke and HoiHoi enter Toriyasu and Meeko's bedroom. *Mitsuo Iwata/Dougary Grant as DohDoh: The former apprentice of Master Sandada, who was driven insane by a cursed painting of Buburina. Shortly after, he stole Master Sandada's invaluable and powerful Sorcerer's Arm and abandoned him to serve Buburina. He serves as Buburina's right-hand man. He desires Buburina's affection (due to the curse from the painting), which makes him a very dedicated minion. His cruelty towards Toriyasu, Meeko and the members of the resistance eventually comes back to turn against him, as he is ultimately tangled in the remains of the giant mouse balloon that Buburina made. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1995 anime films Category:Anime with original screenplays Category:Geneon USA Category:Japanese films Category:1995 animated films Category:1995 films Category:Animated films about cats ","title":"Catnapped!"},{"id":"11645288","text":"Valerie Yule Valerie Yule (born 2 January 1929 in Melbourne, Australia) is a researcher in literacy and imagination, clinical child psychologist,Description of Clinical Child Psychology academic, school psychologist and teacher, working in disadvantaged schools, Melbourne and Monash Universities in psychology and education; the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne and the Royal Aberdeen Children's Hospital; and hon. research fellow (Psychology) at Aberdeen University. ==Education== BA (Hons), History and English, MA Psychology, Dip Ed, and PhD Education - research thesis on Orthography and Reading, Spelling and Society. ==Memberships== Fellow of the Galton InstituteDr Valerie Yule CV (UK); Member, British Psychological Society; Vice-President, Simplified Spelling SocietySimplified Spelling Society (UK); Member, Independent Scholars Association of Australia,Independent Scholars Association of Australia and of Australian educational and social reforming organizations.

It is almost completely surrounded by another DOP (La Mancha) but is an independent DOP due to its long history of producing a distinct style of wine known aloque or clarete which is made by mixing white and red grapes. 2016¬¥s harvest is formed by 55.9 million kilos of red grapes and 43.2 million kilos of white grapes. Valdepe√±as is a natural crossroads between the south of Spain, the Mediterranean regions to the east, Extremadura to the west and central plains to the north. To the south of the DOP is the Sierra Morena range a natural frontier with Andalusia, and to the east and west there are mountains reaching a height of 1000 m. The most prized vineyards are in Los Llanos in the west and in Las Aberturas in the north. The total area planted to vines is 22,332.11 ha (2016). ==History== Grape growing and wine production in the area was practiced by the ancient Iberians and of course by the ancient Romans. During the Moorish era the area became an important wine producing centre, due to a special concession from the Caliphate of Toledo. After the Reconquest by Christian forces there was a huge increase in demand and in production, and wine began to be shipped further afield to cities such as Madrid. Towards the end of the 18th century annual production was around 200,000 arrobas (3.2 million litres). Fermentation was carried out in enormous earthenware vats (with capacities of up to 1,600 litres) which were partially buried in the ground to help keep the temperature down. During the winter months the lees would fall to the bottom naturally and it was not necessary to clarify the wine. DO Valdepe√±as In 1861 a railway line connected Valdepe√±as to the coast and there was a further large increase in wine production this time for export abroad, especially to the Philippines and to South America. In 1895 the ‚ÄòWine Train‚Äô (tren del vino) began to ship wine to Madrid. In 1911 the phylloxera plague destroyed the vineyards, but the producers of the area were able to save their industry by grafting new varieties of grapes (especially Air√©n) onto phylloxera-resistant New World rootstocks. This moment of crisis forced the different producers to cooperate with each other and a regional federation was formed, which was subsequently transformed into the Regulatory Council of the DOP. Official DO status was granted in 1932. ==Climate== The climate is extreme continental (very hot summers and cold winters) and can be classified as semi-arid. Temperatures can reach 40¬∞C in summer and drop to -10¬∞C in winter. Droughts in summer are frequent, as are frosts in winter. Rainfall is sparse and generally falls in spring and autumn often in the form of violent storms. The risk of hailstones and strong winds is significant in spring. ==Soil== The DOP is located on a plateau surrounded by hills and whose soil has a high lime content, over a subsoil of calcium carbonate, with good moisture retaining properties. The topsoil is not deep and quite pebbly, dark red in color with a high lime content, which often forms hard crusty layers which have to be broken to help the roots penetrate. The soil is poor in organic matter. ==Grape Varieties== The authorised varieties are: * Red: Tempranillo / Cencibel, Garnacha, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah, and Petit Verdot * White: Air√©n, Macabeo, Chardonnay, Verdejo, Sauvignon blanc, and Moscatel de Grano Menudo ==Vines== The Air√©n variety was extensively planted after the phylloxera plague of 1911 due to its good resistance to high temperatures. As a result of this Air√©n makes up 65% of all vines planted in the area, although in recent years this percentage has been steadily declining. Other varieties, such as Macabeo, are also being used for white wines. Tempranillo (or Cencibel as it is known in the area) is the traditional variety used for red wines, although recently new varieties, such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Garnacha, are being used more. The vines are almost all planted in square or rectangular formation to allow mechanisation of the vineyard activities, and some newer plantations are on trellises to allow an increase in production. ==Wines== The majority of wines produced fall into the following four categories: young whites, young ros√©s, young reds, all made for consumption within one year. Some Crianzas, Reservas and Gran reserves are also produced. ==References== ==External links== * Valdepe√±as official website Category:Wine regions of Spain ","title":"Valdepe√±as (DO)"},{"id":"11645401","title":"Kemper County School District"},{"id":"11645403","text":"Herman Schueremans (born 5 January 1954) is a Flemish politician and concertpromotor.

King Bhumibol Adulyadej initiated a project to develop the Pa Sak River valley and lower Chao Phraya valley on 19 February 1989 as part of the Maenam Pa Sak Royal Development Project. On 4 July 1991 Prime Minister Anand Panyarachun set up a study group for the dam project. Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn presided over a royal ceremony on 15 June 1998, starting the storing of water in the reservoir. On 20 October 1991 King Bhumibol Adulyadej gave the dam its official name, Pa Sak Cholasit. The king also presided over the inauguration of the dam on 25 November 1999. The park is now also a tourist attraction . ==Travel by train== A special train stops on the dam ridge for tourists to take pictures and take a walk From November to January of the following year annually, a total of three months, the State Railway of Thailand (SRT) will open a special train for traveling from Hua Lamphong (Bangkok railway station) to here. It will be available only on Saturdays and Sundays, the excursion trains will leave Hua Lampong railway station at 7.10 am and reach the dam in Saraburi at 11.40 am. It will depart the dam at 3.30 pm and reach Hua Lampong at 6.20 pm. The main highlight of this trip is to take a photo on the dam ridge where the train stops, allowing passengers to stroll and take pictures. ==References== ==External links== *Pa Sak Cholasit Dam project *Pa Sak Cholasit Dam history Category:Dams in Thailand Category:Buildings and structures in Lopburi Province Category:Earth-filled dams Category:Hydroelectric power stations in Thailand Category:Dams completed in 1999 Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1999 Category:1999 establishments in Thailand Category:Dong Phaya Yen Mountains ","title":"Pa Sak Jolasid Dam"},{"id":"11645598","text":"Bastards may refer to: ==Film== * Bastards (2006 film), a 2006 Russian film * Bastards (2013 film), a 2013 French film by Claire Denis * Father Figures, a 2017 American comedy film originally called Bastards ==Music== * Lars Frederiksen and the Bastards, a 2000s American street punk band ===Albums=== * Bastards (Bj√∂rk album), 2012 * Bastards (Cerebral Fix album) or the title song, 1991 * Bastards (Mot√∂rhead album), 1993 * Bastards (Saigon Kick album), 1999 ===Songs=== * \\"Bastards\\", by the Bloody Hawaiians from The Threegos, 1994 * \\"Bastards\\", by Defeater from Letters Home, 2013 * \\"Bastards\\", by the Golden Dogs from Everything in 3 Parts, 2004 * \\"Bastards\\", by Kesha from Rainbow, 2017 * \\"Bastards\\", by the Real McKenzies from Clash of the Tartans, 1998 * \\"Bastards\\", by Shut Up and Dance, mixed by Nicolette, from DJ-Kicks: Nicolette, 1997 == See also == * Bastard (disambiguation) * The Bastards (disambiguation) * ¬°Bastardos!, the eighth studio album by rock band Blues Traveler ","title":"Bastards"},{"id":"11645599","text":"Albert Champagne (June 5, 1866 ‚Äì October 12, 1937) was a Saskatchewan rancher, hotel-owner and political figure.

The painting is from the bottom panel of a Northern Wei screen. Consort Ban started as a junior maid, became a concubine of Emperor Chengdi and quickly rose to prominence at court. She bore him two sons, but both died in infancy. Once she declined an invitation to ride in a palanquin because she feared to distract him from matters of state. She was also renowned as a great scholar, able to recite poems from the Shi Jing and a lot of other texts. Because neither the Empress Xu nor Consort Ban produced him an heir, the Empress Dowager Wang Zhengjun encouraged him to take more concubines. Around 19 BCE, however, Emperor Cheng took a liking to the dancing girl Zhao Feiyan and her sister Zhao Hede. They were both made concubines and he favored them over Empress Xu and Consort Ban. In 18 BCE both the Empress and Consort Ban were accused of witchcraft. Empress Xu was put under house arrest away from court, but Consort Ban pleaded her case. She used citations of Confucius and made a speech that impressed the emperor and he allowed her to stay at court. She then chose to become a lady in waiting to the Empress Dowager, instead of remaining consort to the Emperor. Consort Ban became part of the emperor's funeral park after his death in 7 BCE and died a year later. ===Family=== Consort Ban once saved her brother Ban Zhi from a charge of treason.

The lighthouses are on the Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge. The lighthouses were named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1981. ==Building of the lighthouses== ===Need=== During the times of Spanish exploration, Cape Romain was known as Cape Roman, and then briefly, Cape Carteret. The Cape's shoals were treacherous, extending seven to nine miles off the coast. In the days before lighthouses, many vessels and lives were lost when ships ventured onto the shoals, and wind and waves claimed them for the sea. ===First building=== When lighthouses were built to warn mariners away from the shoals, they saved many lives. The first lighthouse on Cape Romain was built by Winslow Lewis in 1827 on Northeast Raccoon Key. It cost $10,000 and the deal came with light keeper's quarters. The short, conical, brick lighthouse was 87 ¬Ω feet tall. Its red stationary light was fitted with 11 lamps and 21 inch reflectors. This lighthouse was a functional disappointment because the red, whale oil wick lamp could not be seen beyond 9‚Äì14 nautical miles. Today it is one of the few remaining lighthouses of its period in the U.S. ===Second building=== In 1853, $20,000 was appropriated to build a second lighthouse nearby, and to remove an old wind mill on Mill Island. A wick house, boat house, and two more dwellings were added nearby. During construction, builders noticed that the new brick tower leaned toward the mainland. The lean has worsened over the years and today the tower is more than three feet off plumb. Light keepers accessed the first order Fresnel lens after climbing 212 spiraling, cast-iron steps. The light was lit by oil lamp, with a revolving beam visible for 19 miles. ==Destruction and earthquakes== Just three years after the lighthouse was completed, the Civil War began, and lighthouses along the Atlantic Coast went dark. The light at Cape Romain was restored in 1866. On August 31, 1886, ‚ÄúThe keeper was in his house when the shock came. A gradually increasing rumbling ‚Äòsounding something like a battery of artillery or a troop of cavalry crossing a long bridge,‚Äô was heard before the shock. In less than a minute came the shocks, the first one lasting about two minutes, the next one as long and at about two minute intervals. The shocks did the tower no injury but its vibration was great. About a thousand ‚Äúcranes‚Äù nest on the Key during the summer months, and these were flying about ‚Äòmaking a fearful noise,‚Äô during the shock, (‚ÄúA Descriptive Narrative of the Earthquake of August 31, 1886, by Carlyle McKinley.) ==Lighthouse families== Opportunities for socializing were rare. Located seven miles from the mainland, isolation impacted every aspect of life for lighthouse families. Children had to be sent away to attend school. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, McClellanville‚Äôs villagers began holding ‚ÄúCape Parties‚Äù on Lighthouse Island. They played games, swam, caught fish, and collected crabs and oysters, then they roasted their tasty sea treats on the beach. Assistant keeper Hepburn Morrison (1893‚Äì1896), told his granddaughter, Judy Fortner, that ‚Äúthe girls loved‚Äù his uniform. To entertain visitors, he would climb to the top and stand on his head, with his legs wrapped around the lightning rod tip! ==Refuge== In 1932 Lighthouse Island, Cape Island, Raccoon Key, and thousands of acres of salt marsh and tidal creeks were included in the new Cape Romain Migratory Bird Refuge. At that time it was managed by the U.S. Biological Survey, now known as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. For many years, refuge employees have sought resourceful solutions to protect the lighthouses from the damaging winds, storms, and salt air, but time has taken its toll. Because national wildlife refuges are established to care for animals and their habitats, the funding the refuge receives is for habitat and species management, rather than historic preservation. When refuge employees linked their efforts with partner and supporter Tommy Graham, disintegration of the old lights slowed. Graham, a local historic restoration professional, worked with a team of refuge staff and volunteers to repair and repaint the lighthouses in 1983. Today he is working with Glenn Keyes, historic preservation architect, and John Moore, structural engineer, to design a solution for the rusted and unstable spiraling steps and to stabilize the structural instability of the lantern room. Four guided tours a year are offered by Cape Romain NWR, with transportation provided by Coastal Expeditions Ferry. == References == Have you seen the Lights? from \\"Life in the Wild\\", Volume 5, Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge, at http://www.fws.gov/caperomain/ == External links == *Lighthousefriends.com Cape Romain Lighthouses page *Current pictures from the Beach Bum's site Category:Lighthouses completed in 1827 Category:Lighthouses completed in 1857 Category:Lighthouses on the National Register of Historic Places in South Carolina Category:Buildings and structures in Charleston County, South Carolina Category:National Register of Historic Places in Charleston County, South Carolina Category:Inclined towers Category:1827 establishments in South Carolina ","title":"Cape Romain Lighthouses"},{"id":"11645798","text":"Toji san bijin (Three Beauties of the Present Day)From Bijin-ga (Pictures of Beautiful Women), published by Tsutaya Juzaburo The publisher's seal of Tsutaya J≈´zabur≈ç Tsutaya J≈´zabur≈ç (; 13 February 1750 ‚Äì 31 May 1797) was the founder and head of the Tsutaya publishing house in Edo, Japan, and produced illustrated books and ukiyo-e woodblock prints of many of the period's most famous artists. Tsutaya's is the best-remembered name of all ukiyo-e publishers. He is also known as Tsuta-J≈´ and J≈´zabur≈ç I. Tsutaya set up his shop in 1774 and began by publishing guides to the Yoshiwara pleasure quarters. By 1776 he was publishing print series, and went on to publish some of the best-known artists of the late 1700s. He is best remembered for his association with Utamaro and as the sole publisher of Sharaku. \\"Tsutaya\\" is not a true surname, but a yag≈ç \\"shop name\\" that translates as \\"Ivy Shop\\". The publisher used a seal of ivy leaves under a stylized Mount Fuji as a publisher's mark. ==Life and career== J≈´zabur≈ç's father is believed to have been a member of the Maruyama clan and a worker in the Yoshiwara, Edo's pleasure district. Born in the Yoshiwara, J≈´zabur≈ç was adopted into the Kitagawa family and given the name \\"Tsutaya\\" after the shop name of one of the Kitagawa's tea houses. Tsutaya opened his publishing business in Shinyoshiwara Gojukkend≈ç Higashigawa in Edo in 1774 and began publishing with a volume of illustrations of Yoshiwara beauties by Kitao Shigemasa called Hitome Senbon (\\"Thousands at a Glance\\"); Tsutaya's other early publications were also guides to the pleasure quarters. With the publisher Urokogataya, Tsutaya co-published the Yoshiwara Saiken (\\"Guide to Yoshiwara\\") from around 1774‚Äì75, and published it solo from 1776 to 1836 with illustrations by such artists as Katsukawa Shunsh≈ç. Also from 1776 Tsutaya began publishing books of haiku poetry, sharebon books, and ehon picture books, and with publisher Nishimura Yohachi, Tsutaya co-published his first print series in 1776: Kory≈´sai's Hinagata Wakana no Hatsumoy≈ç (\\"Models for Fashion: New Designs as Fresh Young Leaves\\"). Tsutaya did not continue with the series, though, and Nishimura finished publishing it alone in 1781. In 1883, he began publishing kiby≈çshi by the famous writer H≈çseid≈ç Kisanji, marking the beginning of his popularity and success. He soon expanded into books of ky≈çka (comic waka poetry). He moved his shop to Nihonbashi T≈çriaburach≈ç Minamigawa in 1783. The same year, he took over the publishing house of Maruya Kohei, and began publishing Utamaro the same year. Over the course of his career, Tsutaya discovered and supported artists and writers such as Utamaro, Sharaku, Bakin, Jippensha Ikku, and Sant≈ç Ky≈çden, producing thousands of prints based on the artists' designs, printing the writers' books, encouraging these creative talents, and serving as their patron and mentor. Though he enjoyed great contemporary success and profits for his publications, his fame today likely derives more from his ability to discover and nurture great talents. Without his efforts, many of the period's most famous and talented artists and writers may not have ever emerged. The Kansei Reforms, instituted from 1787‚Äì1793, brought strict censorship and strict penalties. In 1791 Sant≈ç Ky≈çden was placed under house arrest in shackles, and Tsutaya was forced to pay a large monetary penalty for publishing his politically volatile works. For a period of ten months in 1794‚Äì1795, he printed and edited the entire work of the great artist Sharaku, to great contemporary success and profits. As Sharaku's identity remains a subject of debate, some scholars claim he and J≈´zabur≈ç may have been the same person,Frederic, Louis. \\"Tsutaya J≈´zabur≈ç.\\" Japan Encyclopedia. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2002. although this is unlikely.For more on Tsutaya, see Davis, Julie Nelson. \\"Tsutaya J≈´zabur≈ç: Master Publisher\\". Designed for Pleasure: The World of Edo Japan in Prints and Paintings, 1680‚Äì1860. Edited by Julia Meech and Jane Oliver. New York: Asian Society, 2008. Tsutaya died at the age of 48 in 1797. Some sources claim the cause to have been beriberi. His business continued under his chief clerk Y≈´suke, who took on the name J≈´zabur≈ç II; production became sporadic from the 1810s, and appears to have ceased by the early 1850s. ==Legacy== Tsutaya is the best-remembered ukiyo-e print publisher, largely due to his promotion of Utamaro and as the sole publisher of Sharaku. Richard Lane called him \\"the greatest of the print publishers\\".Lane, Richard. Images from the Floating World. Old Saybrook, CT: Konecky & Konecky, 1978. p. 127. Tsutaya was well known for his ky≈çka poetry, which he wrote under the pseudonym Tsuta no Karamaru. He lodged writers and artists in his home, including Kyokutei Bakin, Sant≈ç Ky≈çden, and Utamaro, the last of whom still lived there at the time of Tsutaya's death. His portrait appeared in at least five books during his lifetime, and his shop appeared in 1799 in Hokusai's Ehon Azuma Asobi (\\"Picture Book of the Pleasure Spots of the Eastern Capital\\"). His work is held in the collection of the National Diet Library. ==References== ===Works cited=== * * Lane, Richard. (1978). Images from the Floating World, The Japanese Print.

From an initial Symbolist bent, he developed a distinctive, lunfardo-rich style from an early age, and by 1925 he had his first piece, Pompas de jab√≥n, sung by Carlos Gardel. Other notable compositions include Madame Ivonne, Che, papusa, o√≠, Anclado en Par√≠s, Mu√±eca brava, Al Mundo le falta un Tornillo, Pa' que bailen los muchachos and Los mareados (\\"The dizzy ones\\"), originally titled Los dopados (\\"The doped ones\\"), about a couple that vows to get drunk after realizing their love is over. ==Career== Also prolific as a writer, he published three volumes of lyrical poetry (Canciones grises, 1926; La luna del bajo fondo, 1940; and Viento que lleva y trae, 1945), three biographical and historical books (El debut de Gardel en Par√≠s, La historia del tango en Par√≠s and Mis memorias), some theatrical works (La epopeya del tango and La baba del diablo, both co-written with F√©lix Pelayo, and El romance de dos vagos in collaboration with Germ√°n Ziclis) and the narrative pieces El cantor de Buenos Aires, with Alberto Ballerini, and Los cuentos de un pr√≠ncipe with Mart√≠n Lemos.

It is one of the few green areas in the city, and includes Giza's largest park. The zoo covers about , and is home to many endangered species, as well as a selection of endemic fauna. The first to be built in the Middle East, rare species have been successfully bred in the zoo‚Äîincluding the first California sea lion to be born in the region. ==History== The zoo was built by Khedive Ismail and opened on 1 March 1891. It was built on about 50 feddan () that was once part of the harem gardens. Ismail imported many plants from India, Africa, and South America, of which a banyan tree planted about 1871 can still be seen. The original 180 birds and 78 other animals in the zoo's collection were taken from Ismail's private menagerie. In the late 1870s the state took over the zoo as partial payment of the Ismail's debts. In January 1890, the harem building was opened as a natural history museum, and was used in this manner until a new museum was opened in Tahrir Square in 1902. The portion of the gardens facing the Nile were sold to the public for large homes, but the harem gardens were kept intact. When the zoo was built, the exhibits with semi-natural habitats were considered spacious by European standards. The animal collection emphasized Egyptian species, and at one time claimed 20,000 individuals representing 400 species, though many of these may have been migratory birds. Around 1900 Captain Stanley Smyth Flower was appointed director of the Gardens. He would remain in that position until his retirement in 1923. From 1906 to 1923 Michael John Nicoll was his assistant. For a short time he was director, but the next year he had to retire. J. Lewis Bonhote worked at the Gardens from 1913 to 1919. By the mid-twentieth century, the zoo was considered one of the best zoos in the world, but it has had trouble adapting to the pressures of growth in the latter half of the century as human populations in Cairo have increased. By the end of World War II the zoo claimed 4,700 exhibits, with a total of 700 mammals and 500 reptiles. Attendance levels of 43,567 in 1889 rose to 223,525 by 1906. In 2007, the zoo hosted almost 3.4 million visitors. In 2004, the zoo lost its membership with the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA), because it did not pay membership fees, and then ignored the recommendations of WAZA inspectors.

The band released their second album (their last), To Prevent The Earth From Moving With You, on June 30, 2009. ==History== In 1995, Disagree was founded by two high-school students, Zahid and Hamka. Together with other band members Lan and Amir, the quartet gigged around KL and recorded their first demo, Never Cry Wolf in 1996. According to Zahid, the studio in which they recorded it was Bach & Traz, and it appeared that they were the last band to record in the studio which closed down a week later. He added that they managed to record 10 songs, of which only two were salvaged for the frequent gigging list. It was not until interest was sparked in 1997 by Miracle Music, a small independent label, did Disagree record their 2nd demo, untitled. However, the dream faded quickly due to internal label obscurities and their hopes were dashed. Since then, members were focusing their interests on other things and the band took a hiatus from the scene for two years. Disagree resurfaced when Zahid and Hamka responded to a rumour that a rock concert would be held somewhere in Kuala Lumpur. In fact, there was really one, which is the first Rock the World being held in 1 Utama just outside the capital. The band played to 10,000 people, who then motivated the band to come together again and record music. However, Lan and Amir departed soon after, eventually replaced by Aziz and Ashroff. In 2001, Disagree made a new demo called Homemade Jam that quickly gained popularity. The demo gained radio airplay on the now-defunct Wow FM as well as hitz.fm and various magazines voted the demo the most popular and groundbreaking demo to be reviewed. The band started to become more actively involved in the scene as they stepped into the shoes of gig organizers. In 2002, they promoted their music in the Fat Ant Music Festival. Later that same year, Disagree opened for 'Rock the World II', one of their biggest achievements to date and continued to join the line-up for subsequent Rock the Worlds. Since then they have become a staple offering in the annual Rock the World. It was around the time of Rock the World III when Fat Boys Records, an independent label run by Jason Lo who signed grunge bands Naked Breed, showed interest on Disagree. With talks beginning in 2003, Disagree went prepared to record of their d√©but album. Within 10 months, including the mastering in California, they completed their debut 11-track album At the End of the Day for release on 10 February 2004. In 2005, Disagree began picking up awards beginning with the Award for Most Airplay in hitz.fm's inaugural Malaysian English Top 10 Awards, followed by Best New English Language Artiste at the 12th Anugerah Industri Muzik.http://www.aim.com.my/2007/pastwinner.html AIM Past winners In 2006, they collaborated with Pop Shuvit to make a song and music video dedicated to football (soccer) fans during the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The song was titled Football Mad Nation and the making of the song and video was sponsored by Celcom. In 2007, Disagree became part of Nokia You Make It Reel, a competition for aspiring music video directors. Later that same year, they joined Ikon Malaysia. They launched their 2nd album, To Prevent The Earth From Moving With You in 2009. ==Band members== ===Current members=== *Zahid (Lead Vocals, Lead Guitar) (1995‚Äì2011) *Hamka (Drums) (1995‚Äì2011) *Effi Nazrel Saharudin (Bass) (2000‚Äì2011) *David (Rhythm Guitar) (2008‚Äì2011) ===Former members=== *Lan (Rhythm Guitar) (1995‚Äì1999) *Amir (Bass) (1995‚Äì1999) *Ashroff (Rhythm Guitar) (2000‚Äì2008) ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== *2004: At the End of the Day *2009: To Prevent The Earth From Moving With You ===Other Releases=== *1996: Never Cry Wolf *2002: Homemade Jam ==References== ==External links== *Official website *Disagree's Myspace site Category:Malaysian alternative rock groups Category:Musical groups established in 1995 Category:Malaysian progressive rock groups Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2011 ","title":"Disagree (band)"},{"id":"11645956","text":"Big Brother Thailand is the Thai version of the Big Brother reality television show based on the Dutch television series of the same name originally created by John de Mol in 1997.

Many speakers do not realize that they are incorporating English words into Telugu sentences or Telugu words into English sentences. For example, instead of saying dhanyavadhamulu for \\"thank you\\", most people say chala thanks literally translating to \\"a lot of thanks.\\" This type of Telugu speaking is slowly growing outside of cities like Hyderabad, Vizag, Vijayawada, Khammam, Guntur and Warangal. As English becomes more and more prevalent, it can be seen in small towns, villages, and even rural areas. With its growing popularity, Tenglish is being used to publish news online. The advent of cable television and its pervasive growth has seen the masses exposed to a wide variety of programming from across the world. Another factor contributing to the spread of Tenglish is the popularity of Tollywood films and TV channels.

Originally planted in Sydney, Australia, Hillsong College has grown to have numerous campuses across Australia, with study options available online and are opening their first USA campus in Phoenix, Arizona in August 2019. ==History== Hillsong College began as two separate entities within the following churches: Hills Christian Life Center and Sydney Christian Life Center. Although these two ministry schools could be found in different locations, under two different names, they were connected right from the start. The shared goal was to provide a training center that specialised in ministry and leadership development grounded within the local church. Both colleges were advanced side by side and maintained similar ethos. The theological education and training was centered around a practical ministry model, combined with an emphasis on creative arts and dedicated to the values of excellence, diligence and servanthood. The desired outcome was to prepare students for the practical ministry needs of the local church, while providing recognisable qualifications comparable to that of other theological institutes. In the year 1999, Hills Christian Life Center joined Sydney Christian Life Center as one organisation under a new name: Hillsong Church. Shortly after this union, in the year 2000, the two separate Colleges combined to form, what was then branded, Hillsong International Leadership College. Both of these original campuses have their own unique history. ===City campus=== The first of the two original locations began in 1983. Originally known as the International Institute for Creative Ministries (IICM) under the leadership of Sydney Christian Life Center. IICM‚Äôs curriculum centered around a few major topics: theology, creative arts, and missions. Students were encouraged to communicate their faith through many forms of artistic expression: music, dance, drama, visual art, and more. The student body consisted of a high number of international students. Courses were endorsed by the Department of Immigration in addition to being recognised by the Assemblies of God (AOG) denomination and the Asia-Pacific Theological Association (APTA). In 1990, Robert Fergusson was made Principal of IICM. At this point, the college began to emphasise practical ministry training within a local church setting. With this shift in leadership and focus, the name was also updated and known as Aquila College of Ministries. ==Accreditation== Vocational Hillsong College and its courses are through the Australian Skills Quality Authority (ASQA).

The DEP, later the DEPDC, was founded in 1988 by Sampop Jantraka, as a response to the practice of selling young children into the sex industry. Women and children of Thai nationality are being increasingly victimized, but additionally and especially vulnerable to this type of exploitation are children of refugee, or \\"stateless\\", status, who have no citizenship and therefore no access to education, health care or legitimate work opportunities. DEPDC offers free education, vocational training, and full-time accommodation for young girls and boys, and helps combat human trafficking in the Mekong sub-region.We Care. Daughters Education Programme ==History== DEPDC started in 1989 by helping nineteen girls, founded as the Daughters Education Program, their program has now expanded to helping over 400 girls find alternatives to entering the sex trade. DEPDC works with community leaders to identify which girls are going to be at a higher level of risk to enter the sex trade, they then work with the family to gain their trust and support. Gaining the family's trust and support is crucial to the success of the girls; however, they program does offer alternative living arrangements for girls that are not allowed to stay with their family. Sompop Jantraka, a winner of the Wallenberg Medal, grew up impoverished in southern Thailand. In 1988, while working to identify why women and children went into prostitution, he decided that working to eliminate this epidemic was to be his life goal. He used the money that he earned as a researcher to pay families of girls that would have otherwise been sent to a life of sexual slavery, but instead were allowed to stay home and obtain their education. ==Mission== The DEPDC's mission is to \\"aim to instil self-confidence and positive attitudes among the children as well as improve the material, social, and spiritual quality of life for these children and their communities.\\" ==Projects== * Half Day School: Based in Mae Sai, this project provides basic education and vocational training to the vulnerable children in the surrounding area so that they are less likely to end up in exploitative situations. * Mekong Regional Indigenous Child Rights Home (MRICRH): Based in Mae Chan, this project provides accommodation, swimming lessons, and enrolment in the local school as well as basic English lessons for indigenous and at risk children. * Sustainable Agricultural Skills Training: As part of their vocational training, children in all DEPDC shelters are thought to be self-sufficient through agricultural activities such as the planting, growing, and harvesting of crops. ==Donors== The projects are sponsored and supported by the ILO, UNICEF, USAID, Oxfam Netherlands and others. In addition, The Thailand Project: Higher Education as Humanitarian Aidhttp://www.thethailandproject.org/index.htm proposes to partner non- governmental organizations with American universities with the goal of offering educational opportunities to stateless young women like those who attended DEPDC in order to give these individuals the tools to return to their home country and work to combat the conditions that cause child exploitation and prostitution. ==References== ==External links== *DEPDC website Category:Children's charities based in Thailand Category:Organizations established in 1988 Category:1988 establishments in Thailand ","title":"Development and Education Programme for Daughters and Communities"},{"id":"11646231","text":"The Professional Football Championship' tournament played in 1986 for five clubs.

Captured by Kurdish Peshmarga forces in Iraqi Kurdistan and turned over to American intelligence in early 2004, Ghul was said to have served as anywhere from a courier who delivered messages for al-Qaeda members to a high-ranking associate of either Osama bin Laden, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, or Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. He was held at a CIA black site for two years. It was during this time of detainment in early 2004, but before he was subjected to torture, that Ghul listed al-Kuwaiti as a close associate of bin Laden. CIA records show that Ghul was not the first source of the name \\"al-Kuwaiti,\\" which was also provided in 2002 by another detainee, Abu Zubair al-Ha'ili, who was being held by a foreign government. In 2006, Ghul was transferred to the custody of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence, which released him in 2007.Testimony of Rangzieb Ahmed Ghul was killed by a CIA drone strike in North Waziristan in October 2012. ==History== Ghul was mentioned in the 9/11 Commission report, where he was stated to have led three people, including Mushabib al-Hamlan, to a guesthouse run by Abu Zubaydah. He was captured on January 23, 2004 by Kurdish security forces at a border crossing to Iran near Kalar after they confirmed Hassan's identity with a photograph emailed to CIA officials. There are contradicting claims that he was caught entering Iraq to bring al-Zarqawi money and bomb schematics or that he was caught leaving Iraq bringing al- Zarqawi's progress report on successful suicide bombings into Iraq. Ghul was carrying a USB flash drive and two CDs, one allegedly including a 17-page progress report believed to have been written by al-Zarqawi, claiming responsibility for suicide attacks in Iraq. US Intelligence officials have contradicted the accepted story, stating that the progress report was instead found in an abandoned safehouse in Baghdad. In addition, the US military provided the media with \\"photocopies of the original handwritten Arabic letter\\" which were then translated, muddying the claim that it had been a computer document. A notebook in his satchel also revealed a number of names and phone numbers of suspected associates. Kurdish forces immediately turned Ghul over to the American military, and he was interrogated while still in the country. Although he may have been cooperative with the military interrogation, his questioning revealed little. It was also believed that he was a member of Ansar al-Islam. ==Statements about his capture== Following his capture, Fox News reported that he had been an al-Qaeda member since the very beginning of the group, at least ten years earlier, and was widely known as \\"The Gatekeeper\\" in terrorist circles, although no corroboration or other sources have supported these claims. There have been similarly unreferenced suggestions in the media that Ghul played a role in the 1998 US Embassy bombings in Africa. Three days after his capture, Ghul was mentioned in a speech by President George W. Bush: Six days after his capture, U.S. Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez referred to Ghul stating \\"the capture of Ghul is pretty strong proof that al-Qaida is trying to gain a foothold [in Iraq] to continue their murderous campaigns.\\" CIA Director George Tenet mentioned Ghul in his testimony to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence as an al-Qaeda member who would \\"never again threaten the American people\\", after allegedly being \\"sent to case Iraq for an expanded al-Qaeda presence there.\\"Testimony of Director of Central Intelligence George J.

In June 2007, he was one of 39 people cited in a joint release by HRW, Cageprisoners, Center for Constitutional Rights and the New York University School of Law as prisoners who have not been accounted for, and are likely held in secret CIA Black sites. ==Release and death== In 2006, two and a half years after his capture, Ghul was transferred to a secret Pakistani prison system, where he was held alongside British suspect Rangzieb Ahmed. The two spoke to each other, and Ghul told him that he was held at a secret CIA location for two and a half years and had also passed through Morocco. He was again transferred to an unknown location in January 2007. Ghul was released by the Pakistanis in 2007. He was thought to have rejoined militants and returned to the battlefield. For some time his whereabouts were unknown,https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=137191347 but Ghul was eventually killed by a US drone strike on October 1, 2012. The National Security Agency deployed an arsenal of cyber-espionage tools, secretly seizing control of laptops, siphoning audio files and other messages, and tracking radio transmissions to find Ghul. After intercepting an e-mail from Ghul's wife, the NSA was able to locate Ghul and handed over the information to the Central Intelligence Agency which employed a drone to kill Ghul. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2012 deaths Category:Saudi Arabian al-Qaeda members Category:Pakistani al-Qaeda members Category:People subject to extraordinary rendition by the United States Category:Deaths by drone strikes of the Central Intelligence Agency in Pakistan ","title":"Hassan Ghul"},{"id":"11646307","text":"Faizul Islam (born 6 September 1986 in Khulna) is a Bangladeshi former first- class cricketer active 2003‚Äì2006 who played for Barisal Division.

The north- west corner is occupied by part of the Lockyer State Forest. ==History== The area was first settled in 1841, by George Mocatta. He named his pastoral run Grantham, which became the name of the town. In 1866 a railway siding from the main Toowoomba line was opened which assisted in the development of a small settlement. It wasn't until the mid-1879s that the Grantham railway station was built. In August 1895 tenders were called for the erection of a provisional school at Grantham Scrub. In January 1896 teacher Catherine M. Ludeman was appointed to the Grantham Scrub Provisional School, suggesting it opened around that time. On 1 January 1909 it became Grantham Scrub State School. It closed circa 1950. Grantham Provisional School opened on 23 January 1905. On 1 January 1909 it became Grantham State School. A butter factory was established in 1907.

A√©roplanes Voisin was a French aircraft manufacturing company established in 1905 by Gabriel Voisin and his brother Charles, and was continued by Gabriel after Charles died in an automobile accident in 1912; the full official company name then became Soci√©t√© Anonyme des A√©roplanes G. VoisinGunston, 1993, says the full name was \\"A√©roplanes G. Voisin\\". On the other hand the avions-voisin.org webpage specifies the name as \\"Soci√©t√© A√©roplanes Voisin, Soci√©t√© Anonyme\\". (). During World War I, it was a major producer of military aircraft, notably the Voisin III. After the war Gabriel Voisin abandoned the aviation industry, and set up a company to design and produce luxury automobiles, called Avions Voisin. ==Early History== Raymonde de Laroche, first woman to earn a pilot's licence, with Voisin Harry Houdini in Voisin-Farman Gabriel Voisin had been employed by Ernest Archdeacon to work on the construction of gliders and then entered into partnership with Louis Bl√©riot, to form the company Ateliers d' Aviation Edouard Surcouf, Bl√©riot et Voisin in 1905. Following a disagreement, Gabriel Voisin bought out Bl√©riot and on 5 November 1906 established the Appareils d'Aviation Les Fr√®res Voisin with his brother Charles (). The company, based in the Parisian suburb of Billancourt, was the first commercial aircraft factory in the world.Davilla p. 541 It created Europe's first manned, heavier-than-air powered aircraft capable of a sustained (1 km), circular, controlled flight, including take-off and landing, the Voisin-Farman I. Having learned to fly with a Voisin, on 8 March 1910, Raymonde de Laroche became the first woman to receive a pilot licence when the A√©ro-Club de France issued her licence #36. In South Africa, on 28 December 1909, French aviator Albert Kimmerling made the first manned, heavier-than-air powered flight in Africa in a Voisin 1907 biplane. 1910 to 1920 - Early Flying in South Africa Like many early aircraft companies, Voisin built machines to the designs of their customers which helped support their own experiments. The company's first customers were a M. Florencie,Opdycke 1999 p.263 who commissioned them to build an ornithopter he had designed, and Henri Kapferer, for whom they built a pusher biplane of their own design. The latter was underpowered, having a Buchet engine of only , and it failed to fly. However, Kapferer introduced them to Leon Delagrange, for whom they built a similar machine, powered by a Antoinette engine. This was first successfully flown by Charles Voisin on 30 March 1907, achieving a straight-line flight of .Nouveaux Essais de l'A√©roplane Delagrangel'A√©rophile , April 1907, p.105 In turn Delagrange introduced them to Henri Farman, who ordered an identical aircraft. These two aircraft are often referred to by their owners' names as the Voisin-Delagrange No.1marked on the side-curtains of the tail unit as L√©on Delagrange No. 1 and the Voisin-Farman No.1,marked on the side-curtains of the tail unit as Henri Farman No. 1 and were the foundation of the company's success. On 13 January 1908 Farman used his aircraft to win the \\"Grand Prix de l'aviation\\" offered by Ernest Archdeacon and Henry Deutsch de la Meurthe for the first closed-circuit flight of over a kilometer. Since the Wright Brothers would provide no evidence of their own accomplishments, they were widely disbelieved at the time, so this was a major breakthrough in the conquest of the air, and brought Voisin many orders for similar aircraft. Around sixty would be built. ==Major Designs of 1907-1914== 1910 experimental two-seater biplane with mitrailleuse fired by the passenger Voisin Canard floatplane on the Seine in 1911.

Examples would also be used by the Belgian and Romanian Air Services, and a few even survived the war to be used in the Ukraine, and in Russia.Davilla pp.547-550 Soon after the outbreak of the First World War, it became apparent that the French aviation industry could not produce aircraft in sufficient numbers to meet military requirements. Manufacturers from various other fields became aviation subcontractors, and later license-builders as did many smaller aircraft manufacturers who had been unable to secure orders for their own designs. By 1918, Voisin was involved with the Voisin-Lafresnaye company, a major constructor of airframes, and the Voisin-Lefebvre company, a major builder of aircraft engines. The Voisin III was followed by a small number of the 37mm cannon armed Voisin IV Type LB and Type LBS, and were the only wartime designs with staggered wings.Davilla pp.550-551 The B in the factory designations indicate that the airframe was equipped with a cannon, although some had it removed in service.Davilla p.559 The S indicates that the engine was raised (sur√©lev√©) compared to the original installation.Davilla p.544 Three hundred of the improved Voisin V Type LAS aircraft followed.Davilla p.552 The Voisin VI Type LAS was a development of the V fitted with a Salmson radial, of which only around 50 were built despite the improved performance as the basic type was considered to be obsolete.Davilla p.556 The larger Type LC, Voisin VII, followed in 1916 with the engine cooling radiators moved to the nose, but was not a success as it was badly underpowered and only a hundred of these were built.Davilla p.557 Voisin built a large Triplane powered by four Salmson water-cooled aero- engines in 1915 with twin superimposed fuselage booms, however it attracted no orders, but its wings were reused in 1916 for the E.28 triplane bomber which was now powered by four V8 Hispano-Suiza 8B engines, which likewise failed to secure any orders.Davilla pp.552 & 557-558 Also in 1915, Voisin built the Type M in which the fuselage was below the lower wing, and the engine filled the gap between the wings, however neither it, nor the otherwise similar twin fuselage Type O were successful.Davilla p.570 Following the Voisin VII came the more powerful, and more successful Voisin VIII Type LAP and Type LBP. This was the French army's main night bomber in 1916 and 1917, with over one thousand built.Davilla pp.559-561 The Voisin IX, or Type LC (the designation was reused), was an unsuccessful lightened development of the VIII for a reconnaissance aeroplane, which lost out to the Salmson 2 and Breguet 14.Davilla p.562 The Voisin X, Type LAR and Type LBR, was the Voisin VIII with a more reliable, lighter and more powerful Renault 12Fe engine in place of the Peugeot 8Aa used on the VIII. Deliveries were severely delayed, but some nine hundred were built before the end of the war. In 1918, a Voisin X (No. 3500) was used to create the Voisin 'Aerochir' ('Ambulance'). The aircraft was capable of flying a surgeon, together with an operating table and support equipment, including an x-ray machine and autoclave, into the battlefield. Under-wing panniers could be carry of equipment.Stamford, Lincs., U.K.: FlyPast, Key Publishing Ltd, Flying Hospital, April 2007 No. 309 p. 14 Another X was converted into a drone, and flown in 1918 and again in 1923. The Voisin XI was a development of the X powered by a Panhard 12Bc, with a slightly longer wingspan and assorted detail changes. Only about 10 were built and it did not see service.Davilla p.566 The final Voisin design, the Voisin XII, was successful in trials in 1918 for the BN2 bomber competition, but with the end of the war, no production was ordered. The Voisin XII was a large, four- engined biplane night bomber.Davilla pp.567-568 Several projects for heavy bombers for the next bomber specification (BN3/4) may have been based on the XII, but fitted with larger Salmson or Hispano-Suiza engines, but were not built.Davilla p.569 In the 1930s, a glider was built by a Louis Voisin, however he had no connection to Gabriel Voisin. ==Post World War I== After 1918, Gabriel Voisin abandoned the aviation industry in favor of automobile construction under the name Avions Voisin. ==Notes== ==References== ===Bibliography=== * Carlier, Claude, Sera Ma√Ætre du Monde, qui sera Ma√Ætre de l'Air: La Cr√©ation de l'Aviation militaire fran√ßaise.

On 30 May 2012, it was announced by World Snooker that Jogia had been suspended from playing on the tour because of unusual betting patterns on his match against Matthew Selt in the Snooker Shoot-Out, which was due to take place on 28 January 2012. A high number of bets were placed on Jogia to lose the match, which he claimed was because of an injury to his knee and the assumption that he would be unable to play to an adequate standard. Jogia withdrew from the event the day before it started, but faced a formal hearing of the World Snooker Disciplinary Committee in July. At the hearing it was revealed that Jogia had been in repeated communication with two people who placed 19 bets on the match and that 11 of these bets had been placed before he sought medical attention regarding his knee injury.

The club is a successor to Fu√üball Club Viktoria St. Ingbert established 19 August 1909. Viktoria was joined by FC Bavaria St. Ingbert in 1917. In 1937, a number of local sides were merged to form Verein f√ºr Leibes√ºbungen St. Ingbert. The club was re-established following World War II in 1945 as Sportverein St. Ingbert in what was the French-administered Saar Protectorate. Part of the membership left on 7 August 1948 to form 1. FC St. Ingbert which was renamed on 5 March 1950 to FC Viktoria 09 St. Ingbert and remains active today. __TOC__ ==History== Although still considered part of Germany, the Saar Protectorate was subject after the war to attempts to make it part of France or create a separate country there until it was re-united with Germany following a 1955 plebiscite. This was manifested in football through the establishment of a league structure separate from Germany's German Football Association (Deutsche Fussball Bund), the appearance of the region's top sides in French competition, and the formation of a national side that took part in qualification play for the 1954 FIFA World Cup. A first division football circuit known as the Ehrenliga made up of German clubs was established in the Saarland in 1948 and was active through to the end of the 1950‚Äì51 season when the state's regional football competition was re- integrated with Germany's as the Amateurliga Saarland. During this period SV rose out of the Bew√§hrungsklasse Saar, Gruppe Ost to play in the final Ehrenliga season before continuing on in the now third tier Amateurliga. Club footballer Heinz Vollmar was capped four times in 1955 and 1956 as part of Saarland's short-lived national side. In 1956, following their Amateurliga championship the previous season, St. Ingbert moved up to the 2. Oberliga S√ºdwest. They claimed a title there in 1957 and were again promoted, this time to the top-flight Oberliga S√ºdwest. Their stay in the first division was brief as they were immediately relegated. The club played second-tier football until slipping to the Amateurliga Saarland (III) in 1964 where they would compete for most of the next decade and a half. St. Ingbert took part in the opening rounds of the national amateur championship in 1965, 1967 and 1969. They fielded strong sides throughout the 1960s, but their performance fell off in the 1970s as they became a lower table club and spent two seasons in the fourth tier. The only bright spot was a 1974 Amateurliga title claimed in 1974 and another appearance in the first round of the national amateur championship. SV were relegated again in 1979, to the Verbandsliga Saarland (IV), and by 1983 had fallen all the way to the Bezirksliga Saarland (VI). The club made its only appearance in play for the DFB-Pokal (German Cup) in 1988 and went out in the opening round to Union Solingen. Over the next two decades St. Ingbert was an elevator club moving frequently up and down between divisions. By 2008, they had slipped to the Kreisliga Ostsaar (IX), Staffel H√∂cherberg where they earned a second-place result in 2006‚Äì07, before winning the league the year after and moving up to Bezirksliga (VIII) play. After a title in the Landesliga in 2013 the club moved up to the Verbandsliga, now the seventh tier, in 2013 where it plays today. ==Honours== * Bew√§hrungsklasse Saarland ** Champions: 1950 * Amateurliga Saarland (III) ** Champions: 1955, 1974 * 2.

The proponents claim that the road should have \\"Road of National Significance\\" status, as it would be useful for tourism in the area, and could reduce the time it takes to travel to Milford Sound, a major constraint on local tourism growth. However, the road plan is being criticised by conservation groups, some who consider it a \\"smokescreen\\" for more commercial exploitation of the National Park areas, linking it to plans by the National Party to allow mining on conservation land again. In early March 2010, the government announced that at the current proposed cost, and with the level of tourism benefits likely, the road was a low priority project, and the proposal would not be taken further at this stage. == Milford Dart Tunnel == A proposal for a Milford Dart Tunnel private coach road was approved in principle by the Minister for Conservation in 2012, against the advice of the relevant regional conservation boards.http://www.odt.co.nz/news/queenstown-lakes/202189/milford-dart-tunnel- impossible-mitigate-submitter There is concern that the project could impact the river and the valley's previously isolated botany and fauna, in particular that run-off from the tunnel construction site might foul the pristine Hollyford River.http://www.travelplanner.co.nz/articles/index.cfm?aid=83 The proposal has been slightly amended since its introduction http://www.tunneltalk.com/New-Zealand-Nov11-National-park-road-route-gains- momentum.php in 2011 but concern remains that making the unspoilt natural area, which attracts more adventurous sightseers and hikers, more road accessible may compromise both conservation and, in the longer term, the attractiveness of the remote area.

The screenplay by S.K. Lauren and Anita Loos was based upon a 1932 play by Rachel Crothers. The film was directed by Robert Z. Leonard, who also co-produced the film (with Orville O. Dull).

She decides the only logical thing to do is to lure him away from his wife and marry him. Mary's friend, Jimmy (Robert Taylor), however, is convinced he's the right man for her and pursues her. He sees through her rationalizations and wrong-thinking and decides to throw Mary and Woodruff's wife Claire (Greer Garson) together at the house of a friend (Spring Byington). The two women do not know each other, but during their chats Mary appreciates and respects Claire's maturity and wisdom. When Mary learns Woodruff is a philandering womanizer of long standing, she realizes she cannot love him and welcomes Jimmy's attentions. ==Cast== * Joan Crawford as Mary 'Minnie' Howard * Robert Taylor as Jimmy Lee * Greer Garson as Mrs. Claire Woodruff * Herbert Marshall as Rogers Woodruff * Spring Byington as Bridget 'Bridgie' Drake * Rafael Storm as Walter Del Canto * Mona Barrie as Mabel Guiness * Max Willenz as Pierre, Bridget's Summer House Handyman * Florence Shirley as Janet Hopper * Leslie Francis as Homer Hopper ==Reception== Howard Barnes of the New York Herald Tribune wrote, \\"Even when [Crawford] is wearing spectacles, she is not particularly convincing in the part.\\"Quirk, Lawrence J..

The Archbishop of Dublin is a senior bishop in the Church of Ireland, second only to the Archbishop of Armagh. The archbishop is the diocesan bishop of the United Dioceses of Dublin and Glendalough and the metropolitan bishop of the Province of Dublin, which covers the southern half of Ireland, and he is styled Primate of Ireland (the Archbishop of Armagh is the \\"Primate of All Ireland\\"). The archbishop's throne (cathedra) is in Christ Church Cathedral in central Dublin. The incumbent, from 11 May 2011, is Michael Jackson who signs as +Michael DUBLIN. ==History== William R. Shepherd. The Dublin area was Christian long before Dublin had a distinct diocese. The remains and memory of monasteries famous before that time, at Finglas, Glasnevin, Glendalough, Kilnamanagh, Rathmichael, Swords, Tallaght, among others, are witness to the faith of earlier generations and to a flourishing Church life in their time. Following a reverted conversion by one Norse King of Dublin, Sitric, his son Godfrey became Christian in 943 and the Kingdom of Dublin first sought to have a bishop of their own in the 11th century under Sitric MacAulaf, who had been on pilgrimage to Rome. He sent his chosen candidate, Donat (or Donagh or Donatus), to be consecrated in Canterbury in 1038 and the new prelate set up the Diocese of Dublin as a small territory within the walled city. The Bishop of Dublin answered to the Archbishop of Canterbury and did not attend councils of the Irish Church.Dublin: Catholic Truth Society, 1911: Bishop of Canea: Short Histories of Dublin Parishes, Part VIII, p. 162 Tallaght Castle was used as an official residence from the mid-15th until the early 19th century. The Archbishop was in union with Rome until the 16th century. Following the death of John Alen, Henry VIII put pressure on the Chapters of Dublin's cathedrals, who elected (January 1536) an Archbishop of his choice, George Browne. Browne was consecrated by Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury, at Lambeth. The Diocese of Kildare was united to Archdiocese of Dublin in 1846. Prior to the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland in 1871, the Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin was entitled to sit in the House of Lords as a Lord Spiritual, along with the other Archbishops in rotation. In 1976, the Diocese of Kildare was removed from union with Dublin and placed in union with Diocese of Meath. See Primate of Ireland for a discussion of the roles and status of the Archbishops of Dublin and Armagh and their functions as Primates. ==Cathedrals== Since the Middle Ages, the seat of the Archbishop of Dublin has been Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin, although for many centuries, it shared this status with St. Patrick's Cathedral.

The colliery suffered a significant accident on 21 December 1852 when a firedamp explosion killed 10 miners and injured 12. The inquiry found that the explosion had been caused by reckless behaviour of the colliers; a ventilation door had been propped open which resulted in firedamp accumulating and some colliers using unguarded safety lamps.

The teleplay is adapted from the 1983 novel of the same name by Susan Hill. It focuses on a young solicitor who is sent to a coastal English village to settle the estate of a reclusive widow, and finds the town haunted. The programme was produced by Central Independent Television for the ITV Network, and premiered on Christmas Eve 1989 and was an unexpected success, though author Susan Hill reportedly disagreed with some of the slight changes Kneale made in the adaptation. Another film version was released in 2012, starring Daniel Radcliffe in the lead role. ==Plot== In 1925, London solicitor Arthur Kidd travels to the coastal market town of Crythin Gifford in North East England to attend the funeral and settle the estate of Alice Drablow, a reclusive widow. Upon his arrival Kidd meets Sam Toovey, a local land owner who is unsettled to hear of the Drablows. Kidd finds the townspeople reluctant to talk about Drablow's home, Eel Marsh House. Kidd attends the funeral with local solicitor Pepperell. He notices a woman in black in the church, then again amid the gravestones. He mentions the woman to Pepperell. Elsewhere, a truck drops lumber and cripples a Romani child. Kidd goes to Eel Marsh House over a tidal causeway. Driver Keckwick knows the timing of the tides. Kidd sees the woman again in the graveyard. Terrified, he flees into the house. While looking around the study, he finds two death certificates as well as pictures of a young woman who resembles the Woman in Black. After hearing some disturbing recordings made by Mrs. Drablow on wax cylinders, he heads back to town. In town, Toovey tells him not to go back to the house, but Kidd insists on returning. Toovey loans Kidd his dog Spider. Upon his return, Kidd hears a bouncing ball from upstairs. Spider starts whining and leads Kidd to a door that cannot be opened. Kidd gets an axe to break the door, returning to find the door has opened by itself. Kidd sees an immaculately clean child's nursery. Kidd notices that a lead soldier is somehow in his hand. He realizes that the generator is running down. Unwilling to be left in the dark, Kidd rushes outside toward the generator. Outside, Spider answers a high whistle and runs away. The noise of the horse and child start again. Kidd, frightened almost into madness, rushes locks himself into the house. He records his fears onto the wax cylinders. From various sources inside the study, Kidd learns that Mrs. Drablow's sister, Jennet Goss, gave birth to a child but was unable to care for it. The Drablows adopted the boy, insisting he should never know that Jennet was his mother. One day, Jennet kidnapped her son and tried to escape via the causeway. The pony and trap became lost and sank into the marshes, killing all aboard. Toovey arrives at Eel Marsh House, brought by Spider, and listens to Kidd's theories. Toovey says that seeing the Woman in Black presages the death of a child. Kidd packs to leave. However, amongst the papers, he finds the lead soldier. He points this out to Toovey, and they go up to the nursery. However, when they reach it, the room is a mess, with all the toys smashed and the furniture in shambles. Kidd collapses. Kidd awakens in the town inn to the sound of the child's laughter and finds the soldier yet again in his hand. After asking out loud what the child wants of him, the child replies that the soldier \\"is for you\\". The Woman in Black appears, hovering over his bed, and shrieks into his face, terrifying him into unconsciousness. Kidd returns to London and his family. His boss instructs him to look through the box of papers from Crythin Gifford. At that moment, his two assistants come in and say that there was a customer for him, a woman dressed completely in black. Delirious with terror, Kidd searches madly through the box for the toy soldier. When he does not find it, he burns all the papers and the box, and half his office as well. His boss fires him and the Kidd family leaves London. Later, Arthur and his family are boating on a peaceful lake when Arthur sees the Woman in Black. Petrified, he does nothing. A tree falls on their boat, drowning and killing them all. ==Cast== ==Production== The programme was filmed at Stanlake Park in Berkshire, using the causeway to Osea Island, near Goldhanger in Essex, and the local salt marshes, whilst scenes to represent Crythin Gifford were filmed at the National Trust village of Lacock, near Chippenham, Wiltshire. The external funeral scene was filmed in Sarratt, Hertfordshire. == Release == ===Broadcast history=== The film was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on ITV on Christmas Eve 1989, with the only repeat airing taking place on Channel 4 at Christmas 1994. Overall the TV adaptation stayed reasonably faithful to the original novel, although some of the changes angered the author Susan Hill (for example, the sex of the dog 'Spider' was changed from female to male). Arthur's name has also been changed from Kipps to Kidd. ===Home media=== The TV version was released in the United Kingdom on VHS exclusive to WHSmith stores, but only for a fairly short time. There was also a Region 1 DVD release by BFS Entertainment, released on 8 August 2000, but it is now out of print and, according to the messageboard at the site of Susan Hill, the television rights are now owned by someone else. The rights have been purchased twice and currently reside with a U.S. studio. In the United Kingdom, Network Distribution has re-released the film on both Blu-Ray and DVD. The film for this release has been restored and remastered in high- definition from the original film elements and features extras including a booklet, full screen and widescreen presentations and audio commentary by authors Mark Gatiss, Andy Nyman and Kim Newman. ==Critical reception== In his book Creature Features: The Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror Movie Guide (2000), John Stanley wrote that the film was a \\"chilly British ghost story in the best literary traditions of H.

The company has also owned Sheaffer, another pen manufacturer, since 2014.Company history on Sheaffer.com == History == The company was founded in 1846 in Providence, Rhode Island. It initially manufactured gold and silver casings for pencils, reflecting the Cross family's history as jewelers. The company was founded by Richard Cross, who passed it on to his son, Alonzo T. Cross. The company developed many innovative new writing instruments, including forerunners of the modern mechanical pencils, and the earliest stylographic pens. In the 1960s, the company moved its headquarters to a large facility (about 155,000 square feet) in Lincoln, Rhode Island. After trading on the NASDAQ for five years (under the now-defunct symbol ATX), the company was sold in 2013 to Clarion Capital Partners, LLC, but it retained its headquarters in Lincoln, Rhode Island. The Sheaffer pen company was acquired by A.T. Cross in 2014. In May 2016, with its headquarters in Lincoln becoming too large, the company accepted a set of tax credits and incentives in exchange for moving its headquarters to Providence, Rhode Island. The new headquarters, measuring about 4200 square feet, is located at The Foundry, the former Brown and Sharpe Manufacturing Company Complex at 299 Promenade Street in Providence. Most employees were moved to the new location by October 2016. On November 16, 2017, Transom Capital Group, LLC announced that it had bought the assets of A.T. Cross Company. == Presidential pens == Cross has been an official supplier of pens to the White House since at least the 1970s. The pens used to sign legislation are often given out as souvenirs to those who attend the bill signings. While an official Cross‚ÄìWhite House program was begun under president Bill Clinton, it is known that the tradition goes back to at least the administration of Gerald Ford. All presidents from Ronald Reagan to Donald Trump signed legislation using Cross pens; it is unknown if earlier presidents did so. Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Clinton favored the Cross Townsend model; Obama later switched to the Century II model in black lacquer, with black medium point refill. The Trump administration placed an initial order for 150 Cross Century II pens in January 2017. Sometime before November 2018, Trump broke with tradition and ceased using the Cross pen, saying \\"it was a horrible pen, and it was extremely expensive\\". Since, he has signed documents using a customized Sharpie marker manufactured by Newell Brands.https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-uses-personalized-sharpie- pen-2018-11 Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo signs state laws using Cross pens. == Products == Cross is well known for its writing instrument lines, beginning with mechanical pencils, and it produced the first stylographic (a technological forerunner of the modern ball point pen) pens in 1879. The current product line includes fountain pens, ballpoint pens, gel pens, and mechanical pencils. The first Cross fountain pens were likely produced in 1930, but not again until the 1980s. Cross writing instruments are generally sold in the mid-range of the market, rather than the extreme luxury end. However, they became a \\"must-have\\" accessory for the rising professional during the 1970s and 1980s. Most Cross writing instruments are now made in China, although some of the work for customized pens for presidents and politicians is done in New England. The company also manufactures a range of wristwatches, cufflinks, desk accessories and leather goods such as pen cases, portfolios, and other items often targeted at the gift market. In late 1997, Cross and IBM teamed up to introduce a digital writing pad, called the CrossPad, which was discontinued in 2004. == References == ==External links== * Category:Fountain pen and ink manufacturers Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1846 Category:Manufacturing companies based in Providence, Rhode Island Category:1846 establishments in Rhode Island Category:Office supply companies of the United States ","title":"A.

It was part of United Technologies Corporation; it was purchased by ClearEdge Power in February 2013. The company specialized in fuel cells for buildings, buses and automobiles. It has also developed fuel cells for space and submarine applications in the past. == History == UTC Power began as a division of Pratt & Whitney in 1958. In 1966, the company supplied fuel cells to NASA for the Apollo project space missions, to supply electric power and drinking water for the astronauts on board and, later, for the Space Shuttle missions until 2010. In 1985, the company became a wholly owned subsidiary of UTC under the name International Fuel Cells. It was later renamed UTC Fuel Cells, and became UTC Power in 2001. In the early 1990s, UTC Power commercialized a large, stationary fuel cell for use as a cogeneration power plant. The company has expanded into the broader fuel cell industry over the last 10 years, developing fuel cells for automobiles and buses. In February 2013, UTC Power was sold to ClearEdge Power. == Fuel cells for buildings == UTC Power‚Äôs stationary phosphoric acid fuel cell product is the PureCell Model 400 System. This stationary fuel cell system provides 400 kilowatts of electricity and 1.7 million Btu/hour of heat. The PureCell System is considered a good match for combined heat and power applications including supermarkets, hospitals, hotels and educational institutions. The UTC Power fuel cell system uses natural gas which is converted in a \\"catalytic reformer\\" into hydrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and water. The hydrogen is used to run the four fuel cell stacks to produce electricity and the power plant then converts the exhaust heat into cooling and heating, turning potential waste into usable energy.

The company worked with BMW, Hyundai and Nissan as well as the U.S. Department of Energy on development and demonstration programs. == Energy Security == The UTC Power Control Center monitored the global fleet of PureCell systems 24/7 and often detected potential problems before they could impact successful operation of the system, ensuring maximum uptime for customers. Each PureCell included an internet-based communication system, called the Remote Monitoring System (RMS). The RMS provided the Control Center with remote access to fuel cell operating data and allowed limited control, including start-up, power output kW set point and shut-down commands. The fuel cell could independently ‚Äúcall out‚Äù to alert technicians of out-of-limit parameters, status, and need for maintenance. The RMS also supplied the system owner with website access to view the fuel cell‚Äôs operating status. == References == == External links == * ClearCell Power Official Site Category:United Technologies Category:Companies based in Hartford County, Connecticut Category:Fuel cell manufacturers Category:South Windsor, Connecticut ","title":"UTC Power"},{"id":"11647001","text":"√Åvalos is a Spanish surname.

In the , Blackbutt had a population of 836 people. ==Geography== The town is located on the D'Aguilar Highway, in the South Burnett local government area, north-west of the state capital, Brisbane. Blackbutt lies within the Cooyar Creek catchment, tributary of the Brisbane River, which rises in the Bunya Mountains to the west. ==History== European settlement in the Blackbutt area began in 1842, when the Scott family established Taromeo Station. In 1887, the Scott family ceded land to found both Blackbutt and its neighbouring town of Benarkin. Farms were established in the area and the discovery of gold in the area in the late 19th century led to population growth in the town. The timber industry played an important role in the development of the town. The town is named after Eucalyptus pilularis, commonly known as blackbutt, a common tree of the family Myrtaceae native to south-eastern Australia which is one of Australia's most important hardwoods. Blackbutt, Benarkin and the nearby town of Yarraman are often collectively referred to as the \\"Timber Towns\\" and the terms \\"Timbertown\\" and \\"Timbertowners\\" feature in the name of many local businesses and a sporting teams. Blackbutt Provisional School opened on 20 January 1896 under teacher Rosa Bella Ryan. On 1 January 1909 it became Blackbutt State School. In January 1914, the school relocated to a larger site. Blackbutt Post Office opened by November 1906 (a receiving office had been open from 1896). Blackbutt Police Station, 1912. Note the station badge attached to the peak of the right hand tent. When the Blackbutt railway station was built to serve the town, it was some distance from the town, so in 1910 it was decided to name the station Benarkin instead. This in turn gave its name to the new town that formed near the railway station Benarkin. Because of the close proximity ( apart) and intertwined history of the two towns, they are often referred to as the twin towns of Blackbutt-Benarkin. Blackbutt was connected to the Brisbane Valley railway line in 1911. However, the line was closed in the 1980s and was converted into a rail trail. left The Blackbutt War Memorial was unveiled on 24 April 1920 by J.A. Lee, the chairman of Nanango Shire. The Blackbutt Library was opened in 1996. Tennis great Roy Emerson was born on a farm near Blackbutt and attended Nukku State School for his early education. The former school building now houses the Roy Emerson Museum in Blackbutt. In the , Blackbutt had a population of 1,055 people. In the , Blackbutt had a population of 836 people. ==Transport== Blackbutt is the site of the Queensland Government's first trial of using fibre composite in bridge building when it was used in the replacement of Taromeo Creek bridge in 2005. Fibre composite materials are much stronger than steel and concrete but also much lighter and do not rust. ==Education== Blackbutt State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at Crofton Street (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 165 students with 12 teachers (11 full- time equivalent) and 18 non-teaching staff (9 full-time equivalent). There is no secondary school in Blackbutt. The nearest are in Yarraman (P-9), Nanango and Kingaroy. == Amenities == The South Burnett Regional Council operates a public library in Blackbutt at 69 Hart Street. The Blackbutt Yarraman branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association meets at the QCWA Hall at 65 Coulson Street. ==Infrastructure== Town water supply is provided by Boobir Dam. == Attractions == The Brisbane Valley Rail Trail passes through Blackbutt, following the route of the former railway line. It is for walking cycling and horse riding; no motorised vehicles are permitted. ==Events== The Blackbutt Avocado Festival has been held annually in September since 2016, replacing the former Bloomin Beautiful Blackbutt Festival. It features avocado cooking demonstrations, avocado tossing competitions, presentations on farming avocados, in addition to other festival events, such as arts and craft displays, woodchop competitions and live music. == References == ==Further reading== * == External links == * * *Blackbutt online ‚Äì Community site *Blackbutt-Benarkin cemetery Category:Towns in Queensland Category:South Burnett Region Category:Populated places established in 1887 Category:1887 establishments in Australia Category:Localities in Queensland ","title":"Blackbutt, Queensland"},{"id":"11647024","text":"The STELLA project was originally supported and co-funded by the European Commission. The aim was to develop a new language learning methodology for online language learning suitable for European learners.

The project's methodology has been implemented with Arabic,Arabic language learning methodology - ArabicOnline Danish, Hungarian, Spanish, TurkishTurkish language learning methodology - HandsOnTurkish and English. == Background == Article 149 of the EU Treaty states that the role of the EU is to ‚Äúcontribute to the development of quality education by encouraging cooperation between Member States and, if necessary, by supporting and supplementing their action.‚ÄùEUROPA - Education and Training - EUROPA - Education and training: introduction == Overarching EU policy goal == According to the Lisbon Strategy (March 2000), the overarching EU policy goal is that ‚ÄúThe Union must become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world.‚ÄùEUROPA - Education and Training - INNERPAGE - Education In the 2005 relaunch, the goal was stated as follows: The EU is to become ‚Äúan advanced knowledge society with sustainable development, more and better jobs and greater social cohesion.‚Äù The EU works towards these policy goals on the one hand through policy work with Member States and on the other through subsidizing educational programmes. The key challenge for the EU is to achieve multilingualism. As Umberto Eco (1993) stated, ‚Äúwe must place our hope in a polyglot Europe‚Äù.Eco - Writings: \\"Polyglot Federation\\" Multilingualism is a core value in Europe: it is one of its unique qualities and contributes to its richness. However, learning a lingua franca such as English is not enough. Every European citizen should speak their mother tongue and at least two other European languages.Action plan on language learning and linguistic diversity == The European Union's language objectives == To achieve the aim the EU‚Äôs policy objectives are to promote language learning and linguistic diversity within Europe and to complement EU programmes by addressing language teaching and learning needs at every stage of a person‚Äôs life. These objectives and needs will be met by: * developing materials for teaching less widely spoken and taught languages, * building up competence in languages which in turn can reinforce European global competitiveness * developing methods to motivate language learners * promoting multilingual comprehension between languages. == The programmes == The EU initiative that funded transnational educational programmes was the Socrates programme. This was replaced in 2007 by the Lifelong Learning Programme 2007-2013. Within the Socrates programme the Lingua Action supported projects that promoted language learning while the Minerva Action promoted innovation in the fields of ICT and education. == STELLA == === Methodology === Underlying the whole project is the STELLA methodology, which implements the ideas and objectives laid down in the Common European Framework of Reference for Modern Languages. The methodology is oriented towards the European Language Certificates, levels A1/A2. Supporting documents include a graded and sequenced distribution of topics, themes, language functions, lexis and syntax which authors can use as a basis to generate online language learning material. The generic system constitutes the electronic implementation of the STELLA methodology. The core material in STELLA is a language learning course (written in English), which serves as a model for authors to write courses for other languages. === STELLA courses === The STELLA courses are suitable for: * learners who want to work towards a recognized European Language Certificate, * learners who want to visit a country and want to learn the basics of the language, * learners who wish to study online, * learners who cannot take part in classroom activities because they live in a remote area or because of a disability, * language schools and colleges which want to integrate an online e-course to support their classroom teaching.

She served as co-principal of the Livingston Female Academy, and then the first (and only) woman president of Livingston Normal College (now the University of West Alabama). She was inducted into the Alabama Women's Hall of Fame in 1971. ==Early life and education== Julia Tutwiler was born in Tuscaloosa, Alabama to Julia (Ashe) Tutwiler and educator Henry Tutwiler on August 15, 1841. Henry had been one of the first professors at the University of Alabama in the early 1830s, but at the time of his daughter's birth he was teaching at La Grange College in Colbert County, Alabama (now the University of North Alabama). Julia was born in Tuscaloosa, because her mother was visiting family there. She grew up in the nearby community of Havana, Alabama where her father established Greene Springs School, a college-preparatory school, when she was almost six. Henry Tutwiler was an early advocate of education for girls and so his daughters and some neighboring girls attended classes with boys at Greene Springs School. Julia then went on to study at a boarding school in Philadelphia for two years before the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861 necessitated she return to Alabama. (Henry Tutwiler's progressive views did not extend to enslaved persons and at the start of the War he was reported to own more than 40 slaves.) Julia Tutwiler began attending Vassar College, in January 1866, during its inaugural year, but did not return in the fall. She furthered her education in Germany, France and at Washington and Lee University. ==Career== After her semester at Vassar, Tutwiler accepted a faculty position at Greensboro Female Academy, Greensboro, Alabama, in the autumn of 1866. The following year, she was chosen to be the Academy's principala position she held for two years. Tutwiler served with her uncle as co-president of Livingston State Normal School. She was the first (and only) female president of the college. After decades of expansion, it became the University of West Alabama. With her support, in 1892 ten Livingston-educated students became the first women admitted to the University of Alabama. She was called the \\"mother of co-education in Alabama\\". She was a key figure in the creation of the Alabama Girls' Industrial School, in October 1896. This institution eventually evolved into the University of Montevallo. ==Prison reform== Known as the \\"angel of the prisons,\\" Tutwiler pushed for many reforms of the Alabama penal system. Most significantly, she fought to separate female prisoners from male ones and to separate juveniles from hardened adult criminals‚Äîresulting in the first Boys' Industrial School. In addition, she demanded better prison sanitation and helped institute educational and religious opportunities for prisoners. As a consequence of her advocacy, the Julia Tutwiler Prison for Women in Wetumpka, Alabama was named in her honor.\\"Tutwiler Prison for Women.\\" Alabama Department of Corrections.

This was a 14% rise on the price at closing on the London Stock Exchange the day before. Chairman Freddy Shepherd, who was in hospital at the time of the bid suffering from a punctured lung, said that he planned to fight the takeover and not allow Mike Ashley to get his hands on his 29.8%. Under the terms of UK takeover law, having purchased more than 30% of a listed company, he was obliged to make an offer to buy the remaining shares at the same or a greater price. ; 31 May On 31 May it was reported that the Newcastle board were considering Ashley's offer. It is widely believed that Mike Ashley then owned around a 54% stake in the club meaning that Freddy Shepherd's 29.8% was then useless and he could have been removed from his position as chairman by the new majority shareholders. ; 7 June On the 7 June 2007 Freddy Shepherd and Shepherd Offshore Services Ltd. agreed to sell their stake in Newcastle United and released a statement urging other shareholders to do the same. It was announced that Shepherd would remain in the role of chairman. ; 15 June Confirmation came on the 15 June that Mike Ashley and St. James' Holdings had acquired slightly over 77% of the club. This means that Mike Ashley could delist the company from the stock exchange, with the date of 18 July being mentioned in the release. ; 26 June On 26 June 2007, Ashley gained the 90% of shares needed to compulsorily acquire the final 10% of shares. On the same day, directors Bruce Shepherd, Allison Antonopoulos, Tim Revill and Douglas Hall formally resigned from the board and both Chris Mort and Steve Hayward were appointed. ; 18 July On 18 July 2007, the shares of Newcastle United PLC were delisted from the London Stock Exchange. == 2008 ‚Äì Possible sale == In September 2008 the club manager Kevin Keegan (who had been appointed in January) left the club. The European style of management introduced by the Ashley regime was cited as the reason for his departure. The fans of the club began to protest outside St James' Park and the players' performance suffered. This pressure led to Mike Ashley releasing a statement and putting the club up for sale. The London-based investment bank Seymour Pierce was appointed to handle the sale of the club. On 28 December the sale was called off. == 2009/10 ‚Äì Relegation and Promotion == After Newcastle United were relegated from the Premier League to the Championship on 24 May 2009, it is likely that the club will be sold. According to media reports on 31 May 2009, Ashley is attempting to sell the club again. The lowered asking price due to the relegation was ¬£100 million. On 27 October the sale was again called off. At the same time Ashley decided to sell the naming rights to St. James' Park - namesake of the holding company. This again angered fans.

Key risk indicators are metrics used by organizations to provide an early signal of increasing risk exposures in various areas of the enterprise. It differs from a key performance indicator (KPI) in that the latter is meant as a measure of how well something is being done while the former is an indicator of the possibility of future adverse impact. KRI give an early warning to identify potential event that may harm continuity of the activity/project. KRIs are a mainstay of operational risk analysis. == Definitions == According to OECD OECD Glossary of statistical terms :A risk indicator is an indicator that estimates the potential for some form of resource degradation using mathematical formulas or models. == Risk management == === Security risk management === According to Risk IT framework by ISACA,ISACA THE RISK IT FRAMEWORK (registration required) key risk indicators are metrics capable of showing that the organization is subject or has a high probability of being subject to a risk that exceed the defined risk appetite. Organizations have different sizes and environment. So every enterprise should choose its own KRI, taking into account the following steps: * Consider the different stakeholders of the organization * Make a balanced selection of risk indicators, covering performance indicators, lead indicators and trends * Ensure that the selected indicators drill down to the root cause of the events * Choose high relevant and high probability of predicting important risks: ** High business impact ** Easy to measure ** With high correlation with the risk ** Sensitivity * Determine thresholds and triggers for the set of KRI's * Locate and fold in data sources that contribute or feed data into KRI triggers * Determine notification methods, recipients, and action or response sequences The constant measure of KRI can bring the following benefits to the organization: * Provide an early warning: a proactive action can take place * Provide a backward looking view on risk events, so lesson can be learned by the past * Provide an indication that the risk appetite and tolerance are reached * Provide real time actionable intelligence to decision makers and risk managers Advances in hosted cloud data storage, data federation, and data aggregation have enabled data supply chains for real time calculation of key risk indicators across heretofore unlinked or disconnected data sources. Risk level dashboards can be supplemented with real time push notifications of risk. Systems methods and tools addressing triggering of notifications when targets are attained for key risk indicators have been evolving. Calculating and enabling notifications of key risk indicators used to be a unique benefit of enterprise software packages. With the evolution of API's to calculate trigger values for key risk indicators across various data sources, the potential for risk managers to include data external to an enterprise or external to an enterprise database has changed the risk management landscape. ==Qualities of good key risk indicators== Some qualities of a good key risk indicator include: * Ability to measure the right thing (e.g., supports the decisions that need to be made) * Quantifiable (e.g., damages in dollars of profit loss) * Capability to be measured precisely and accurately * Ability to be validated against ground truth, and confidence level one has in the assertions made within the framework of the metric == See also == * Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission * Enterprise risk management * ISO 31000 == References == Category:Metrics Category:Operational risk ","title":"Key risk indicator"},{"id":"11647132","text":"Golam Mortaza (born 23 May 1980) is a Bangladeshi former first-class and List A cricketer from Rajshahi.

CFBT declares its mission to provide professional services and management to the visually impaired, improving their quality of life and helping them to live in harmony with themselves and other people.UNESCAP United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the PacificStandard Chartered Bank ==Vision== *Blind persons living normally and equally with other people in the society ==Philosophy== *Lives start with chance ==Missions== *Nurture of blind people in living skills, education and vocation to their potential, maintaining transparent governance and management that are acceptable globally, promoting accessibility and conserving good culture ==Objectives== *Promotion of education, job training, job placement and research for visually impaired persons *Provision of inclusive education and non-formal education in all levels of education for visually impaired persons *Promotion of moral improvement in visually impaired persons *Promotion of visually impaired students to attend public schools and colleges at all levels of education *Production, provision and services of materials and equipment for education, occupation and independent living of visually impaired persons *Joining hands with other agencies which have similar objectives for public welfare *Not participating in any campaign activity for or against political candidates ==History== *1978 - Following a hard-earned chance to college education, Prayat Punong-ong, 29, a blind man with bachelor's degree of Education in English Major, returned to his hometown in Khon Kaen with great passion to help other blind children get their chance to education so that they could live independently. The idea that blind people can be educated for independent living was not a common belief in Thai society at that time. Most blind people were found begging in public places or left stranded at home to eat, breathe and do nothing until they die. Those pictures were planted in Prayat's mind before he became totally blind at the age of 8 by a road accident, and that inspired him to make a difference. Prayat and his wife, Bantom (later changed to Thidarat), started their mission by renting half of a house in Soi Tarn Thip, Khon Kaen and established the Christian Home for Education of the Blind to train blind students basic living, traveling, reading-writing and all required skills to be ready for normal education systems. At the start on 2 December, 13 blind students were provided free accommodation, food and training funded with all the money the couple had plus initial donation of 10,082 THB from Mrs. Rose Lim, a Singaporean, and 12 beds donated by World Vision Foundation of Thailand. Prayat took care of living skill and academic skill training for the blind while Bantom shared duty as guide, housemate, administrator and teacher of moral and music. They earned a little food and money by singing and begging for help from donors in the community. *1979 - The board of directors was formed. inclusive education started for the first time with 3 students attending Khon Kaen Christian School and Sanam Bin School, private and governmental schools respectively. To provide effective education, teachers, parents, caretaker of student and community were trained to support the students properly. Bantome was the first teacher for inclusive education for the blind at Sanam Bin School. *1980 - The success had become better recognized publicly, bringing passionate supports from Thailand and overseas. Mr. Burin Burittrakul, a wealthy businessman in Khon Kaen, donated a land sized 8.5 Rai (136 hectares) for building Khon Kaen School for the Blind, and Evangelical Church of Bangkok donated cash to buy additional 3.5 Rai (56 hectares) area totaling 12 Rai (192 hectares). The construction began with help from Faculty of Engineering, Khon Kaen University and donations from Canadian government and Christoffel Blinden Mission, Germany. *1981 - The first school building finished in August, and the fellows moved in from the old rented house. *1983 - The Christian Foundation for the Blind in Thailand; CFBT was recognized by Office of the National Culture Commission; ONCC on 23 September and registered by Khon Kaen‚Äôs official on 29 November. *1984 - The foundation was gracefully granted the royal patronage of His Majesty the King on 3 June bringing much greater support and recognition countrywide that resulted in expanding the service for the blind to many branch offices throughout Thailand. *1985 - Despite resistance from the management board, Prayat with his wife and some school staffs led 40 blind students in a 450 km walkathon from Khon Kaen to Bangkok as a symbolic movement to get attention from the government and public about the right to development and education for the blind. They set off on 24 October and arrived at Chatuchak Park, Bangkok on 3 November receiving great attention from domestic media and raised a few million Baht to start the service in Bangkok. Prayat used that money to by an abandoned house in Bangkhen District with a brave plan to start a nursing home for blind children with multiple disabilities. Although his action was criticized as a waste of effort by some board members, Prayat insisted and commented, \\"State-run shelters for these disabled children do not have enough resources, both in terms of budget and staff, to allow them to develop properly. They need the private sector to help relieve the heavy burden.\\" *1986 - The nursing home for blind children with multiple disabilities started service and later became known as Home for the Blind with Multiple Disabilities providing free accommodation and food for blind children with dedicated caretakers and rehabilitation staff. The work on blind children with multiple disabilities astoundingly attracted visitors and donors in Bangkok and other provinces contributing to majority portion of donation for the whole CFBT until now. *1988 - CFBT was recognized as a public welfare organization number 174 by Ministry of Finance. Money donations became tax deductible. *1989 - Started operation of Nakhon Ratchasima School for the Blind and Education Service Center for the Blind. H.R.H.

A small right-winger, he was described in contemporary reports as \\"...a veritable artful dodger with rare speed and command of the ball.\\" ==Career== ===Club=== Born in Rutherglen, Bennett began his career at his local club Rutherglen Glencairn in 1901, at which time future Celtic colleague Jimmy McMenemy was also with the outfit. In 1902 Bennett was selected for the Scotland Junior team for matches along with another man who would soon be a teammate at Celtic, Davie Hamilton,Scottish League Forum ‚Äì Junior International Lineups 1902 scoring four goals in as many Junior internationals overall.

In the latter two years of this streak Bennett also collected Scottish Cup winner's medals. He initially played as centre- forward for Celtic, but shifted positions to accommodate Jimmy Quinn which proved beneficial to both players. In May 1908, Bennett abruptly left Celtic (winners of every trophy on offer that season) to join rivals Rangers, who met a small contract release fee ‚Äì ¬£50, equivalent to under ¬£5000 in the 2010s ‚Äì to allow him to move as a free agent, making him one of very few players to have moved directly from one club to the other. He had scored the winning goal in an Old Firm league meeting between the sides just two weeks earlier to clinch the title for Celtic. He won a further three consecutive League Championships while at Ibrox (1911 to 1913) and remained with the club until 1918, also serving in the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) during World War I. He played in a combined total of 351 league and cup matches for Celtic and Rangers, scoring 116 goals. After leaving Rangers, Bennett played on until his fortieth birthday, with firstly a loan to Ayr United,[A Record of pre-war Scottish League Players], John Litster / Scottish Football Historian magazine, October 2012 then a permanent transfer to Dumbarton then Albion Rovers. He was later manager of Third Lanark (three seasons)Third Lanark manager Alex Bennett, FitbaStats and Clydebank (two seasons), and also worked as a sports journalist. He died in Glasgow in 1940. ===International=== Bennett was capped eleven times for Scotland, gaining three caps while at Celtic and the remaining eight while at Rangers. He made his Scotland debut against Wales in March 1904 and scored his first international goal, again against Wales, four years later. He scored his second international goal in his final Scotland appearance, against Ireland in March 1913. He also appeared ten times in representative matches for the Scottish Football League. At the age of 39 he also took part in a 1921 summer tour of North America as a member of 'Third Lanark Scotland XI' (organised by Third Lanark and composed of players from seven different clubs), reuniting with old teammate and rival Jimmy McMenemy; Bennett thereafter became the Thirds manager. ==Personal life== Bennett's younger brother James was also a footballer who played for Queen's Park prior to being wounded on military service in World War I. Their father Robert was a master draper and amateur poet of some local esteem whose portrait is on display in a Hamilton museum. Alec was clearly proud to be associated with his family business: when he married in 1910 he listed that he was a 'Drapery warehouseman' by profession rather than an international footballer. His grandson Sandy Carmichael (full name Alexander Bennett Carmichael) played international Rugby union for Scotland and the British and Irish Lions in the 1970s. ==Honours== ;Rutherglen Glencairn *Scottish Junior Cup: 1901‚Äì02 *Glasgow Junior League: 1901‚Äì02Scottish Football Historical Archive ‚Äì History of Glasgow Junior League ;Celtic *Scottish League: 1904‚Äì05, 1905‚Äì06, 1906‚Äì07, 1907‚Äì08 *Scottish Cup: 1906‚Äì07, 1907‚Äì08 *Glasgow Cup: 1904‚Äì05, 1905‚Äì06, 1907‚Äì08 ;Rangers *Scottish League: 1910‚Äì11, 1911‚Äì12, 1912‚Äì13 *Scottish Cup: Finalist 1908‚Äì09 *Glasgow Cup: 1910‚Äì11, 1911‚Äì12, 1912‚Äì13, 1913‚Äì14 ===Notes=== ==See also== *Played for Celtic and Rangers == References == == External links == * Category:1881 births Category:1940 deaths Category:Scottish footballers Category:Sportspeople from Rutherglen Category:People educated at Stonelaw High School Category:Rutherglen Glencairn F.C. players Category:Scotland junior international footballers Category:Scottish Junior Football Association players Category:Celtic F.C. players Category:Rangers F.C. players Category:Scottish Football League players Category:Scotland international footballers Category:Scottish Football League representative players Category:Dumbarton F.C. players Category:Ayr United F.C. players Category:Albion Rovers F.C. players Category:Scottish football managers Category:Clydebank F.C.

The shows had commercial ties with the Billabong surf brand. Included in the lineup was Surf Shorts, a show featuring participants in the Jack McCoy Surf Film Festival, and Girls Get Out There, an edutainment program on female surfers. ==Defunct== ===MTV Most Wanted=== This was MTV Australia's flagship request show, started in 1996 and adopted from the formula used on MTV Asia. In subsequent years the show also used the same visuals as the Asian version. It was originally hosted by Yvette Duncan, the only VJ on the station at the time. Most Wanted ran weekdays for around two hours each day and was hosted from either a studio set or live location such as music stores. The show was replaced with TRL Australia in 2005. ===TRL Australia=== Shortly after the UK and Ireland version of MTV developed its own version of the American TRL, plans began for an Australian TRL. At first the show was weekly, broadcasting live on Fridays and running alongside MTV Most Wanted. TRL Australia uses the same logo as TRL UK. Shows were produced on a large cruise yacht, dubbed the \\"MTV Cruiser\\", which floated around Sydney Harbour, containing the audience, performing bands and VJs. Australian band Killing Heidi were the first to perform on the show. Later TRL Australia became a daily show, with the Monday - Thursday slots being broadcast from a small boxed set at Global Television Studios in Sydney. Shows from the MTV Cruiser are produced on Fridays and are titled TRL Weekend. Both the weekly and weekend editions of TRL Australia feature prominent local and overseas celebrities, often during tours of Australia. They closely follow the formula of the original TRL. During 2006 production on TRL Australia ceased without any announcement and as of May 2007 has not recommenced. It was replaced on-air with Full Tank and The Lair. ===Quality Time=== Shown in 2005, featuring local VJs spending time with a musical celebrity. The show uses a \\"day in the life of\\" format, including candid interviews and footage. Most of the shows feature the VJ in the United States. ====Full Tank==== The Full Tank crew hits the roads of Australia in search of the exciting, the kinky, the glamorous and the downright weird. They are discovering all the festivals, concerts, events, comps and parties that makes Australia unique. ====MTV Mobbed==== Be prepared to get Mobbed on air, online and on mobile with the hottest downloads downunder! ====Other shows==== Some shows are collaborated by MTV Australia, such as The Rock Chart and Scrambled Megs. These shows are not hosted by MTV VJs. Occasionally MTV Australia produces special shows such as VJ Hunts and summer surf specials. In the past MTV Australia has also been involved in novel original programming such as Digital Lili, a live phone-in show featuring a computer generated host. The show aired in Australia and Asia. ==References== Mtv Australia * ","title":"List of programs broadcast by MTV Australia"},{"id":"11647185","text":"Unleashed is the fourth album of militant Black nationalist rapper Paris.

Construction of the house began in 1685, by the architect Sir William Bruce as his own home. It is regarded as one of his finest works, and was called by Daniel Defoe \\"the most beautiful and regular piece of architecture in Scotland\\".Defoe's A tour thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain (1724), as cited in Fenwick, p.81 The house, which is undoubtedly the most important early classical mansion in Scotland, retains most of its original internal decoration. It was occupied for 200 years as the home of the Montgomery family, who purchased the property in the late 18th century. Kinross House is a Category A listed building, and its grounds are listed in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland. The grounds cover 100 acres of formal gardens and woodland, also including Castle Island on Loch Leven. Lochleven Castle is amongst the most important medieval castles in Scotland, and is renowned as the castle where Mary Queen of Scots debated the future of the Scottish Reformation with Presbyterian theologian John Knox and where she was later imprisoned in 1567. It is also where she abdicated the Scottish throne in favour of her infant son James VI (later to become King James I of England). The Royal Stewart history associated with Lochleven Castle was clearly appreciated by Sir William Bruce, architect of Kinross House, who made the Castle his focal point for the entire design of Kinross House and gardens, the first designed landscape in Scottish architectural history. In 2010, the house and grounds were sold to Donald Fothergill, a Yorkshire businessman, who thoroughly refurbished the house. Kinross House and its grounds are now offered for hire for gatherings such as parties, weddings and meetings. The House and Coach House have a number of reception rooms and 24 bedrooms located between the House and the adjacent Coach House: the main house has 14 bedrooms and the Coach House has a further 10 bedrooms.

John (Jean) Iliopoulos (Greek: ŒôœâŒ¨ŒΩŒΩŒ∑œÇ ŒóŒªŒπœåœÄŒøœÖŒªŒøœÇ; 1940, Kalamata, Greece) is a Greek physicist. He is the first person to present the Standard Model of particle physics in a single report. He is best known for his prediction of the charm quark with Sheldon Lee Glashow and Luciano Maiani (the \\"GIM mechanism\\"). Iliopoulos is also known for demonstrating the cancellation of anomalies in the Standard model.Bouchiat, Cl, Iliopoulos, J, and Meyer, Ph (1972) . \\"An anomaly-free version of Weinberg's model.\\" Physics Letters B38, no. 7 (1972) 519-523. He is further known for the Fayet-Iliopoulos D-term formula, which was introduced in 1974. He is currently an honorary member of Laboratory of theoretical physics of √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure, Paris. ==Biography== Iliopoulos graduated from National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) in 1962 as a Mechanical-Electrical Engineer. He continued his studies in the field of Theoretical Physics in University of Paris, and in 1963 he obtained the D.E.A, in 1965 the Doctorat 3e Cycle, and in 1968 the Doctorat d' Etat titles. Between the years 1966 and 1968 he was a scholar at CERN, Geneva. From 1969 till 1971 he was a Research Associate in Harvard University. In 1971 he returned in Paris and began working at CNRS. He also held the director position of the Laboratory of Theoretical Physics of Ecole Normale Superieure between the years 1991-1995 and 1998-2002. In 2002, Iliopoulos was the first recipient of the Aristeio prize, which has been instituted to recognize Greeks who have made significant contributions towards furthering their chosen fields of science. Iliopoulos and Maiani were jointly awarded the 1987 Sakurai Prize for theoretical particle physics. In 2007 Iliopoulos and Maiani received the Dirac Medal of the ICTP \\"(f)or their work on the physics of the charm quark, a major contribution to the birth of the Standard Model, the modern theory of Elementary Particles.\\" == Scientific work == Iliopoulos is a specialist in high energy theoretical physics and elementary particle physics. In 1970, in collaboration with Sheldon L. Glashow and Luciano Ma√Øani, he introduced the so-called \\"GIM mechanism\\" (named after the three authors) which is an essential element of the theory of fundamental interactions known as the \\"Standard Model \\". This mechanism postulates the existence of a new elementary particle, the \\"charmed\\" quark, a prediction that was confirmed by experience. In 1972, in collaboration with Claude Bouchiat and Philippe Meyer, he demonstrated that the mathematical coherence of the Standard Model requires symmetry between the elementary constituents of matter, namely quarks (which form hadrons such as proton and neutron) and leptons (such as electron, muon and neutrinos). This symmetry is also verified experimentally. Iliopoulos was one of the pioneers of supersymetry, the hypothetical symmetry that links fermions and bosons. He showed that it has remarkable convergence properties and, in collaboration with P. Fayet, he proposed a mechanism that leads to its spontaneous breakage. He also studied some aspects of the quantum theory of gravitation as well as the mathematical properties of invariant gauge theories formulated in a non-commutative geometric space. == Most significant publications == * * * * * * * * * J.

He was a stylistic follower of Sir William Bruce, and planned several gardens in the grand French axial manner. ==Early life== Alexander Edward was the eldest son of Robert Edward, minister at Murroes in Angus, who was related by marriage to the Maule family, and as such enjoyed the patronage of the Maule Earls of Panmure. Alexander's diary records that his family had to hide from Cromwell's Puritan troops in the 1650s, and also that he had a squint.Lowrey, p.2 He graduated from the University of St Andrews in 1670.Colvin, p. 283. Edward was not ordained until 1679, and his activities during the 1670s are unknown. At this time, his father was writing a description of Angus, and preparing a map to accompany the book, entitled Angusia, Provincia Scotiae. The work was commissioned by George Maule, 2nd Earl of Panmure, and published in 1678. John Lowrey has suggested that Alexander assisted with Angusia, acquiring skills as a draughtsman and cartographer. Lowrey also speculates that he may have come into contact with Sir William Bruce at this time, as Bruce designed new gates for Panmure House in 1672.Lowrey, pp.3‚Äì8 Edward was one of the pallbearers at the funeral of Archbishop Sharp, the churchman murdered by Presbyterian Covenanters in 1679.Lowrey, p.9 From 1681 he was minister of Kemback in Fife, until 1689 when he was deprived of his parish as a non-juror, following the establishment of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland. Despite this, he was still minister in 1694, despite his manse being attacked by a mob in 1691.Lowrey, p.10 ==Architectural works== In around 1685, he prepared plans and elevations of Kinross House, designed by the King's architect Sir William Bruce as his own country house. He worked as Bruce's draughtsman again on an unexecuted scheme for the house and gardens of Kinnaird Castle, Angus. He drew up plans for Melville House in Fife, where Bruce was also involved, and where James Smith served as main contractor and designer.Glendinning, et al, p.99 In 1699 he made a drawing of Falkland Palace for its keeper, the 2nd Marquis of Atholl. Edward's first architectural commission came from James Maule, 4th Earl of Panmure, for the reconstruction of Brechin Castle as a country seat, on which he worked from 1696 to 1708. This remains his only known substantial work, and shows the stylistic influence of William Bruce. In 1700 he was involved in the building of Rossie House in Angus for Patrick Scott (now demolished), and he also oversaw interior works at Kellie Castle, Angus, another Maule property. He may have been responsible for the designs of Careston Castle, which was extended from an L-plan to a symmetrical U-plan shape in 1702.Glendinning, et al, p.84 He made a survey of the Castlestead or Nether Palace at Falkland Palace.Blair Catle muninments. In 1704 he designed the monument to John Murray, 1st Marquess of Atholl in Dunkeld Cathedral. ==Travels to Europe== He was sent on a fact-finding mission in 1701‚Äì02 by a group of Jacobite-leaning nobles, led by the Earls of Mar and Panmure. Edward was charged with visiting country seats in England, including Chatsworth and Castle Howard, before meeting various well-known craftsmen in London. He was then to travel to Paris and the low countries, visiting Versailles, Marly and St Cloud. His main aim was to collect material on the most up-to-date architectural styles, as well as observing land improvements, water works, mines and other projects. He bought plans, made sketches and took notes, building up a large collection of material, which several of his patrons attempted to secure on Edward's death.Gifford, p.67. Most of his collection is now apparently lost. Another, more secret, purpose to his journey was to convey coded letters from the Duke of Hamilton to James Stuart, the \\"Old Pretender\\", at his court-in-exile at Saint-Germain.Glendinning, et al, p.102 ==Landscape gardening== Edward assisted William Bruce with the layout for the gardens at Hopetoun House, as well as at Kinross. In 1708 Edward prepared drawings for the \\"Great Design\\" of the landscape around Hamilton Palace, for Duchess Anne Hamilton. The enormous scheme included plantations, forest rides, and mounds in the shape of the cinquefoils of the Hamilton arms. It was never fully realised, due to the deaths of Edward that year, and of Anne in 1716, and due to the expense of the proposals. However, the Nethertoun area of Hamilton was demolished, and a great avenue laid out, later terminated by William Adam's Chatelherault.Marshall, p. 216. ==Death== Alexander Edward died in Edinburgh, and was buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard. The antiquary Robert Sibbald described him as a \\"great master in architecture, and contrivance of avenues, gardens and orchards\\". ==References== *Colvin, Howard (1978) A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects 1600‚Äì1840, James Murray *Gifford, John (1989) William Adam 1689‚Äì1748, Mainstream Publishing / RIAS *Glendinning, Miles, MacInnes, Ranald and Mckechnie, Aonghus (1996) A History of Scottish Architecture, Edinburgh University Press *Lowrey, John (1987) A Man of Excellent Parts: Alexander Edward, Minister, Architect, Jacobite, University of St Andrews *Marshall, Rosalind K.

The adventure was written by Bob Blake and published by TSR in 1985 as part of the Competition, or C-series of modules, and contains material first used in a tournament adventure at GenCon XVI. C5 The Bane of Llywelyn continues the story that started in C4 To Find a King. ==Plot summary== Two hundred years before the start of the adventure, the royal line of kings of Pellham was deposed and replaced by a High Council. The current council is well-meaning but hopelessly incompetent. Excitement and unrest grip the land of Pellham, and the people agree that a drastic change is needed for the kingdom to survive. An ancient Prophecy of Brie foretells that a king from the past will return to restore the kingdom. The symbols of the ancient kings have been recovered, the keys to the royal tomb are in hand, powerful magics to revive the long-dead king have been secured at great cost. The king's burial location remains unknown.Blake, Bob. The Bane of Llywelyn, TSR, Inc., 1985. The player characters must find where he is buried. ==Publication history== C5 The Bane of Llywelyn was written by Bob Blake, with a cover by Keith Parkinson and interior illustrations by Ron Randall, and was published by TSR in 1985 as a 32-page booklet with two outer folders. It is a sequel to To Find a King, as the second part of the two-part Prophecy of Brie series. The Bane of Llywelyn was used in the AD&D; tournament at GenCon XVI. The C in the module code represents the first letter in the word competition, the name of C1‚ÄìC6 module series. The four parts of C5 were originally published as separate mini- modules included in issue Nos. 16‚Äì19 of the RPGA's Polyhedron newsletter: RPGA5 The Riddle of Dolmen Moor, RPGA6 The Incants of Ishcabeble, RPGA7 Llewelyn's Tomb, and RPGA8 ...And the Gods Will Have Their Way. ==Reception== Mark Davies reviewed the module in Imagine magazine, giving it a positive review. He noted that it is more flexible than C4 and can be used without that module, even in a campaign setting. The Bane of Llywelyn contains four scenarios comprising both dungeon and wilderness elements, and introduces two new monsters and one new weapon. Davies pointed out that it is \\"above average in conception\\" with \\"a lot of good ideas\\". However, he suggested the module be used for 4‚Äì7 player characters of level 6‚Äì8, as he considered one of the scenarios too tough. Davies viewed some of the puzzles and riddles as \\"obtuse\\", noting that successful tournament play in the US \\"depends more on high IQ than on role playing\\". His main criticism was aimed at the maps‚Äîtheir poor quality or, for the final scenario, the total lack thereof. Pointing out that it could be easily transplanted from its original Celtic setting into another cultural environment, Davies viewed it as \\"a good ideas module\\", but not one that could be played without work on the game master's part. ==See also== *List of Dungeons & Dragons modules ==References== Category:Dungeons & Dragons modules ","title":"The Bane of Llywelyn"},{"id":"11647291","text":"Zvi Kolitz (; December 14, 1912 ‚Äì September 29, 2002) was a Lithuanian-born Jewish film and theatrical producer and a writer whose short story Yosl Rakover Talks to God became a classic of Holocaust literature. ==Life== Zvi Kolitz, a son of a prominent rabbinical family, was born in Alytus, Lithuania. He studied at the nearby Yeshiva of Slobodka and then lived for several years in Italy, where he attended the University of Florence and the Naval Academy at Civitavecchia. He emigrated to Palestine before the 1947‚Äì1949 Palestine war and led recruiting efforts for the Zionist Revisionist movement. He was arrested by the British and jailed for his political activities. After Israel's independence in 1948, Kolitz became active in the state's literary and cultural life. In 2002, Kolitz died of natural causes in New York, NY. ==Yosl Rakover Talks to God== Kolitz is best known for Yosl Rakover Talks to God, a short story he wrote in 1946 for a Jewish newspaper in Buenos Aires. In the story, set in the final days of the Warsaw Ghetto, a pious Jew challenges God. And so, my God, before I die, freed from all fear, beyond all terror, in a state of absolute inner peace and trust, I will allow myself to call you to account one last time in my life, the fictionalized Rakover says, adding later I believe in the God of Israel, even when he has done everything to make me cease to believe in him. A few years after it was published, the story was translated into English and Hebrew but without Kolitz's name as the author. It was passed on as an authentic testimony of the Warsaw Ghetto and ended up in several Holocaust anthologies and even as a meditation in Jewish prayer books. It was many years before Kolitz was able to recapture his story and claim it as his own. It was later translated under his name in editions in Polish, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Danish and Swedish. In 1999, Pantheon Books published the story in a slim volume with afterwords by Paul Badde, Emmanuel Levinas and Leon Wieseltier. Dr. Levinas called it a text both beautiful and true, true as only fiction can be. ==Other works== While living in Israel in the early 1950s, Kolitz was a co-writer and co-producer of Hill 24 Doesn't Answer (1954), a 1947‚Äì1949 Palestine war movie, which was Israel's first full- length motion picture. He later moved to the United States and was co-producer of Rolf Hochhuth's The Deputy, one of the first plays to challenge the Vatican's silence during the Holocaust, which ran on Broadway, amid considerable controversy, for nine months in 1964. Kolitz was co-producer of several other Broadway shows, including The Megilla of Itzik Manger (1968), and a musical, I'm Solomon, an expensive flop that ran for seven performances in 1968. Kolitz also wrote several works of fiction and Jewish philosophy, including The Tiger Beneath the Skin: Stories and Parables of the Years of Death (Creative Age Press, 1947), Survival for What? (The Philosophical Library, 1969), The Teacher: An Existential Approach to the Bible (Jason Aronson, 1982) and Confrontation: The Existential Thought of Rabbi J. B. Soloveitchik (Ktav, 1993). Until a few weeks before his death, Kolitz wrote a weekly column for the Yiddish newspaper Algemeiner Journal. The column appeared under his name for 32 years. He also taught courses in Jewish thought for many years at Yeshiva University. == Awards == * 1999: National Jewish Book Award in the Nonfiction category for Yosl Rakover Talks to God == Sources == * ==References== Category:20th-century American writers Category:Yiddish- language writers Category:Jewish American writers Category:Film producers from New York (state) Category:University of Florence alumni Category:Lithuanian Jews Category:Jewish refugees Category:Lithuanian emigrants to Italy Category:Italian Jews Category:British Jews Category:British people of Lithuanian-Jewish descent Category:Italian emigrants to the United Kingdom Category:British emigrants to the United States Category:American people of Lithuanian-Jewish descent Category:People from Alytus Category:People from New York City Category:1912 births Category:2002 deaths ","title":"Zvi Kolitz"},{"id":"11647314","text":"Rie fu is J-pop singer Rie fu's self-titled debut album, released in 2005.

Davis felt that the suggested levels for PCs were too high, and should have been more like 7-10; he suspected that this was done \\"so that Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser could be used\\", and had \\"a sneaking suspicion that American produced modules are written with a few levels of slack in them, so that it's possible to take the Rambo approach\\".

He found \\"Return of the Rats\\" excellent with good role-playing opportunities and nice NPC characterization, although he found the sewer system in the scenario disappointing and illogical.

The creek descends over its course. Ginninderra Creek is impounded by Gungahlin Pond and Lake Ginninderra, a man-made lake that was constructed in 1974 to act as a sedimentation pond. The creek flows over the Ginninderra Falls, descending , and through Ginninderra Gorge, to its confluence with the Murrumbidgee River. The catchment of Ginninderra Creek covers approximately . The Ginninderra Creek catchment carries approximately a quarter of Canberra's urban runoff, and there is considerable risk of runoff from urban areas harming aquatic ecosystems in the Murrumbidgee River system. ==Recreation== Ginninderra Falls was a popular scenic tourist destination, opened initially as a private tourist park from the late 1990s. John Gale argued that the Ginninderra Falls were so pretty that Canberra should be chosen as the capital city of Australia, rather than the proposal to choose Dalgety as the location for the national capital.

A positive toluidine blue test causes the solution to turn from blue to pink. A similar test can be performed with phloroglucinol-HCl solution, which turns red. ==Other histological uses== Toluidine blue is often used to identify mast cells, by virtue of the heparin in their cytoplasmic granules. It is also used to stain proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans in tissues such as cartilage. The strongly acidic macromolecular carbohydrates of mast cells and cartilage are coloured red by the blue dye, a phenomenon called metachromasia. Alkaline solutions of toluidine blue are commonly used for staining semi-thin (0.5 to 1 Œºm) sections of resin-embedded tissue. At high pH (about 10) the dye binds to nucleic acids and all proteins. Although everything in the tissue is stained, structural details are clearly visible because of the thinness of the sections. Semi-thin sections are used in conjunction with ultra-thin sections examined by electron microscopy. Toluidine blue is also commonly used to stain frozen sections (rapid microscopic analysis of a specimen). Because time is of the essence for a frozen section, toluidine blue allows for the frozen section to be stained and reviewed in 10-20 seconds.Sridharan G, Shankar A. \\"Toluidine blue: A review of its chemistry and clinical utility. J Oral Maxillofac Pathol. 2012 May-Aug; 16(2):251-255 The other staining method for frozen sections (rapid H&E;) takes approximately 60 to 90 seconds. ==Clinical uses== The dye is sometimes used by surgeons to help highlight areas of mucosal dysplasia (which preferentially take up the dye compared to normal tissue) in premalignant lesions (e.g. leukoplakia). This can be used to choose the best site of the lesion to biopsy, or during surgery to remove the lesion to decide whether to remove more tissue from the margins of the excision defect or leave it behind. ==References== * Carson FL (1997) Histotechnology.

The grand opening for the Eagles Building was September 13, 1927. Since its construction in 1926, the Eagles Club has known several incarnations. Prominently among them, it housed the Fraternal Order of the Eagles, a notable organization whose considerable impacts on America's cultural landscape remain in effect today. The Eagles pushed for the foundation of Mother's Day, provided the impetus for a national Social Security program, and campaigned to eliminate job discrimination on the basis of age. Notable former Eagles include Theodore Roosevelt, Warren G. Harding, Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, John F. Kennedy, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. The building now operates as The Rave / Eagles Club, a purveyor of music to Milwaukee for twenty years. ==References== ==External links== * * Club details at milwaukeerocks.com Category:Buildings and structures in Milwaukee Category:Culture of Milwaukee Category:Music venues in Wisconsin Category:Theatres on the National Register of Historic Places in Wisconsin Category:National Register of Historic Places in Milwaukee Category:Professional wrestling venues in the United States Category:1927 establishments in Wisconsin ","title":"The Rave/Eagles Club"},{"id":"11647540","text":"Ugo Locatelli (; 5 February 1916 ‚Äì 28 May 1993) was an Italian international footballer who played as a midfielder or as a forward.

During his time with Atalanta, he also played as an offensive central midfielder. ==Honours== ===Club=== Brescia * Serie B Runner-up: 1932‚Äì33 Ambrosiana Inter * Serie A Winner: 1937‚Äì38, 1939‚Äì40 * Coppa Italia Winner: 1938‚Äì39 Juventus * Coppa Italia Winner: 1941‚Äì42 * Serie A Runner-up: 1940‚Äì41 ===International=== Italy * Olympic Gold Medal: 1936 * FIFA World Cup: 1938 ===Individual=== * FIFA World Cup All-Star Team: 1938 ==References== ==External links== *Career statistics *DatabaseOlympics.com profile *Juventus Profile *1938 FIFA World Cup Final Line-up *All Star Team of the 1938 FIFA World Cup *Gold Medal Winning team of the 1936 Olympic Football Tournament Category:1916 births Category:1993 deaths Category:People from the Province of Brescia Category:Association football midfielders Category:Association football forwards Category:Italian footballers Category:Italy international footballers Category:Footballers at the 1936 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic gold medalists for Italy Category:Olympic footballers of Italy Category:1938 FIFA World Cup players Category:FIFA World Cup-winning players Category:Brescia Calcio players Category:Inter Milan players Category:Juventus F.C. players Category:Serie A players Category:Serie B players Category:Olympic medalists in football Category:Medalists at the 1936 Summer Olympics ","title":"Ugo Locatelli"},{"id":"11647544","text":"Sekolah Don Bosco Pondok Indah (also known as Sekolah Henricus Don Bosco Pondok Indah, Don Bosco or DBPI, affectionately called DB) is a private Catholic school located in Pondok Indah, South Jakarta.

It is also known as wire decking or ventilated shelving. ==Features== Wire decking consists of wire mesh supported by metal supports and is intended to be load-bearing. The mesh is usually welded to the supports, but may be attached in other ways as well. In commercial and industrial applications, the wire mesh usually has a minimum wire gauge of 0.105 inches when round wire is used. The most common shelf size is 42 inches deep by 46 inches wide, while two such shelves placed side-by- side can usually be combined to allow for a single shelf of 8 feet wide. The weight capacity of a 42x46 shelf ranges from 2,000 to 3,500 pounds, while the decking itself weighs from 24 to 30 pounds. The finish on the steel may either be painted or sprayed on, or be electroplated with zinc. Electroplating is more common with Chinese manufacturers while painting or spraying is more common with American manufacturers.Wire Decking from China, Inv. 701-TA-466 and 731-TA-1162, United States International Trade Commission, July 2010 Wire shelving is used in a broad range of commercial and home applications. It is often used in restaurant, food service and retail store applications due to its ability to stay clean and resist rust and mold. It is also used by retailers, in industrial applications and in home kitchens as well. Wire shelving is excellent in areas where fire prevention is stressed because its open design allows sprinkler systems to function where solid shelving might block water flow. Chrome-plated steel is much cheaper and much less rust resistant to scratches. Typical colors are chrome, white and black. == Manufacturing == Wire shelving for industrial use consists of steel wire, used for the decking, and steel sheets, used for the supports. The wire makes up about 60% of the weight and the sheet steel about 40%. Coiled steel wire is cut to the correct lengths required using straight-cut machines. Then, these individual wires are fed through a welding machine that joins them, using electric-resistance welding at each junction. The creates a continuous wire mesh, which is then cut to the lengths required. Manufacturers receive sheets of steel pre-cut for the widths required. The sheets are fed through a roll- forming machine to create a \\"U\\" or \\"V\\" shape. The roll-forming machine also cuts the supports to the length required. After welding, the decking is coated with either baked-on enamel or baked-on powder coating. This requires a cleaning process, heat drying, cooling, paint dip, and then final curing. The decking can instead be electroplated with zinc. Most manufacturers use the same equipment to produce other products. These include concrete reinforcement, mining, containers and other items made from steel mesh == Market == In 2008, eleven firms in the United States produced comprised 99% of that country's industry. Most US manufacturers sell wire decking nationwide. Manufacturers usually sell to distributors rather than directly to customers, with big-box retail being a large buyer. Walmart was the number one purchaser for several years during the 2000s. Both US and Chinese firms had high levels of excess capacity around 2010, allowing them to quickly respond to potential increases in demand. Manufacturers reported that the product had changed very little in the previous decade. There is no predictable business cycle in the wire decking industry. Demand closely tracks industrial output and real estate construction, but with a 6 to 9-month delay. As a result, the wire decking industry didn't feel the effects of the Great Recession until well into 2009. The industry has developed a quality certification called \\"R-Mark.\\" In the 2000s, US producers accused China of subsidizing wire decking and unfair trade practices. A US Trade Commission investigation rejected these allegations. ==Incompatible Standards and Labeling== However, not all pole diameters and shelf widths in use are the same. The various plastic connectors are not interchangeable among manufacturers. Many use proprietary designs that do not fit with the systems of other makers. This variance tends to make it difficult to mix and match various brands of shelving. ==References== Category:Furniture ","title":"Wire shelving"},{"id":"11647597","text":"Aero Flight 311 (AY311), often referred to as the Kvevlax air disaster, was a scheduled domestic passenger flight operated by Aero O/Y (now Finnair) between Kronoby, Finland and Vaasa. The aircraft, a Douglas DC-3C, crashed in the municipality Kvevlax (), nowadays part of Korsholm () on 3 January 1961, killing all twenty-five people on board. The disaster remains the deadliest civilian aviation accident in the history of Finland. The investigation revealed that both pilots were intoxicated and should not have been flying. == Flight chronology == Flight route The Douglas DC-3, registered OH-LCC, was scheduled to take-off at 7:00, but take-off preparations were late and the plane departed at 7:16. The co-pilot requested free flying altitude from the air traffic control, which was permitted. This allowed Flight 311 to fly at any altitude above the minimum flight altitude for the Kruununkyl√§-Vaasa route which was . The pilots did not follow these regulations for the last , during which they flew below . Memorial (in Swedish) to the dead in Kvevlax with the names of the victims Shortly after the flight's last radio contact with the air traffic control, in which the pilots confirmed the weather report and said that they would be at the Sepp√§ NDB radio beacon in a few minutes, the flight was starting to prepare for landing by descending below . Next, the plane turned abruptly to the left. This slowed the plane and disrupted air flow significantly. The pilots tried to correct the situation by applying full throttle. This did not help and the plane went into a spin. The last thing seen by eyewitnesses on ground was that the pilots had turned the landing lights on before the plane crashed into the woods at 07:40:30 in a steep 70 degrees turn. The first people to arrive at the scene after 10 minutes were unable to rescue anyone from the wreck burning in flames over in height. The aircraft was extensively destroyed by impact forces and the fire. == Investigation == The officials concluded that the plane had been completely airworthy, and that the probable cause of the accident was a pilot error when making a left turn. The possibility was noted that one passenger might have been present in the cockpit, based on his body location. No evidence was found of any technical malfunction, of the plane hitting trees, nor of an explosion. It was possible that the plane controls had been frozen, as it was a cold winter day. The investigation report concluded that this was unlikely in the flying conditions, and an intact wing that had separated from the main wreckage did not have any ice on it. The pilots had not reported any icing on the plane via radio either. According to the report by the Accident Investigation Board, the pilot Captain Lars Hattinen and co-pilot Veikko Halme were not in a fit state to fly. They had not slept well in the previous night, and they had been drinking heavily. Autopsies revealed that pilot Hattinen had a blood alcohol content of 0.20 (2 ‚Ä∞), while co-pilot Halme had a BAC of 0.156 (1.56 ‚Ä∞). In all, the group that included one person more besides Hattinen and Halme, had drunk 16 bottles of beer, 7 gin grogs and 900 grams of cognac from 21:50 to 02:00. Hattinen had thus neglected his responsibility for the plane's and passengers' safety, and while co-pilot Halme had been in Hattinen's command, with no official responsibility to prevent him from flying, he too should not have been flying that day. Both the International Civil Aviation Organization's treaty and the pilots' personal job contracts barred intoxication while in command of a plane‚Äîprovisions that the pilots ignored. In the police interrogation, no one working at the airport said they had noticed that the pilots were intoxicated. Only a construction worker, whose brother was one of the victims, said he had noted the possibility based on their behavior but could not have been certain. Both Captain Hattinen and co- pilot Halme were World War II veteran pilots with Hattinen being a former fighter ace having six aerial victories. == Flight number == Although airlines often retire the flight numbers of flights involved in fatal accidents, the successor of Aero O/Y, Finnair, continued to use flight number AY311 on its Helsinki‚ÄìVaasa route for a long time. The flight number was recently changed to AY313. The flights are operated mainly with Embraer 190 or ATR 72, but some busy Monday and Friday flights are operated by Airbus A320 family aircraft. == See also == *Aero Flight 217, Aero O/Y's other fatal DC-3 accident in 1963 *JAL Cargo Flight 8054, a fatal DC-8 accident in 1977 where the captain was intoxicated == References == == External links == *AirDisaster.com account of the crash (Archive) * * Official report by the Accident Investigation Board Finland 311 Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 1961 Category:Airliner accidents and incidents caused by pilot error Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in Finland Category:1961 in Finland Category:Korsholm Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Douglas C-47 Skytrain Category:January 1961 events ","title":"Aero Flight 311"},{"id":"11647604","text":"This is a list of British periodicals established in the 19th century, excluding daily newspapers.

One of 11 siblings, he attended St Margaret Mary's Secondary School and supported Celtic as a child. Ray Houghton, who would also become an international footballer, was a downstairs neighbour in the same tenement block. After a short spell in the Junior grade with Cambuslang Rangers (which had quickly escalated from a casual kickaround with workmates at the nearby steel works), in early 1970 he was signed by Aberdeen whose scout Bobby Calder offered generous terms to persuade him to move north with Celtic also showing interest.Celtic-mad Arthur Graham let head rule his heart when signing for Aberdeen, The National, 28 October 2018 He played in five league matches during his first season with the club, and despite his inexperience, he was given a place in the starting line- up for the 1970 Scottish Cup Final by manager Eddie Turnbull. Aberdeen defeated Celtic 3‚Äì1 with 17-year-old Graham making two assists via left-wing crosses. He remained at Aberdeen until July 1977, winning the Scottish League Cup in his final season (again beating Celtic in the final).Aberdeen hero recalls first and last Scottish Cup victory over Rangers at Ibrox, The Scotsman, 9 March 2019 He played a total of 298 matches for The Dons, scoring 45 goals. He joined Leeds United for ¬£125,000 at the start of the 1977‚Äì78 season. He scored a total of 47 goals in 260 appearances for Leeds over six seasons, including a hat-trick against Birmingham City on 14 January 1978 - the first hat-trick to be scored by a Leeds United player in any competition for nearly five years. However, Leeds were relegated to the Second Division in the 1981‚Äì82 season and failed to regain their status in the top flight in 1982‚Äì83. Graham was subsequently sold to Manchester United for ¬£45,000 in August 1983. He remained at Old Trafford for two seasons, scoring seven goals in 52 appearances in all competitions, before finishing his career at Bradford City where he remained until 1987. ==International career== Having been capped at under-23 level at Aberdeen, Graham's international career seemed to be over prematurely when he was one of a group of squad players (including Billy Bremner and Joe Harper) 'banned for life' after an incident in Copenhagen in 1975. He was later reprieved, and won a total of 11 full international caps for Scotland while playing for Leeds, making his debut against East Germany in 1977. He scored twice at international level, against Argentina and Northern Ireland ‚Äì both in 1979. ==Post-playing activities== Graham has spent time coaching youngsters at the Leeds United Academy and at football schools in the Wetherby area where he settled \\\\- often working with Jimmy Lumsden. His younger brothers Jimmy and Tommy were also footballers. ==Honours== Aberdeen *Scottish Cup: 1969‚Äì70 *Scottish League Cup: 1976‚Äì77 Manchester United *FA Charity Shield: 1983 ==In popular culture== Graham is frequently mentioned in the letters page of the comic Viz. In every edition, there will be a recommendation from a 'reader' that Graham is the only man to be considered for a range of positions. Graham has been recommended for a host of unlikely positions, such as taking over from Jeremy Clarkson as host of Top Gear, mediating peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, taking the editor's position at the London Evening Standard ahead of George Osborne, and presenting The Great British Bake Off. == References == ==External links== *Profile at leeds-fans.org *Profile at sportingheroes.net * *Hall Of Fame profile at AFC Heritage Trust Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:Scottish footballers Category:Scotland international footballers Category:Aberdeen F.C. players Category:Leeds United F.C. players Category:Manchester United F.C. players Category:Cambuslang Rangers F.C. players Category:Bradford City A.F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Footballers from Glasgow Category:Scottish Football League players Category:Association football wingers Category:Scotland under-23 international footballers Category:Bradford City A.F.C. non-playing staff Category:Leeds United F.C. non-playing staff Category:Sheet metal workers ","title":"Arthur Graham"},{"id":"11647620","text":"Kevin Brown, historian, archivist, curator and writer Kevin Brown (born 1961) has been Trust Archivist and Alexander Fleming Laboratory Museum Curator at St Mary's NHS Trust, subsequently Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, since 1989, having set up the archives service for St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, London, England, in 1989 and having established the museum in 1993.

The site has served as the headquarters of the Audubon Society of Western Pennsylvania (ASWP) since 1977. The Western Pennsylvania Conservancy owns the land on which Beechwood Farms is located, and leases the site to the Audubon Society of Western PA. The nature reserve comprises woodlands, fields, streams, and a pond. It also features more than of walking trails‚Äîopen from dawn to dusk every day year-round, some of which are accessible for individuals with special needs. ==Audubon Society at Beechwood== Audubon facilities at Beechwood Farms now include classrooms, a teacher resource center, a natural history library, the Audubon Nature Store, and the Evans Nature Center auditorium. When built in the 1980s, the education building made use of green building techniques, including natural light and heat conserving mechanisms, and composting toilets. The history of Audubon at Beechwood began when Rachel Mellon Walton, along with her daughter, Farley Walton Whetzel, acquired the former Flinn estate. In the 1970s the two women donated the land to the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy, which selected the Audubon Society to be the stewards of the reserve. The Flinn estate dates back to 1903. After his retirement from politics, William Flinn (1851‚Äì1924), a prominent Pittsburgh businessman and politician, bought the property, which then occupied more than on both sides of Dorseyville Road.

These two exceptional fights were featured on ESPN's \\"Classic Fights of the Century\\".\\"Attillio Castellani (Obit)\\", The Times Leader, Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, pg. 6, 11 Sep 2008 Castellani was born in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, to Attilio Castellani (1889‚Äì1974) and Rose Isopi Castellani (1896‚Äì1938), who later moved to Margate City, formerly South Atlantic City. He began boxing as a teenager at local gyms, and at a younger age would box opponents to entertain neighborhood kids.Konopki, Dave, The Times Leader, \\"Fighter In And Out of the Ring\\", Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, pg. 11, 15 September 2008Social Security Death Index Interactive Search As a young man, he fought as a Marine in the battle of Iwo Jima during World War II. He boxed in the Marine Corps and won the title of \\"Champion of All China and Guam\\". After his discharge from the Marines he embarked on his professional boxing career around 1945. After a three month layoff from the ring on May 7, 1949, Castellani handily defeated Tony DeMicco before 1435 fans in New York's St. Nicholas Arena in a well publicized ten round unanimous decision. Castellani staggered his opponent in the third round, winning the bout from long range, and defending DeMicco's attempts to fight inside. Castellani was voted Ring Magazine's \\"Rookie of the Year\\" in 1948.\\"Rocky Castellani Outpoints DeMicco\\", Mauch Chunk Time-News, Mauch Chunk, Pennsylvania, pg. 1, 7 May 1949\\"Rocky Castellani Beats DeMicco in Ten Rounder\\", Hartford Courant, Hartford, Connecticut, pg. 12, 7 May 1949 On September 9, 1949, Castellani lost to skilled middleweight Kid Gavilan in a ten round unanimous decision at Madison Square Garden. All three judges scored for Gavilan by a significant margin of winning rounds. Castellani was knocked down in both rounds two and three, but surged in the middle rounds despite his hard tumble in round two. Castellani showed conditioning and skill but suffered in points from his two knockdowns. The Associated Press gave six rounds to Gavilan, and only three to Castellani, as did one of the judges. In a noteworthy victory on November 14, 1951, Castellani defeated Joey Giardello before 1,932 in a convincing ten round decision in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Giardello would become an exceptional boxer, taking the WBA World Middleweight Title between 1963-65. Castellani took charge of the future champion between the fourth and the ninth, though appeared to be coasting. He had taken four months off from a rib injury he received during training.\\"Rocky Castellani Wins Easily Over Giardello\\", The Courier News, Bridgewater, New Jersey, pg. 37, 14 November 19511,932 fans in \\"Castellani Wins\\", The Honolulu Advertiser, Honolulu, Hawaii, pg. 22, 14 November 1951 On June 18, 1952, Castellani defeated Johnny Bratton at Chicago Stadium. Both judges scored the fight closely, but the referee gave a larger ten point margin to Bratton. Bratton was a noteworthy opponent who would compete for the World Middleweight Title on November 13, 1953 against Kid Galavan at Chicago Stadium, though he lost by large points margin. ==World middleweight championship contention== On January 9, 1953 Castellani defeated Ralph Jones at Madison Square Garden before 5,400 fans in an important win before a home crowd that clearly favored Castellani as their local boy.\\"Castellani Wins Split Decision From Jones\\", The Los Angeles Times, pg. 40, 10 January 1953 The Associated Press gave the fight to Rocky, winning six rounds, losing three, and drawing one. Only one judge dissented from a voting for Castellani, resulting in a split decision.\\"Rocky Castellani Too Speedy for Jones\\", The Terre Haute Tribune, Terre Haute, Indiana, pg. 6, 10 January 1953 The win moved Castellani to the second round of the World Middleweight Championship tournament to meet Sugar Ray Robinson for the title. Jones was never able to fight in close as Castellani circled, jabbed, hooked, and threw leading rights. Castellani clinched, armlocked or hugged when Jones attempted in-fighting, and was also successful at backing away to avoid the close shots at which Jones could be dangerous. His ability to backpedal so effectively may have indicated better conditioning than his opponent. There were no knockdowns in the close bout in which Castellani seemed to employ a more effective strategy. The bout was a convincing display of in-fighting defense by Castellani, who claimed he had learned Jones's style by watching his bout with Johnny Bratton on television. Jones' strongest winning round was the fifth when he swept Castellani with sweeping body attacks, and he was down from slips in the seventh and tenth rounds.Lee, Joe, \\"Castellani Gains Langlois Booking\\", The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Brooklyn, New York, pg. 6, 10 January 1953\\"Rocky Castellani Gets Nod Over Jones\\", The Gazette and Daily Newspapers, York, Pennsylvania, pg. 21, 10 January 1953 On February 6, 1953, Castellani lost to Frenchman Pierre Langlois in twelve rounds before 4,887 fans in a Madison Garden upset Split Decision. The bout confirmed Castellani's standing as the top contender for the title in the United States. Notably, the match became Castellani's exit from a World Middleweight Title elimination tournament. Castellani led the pre-fight betting 3-1 over the Frenchman who had a spotty record and was not well known to the New York fans. In an extremely close split decision, two of the judges scored for Langlois but only by one point. Langlois's strong finish in the final two rounds sealed his victory, and he appeared the aggressor throughout the bout, but Castellani's speed and footwork remained impressive in the very close bout. A critical question was whether Castellani had been knocked down in the eleventh round or pushed. The judges disagreed on the issue, and it swayed one judge and referee Ruby Goldstein's scoring in favor of Langlois in the close bout. Eleven of fifteen boxing writers thought Castellani had won, but the judges who believed Castellani had been knocked down in the eleventh from a blow by Langlois gave the decision to him and removed Rocky's hopes to advance in the tournament. The United Press gave only a slimmest one point lead in their determination of who won the match.UP favored Langlois in \\"Knockdown Earns Langlois Verdict\\", The Times, San Mateo, California, pg. 11, 7 February 1953 The loss ended Castellani's goal of making an immediate shot at the World Middleweight Title against Sugar Ray Robinson, but he would get his chance at the reigning champion two years later in a non-title bout.Hand, Jack, \\"Langlois Upsets Rocky Castellani in Close Bout\\", The Progress, Clearfield, Pennsylvania, pg. 6, 7 February 1953 Sugar Ray Robinson, 1947 The highlight of Castellani's career was his ten round split decision near Hollywood, California on July 22, 1955 against Hall of Famer and world middleweight champion Sugar Ray Robinson. Castellani lost the split decision but knocked Robinson down in the sixth round for a count of nine, though Robinson quickly rose and resumed the bout. After his knockdown, Robinson rallied quickly, leading the bout with furious body punching which impressed the judges. He had difficulty going to the head of Castellani, though he did at times when his opponent occasionally lowered his defense. The thrilling spectacle which attracted 8,230 featured a close contest between Castellani, the top contender for the middleweight championship and Robinson, who would successfully defend his title against Bobo Olson in his next fight on December 9, 1955. Robinson called upon all his fifteen years of boxing experience to win the bout against a skilled opponent who was nearly his equal if only for ten rounds.Stirling, Scotty, \\"Ray Rises From Deck to Get Nod\\", Oakland Tribune, pg. 13, 23 June 1955 A year earlier on August 20, 1954, Castellani lost a unanimous fifteen round decision before a crowd of 11,000 to Carl \\"Bobo\\" Olson for the World Middleweight Title in Daly City. Olson was the World Middleweight Champion from 1953-55. In the eleventh, Olson was down for a three count when his legs tangled with his opponent's, but Castellani was down for a full nine count in the twelfth from a crushing right overhand from Olson. In the remaining three rounds, Castellani, wounded and exhausted, backpedaled and held to finish the bout. The fight was largely one sided in the final three rounds, but the judges' scoring showed the effort made by Castellani to remain in the bout for the first ten rounds.Whorton, Cal, \\"Bobo on Floor in Title Bout\\", The Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, pg. 35, 21 August 1954 On January 4, 1956, Castellani lost to talented middleweight Gene Fullmer in a televised bout at the Arena in Cleveland, losing in a very close, ten round Split Decision. Many of the crowd of 1,487, as well as the judges and reporters disagreed on the outcome of the fight. Two of the judges gave the bout to Fullmer by a margin of only three points or less, with one judge dissenting. The Associated Press disagreed with the official ruling, giving the fight to Castellani by a close margin of 97-93. The United Press gave the close bout to Fullmer, however, by a score of 98-91. Fullmer may have won the bout by taking the lead in the boxing, while Castellani continuously countered and defended many of Fullmer's blows. Fullmer established a hit and hold technique that helped him win the infighting by a shade. When Castellani went to the inside, Fullmer frequently landed blows to Castellani's mid-section, usually with his left. In the late sixth, Fullmer took the lead opening a gash on Fullmer, and then pounded what was already his aching mid-section to take the seventh, his best round. The tenth was a close and furious round where Castellani may have been trying for a knockout as his only hope, but Fullmer countered effectively to keep the round and the bout close. Fullmer was rated fourth in the world middleweight standings behind Castellani who was rated among the top three contenders for the crown.Newkirk, Bill, \\"Fullmer Not Anxious for Title Scrap\\", The Evening News, Massilon, Ohio, pg. 18, 5 January 1956Fullmer took the sixth and seventh in \\"Fullmer Beats Rocky in Bloody Ring Go\\", The Cincinnati Enquirer, Cincinnati, Ohio, pg. 34, 5 January 1956Fullmer used a left up close in \\"Gene Fullmer Scores Upset in TV Fistics\\", The Journal Herald, Dayton, Ohio, pg. 6, 5 January 1956 On August 3, 1956, Castellani lost to skilled middleweight Joey Giambra by a significant points margin in a ten round split decision at Madison Square Garden. Giambra in pre-fight betting had an 8-5 lead over his opponent, and proved his advantage in the fight. Castellani retreated constantly throughout the first five rounds only rarely moving to make a punch and unable to face the stronger, and better skilled Giambra. Giambra cornered Castellani in the sixth against the ropes, throwing blows with both hands, with Castellani having trouble. Weakened in the final four rounds, and moving slower, the action picked up.In trouble in the sixth in \\"Joey Giambra Whips Rocky Castellani Fri.\\", Greely Daily Tribune, Greely, Colorado, pg. 4, 4 August 1956 On December 10, 1956, Giambra defeated Castellani again in a ten round unanimous decision at the Civic Auditorium in San Francisco. Giambra seemed clearly behind in the first three rounds scoring at long range with left hooks and right leads. Giambra rallied, however, and scored in the fourth and fifth with combinations to the head, making Rocky appear wobbly. In the fifth, Giambra scored with combinations to the face, abandoning his signature left hook. He stayed with the combination, and it paid off especially in the ninth when he dropped Castellani in the ninth for a three count. Giambra felt Castellani had performed better than in their previous August fight.\\"Giambra Beats Castellani\\", Daily Independent Journal, San Rafael, California, pg. 12, 11 December 1956 Giambra praised Castellani for his ring generalship that carried him through the final six rounds, after Giambra had pounded him against the ropes in the fourth and the end looked near for his opponent. Though only three years younger, Giambra looked a decade younger than the veteran Castellani in both their 1956 meetings.Stevenson, Jack, \\"Giambra Seeks Joey Giardello After Victory, Santa Cruz Sentinel, pg. 11, 11 December 1956 He finished his career with a 65‚Äì14‚Äì4 record.Lisa A.

It assumes that undeclared economic activity still needs to use resources, such as electricity, to function. Since electricity consumption is generally well known it can be used as an indicator of economic activity that is not otherwise declared. The household electricity approach was developed by Maria Lacko as a method to determine the size of the hidden economy in a country. Lacko‚Äôs primary focus within this approach was directed at the relationship between the household electrical consumption and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of a country using regression analysis. Her research in this area was particularly focused on developing methodologies that would help to more accurately determine the prevalence of the hidden economy in transitional countries such as the former Soviet bloc countries. ==History== Lacko‚Äôs work received its basis from two other works. The first of these works, developed in 1995, is the method of Dobozi and Pohl. These researchers had suggested that aggregate economic activity and electrical power consumption were closely related (Lacko 2000, p. 347). In fact, from their observations, electrical consumption and GDP elasticity were close to a one-to-one ratio (Lacko 1999, p. 143). This was true in the case of countries under a market economy; however, it did not appear to be the case for former Soviet bloc countries. The works of Daniel Kaufman and Aleksandr Kaliberda followed a similar path as Istvan Dobozi and Gerhard Pohl's work. Kaufman and Kaliberda developed a method that considered the growth rate of the formal market's GDP and the growth of electrical consumption (Lacko 2000, p. 123). It was evident, as noted by Dobozi and Pohl, that change within the GDP resulted in lockstep changes with electrical consumption for market economies; however, Kaufman and Kaliberda also noted that the former Soviet bloc countries did not seem to maintain this consistency. The researchers suggested that the transitional nature of these countries' economic development created a break in the consistency between GDP and electrical consumption (Lacko 2000, p. 350). Kaufman and Kaliberda adapted their approach to allow for the calculation of this inconsistency between electrical activity and GDP. Lacko disagreed with the previous methods use of aggregate electrical consumption as the primary source of calculations to determine the extent of the hidden economy (Lacko 1999, p. 164). Additionally, Lacko expressed concerns with the assumption of a constant electrical intensification (Lacko 1999, p. 164). The household electricity approach was developed as an alternative (Lacko 1999, pp. 142‚Äì143). ==General Concepts== The household electricity approach follows the general idea that electrical consumption and GDP can help to estimate the size of a country's hidden market; however, the household electricity approach makes several diversions from the previous works for enhanced utility, particularly for transitional countries. The first of these was the decision to limit the concept of the informal market. Lacko limits the informal market to non-registered activities that consume household electricity. This excludes hidden activities such as bribes and many illegal activities (Lacko 1998, p. 132). By doing this, Lacko limited the magnitude of the data collecting process. Lacko also chose not to measure national electrical consumption; instead, the effort was centered on household electrical consumption (Lacko 2000, p. 361). This, in particular, would capture businesses within the informal market that were operating from a homestead. These businesses have been considered to be a traditional and rather large component of the informal economies of Eastern Europe. Additionally, Lacko presumed that household electrical consumption would not be as dramatically affected by structural changes caused by transitional experiences such as those of the former Soviet bloc countries. Lacko‚Äôs method begins with the basic premise that each household‚Äôs electrical consumption should be associated with a portion of the informal market (Lacko 1999, p. 161). This is determined by using time-series cross sections of each country. Within this method there are three proxy variables to be studied: tax/GDP ratio, the inactive/active labor ratio and the ratio of public social welfare expenditures (Lacko 2000, p. 362). For Lacko‚Äôs original study the parameters were focused around estimates of cross- sections from nineteen OECD countries in 1990, nineteen OECD countries in 1989 and panel data for 1989-1990(Lacko 2000, p. 362). The final determinization was completed by subtracting residential electrical consumption from the actual amount of electrical consumption (Lacko 2000, p. 362). ==Formula== 1nE + I = Œ±11nCi \\\\+ Œ±2Gi \\\\+ Œ±4Qi \\\\+ Œ±Hi \\\\+ Œ±6 Hi = Œ≤1Ti \\\\+ Œ≤2(Si ‚Äì Ti) + Œ≤3Di Œ≤1>0 Œ≤2 <0 Œ≤3 >0 where: :i : the number assigned to the country :Ei : per capita household electricity consumption in country i in Mtoe :Ci : per capita real consumption of households without the consumption of electricity in country i in US dollars( purchasing parity) :PRi : the real price of consumption of 1kwh of residential electricity in US dollars (at purchasing parity) :Gi : the relative frequency of months with the need of heating in houses in country i :Qi : the ratio of energy sources other than electric energy to all energy sources in household energy consumption :Hi : the per capita output of the hidden economy :Ti : the ratio of the sum of paid personal income, corporate profit and taxes on goods and services to GDP :Si : the ratio of public social welfare expenditures to GDP :Di : the sum of number of dependants over 14 years and of inactive earners, both per 100 active earners ::(Lacko 1998, p. 133) After the total electricity consumption of households has been determined, the next step is to proceed to find the informal economy‚Äôs contribution to the GDP of a country (Lacko 1998, p. 140). To create this index, Lacko had to determine a way to calculate how much GDP is produced by one unit of electricity (Lacko 1998, p. 140). This was done by taking known estimations of a market economy and making comparisons with this to another approach (Lacko 1998, p. 140). ==Advantages== The household electricity approach does not require predetermined weights as had been established in previous approaches utilizing electrical consumption to determine the extent of the hidden economy (Lacko 1999, p. 149). Instead the weights of the different causes can be determined during the estimation. By the use of residential electrical consumption, Lacko's approach allows for an accurate measure of market economies as well as transitional economies approaches utilizing electrical consumption to determine the extent of the hidden economy. ==Disadvantages== A disadvantage of the household electricity approach is that it is limited in its scope of study. The range of the study can only include those parts of the hidden economy that utilize household electricity (Lacko 1999, p. 150). ==Criticisms== The primary criticism for the household electricity approach, as well as other electrical consumption approaches, centers around the assumptions made regarding the stability of the consistency of electrical consumption with GDP. Critics suggest that levels of stability can be altered significantly by the omission of such basic factors as shifts in the weather (Hanousek and Palda 2004, p. 14). The authors of electrical consumption approaches have admittedly been aware of the weakness of their assumptions and have made attempts to control for factors that would make electrical consumption inconsistent with GDP; however, critics do not see these attempts as being adequate enough (Hanousek and Palda 2006, p. 709). ==Sources== # # # # # # Category:Informal economy Category:Underground culture Category:Economic geography Category:Energy economics Category:Gross domestic product ","title":"Household electricity approach"},{"id":"11647748","text":"Specific may refer to: * Specificity (disambiguation) * Specific, a cure or therapy for a specific illness == Law == * Specific deterrence, focussed on an individual * Specific finding, intermediate verdict used by a jury in determining the final verdict * Specific jurisdiction over an out-of-state party, specific to cases that have a substantial connection to the party's in- state activity * Order of specific performance, court order to perform a specific act ;Economics, finance, and accounting: * Asset specificity, the extent to which the investments made to support a particular transaction have a higher value to that transaction than they would have if they were redeployed for any other purpose * Specific identification (inventories), summing purchase costs of all inventory items * Specific rate duty, duty paid at a specific amount per unit * Specific risk, risk that affects a very small number of assets == Psychology == * Domain specificity, theory that many aspects of cognition are supported by specialized, presumably evolutionarily specified, learning devices * Specific developmental disorder, disorders in which development is delayed in one specific area or areas, and in which basically all other areas of development are not affected * Specific learning disability * Specific phobia, phobia of a specific thing or situation ** Specific social phobia, triggered only by specific social situations == Biology == * Specific appetite, drive to eat foods with specific flavors or other characteristics * Specific granule, secretory vesicle in granulocytes * Specific immunity, to a particular pathogen * Specific name (botany), species name of a plant * Specific name (zoology), species name of an animal * Specific Pathogen Free, of a laboratory animal guaranteed free of particular (i.e., specific and named) pathogens == Physical natural sciences, including physiology, and engineering == * A specific quantity generally means a physical quantity normalized \\"per unit\\" of something (often mass). == Other fields == * SPECIFIC, The Sustainable Product Engineering Centre for Innovative Functional Industrial Coatings * Specific creation, creationism as opposed to evolution * Specific interval, shortest possible clockwise distance between pitch classes on the chromatic circle * Specific integral, in calculus, eliminates the constant of integration * Specific Physical Preparedness, being prepared for the movements in a specific physical activity (usually a sport) == See also == * Species (disambiguation) * Specification (disambiguation) * Specialty (disambiguation) * Site-specific (disambiguation) * Language for specific purposes, has been primarily used to refer to two areas within applied linguistics ","title":"Specific"},{"id":"11647750","text":"\\"Seattle Republican\\" newspaper, April 28, 1911.

He was not related to Washington's long-serving U.S. Senator Warren G. Magnuson. ==Early years== Magnuson was born on a farm near Freeman, in Spokane County, Washington, the son of Ellis William Magnuson and Ida (Hammer) Magnuson. He attended the public schools and Spokane University from 1926 to 1928, then transferred to the University of Washington in Seattle, and earned a bachelor's degree in 1931. After graduation, he worked as a harvester and then as a riveter in an aircraft factory.Donald H. Magnuson (Biographical Directory) ==Journalism career== Magnuson was a newspaper reporter for the Daily Olympian and Seattle Times from 1934 to 1952. In 1942, he wrote a series of reports about loafing in the Seattle-Tacoma Shipyards. He was instrumental in obtaining the pardon of Clarence Boggie, who was wrongly convicted of murder. He earned a Heywood Broun Award for his coverage and was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize in Local Reporting in 1949 by the managing editor of the Seattle Times. His work was made into a radio episode on a national radio show: The Big Story in February, 1949. At another time, his reporting engendered so much response that 21 year-old Joe Maish's death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment two minutes before he was to hang. In 1950, Magnuson wrote a series on alcoholism. He interviewed 6,000 men who had been treated over 15 years. He described the \\"conditioned-reflect treatment\\" which was intended to create an aversion to alcohol. This treatment was based on Pavlov's work on conditioned reflex. The treatment for alcoholism was for the staff at the sanitarium to give a patient alcohol and at the same time induce nausea with an additive. ==Political career== Magnuson was elected in 1952 as a Democrat to the Eighty-third Congress and was re-elected four times, serving from January 1953 until January 1963. Magnuson was named to the Committee on Merchant Marines and Fisheries in 1955.

The nationalists, identified as Lolita Lebr√≥n, Rafael Cancel Miranda, Andres Figueroa Cordero, and Irving Flores Rodr√≠guez, unfurled a Puerto Rican flag and began shooting at the 240 Representatives, who were debating an immigration bill. He was on the phone quickly after with the Seattle Times during the ruckus to give them the scoop, which later Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill recorded in a book of memoirs. In 1958, Rep. Magnuson escaped serious injury in a plane crash. He appeared in a newspaper photo, a hospital identification tag pinned to his blood spotted shirt, sitting in Northwestern Hospital, Minneapolis, where he was taken following the Northwest Airlines plane crash. Magnuson was one of 60 passengers who escaped death when the plane crashed into a corn field and burst into flames. His opponent for Congress that year complained about all of the sympathetic free publicity Magnuson received as a result of the incident. At least 11 U.S. Army service members were on board, and Rep. Magnuson recommended that Private First Class Raymond C. Maruschak receive the Soldier's Medal, and credited him with saving many lives that day. Maruschak and another soldier ripped a hole in the fuselage large enough to get all of the passengers out. On January 30, 1959, Magnuson introduced a bill to establish a shield law to keep reporters from having to reveal their sources. On February 2, 1959, he introduced a bill to grant a second income tax exemption to college students who held down a job. On February 7, 1959, he was named to the board of oversight of the U.S. Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs for 4 consecutive years. On May 22, 1959, Magnuson voted for an addition to the public works bill in an Appropriations subcommittee for $724,000 to start the Greater Wenatchee reclamation project. On August 4, 1959, Magnuson said about the upcoming Khrushchev visit, \\"What Khrushchev sees here may help guard against a fatal miscalculation on his part.\\"Congressman Don Magnuson and Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn discussing legislation in Speaker Rayburn's office, July 28, 1956.On January 21, 1960, the Bellingham Labor News said that as a member of the Public Works Committee, Magnuson sponsored a resolution to authorize the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to review flood control studies in western Washington. On that same day, he was appointed to become a charter member of the Democratic Study Group. In 1960, as a member of the Appropriations Committee, he voted against an additional $73 million for the development of nuclear airplanes, according to The Labor Journal. Following an extremely close victory in 1960, Magnuson lost his bid for a sixth term in 1962. He was employed by the Department of the Interior from 1963 to 1969, and by the Department of Labor from 1969 to 1973. ==Death and legacy== After he retired in 1973, he resided in Seattle, where he died on October 5, 1979, and was interred in Evergreen Washelli Memorial Park in north Seattle. His papers are housed at the University of Washington Libraries; the collection contains of legislative papers and 8 film strip reels relating to his various political campaigns. ==References== President Lyndon Johnson and Don Magnuson meet ca. 1964. ==External links== * Washington Secretary of State - History Makers - Donald Magnuson * Campaign photograph for Congressman Don Magnuson with his family.

This picture of Magnuson appeared in Newsweek with the caption: \\"I cry inside.\\" His work was made into a radio episode on a national radio show: The Big Story in February, 1949. At another time, his reporting engendered so much response that 21 year-old Joe Maish's death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment two minutes before he was to hang. Magnuson went on to serve 5 terms in the U.S. Congress.

A spacetime diagram is a graphical illustration of the properties of space and time in the special theory of relativity. Spacetime diagrams allow a qualitative understanding of the corresponding phenomena like time dilation and length contraction without mathematical equations. The history of an object's location throughout all time traces out a line, referred to as the object's world line, in a spacetime diagram. Points in spacetime diagrams represent a fixed position in space and time and are referred to as events. The most well-known class of spacetime diagrams are known as Minkowski diagrams, developed by Hermann Minkowski in 1908. Minkowski diagrams are two- dimensional graphs that depict events as happening in a universe consisting of one space dimension and one time dimension. Unlike a regular distance-time graph, the distance is displayed on the horizontal axis and time on the vertical axis. Additionally, the time and space units of measurement are chosen in such a way that an object moving at the speed of light is depicted as following a 45¬∞ angle to the diagram's axes. == Introduction to kinetic diagrams == === Position versus time graphs === thumb In the study of 1-dimensional kinematics, position vs. time graphs (also called distance vs. time graphs, or p-t graphs) provide a useful means to describe motion. The specific features of the motion of objects are demonstrated by the shape and the slope of the lines. In the accompanying figure, the plotted object moves away from the origin at a uniform speed of 1.66 m/s for six seconds, halts for five seconds, then returns to the origin over a period of seven seconds at a non-constant speed. At its most basic level, a spacetime diagram is merely a time vs position graph, with the directions of the axes in a usual p-t graph exchanged, that is, the vertical axis refers to temporal and the horizontal axis to spatial coordinate values. Especially when used in special relativity (SR), the temporal axes of a spacetime diagram are scaled with the speed of light , and thus are often labeled by This changes the dimension of the addressed physical quantity from to , in accordance to the dimension associated to the spatial axes, which are frequently labeled === Standard configuration of reference frames === Galilean diagram of two frames of reference in standard configuration. To ease insight in how spacetime coordinates, measured by observers in different reference frames, compare with each other, it is useful to work with a simplified setup. With care, this allows simplification of the math with no loss of generality in the conclusions that are reached. Setting the temporal component aside for the moment, two Galilean reference frames (i.e. conventional 3-space frames), S and S' (pronounced \\"S prime\\"), each with observers O and O' at rest in their respective frames, but measuring the other as moving with speeds ¬±v are said to be in standard configuration, when: * The x, y, z axes of frame S are oriented parallel to the respective primed axes of frame S‚Ä≤. * Frame S‚Ä≤ moves in the x-direction of frame S with a constant velocity v as measured in frame S. * The origins of frames S and S‚Ä≤ coincide for time t = 0 in frame S and t‚Ä≤ = 0 in frame S‚Ä≤. This spatial setting is displayed in the accompanying figure, in which the temporal coordinates are separately annotated as quantities t and t'. In a further step of simplification it is often possible to consider just the direction of the observed motion and ignore the other two spatial components, allowing x and ct to be plotted in 2-dimensional spacetime diagrams, as introduced above. === Non-relativistic \\"spacetime diagrams\\" === In Newtonian physics for both observers the event at A is assigned to the same point in time. The black axes labelled and on the adjoining diagram are the coordinate system of an observer, referred to as 'at rest', and who is positioned at . This observer's world line is identical with the time axis. Each parallel line to this axis would correspond also to an object at rest but at another position. The blue line describes an object moving with constant speed to the right, such as a moving observer. This blue line labelled may be interpreted as the time axis for the second observer. Together with the axis, which is identical for both observers, it represents their coordinate system. Since the reference frames are in standard configuration, both observers agree on the location of the origin of their coordinate systems. The axes for the moving observer are not perpendicular to each other and the scale on their time axis is stretched. To determine the coordinates of a certain event, two lines, each parallel to one of the two axes, must be constructed passing through the event, and their intersections with the axes read off. Determining position and time of the event A as an example in the diagram leads to the same time for both observers, as expected. Only for the position different values result, because the moving observer has approached the position of the event A since . Generally stated, all events on a line parallel to the axis happen simultaneously for both observers. There is only one universal time , modelling the existence of one common position axis. On the other hand, due to two different time axes the observers usually measure different coordinates for the same event. This graphical translation from and to and and vice versa is described mathematically by the so-called Galilean transformation. == Minkowski diagrams == === Overview === In the theory of relativity each observer assigns the event at A to a different time and location. Minkowski diagram for various speeds of the primed frame, which is moving relative to the unprimed frame. The dashed lines represent the light cone of a flash of light at the origin. The term Minkowski diagram refers to a specific form of spacetime diagram frequently used in special relativity. A Minkowski diagram is a two-dimensional graphical depiction of a portion of Minkowski space, usually where space has been curtailed to a single dimension. The units of measurement in these diagrams are taken such that the light cone at an event consists of the lines of slope plus or minus one through that event.Mermin (1968) Chapter 17 The horizontal lines correspond to the usual notion of simultaneous events for a stationary observer at the origin. A particular Minkowski diagram illustrates the result of a Lorentz transformation. The Lorentz transformation relates two inertial frames of reference, where an observer stationary at the event makes a change of velocity along the -axis. The new time axis of the observer forms an angle with the previous time axis, with . In the new frame of reference the simultaneous events lie parallel to a line inclined by to the previous lines of simultaneity. This is the new -axis. Both the original set of axes and the primed set of axes have the property that they are orthogonal with respect to the Minkowski inner product or relativistic dot product. Whatever the magnitude of , the line forms the universalSee Vladimir Karapetoff bisector. The space and time units of measurement on the axes may, for example, be taken as one of the following pairs: * Units of ~30 centimetres length and nanoseconds * Astronomical units and intervals of about 8 minutes and 19 seconds (499 seconds) * Light years and years * Light-second and second This way, light paths are represented by lines parallel to the bisector between the axes. === Mathematical details === The angle between the and axes will be identical with that between the time axes and . This follows from the second postulate of special relativity, which says that the speed of light is the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion (see below). The angle is given by Extract of page 93 :\\\\tan\\\\alpha=\\\\frac{v}{c}=\\\\beta. Different scales on the axes. The corresponding boost from and to and and vice versa is described mathematically by the Lorentz transformation, which can be written \\\\begin{align} ct' & = \\\\gamma (ct-\\\\beta x),\\\\\\\\\\\\ x' & = \\\\gamma (x-vt) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} where \\\\gamma = (1-\\\\beta^2)^{-1/2} is the Lorentz factor. By applying the Lorentz transformation, the spacetime axes obtained for a boosted frame will always correspond to conjugate diameters of a pair of hyperbolas. In a Minkowski diagram, the boosted and unboosted spacetime axes will in general have unequal unit lengths. If is the unit length on the axes of and respectively, the unit length on the axes of and is: :U'=U\\\\sqrt\\\\frac{1+\\\\beta^2}{1-\\\\beta^2}\\\\,. The -axis represents the worldline of a clock resting in , with representing the duration between two events happening on this worldline, also called the proper time between these events. Length upon the -axis represents the rest length or proper length of a rod resting in . The same interpretation can also be applied to distance upon the - and -axes for clocks and rods resting in . === History === Albert Einstein discovered special relativity in 1905,. See also: English translation. with Hermann Minkowski providing his graphical representation in 1908. :*Various English translations on Wikisource: Space and Time In Minkowski's 1908 paper there were three diagrams, first to illustrate the Lorentz transformation, then the partition of the plane by the light-cone, and finally illustration of worldlines. The first diagram used a branch of the unit hyperbola t^2 - x^2 = 1 to show the locus of a unit of proper time depending on velocity, thus illustrating time dilation. The second diagram showed the conjugate hyperbola to calibrate space, where a similar stretching leaves the impression of FitzGerald contraction. In 1914 Ludwik Silberstein included a diagram of \\"Minkowski‚Äôs representation of the Lorentz transformation\\". This diagram included the unit hyperbola, its conjugate, and a pair of conjugate diameters. Since the 1960s a version of this more complete configuration has been referred to as The Minkowski Diagram, and used as a standard illustration of the transformation geometry of special relativity. E. T. Whittaker has pointed out that the principle of relativity is tantamount to the arbitrariness of what hyperbola radius is selected for time in the Minkowski diagram. In 1912 Gilbert N. Lewis and Edwin B. Wilson applied the methods of synthetic geometry to develop the properties of the non-Euclidean plane that has Minkowski diagrams.Synthetic Spacetime, a digest of the axioms used, and theorems proved, by Wilson and Lewis. Archived by WebCite When Taylor and Wheeler composed Spacetime Physics (1966), they did not use the term \\"Minkowski diagram\\" for their spacetime geometry. Instead they included an acknowledgement of Minkowski's contribution to philosophy by the totality of his innovation of 1908. == Loedel diagrams == While a frame at rest in a Minkowski diagram has orthogonal spacetime axes, a frame moving relative to the rest frame in a Minkowski diagram has spacetime axes which form an acute angle. This asymmetry of Minkowski diagrams can be misleading, since special relativity postulates that any two inertial reference frames must be physically equivalent. The Loedel diagram is an alternative spacetime diagram that makes the symmetry of inertial references frames much more manifest. === Formulation via median frame === Several authors showed that there is a frame of reference between the resting and moving ones where their symmetry would be apparent (\\"median frame\\"). In this frame, the two other frames are moving in opposite directions with equal speed. Using such coordinates makes the units of length and time the same for both axes. If and is given between S and S^\\\\prime, then these expressions are connected with the values in their median frame S0 as follows: (Translation: The Lorentz‚ÄìEinstein transformation and the universal time of Ed. Guillaume) See [ Google books, p. 460] :\\\\begin{align} (1) & & \\\\beta & =\\\\frac{2\\\\beta_0}{1+{\\\\beta_0}^2},\\\\\\\\\\\\ (2) & & \\\\beta_{0} & =\\\\frac{\\\\gamma-1}{\\\\beta\\\\gamma}. \\\\end{align} For instance, if between S and S^\\\\prime, then by (2) they are moving in their median frame S0 with approximately each in opposite directions. On the other hand, if in S0, then by (1) the relative velocity between S and S^\\\\prime in their own rest frames is . The construction of the axes of S and S^\\\\prime is done in accordance with the ordinary method using with respect to the orthogonal axes of the median frame (Fig. 1). However, it turns out that when drawing such a symmetric diagram, it is possible to derive the diagram's relations even without mentioning the median frame and at all. Instead, the relative velocity between S and S^\\\\prime can directly be used in the following construction, providing the same result: If is the angle between the axes of and (or between and ), and between the axes of and , it is given: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\sin\\\\varphi=\\\\cos\\\\theta & =\\\\beta,\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cos\\\\varphi=\\\\sin\\\\theta & =\\\\frac{1}{\\\\gamma},\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\tan\\\\varphi=\\\\cot\\\\theta & =\\\\beta\\\\cdot\\\\gamma. \\\\end{align} Two methods of construction are obvious from Fig. 2: (a) The -axis is drawn perpendicular to the -axis, the and -axes are added at angle ; (b) the x‚Ä≤-axis is drawn at angle with respect to the -axis, the -axis is added perpendicular to the -axis and the -axis perpendicular to the -axis. In a Minkowski diagram, lengths on the page cannot be directly compared to each other, due to warping factor between the axes' unit lengths in a Minkowski diagram. In particular, if U and U^\\\\prime are the unit lengths of the rest frame axes and moving frame axes, respectively, in a Minkowski diagram, then the two unit lengths are warped relative to each other via the formula: \\\\begin{align} U^\\\\prime&=U\\\\sqrt\\\\frac{1+\\\\beta^2}{1-\\\\beta^2} \\\\end{align} By contrast, in a symmetric Loedel diagram, both the S and S^\\\\prime frame axes are warped by the same factor relative to the median frame and hence have identical unit lengths. This implies that, for a Loedel spacetime diagram, we can directly compare spacetime lengths between different frames as they appear on the page; no unit length scaling/conversion between frames is necessary due to the symmetric nature of the Loedel diagram. === History === *Max Born (1920) drew Minkowski diagrams by placing the -axis almost perpendicular to the -axis, as well as the -axis to the -axis, in order to demonstrate length contraction and time dilation in the symmetric case of two rods and two clocks moving in opposite direction. See also [ Reprint (2013) of third edition (1922) at Google books, p. 187] * Dmitry Mirimanoff (1921) showed that there is always a median frame with respect to two relatively moving frames, and derived the relations between them from the Lorentz transformation. However, he didn't give a graphical representation in a diagram. * Symmetric diagrams were systematically developed by Paul Gruner in collaboration with Josef Sauter in two papers in 1921. Relativistic effects such as length contraction and time dilation and some relations to covariant and contravariant vectors were demonstrated by them. (Translation: Elementary geometric representation of the formulas of the special theory of relativity) (Translation: An elementary geometrical representation of the transformation formulas of the special theory of relativity) Gruner extended this method in subsequent papers (1922-1924), and gave credit to Mirimanoff's treatment as well. (Translation: Graphical representation of the four-dimensional space-time universe) *The construction of symmetric Minkowski diagrams was later independently rediscovered by several authors. For instance, starting in 1948, Enrique Loedel Palumbo published a series of papers in Spanish language, presenting the details of such an approach.Fisica relativista, Kapelusz Editorial, Buenos Aires, Argentina (1955). In 1955, Henri Amar also published a paper presenting such relations, and gave credit to Loedel in a subsequent paper in 1957. Some authors of textbooks use symmetric Minkowski diagrams, denoting as Loedel diagrams. == Relativistic phenomena in diagrams == === Time dilation === Relativistic time dilation, as depicted in two Loedel spacetime diagrams. Both observers consider the clock of the other as running slower. Relativistic time dilation, as depicted in a single Loedel spacetime diagram. Both observers consider the clock of the other as running slower. Relativistic time dilation refers to the fact that a clock (indicating its proper time in its rest frame) that moves relative to an observer is observed to run slower. The situation is depicted in symmetric Loedel diagrams to the right. Note that we can compare spacetime lengths on page directly with each other, due to the symmetric nature of the Loedel diagram. The observer whose reference frame is given by the black axes is assumed to move from the origin O towards A. The moving clock has the reference frame given by the blue axes and moves from O to B. For the black observer, all events happening simultaneously with the event at A are located on a straight line parallel to its space axis. This line passes through A and B, so A and B are simultaneous from the reference frame of the observer with black axes. However, the clock that is moving relative to the black observer marks off time along the blue time axis. This is represented by the distance from O to B. Therefore, the observer at A with the black axes notices their clock as reading the distance from O to A while they observe the clock moving relative him or her to read the distance from O to B. Due to the distance from O to B being smaller than the distance from O to A, they conclude that the time passed on the clock moving relative to them is smaller than that passed on their own clock. A second observer, having moved together with the clock from O to B, will argue that the other clock has reached only C until this moment and therefore this clock runs slower. The reason for these apparently paradoxical statements is the different determination of the events happening synchronously at different locations. Due to the principle of relativity, the question of who is right has no answer and does not make sense. === Length contraction === Relativistic length contraction, as depicted in two Loedel spacetime diagrams. Both observers consider objects moving with the other observer as being shorter. Relativistic length contraction, as depicted in a single Loedel spacetime diagram. Both observers consider objects moving with the other observer as being shorter. Relativistic length contraction refers to the fact that a ruler (indicating its proper length in its rest frame) that moves relative to an observer is observed to contract/shorten. The situation is depicted in symmetric Loedel diagrams to the right. Note that we can compare spacetime lengths on page directly with each other, due to the symmetric nature of the Loedel diagram. The observer is assumed again to move along the -axis. The world lines of the endpoints of an object moving relative to him are assumed to move along the -axis and the parallel line passing through A and B. For this observer the endpoints of the object at are O and A. For a second observer moving together with the object, so that for him the object is at rest, it has the proper length OB at . Due to . the object is contracted for the first observer. The second observer will argue that the first observer has evaluated the endpoints of the object at O and A respectively and therefore at different times, leading to a wrong result due to his motion in the meantime. If the second observer investigates the length of another object with endpoints moving along the -axis and a parallel line passing through C and D he concludes the same way this object to be contracted from OD to OC. Each observer estimates objects moving with the other observer to be contracted. This apparently paradoxical situation is again a consequence of the relativity of simultaneity as demonstrated by the analysis via Minkowski diagram. For all these considerations it was assumed, that both observers take into account the speed of light and their distance to all events they see in order to determine the actual times at which these events happen from their point of view. === Constancy of the speed of light === Minkowski diagram for 3 coordinate systems. For the speeds relative to the system in black and holds. Another postulate of special relativity is the constancy of the speed of light. It says that any observer in an inertial reference frame measuring the vacuum speed of light relative to themself obtains the same value regardless of his own motion and that of the light source. This statement seems to be paradoxical, but it follows immediately from the differential equation yielding this, and the Minkowski diagram agrees. It explains also the result of the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment which was considered to be a mystery before the theory of relativity was discovered, when photons were thought to be waves through an undetectable medium. For world lines of photons passing the origin in different directions and holds. That means any position on such a world line corresponds with steps on - and -axes of equal absolute value. From the rule for reading off coordinates in coordinate system with tilted axes follows that the two world lines are the angle bisectors of the - and -axes. The Minkowski diagram shows, that they are angle bisectors of the - and -axes as well. That means both observers measure the same speed for both photons. Further coordinate systems corresponding to observers with arbitrary velocities can be added to this Minkowski diagram. For all these systems both photon world lines represent the angle bisectors of the axes. The more the relative speed approaches the speed of light the more the axes approach the corresponding angle bisector. The x axis is always more flat and the time axis more steep than the photon world lines. The scales on both axes are always identical, but usually different from those of the other coordinate systems. === Speed of light and causality === Past and future relative to the origin. For the grey areas a corresponding temporal classification is not possible. Straight lines passing the origin which are steeper than both photon world lines correspond with objects moving more slowly than the speed of light. If this applies to an object, then it applies from the viewpoint of all observers, because the world lines of these photons are the angle bisectors for any inertial reference frame. Therefore, any point above the origin and between the world lines of both photons can be reached with a speed smaller than that of the light and can have a cause-and-effect relationship with the origin. This area is the absolute future, because any event there happens later compared to the event represented by the origin regardless of the observer, which is obvious graphically from the Minkowski diagram. Following the same argument the range below the origin and between the photon world lines is the absolute past relative to the origin. Any event there belongs definitely to the past and can be the cause of an effect at the origin. The relationship between any such pairs of event is called timelike, because they have a time distance greater than zero for all observers. A straight line connecting these two events is always the time axis of a possible observer for whom they happen at the same place. Two events which can be connected just with the speed of light are called lightlike. In principle a further dimension of space can be added to the Minkowski diagram leading to a three-dimensional representation. In this case the ranges of future and past become cones with apexes touching each other at the origin. They are called light cones. === The speed of light as a limit === Sending a message at superluminal speed from O via A to B into the past. Both observers consider the temporal order of the pairs of events O and A as well as A and B different. Following the same argument, all straight lines passing through the origin and which are more nearly horizontal than the photon world lines, would correspond to objects or signals moving faster than light regardless of the speed of the observer. Therefore, no event outside the light cones can be reached from the origin, even by a light-signal, nor by any object or signal moving with less than the speed of light. Such pairs of events are called spacelike because they have a finite spatial distance different from zero for all observers. On the other hand, a straight line connecting such events is always the space coordinate axis of a possible observer for whom they happen at the same time. By a slight variation of the velocity of this coordinate system in both directions it is always possible to find two inertial reference frames whose observers estimate the chronological order of these events to be different. Therefore, an object moving faster than light, say from O to A in the adjoining diagram, would imply that, for any observer watching the object moving from O to A, another observer can be found (moving at less than the speed of light with respect to the first) for whom the object moves from A to O. The question of which observer is right has no unique answer, and therefore makes no physical sense. Any such moving object or signal would violate the principle of causality. Also, any general technical means of sending signals faster than light would permit information to be sent into the originator's own past. In the diagram, an observer at O in the system sends a message moving faster than light to A. At A, it is received by another observer, moving so as to be in the system, who sends it back, again faster than light, arriving at B. But B is in the past relative to O. The absurdity of this process becomes obvious when both observers subsequently confirm that they received no message at all, but all messages were directed towards the other observer as can be seen graphically in the Minkowski diagram. Furthermore, if it were possible to accelerate an observer to the speed of light, their space and time axes would coincide with their angle bisector. The coordinate system would collapse, in concordance with the fact that due to time dilation, time would effectively stop passing for them. These considerations show that the speed of light as a limit is a consequence of the properties of spacetime, and not of the properties of objects such as technologically imperfect space ships. The prohibition of faster-than-light motion, therefore, has nothing in particular to do with electromagnetic waves or light, but comes as a consequence of the structure of spacetime. ==Accelerating observers== The momentarily co-moving inertial frames along the world line of a rapidly accelerating observer (center). In the animation to the right, the vertical direction indicates time while the horizontal indicates distance. The dashed line is the world line of an accelerating observer, and the small dots are specific events in spacetime. If one imagines each event to be the flashing of a light, then the events that pass the two diagonal lines in the bottom half of the image (the past light cone of the observer in the origin) are the events visible to the observer. The slope of the world line (deviation from being vertical) gives the relative velocity to the observer. Note how the momentarily co-moving inertial frame changes when the observer accelerates. == See also == * Minkowski space * Penrose diagram * Rapidity ==References== * Anthony French (1968) Special Relativity, pages 82 & 83, New York: W W Norton & Company. * E.N.

He ended his professional career at Southern Illinois University, with a focus on graduate studies and sociological research based on trips to the remote South Atlantic island Tristan da Cunha. ==Biography== Peter Andreas Munch was born December 19, 1908, at Nes in Hedmark, Norway. He studied theology at the University of Oslo receiving a Candidatus theologi√¶ degree in 1932. He then completed linguistic studies at the University of Oxford in order to read ancient religious texts, continuing in 1935 with a period at the University of Wittenberg in Halle, Germany, studying social history in the Ancient Near East. This resulted in numerous publications written in Norwegian, English, and German regarding original Hebrew Old Testament texts and their meaning in the modern world. During 1937 and 1938, he was a member of the Norwegian Scientific Expedition to Tristan da Cunha, where he studied social interaction among the isolated population as a humanist and social scholar. This work was the subject of his doctoral dissertation, finished in 1943 but hidden when he was imprisoned by the German occupation forces at Grini detention camp. In 1946, when the University in Oslo was reopened after World War II, he successfully defended the dissertation titled Sociology of Tristan da Cunha based on the Gemeinschaft concepts introduced by Ferdinand T√∂nnies, and obtained the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. Munch immigrated to the United States in 1948 as a research associate in Rural Sociology at the University of Wisconsin, taking a position as Associate Professor at St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota, in 1949. In 1951 he became Head of the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks, a position held until he was called to be Professor of Sociology, and later Director of Graduate Studies in Sociology, at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale in 1957. Munch worked there until his retirement in 1977, mainly in the fields of cultural anthropology, rural, and maritime sociology. The experience that more than any other defined Munch's career was his reestablished connection with the islanders of Tristan da Cunha. In 1961, a volcanic eruption on the remote island forced evacuation of the entire population, never before exposed to modern life, to an abandoned Royal Air Force base in southern England. Munch quickly applied for research grants to visit the evacuees and to study their adaptation to modern European life. He found that most islanders were unhappy in their new homes and was relieved when the British government agreed to finance the resettlement of Tristan da Cunha in 1963, when the volcano was again dormant. More grants enabled Munch to visit the islanders on Tristan in 1964-1965 for additional research; a visit that resulted in lectures, books, and articles contributing to our understanding of anarchy,Munch, Peter A., Culture and Superculture in a Displaced Community: Tristan da Cunha, Ethnology 3, 1964, pp. 369-376.Munch, Peter A., Anarchy and Anomie in an Atomistic Community, Man 9/2 (September 1974), pp. 243-261. atomism,Munch, Peter A. and Charles Marske, Atomism and Social Integration, Journal of Anthropological Research, 37/2, 1981. acculturation in social systems,Munch, Peter A., Social Class and Acculturation, in The Strange American Way, Peter A. Munch and Helene Munch (eds.) Southern Illinois Press, 1970 and to our general knowledge of community and social values. From 1960 until 1964, he was editor of The Sociological Quarterly. He belonged to numerous professional organizations, serving as officer of the Midwest Sociological Society, Illinois Folklore Society, and the Norwegian-American Historical Association. Munch authored several books and more than 80 articles and chapters in professional publications. He was elected to the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters in 1983.

It was the first time the Cup was solely contested by National Hockey League teams, owing to the demise of the Western Hockey League the previous year. It was won by the Ottawa Senators, coached by Dave Gill, over the Boston Bruins, coached by Art Ross. This was the Senators' fourth win since 1920, and eleventh overall, but it marked the end of the dynasty. The original Senators would not win another. It would be the last time a team from Ottawa would play in the Finals until the 2007 Stanley Cup Finals, and the first Stanley Cup Final to have games played in both Canada and the United States. ==Game summaries== The Stanley Cup Final was originally intended to be a best-of- three series. After the first game was declared a draw, NHL President Calder ruled that the series would go no more than five games, with overtimes limited to 20 minutes. If the teams were tied after five games, the teams would share the championship. In the end, the series went four games because of two ties. These were the last ties in Stanley Cup history, notwithstanding the unfinished 3‚Äì3 Stanley Cup final match between Edmonton and Boston on May 24, 1988. Ottawa's Frank Nighbor was playing in his sixth Stanley Cup series, while Boston's Sprague Cleghorn and Billy Coutu were playing in their fifth Stanley Cup series. Rough play marred the series: in the final game, Lionel Hitchman and George Boucher were ejected for a wild fight which Ottawa police had to break up. Hooley Smith butt-ended Boston's Harry Oliver, and Eddie Shore fought with Smith in retaliation; both Smith and Shore were ejected. After the game, Billy Coutu assaulted referee Jerry Laflamme, tackled referee Billy Bell and started a bench-clearing brawl. Coutu was barred from the league for life, Smith was given a one-month suspension effective in the 1927‚Äì28 season, while Boucher, Hitchman and Jimmy Herbert were all fined. The April 13, 1927, game at the Ottawa Auditorium was the last Stanley Cup Final game in Ottawa until the June 2, 2007, game played at Scotiabank Place between the current Senators and the Anaheim Ducks. It is known that one fan, Russell Williams, attended both games, 80 years apart, both games won by Ottawa. ;Game one The first game ended in a scoreless draw after two ten-minute overtime periods. In the overtime, the condition of the ice became unplayable and NHL President Frank Calder called the game. There were two disallowed goals, one by each team, and both disallowed by off-sides. Before the next game, Calder decided that the series would play to five games if necessary. If after the five games, the teams were tied, that the teams would share the Stanley Cup honours. Calder also ruled that overtimes would be limited to 20 minutes. ;Game two In the second game, the Senators changed their tactics, going on the offensive. King Clancy and Cy Denneny scored in the first period for Ottawa. The Senators played a defensive game in the second period. In the third period, Harry Oliver scored for the Bruins on a goal-mouth scramble to bring the Bruins within one. In the final minute, with the Bruins pressing, Denneny scored again to put the game beyond doubt. ;Game three The series switched to Ottawa. The Bruins took the early lead. Jimmy \\"Sailor\\" Herbert broke in on a pass from Harry Oliver and beat Alex Connell in the Ottawa net at 7:14 of the first period. In the second, the Senators picked up the pace and Denneny scored at 15:15 on a pass from Clancy to tie the score. Neither team could break the tie in the third period or the two overtimes. The result meant that Ottawa could win the series with a win in game four, making game five unnecessary. A Boston win would send the series to a game five. ;Game four The Senators decided to start two players who had been substitutes in the previous games, Frank Finnigan and Hec Kilrea and the moves were a success. The Senators came out on the offensive and took a 2‚Äì0 lead in the first period on goals by Finnigan and Denneny. Denneny scored again in the third period to put the Senators ahead 3‚Äì0. The game degenerated after that. Lionel Hitchman and George Boucher fought, with Eddie Shore jumping in. Ottawa police jumped onto the ice to help the referees and Hitchman and Boucher were ejected. Oliver scored with six minutes to play. Ottawa's Hooley Smith butt-ended Oliver in the face with a minute to play. Shore jumped in to fight Smith and the two were ejected. After the game Coutu attacked referee Laflamme on his way to the dressing room. ==Stanley Cup engraving== The 1927 Stanley Cup was presented to Senators captain George Boucher by NHL President Frank Calder following the Senators 3‚Äì1 win over the Bruins in game four. The following Senators players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup Team photograph. Trophies won: Stanley Cup, O'Brien Cup, Prince of Wales Trophy. With the win Hooley Smith became the fourth player to have won Olympic gold and the Stanley Cup. Smith had won the gold medal at the 1924 Olympics with the Toronto Granites. 1927 Ottawa Senators ==See also== *1926‚Äì27 NHL season ==References== * * * ;Notes Stanley Cup Category:Stanley Cup Finals Category:Boston Bruins games Category:Ottawa Senators (original) games Category:April 1927 sports events Category:Sports competitions in Ottawa Category:Sports competitions in Boston Category:1927 in sports in Massachusetts Category:1927 in Ontario Category:1920s in Boston Category:1920s in Ottawa ","title":"1927 Stanley Cup Finals"},{"id":"11647958","text":"Engraving of Wynee, a Native of Owyhee, one of the Sandwich Islands by a member of John Meares's crew Engraving of Tianna, a Prince of Atooi, who traveled with Wynee during the last leg of her journey home and was beside her at her death Wynee, also spelled Winee or Win√©e was the first Native Hawaiian from the Hawaiian Islands to travel abroad on a Western ship. She traveled to British Columbia and China before dying on the voyage home to Hawaii. ==Biography== Wynee was originally from the island of Hawaii, known as Owyhee by European explorers at the time. In 1787, she became the first Native Hawaiian to sail abroad with a Western ship when she was hired as the servant or maid of Frances Hornsby Trevor Barkley, the wife of Captain Charles William Barkley, on the British ship Imperial Eagle. Barkley recorded her name as Wynee which was possibly an attempted spelling of wahine, the Hawaiian word for woman. She traveled to the Pacific Northwest and later to China. The Barkleys intended to take her back to Europe but Wynee requested to return home and so she was left in the Portuguese colony of Macao. At Canton, she arranged to return to Hawaii aboard Captain John Meares's ship Felice Adventurero with fellow Hawaiian \\"Tianna\\" (Ka ªiana ‚Äì also spelled Tyaana & Tyanna), a member of the ali ªi (high chief) class from the island of Kauai. Traveling with them were two other Hawaiians: a stout man and a boy from Maui but they are not specifically named. She died of illness on the voyage home on February 5, 1788. Tianna, who remained by her bedside caring for her, contracted a fever as well. He reportedly became seriously distraught upon learning of her death, although he would recover and arrive back home. Wynee bequeathed to him some trade articles she had acquired and asked him to deliver her remaining possessions to her father and mother; these items included mirrors, porcelain, Western clothing and other items she collected during her travel. She was buried at sea. Shortly after describing her last moments, Captain Meares wrote: > Thus died Winee, a native of Owhyhee, one of the Sandwich Islands, who > possessed virtues that are seldom to be found in the class of her > countrywomen to which she belonged, and a portion of understanding that was > not be expected in a rude and uncultivated mind.

The league is open to all skill levels and abilities, and to all people regardless of race, religion, age, race, religion, gender expression or sexual orientation. The league plays its regular season from late April through early August and holds its playoffs in August. Teams from this league also compete in tournaments in the US and Canada, including the NAGAAA's Gay World Series. ==History== The league was founded in 1977 as The Manhattan Community Athletic Association (MCAA). In its first season the league consisted of 12 teams. The winner that season was the Ramrod Bar and Grill team. The Ramrod team flew to San Francisco to take on the Badlands of the San Francisco Community Softball League to play in the first Gay World Series in front of a crowd as large as 5,000 people. Badlands defeated Ramrod, two games to none. In 1980, the league changed its name to its current name. At this point in the league's history, there were 16 teams. In 1981, the league moved to an arc pitch style of softball play to conform to the North American Gay Amateur Athletic Alliance (NAGAAA). In 1994, the league hosted the Play for Life tournament on the 4th of July Weekend, a benefit for HIV research. In 2007, the league celebrated its 30th season of play and is made up of 39 teams, spread across 5 divisions by skill level. In 2009, BASL introduced the Women+ Division, which has now blossomed into two divisions, Mousseau (named after Jody Mousseau - longtime player and board member) and Green-Batten (named after Cynthia Green and Scott Batten - who both helped in the development of all-female teams prior to the creation of the Women's Division). ==Participation at the NAGAAA & ASANA World Series== In 1977, the bar owner of the San Francisco Badlands Bar together with BASL Founder Chuck Dima and other NY bar owners arranged to send the New York Ramrod team to San Francisco to play a three-game series at James P. Lang Field in what was called, and what has now become, the first Gay World Series. The Big Apple Softball League has also had a great deal of history with the tournament. In 1984, The New York Falcons were disqualified by the NAGAAA for having a straight-identified player on the team. The NAGAAA stated, at that time, that the tournament was for LGBTQ players only. This squabble at the World Series was noted in an article in the LGBT newsmagazine The Advocate. The next year, the NAGAAA changed its rules to allow straight-identified players. The league hosted the 1986 World Series and has had a great deal of success at the tournament. In 29 NAGAAA Tournaments, The BASL has earned 3 wins and several overall Top 5 finishes. ==League Events== Big Apple Softball is a Social League and hosts several events and fundraisers throughout the year. Their league-wide events are their HoliGay Party, All-Star Game, Opening Party and Closing Party. They also host several smaller, team or division-wide events that are more popular throughout the playing season. Teams also travel to tournaments throughout the country including traveling to Las Vegas, Orlando, Kansas City, Austin, Philadelphia, Boston & Providence, Rhode Island. ==The league today== The league currently hosts two playing seasons. A shortened Fall Season that has two divisions and a longer Spring season that has over 30 teams in over 5 divisions, sectioned off by gender-identity and desired competition level. Almost all the teams in the league are now sponsored by at least one organization such as a local business or bar. Some sponsors include Boxers bar, GYM Sportsbar, Dive Bar & Prudential Insurance. ==References== * About the Big Apple Softball League * Big Apple Softball League History ==External links== *Big Apple Softball League ‚Äî official website Category:LGBT sports organizations in the United States Category:Softball competitions ","title":"Big Apple Softball League"},{"id":"11648127","text":"Vallalar Nagar is a neighbourhood in Chennai, India.

The bee-eater is a migratory species, spending the breeding season, between August and November, in Zimbabwe and Zambia, before moving as south as South Africa for the summer months, and then migrating to Equatorial Africa from March to August. ==Diet and foraging== Their diet is made up primarily of bees and other flying insects, and their major hunting strategy involves hawking flying insects from perch. Perches may include branches of vegetation or even the backs of large animals, such as the kori bustard. They are attracted to wildfires because of the flushed insects, and are often seen circling high in the air. They circle larger animals and even cars to catch the insects that are trying to escape. ==Habitat and breeding== Its usual habitat included low-altitude river valleys and floodplains, preferring vertical banks suitable for tunneling when breeding, but readily digging vertical burrows in the level surface of small salt islands. This is a highly sociable species, gathering in large flocks, in or out of breeding season. They roost communally in trees or reedbeds, and disperse widely during the day. Nesting is at the end of a 1 to 2 meter long burrow in an earthen bank, where they lay from 2 to 5 eggs. ==Gallery== Southern carmine bee-eater, Merops nubicoides, Chobe National Park, Botswana (31649416003).jpg|Roosting in Phragmites reedbed Kori Bustard (Ardeotis kori) and Southern Carmine Bee-eater (Merops nubicoides) (6021439753).jpg|Hunting over a kori bustard Southern Carmine Bee-eater (Merops nubicoides) hunting over Southern Ground Hornbills (Bucorvus leadbeateri) (17354924075).jpg|Hunting over a pair of ground hornbills Southern carmine bee-eater, Merops nubicoides, Savuti marsh, Chobe National Park, Botswana (32462175975).jpg|Adult with juvenile Southern carmine bee-eater, Merops nubicoides, Savuti marsh, Chobe National Park, Botswana (32462176535).jpg|Juvenile plumage Southern carmine bee-eater, Merops nubicoides, Savuti marsh, Chobe National Park, Botswana (31650329123).jpg|Juvenile with Belonogaster wasp prey ==References== *Roberts' Birds of Southern Africa - 6th edition (John Voelcker Fund, 1993) ==External links== *(Southern) Carmine Bee-eater - Species text in The Atlas of Southern African Birds. southern carmine bee-eater Category:Birds of Sub- Saharan Africa southern carmine bee-eater ","title":"Southern carmine bee-eater"},{"id":"11648149","text":"Frederick Hotham Andrus (August 23, 1850 ‚Äì November 10, 1937) was an outfielder and pitcher in Major League Baseball for the Chicago White Stockings.

The species is endemic to northeastern Asia. It was formerly placed in the genus Bufo, then for a few years in Pseudepidalea until finally moved to its own genus Strauchbufo. ==Etymology== The specific name, raddei, is in honor of German naturalist Gustav Radde.Beolens,Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2013). The Eponym Dictionary of Amphibians. Exeter, England: Pelagic Publishing Ltd. xiii + 262 pp. . (Pseudepidalea raddei, p. 175). ==Geographic range== S. raddei ranges through much of northern China, Mongolia, and the Russian Far East, and is also found in North Korea. It is particularly common in the Amur River basin of China and Russia. ==Description== The Mongolian toad is relatively small, with adults not exceeding a snout-to-vent length (SVL) of . ==Habitat== S. raddei ranges through a wide range of habitats and is often found in dry regions, preferring sandy soil. It was first described based on specimens from the Alashan desert. The species does not occur above , nor below . The northernmost population is found on Olkhon Island in Russia's Lake Baikal. ==Reproduction== The mating season of S. raddei occurs between March and July, depending on the local climate. Eggs are typically laid in shallow puddles, leading to the death of many tadpoles as the puddles dry up. The Mongolian toad hibernates in the ground, usually in groups, in holes up to deep. ==Diet== When adult, the Mongolian toad favours ants as food, particularly in arid regions. It also eats spiders and beetles. ==Taxonomy== The Mongolian toad was classified as Bufo raddei prior to the 2006 definition of the genus Pseudepidalea. (Pseudepidalea raddei, new combination). In 2010, it was shown that Pseudepidalea is a junior synonym of Bufotes.

It is not constructed explicitly for use with either ICD-10 or DSM-IV but can be used for both systems. The SCAN system was originally called PSE, or Present State Examination, but since version 10 (PSE-10), the commonly accepted name has been SCAN. The current version of SCAN is 2.1. ==Interview items== The entire SCAN interview consists of 1,872 items, spread out over 28 sections. Most patients, however, will only need parts of the interview, and it is assessed in the beginning of each section if the section is actually relevant. The sections are as follows: ===Section 0 - Face sheet and sociodemographic items=== The first section in the SCAN interview is concerned with sociodemographic items such as age, gender, education, etc. ===Section 1 - Beginning the Interview=== In section 1 (the second section), the interviewer starts to ask the respondent or patient about what kinds of symptoms has been experienced. This section is not used in diagnosis, but it is intended as a help for the interviewer to determine which items in the interview to emphasize on. As such, it is a screening tool for part 1 of the interview (sections 2 to 13). ===Section 2 - Somatoform and dissociative symptoms=== Section 2 is primarily centered on somatoform and dissociative symptoms and is rated both by using direct questions and by observing the patient. ===Section 3 - Worrying, tension, etc.=== Section 3 explores the degree of worrying and tension in the patient, by direct questions about feelings of worrying, nervous tension, muscular tension, fatiguability, noise sensitivity, etc. ===Section 4 - Panic, Anxiety and phobias=== Section 4 measures the degree and physiological reactions associated with potential anxiety attacks and phobias, including behaviour in which situations are avoided due to phobias. Fear of dying and generalized anxiety disorder are also measured. ===Section 5 - Obsessional symptoms=== Section 5 explores, by direct questions, whether the respondent experiences behaviour characteristic of OCD. ===Section 6 - Depressed mood and ideation=== Section 6 measures, by direct questions, whether the respondent is depressed, by items relating to feeling low, uncontrolled crying, anhedonia, loss of feeling, suicidal tendencies, social withdrawal, insomnia or hypersomnia, dysthymia, etc. ===Section 7 - Thinking, concentration, energy, interest=== Section 7 measures cognitive functioning through direct questions about concentration, loss of interests or drive, and being overwhelmed by everyday tasks. ===Section 8 - Bodily functions=== Section 8 asks direct questions about weight and weight gain or loss, appetite, sleep patterns, and libido. ===Section 9 - Eating disorders=== Section 9 aims to diagnose eating disorders such as bulimia and anorexia nervosa. ===Section 10 - Expansive mood and ideation=== Section 10 measures whether the respondent experiences euphoria or abnormally elevated mood (mania), which can be used in diagnosing, for instance, bipolar disorders. ===Section 11 - Use of alcohol=== Section 11 measures, through direct questions, amounts of alcoholic beverages consumed and social, legal, physical, and other problems related to alcohol use. ===Section 12 - Use of psychoactive substances other than alcohol=== Section 12 measures, again through direct questions, the same as section 11, only relating to prescription drugs, illicit drugs, and nicotine. ===Section 13 - Interference and attributions for part one=== This section is rated by the interviewer based on the clinical picture of the interview and the patient in general, and is thus not completed by using direct questions. ===Section 14 - Screen for items in part two=== Just like section 1, section 14 is used for screening the existence of symptoms, in this case for part 2 of the SCAN interview which focuses on psychotic symptoms. ===Section 15 - Language problems at examination=== In this section, the interviewer rates the existence of any language problems that makes conducting the interview impossible. Many of the other sections provide options for rating that assessment of individual items is impossible because of the presence of language problems recorded in section 15. ===Section 16 - Perceptual disorders other than hallucinations=== Section 16 measures, through direct questions, whether non-hallucinatory perceptual disorders are present. These may present themselves by the respondents stating to have experiences of their surroundings being distorted, or unreal (derealization), or that they themselves are not real, but more like characters in a play (depersonalization). Experiences such as believing that one's reflection is unrecognizable, or that one's appearance has been changed, are also rated here. ===Section 17 - Hallucinations=== In this section, the respondent is asked about the experience of hallucinations, be they visual, auditory (verbal or non-verbal), olfactory, tactile, or sexual. ===Section 18 - Experiences of thought interference and replacement of will=== Section 18 measures the existence and type of thought interference. These include the respondents' thoughts being read, loud (i.e. having voice-like sound), echoing, being broadcast, or even stolen. Experiences of thought being inserted into the respondents' minds are also rated here, as is the experience of thought stopping, involuntarily, as suddenly as a TV becoming unplugged. Alternate lines of thought, that don't belong to the respondent but that comment on the respondents thoughts, are rated as well. So is the experience of external forces (e.g. other people) controlling the respondents' will, voice, handwriting, actions, or affect. ===Section 19 - Delusions=== Delusions of being spied upon, and other paranoid delusions, are rated by direct questions in this section. Other types of delusions covered in this section include others not being who they claim to be, that people close to the respondent have been replaced with lookalikes, and delusions of conspiracy. Furthermore, hypochondrial delusions, and grandiose delusions, etc., are rated by the interviewer. ===Section 20 - Further information for classification of Part 2 symptoms=== This section is fully rated by the interviewer after the interview, and deals with aspects of duration and course of schizophrenia and psychosis and other symptoms rated in part 2 of the SCAN interview. ===Section 21 - Cognitive impairment and decline=== This section consists of a series of tests to be conducted by the respondent to establish the presence of cognitive impairment such as dementia. The majority of the section consists of a Mini- Mental State Examination (MMSE). This includes testing the respondents' ability to know where they are, what the date and year is, to remember words, to follow instructions, attention, and concentration. ===Section 22 - Motor and behavioral items=== This section is rated by the interviewer based on observing the respondents, or consulting their medical charts. A variety of items are assessed, including underactivity, stupor, distractibility, agitation, ambitendence, echopraxia, embarrassing or bizarre behavior, histrionic behavior, self injury, hoarding of objects, and a variety of negative symptoms. == See also == * Diagnostic classification and rating scales used in psychiatry ==References== * Wing, J. \\"SCAN and the PSE tradition.\\" Soc.Psychiatry Psychiatr.Epidemiol. 31.2 (1996): 50‚Äì54. * Wing, J.

Both albums explored a variety of genres fused with the bands Celtic fusion sound, including funk, jazz, electronica and world. Both albums were critical successes and with a firm fan base, the band set to record their fifth album for release in 2007 with the addition of Graeme Stafford, the band's new keyboard player. The album was recorded at Skye Recording in Roag on the band's native Isle of Skye in 2007. The band's traditional production duo of Calum MacLean and the band's percussionist Iain Copeland returned to produce the album, whilst Skye Recording's Dennis Blackham mastered the album.What Men Deserve to Lose liner notes. ==Music== The band took inspiration from their Skye surroundings. For What Men Deserve to Loose, the band took inspiration \\"from their surroundings in Skye, people they had met and places they visited over the couple of years\\" prior to making the album. The band said they were trying to bring a \\"fresh edge to the established Peatbog sound\\". Stafford brings what the band described as a \\"contemporary dancey feel\\" to the album, whilst the \\"great addition\\" of the band's brass section, The Wayward Boys, return from Croftwork and were announced as being a \\"now established\\" part of the band's sound. The whistles that Morrison plays on the album are Overton whitles by Colin Goldie, Sinclair/Strathmore highliand pipes, Garvie border pipes by Nigel Richard and small pipes by Hamish Moore, whilst Innes plays Fylde guitars, G&L; and Musicman basses. The album was characterised as showing the band move \\"out further into the big, blue beyond, still latching on to island roots yet in a mood of glorious experiment.\\" It is comparable to dance music due to its driving rhythms, whilst the band's brass section, the Wayward Boys, are given more prominence than on Croftwork. The variety in the album's usage of keyboards was noted by critics, as was its jazz-influenced percussion; one reviewer observed \\"some brilliantly worked introductions\\" and multiple instances of \\"lead instruments changing within tracks.\\" The reviewer noted that \\"there‚Äôs even a hint of vocals if you listen carefully.\\" The opening track, \\"The Locks & Rocks Reel\\", gets its name from a near disastrous boat trip in Sweden from band member Peter Morrison, who wrote the track. \\"Jason's Famous Banjo\\" is named after the band's producer Calum MacLean whose stage name is Jason Famous, and when band member Innes travelled to the Staten Island, New York City to buy him a banjo. The title of the track \\"There's a Girl Behind the Bar Who Think She's Garbo\\", which mentions iconic Swedish film actress Garbo, is believed to be a reference to Kirsty MacColl's first hit \\"There's a Guy Works Down the Chip Shop Swears He's Elvis\\" from 1981. The track is dedicated to, as the liner notes describe, \\"all those barmaids in New York City who tell you they're an actress while chatting you up for tips\\". The track features samples of New York City traffic in its intro and outro. \\"Friend of Crazy Joe\\" is dedicated to Glasgow promoter Billy Kelly who died during the recording of the album. He worked with the band during their 2005 trio to Sydney where they became good friends. The title itself refers to the band's driver, a man of Italian descent made up a fictitious Scottish friend named Crazy Joe. \\"Ramsaig\\" is named after a picturesque site of a cleared village near Dunvegan where Morrison's grandparents lived as shepherds, whilst the title of album closer \\"Nyup\\" is described in the liner notes as \\"a fun word to pepper your conversation with. Repeat as necessary.\\" Guest musician John Disco plays additional guitar on the track. ==Release and reception== The album was announced in 2007 by the band's website. Their third album on their own label Peatbog Records, it was first released on 22 June 2007 on the band's website and from festivals the band were playing at. It was then released commercially on 16 July 2007. The album features a new logo for the band, marking the end of the band using their previous logo of seven years. The CD release was also released with a transparent CD tray, a first for the band, and the booklet and cover photographs were photographed by their percussionist Iain Copeland. The album title is a quote from writer Derek Cooper, taken from his 1983 book Skye. An excerpt from the book about faeries, which concludes with the quote, feature in the album's liner notes. The album has been well received by critics. Simon Jones of fRoots gave a positive review of the album, saying \\"there can be no one direct approach taken to describe the constantly evolving music of the Peatbog Faeries, its very nature is polyglot and that disparate collection of philosophies makes them the perfect band for 2007. In a time when we have to move beyond silly categories and vague labels, which by very definition can no longer apply ‚Äì unless you‚Äôre stuck in a time warp ‚Äì fusion is the only term that makes real sense. If anything, What Men Deserve to Lose (a quote from writer Derek Cooper) moves out further into the big, blue beyond, still latching on to island roots yet in a mood of glorious experiment\\". Chris Nickson of Allmusic was also positive, saying, after noting the many instruments used on the album, \\"the result is that they combine ancient and modern in very effective proportions, and aren't afraid of heavy touches of electricity, like Tom Salter's raucous guitar work on \\"The Invergarry Blues.\\" They've gradually conjured up their own space\\". Dave Beeby of The Living Tradition was favourable, saying \\"this is dance music at its best, driving rhythms and all that, whilst being a really good listen. They haven‚Äôt sat back on the success of their previous CD, but have strengthened even more.\\" Following the release of the album, the band embarked on a long running tour from 2007‚Äì08. The tour typically featured eleven tracks, including an eighteen and a half minute set known as \\"The Dancing Feet Set\\" which combined different tracks from various different periods of the band's career.Live liner notes. Recordings of tracks from two of the 2008 concerts from the tour were then used to create the band's highly anticipated live album Live (2009), which features four tracks from What Men Deserve to Lose amongst its eleven tracks; \\"The Invergarry Blues\\", \\"The Locks and Rocks Reel\\", \\"Friend of Crazy Joe\\" and \\"Still Drunk in the Morning\\".Live track listing. ==Track listing== # \\"The Locks and Rocks Reel\\" - 5:07 # \\"The Invergarry Blues\\" - 3:46 # \\"Jason's Famous Banjo\\" - 3:58 # \\"There's a Girl Behind the Bar Who Thinks She's Garbo\\" - 5:55 # \\"Sudden Dilemma\\" - 5:57 # \\"Friend of Crazy Joe\\" - 5:39 # \\"Dr. Gig\\" - 4:23 # \\"Still Drunk in the Morning\\" - 5:20 # \\"Ramasaig\\" - 4:46 # \\"Nyup\\" - 4:17 == See also == * Peatbog Faeries * Celtic fusion ==References== == External links == * peatbogfaeries.com * peatbogfaeries.com/myspace.html Category:2007 albums Category:Peatbog Faeries albums ","title":"What Men Deserve to Lose"},{"id":"11648237","text":"Huangmaojian () is a mountain in Longquan County in southwest of Zhejiang province in eastern China.

He has been domiciled in Cape Town in South Africa since 1970. ==Biography== Rajna was born in Budapest, Hungary. He started to play the piano and compose at an early age and studied at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music where he won the Liszt Prize in 1947. That year he left Hungary to settle in London and enrolled at the Royal College of Music. He soon appeared at the Proms under such conductors as Carlo Maria Giulini, Colin Davis and John Pritchard, also becoming a frequent broadcaster at the BBC. In 1963 he was appointed as Professor of Piano at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. His first commercial recording was the complete piano solo works of Igor Stravinsky. Since then he has recorded music by Alexander Scriabin, Robert Schumann and Olivier Messiaen, the piano part of Igor Stravinsky's Petrushka with the New Philharmonia under Erich Leinsdorf, and B√©la Bart√≥k's Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta with Sir Georg Solti and the London Symphony Orchestra. He has completed a cycle of recordings devoted to the entire piano music of Enrique Granados. Subsequently he undertook to record Franz Liszt's 12 Transcendental Etudes and 12 Etudes, Op. 1. Rajna has often performed his own two piano concertos. He settled with his family in Cape Town, South Africa in 1970 to take up an appointment at the Faculty of Music of the University of Cape Town (UCT), where he became Associate Professor of Piano in 1989. In January 1981 he was awarded a University Fellowship by UCT and the same year received an Artes Award from the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) for his series of radio programmes on Franz Liszt, entitled \\"A Lisztian Metamorphosis\\". He completed his Piano Concerto No. 2 in 1984. The following year he received a doctorate in music from UCT in recognition of his body of compositions. During a 1990 visit to England he recorded the Schumann Piano Concerto with the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra and gave a recital of works by Ern≈ë Dohn√°nyi and himself. During the same year Rajna played the solo piano part in the first, and so far the only South African performance of Messiaen's monumental Turangal√Æla-Symphonie with the Cape Town Symphony Orchestra. His 1990 Harp Concerto had its European premi√®re in Copenhagen at the Fifth World Harp Congress in July 1993. This work and his Second Piano Concerto (with Rajna as soloist) was recorded by the National Symphony Orchestra of the SABC and released on CD in 1993. At the end of that year he retired from his post at the UCT College of Music. His very first commercial recording, Stravinsky's complete solo piano works, which Rajna recorded in 1963, and which had been unavailable for 30 years, re-entered international circulation after the Dutch label, Emergo Classics, released their digitally remastered version in their Saga Classics series in 1993. In 1994 he completed Video Games for Orchestra and his opera Amarantha. The former Foundation for the Creative Arts commissioned these works as well as the Rhapsody for Clarinet and Orchestra (1995), premi√®red by Robert Pickup, the NSO and Richard Cock in 1996. In the same year Rajna was a recipient of the UCT Book Award for his Harp Concerto. This annual award is given in recognition of outstanding contribution to any branch of learning and it was the first time that a musical composition was thus honoured. In 1997 Rajna received the Molteno Award for lifetime achievement from the Cape Tercentenary Foundation. Rajna's Fantasy for Violin and Orchestra (1996), commissioned by the then Natal Philharmonic Orchestra, was premi√®red in Durban in 1998. Lyon and Healy Harps of Chicago commissioned his Suite for Violin and Harp for presentation at the Seventh World Harp Congress in Prague in July 1999. Anna Verkholantseva, winner of the 1997 Moscow international Harp Competition, who premiered this work in Prague, has since then made a CD of it and has given performances of the \\"Suite\\" with her violinist partner, Alexander Trostiansky, in Moscow, London, New York, Chicago and San Francisco. The opera Amarantha was premiered in November 2000 by Cape Town Opera in conjunction with the UCT Opera School. In 2001 Rajna created his own CD label, Amarantha Records. His catalogue includes his performance of Goyescas by Granados, music by fellow Hungarian Dohnanyi, Messiaen's complete \\"Vingt regards\\", Bartok's 2nd and 3rd Piano Concertos, concertos by Schumann and Barber, Brahms'2nd Piano Concerto, music by Sriabin and a selection of Rajna's representative compositions. The same year Rajna wrote Tarantulla for violin and piano in response to a commission for the 2002 Pretoria contest by the University of South Africa (Unisa) International String Competition. The Cape Town premiere of Video Games by the Cape Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by David de Villiers took place in August 2002 to public and critical acclaim. International violin virtuoso Mikhail Ovrutsky, who was the winner of the 2002 Pretoria string competition and who had performed Rajna's Tarantulla on that occasion, came to Cape Town to perform Rajna's Fantasy for Violin and Orchestra in May 2004. Rajna's Harp Concerto had its Swiss premiere in Basel in September 2004. Rajna's recordings of the complete piano works of Granados, made in London for CRD in 1976, were reissued in 2004 on six CDs in a box set and distributed worldwide by Brilliant Classics. Between 2002 and 2004 Rajna completed another opera, Valley Song, based on the play by Athol Fugard. The premiere took place at the Spier Summer Arts Festival, Stellenbosch, in March 2005 and in 2007 the opera was revived at the Klein Karoo National Arts Festival in Oudtshoorn, where it gained prizes in two categories: best musical show and most promising newcomer (Golda Schultz, soprano, the opera's leading lady). In 2006 he completed The Creation-A Negro Sermon for chorus and orchestra, written for the First Cape Town International Summer Music Festival in 2006. Rajna's Piano Preludes are part of the syllabus for the Teachers' Licentiate of Unisa. In response to a commission by Unisa to write a set piece for the new Grade 7 Piano Examination Album he completed his Oriental Feast in August 2006. His Violin Concerto (2007) premiered in October 2010 at the University of Stellenbosch. In the course of celebrating Rajna's 80th birthday the Cape Philharmonic Orchestra performed extracts from Valley Song in a concert during the Third Cape Town International Summer Music Festival in November 2008. Rajna himself was the soloist in his 2nd Piano Concerto. Rajna prepared and reissued on his label a series of his landmark recordings of earlier vintage, now digitally remastered and available on CD for the first time. So far he has released Brahms's B flat major and Schumann's A minor piano concertos, Liszt's Transcendental Studies coupled with their earliest version, the 12 Etudes, Op. 1, and Messiaen's Vingt regards sur l'enfant- J√©sus. In the pipeline are piano concertos by Bart√≥k, Stravinsky, Prokofiev and Barber, Bach harpsichord concertos and music by Scriabin and Dohnanyi. ==Compositions== ===Ballet=== * Girl in a Mask, 1958 for the Western Theatre Ballet ===Operas=== * Amarantha, 2000 * Valley Song, based on the play by Athol Fugard, 2005 ===Filmography=== * Seven Years in Tibet, 1956 * Jet Storm, 1959 ===Orchestral works=== * Suite for Strings,1952‚Äì1954 * Movements for Strings, 1962 * Cantilenas and Interludes, 1968 * Divertimento Piccolo, 1987 * Video Games for orchestra, 1994 ====Concertante==== * Piano Concerto No. 1, 1960‚Äì1962 * Piano Concerto No. 2, 1983‚Äì1984 * Concerto for Harp and Orchestra, 1990 * Rhapsody for Clarinet and Orchestra, 1995 * Fantasy for Violin and Orchestra, 1996 * Concerto for Violin and Orchestra, 2007 ===Chamber=== ====Two players==== * Music for clarinet and piano, 1947, Alphonse Leduc, Paris 1970 * Music for cello and piano, 1950 * Music for violin and piano, 1956‚Äì57, Accent Music, J'burg 1990 * Suite for violin and harp, 1997‚Äì98, Lyon & Healy, Chicago 1998 * Tarantulla for Violin and Piano, Amarantha Music 2001 ====Four players==== * String Quartet, 1948 ====Ensemble==== * Serenade for ten wind instruments, percussion, cimbalom (or marimba) and piano/celesta == Piano == * Preludes for piano, 1947‚Äì1950, Accent Music, J'burg 1988 ‚Äì Amarantha Music, Cape Town 2002 * Capriccio for piano (or harpsichord), 1960 * Oriental Feast 2006, Unisa/Amarantha Music, 200 == Vocal == * Four Early Songs for high voice and piano ** Cradle Song (William Blake), 1948 ** Piping Down the Valleys Wild (William Blake), 1948 ** Meeting at Night (Robert Browning), 1948 ** Solfeggio, 1949 * Four Traditional African Lyrics for high voice and piano, 1975 ** The Sorrow of Kodio ** Idyll ** Serenade ** Cuckold contented * \\"Stop All the Clocks\\" for middle voice and piano, Four songs on poems by W.

Unusually for a Union cavalry regiment, the members of the regiment provided their own horses and equipment. The first Iowa was the first three-year cavalry regiment accepted for Federal service during the war. The regiment was mustered out on February 15, 1866, while on Reconstruction duty in Austin, Texas, and discharged for state service on March 16, 1866. == Detailed Service == This famous regiment was organized June 5, 1861, and ordered into quarters at Benton Barracks near St. Louis about the middle of October in the same year. It was composed of twelve companies, aggregating 1,095 men, and by additional enlistments soon numbered 1,245. The middle and western portion of Missouri was the highway to the so-called Southern Confederacy for recruits, sympathizers and bushwhackers, and during the entire winter of 1861, eight companies of the regiment were engaged in patrolling this region. Ever on the alert, their engagements and skirmishes were numerous. The first battle in which the regiment was engaged occurred on Black River (called Blackwater), where Cos. A, B. D, F. G and I, with about 60 of the 4th U. S. cavalry, attacked and captured about 1,300 Confederate recruits, 1,000 stands of arms and all the camp equipage. On Jan. 8, 1862, a Confederate camp was attacked and destroyed on Silver Creek, Mo., and a week later the regiment was in a raid to Warsaw, where it attacked and captured the Confederate pickets, charged into town and captured several prisoners. All of the early part of the following summer the regiment spent in scouts and raids, with here and there an important skirmish. In July the notorious guerrilla chief Quantrill was encountered by a few companies of the 1st cavalry on the wooded cliffs of Big Creek in Cass County. The regiment swept down on him like a whirlwind and in less than 30 minutes Quantrill and his band were scattered in all directions, the loss of the 1st IA being 2 killed and 10 wounded. A small detachment, sent out to capture some beef cattle belonging to Confederates, encountered a large band of guerrillas in the timber on Clear creek, about 2 miles from Taberville, and a short but spirited engagement ensued, in which the detachment was victorious, with a loss of 4 killed and 14 wounded. In December the 1st took part in an important expedition to Van Buren, Ark., resulting in a defeat of some Confederates and the capture of immense stores. On Aug. 18, 1862, the army crossed the White River at Clarendon, Ark., and on the 27th was fought the Battle of Bayou Meto, in which the regiment took a prominent part, driving the enemy across the bayou and making a dashing charge to save the only bridge across that deep and miry stream from destruction. In this charge the regiment lost 1 killed and 36 wounded, 1 mortally. The regiment then took the advance of the cavalry in the move on Little Rock. On Dec. 8 a force of 260 men, with detachments of other regiments and a section of artillery, marched toward Arkadelphia. A few miles south of Princeton, Dallas County, they encountered a force of the enemy numbering 800. The 1st IA cavalry being in the advance, dismounted and drove them from their position, taking 39 prisoners, together with arms and camp equipage. In Jan., 1864, 500 of the regiment reenlisted and on March 23, waiving their right to a veteran furlough at that time, joined the 7th Army Corps and took a prominent part in all the operations of the Camden Expedition. In this movement the regiment engaged and routed Gen. Price's forces at Elkin's Ferry, losing in killed and wounded 11 men. It was again in the advance from this place to Prairie d'Ane, a distance of 12 miles, skirmishing with the enemy the entire distance. Being on the right in the engagement which followed, it was the first to enter the Confederate works. It was again ordered to the front and engaged the enemy at Camden Cross-Roads, about 15 miles from Camden, at 7 o'clock in the morning. The fight lasted for six hours, when Brig-Gen. Rice ordered up the dismounted men of the regiment to deploy as skirmishers, and the enemy, stubbornly contesting the ground, was driven back through the city of Camden on the evening of the same day. On the 17th a detachment of the regiment, with detachments of other regiments, marched about 20 miles down the Washita River and captured a steamboat laden with corn and other quartermaster and commissary supplies. The loss of the regiment during this whole campaign was 5 killed, 3 taken prisoners and 25 wounded, a number severely, who died a few days afterward. The campaign being now virtually ended, the veteran portion of the regiment, 520 strong was relieved from duty and ordered home on veteran furlough. On their way to Pine Bluff they were attacked by a column of Confederates at Moro Creek.

Fibulin-1 is a calcium- binding glycoprotein. In vertebrates, fibulin-1 is found in blood and extracellular matrices. In the extracellular matrix, fibulin-1 associates with basement membranes and elastic fibers. The association with these matrix structures is mediated by its ability to interact with numerous extracellular matrix constituents including fibronectin, proteoglycans, laminins and tropoelastin. In blood, fibulin-1 binds to fibrinogen and incorporates into clots. Fibulins are secreted glycoproteins that become incorporated into a fibrillar extracellular matrix when expressed by cultured cells or added exogenously to cell monolayers. The five known members of the family share an elongated structure and many calcium-binding sites, owing to the presence of tandem arrays of epidermal growth factor-like domains. They have overlapping binding sites for several basement-membrane proteins, tropoelastin, fibrillin, fibronectin and proteoglycans, and they participate in diverse supramolecular structures. The amino-terminal domain I of fibulin consists of three anaphylatoxin-like (AT) modules, each approximately 40 residues long and containing four or six cysteines. The structure of an AT module was determined for the complement-derived anaphylatoxin C3a, and was found to be a compact alpha-helical fold that is stabilized by three disulphide bridges in the pattern Cys14, Cys25 and Cys36 (where Cys is cysteine). The bulk of the remaining portion of the fibulin molecule is a series of nine EGF-like repeats. ==Genes== * FBLN1, FBLN2, FBLN3, FBLN4, FBLN5, FBLN7 and HMCN1 is also known as \\"fibulin-6\\". ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Protein domains Category:Blood proteins ","title":"Fibulin"},{"id":"11648376","text":"This is a list of Canadians who have raced in American Championship Car Racing. *Ross Bentley *Bert Brooks *Claude Bourbonnais *Billy Bourque *Buddie Boys *Jack Buxton *John Cannon *Patrick Carpentier *Ed Crombie *Howard Dauphin *John Duff *George Eaton *Norm Ellefson *George Fejer *Billy Foster *Scott Goodyear *Allen Heath *Ludwig Heimrath *Ludwig Heimrath, Jr. *Pete Henderson *Cliff Hucul *John Jones *Ed Kostenuk *Harry MacDonald *Bon MacDougall *Joe Mazzucco *Arthur Miller *Greg Moore *Andrew Ranger *Eldon Rasmussen *Hal Robson *Ray Shadbolt *Alex Tagliani *Paul Tracy *Ira Vail *Michael Valiante *Jacques Villeneuve *Jacques Villeneuve, Sr. *Frank Weiss ==External links== ChampCarStats * Champ Car Category:Champ Car ","title":"List of Canadians in Champ Car"},{"id":"11648389","text":"Fabian Vasile Teu»ôan (born 31 October 1988) is a Romanian football player, currently playing for 1.

Her younger brother, Lewis Wintz, joined the Royal Navy and rose to the rank of vice-admiral. She was educated in a school near Fareham, Hampshire. While staying at Bath she met Agnes Weston, who lived there, and the two became close friends and remained so for the rest of their lives. In the 1870s they began to hold Sunday afternoon meetings at Wintz's mother's house for boys from the training ships at Devonport. These meetings grew into a major movement in both Plymouth and Portsmouth and the two women later bought a public house in each city, demolished them and replaced them with the two Sailors' Rests to serve as homes for sailors of all nationalities on shore leave. The establishment in Plymouth opened in 1876 and that in Portsmouth in 1881. They also founded the Royal Naval Temperance Society and established journals, Monthly Letters and Ashore and Afloat, and a library for sailors which distributed literature to ships all over the world. Weston died in 1918, but Wintz continued to serve as superintendent of the homes until her own death in 1929. She was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 1920 civilian war honours. She was given a full naval funeral at Devonport Dockyard Church attended by four hundred officers and ratings of the Royal Navy and was buried next to Weston. ==References== *Obituary, The Times, 17 January 1929 Category:1847 births Category:1929 deaths Category:English philanthropists Category:Dames Commander of the Order of the British Empire Category:Swiss emigrants to the United Kingdom Category:Swiss expatriates in England Category:British women in World War I Category:People from Schaffhausen ","title":"Sophia Wintz"},{"id":"11648439","text":"Paolo Magrassi is an Italian technologistWho's Who in the World 1998, 15th Edition, Marquis, New Providence, NJ known as one of the authorsAustralian National Training Authority, \\"Radio Frequency Identity Tags\\", in Shared Technology: A Road Map for Traditional and Emerging Industries to 2008, Chapter 17, Anta Publishers, Brisbane, Australia, September 2003 of the Supranet concept, the co-creator of the AlphaIC methodology for assessing the value of information technology expenditures,F.Frey, S.Williams-Allen, H.Vogl, L.Chandra, \\"Digital Asset Management: A Closer Look At The Literature\\", A Research Monograph at the Print Industry Center at the Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY, March 2005P.Griffiths, D.Remenyi, \\"Information Technology in Financial Services: A Model for Value Creation\\", Electronic Journal of Information Systems Evaluations, 2003 / Issue 2 / paper 12, ACI, Reading, UK and the manager of the Pontifex project, which in the mid-1980s introduced a novel approach to complex fleet scheduling.European Commission, Directorate-General XIII ‚Äì Information Technology, ESPRIT Project Information Services and Summaries, Brussels, 1992 In the early 2000s, Magrassi also was instrumental in introducing to the industrial and business worldUS Patent 7118034: \\"Systems and methods for package sortation and delivery using radio frequency identification technology\\", A.Baldassari, D.Anderson, R.Peters (United Parcel Service of America), October 10, 2006Scientific service of the French Embassy in Norway, Science and Technology In France, N.13, J.B.

After Captain Vernon Stiles purchased it in 1830, it became Stiles Tavern and quickly gained popularity, boasting that ‚Äúmore stage passengers dined there every day than at any other house in New England.‚Äù In addition to its fame as an inn, Stiles Tavern also became known as a wedding facility. Couples who disliked their state‚Äôs requirements for publishing their intentions to marry fled to Connecticut. There, Captain Stiles, also a Justice of the Peace, wed them in his tavern. The unions of these run-aways earned Stiles Tavern the celebrated reputation as the ‚ÄúGretna Green of New England.‚Äù When the temperance movement arose in the mid-1830s, Captain Stiles disposed of his liquor, transforming his tavern into a temperance house. After Captain Stiles, several innkeepers owned and managed the inn over the years. Eventually changing from a tavern to a restaurant, the building took on different titles, such as the Vernon Stiles Inn, the White Horse Inn at Vernon Stiles, and simply the White Horse Inn. ==Present state== Now a bed and breakfast, the inn currently is called The Cottage House. Though it no longer holds wedding ceremonies, it still accommodates several brides and guests of couples who host their weddings or receptions at its nearby sister property, Lord Thompson Manor, also a historic site. The Cottage House is part of the Thompson Hill Historic District, registered with the National Register of Historic Places; the State Register, and the Local Register, and is also recognized as a National Historical Site, a State Historical Site, and a City Historical Site. ==Claims to fame== Since Captain Vernon Stiles‚Äôs purchase of the inn in the 1830s, the signs outside The Cottage House have portrayed a gentleman riding in a carriage pulled by a white horse. This image depicts a visit from the famous Marquis de Lafayette in 1824. Lafayette stayed at the inn for three days during his tour of America, and visited with a few of the town locals. The Cottage House also was used in the 1959 filming of the mystery movie, The Man in the Net. ==References== Iamartino, Joseph, ed. (2003).

Bennett while he was chief technical officer at the Cierva Autogiro Company in 1936-1939, realizing the concept by his late colleague Juan de la Cierva. The Gyrodyne, constituting a third distinct type of rotorcraft and designated C.41 by the Cierva Autogiro Company, was in 1938 successfully tendered to the Royal Navy in response to Specification S.22/38 for a naval helicopter. Though preliminary work started on the project, it was abandoned with the outbreak of the Second World War, and G & J Weir, Ltd., the financiers of the Cierva Autogiro Company, declined to undertake further development in addition to their successful experiments with the W.5 and W.6 lateral twin-rotor helicopters. After the Second World War, the Cierva Autogiro Company was engaged with the development of the Cierva W.9 \\"Drainpipe\\" and the W.11 Air Horse helicopters under the direction of Cyril Pullin, and Bennett joined Fairey in late 1945 as head of the newly established rotary wing aircraft division. The Gyrodyne was a compact, streamlined rotorcraft weighing just over 4,410 lb (2,000 kg) and powered by a Alvis Leonides 522/2 radial engine, the power from which could be transmitted in variable ratios to the fixed-shaft/swashplate-actuated tilting hub- controlled rotor and the wing tip mounted propeller. The Gyrodyne possessed the hovering capability of a helicopter, while its propeller provided the necessary thrust for forward flight to enable its rotor, driven at low torque in cruise flight, to operate at low collective pitch with the tip-path plane parallel to the flight path to minimise vibration at high airspeed. Collective pitch was an automatic function of throttle setting and profile drag of the propeller, which to maintain rpm diverted torque away from the rotor as airspeed increased. A government contract to Specification E.4/46 was awarded for two prototypes with the first Fairey Gyrodyne exhibited as an almost complete airframe at White Waltham on 7 December 1946. ==Testing and evaluation== On 4 December 1947, the first of the two prototypes took off from White Waltham airfield, and continued to build up flying time until March 1948 when it was dismantled for a thorough examination. The second prototype, basically similar to the first but with more comfortable interior furnishings befitting its role as a passenger demonstrator, was flying by the time of the next SBAC Farnborough Airshow, in September 1948. The first prototype was reassembled and, following further test flying, took part in an attempt to set a new world helicopter speed record in a straight line.Apostolo 1984, p. 66. On 28 June 1948, flown by test pilot Basil Arkell, the Gyrodyne made two flights in each direction over a low altitude two mile (3 km) long course at White Waltham, achieving 124 mph (200 km/h), enough to secure the record.\\"FAI Record ID #13128 - Piston engine helicopters - Speed over a 3 km course\\" F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale Record date 28 June 1948. Accessed: 11 December 2013. A maximum airspeed of was achieved during the flight keeping seven inches of boost in reserve in the event a rapid climb became necessary as the flight was conducted at an altitude of less than above the ground. An attempt was to be made in April 1949 to set a 62 mi (100 km) closed-circuit record, but two days before the date selected a poorly machined flapping link in the rotor hub failed during flight and resulted in the crash of the aircraft at Ufton, near Reading, killing the pilot, Foster H. Dixon and observer, Derek Garraway. The Gyrodyne had been selected for use by the British Army for use in Malaya, beating both the Westland S.51 Dragonfly (a licence-built Sikorsky design) and the Bristol 171 Sycamore, with an order for six approved by the Treasury at the time of the accident. Though the Gyrodyne's projected performance was significantly better than that of the Dragonfly, and was expected to be in service earlier than the Sycamore, the crash of the first prototype delayed the development programme and the Army, having no other choice, acquired three S.51 Dragonflies, followed by Sycamores at a later date. == Second prototype == The second Gyrodyne was grounded during the accident investigation which determined flapping hinge retaining nut failure due to poor machining as the cause. The extensively modified second prototype, renamed Jet Gyrodyne, flew in January 1954. Though retaining the name \\"Gyrodyne\\", the Jet Gyrodyne was a compound gyroplane, and did not operate on the same principle as the original aircraft. It had a two-blade rotor manually controlled with cyclic and collective pitch mechanisms that acted directly on each rotor blade and was driven by tip jets fed with air from two compressors driven by the Alvis Leonides radial engine. Pusher propellers, one mounted at the tip of each stub wing, provided yaw control through differential collective pitch and thrust for forward flight. The Jet Gyrodyne was constructed to provide rotor drive and operational data for the Fairey Rotodyne compound gyroplane. The Jet Gyrodyne is on display at the Museum of Berkshire Aviation, Woodley, Reading. ==Specifications (Fairey FB-1 Gyrodyne)== ==See also== ==References== ;Notes ;Bibliography * Apostolo, Giorgio.

It was home to Harp Lager, and was formerly owned by Diageo. In 2015 the brewery closed, and production of Harp Lager and other products was moved to St. James's Gate Brewery in Dublin. The site has since been bought by John Teeling, and converted for operation as a distillery, the Great Northern Distillery. ==History== The Great Northern Brewery, which commenced operations in 1896 in Dundalk, Ireland, was the second largest brewery in Ireland, after St James‚Äôs Gate Brewery. It was bought in the late 1950s by Smithwick's Ale of Kilkenny, and subsequently by Guinness, which became part of [{Diageo . Up until 1960, the brewery produced stout and ale. However, in response to an increased demand for lager at that time, Guinness converted the brewery into a modern lager operation.A History of Beer and Brewing by Ian Spencer Hornsey, Royal Society of Chemistry (Great Britain) Working with German master brewer, Dr Hermann Muender, and local ingredients, Harp Lager was created. Within 12 months of launch in 1960, Harp had become an established brand throughout Ireland. A year later it was launched nationwide in Britain. This success meant that the brewery‚Äôs capacity had to be expanded to meet demand. ===Expansion=== The brewery had extensive facilities and it produced and packed a range of beers and ales, including Harp Lager, Smithwick's Ale, Satzenbrau Pils, Carlsberg and Warsteiner. Some 80 people were employed across a range of disciplines, including production, supply, customer service, technical and quality control. There was a substantial investment which saw the addition of a new brewhouse, additional fermentation vessels, a pall filtration plant and a carbonation/nitrogenation plant in the existing filtration centre. ===Closure=== On 9 May 2008, Diageo announced that the brewery, along with another plant in Kilkenny, would be closed by 2013, with operations moving to either St. James's Gate in Dublin or a new brewery to be built near Dublin.RTE news: closure of two Diageo breweries However, due to the declining property markets throughout the globe, Diageo reassessed its decision and put all closures on hold for a period, although the kegging facilities in Dundalk were moved to St James Gate. In effect this led to a reduction in staff from 82 to 53, not taking into account contractors. On 30 September 2013, all brewing and processing ceased and the brewery was officially closed by Diageo. Dismantling and removal of certain facilities to St. James' Gate in Dublin continued into 2014. ==Great Northern Distillery== After Diageo closed the site, it was announced that John Teeling, founder of the Cooley Distillery and director of the Irish Whiskey Company, would acquire the site and convert the brewery into a distillery.Independent.ie Argus Local News: Harp brewery shuts up shop after half-century On 31 July 2015 distilling began for the first time with the brewery having been renamed as the Great Northern Distillery. The site was renamed as the Great Northern Distillery. The Great Northern Distillery became the second largest and only the third grain distillery in Ireland. Products include various forms of whiskey, some spirit, and gin. It maintains the use of spring water from the Cooley Peninsula as a key feature of production, just as the brewery had before. ==References== ==External links== *History of Brewing in Dundalk *Image of Brewery from Carrick Road Category:Beer in Ireland Category:Buildings and structures in Dundalk Category:Food and drink companies established in 1846 Category:Food and drink companies disestablished in 2013 Category:Diageo Category:1846 establishments in Ireland Category:2013 disestablishments in Ireland ","title":"Great Northern Brewery, Dundalk"},{"id":"11648592","text":"Castelseprio is a comune (municipality) in the Province of Varese in the Italian region Lombardy, located about northwest of Milan and about south of Varese, bordering the municipalities of Cairate, Carnago, Gornate-Olona and Lonate Ceppino.

Jacob attended Ankeny High School as a freshman and sophomore where he played basketball, but never on the varsity team. As a junior, his family moved to Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where he attended Cedar Rapids Jefferson High School. In his senior season he was named to the Mississippi Valley Conference team and helped lead the team to State (they lost to West Des Moines Valley in the quarterfinals). Jacob accepted a scholarship to play at the University of South Dakota for coach Dave Boots. He was red-shirted his freshman year because of his lack of physical size and strength. His freshman campaign was successful in earning him a spot on the All-NCC freshman team. Soon afterwards, he decided to leave the University of South Dakota for Marshalltown Community College to pursue his dream of playing for a large, Division I university. Jacob played for Mike Marquis at Marshalltown Community College where he was named a JUCO All-American. The team compiled a record of 29-5,f and lost to the eventual Junior College national champions, Indian Hills Community College. Before the season started, Jacob was recruited by numerous major division I universities. When the University of Iowa extended a scholarship, Jacob accepted. Under Coach Tom Davis at Iowa, Jacob played on a team of upperclassmen. The team had a successful season but lost in the Sweet 16 to the University of Connecticut (the eventual champion). Jacob's senior year brought in the era of Steve Alford. With many seniors on the previous year's team now gone, Coach Alford had to quickly fill in players with a very short recruiting period. The result was a mediocre 14-16 record, with wins against Kansas, Ohio State & UConn. Jacob finished his career averaging 12.2 points and 7.3 rebounds for the University of Iowa Hawkeyes. After his senior year, Jacob signed with the Toronto Raptors of the NBA. After the preseason, he was released by the team and immediately signed a contract to play in France for Limoges CSP basketball club. After winning a championship with Limoges and winning the French league rebounding title, Jacob returned to the U.S. and played for the San Antonio Spurs summer league team. After several years of trying to make an NBA roster, Jacob decided to concentrate on only playing professionally in Europe. He retired in 2011, after 11 seasons professionally. Jacob played in Spain, Italy, France, Turkey, Israel, Ukraine and Germany. ==External links== * * * Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:American expatriate basketball people in France Category:American expatriate basketball people in Germany Category:American expatriate basketball people in Israel Category:American expatriate basketball people in Italy Category:American expatriate basketball people in Spain Category:American expatriate basketball people in Turkey Category:American expatriate basketball people in Ukraine Category:American men's basketball players Category:Basketball players from South Dakota Category:BC Kyiv players Category:Centers (basketball) Category:Gij√≥n Baloncesto players Category:Hapoel Afula players Category:Iowa Hawkeyes men's basketball players Category:Israeli Basketball Premier League players Category:Marshalltown Tigers men's basketball players Category:Limoges CSP players Category:Pallacanestro Biella players Category:Pallacanestro Pavia players Category:Pallalcesto Amatori Udine players Category:Power forwards (basketball) Category:South Dakota Coyotes men's basketball players Category:Sportspeople from Rapid City, South Dakota Category:Telekom Baskets Bonn players Category:Teramo Basket players ","title":"Jacob Jaacks"},{"id":"11648697","text":"KASS is a commercial radio station located in Casper, Wyoming, broadcasting on 106.9 FM.

He coined the binomial name Alcedo leucocephala. The current genus Halcyon was introduced by the English naturalist and artist William John Swainson in 1821. The name of the genus is from the classical Greek alku≈çn, a mythical bird, generally associated with the kingfisher. The specific epithet leucocephala is from the classical Greek leukos meaning \\"white\\" and -kephalos for \\"-headed\\". Five subspecies are recognised: * H. l. acteon (Lesson, R, 1830) ‚Äì Cape Verde Islands * H. l. leucocephala (Statius M√ºller, PL, 1776) ‚Äì Senegal and Gambia to northwest Somalia, north Tanzania and north DR Congo * H. l. semicaerulea (Gmelin, JF, 1788) ‚Äì south Arabian Peninsula * H. l. hyacinthina Reichenow, 1900 ‚Äì southeast Somalia to Tanzania * H. l. pallidiventris Cabanis, 1880 ‚Äì south DR Congo to northwest Tanzania and south to north South Africa ==Description== The sexes are similar. The adult of the nominate race H. l. leucocephala has a pale grey head, black mantle and back, bright blue rump, wings and tail, and chestnut underparts. Subspecies H. l. pallidiventris has a darker grey head and paler chestnut underparts but is otherwise similar. The beak is long, red and sharp. This bird grows to an average length of . The song is a succession of notes, ascending, descending and then ascending again, becoming increasingly strident. The warning call is a series of sharp notes, \\"tchk, tchk, tchk, tchk\\". ==Distribution and habitat== The grey-headed kingfisher is found in tropical and semi-tropical Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Its range includes Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Oman, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Africa, South Sudan, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Yemen, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Its typical habitat is woodland, scrub and cultivated areas, up to altitudes of about . ==Ecology== A dry- country kingfisher of scrub and woodland, solitary or in pairs, often found near water, but unlike most kingfishers is not aquatic. Perches on a branch, unmoving for long periods while watching the ground for signs of insects or small lizards, bobbing head before diving on prey. In appearance very like the brown-hooded kingfisher but with a red rather than red and black bill and similar to the woodland kingfisher, but the woodland kingfisher lacks the chestnut belly and has greater coverage of cyan feathers on the back. Nests in holes in steep riverbanks and is aggressively protective of its nest by repeated dive-bombing of foraging monitor lizards. It is parasitised by the greater honeyguide. This species migrates at night and is often killed by flying into obstacles such as buildings, towers and powerlines.

These declare Afghanistan to be completely independent both in external and internal affairs, with Kabul for its capital. Islam is to be the religion of the country, and the Sharia (Islamic law) is to be binding. Afghan subjects are to enjoy liberty of the person and freedom in all matters of trade, industry, and agriculture, and slavery and forced labour are prohibited. There is to be a Council of State (Majlis-i-Shora-Milli) of 120 elected representatives from the provinces, to which proposals for new laws are to be submitted, and a 40-member Chamber of Notables (Majlis-i-Ayan) selected and appointed by the king. Primary education is made compulsory, and foreign newspapers which do not offend against the religion and policy of the state will be free to enter Afghanistan. ==End of September 1932== Sardar Ala Gholam Nabi Khan, son of Abdor Rahman's famous general, Haidar Khan Charkhi, who was himself for many years Afghan minister at Moscow under King Amanullah, and made an abortive attempt to restore that monarch in May 1929, with Russian assistance, returns to Kabul from Berlin, where he had been living since the accession of Nadir Khan. Early in November he is arrested on a charge of fomenting rebellion among the tribes of the southeast among whom his family has great influence, and of intriguing with the Soviet government, with a view to procuring the restoration of King Amanullah. He is brought to trial before the Loya jirga, or Great Assembly, early in November, and, incriminating documents being produced, he is condemned to death and shot. One of his brothers, Gholam Jilani Khan, who recently returned from Moscow, is also arrested, and another, Gholam Zaddiq Khan, who was minister in Berlin, is dismissed from his post.

He graduated with a Law Degree at the University of Edinburgh in 1948. After founding the Buenos Aires Museum of Modern Art in 1956, he went on to champion the cause of Argentine and Latin American art as Director of Cultural Affairs (1960) in the government of Arturo Frondizi. Among his many initiatives of that period, Alicia Penalba‚Äôs sculptures and Antonio Berni‚Äôs etchings were sent to the S√£o Paulo and Venice Biennales respectively, both artists obtaining First Prize. Named Cultural Director of the Organization of American States (OAS) in 1963 with headquarters in Washington, D.C., he continued his task of promotion of North and Latin American culture until his resignation in 1970. It was at this time that he supported the construction of the impressive memorial monument to U.S. President John F. Kennedy by Uruguayan artist Lincoln Presno in Quem√∫ Quem√∫, a vast deserted plain in the Argentine province of La Pampa; his outspoken inauguration speech as official representative of the OAS, pronounced during the military government of General Juan Carlos Ongan√≠a, won public acclaim while provoking angry reactions on the part of the authorities present, earning him the local government‚Äôs condemnation as persona non grata, revoked a few years later. Back in Buenos Aires he has supported culture in all its forms through an incessant activity of lectures in his own country and abroad, prologues for artists‚Äô exhibitions and a constant output of articles on Argentine daily La Naci√≥n, with which he collaborated for over twenty years, often sharing the Culture page with Jorge Luis Borges during the Eighties. Several volumes of Squirru‚Äôs poetry and prose writings have been published over the years, most of which are today out of print and considerably difficult to find. His correspondents include such personalities as Henry Miller, Fernando Demar√≠a, Thomas Merton, Edward Hopper, Ned O'Gorman, Huntington Hartford, Sir Herbert Read, Edward Albee, Oswaldo Vigas, Julio Cort√°zar, Olga Blinder, Alejandra Pizarnik, Barnaby Conrad, Paul Blackburn, Amancio Williams, Jackie Kennedy and Robert F.

On the cultural identity and importance of Latin America * The great nations of Spain and Portugal, England and Scotland, Ireland and other European countries have given being to our communities and, happily for Latin America, in combination with the blood of the native Indian peoples which runs through our veins, sustaining and nourishing us. * Latin America is underdeveloped economically. Latin America is not underdeveloped culturally. * In the realm of creative achievement, many among the best artists, composers, writers and intellectuals of today are to be found in Latin America. On the functions of art * The purpose of art and thought is to reveal to man his true essence putting him face to face with his deeper self. * Art is like a mirror and every man reacts to a work of art according to what he himself is. * Very often what art reveals to man is something he would prefer not to see; that explains why art has so many detractors. On the responsibilities of artists and intellectuals * The poet must be a part of the world but he cannot be its creature. * I cannot agree to reduce or limit the creative act to the needs and levels of sociological considerations. * A poet is neither a politician nor an economist nor a sociologist. The intellectual, the artist and the creative mind does not adhere to this or that partial aspect of man but to man himself. * The great legacies of any culture - whether their creators be called Aeschylus, Shakespeare, Cervantes, Kafka or Picasso - move us today because they present man with his problems, his pains and his joys, which are far more lasting than his social, political or economic condition. * Those who have pledged themselves to the major revolution of the spirit must firmly refuse the compromise of minor revolutions and the distraction of partial goals. On Communism in Latin America * The Marxist alternative might well carry out a revolution, as in Cuba, but it would never be our own and would thus bring all the frustration that incompatibility implies. * Take away the images of the Saints and you will get the image of Lenin in no time. * Communism overruns any country which does not possess its own mystique.

At his instigation a number of tribesmen take up arms with the intention of marching on Kabul, and they receive considerable reinforcements from the Wazir and Mahsud tribes across the Indian border. They meet the government troops which were sent south to oppose them in the neighbourhood of Matun, and some sharp fighting takes place at the end of February and beginning of March. The tribesmen from across the border then begin to withdraw at the bidding of some of their elders who were sent by the British authorities to recall them, and the uprising soon comes to an end. Later in the year one of the ringleaders, Tor Malang, is executed with some of his associates, but the \\"Crazy Fakir\\", who fled abroad, is allowed to return with the assurance of a free pardon, on account of his advanced age. ==July 1933== Afghanistan becomes a party to the Eight-Power Pact of Nonaggression formulated by the Soviet Union. ==October 6, 1933== The first Afghan minister, Habibullah Tarzi, arrives in Tokyo. It was decided earlier in the year to establish an Afghan legation there on account of the increasing demand in Afghanistan for Japanese textiles, chemicals, and machinery. ==November 8, 1933== King Mohammed Nadir Shah is assassinated at a school prize-giving in the courtyard of the palace. The assassin proves to be a servant of Yusufzai Sardar Ali Gholam Nabi Khan, who was executed for conspiracy and treason exactly a year previously, and his motive was to revenge his master. He is executed along with a number of his associates on December 22. Nadir Shah reigned for just over four years, during which time he laboured chiefly to instil into his subjects a desire for national unity and for peaceful progress in the arts of civilization. The success of his policy is demonstrated by the fact that his assassination has no political repercussions. His son Mohammed Zahir Shah, a youth of 19, is immediately proclaimed king, and receives the allegiance of his three uncles, Mohammad Hashim Khan, the prime minister, Faiz Mohammad Khan, the minister for foreign affairs, and Shah Mahmud Khan, the minister of war, and of the rest of the ministry, the Ulemas, and the tribal leaders. Kabul soon resumes its wonted aspect and the rest of the country remains perfectly quiet. One of the new king's first acts is to pardon Ghulam Dastgir, the Kotkai pretender, who had given a good deal of trouble earlier in the year and who now transfers his allegiance from Amanullah to Zahir Shah. ==References== Afghanistan Category:Years of the 20th century in Afghanistan Afghanistan ","title":"1933 in Afghanistan"},{"id":"11648878","text":"The 3rd Iowa Cavalry Regiment was a cavalry regiment that served in the Union Army during the American Civil War. ==Service== The 3rd Iowa Cavalry was organized at Keokuk, Iowa and mustered in for three years of Federal service between August 30, 1861, and September 14, 1864.

By definition, the VBV shall not overflow nor underflow when its input is a compliant stream, (except in the case of low_delay). It is therefore important when encoding such a stream that it comply with the VBV requirements. One way to think of the VBV is to consider both a maximum bitrate and a maximum buffer size. You'll need to know how quickly the video data is coming into the buffer. Keep in mind that video data is always changing the bitrate so there is no constant number to note how fast the data is arriving. The larger question is how long before the buffer overflows. A larger buffer size simply means that the decoder will tolerate high bitrates for longer periods of time, but no buffer is infinite, so eventually even a large buffer will overflow. ==Operation Modes== There are two operational modes of VBV: Constant Bit Rate (CBR) and Variable Bit Rate (VBR). CBR - The decoder's buffer is filled over time at a constant data rate in the case of CBR. VBR - and at a non-constant rate in the case of VBR. In both cases, data is removed from the buffer in varying chunks, depending on the actual size of the coded frames. ==Standards== In the H.264 and VC-1 standards, the VBV is replaced with generalized version called Hypothetical Reference Decoder (HRD). ==References== *MPEG Tutorial - Video Buffering Verifier Category:Film and video technology Category:MPEG ","title":"Video buffering verifier"},{"id":"11648910","text":"Joseph Paul \\"Dutch\\" Cretzer (April 17, 1911 ‚àí May 4, 1946) was an American bank robber and prisoner at Alcatraz who participated in and was slain in the bloody \\"Battle of Alcatraz\\" which took place following a failed escape attempt between May 2 and May 4, 1946. == Criminal career == Cretzer started his criminal career at an early age and had been in and out of prison since 1927. He was married to Edna May Kyle, the sister of Arnold Kyle. On January 25, 1936, Edna Cretzer was taken into custody and charged with running a brothel in Pittsburgh, California. She quickly posted bail whilst her husband Joseph remained a fugitive. Cretzer and Kyle formed the backbone of a gang, the Cretzer-Kyle Gang, which robbed banks along the west coast. Cretzer's prowess led to him reaching public enemy no. 4 on the Federal Bureau of Investigation's most wanted list by September 1939. Cretzer was apprehended by the FBI when they caught up to him in Chicago, Illinois on August 27. On November 7, his wife Edna pleaded guilty to harboring her husband and Cretzer himself confessed to one of the robberies in Los Angeles on January 24, 1940. Cretzer was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment and was incarcerated at McNeil's Island. Cretzer arrested ==Prison== Cretzer began serving his sentence at McNeil Island in February 1940. Cretzer reunited with his old partner and brother-in-law, Arnold Kyle. In April 1940, he and Kyle hijacked a prison lorry in an attempt to escape but were both recaptured after three days hiding in the woods. On Wednesday, June 26, 1940, Cretzer and Kyle were indicted by a federal grand jury in Tacoma, Washington for attempting to escape from the McNeil Island Penitentiary. The convicts were transported from the island to the U.S. District Court in Tacoma for arraignment on four separate occasions and each time postponed a plea. Judge Yankwich, visiting from Los Angeles, was convinced the men were making as many trips as possible, hoping for an opportunity to escape. The judge finally declared that he was not going to be a party to any more commuting and would grant no more continuances. On Saturday, July 20, Cretzer and Kyle entered pleas of not guilty and Judge Yankwich set the trial date for August 22, 1940. Tacoma attorneys Anthony M. Ursich, and William F. LeVeque were appointed to represent the defendants. A trial began in a U.S. District Court in Tacoma on Thursday, August 22, 1940. During the sentencing in the courthouse a US Marshal Artis James Chitty entered a cell to return Cretzer and Kyle back to the courtroom. Chitty entered the cell, the two men sprang to their feet and Cretzer grabbed Chitty around the waist and pulled him forward. Marshal Chitty was thrown against the cell wall and Kyle reached for Chitty's right-hand back pocket in an attempt to snatch his revolver. A struggle ensued and all three men fell onto the floor. A penitentiary guard grabbed Kyle just as he struck Chitty in the face with his right fist. More guards rushed in and quickly subdued the prisoners. Chitty arose, berated the men and then walked into an adjoining office. Chitty while speaking to a clerk, Lillian Holtz, collapsed onto the floor and was unconscious. He was carried into his private office where two physicians pronounced him dead. Less than 10 minutes had elapsed from the time he was attacked until his death. died from a heart attack as result of a struggle with Cretzer following another failed attempt to escape. Deputy marshals escorted Cretzer and Kyle back into the courtroom and Judge Yankwich resumed the trial. When the court denied a motion for a mistrial, the two defendants withdrew their not-guilty pleas and entered pleas of guilty to the escape charge. Judge Yankwich thereupon sentenced Cretzer and Kyle to additional terms of five years, to commence at the expiration of their 25-year sentences for bank robbery. The Bureau of Prisons quietly transferred Cretzer and Kyle to the Alcatraz Island Federal Penitentiary in San Francisco Bay, a maximum security prison established in 1934 to hold violent and incorrigible prisoners. Cretzer was sentenced to life for murder and sent to Alcatraz in August 1940. On May 21, 1941 he again attempted to escape from one of the island's workshops along with Sam Shockley, Arnold Kyle, and Lloyd Barkdoll. During the escape attempt the men held a number of guards hostage but gave up when they failed to cut through the tool-proof bars. For this escape attempt, he was sentenced by an internal tribunal to serve five years in the prison's high-security unit, called D Block, which was isolated from the rest of the prison and where prisoners were confined to their cells almost all of the time. ==Battle of Alcatraz== Cretzer had only recently been let out of D Block when he became an accomplice in yet another escape plan. This plan had been hatched by the cell-house orderly Bernard Coy who offered Cretzer a place on the break in return for use of his onshore contacts. The failure of the plan led to the bloody and hopeless standoff known as the \\"Battle of Alcatraz\\" during which Cretzer, armed with a .45 automatic handgun, opened fire on a number of hostage guards held in two cells in an apparent attempt to prevent any of them giving evidence against the would-be escapees. Cretzer made no attempt to surrender and was slain by guard fire or committed suicide early on May 4 when trapped in a utility corridor. When his \\"wife\\" came to claim Cretzer's body she identified herself as his sister and was arrested for her outstanding warrants and jumping her $10,000 bail bond on the white slavery charge. He is buried in Cypress Lawn Memorial Park. ==Film depictions== Cretzer was portrayed by Telly Savalas in Alcatraz ‚Äî The Whole Shocking Story (1980) and by Howard Hesseman in Six Against the Rock (1987). ==Notes and references== Category:1911 births Category:1946 deaths Category:American escapees Category:Inmates of Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary Category:American prisoners and detainees Category:American bank robbers Category:Burials at Cypress Lawn Memorial Park Category:Deaths by firearm in California Category:Escapees from United States federal government detention Category:American people of German descent ","title":"Joseph Paul Cretzer"},{"id":"11648913","text":"your bitcoinThe following lists events that happened during 1935 in Afghanistan.

Since 2009, King of Shaves has used a business model similar to that used by Coca-Cola, with a central office controlling research and development, whilst production and point of sale is localised to a specific market. The success of this model has varied. Though in 2009 the company's merchandise was stocked in at least 7 separate countries, from 2007 the turnover went from ¬£13.9 million, to ¬£25 million in 2008, to ¬£10 million by 2012. On 22 June 2009, the company announced a \\"Shaving Bond\\" issue of up to five thousand ¬£1,000 non- transferable and non-convertible bonds, which was reported in the presshttp://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Business/King-Of-Shaves-Tries-To- Raise-5-Million-Pounds-By-Issuing-Bonds-To- Customers/Article/200906415315203?lpos=Business_First_Buisness_Article_Teaser_Region_2&lid;=ARTICLE_15315203_King_Of_Shaves_Tries_To_Raise_5_Million_Pounds_By_Issuing_Bonds_To_Customers and described by Will King as being an \\"innovative way to potentially raise money from up to 5,000 brand enthusiasts\\". The issue was overseen by FSA regulated accountancy firm BDO Stoy Hayward with legal advice provided by Memery Crystal LLP. In October 2011 The King of Shaves Company signed a multi- year agreement with Spectrum Brands Holdings Inc, owner of Remington branded electrical grooming products, to exclusively distribute King of Shaves products in the US and Canada. The distribution agreement was dissolved in 2012 after 'breaches of contract' by Spectrum Brands. On 27 October 2014 it was announced that Will King would be stepping down as CEO, with Andy Hill appointed as the new CEO.http://www.cosmeticsbusiness.com/news/article_page/Will_King_exits_King_of_Shaves/102851 ==Razors and blades== King of Shaves launched a 4-blade razor (call the Azor) in the UK in late 2008. They launched a 5-blade razor (called the Azor 5) in the UK in early 2011. The cartridges featured blades manufactured by Kai Industries in Japan (a shareholder in King of Shaves). The Azor 5 was discontinued in early 2014 and was replaced by the Hyperglide system razor. All the razors have been designed and manufactured in the UK, with cartridges developed in collaboration with Kai. ==Mergers and acquisitions== In March 2008 KMI acquired the issued share capital of Floraroma Ltd., which owns women's toiletries brands including Phil Smith, Delicious Beauty, Dead Sea Source, Little Me, Derma-Mum and Floracologie. In October 2009, KMI acquired the Naked skincare brand.http://www.kmibrands.com/news/kmi_gets_a_new_look?from_page=1 ==Criticism== In 2009 the company offered savings bonds with 6%pa interest rate to consumers. These savings bonds rely on the company's growth in order to fund the returns. This scheme was not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme and at the time of application consumers were unable to get reports on how well the company was performing. In 2012 a fresh batch of bonds were released to existing Bondholders only, though the ability to redeem them has been withheld for a number of years, with no change to their status with regulators. ==Sponsorships== King of Shaves has sponsored athletes throughout Great Britain. During 2006 they sponsored John Terry and P1 Offshore Powerboat. later years, they sponsored both Chrissy Palmer for MRF Formula Ford races, but also Jordan King, son of Justin King (former CEO of Sainsbury's), during his F3 races. 2012 saw the company sponsor James Ellington the \\"eBay\\" athlete and back the Welsh Extreme 40 catamaran. ==References== ==External links== * Official consumer website for King of Shaves * Official USA website for King of Shaves Category:Personal care brands Category:British brands Category:Shaving Category:Shaving cream brands ","title":"King of Shaves"},{"id":"11648925","text":"Zachary Taylor Shafer (July 13, 1866 ‚Äì October 27, 1945) was a Major League Baseball player in the 19th century. ==Career== Shafer was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1866.

It contains 60 churches located in Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. ==History== ===Beginnings as Egly Amish=== In the first half of the 19th century, the time before the Amish split into Amish Mennonites and Old Order Amish, several members of the Amish Egly family immigrated from Baden, Germany, to North America. Among them was Henry Egly (1824‚Äì1890). Egly was elected deacon of a Berne-Geneva Amish church in Indiana. In 1858, Egly was then elected bishop of the Berne-Geneva Amish Church. Egly, who insisted on the new birth experience, withdrew from the Amish church. Approximately half of the congregation withdrew as well. In 1866, the first Egly-Amish church was created in Berne, Indiana. In the beginning the Egly Amish church was very strict in regard to discipline and dress, but later developed in the same direction as the Amish Mennonites, that is towards the Mennonite mainstream, away from the Amish heritage.Fellowship of Evangelical Churches at Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online. ===Defenseless Mennonites=== The Egly-Amish officially adopted the name \\"Defenseless Mennonite\\" on 6 November 1908 as the congregation wanted to be known as more Mennonite rather than Amish. ===Evangelical Mennonite Church=== In 1942, the Defenseless Mennonites were charter members in the founding of the National Association of Evangelicals. Later, in 1948, their name was changed to \\"Evangelical Mennonite Church\\" to reflect both their Anabaptist and Evangelical beliefs. ===Fellowship of Evangelical Churches=== On 2 August 2003, the Evangelical Mennonite Church voted to be known as the \\"Fellowship of Evangelical Churches\\", or FEC. ==Doctrine== The Defenseless Mennonite Conference published its Confession of Faith, Rules and Discipline in 1917. The confession of faith was revised in 1937, 1949, 1961, and 1980. It contains 12 articles of faith. The Lord's Supper is observed with open communion. ==Organization== The conference office is located in Fort Wayne, Indiana. The FEC organization is governed through a congregational form of governance. Local congregations elect delegates to a delegate body, which in turn elects the conference leadership. The conference is composed of 34 churches in the Midwest of the United States, with 5278 members. 55 percent of the churches are located in Illinois and Indiana. All FEC ministries are funded by voluntary donations of congregations and individuals. ==Branches and connections== * The Missionary Church Association came out of the \\"Egly Amish\\" in 1898 (see Missionary Church). * The Evangelical Mennonite Church is a member of the National Association of Evangelicals. ==Affiliated organizations== These organizations have their own governing boards but are affiliated solely with the Fellowship of Evangelical Churches. * Miracle Camp and Retreat CenterMiracle Camp and Retreat Center * Life Change Camp and Retreat CenterLife Change Camp and Retreat Center * Salem4YouthSalem4Youth * Christian Service FoundationChristian Service Foundation ==Affiliated churches== === Colorado === *Lifegate Church === Idaho === *Lakeview Bible Church === Illinois=== *Calvary Community Church *Crossroads Church of Monticello *Dewey Community Church *Eureka Bible Church *Grace Evangelical Church *Great Oaks Community Church *Groveland Evangelical Mennonite Church *Heartland Community Church *Jacob‚Äôs Well Community Church *Living Hope Community Church *New Beginnings Church *Northwoods Community Church *Oak Grove Evangelical Bible Church *Rock Creek Bible Church *Salem Church === Indiana === *Berne Evangelical Church *Brookside Church *Crossview Church *Highland Gospel Community *Mission Church *Pine Hills Church *Sonlight Community Church *Upland Community Church *Westwood Fellowship === Kansas === *Grace Community Church *Grace Community Fellowship *Grace Crossing *New Anthem Community Church *Sterling Evangelical Bible Church === Maine === *The Hill *Life Community Church *Moss Brook Community Church === Michigan === *Church of the Good Shepherd *Comins Mennonite Church *Lawton Evangelical Church *Neighborhood Church *The Remedy === Minnesota === *The Real Tree Church *True North === Missouri === *Bethel Mennonite Church *Freedom Point *Harrisonville Community Church *PeaRidge Community Church === Ohio === *Archbold Evangelical Church *Catalyst Community Church *Christ the King Church *Crossroads Evangelical Church *Evermore Community Church *Life Church of Loraine County *Life Community Church *Oak Bend Church *Pathway Church *Solid Rock Community Church *Wave Community Church === Pennsylvania === *River City Church == Literature == *Frank S.

This movement is the result of an agitation carried on for some months in Waziristan by one Syed Mohammad Sadi, commonly known as the Shami Pir (Syrian imam), a priest from Damascus whose family is connected with the ex-king Amanullah. A rebellion breaks out in southeast Afghanistan, headed by the Suleiman khel, and the number of the insurgents soon rises to 2,000. The government, which has been watching the activities of the Shami Pir, is not taken unawares, and quickly sends to the scene of the disturbances two brigades with ten aeroplanes, which are soon after reinforced by two more brigades.

Nothing certain is known about his musical education, though he may have learnt from Franz Tunder (1614-1667), organist of St. Mary's Church, L√ºbeck, or his own uncle Matthias Weckmann (ca. 1616-1674), organist of St. Jacob's Church, Hamburg. In 1667, he became organist of the Marktkirche in Hanover, succeeding Melchior Schildt (1592-1667). In 1685, he moved to Hamburg, where he became organist of the Petrikirche. It was there that he made the acquaintance of Johann Adam Reincken; he went on to marry his daughter Margaretha Maria in 1686. Kneller's son-in-law Johann Jacob Hencke became his assistant in 1717, and succeeded in him in 1723. Kneller was well respected as a musician, and often acted as an examiner of organs and organists. He was part of the group that examined the candidates for organist at the Jacobikirche, Hamburg, in 1720, which included J.S. Bach (though he did not appear for an audition, he was still chosen for the post but had to decline). ==Works== His surviving compositions consist of a few works for organ, typical of the North German baroque toccata form: free passages alternating with fugal sections; this style was described as 'a free way of composition, not subject to any constraints' by Athanasius Kircher (1601-1680), and is thus a sort of stylus phantasticus. These are preludes and fugues in D minor, G major and F minor, originally written in tablature, at the church of Mylau, Saxony. They are published in an edition by K. Beckmann, Wiesbaden, 1987. He also wrote a partita with eight variations on Nun komm der Heiden Heiland (Come now, saviour of heathens) (2 var. published in K. Straube: Choralvorspiele alter Meister, Leipzig, 1907). Three other fragments of preludes also survive. An organ Te Deum attributed to 'A. Kniller' is believed to be the only known work by a different composer by the name of Anton Kniller. ==Further reading== *W.

The Canadian Hot 100 was launched on the issue dated March 31, 2007, and is currently the standard record chart in Canada; a new chart is compiled and officially released to the public by Billboard every Tuesday. The chart is similar to Billboards US-based Hot 100 in that it combines physical and digital sales as measured by Nielsen SoundScan, streaming activity data provided by online music sources, and radio airplay as measured by Nielsen BDS. Canada's radio airplay is the result of monitoring more than 100 stations representing rock, country, adult contemporary and Top 40 genres. The first number-one song of the Canadian Hot 100 was \\"Girlfriend\\" by Avril Lavigne on March 31, 2007. As of the issue for the week ending October 17, 2020, the Canadian Hot 100 has had 159 different number-one songs. The current number-one song is \\"Mood\\" by 24kGoldn featuring Iann Dior. ==History== The chart was launched on the issue dated March 31, 2007 and was made available for the first time via Billboard online services on June 7, 2007. With this launch, it marked the first time that Billboard created a Hot 100 chart for a country outside the United States. Billboard charts manager Geoff Mayfield announced the premiere of the chart, explaining \\"the new Billboard Canadian Hot 100 will serve as the definitive measure of Canada's most popular songs, continuing our magazine's longstanding tradition of using the most comprehensive resources available to provide the world's most authoritative music charts.\\" The Billboard Canadian Hot 100 is managed by Paul Tuch, director of Canadian operations for Nielsen BDS, in consultation with Silvio Pietroluongo, Billboards associate director of charts and manager of the Billboard Hot 100. ==Song achievements== ===Songs with most weeks at number one=== 19 weeks * Lil Nas X featuring Billy Ray Cyrus ‚Äì \\"Old Town Road\\" (2019) 16 weeks * The Black Eyed Peas ‚Äì \\"I Gotta Feeling\\" (2009) * Ed Sheeran ‚Äì \\"Shape of You\\" (2017) * Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee featuring Justin Bieber ‚Äì \\"Despacito\\" (2017) 15 weeks * Mark Ronson featuring Bruno Mars ‚Äì \\"Uptown Funk\\" (2015) 13 weeks * Timbaland featuring OneRepublic ‚Äì \\"Apologize\\" (2007‚Äì08) * Robin Thicke featuring T.I. and Pharrell ‚Äì \\"Blurred Lines\\" (2013) * The Chainsmokers featuring Halsey ‚Äì \\"Closer\\" (2016) 11 weeks * Rihanna featuring Calvin Harris ‚Äì \\"We Found Love\\" (2011‚Äì12) * OMI ‚Äì \\"Cheerleader\\" (2015) 10 weeks * Maroon 5 featuring Christina Aguilera ‚Äì \\"Moves like Jagger\\" (2011) * Pharrell Williams ‚Äì \\"Happy\\" (2014) * Drake ‚Äì \\"God's Plan\\" (2018) * Maroon 5 featuring Cardi B ‚Äì \\"Girls Like You\\" (2018) * Roddy Ricch ‚Äì \\"The Box\\" (2020) ===Number-one debuts=== * Eminem, Dr. Dre and 50 Cent ‚Äì \\"Crack a Bottle\\" (February 21, 2009) * Taylor Swift ‚Äì \\"Today Was a Fairytale\\" (February 20, 2010) * Young Artists for Haiti ‚Äì \\"Wavin' Flag\\" (March 27, 2010) * Eminem ‚Äì \\"Not Afraid\\" (May 22, 2010) * Katy Perry featuring Snoop Dogg ‚Äì \\"California Gurls\\" (May 29, 2010) * Britney Spears ‚Äì \\"Hold It Against Me\\" (January 29, 2011) * Lady Gaga ‚Äì \\"Born This Way\\" (February 26, 2011) * Katy Perry ‚Äì \\"Part of Me\\" (March 3, 2012) * Justin Bieber ‚Äì \\"Boyfriend\\" (April 14, 2012) * Taylor Swift ‚Äì \\"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\\" (September 1, 2012) * Katy Perry ‚Äì \\"Roar\\" (August 31, 2013) * Eminem featuring Rihanna ‚Äì \\"The Monster\\" (November 16, 2013) * Taylor Swift ‚Äì \\"Shake It Off\\" (September 6, 2014) * Justin Bieber ‚Äì \\"What Do You Mean?\\" (September 19, 2015) * Adele ‚Äì \\"Hello\\" (November 14, 2015) * Zayn ‚Äì \\"Pillowtalk\\" (February 20, 2016) * Major Lazer featuring Justin Bieber and M√ò ‚Äì \\"Cold Water\\" (August 13, 2016) * Ed Sheeran ‚Äì \\"Shape of You\\" (January 28, 2017) * DJ Khaled featuring Justin Bieber, Quavo, Chance the Rapper and Lil Wayne ‚Äì \\"I'm the One\\" (May 20, 2017) * Taylor Swift ‚Äì \\"Look What You Made Me Do\\" (September 16, 2017) * Post Malone featuring 21 Savage ‚Äì \\"Rockstar\\" (October 7, 2017) * Drake ‚Äì \\"God's Plan\\" (February 3, 2018) * The Weeknd ‚Äì \\"Call Out My Name\\" (April 14, 2018) * Drake ‚Äì \\"Nice for What\\" (April 21, 2018) * Childish Gambino ‚Äì \\"This Is America\\" (May 19, 2018) * Maroon 5 featuring Cardi B ‚Äì \\"Girls Like You\\" (June 16, 2018) * Drake ‚Äì \\"Nonstop\\" (July 14, 2018) * Kanye West and Lil Pump ‚Äì \\"I Love It\\" (September 22, 2018) * Eminem ‚Äì \\"Killshot\\" (September 29, 2018) * Kodak Black featuring Travis Scott and Offset ‚Äì \\"Zeze\\" (October 27, 2018) * Ariana Grande ‚Äì \\"Thank U, Next\\" (November 17, 2018) * Ariana Grande ‚Äì \\"7 Rings\\" (February 2, 2019) * Jonas Brothers ‚Äì \\"Sucker\\" (March 16, 2019) * Billie Eilish ‚Äì \\"Bad Guy\\" (April 13, 2019) * Travis Scott ‚Äì \\"Highest in the Room\\" (October 19, 2019) * The Scotts, Travis Scott and Kid Cudi ‚Äì \\"The Scotts\\" (May 9, 2020) * Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber ‚Äì \\"Stuck with U\\" (May 23, 2020) * Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande ‚Äì \\"Rain on Me\\" (June 6, 2020) * DJ Khaled featuring Drake ‚Äì \\"Popstar\\" (August 1, 2020) * Cardi B featuring Megan Thee Stallion ‚Äì \\"WAP\\" (August 22, 2020) * Drake featuring Lil Durk ‚Äì \\"Laugh Now Cry Later\\" (August 29, 2020) * Justin Bieber featuring Chance the Rapper ‚Äì \\"Holy\\" (October 3, 2020) ===Artists with the most number-one hits=== #

When she reaches the Warner Bros. lot, she finds to her disappointment that Bugs is tied up in filming Knighty Knight Bugs but offers to work out a solution after filming wraps up. Meanwhile, Daffy Duck, partially overhearing the conversation, eagerly offers Granny his services, but always dresses up in the wrong Easter-related outfit (such as an Easter egg or an Easter basket). Still tied up after filming two more shorts, Bugs decides to suggest other Looney Tunes stars, who are likewise unable or unsuited. In the end, Bugs offers to serve as the bunny's replacement if the work can be delayed until a week after Easter; Granny considers this unacceptable, but the Easter Bunny, apparently well, arrives, and thus Bugs's services are no longer needed. In the end, the supposed Easter Bunny reveals himself to be Daffy in an Easter bunny suit (finally getting it right), which neither surprises nor disappoints Bugs or Granny, having known all along it was Daffy. ==Cartoons featured== The cartoons featured in the special are: *Knighty Knight Bugs *Hillbilly Hare *Bully For Bugs *Tweety's Circus *Birds Anonymous *For Scent-imental Reasons *Rabbit of Seville *Little Boy Boo *Robin Hood Daffy *Sahara Hare ==Home media== This special was released on DVD in 2011. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1977 television specials Category:1970s American television specials Category:Animated television specials Category:CBS television specials Category:Looney Tunes television specials Category:Easter fiction Category:Television specials by DePatie‚ÄìFreleng Enterprises Category:Films scored by Milt Franklyn ","title":"Bugs Bunny's Easter Special"},{"id":"11649060","text":"Kneller is a surname.

Along with Christopher Magee (1848‚Äì1901), his political partner, the two ran the Republican Party machine that controlled the city for the final twenty years of the 19th century. ==Early life== He was born in Manchester, England, on May 26, 1851, to John Flinn, an Irish immigrant, and Mary Hamilton Flinn, an Englishwoman by birth. The family emigrated later that year to the United States and settled in Pittsburgh's Sixth Ward, famous for its hard-scrabble politics, where his father established a small contracting business. Educated in the Pittsburgh Public Schools, Flinn dropped out at age 9 to deliver newspapers, shine shoes, and later apprentice in the gas and steam fitting trades. ==Politics== Flinn became politically active in the Republican Party as a ward boss collecting stray votes. He soon attained office in 1877 as a member of the Board of Fire Commissioners.William Flinn Papers Finding Aid, 1898-1921, AIS.1968.10, Archives Service Center, University of Pittsburgh Flinn quickly partnered with Christopher Magee, the city's Republican Party political boss. In 1877, he was elected to the State House to represent the Pittsburgh area by holding one of Allegheny County's allotted at-large seats. In 1882, Flinn was appointed chairman of the executive committee of the Pittsburgh Republican party, a position he held for the next 20 years, and in 1890 he was elected to the Pennsylvania State Senate, where he sponsored the Good Roads Act, which became law in 1895. He remained there until his resignation in 1902. From 1884 until 1912 he served as a delegate to every Republican National Convention. He was elected chairman of the State Republican Party at its May 1912 convention. His election was seen as a victory for the progressive wing of the party, which essentially took control of the party away from the more conservative Boies Penrose. Penrose, who had previously served as state committee chairman himself from 1903 through 1905, did not attend the convention, and did not seek re-elected to the post of Republican National Committeeman. Flinn, however, resigned the chairmanship after less than two months in office. A longtime supporter of Theodore Roosevelt, he expressed disappointment that the Republican Party chose not to nominate Roosevelt for President in the 1912 election, and instead nominated incumbent President William Howard Taft. He therefore followed Roosevelt out of the Republican Party, and would later become active in the state's Progressive Party. Penrose, for his part, would go on to wrest control of the State Party from Henry Wasson, one of Flinn's lieutenants who was left to lead the party following Flinn's departure. ==Business== Flinn's chief business interest was large-scale contracting. His firm of Booth and Flinn was formed in 1876 in association with James J. Booth. As a result of politics and a \\"lowest responsible bidder\\" scheme, Booth & Flinn won most large construction and paving contracts in Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania, where they built streets, trolley lines, and bridges, usually amid charges by competitors of graft. The firm built the Liberty Tunnels, Wabash Tunnel, and Armstrong Tunnels in Pittsburgh, and in the later years of the company's continuation, the Holland Tunnel between New York City and New Jersey. (Booth retired from the firm in 1898; George H. Flinn, son of the founder, succeeded him, and in 1924 two other sons, William and A. Rex Flinn joined the company). In The Shame of the Cities, the landmark 1903 book by Lincoln Steffens on political corruption in American cities, Steffens wrote about the alleged Flinn-Magee collusion: \\"Magee wanted power, Flinn wealth...Magee spent his wealth for more power, and Flinn spent his power for more wealth.... Magee attracted followers, Flinn employed them. He was useful to Magee, Magee was indispensable to him....Molasses and vinegar, diplomacy and force, mind and will, they were well mated.\\" Reformers eventually reined in Flinn by passing legislation to curb corruption and kickbacks. Flinn was also president of the Duquesne Lumber Company and the Pittsburgh Silver Peak Gold Mining Company. He sat on the board of directors of the Arkansas Fuel Oil Company, the Arkansas Natural Gas Company, the Gulf Oil Corporation, and the Pittsburgh Coal Company. ==Personal life== He married Nancy Galbraith in 1874 and the couple had seven children: five boys (Howard died at the age of 2 years), two girls. His sons--William, George, Ralph, and A. Rex--became prominent in business, three of them in their father's construction firm. His daughters, Mary and Edith, were important figures in local society. The family home, called Braemar, was in the city Highland Park district. Though raised Roman Catholic, Flinn was a member of Pittsburgh's Sixth United Presbyterian Church. ==Retirement== Flinn's political and business organization began to crumble in the late 1890s when a flap over the rigged bidding system came to a head with Edward Manning Bigelow, director of public works. By the 1902 elections reformers held sway and citizens voted down the machine. Magee himself had died in 1901 after a short illness. Flinn withdrew from local politics, as a result, and retired to a country estate north of the city called Beechwood Farm. He became a gentleman farmer of Guernsey cattle, German police dogs, and Belgian hares. During the winter months Flinn resided in Florida, where at St. Petersburg he died on February 19, 1924, at the age of 72. He is interred at Homewood Cemetery in Pittsburgh. According to the Register of Wills of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County, J.N. Mackrell, Flinn's personal property and real estate at his death exceeded $11 million. Flinn is honored with several monuments throughout the city of Pittsburgh and the Allegheny County segment of Pennsylvania State Route 8 is named the William Flinn Highway. His country estate is now a nature reserve, Beechwood Farms Nature Reserve, operated by the Audubon Society of Western Pennsylvania. Flinn's daughter Mary used some of her inheritance to build a country estate nearby Beechwood called Hartwood; today it is open to the public as a part of Hartwood Acres Park. ==References== * * * Category:1851 births Category:1924 deaths Category:Politicians from Pittsburgh Category:Pennsylvania state senators Category:Members of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives Category:Chairs of the Republican State Committee of Pennsylvania Category:American political bosses from Pennsylvania Category:Pennsylvania Republicans Category:Burials at Homewood Cemetery ","title":"William Flinn"},{"id":"11649097","text":"Alfredo, Alfredo is a 1972 Italian language award-winning comedy film directed by Pietro Germi.

Chambers which followed the publication of Chambers' most famous work, The King in Yellow (1895). It contained eight new stories, including the title story, one of his weird tales, and several romantic Art Nouveau stories, concluding with two less distinguished weird tales. The latter were subsequently incorporated into the episodic novel In Search of the Unknown. The first three stories are linked by the theme of a dream wife named Ysonde, and they form a triptych. The weird nature of the first has interesting echoes in the other two, which feature picturesque animal figures, such as a Red Ibis and a disagreeable porcupine. The story \\"In The Name of the Most High\\" is a war story set in the American Civil War. The next two stories are humorous romantic tales with a fishing theme and setting. Chambers' love of natural scenery illuminates most of the stories. The quality throughout is rather fine. Published by Putnam's, New York and London, in 1896.

Its components are very similar to a desktop PC. The DTV receiver is a vital link in the chain of television system. The goal of a broadcasting system is to concentrate the hardware requirements at the source to simplify the receivers and makes it as inexpensive as possible. It is usually connected to the TV set or incorporated in the TV set. The main features of a DTV receiver may be classified as follows: *decodes the incoming digital signal; *verifies access rights and security levels; *displays cinema quality pictures on the TV set; *outputs digital surround sound; *processes and renders Internet and interactive TV services. ==Overview== The tuner in the box receives a digital signal from a cable, a satellite, or terrestrial network and isolates a particular channel. The signal is then forwarded to a demodulator and converted to binary format. Once in binary format, the demodulator will check for error and forward the binary signal to a demultiplexer that will extract audio, video, and data from the binary stream. Once the demultiplexer has finished with the signal, the decoders will transform the digital bits into a format suitable for viewing on the television set. As the architecture of a DTV receiver can vary in function of the network operator or the set-box manufacturer, we have chosen to divide the physical components into the following categories: *system board, *tuner, *modulator and demodulator, *demultiplexer and decryptor, *decoders, *graphics processor, *CPU and memory, *storage devices, *physical interfaces, *physical characteristics. ==Architecture== ===System board=== All the main hardware components of the receiver are connected to the system board. Buses are used to carry the digital TV information between the hardware components. ===DTV Tuner=== The ATSC tuner module is available for accessing QAM-, OFDM, and QPSK-based networks. In addition to receiving inputs from digital networks, most tuners are also capable of tuning analog broadcasts. Tuners can be divided into three broad categories: *‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô‚ÄôBroadcast In-band (IB) Tuner.‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô Once the signal arrives from the physical transmission media, the IB tuner will isolate a physical from a multiplex of channels and convert to baseband. The term ‚Äò‚Äôbaseband‚Äô‚Äô is used to describe a single channel or digital signal, extracted from broadband signal which is a stream of multiple channels. *‚Äô‚Äô‚ÄôOut Of Band (OOB) Tuner.‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô This type of tuner facilitates the transfer of data between the head-end systems and the set-box. They are widely used in cable set-top boxes for providing subscribers with medley of interactive services. Implementations of the OOB tuner tend to operate within 100 to 350 MHz frequency band. *‚Äô‚Äô‚ÄôReturn Path Tuner.‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô This tuner allows a subscriber to activate the return of path and send data back to the interactive services provider. Implementations of this tuner tend to operate within the 5 to 60 MHz frequency band. ===Modulator and demodulator=== The function of the demodulator is to convert the analog signal to a digital bitstream. Then, it checks for errors and forward the bitstream to the demultiplexer. The modulator reverses the actions of a demodulator and its function is to deliver a signal to the return path tuner. ===Demultiplexer and decryptor=== The technology used in DTV television is MPEG-2. The demultiplexer selects particular packets, decrypts, and forwards to a specific decoder. ===Decoders=== A DTV receiver will normally contain three separate decoders for converting the digital bit-stream back into a format that can be heard and viewed by the subscriber. A video decoder‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô It transforms video packets into a sequence of pictures, which are displayed by the TV monitor. An audio decoder‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô It decompresses the audio bit-stream. Different audio modes are usually supported by the DTV receiver: mono and dual channel, stereo, and joint stereo. A data decoder. ‚Äò‚Äô‚ÄôGraphics Processor‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô The main purpose of a graphics processor is to render a range of Internet file formats and proprietary interactive TV file formats. ===Central processing unit=== The CPU, like in a desktop PC, is the brain of the DTV receiver. Functions provided by a CPU include: *initializes the various hardware components; *processes a range of Internet and interactive TV applications; *monitors and manages hardware interrupts; *fetches data and instructions from memory; *runs various programs. ===Memory=== As a computer, a DTV receiver needs memory to store and manipulates instructions.

(18 May 1905 ‚Äì 5 October 1993) was a Roman Catholic Cardinal and Archbishop of Palermo (and later Cardinal Bishop of the title of suburbicarian see of Albano). ==Biography== He was born in Palazzolo Acreide, Sicily, Italy as the third of five children of Salvatore Carpino, who was the owner of a small rural estate. He was educated at the Seminary of Noto from 1914 to 1919. He continued to 1926 his studies at the Pontifical Roman Seminary in Rome, where he earned doctorates in philosophy and theology and a licentiate in canon law. He returned to his diocese in 1926 and became professor in the local seminary, until he reached the canonical age for the priestly ordination. He received the diaconate on 29 June 1927, and was ordained on 14 August 1927. ==Priesthood== After his ordination he worked in pastoral ministry in the diocese of Noto and as a faculty member of its seminary from 1927 until 1929. He was appointed that same year professor of sacramental theology at the Pontifical Lateran Athenaeum, where he remained until 1951. During his time in Rome he worked in pastoral ministry as well as with several congregations of the Roman Curia. He was created Privy Chamberlain of His Holiness on 27 April 1939. ==Episcopate== Pope Pius XII appointed him titular archbishop of Nicomedia and coadjutor bishop of Monreale on 11 February 1951. He succeeded to the metropolitan see of Monreale on 23 August of that year. In 1961 he was named Titular Archbishop of Sardica and appointed Secretary of the Sacred College of Cardinals on 25 October 1961, thus he served as secretary of the 1963 papal conclave. He was a counselor of the Pontifical Preparatory Commission of the Second Vatican Council from 1961 until 1964. He attended the Second Vatican Council. Pope Paul VI appointed him Pro-Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments on 7 April 1967. ==Cardinalate== He was created Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria Ausiliatrice in Via Tuscolana (a deaconry elevated pro hac vice to title) in the consistory of 26 June 1967 by Pope Paul VI. That same day he was appointed Archbishop of Palermo. He resigned the government of the archdiocese, in 1970. He explained that an archdiocese with many difficult pastoral problems needed a young archbishop to prepare programs for the long term. He was named Cardinal Bishop of the title of the suburbicarian see of Albano on 27 January 1978. He took part in the conclaves that elected Pope John Paul I and Pope John Paul II in August and October. He lost the right to participate any future conclaves when turned 80 years of age in 1985. He died on 5 October 1993 in Rome. His funeral mass, presided over by Pope John Paul II, and concelebrated by thirty cardinals and numerous archbishops and bishops, took place in the patriarchal Vatican basilica at 5:30 pm on 7 October 1993. The cardinal's body was flown to Monreale on 8 October and transferred to Palermo, where another funeral took place in that cathedral celebrated by Salvatore Cassisa, archbishop of Monreale, and Cardinal Salvatore Pappalardo, archbishop of Palermo, and almost all the bishops of Sicily. After the funeral in Palermo, the body was taken to Palazzolo Acreide and a requiem mass was celebrated in the church of San Paolo by Giuseppe Costanzo, archbishop of Siracusa, before the burial in the tomb of his family. On 14 September 1998, the remains were transferred to the metropolitan cathedral of Palermo. ==References== Category:1905 births Category:1993 deaths Category:People from Palazzolo Acreide Category:Italian cardinals Category:Cardinal-bishops of Albano Category:Participants in the Second Vatican Council Category:20th-century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:Pontifical Roman Seminary alumni Category:Roman Catholic archbishops of Palermo Category:Members of the Congregation for the Discipline of the Sacraments Category:Members of the Congregation for Bishops Category:Cardinals created by Pope Paul VI ","title":"Francesco Carpino"},{"id":"11649193","text":"The Bugs Bunny Mystery Special is an animated television special that was broadcast on CBS October 26, 1980. Presented by Porky Pig as an Alfred Hitchcock-style whodunit, the plot is modeled after those of North by Northwest and The Fugitive. Like most Looney Tunes specials of the time, this program consists of clips from classic cartoons with some new original animation holding them together. ==Plot synopsis== A criminal known as the Tall, Dark Stranger robs a bank, and Inspector Elmer Fudd mistakenly arrests Bugs Bunny for the crime. Escaping from jail, Bugs sets out to prove his innocence while evading Elmer, who is searching for him after his escape. Soon word spreads about Bugs Bunny being a national fugitive. When a reward gets placed on his head \\"eaten or alive\\", this inspires Wile E. Coyote to hunt him down, and Elmer also hires Yosemite Sam as a bounty hunter. After some chases and a side story involving Sylvester and Tweety, Bugs ends up dangling from the beak of a Mount Rushmore-sized sculpture of Foghorn Leghorn; he‚Äôs rescued by the Tall, Dark Stranger, who turns out to be Porky Pig (he was trying to keep the story going).

He was sired by the Chilean horse Cougar, who enjoyed his greatest success in North America and was inducted into the U.S. Racing Hall of Fame. His dam Peacefully also produced the Prix Morny winner Tersa and was distantly related to the Melbourne Cup winner Beldale Ball. Gato Del Sol was owned and bred by Stone Farm proprietor Arthur B. Hancock III in partnership with one of his longtime clients, Manhattan real estate broker Leone J. Peters.https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE7DC1F3DF934A35755C0A96E948260 The two men also bred Risen Star, winner of the 1988 Preakness and Belmont Stakes. He was trained by Eddie Gregson. ==Racing career== ===1981: two-year- old season=== Gato Del Sol made his debut at Hollywood Park in 1981 and lost his first two races. In his third start, at Del Mar Racetrack, he won for the first time. After a third-place finish in the Balboa Stakes, he won the Del Mar Futurity. ===1982: three-year-old season=== In his three-year-old campaign, Gato del Sol was winless going into the Kentucky Derby but had been second in the Blue Grass Stakes at Keeneland Race Course. Given little chance by Churchill Downs bettors against the favored Wood Memorial Stakes winner Air Forbes Won, Gato Del Sol was sent off at odds of 21-1, the third longest in the race. He trailed the nineteen-horse field in the 1¬º mile race early but under jockey Eddie Delahoussaye began making a move after half a mile. By the mile pole, he had moved up to fifth place. He continued to gain ground as the field moved down the homestretch, with six horses spread across the track racing head-to-head. By the final furlong marker, Gato Del Sol had moved to the lead by a half-length and then pulled away to win by 2¬Ω lengths. He paid $44.40 to win, the 10th highest payoff in Derby history. Following his Derby win, Gato Del Sol's handlers decided to bypass the Preakness Stakes with its shorter distance. Instead, they rested their horse for the 1¬Ω mile Belmont Stakes. Their decision marked the first time in twenty-three years that the Kentucky Derby winner did not try for the Triple Crown. Gato Del Sol finished second in the Belmont Stakes, fourteen lengths behind Henryk de Kwiatkowski's colt, Conquistador Cielo. Gato Del Sol raced on the New York circuit for the remainder of the 1982 season. After he finished eighth in the Suburban Handicap, his training was taken over by Howard Tesher.Los Angeles Times ‚Äì July 16, 1982 Gato Del Sol then won an allowance race at Saratoga Race Course on August 7 as a tuneup for his run in the prestigious Travers Stakes.Miami News ‚Äì August 7, 1982 That year, the entries included each of the winners of the three American Classics. In addition to Derby winner Gato Del Sol, the competition included Preakness Stakes victor Aloma's Ruler and Belmont Stakes winner Conquistador Cielo. However, Canadian outsider Runaway Groom won, becoming the first horse in American racing history to defeat the winners of the three classics in the same race. Gato Del Sol, who finished fifth, came out of the race with an ankle injury that ended his 1982 season. ===Later career=== He returned to race on the West Coast in mid-May 1983. He won two of nine starts, including the Cabrillo Handicap at Del Mar Racetrack, then in 1984 was switched to running on turf. He went winless, notably finishing eighth in the 1984 Breeders' Cup Turf. In his fifth year of racing, Gato Del Sol started twice, finishing second in the Shoemaker Breeders' Cup Mile Stakes and winning the 1985 Caballero Handicap at Hollywood Park Racetrack, his career finale. ==Retirement and stud record== Retired to stud duty at Stone Farm, Gato Del Sol had little success as a sire. He was eventually sold and in 1993 ended up at a breeding operation in Germany, where he continued to underperform. In 2000, his original co-owner, Arthur Hancock III, and his wife Staci bought Gato Del Sol back in order to eliminate any possibility that he be subjected to the same fate as another American champion, Exceller, who was killed in a Swedish slaughterhouse. Pensioned, Gato Del Sol spent the remainder of his days on the farm where he was foaled. On August 7, 2007, he was euthanized because of health complications at the age of 28. ==Pedigree== ==References== * Stone Farm tribute to Gato Del Sol * Gato Del Sol's Kentucky Derby details and video at the Churchill Downs official Derby website ==Trivia== * Not only was Gato del Sol the first Derby winner for Arthur Hancock III, he was the first Derby winner owned by a member of the famed Hancock family of Claiborne Farm, whose business was primarily breeding. Arthur later won a second Derby title as owner of Sunday Silence. * Stone Farm is a sponsor of the University of Kentucky Solar Car Team, with Gato Del Sol serving as the namesake for the local team's solar-powered cars. * Gato Del Sol was the partial namesake of Gastr Del Sol; Post Rock outfit headed by Louisville native David Grubbs.

Two distinct populations are known to exist, one in eastern Liaoning province of northeastern China, and one in the central mountains of the Korean Peninsula. Within South Korea, it is found in eastern Gyeonggi (specifically Gapyeong) and also in Gangwon-do (particularly the Odaesan mountain complex). In addition, it is expected that there are or have been additional populations in the region between central Korea and Liaoning. The classification of the Korean water toad into the genus Bufo was challenged in a 2006 paper. However, no alternative classification was proposed and the species is at present provisionally allocated to Bufo. The Korean water toad is found inland, at elevations from 200 to 700 meters above sea level. As its name suggests, it favors water, and is typically found in wooded riparian areas. Breeding and egg-laying take place in the waters of streams and rivers. The water toad is typically nocturnal, but is also active during the day during the summer rains. Because of their superficial similarity to frogs, Korean water toads are sometimes eaten. However, like other toads, they are poisonous. A case of severe poisoning from a digoxin- like immunoreactive substance was reported in 1998. ==References== stejnegeri Category:Frogs of China Category:Amphibians of Korea Category:Amphibians described in 1931 Category:Taxa named by Karl Patterson Schmidt ","title":"Korean water toad"},{"id":"11649276","text":"Clinton \\"C.

It was first published in 1918Buttel, p. 226. and is therefore in the public domain. ==Interpretation== In his 1968 book for Princeton University Press, Buttel remarks, \\"One would not expect such lyrical delicacy from the Imagist use of the spittle of cows.\\"Buttel, p. 227. Its finding beauty in seemingly ordinary or earthy physical details puts him in mind of Whitman's \\"Song of Myself\\" and the line from its thirty-first canto: \\"And the cow crunching with depress'd head surpasses any statue\\". Stevens's concern about the sound of the poem is evident here, as in \\"The Comedian as the Letter C\\", where, among other things, he was exploring the different effects of the letter \\"c\\" in English. Here he invokes nonsense lines, suggesting the call-and-response of mating birds, to achieve the desired effect. One reason why Stevens might flout Victorian poetic conventions about treatment of spring is suggested by Bates, one of whose themes is the importance of appreciating Stevens the American burgher. He relates an anecdote about Stevens writing to William Carlos Williams, quoting Stevens about the pleasures of a season in Nashville, where he was then staying. > I spare you the whole-souled burblings in the park, the leaves, lilacs, > tulips, and so on. Such things are unmanly and non-Prussian and, of course, > a fellow must pooh-pooh something, even if it happens to be something he > rather fancies, you know.Bates, p. 87.

A number of sections come into force two months after royal assent and the first commencement order made under the Act specified that section 31 came into force on 1 November 2007. ==The green paper== The green paper is available as a .pdf document from the links at the end of the article. The Government's objectives for the Act, as stated in the green paper were to: *Reach 80% employment amongst all people of working age (it was just shy of 75% when the paper was released). *To reduce the numbers claiming incapacity benefit by 1 million (from 2.7 million at the time). This was later stated to be achieved \\"within a decade\\" Hutton, Parliamentary debate on Green Paper. *To help 300,000 lone parents back into work. *To increase the number of older workers, aged fifty or over, in work by 1 million. ==Provisions, aims and criticisms of the Act== The Act is wide- ranging and affects a large swathe of the population, particularly those dependent on housing benefit and those suffering from physical and mental ill health and disability. ===Changes to provision of Housing Benefit=== The Local Housing Allowance method of assessing benefit will be applied across the de- regulated private rented sector nationwide. Currently housing benefit is sent directly to landlords, not the tenants. The Act will change this so that rent money is paid to the tenant who will then be expected to pay this to the landlord. One of the stated motivations for this change is that it will give tenants an appreciation of the sums involved in their benefit claims and this will foster greater social responsibility. Criticism of this change has focused on vulnerable people such as drug addicted people (who may find the temptation of finding alternative uses for the money too great to withstand) and those with mental health problems (who may find the new responsibility difficult or impossible to fulfil). The Act also introduces a housing benefit sanction for those who are found guilty of anti-social behaviour; benefit can be withdrawn and/or the tenants can be evicted. ===Abolition of Incapacity Benefit=== The Act replaces Incapacity Benefit with a new benefit, Employment and Support Allowance. The new benefit will require that regular effort is made by (non-exempted) claimants to seek work or take part in work-related assessments and regularly meet with an advisor. Those failing to do so may see a reduction of their benefit. The medicals carried out to see who is eligible for the benefit will be made more stringent. Criticism of the changes has been broad. Charities working with vulnerable people have welcomed the Government's pledge to assist the disabled into work but are concerned that there is a lack of funding for this support and that, in the end, there will be more coercion than help. Critics are broadly in agreement that employers remain very wary of taking on disabled or mentally ill people and much more needs to be done to change this. ===Older people and single mothers=== The stated aims of the legislation were to increase the numbers of older people (50+) and single mothers in employment - two groups that face particular difficulties in returning to work. ==See also== *Welfare Reform Act ==References== ==External links== *The Welfare Reform Act 2007, as amended from the National Archives. *The Welfare Reform Act 2007, as originally enacted from the National Archives. *Explanatory notes to the Welfare Reform Act 2007. ===Parliamentary documents and debates timeline=== ====Structure==== The links in this section include only primary documents relating to the debate within Parliament.

The property was bounded by Keith Wilson Road and Vedder Road and was intended as a Canadian Army post for defending the Lower Mainland of British Columbia. Camp Chilliwack was created only two months after the Empire of Japan's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, launching the Pacific Theatre of World War II. The swift succession of Japanese operations in the Aleutian Islands and a submarine presence off the west coast of North America, coupled with the fall of Hong Kong took the Department of National Defence by surprise. The Canadian military's presence in British Columbia was restricted at that time to the Royal Canadian Navy base at Esquimalt on southern Vancouver Island plus a chain of RCAF land-based and flying boat stations including Sea Island (Vancouver), Victoria, Allingford Bay, Bella Coola and Prince Rupert. The rapid flow of events during late 1941 and early 1942 saw the United States military presence in the Pacific Northwest expand dramatically, with corresponding increases in Canada to meet the perceived Japanese threat. One manifestation was the agreement in February 1942 by both nations to construct the Alaska Highway as a defence project, followed by the Royal Air Force's decision to construct RAF Station Comox to boost Commonwealth air defence for Canada's west coast. Camp Chilliwack opened several months later and housed several army units for territorial defence. But it soon became apparent as 1942 wore on that the Japanese threat to mainland North America was minor. Consequently, Camp Chilliwack was also designated as a recruit training centre and hosted the No. 112 Canadian Army Basic Training Centre, as well as the A6 Canadian Engineering Training Centre (which was moved from Camp Dundurn in Saskatchewan). During the postwar years and into the Cold War, Camp Chilliwack continued to operate as a permanent training establishment for the Canadian Army, as well as providing support to regular and reserve army units in British Columbia. The A6 Canadian Engineering Training Centre was renamed the Royal Canadian School of Military Engineering. In 1957, the 58th Field Engineer Squadron moved from the navy base at Esquimalt to Camp Chillwack. In 1968 Canada unified its military forces when it merged the Canadian Army, Royal Canadian Air Force and Royal Canadian Navy to create the Canadian Forces. Camp Chilliwack was renamed \\"Canadian Forces Base Chilliwack\\" (CFB Chilliwack) to reflect the new organization. The Royal Canadian School of Military Engineering was renamed the Canadian Forces School of Military Engineering following unification and in 1970 the Canadian Forces Officer Candidate School (CFOCS) moved to CFB Chilliwack. In 1977 3 Field Squadron was renamed 1 Combat Engineer Regiment. CFB Chilliwack took responsibility for supporting all Canadian Forces units in the lower mainland of British Columbia, including the Jericho Beach Garrison in Vancouver. In 1994, the 3rd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry moved to CFB Chilliwack from Esquimalt, the last new unit to transfer to the facility. Flags at CFB Chilliwack memorial cenotaph at Keith Wilson and Vedder 2018 ==Closure== Defence budget cutbacks and force consolidation following the end of the Cold War saw CFB Chilliwack identified in the mid-1990s as a candidate for closure by 1997. The CFOCS was moved to ASU St- Jean while the CFSME was moved to CFB Gagetown and 3PPCLI moved to CFB Edmonton. The base consisted of two separate properties; the Vedder Creek location was the main part of the base and was mothballed, whereas the Chilcotin training area and firing ranges were kept by DND for use by local reserve units in the Vancouver area. Area Support Unit Chilliwack (ASU Chilliwack) was established on September 2, 1997 at the Vedder Creek property to provide support to reserve and regular force units on mainland British Columbia, while the remainder of the Vedder Creek property has been transferred to the Canada Lands Company for disposal and is currently being developed into a residential subdivision named \\"Garrison Crossing.\\" After the closure of CFB Chilliwack, the Royal Engineer Log Building was moved by 6 Field Squadron from CFB Chilliwack to the Six Field Engineer Squadron Museum Association's Armoury in 2000. It was originally built in 1860 to provide accommodation for the Royal Engineer team surveying the 49th parallel between Canada and the United States. ==Post office== CFB Chiliwack had a Military Post Office (MPO) from July 1944 to August 1946.

The bill was portrayed as a compromise between providing a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and increased border enforcement: it included funding for of vehicle barriers, 105 camera and radar towers, and 20,000 more Border Patrol agents, while simultaneously restructuring visa criteria around high-skilled workers. The bill also received heated criticism from both sides of the immigration debate. The bill was introduced in the United States Senate on May 9, 2007, but was never voted on, though a series of votes on amendments and cloture took place.

The bill's sole sponsor in the Senate was Majority Leader Harry Reid, though it was crafted in large part as a result of efforts by Senators Kennedy, McCain and Kyl, along with Senator Lindsey Graham, and input from President George W. Bush, who strongly supported the bill. For that reason it was referred to in the press by various combinations of these five men's names, most commonly \\"Kennedy‚ÄìKyl\\".

This effectively ended its chances, and President Bush said he was disappointed at Congress's failure to act on the issue. ==Changes to immigration policy== S.1639 would have created a new class of visa, the \\"Z visa\\", that would be given to everyone who was living without a valid visa in the United States on Jan. 1, 2010; this visa would give its holder the legal right to remain in the United States for the rest of their lives, and access to a Social Security number. After eight years, the holder of a Z visa would be eligible for a United States Permanent Resident Card (a \\"green card\\") if they wanted to have one; they would first have to pay a $2,000 fine, and back taxes for some of the period in which they worked. By the normal rules of green cards, five years after that the illegal immigrant could begin the process of becoming a U.S. citizen. S.1639 would have required such an illegal immigrant to be in his or her home country when he or she applies for a green card. S.1639 would have also ended family reunification, in which an immigrant who becomes a U.S. citizen can ease the process by which their relatives from outside the country can get green cards. Under the bill, only the spouse and children of a new citizen would be made eligible for green cards.Major provisions of compromise plan, The Mercury News, May 18, 2007 S.1639 would eliminate the employer- sponsored component of the immigration system and replace it with a point- based \\"merit\\" system. Points would be awarded by the USCIS adjudicating officers for a combination of education, job skills, family connections and English proficiency. Sponsorship of a U.S. employer would not be required although additional points would be awarded if a U.S. job offer was available. The labor certification process would also be eliminated. Several family-based immigration categories would also be folded into the point system. Points- based systems are already used for admitting skilled immigrants in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and other developed countries. ===Guest worker program=== Another new category of visa, the \\"Y visa\\", would have been created, that would let temporary guest workers stay in the country for two years, after which they would have to return home. The original bill set this program at 400,000 people a year. However, its scope was greatly reduced by two amendments passed by the Senate: the first, sponsored by Senator Jeff Bingaman, reduced the number of entrants to 200,000 a year;\\"Senate Cuts Guest- Worker Plan in Immigration Measure\\", Jay Newton-Small, Bloomberg News, May 23, 2007 the second, sponsored by Senator Byron Dorgan, set the program to only run for five years. ===Increased enforcement=== The bill would have increased enforcement of the United States-Mexico border, including increasing the number of border patrol agents by 20,000 and adding another of fencing, among others. The bill would have also created a new program, the \\"Employment Eligibility Verification System\\", that would be a central database meant to hold immigrant-status information on all workers living in the United States. Eventually all employers, regardless of size of the company, would have been required to assemble this information and keep the system updated on all their employees.Work bill would create new ID database, Anne Broache and Declan McCullagh, CNET News, May 21, 2007 Under the terms of the bill, no further part of the bill would have gone forward until these measures had been implemented. A group of conservative Republican senators, led by Jim DeMint, claimed that a majority of the enforcement provisions in the bill were already required under previous law, including the 2005 REAL ID Act and the 2006 Secure Fence Act.DeMint, Eight Senate Colleagues Challenge Bush to do Immigration Bill's Border Protection Now, Mark Tapscott, Tapscott's Copy Desk, June 12, 2007 ===DREAM Act provisions=== The bill contained within it the entirety of the DREAM Act, a bill that has been introduced unsuccessfully several times in the House and Senate, that would provide a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants brought into the country as minors who either go to college or serve in the U.S. military; it would also restore states rights in determining eligibility for in-state tuition. The DREAM Act has four basic requirements, which are: * Must have entered the country before the age of 16; * Must graduate high school or obtain a GED; * Must have good moral character (no criminal record); and * Must have at least five years of continuous presence in the US. ==Criticism== The bills received heated criticism from both the right wing and the left wing. Conservatives rejected providing a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, as it would reward them for disregarding United States immigration laws. Liberals criticized the points-based system and provisions limiting family reunification visas available to only nuclear family members of US citizens as unfair. Labor unions, human rights, and some Hispanic organizations attacked the guest workers program, claiming that it would create a group of underclass workers with no benefits. Another criticism of the guest workers program was that because each guest worker is required to return home for a year before renewing his or her visa, these workers would instead overstay their visa, becoming illegal immigrants. High-tech industry criticized the point-based green card system for scrapping employer sponsorship of green card applications and eliminating priority processing for the highly skilled workers specifically selected by the U.S. employers. \\"Visa Plan angers Silicon Valley\\", SFGate.com, June 7, 2007 Many immigration practitioners, while supporting aspects of the proposal, criticized the bill as \\"unworkable\\" and called for fundamentally revising it.Statement of AILA, American Immigration Lawers Association June 20, 2007 Critics of the bill in the U.S. Senate also complained that the Senate consideration of the bill did not follow the usual procedure, as the bill did not go through the committee debate and approval process and the opportunities to offer floor amendments were limited.\\"Senate Takes Time Before Vote on Compromise Immigration Reform Bill\\" Foxnews.com May 21, 2007 \\"Senate Votes to Revisit Contentious Immigration Bill\\" PBS.org transcript, June 26, 2007 ==Film== \\"Last Best Chance\\", story 12 in How Democracy Works Now: Twelve Stories, a documentary series from filmmaking team Shari Robertson and Michael Camerini, centers around Ted Kennedy's efforts to pass the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007.

Traveling north‚Äìsouth, it serves as a connector route from U.S. Route 64 (US 64) to Hertford and from US 13 to Gatesville. ==Route description== Albemarle Sound Bridge NC 37 is a predominantly two-lane rural highway which travels from US 64 near Beasley to US 13 near Gates. Beginning at exit 548, along US 64, NC 37 travels northeasterly for before running concurrent with NC 32 and NC 94 near Pea Ridge. Crossing over the Albemarle Sound and entering Chowan County from Washington County, NC 94 splits off towards the Northeastern Regional Airport, followed by NC 32 which heads directly towards Edenton. Entering Perquimans County, it merges with US 17 for a concurrency. Connecting with the city of Hertford, it switches concurrences with U.S. Route 17 Business (US 17 Bus.) in Winfall. After a concurrency, it travels solo again as it goes through downtown Winfall then northeasterly through Belvidere. At Gliden, it rejoins NC 32 for a short concurrency, entering Gates County and through Mintonsville, before separating again at Mitchells Fork. Traveling through the communities of Willow and Vivian, it goes through downtown Gatesville, where it shares a short concurrency with US 158 Bus. Continuing north, it connects with US 158 at Eleanors Crossroads. After traveling through the communities of Buckland and Gates, it ends at US 13 from the Virginia state line. NC 37 shares part of the Edenton-Windsor Loop where it crosses the Albemarle Sound (indicated by a Scenic Byways sign). The loop, which connects to nearby Edenton and Windsor, showcases historic sites, like the Cupola House and the Rehoboth Methodist Church, and scenic views of the Inner Banks. NC 37 is also part of the Historic Albemarle Tour, though no actual historic sites or museums are located along its route. ==History== NC 37 was established in 1934 as a renumbering of NC 321 from US 17 in Winfall to SR 53 at the Virginia state line. In 1940, NC 37 was extended south in concurrency with US 17 into Chowan County, where it then replaced a segment of NC 172 to NC 32 in St. Johns. In 1952, NC 37 was truncated at US 13, from the Virginia state line. In March 1987, NC 37 was rerouted onto new bypass route, in concurrency with US 17, east of Hertford. North of Hertford, it then shares a concurrency with US 17 Bus. before returning on its routing towards Winfall; its old alignment was replaced by US 17 Bus. In June 2016, NC 37 was extended south from St. Johns, in a concurrency with NC 32 and NC 94, into Washington County near Beasley; it splits onto new primary routing to its southern terminus at US 64's exit 548. ===North Carolina Highway 321=== North Carolina Highway 321 (NC 321) was an original state highway that traversed from NC 342, in Winfall, northwest to NC 32, in Gilden. In 1928, NC 321 was extended northwest, on new primary routing, to NC 30, in Gatesville. In 1932, NC 32 was extended north again, on new primary routing, to the Virginia state line; the following year Virginia extended SR 53 to the state line to connect with NC 321. In 1934, because of US 321 existing in the state, NC 321 was renumbered to NC 37. ==Major intersections== ==See also== * North Carolina Bicycle Route 4 - concurrent with NC 37 from Walton Crossroads to Gatesville at NC 137 ==References== ==External links== * * NCRoads.com: N.C. 37 * NCRoads.com: N.C. 321 037 Category:Transportation in Washington County, North Carolina Category:Transportation in Chowan County, North Carolina Category:Transportation in Perquimans County, North Carolina Category:Transportation in Gates County, North Carolina Category:Historic Albemarle Tour ","title":"North Carolina Highway 37"},{"id":"11649438","text":"Trendspotting is a British fashion and culture magazine based in the East End of London.

It is a statewide community development corporation (CDC). It has staff of nearly 900 and impacts more than 375,000 people every year throughout Arizona, Nevada, and New Mexico. == History == In 1967 (Incorporated in 1969), a group of young Latino men and women came together to collectively strategize on how to improve the quality of life for Arizona‚Äôs Mexican-American population. Out of many meetings and long hours of discussion, Chicanos Por La Causa, (CPLC) was born. Recognizing their desire and dedication, the Southwest Council of La Raza, which would later grow to become the National Council of La Raza, made an initial investment in the newly formed organization. With the financial assistance, CPLC implemented programs targeting rural development issues. Additionally, CPLC lent much needed support to Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers. Within a year, CPLC expanded its services by offering bilingual referral services to the impoverished, urban communities located in South and Central Phoenix. Through assistance from the Ford Foundation, local financial institutions, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), CPLC began developing its own programs targeting economic and workforce development as well as housing counseling. Growth within CPLC continued all through the 1970s. With the assistance of an energized Board of Directors with valuable knowledge in community development and fiscal expertise, CPLC secured a significant federal grant to implement its comprehensive economic development strategy in the battle against poverty. By capitalizing on Phoenix‚Äôs rapid growth, the organization laid the foundation for the CPLC we know today. Aggressive fundraising strategies and fiscal responsibility helped CPLC to survive the federal cutbacks administered in the 1980s. Under the stewardship of its executive management and strong Board of Directors, CPLC has grown to become the state‚Äôs largest Hispanic community-based organization with services and/or programs operating in all of fifteen Arizona‚Äôs counties. Today, CPLC maintains a strong commitment to its communities, having built a wide cadre of services within four major service areas‚Äîeducation, economic development, social services and affordable housing. It is one of the few non- profit organizations operating in Arizona that offers programs and services impacting every stage in the human life-cycle. == References == == External links == * Category:Chicano Category:Mexican-American culture in Arizona Category:Mexican-American organizations Category:Non-profit organizations based in Arizona ","title":"Chicanos Por La Causa"},{"id":"11649490","text":"Football Fans Census (sometimes known as FFC), is the trading name of Football Fans Central Ltd, a smallWebCHeck - Select and Access Company Information market research company which specialises in research into the views and opinions of English football supporters.

His weekly parenting column is syndicated in approximately 225 newspapers, and he has authored 15 books on the subject. His ideas revolve around the ideas of authority for the parents and discipline for children. Rosemond grew up in Charleston, SC, and the suburbs of Chicago. He attended Western Illinois University, graduating in 1971 with a master's degree (M.S.) in Community Psychology. At Western Illinois University, Rosemond sang lead in a popular campus band, Herkemer Bog, where he met his future wife at a concert. From 1971 to 1980, Rosemond worked as a therapist and program director at various mental health centers in Illinois, Iowa, and North Carolina. He began writing his newspaper column in 1976, while Director of the Early Intervention Program at the Gaston-Lincoln Mental Health Center in Gastonia, NC. In 1978, the Charlotte Observer purchased the column and put it into syndication a year later. It now appears weekly in over 200 newspapers in the USA. From 1980 to 1990, Rosemond was in private practice as a family therapist. He is licensed as a psychological associate in the state of North Carolina. == Books == Rosemond has authored or co-authored fifteen books, including: Books as sole author: * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Books with others: * == Radio == Rosemond's radio show on parenting, \\"Because I Said So!\\" aired on American Family Radio on Saturdays at 6pm EST until July 2018. == Criticism == Rosemond has received criticism for his recommendations on toilet training and spanking because they contradict other parenting experts' recommendations as well as the official evidence-based policy of the American Psychological Association. Rosemond's statements on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder also have been criticized for being inaccurate; Rosemond says the disorder does not exist. In 1992, Rosemond wrote a column in which he stated that an 18-month-old girl who had been sexually abused on one occasion by a non-family member (babysitter) was unlikely to ever remember the event; therefore, therapy was not called for. Rosemond's advice was in line with research into human memory which finds that regardless of the nature of an event, permanent memory does not form until around age 36 months, on average. However, it directly contradicts years of research indicating that preverbal trauma has lifelong psychological and neurodevelopmental effects, especially if untreated. In 2013, the Kentucky Psychology Board initiated a letter to Rosemond from the Attorney General of Kentucky, charging Rosemond with practicing psychology in Kentucky without a license issued by them. The charge was based solely on the fact that Rosemond's syndicated column appears in five Kentucky newspapers. Rosemond sued the Kentucky Psychology Board and Attorney General in federal court, charging them with attempting to suppress his First Amendment rights. He subsequently released the Attorney General from the suit. The Psychology Board refused to back down and the case went to court. Rosemond won in October 2015. ==References== ==External links== *website Category:Living people Category:American family and parenting writers Category:1947 births Category:Writers from Charleston, South Carolina Category:Writers from Chicago Category:Western Illinois University alumni Category:People from Gastonia, North Carolina ","title":"John Rosemond"},{"id":"11649568","text":"Erica Larson Baron (born August 11, 1971) is a chemist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory and a champion mountain runner.

This is the protagonist of the film, Benedict Parisi, whose first name seems prophetic of his story. In the waiting room is the companion Joan Micheli, pregnant with him, which--Benedict being alone in the world--gives consent to the risky operation. Her mother, Immaculate, however, hovers in the wings like a vulture, hoping he will die, because she aspires to marry Giovanna off to a lawyer friend of the family, as a better social and economic proposition. The narrative is interwoven with flashbacks to the early life of Benedict. He is an orphan, a lively lad growing up in village in the Latin Valley, under the tutelage of a maiden aunt who is filled with religious scruples, though given to libertine assignations, with which she indoctrinates him. The child is sleepless at night, because of noises from his aunt's room, which is visited by local men: his aunt instead tells him that the noises are a matter of remorse for his bad habits, and he is overcome by guilty feelings resulting from his repressive environment. When the day of his first communion nears, for which he prepares with accentuated religious devotion, he, with the other communicants, is given an effigy of \\"celestial friends,\\" saints who are expected to assist them until they embrace Jesus. Benedict receives the effigy of Saint Eusebius. On that very night the boy is awoken by noises - one of the aunt's lovers, Giovanni, happens to be visiting. He runs to his aunt's room, and she hides the man in her closet. But the intruder's presence is soon revealed, and the aunt papers over his presence in her room by claiming that in fact Giovanni is St Eusebius. Benedict is told not to inform the priest of what happened, -to do so would only offend the \\"celestial friends\\" by what would be a sin of pride. The next morning, while he is affixing a picture of St Eusebius in her wardrobe to commemorate the occasion, he has a glimpse of his aunt, who returns from the bath, in a state of nakedness. She discovers him, and warns him not to say anything to the priest, even in the confession which will be the prelude to his first communion. This prohibition leads to him refraining from telling all of his 'sins' in confession to Father Quirino, and, ashamed by a sense that he has committed a sacrilege, during the first communion he feels that the host has stuck in his throat, and in a panic at incipient suffocation, runs away, only to slip from a wall and fall into a ravine Despite local fears that he has come to a sorry end, he emerges unharmed, and the people proclaim that he has been the beneficiary of a miracle. The boy is dressed up like the saint, and carried in procession, as though he were a veritable icon. The aunt exploits the opportunity this concatenation of coincidences affords her, by ridding herself of this troublesome burden, by sending him to the Franciscan monastery, where he then grows up to maturity. Among the friars, who take to admiring him for his simplicity and naivety, he works as a labourer. The brotherhood await for some 'sign' that will indicate his vocation in life. During a visit by a travelling salesman, Uncle Checco, h catches a glimpse in the car, of a photo of a nude woman, and the vision, together with his fantasies of being at the wheel of a vehicle that travels daily throughout the wider world of the countryside below, disturbs him. It provokes his desire, and also his fears of leaving the security of the monastery. While working in the fields one day, a schoolteacher is bitten by a snake, and pleads with him to save her. He kills the snake (symbol of the primal temptation) and, when he explains to her that the venom must be sucked out through an incision, proceeds to suck her upper calf, spitting the poison out, yet massaging her legs in a frenzy of barely disguised ardour. He has, he tells the friar in a drunken moment, found the sign they were all waiting for. He joins Uncle Checco and travels about seeling cloth and undergarments.

The female form is gopnitsa () and the collective noun is gopota (). The subculture of gopniks has its roots in the late Russian Empire and evolved during the 20th century in many cities in the Soviet Union. As of the late 2010s, the subculture has faded for the most part, although youth gangs (such as the A.U.E.) that resemble gopniks still exist in Russia and in other Slavic and Baltic countries. ==Etymology== Gopnik is most likely derived from the Russian slang term for a street robbery: gop-stop (). However, it could also be related to GOP, the acronym for the Gorodskoye Obshchestvo Prizora. These were almshouses for the destitute created by the Bolshevik government after the October Revolution in 1917. According to Dahl's Explanatory Dictionary, a Russian explanatory dictionary (first published in the 19th century), an old slang word for \\"sleeping on street\\" was \\"–≥–æ–ø–∞—Ç—å\\" (gopat', literally \\"to gop\\") something that was related to the \\"mazuricks\\" or the criminals of Saint Petersburg.

Gopniks are often associated with cheap alcohol, such as low-quality vodka and light beer, cheap cigarettes, low-end mobile devices, and sometimes firearms. They also utilize common Russian profanities and often behave rudely. Gopniks favor Lada Classics as their primary means of transport.

It should not be confused with the extant Leeds Building Society (formerly Leeds and Holbeck Building Society) ==History== Originally the Leeds was known as The Leeds Building and Investment Society which was to have been a temporary terminating society which would have been disbanded but demand soon outstripped the society's ability to build and The Leeds was converted to a permanent status. On 8 November 1848, the new permanent Society, known as the Permanent Second Leeds Benefit Building Society, was officially founded. By the end of its first year, 1,200 members had enrolled, and ¬£14,286 (). had been advanced on mortgages. The Society's first offices were located in Exchange Buildings in Lands Lane, where business was conducted from 10am to 4pm, and also 7pm to 9pm on Tuesdays. They later moved to 32 Park Row, and then in 1876, to premises at the corner of Park Lane and Calverley, where the Society was to remain for the next 50 years. In 1930, head office moved to newly constructed premises at the corner of Cookridge Street and The Headrow ‚Äì Permanent House - designed by Sir Reginald Blomfield and local architect C.W. Atkinson. Permanent House was the Leeds‚Äô home until the move to new premises in Lovell Park in 1992. The founders of the Leeds Permanent were 'not men who let the grass grow under their feet'. Within six months, the Society had opened more than eight agencies across neighbouring towns, including Wetherby, Barnsley and Huddersfield. By the time of its tenth birthday in 1858, the Society had 3,500 members and was proudly proclaiming itself to be the largest building society in the world. The competent management of the Society won it a high reputation at national level, and in 1871, the Society was asked to give evidence to a Royal Commission in London, which was gathering evidence on the operations of friendly societies. The Leeds was specially commended by the Commission as a model society. By the early years of the 20th century, the Leeds had assets of almost ¬£2 million, and the first telephones and electric lighting had been installed at its head office. The interwar years saw a period of unprecedented growth. Agents were appointed all over Britain and branch offices opened in virtually every major city, including London, Birmingham, Edinburgh and Manchester. Between 1920 and 1940, total assets increased to over ¬£40 million, while membership increased more than tenfold to over 200,000. Sir Charles Davies, one of Leeds‚Äô best known public figures, oversaw much of the growth and charted the future direction of the Leeds during this time. The 1940s onwards saw the Leeds involved in a series of mergers with other societies, including the London North Eastern Railway Building Society, the Doncaster Building Society and the Midland Building Society. The 1950s and 1960s also saw another phase of branch expansion, with the Leeds' 100th branch opening in 1970. Expansion to its Leeds Head Office took place in this period which included the construction of various adjacent annexes to its 1930s HQ including the 61 m tall Leeds Permanent Tower (these annexes were demolished as part of the works to create The Light around 2000). HBOS offices in Lovell Park, Leeds, formerly that of the Leeds Permanent Building Society, before their takeover by the Halifax in 1995 Technology too was beginning to make an impact. In 1964 the board approved a research project to investigate the conversion of mechanical accounting to electronic data processing. The Society's first computer was subsequently installed in 1967. Like many other Building Societies, the Leeds later took advantage of changes brought by the Building Societies Act 1986, diversifying its business into share-selling, off-shore banking, estate agency and property development. Further amalgamations were considered in the 1980s and early 1990s including the Southdown Building Society which proceeded, but others were not forthcoming. It had a notable television advertising campaign featuring George Cole in the same period which featured the slogan Laughing all the way to The Leeds. In 1993 a new head office at Lovell Park replaced the Leeds's previous head office on The Headrow which was eventually replaced with The Light shopping and leisure complex. Then in 1995, the Leeds merged with the Halifax Building Society, which shortly afterwards converted to plc status. After its merger with the Halifax the use of the Leeds Building Society name had ceased. In turn the Halifax had merged with Bank of Scotland to form HBOS in 2001 which in turn became part of Lloyds Banking Group in 2009 due to the collapse of its share price and exposure to the credit crunch. ==References== Category:Banks established in 1846 Category:Organizations established in 1846 Category:Banks disestablished in 1995 Category:Defunct companies based in Leeds Category:1846 establishments in England Category:1995 disestablishments in England Category:British companies disestablished in 1995 Category:British companies established in 1846 ","title":"Leeds Permanent Building Society"},{"id":"11649799","title":"Keith J.

He served at Auschwitz as chief of the Central Construction Office of the Waffen-SS. While there he was chief of construction of the Auschwitz II-Birkenau camp. ==Biography== Born in Neuhemsbach near Kaiserslautern, Germany. At the age of twenty, he joined the Luftwaffe. In 1935 he obtained a job at the Luftwaffe Construction Bureau. During the early years of the Second World War, he was involved in the building of air bases in France. In this position he met SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer Hans Kammler, who was responsible for the SS-Amt II (Building), which later became Amtsgruppe C of the WVHA. Kammler offered Bischoff a leading post at Auschwitz. In October 1941 Bischoff arrived in Auschwitz, where he became chief of the Central Construction Office of the Waffen-SS and the Police Auschwitz in Upper Silesia (for i. Zentralbauleitung der Waffen SS und Polizei, Auschwitz O/S) that had to implement the planned enlargement of the concentration camp by the creation of a POW camp, which itself later became part of the Auschwitz II-Birkenau camp. He showed his ambition shortly after his arrival by claiming the enormous budget of 20 million Reichsmarks. Unlike his predecessor, Bischoff was an extremely competent and dynamic bureaucrat. Despite all of the difficulties caused by the war, the building activities deemed necessary during the next years were all carried out by Bischoff and his staff. The giant Birkenau camp, the four big crematoria, the technically complicated central sauna, the new reception building in the Stammlager and hundreds of other buildings, were planned and realized. For instance, Bischoff laid out the construction plans for the building of Auschwitz II-Birkenau with an original tally of 550 prisoners in each barrack (this meant that each prisoner had one-third the amount of space that he or she was allotted in other Nazi German concentration camps). He changed this tally to 744 prisoners per barrack. The SS designed the barracks not so much to house people as to destroy them.'Orders and Initiatives' (2005) Auschwitz: The Nazis and 'The Final Solution' Ep. 2. BBC Television In 1943 the chief builder of the crematoria was able to inform his superiors in Berlin about the success of the operation: when the old crematorium in the Stammlager was included, 4,756 persons could be burned within 24 hours in five crematoriaHow do we know what the capacities of the cremation ovens at Auschwitz-Birkenau were?. In 1944, Bischoff was awarded the War Merit Cross, 1st class, but shortly afterward he was informed that further plans for Auschwitz had to be reduced to those facilities considered absolutely necessary. The faltering German position at the Eastern Front did not favour further development in the area. In April 1944 he left Auschwitz and became chief of the building bureau of the Waffen- SS in Silesia and Bohemia at Katowice. He remained there until the end of the war. Although almost all of the archives of the Auschwitz building office fell into the hands of the Soviets after the camp was liberated by the Red Army in January 1945, Bischoff remained in the shadows after the war ended. His involvement at Auschwitz went unrecognized until his death in Bremen in 1950. ==References== Category:1897 births Category:1950 deaths Category:People from Kaiserslautern (district) Category:Auschwitz concentration camp personnel Category:SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer Category:Waffen-SS personnel ","title":"Karl Bischoff"},{"id":"11649828","text":"John Gunter was secretary-manager of Middlesbrough F.C. from February 1909 to June 1910.

The term \\"shy\\" was suggested by the American mathematician John Milnor. ==Definitions== ===Prevalence and shyness=== Let V be a real topological vector space and let S be a Borel- measurable subset of V. S is said to be prevalent if there exists a finite- dimensional subspace P of V, called the probe set, such that for all v ‚àà V we have v + p ‚àà S for ŒªP-almost all p ‚àà P, where ŒªP denotes the dim(P)-dimensional Lebesgue measure on P. Put another way, for every v ‚àà V, Lebesgue-almost every point of the hyperplane v + P lies in S. A non-Borel subset of V is said to be prevalent if it contains a prevalent Borel subset. A Borel subset of V is said to be shy if its complement is prevalent; a non- Borel subset of V is said to be shy if it is contained within a shy Borel subset. An alternative, and slightly more general, definition is to define a set S to be shy if there exists a transverse measure for S (other than the trivial measure). ===Local prevalence and shyness=== A subset S of V is said to be locally shy if every point v ‚àà V has a neighbourhood Nv whose intersection with S is a shy set. S is said to be locally prevalent if its complement is locally shy. ==Theorems involving prevalence and shyness== * If S is shy, then so is every subset of S and every translate of S. * Every shy Borel set S admits a transverse measure that is finite and has compact support. Furthermore, this measure can be chosen so that its support has arbitrarily small diameter. * Any finite or countable union of shy sets is also shy. * Any shy set is also locally shy. If V is a separable space, then every locally shy subset of V is also shy. * A subset S of n-dimensional Euclidean space Rn is shy if and only if it has Lebesgue measure zero. * Any prevalent subset S of V is dense in V. * If V is infinite-dimensional, then every compact subset of V is shy. In the following, \\"almost every\\" is taken to mean that the stated property holds of a prevalent subset of the space in question. * Almost every continuous function from the interval [0, 1] into the real line R is nowhere differentiable; here the space V is C([0, 1]; R) with the topology induced by the supremum norm. * Almost every function f in the Lp space L1([0, 1]; R) has the property that ::\\\\int_{0}^{1} f(x) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} x eq 0. :Clearly, the same property holds for the spaces of k-times differentiable functions Ck([0, 1]; R). * For 1 < p ‚â§ +‚àû, almost every sequence a = (an)n‚ààN in ‚Ñìp has the property that the series ::\\\\sum_{n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}} a_{n} :diverges. * Prevalence version of the Whitney embedding theorem: Let M be a compact manifold of class C1 and dimension d contained in Rn. For 1 ‚â§ k ‚â§ +‚àû, almost every Ck function f : Rn -> R2d+1 is an embedding of M. * If A is a compact subset of Rn with Hausdorff dimension d, m ‚â• d, and 1 ‚â§ k ‚â§ +‚àû, then, for almost every Ck function f : Rn -> Rm, f(A) also has Hausdorff dimension d. * For 1 ‚â§ k ‚â§ +‚àû, almost every Ck function f : Rn -> Rn has the property that all of its periodic points are hyperbolic. In particular, the same is true for all the period p points, for any integer p. ==References== * * Category:Measure theory ","title":"Prevalent and shy sets"},{"id":"11649915","text":"Women for Women International (WfWI) is a nonprofit humanitarian organization that provides practical and moral support to female survivors of war. WfWI helps such women rebuild their lives after war's devastation through a year- long tiered program that begins with direct financial aid and emotional counseling and includes life skills (e.g., literacy, numeracy) training if necessary, rights awareness education, health education, job skills training and small business development. ==History== In 1993, Women for Women International was co-founded by a husband and wife, Amjad Atallah and Zainab Salbi, an Iraqi American who is herself a survivor of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. They were motivated to act after learning of the plight of women in rape camps during the Yugoslav Wars and the slow response of the international community. WfWI launched its activities by creating \\"sister-to-sister\\" connections between sponsors in the United States and women survivors of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In its first year, Women for Women International worked with eight women, distributing about $9,000 in direct aid. As the organization gained experience, its staff came to understand that financial assistance alone was not a sufficient response for women who had lost everything. Women survivors of war, especially those left widowed, also needed to cultivate an understanding of their rights and potential as women, develop marketable skills, and find a way to generate stable income.\\"Charity of the Month - Woman Power\\" The Family Groove, 20 May 2006. From 2012 to 2014, WfWI was led by Afshan Khan, a long-time former executive with UNICEF who became WfWI's first new CEO since founder Zainab Salbi stepped down to devote more time to her writing and lecturing.\\"Women for Women International Names Afshan Khan New CEO.\\" PrWeb, 30 April 2012. Laurie Adams is the current chief executive officer. Headquartered in Washington, DC, WfWI also has executive/fundraising offices in London, UK and Hamburg, Germany and programmatic offices in eight post-conflict countries: Afghanistan (program inception 2002); Bosnia and Herzegovina (1994); Democratic Republic of Congo (2004); Iraq (2003); Kosovo (1999); Nigeria (2000); Rwanda (1997); and South Sudan (2006). As of 2015, the charity has helped about 449,000 marginalized women in countries affected by war. ==How it works== Women for Women International connects women with other women a conflict zone and the sponsor sends money every month to this sister. The participants enroll in a one-year program designed to help them gain the skills, confidence, psychological healing, and mutual support needed to rebuild their lives after war. After the program they become leaders in their communities: Participant women are placed in groups (usually around 25) which become their permanent support network. Each group goes through an educational program to learn about their rights and role in the economic, social, and civic life of their communities. They learn about health and wellness practices. Those who need it receive basic literacy or numeracy training to help them prepare for the second tier of the program. Next, each woman receives vocational and business training consistent with clear goals she herself has laid out in her Individual Participant Plan. This phase of training is designed to strengthen existing skills and introduce new ones in both traditional and nontraditional fields. Vocational skills engage women in agriculture, livestock, food processing, various jobs in the service industry, textile and handcrafts, and other livelihoods. As of June 30, 2011, WfWI had disbursed $103 million to some 317,000 women participants. The program is paid for through a mix of individual \\"sister to sister\\" direct sponsorships and grants from governmental, multilateral, foundation, corporate, and individual donors.\\"Women for Women International Supports Women of South Sudan on Country's First Anniversary\\" Yahoo News, 9 July 2012. ==Key outcomes== Women for Women International's in-house Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E;) department measures WfWI performance against four key outcomes: Women Earn an Income; Women are Well, Women are Decision-Makers; and Women Have Safety Nets. M&E; findings as of September 2011: 1\\\\. Women Earn an Income GOAL: Through WfWI's vocational skills programs, women have access to market-based skills training, job placement services and business startup resources. ACTUAL: :Average Daily Income : - On average, graduates report an average daily income of $1.44, compared to $0.37 at enrollment. :Savings : - On average, 88% of graduates report having some of savings, compared to 26% at enrollment. 2\\\\. Women are Well GOAL: Graduates report increases in their knowledge and practice of behaviors that promote health, including reproductive health, nutrition, and stress management. ACTUAL: :Knowledge of nutrition : - On average, 91% of graduates report having knowledge of good nutrition, compared to 31% at enrollment. 3\\\\. Women are Decision-makers GOAL: WfWI's rights education program equips women with the knowledge and skills required to access the opportunities available to them, such as acquiring control over land, or participating in community and national decision-making. ACTUAL: :Knowledge of rights : - At graduate, 95% of women report knowing and understanding their rights, compared to just 28% at enrollment. 4\\\\. Women Have Social Networks and Safety Nets GOAL: At graduation, women both by themselves and in solidarity with others, aid the cause of women by promoting and advocating shared needs and desires. ACTUAL: :Participation in social networks or safety groups : - At graduation, 59% of women report participation in social networks or groups, compared to only 28% at enrollment. ==Other activities== Along with its direct service to women program participants, Women for Women International uses its voice to educate the public about war's effects on women, particularly around the use of mass rape as a weapon of war. WfWI also seeks to raise awareness about the unique role that women play in advancing peace throughout society. WfWI leadership have testified before the US Congress and executive branch about women's issues and their intersection with foreign policy. WfWI executives also regularly speak at international conferences, panels and in the media. High-profile special events (e.g., the \\"Join Me on the Bridge\\" rallies held each year on International Women's Day), print and broadcast coverage, and books (Zainab Salbi's The Other Side of War) are all tactics in WfWI's strategy of building global understanding about women's indispensable role in civil society. Since 2016, WfWI has held an annual charity sale to raise money for women survivors of war. The 2017 sale raised over US$224,000. ==Awards== In September 2006, Women for Women International was the first women's organization to receive the Conrad Hilton Humanitarian Award, the world's largest humanitarian prize of $1.5 million. The Conrad N. Hilton Foundation presents the annual award to an organization that \\"significantly alleviates human suffering.\\"Hanley, Delinda C. \\"Women for Women Wins Hilton Humanitarian Prize\\". Washington Report on Middle East Affairs, December 2006. Retrieved 2016-10-02. \\"Women and children bear the major burdens of the unprecedented number of wars and civil conflicts raging worldwide and are often left to rebuild their lives without the basic necessities for survival or a viable means to earn a living and take care of their families,\\" said Steven M. Hilton, chairman and CEO of the Hilton Foundation. \\"Women for Women International has demonstrated that it can create change and stability within a society by providing women survivors with the tools and resources to rebuild their lives. The organization also gives women the training and confidence to engage in their communities', and ultimately their nation's economic, political and social structures,\\" he added. When Salbi, WfWI founder, accepted the award she said: \\"It reinforces our vision that stronger women build stronger nations, and encourages us to work harder to bring the voices and concerns of the women we serve to the forefront. Amartya Sen, Nobel Laureate and Hilton Prize juror also commented on the selection saying women of war is a neglected issue and WfWI has identified the need and has gone on to protect millions of lives. ==References== ==External links== *Women for Women International homepage *The Other Side of War {dead link} written by Zainab Salbi, forward by Alice Walker, published by National Geographic, photography by Susan Meiselas, Sylvia Plachy and Lekha Singh . *Charity Navigator Rating *Guidestar Basic Listing *Financial Report for 2017 Category:Humanitarian aid organizations Category:Women's organizations based in the United States Category:Non-profit organizations based in Washington, D.C.

The treaty would last for five years in the first instance, and at the end of that period it would be terminable at six months' notice. This friendship with India does not find reflection in Afghanistan's relations with Pakistan. Pakistan feels that Afghanistan is too tolerant of the so-called independent Pashtunistan movement, which has for its aim the creation of a Pashto-speaking enclave and therefore a new state to be carved out of Pakistan territory. Afghanistan develops closer relations during the year with Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Iran. ==July 1950== On 17 July 1950, the USSR and Afghanistan signed a 4-year Trade Agreement providing for duty-free transit of Afghan goods through Soviet territory.Afghanistan relaxed her traditional cautious and suspicious attitude toward her northern neighbor. She agreed resignedly, if not reluctantly, to expand her trade with the Soviet Union in a four-year trade agreement signed in July, 1950'' R.K.Ramazani.

The prime minister of Pakistan, Liaquat Ali Khan, in disclosing that a protest has been sent to Kabul on what he describes as the culminating incident in a number of minor frontier violations, declares that Pakistan is willing to discuss economic and cultural questions of common concern to the two countries.

The group released nine studio albums over its 20-year existence. ==Biography== New Radiant Storm King formed at Hampshire College in 1990, taking its name from a radiator label. Its original lineup was Peyton Pinkerton (vocals, bass), Matt Hunter (vocals, guitar), Eli Miller (guitar), and Elizabeth Sharp (drums). The band made itself known in the college rock movement, of which Western Massachusetts was a hub, and opened for Nirvana during the band's stop at Hampshire for its 1990 Bleach tour. In 1992, Storm King recorded a full-length album, One Day Rust, on the American division of Rough Trade, but the division folded before the record could be released. Miller left the band and the remaining members recorded another album, My Little Bastard Soul, which was picked up by Axis Records and released in 1993 as Storm King's official debut. After Axis folded, Storm King signed to Grass Records and put out a second album, Rival Time, in 1993. \\"The Opposing Engineer (Sleeps Alone),\\" one of the tracks off that record, inspired Guided By Voices' \\"I Am a Scientist.\\" In 1995, the two bands recorded covers of each other's songs and released them on a split single. Sharp left Storm King after its third album, August Revital, came out in 1994, and was replaced by Jeremy Smith. Together the new lineup released 1996's Hurricane Necklace, which is perhaps the band's most popular album. Storm King toured England and Scotland in 1998. That year, Wormco reissued My Little Bastard Soul along with a bonus disc, The Castle, composed of sketches and instrumentals composed for a production of Howard Barker's \\"The Castle\\", directed by Joshua Goldberg at Hampshire College. Garrett Fontes replaced Smith and the new quartet released Singular, No Article in 1999. That lineup continued for some years and put out 2002's Winter's Kill (which Darla calls the band's \\"second most popular album\\") and 2004's Leftover Blues. Between these albums, the members engaged in other projects. Pinkerton toured with the Pernice Brothers and Hunter toured with The Wharton Tiers Ensemble. By 2006, Storm King's lineup had shifted to include Caleb Wetmore (bass) and Patrick Berkery (drums). That year, Storm King released The Steady Hand, recorded at Slaughterhouse Recording Studio. Blogger Dave Heaton of Erasing Clouds called an \\"intelligent and dynamic,\\" \\"fully realized rock album.\\"http://www.erasingclouds.com/wk0106nrsk.html The album's song \\"The Winding Staircase\\" was featured on the soundtrack of the 2006 movie Catch and Release. The music video for the Steady Hand track \\"Quicksand Under Carpet,\\" directed by Jay Hollinsworth, won the award for best \\"Music Video: Animation/Rock 'n' Roll\\" at the 2007 Maverick Movie Awards.http://www.maverickmovieawards.com/archives23.html J.J. O'Connell replaced Berkery to become the group's final drummer. The band's last album, Drinking in the Moonlight, was also recorded at Slaughterhouse and released on October 7, 2008 on Darla Records. Storm King played its final show at Iron Horse Music Hall in Northampton, Massachusetts in 2010. ==Following== Once expected by some to be \\"'next big thing' in indie rock,\\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5774-winters-kill/ Storm King instead maintained a cult following throughout its years.http://blurtonline.com/review/new-radiant-storm-king-drinking-in-the- moonlight/ Critic Kevin Hopper wrote in 1996 that Storm King \\"belong[s] to an elite group of 'alternative' bands that would otherwise shine were it not for the multiplicity of bands of their ilk.\\" Critic Tom Kielty called them \\"one of the Bay State's best-kept musical secrets\\" in 2002. \\"The Opposing Engineer (Sleeps Alone)\\" was covered and released by Guided by Voices in 1995.http://www.bradleysalmanac.com/index.php/2011/05/live-mp3s-new-radiant- storm-king-rip-in-cambridge-ma/ \\"The Winding Staircase\\" was featured on the soundtrack of the 2006 movie Catch and Release. ==Related Projects== Hunter and Pinkerton were the guitarists on the 1996 Silver Jews album The Natural Bridge.

He was portrayed by Taylor Nichols. ==Victims== * Janet Kent (1987) ‚Äì an art student who was taught by, and dated, Cody Lewis * Marcia Reese (1987) ‚Äì another student at WLVU * Charlene Roth (1988) - killed by John Mathers executed 15 years later * Debbie Reston (2002) ‚Äì killed on the day of John Mathers' execution * Jonathan Avery Haywood (III) (2004) ‚Äì killed by mistake due to resemblance to Kaitlin Rackish * Kaitlin Rackish (2004) ‚Äì a student of Cody Lewis ==Modus operandi== The killer applies blue house paint to railings in the fictional Western Las Vegas University campus; he chooses the railings because they are near a water fountain. Motor oil is mixed into the paint to slow the drying process. He waits for the female victim to touch the railing and then, with the victim attempting to wash the paint off her hand at the water fountain, he attacks her, binds and gags her, bundles her into a van and drives away from the site. He then stops the van outside an erotic boutique and sketches while his victim pleads for mercy. He draws her while he sits in the driver's seat looking at her through the rear view mirror as she struggles in the back. He then sexually assaults her before strangling her to death. After he kills his victim, he dumps her, in a black garbage bag, around Las Vegas and sells his sketches to the owner of the boutique. The exception to this M.O. is Jonathan Avery Haywood III, killed in \\"What's Eating Gilbert Grissom?\\". As Haywood is mistaken for Kaitlin Rackish, the killer does not assault or sketch him and disposes of the body by feeding it into a wood chipper on campus. ==Suspects== ===John Mathers=== John Mathers, from his police mugshot (Capt. Jim Brass standing to the left) John Mathers was a security guard who worked at WLVU in 1987, when the killings began. He was arrested and convicted in 1988 after one of his hairs was found on Charlene Roth's body. He remains on Death Row for 15 years, until he is executed for Charlene Roth's murder (\\"The Execution of Catherine Willows\\"). However, another victim (Debbie Reston) is found on the day of the execution. Believing Mathers to be a copycat of the real killer, the CSIs tried to find the real culprit; due to a lack of evidence, however, the case goes cold. Following another pair of murders in \\"What's Eating Gilbert Grissom?\\", it transpires that Mathers and Greer are partners. They are clearly quite close, with Greer referring to his partner as \\"JM\\", although he also says that capture and execution is \\"the price you pay for being incompetent\\".Gil Grissom determines that Kevin Greer is the \\"alpha male\\" of the two partners, and Mathers only sexually assaulted the first three victims and therefore a miscarriage of justice occurred when Mathers was executed.It is assumed later that Mathers receives a posthumous pardon for Charlene Roth's murder although he is not convicted of the murders of Janet Kent and Marcia Reese. ===Cody Lewis=== Lewis (David Lee Smith) is an art professor at WLVU who dated the first victim, Janet Kent, and taught art to Kaitlin Rackish and several of the other victims.Season 5, episode 6, \\"What's Eating Gilbert Grissom?\\" He was originally in the frame for the 1987‚Äì88 murders but was later exonerated by the same DNA evidence which convicted John Mathers. ==Kevin Greer's background and story== Kevin Greer worked at the WLVU's campus from 1983 to 2004, and was the only employee of the press to have worked there for more than 10 years when he was caught. He also had a job writing explicit comic books for a sex shop, under the pseudonym of Zippy T. He commits the first murder at the approximate age of 16 prior to the events of \\"The Execution of Catherine Willows\\", estimated from the show's chronology to be in 1987. In 1988, John Mathers is arrested and placed on death row for 15 years; in that time Greer stopped his killing spree, so that Mathers would die and take the blame to his grave. On the day of Mathers' execution, Greer kills his fourth victim, Debbie Reston. Although he intends to kill one victim every year on that day, he does not do so in 2003 because unsuccessful LASIK surgery had temporarily damaged his eyesight (he elected to have the surgery because Debbie Reston broke his glasses in a struggle). The following year, however, he kills Jonathan Haywood, mistaking him for his intended target Kaitlin Rackish because Haywood had long hair and Greer's poor post-LASIK night vision led him to mistake Haywood for a woman. He later tracks Kaitlin down and kills her, but the evidence that he leaves behind at the crime scene (photocopier toner from the WLVU press) leads to his arrest. After SWAT raids his house, Greer leaves a phone message saying that he would be waiting for Grissom at the police station. When Grissom and Brass arrive, Greer greets them as \\"Gil\\" and \\"Jim\\", and taunts them about their search. Greer then promises to lead the officers to the location of a sixth victim, Brit Mosscoe. However, this is a ruse (Brit Mosscoe is an anagram of \\"Miss October\\", from a calendar hanging in Greer's garage). He asks to go to the bathroom before he leaves, and although an officer escorts him into the facilities, he goes unattended into a cubicle. After Sara Sidle calls Catherine to inform the others of the deception, Grissom and Brass break into the cubicle and find Greer with a black plastic bag tied around his head. They tear the bag off and attempt CPR, but Greer is already dead. Returning to the interrogation room, Grissom finds a drawing which, when folded, reveals a picture of Grissom and the word \\"goodbye\\". ==Related pages== *CSI: Crime Scene Investigation *List of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation characters ==References== ==External links== Category:CSI: Crime Scene Investigation characters Category:Fictional artists Category:Fictional serial killers Category:Fictional rapists Category:Television characters introduced in 2002 Category:Fictional suicides ","title":"The Blue Paint Killer"},{"id":"11650151","text":"Charles Henry Weeks \\"Chick\\" Manlove (October 8, 1862 ‚Äì February 12, 1952) was a 19th-century Major League Baseball player born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Sapiens (born c. 188 BC), was a Roman statesman, best known for his friendship with the Roman general and statesman Scipio Aemilianus (Scipio the Younger) (d. 129 BC). He was consul of 140 BC, elected with the help of his friend, by then censor, after failing to be elected in 141 BC. Gaius Laelius Sapiens was the son and heir of the Punic War general Gaius Laelius, himself consul in 190 BC. This Laelius had been former second-in- command and long-time friend, since childhood, of the Roman general and statesman Scipio Africanus. The younger Laelius was apparently born around 188 BC, after his father had become consul but had failed to win command of the campaign against Antiochus III the Great of Syria, which would have made him a rich man. His mother's name is unknown. ==Political significance== Laelius was a candidate for the consulship in 141 BC, but withdrew his candidacy thanks to the false promises of a novus homo, Quintus Pompeius (a distant relative of the future Pompey the Great), who promised to also step down but then returned to the field after Laelius had formally withdrawn. Pompeius thus became consul along with Gnaeus Servilius Caepio (of a family traditionally allied with the Cornelii Scipiones), and Scipio Aemilianus suffered a humiliating political reverse. Aemilianus got his friend elected consul in the following year (140 BC) along with Quintus Servilius Caepio, who was the third successive Servilii Caepione brother to become consul in as many years. Laelius was called Sapiens (\\"wise\\") because of his decision not to undertake efforts at political reform that were beginning to create serious dissension in the Roman Senate. These efforts at reform had been initially proposed by Scipio Aemilianus but abandoned by him when the Senate failed to agree unanimously as he had demanded. Laelius was seen as wise because he avoided creating further dissension at the time; however, his unwillingness to stick his neck out led to a political schism within the Scipionic Circle. The reform program abandoned by Scipio and his circle of intimates, including Laelius, were later taken up by the brothers Publius Mucius Scaevola and Publius Licinius Crassus Dives Mucianus, and partially implemented by their relatives by marriage, the Brothers Gracchi. Despite this connection to radical reformers who were killed for their efforts, Laelius's own political significance is slight. Furthermore, Laelius prosecuted Tiberius Gracchus' supporters and opposed Gaius Papirius Carbo's plan to permit the reelection of tribunes. ==Cultural significance== Laelius was a member of the Scipionic Circle, a Graecophile group of friends and political allies who gathered around the wealthy and well-connected Scipio Aemilianus, adoptive grandson of Scipio Africanus. As heir to the most prominent branch of the wealthy Cornelii Scipiones, Scipio Aemilianus was able to act as patron to many Greek scholars, philosophers, and historians, including the Greek historian Polybius and the Carthaginian-born playwright Terence. Laelius's two sons-in-law were both consuls - Gaius Fannius who was consul in 122 BC along with Gaius Sempronius Gracchus, and Quintus Mucius Scaevola Augur, who was consul in 117 BC. The younger son-in- law, himself connected by marriage to the Brothers Gracchi, was a prominent rhetorician and jurist, and the teacher and mentor of young Cicero. Cicero thus learned much about Laelius and his relationships with great men from his mentor Scaevola Augur. Some of those relationships were inspiration and source material for Cicero's treatises on friendship.Project Gutenberg - Treatises on Friendship and Old Age by Marcus Tullius CiceroProject Gutenberg - De Amicitia, Scipio's Dream by Marcus Tullius Cicero In Cicero's later essay De Senectute (On Old Age), Laelius is depicted, alongside his friend Scipio, as admiring Cato the Elder for how well he bears his old age. ==Family== According to Cicero, relying on Mucius Scaevola for first-hand information, the younger Gaius Laelius was married all his life to one woman, whose name is not mentioned. By her, he had two surviving daughters, both of whom married consuls. Cicero states that Laelia Minor, the wife of Quintus Mucius Scaevola Augur, and her two daughters (as well as their daughters) were known for the quality and purity of their Latin. The younger daughter of Scaevola Augur and his wife Laelia was Mucia Secunda, who was wife of Lucius Licinius Crassus, consul in 91 BC, who was patron to the young Cicero. Crassus and his wife Mucia had two surviving daughters, the elder of whom married a praetor Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica, descended from several consuls and censors and had several children including Metellus Scipio. ==References== Category:Roman Republican consuls Sapiens, Gaius Category:Senators of the Roman Republic Category:2nd-century BC Romans Category:Year of death unknown Category:180s BC births ","title":"Gaius Laelius Sapiens"},{"id":"11650157","text":"The GeoRef database is a bibliographic database that indexes scientific literature in the geosciences, including geology.

Following Andy Aitken's departure in February 1909, Boro had been managed by secretary-manager John Gunter for sixteen months before Walker signed on 27 June 1910. Controversy was set to follow Walker throughout his brief time as manager. Soon after his appointment, he was in trouble for illegally approaching one of his former Airdrie players to try to convince him to sign for Boro. He was caught and banned for four weeks, while the club were fined ¬£100. In December 1910, chairman Thomas Gibson-Poole, the local Conservative Party candidate, believed that if Middlesbrough beat Sunderland in the derby game at Ayresome Park two days prior to the election, it would improve his chances of winning. Before the game took place, Walker offered Sunderland captain Charlie Thompson ¬£30 to throw the match, but he rejected and reported the matter to his chairman who subsequently informed the Football Association. Middlesbrough actually won the game but Gibson-Poole lost the election by over 3000 votes. On 16 January 1911, an FA Commission decided that money had been offered and both Walker and Gibson-Poole were suspended from football for life. Some believed that Walker had only been a pawn, but despite a 12,500 strong petition to the FA to reconsider his ban, it was upheld. ==References== * * Category:Airdrieonians F.C.

The Portuguese police investigation into her disappearance closed in July 2008. Scotland Yard in May 2011 began a review of the case, Operation Grange, and in April 2012 announced their belief that Madeleine might still be alive. In the weeks following her disappearance, Madeleine's parents implemented a successful publicity campaign that kept her in the public eye. This resulted in a wide-reaching international response, both in the media and by the public, which led to some criticism that the media attention was excessive. There was also comment that the UK media had unfairly criticised the Portuguese police. ==Publicity== ===By the family=== An official website for the search was set up, and the McCann family broadcast two early video appeals. The first was a photograph and video montage set to Simple Minds' song \\"Don't You (Forget About Me)\\" and included an animation of the word LOOK in uppercase with a reproduction of her coloboma as a radial line inside the first letter O, which blinks. The second featured a montage of images with a voice-over by actress Zo√´ Wanamaker mentioning her coloboma, seeking information about her whereabouts, and asking people to download and display a poster of her from the official site. The family said that part of the money raised from Madeleine's Fund would go towards hiring professional campaigners, with a view to achieving the same saturation level of publicity across Europe as had been attained in the UK and the Algarve. The family based themselves in the same holiday resort from the time of the disappearance and stated then that they would not leave until Madeleine was located. Though as the campaign progressed, they ended up visiting the Vatican City, Spain, Germany, and Morocco for it, and on 5 June, they made an appeal on the British TV programme Crimewatch. However, shortly after being named as arguidos, the McCanns returned to the UK on 9 September. Madeleine's father had already made a brief trip to the UK, on 20 May 2007, to help finalise the campaign for the search for his daughter. Gerry McCann visited the United States between 22 and 25 July when he met US Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and experts from the National and International Centres for Missing and Exploited Children. During interviews on network television programmes Gerry was forced to defend leaving the children alone. The family announced on 15 September 2007 that, beginning in a fortnight, they would be spending up to ¬£80,000, from Madeleine's Fund, on a new publicity drive, involving newspaper, television, and poster advertising to further publicise Madeleine's disappearance. This will include posters in rural parts of Portugal and Spain and television advertisements, in Arabic, in Morocco. In late October the McCanns set up a hotline + 34 902 300213, operated by private detectives, for people in the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa to phone with information. Over Christmas 2007 the family made a television appeal. This had produced, by 27 December 347 phone calls with information with more subsequently. A further video appeal was made, by the parents, at Christmas 2008. This included footage of Madeleine taken in December 2006. The parents launched a fresh appeal for information, in March 2009, tightly focused on the area where Madeleine went missing. 10,000 leaflets in Portuguese were distributed in Praia da Luz, Lagos, and Burgau together with billboard advertising. However, many posters were promptly torn down with Correio da Manh√£ reporting that the local people wanted closure. The McCanns released an image, on 1 May 2009, of the projected appearance of a 6-year-old Madeleine. ===By others=== Advertisement on the front page of Microsoft's UK website Several unofficial webpages were created following the disappearance, notably on social networking sites such as Facebook and MySpace, offering support to the McCanns. An unofficial one minute's silence was held for Madeleine on 21 May 2007, but since it was organised by an anonymous viral email, it was not thought to be widely observed. Robert Murat, a suspect in the investigation, has tried to generate his own publicity by selling his story. However, publicist Max Clifford indicated that he would only represent Murat if he was cleared of suspicion of kidnapping. Within the virtual world Second Life, a virtual Madeleine's Garden has been created. In early July, Bryan Adams dedicated his concert on Malta to Madeleine. J. K. Rowling arranged with her publishers for a poster bearing the face of the missing child to be made available to booksellers when Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was launched on 21 July. Rowling said that she hoped that the posters would be displayed prominently in shops all over the world. ==Political reaction== The Portuguese Ambassador in London, Ant√≥nio Santana Carlos said on 8 May 2007 that the case was of \\"great concern\\" to Portugal and asked people to trust the police, amidst growing criticism of their handling of the case. President An√≠bal Cavaco Silva announced on 9 May that he was following the case \\"with great concern\\", adding that the police were \\"doing everything to find the child alive.\\" On 9 May, Tony Blair's spokesperson said that the then Prime Minister was following the case closely and that \\"we are helping in whatever way we can\\". On 16 May, coinciding with the launch of the fighting fund, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown delivered a similar message to relatives of Madeleine. Former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott also commented on the case, saying at Prime Minister's Question Time \\"I'm sure that the thoughts of the whole House will be with them at this terrible time.\\" On 26 May, a spokesman for the McCann family confirmed that Gordon Brown had telephoned the McCanns. Although the spokesman stated that the details of the conversations would remain private, he did confirm that \\"During them, Mr Brown offered both Gerry and Kate his full support in their efforts to find Madeleine.\\" In late September Foreign Secretary David Miliband telephoned Gerry. The German Justice Minister, Brigitte Zypries, said at a meeting of G8 justice ministers in Munich on 3 June, that it should be assumed that Madeleine had been abducted by a gang that passes on children to be abused. But the Portuguese prime minister, Jos√© S√≥crates, praised investigators in September 2007, following criticism in the British media of the police handling of the case. S√≥crates said that he had total confidence in the work carried out by the Portuguese police. ==Theories by experts== The disappearance provoked differing analyses by experts. Shortly after Madeleine went missing two former Scotland Yard commanders expressed the view that she had been abducted. Roy Ramm considered that it was a carefully planned kidnapping by someone who had been watching the child. John O'Connor was of the view that Madeleine had wandered out of the apartment on her own and was subsequently abducted. O'Connor opined that she was likely to be nearby and recommended a thorough search of surrounding occupied premises. This hypothesis was also supported by criminologist Mark Williams-Thomas who said, in May 2008, that he believed what happened was that Madeleine woke up, walked around the apartment, found the back patio door was insecure and wandered out. It was at this point that she was most likely abducted by an opportunistic predatory paedophile. However Paulo Sargento, a criminal psychologist at Lus√≥fona University in Lisbon, had produced in October 2007 a 3D reconstruction of events at the Ocean Club on the evening Madeleine disappeared, and his view was that kidnapping would be inconsistent with the evidence. The case was also reviewed by the notable forensic investigator Professor David Barclay of Robert Gordon University. His opinion was that the police were right to consider the McCanns as suspects and that the child is probably dead. ==Comparison and possible relations with the murder of Joana Cipriano== Joana Cipriano, a then 8-year-old girl, disappeared on 12 September 2004 from the village of Figueira, only seven miles from Praia da Luz, where Madeleine McCann disappeared on 3 May 2007. In both cases, the mothers launched campaigns to find their daughters and, in both cases, the local Pol√≠cia Judici√°ria investigated the possibility that the mothers had killed their daughters. * (Note: paperback edition). A child protection specialist, Mark Williams-Thomas, who believes that Joana's and Madeleine's disappearances are related, said that the disappearance of two children unknown to each other, within a period of four years in a seven-mile radius, would be a huge coincidence, especially considering that Portugal is a small country with few abductions. Before Joana's disappearance, the previous first-degree murder of a child in the Algarve region was in November 1990 and involved a British girl, nine-year-old Rachel Charles, who was abducted and murdered in Albufeira. Her body was found three days later; a British mechanic, Michael Cook, a friend of the family, was arrested and convicted. *On 19 June 1996 a six-year-old German child, Ren√® Has√®e, also disappeared, from the Amoreira beach near Aljezur while walking a few metres ahead of his parents; see The Doe Network: Case File 2075DMPRT and \\"Rene Hasee vermisst seit dem 19.Juni 1996\\". Leandro Silva, the common-law husband of Leonor Cipriano, said in 2007 that \\"the only difference between the McCanns and us is that we don't have money.\\" Several similarities between the cases‚Äîboth girls vanished without trace within and less than three years of each other, in both cases officers failed to secure the crime scene, both mothers mounted campaigns to find their daughters and both women were accused of involvement‚Äîprompted Joana's family to appeal in 2008 for police to investigate whether there was a link between the disappearances. ==Fundraising== ===Madeleine's Fund=== A fundraising company, known as Madeleine's Fund: Leaving No Stone Unturned, was launched in Leicester on 16 May 2007. The Fund is a limited company, not a registered charity, because its objectives are not wide enough to satisfy Charity Commission criteria for UK charities. The objectives include helping the extended family with their expenses (to prevent abuse, payments can only be authorised by the independent members of the board who are not family members) and continuing the investigation independently should that prove necessary. Any excess funds would be used to help search for other abducted children. The Fund's website reportedly received 58 million hits and 16,000 messages of support by 18 May, only two days after its launch. Over ¬£1,095,000 had been raised by 30 October 2007.Madeleine's Fund: Leaving No Stone Unturned Two ¬£2,000 monthly re-payments on the McCanns' mortgage were made from the Fund in July and August. ===Legal costs funding=== The trustees of Madeleine's Fund announced in September that the fund would not be used to pay the McCanns' legal costs. Initially, the McCanns considered setting up a separate appeal fund for legal expenses. However, Richard Branson created a fund for the McCann's legal expenses, including those of their current advisor, Michael Caplan QC, a solicitor and partner in the London firm of Kingsley Napley. Stephen Winyard came out in December as having contributed ¬£100,000 to the McCanns' defence fund, which paid for DNA tests carried out on the Renault Sc√©nic hire car used by the McCanns. He also revealed Brian Kennedy as another donor. ==Potential frauds== Many unofficial websites were registered which had domain names that contained slight misspellings of Madeleine's name (a practice known as typosquatting), plus keywords likely to be used in searches. These websites contained material unrelated to Madeleine. There have also been people collecting money on the false premise that they were representing Madeleine's Fund, one of whom, Debbie Clifton, was jailed for 90 days. On 28 June 2007 police arrested an Italian man and a Portuguese woman at a villa in Sotogrande, C√°diz over allegations that they had tried to defraud the McCanns by claiming a reward for information about their daughter. However, police said that there was no direct link with Madeleine's kidnap. Then on 6 July police in the Netherlands arrested a man who allegedly demanded two million euros from the McCanns for information about their missing daughter. British barrister Michael Shrimpton presented himself as the \\"unofficial representative\\" for parents Kate and Gerry McCann, and claimed responsibility for setting up a meeting between them and Pope Benedict XVI. According to Shrimpton, Madeleine was being held in or near Morocco after being smuggled there on a drug-running vessel. Authorities rejected these claims as false and issued a strict warning to Shrimpton not to interfere with the case. Shrimpton was later charged, convicted, and imprisoned for an unrelated hoax. ==Libel actions== The McCanns announced on 31 August that they were suing the Portuguese tabloid Tal & Qual for libel. The newspaper reported that the \\"police believe\\" that the McCanns killed Madeleine, suggesting she may have died in an accident or from a drugs overdose. The McCanns' lawyer, Carlos Pinto de Abreu, said the couple's image had been \\"dragged through the dirt\\" by \\"character-assassinating, tabloid-style\\" news reports, adding that the press \\"has engaged in a horrific exercise in scandal-mongering, replete with rumours and lurid commentaries...to sell more TV time and newspaper space to advertisers\\". The police stressed that the McCanns were not suspects. Tal & Qual stood by the story. The paper ceased publication after 28 September 2007, because of a drop in circulation. The ASFIC's (Associa√ß√£o Sindical dos Funcion√°rios de Investiga√ß√£o Criminal da Pol√≠cia Judici√°ria) General Secretary, Carlos Garcia, declared on 10 August 2007 that the union representing the PJ intended to take legal action against those British journalists who had accused Portuguese police officers of forging evidence. He stated that, at the beginning of the investigation, a joint working group had been created with the British police, and that they had been working in close cooperation. Thus when the Portuguese police is criticised, so too is the British police. He claimed that the number of abductions resulting in murder was a decisive factor that determined the different methods of investigation adopted by the two forces. In March 2008, the McCanns launched a libel suit against the Daily Express and its sister newspaper, the Daily Star, as well as their Sunday equivalents, following the newspapers' coverage of the case. The action concerned more than 100 stories across the four newspapers, which accused the McCanns of causing Madeleine's death and then covering it up. One immediate consequence of the action was that Express Newspapers pulled all references to Madeleine from its websites. In a settlement reached at the High Court of Justice, the newspapers agreed to run a front-page apology to the McCanns on 19 March 2008, publish another apology on the front pages of the Sunday editions of 23 March and make a statement of apology at the High Court. Guardian media commentator Roy Greenslade said it was \\"unprecedented\\" for four major newspapers to offer front-page apologies, but also said that it was more than warranted given that the papers had committed \\"a substantial libel\\" that shamed the entire British press.Greenslade, Roy. Express and Star apologies to McCanns bring all journalism into disrepute. The Guardian, 19 March 2008. In its apology, the Express stated that \\"a number of articles in the newspaper have suggested that the couple caused the death of their missing daughter Madeleine and then covered it up. We acknowledge that there is no evidence whatsoever to support this theory and that Kate and Gerry are completely innocent of any involvement in their daughter's disappearance.\\" The McCanns also accepted ¬£550,000 ($1.1 million) damages and costs. They promised to pay the damages into Madeleine's Fund. Robert Murat instigated defamation proceedings against Sky News and 11 British newspapers, in April 2008. He used London solicitors Simons Muirhead & Burton on a conditional fee agreement. The first paper to settle was The Scotsman who published an apology on 15 May but paid no damages. The newspaper groups Associated Newspapers, Express Newspapers, MGN Limited and News Group Newspapers settled with Murat, on 17 July, for a ¬£600,000 payout. They also issued a public apology in the High Court. BSkyB also paid him damages in a separate libel case. Sergey Malinka, and Murat's girlfriend, Michaela Walczuch, accepted more than ¬£100,000 each. The friends of the McCanns, known as the Tapas Seven, were awarded around ¬£375,000 in damages and secured printed apologies from Express Newspapers. The friends have donated the settlement monies to the Fund. The apologies, printed in both the Daily Express and Daily Star, said \\"In articles ... we suggested that the holiday companions of Kate and Gerry McCann might have covered up the true facts concerning Madeleine McCann's disappearance and/or misled the authorities investigating her disappearance. We also reported speculation that ... Dr Russell O'Brien, was suspected of involvement with Madeleine's abduction. We now accept that these suggestions should never have been made and were completely untrue. ...\\" The McCanns applied for an injunction, on 8 December 2009, prohibiting the sale of the book, written by Gon√ßalo Amaral, Maddie, a Verdade da Mentira (Maddie, the Truth of the Lie), and launched a libel suit against Amaral. ==Books== * Maddie 129, , that covers the 129 days between Madeleine's disappearance and the McCanns' return to Rothley. The book claims to identify contradictions and unanswered questions in the accounts of the McCanns and their friends. It was published in early November 2007, in English by Prime Books, and written by two Portuguese journalists Hern√¢ni Carvalho and Lu√≠s Maia. * A Culpa dos McCann (The Guilt of the McCanns), , was published in Portugal in December 2007. Written by Portuguese daily newspaper Correio da Manh√£ editor-in-chief Manuel Catarino, it was published by Guerra & Paz. * Madeleine: A Heartbreaking and Extraordinary Disappearance, , was published in December 2007 by Express Newspapers and written by Robert Downing. * A Estrela de Madeleine (The Star of Madeleine), , written by Paulo Pereira Crist√≥v√£o, was published by Editorial Presen√ßa. * O Enigma da Praia da Luz (The Enigma of Praia da Luz), , was written by Francisco Duarte de Carvalho and was published by Editora Guerra & Paz. * Maddie, a Verdade da Mentira (Maddie, the Truth of the Lie), , written by Gon√ßalo Amaral, who had originally headed the police investigation, was published by Guerra & Paz on 24 July 2008. In the book, Amaral detailed his belief that Madeleine died in the family's holiday apartment. *What really happened to Madeleine McCann? subtitled '60 reasons which suggest that she was not abducted', , was written by Tony Bennett and was published on 31 October 2008 by The Madeleine Foundation. *Madeleine, , was written by Kate McCann and was published by Bantam Press on 12 May 2011. ==Film and television== ===BBC Panorama=== The BBC Panorama current affairs programme screened an edition called 'The Mystery of Madeleine McCann' on 19 November 2007. It attracted 5.3 million viewers. The programme reviewed the evidence that was currently publicly available but did not come to a conclusion on what happened to Madeleine. The original producer of the programme walked out, claiming that criticism of the media and the Portuguese police had been toned down for the broadcast version. ===Proposed documentaries=== The McCanns have given permission for talks to open about the possibility of the disappearance being made into a documentary film. Spokesman Clarence Mitchell confirmed that a meeting, with talent agency and production company IMG to discuss a possible film, was held in December 2007, but the proposal was abandoned. Mitchell also confirmed, in March 2008, that discussions were taking place with ITV and other companies over the possibility of the McCanns appearing in a documentary, which would focus on missing children in general and the different initiatives used to help look for them. The programme, Madeleine, One Year On: Campaign For Change, was broadcast on ITV1 on 30 April 2008. The programme's producers said the McCanns had no editorial control and were not paid, although ¬£10,000 was donated to the Find Madeleine Fund. ===TVI documentary=== A television documentary, Maddie, a Verdade da Mentira (Maddie, the Truth of the Lie), based on the book, by Gon√ßalo Amaral, of the same name, was produced by TVI. It was broadcast on 13 April 2009. The documentary pulled in an audience of over 2 million. ==Implications for television programmes and films== On 9 May 2007, ITV announced it would be rewriting a planned child kidnap plot, despite having already filmed some scenes, from their popular soap Coronation Street. Similarly, on 23 May, the BBC also announced that it was scrapping a storyline from rival soap EastEnders, that had already been filmed, which also was to feature the kidnapping of a child. In both cases these plot lines were removed or altered due to the parallel with the Madeleine case, and because the channels did not want to cause further distress to the McCann family. ITV was criticised, in September 2007, over the showing of Torn, a three-part original drama series. The plot involved the disappearance of a four-year-old girl and the family's search for her. ITV responded to the criticism by stating that Torn had been written two years earlier and filmed two months before Madeleine disappeared. Also in September 2007, actor and director Ben Affleck postponed the UK release of his film Gone Baby Gone, which had been scheduled for release on 28 December, to 18 April 2008. Its plot centres on the abduction of a four-year-old girl who is left at home alone by her mother. The actress who plays the girl, Madeline O'Brien, reportedly resembles Madeleine. According to Affleck, the release of the film in Britain was delayed because those involved with the film didn't want to \\"touch a nerve or inflame anybody's sensitivities.\\" ==Tributes== Tributes in Rothley on 17 May 2007 Church services were held in Portugal and the UK on 3 May 2008, to mark the first anniversary of Madeleine's disappearance. ==Appeals== There were many appeals for Madeleine's safe return, including from her family, celebrities, church leaders, and the police. ===From the family=== Her father, Gerry McCann, said, \\"Words cannot describe the anguish and despair that we are feeling. Please, if you have Madeleine, let her come home to her Mummy, Daddy, brother and sister.\\" He went on to say that the family would leave \\"no stone unturned\\" in the search for Madeleine and that he and his wife \\"remained positive.\\" Madeleine's aunt, Philomena McCann, drew up a poster to circulate in a chain email to help find the child. She also commented during a live phone interview that there was little coverage of the case in other countries apart from the UK and Portugal. ===From the police=== On 21 May 2007, the British Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP) reported that British police are calling on visitors to the Ocean Club Resort, Praia da Luz, or the surrounding areas in the two weeks leading up to Madeleine's disappearance on Thursday 3 May to provide copies of any relevant photographs taken during their stay, in an attempt to identify an abductor using a biometric facial recognition application, through which the features of bystanders in those photographs could be compared to those of international sex offenders and other criminals. By 1 June, over one thousand photographs had been uploaded. ===From religious leaders=== On 11 May 2007 Roman Catholic Archbishop Mario Conti of Glasgow said that his prayers would continue for the safe return of Madeleine Then on 30 May, Pope Benedict XVI, at an audience in the Vatican with the McCanns, promised to pray for the girl's safe return. ===From sport=== ====From football==== Manchester United footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, who is Portuguese, made a televised appeal on MUTV for her safe return saying \\"I was very upset to hear of the abduction of Madeleine McCann and I appeal to anyone with information to come forward - please come forward.\\" Chelsea and England footballer John Terry and his Portuguese teammate Paulo Ferreira said that they were \\"devastated to hear that young Maddy was abducted. Our thoughts and feelings go out to her parents, her family and we are urging anyone out there with any information at all, please, please, please come forward.\\" On 11 May 2007, David Beckham also made a public appeal. \\"If you have seen this little girl please could you go to your local authorities or police and give any information that you have,\\" said Beckham, holding up a poster with a photograph of Madeleine.\\"David Beckham appeals for information on missing toddler Madeleine McCann\\", International Herald Tribune, 11 May 2007 After a picture was released of Madeleine in an Everton shirt, Everton's Portuguese footballers Nuno Valente and Manuel Fernandes appealed for any news on her whereabouts and Phil Neville issued the following statement on behalf of the club. \\"Everton has fans all over the world and I know that they, along with everyone connected with the football club, are hoping and praying for Madeleine's safe return. Our thoughts are very much with the family at this extremely distressing time.\\" Manager David Moyes added \\"Everybody here is desperately wanting to hear good news and my thoughts and prayers are with the family. If anybody out there knows anything, please come forward\\". Celtic footballer Neil Lennon made an appeal for Madeleine's safety, and yellow armbands were worn on 12 May 2007 against Aberdeen to mark her fourth birthday. A video appealing for help with the search for Madeleine was broadcast to Spanish football fans visiting the city of Glasgow for the 2007 UEFA Cup Final on 16 May. Another film was aired at half-time during the English FA Cup Final on 19 May. Before their departure for the 2007 UEFA Champions League Final on Monday 21 May, Liverpool's squad were photographed with a banner appealing for any information on Madeleine's whereabouts. ====From cricket==== The England cricket team wore yellow ribbons during the Lords' Test match against the West Indies, in May 2007, to show their support for Madeleine. A picture of Madeleine was also shown on the big screen at the match.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1551978/Mission-that-drives- Madeleines-parents.html ===From education=== To further publicise Madeleine's disappearance, the pupils of Bishop Ellis Catholic Primary School, the school that she would have attended from September 2007, lined up in the school's playground on 18 June to spell out Find Madeleine. This was easily readable from the air. In August the school announced that they had saved a desk, coat peg and locker for the child. ==Criticism== ===Of the public and political reaction=== The scale of the public reaction provoked negative comment from a number of media commentators. On 16 May 2007 on BBC Radio 4, Matthew Parris said that politicians' displays of concern were \\"hollow\\". He also claimed that politicians \\"read the common newspapers and they decide this is what the common people feel, and they get all caught up with it. But it's all to do with trying to associate themselves with the common herd and they're not part of it. They're politicians\\". He went on to say, in his column on 17 May, that MPs wearing yellow ribbons was mawkish and an attempt to \\"tap in to the emotions of the mob\\". Then on 19 May, The Guardian described the public reaction as hysteria and drew a parallel with the response to the News of the World's anti-paedophile campaign. Writing in The Times on 16 September, India Knight criticised the on-line community for its censorious attitude and its willingness to rush to judgement whilst pointing out that the McCanns had contributed to the public's obsession with the case by their extensive and well-orchestrated media campaign. A debate on the disappearance was held at the London School of Economics on 30 January 2008. Although the debate was inconclusive, the stridently critical attitude of the on-line community towards the McCanns, noted by Knight, also manifested itself in the audience reaction. ===Of the media coverage=== ====Importance of the coverage==== Some have suggested that the high level of media coverage could be attributable to Madeleine's race, nationality, or socio-economic status. The Independent, in an editorial on 15 May 2007, described the media coverage as showing a warped sense of priorities and condemned the criticism of the Portuguese authorities as jingoism. In his 17 May column in Portugal's P√∫blico newspaper, the former head of Portugal's bar association, Jos√© Miguel J√∫dice, said the enormous mobilisation was because the little girl \\"is English, white, and the daughter of doctors.\\" On 18 May, Inter Press Service drew attention to the fact that some observers point out that Madeleine comes from a well-heeled British family (both of her parents are doctors), unlike so many Portuguese or immigrant children whose disappearance has drawn scant attention from the press. There has also been criticism of the weight put on this case in the light of many other, unpublicised, children's disappearances. Also on 18 May, The Scotsman commented that \\"... there was evidence that public opinion, while strongly supportive of the child's distraught parents Kate and Gerry McCann, was growing alarmed at what it viewed as relentless, almost prurient coverage.\\" Channel 4 News presenter Alex Thomson has said the Madeleine McCann story did not deserve its news ranking. \\"I've been sickened by the way the media have allowed themselves to be taken for a full-scale ride by the McCanns.\\" He added that the parents' conduct, \\"a contributory factor in the abduction, was largely downplayed or ignored altogether by sycophantic, gullible blanket coverage.\\" Raymond Snoddy wrote in Marketing: \\"To what extent has all this coverage been kept afloat for so long because the child is white and photogenic, and has articulate, resourceful parents? Of course, the news value of the story was also enhanced by context - everyone's worst nightmare, a child snatched from an apparently secure apartment in an upmarket holiday resort. But the sad truth is that if a black child had been snatched from a sink estate in Liverpool or Glasgow, the chances are you would not know their name.\\" Gerry, who had encouraged media coverage, criticised De Telegraaf on 14 June for publishing a letter claiming to know the location of Madeleine's body, calling it \\"an irresponsible piece of journalism\\" and \\"insensitive and cruel\\". Portuguese police searched the site but found no trace of Madeleine. At the Edinburgh International Television Festival on 25 August, Gerry complained about the amount of media attention, on the disappearance, that he claimed was 10 times what he had expected. He also criticised wild speculation being erroneously reported as fact. There was criticism by the Daily Express of the stories run in the Portuguese media. In an article on 28 August that summarised the speculation, the Daily Express accused the local media of \\"a vile whispering campaign, which has led to them [the McCanns] suffering a daily torrent of smears\\" and described the stories suggesting that the McCanns had involvement in their daughter's disappearance as \\"lies\\". Journalist Martin Bell accused the BBC of wasting hundreds of thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money in its coverage of the disappearance. In January 2008 Bell said \\"I'm calling it the death of news. It is the stupidification of the news agenda. It is pretty obvious television news has lost its way not just with the McCann case but that has been extreme.\\" A comparison was drawn, in early March 2008, between the publicity given to Madeleine with the much lower key publicity for the disappearance of Shannon Matthews. The Guardian explained this by stating that \\"Overarching everything is social class\\" but they added that Shannon going missing in the UK made a difference. The Independent took the same line saying \\"Kate and Gerry McCann had a lot: they were a couple of nice middle- class doctors on holiday in an upmarket resort\\" \\"Karen Matthews is not as elegant, nor as eloquent\\". In his book Spoilt Rotten Theodore Dalrymple analyses critically the media attention and reaction to the disappearance, and specifically how certain elements in the media interpreted the lack of emotion displayed by the girl's parents as evidence of guilt. ====Objectivity of the coverage==== In an interview published on 1 July Martin Brunt, a Sky News journalist who had covered the case extensively, conceded that the media's handling of the Madeleine McCann disappearance had been flawed. \\"It's the view of a few of us that when we look back over the first two or three weeks of the coverage we were in some ways over-sympathetic. We kind of adopted the tone and the language that the family did. I think we perhaps lost our objectivity a bit, we became a bit too subjective about the story.\\" The British media has been criticised for being heavily critical of the Portuguese police and legal system. The Guardian noted that the British media compared the Portuguese procedures with British procedures unfavourably and unfairly. Likewise, The Times published an editorial titled \\"Exactly how guilty are the Portuguese police?\\" and stated that there had been a rush to judge the Portuguese authorities. Matthew Parris, writing for The Times in August, chastised the British and Portuguese media for what he described as \\"assassination-by- innuendo\\" of suspect Robert Murat, who those involved closely in the case believed was innocent. \\"For the rest of the world, however, glancing in passing at headlines and skimming news reports over its coffee, the name Murat is now synonymous with 'creepy oddball and obvious suspect',\\" Parris wrote. He concluded, \\"The whole disgusting business, the whole media-driven infatuation with this little girl and her parents, the whole sick, morbid, sentimental campaign of news generation and news manipulation, has been a disgrace to the British media.\\" Peter Horrocks, the head of BBC TV News, denied claims in September 2007 that the BBC was biased in favour of the McCanns. Some viewers had suggested that the McCanns had been treated in an overly positive light because they were white, middle class doctors. Then Horrocks criticised rival broadcasters, saying \\"I know that many other TV and radio networks have been absolutely extraordinary, always talking about it in terms of sympathy and their [McCanns] feelings.\\" Writing in The Guardian, also in September, Marcel Berlins said that the investigation had generated a wave of negative comments in the UK media towards Portuguese society, and the authorities investigating the case, as the result of ignorance of the Portuguese legal system. Berlins called it \\"a touch of arrogant xenophobia\\". ===Of the publicity=== In early July 2007, parents criticised a cinema advertisement about the disappearance of Madeleine which showed a still picture of the girl with the statement that she had been \\"snatched\\" from her room. The advertisement was being screened across Britain before the children's film Shrek the Third, and parents were complaining to the Advertising Standards Authority that it might scare young children and that it detracted from parents' ability to decide how much to tell their children. Following the protests, the advertisements were quickly withdrawn. Subsequently, however, the advertisement, which had received a British Board of Film Classification to be aired in U-certificate films, was cleared by the Advertising Standards Authority. A plan to include bookmarks bearing Madeleine's image in copies of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was shelved. After reflection, the publishers decided it would not be responsible to expose younger readers to the story of Madeleine's disappearance.https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-mccann-potter/rowling- helps-in-hunt-for-madeleine-idUKL1767741820070717 Whilst the public response has largely been in support of the Find Maddie campaign, there have been instances where it has been criticised for drawing attention away from other missing children. Mark Lawson, writing in The Guardian on 26 October, criticised the McCanns for employing their own spin doctor, describing their use of what he termed \\"political methods\\" as a \\"terrible error\\". Carlos Anjos, president of the Association of Criminal Investigation Staff, criticised the McCanns, on 6 November, for creating a \\"monster of information\\" that hindered the investigation. He also stated that they should not have publicised the coloboma in her right eye which he claimed put the life of the girl at risk. This was echoed by Fernando Jos√© Pinto Monteiro, the Attorney General, who said that, if she had been abducted, the worldwide campaign would have turned Madeleine into a liability and that it was likely that her abductor had already killed her. ==Rewards== Rewards offered totalled over ¬£2.6 million including: * ¬£1,500,000 (‚Ç¨2,200,000) including ¬£250,000 by the News of the World, ¬£250,000 by Sir Philip Green, ¬£50,000 by Simon Cowell and ¬£25,000 by Coleen McLoughlin.

In 1753 at Lomonosov's suggestion he translated the first part of Alexander Pope's \\"Essay on Man\\" from a French version; publication was delayed until 1757 due to opposition by the Russian Orthodox church. He wrote an ode in honour of Empress Elizabeth's ascension to the Russian throne (1754), and another in the name of Moscow University for her coronation (1756). His poem in honour of Elizabeth on the occasion of the New Year's fireworks display of 1755, at one time thought to have been written by Lomonosov, is in fact a translation of Jacob Stahlin's poem \\"Verse an Ihre Kayserliche Majest√§t unsere grosse und huldreichste Monarchin gerichtet worden\\".

DCI is headquartered in New York City, and is a broker-dealer and member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Israel Maimon became the organization's president & CEO in October 2016. The sale of Israel bonds is global in scope. In addition to the United States, bonds are sold in Canada through Canada-Israel Securities, Ltd., and Europe through Development Company for Israel (UK) Ltd. Sales have increased steadily since the initial Independence Issue was offered in 1951, with total worldwide sales approaching $40 billion. In 2013, U.S. Israel bond sales surpassed $1.12 billion, the first time domestic sales exceeded the $1 billion mark. Sales again exceeded $1 billion in 2014 and 2015. In the fall of 2011, Israel Bonds launched an eCommerce site to facilitate investing in Israel bonds online. As of 2016, investments made via the online site have exceeded $130 million, owned by 55,000 bondholders around the world. ==History== ===1950 to 1951=== The idea to float bonds issued by Israel's government was conceived by Israel's first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, in the aftermath of the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. The war had taken a terrible toll in casualties (more than 1% of the country's population was killed), and the nation's fledgling economy was devastated. Compounding the dire situation, Israel faced unique economic demands, especially the arrival of hundreds of thousands of immigrants from post World War II Europe and the Middle East. Short on economic resources, Israel suffered food shortages and imposed rationing, and new arrivals had to be housed in primitive shelters. With the country financially overwhelmed, Ben-Gurion turned to the Diaspora community for help. Ben-Gurion's goals were two-fold: to obtain millions of dollars in funding for immigrant absorption and the construction of national infrastructure, and to engage Diaspora Jewry as active partners in building the new Jewish state. In September 1950, he convened a meeting of American Jewish leaders at Jerusalem's King David Hotel, where he proposed issuing bonds to help provide Israel with a more secure economic foundation. The American Jewish leaders supported Ben-Gurion's plan and, the following spring, the prime minister traveled to New York City to help launch the inaugural Independence Issue at a Madison Square Garden ceremony. Expectations for first-year sales were $25 million. Instead, final results for 1951 more than doubled projections, exceeding $52 million. ===1952 to 1966=== The new organization increasingly expanded operations throughout the US and Canada, providing proceeds utilized to help fund projects in Israel's industrial and agricultural sectors, including the Dead Sea Works and National Water Carrier. Within six years, according to an article in the January 21, 1957, issue of Time magazine, \\"bond sales alone amount(ed) to an astonishing 35% of Israel's special development budget.\\" The article quoted Foreign Minister Golda Meir, who emphatically stated, \\"the central role in building our economic strength has been played by Israel bonds.\\" ===1967 to 1992=== Over subsequent decades, sales continued to increase, particularly in times of crisis. During 1967's Six-Day War, sales exceeded $250 million, a total that more than doubled during the Yom Kippur War of 1973. From the mid-1980s to 1992, the bonds were the primary way the Israeli government obtained external funding. In 1991, the year of the Persian Gulf War and Iraqi missile strikes on Israel, annual worldwide sales broke the $1 billion threshold. ===1993 to Present=== Annual worldwide sales remained at $1 billion or above as Israel bonds became increasingly viewed not only as a means of supporting Israel, but as a useful financial investment as well, particularly for pension funds. In 2004, the Bank of Israel issued a report ‚Äúto describe the activity of the Israel Bonds organization over the past fifty years and to summarize changes that have taken place in the products the organization offers with respect to quantities, types of bonds and recruitment costs.‚Äù In doing so, the report noted, ‚Äúan analysis of the sale of bonds indicates an increase in sales from one decade to the next.‚Äù It also observed that the Bonds organization has been market-responsive over the years, ‚Äúso that each bond addressed a different target audience: individuals, communities (and) financial bodies.‚Äù The report concluded that Israel Bonds is ‚Äúa uniquely Israeli establishment, and no other countries have a similar organization.‚Äù It stated that ‚Äú(when) Israel has found it difficult to raise high sums of external debt, Israel Bonds has shown itself to be capable of reacting quickly to increased needs for foreign currency.‚Äù In fall 2011, the organization launched its e-commerce site. In 2013, U.S. sales exceeded $1.1 billion, the first time domestic sales crossed the $1 billion threshold. That achievement was realized in 2014 and again in 2015. In June 2016, the Bonds organization launched a new initiative to counter anti-Israel activism on campus. Entitled \\"The Alternative BDS - Bonds Donated to Schools,\\" the program encourages donations of Israel bonds to universities. ==Securities== Initially, Israel Bonds offered one security. As the program became increasingly successful, multiple investment options were made available. The following bonds are currently offered: * Jubilee Issue Bonds ‚Äì fixed rate 2, 3, 5 and 10-year bonds; $25,000 minimum investment and increments of $5,000. Interest is paid semi-annually on May 1 and November 1. * Maccabee Issue Bonds ‚Äì fixed rate 2, 3 and 5-year bonds; $5,000 minimum investment and increments of $500 . Interest is paid semi-annually on May 1 and November 1. * Sabra Savings Bonds ‚Äì fixed rate 3-year bonds; $1,000 minimum investment and increments of $100. Interest paid upon maturity. * Mazel Tov Bonds ‚Äì fixed rate 5-year bonds; $100 minimum investment and increments of $10, limited to $2500 per month for each purchaser and holder. Interest paid upon maturity. * eMitzvah Bonds ‚Äì fixed rate 5-year bonds; $36 minimum investment and increments of $18. Maximum allowable amount purchased by one person in a transaction, registered in the name of one holder, is $90. Interest paid upon maturity. May only be purchased online. * Floating Rate LIBOR Bonds ‚Äì variable rate 2, 3 and 5-year bonds; $5,000 minimum investment and increments of $500; interest paid semi-annually on June 1 and December 1. Rates change two times per month on most Israel bonds. Interest for fixed rate bonds is based on prevailing Treasury bond rates, plus a spread. Rates for floating rate bonds are equal to the 6-month LIBOR rate in effect on the initial determination date, plus or minus a spread that remains fixed until maturity. Although Israel has never defaulted in the payment of principal or interest on any of its internal or external debt, prospective purchasers are warned of sovereign credit risk. ==Investor Diversity== Initially, investors in Israel bonds were largely members of the Jewish community who wanted to help Israel. However, as offerings began featuring multiple rate and maturity options, the investor base became increasingly diversified. Private and institutional investors alike viewed Israel bonds as a significant means of strengthening portfolios in addition to supporting Israel. Over 90 U.S. state and municipal pension and treasury funds have invested more than $3 billion in Israel bonds to date. Other investors in Israel bonds include corporations, insurance companies, associations, unions, banks, financial institutions, universities, foundations and synagogues. According to the prospectus, Israel uses the net proceeds from the sale of the bonds for general purposes of the state. ==References== ==External links== *Israel Bonds website Category:Securities (finance) Category:Government of Israel Category:Finance in Israel Category:Government bonds issued by Israel ","title":"Israel Bonds"},{"id":"11650231","text":"John Kelsay (October 23, 1819 ‚Äì January 19, 1899) was an American politician and judge in Oregon.

Foster was injured during the second game of the 2005 season, only to return in 2006 as the team's starting defensive tackle, lining up to Ramel Meekins. Despite the unit's lack of size, Foster's six sacks helped Rutgers register forty-one sacks total in 2006, good for fifth in all of Division I-A,http://web1.ncaa.org/d1mfb/natlRank.jsp?year=2006√∑=4&rpt;=IA_teamsacks&site;=org as well as fourth in total defense.http://web1.ncaa.org/d1mfb/natlRank.jsp?year=2006√∑=4&rpt;=IA_teamtotdef&site;=org Foster gained national notoriety in 2006 for his stellar play, as well as for a popular clip aired by ESPN of a locker room speech. Snippets of the video were played at later home games. In addition, he makes a chopping motion with his arms and hands as a reference to his coach, Greg Schiano's motto, \\"Keep Choppin'.\\" For his efforts, Foster was named first team all-Big East Conference. The Football Writers Association of America named him as a first- team All-American at defensive tackle, as well as making Honorable Mention on the AP's team. In 2007, he was named a preseason All-American by Sports Illustrated. Foster was named to several pre-season All-America teams for 2007 at DT. He was named to the preseason watch list for the Lott Trophy, annually awarded to the best defensive player in the nation. ==Professional career== ===Indianapolis Colts=== After going undrafted, Foster was signed as a free agent for the Indianapolis Colts on May 2, 2008. Foster played in 13 games during his first season starting 11 of them. During the Colts Monday Night Football game against the Buccaneers on October 3, 2011, Foster suffered a gruesome leg injury. During the final minutes of the first half, teammate Tyler Brayton rolled on Foster's ankle, causing his foot to turn painfully the wrong direction. His ankle was dislocated in the process.

Unrelated to the defunct North American chain of the same name (see Venture Stores), Venture is best remembered as a retailer of medium quality women's and children's clothing as well as soft home wares. Venture experienced financial difficulties in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and was placed in liquidation in April 1994, with all stores closing soon after. == History == The first Venture store opened in Geelong (Victoria) in 1970, with additional stores opening across Melbourne over the next 2 years. In November 1972 the business expanded into New South Wales (NSW), opening a store at Merrylands shopping complex. At that time there was a total of 16 stores across Victoria. Additional stores in NSW at Mt Druitt and Liverpool followed in 1973. The merchandise range at that time included \\"a wide range of women's fashions, sportswear, knitwear, underwear, nightware, hosiery, corset wear, menswear, children's clothing, manchester, fabrics, bedding and furnishing\\"; a description that remained constant over the 24 years of operation. In 1973 the South Australian-based department store John Martins acquired an initial 50% shareholding in the company from the original owner, a Mr Robert Morris. The investment by John Martins facilitated expansion of the chain into South Australia and Queensland. John Martins eventually moved to 100% ownership. In 1981 John Martins was taken over by Solomon Lew, who subsequently sold the company to the Melbourne-based Cooke family, headed by David Cooke. The John Martins department store chain was sold to Sydney-based retailer David Jones Limited in 1985, with the Cooke family retaining ownership of Venture. The Cooke family appointed experienced retailer Bob Burke to manage the chain in 1981, and he revitalised the chain, closing unprofitable stores and changing the merchandise focus to budget-priced, quality apparel, aimed mainly at women, teenage girls and children. During Burke's first three years, turnover doubled and profitability increased, aided by a focus on own-branded merchandise which was not subject to competitor comparison. In February 1987, Venture purchased the Waltons (department store) chain from Alan Bond, consisting of 47 Waltons and Norman Ross stores, plus the South Australian-based J. Miller Anderson & Co. department store business, which closed in 1988. The Waltons stores were converted to Venture outlets, which increased the number of stores to 70 across all states of Australia, except Western Australia. == Demise and closure == In the late 1980s Venture faced increasing competition from its main competitors Big W, Kmart Australia and Target Australia, which had larger store networks, bigger stores (and higher average sales per store) and better economies of scale. The Cooke family announced plans to float Venture in February 1989 to help reduce the high debt levels, but these plans were scrapped in favour of a capital restructure, which included a debt for equity swap. In 1992 Venture was placed into receivership, and was purchased from the receivers for A$12 million by a joint venture between the New Zealand-based department store chain Farmers Deka (now Farmers Trading Company) and the Perth-based companies Action Holdings and Vox. In December 1992 Farmers Deka acquired 100% of Venture, with ownership passing to Western Australian-based grocery wholesaler and retailer Foodland Associated Limited (FAL), a former Australian company later acquired by IGA (Australian supermarket group). In the 1993 FAL annual report it was written \\"Venture's management has made significant progress in establishing and repositioning Venture's image as a destination store by merchandising every day repeat purchase items at competitive prices while maintaining its focus on the female with young children as the primary customer base.\\" However, on 24 February 1994 Venture was placed into administration. The announcement from FAL included the statement \\"The directors of FAL decided to discontinue support after a comprehensive review over the past 4 weeks. This review process did not satisfy the directors that Venture had a viable future and it was, therefore, in the best interests of FAL shareholders that it be sold or wound up as soon as possible\\". Following an 8-week sale process it was announced on 16 April 1994 that Venture had been placed in liquidation due to the failure of negotiations with potential buyers of the business. The closing down sale commenced on 16 April 1994, with all 45 stores closing on or before 14 May 1994. ==Former store locations== The following listing contains all Venture stores that operated during its 24-year history.

This is a re-working of the 1951 Hanna-Barbera Jerry and the Goldfish as another short about Jerry saving a goldfish from Tom. ==Plot== As morning approaches, Tom sneaks into the living room and sees a female goldfish swimming in a bowl. Tom does not want to eat such a sweet creature at first, but he assuages himself that he must eat. He extends his arm into the bowl and gropes for the fish, but she lets out a bubble that drifts into Jerry's hole and carries the message: \\"Help!\\" Jerry wakes up and grasps a long, slender pin. Tom, triumphant in his success, sneaks back out of the living room, but is soon seen leaping out through the door and through a window in pain from being struck with the pin. Jerry returns the fish to the bowl. Tom revives and removes the pin from his behind, but soon finds he is stuck in a trash can. He pops his arms and eyes out of the can and tests himself with the pin; it will not work on the steel. Tom grabs an axe and rushes into the house. Jerry is terrified at the sight of the \\"evil trash monster\\" and runs toward his hole, suffering numerous near misses from the axe. Tom continues chopping at the hole, but Jerry inserts Tom's tail in the axe's path. Tom soon realizes that he's cut up his own tail and screws it back on before he hears a whistle. It is Jerry waving at him, with a grease slick set out for the cat. Tom cannot see the grease and slips on it. Jerry closes the door on Tom, which smashes him into the lid of the can. Tom walks out as Jerry shows him the door and he falls onto an open trash can. The trash man soon collects him and he is dumped into the trash truck, which drives away. After a few seconds, the cat walks back down the street, fuming. Tom goes to the garden and he removes tacks from inside his foot, and he begins his plan for revenge. He sneaks back into the house with a hose system and sees Jerry standing guard with another long pin. Tom hides under the table and builds his hose system with a lot of residual noise. Jerry and the fish appear terrified. Tom emerges and lays the hose around the house until he runs out. Jerry begins scratching his head when suddenly the fish disappears down a hole in the bowl. Jerry pulls her out and realizes that Tom is sucking into the water and spitting it out so that he will eventually swallow the fish, except that Jerry already pulled her out of the hose without Tom knowing. Jerry fills a large container with water to serve as a temporary bowl. Whilst Tom is still at it, Jerry sees all the water disappearing from the bowl and then sees part of the hose. Jerry comes up with an idea and dashes off while Tom is beginning to get frustrated. After some time, Tom notices that the room he is in is now half-flooded with water and he still hasn't got the fish, but he continues on sucking and spitting out the water, unaware that Jerry has hooked up the other end of the hose to a full bathtub. Jerry waves at the passing truck labeled \\"SEA VIEW PET SHOP\\" and it dumps its cargo in: a large green shark, which sees Jerry and attempts to devour the mouse, but is sucked into the hose by Tom. Tom, who apparently has filled the entire room with water, then sees that he has sucked the shark into the hose. In an attempt to push the shark back into the bathtub, Tom puffs up the hose but the shark bursts it. The shark chases after Tom and bites his tail which rips off Tom's fur. Tom swims off half-naked through the wall and the grass. With Tom gone, Jerry begins to charm the fish, but is soon terrified by the shark that has entered the fishbowl. Jerry panics and follows the same route Tom took out of the house before the shark can eat him while he charms her with a grin. ==Crew== *Animation: Don Towsley, Tom Ray, Dick Thompson, Ben Washam & Ken Harris *Layouts: Don Morgan & Robert Givens *Backgrounds: Philip DeGuard *Design Consultant: Maurice Noble *Vocal Effects: Mel Blanc, William Hanna & June Foray *Production Manager: Earl Jonas *Story: Bob Ogle *Music: Dean Elliott *Production Supervised by Les Goldman *Produced by Chuck Jones *Directed by Abe Levitow ==External links== * * Category:1966 animated films Category:1966 films Category:1966 short films Category:Animated films about fish Category:Films directed by Abe Levitow Category:Tom and Jerry short films Category:1960s American animated films Category:American films Category:American short films Category:1966 comedy films Category:American film remakes Category:Films scored by Dean Elliott Category:Films without speech Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer short films Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer animated short films ","title":"Filet Meow"},{"id":"11650390","text":"2 Entertain (stylized as 2 | entertain) is a British video and music publisher formed by the merger of BBC Video and Video Collection International in 2004. Under CEO Richard Green, the company operated as a joint venture between BBC Worldwide and the Woolworths Group until BBC bought out Woolworths' share following the latter's administration in 2008. As of November 2013, the 2 Entertain branding is only used on non-BBC releases; the BBC label has since been used on its own material instead. ==History== ===BBC Video=== The first BBC Video opening logo, used from 1980‚Äì1988. BBC Video was established in 1980 as a division of BBC Enterprises (later BBC Worldwide) with John Ross Barnard at the head. At launch, the BBC had no agreement with British talent unions such as Equity or the Musician's Union (MU), so BBC Video was limited in the television programming it could release. Initially, video cassette and laser- disc releases were either programmes with no Equity or MU involvement, such as natural history and other documentaries, or material licensed from third parties, including feature films such as High Noon and the first video release of Deep Purple's California Jam concert. For the first few years, the BBC produced videotapes in both VHS and Beta-max formats. The company also worked with Philips on early Laserdisc releases, including a notable ornithology disc called British Garden Birds, presented by David Attenborough. This disc was published in 1982 and included digital data in the form of Teletext, which could be read by any suitably-equipped television. This pioneering use of a data channel on a consumer video format led directly to the development of the BBC Domesday Project in 1984‚Äì1986. Since videos could have stereo soundtracks, BBC Video produced stereophonic versions of many programmes that had been broadcast in mono. These included The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy (although release was delayed for lack of an Equity agreement) and the wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer. By 1982, an agreement had been reached with the Musicians' Union and this led to some popular music releases (including compilations by John Martyn and Tom Robinson). The label grew significantly from ¬£13 million turnover in 1989 to nearly ¬£39 million in 1994. In 1991, BBC Video was the number-one video label in the UK when it sold more prerecorded videotapes, by value as well as by unit count, than any other company, including all of the Hollywood studios. BBC Video was well known for its releases of David Attenborough, Pride and Prejudice, The Human Body, Dinnerladies, Walking with Dinosaurs, The Goodies, Dad's Army, Yes Minister, Fawlty Towers, Blackadder, Only Fools and Horses, Wallace & Gromit, The Office, Red Dwarf and Doctor Who. ===Video Collection International=== Video Collection International was a video company based in London, England. It was opened in 1984. Originally part of the Prestwich Group, based in New Southgate, London, the company was subject to a management buyout headed by Steve Ayres CEO and Paddy Toomey (ex-Woolworths) as MD. The vision of \\"sell through video\\" was born with the strong Woolworths association driving the retail sales. With these individuals at the helm, the company expanded rapidly, securing the market lead in retail video sales throughout the mid to late 1980s and into the early to mid-1990s. The company mainly served as a home video label for Incorporated Television Company (ITC) television programmes, but launched the Central Video, Granada Media, Thames Video, Channel 4 Video and the Cinema Club labels in the process. The Cinema Club label mainly consisted of re-releases of films from the late 1960s and early 1970s and also had licensing agreements with Columbia Pictures and TriStar Pictures to re-release their films. After suffering financial losses in 1995, the company changed its name to VCI. It discontinued the Cinema Club label in 1999 and re-established it under the \\"FilmFour\\" name, although the Cinema Club logo would still be used for occasional budgeted titles after that. At its peak VCI plc consisted of Video Collection Ltd, Music Collection Ltd, Andr√© Deutsch (book publisher) and Disc Distribution. In 1999 the business was sold to the Kingfisher Group. In 1999, FilmFour began releasing DVDs. The company split into two arms: publishing (VCI) based in Dean Street, London, and VCI Distribution, which also handled third-party distribution for labels outside its own stable, based in Watford and the old premises in New Southgate. Soon after, the company discontinued Thames Video and introduced the Granada Media label, which would soon appear on most VCI titles. In 2001, VCI became part of the Woolworths Group as a result of the demerger from the Kingfisher Group. In 2004, BBC Worldwide and Woolworths Group merged VCI with BBC Video to create 2 Entertain Video, part of their new joint venture company 2 Entertain. In 2005, Channel 4 began releasing titles on DVD themselves under the brand name Channel 4 DVD, they would eventually go on to have their DVDs released by Spirit Entertainment, though still using Channel 4 DVD branding. VCI is perhaps most well known as the main home video distributor of both ITV and Channel 4 television programmes such as Thomas & Friends, Black Books, Drop the Dead Donkey, Peep Show, Jeeves and Wooster, So Graham Norton, Men Behaving Badly, V Graham Norton, Spaced, Shameless, Father Ted, Mr. Bean, Traffik, Emmerdale, Brass Eye, Da Ali G Show and Coronation Street. Confusion often arose between this UK-based company, and the Tulsa, Oklahoma-based home video label VCI Entertainment, founded in 1976 by Bill Blair. At the height of the UK label's popularity, the US-based label rebranded themselves as United Home Video; however, they returned to the VCI name in the mid-'90s and have retained it ever since. Perhaps as a result of this, when VCI entered the American market in the early 1990s, they went under the name of Strand VCI Entertainment, and then Strand Home Video; this operation was sold in 1993 to budget video label Video Treasures (later a core component of Anchor Bay Entertainment), who completed the label's absorption in 1994. ==References== ==External links== * * * * * * Category:2004 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:BBC Category:ITV (TV network) Category:Channel 4 Category:DVD companies of the United Kingdom Category:Entertainment companies established in 2004 Category:Home video companies established in 2004 Category:F.

The movie is based upon the 1957 short story Sentimental Education by Harold Brodkey. The original music score was composed by John Barry. However, much of his score was unused in favor of songs from Cat Stevens and Paul Williams, and material from Carmine Coppola and Jean Sibelius, resulting in Barry removing his name from the credits.p.8, \\"Move Over, Darling\\", Jeff Bond, liner notes of First Love soundtrack album, La-La Land Records LLLCD 1243 ==Plot== Elgin (William Katt) is a college student who spends much of his time studying literature and concentrating on his physical fitness by playing solitary soccer. One day, he overhears his friend David (John Heard) making love next door. He then hears David's girlfriend pounding on the door, demanding to know who's in his room with him. Shelly (Beverly D'Angelo) comes into Elgin's room wearing only a towel, implying she was the woman with David just a moment ago. Shelly says she will only be there for a short time until David finishes making love with his girlfriend; but it takes a lot longer. David thanks Elgin by setting him up with Shelly. Elgin first sees Caroline (Susan Dey) during a meal. After the meal, Elgin and Shelly separate from David and his girlfriend, ending up in his room. Shelly declares that she likes Elgin and offers to make love to him. When she disrobes, he is shocked and spurns her advances. In a later scene, Elgin is working as the busboy at the school's cafeteria. There, he has his first conversation with Caroline but ends up spilling tea on her and her book. She still leaves her dormitory name on a sheet of paper and he goes to see her with a new copy of the book. After a rough start, she agrees to go and have coffee with him. She alludes to having another boyfriend, but he is smitten and decides to join a class she is in, three weeks after it had started. After talking to Caroline, Elgin learns that her father had died a long time ago. They go on their first real date to the symphony and the chemistry between them becomes clear. Caroline introduces Elgin to the other man, John (Robert Loggia), who is already married. She is visibly shaken by this meeting and asks to spend a night with Elgin, because she doesn't want to be alone. Their love making is interrupted by David who says Elgin is late for work. Elgin runs to work and David convinces Caroline to take a ride back to her dorm on his motorcycle. Elgin spots them together and he fights David in a jealous rage; but feels better when Caroline tells him that she's not interested in David. Elgin gets fired for being late to work. David and Caroline watch Elgin while he plays a successful game of soccer. Elgin and Caroline were making love again when he asks about John (Robert Loggia), who worked with her father as a lawyer, and whom she had known all her life. He gets jealous after he learns that she slept with John, but Caroline gets mad about the entire conversation. Elgin gets nervous when he can't get hold of her, but finds a note which tells him to join her, alone, at her family's estate. Elgin meets Caroline and they pick up where they left off, but she resists him while they are in her childhood playhouse. She told him that this is the place where her father committed suicide. The phone rings before they drive together back to school. During the drive, Caroline tells him that it was John on the phone. Carolin explains that John wants her back, and they can't see each other any more. Elgin pulls his motorcycle out from the back of the car and leaves her on the side of the road alone in the car. Elgin returns to his dorm to find Shelly sitting by his door. Shelly declares her love for David, but thinks he doesn't feel the same. Elgin turns Shelly down for sex a second time. Elgin runs into Caroline saying goodbye to John. She told Elgin that she's with John and it's over between them. Elgin gets drunk and again finds Shelly at his door. Elgin accepts Shelly's third proposition; but she leaves in the middle of their tryst when he calls her Caroline. Elgin goes to Caroline's shared class, but leaves in the middle of the lecture when she doesn't show up. Elgin then goes to see John at his office. He professes his love to Caroline and asks John if his intentions are honorable. John says he has a shaky marriage, but his kids are important and doesn't know if he can divorce his wife. Caroline shows up in Elgin's room in the middle of the night, makes love to him, and then brings him breakfast in the morning. John decides he won't get the divorce, but Elgin is mad that he's second best. Elgin runs into David at school and he tells him that he and Shelly are engaged. Elgin takes Caroline back, despite this fact. This eventually tears him up inside and he tells Caroline his love for her is gone and their relationship is over. He says goodbye to her as she leaves him alone on a train. He is shown back playing solitary soccer as the credits roll. ==Main cast== * William Katt as Elgin Smith * Susan Dey as Caroline Hedges * John Heard as David Bonner * Beverly D'Angelo as Shelley * Robert Loggia as John March * Swoosie Kurtz as Marsha * Tom Lacy as Professor Oxton * June Barrett as Felicia ==Production== The film was shot on location in Portland, Oregon, including at Reed College and the Pittock Mansion. ==Rating== In the United States, the film is rated R for its nudity and sexual content. ==Reception== Janet Maslin of The New York Times found director Joan Darling \\"peculiarly misogynistic\\" in the way the two female lead characters \\"both pounce avariciously upon Mr. Katt, who seems passive and rather saintly under pressure ...

Tom Milne of The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote, \\"Fulsomely cradled in slow motion and caressing dissolves, sprinkled with cultural references to Dante and idealistic philosophies, indulging much lachrymose drivel about first love and its irreparable loss, this Son of Love Story similarly tries to prove that the spirit of romance is not dead and proceeds to administer a cruel coup de gr√¢ce.\\" Michael Eisner of Paramount said the film did not lose money \\"but was not a success\\". ==Home media== The film was released on VHS and DVD.

It was built and utilized by buccaneers as the primary defense of the island to prevent encroachment of Spanish forces. The fortress lies in ruin today, with only the foundations remaining. ==History== Tortuga was a disputed island in the early seventeenth century. The Spanish laid claim to it, but English and French settlers were the primary occupants. Every few years the Spanish would sail over and chase away the settlers, reclaiming the island, then vacate it. As soon as the Spanish warships were out of sight, the settlers would return. In 1640 a French engineer named Jean La Vasseur raided the island with a force of between fifty and one-hundred men, claiming the primary port as theirs. Aware of the predations of the Spanish, La Vasseur had Fort de Rocher constructed overlooking the harbor, thus fortifying it from further foreign assault. With its cannons drawing a steady aim at any vessels approaching the harbor the fort gave La Vasseur a high degree of control over the island. In the early 1640s La Vasseur was made governor of Tortuga, but the information conflicts as to when specifically that was (some accounts claim he was governor before arriving on the island, and others say he claimed power after building the fort). The erection of the fort concerned the Spanish. Shortly after construction was complete, an invading force launched from Santo Domingo and sailed into the harbor of Tortuga. The French guns sank one of the vessels and scattered the rest. The Spaniards who managed to land marched into an ambush, and then retreated. The victory greatly increased the reputation of La Vasseur, Tortuga, and it's Buccaneers. The official lawlessness of the place appealed to all of the seafaring brigands in the Caribbean. La Vasseur opened the port to outlaws of all nations in exchange for a percentage of the wealth of every vessel anchoring there. All pirates needed a safe place to berth, and a town that was respectful of their careers was a prime one. Tortuga quickly became the first great pirate outpost. The reports about La Vasseur‚Äôs rule vary widely. The one common thread among them, though, is that in 1653 he was assassinated by two of his trusted lieutenants. As the story goes, La Vasseur had stolen away one of his lieutenant‚Äôs mistresses and abused her. The two men schemed to get him out of the fort where they could perform the treachery unseen. While inspecting a warehouse, the jilted lover wounded him with a musket first and then both men finished him off with daggers. The story may or may not be true, but it is widely accepted that La Vasseur was assassinated by his men in 1653. With La Vasseur dead, the French assigned Chevalier de Fontenay as Governor of Tortuga. As a leader, de Fontenay didn‚Äôt take the safeguarding of the port as seriously as La Vasseur did. The Spanish were able to see the fort‚Äôs influence decline and in 1654, while many of the Buccaneers were at sea or off hunting, they raided the port. The Spanish were rebuffed, but they mounted a second attack later in the year. This time, they knew the strengths and weaknesses of the fortress, and managed to get artillery placed on the hillside above it. After a siege of about nine days, the Buccaneers who had holed up in the fort surrendered and were banished from the island. The Spanish reclaimed the island, demolished much of the fort, and then vacated back to Santo Domingo. The fort was allowed to decay into history and today only its foundations remain. ==Geography== On the southeast side of Tortuga is a natural harbor. The harbor is protected by reefs and is flanked on the west by a Mangrove thicket and the town of Cayenne, and on the east by the town of Basse Terre. The remains of the fort are on the hillside, about 1/3 mile (or 1.6 km) above the harbor or Basse Terre. Its approximate location is 20¬∞,-72.7¬∞. Using Google Maps, you can see the remains of the coastal battery outlined by vegetation. ==Description== Fort de Rocher was built circa 1640 by Jean La Vasseur, an engineer by trade. It was built around a steep rock which stood thirty feet high and which was central on a plateau from the hillside. The plateau was relatively flat-topped and La Vasseur built terraces and breastworks all along its edges and into the hillside, enough to accommodate hundreds of men. Star forts were being employed in Europe at this time, so Fort de Rocher was built with two star-points, or redans, facing the coast. The hillside was cleared of trees to give a nearly 180¬∞ view of the waterfront. The fortress boasted 24 guns overlooking the harbor and its environs. It also housed a natural water spring. Atop the mighty rock which dominated the fortress, La Vasseur placed his reduit, which he named Dovecote. There was only one path that allowed entrance up into the building, the first half of which was a stairway carved into the rock itself. The second half was by a ladder that could be lowered from the top. The fortress used a storehouse for food, guns, and ammunition, and also acted as La Vasseur‚Äôs abode. Rumor has it that La Vasseur had a cruel streak. Some sources claim that he had an iron cage built that was used as a prison. It wasn‚Äôt tall enough for a person to stand upright, nor was it long or wide enough for a person to lie down. The cage was dubbed \\"Little Hell\\" and was housed inside Dovecote. The fortress stood against many assaults. Its existence and toughness provided a principal base of operations for pirates in the Caribbean. The fact that it was only defeated through the treachery of La Vasseur‚Äôs trusted men is a testimony to its strength. ==See also== * Buccaneers * Capture of Fort Rocher * Piracy in the Caribbean * Port Royal * Tortuga ==References== ==External links== * Piratical History of Tortuga Rocher Category:Tortuga (Haiti) Category:1640 establishments in the French colonial empire ","title":"Fort de Rocher"},{"id":"11650512","text":"Reutje or 't Reutje (Limburgish: t R√§√∂tje) is a small village in Dutch Limburg.

Bushong also made appearances as an umpire and after his retirement from baseball, he practiced as a dentist. Some sources credit him with the invention of the catcher's mitt. ==Early life== Descended from the Colonial immigrant Bushong family, Albert John Bushong was born September 15, 1856, in Philadelphia, the son of Charles A. Bushong and Margaret Moore Bushong. Bushong attended public schools in Philadelphia and graduated from Central High School in 1876. After playing baseball in various minor league teams for a couple of years, he enrolled in 1878 in dental school at the University of Pennsylvania. Bushong was one of the first to matriculate in the brand-new Department of Dentistry and he received his D.D.S. in 1882.University of Pennsylvania Alumni Profiles While attending dental school, he played professional baseball every year, catching in more than 230 games as well as \\"barnstorming\\" in the off-season with a different team, the Hop Bitters. Bushong was the first University of Pennsylvania graduate to play in Major League baseball. He did not play ball for the university, as he was already playing pro-ball. Shortly after graduation Albert J. Bushong and Theresa M. Gottery were married and together they had seven children. ==Baseball career== Doc Bushong on an 1887 baseball card. His baseball career, spanned from 1875 to 1891, and Bushong played on various professional minor league and major league teams, including the Brooklyn Atlantics (1875), Philadelphia Athletics (1876), Worcester Ruby Legs (1880‚Äì82), Cleveland Blues (1883‚Äì84), St. Louis Browns (1885‚Äì87), Brooklyn Bridegrooms (1888‚Äì90). Some believe his greatest success came in the latter part of his career, when Bushong played on five pennant winning teams and was in post-season play five times. His most notable performance is most likely in the 1886 St. Louis Browns of the American Association when they beat the Chicago White Stockings of the National League, for the Championship (later called World Series). For his part in the championship, in 1886, the Missouri Pacific Railroad, honored Bushong and several other players by renaming some of their whistle-stop towns. The town of Weeks in Kansas, became, Bushong, Kansas. In 1887 Bushong became one of the first baseball players to do paid product endorsements, in an advertisement for Merrell's Penetrating Oil, which was a cold medicine. Leading up to the 1888 season, Bushong made news again, when Chris von der Ahe owner of the St. Louis Browns sold the contracts for Bushong, along with pitcher \\"Parisian Bob\\" Caruthers, and first baseman/outfielder/pitcher Dave Foutz. The sale was to the Brooklyn Bride Grooms and their owner, Charlie Byrne who paid, what was then, the enormous sum of $19,000, for the trio.\\"Noted Ball Player Dead\\", The New York Times, August 21, 1908. On July 4, 1889, in the second game of a doubleheader in St. Louis, Bushong injured his arm and played in only two more games during the regular season. He never fully recovered from the injury, which marked the beginning of the end of his baseball career. The 1890 season, was Bushong's last on the Bridegrooms and in major league baseball and he was officially released on March 26, 1891. Within a couple of weeks still wanting to play for the 1891 season, Bushong signed on with a minor league team and eventually played on two different teams through mid-July before he was released. ===Catcher's mitt=== Doc Bushong in the 1888 Old Judge baseball card, showing glove. In a game that was traditionally played bare-handed, it is difficult to say who was first to make and use the padded catcher's mitt similar to today's glove. The first player to wear a glove was catcher Doug Allison, in 1870. In 1888, Joe Gunson described his catcher's mitt, and is sometimes associated with its invention, along with Doc Bushong and others. But his claim as first is brought into question by a Brooklyn Eagle article that describes Bushong with his special glove at least a season before Gunson's claim. But on July 1, 1887, while at bat in the sixth inning of a game against Louisville, Bushong's fingers were mashed by a wild pitch from Louisville switch pitcher Ice Box ChamberlainSt. Paul Daily Globe, July 02, 1887 The injury resulted in a broken finger and prevented him from playing for almost ten and a half weeks. But it is easy to believe that on September 18, 1887 when he returned, Bushong had seriously padded a mitt to protect his hand as well his dentistry profession. Further, an article in October 13, 1887, by the Brooklyn Eagle, tells of Bushong losing his old glove.... The photographs taken of Bushong, used for the 1888 season, on the Old Judge baseball cards, show him with thick gloves on both hands, but in 1889 Sporting Life magazine described his mitt as a spring mattress on his left hand.. In the end, most agree that Bushong certainly deserves credit in the evolution of the catcher's mitt and with his known motivation to protect his hands, many believe that he was its primary inventor. ===Scandal in the 1889 World Series=== Albert Doc Bushong back row, 2nd from right, with 1889 Brooklyn Bridegrooms. A minor scandal involving Bushong and the 1889 World Series came to light in November 1889. Following the Bridegrooms' series loss to the New York Giants, six games to three, a telegram from Bushong to Giants catcher Jocko Milligan was revealed. The scheme involved a $400 prize to the individual winners of the series. The prize had been offered by a chewing gum firm, likely the Green and Blackwell Company of New York, known as G and B Chewing Gum Co., who in 1888, were first to issue gum with their baseball cards.A Brief History of Baseball Cards Bushong's idea was prize sharing, where, before the actual games, they were to agree, whoever was the winner would split the prize with the loser. In the newspapers, it was briefly mentioned as cheating, even though the practice was common in numerous sports and had been around in baseball for over a decade. Though embarrassed over the affair, nothing more came of it and Bushong continued playing. ==Later life== Doc Bushong's 1908 obituary from the New York Times Following his baseball retirement in 1891, Bushong, then 33 years old, began practicing dentistry full-time along with two brothers, who were also dentists, at a large dental house in Hoboken, New Jersey. Eventually he became manager of the establishment. Also while working in Hoboken, he began and, according to baseball historian William Rankin, \\"built up a large and flourishing practice\\", at his home in south Brooklyn, 442 Ninth Street. On November 9, 1898 Bushong's 4-year-old son died after being severely burned in an election night bonfire, which were common ritual at the time. Eventually three of his sons, as well as a nephew, also became Brooklyn dentists and several worked at the Bushong family business, which was in operation as late as 1942. On August 19, 1908 Albert John Bushong died of cancer at his home, 442 Ninth Street, Brooklyn, at the age of 51 and was buried in the Holy Cross Cemetery, Brooklyn, New York.Doc Bushong's grave site on Find a Grave ==Notes== ==References== ==Further reading== * *University of Pennsylvania Alumni Profile, Doc Bushong ==External links== * Baseball Almanac Category:1856 births Category:1908 deaths Category:19th-century baseball players Category:Central High School (Philadelphia) alumni Category:Major League Baseball catchers Category:Brooklyn Atlantics players Category:Philadelphia Athletics (NL) players Category:Worcester Ruby Legs players Category:Cleveland Blues (NL) players Category:St. Louis Browns (AA) players Category:Brooklyn Bridegrooms players Category:Janesville Mutual players Category:Buffalo (minor league baseball) players Category:Utica (minor league baseball) players Category:Worcester Grays players Category:Lebanon Cedars players Category:Syracuse Stars (minor league baseball) players Category:Baseball players from Pennsylvania Category:Sportspeople from Philadelphia Category:American dentists Category:University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine alumni ","title":"Doc Bushong"},{"id":"11650544","text":"Haunted Forest is a 2007 horror film about a man driven by his grandfather's mysterious past, Sean (Sevy Di Cione) searches for the key to a man's sudden disappearance within a dark forest.

Of these, 9,311 (69.6%) lived in urban areas and 4,065 (30.4%) in rural areas. The population grew by 14.9% (1,730 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses. Its population density was then , making it the most sparsely populated commune in the region. ==Economy== Among the present economic activities mining stands out, including the exploitation of stone quarries, the production of local products such as almonds and nuts, craftsmanship of different rock types, among others. Regional tourism is very important in this zone, as there are a great number of food and lodging establishments. In 2001 the commune was declared a National Tourism Interest Zone (Zona de Inter√©s Tur√≠stico Nacional), by the National Service of Tourism (SERNATUR). == History == San Jose de Maipo was named a town by order of Ambrosio O'Higgins in 1792. The Governor of Chile and future Viceroy of Peru considered it necessary to give it the power of a town to better support mining that took place around San Pedro Nolasco. During the 19th century the area was the scene of several important events in the independence of Chile, since because of its proximity to Argentina the area was used by General San Martin and the liberating Army of the Andes to support the Bernardine cause of O'Higgins. At the end of that century mining began in the area. During the 20th Century, the commune became very important for the city of Santiago, since the first hydroelectric power station of the zone was constructed there (Maitenes), and also an aqueduct was constructed that supplies potable water to the city from Andean glaciers. Because of the purity of its air, sanatoriums were built for respiratory patients from all over Chile. Towards the end of the century ecotourism became a pole of development, thanks to the Maipo river's suitability for rafting. ==Administration== As a commune, San Jos√© de Maipo is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. For the years 2012-2016 the mayor is Luis Pezoa √Ålvarez (RN), and the council members are: * Maite Birke Abaroa (PRI) * Andr√©s Venegas Veliz (PRSD) * Marco Quintanilla Pizarro (PS) * Andy Ortiz Apablaza (IND) * Eduardo Astorga Flores (RN) * Carmen Larenas Whipple (RN) Within the electoral divisions of Chile, San Jos√© de Maipo is represented in the Chamber of Deputies of the National Congress of Chile by Osvaldo Andrade (PS) and Leopoldo P√©rez (RN) as part of the 29th electoral district, (together with Puente Alto, Pirque and La Pintana). The commune is represented in the Senate by Soledad Alvear (PDC) and Pablo Longueira (UDI) as part of the 8th senatorial constituency (Santiago-East). ==References== ==External links== * Municipality of San Jos√© de Maipo Category:Communes of Chile Category:Populated places in Cordillera Province Category:1792 establishments in the Spanish Empire ","title":"San Jos√© de Maipo"},{"id":"11650614","text":"Almost Made Ya is an R&B; song by American duo Ali & Gipp, for the debut album, Kinfolk (2007).

At Auschwitz, the infamous torture chamber Block 11 was Grabner's own empire. He was executed for crimes against humanity. ==Early life== Born in Vienna, he joined the Austrian police force in 1930 and became a member of the then-illegal Nazi Party in 1933. After the Anschlu√ü of Austria in 1938, he joined the SS and became a member of the Gestapo. He arrived at Katowice at the outbreak of World War II. He was transferred to Auschwitz concentration camp less than one year later where he became Chief of the Politische Abteilung (\\"camp Gestapo\\"). ==Career at Auschwitz== As Gestapo chief he was responsible, among other things, for the fight against the resistance movement in the camp, as well as for the prevention of escapes and all contact with the outside world. These tasks were carried out with horrendous cruelties against the prisoners and a large number of incarcerations in the bunker in Block 11. Grabner's staff members, such as Wilhelm Boger, who was only brought to justice in the early 1960s, carried out so-called sharpened interrogations, during which the victims were systematically tortured. Grabner, together with the commander of the Schutzhaftlager, initiated, on a regular basis, clearings of the bunker: the inmates were examined and many of them were sent directly to the inner courtyard between Block 10 and Block 11, where they were shot. He once ordered SS-Untersturmf√ºhrer Hans Stark to drop Zyklon B into a gas chamber.Rees, Laurence: Auschwitz - the Nazis and the 'Final Solution - BBC Books - 2005 - IBN 0-563-52117-1 (page 96) Along with Stark, Grabner personally took part in the shooting of Russian Commissars. ==Trial and conviction== In 1943, he was arrested for theft, graft and corruption and was put on trial in Weimar a year later. After the trial, he returned to Katowice. Grabner was arrested by the Allies in 1945 and turned over to Poland in 1947. In the Auschwitz Trial he was found guilty of charges of murder and crimes against humanity, and was sentenced to death. Grabner was hanged on 28 January 1948. ==Bibliography== *Ernst Klee: Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich: Wer war was vor und nach 1945.

Before construction could begin, a method for delivering supplies to the point had to be developed. Due to the lack of good roads from the Nawiliwili harbor, the decision was made to bring the materials in by sea. The lighthouse tender Kukui would anchor offshore and then dispatch small boats with supplies to a cove near the point. Since there was no beach landing, the boats would anchor to cleats cemented into the lava rocks at the point. A boom derrick, constructed on a ledge above the water, would lift the supplies from the boats and place them on a loading platform above the water. Finally, after almost four years of planning, construction began in July 1912 and the light was dedicated on May 1, 1913. The tower was built in a Classical Revival architecture style out of reinforced concrete. The tower is a slightly tapering cylinder about high. The upper portion has a steel circular walkway with handrail. The lens is one of only seven second-order Fresnel lenses remaining in a lighthouse in the US. Barbier, Bernard, and Turenne manufactured the lens in Paris, France. The lens floated on mercury and compressed air. The lens was rotated by a system of pulleys powered by weights that needed to be reset by an operator every 3.5 hours. An oil storage house was built southeast of the light, and a small engine house in a small cove below the point. About south is a residential area with three small stone houses. Each house and the lighthouse itself has a water storage tank. The point is accessed from Route 56 (called Kuhio Highway), north of the town of Kƒ´lauea. On June 29, 1927, the United States Army Air Corps pilots of the airplane Bird of Paradise, Lester J. Maitland and Albert F. Hegenberger, were attempting the first transpacific flight from California to Hawaii. An hour before dawn, aware that they were slightly north of their planned course and with their directional radio receiver not functioning, they spotted the Kƒ´lauea Lighthouse as planned to verify their position. A radio beacon was added in 1930, and with the added generator the light was changed to be powered by electricity. Originally 250,000 candle power, the light reached 2,500,000 candle power in 1958. The station was manned until 1974 when it was automated. In February 1976 the light was moved to a nearby smaller tower and the tower was sealed. It was one of the last lights converted to automation by the United States Coast Guard in the Hawaiian Islands. The radio beacon was replaced in 1956, and then in the 1980s converted to a visitor center. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Hawaii in 1979. The historic district included . Kilauea Point, 2008 In 1985 the Kƒ´lauea Point National Wildlife Refuge, starting with the original Coast Guard Station, and then expanding to preserve the surrounding habitat. A new visitor center was built in 1988. The buildings were damaged by Hurricane Iniki in September 1992, but repaired. The visitors center is operated by the Kƒ´lauea Point Natural History Association. Starting in late 2008, the group raised funds for restoration of the lighthouse. ==In popular culture== The Kƒ´lauea Lighthouse can be seen briefly in Disney's animated film Lilo & Stitch, and it plays a more important role in the sequel, Stitch! The Movie. In the film, the lighthouse serves as a rendezvous point where the protagonists are to trade Jumba Jookiba's first 624 experiments (the 625th experiment was taken by Gantu earlier) with the antagonist Dr. Jacques von H√§msterviel for Jumba himself. The lighthouse in the franchise was said in the movie to have shut down years ago due to the financial troubles of keeping it running. Towards the end of the film, however, Experiment 221‚Äîan electrical experiment that Lilo names \\"Sparky\\"‚Äî is given the lighthouse as a new home, and he uses his power to make the beacon shine again. ==See also== *List of lighthouses in Hawaii ==References== == External links == * Kilauea Light Station Restoration Project * Kilauea Lighthouse at lighthousefriends.com * Category:Lighthouses completed in 1913 Category:Lighthouses in Hawaii Category:Lighthouses on the National Register of Historic Places in Hawaii Category:Buildings and structures in Kauai County, Hawaii Category:Tourist attractions in Kauai County, Hawaii Category:1913 establishments in Hawaii Category:National Register of Historic Places in Kauai County, Hawaii ","title":"Kilauea Light"},{"id":"11650701","text":"Robert Earl Holmes (October 5, 1945 ‚Äì April 14, 2018) was an American football running back who played collegiately at Southern University and professionally in the American Football League for the Kansas City Chiefs, and in the National Football League for the Chiefs, the Houston Oilers, and the San Diego Chargers.

On their way there, they encounter a group of college students. After they arrive, George takes Eleanor fishing while Maya goes swimming and Sam and Carry have sex in a tent. However, soon, a massive fog sets in. Maya heads back to the campsite and hears screaming. When she arrives, she sees Sam being horribly dismembered. Maya flees back into the woods and encounters her parents. She tells them about Sam's death, but they are skeptical. Then, Carry's severed head lands next to them and Eleanor is attacked and killed by an unseen monster. George and Maya flee and attempt to barricade themselves inside a cave, but George is dragged into the fog and killed. Maya successfully closes off the entrance to the cave, but hears another monster behind her and screams before the screen cuts to the title. The next day, the seven college students arrive at the same campsite. After they set up the tents, the couples have sex. Dan and Molly have sex in a canoe and Larry and Brandy have sex while skinny dipping. Meanwhile, the single members of the group (Leslie, Mike and Jona) explore the same cave from earlier in the film and Jona tells Leslie that she is in love with Dan. They then find Maya barely alive. She promptly turns into a zombie and bites Mike before Jona beats her to death with a rock. Mike, due to being bitten, turns into a zombie and is killed by Leslie. Leslie and Jona exit the cave and are chased by more zombies, with Leslie killing the reanimated George. They then split up to find the others. Leslie attempts to save Larry and Brandy by paddling out to them on a raft, but reanimated corpses in the lake kill Larry. After Leslie pulls Brandy onto the raft, Brandy discovers that she was bitten, and Leslie mercy kills her with a knife. Meanwhile, Jona helps Dan and Molly out of the canoe. Dan and Jona race ahead, while Molly lags behind. Jona goes back to help her, but instead kills her by stabbing her in the neck with a stick, and tells Dan that she was eaten by zombies. Dan and Jona run through the woods for several hours and finally make it to a road and celebrate by making out. They see a car coming and think that they are saved, but they soon realize that the driver is a zombie. The car veers off the road, hitting and killing Dan. The zombies chase Jona back to the canoe, where a crowd of zombies, including a reanimated Molly, rip Jona to shreds. Leslie discovered an abandoned military base in the woods, where she fins an old grenade. Leslie repairs an old armored vehicle and tries to use it to escape, but the car is blocked by a swarm of zombies. She is able to blow up enough zombies with the grenade so that she is able to get away. Leslie drives to the city, only to discover that it has been overrun with zombies. She is last seen driving into the desert, with her ultimate fate being left uncertain. ==Trivia== Forest of the Dead was complete on January, 2002.

In articles published in Sports Illustrated, Medium, and on the Concussion Legacy Foundation's website, Hines‚Äô son, also a former football player at Arkansas, Marine Corps Colonel, and author, described Hines‚Äô physical and cognitive decline in his later years and how the family's efforts to recover funding for medical care and treatment under the league's settlement with players - which were supported by the requisite diagnoses made by numerous board-certified doctors - were nevertheless summarily rejected by the NFL in the months before Hines died in February, 2019. ==See also== *Other American Football League players ==References== Category:1943 births Category:2019 deaths Category:All-American college football players Category:American Football League All-Star players Category:American football offensive linemen Category:Arkansas Razorbacks baseball players Category:Arkansas Razorbacks football players Category:Houston Oilers players Category:New Orleans Saints players Category:People from El Dorado, Arkansas Category:Pittsburgh Steelers players Category:Houston Texans (WFL) players Category:American Football League players Category:Players of American football from Arkansas Category:Deaths from dementia Category:Disease-related deaths in Arkansas ","title":"Glen Ray Hines"},{"id":"11650827","text":"Wheelbarrow racers A wheelbarrow race is a competitive game in which teams of two players race with one teammate playing the role of the driver, and the other playing the role of the wheelbarrow.

Illuc etiam Bratizlao dux Boemorum, Kazmir Bolaniorum, Zemuzil Bomeraniorum advenerunt atque regem donis decentibus honoraverunt. [...] Inde discedens apostolorum Petri et Pauli festa [29 June] Mihsina celebravit ubi etiam conventionem secundo habens duces praefatos inter se pacificavit.\\" (Annales Altahensis maiorum ad a. 1046) This entry describes Zemuzil's attendance of a meeting with Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor in Merseburg (\\"Mersiburc\\") on 24 June 1046, along with Bretislaus I, Duke of Bohemia (\\"Bratizlao dux Boemorum\\") and Casimir I of Poland (\\"Kazmir Bolaniorum\\"). The dukes \\"honored the emperor with decent gifts\\", which according to Schmidt (2009) was the payment of tribute. In a second meeting on 29 June in Mei√üen (\\"Mihsin\\"), according to the document, the \\"aforementioned dukes\\" concluded a mutual peace agreement. ==Scholarly assessment== ===Nature of the dispute=== Roderich Schmidt (2009) assumes that the peace referenced in the document was necessary, among other reasons, because of fights between Zemuzil and Casimir, and that Zemuzil aided Miec≈Çaw of Mazovia who had fought against Casimir, previously expelled from Poland but restored with Henry's aid, and was defeated. Referring to Steindorff, Ernst (1874): Jahrb√ºcher des Deutschen Reichs unter Heinrich III. pp. 298ff., source cited there is Chron. Polon. Lib. I c.20, c.21 According to Edward Rymar (2005) the most likely nature of the dispute was the non payment of tribute by the Pomeranian duke to Casimir. After Henry's intermediation Zemuzil failed to pay feudal dues and Casimir invaded and took control of Pomerania in the following year (1047).Edward Rymar, Rodow√≥d ksiƒÖ≈ºƒÖt pomorskich (Genealogy of Dukes of Pomerania), KsiƒÖ≈ºnica Pomorska, 2005, pg. 79 ===≈Ωemu≈æilse's realm=== According to Schmidt it is not possible on the basis of the 1046 record to decide the location of his realm. Edward Rymar, following ≈Åowmia≈Ñski, believes that ≈Ωemu≈æilis was a ruler of a unified Pomeranian state with its center in Ko≈Çobrzeg (Kolberg) rather than a smaller duchy, which explains why he was treated by Henry as a co-equal with the rulers of Bohemia and Poland. Schmidt also argues that the mention of ≈Ωemu≈æilis along with Bretislaus and Casimir suggest that they were equal in status, and that the political organisation of his realm in 1046 resembled the Bohemian and Polish ones. On the other hand, Stabenow (1995) says that the great majority of historians regard Zemuzil as ruler of only a part of the area between Oder, Baltic Sea, Vistula, Warta and Noteƒá, and that the location of his realm within this area is disputed. Stabenow further says that the 1046 entry constitutes the first written record of the Baltic Pomeranians. ===Name=== Historians have made several attempts to reconstruct the duke's Slavic name from the version recorded by a German chronicler, \\"≈Ωemu≈æils\\". Before the connection between the document from 1040 and the one from 1046 was made the name was variously rendered as Ziemomys≈Ç (by Oswald Balcer), Siemosi≈Ç (by Aleksander Br√ºckner) and even Wszemys≈Ç (this particular variant has been abandoned as a hypothesis). Zygmunt Wojciechowski in consultation with Slavicists considered \\"≈Ωemu≈æilis\\" to correspond to the diminutive form \\"Siemys≈Ç\\", short for \\"Siemomys≈Ç\\". The name appears among the members of the Piast dynasty with the Polish duke Siemomys≈Ç and the stem \\"-Siem\\", referring to \\"family\\" (hence \\"Siemomys≈Ç\\" is someone \\"thoughtful of their family\\"), is also found in the Piast name of the half-legendary Siemowit. ===Religion=== According to Rymar, Zemuzil was most likely a Christian or otherwise he would not have had Henry's support, although he might have kept this fact hidden from his still mostly pagan subjects. ===Proposed genealogies=== According to Edward Rymar, Zemuzil is often thought to have been the father or the grand father of the Pomeranian Duke ≈öwiƒôtobor I.Edward Rymar, Rodow√≥d ksiƒÖ≈ºƒÖt pomorskich (Genealogy of Dukes of Pomerania), KsiƒÖ≈ºnica Pomorska, 2005, pg. 78 Schmidt says it is not possible on the basis of the 1046 record to decide whether Zemuzil was an ancestor of later Pomeranian dukes, and cites similar conclusions of other German historians Martin Wehrmann and Adolf Hofmeister. The 19th century German historian Johann Ludwig Quandt believed that Zemuzil and other early Pomeranian dukes of the Griffin dynasty descended from Polish nobility of Lesser Poland, that Zemuzil was made a voivode of his duchy by the Polish king Boles≈Çaw I Chrobry, and that he was the grand father of ≈öwiƒôtobor I.Rymar, pg. 38 The Austro-Polish historian Oswald Balzer linked the duke with the Piast dynasty through a matrilineal connection, making his mother the daughter of Boles≈Çaw I Chrobry.Rymar, pgs. 40-41 In a similar way, Henryk ≈Åowmia≈Ñski saw Zemuzil as the son of a daughter of Mieszko I, the first historical ruler of Poland.Rymar, pg. 46 Gerard Labuda said that Zemuzil was most likely related to the Piasts through his mother. Rymar says that the 1040 document is one of the reasons why Zemuzil is sometimes thought to be related to the Polish Piast dynasty.Rymar, pg. 77 Stanis≈Çaw Zakrzewski believed the duke to be a brother of the Dytryk proposed as the father of Sememizl by Labuda, and also hypothesized that Zemuzil was an ancestor of ≈öwiƒôtobor.Rymar, pg. 59 ===Sememizl=== A document from 1040 mentions a Sememizl.; Rymar (2005), p. 77 This document is a record of Henry III bestowing upon the cathedral in Naumburg few villages which Sememizl previously held as fiefs from Henry III. According to Edward Rymar, Sememizl is generally identified with Zemuzil due to rarity of this name among Polish Piasts and Pomeranian dukes. Gerard Labuda doubted a connection between Zemuzil and Sememizl, whom he thought to be a son of Dytryk, one of the step brothers of Chrobry who had been banished by the Polish king to Germany.Rymar, pg. 46 ==References== Category:Dukes of Pomerania Category:11th-century rulers in Europe Category:Medieval nobility of the Holy Roman Empire Category:11th-century Polish people ","title":"Siemomys≈Ç, Duke of Pomerania"},{"id":"11650835","text":"Religion in Greece is dominated by the Greek Orthodox Church, which is within the larger communion of the Eastern Orthodox Church. It represented 90% of the total population in 2015 and is constitutionally recognized as the \\"prevailing religion\\" of Greece. Religions with smaller numbers of followers include Islam (comprising 2% of the population), Catholicism (comprising less than 1% of the population), Evangelicalism, Hellenic Paganism, Sikhism and Hinduism. Also a small number of Greek Atheists exists, not self-identifying as religious. Religion is key part of identity for most Greeks, with 76% of Greeks in a 2015-17 survey saying that their nationality is defined by Christianity. Statistics on metaphysics and worldview, do not concern narrowly only the hyponym religion. ==Christianity== As of 2015, 93% of the population of Greece were Christians. ===Eastern Orthodoxy=== Our Lady of Tinos The Greek Orthodox Church retains close ties with the Greek state, emphasized by the presence of Greek flags in all Orthodox churches, but also by the religious depiction of the flag and the coat of arms of Greece itself. The Church of Greece, a member of the Eastern Orthodox Communion, is accorded the status of \\"prevailing religion\\" in Greece's constitution. Since 1850, Greek Orthodoxy within Greece is handled by the Church.Kenneth Scott Latourette, Christianity in a Revolutionary Age, II: The Nineteenth Century in Europe: The Protestant and Eastern Churches. (1959) 2: 479-481 Its members comprise between 88% and 95-98% of the population, the most recent Pew report gave a percentage of 90% as 2015 numbers. The status of the Orthodox church as the \\"prevailing religion\\" is largely based on the role the church played for the preservation of the Greek nation through the years of the Ottoman Empire but also for the role the church played in the Greek War of Independence. As a result, many attribute to the modern Greek nation an ethnoreligious identity. Furthermore, the mainstream Orthodox clergy's salaries and pensions are paid for by the State at rates comparable to those of teachers. All Greek students in primary and secondary schools in Greece attend Christian Orthodox instruction, although there is an exemption system for students who do not want to attend, as long as the exemption is requested by both parents. In addition, the Constitution prohibits proselytism from other religions. ===Catholicism=== Catholics made up less than 1% of the total population in 2015. The Catholic community has increased in size in recent years due to immigration and today number over 200,000. ====Roman Catholics==== Cathedral Basilica of St. Dionysius the Areopagite in Athens. Roman Catholic Greeks number approximately 50,000 and are found all over Greece; the majority, however, live in the Cyclades and the Ionian Islands. The presence of Catholics in the Greek islands is mostly a heritage from the time of the Venetian domination from the Middle Ages. The Catholic community has increased in size in recent years due to immigration and today number over 200,000. ====Greek Catholics==== Catholic Greeks of the Byzantine Rite (Uniates or Unites) number approximately 6,000 nationwide and mostly live in Athens. ===Protestantism=== The Anglican Church of Saint Andrew, Patras. Protestants, including Greek Evangelical Church and Free Evangelical Churches, stand at about 30,000. The Free Apostolic Church of the Pentecost was founded by Dr. Leonidas Feggos in 1965. The official church, Eastern Orthodox, and the State reluctantly gave permission for Pentecostal churches to operate legally. The process of receiving permission from the Ministry of Education and Religion to operate as a church is becoming easier. Assemblies of God, the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel and other Pentecostal churches of the Greek Synod of Apostolic Church have 12,000 members.Synod of Apostolic Church of Christ The Independent Free Apostolic Church of Pentecost is the biggest Protestant denomination in Greece with 120 churches.Church addresses from the Official Site - in Greek There are no official statistics about Free Apostolic Church of Pentecost, but the Orthodox Church estimates the followers at 20,000.Orthodox estimate - in greek ===Armenian Church=== Armenian Church of Virgin Mary in Thessaloniki. The presence of Armenians in Greece dates back centuries (from the Byzantine period), when Armenians settled in Thessalia, Macedonia, Thrace and the islands of Crete and Corfu for various reasons such as war or business. The Armenians in Greece acquired the character of a community after the 1920s, when 70,000 to 80,000 survivors of the Armenian Genocide fled to Greece. Today, emigration to North America has diminished the Armenian population of Greece. The number now counts for roughly 20,000-35,000 Greco-Armenians. == Hellenic ethnic religion == Over 2000 people are members of the Supreme Council of Ethnic Hellenes, the foremost organisation of Hellenic ethnic religion.Newstatesman - The ancient gods of Greece are not extinctTelegraph.co.uk - Modern Athenians fight for the right to worship the ancient Greek gods Over 100,000 people are \\"sympathisers\\". On 9 April 2017 the Hellenic ethnic religion was officially recognized by the Greek state.\\"The Greek State Has Finally Recognized the Hellenic Ethnic Religion as a 'Known Religion'\\". European Congress of Ethnic Religions (ECER), 21 April 2017. ==Judaism== Romaniote Jewish synagogue, 300 CE, Aegina. The Jewish community in Greece currently amounts to roughly 7,500 people, concentrated mainly in Athens, Thessaloniki, Larissa, Volos, Chalkis, Ioannina, Trikala and Corfu, while very few remain in Kavala and Rhodes.Short History Of The Jewish Communities In Greece (pdf), publicized by the Central Board of Jewish Communities in Greece It is composed largely of two groups, the Romaniotes, Jewish communities dating back to Antiquity, and the Ladino-speaking Sephardim, who arrived from Spain and settled chiefly in Thessaloniki during Ottoman times. ==Islam== Muslim elders in Xanthi The number of citizens of Greece who are Muslims is estimated to be at 97,604 people or 0.95% of the total population, according to the 1991 census.Œ•œÄŒøœÖœÅŒ≥ŒµŒØŒø ŒïŒæœâœÑŒµœÅŒπŒ∫œéŒΩ, Œ•œÄŒ∑œÅŒµœÉŒØŒ± ŒïŒΩŒ∑ŒºŒ≠œÅœâœÉŒ∑œÇ: ŒúŒøœÖœÉŒøœÖŒªŒºŒ¨ŒΩŒπŒ∫Œ∑ ŒºŒµŒπŒøŒΩœåœÑŒ∑œÑŒ± ŒòœÅŒ¨Œ∫Œ∑œÇ and ŒïŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒÆ ŒïœÄŒπœÑœÅŒøœÄŒÆ Œ≥ŒπŒ± œÑŒ∑ Œ¥ŒπŒ±œáŒµŒØœÅŒ∑œÉŒ∑ œÑœâŒΩ œÖŒ¥Œ±œÑŒπŒ∫œéŒΩ œÄœåœÅœâŒΩ: Œ£œÑŒøŒπœáŒµŒØŒ± Œ±œÄœå œÑŒ∑ŒΩ œÄœÅœåœÉœÜŒ±œÑŒ∑ Œ±œÄŒøŒ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒÆ œÑŒøœÖ œÄŒªŒ∑Œ∏œÖœÉŒºŒøœç They live mostly in Western Thrace and are primarily Turkish, Slavonic (Pomak) and Romani. Immigrant Muslims are estimated between 200,000-300,000. and approximately half of them live in Athens In 2015, Islam was the religion of 2% of the total population of Greece. ==Sikhism== Sikhs have been in Greece since the World Wars, as part of the British Indian Army. Guru Nanak is also known to have passed through Greece during one of his journeys. However, actual immigration to Greece began in the 1970s. It reached its peak during the 1990s-2000s. As of 2017, Sikhs are estimated to number 20,000-25,000. There are eight Gurudwaras in Greece, most of them based in Central Greece and only one being in Crete. Gurudwaras are often officially documented as personal properties, community centres or libraries, due to the paperwork needed and also due to the lack of recognition of Sikhs by the Greek Government. Sikhs often face racism and discrimination by the Greek public, who confuse them with Muslims, as well as legal challenges, mostly due to the distinct appearance (The Five Ks). Sikhs are not allowed to wear their turbans and ride motorcycles without helmets, as in the United Kingdom, where their contributions in the war efforts were recognized and they were allowed to not wear helmets. Young Sikhs often face difficulties when recruited for the mandatory conscription in Greece, due to their long hair, beard and turbans. Sikhism is still not an officially recognized in Greece and Sikhs are often not included in censuses. Media coverage of Sikhs is minimal and their religion is often reported as a mix of Hinduism and Islam, while it has a separate belief system and many differences. Sikh Gurudwaras have faced numerous attacks, including gunshots and molotov cocktails, all of which received no media coverage. On March 1, 2006, the Greek government passed a law allowing cremation,International Religious Freedom Report 2006, Greece a move welcomed by both Sikhs and Hindus. Since the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, many Sikhs have migrated to other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Canada, and Germany ==Buddhism== The number of the followers is not so high amongst the Greeks but it has increased during the last decades because of the immigration of people from East Asia, Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia in Greece. Sri Lankan and Southeast Asian migrant workers working in Greece were usually sent back to their home country to be cremated, due to cremation being banned in Greece until 2006. Today there are three religious centers, in Athens, Thessaloniki and Corinth. ==Hinduism== Hinduism in Greece has a small following. There is a small Hindu community in Athens. There are 25 PIOs and 12 NRIs in the city. On March 1, 2006, the Greek government passed a law allowing cremation. The law was welcomed by the Indian community in Athens. ==Other faiths== Other minor faiths in Greece include Jehovah's Witnesses (who number about 28,000), Seventh-day Adventists, Mormons and Scientologists. Groups that constitute less than 1 percent of the population includes those of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith.H ŒïŒöŒöŒõŒóŒ£ŒôŒë Œ§ŒóŒ£ ŒïŒõŒõŒëŒîŒüŒ£: ŒïœÄŒπœÑœÅŒøœÄŒ≠œÇ œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒôŒµœÅŒ¨œÇ Œ£œÖŒΩœåŒ¥ŒøœÖ - Œ£Œ•ŒùŒüŒîŒôŒöŒó ŒïŒ†ŒôŒ§Œ°ŒüŒ†Œó ŒïŒ†Œô Œ§Œ©Œù ŒëŒôŒ°ŒïŒ£ŒïŒ©Œù ==Gallery== File:Hagios Andreas Seitenansicht.jpg|Saint Andrew Church of Patras File:Catholic church of the Immaculate Conception, Thessaloniki.JPG|Catholic church of Thessaloniki File:La Can√©e (Cr√®te) (5743883813).jpg|Catholic (Capuchin) church of Chania File:Evangelical church in Katerini.jpg|Evangelical church in Katerini File:Monastir Synagogue.JPG|Monastir Synagogue (Thessaloniki) File:Athens Jewish community center.jpg|Beth Shalom Synagogue File:Eyaggeliki.jpg|Evangelical church, Athens File:Attica 06-13 Athens 11 Anglican Church.jpg|Anglican Church of Saint Paul in Athens (arch.

He played his college football at Mississippi State. He was the first pick in the fifth round of the 1966 American Football League draft, by the Houston Oilers. He was an AFL All-Star in 1967 and 1968. ==Early Life== Hoyle John Granger was born on March 7, 1944. He was a two-time all-state halfback for Oberlin High School (1960, 61). The Oberlin High football team finished as Class B state runners-up in 1958 and 1959 and were Class B State Champions in 1961, the school's only football state title to date. He was named the Class B MVP in 1961 after scoring 199 points and average 12.5 yards per carry that season. ==College== Hoyle attended Mississippi State University out of high school and was a three-time letter winner and three-time all-conference halfback during his time in Starkville from 1963-65. Granger finished his career at Mississippi State third all-time on the school's rushing leaders list (now 25th). ==Pro Career== Granger was drafted as the first pick of the fifth-round (37th Overall) of the 1966 AFL Draft by the Houston Oilers. Granger rushed for 388 yards and one touchdown in his rookie season while also accounting for 104 receiving yards and one receiving touchdown. In his second season in 1967 he moved to fullback and had a break-out season, rushing the ball 236 times for 1,194 yards and six touchdowns plus 300 yards and three touchdowns receiving. He was named an AFL All-Star that year and led the league in yards from scrimmage that season with 1,494 and was second in rushing yards. He was named an AFL All-Star again in 1968, 848 yards and seven touchdowns, finishing fourth in the league in rushing yards that year. In 1969, Granger rushed for 740 yards and three touchdowns rushing and 330 yards and one touchdown receiving. Granger accounted for only 287 yards from scrimmage and one touchdown for the Oilers in 1970. He spent the 1971 season with the New Orleans Saints before returning to the Oilers in 1972, which was his final season in professional football.

Since then, it has grown from three games to five and spans three days, usually over Labor Day weekend. Among the notable players that have participated in short history of the Classic are former Texas Longhorns and former Chicago Bears running back Cedric Benson, former Houston Cougars and current Buffalo Bills quarterback Kevin Kolb, former Iowa Hawkeyes quarterback Drew Tate and former Missouri Tigers quarterback Chase Daniel.

The band started out playing instrumental songs in a style similar to The Shadows, with influences from Cliff Richard. The original line- up included Peter Robinson (bass), Graeme ('Garth') Thompson (drums), Laurie Arthur (lead guitar) and Fred Wieland (rhythm guitar). Robinson had previously played with The Thunderbirds, and went on to replace Athol Guy in The Seekers from the late 1970s. ==Founding and history== At the end of 1962 they signed with W&G; Records, headed by Ron Tudor after working as the studio band for artists including The Seekers, Frankie Davidson (born 12 January 1934, Melbourne Australia) Johnny Chester, Merv Benton (born Mervyn Bonson, 12 August 1942) Little Gulliver and the Children, Pat Farrar and Joy Lemmon. Arthur left the band in early 1964, and was replaced on lead guitar by John Farrar. In 1964 they supported Colin Cook and released an LP called Colin Cook and the Strangers. The first charting record in The Strangers' own name was \\"Cry of the Wild Goose\\" (an instrumental by Terry Gilkyson) / \\"Leavin' Town\\", which was released in January 1963 and reached number 12 on the Melbourne charts. This was followed by three original instrumentals, \\"Torlido\\", \\"The Outcast\\" and \\"Undertow\\", which were released in 1963, two of which reached the Top 40. Other singles included \\"Happy Without You\\" (Kenny Laguna, Shelley Pinz, 1968), \\"Melanie Makes Me Smile\\" (Tony Macaulay, Barry Mason, 1970), \\"Looking Through the Eyes of a Beautiful Girl\\" (1970), \\"If You Gotta Make a Fool of Somebody\\" (Rudy Clark, 1965) and a cover of Five Americans, \\"Western Union\\" (Mike Rabon, Norman Ezell, John Durrill, 1967). Also in 1964, the band supported Roy Orbison and Paul and Paula on an Australian tour which featured The Surfaris and The Beach Boys. These support gigs influenced some early vocal recordings in \\"Poppa Oom Mow Mow\\", \\"Sunday Kind of Love,\\" \\"If You Gotta Make a Fool of Somebody\\" and later \\"In My Room\\", a Beach Boys ballad. ==Television band== In August 1964, The Strangers were selected as the resident backing band on the Melbourne based teenage television pop program The Go!! Show, in which they appeared each week from 1964 to 1967. Farrar married Pat Carroll. Carroll and Olivia Newton-John appeared on The Go!! Show as singers. After \\"The Go!! Show\\" ended, The Strangers became the resident group on HSV-7's Sunnyside Up program. In all, the band appeared on television at least once a week for nine years straight. During the mid-1960s, the band changed labels from W&G; Records to Go Records. After the demise of the Go!! Show and its associated record label, they moved to Philips Records, and finally to Fable Records in 1970. ==Replacements and collaborations== In February 1967 Terry Walker (ex Glen Ingram & The Hi-Five) replaced Fred Wieland, who left to join The Mixtures. During 1969, The Strangers' cover of \\"Melanie Makes Me Smile\\" made No. 16 in Sydney, No. 9 in Melbourne and No. 7 in Brisbane. Later singles included \\"Mr. President\\" (Trevor 'Dozy' Davies, John 'Beaky' Dymond, Ian 'Tich' Amey) in 1970, and \\"Sweet Water\\" (Fletcher/Flett), a cover of a song by obscure British band Brass Monkey, in 1971. The group effectively broke up in mid 1970, with Farrar moving to the UK and joining Shadows members Hank Marvin and Bruce Welch in Marvin, Welch & Farrar, and then the re-formed Shadows. Later that year Robinson and Thompson reformed The Strangers (sometimes billed as The New Strangers) with guitarists John Cosgrove (ex Fendermen) and Bill Pyman. Cosgrove left in early 1973 and was replaced by Jim Sifonious (ex Dove), before the band finally broke up in 1975. Throughout the group's 14 years, The Strangers provided backing for many local and overseas acts. These included: Johnny Farnham, Russell Morris, Johnny Young, Neil Sedaka, Johnny O'Keefe, The Seekers, Merv Benton, Ted Mulry, Lynne Randell, Ross D. Wyllie, Yvonne Barrett, Grantley Dee, Pat Carroll, Little Gulliver, Barry Crocker, Buddy England, Ronnie Burns, Town Criers, Masters Apprentices, Axiom, Hans Poulsen and Lionel Rose. The Strangers set an exceptional standard for live sound, using the best and 'cleanest' equipment they could procure: German Dynacord microphones and public address systems, multiple guitar effects units, an exponential horn for the bass guitar, and carefully selected and matching guitars (e.g. Rickenbacker 6 and 12 string, and Maton El Toro) and amplifiers. Farrar later moved to the USA, and has written and produced a number of hits for Olivia Newton-John, including \\"Hopelessly Devoted to You\\", \\"Have You Never Been Mellow\\" and \\"Magic\\". Fred Wieland, who was also a member of The Mixtures, died of lung cancer at the age of 75 on December 10, 2018. ==Discography== ;The Strangers CDs *Best of the Strangers *Bobby & Laurie *Colin Cook & the Strangers ;The Strangers LP/EPs on vinyl *The Strangers *Best of the (Original) Strangers *Let's Go With the Strangers *Colin Cook and the Strangers ;The Strangers cuts on vinyl (with John Farrar) *Poppa Oom Mow Mow *Sunday Kind of Love *If You Gotta Make a Fool of Somebody *Let's Go Let's Go Let's Go *In My Room *Never on a Sunday *Put Yourself in My Place *Fever *Western Union *Cool Jerk *Happy Without You *Take the Time *Lady Scorpio *California Soul *Sweet September *Paper Cup *Melanie Makes Me Smile *If You Think You're Groovy *Walkin' *Fun Fun Fun *Stagecoach *Matchbox *I Call Your Name *Blues by Five *Bend Me Shape Me *Elenore *I Say a Little Prayer *Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow *I Can Hear Music *Paperback Writer *Little Deuce Coupe *Little St. Nick *Standing in the Shadows of Love *I've Got You Under My Skin *Proud Mary *Sandy *Do It Again *Good Vibrations *Windows in Your Eyes ==References== *The Strangers *a 2000 biography of The Strangers by Geoff Jermy with Peter Robinson archived at PopArchives.com.au * (Discography) ==External links== *Happy Without You (1968) video at YouTube.

It is situated at Slemdalsveien 15 near Majorstuen just south of the main campus of the University of Oslo at Blindern. ==Name== Though the name Chateau Neuf literally means 'New Castle' in French. It also involves a pun on the French word 'neuf,' which is pronounced like the Norwegian onomatopoeia for 'oink,' alluding to the Student Society's personified patron and coat of arms symbol, 'His Majesty the Pig' (Hans Majestet Grisen). ==History== Although the Students' Society was housed in permanent facilities at Universitetsgaten 26 from 1861 onwards, the society outgrew this structure by 1918 and moved to different locations around the city. During the German occupation of Norway (1940-1945), the Student Society was dissolved due to oppositional attitudes to the occupying forces, and was re-established after the liberation in 1945. In the 1950s, funds were raised to build a new structure, spearheaded by Jan P. Syse (1930-1997). Based on expansion plans for the University of Oslo, the site was picked, though the university changed its plans after Chateau Neuf's construction had started. Ground was broken by C. J. Hambro in 1963 in commemoration of the 150th anniversary of the founding of the society. The architects were Kjell Lund and Nils Slaatto. Construction was complete in 1971 and officially opened in 1973. == References == Category:University of Oslo Category:Buildings and structures in Oslo Category:Modernist architecture in Norway Category:1963 establishments in Norway ","title":"Chateau Neuf"},{"id":"11651060","text":"The terms local programme, local programming, local content or local television refers to a television program made by a television station or independent television producer for broadcast only within the station's transmission area or television market. Local programmes can encompass the whole range of programme genres but will usually only cover subjects or people of particular interest to an audience within the station‚Äôs coverage area. For example, a local sports programme will present results, interviews and coverage of games or matches, just like a network sports programme, but it would only feature teams and players from within the broadcaster's transmission area. In some cases a television network programme may include a local element as well. This is particularly the case in the United Kingdom and still happens today with The Politics Show. The BBC regions will all opt-out at the same time from the main programme to present a locally produced segment. Sometimes locally made programmes that are not too specific to the transmission area, will be sold to other local stations for broadcast in their region. Historically there was a large percentage of local programming on television. Late in the 20th century this has significantly fallen. In many cases the only local programmes on a television station today will be the local newscast. The above can also apply to radio. A national radio network may have local studios or affiliates who opt-out at various times to present local programs and content. In the late-1950s, many of the early Australian television series such as Melbourne Magazine (1957), Sydney Tonight (1956-1959), and TV Talent Scout (1957-1958) were broadcast in only a single city. ==Canada== In Canada, historically local television stations produced a significant volume of local programming, including newscasts, locally or regionally oriented talk shows, and variety entertainment programs such as Tiny Talent Time or Homegrown Cafe; a few stations, most notably CHCH-TV in Hamilton, Ontario, also distributed some of their local programming more widely through television syndication. With the cross-national consolidation of Canadian media ownership in the 1990s and 2000s, network-affiliated stations now rarely produce much more than their own local or regional newscasts, although some stations may continue to produce a small amount of additional local programming. Independent stations may produce more local programming, although such stations are now rare in the Canadian media landscape. In radio, virtually all Canadian commercial radio stations are officially programmed locally, although many stations cut costs by contracting some dayparts out to voice-tracked hosts who are not actually located in the station's physical studio or even necessarily in the same city. The CBC Radio One, CBC Radio 2, Ici Radio-Canada Premi√®re and Ici Musique networks consist primarily of networked national programming, although all include some degree of local programming in certain time blocks. Radio One and Premi√®re stations have a significant number of production centres which create and air their own local morning and/or afternoon talk shows, while Radio 2's and Ici Musique's local content is limited to local news and weather updates. See also CBC Radio One local programming. == United States== The term is also generally accepted to refer to television programming that is not produced by a broadcast or other media source for national or international distribution (broadcast syndication). Usually programming of local interest is produced by either a Public, educational, and government access (PEG) television organization, cable TV operator or broadcast network affiliate stations that offer local radio news and television news. ===Placeholder use of term=== Additionally, the term is used in a more generic form in the United States, Canada, Mexico and other countries in the Western Hemisphere as a placeholder term within published national program guide listings in publications such as the post-2006 format TV Guide or USA Today which only carry the default schedules of national networks, where the \\"local programming\\" designation replaces detailed listings for a local station that would be impossible to print in a national publication. Outside of local newscasts and some rare non-news programming however, the term merely describes time periods under a local station's control, where syndicated content airs rather than true local programming. For equivalent electronic program guide listings for set-top boxes, the term is used mainly with PEG stations and networks which do not have a schedule compiled by a cable operator as a default placeholder; other instances are with only broadcast stations who outright refuse or do not release their program listings due to lack of staff, though as advertisers usually demand a minimum schedule to place their ads on a television station (and most of these stations are associated with smaller national digital subchannel networks which do provide a default schedule for distribution), the vast majority of broadcast stations do provide program listings. Wikipedia itself also uses this designation in its series of American network television schedule articles for non-network programming time. ==United Kingdom== Many local television stations in the United Kingdom ceased broadcasting due to a lack of viability, but some stations are still being broadcast, including: *Midlands Asian Television (MATV) *NVTV (Northern Visions Television), Belfast *That's TV ==See also== * Regional Variations * Network affiliate * Local Children's Television (US) * Regional television in Australia *Local television in Greece * Local origination (disambiguation) ==References== Category:Television in Canada Category:Television in Australia Category:Television terminology Category:Radio broadcasting ","title":"Local programming"},{"id":"11651087","text":"203x203px John Trevor Hayes (21 January 1929 ‚Äì 25 December 2005) was a British art historian and museum director. He was an authority on the paintings of Thomas Gainsborough. ==Early life== Hayes was educated at Ardingly Collegehttps://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/jan/13/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries and read modern history at Keble College, Oxfordhttp://arthistorians.info/hayesj after which he undertook a postgraduate diploma at the Courtauld Institute of Art. ==Career== In 1954 he became assistant keeper of the London Museum in Kensington Palace, the forerunner to the modern Museum of London. He developed an interest in Gainsborough after realising that British artists had hitherto been neglected by art-historical scholarship. Taking advantage of a Commonwealth Fund fellowship, he travelled to the United States and spent a year as a Research Scholar at the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University from 1958 to 1959. After his return he curated a Gainsborough exhibition for the Arts Council and in 1962 he received his PhD for research into Gainsborough's landscape paintings. He was Visiting Professor of Fine Arts at Yale University from 1960 to 1970. From 1970 to 1974, Hayes was director of the London Museum, overseeing its move to new premises on London Wall. In 1974https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/john-hayes-6110879.html he was subsequently appointed director of the National Portrait Gallery, succeeding Sir Roy Strong in the post. The duties that came with the NPG directorship did not curtail Hayes's scholarly activities, however, and during his tenure he managed to curate a major Gainsborough exhibition at the Tate and the Grand Palais, Paris), and numerous smaller ones, including one of Graham Sutherland's work. Under his aegis the NPG's annual portrait award (now the BP Portrait Award) was established in 1980, and two regional outposts for the gallery opened at Beningbrough Hall in Yorkshire and Bodelwyddan Castle in Denbighshire. Plans to move the institution to larger premises in London were never realised, although a new block for staff was built across the road from the Gallery's Victorian building. ==Later years== After his retirement in 1994 Hayes continued in his scholarly work, curating a further Gainsborough exhibition in Ferrara and serving as vice-president of the Walpole Society. == Archive == The John Hayes Archive is held at the Paul Mellon Centre and available for public consultation. It includes research notes surrounding Hayes' publications and proposed publications on Thomas Gainsborough, Joshua Reynolds, Thomas Rowlandson, and Graham Sutherland. The material on Sutherland includes letters written between Hayes and the artist. The archive consist largely of correspondence, notes, photographs, journal offprints and drafts of publications. ==Selected publications== *Thomas Gainsborough.

He was also a noted soccer player and was included in the Ireland squad for the 1924 Olympic Football Tournament. ==Club career== While living in Belfast, Crawford played rugby union for Malone and soccer for Cliftonville. After moving to Dublin, he maintained his interest in both codes. He was club captain at Lansdowne for the 1921‚Äì22 and 1922-23 seasons, taking over from Noel Purcell. At the same time he also played soccer for Bohemians and became something of a cult hero at the club when, after a Metropolitan Cup game against Shamrock Rovers, he removed his jersey and challenged Bob Fullam to a fight! This episode is still recalled by Bohemians fans in the chant: > \\"Ernie Crawford, he's our friend, > He's our friend, he's our friend > Ernie Crawford, he's our friend > He hates Rovers\\" Due to his rugby union commitments and the presence of fellow full backs, Jack McCarthy and Bertie Kerr, Crawford was never a first choice in the Bohemians senior team, but he did play regularly for their second team in the Leinster Senior League. During the 1926‚Äì27 and 1927‚Äì28 seasons Crawford would also assist Athlone Town on a number of occasions, especially when they visited Dublin. == International career== ===Rugby union=== Between 1920 and 1927 Crawford made 30 appearances for Ireland. He made his debut on 14 February 1920 against England at Lansdowne Road. The majority of his appearances were in the Five Nations Championship but in 1924 he also played against a touring New Zealand. During his international rugby career he scored six conversions and two penalties. He also captained Ireland on fifteen occasions between 1924 and 1927. One of the highlights of his career came on 13 February 1926 when he captained Ireland to a 19-15 win over England - their first win over England for fifteen years. He played his final game for Ireland against Wales on 12 March 1927. His Ireland teammates included William Roche and Noel Purcell. ===Soccer=== In 1924, after playing in a trial game, Crawford was one of six Bohemians players selected in a squad to represent Ireland at the 1924 Olympic Football Tournament. The other five were Jack McCarthy, Bertie Kerr, Johnny Murray, Christy Robinson and John Thomas. However, when the final squad was reduced to sixteen, Crawford found himself dropped. He accompanied the team to the tournament as a spectator but did not participate as a player. ==Later years== Crawford later served as a selector for the Ireland team that won the Grand Slam in 1948, and was president of the Irish Rugby Football Union for the 1957-58 season. He also served as president of Skerries Rugby Club. ==References== ==External links== * Newulsterbiography.co.uk Category:Association footballers from Northern Ireland Category:Irish rugby union players Category:Ireland international rugby union players Category:Footballers at the 1924 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic footballers of Ireland Category:Lansdowne Football Club players Category:League of Ireland players Category:Bohemian F.C. players Category:Cliftonville F.C. players Category:Athlone Town A.F.C. players Category:Malone RFC players Category:1891 births Category:1959 deaths Category:Barbarian F.C. players Category:Leinster Senior League (association football) players Category:Association footballers not categorized by position ","title":"Ernie Crawford"},{"id":"11651110","text":"Holy Cross Catholic Academy is a private, Roman Catholic high school in Amarillo, Texas. It is the only Catholic high school in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Amarillo. ==History== Catholic secondary education in Amarillo can be traced back to 1913 when St. Mary's Academy was moved to Amarillo, TX. St. Mary's Academy was coeducational for grades 1‚Äì6; however, the high school was only for young ladies. It was not until 1928 that an all-boys school was created. St. George's College began in the basement of Amarillo's Sacred Heart Cathedral. In 1929 the school was renamed Price Memorial College, in honor of Katherine E.

It is owned by the city and county of It is now a part of the PGA Tour's Tournament Players Club (TPC) network of courses, following an agreement between the tour and the city that was announced on November 3, 2010. It is located in the southwest area of San Francisco, on the west side of San Francisco State University, and surrounded by Lake Merced on its other three sides. The entrance is at Harding Road, which connects to Skyline Boulevard on the east. ==History== Harding Park Golf Course opened on July 18, 1925. It is named after President Warren G. Harding, an avid golfer, who had died in office while visiting San Francisco two years earlier. The course covers along the shores of Lake Merced, in the city's southwest corner. Willie Watson and Sam Whiting, who also designed the nearby Olympic Club's Lake Course, drew up a design plan for a course at Harding Park for a price of $300. The golf course attracted national attention, hosting a number of important tournaments, including The U.S. Amateur Public Links Championship in 1937 and again in 1956. In the 1960s, Harding Park became a regular stop for the PGA Tour at the Lucky International Open. The PGA Tour left Harding Park after the San Francisco Open Invitational in 1969, due to deteriorating conditions and antiquated facilities. Course conditions worsened during the 1970s and 1980s, as the city budget cuts wreaked havoc on course maintenance. The low point came in 1998, when Harding was used as a parking lot during the U.S. Open at the nearby Lake Course of the Olympic Club. Around the turn of the century, Sandy Tatum, a prominent San Francisco attorney, champion golfer, and former United States Golf Association president, led a campaign to restore Harding Park to its former glory. He eventually got approval from former mayor Willie Brown to allow Arnold Palmer Golf Management, a Florida-based company, to renovate and operate the park. In 2001, however, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, namely former District 7 Supervisor Tony Hall, opposed the project based on fear that Arnold Palmer's involvement in the project represented privatization of a municipally-owned golf course. As opposition grew, Arnold Palmer backed out, primarily over concern about revenue estimates. Palmer Golf and the city could not agree on a greens fee schedule. The city's proposed management contract, at the urging of the Harding Park Men's Club, specified a percentage of tee times that would be held for city residents at a greatly reduced rate, albeit an increase over the previous rate. When all hopes to renovate Harding Park seemed unrealistic and far fetched, Sean Elsbernd, Tony Hall's Chief of Staff helped to revive the project. He was the one who later succeeded Hall. He and Tatum convinced Hall that the renovation could be a significant revenue producer for the city, by attracting the PGA Tour back to town. They thought it would provide the adequate stimulus for the city to move forward. They also addressed funding concerns by tapping grant money from Proposition 12, a measure passed in 2000 to fund parks across California. But advocacy groups such as the Neighborhood Parks Council continued to oppose the project, claiming that renovating the golf course was not a priority for the city, and that those state grants should be used to help improve other recreation facilities across town. Despite opposition, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors unanimously passed the resolution to use Prop. 12 money in 2001, citing potential revenue for the city, should Harding become a regular host of professional golf events. Harding Park Golf Course, winter 2006Renovation finally began in the spring of 2002. The 15-month-long project expanded the course from to nearly in length, and upgraded the driving range and clubhouse to PGA Tour standards. The course property remained under the ownership of the city and county of San Francisco. The city's parks and recreation department is responsible for course maintenance, which remains an ongoing concern, for everyday players as well as for PGA Tour officials looking to conduct future events at the course. Before the 2010 deal with the PGA Tour that made Harding Park a member of the TPC network, Kemper Sports operated the course, including the pro shop and tee- time reservations. Following the deal, which lasted through the spring of 2010, the course is now operated by the tour's Golf Course Properties arm for no management fee. Facilities have become world class and include a modern clubhouse and restaurant capable of hosting special events, and a full-sized practice range. The renovation budget also covered the park's picturesque and challenging nine-hole layout, The Fleming 9, named for John Fleming, the long- time San Francisco Parks' superintendent. The fee schedule includes a substantial discount for San Francisco city residents, and a smaller discount for residents of Bay Area counties. On August 22, 2003, the Harding Park Golf Course was officially reopened. Since the renovation's completion, Harding Park has hosted several men's professional golf tournaments. ==Tournaments hosted== Having hosted the PGA Tour's Lucky International Open from 1961 to 1969, Harding Park did not see elite tournament golf again until 2005 when it hosted the WGC-American Express Championship. Following that event, an agreement between the city and the PGA Tour was reached whereby several more PGA Tour events were scheduled to be played at Harding Park; The course hosted the 2009 Presidents Cup, the 2015 WGC-Cadillac Match Play, the 2020 PGA Championship, and is scheduled to host the 2026 President's Cup. Harding Park has also hosted the Champions Tour's season-ending Charles Schwab Cup Championship in 2010, 2011, and 2013. == Scorecard == ==References== ==External links== * Category:Golf clubs and courses in California Category:Parks in San Francisco Category:Sports venues in San Francisco Category:1925 establishments in California Category:Presidents Cup venues Category:Sports venues completed in 1925 ","title":"TPC Harding Park"},{"id":"11651198","text":"Wolfenstein is a series of World War II video games. It was originally created by Muse Software, before being revived by id Software. The first two games in the series, Castle Wolfenstein and Beyond Castle Wolfenstein, were developed by Muse Software and focused on stealth-based gameplay from a top-down perspective. Beginning with id Software's Wolfenstein 3D, Wolfenstein games became fast-paced first-person shooters, and are widely regarded to have helped popularize the first-person shooter genre. Further games in the series include Return to Castle Wolfenstein, developed by Gray Matter Interactive, Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory by Splash Damage, and 2009's Wolfenstein by Raven Software. After ZeniMax Media acquired id Software, including the Wolfenstein franchise, Swedish developer MachineGames became the series' primary developer. Wolfenstein games developed by MachineGames include Wolfenstein: The New Order, Wolfenstein: The Old Blood, Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus, Wolfenstein: Youngblood, and Wolfenstein: Cyberpilot. The majority of the games follow William \\"B.J.\\" Blazkowicz, a Jewish Polish-American Army Captain and his fights against the Axis powers. Earlier titles are centered around Nazis attempting to harness supernatural and occult forces. Those developed by MachineGames are set in an alternate history in which Axis powers won World War II. ==History== alt=The first-person view of the player character, atop a destroyed bridge, shooting a Nazi with his machine gun. The Wolfenstein series of video games started with the 1981 stealth-adventure video game Castle Wolfenstein. It was developed by American programmer Silas Warner, a pioneer in the early eras of video gaming, especially the stealth genre. It was published by his then company M.U.S.E. Inc. (Muse Software). Set during World War II, the game focuses on an unnamed American prisoner of war who has been imprisoned in the German stronghold of Castle Wolfenstein. The objective is to retrieve the war plans for Operation Rheingold and escape the fortress, while avoiding or killing guards along the way. The game is often credited as one of the first video games of the stealth genre, since it focuses more on avoiding or disarming enemies, and killing them is considered a last resort.https://www.gamesradar.com/the-sneaky-history-of-stealth-games/ Ten more titles, Beyond Castle Wolfenstein, Wolfenstein 3D, Wolfenstein 3D: The Spear of Destiny, Return to Castle Wolfenstein, Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, Wolfenstein RPG, Wolfenstein, Wolfenstein: The New Order, Wolfenstein: The Old Blood and Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus have been published as games of the Wolfenstein series since the release of Castle Wolfenstein in 1981 by M.U.S.E. Inc. ==Games== ===Castle Wolfenstein (1981)=== Silas Warner, an American programmer and an employee of software company Muse Software, was a pioneer of early video game development, especially the stealth genre.https://games.greggman.com/game/silas_warner/ He had access to computers in college, and when he worked for the IBM Mainframe architectures before joining Muse Software. The computer he used for game-development, P.L.A.T.O., was one of the first with multiple functioning terminals and an example of early computer networks. Warner developed, with P.L.A.T.O., a series of classic video games like his flight simulator and arcade shooter. Inspired by the arcade shooter video game Berzerk and the 1961 war film Guns of Navarone, he developed Castle Wolfenstein, a stealth-adventure video game in which the player controls an unnamed American prisoner of war as he steals German files containing secret war plans, while avoiding, disarming or at times killing hostile guards and trying to escape the fortified Nazi stronghold 'Castle Wolfenstein', set in World War II. The game was published in 1981 by Warner's company M.U.S.E. Inc. (Muse Software).https://www.retrogames.cz/play_580-DOS.php?language=EN ===Beyond Castle Wolfenstein (1984)=== A sequel to Castle Wolfenstein, set in World War II during Adolf Hitler's rule as Chancellor of Germany. The objective of the game is to traverse all the levels of the secret Berlin bunker where the F√ºhrer is holding secret meetings with his senior staff. The player must retrieve a bomb that the operatives have placed inside the bunker and place it outside the door of the room where Hitler is holding his meeting, a scenario bearing a passing resemblance to the July 20 Plot. Like its predecessor, the game is a combination of action-adventure and stealth-based side-scroller, developed and published by Muse Software, and released in 1984. After the death of the original designer of the program, the widow of Silas Warner released a ported version of the game, as well as its reconstructed source code in his honour in 2004. ===Wolfenstein 3D (1992)=== After the Nazis apprehend an American spy, William \\"B.J.\\" Blazkowicz, who was sent to sabotage the enemy's regime and foil their schemes, they imprison him under the grounds of Castle Wolfenstein. Finding a way to incapacitate a prison guard, B.J. manages to arm himself with a stolen pistol and advance through the subterranean floors of the castle, on his way to accomplish his mission by uncovering the truth behind 'Operation Eisenfaust' and destroy it. The game is noted for popularizing the first-person shooter genre, released in 1992, developed by id Software and published by Apogee Software. ===Spear of Destiny (1992)=== Set before the events of Wolfenstein 3D, the player assumes the role of William \\"B.J.\\" Blazkowicz, who is set to reclaim the Spear of Destiny from the Nazis after it was stolen from Versailles. The spear itself, as spoken by legends, bears powerful effects on its own, and whoever took a hold of it, turns into an unbeatable being. Like its predecessor, the game is developed by id Software, but published by FormGen Corporation instead, and was released in 1992. ===Return to Castle Wolfenstein (2001)=== Two operatives of an allied espionage agency, William \\"B.J.\\" Blazkowicz and Agent One are captured by the Nazis and imprisoned in Castle Wolfenstein during their attempt to investigate rumours surrounding one of Heinrich Himmler's personal projects, the SS Paranormal Division. Agent One is killed during the interrogation, while Blazkowicz escapes custody, fighting his way out of the castle. As the challenge is still afoot, Blazkowicz discovers that the Nazis are constructing a plan called 'Operation Resurrection', which oversees resurrecting the dead as well as dealing with supernatural elements, using them for their own advantage to win World War II against the Allied power. A reboot and a remake of the series that took off in 1992, developed by Gray Matter Interactive and published by Activision, and released in 2001 on Microsoft Windows, as well as arriving on consoles two years later. ===Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory (2003)=== Originally planned to be released as an expansion pack to Return to Castle Wolfenstein, the game was instead released as a standalone, free to play multiplayer title. It has no storyline or single-player campaign mode. Instead, it has an expanded edition of the previous game's multiplayer. It was developed by Splash Damage and published by Activision. A commercial follow- up, called Enemy Territory: Quake Wars was released in 2007 by the same group. ===Wolfenstein RPG (2008)=== In a mission to investigate the Paranormal Division of the Axis military, William \\"B.J.\\" Blazkowicz is captured and held prisoner in The Tower. He escapes the clutches of the enemy forces, and sets himself to stop them and their operation that involves supernatural activities once and for all, infiltrating Castle Wolfenstein to continue his escapade deep inside. It is up to B.J. to defeat the evil and save the world. It was developed by Fountainhead Entertainment, and published by EA Mobile in 2008, with John Carmack, one of the key people of Wolfenstein 3D, reprising his role as the sole programmer. ===Wolfenstein (2009)=== A loose sequel to Return to Castle Wolfenstein and the start of a new era for the franchise. An agent for the fictional Office of Secret Actions, William \\"B.J.\\" Blazkowicz, discovers an unnatural medallion containing supernatural powers while on a mission on a German battleship. Learning the Nazis had begun digging deep into crystal mines to obtain more of the very same medallion Blazkowicz found, the OSA sends their operative to the fictional town of Isenstadt, which the Nazis had taken complete control of in order to excavate rare Nachtsonne crystals necessary to access the \\"Black Sun\\" dimension. It was developed by Raven Software, produced by id Software and published by Activision, and released in 2009 on three major platforms. ===Wolfenstein: The New Order (2014)=== The New Order is set after the end of World War II, in an alternate universe where the Axis powers won World War II. In 1946, as the Nazis expand their regime all over the world, OSA agent William \\"B.J.\\" Blazkowicz is sent to assassinate General Deathshead, as part of a last all-out effort by Allied airborne and commando forces. The mission is a failure and, after the unit is slaughtered by the Nazi forces, Blazkowicz barely escapes the compound, sustaining a critical head injury which renders him unconscious and subsequently puts him in a coma. In 1960, fourteen years later, B.J. finds himself settled in an asylum, unaware of the events that took place during his coma, and about to be executed by the Nazis who have ordered the asylum liquidated. Awakened into full strength, Blazkowicz fights his way out of the building, escaping with a wounded nurse, Anya. B.J. locates the Resistance and helps them fight the Nazis, dismantling them and ultimately crippling their dominance around the world. After Activision handed over the publishing rights to Bethesda Softworks, development on the game began in 2010 by MachineGames, and was released four years later on multiple platforms, including next generation consoles. ===Wolfenstein: The Old Blood (2015)=== A prequel to The New Order, set in the same chronology, it deals with William \\"B.J.\\" Blazkowicz and Richard Wesley, also known as Agent One, who are sent to infiltrate Castle Wolfenstein and obtain a top secret folder that contains the whereabouts of General Deathshead. The mission goes awry as they are discovered by the Nazi troopers and are captured. During brutal interrogation, Agent One is killed, but Blazkowicz manages to evade the Nazi forces and escape the castle. With the aid of Kessler, the leader of a local resistance group, he discovers that the folder is held by Helga von Schabbs, a Nazi neurologist who has just arrived in the village of Wulfburg. Evidence begins to emerge of supernatural activities taking place under the command of von Schabbs, who is conducting an archaeological excavation in an attempt to find a hidden underground vault containing occult knowledge previously possessed by German King Otto I. The game is a loose remake of Return to Castle Wolfenstein, with heavy resemblances noticed within the storylines of the two games, as well as the existence of various characters as homages to the ones from the older title. Developed by MachineGames and published by Bethesda Softworks, the game serves as a stand-alone expansion pack to Wolfenstein: The New Order, and was released in 2015. ===Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus (2017)=== Set five months after the events of The New Order, \\"B.J.\\" Blazkowicz awakens from the coma he succumbed to in the aftermath of surviving a near-fatal explosion, residing on a stolen Nazi U-boat commandeered by the Wiesenau Kreis. After an attack ensues on the base orchestrated by Frau Engel, many of the resistance members are captured, and the leader of the group is killed. Escaping the clutches of Nazi forces with the rest of the team, Blazkowicz takes over the leadership of the Resistance and proceeds to what would have been the next step in the plan to liberate America from the Nazis and use the country as a center base to free the rest of the world from their behemoth and monstrous regime. Recruiting new members to the resistance along the way, Blazkowicz and the group intend to assassinate prominent leaders in the Nazi regime to bring the public conscious into the idea of liberty and freedom, thus urging everyone to rise against the hefty powers who are running the government. But, before they ignite the operation, the resistance must attack and take over Engel's airship, the Ausmerzer, to disable its use against their own by the Nazis, and hijack its command systems in order to start a revolution, thus reclaiming the land of freedom that was once theirs. Like its two predecessors, The New Colossus is developed by MachineGames and published by Bethesda Softworks, as well as released on multiple platforms in 2017. === Wolfenstein: Youngblood (2019) === Two decades after liberating the United States from the Nazis occupation in the Second American Revolution in 1961, the newest members of the Global Resistance, twin sisters Jessica and Sophia Blazkowicz embark on a search mission to France in the capital city of Paris when B.J., their father, goes missing in action. As they task themselves to locate and reclaim B.J., they must also fight the Nazi regime in Europe that still remains withstanding. Developed by MachineGames in collaboration with Arkane Studios and was published by Bethesda Softworks and released on July 26, 2019, the players control B.J. Blazkowicz's and Anya Oliwa's twin daughters this time around. The game can be played in single-player and multiplayer modes for the story campaign. Additionally, players who purchase the Deluxe edition of the game are able to invite friends to their sessions, regardless of whether the invitee owns the game.https://www.windowscentral.com/wolfenstein-youngblood-goes-preorder- buddy-pass-lets-friends-play-free === Wolfenstein: Cyberpilot (2019) === Set twenty years after the events of The New Colossus, the protagonist is depicted as a computer hacker nicknamed Cyberpilot who works for the French Resistance against the Nazi regime. It takes place chronologically a week prior to the events of Youngblood, serving as a separate side story to the main narrative. Unlike its predecessors, however, the game is specifically designed to be a virtual reality experience. Cyberpilot was released alongside Youngblood on the same day in 2019. Wolfenstein: Cyberpilot and Wolfenstein: Youngblood were the first games to make use of the \\"social adequacy clause\\" introduced by Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle (USK; the German software ratings board) in August 2018, which allowed the use of Nazi imagery in video games in relevant scenarios, reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Despite being officially rated by USK, major German retailers, such as MediaMarkt, Saturn, and GameStop, refused to sell the uncensored version, offering only the separately sold German version, which lacks all Nazi imagery and references and features German as the only language option. ==Related games== * Commander Keen series (1990-2001) ‚Äì William Joseph \\"Billy Blaze\\" Blazkowicz II (Commander Keen) is the grandson of William \\"B.J.\\" Blazkowicz. * Doom (1993) - Doomguy is the great-grandson of B.J.

A local auto road 2414 runs through the village. The village name, Subotiv, according to one legend, took its roots from a live fire from oak firewood (known as \\"subotka\\") that was in front of Perun. According to another legend, it came from the name of the place where water from two tributaries combines (known as \\"subod'\\"). Subotiv is the birthplace of the Ukrainian Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky. ==History== Based on archeological studies, the place was settled as early as Bronze Age. At the place there are also traces of Early Slavic, and Kiev Rus settlements.

According to an honorific inscription dedicated to her in Athens in the late 1st century BC, her royal title was Queen Pythodorida Philometor (). Philometor means \\"mother-loving\\" and this title is associated with the Greek Pharaohs and Queens of the Ptolemaic dynasty of Ancient Egypt. Pythodorida was born and raised in Smyrna (modern ƒ∞zmir, Turkey). She was the daughter and only child of wealthy Anatolian Greeks and friend to the late triumvir Pompey, Pythodoros of Tralles and Antonia. Her maternal grandparents were the Roman triumvir Mark Antony and Antonia Hybrida Minor. ==Queen== The successive marriages of Pythodorida illustrate how elite women, like Rome's client states, were shuffled around in the game of power politics. About 14 BC, Pythodorida married King Polemon Pythodoros of Pontus as his second wife. By this marriage she became Queen of Pontus and the Bosporan Kingdom. Pythodorida and Polemon had two sons and one daughter, who were: * Zenon, also known as Zeno-Artaxias or Artaxias III, who became King of Armenia in 18 AD and reigned until his death in 35 AD * Marcus Antonius Polemon Pythodoros, also known as Polemon II of Pontus * Antonia Tryphaena who married King of Thrace, Cotys VIII Polemon I died in 8 BC, and Pythodorida continued as Queen of Pontus until her death. Pythodorida was able to retain Colchis and Cilicia but not the Bosporan Kingdom which was granted to her first husband's stepson, Aspurgus. She then married King Archelaus of Cappadocia. Archelaus and Pythodorida had no children. Through her second marriage, she became Queen of Cappadocia. Pythodorida had moved with her children from Pontus to Cappadocia to live with Archelaus. When Archelaus died in 17, Cappadocia became a Roman province and she returned with her family back to Pontus. In later years, Polemon II assisted his mother in the administration of the kingdom. Following her death, Polemon II succeeded to the throne. Pythodorida was remembered by a friend and contemporary, the Greek geographer Strabo, who is said to have described Pythodorida as a woman of virtuous character. Strabo considered her to have a great capacity for business and that under Pythodorida's rule Pontus had flourished. ==Ancestry== ==See also== * Bosporan Kingdom * List of Kings of Pontus * Roman Crimea ==References== *Mercudy G., Two Studies on Women in Antiquity: Vassal Queens and Some Contemporary Women in the Roman Empire - Portraits of Royal Ladies on Greek Coins, Johns Hopkins Press, 1937; ASIN: B000WUFYY0 *Worldwide guide to women in leadership ==External links== * An Athenian Honorific Inscription dedicated to Queen Pythodorida, which is displayed at the Epigraphical Museum (inventory no.

W. Orr (31 July 1893 ‚Äì 24 February 1976), was an English composer. ==Biography== Born in Cheltenham, shortly after the death from tuberculosis of his father (who was a captain in the Indian Army), he learnt the piano and studied music theory as a child. He was attracted to the singing of Elena Gerhardt, whom he heard sing in London and developed an interest in lieder, especially those of Johannes Brahms, Franz Schubert, Robert Schumann. After reading Ernest Newman's book on the composer Hugo Wolf he determined to become a songwriter, which occupation he pursued through study at the Guildhall School of Music with Orlando Morgan. He was attracted to the music of Frederick Delius after approaching him at a London restaurant in 1915 and Delius became his mentor, helping him with his early compositions. He also came to know Philip Heseltine (Peter Warlock), who helped him in publishing his early songs. Plaque commemorating the home of Charles Wilfred Orr on St. Mary's Street, Painswick He married in 1929 and moved to Painswick, Gloucestershire, to get away from the busy atmosphere of London, which was detrimental to his health; a vaccination as a child had left him with eczema, and he contracted tuberculosis as an adult. He would remain in Painswick for the rest of his life. His work as a composer was dominated by the composition of songs accompanied by piano; his life's study was the expressive setting of poetry to music. He was a particular admirer of A. E. Housman, and wrote more settings of his poetry than any other composer. He became acquainted with Housman's poetry just after World War I, during which he had enlisted, but was unable to fight for medical reasons. He undertook research visits to Shropshire, taking photographs, and attended one of Housman's lectures as Kennedy Professor of Latin at Cambridge University. He asked for permission to translate A Shropshire Lad into German so he could bring his songs into wider circulation, but the request was refused. His piano accompaniments and postludes are an integral part of each song, providing more than bare harmony; examples of its use for programme music include fluttering semiquavers depicting aspen leaves in Along the Field and heavy chords in a march to the scaffold in The Carpenter's Son. His harmonic language is a mixture of English modality and late Romanticism. Orr is regarded as one of Britain's finest 20th century songwriters. ==Works== His music is published by Chester Novello and Oxford University Press. ===Songs=== For solo voice and piano. *Plucking the Rushes (1921) *Silent Noon (1921) *The Earl of Bristol's Farewell (1927) *Tryste Noel (1927) *When as I Wake (1928) *Hymn before Sleep (1953) *While Summer on is Stealing (1953) *4 Songs (1959): Bahnhofstrasse (1932), Requiem (1954), The Time of Roses (1955), Since Thou, O Fondest and Truest (1957) ====Housman settings==== *When the Lad for Longing Sighs (1921) *2 Songs from A Shropshire Lad: 'Tis Time I Think by Wenlock Town, Loveliest of Trees, The Cherry (1921‚Äì1922) *The Carpenter's Son (1922) *When I was One- and-Twenty (1924) *With rue my heart is laden (1924) *Is my team ploughing (1925) *On your Midnight Pallet Lying (1925) *O When I Was in Love with You (1926) *This Time of Year (1926) *Soldier from the Wars Returning (1928) *7 Songs from A Shropshire Lad (1934): Along the Field (1927), When I Watch the Living Meet (1930), The Lent Lily, Farewell to barn and stack and tree (1928), O fair enough are sky and plain (1931), Hughley Steeple (1930), When Smoke Stood Up from Ludlow (1929) *The Lads in their Hundreds (1936) *3 Songs from A Shropshire Lad (1940): Into My Heart an Air that Kills (1935), Westward on the High-Hilled Plains (1927), O see how thick the goldcup flowers, (1939) *The Isle of Portland (1938) *In Valleys Green and Still (1952) ===Choral music=== *The Brewer's Man, bass and two-part choir (1927) *Slumber Song, choir and piano (1937) *Fain would I change that note, three-part choir and piano (1937) ===Instrumental music=== *Cotswold Hill-Tune, string orchestra, (1937) *Midsummer Dance, cello and piano (1957) ==Recordings== ===Songs (complete)=== *The complete CW Orr songbook ‚Äì volume 1; Stone Records *The complete CW Orr songbook ‚Äì volume 2; Stone Records ===Songs (extracts)=== *A E Housman: A Shropshire Lad, Complete in verse and song; Hyperion Records CDA66471/2 ==Further reading== *J.

He was the eldest son of Kaykhusraw I. ==Succession== Upon the death of Kaykhusraw I at the Battle of Ala≈üehir in 1211, Kaykaus‚Äô two younger brothers, Kayferidun Ibrahim and the future Kayqubad I, challenged his succession. Kayqubad initially garnered some support among the neighbors of the sultanate, Leo I, the king of Cilician Armenia, and Tughrilshah, his uncle and the independent ruler of Erzurum. At the same time, Kayferidun imperiled the recently acquired port of Antalya by seeking aid from the Cypriot Franks. Most of the emirs, as the powerful landed aristocracy of the sultanate, supported Kaykaus. From his base in Malatya, Kaykaus seized Kayseri and then Konya, inducing Leo to change sides. Kayqubad was forced to flee to the fortress at Ankara, where he sought aid from the Turkman tribes of Kastamonu. Kaykaus soon apprehended both of his brothers and secured the throne for himself. During this time of considerable danger, Kaykaus negotiated a peace settlement with Theodore Laskaris, the Byzantine Emperor of Nicaea. This treaty marked the end of hostilities between the Seljuq state and the Empire of Nicaea, though Turkmen nomads continued occasionally to trouble the border. ==The Eastern Frontier and Fifth Crusade== With Antalya secure and the western marches at peace, Kaykaus turned his attentions to the east. During the Fifth Crusade, the crusaders allied with Kaykaus and forced the Ayyubids to undertake a two-front conflict. ==Conquest of Sinop== Bilingual inscription (Persian and Greek) of Kaykaus I at Sinop. Kaykaus‚Äô most significant contribution to the Seljuq state was the acquisition the Black Sea port of Sinop. In 1214 Turkmen tribesmen captured Alexios, Grand Komnenos of the Empire of Trebizond, on a hunting trip outside of the city. The hostage was turned over to the sultan and negotiated his freedom in exchange for Sinop and the vassalage of Trapezuntine territory to the east. The Seljuqs gained an outlet on the Black Sea to match their Mediterranean port at Antalya, and a wedge was driven between the Empire of Trebizond and the Byzantine Empire of Nicaea. The transfer was affected on Sunday 1 November with both the sultan and the Grand Komnenos present. Alexios was entertained for several days and then politely asked to return to Trebizond. After the transfer, European and Byzantine trade continued in the city. Kaykaus named an Armenian, Rais Hetoum, to govern the mixed Greek and Turkish population. Churches in the city of Sinop were converted to mosques, on Kaykaus's command. Between April and September 1215 the walls were reconstructed under the supervision of the Greek architect, Sebastos. Fifteen Seljuq emirs contributed to the cost. The work is commemorated by a bilingual Greek and Arabic inscription on a tower near the western gate. In 1216, Kaykaus attacked Aleppo in support of his vassal Al-Afdal, an exiled Ayyubid. He was defeated by Al- Ashraf. Kaykaus was working to create an alliance with Badr al-Din Lu'lu', Emir of Mosul, against the Ayyubids, but he died in 1220 and the alliance collapsed. ==Identity== According to Rustam Shukurov, it is very probably that Kaykaus I and his brother Kayqubad I, who both spent considerable time in Constantinople with their father, had the same dual confessional (Christian and Muslim) and dual ethnic (Turkic/Persian and Greek) identity as Kaykhusraw I, Kaykaus II, and Masud II. ==Monuments== In 1212 Kaykaus built a madrasa in Ankara and in 1217 the ≈ûifaiye Medresesi in Sivas. The latter was designed as a hospital and medical school. The sultan‚Äôs mausoleum is in the south eyvan of the building under a conical dome.

McDonald and distributed by DMCS Technologies between October 30, 1989 and May 30, 2000 and operated over 18 versions. ==History== McBBS started out as a project for the then High School student Derek McDonald, then attending Charles P. Allen High School in Bedford, Nova Scotia, Canada. As an aspiring young programmer, and unhappy with the software available to him at the time, he set out to prove he could build his own stable computer communications system as a personal project. Heavily influenced by the works of Ken Spence and his Spence XP BBS system of which there were two versions written in 1985 and 1987 respectively, as well as Ed Parry's EBBS and Clarke Development's PCBoard, the McBBS software was originally developed for the Commodore 64 computer but was ported over to the DOS platform in 1992 (starting with McBBS v3.0) where it remained until the project was officially ended in May 2000. The software was written entirely in the BASIC computer language, but starting with version 3.1 in 1992 it was compiled from BASIC into 8086 executable code for DOS. The program featured all the standard functions of a BBS of the time including file transfers in several competing protocols (XMODEM, YMODEM, YMODEM-G, ZMODEM) provided with the program or as third party software; they connected externally to the main program itself. It also featured message boards and a primitive form of what we now call E-mail. The program was also capable of producing simple graphics & text using both the ASCII, PETSCII, and the ANSI escape code character sets and color codes. McBBS also had the advanced and unique feature of a primitive sound broadcasting system allowing the BBS to program the remote computer's beeper speaker using what was essentially an extension of the ANSI Escape Code sequences used exclusively by McBBS. The net result, when used with the appropriate translation software (also supplied by McDonald and company), was audible, if low-resolution music; a demonstration given by McDonald himself once showed the BBS playing The Rolling Stone's \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\", and the William Tell Overture, coded using a simple text editor.The Emperor Product Archives: THE DMCS YEARS,McBBS Technical Specifications and History,Emperor Multimedia Corp.,retrieved October,2007 As far as speed goes, McBBS was one of the first to adopt what was (then) high speed modems exceeding 14400 bit/s, the program itself was small and efficiently written, allowing it great speed. The program was also Y2K and survived the century changeover. The last version \\"McBBS v5.5 rev.3\\" was featured on the Alliance CD as the multimedia component in a last effort to promote the program when Emperor Multimedia Corporation took over the assets of DMCS Technologies when the companies merged. McBBS was marketed exclusively to operators and users of BBS systems over those same BBS public message forums. From time to time advertisements were posted over various BBS networks promoting its virtues. Since McBBS seemed to be a robust product and yet had a small footprint on the computer's memory and disc this feature was heavily exploited. In the early Commodore days the slogan was, \\"McBBS; The Little BBS That Could\\", a spoof off the Children's book The Little Engine That Could. In the PC years the slogan was, \\"Sometimes Big Things Come In Small Packages\\"; this second campaign proving to be the most successful. When networking was introduced the ad gleefully played on the product name saying, \\"You can now do more than just order fries and burgers with it!\\", clearly answering the critics who teased the product's name by spoofing McDonald's restaurants. The Market for the old-style BBS software was eroded by the arrival of the Internet and the Windows GUI operating systems during the late 1990s, and although McBBS had primitive networking capabilities via the FidoNet, and its own proprietary McNET, it was not enough to compete with the internet E-mailing systems, nor could McDonald program a new version fast enough to compete with the arrival of the GUI operating systems. McBBS was terminated a short time after. For sometime the official history of McBBS was available at the Emperor Multimedia website. Emperor Multimedia has since moved on to invest in the entertainment industry, specializing in Multimedia, with assets in internet applications, e-books, databases and web design. McDonald (with Emperor Multimedia) later releases of Polishing of Metal, and the Diskery music distribution firm, would once again see him and his company with commercial success. A scripting language known as \\"Viking\\", as well as a remote communications terminal called Comterm were also developed for McBBS as add-ons for the system; Comterm going on to be a product in its own right that has since been discontinued also. ==Statistics== McBBS's sold for $40 U.S. originally on the Commodore 64 and the later 5.x set, all versions in between were free. It is unknown how many copies of McBBS were sold, but it is known that installations existed in Asia, North America and Europe. The largest concentration of McBBS installations was in the Mid-West USA and Eastern Canada. On August 12, 2007 the UNESCO (a division of the United Nations) \\"Great Library of Alexandria\\" (Bibliotheca Alexandrina) confirmed and accepted receipt of a shipment that would be archived on its shelves. The shipment was sent from Derek McDonald himself, included with this shipment was a single copy of the last version of McBBS released thus far.

It was based on the story \\"Calico Pony\\" (also the working title of the film) by Herb Meadow. It premiered in Woodward's home town, Greenville, South Carolina, at the Paris Theatre. ==Plot== Former brawler and womanizer Luke Fargo (Van Heflin) returns from the American Civil War to his Southern hometown a greatly changed man. Following his traumatic experience at the Battle of Vicksburg, he has become a minister, intent on rebuilding the town's only church. He is greeted with disbelief by his friends, including Matty (Nancy Kulp), and with outright hostility by the rest of the townsfolk, as he had fought on the Union side. Particularly opposed to him is Yancey Huggins (Raymond Burr), who sees a threat to his iron-fisted control of the town. Fargo encounters two very different women from his past. Southern belle Georgina Descrais (Allison Hayes), impoverished by the war, tries to revive their former romantic relationship, as does the local madam, Selma (an uncredited Jean Willes), but he rejects them both. Meanwhile, teenage orphan tomboy Lissy (Joanne Woodward), who had been living in the parsonage, takes a strong liking to him. She continues residing there, which causes Fargo a great deal of trouble, as the townspeople, aroused by Huggins, suspect him of falling back on his old scandalous ways. He does not help matters when he reluctantly gambles on a Sunday with prosperous businessman Albert Loomis (Philip Carey), winning a horse race to obtain lumber for the church, and is goaded into fighting Yancey's men. Finally, the bishop is called in to resolve the situation. He learns that Fargo, not knowing any better, had not been ordained. After hearing how much good Fargo has done in the community, the bishop makes him a real minister and then tries to get him to marry Lissy. When Fargo proves reluctant, the exasperated Lissy hands the bishop her rifle to prod the hesitant (though not unwilling) groom. ==Cast== * Van Heflin as Luke Fargo * Joanne Woodward as Lissy * Philip Carey as Albert Loomis (as Phil Carey) * Raymond Burr as Yancey Huggins * Allison Hayes as Georgina Decrais * Myron Healey as Floyd Miller * Nancy Kulp as Matty Miller * James Griffith as Swallow * Richard Webb as Big, who fights Luke first * Kathryn Givney as Mrs. Decrais, Georgina's mother * Robert Burton as Bishop ==See also== *List of American films of 1955 ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1955 films Category:1955 romantic drama films Category:1950s Western (genre) films Category:American films Category:American romantic drama films Category:American Western (genre) films Category:Columbia Pictures films Category:English-language films Category:Films scored by George Duning Category:Films directed by George Sherman Category:1955 drama films ","title":"Count Three and Pray (film)"},{"id":"11651402","text":"Just Listen (2006) is a young adult novel written by author Sarah Dessen. It is her seventh published novel. ==Plot summary == Annabel Greene is a girl who has it all‚Äîat least, that's how it seems on TV commercials. Annabel's life is far from perfect. Her friendship with her best friends Clarke and Sophie ended bitterly. This left her alone and friendless at the beginning of a new school year. Her sister Whitney's eating disorder is weighing down the entire family, and Annabel fears speaking out about her past and her lack of enthusiasm for modeling. Annabel and Clarke were best friends before meeting Sophie. When Sophie joined their friend group, she bullied Clarke about her allergies and not using makeup. One night, Annabel ditched Clarke to hang out with a boy, and Clarke didn't speak to her again. Later on, Annabel got raped by Sophie's boyfriend Will Cash. Sophie walked in and thought Annabel was fooling around with Will. In the midst of her isolation, she meets Owen‚Äîa music-obsessed, intense classmate who, after taking an anger management class, is determined to tell the truth. With his help, Annabel may start facing her fears‚Äîand more importantly, speaking the truth to herself. ==Characters== * \\"Annabel Greene\\"‚ÄîThe main character of the novel and the youngest of three sisters. She used to be popular, but after a horrific incident at a party, she loses all of her friends and becomes lonely. She is a model, but wants to quit and she has a hard time telling her mother this, who wants her to continue modeling, as she hates confrontation of any kind. She has a habit of not telling the truth so she can try to spare people's feelings. She then meets Owen, and develops a close bond with him. She lets him in, which she doesn't do with any other person. The pair don't speak to one another for two months after a misunderstanding. Only when Annabel comes to tell Owen about her sexual assault and the fact that she will have to speak at a trial to have her rapist convicted does she confront Owen after his radio show one Sunday morning, mending their bond. She confesses what's happened in her life since the party where Will raped her, and he convinces her to testify at the trial. She starts a relationship with him after they share a kiss after the trial. * \\"Owen Armstrong\\"‚ÄîA music obsessed, broody boy, who is a loner. He loves techno music which Annabel isn't very keen on. He also has a little and very annoying sister, Mallory, who is obsessed with models, including Annabel Greene. He had anger problems in the past which caused him to go to Anger Management classes. He meets and develops a close bond with Annabel Greene, whom he falls in love with. Along the way, he teaches her what is important, and to speak the truth. He also has his own radio show named, incidentally, Anger Management that airs every Sunday morning at seven. Once he discovered that Will raped Annabel he goes to see him where a band he knew Will liked was playing at \\"just to look at him\\" but ends up punching him instead; giving him a black eye. Owen, in the end of the novel, starts a relationship with Annabel after explaining why he missed the trial and shares a kiss with her. * \\"Sophie Bark\\"‚ÄîA cruel girl, who was Annabel's best friend for four years. Originally, she was dead-set on being friends with Kirsten, but when that didn't exactly work out she settled for Annabel, figuring she'd have someone to boss around. Annabel chooses Sophie's friendship over Clarke's, who was her best friend prior to Sophie's arrival. Sophie is shown to be bossy, rude, and cruel to people, especially Annabel. She stops being friends with Annabel after thinking she slept with her boyfriend, Will. At the end of the novel, she ends up alone, with no friends and no boyfriend. * \\"Whitney Greene\\"‚ÄîAnnabel and Kirsten's middle sister, who is said to be beautiful, and was also a model. Whitney develops anorexia, weighing down the whole family. She becomes moody and distant but starts redeeming herself at the end of the novel, thanks to her psychiatrist, Moira. * \\"Kirsten Greene\\"‚ÄîAnnabel and Whitney's oldest sister, Kirsten, used to be a model, but quit. She was very rebellious during her teenage years. She and Whitney stop talking to each other, though. Kirsten goes to college and enjoys her classes. She is cheery and bubbly and has a habit of over-talking. However, as the novel reaches its end, she learns to control how much she says. * \\"Emily Shuster'\\"‚ÄîA girl whom Annabel met at a calendar shoot for Lakeview Models. She later abandons Annabel to be friends with Sophie instead, after Annabel becomes a loner. She too is raped by Will Cash, and, like Annabel, this ends her friendship with Sophie. However, unlike Annabel, she tells authorities about Will and gets Will arrested for second-degree rape. * \\"Clarke Reynolds\\"‚ÄîA girl who used to be Annabel's best friend, until Annabel chose Sophie over her. Clarke was born in China and was adopted by the Reynolds when she was six months old. Annabel thought Clarke hated her and Clarke thought Annabel hated her. It appears as though Clarke and Rolly are dating since Annabel vaguely introduced them at Bendo's while waiting for the Truth Squad to come onto the stage (who were the band in the book 'This Lullaby'). They repair their friendship at the end of the novel. * \\"Will Cash\\"‚ÄîSophie's boyfriend who raped Annabel, Emily, and other unknown girls. Will is arrested after Emily reports him and he winds up in jail. Owen punches him, giving him a black eye, for what he did to Annabel. * \\"Mallory Armstrong\\"‚ÄîOwen's hyper, pop music and model loving little sister, who adores Annabel because of her modeling abilities and in general. She annoys Owen because of the music she likes. She also dreams of becoming a model. * \\"Rolly\\"‚ÄîOwen's best friend and Owen's radio show assistant. Later, he becomes Clarke's boyfriend. * \\"Grace Greene\\"‚ÄîAnnabel's mom. She enjoys Annabel's modeling and is clinging on to that part of Annabel's life. Her other daughters, Whitney and Kirsten, had already quit modeling, so Annabel was all she had left. She was heartbroken when Annabel quits at the end of the novel, but then she realizes her daughter is growing up, and she can make her own decisions. * \\"Andrew Greene\\"‚ÄîAnnabel's dad.

It is typical of Spain and several Latin American countries, such as Colombia, where it is usually made with brandy, Cuba, where it is usually made with rum, and some areas of Mexico, where it is typical to use Licor 43, mezcal or a coffee liqueur type Kahl√∫a or T√≠a Mar√≠a. Usually served in a small glass. According to folk etymology, its origin dates to the times when Cuba was a Spanish province. The troops combined coffee with rum to give them courage (coraje in Spanish, which becomes corajillo in its diminutive form, and later carajillo, the word carajo being an expletive in Spanish, meaning \\"penis\\"). In Catalan, the carajillo is called cigal√≥. A similar Italian drink is known as caff√® corretto. == Elaboration == There are many different ways of making a carajillo, ranging from an espresso with the spirit simply poured in, to heating the spirit with lemon, sugar and cinnamon and adding the coffee last. Although the Carajillo is known throughout Spain, the exact way to prepare a Carajillo varies slightly in each region of the Spanish country. In Catalonia, for example, it is usually presented in its most simplistic form of coffee with brandy (unburned) and with the sugar on the side, so that the consumer can add it to his or her taste. In the province of Castell√≥n, on the other hand, the preparation is usually a little more elaborate, because it is normal to heat and partially burn the alcohol in the glass, along with the sugar, cinnamon, coffee beans and a piece of lemon rind. This version is also often preferred by cocktail bars and high-class restaurants when a more luxurious (and more expensive) version is required. A Spanish 'typical recipe' might involve combining three parts of coffee with one part brandy (or other distillate). First, the liquor is heated, to which a few coffee beans, a lemon rind and the sugar are added. Some people also include a small piece of cinnamon stick. The whole is then set on fire and stirred until the alcohol has been reduced a little and the aromas have been enhanced and mixed. It is then extinguished by covering it with a small saucer of coffee. In the meantime, prepare a glass of coffee. The last step is to put everything together in this glass and serve it very hot. If the alcohol is poured first and the coffee is poured not directly but first over the back of a spoon, the liquids are not mixed since they have different densities. The American version uses a heated sugar-rimmed Spanish coffee mug with rum and triple sec. The drink is then flamed to caramelize the sugar. coffee liqueur is then added which puts out the flame, and then it is topped off with of coffee, and whipped cream. In Mexico carajillos are usually made with espresso (or some other type of strong coffee) and \\"Licor 43\\" ‚Äì a sweet vanilla-citrus flavored liquor ‚Äì and poured over ice on a short glass. It is commonly drunk as a digestive after meals.

The book is structured as a series of personal vignettes recounting Stone's global experiences covering approximately 15 years, from about 1958 to 1972. Stone begins this memoir during his final year in the military (1958), when he visited South Africa as a navy journalist. At that time, Stone was serving in the Navy aboard a transport ship in the Indian Ocean. The book ends with Stone in another foreign outpost, this time working as a reporter and correspondent in Vietnam, where he witnessed the invasion of Laos. Some of these experiences were the impetus for what is perhaps Stone's most well-known book: the National Book Award-winning novel Dog Soldiers, published in 1974. Many things happen during the time period between these two episodes. Some of the highlights include Stone's marriage to his wife Janice, and their move to New Orleans in 1960, a city that provides the setting for his first novel A Hall of Mirrors. Stone also describes his family's four-year expatriation in England. However, the core of Prime Green is Stone's account of his friendship with Ken Kesey, starting at Stanford but including New York at the end of Kesey's famous bus trip with the Merry Pranksters to the 1964 New York World's Fair. Michael Silverblatt points out in an interview with Stone that the various \\"locutions,\\" specific to the 1960s, are interesting to hear again as they're channeled through the prose of Prime Green. Stone agrees that some of the images of the 1960s evoked by the spoken word now seem anachronistic. But other locutions still retain their evocative qualities. The memoir is an important document for some cultural historians because it is a first-hand account of many (now iconic) 1960s counterculture moments in the United States, and so may be a vital primary source documenting a crucial time period in a country's cultural, literary, and historical inheritance, transition, and legacy. ==Critical reception== Kirkus Reviews called the book \\"an excellent piece of work, and an invaluable gloss on a body of fiction that looks more prescient, and important, as the decades pass.\\" ==References== ==External links== * * * * * Category:Works by Robert Stone ","title":"Prime Green"},{"id":"11651486","text":"State Route 268 (SR 268) is a secondary state highway in Rutherford County and Murfreesboro, Tennessee, USA. ==Route description== SR 268 runs from US 41/US 70S/SR 1 (North West Broad Street) on the north west side of Murfreesboro, to its Eastern terminus with SR 96 (Lascassas Pike), north-east of Murfreesboro.

In a profile in the Helsingin Sanomat his half- sisters said he had a wife and four children in Somalia. Two other siblings helped support his family in Somalia. The Helsingin Sanomat published a picture of his sister Amina Muumin holding a picture of Abdullah. Carol Rosenberg, writing in the Miami Herald reported that Ismael Arale was one of twelve men transferred from Guantanamo on December 19, 2009. The other eleven men were: Ayman Batarfi, Jamal Alawi Mari, Farouq Ali Ahmed, Muhammaed Yasir Ahmed Taher, Fayad Yahya Ahmed al Rami, Riyad Atiq Ali Abdu al Haf, Abdul Hafiz, Sharifullah, Mohamed Rahim, Mohammed Hashim and Mohamed Suleiman Barre. Abdul Hafiz, Sharifullah, Mohamed Rahim and Mohammed Hashim were Afghans. Mohamed Suleiman Barre was the other Somali. The other six men were Yemenis. == Joint Task Force Guantanamo Detainee Assessment == On April 25, 2011, Guantanamo Detainee Assessment Briefs, signed by the commandants of Joint Task Force Guantanamo, released to the whistleblower organization WikiLeaks, were published by a selection of cooperating newspapers. Unlike most briefs, Abdullahi's seven page memo was unsigned. == References == == External links == * The Stories Of The Two Somalis Freed From Guant√°namo Andy Worthington Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:Somalian extrajudicial prisoners of the United States Category:Guantanamo detainees known to have been released Category:Somalian expatriates in Pakistan ","title":"Abdullahi Sudi Arale"},{"id":"11651603","text":"The Chaddock reflex is a diagnostic reflex similar to the Babinski reflex.

The condition is formalised as follows: Tensed-S condition (TSC) \\"No rule can involve X, Y in the structure ... X ... [Œ±... Y ...] ... where Œ± is a tensed sentence.\\" (Chomsky 1973: 238) The rule accounts for such phenomena as the lack of passivization (a process which turns an active sentence into a passive one) in sentence (2) below: (1) The footballers are believed [to be talented] (2) *The footballers are believed [are talented] Based on the assumption that \\"The footballers\\" originates inside the square brackets in both sentences (as the thematic subject of the predicate \\"be talented\\"), the TSC prohibits its raising (via A-movement) out of the finite clause in (2), but not the non- finite clause in (1). The TSC (along with the SSC) also has implications for binding theory in conjunction with a simple rule of disjoint reference (which stipulated that any pronoun following an NP antecedent in the same sentence, has disjoint reference with it; the rule applies anywhere unless it is blocked). The disjoint reference rule can apply in examples like (3) and (4) (which is an ECM structure) below, but is blocked from applying by the TSC in sentences (5) and (6) ‚Äì where there are clause boundaries ‚Äì thereby allowing the pronoun to refer back to the antecedent. (3) *Johni likes himi (4) *Johni believes himi to like Mary (5) Johni said that Mary likes himi (6) Johni said that hei likes Mary The way the TSC accounted for binding as well as movement phenomena (such as the passivization examples above), was influential for much subsequent research which tried to reduce binding and movement to the same set of principles (see Kayne (2002) for a recent implementation). The subsequent binding conditions A and B of Chomsky (1981) essentially replaced the TSC (as well as the SSC), and it is no longer a part of the toolkit of current researchers. ==References== * * * Category:Generative linguistics Category:Syntactic relationships ","title":"Tensed-S condition"},{"id":"11651620","text":"David Taylor Price (born August 26, 1985) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball (MLB). Price was selected first overall in the 2007 Major League Baseball draft by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and made his MLB debut in September 2008. He has also played for the Detroit Tigers, Toronto Blue Jays and Boston Red Sox. Price pitched as a relief pitcher during the Rays' run through the 2008 playoffs. Weeks after his first appearance in the big leagues, he earned a save in Game 7 of the 2008 American League Championship Series (ALCS), helping the Rays reach their first World Series. Price became a full-time starting pitcher in 2009. In his second full season, he was named the American League starter for the 2010 All- Star Game and finished second in the voting for the 2010 Cy Young Award. He won his first Cy Young Award in 2012. The Rays traded Price to the Tigers during the 2014 season. When the Tigers fell out of the postseason race in 2015, they traded him to the Blue Jays, who won their division and advanced to the ALCS. That following off-season, the Red Sox signed Price to a franchise record seven-year, $217 million contract. He won the series-clinching Game 5 as the Red Sox won the 2018 World Series over the Dodgers. The Red Sox traded him to the Dodgers after the 2019 season. ==Early life== David Taylor Price was born in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. He has two brothers. He began playing baseball in his early childhood. He grew up as an Atlanta Braves fan and idolized outfielder David Justice. He attended Cooperstown Dreams Park as a teenager, and was a standout on the Blackman High School baseball and basketball teams. In his high school career, he compiled a 0.43 earned run average (ERA) and 151 strikeouts. He received the Rutherford County MVP Pitcher (2003 and 2004), the Co-District 7AAA Pitcher of the Year with Michael Alcorn his senior season, and the Rutherford County Male Athlete of the Year in 2002, 2003 and 2004. He played in the 2004 High School All-America Game in Albuquerque, New Mexico. ==College career== Though Price was drafted in the 19th round by the Los Angeles Dodgers out of high school, he did not sign, and instead chose to attend Vanderbilt University on an academic scholarship. He pitched for the baseball team for three seasons. David Price in 2012 In his freshman season in 2005, Price was honored as a Freshman All-American by both Baseball America and Collegiate Baseball. That year he went 2‚Äì4 with a 2.86 ERA in 19 games, compiling 92 strikeouts in 69 innings pitched. Still, frustrated with his college workload, Price almost quit baseball to work at a McDonald's in his hometown but was talked out of it by his coach, Tim Corbin. In 2006, Price posted a 9‚Äì5 record with a 4.16 ERA in 110 innings pitched. He set a school single-season record in strikeouts with 155 while walking only 43 batters. In six starts early in the season, he recorded 10 or more strikeouts each game, including a 17-strikeout performance in a game against Arkansas. That year, he was one of five finalists for the Golden Spikes Award and a semifinalist for the Roger Clemens Award. He was also named to the third-team All-American by the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association, first- team All-South Region by the American Baseball Coaches Association and second- team All-SEC by the coaches in that conference. As a junior, he tallied an 11‚Äì1 record with a 2.63 ERA. He was the nation's top strikeout pitcher, striking out 194 batters over 133 innings, breaking his own school record. His last start against SEC competition came against Mississippi State in the SEC Baseball Tournament. Price pitched a complete game, going nine innings while giving up five hits, two runs, and striking out 11 batters with no walks. His last start at the college level came against Austin Peay in Vanderbilt's first game in the 2007 Nashville Regional. Against Austin Peay, Price retired 17 batters via the strikeout in nine innings of work while yielding just five hits, one run, and two walks. Price won several major national awards, including college baseball's top honor, the 2007 Dick Howser Trophy, and the 2007 Brooks Wallace Award. David Price was the first player to have a clean sweep of all the college baseball awards. ===United States National Team=== In the summer of 2005, Price pitched for the United States National Team. He went 2‚Äì0 with a 1.26 ERA in five games, tallying 39 strikeouts and 13 walks over 28 innings. On August 2, 2005, he pitched a complete game shutout over Nicaragua, only allowing five hits. In the summer of 2006, Price helped the United States take home the gold medal in the World University Baseball Championship held in Cuba. In eight starts for the United States, Price was 5‚Äì1 with a 0.20 ERA. ==Professional career== ===Draft and minor league career=== Price signed his first professional contract on August 15, 2007. The six-year contract was worth $11.25 million ($8.5 million guaranteed), including a $5.6 million signing bonus. After the contract was approved by the MLB, he was added to the Devil Rays 40-man roster before being optioned to the minor leagues to begin his career. The total value of Price's bonus was the largest in draft history. The signing bonus was second-largest in draft history, behind only the $6.1 million Justin Upton received from the Arizona Diamondbacks as the top overall pick in the 2005 MLB draft. The guaranteed value was the third-highest in draft history, trailing only Mark Prior ($10.5 million) and Mark Teixeira ($9.5 million) from the 2001 draft. Price made his spring training debut against the Yankees, hitting the first batter and striking out the next three in one inning of work. His fastball averaged 98 mph. Price was first assigned to pitch for the Vero Beach Devil Rays of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League. He started six games for Vero Beach, compiling a record of 4‚Äì0. He had an ERA of 1.82 with 37 strikeouts in 34 innings pitched. In his second start in Vero Beach, Price pitched against Pedro Mart√≠nez. After the game, Mart√≠nez said of Price: After moving up through the Rays minor league system to the Montgomery Biscuits of the Class AA Southern League in July, Price was promoted to the Durham Bulls of the Class AAA International League on August 9, 2008. After compiling an 11‚Äì0 combined record at Single-A and Double-A, Price received his first professional loss in his first start at Triple-A Durham. ===Tampa Bay Rays=== ====2008 season==== Price made his major league debut with the Tampa Bay Rays on September 14, 2008, against the Yankees. The first MLB hit he allowed was a home run by New York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter; Jeter would later record his 3,000th hit by again homering off Price in 2011. Price pitched 5 innings of relief; he made his first major league start with the Rays on September 22, 2008, against the Baltimore Orioles. He was the winning pitcher in Game 2 of the 2008 ALCS against the Boston Red Sox, earning a post-season victory before winning a regular season game. Price recorded the final four outs in Game 7 of the 2008 ALCS, earning his first career save (regular season or postseason; postseason statistics are recorded separately) and eliminating the defending champion Red Sox. Price then pitched 2 innings in Game 2 of the 2008 World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies; he gave up two earned runs but nevertheless earned his second postseason save. The next day, Price introduced Barack Obama at a campaign rally in Tampa. Price with the Durham Bulls in 2009 ====2009 season==== On May 30, 2009, Price collected his first major league regular season win with a 5‚Äì2 victory over the Minnesota Twins in which he struck out 11 batters in under 6 innings. He completed the season with a 10‚Äì7 record, a 4.42 ERA, 102 strikeouts, and 54 walks in 23 starts. ====2010 season==== In the 2010 season, Price was the first American League pitcher to reach 10 wins, on June 15. On that date, he was 10‚Äì2 and led the league with a 2.31 ERA. Price was selected as the American League starting pitcher for the 2010 All-Star Game. He finished the 2010 season tied for second in the American League (with Jon Lester) in wins (19) and in third place in ERA (2.72). He was eighth in the league in strikeouts with 188. He lost Games 1 and 5 of the 2010 American League Division Series against Cliff Lee and the Texas Rangers. ====2011 season==== During a game against the Yankees on July 9, 2011, Price allowed a home run to Derek Jeter, which was Jeter's 3,000th career hit. Price finished 2011 with a 12‚Äì13 record, 218 strikeouts, and a 3.49 ERA in 34 games started. ====2012 season: Cy Young Award season==== In 2012, Price went 20‚Äì5 on the season (tying for the league lead in wins) with a league-leading 2.54 ERA. Price pitched a complete game shutout against the Los Angeles Angels on April 24, 2012, with the final score 5‚Äì0. Price pitched in the 2012 MLB All-Star Game. Price got his 20th win against the Chicago White Sox on September 30, making him the first 20-win pitcher in Rays franchise history. In recording the win, he became the youngest American League pitcher (aged 27) to earn 20 wins in a season since 2004. Price won the AL Cy Young Award after a tight race. ====2013 season==== Tampa Bay Rays in 2013 In 2013, Price went 10‚Äì8 on the season with a 3.33 ERA, and had an American League leading and career-best four complete games. In the 2013 American League Wild Card tie-breaker against the Texas Rangers, Price pitched a complete game to lead the Rays into the postseason. ====2014 season==== From June 4 to 25, Price had five consecutive starts with at least ten strikeouts, becoming only the eighth pitcher in major league history to do so. On July 6, Price was named to his fourth All-Star team; he did not participate in this All-Star game due to pitching in a game two days prior, avoiding pitching on only one day of rest. He was replaced by Fernando Rodney. Before a July 31 trade to the Detroit Tigers, Price had a record of 11‚Äì8, with a 3.11 ERA, 189 strikeouts, and 23 walks in 23 starts with the Rays. ===Detroit Tigers=== ====2014 season with the Tigers==== On July 31, Price was traded to the Detroit Tigers in a three-team deal that sent Drew Smyly, Nick Franklin and Willy Adames to the Tampa Bay Rays, and Austin Jackson to the Seattle Mariners. In his Tigers debut against the New York Yankees on August 5, Price pitched 8 innings, allowing three runs, striking out ten, and walking none. On August 21, in his first game against his former team, the Tampa Bay Rays, Price allowed one hit and an unearned run with one out in the first inning, then retired the final 23 batters he faced, but suffered a complete game loss. Price is the first pitcher in the major leagues to lose a complete game, one-hitter or better, with no earned runs since Andy Hawkins lost a no-hitter for the New York Yankees on July 1, 1990. It was the first time since 1914 that a pitcher has lost a complete game, one-hit, no walk start without allowing an earned run. On August 27, in a game against the Yankees, Price allowed eight runs and twelve hits, including nine straight in the third inning of an 8‚Äì4 loss. He is the first pitcher since Bob Forsch in 1989 to allow nine straight hits. Only three previous times in major league history had a pitcher allowed 12 hits in two innings or fewer, the others being Shawn Estes in 2003, Johnny Podres in 1963 and George Uhle in 1929. With the Tigers, Price went 4‚Äì4 over the final two months of the season, with a 3.59 ERA and 82 strikeouts in innings. On September 28, the last day of the regular season, Price pitched shutout innings against the Minnesota Twins, giving up four hits, striking out eight, and earning the 3‚Äì0 win, to help the Tigers clinch their fourth consecutive AL Central Division title. Price finished the 2014 regular season with a 15‚Äì12 record, 3.26 ERA and 1.08 WHIP. He led all of major league baseball in innings pitched (), batters faced (1,009) and strikeouts (271). ====2015 season==== On January 16, 2015, Price and the Tigers avoided arbitration agreeing on a $19.75 million salary for the 2015 season, setting a record for the largest one-year deal for an arbitration-eligible player prior to free agency. Price was named the Tigers opening day starter for 2015 by manager Brad Ausmus, ending teammate Justin Verlander's streak of seven consecutive opening day starts. He responded by pitching shutout innings in the Tigers 4‚Äì0 win over the Minnesota Twins. Toronto Blue Jays in 2015 On July 6, 2015, Price was named to the 2015 All- Star Game, his fifth such honor. Price pitched a scoreless fourth inning in the game, striking out two, and earning the win for the AL. He entered the All-Star Break with a 9‚Äì2 record, 2.38 ERA and 115 strikeouts. ===Toronto Blue Jays=== ====2015 season with Blue Jays==== On July 30, 2015, Price was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays for Daniel Norris, Matt Boyd and Jairo Labourt. Price made his debut for the Blue Jays on August 3. He threw 119 pitches in 8 innings, recording 11 strikeouts and a winning decision, while yielding only 3 hits, 2 walks, and 1 earned run in a 5‚Äì1 victory over the Minnesota Twins at Rogers Centre. His 11 strikeouts tied Jos√© N√∫√±ez's team record for most strikeouts in a Blue Jays' pitching debut. On September 5, Price earned his 100th career win, by beating the Baltimore Orioles 5‚Äì1. He was scratched from his final start of the season on October 1, as the Blue Jays had clinched the AL East the previous day. Price made 11 starts for the Blue Jays in 2015, and went 9‚Äì1 with a 2.30 ERA and 87 strikeouts in 74 innings. Price started Game 1 of the ALDS for the Blue Jays, taking the loss and bringing his career postseason record to 1‚Äì6. He would earn his second career postseason win on October 12, pitching 3 innings in relief of R.A. Dickey's game 4 start. Price finished the 2015 season with an 18-5 record and a 2.45 ERA. Price finished second in Cy Young Award balloting to Dallas Keuchel. ===Boston Red Sox=== Boston Red Sox in 2016 ====2016 season==== On December 4, 2015, Price signed a seven-year, $217 million contract with the Boston Red Sox, a franchise record. Price recorded a win in his debut with the Red Sox on April 5, 2016. Price's first season was markedly different from the first to second half. In his first 18 starts, Price compiled an 8‚Äì6 record with a 4.64 ERA. He finished the season at 3.99 ERA with a 17‚Äì9 record. He led the AL with 230 innings pitched and 227 hits allowed. His 228 strikeouts also marked his second highest in his career, after his 2014 season split between Tampa and Detroit. Additionally, he was the first pitcher to start 35 games since Chris Carpenter in 2010. ====2017 season==== Price started the season on the 10-day disabled list with an elbow injury suffered in spring training. Price was activated on Monday, May 29, 2017 and made his debut against the Chicago White Sox that afternoon. On June 29, Price was involved in a verbal altercation with NESN broadcaster and Hall of Fame pitcher Dennis Eckersley on the team's plane; Eckersley had criticized a poor performance by teammate Eduardo Rodr√≠guez, prompting Price to yell, \\"Here he is ‚Äî the greatest pitcher who ever lived! This game is easy for him!‚Äô‚Äô at Eckersley, before doubling down with numerous repetitions of \\"Get the fuck out of here!\\" to the applause of several Red Sox players. Price was criticized for his berating of Eckersley, as well as his refusal to apologize, by both the media and fans. On July 28, Price was again placed on the 10-day disabled list due to left elbow inflammation. He returned to the Red Sox on September 14 and was used from a reliever role for the rest of the season. In the 2017 American League Division Series against the Houston Astros, Price pitched scoreless innings, including four innings in Game 3. The Red Sox would go on to lose the series, 3‚Äì1. ==== 2018 season ==== During spring training prior to the 2018 season, Price said he wished he had handled the situation with Eckersley differently and said he knew he could win the fans back by pitching well. \\"If I go out pitch the way I'm capable of pitching, they won't care,\\" he said. Price returned to the rotation to start the 2018 season and threw 14 scoreless innings in his first two starts, exiting the second one to a standing ovation from the crowd at Fenway Park. \\"When he's healthy, he's one of the best pitchers in the league,\\" said Red Sox manager Alex Cora of Price after the game. On May 9, Price was scratched from a scheduled start against the Yankees due to a mild case of carpal tunnel syndrome. During the 2018 regular season, Price made 30 appearances (all starts) with a 16‚Äì7 record, 3.58 ERA, and 177 strikeouts in 176 innings. In the postseason, Price started Game 2 of the Division Series against the New York Yankees. He allowed three runs on three hits and was removed after innings, taking the loss. This was the tenth postseason game that Price had started during his career, all ten of which had resulted in losses for his teams. Price's next postseason start was Game 2 of the Championship Series against the Houston Astros, which the Red Sox won, 7‚Äì5, with Price allowing four runs, five hits, and four walks in innings; he received a no decision as he did not complete the fifth inning. When Chris Sale became unavailable to start Game 5 of that series for health reasons, Price was called on to start again on only three days' rest, and earned the win, holding Houston scoreless through six innings while allowing just three hits and striking out nine. Winning 4‚Äì1, the Red Sox clinched their first trip to the World Series since 2013. It was Price's first win in 12 career postseason starts, and his third postseason win overall; the two earlier wins had been earned in relief during the 2008 ALCS and 2015 ALDS. Price next started Game 2 of the World Series, holding the Dodgers to two runs on three hits and three walks in six innings while striking out five, and earning the win in a 4‚Äì2 Boston victory. Price also pitched scoreless relief in Game 3 and warmed up in the bullpen for Game 4. Although ace Chris Sale was available on full rest (albeit with a shoulder injury), Price started Game 5, with Alex Cora reasoning that a National League park could require a pinch hitter that would cause him to remove his starter early. Price surrendered a home run to David Freese on his first pitch, but then retired 14 batters in a row. He was relieved in the eighth inning with Boston leading, 5‚Äì1; Joe Kelly and Sale got the final six outs to clinch the World Series victory. On October 31, prior to the Red Sox victory parade, Price announced that he would not exercise an opt-out clause in his contract, saying that he wants to win in Boston; \\"We did that this year, and I want to do it again.\\" In early November, the New York City chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) announced Price as the Babe Ruth Award recipient, honoring the MLB player with the best performance in the postseason. Later in November, Price was announced as the AL Comeback Player of the Year. ==== 2019 season ==== Prior to the season, Price announced that he was changing his uniform number from 24 to 10, a tribute to his son Xavier, since \\"X\\" represents the Roman numeral ten. Price began the season as a member of the starting rotation, pitching to a 1‚Äì2 record with 3.75 ERA in six starts, until being placed on the injured list on May 6, retroactive to May 3, due to left elbow tendinitis. He was activated on May 20, starting and getting the win in a game against Toronto. From May 20 to July 7, Price won 6 straight decisions. Price was briefly on the paternity list in early August, as his wife gave birth to their second child; at the time, he had a 7‚Äì4 record with 3.86 ERA in 20 starts, with 123 strikeouts in innings. Price was placed on the injured list on August 8, retroactive to August 5, due to a left wrist triangular fibrocartilage (TFCC) cyst. He was activated from the injured list on September 1. He pitched that day, then was held out of the rotation due to additional concern about his wrist. He did not pitch again during the season, finishing with 22 appearances (all starts), recording 128 strikeouts in innings and a 7‚Äì5 record with a 4.28 ERA. ===Los Angeles Dodgers=== On February 10, 2020, the Red Sox traded Price, Mookie Betts, and cash considerations to the Los Angeles Dodgers in exchange for Alex Verdugo, Connor Wong and Jeter Downs. In May 2020, Price announced he would donate $1000 to each of the Dodgers minor league players in an effort to help offset their costs during the COVID-19 pandemic. On July 4, 2020, Price announced that he would not play during the shortened 2020 season amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. ==Scouting report== Price uses a wide variety of pitches and complements them with excellent velocity. He throws two fastballs in the range, topping out at ; a four-seamer and a two-seamer. His two-seamer is his lead pitch against right-handed and left-handed hitters, although he uses it more often against lefties. Price also throws a cutter at , used mainly against right-handed hitters (especially in two-strike counts). He rounds out his repertoire with a changeup he uses mainly against right-handed hitters, but also features to left-handed hitters, at , and a spike curveball at . Price tends to set the pace early in games, taking 5‚Äì7 seconds to pitch the ball after it is returned by the catcher. Price's style of pitching has resulted in what some call the \\"Price rule\\", which makes a pitcher specify whether he is working from a set position (often called the stretch) or a full windup when a runner is on third. ==Select awards and honors== * 2012 Cy Young Award * 2010 Warren Spahn Award * 2010 American League All Star starter * 2007 Roger Clemens Award * 2007 Golden Spikes Award * 2007 Dick Howser Trophy * 2007 Baseball America College Player of the Year * 2007 American Baseball Coaches Association National Player of the Year * 2007 American Baseball Coaches Association First Team All American * 2007 Brooks Wallace Award * 2007 Baseball America College All-America First Team * 2007 Collegiate Baseball National Player of the Year * 2007 National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association First Team All- American * 2007 National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association District Player of the Year * 2007 SEC Male Athlete of the Year * 2007 SEC Pitcher of the Year * 2007 First Team All-SEC * 2006 Golden Spikes Award Finalist * 2006 Baseball America Summer Player of the Year ==Personal life== Price married longtime girlfriend Tiffany Smith in November 2016.

This region comprised most of Bitlis and Van provinces and parts of Batman, Mu≈ü, Siirt and Diyarbakƒ±r. The dynasty is sometimes also called S√∂kmenli in reference to the founder of the principality, S√∂kmen el-Kutb√Æ, literally \\"S√∂kmen the Slave\\", one of the commanders of the Great Seljuq Alp Arslan. The Ahlatshah S√∂kmenli should not be confused with the Artuqid branch of S√∂kmenli, which ruled in Hasankeyf during approximately the same period. Another title S√∂kmen and his descendants assumed, as heirs to the local Armenian princes according to Clifford Edmund Bosworth, was the Persian title Shah-i Arman (\\"Shah of Armenia\\"), often rendered as Ermenshahs (Turkish: Ermen≈üahlar). This dynastic name, which the Turkmen rulers adopted, was established through the \\"ethnic make-up and political history\\" of the region they ruled, which was primarily Armenian. The Beylik was founded by the Turkmen slave commander S√∂kmen who took over Ahlat (Khliat or Khilat) in 1100. Ahlatshahs were closely tied to Great Seljuq institutions, although they also followed independent policies like the wars against Georgia in alliance with their neighbours to the north, the Saltukids. They also acquired links with the branch of the Artuqid dynasty based in Meyyafarikin (now Silvan), becoming part of a nexus of Turkmen principalities in Upper Mesopotamia and Eastern Anatolia. The Ahlatshahs reached their brightest period under the fifty-seven- year reign of S√∂kmen II (1128‚Äì1185). He was married to a female relative (daughter or sister) of the Saltukid ruler Saltuk II.Cahen, p. 107 Since S√∂kmen II was childless, the beylik was seized by a series of slave commanders after his death. In 1207, the beylik was taken over by the Ayyubids, who had long coveted Ahlat. The Ayyubids had come to the city at the invitation of people of Ahlat after the last S√∂kmenli ruler was killed by Tuƒürulshah, the ruler (melik) of Erzurum on behalf of the Sultanate of R√ªm and brother of Sultan Kayqubad I. The Ahlatshahs left a large number of historic tombstones in and around the city of Ahlat. Local administrators are currently trying to have the tombstones included in UNESCO's World Heritage List, where they are currently listed tentatively.

It is one of two mid-sized deer in the Hippocamelus genus and ranges across the high mountainsides and cold valleys of the Andes. The distribution and habitat, behaviour, and diet of the deer have all been the subject of study. The viability of the small remaining population is an outstanding concern to researchers. The huemul is part of Chile's national coat of arms and is since 2006 a National Natural Monument. ==Description== Coat of arms of Chile, huemul in left The south Andean deer is well-adapted to broken, difficult terrain with a stocky build and short legs. A brown to greyish-brown coat tapers to white undersides and a white marked throat; the long, curled hairs of the coat provide protection against cold and moisture. Does are 70 to 80 kg. (154-176 lbs.) and stand 80 cm. (31 in.), while bucks are 90 kg (198 lbs.) and 90 cm (35 in). (Other weight suggestions are lower.) There is no sexual size difference amongst fawns, which are born unspotted.Van Winden, Jasper. Diet and habitat of the huemul (Hippocamelus bisulcus) in Bernardo O‚Äô Higgins National Park, Chile (2006). THESIS, Department of Science, Technology and Society, University of Utrecht. (PDF )Retrieved on: 2007-06-07 Sexual dimorphism is notable. Only the bucks have antlers, which are shed each year toward the end of winter. Males also have a distinctive black \\"face mask\\", which curves into an elongated heart-shape surrounding a forehead of the principal brown colour. Unusually for a dimorphic ungulate, research has shown south Andean deer will congregate in mixed-sex groups, and the length of time spent inter-mixing increases with group size. The farther the animals are from rocky slopes the larger the size of observed groups, suggesting predation rates are lowest on slopes and greatest in open areas such as valley bottoms. ==Distribution and habitat== Huemul resting in Cochrane, Chile This deer ranges across a variety of often difficult habitats. It usually prefers open periglacial scrubland, low bluffs, and other rocky areas, as well as upland forests and forest-borders. One study of coastal fjord populations found males and juveniles preferred periglacial grassland; females were mainly found on bluffs, and fawns exclusively so. Gunnera plants were a principal dietary item. While it was previously found over much of southwestern South America, the current status of the south Andean deer is critical. Numbers in Argentina were estimated at 350‚Äì600, in fragmented groups, as of 2005. Argentinian national authorities have been criticized for calling the species' situation satisfactory, where research shows declining numbers; further research on habitat viability and conservation centers have been urged. Pressures on huemul populations include economic activities and invasive species. One study in Argentina's Nahuel Huapi National Park found thirty-two plant items in its diet. The most common of these, the Lenga beech, was also a primary food item of the red deer, causing displacement to marginal areas and increased vulnerability for the smaller South Andean Deer. Both decreased reproduction rates and increased morbidity may be affecting the population in Argentina; predation by the cougar, the South Andean deer's only natural predator, remains a principal cause of mortality in Argentina. == Conservation == According to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the species‚Äô original global population is estimated to have suffered reductions of 99 per cent in size and more than 50 per cent in distribution range. Therefore, the species is listed as ‚ÄúEndangered‚Äù on the IUCN Red List.South Andean Huemul IUCN Red List: http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/10054/0 Habitat fragmentation and poaching remain the main threats to the species. Under the auspices of the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) (the Bonn Convention), a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the Conservation of the huemul was concluded between Argentina and Chile, and came into effect on 4 December 2010. The MoU aims to improve the conservation status of the species by close cooperation between the two range States, since the species migrate across the border region of these countries. ==Memorandum of Understanding on Conservation== The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the Conservation of the South Andean Huemul is a Bilateral Environmental Memorandum of Understanding between the Argentine Republic and the Republic of Chile. It was concluded under the auspices of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), also known as the Bonn Convention, on 4 December 2010 and came into effect immediately. The MoU has to improve the conservation status of the South Andean Huemul by close cooperation between the two range States, since the species migrate across the border region of these countries. The MoU covers two range States (the Argentine Republic and the Republic of Chile), both of which have signed. === Development of MoU === To implement the decision of the Fifth Conference of the Parties of CMS to list the South Andean Huemul (Hippocamelus bisulcus)South Andean Huemul Nature Footage: http://www.naturefootage.com/stockfootage/Southern_Andean_Huemul/owner%3Dslittlejohn on Appendix I of the Convention due to its worrying conservation status, an Article IV agreement was concluded between the two range States, the Argentine Republic and the Republic of Chile, and entered into effect immediately on 4 December 2010. Signatories to South Andean Huemul MoU: * The Argentine Republic (4 December 2010) * The Republic of Chile (4 December 2010) === Aim of MoU === With fewer than an estimated 1500 animals in the wild, grouped in small, largely isolated populations in 2010, and due to the fact that the South Andean Huemul's habitat partly covers border areas between the two range States, both countries recognize the need to work in close collaboration in order to improve the situation and to prevent the species from extinction. Through this MoU both countries can take measures to address illegal hunting, habitat degradation, introduction of diseases and other threats to the species. === Species covered by MoU === The MoU protects all populations of the Huemul occurring within the range of Argentina and Chile. According to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the species‚Äô original global population is estimated to have suffered reductions of 99 per cent in size and more than 50 per cent in distribution range. Therefore, the species is listed as ‚ÄúEndangered‚Äù on the IUCN Red List. Habitat fragmentation and poaching remain the main threats to the species. === Fundamental components === Both range States agree to work in close collaboration to:Text of South Andean Huemul Memorandum of Understanding: http://www.cms.int/species/Huemul/MoU/MoU_Huemul_E.pdf # Make efforts aimed at ensuring an effective protection of the populations of South Andean Huemul, shared by both countries, as well as at identifying and conserving those habitat which are essential for the survival of the species # Identify and monitor the factors and processes which have a detrimental effect on the conservation status of the species, such as illegal hunting, degradation of habitats and introduction of diseases, and recommend appropriate measures to regulate, manage and/or control those factors and processes # Elaborate a Bilateral Action Plan and report to the CMS Secretariat on its implementation # Facilitate the sharing of scientific, technical and legal information necessary to coordinate conservation measures and facilitate professional, technical and park ranger staff sharing, and cooperate with national and international specialists and organizations in the implementation of the Action Plan # Submit, at intervals of no more than one year, a report on the development of the MoU to the CMS Secretariat and the Sub-Commission for the Environment of Argentina and Chile, established within the framework of the Treaty of 2 August 1991 between the Argentine Republic and the Republic of Chile on the Environment # Hold annual meetings alternately in the territories of the two countries The MoU took effect immediately following the signature by both range States (4 December 2010). It has a duration of three years and will be automatically renewed unless one Signatory withdraws from it. === Meetings === The MoU states that the two countries shall hold annual meetings, continuing the bilateral technical meetings held since 1992. In the framework of these meetings, the Action Plan implementation shall be evaluated and actions for the following year shall be planned and coordinated. Similarly, exchange of research results, as well as any other technical or legal information, which might be of benefit to the conservation of the species will be shared. === Secretariat === The secretariat functions are provided by the two Signatories themselves on a rotational basis. During the periods between the annual meetings, the country hosting the next meeting shall serve as interim Secretariat and shall be responsible also for the organization of the meeting. The CMS Secretariat ‚Äì located in Bonn, Germany ‚Äì only acts as a depositary of the MoU. === Action Plan === National technical agencies of the two countries are developing a joint, bi-national Action Plan, based on existing national plans. This Action Plan will promote the exchange of scientific, technical and legal information as well as training of professional staff and park rangers to coordinate conservation measures. Research will be promoted to better understand the ecology and biology of the species as well as factors preventing the recovery of individual groups. Monitoring will be enhanced to collect more data on distribution, abundance and threats. Educational activities and media campaigns will raise awareness about the Huemul's poor conservation status. === Activities === Between September 26 and 27 2011 a workshop entitled ‚ÄúTowards an Action Plan for the Conservation of Huemul in the Austral Zone‚Äù was held in Valdivia, Chile.CMS Press release: http://www.cms.int/news/PRESS/nwPR2011/02_feb/nw_160211_South_Andean_Huemul.htm The purpose of this workshop was to develop the preliminary guidelines for the bi-national Action Plan.http://biodiversity-l.iisd.org/news/argentina-chile- sign-agreement-to-conserve-the-south-andean-huemul/ Meanwhile, Argentina has taken some actions to implement the national plans. These include monitoring in the Los Alerces National Park, new Huemul survey work in Estancia Los Huemules, and continued updating of a database of records maintained by the National Parks Administration for both protected and unprotected areas. Contributions have been made to a study of the phylogeography and demographic history of the Huemul by Bio-Bio University in Chile. Work has also been underway in Argentina to update the management plans for the Lan√≠n National Park and the Andino Norpatag√≥nica Biosphere Reserve, with specific reference to measures for Huemul conservation. A project proposal has been developed for controlling livestock in the area occupied by Huemuls in the Los Alerces National Park. Awareness activities have included public talks, production of a two booklet on the conservation of the species linked to the Andino Norpatag√≥nica Biosphere Reserve, and posters distributed in three of the country's National Parks.COP10 Document on Agreements: http://www.cms.int/bodies/COP/cop10/docs_and_inf_docs/doc_09_%20artiv_agreements_e.pdf In Chile, similar activities are underway, with an emphasis on monitoring by rangers of hunting, and future plans for reintroduction work, measures to reduce habitat competition with livestock, awareness raising and strengthening of regulations. ==References== Category:Deer Category:Mammals of the Andes Deer, South Andean Deer, South Andean Category:Endangered fauna of South America Category:Mammals described in 1782 Category:Argentina‚ÄìChile treaties Category:National symbols of Chile Category:Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals ","title":"South Andean deer"},{"id":"11651663","text":"Peter Nordin (August 9, 1965 ‚Äì October 12, 2020) was a Swedish computer scientist, entrepreneur and author who has contributed to artificial intelligence, automatic programming, machine learning, and evolutionary robotics. == Studies and early career == Peter Nordin was born in 1965 in Helsingborg but moved to Gothenburg in 1967, where he was raised.

The product \\"Palcohol\\" was announced for future release in the U.S. in 2015. ===Customer base=== Officially, Sato says that its products are for business use only, for example for the use of food-processing industries or food-and-drink businesses (e.g. restaurant, caf√©, sweets shop, bakery shop, etc.). Mainly, its products are to be used as food additives. Other than purposes for test sale, research, etc., it has never been sold for eating or drinking, including personal use or home use. In June 1982, Sato started production and sales for the drinking powdered alcohol, as test case. Its name is \\"powdered cocktail Alcock-Light cocktail\\" (\\"Á≤âÊú´„Ç´„ÇØ„ÉÜ„É´ '„Ç¢„É´„Ç≥„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Éª„É©„Ç§„Éà„Ç´„ÇØ„ÉÜ„É´' \\"). At least, during some years, it seems that had continued to test sales. == Public health concerns == Powdered alcohol would generally share the health risks that are associated with traditional liquid alcohol consumption, although there may be some differences in its effects related to differences in consumption potency, differences in characteristics for storage, concealability, and portability, lack of familiarity, and potentially novel delivery methods. Excessive consumption of alcohol can result in acute overdose, intoxication-related accidental injury, compromised judgment, and longer-term negative health consequences including liver disease, cancer, and physiologic dependence. == Consideration for retailers == As with the public health concerns, the following concerns have been posed but data are not yet available to prove or disprove them. Because of the unique characteristics of powdered alcohol, introduction in the U.S. could raise significant concerns from alcohol retailers as it will raise the awareness of their customers health and well as a major priority. including such as restaurants, bars, and sporting venues, including: * Availability of powdered alcohol could negatively affect retailers' economic interests as customers might now have the ability to purchase less relatively expensive and safer alcohol from those businesses by augmenting their purchased liquid alcohol drinks with cheaper powdered alcohol mixtures purchased elsewhere. * Use of powdered alcohol by customers could increase responsibility of these businesses' by increasing the accuracy and abilities to monitor their customers' alcohol consumption - which they are legally required to do to try to prevent the consumption of alcohol by intoxicated or under-age customers. This could hold them at a greater responsibility out of concern of civil-liability lawsuits (because retailers are held liable for alcohol-attributable harms caused by customers who should not have been served alcohol). ==Production process== Schematic illustration of spray drying process. :air (=, =) : Simplified sectional view of a micro-capsule. = = Powdered alcohol is made by a process called micro-encapsulation. An auxiliary material for a capsule may be any readily water-soluble substance (e.g. carbohydrate such as dextrins (starch hydrolyzate), protein such as gelatin). For powdered alcohol, maltodextrin (a type of dextrin) was chosen. For the process to encapsulate, a method called spray drying was selected. In this process, a mixture of dextrin and alcohol is subjected to simultaneous spraying and heating. The spraying converts the liquid to small drops (up to several hundred Œºm (micrometers) in diameter), and the heat causes the hydrous dextrin to form a film. When the film dries, the drop becomes a microcapsule containing alcohol and dextrin. Before and after drying, comparing the amounts of water and alcohol, about 90% of water is removed and about 10% of ethyl alcohol is lost. One of the reasons which are considered, is the following. In mixtures such as this, the speed of molecule movement is dependent on molecule size and carbohydrate (in this case, maltodextrin) concentration. Water, the smallest molecule in the mixture, is able to move and evaporate fastest. In higher concentration, by decreasing water, water molecules can move much faster. After the film formed it is less permeable to larger molecules than water. By the time the film is completed, water has evaporated enough. This phenomenon is called \\"selective diffusion.\\" In general, after sprayed, encapsulation for each drop is completed within about 0.1 second from the very beginning of the process. There is no time for the internal convection in each drop or capsule to occur. Ultimately, large amounts of microcapsules have been produced. These become the powdery matter called powdered alcohol or alcohol powder. According to Sato's web page, powdered alcohol contains 30.5% ethyl alcohol by volume in the state of powder. In addition to the mixture before drying, if necessary, other additives (e.g. extract, sweetener, spices, coloring matter, etc.) may be added. As a result, alcohol powder can be said to be an alcoholic beverage that is \\"dry\\". For example, a \\"dry martini\\" made from alcohol powder may be referred to as a \\"dry dry martini\\" or \\"dried dry martini\\". In the production of alcoholic powder production, other drying methods are not used. For drying foods, there are other methods. Typically, when considering the quality of a powdered product such as coffee, freeze drying seems to be better than spray drying, but this does not apply to alcohol powder production. In fact, \\"freeze-dried beer spice\\" was made by university students for their research. Carbon dioxide, water and alcohol have all been lost. Due to the volatility of alcohol, relatively higher than water, time-consuming methods, such as freeze drying, should not be used. By selective diffusion, loss of alcohol is relatively small. ===Non-commercial production=== In 2014, an article on the website PopSci.com published instructions on how to make pulverized alcohol easily, through a simple mixture of alcohol and dextrin. In this method, the powder is not encapsulated, and also not yet fully dried. Consequently, alcohol continues to evaporate from it very rapidly. Due to flaws in the powdered alcohol produced by this method, this form of powdered alcohol was said to be unsuitable for drinking, carrying, or preserving. Any production of powdered alcohol without a license is illegal in Japan, even if it is only for personal use, according to the Liquor Tax Act of Japan. ==Market== ===Sale in Japan=== Currently, the alcoholic beverage industry in Japan is large and powerful. For example, in fiscal year 2013, Suntory, one of the country's largest beverage companies, recorded sales of 570.7 billion yen (about US$4.7 billion) in alcoholic beverages, excluding wine Currently, the sales revenue from powdered alcohol has been too small to affect the sales of liquid-alcohol companies. Additionally, powdered alcohol's market share is currently too small to be considered as a statistical item in Japanese tax reports. Powdered alcohol is found in some mass production foods, used in small amounts (as are other additives). ===Promotion in the United States=== In 1977, the Associated Press delivered the first news story in the United States about powdered alcohol, which was then an unprecedented product. Investors were quoted as saying that they \\"hope[d] to revolutionize the liquor business with a product that's easy to carry, cheap and potent\\". A test sale of powdered alcohol, called \\"SureShot\\", was done in the United States. == Chemical properties == According to food chemist Udo Pollmer of the European Institute of Food and Nutrition Sciences in Munich, alcohol can be absorbed in cyclodextrins, a synthetic carbohydrate derivative. In this way, encapsuled in small capsules, the fluid can be handled as a powder. The cyclodextrins can absorb an estimated 60 percent of their own weight in alcohol.Alcohol powder: Alcopops from a bag , Westdeutsche Zeitung, 28 October 2004 (German) A US patent was registered for the process as early as 1974.Preparation of an Alcohol Containing Powder, General Foods Corporation 31 March 1972 Chemical structure of the three main types of cyclodextrins ==Routes of administration== * Reconstituted: Alcohol powder can be added to water to make an alcoholic beverage. * Nebulizer: Alcohol powder produced through molecular encapsulation with cyclodextrin can be used with a nebulizer though this could be dangerous. == Prevalence and legal status == ===Australia=== Powdered alcohol is illegal in the state of Victoria, as of 1 July 2015. As of the Liquor (Undesirable Liquor Product - Powdered Alcohol) Amendment Regulation 2018, made under the Liquor Act 1992, Powdered Alcohol in Queensland was banned and pronounced illegal. The NSW Government also recognises powdered alcohol an undesirable product under the Liquor Regulation Act 2018. ===Germany=== In 2005, a product called Subyou was reportedly distributed from Germany on the Internet. The product was available in four flavors and packed in 65-gram, or possibly 100-gram, sachets. When mixed with 0.25 liters of water, it created a drink with 4.8% alcohol. It was assumed that a German producer manufactured the alcopop powder based on imported raw alcohol powder from the U.S. Later, Subyou disappeared and its website: 'subyou.de', was taken down. ===Japan=== The Japanese Liquor Tax Act (:ja:ÈÖíÁ®éÊ≥ï) amendment of April 1981 classifies powdered alcohol as an alcoholic beverage. In the production of powdered alcohol some non-alcoholic ingredients are added which is similar to some liqueurs. Nonetheless, powdered alcohol became a separate category of alcoholic beverages. In May 1981, Sato received the first license to produce alcohol powder commercially. In Japan, powdered alcohol is officially called, . Powdered alcohol is defined by law as a \\"powdery substance that can be dissolved, and can make a beverage containing 1% or more alcohol by volume\\". Before the 1981 amendment, powdered alcohol was outside the scope of Liquor Tax, as it is not a liquid. ===Netherlands=== In 2007, four food technology students in the Netherlands invented a powdered alcohol product called \\"Booz2go\\".Just add water ‚Äì students invent alcohol powder Reuters, 6 June 2007 They claimed that when mixed with water, the powder would produce a bubbly, lime-colored and lime-flavored drink, with 3% alcohol. When put into commercial production, it was expected to sell for ‚Ç¨1.50 (approx. US$1.60) for a 20 gram sachet. The product's creators and marketers ‚Äì Harm van Elderen, Martyn van Nierop, and others at Helicon Vocational Institute in Boxtel ‚Äì claimed to be aiming at the youth market. They compared the drink to alcopops like Bacardi Breezer and said they expected the relatively low alcohol content would be popular with the young segment. Because of complexities in Dutch laws, powdered alcohol like Booz2Go would not be subject to the Alcohol and Horeca Code, because it is not literally an alcoholic drink. This means that anybody of any age could buy it legally. However, when dissolved in water, it would be subject to the Code, according to Director Wim van Dalen of the Dutch National Foundation for Alcohol Prevention. Von Dalen commented that while he generally did not support new alcoholic drinks, he doubted the powder would become attractive. A spokesman of the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport said they would not undertake any actions against the product, but added that the label would have to contain a warning about any health risks for the consumer, in accordance with other laws.Students make alcohol powder, Het Parool, 25 May 2007 (Dutch) In 2014, Booz2go is not yet commercially available. ===Russia=== Russia had plans to ban powdered alcohol in 2016. According to one Russian news site, in 2009, a Professor at Saint Petersburg Technological University named Yevgeny Moskalev invented and patented a method of creating alcohol powder. This method could make alcohol powder from any kind of alcoholic beverage. Powdered stearic acid The method was tested on 96% spirit vodka. In this method, melted wax (stearic acid) is stirred, and the alcoholic drink is poured in. The solution dissipates and becomes drops containing alcohol and wax. The drops that solidify constitute alcohol powder. It was proposed that Moskalev's powdered alcohol could be wrapped in paper and carried around in a pocket or a bag. In addition, a pill form, containing alcohol, was also made with this method. Professor Moskalev responded: \\"powdered vodka tastes like a candle\\"; \\"I did not like vodka in pills\\"; and, in conclusion, \\"vodka is best consumed the old way\\". ===United States=== In 2008, Pulver Spirits began developing a line of alcohol powder products to be marketed in the United States. The marketing was reportedly intended to be in full compliance with alcohol regulations and targeted at adults of legal drinking age. In Spring 2014, the Arizona-based company Lipsmark LLC announced that it would start marketing powdered alcohol under the name \\"Palcohol\\", a portmanteau of powder + alcohol. This caused considerable controversy, after the product was approved by the TTB for sale. This approval was later attributed to a \\"labeling error\\", and the manufacturer surrendered the approvals. In March, 2015, the U.S. Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) approved four powdered alcohol products with the brand name \\"Palcohol\\" for sale in the U.S. Under the Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution, state and territory governments also have substantial regulatory powers over \\"intoxicating liquors\\", especially regarding retail sales and sales to minors. Shortly after the TTB approval was announced, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) responded to inaccurate reports implying that it had approved powdered alcohol as being safe. The FDA clarified that its role was to evaluate the nonalcoholic ingredients and that based on its evaluation of specific powdered alcohol products it had no legal basis to block their entry into the U.S. market. In 2014, Ohio state legislators introduced legislation that would ban Palcohol and all other powdered alcohol. The following year, Iowa state legislators followed suit. Sales were legalized in Colorado in March 2015.https://www.npr.org/2015/03/31/396505291/colorado-allows-sales-of- powdered-alcohol On 25 March 2015, alcohol wholesalers and distributors in the state of Maryland announced an agreement to voluntarily ban the distribution and sale of powdered alcohol. Concerns included the potential for abuse by minors, the ease of using the powder to bring alcohol into public events or to spike drinks, and the potential to snort the powder. At the same time, a bill to ban Palcohol for one year was under consideration in the Maryland House of Delegates. In September 2015, the New Hampshire Liquor Commission banned the sale of Palcohol.\\"Powdered alcohol banned in New Hampshire\\", seacoastonline.com, 15 September 2015. By November 2015, most states had introduced legislation and laws to regulate or ban powdered alcohol. Twenty- seven have banned powdered alcohol, 2 more have placed temporary 1-year bans on the product and 3 have included powdered alcohol under their statutory definitions of alcohol meaning that it is covered by existing alcohol regulations. ===United Kingdom=== The legal status of powdered alcohol in United Kingdom is uncertain. In a January 2015 answer to a parliamentary question, Lord Bates wrote \\"The Government is aware of powdered alcohol from media reports and the banning of the product in five states of the United States of America. The Government is not aware of powdered alcohol being marketed or made available to buy in England and Wales.\\" == References and annotation == ==Further reading== * * \\"Legislative Activity ‚Äì Dangerous Products\\", Alcohol Justice.

He previously played for the Kansas City Royals and Milwaukee Brewers. Moustakas was drafted in the first round (second overall) of the 2007 MLB draft by the Royals. During games he is often greeted by calls of \\"Moose\\", a nickname given by his little league coach along with fans and the media. ==High school career== Moustakas attended Chatsworth High School in Chatsworth, Los Angeles, California, where he was a four-year starter in baseball. During that time he helped Chatsworth to a 124‚Äì11 record, including four West Valley League championships, and two California Interscholastic Federation city titles. Moustakas was voted \\"Player of the Year\\" by Cal-Hi Sports in both his sophomore and junior years. His 52 career home runs in high school are a California prep state record. Moustakas attempted to be a two-sport player for Chatsworth, but a broken ankle suffered in his first game as quarterback for the Chancellors ended his high school football career, and nearly ended his baseball career as well. However, after three months of rehabilitation Moustakas was able to resume playing baseball. In 2006 Moustakas was a member of USA Baseball's Junior National Team, competing in the World Junior Championships in Cuba. He topped off his prep career by being named Baseball America 's High School Player of the Year in 2007, an honor previously bestowed on MLB stars like Joe Mauer, Homer Bailey and Josh Hamilton. Moustakas was also selected to the USA Today All-USA high school baseball team in 2007. He was offered a scholarship to USC, but turned it down and decided to enter the 2007 MLB draft. ==Professional career== ===Minor leagues=== Moustakas with the Wilmington Blue Rocks in The Kansas City Royals selected Moustakas with the second overall pick of the 2007 amateur draft. He signed with the team on August 15, , receiving a reported signing bonus of $4 million. Chatsworth teammate Matt Dominguez was chosen by the Florida Marlins with the 12th overall pick of the amateur draft. The pair became just the sixth set of high school teammates to be selected in the first round of the same draft.Official MLB.com bio MLB.com. Accessed April 28, 2013. Entering 2009, Moustakas was widely regarded as one of the top baseball prospects in all of minor league baseball. The Sporting News ranked Moustakas as the 13th-best prospect overall, while MLB.com listed Moustakas as their 11th-best prospect in all of baseball. Moustakas, however, had trouble adjusting to the Carolina League in 2009. While his power remained, his ability to hit for a high average went down significantly. In 2010, Moustakas' power and average increased significantly. As of July 13, 2010, Moustakas was hitting .352 with 21 homers and 76 runs batted in in AA Northwest Arkansas. On July 15, 2010, he was promoted to Triple-A Omaha. On August 30, 2010, Moustakas was named the 2010 Texas League Player of the Year and on the same night, he set an Omaha Royals record with three home runs and 11 RBIs in one game. Moustakas won the Joe Bauman Home Run Award for most home runs in minor league baseball, winning a tiebreaker with Mark Trumbo. On May 22, 2014, he was demoted to Triple-A Omaha after batting just .152 through 139 plate appearances. ===Kansas City Royals=== Moustakas had his contract purchased by Kansas City on June 9, 2011. He made his debut the following night against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, going 1‚Äì3 with a walk and a run scored. His first major league hit came in his third plate appearance against Ervin Santana, where he would eventually score in the 4‚Äì2 win. Moustakas went on to play in 89 games for Kansas City in 2011, finishing the season with five home runs, thirty RBIs, and a season batting average of .263. On February 18, 2012 the Royals announced they had signed Moustakas to a one-year contract for the 2012 season. No financial terms of the deal were released. During the 2012 season Moustakas set a new club record for K.C., playing 47 straight games without an error. He also made 41 double plays far besting the previous mark of 34 Mark Teahen set in 2006. Moustakas finished the year batting .242 with a .296 OBP with 20 home runs and 73 RBIs, also hitting 34 doubles. In 2013, he batted .233 with a .287 on base percentage, 12 home runs, and 42 RBI. He also led all American League third basemen with 16 errors. Moustakas struggled early in the 2014 season. On May 22, 2014, he was demoted to Triple-A Omaha after batting just .152 through 139 plate appearances, though he led the team in homers with 4. On June 1, Moustakas was recalled from AAA. He began to hit more consistently after this. He finished the season batting .212, while hitting 15 homers and driving in 54 runs. Moustakas tore through the 2014 Playoffs, hitting 5 homeruns, including a go-ahead solo shot in the 11th inning of Game 1 against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. He led all 2014 Postseason players in homers. The Royals would then lose to the San Francisco Giants in the 2014 World Series. In 2015, Moustakas carried over his success from the postseason and had a batting average at or above .300 right up until the All-Star break. He was selected to the 2015 All-Star Game via the All-Star Game Final Vote. On May 15 against the Yankees, he went 4-for-5 with a homer shy for hitting for the cycle. Moustakas was placed on the family emergency list twice during the first half of the 2015 season. On September 12, Moustakas set a new Royals franchise record against the Baltimore Orioles, with 9 RBI, eclipsing the previous mark of seven set by Billy Butler and George Brett. He hit a grand slam, three-run home run and a two-run single in the 14-6 win. In 147 games, Moustakas batted .284 with 22 home runs and 82 RBI. The Royals won the World Series against the New York Mets to win the franchise's first world championship in 30 years. On May 7, 2016, Moustakas was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to a fractured left thumb. On May 22, Moustakas suffered a right knee injury while colliding with teammate Alex Gordon in an attempt to fetch a pop up in foul territory. The next day, an MRI revealed that there was a torn ACL in the knee, ending Moustakas' 2016 season. Moustakas won the All-Star Final Vote for the second time of his career on July 6, 2017, and participated in the Home Run Derby. On July 28, Moustakas hit his 30th home run of the season at Fenway Park, becoming the fastest Royal ever to reach the mark in a season. Moustakas had 38 home runs that season, a new Royals single season record. On March 10, 2018, Moustakas re-signed with the Royals for one year and $5.5 million, plus a mutual option for 2019. ===Milwaukee Brewers=== On July 28, 2018, Moustakas was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers in exchange for Brett Phillips and Jorge L√≥pez. With the Brewers, he batted .256/.326/.441. On October 4, 2018, Moustakas hit a walk- off single in the 10th inning of NLDS Game 1 vs the Colorado Rockies, giving the Brewers a 3-2 win and a 1-0 series lead. The Brewers later swept the series in three games, but would proceed to lose the NLCS to the Los Angeles Dodgers 4 games to 3. On October 30, 2018 Moustakas declined his half of a mutual option for 2019 and became a free agent. On February 19, 2019, Moustakas re-signed with the Brewers, inking a one-year, $10 million deal with a mutual option for 2020. He declined his half of the option and became a free agent after the 2019 season. ===Cincinnati Reds=== On December 5, 2019, Moustakas signed a 4-year, $64 million contract with the Cincinnati Reds, the largest free agent deal in Reds history. ==Personal life== The son of Connie and Mike Moustakas, a former college football player for UCLA, Mike was born in Los Angeles on September 11, 1988, and grew up in the Los Angeles area. He is of Greek descent, as his grandmother was born in Greece, and he flew a Greek flag above his locker in the Royals' clubhouse. He is the nephew of author, MLB player and former New York Mets hitting coach Tom Robson, who gave Moustakas hitting tips growing up. Moustakas' mother died in 2015 after a long illness. When not playing baseball Moustakas enjoys golf and fishing. Asked by USA Today what career he would enjoy other than baseball, Moustakas expressed an interest in being a firefighter. Moustakas and his wife, Stephanie, have been married since 2014, and they have a daughter and a son. They also have an Australian shepherd named Gus. ==References== ==External links== Category:1988 births Category:Living people Category:All-Star Futures Game players Category:American League All-Stars Category:American people of Greek descent Category:Baseball players from California Category:Burlington Bees players Category:Cardenales de Lara players Category:Cincinnati Reds players Category:Idaho Falls Chukars players Category:Kansas City Royals players Category:Major League Baseball third basemen Category:Milwaukee Brewers players Category:National League All-Stars Category:Northwest Arkansas Naturals players Category:Omaha Royals players Category:Omaha Storm Chasers players Category:People from Chatsworth, Los Angeles Category:Sportspeople from Los Angeles Category:Surprise Rafters players Category:Wilmington Blue Rocks players ","title":"Mike Moustakas"},{"id":"11651763","text":"Samuel Kenneth Gruneisen (January 16, 1941 ‚Äì September 28, 2012) was an American football player and coach.

He grew up in a middle class home in Oslo. Reider Aulie was the younger brother of Andreas Aulie (1897‚Äì1990), a lawyer who was the Norwegian attorney general (Norges riksadvokat) from 1946 until 1967. Aulie graduated in 1927 and traveled to Paris in the autumn with fellow student, Bjarne Ness, who died of tuberculosis just before Christmas that year, only 25 years old. His death made a strong impression on the younger Aulie who had shared lodgings with Ness. Aulie debut at the Autumn Exhibition (H√∏stutstillingen) in 1927. Aulie already had in the 1930s, illustrated books by such authors as Ingeborg Refling Hagen and Martin Andersen Nex√∏. As a young progressive and intellectual artist, Aulie sided with the labor movement within the national political struggle. Aulie paintings are full of symbolism and there is often room for several interpretations. Aulie was always concerned with the common man and portrayed him with great enthusiasm. In the 1930s he became an artist for the Socialist movement. In 1932 he participated in the Anti-War Conference in Amsterdam the same year and was chairman of the Anti-War Committee in Oslo and the surrounding area. In 1936 Aulie built a house and studio on Maridalsveien Street in Oslo, where he lived the rest of his lifeReidar Aulie (Galleri Jan Graff ) He became best known for the art produced during the Second World War. Aulie had a significant production in the years 1940-45, during periods spent hiding on a small farm owned by his in-laws in Eidsberg. Aulie's main production year was 1943 when he painted the important war pictures of subjects that would not be tolerated by German censorship. His notable work, entitled 9. april 1940, tells of the invasion which resulted in the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany. In the winter of 1945 he was sent to Grini concentration camp.April 9, 1940 (Norwegian Art and design during World War II) In 1950 he painted Arbeiderbevegelsens historie, a fresco of the labor movement's history, in Oslo City Hall. His last two decades were marked by the teaching duties, first as professor from 1958 and later as rector from 1965 at the Norwegian National Academy of Fine Arts.

It is in Province VI. Its cathedral, Trinity Episcopal Cathedral, is in Omaha, as are the diocese's offices. As of 2019, the diocese contains 52 congregations and 7,096 members. Average Sunday attendance is approximately 2,418 across the diocese. == Bishops == # Robert Harper Clarkson (1865-1884) # George Worthington (1885-1908) # Arthur Llewllyn Williams (1908-1919) # Ernest Vincent Shayler (1919-1938) # Howard R.

Krotz (1989-2002) # Joe Goodwin Burnett (2003-2011) # Joseph Scott Barker (2011‚Äìpresent) Following the resignation of Joe G. Burnett, J. Scott Barker was consecrated as bishop in October 2011. His election was held during a special diocesan council meeting held at St. Mark's Pro-Cathedral in Hastings, Nebraska. == History of the Diocese of Nebraska == ===Earliest History=== While it is certain that men and women associated with the Episcopal Church were included among the earliest explorers and settlers of the territory that came to be called Nebraska, it is unknown who those first Episcopalians might have been and where in the territory they might first have led worship services from the Book of Common Prayer. The first Episcopal clergyman known to have served in the Nebraska territory was The Rev. James DePui, a Chaplain at Ft. Kearney. ===Earliest Parishes=== In 1856 several churchmen in Omaha city requested the Bishop of Iowa visit them and consult about forming a parish. The Rev. Dr. Edward Peet arrived April 12, 1856 and met with 8 or 10 churchmen who organized a parish under the name of Trinity Church. On Sunday, April 13, Dr. Peet conducted the first known service of the Episcopal Church in Omaha. In the autumn of 1857 an Episcopal missionary, the Rev. Mr. Eli Adams, came to Nebraska City and organized a parish under the name of St. Mary's. Having accepted a call from the vestry to be the rector, Adams went east to spend the winter. He returned in the spring of 1858 and found the parish had not been incorporated. On July 4, 1858, at the morning service the little congregation of pioneers adopted the following preamble: \\"We whose names are hereto affixed, deeply sensible of the truth of the Christian religion, and earnestly desirous of promoting its holy influences in our hearts and in those of our families and neighbors, do hereby incorporate ourselves under the name of St. Mary's Parish in Nebraska City, Nebraska Territory in communion with the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States.\\" ===The Earliest Bishops=== The Episcopal Church General Convention of 1838 tasked the great Missionary Bishop, Jackson Kemper with jurisdiction over, \\"the Territories of Wisconsin and Iowa and in all other parts of the United States north of latitude 36 1/2 where the Church is as yet unorganized.\\" That included the area that came to be known as Nebraska. Following Bishop Jackson Kemper, the Rt. Rev. Joseph C. Talbot served as a missionary bishop to the west. Kemper was the first bishop of the Episcopal Church with exclusive jurisdiction west of the Missouri River (parts of Kemper's missionary territories were located further east.) Bishop Talbot made Nebraska City (and St. Mary's) his home for five years beginning in 1860, during which time he laid foundations for the Episcopal Church's later work in his vast jurisdiction which included the present states of Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, and California. ===Nebraska‚Äôs ‚ÄúFirst‚Äù Bishop=== Because he was appointed to serve a smaller and distinct area of the U.S. (Nebraska and the Dakotas) and because he made Nebraska his permanent home and seat, Robert Harper Clarkson is remembered as the first Bishop of Nebraska. Clarkson was born on November 19, 1826 in Gettysburg, PA and received a B.A. from Pennsylvania College in 1844. He was ordained deacon on June 18, 1848, and priest on January 5, 1851. He married Meliora McPherson on May 18, 1849. They had two daughters, Mary and Nellie. In his earliest days of ministry, Clarkson and his spouse lived in Chicago, Illinois. They were in the city during the days of the 1849 Chicago cholera outbreak that killed 678 people. Although some other clergymen fled the city, Clarkson stayed to minister to the sick and bury the dead. He went on to earn a D.D. from Racine College which was awarded in 1857 while he was serving as the rector of St. James's Episcopal Church in Chicago. Clarkson was consecrated Missionary Bishop of Nebraska and Dakota on November 15, 1865. During his ministry in Nebraska, Clarkson helped establish the first Christian missions to the Ponca Indians and was responsible for building fifty churches in his diocese as well as a children's hospital. Clarkson designated Trinity Church in Omaha as his cathedral and soon determined to improve that physical plant. He laid the cornerstone for the current cathedral building on May 25, 1880. Trinity served as the base of many Episcopal missions to areas of the western United States and remains today the episcopal seat of the Bishop of Nebraska. Clarkson received an LL.D. from the University of Nebraska in 1872. He died on March 10, 1884. ===Western Nebraska=== For almost sixty years there were 2 dioceses in the state of Nebraska. In 1889 the Missionary District of The Platte was split off from the Diocese of Nebraska at about mid-state. The first bishop of the diocese was Anson Rogers Graves who served from 1890 through 1910. During Bishops Graves tenure, the new diocese was renamed the Missionary District of Laramie, and later the Missionary District of Kearney. In 1910, George Allan Beecher became the second bishop of the western diocese. During Beecher's tenure, which lasted until 1943, the diocese was again renamed. It became the Missionary District of Western Nebraska. In 1918, Beecher designated St. Mark's Church in Hastings as Pro-Cathedral for the Western Nebraska district. In 1946, the Diocese of Western Nebraska was re-absorbed into the Diocese of Nebraska. Saint Mark's in Hastings is still the Pro-Cathedral of the Diocese of Nebraska. ==References== ==External links== *The Episcopal Diocese of Nebraska *Journal of the Annual Convention, Diocese of Nebraska *Episcopal Diocese of Nebraska Newspaper Collection, University of Nebraska at Omaha Criss Library Archives and Special Collections.

She organised a series of Indian arts festivals in the 1980s in France, the US and Japan that helped to popularise Indian arts in the West. She was a friend and biographer to both the Nehru-Gandhi family and J Krishnamurti. Jayakar had a close relationship with three prime ministers: Jawaharlal Nehru, his daughter Indira Gandhi and her son Rajiv Gandhi, and it was well established that she was one of Indira Gandhi's closest personal friends. She served as cultural adviser to the latter two, confirming her preeminence in cultural matters. She \\"presided colossus-like over the country's cultural scene for nearly 40 years,\\" founding key arts and crafts institutions and promoting talented artists, and Indian arts and crafts through festivals and exhibitions worldwide. In 1950, Jawaharlal Nehru invited her to study the handloom sector and work out plans for its revival. Eventually she served as chair of the All-India Handloom Board and Handicrafts and Handlooms Export Corporation and played an important role in the revival of Madhubani painting. Jayakar founded the National Crafts Museum in 1956 and the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) in 1984 to restore and manage monuments and advocate for heritage property conservation. She was a founder and trustee of the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA), established in 1985, and, in 1990, founded the National Institute of Fashion Technology in New Delhi. She was awarded the Padma Bhushan (India's third highest civilian honour) in 1967. ==Early life and education== Jayakar was born in 1915 at Etawah in the state of United Provinces (later known as Uttar Pradesh). Her father was a liberal intellectual and senior officer in the Indian Civil Service while her mother came from a Gujarati Brahmin family from Surat, where Pupul spent her yearly summer breaks. She had a brother, Kumaril Mehta, and four sisters, Purnima, Premlata, Amarganga and Nandini Mehta. Her father's work took the family to many parts of India, where she got the opportunity to absorb local crafts and traditions early on in life. At the age of eleven, she went to Banaras (Varanasi), where she studied in a school started by Annie Besant, theosophist, who was also active in Indian freedom movement. Subsequently, her father got posted to Allahabad, where she first came in contact with the Nehru family at age fifteen, as her father was a friend of Motilal Nehru. Later, she became friends with the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Priyadarshini Nehru (later, Indira Gandhi). She attended Bedford College in London before graduating from the London School of Economics in 1936. On returning home she married Manmohan Jayakar, a barrister, and settled down in Bombay (now Mumbai). ==Career== After settling in Bombay, she launched \\"Toy Cart\\", an English-language children's magazine illustrated by noted painters Jamini Roy and M. F. Husain. She became politically involved after becoming assistant to Indian National Congress activist Mridula Sarabhai in the Kasturba Trust in 1940. She was also appointed assistant secretary of the women's affairs in the National Planning Committee, then headed by Jawaharlal Nehru. In the late 1940s she became friends with J. Krishnamurti and also became involved in the handloom industry. She established the Weavers' Service Centre, Besant Nagar, in Madras (Chennai), under the aegis of the Ministry of Textiles. Early on, she became close friends with Indira Gandhi who, on becoming prime minister in 1966, appointed Jayakar as her cultural adviser. She became the executive director and later chair-person, of the Handicrafts and Handloom Corporation of India. From 1974 for three years she chaired the All India Handicrafts Board (HHEC). She was behind the Festivals of India organised in London, Paris, and America lasting several months in the early 1980s and the 'Apna Utsav' (Our Festivals) during the tenure of Rajiv Gandhi, to whom also she was a cultural adviser, and held the rank of Minister of State. In 1982, she was appointed vice- president of Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR), and remained vice- chairman of the Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust (1985‚Äì1989), apart from being the Prime Minister's adviser on heritage and cultural resources. At the request of her friend Indira Gandhi, she founded the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage in 1984.The tapestry of her life Malvika Singh, Indian Seminar, 2004. Pupul Jayakar was one of the enduring supporters of the 'Hungry Generation', a literary movement in Bengal, and had helped the Hungryalites during their trial in 1961. She was active with the Krishnamurti Foundation in India until her death. She helped in the establishment of the Krishnamurti Foundation in India, the United States, England, and some Latin American countries. As a member of the Krishnamurti Foundation of India, she was closely involved with Rishi Valley School at Madanapalle, Chittoor District of Andhra Pradesh as well as other Krishnamurti Foundation Schools in India. ==Family== She married Manmohan Jayakar, a barrister, in 1937, who died in 1972. Her daughter, Radhika Herzberger, was born in 1938, and, as Director of the Rishi Valley Education Centre, presides over and runs the Rishi Valley School at Rishi Valley, Chittoor district, Andhra Pradesh; Sahyadri School in Sahyadri Hills Pune; Rajghat Besant School at Varanasi; The School, KFI in Chennai; The Valƒ∫ey School in Bangalore and other Krishnamurti Foundation of India schools. Kathak danseuse, Aditi Mangaldas is her sister, Nandini Mehta's granddaughter. She died in Mumbai, on 29 March 1997, after a brief illness. ==Books== Her best known books are her two biographies: J. Krishnamurti: A Biography (1988) and Indira Gandhi: An Intimate Biography (1992). In the latter, Jayakar reveals that her close friend Indira Gandhi had personally expressed to her a premonition of her death in the wake of the Operation Blue Star incident. ==Hungryalist Movement== When the members of Hungryalist movement were arrested and cases were filed against them, Pupul Jayakar took up the matter with Indira Gandhi as a result of which Shakti Chattopadhyay, Sandipan Chattopadhyay, Binoy Majumdar, Sunil Gangopadhyay, Saileswar Ghosh, Subhash Gho0sh, Subo Acharya, Tridib Mitra, Falguni Roy, Basudeb Dasgupta, Subhash Ghose, Abani Dhar were exempted and case was filed against only Malay Roychoudhury as he was the leader of the movement and had become known throughout the literary world.

The site of the first wooden church was built in the late 1200s. The church was re-built from its medieval design, and it was re-designed into a cross-church at the end of 1700s. == History == The first church stood on the site was probably a small chapel built in stone or wood. The oldest parts of the present church originate from the 1400s. The original medieval stone church had the shape of a rectangular nave with the altar in the east and a tower in the west. In 1787 work began on the renovation to become an equal-arm cross- church. The work would be performed by the 33-year-old Jacob Rijfs after drawings approved by King Gustav III. The drawings were followed, but not exactly down to the word, thus, the 65m high spire was preserved. The model for this steeple is believed to have been the Storkyrkan tower in Stockholm from the 1490s. In July 1985, the spire was destroyed in a fire that also destroyed the former altarpiece and organ. After the fire, the church was completely renovated after the architect Erik Crow's drawings and was restored in 1986. A new 39-note organ was installed in 1988. It was made by the Danish organ building company Marcussen & S√∏n, and became the fifth church organ. === The Bell Tower === The bell tower is built with a ground floor made of stone in a typical Ostrobothnian style. The upper part is built of wood. The bell tower was built under the supervision of Thomas Rijf and Matt Honga during the years of 1769-1775. One of the belfry's bells are from 1488 and was probably manufactured in Tallinn. In 1615, Jacob De la Gardie bought the clock from its original place in Turku Cathedral and donated it to the church of Peders√∂re. == Gallery == File:Fattigmanskassa ved Peders√∂re kyrka.JPG|The Poor Man Statue outside of Peders√∂re Church File:Jakobstad Pedersore church.jpg|Peders√∂re Church in Jakobstad, Finland File:Peders√∂re bell tower 20180705.jpg|The bell tower at the church File:Peders√∂re kyrka bak tr√§der.JPG|A partial view of the front of the church File:Peders√∂re kyrka.jpg|From the work \\"Finland in words and pictures\\" of O.M.

It initially operated as a training unit, flying a mixture of types, including the Avro 504, Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2 and the Armstrong Whitworth F.K.8, but in January 1917 it changed its role to a day-bomber squadron and re-equipped with the Airco DH.4, being the first squadron to receive the new light bomber.Halley 1980, p. 91.Ashworth 1989, p. 130. It took these to France on 6 March that year as part of 9th Wing, flying its first bombing mission against Valenciennes railway station on 23 April 1917 in support of the Battle of Arras.Bruce Flight 17 October 1952, p. 507. Having been based at Tantonville where muddy conditions hampered operations, it moved at the beginning of June 1918 to Azelot. It became part of the Independent Air Force as part of No 41 Wing,Rennles 2002, pp. 5‚Äì6. carrying out daylight strategic bombing missions against targets in Germany. 55 Squadron developed tactics of flying in wedge formations, bombing on the leader's command and with the massed defensive fire of the formation deterring attacks by enemy fighters.Williams 1999, p. 84. Despite heavy losses, 55 Squadron continued in operation, the only one of the day bombing squadrons in the Independent Force which did not have to temporarily stand down owing to aircrew losses.Williams 1999, p. 195. The squadron flew 221 bombing missions during the war, dropping approximately of bombs during the war.Moyes 1964, p. 82. Following the Armistice on 11 November 1918, 55 Squadron was briefly used to run airmail services to British forces, before returning to the United Kingdom and losing its aircraft in January 1919, formally disbanding on 22 January 1920. ===Between the Wars=== The Squadron reformed on 1 February 1920, when No. 142 Squadron, based at Suez and equipped with Airco DH.9s was renumbered. It started to receive more capable Airco DH.9As in June 1920, and was equipped with a mixture of DH.9s and DH.9As when it transferred to Turkey in July to support British forces occupying Constantinople and the Dardanelles.Ashworth 1989, pp. 130‚Äì131.Halley 1980, pp. 91‚Äì92. It moved to Baghdad in Iraq in September 1920 discarding its remaining DH.9s to standardise on the DH.9A.Halley 1980, p. 92. The squadron moved to Mosul in March 1921 and to RAF Hinaidi in May 1924. It remained in Iraq for 19 years, on occasion flying \\"Air Policing\\" operations against rebelling tribesmen. The ageing DH.9As were replaced by Westland Wapitis in February 1930, which in turn were replaced by Vickers Vincents in 1937,Ashworth 1989, p. 131. taking these to RAF Habbaniya in September that year. It finally received modern monoplanes in March 1939, when it received twin-engined Bristol Blenheim bombers, transferring to Egypt just before the outbreak of the Second World War. ===Second World War=== No. 55 Squadron flew its Blenheims on shipping patrols over the Gulf of Suez until Italy declared war in June 1940, when it switched to operations against targets in Libya. On 11 June 1940 the unit participated in the first attack by the RAF on the Italian air force base at El Adem, where 18 aircraft were destroyed or damaged on the ground, against the loss of three British aircraft from 3 squadrons.Playfair, Vol. I, page 112. It was switched to anti-shipping operations in September 1941, continuing these operations until it was withdrawn from operations in March 1942 for conversion to Martin Baltimores, after which it returned to the bombing role. The squadron continued in support of the Eighth Army for the remainder of the North African Campaign. It flew its Baltimores on bombing raids in support of the Allied invasion of Sicily and the subsequent invasion of Italy. It re-equipped with Boston light bombers in October 1944. The squadron moved to Greece in September 1945, replacing its Bostons with de Havilland Mosquitos in June 1946, disbanding in December that year. ===Victors=== A 55 Sqn Victor K1 refuels a US Navy KA-6D Intruder from VA-65, in 1971. No. 55 Squadron did not reform until 1 September 1960 at RAF Honington, when it became part of the RAF's V bomber force, being the fifth squadron equipped with the Handley Page Victor when it received Victor B.1As.Mason 1994, p. 389. When the Vickers Valiant was grounded in December 1964 owing to metal fatigue, the RAF lost its aerial refueling tanker force, and a rush programme was launched to convert Victor B.1s to fill the tanker gap. From May 1965 when it moved to RAF Marham, 55 Squadron received six interim two-point Victor BK.1A tanker conversions, allowing it to become operational in the tanker role in August 1965.Gunston Aeroplane Monthly February 1981, p. 65. It had replaced the interim BK.1As with the definitive three-point tankers (Victor K.1 and K.1A) by December 1966, retaining them until 1975, when they were replaced by the more powerful Victor K.2. 55 Squadron provided tanker support during the Falklands War in 1982, including for the Operation Black Buck raids, where they refuelled Avro Vulcan bombers to allow them to reach the Falklands from Ascension Island. 55 Squadron's Victors went to war again in 1991, when it was deployed to the Gulf as part of Operation Granby, Britain's response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, refuelling coalition aircraft during Operation Desert Storm.\\"Third Tornado squadron goes to Saudi Arabia\\". Flight International, 9‚Äì15 January 1991.World Air Power Journal Volume 5 Spring 1991, p. 35. It disbanded on 15 October 1993, the last Squadron to operate the Victor.Mason 1994, p. 390. ===Training roles=== On the same day as No. 55 Squadron disbanded as a Victor squadron, No. 241 Operational Conversion Unit at RAF Brize Norton was renumbered No. 55 (Reserve) Squadron. This OCU was responsible for training Vickers VC10 and Lockheed TriStar crews, although it had no aircraft of its own. Disbanding again on 31 March 1996, it reformed at RAF Cranwell on 1 November 1996 when the Navigation Squadron of No. 3 Flying Training School, flying Hawker Siddeley Dominie T.1, weapon systems officer and weapon systems operators trainers, adopted its identity. The Dominie T.1 was withdrawn from service, and the squadron disbanded, when WSO and WSOp training ended on 20 January 2011. ==References== ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== * Ashworth, Chris.

The beaning followed a controversial play in the sixth inning when American outfielder Nate Schierholtz made a hard slide home against backup catcher Yang Yang on a sacrifice fly. Yang was in the game after China's starting catcher Wang Wei left the game after suffering a left knee injury following a collision at the plate with LaPorta in the fifth inning. After being struck by the pitch, LaPorta was taken to a hospital for a precautionary CAT scan; Chen Kun and China's pitching coach Steven Ontiveros were ejected from the game.

However, when the Indians signed Russell Branyan and announced he would be the everyday first baseman, LaPorta instead became a contender for the left field position, along with Michael Brantley. Branyan's back problems limited him to no game action during spring training, causing him to begin the season on the 15-day disabled list. Consequently, LaPorta was moved back to the first baseman position. After Branyan was activated from the disabled list on April 20, LaPorta was moved primarily to the backup first baseman role, with some playing time in left field. In order for him to receive more at-bats and continue his development, LaPorta was optioned to Triple-A Columbus on June 7. On June 27 the Indians traded Branyan to the Seattle Mariners for outfielder Ezequiel Carrera and shortstop Juan Diaz, LaPorta was recalled from Triple-A Columbus to be the everyday first baseman for the Indians. === 2012 season=== According to Baseball Reference, LaPorta split the 2012 season between the Indians (22 games) and the Columbus Clippers (101 games).

Trumptonshire is populated by characters portrayed by 8-inch (20 cm) tall stop-motion puppets. Trumpton is a market town with an impressive town hall and clock tower; Camberwick Green and Chigley are two nearby villages. ==Trumptonshire communities== From the dialogue of Camberwick Green it is discovered that Wellchester is the main city of Trumptonshire county. In the Chigley episode \\"The Balloon\\" viewers are given sweeping aerial views across the Trumptonshire countryside and skyline; from this it is seen that Trumptonshire possesses a large medieval castle, although it is never named in the programmes. Murray is not known to have provided any definitive map of Trumptonshire. The only map regularly seen in the programmes is located in the control room of Trumpton fire station, and analysis has suggested that it actually depicts the area around Florence in Italy. Nonetheless, the following Trumptonshire settlements are identified in the storylines of the programmes. *Camberwick Common, bordering Camberwick Green, is not visited in the programmes, but is referenced as a usual place of training for the Pippin Fort soldier boys.See bottom of page Camberwick. There are clay pits nearby. *Camberwick Green is a quiet village community with a Post Office and several village shops, as was still common in late 1960s England. The wider parish includes outlying properties such as Colley's Mill, Bell's farm, Tripp's Dairy, and Pippin Fort. The village is central to the first Trumptonshire series, and features in all three series. *Chigley is another quiet village community, but with a less defined village centre. It is located a short distance from Camberwick Green. It features some heavy industry, including Cresswell's Chigley Biscuit factory, and Treddle's Wharf, as well as cottage industry, represented by the Chigley Pottery. A canal (named as the Trumpton Canal) and a river (unnamed in the programmes) run through the village. It is central to the third Trumptonshire series. *Trimbridge is the next village after Chigley along the river; the river bridge at Trimbridge is the first crossing point of the river after Chigley bridge; there is a direct road from Chigley to Trimbridge, running alongside the river. *Trumpton is the local market town, with a local corporation and mayor, and numbers of infrastructure features for the wider region, most famously the Fire Brigade. There are various shops, and a large public park, and many streets of terraced housing. Some residents (such as the Mintons) are depicted as living in cottages on the outer edge of the town. It has (amongst other facilities) a hospital, swimming pool, public library, waterworks, and gasworks. It is central to the second Trumptonshire series. *Wellchester is the county's large town or city community, some distance from Trumpton, and with large department stores. The character Mrs Honeyman ventures to Wellchester (in Camberwick Green episode 6) having heard that one of the department stores has a sale on hats. *Winkstead Hall estate is the home of Lord Belborough and his domestic staff, located on the edge of Chigley. It is depicted in every Chigley episode. *Wintlebury is another Trumptonshire town. The programmes were made in an era in which many British communities were adjusting to life without local railway services, following the Beeching cuts. The only rail service depicted in the series is Lord Belborough's heritage railway, but the nearest mainline railway station is said to be in Wintlebury, from which there are direct trains to London. Driving directions quoted in the series reveal that Wintlebury is reached from Chigley by driving through Trumpton. ==Actual locations== The true locations on which the fictional communities were based remain uncertain. According to Murray, the three title communities are however based on real locations one and a half miles from each other at the corners of an equilateral triangle. The real-life locations most frequently cited are Wivelsfield Green (Camberwick Green), Plumpton (Trumpton), and Chailey (Chigley), historically known as Chagley, which are neighbouring communities in a roughly triangular configuration in Sussex. In such an explanation the city of Wellchester could be Chichester. These Sussex locations have been proposed as the Trumptonshire inspiration in the mainstream British media. ==DVD== BBC Studios and Post Production's Digital Media Services team remastered all 39 episodes of the Trumptonshire Trilogy in 2011 for DVD release, cleaning, scanning and digitally restoring the film footage frame by frame. ==References in other media== Trumptonshire was used as a hypothetical constituency by the BBC Radio 4 programme More or Less to explain how polling and voting could play out during the 2015 UK general election.

Chosen to commemorate many years of service in North-West India, the markhor being a mountain goat frequenting the Khyber Pass. The horns of a markhor were presented to the squadron in 1964. The squadron motto is Per ardua ad aethera tendo - 'I strive through difficulties to the sky'. ==World War I service== Formed at Gosport on 30 April 1916, barely a month had passed before the unit and its Morane-Saulnier N's were despatched to France. The squadron's initial pilot officers included Harold Balfour and Peter Portal, later Under-Secretary of State for Air and Chief of the Air Staff respectively, while Robert Smith-Barry, later to revolutionise British pilot training, was a flight commander and (from July to December 1916), the squadron's commanding officer. After suffering heavy losses during the Battle of the Somme, the squadron re-equipped with Nieuport Scouts and soon acquired a first-class reputation for itself. On 2 June 1917, Captain W. A. \\"Billy\\" Bishop received the Victoria Cross for his solo attack on a German aerodrome destroying three enemy aircraft in the air and several 'probables' on the ground before returning unhurt in a badly damaged aircraft.

Between the wars, the unit found itself involved in many conflicts along the North West Frontier, including Pink's War, flying Airco DH.9A and Westland Wapiti general-purpose aircraft until Bristol Blenheims arrived six months before the start of World War II. ==World War II== ===Burma and Malaya=== mast-head attack on a Japanese coaster off Akyab, Burma on 11 October 1942 The squadron moved to Burma in February 1941. After the outbreak of war against Japan the squadron fought in Malaya. Two aircraft, L4912 and L4915, remained in Burma. Both were Blenheim Mk 1's and they were destroyed on 20 and 21 January 1942 respectively. L4912 had been damaged beyond repair during a mission in Burma and L4915 was destroyed by enemy bombing.Bowman, p. 121 When the war against Japan broke out on 8 December 1941 No. 60 Squadron was ordered to attack Japanese shipping near Kota Baru. L4913 was shot down by Japanese anti-aircraft fire over the Gulf of Siam while attacking the Awagisan Maru. The pilot, Flight Lieutenant William Bowden, survived the crash and was taken prisoner. He was the first allied airman captured by the Japanese. He was imprisoned at the Zentsuji POW Camp where he remained until late June 1945. He was then transferred to Tokyo No. 12D Camp at Mitsushima where he was eventually freed in September 1945. On 24 December 1941 the remnant of squadrons ground crew and a few of its air crew, having lost all their aircraft in action, sailed from Singapore on the SS Darvel to Burma. They arrived in Rangoon on 1 January 1942 and were joined on 7 January 1942 by No. 113 Squadron and a couple of No. 45 Squadron's Bristol Blenheim Mk IVs. No. 60 Squadron's spare aircrew were assigned to No. 113 Squadron as needed. Because the three squadrons lacked both aircraft and supplies they were seldom able to put more than seven aircraft up at one time, meaning they tended to operate as one. No. 60 Squadron's Blenheim aircrews manned No. 113 Squadron's planes for the first bombing raid on Bangkok and participated again in the second one later in January.Air fighting, Auckland Star, Volume LXXIII, Issue 8, 10 January 1942, page 7. ===India=== Nakajima Ki-43-IIa The squadron had suffered heavily at the hands of the advancing Japanese forces and was declared non-operational and moved to Asansol, India along with No. 45 and 113 Squadrons. Once in India the squadron was re- equipped with Blenheim Mk IV's. While returning to India from Burma after a bombing mission to Sitwe, Burma, on 22 May a Blenheim the squadron was attacked by Nakajima Ki-43 fighters from 64 Sentai. Flight Sergeant Jock McLuckie was one of the Blenheim's gunners. McLuckie shot down Japanese ace Lt Colonel Tateo Kat≈ç who commanded the Sentai and damaged two other Ki-43s. No. 60 Squadron Hurricane and crewmen, possibly in Burma On 30 March 1943 an English-Argentinian from Estancia Dos Hermanos, Los Pinos, Richard (Ricardo) Campbell Lindsell, who had joined the Royal Canadian Air Force, was appointed squadron leader. Lindsell had been educated at Stowe School in England and had been based with No. 139 Squadron RAF.Bowman, pp. 124‚Äì125 In May the squadron was stood down while replacement aircraft were sought. By August the decision had been made to re-equip the squadron with Hawker Hurricane IIc fighter- bombers. Training was commenced in August at Madras and by November the Hurricanes were providing escort duties. In January 1944 the squadron began ground attack missions and troop support against the Japanese in Burma. During one month in 1944 the squadron completed 728 sorties and also received considerable praise for the accuracy of its bombing by allied ground troops. For their efforts and his leadership Lindsell was awarded the DFC. In May 1945 the Hurricanes were replaced by Republic Thunderbolt fighters. ==Post World War II== Andover CC.2 of No. 60 Squadron in 1987 Shortly after the Japanese surrender, the squadron moved to Java and was soon in action against Indonesian rebels. A year later, No. 60 transferred to Singapore prior to converting to Supermarine Spitfire F18s and these were employed in attacks against Communist guerrillas in Malayan Emergency until the arrival of de Havilland Vampires in late 1950 and then de Havilland Venoms in 1955. By the time Gloster MeteorNF.14 night-fighters arrived in October 1959, the unit had returned to RAF Tengah in Singapore. A change followed in July 1961 when Gloster Javelin FAW.9/FAW.9R fighters arrived and these remained until April 1968 when the squadron was disbanded. On 3 September 1964, an Indonesian Air Force C-130 Hercules crashed into the Straits of Malacca while trying to evade interception by a Javelin FAW.9 of No 60 Squadron.Conboy, p. 161. On 3 February 1969, the Royal Air Force Communications Squadron based at RAF Wildenrath in Germany was retitled No. 60 Squadron and the unit found itself flying ancient Percival Pembroke transports until more modern Hawker Siddeley Andover arrived in 1987. Percival Pembroke C.1 No. 60 Squadron's Pembrokes were modified versions of No. 81 Squadron RAF's C(PR).1 photo-reconnaissance Pembrokes. Their use as a Cold War surveillance aircraft was highly classified until the late 1990s. Pembrokes of No. 60 Squadron often flew along the air corridors between West Germany and Berlin, established during the 1948‚Äì49 Berlin Blockade during which the West mounted a massive year-long airlift of supplies to the beleaguered city. While they were widely used as transport aircraft by the RAF, their true function along that particular route was known only to a few within military and intelligence circles. These aircraft were employed for Operation Hallmark, a sensitive intelligence operation in which the Pembrokes were fitted with high-powered reconnaissance cameras to acquire imagery of Soviet and East German military installations and airfields below the tightly controlled air corridors. These were subsequently analyzed by photo intelligence and imagery experts, who recorded any changes in the Warsaw Pact forces facing the West. Alterations in the order of battle, appearance of new equipment and movement of military units were all items of great interest. At the time of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, it was Percival Pembrokes that provided Western analysts with some of the first indications as to where the Soviet ground forces had come from. As with many other Germany- based units, the end of the Cold War saw many moves. No. 60 disbanded at Wildenrath on 1 April 1992, but reformed two months later on 1 June 1992 at RAF Benson in Oxfordshire with Westland Wessex helicopters. This proved a short-lived stay and the squadron was disbanded on 31 March 1997 and the numberplate passed on to the RAF element of the Defence Helicopter Flying School (DHFS) at RAF Shawbury on 1 May 1997. As of 1 April 2018, the squadron began transitioning to the Juno helicopter as part of 9 Regiment Army Air Corps and DHFS in order to provide Advanced and Tactical Rotary Wing training to both pilots and rear crewmen, prior to their postings to Operational Conversion Units. ==See also== *List of Royal Air Force aircraft squadrons ==References== ;Notes ;Bibliography * * * ==Further reading== * * ==External links== *60 Squadron 060 Squadron 060 Squadron Category:Military units and formations established in 1916 Category:Military of Hong Kong under British rule Category:1916 establishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"No. 60 Squadron RAF"},{"id":"11652226","text":"Casey Brixton Weathers (born June 10, 1985) is an American professional baseball coach and former pitcher. He was drafted 8th overall in the 2007 Major League Baseball Draft by the Colorado Rockies.MLB.com 2007 Draft Tracker He played in college for the Vanderbilt Commodores. ==Biography== Weathers attended Laguna Creek High School in Elk Grove, California, and then Sacramento City College where he played in the outfield. During one practice, Weathers claimed he could throw harder than teammate Adam Eisner. This ongoing banter led to Weathers lighting up the radar gun for fun. Despite his wanting to remain an outfielder, once he hit 94 MPH on the gun, he was eventually converted to a pitcher by the coaching staff. Weathers was also teammates with Stephen Bautista, Brian Smith, Shaun Stinson, and Cincinnati Reds pitcher David Hernandez on the semi-pro Elk Grove Leprechauns where he led the league in home runs. After two years at Sacramento City College, Weathers transferred to Vanderbilt University. After his first year at Vanderbilt, Weathers participated in the Alaskan Summer League and was a late addition to the Team USA roster where he joined manager Tim Corbin and teammates David Price and Pedro Alvarez. Weathers enjoyed a successful senior season at Vanderbilt where he led the team in saves and tied for the team lead in wins. He was named a First Team All American and a finalist for National Stopper of the Year. ==Professional career== ===Colorado Rockies=== Weathers was drafted by the Colorado Rockies with the 8th overall pick of the 2007 amateur draft and signed a contract on June 18, 2007, with a $1.8 million signing bonus. On October 31, 2008, Weathers underwent Tommy John surgery to repair his pitching elbow. He was added to the Rockies' 40 man roster after the 2010 season. ===Chicago Cubs=== On December 8, 2011, Weathers was traded along with Ian Stewart to the Chicago Cubs for Tyler Colvin and DJ LeMahieu.

NTE establishes an area (the \\"NTE zone\\") under the torque curve of an engine where emissions must not exceed a specified value for any of the regulated pollutants. The NTE test procedure does not involve a specific driving cycle of any specific length (mileage or time). Rather it involves driving of any type that could occur within the bounds of the NTE control area, including operation under steady-state or transient conditions and under varying ambient conditions. Emissions are averaged over a minimum time of thirty seconds and then compared to the applicable NTE emission limits.Dieselnet, \\"Applicability and Test Cycles\\", Emission Standards ¬ª United States Heavy-Duty Truck and http://www.dieselnet.com/standards/us/hd.html ==Creation of NTE== NTE standards were created by the EPA as a result of a consent decree between the EPA and several major diesel engine manufacturers.

These manufacturers were accused of violating the Clean Air Act by installing devices that defeat emission controls.Mike Osenga, \\"Diesel industry confronts the emission settlement EPA enforcement of the Clean Air Act affects entire diesel engine industry (Industry Overview)\\", Diesel Progress North American Edition, (Published 12 January 1998) http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-53919838.html As part of the resulting consent decree settlement with the EPA, these manufacturers were assessed heavy fines and were subjected to new emissions standards which included NTE. ==Current requirements to achieve engine operation in the \\"NTE Zone\\"== When all of the following conditions are simultaneously met for at least 30 seconds, and engine is considered to be operating in the NTE zone.US EPA Office of Transportation and Air Quality, \\"In-Use Testing Program for Heavy-Duty Diesel Engines and Vehicles, Technical Support Document\\" Document EPA420-R-05-006 (Published June 2005) http://epa.gov/otaq/regs/hd-hwy/inuse/420r05006.pdf #Engine speed must be greater than 15% above idle speed #Engine torque must be greater than or equal to 30% of maximum torque. #Engine power must be greater than or equal to 30% of maximum power. #Vehicle altitude must be less than or equal to . #Ambient temperature must be less than or equal to at sea level to 86 ¬∞F at . #Brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) must be less than or equal to 105% of the minimum BSFC if an engine is not coupled to a multi-speed manual or automatic transmission. #Engine operation must be outside of any manufacturer petitioned exclusion zone. #Engine operation must be outside of any NTE region in which a manufacturer states that less than 5% of in-use time will be spent. #For Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) equipped engines, the intake manifold temperature must be greater than or equal to 86-100 degrees Fahrenheit, depending upon intake manifold pressure. #For EGR-equipped engines, the engine coolant temperature must be greater than or equal to 125-140 degrees Fahrenheit, depending on intake manifold pressure. #Engine after treatment systems' temperature must be greater than or equal to 250 degrees Celsius. ==Visual representations of NTE Zone== Example NTE Control Area for Heavy-Duty Diesel Engine With 100% Operational Engine Speed Less Than 2400 rpm Example NTE Control Area for HeavyDuty Diesel Engine With 100% Operational Engine Speed Greater Than 2400 rpm ===Description=== The NTE test, as defined in CFR 86.1370-2007, establishes an area (NTE control area) under the torque curve of an engine where emissions must not exceed a specified emission cap for a given pollutant. The NTE cap is set at 1.25 times the FTP emission limit as described in the subsection above. For 2005 model year heavy-duty engines, the NTE emission cap for NMHC plus NOx is 1.25 times 2.5 grams per brake horsepower-hour, or 3.125 grams per brake horsepower-hour. The basic NTE control area for diesel engines has three basic boundaries on the engine's torque and speed map. The first is the upper boundary that is represented by an engine's maximum torque at a given speed. The second boundary is 30 percent of maximum torque. Only operation above this boundary is included in the NTE control area. The third boundary is determined based on the lowest engine speed at 50 percent of maximum power and highest engine speed at 70 percent of maximum power. This engine speed is considered the \\"15 percent operational engine speed\\". The fourth boundary is 30% of maximum power State of California AIR RESOURCES BOARD, \\"PUBLIC HEARING TO CONSIDER AMENDMENTS TO ADOPT NOT-TO- EXCEED AND EURO III EUROPEAN STATIONARY CYCLE EMISSION TEST PROCEDURES FOR THE 2005 AND SUBSEQUENT MODEL YEAR HEAVY-DUTY DIESEL ENGINES\\", STAFF REPORT: INITIAL STATEMENT OF REASONS (Date of Release: October 20, 2000) http://www.arb.ca.gov/regact/ntetest/isor.doc ==Controversy and deficiency regarding NTE standards== ===Controversy=== A controversial issue is the applicability of the NTE limits to the real-world driving. In order for NTE standards to apply, the engine needs to remain within the NTE zone (limits include operation at a minimum of 30% of rated power) for at least 30 seconds. Concerns arose that performing this action could prove to be difficult, as each time the driver removes the foot from the accelerator pedal, or shifts gears on vehicles with manual transmission, the engine leaves the NTE zone. In urban or suburban driving, this happens relatively often, to the point that NTE standards are applicable only a very small portion of the operation Working Group On Off- Cycle Emissions, \\"EPA Answers to Questions from March 22nd 2004 NTE Presentation\\". http://www.oica.net/htdocs/WWH/Off%20cycle/7th%20meeting/Informal%20Doc%20No%2014%20-%20EPA%20answers%20to%20NTE%20Questions%20from%206th%E2%80%A6.pdf or, in some cases, not at all. The probability of the engine remaining within the NTE zone for over 30 seconds also decreases with the advent of high-power engines. For example, if the power required to maintain a motorcoach or an over-the-road truck at highway cruising speed is somewhere around , the probability that a engine will consistently operate at loads above 30%, without \\"dips\\" to lower power levels, can be relatively small. These concerns were confirmed by studies carried out by West Virginia University (WVU) under the Consent Decrees. WVU found that \\"remaining for 30 seconds within the NTE zone can be quite difficult. The resulting low NTE availability poses a problem as many measurements within the NTE area have to be rejected along with those from outside the NTE area. The question arises if in this way all real-life emissions are sufficiently 'well reflected' in the NTE test results\\"Study on Emission Control Technology For Heavy Duty Vehicles, \\"In-use Conformity Testing of Emissions Control Devices\\", Study Prepared for the European Commission - DG ENTR (Enterprise), (May 2002) http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/automotive/pagesbackground/emission_control/vol_5-in- use_conformity_testing.pdf A second issue of concern in the same vein is a case when an engine is compliant within the NTE zone, but exhibits elevated NOx at power levels just outside the NTE zone, or at idle. For reasons such as this the Working Group On Off Cycle Emissions is studying whether an extension of the NTE zone is rational as they ponder if there are spots on the engine map (outside of the NTE zone) that have a significant contribution in real life emissions. Their preliminary findings echo those of WVU as they found that the time of engine operation in the NTE zone is rather low.Riemersma, Iddo. \\"WNTE Control Area Evaluation With Respect to The Real-World Engine Operation Envelope\\", Prepared for the 13th meeting of the Working Group on Off-Cycle Emission, (Presented 5‚Äì7 April 2006). http://www.oica.net/htdocs/WWH/Off%20cycle/13th%20meeting/Informal%20Doc%20No%20%2042%20-%20Presentatie%20OCE- NTE%20meeting%20final.pdf ===EPA admitted deficiencies=== According to the US EPA there are technical limitations of NTE under limited operating conditions which have caused the EPA to \\"carve-out\\" (see graphs above) certain portions of the NTE zone to allow for these deficiencies.

Each of those lawsuits challenged the legality and technological feasibility of certain engine emission control standards in EPA regulations now referred to as NTE requirements. In their challenge, EMA stated that to determine whether an engine meets a primary emission standard, engines are tested and assessed using a standardized 20-minute emissions laboratory test known as the Federal Test Procedure. The NTE, by contrast, has no specified test procedure and potentially could apply over an almost infinite number of test conditions. This, in the manufacturers' view, made it virtually impossible to ensure total compliance with the NTE‚Äîsince there is no real or practical way to test an engine under all conceivable conditions‚Äîand so made the NTE both unlawful (the CAA authorizes EPA to adopt engine standards AND accompanying test procedures) and technically infeasible.Engine Manufacturers Association,\\"Questions and Answers Regarding the EMA-EPA Heavy- duty NTE Settlement\\", (June 11, 2003)http://www.enginemanufacturers.org/admin/library/upload/371.pdf ===Settlement=== On June 3, 2003, the parties finalized a settlement of their disputes pertaining to the NTE standards. The parties agreed upon a detailed outline for a future regulation that would require a manufacturer-run heavy- duty in-use NTE testing (\\"HDIUT\\") program for diesel-fueled engines and vehicles. One section of the outline stated: > The NTE Threshold will be the NTE standard, including the margins built into > the existing regulations, plus additional margin to account for in-use > measurement accuracy.

Time-consuming and expensive laboratory assessments of engines could then give way to real-world, real-time emissions assessments that efficiently provides more relevant data. Basically, the HDIUT is an industry agreed to manufacturer run, in-use, on-road testing program. It builds upon the original NTE standard. It is designed to focus on compliance in the real world, and relies on emissions testing, utilizing Portable Emissions Measurement Systems (PEMS) with NOx, HC, CO and PM being the pollutants to be measured.Spears, Matt (of the USEPA), \\"U.S. EPA PEMS Measurement Allowance Program\\", Presentation for 2007 JRC Conference on Mar 19, 2007. http://transportenv07.jrc.it/pdf/C/C_2_20_Spears_M_US%20Measurement%20Allowance%20Program.pdf Measurement Accuracy Margins are being established to account for the emissions measurement variability associated with the PEMS in- use.Shimpi,Shirish A.

Parker said he'd look to work in the health industry, potentially serving as a rehab coordinator for players returning from injury. ==Pitching style== Parker threw five pitches. His main pitch was a four-seam fastball thrown 92‚Äì95 mph that he threw for about half of his pitches. He also had a two-seam fastball at 90‚Äì94. His main off-speed pitch was a changeup in the low 80s, and he also had a slider and occasional curveball. The two-seamer and changeup were used primarily on left-handed hitters, as their movement tailed away toward the outside corner. Likewise, Parker did not use his two-seamer to right-handers at all, and he only employed his slider against right-handers. Parker used his changeup heavily in 2-strike counts. Parker described his pitching approach as such: > I'm aggressive. I like to attack the zone, down ...

She saw service during World War II. Transferred to the United States Coast Guard after the war, she was in commission as the Coast Guard cutter USCGC Dexter (WAGC-385), later WAVP-385 and WHEC-385, from 1946 to 1952 and from 1958 to 1968. ==Construction and commissioning== Biscayne was laid down on 27 October 1939 at Puget Sound Navy Yard in Bremerton, Washington. She was launched on 23 May 1941, sponsored by Mrs. A. M. Charleton, and commissioned on 3 July 1941 with Lieutenant Commander C. C. Champion, Jr., in command. == United States Navy service == === World War II === ====Seaplane tender operations==== Following her shakedown cruise, Biscayne joined the Atlantic Fleet and operated out of Boston, Massachusetts, on patrol and plane guard missions from 7 December 1941 until 27 May 1942. For the next four months she served as a seaplane tender and communications ship in Newfoundland and Greenland waters. Biscayne departed Norfolk, Virginia, on 17 October 1942 and, after a short stop at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, moved to Freetown, Sierra Leone, with Patrol Squadron 92 (VP-92), arriving on 2 November 1942. Biscayne moved to Casablanca, French Morocco, on 18 November 1942 and remained there until 25 April 1943 supporting patrol squadrons. ====Amphibious force flagship operations in the Mediterranean==== Biscayne arrived at Mers-el-Kebir, Algeria, on 26 April 1943 and became the flagship of Rear Admiral Richard Lansing Conolly, Commander, Landing Craft and Bases, Northwest African Waters. While at Mers-el-Kebir she was fitted out as an amphibious force flagship by repair ship between 2 and 31 May 1943, although she retained her seaplane tender classification and AVP-11 designation for the time being. In May 1943, Biscayne shifted her moorings to Bizerte, Tunisia. Departing Bizerte on 10 July 1943, Biscayne served as flagship of the Joss (Licata) Force in Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily. She remained off Sicily until 22 July 1943 and then returned to Bizerte. Biscayne as an amphibious force flagship off Anzio on 21 January 1944 or 22 January 1944 during Operation Shingle. A PT boat is alongside her.Beginning on 9 September 1943, Biscayne took part in Operation Avalanche, the Allied landings at Salerno, Italy, as flagship for Vice Admiral H. Kent Hewitt and Rear Admiral Conolly. On board the ship during the Anzio invasion was famed journalist Ernie Pyle. According to Lt. Earl V. Avery, Admiral Connolly was nicknamed \\"too close Connolly\\" by the crew. One time the admiral wanted to get a closer look at the beach at night and search lights lit them up like a Christmas tree,\\", according to Avery. Pyle wrote in his book that a young naval Lieutenant (Avery) remarked \\"Oh my God, my kids will be orphans.\\" However, one by one the lights were turned off. They guessed they were Italian and didn't want to draw their fire. While off Salerno, she escaped unscathed from frequent air and gunfire attacks. On 12 September 1943, she sent a fire and rescue team on board the British ammunition ship Lyminge and saved that vessel and her cargo of ammunition from destruction. Biscayne also served as a temporary hospital ship while off Salerno. Biscayne retired to Bizerte on 11 October 1943. On 7 November 1943, Biscayne became the flagship of Rear Admiral F. J. Lowry, Commander, 8th Amphibious Force. Sailing for Italy once again, she served as flagship during Operation Shingle, the Allied landings at Anzio, from 22 January 1944 to 2 February 1944. Biscayne became flagship of Rear Admiral B. J. Rodgers, Commander, Amphibious Group 2, 8th Amphibious Force, in May 1944. Between 15 August 1944 and 16 September 1944, she took part in Operation Dragoon, the Allied invasion of southern France. On 10 October 1944, Biscayne was officially reclassified as a miscellaneous flagship and redesignated AGC-18. ====Amphibious force flagship operations in the Pacific Theater==== Biscayne left the Mediterranean on 12 October 1944 bound for Boston, and then steamed to the Pacific Ocean. She arrived at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 9 January 1945 and became flagship of Captain Frederick Moosbrugger, Commander, Destroyer Squadron 63. Biscayne took part in the invasion of Iwo Jima from 19 February 1945 to 4 March 1945 as flagship of the transport screen. she carried out similar duties during Operation Iceberg, the landings on Kerama Retto on 26 March 1945 and on Okinawa on 1 April 1945. She remained off Okinawa, supporting U.S. operations during and after the Okinawa campaign, until 1 July 1945, during which time she served as flagship for the occupation of Iheya and Aguni Islands between 3 June 1945 and 9 June 1945. After her tour at Okinawa, Biscayne retired to Leyte in the Philippine Islands, and remained in the Philippines through the end of World War II, which concluded with the cessation of hostilities with Japan on 15 August 1945. ====Honors and awards==== Biscayne received six battle stars for her World War II service. 23 June 1950 From: Chief of Naval Personnel Addressed to all personnel/sailors Subject: Navy Unit Commendation Ribbon Bar The Secretary of the Navy has awarded the U.S.S. Biscayne the Navy Unit Commendation for meritorious service in action against enemy aircraft, shore batteries, surface forces and mines in both the European and Pacific Theaters of Operation. ===Post-World War II=== Biscayne departed the Philippines on 8 September 1945 to support the occupation of Korea. She remained on occupation duty in Korean and Chinese waters until 30 October 1945, when she left for the United States. Biscayne arrived at San Diego, California, on 21 December 1945 and at Portland, Maine, on 7 January 1946. She then moved to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, for use as quarters for the academys aviation instruction staff. ===Decommissioning=== Biscayne was decommissioned on 29 June 1946. == United States Coast Guard service == commissioning in 1946 and the Coast Guard's 1967 adoption of the \\"racing stripe\\" markings on its ships. Barnegat-class ships were very reliable and seaworthy and had good habitability, and the United States Coast Guard viewed them as ideal for ocean station duty, in which they would perform weather reporting and search-and- rescue tasks, once they were modified by having a balloon shelter added aft and having oceanographic equipment, an oceanographic winch, and a hydrographic winch installed. After World War II, the Navy transferred 18 of the ships to the Coast Guard, in which they were known as the Casco-class cutters. The Navy transferred Biscayne to the Coast Guard on either 10 July 1946,Per NavSource.org at http://www.navsource.org/archives/10/01/0118.htm 19 July 1946,Per the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships at http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/b6/biscayne-i.htm or 29 July 1946.Per the United States Coast Guard Historian's Office at http://www.uscg.mil/history/webcutters/Dexter1946.asp at the Coast Guard Yard at Curtis Bay at Baltimore, Maryland. After she underwent conversion for service as a weather reporting ship, the Coast Guard commissioned her as USCGC Dexter (WAGC-18) - the fourth ship of the U.S. Coast Guard or its predecessor, the United States Revenue Cutter Service, to bear the name - on 20 September 1946NavSource.org at http://www.navsource.org/archives/10/01/0118.htm claims the commissioning date was 8 June 1949, but the almost three-year lag between acquisition and commissioning this requires would be aberrant for this class of ships and contradicts the more likely 20 September 1946 date given by the United States Coast Guard Historian's Office at http://www.uscg.mil/history/webcutters/Dexter1946.asp with Commander A. G. Morrill, USCG, in command. ===Atlantic service 1946‚Äì1952=== Dexter was stationed at Boston, Massachusetts, which would remain her home port until December 1952, and was redesignated WAVP-385 at some point during her time there. Her primary duty was to serve on ocean stations in the Atlantic Ocean to gather meteorological data. While on duty in one of these stations, she was required to patrol a 210-square-mile (544-square-kilometer) area for three weeks at a time, leaving the area only when physically relieved by another Coast Guard cutter or in the case of a dire emergency. While on station, she acted as an aircraft check point at the point of no return, a relay point for messages from ships and aircraft, as a source of the latest weather information for passing aircraft, as a floating oceanographic laboratory, and as a search-and-rescue ship for downed aircraft and vessels in distress, and engaged in law enforcement operations. She arrived at Boston to assume her duties on 17 October 1946. On 30 November 1946, Dexter was at Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland, Canada, underway to her first ocean station duty at Ocean Station Charlie. By 28 December 1946 she was back in Boston. For the next few months, she was on Ocean Station Charlie and Ocean Station Alfa, taking time out in October 1947 for underway training near Berkley Station at Norfolk, Virginia. Dexter served on Ocean Station Able from 30 October 1947 to 10 December 1947. While on that duty, she responded to a request for assistance by the merchant ship SS Louisburg, which was flooding, on 4 November 1947. Dexter transferred a life raft and damage control timbers to Louisburg and escorted her safely to St. John's, Newfoundland. Dexter then returned to Ocean Station Able. On 4 November 1948, while underway from Ocean Station Alfa, Dexter assisted the fishing vessel Pan Pades Andros, which was disabled about southeast of Sable Island. Following this assistance case, Dexter was put into repair status until 12 February 1949, when repairs were completed and she was in port on standby. On 14 February 1949, Dexter relieved the Coast Guard cutter USCGC Winnebago (WPG-40) from duty on Ocean Station Delta, and in turn was relieved by the Coast Guard cutter USCGC Androscoggin (WPG-68). On 27 April 1949 she relieved the Coast Guard cutter USCGC Ingham (WPG-35) on Ocean Station Echo and on 29 April 1949 was underway to Bermuda with an injured crew member. She resumed station on 3 May 1949. On 21 May 1949 she assisted the fishing vessel Sea Hawk and on 22 May 1949 turned Sea Hawk over to the Coast Guard cutter USCGC Legare (WSC-144) for further assistance. She then returned to Boston for repairs. On 30 July 1949, Dexter assisted the U.S. Navy destroyer USS Livermore (DD-429) while at sea. On 9 September 1949, she was forced to proceed south of Sable Island to avoid the center of a hurricane. She proceeded on to Ocean Station Bravo and relieved Coast Guard cutter USCGC Humboldt (WAVP-372) on 12 September 1949. On 30 September 1949, she was relieved on Ocean Station Bravo by the Canadian Coast Guard ship CGS St. Stephen. In October 1949, she participated in gunnery exercises in the Newport, Rhode Island, area. For the next few months, Dexter had her regular ocean station patrols with nothing unusual happening until 7 August 1950, when she went off Ocean Station Charlie temporarily to assist the merchant ship SS Belfrey, and proceeded to escort her toward St. John's, Newfoundland, until 11 August 1950, when she was relieved of the escort duty by Coast Guard cutter USCGC Spencer (WPG-36) and returned to Ocean Station Charlie. On 26 November 1950 she assisted U.S. Navy destroyer escort USS Tweedy (DE-532), which was adrift off Cape Cod, Massachusetts. On 2 January 1951 Dexter departed Boston en route Ocean Station Hotel. In April 1951 she was temporarily off Ocean Station Echo for two days, while investigating a reported depth charge in the area. On 11 June 1951 she temporarily departed Ocean Station Delta on a distress-response mission and reoccupied the station on 14 June 1951. During November 1951, she was forced to leave Ocean Station Alfa for a short while due to an urgent medical case. On 19 February 1952, Dexter left Ocean Station Hotel to assist the merchant ship SS Helen Stevenson, which had cracked across the main deck port and starboard at the hatch. She escorted Helen Stevenson to a point less than 10 nautical miles (18.5 kilometers) east of St. George's, Bermuda, and then returned to station. On 18 October 1952, she departed Ocean Station Alfa and proceeded to Boston. On 8 November 1952, she departed Boston for the Coast Guard Yard at Curtis Bay, Maryland, arriving there on 9 November 1952. On 17 December 1952, Dexter was decommissioned at the Coast Guard Yard and placed in storage there. In 1957 she was re-engined with four new Fairbanks Morse diesel engines.Conways All the Worlds Fighting Ships 1947-1982, p. 256. ===Pacific service 1958‚Äì1968=== Dexter was recommissioned on 30 June 1958 and assigned to a new home port, Alameda, California. She departed Curtis Bay on 14 July 1958 under the command of Commander Bainbridge Leland, USCG. USCGC Dexter (WAVP-385) arriving in San Francisco Bay on 11 August 1958 en route her new home port at Alameda, California.Dexter arrived at Alameda on 11 August 1958. She assumed duty as the United States West Coast training ship for the United States Coast Guard Reserve training component. She provided training at sea for Coast Guard Reserve recruits undergoing training at Alameda Training Station. Manned by a complement of 83‚Äîeight officers, 10 chief petty officers, and 65 other enlisted men‚Äîto 85, Dexter had facilities for handling over 100 recruits at a time. Recruits spent approximately three months aboard Dexter for indoctrination and one extended cruise beyond the waters of San Francisco Bay. Dexter also made cruises to various ports on the U.S. West Coast, as well as to British Columbia in Canada, Hawaii, Alaska, and Mexico, in connection with training activities. Dexter also participated as a search-and-rescue patrol vessel for various sailing races and regattas, including the September 1958 America's Cup Race at Newport, Rhode Island, and the Transpacific Yacht Races from Los Angeles, California, to Honolulu, Hawaii, of 1959, 1961, and 1965. Dexter also conducted search and rescue operations. On 18 July 1959, she towed the disabled fishing vessel Cloud Nine until relieved by the Coast Guard buoy tender USCGC Blackhaw (WLB-390). On 5 February 1965, she unsuccessfully searched for an F-4B Phantom jet fighter aircraft near San Clemente Island. In early February 1966, she towed the disabled sloop Allegro from south-southwest of San Diego, California, to Asuncion Bay. Dexter was reclassified as a high endurance cutter and redesignated WHEC-385 on 1 May 1966. ===Decommissioning and disposal=== On 18 January 1968, the Coast Guard decommissioned Dexter. She was transferred to the U.S. Navy on 9 July 1968 and sunk as a target later that year. == See also == * List of United States Navy ships == References == * *Department of the Navy: Naval Historical Center: Online Library of Selected Images: U.S. Navy Ships: USS Biscayne (AVP-11, later AGC-18), 1941-1946 * NavSource Online Amphibious Photo Archive - AVP-11 / AGC-18 Biscayne - WAGC-16 / WAVP / WHEC-385 Dexter *United States Coast Guard Historians Office: Dexter, 1946 ex-USS Biscayne WAGC-18; WAVP / WHEC-385 Radio call sign: NODC *United States Coast Guard Historian's Office: Mackinac, 1949 WHEC-371 * Chesneau, Roger.

The three-roll mill has proven to be the most successful of the range of roll mills which saw extensive development in the 19th century. These included the single-roll mill and the five-roll mill. The single-roll mill works by material passing between the roll and a fixed bar pressing against the roll. The five-roll mill incorporates four successively smaller in-running nips and hence, compared to the three-roll mill, allows the use of larger agglomerates as part of the input material- but is correspondingly more complicated and expensive. == Operation of a three roll mill == Image:threerollmill.jpg The three adjacent rolls of a three roll mill (called the feed roll, centre roll and apron roll) rotate at progressively higher speeds. Material, usually in the form of paste, is fed between the feed roll and the center roll. Due to the narrowing space between the rolls, most of the paste initially remains in the feed region. The part that makes it through the first in-running nip experiences very high shear force due to the different rotation speeds of the two rolls. Upon exiting, the material that remains on the center roll moves through the second nip between the center roll and apron roll. This subjects it to an even higher shear force, due to the higher speed of the apron roll and typically, a smaller gap than between the feed and centre rolls. A knife blade then scrapes the processed material off the apron roll and the paste rolls down the apron. This milling cycle can be repeated several times to maximize dispersion. The gaps between the rolls can be mechanically or hydraulically adjusted and maintained. Typically, the gap distance is far greater than the particle size. In some operations, the gap distance is gradually decreased to achieve the desired level of dispersion. The rollers are normally internally water-cooled. == Application == Three roll mills are widely used to mix printing inks, electronic thick film inks, high performance ceramics, cosmetics, plastisols, carbon/graphite, paints, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, glass coatings, dental composites, pigment, coatings, adhesives, sealants, and foods. With the recent development in technology, they are also utilized in the production of cable cover, electronics, soap, and artificial plastics. Small bench models are used for bench-top development work, laboratory work, and low volume production. Larger bench and floor models are built to meet different production needs from pilot plants to large volume productions. Particular advantages of this process are that it allows high-viscosity pastes to be milled, and that the high surface contact with the cooled rollers allow the temperature to remain low despite the high amount of dispersion work being put in. A notable disadvantage is that the large open area of paste on the rollers causes loss of volatiles. == References == Category:Industrial machinery ","title":"Three roll mill"},{"id":"11652484","text":"Crosshill is a village in Fife, Scotland, located just to the south of the village of Lochore, and to the east of Loch Ore. ==History== Crosshill was the scene of a murder by one of Scotland's youngest murderers.

The organization has received a Three-Star Charity rating from Charity Navigator. Considered a model for urban park management worldwide, the Parks Conservancy's work is made possible through the support of its members and donors, contributions from foundations, businesses, public agencies, and individuals; as well as earned income from the operation of park stores, cafes, and tours. Parks Conservancy-funded projects are visible across the parks' 80,000 acres as part of site transformations, trail improvements, habitat restoration, research and conservation, volunteer and youth engagement, and interpretive and educational programs. The Parks Conservancy works closely with several partners including the National Park Service (NPS) and the Presidio Trust to accomplish its mission to preserve the Golden Gate National Parks, enhance the experience of park visitors, and build a community dedicated to conserving the parks for the future. The Parks Conservancy is the official support organization for the Golden Gate National Recreation area, and is one of more than 70 such nonprofit organizations working with national parks across the U.S. Recent projects include the Tamalpais Lands Collaborative (TLC), a new public-private partnership that will bring together the resources, skills, and philanthropy of the National Park Service, California State Parks, Marin Municipal Water District, Marin County Parks, and the Parks Conservancy to support conservation, stewardship, and public enjoyment of the Mount Tamalpais region in Marin County, California. The Parks Conservancy is also collaborating with the Presidio Trust and the NPS on the New Presidio Parklands Project,http://newpresidioparklands.org/ that will create 10 acres of new national parkland in the Presidio of San Francisco, bridging the new Presidio Parkway tunnel that connects the Golden Gate Bridge to the city street grid. ==Notable Programs== The Parks Conservancy has overseen several notable programs, sites, and campaigns, including Alcatraz, Crissy Field, Muir Woods, and the Golden Gate Bridge 75th Anniversary ===Alcatraz=== Opened to the public in 1973 by the National Park Service, Alcatraz Island is a significant historical site, and one of the most popular tourist destinations in Northern California with some 1.4 annual visitors. In partnership with the National Park Service, the Parks Conservancy has overseen the $3.5 million revitalization of the island, which has included the restoration of its gardens, the enhancement of visitor amenities and experiences, and the addition of a museum store. Formerly home to the maximum-security prison, the island is located in San Francisco Bay; visitors take a ferry from Pier 33 in San Francisco to reach it. Once there, the Parks Conservancy now offers popular tours, attractions, and merchandise for visitors. Additionally, in partnership the National Park Service, the Parks Conservancy coordinates volunteer programs to ensure the island's restored gardens and wildlife habitats, home to some 20,000 sea birds, are carefully protected. Among the most popular attractions for visitors is the \\"Doing Time\\" audio tour, offered in eleven languages, which provides first-person accounts and interviews with people who experienced Alcatraz, including former corrections officers and inmates. There are also several walking tours including the Alcatraz Night and Historic Gardens tours; the proceeds from these tours are used for restoring and preserving the Golden Gate National Parks and the island itself. The island also has a cellhouse museum store, which showcases genuine items (such as real handcuffs) used in the prison and \\"Escape from Alcatraz\\" movie, based on the real 1962 inmate break out. There is a sizable 180-seat theater on Alcatraz that shows a film on the island's complex history. Through the Parks Conservancy's Art in the Parks program, the island hosted \\"@Large: Ai Weiwei on Alcatraz,\\" an exhibition from September 2014 to April 2015 showcasing installations by Ai Weiwei, the Chinese artist and political activist. ===Art in the Parks=== Since 2006, the Parks Conservancy, National Park Service, Presidio Trust, and the Headlands Center for the Arts have brought several art installations to the Golden Gate National Parks. Additional partners have included the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and We Players, among others. The Art in the Parks program includes the 2014-2015 exhibition \\"@Large: Ai Weiwei on Alcatraz,\\" and environmental sculptural works by Andy Goldsworthy. Goldsworthy's 2014 piece, \\"Earth Wall,\\" was built into the historic Officers' Club located in the Presidio; the piece was unveiled as a part of the Presidio's 20th anniversary projects. Ai Weiwei's @Large featured seven installations across Alcatraz, including 176 portraits of various political exiles and prisoners of conscience, individuals including Edward Snowden, Nelson Mandela, and Martin Luther King Jr. The portraits were made of 1.2 million pieces of Legos and were on display in areas that were once the dining hall, laundry building, and A Block cells of the Island. The artist organized the show without ever visiting the site since the Chinese government restricts his travel. The installation was a joint commission with the For-Site Foundation, a nonprofit with a mission to support \\"art about place.\\" Past Art in the Parks projects include large-scale sculptures from Mark di Suvero at Crissy Field; podcasts and audio tours from Jeannene Przyblyski, and a 172-foot brush sculpture from Dee Hibbert Jones. ===Crissy Field=== Described as offering \\"one of the great vistas anywhere,\\" and located along a 1.3-mile marsh area next to the Presidio of San Francisco, Crissy Field has longstanding ties to the U.S. military, and underwent an extensive renovation before reopening in 2001. Due to its large, flat, grassy landscape, the site was turned into an airfield and became the home of significant aviation research and development between World War I and II. The site also housed a top-secret Military Intelligence Service Language School. When the military left after the war, it fell into relative disrepair until the National Park Service and Parks Conservancy oversaw its $34 million restoration, completed in 2001, which included a 28-acre re-creation airfield, as a part of the efforts to reinvigorate the Presidio as a national park. The restoration was made possible through several significant donations, including one in the amount of $13.5 million from the Evelyn and Walter Haas, Jr. Fund. Hargreaves Associates oversaw the project, and redesigned the site to complement the strong winds that shape the existing landscape. The Crissy Field Center, a partnership of the Parks Conservancy, National Park Service, and Presidio Trust, focuses on community engagement; it has provided programs to more than 800,000 students and adults since opening, including some 25,000 schoolchildren. Many of its programs are designated specifically for low- income youths. The restoration has been praised both for its focus on restoring wildlife habitat, and its positive impact for the surrounding community and visitors, with more than one million visitors annually. ===Golden Gate Bridge 75th Anniversary=== The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge that connects San Francisco and Marin County. For the bridge's 75th anniversary in 2012, the Parks Conservancy, in partnership with the National Park Service and the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District, oversaw several celebratory projects to commemorate its opening. These organizations partnered with companies such as the San Francisco Chronicle and Twitter, as well as Genentech and Wells Fargo to commemorate the event. Steering committee members included notable Bay Area leaders and residents, while members of the Honorary Committee included Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Square, Inc.; Chip Bergh, the CEO of Levi Strauss & Co.; and Frank Vega, former publisher of the San Francisco Chronicle. Events for the 75th anniversary included a large fireworks display, an exhibition at Fort Point known as \\"International Orange,\\" dancing and music, and a fair to explore sustainability. The Festival events took place on May 27, 2012. The ongoing \\"Band of Bridges\\" project won Travel + Leisure's Social Media in Travel + Tourism (SMITTY) award. This yearlong campaign connected some 2,122 participants from around the world to the 75th anniversary tribute; the \\"social experiment\\" created thousands of virtual bridges. ===Institute at the Golden Gate=== Located in Fort Baker on the Marin side of the Golden Gate Bridge, the Institute at the Golden Gate is a program of the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy in partnership with the NPS. It conducts research and offers lectures and community activities designed to connect residents to environmental issues related to parks including climate change, national food policy, and more. The Institute has partnered with organizations such as the CDC and the National Recreation and Park Association. Many of its events take place at Cavallo Point, the Lodge at the Golden Gate, which has 14,000 square feet of space for meetings and events, and is a LEED certified building. It has won numerous awards for its design. Past events at the Institute have included their 2011 and 2012 signature Turning the Tide conference, and a 2013 conference, Parks: The New Climate Classroom, which featured filmmakers, academics, and journalists who explored issues of sustainability. In the case of the new food policy program for national parks, the Institute worked with organizations including the Let's Move! initiative to establish better food standards for the 35 million annual meals served at national parks; it now is seeking to implement those ideas on an even larger scale. A 2013 collaboration between numerous agencies led to \\"Healthy Parks, Healthy People: Bay Area,\\" focused on offering low-cost activities for individuals who are at a high risk for various health problems. ===Lands End=== In 2012, the Parks Conservancy and National Park Service oversaw the opening of a new visitor center at Lands End, the Lands End Lookout. The Lookout sits in the northwestern area of San Francisco near the Sutro Baths; it is roughly 4,000 square feet, and was built in conjunction with a series of additional improvements to the area that started in 2011. The Horace W. Goldsmith Foundation, as well as the Richard and Rhoda Goldman Fund, provided funding for the project. Lands End is a historic site where the Yelamu tribe of Ohlone Native Americans resided. San Francisco entrepreneur Adolph Sutro supported the area's development in the late 19th century, including a Cliff House Railroad, which attracted visitors. Now, the Lands End Lookout offers visitors insight into the natural, cultural, and historic resources of the area, as well as highlighting the building's sustainable design. The site relies on volunteers to restore and maintain native wildlife habitat and the California Coastal Trail. ===Mount Tamalpais=== Located in Marin County, Mount Tamalpais (Mt. Tam) encompasses more than 10 square miles of public land and open space, and is the primary source of drinking water for 75% of Marin's population. Established in 2014, the Tamalpais Lands Collaborative (TLC) combines the resources, skills, and expertise of the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, National Park Service, Marin Municipal Water District (MMWD), California State Parks, and Marin County Parks to preserve these protected public lands. In November 2014, the TLC launched the One Tam Initiative to help raise awareness of the preservation efforts needed to secure Mt. Tam's future. The efforts include work to promote education, and philanthropy, and to increase support from volunteers. Specifically, efforts to maintain Mt. Tam are designed to combat the effects of climate change, habitat and biodiversity loss, forest pathogens, and inadequate opportunities for stewardship and learning. Additionally, events and trails on the site have been at or over capacity, prompting the expansion of offerings. The Cataract Trail has as many as 400 visitors each hour during wet season, for instance. Preservation and community outreach projects include the Rare Plant Program, Cataract Trail Restoration, and youth programs designed to facilitate long-term commitment to the mountain. ===Muir Woods=== Located in southwest Marin County, this grove of coast redwoods was declared a national monument in 1908 by President Theodore Roosevelt. It is named for the famous naturalist and founder of the Sierra Club, John Muir, and was established after the sudden influx of people into the San Francisco region during the California Gold Rush, prompting efforts to preserve the region's natural habitat. Today, the park is the site of major conservation efforts‚Äîit is home to coho salmon and steelhead trout, both of which are threatened species, as well as the northern spotted owl. The Parks Conservancy operates a bookstore at Muir Woods, and supports staff who welcome visitors and provide orientation and interpretation of the national monument. Muir Woods are perhaps best known for their stunning historic redwoods and paths; these trees are anywhere from 400 to 800 years old. The park has become increasingly popular over the past several years and visitors are encouraged to take public transportation when visiting since parking is limited. It has also become something of a retreat for residents and visitors, and has been referenced for its historical beauty by writers such as Alan Garner. ===Presidio of San Francisco=== The Presidio of San Francisco is a 1,491-acre national park at the northern edge of the San Francisco Peninsula. The Army transferred the land to the NPS in 1994, and the Presidio Trust was established to manage the parcel in 1996. A plan to renovate a 13-acre area that will replace the elevated Doyle Drive highway and connect the Presidio's historic core with the San Francisco Bay waterfront, known as the New Presidio Parklands Project, is also currently underway. The project is a joint operation between the Presidio Trust, the National Park Service, and the Parks Conservancy. It calls for 10 acres of landscaping that will run above road tunnels, a plaza for the Presidio Visitor Center, and a \\"Learning Landscape\\" that will incorporate the new campus for Crissy Field Center. In 2014, New York's James Corner Field Operations, which was the project lead for New York's highly successful High Line elevated park, was chosen to oversee the design. The San Francisco-based architecture firm EHDD will also work on the project. There are currently several variations on what form the final project will take, and the firm and partners are seeking community input to choose a direction. In 2012 the Presidio Trust issued a Request for Concept Proposals for transforming the site of the former Commissary (currently home to the Sports Basement) at mid-Crissy Field into a \\"cultural institution.\\" The finalists in the RFP process were the Lucas Cultural Arts Museum (proposed by filmmaker George Lucas), The Bridge/Sustainability Institute (Chora Group/WRNS), and the Presidio Exchange (Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy). In February 2014, the Presidio Trust Board of Directors ultimately decided not to pursue any of the three options for the site. The transformation of the Presidio into a national park has been substantially boosted by the Evelyn and Walter Haas, Jr. Fund, which made a historic gift of $15 million in 2007 to create a world-class network of trails, bikeways, and overlooks, and dramatically expand and renovate the Rob Hill Campground. Camping at the Presidio programs use the site to introduce underserved youth to nature and the outdoors. ==See also== *Golden Gate Raptor Observatory *Redwood Creek Native Plant Nursery ==References== Category:Golden Gate National Recreation Area Category:Organizations based in San Francisco ","title":"Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy"},{"id":"11652561","text":"Mamidi Appalasuri (died 1997) was an Indian communist leader.

It is situated to the north of the town centre and consists predominantly of council housing constructed during the 1920s. ==History== It was West Bromwich's first council housing development when the first houses were built there in 1920. A small number of houses on the southern side of the estate were demolished during the 1970s to make way for a dual carriageway that by-passed West Bromwich town centre, though a direct road link between the estate and the town centre does still exist. Several houses on Tantany were damaged in air raids during the Second World War, and were rebuilt afterwards. A further few houses were demolished during the 1990s and replaced by new private homes, but the bulk of the pre- war housing is still in existence. When a number of homes on the nearby Hateley Heath estate were demolished, a number of families were moved to Tantany. ==Facilities== It is served by community facilities including West Bromwich Baptist Church.West Bromwich Baptist Church official website == References == Category:Areas of Sandwell Category:West Bromwich ","title":"Tantany"},{"id":"11652627","text":"Loretto Academy is a private Roman Catholic school in El Paso, Texas.

Retrieved on May 24, 2011. ==Background== The Sisters of Loretto had previously established several schools in Las Cruces and El Paso. In the early 1920s, Mother M. Praxedes Carty of the Sisters of Loretto came to El Paso to establish a new school. On March 20, 1922, she purchased 19 acres of land in the Austin Terrace area, which was considered a bad place to put the school. The area was open desert and was accessible by streetcar. For the time period, it was considered to be a long distance from the downtown area. Because of the location, people were unsure if parents would send their children to the school. People began to call the project \\"Praxedes' Folly.\\" The building was designed by Trost & Trost. Gustavus A. Trost was friends with Mother Praxedes and may have done most of the primary architectural drawings. The buildings were \\"designed to face Mexico\\" in a welcoming gesture for all people to join the community. They were built using stuccoed brick and red Spanish tile on the roof. The first building was started in the fall of 1922. The cornerstone for the chapel was laid down on March 20, 1924. The entire campus was not complete until the 1930s. However, the first school building was ready in 1923. Loretto Academy in El Paso opened on September 11, 1923 with 186 students, of which 20 lived at the school as boarders. In 1928, the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools admitted Loretto as a member. The boarding school closed in 1975. Students from Ciudad Juarez also attend the school. As of the early 1990s the school had over 900 students. == Notable attendees == * Veronica Escobar. * Mar√≠a Guillermina Valdes Villalva. == Notable faculty == * Jacqueline Grennan Wexler. ==Notes and references== ==External links== * School Website * \\"Sisters of Loretto Have Long Tradition in Southwest\\".

The polymerization reaction used for their synthesis is shown on top. Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs, also called nano- graphene ribbons or nano-graphite ribbons) are strips of graphene with width less than 50 nm. Graphene ribbons were introduced as a theoretical model by Mitsutaka Fujita and coauthors to examine the edge and nanoscale size effect in graphene. == Production == === Nanotomy === Large quantities of width- controlled GNRs can be produced via graphite nanotomy, where applying a sharp diamond knife on graphite produces graphite nanoblocks, which can then be exfoliated to produce GNRs. GNRs can also be produced by \\"unzipping\\" or axially cutting nanotubes. In one such method multi-walled carbon nanotubes were unzipped in solution by action of potassium permanganate and sulfuric acid. In another method GNRs were produced by plasma etching of nanotubes partly embedded in a polymer film. More recently, graphene nanoribbons were grown onto silicon carbide (SiC) substrates using ion implantation followed by vacuum or laser annealing. The latter technique allows any pattern to be written on SiC substrates with 5 nm precision. === Epitaxy === GNRs were grown on the edges of three-dimensional structures etched into silicon carbide wafers. When the wafers are heated to approximately , silicon is preferentially driven off along the edges, forming nanoribbons whose structure is determined by the pattern of the three-dimensional surface. The ribbons had perfectly smooth edges, annealed by the fabrication process. Electron mobility measurements surpassing one million correspond to a sheet resistance of one ohm per square‚Äî two orders of magnitude lower than in two-dimensional graphene. === Chemical vapor deposition === Nanoribbons narrower than 10 nm grown on a germanium wafer act like semiconductors, exhibiting a band gap. Inside a reaction chamber, using chemical vapor deposition, methane is used to deposit hydrocarbons on the wafer surface, where they react with each other to produce long, smooth-edged ribbons. The ribbons were used to create prototype transistors. At a very slow growth rate, the graphene crystals naturally grow into long nanoribbons on a specific germanium crystal facet. By controlling the growth rate and growth time, the researchers achieved control over the nanoribbon width. Recently, researchers from SIMIT (Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences) reported on a strategy to grow graphene nanoribbons with controlled widths and smooth edges directly onto dielectric hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) substrates. The team use nickel nanoparticles to etch monolayer-deep, nanometre-wide trenches into h-BN, and subsequently fill them with graphene using chemical vapour deposition. Modifying the etching parameters allows the width of the trench to be tuned to less than 10 nm, and the resulting sub-10-nm ribbons display bandgaps of almost 0.5 eV. Integrating these nanoribbons into field effect transistor devices reveals on‚Äìoff ratios of greater than 104 at room temperature, as well as high carrier mobilities of ~750 cm2 V‚àí1 s‚àí1. ===Multistep nanoribbon synthesis=== A bottom-up approach was investigated. In 2017 dry contact transfer was used to press a fiberglass applicator coated with a powder of atomically precise graphene nanoribbons on a hydrogen- passivated Si(100) surface under vacuum. 80 of 115 GNRs visibly obscured the substrate lattice with an average apparent height of 0.30 nm. The GNRs do not align to the Si lattice, indicating a weak coupling. The average bandgap over 21 GNRs was 2.85 eV with a standard deviation of 0.13 eV. The method unintentionally overlapped some nanoribbons, allowing the study of multilayer GNRs. Such overlaps could be formed deliberately by manipulation with a scanning tunneling microscope. Hydrogen depassivation left no band-gap. Covalent bonds between the Si surface and the GNR leads to metallic behavior. The Si surface atoms move outward, and the GNR changes from flat to distorted, with some C atoms moving in toward the Si surface. == Electronic structure == The electronic states of GNRs largely depend on the edge structures (armchair or zigzag). In zigzag edges each successive edge segment is at the opposite angle to the previous. In armchair edges, each pair of segments is a 120/-120 degree rotation of the prior pair. Zigzag edges provide the edge localized state with non-bonding molecular orbitals near the Fermi energy. They are expected to have large changes in optical and electronic properties from quantization. Calculations based on tight binding theory predict that zigzag GNRs are always metallic while armchairs can be either metallic or semiconducting, depending on their width. However, density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that armchair nanoribbons are semiconducting with an energy gap scaling with the inverse of the GNR width. Experiments verified that energy gaps increase with decreasing GNR width. Graphene nanoribbons with controlled edge orientation have been fabricated by scanning tunneling microscope (STM) lithography. Energy gaps up to 0.5 eV in a 2.5 nm wide armchair ribbon were reported. Armchair nanoribbons are metallic or semiconducting and present spin polarized edges. Their gap opens thanks to an unusual antiferromagnetic coupling between the magnetic moments at opposite edge carbon atoms. This gap size is inversely proportional to the ribbon width and its behavior can be traced back to the spatial distribution properties of edge-state wave functions, and the mostly local character of the exchange interaction that originates the spin polarization. Therefore, the quantum confinement, inter-edge superexchange, and intra-edge direct exchange interactions in zigzag GNR are important for its magnetism and band gap. The edge magnetic moment and band gap of zigzag GNR are reversely proportional to the electron/hole concentration and they can be controlled by alkaline adatoms. Their 2D structure, high electrical and thermal conductivity and low noise also make GNRs a possible alternative to copper for integrated circuit interconnects. Research is exploring the creation of quantum dots by changing the width of GNRs at select points along the ribbon, creating quantum confinement. Heterojunctions inside single graphene nanoribbons have been realized, among which structures that have been shown to function as tunnel barriers. Graphene nanoribbons possess semiconductive properties and may be a technological alternative to silicon semiconductors capable of sustaining microprocessor clock speeds in the vicinity of 1 THz field-effect transistors less than 10 nm wide have been created with GNR ‚Äì \\"GNRFETs\\" ‚Äì with an Ion/Ioff ratio >106 at room temperature.

Since the two-dimensional graphene sheet with strong bonding is known to be one of the stiffest materials, graphene nanoribbons Young's modulus also has a value of over 1 TPa. The Young's modulus, shear modulus and Poisson's ratio of graphene nanoribbons are different with varying sizes (with different length and width) and shapes. These mechanical properties are anisotropic and would usually be discussed in two in-plane directions, parallel and perpendicular to the one-dimensional periodic direction. Mechanical properties here will be a little bit different from the two-dimensional graphene sheets because of the distinct geometry, bond length, and bond strength particularly at the edge of graphene nanoribbons. It is possible to tune these nanomechanical properties with further chemical doping to change the bonding environment at the edge of graphene nanoribbons. While increasing the width of graphene nanoribbons, the mechanical properties will converge to the value measured on the graphene sheets. One analysis predicted the high Young's modulus for armchair graphene nanoribbons to be around 1.24 TPa by the molecular dynamics method. They also showed the nonlinear elastic behaviors with higher-order terms in the stress- strain curve. In the higher strain region, it would need even higher-order (>3) to fully describe the nonlinear behavior. Other scientists also reported the nonlinear elasticity by the finite element method, and found that Young's modulus, tensile strength, and ductility of armchair graphene nanoribbons are all greater than those of zigzag graphene nanoribbons. Another report predicted the linear elasticity for the strain between -0.02 and 0.02 on the zigzag graphene nanoribbons by the density functional theory model. Within the linear region, the electronic properties would be relatively stable under the slightly changing geometry. The energy gaps increase from -0.02 eV to 0.02 eV for the strain between -0.02 and 0.02, which provides the feasibilities for future engineering applications. The tensile strength of the armchair graphene nanoribbons is 175 GPa with the great ductility of 30.26% fracture strain, which shows the greater mechanical properties comparing to the value of 130 GPa and 25% experimentally measured on monolayer graphene. As expected, graphene nanoribbons with smaller width would completely break down faster, since the ratio of the weaker edged bonds increased. While the tensile strain on graphene nanoribbons reached its maximum, C-C bonds would start to break and then formed much bigger rings to make materials weaker until fracture. == Optical properties == The earliest numerical results on the optical properties of graphene nanoribbons were obtained by Lin and Shyu in 2000. The different selection rules for optical transitions in graphene nanoribbons with armchair and zigzag edges were reported. These results were supplemented by a comparative study of zigzag nanoribbons with single wall armchair carbon nanotubes by Hsu and Reichl in 2007. It was demonstrated that selection rules in zigzag ribbons are different from those in carbon nanotube and the eigenstates in zigzag ribbons can be classified as either symmetric or antisymmetric. Also, it was predicted that edge states should play an important role in the optical absorption of zigzag nanoribbons. Optical transitions between the edge and bulk states should enrich the low-energy region (<3 eV) of the absorption spectrum by strong absorption peaks. Analytical derivation of the numerically obtained selection rules was presented in 2011,. The selection rule for the incident light polarized longitudinally to the zigzag ribbon axis is that \\\\Delta J = J_2 - J_1 is odd, where J_{1} and J_{2} number the energy bands, while for the perpendicular polarization \\\\Delta J = J_2 - J_1 is even. Intraband (intersubband) transitions between the conduction (valence) sub-bands are also allowed if \\\\Delta J = J_2 - J_1 is even. Optical selection rules of zigzag graphene nanoribbons For graphene nanoribbons with armchair edges the selection rule is \\\\Delta J = J_2 - J_1 = 0. Similar to tubes transitions intersubband transitions are forbidden for armchair graphene nanoribbons. Despite different selection rules in single wall armchair carbon nanotubes and zigzag graphene nanoribbons a hidden correlation of the absorption peaks is predicted. The correlation of the absorption peaks in tubes and ribbons should take place when the number of atoms in the tube unit cell N_t is related to the number of atoms in the zigzag ribbon unit cell N_r as follows: N_t = 2 N_r + 4, which is so-called matching condition for the periodic and hard wall boundary conditions. The aforementioned results were obtained within the nearest- neighbor approximation of the tight-binding model neglecting the excitonic effects. First-principle calculations with quasiparticle corrections and many- body effects explored the electronic and optical properties of graphene-based materials. With GW calculation, the properties of graphene-based materials are accurately investigated, including graphene nanoribbons, edge and surface functionalized armchair graphene nanoribbons and scaling properties in armchair graphene nanoribbons. == Analyses == Graphene nanoribbons can be analyzed by scanning tunneling microscope, Raman spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. For example, out-of-plane bending vibration of one C-H on one benzene ring, called SOLO, which is similar to zigzag edge, on zigzag GNRs has been reported to appear at 899 cm‚àí1, whereas that of two C-H on one benzene ring, called DUO, which is similar to armchair edge, on armchair GNRs has been reported to appear at 814 cm‚àí1 as results of calculated IR spectra. However, analyses of graphene nanoribbon on substrates are difficult using infrared spectroscopy even with a Reflection Absorption Spectrometry method. Thus, a large quantity of graphene nanoribbon is necessary for infrared spectroscopy analyses. == Reactivity == Zigzag edges are known to be more reactive than armchair edges, as observed in the dehydrogenation reactivities between the compound with zigzag edges (tetracene) and armchair edges (chrysene). Also, zigzag edges tends to be more oxidized than armchair edges without gasification. The zigzag edges with longer length can be more reactive as it can be seen from the dependence of the length of acenes on the reactivity. == Applications == === Polymeric nanocomposites === Graphene nanoribbons and their oxidized counterparts called graphene oxide nanoribbons have been investigated as nano- fillers to improve the mechanical properties of polymeric nanocomposites. Increases in the mechanical properties of epoxy composites on loading of graphene nanoribbons were observed. An increase in the mechanical properties of biodegradable polymeric nanocomposites of poly(propylene fumarate) at low weight percentage was achieved by loading of oxidized graphene nanoribbons, fabricated for bone tissue engineering applications. === Contrast agent for bioimaging === Hybrid imaging modalities, such as photoacoustic (PA) tomography (PAT) and thermoacoustic (TA) tomography (TAT) have been developed for bioimaging applications. PAT/TAT combines advantages of pure ultrasound and pure optical imaging/radio frequency (RF), providing good spatial resolution, great penetration depth and high soft-tissue contrast. GNR synthesized by unzipping single- and multi-walled carbon nanotubes have been reported as contrast agents for photoacoustic and thermoacoustic imaging and tomography.Full Text PDF. == See also == * Graphene * Graphite * Graphene oxide paper * Carbon nanotube * Mitsutaka Fujita * Katsunori Wakabayashi * Silicene, which can also form nanoribbons * Graphene electronics == References == == External links == * WOLFRAM Demonstrations Project: Electronic Band Structure of Armchair and Zigzag Graphene Nanoribbons * Graphene nanoribbons on arxiv.org Category:Graphene ","title":"Graphene nanoribbon"},{"id":"11652707","text":"Greets Green (usually pronounced 'Grits Green') is a residential area of West Bromwich in the West Midlands of England. The appropriate Sandwell ward is called Greets Green and Lyng. The population taken at the 2011 census was 11,769. It was mostly developed between 1920 and 1970 with a mix of private and council housing, though there are still buildings in the area which date from before the First World War. A lot of the older housing in the area has been procured by development companies and have been knocked down or are ready to be knocked down to make way for more modern housing. The area is considered to be the birthplace of West Bromwich Albion Football Club. The club was founded in 1878 as West Bromwich Strollers. Most of the players lived and worked in Albion, a district of West Bromwich close to what is today Greets Green. Perhaps the most well-known feature of the area is the Oak House, on Oak Road near to Lodge Primary School. A farmhouse dating back to the sixteenth century, it was donated to the people of West Bromwich by Reuben Farley. One of the main civic amenities is the Marl Hole Park (known colloquially as the Marl 'ole), bounded by Hambletts Road, Gads Lane and Guns Village Primary School. Previously the site was a source of clay for the manufacture of bricks by Joseph Hamblett's firm. The Walsall Canal runs through the area. As part of the Silver Jubilee celebrations in 1977, Queen Elizabeth II drove through the area, up Oak Road into West Bromwich town centre. ==References== Category:Areas of Sandwell Category:West Bromwich ","title":"Greets Green"},{"id":"11652737","text":"Lyng is a residential area of West Bromwich in the West Midlands of England.

It is between Kirkcaldy and Glenrothes, and stands between the River Ore and Lochty Burn, which are at opposite ends of the main street. The Church of Scotland parish church was built in 1835 and is located on the Main Street. == Transport == The village has a small railway station, which is called Glenrothes with Thornton. Although situated at the south end of Thornton, it also serves the Glenrothes area. This rail halt was opened in May 1992, restoring a rail service to Thornton lost when its main line railway station closed in October 1969 as a consequence of the 1963 report by Dr Richard Beeching on the Reshaping of British Railways (the Beeching Report). The village is well served by local buses, operated by Stagecoach Group in Fife and running between Kirkcaldy and Glenrothes. However, express services between those towns bypass Thornton. ==Railways== Thornton Junction railway station was opened in the 1840s on the Edinburgh and Northern Railway. During the first part of the twentieth century, Thornton railway station was situated on the Aberdeen to London main line to the east of the village, at the end of Station Road. To the west, alongside the Dunfermline line, the largest railway marshalling yard in Scotland was built during the 1950s. Though much reduced, this yard is still in use for rail freight services. ==Coal mining== In 1957, the Rothes Pit was opened to mine the coal in the rural hinterland surrounding the village. This coal mine was tied very closely to the development of the postwar new town of Glenrothes to the north. The planned long-term benefits were to be huge, and were to be the driver for economic regeneration in Central Fife. In 1961, four years after opening, the huge investment was written off and the mine run down because of unstemmable flooding, and closed in May 1962. Ironically, miners who had worked in older deep pits in the area had forewarned against the development of the Rothes Pit for this very reason. The state-of-the art engineering and design was closed, leaving the huge enclosed concrete wheel- towers standing at Thornton for many years as a forlorn symbol of the collapse until 1993, when the towers where destroyed. ==Sport== Thornton is home to the junior football clubs Thornton Hibs and Thornton Amateurs, the latter of whom play in the Fife Premier Amateur League. Both teams play at Memorial Park in the village. In season 2005-06, Thornton Amateurs won the Fife Amateur First Division at the first attempt, being promoted to the Premier Division where they currently play. In season 2007-08, Thornton Hibs reached the semi-finals of the Scottish Junior Cup, only to be beaten 3-0 by Cumnock after extra time; the Hibs had been reduced to ten men, losing their goalkeeper, in the 89th minute when the score was 0-0. The village also has its own 18-hole golf course: https://www.thorntongolfclub.co.uk/ and bowling club: http://www.thorntonbowlingclub.co.uk/ == Culture== The village holds a Highland Games annually every July. Thornton is also the birthplace of Sir George Sharp, a Labour politician who led the battle against local government reforms in the 1970s. == Other == Thornton has a small (5 MegaWatt) solar farm. ==References== ==External links== Category:Villages in Fife Category:Mining communities in Fife ","title":"Thornton, Fife"},{"id":"11652750","text":"Below is a list of those who have held the office of Governor of Berwick-upon- Tweed, including the garrison at Holy Island (during English occupation of the Royal Burgh): ==Governors of Berwick-upon-Tweed== ===For Scotland=== * 1295 -1296 Sir William Douglas * 1328 - 1333 Sir Alexander de Seton, Lord of Seton & Winchburgh http://www.cyberancestors.com/cummins/ps111/ps111_291.htm * 1333 Sir William Keith * 1333 Patrick de Dunbar ===For England=== *1302: Edmund Hasting *1440-?: Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland ===For Scotland=== *1461 Sir Robert Lauder *1474: David Lindsay, Earl of Crawford *1478: Sir Robert Lauder (again) *1482: Patrick Hepburn, 1st Lord Hailes ===For England=== *1484-?: Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland *?‚Äì1539: Sir Thomas Clifford *1539‚Äì?: William Eure, 1st Baron Eure (died 1548) *1553‚Äì?: John Conyers, 3rd Baron Conyers (died 1557) *1559‚Äì1562: William Grey, 13th Baron Grey de Wilton *1564-1568: Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford *1568-1596: Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon *1596‚Äì1598: John Carey, 3rd Baron Hunsdon *1598-1601: Peregrine Bertie, 13th Baron Willoughby de Eresby *1601‚Äì1603: John Carey, 3rd Baron Hunsdon (2nd term) *c.1610: Sir James Dundas of ArnistonGazetteer for Scotland *1639-?: Robert Bertie, 1st Earl of Lindsey *1649‚Äì: Colonel George Fenwick *1660-1675: William Widdrington, 2nd Baron Widdrington *1675-1686: Henry Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne *1686-1688: William Widdrington, 3rd Baron Widdrington *1689‚Äì1690: Philip Babington *1691‚Äì1699: Richard Leveson (died 1699) *1702‚Äì1707: Edmund Maine ===For Great Britain (post 1707 Act of Union)=== *1707‚Äì1711: Edmund Maine *1713‚Äì1715: Sir Henry Belasyse *1715‚Äì1718: Charles Wills *1718‚Äì1719: George MacCartney *1719‚Äì1732: Joseph Sabine *1732‚Äì1733: George Wade *1733‚Äì1735: Rich Russell *1735‚Äì1740: Philip Honywood *1740‚Äì1741: Thomas Whetham *1742: James Tyrrell *1742‚Äì1753: Thomas Howard *1753‚Äì1765: John Guise *1765‚Äì1778: Robert MoncktonJohn Brooke, MONCKTON, Hon.

In 1807, the battalion to which he belonged sailed for Copenhagen, and after the capture of that city it returned to England. ==Peninsula== In 1809, the Coldstream Guards embarked for the Iberian Peninsula, and was present in all the great battles there against the Napoleonic forces, beginning with Talavera and ending with Toulouse. Having attained the rank firstly of lieutenant, then Captain, Mackinnon was appointed aide-de-camp to General Sir Edward Stopford, and distinguished himself throughout the campaign by his cool daring. On one occasion, when the army was passing a defile where British troops were debouching from it under destructive fire, the troops found Captain Mackinnon coolly shaving himself in a spot where the danger was greatest. Encouraged by this, the soldiers rushed forward and drove the French before them. ==Waterloo== In 1814 Mackinnon was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. Early in June 1815, he embarked with another officer at Ramsgate in an open boat, in order to join his regiment who were quartered near Brussels, and arrived the next morning at Ostend. He was present at the engagements of the 16th and 17th, and at the Battle of Waterloo on the 18th, where he had three horses shot from under him. In advancing to charge the French, leading a portion of his regiment, he received a shot in his knee which killed his horse and in falling he lost his sword. He fell close beside a French officer who was even more severely wounded, and in taking the latter's sword gently told him he hoped they might sup together that night. On recovering his legs he again mounted, urging on his men, advancing at their head. In the latter part of the day Colonel Mackinnon was ordered to occupy the farm of Hougoumont, where he was placed with about 250 of the Coldstream Guards and the first regiment of the Grenadier Guards. Aware of the great importance of this position, flanking the British Army, the Duke of Wellington sent orders that it be defended to the last. On this point, Napoleon directed his efforts, ordering battalion after battalion to the assault, with terrific carnage. Notwithstanding the pain of his wound, and his leg being almost disabled, Colonel Mackinnon continued to defend that perilous post until the advance of the whole British line, and the subsequent route of the French Army put an end to the struggle of the day. When the action was over, Mackinnon collapsed from loss of blood and fatigue and was sent on a litter to Brussels to recover. In 1826, he purchased the majority in the Coldstream Guards which gave him the rank of full colonel in the British Army, and the command of the regiment to which he had been attached all his military life. ==Military Author== King William IV had expressed a desire that every officer in command of a regiment should furnish the Horse Guards with some account of it, and Colonel Mackinnon wrote a work that was to become well-known: The Origin and Services of the Coldstream Guards, which was published in 1833. ==Marriage== After the peace, Daniel Mackinnon married the eldest daughter of the Member of Parliament for Poole, John Dent. ==Works== * ==Notes== ==References== * Anderson, William, The Scottish Nation, Edinburgh, 1867, vol.VII, p. 29 * Category:1791 births Category:1836 deaths Category:Coldstream Guards officers Category:British military writers Category:British Army personnel of the Napoleonic Wars ","title":"Daniel Mackinnon"},{"id":"11652780","text":"WAWY (103.9 FM) is a radio station licensed to Dundee, Illinois, which serves the northwestern suburbs of Chicago.

The initial discovery of the first harpoon head was made in 1988. When the artifact was dated to 88,000 BCE, there was skepticism within the archaeological community about the accuracy of the stated age; in that the object seemed too advanced for human cultures of that era. However, the site has yielded multiple other examples of similar harpoons, and the dates have been confirmed. It seemed to substantiate that fishing and an \\"aquatic civilization\\" was likely in the region across eastern and northern Africa during the wetter climatic conditions of the early to mid-Holocene, as shown by other evidence at the lakeshore site of Ishango.

Lend a Paw was directed by Clyde Geronimi and features original music by Leigh Harline. George Nicholas, Kenneth Muse, Nick Nichols, William Sturm, Eric Gurney, Norman Tate, Chick Otterstrom, Morey Reden, and Emery Hawkins animated the film. The voice cast includes Walt Disney as Mickey and Pinto Colvig as Pluto.\\"Lend A Paw\\". www.bcdb.com It was the 115th short in the Mickey Mouse film series to be released, and the sixth for that year. In the cartoon, which was largely a remake of the 1933 short Mickey's Pal Pluto, Pluto saves the life of a kitten, and later feels jealous towards the kitten after Mickey Mouse takes the kitten in. The film won the Oscar for Best Animated Short Film at the 14th Academy Awards in 1942, the only Mickey Mouse short to win the award. ==Plot summary== While out in the snow, Pluto hears meowing noises coming from a bag floating on a drifting ice floe. He saves it, only to lose interest when he finds an orange kitten inside. The kitten follows him home and Mickey immediately adopts it. Pluto becomes jealous of all the attention the kitten gets and is coerced by his shoulder devil to get it in trouble. Despite his shoulder angel's attempts to talk him out of it, Pluto tries to trick the kitten into attacking Mickey's goldfish Bianca, only for it to accidentally knock down the fishbowl. When Mickey demands answers from Bianca, she points to Pluto, knowing that he's the one trying to get the kitten into trouble in the first place. Mickey angrily kicks a guilty Pluto out of the house for the remainder of the day as punishment, and Pluto angrily blames his shoulder devil for getting him into trouble. Eventually, the kitten ends up being outside as well while chasing a ball, accidentally falling into a well. The angel tells Pluto to save it, but the devil furiously tells him to let it drown as retribution for getting him kicked out. Finally having enough, the angel chases off the devil by punching him into oblivion and convinces Pluto to do the right thing, only for him to fall in too. Hearing Pluto's cries, Mickey saves them both and comforts a near frozen Pluto, feeling very remorseful for kicking him out. After receiving a nice hot bath from Mickey and a thank you kiss from the kitten, Pluto is told by the angel \\"Kindness to animals, my friend, will be rewarded in the end\\". ==Voice cast== * Mickey Mouse: Walt Disney * Pluto and Pluto's angel: Pinto Colvig * Kitten: unknown ==Legacy== Pluto's angel and devil reappeared, played by Eric Idle and Penn Jillette respectively, in two episodes of Mickey Mouse Works -- \\"Pluto's Kittens\\" (1999) and \\"Minnie Takes Care of Pluto\\" (2000) -- as well as a 2002 episode of House of Mouse, \\"Pluto vs Figaro,\\" and in the Mickey Mouse episode, Easy Street, however, the angel actually agrees with the devil's plan remarking \\"Amen\\". ==Releases== * 1941 - theatrical release * 1954 - Disneyland, episode #1.6: \\"A Story of Dogs\\" (TV) * c. 1972 - The Mouse Factory, episode #29: \\"Consciences\\" (TV) * 1981 - \\"Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck Cartoon Collections Volume Three\\" (VHS) * c. 1992 - Mickey's Mouse Tracks, episode #67 (TV) * c. 1992 - Donald's Quack Attack, episode #15 (TV) * 1993 - The Adventures of Mickey and Donald, episode #1 (TV) * 1997 - \\"The Spirit of Mickey\\" (VHS) * c. 2002 - Bonus on Oliver and Company (DVD/VHS, only in USA/Canada) * 2004 - \\"The Complete Pluto\\" (DVD) * 2005 - \\"Classic Cartoon Favorites: Holiday Celebration with Mickey and Pals\\" (DVD) * 2006 - Bonus on The Fox and the Hound (25th anniversary edition DVD) * 2009 - Bonus on Oliver and Company (20th anniversary edition DVD) * 2013 - Bonus on Oliver and Company (25th anniversary edition Blu-ray) ==See also== *Mickey Mouse (film series) ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1941 films Category:1941 animated films Category:1940s American animated films Category:1941 comedy films Category:1941 drama films Category:American comedy- drama films Category:American films Category:Best Animated Short Academy Award winners Category:Disney animated short films, 1940s Category:Disney film remakes Category:English-language films Category:Films scored by Leigh Harline Category:Films directed by Clyde Geronimi Category:Films produced by Walt Disney Category:Mickey Mouse short films Category:Pluto (Disney) short films Category:Short film remakes Category:RKO Pictures animated short films ","title":"Lend a Paw"},{"id":"11652902","text":"Nyheterna (\\"the News\\") is the name of the news programme of the Swedish channel TV4.

News are also broadcast in the morning on Nyhetsmorgon and throughout the day in news updates on TV4, TV4 Plus and Nyheterna.se. ==History== Nyheterna was launched on 15 September 1990, the same day that TV4 launched, broadcasting two editions every day at 7 and 10pm. In 1992, the TV4 Group started broadcast a breakfast television programme, initially called Gomorron (\\"Good Morning\\"), but soon renamed Nyhetsmorgon (\\"News Morning\\"), with news from Nyheterna every half-hour. In 1993, the evening news bulletins was moved to 7:30pm, in an attempt to compete with the most popular news bulletin, Rapport on TV2, which had been broadcasting in that slot since the 1970s. This attempt failed and some years later, Nyheterna moved to 6:30pm, broadcasting after the local news. Rapport and Nyheterna launched lunchtime news bulletins simultaneously in the autumn of 1997. None were successful, and TV4 shortened the bulletin and moved it to 1pm some years later. News updates at 3 and 5pm also existed, but all daytime news updates had seized a few years into the 2000s. The evening bulletin was moved from 6:30 to the original 7pm slot in 2004. In the autumn of 2004, TV4 launched several daily news updates broadcast in TV4, TV4 Plus, TV4 Fakta and to mobile phones.

Developed by Ozark Softscape and released by Strategic Simulations, Cytron Masters is one of the earliest computer games that can be considered a real-time strategy game, or a real-time tactics predecessor to the genre, requiring the players to build up their forces in order to win. ==Gameplay== In the game each player takes the role of the commander, represented on-screen in Command Centers located on opposite sides of the screen. Scattered around the screen are eight \\"generators\\" that produce energy. The energy produced by these generators is the resource in the game, similar in function to the more tangible resources gathered in modern RTS games. Energy can then be \\"spent\\" to produce the Cytrons, robot warriors, as well as using it to move them about, fire, and other duties. The playfield consists of a twelve by six grid of possible locations, with the command centers at the (1,3) and (12,3) locations. Five different types of Cytrons can be built and moved about the grid. Shooters fire at the closest of any enemy units with a three-space range, mines detonate when an enemy approaches, bunkers absorb damage, and missiles fly up and over the battlefield to detonate at a selected location. The fifth unit, the Commander, relays commands from the Command Centers out to the units in the field. Gameplay is somewhat chess-like, a battle for position. Bunkers and mines become important along the front lines, protecting friendly units from attack while they are developed forward. ==Reception== Mark Botner reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, and stated that \\"Cytron Masters is an exciting game offering multiple levels of play with variations to suit the individual: Play on all levels guarantees an action-packed episode of futuristic combat.\\" Chris Smith reviewed SSI's RapidFire Line in The Space Gamer No. 59, and commented that \\"Cytron Masters requires a bit of tactical know-how, and its real-time command system gives it a slight arcade feel. I think this is the perfect combination of arcade and board game.\\" In a 1992 survey of science fiction games, Computer Gaming World gave the title two of five stars. ==References== Category:1982 video games Category:Apple II games Category:Atari 8-bit family games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:North America- exclusive video games Category:Real-time strategy video games Category:Strategic Simulations games Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Cytron Masters"},{"id":"11652951","text":"The parkland next to Haden Hill House Haden Hill is a residential area in the West Midlands of England, straddling the border of Halesowen and Cradley Heath townships and the modern boroughs of Dudley and Sandwell.

It has corporate offices in the Katy Distribution Center in unincorporated western Harris County, Texas, United States, near Katy and west of Houston. For 74 years it was a privately held company owned by the Gochman family, until its May 2011 acquisition by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co investment firm. ==History== Academy Sports & Outdoors came into existence in 1938, when Arthur Gochman and his business partner purchased Southern Sales, a San Antonio-based army-navy surplus chain comprising six stores that were by that year no longer making any profit. At the time, Gochman was a practicing attorney in San Antonio. He had not been formally educated as a businessman, but he had learned much about the surplus retail business from his father, Max Gochman, who had owned a surplus goods outlet in San Antonio and in 1935 still owned and operated a small chain of stores in Austin. 1970s Gochman bought out his partner in 1973 and changed the company's business name from Southern Sales to Academy Corp. The Academy name was borrowed from his father's stores. It came from a now-defunct San Antonio Catholic school named St. Henry's Academy. Max Gochman had opened his first store across the street from the school in the 1930s, selling pre-World War II surplus goods. Later, when he moved to Austin, he used the name for his four army-navy surplus stores. Because many University of Texas students and graduates lived in the Houston area and were familiar with the Austin stores, Max Gochman permitted his son to use the name, knowing that it would help his son's business. In 1978, the younger Gochman gave up his law practice and moved to Houston to assume active control of the company and complete the overhaul of its basic merchandising policies. The chain grew from eight stores in 1980 to 12 in 1985. By 1990 the company was selling more cowboy boots than any other chain in the United States. By the end of the 1980s Academy had become a popular Texas chain. Among other things, its outlets sold more state fishing licenses than its chief competitor, Oshman's Sporting Goods, or any other group of stores in the state. 1990s and Beyond Academy Sports Outdoors, Valdosta By 1990 Academy had grown to 18 stores. It also began a period of more rapid expansion, jumping to 34 stores by 1995, the year after it first moved into two adjoining states. It opened its first store outside Texas in Edmond, Oklahoma in June 1994, then added a store in Lafayette, Louisiana the following November, thus ending the company's exclusive Texas identity. Academy's roots remain in Texas, though, and the epicenter of the company's business always has been the greater Houston area. Almost half of its stores are located there, as are the company headquarters and its distribution facility. As it has expanded beyond its home base, Academy has sought \\"hot-market\\" locales, places that from market analysis offered the promise of high-volume sales. The result has been that it has never had to close one of its new stores, all of which have been profitable since their first day of operation. In 1995 David Gochman, the founder's son, joined Academy on a full-time basis. By that time his father, then 65, had built Academy into a $350 million retail chain and was ready to turn control of the business over to his 30-year-old son. David Gochman initially served as vice-president of store operations and general counsel, but in the following year he succeeded his father as Academy's chairman, president, and CEO. In 1999, it had 35 stores in Texas, three in Oklahoma, two in Alabama, three in Louisiana, and one in Florida. The majority of these were \\"superstores,\\" ranging from 35,000 to 100,000 square feet in size. In 2011, Academy Sports + Outdoors was acquired by the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. ==References== ==External links== * Category:American companies established in 1938 Category:Sporting goods retailers of the United States Category:Companies based in Harris County, Texas Category:Economy of the Southeastern United States Category:Online retailers of the United States Category:Retail companies established in 1938 Category:Surplus stores Category:Kohlberg Kravis Roberts companies Category:1938 establishments in Texas Category:Firearm commerce Category:Companies listed on NASDAQ Category:2020 initial public offerings ","title":"Academy Sports + Outdoors"},{"id":"11653054","text":"Connah's Quay () known locally as \\"The Quay\\" is a community and the largest town in Flintshire, lying within the Deeside conurbation along the River Dee, near the border with England. It is located west of Chester and can be reached by road from the A548, by rail from the nearby Shotton railway station, and also is on the National Cycle Network Route 5. It is also lies just south of Deeside Industrial Park, one of the largest such complexes in the region. The major part of Tata steelworks is also on the town's border on the north bank of the River Dee. Wepre Woods, an ancient woodland in the town, is controlled by Flintshire County Council's Ranger Service and includes Ewloe Castle which dates from the 13th century. With a population of approximately 23,437 with Shotton which it is contiguous with, Connah's Quay and Shotton constitute just under half of the population of the greater Deeside area. ==Etymology== The original name of the place was New Quay, but due to confusion with other similarly named places, it was renamed some time after 1860. The town's placename is of uncertain origin; among the theories are: * That Connah was an industrialist and one of the principal founders of the dock in the town. * From a former landlord of the \\"Old Quay House\\", a public house which is still on the docks in what is now the west side of the town. * That Connah was a man who owned a chandlery store on the docks. * From a lady called Mary Connah who used to own the dock, and so when people crossed the River Dee from places opposite, such as Parkgate or Neston, they would ask, \\"Could you take me to Connah's Quay\\". In 2018 the National Library of Wales released 1832 tithe maps of the area online. At this time Connah's Quay did not exist as a placename, but there were several land occupiers/ merchants with the surname 'Connah' in the Northop/Hawarden area. ==History== The earliest recorded settlements date from the time of the Domesday Book, listed as 'Wepre', part of the Hundred of Ati's Cross, Cheshire. The total population was 6 households. Wepre Woods are also recorded, measuring ¬Ω a league. Until the 18th century, the area where Connah's Quay and its neighbours Shotton, Aston and Queensferry now stand was nothing more than fields and a handful of inhabitants. It was not until the silting of the River Dee ended Chester's port activities that people and commerce began to flood in. The docks at Connah's Quay became a vital source of trade and finance for the greater Flintshire area, and with the advent of the railways during the 19th century a number of railway companies began to appear. The first railway to appear in the area was the Chester and Holyhead Railway running across the coast of North Wales linking the rest of the Great Britain with Ireland via the port at Holyhead. The purpose of this railway was chiefly for post to and from Ireland. During the 19th century, the railway's importance grew as Holyhead became the destination of choice for Ireland rather than Liverpool. Most of the line was quadruple tracked and this included the stretch through Connah's Quay. With the success of the Irish Mail trains, the dock was connected by the Wrexham, Mold and Connah's Quay Railway to the nearby town of Buckley, chiefly to transport bricks, clay and pottery products. A railyard was established at Connah's Quay docks with small feeder lines to the lines at Shotton, connecting to the North Wales and Liverpool Railway and the Chester and Connah's Quay Railway. A major steel works, John Summers & Sons, was founded in 1896 and is now owned by Tata Steel. Although now known as Shotton Steel, the plant lies mainly in Connah's Quay. The town grew from this small port, which included a Ferguson shipyard which built the historic ship Kathleen & May, to becoming a major railway town. By the late 1950s, the port had virtually ceased trading and the railway was in terminal decline. The two docks had by then long silted up, imprisoning the rotting hulk of an old wooden ship, the Bollam. This old vessel was believed to have taken part in rescuing the defeated British Expeditionary Force from Dunkirk. The town's passenger railway station (Connah's Quay railway station) on the North Wales Coast Line and northern terminus of the WMCQR line was open between 1870 and 1966. While the line remains open, there no trace of the former station. The street Leighton Court was built in 1998 on the site of the former station forecourt as well as the former WMCQR line, which had been lifted many years before. In fact, the growth of housing in the town and greater area since the line to Buckley was removed means that there is almost no trace of the former line. Its former path across the cricket pitch, up Pinewood Avenue and down past the substation has been completely built over. Another activity that ceased with the closure of the port was fishing. Fishermen would row out across the river in an arc, paying out a long net over the stern of the boat as they went: see seine fishing. They then returned to shore and hauled in the net. Mostly they caught fluke, which would then be sold from barrows pushed around the housing estates. Facilitated with the lifting of the Buckley line, by the 1970s the town had absorbed the nearby hamlets of Golftyn, Kelsterton and Wepre and many housing projects were developed. As with many small towns, the decline of local commerce has resulted in Connah's Quay overdeveloping its houses at the expense of shops and businesses. Many of these houses were indeed refittings of former shops. As a result, the town's population has swollen from a few hundred inhabitants to close to twenty thousand over a period of 50 years. Minister for Housing and Regeneration and Assembly Member for Alyn and Deeside since 2003, Carl Sargeant, lived in the town until his death in November, 2017. == Sights == Flintshire Bridge, seen from the south bank of the River Dee (2007) A number of historic structures are located in Connah's Quay, such as St Mark's Church and St David's Church. Top-y-Fron Hall is a Grade II* listed structure from the Georgian era. Connah's Quay Power Station is an example of industrial architecture from the 1950s. Flintshire Bridge was opened in 1998 by Queen Elizabeth II. ==Economy== Business in the town is mainly limited to local newsagents and a few independent traders located along High Street. While the town itself does not have many businesses, energy production is a major industry in the area and the town is home to Connah's Quay Power Station, a 1498MW gas fired station on the south side of the Dee, which utilises gas not only from the Dee estuary but also the Douglas Complex located further afield at Talacre. Many of the town's residents are employed at the nearby Deeside Industrial Estate, located on the north side of the Dee, and is the location of a second power station, Tata steelworks, Toyota, Wales Rally GB and the central headquarters of the Iceland chain of supermarkets. ==Education== Bryn Deva Primary School (2006) Schools in Connah's Quay include Connah's Quay High School, Bryn Deva Primary, Wepre Primary, Brookfield Primary and Golftyn Primary. Further education is provided by Coleg Cambria, formerly Kelsterton College, and by the 6th Form at Connah's Quay High School, which shares resources and students with other schools in Deeside. ==Community== Since the 1990s, several large housing developments have been built in Connah's Quay and the town has a booming property market, with house prices steadily increasing the town appeared to have finally shaken the effects of the mass redundancies from major employers in the 1970s and 1980s. However, surveys in the 2010s show that unemployment in the Connah's Quay area is rising by a further four percent every year. Crime statistics now rank Connah's Quay (central) as the 5th highest rate in Flintshire with neighbouring Shotton (east) placed worst.UKCrimeStats.com ==Governance== Former Urban District Council Building, on High Street (2014) Connah's Quay has a town council of twenty members. As of May 2019, thirteen represent the Labour Party and seven are Independents. ==Sport== ===Football=== The town is home to Deeside College which has on site the North Wales indoor athletics centre and athletics track which is used by Connah's Quay Nomads F.C.. A perennial fixture in the League of Wales during the 1990s, the club were relegated to the Cymru Alliance in 2009 due to the restructuring of the Welsh Premier League. The division went from 20 teams to 12, and the Nomads were one of the 8 unfortunate teams that year. With the appointment of former Wrexham and Port Vale star Mark McGregor as player/manager, the team won the Cymru Alliance twice in succession and were finally readmitted to the WPL. Two seasons of consolidation have ensured that the Nomads are also part of the rejuvenation of north Wales football, following from the rise and successes of Prestatyn Town, Bangor City and Caernarfon Town. The Nomads were crowned champions of Wales for the 2019-20 season, winning the league for the first time in the clubs history. ===Cricket=== The town is also home to a cricket club, who play their home games at Central Park. They have 7 teams in the North Wales League, the 1st XI won the North Wales Premier Cricket League in 2011. ===Miscellaneous=== Other facilities include Connah's Quay Sport Centre which has 4 grass football pitches, a sports hall, 2 gymnasiums, an outdoor floodlit artificial pitch which can host 3 x 6 a side football pitches or a full size football or hockey pitch. There is also an indoor sports hall which hosts 5 a side, basketball, badminton and many other activities. A swimming pool is also located in the town, just off Wepre Drive. ==Notable people== Arguably, the town's most famous resident was T.G. Jones, the former Everton and Wales defender and one of the country's top pre-war players. Teddy Peers, goalkeeper for Wolverhampton Wanderers Port Vale and Wales was born in the town of 1886. More recently, Gareth Owen appeared for AFC Wrexham most notably in their famous FA Cup win over Arsenal FC in 1991. Owen's performances for Wrexham later earned him a transfer to Liverpool FC. Former BDO darts world champion Ted Hankey also lived in the town during the 1990s. Also a resident for a number of years was Emlyn Williams, the author, playwright and actor. Tom Doran is a Welsh former professional boxer. Doran fought as an amateur for Shotton Amateur Boxing Club, in the welterweight division. Doran won his first regional championship‚Äîthe vacant WBC International middleweight title‚Äîin an action- packed two rounds against Luke Keeler on 2 April 2016. Composer Paul Mealor originally hails from the town. He came to wider notice when his motet Ubi Caritas et Amor was performed at the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton in 2011. He later composed the song \\"Wherever You Are\\" for the Military Wives Choir, which became the 2011 Christmas number one in the UK Singles Chart. ==Cultural references== The town is mentioned in the lyrics of the Catatonia song \\"Imaginary Friend\\" which is found on the album Paper Scissors Stone. ==References== ==External links== *Connah's Quay Town Council *BBC Wales - Connah's Quay, Shotton & Queensferry website Category:Towns of the Welsh Marches Category:Towns in Flintshire ","title":"Connah's Quay"},{"id":"11653055","text":"The Maplesden Noakes School is a coeducational secondary school and sixth form with academy status, located in Maidstone, Kent, England.

The school is situated in a residential area not far from the town's centre. It occupies a site and shares its grounds with Maidstone Grammar School for Girls. ==Description== It is an average-sized school in an area where a significant proportion of students go to local grammar schools. It is a specialist business and enterprise college. The proportion of disabled students and those with special educational needs supported at school action is well below the national average. The proportion of students supported at school action plus or with a statement of special educational needs is below average. The most common needs relate to behavioural, emotional and social difficulties. Less than one in 10 students is from minority ethnic groups, which is well below the national average. The proportion of students for whom the school receives the pupil premium (additional government funding for specific groups, including those known to be eligible for free school meals, looked after children and children from service families) is average. There are no service family children in the school. A relatively high proportion of Year 7 students is eligible for catch-up funding which is for students who did not achieve the expected Level 4 in reading or mathematics at the end of Key Stage 2.

The new formation was expanded from the Neapolitan cadre into a formation of three infantry regiments and one cavalry regiment, initially named the Polish-Italian Legion as it had been organized around the Poles formerly in Italian service. Most of the recruits came from ex-Prussian and ex-Austrian territories, particularly Pozna≈Ñ and Pomerania. The Polish-Italian Legion fought its first engagement at the siege of Klodzko and then was transferred to Kingdom of Westphalia in October 1807 and was placed in garrison in the capital, Kassel where it was recruited to full authorized strength from Poles in French occupied territory. The newly expanded cavalry regiment arrived in Kassel on November 11, 1807. Napoleon I directed that the Legion be transferred to French service on February 21, 1808. The Legion was transferred to Poitiers, France and was officially renamed the Vistula Legion on March 31, 1808 with the equivalent status of French line units. The infantry was reorganized to the 1808 pattern of six company battalions in April of that year in conformance with the new French organization decreed on February 18, 1808. The Legion's depot was at Sedan. All of the personnel of the Legion were to be of Polish ethnicity except for the company clerks, the fourriers, battalion adjutant non-commissioned officers, and paymasters. who were to be French. The strength of the Legion was set at 5,959 men in June 1808. The 2nd and 3rd infantry regiments of the Vistula Legion in June 1808 and participated in Napoleon's invasion of Spain (the Peninsular War). On March 24, 1809 at the Battle of Yevenes, 600 of Polish lancers of the Legion of the Vistula lost all their banners (which had not been defended because nobody knew they were hidden in the carriage) when they had cut through the ambush set by 5,000 of Spaniards. The regiment was renamed in 1811 into the 7e r√©giment de chevau-l√©gers lanciers. Napoleon I ordered a Second Vistula Legion formed from prisoners taken after his defeat of the Austrians at the Battle of Wagram in July 1809. Recruiting was slow and only two battalions were raised and were sent to Sedan in October 1809. Unlike the original legion, ethnic Germans were accepted into the new formation. The Second Vistula Legion was unable to recruit up to strength and was disbanded in February 1810 with its personnel being amalgamated with the original Legion as its 4th Regiment. == Service in Spain == Lancers of the Vistula Legion on patrol in Spain during the Peninsular War by Juliusz Kossak, 1875 On February 7, 1811, a second lancer regiment was raised, and on June 18 of that year, the two lancer regiments were removed from the legion and redesignated as the 7th and 8th Chevauleger-lancier regiments of the French line, with six converted French dragoon regiments being numbered 1 through 6. On May 16, 1811, the 1st Vistula Lancer Regiment at the Battle of Albuera more or less annihilated three of the four British foot regiments of Colborne's Brigade suffering 130 casualties (of 591 men present) compared with 1,258 men lost by the three British regiments, of which 319 were killed, 460 were wounded and 479 were taken prisoner. == Service in Russia == The Legion was withdrawn from Spain early in 1812 preparatory to the Napoleon's invasion of Russia. In March 1812 Napoleon ordered the four regiments to recruit a third battalion, raising them to three battalions apiece, plus a small regimental battery of two 3-pdr guns to be attached to each regiment as per the standard French practice of the time. The whole would serve together as a single division attached to the Young Guard commanded by General of Division Claparede. The new third battalions of the regiments did not join their parent units until the retreat from Moscow was well underway. Of the approximately 7,000 members of the Legion who entered Russia, only about 1,500 returned. == Service in Germany 1813 == On June 18, 1813 the survivors of the legion were reorganized into the single Vistula Regiment of two battalions. == Service in France 1814 == The Vistula Regiment was again reformed early in 1814 at its depot at Sedan with all the remaining Polish infantrymen in French service being transferred to it. After Napoleon's abdication, the survivors of the Legion returned to Poland. ==Waterloo== \\" In May 1815 (Waterloo Campaign) the 7th Lancers was formed again. However they had only 13 horses for 350 men. In July they fought on foot near Paris, and were highly praised by Marshal Davout. When the war was over, the 7th Lancers was one of few Polish units that refused to serve under the Tsar of Russia and was disbanded in France.\\" http://www.napolun.com/mirror/napoleonistyka.atspace.com/Polish_Vistula_Uhlans.html#uhlans1814 == See also == * Polish Legions in Italy * 1st Polish Light Cavalry Regiment of the Imperial Guard * Army of the Duchy of Warsaw * Duchy of Warsaw == References == == External links == * Napoleon.gery.pl Category:Polish Legions (Napoleonic period) Category:Military units and formations established in 1807 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1814 ","title":"Legion of the Vistula"},{"id":"11653067","text":"Squirrels Estate is a residential area of Halesowen in the West Midlands conurbation of England. It is situated approximately two miles south-west of the town centre, bordering onto countryside in the direction of Kidderminster. It is located in the Hayley Green & Cradley South ward of Dudley Metropolitan Borough. The estate was developed predominantly by Bryant Homes during the 1970s and early 1980s, and takes its name from the huge number of squirrels that occupied the land during its days as farmland. The farmhouse was built during the 1930s but survived its grounds by some 30 years, finally being demolished in 2004 amid controversy and local opposition to make way for four new houses which were built by Hadzor Davies, a local house builder. Due to financial difficulties, Bryant Homes sold off the final phase of the estate to the a local housing association, Jephson Housing Association who built a small concentration of houses and flats in the Snowdon Grove/Mendip Road area. Also, Halesowen Borough Council brought some of the houses built by Bryant Homes on the oldest part of the estate (Mendip Road, Long Mynd, Purbeck Close, Polden Close) due to the financial difficulties of the developer. These were originally rented to tenants as council housing and the vast majority have been purchased via the Right to Buy. Only a handful of properties remain as council owned dwellings. The original Bryant houses were 3 bedroom semis/terraced and a few detached. The later homes included more 3 and 4 bedroom detached homes, but also more semis/terraces. The last homes to be built on the estate were the last ever homes constructed by A&J; Mucklow PLC at the end of Campion Grove and were 5 and 6 bedroom large executive homes. The only thoroughfare on the estate is Portsdown Road, which links Dunstall Road to Lutley Lane. The estate is served by the 244 bus service, which gave links to Old Hill and Dudley, and Service 417 to Halesowen town centre, Blackheath, Oldbury and West Bromwich.

Along with the rest of the homes on the estate, they were praised by residents on their completion for offering a far higher standard of living than the older properties which many of their occupants had been rehoused from. But a decline soon set in, and by 1980 Tanhouse was one of the most troubled estates in the Midlands. Drug abuse, burglary, vandalism, graffiti, litter, car crime and violence were some of the problems plaguing the area. The tower blocks were the centre of much of these problems. These started to improve by the 1990s. In July 1999, Kipling House and Byron House were demolished in controlled explosions. Chaucer House was retained after a renovation scheme and was later renamed to The Pink Building. the area has improved (although a man was stabbed the week it was finished) and announced a much improved area.

He played at fly-half for South Africa during the post- apartheid era, although he was physically and technically acquainted in any back position. Honiball was a rare breed of fly-half, one who had a very expansive running game which brought the loose-forwards into the game quickly.page 24 He was also very tall for a fly-half and extremely physical, being a strong tackler and not afraid to take the ball and challenge the opposition.BBC News | South Africa | Key player: Henry Honiball He earned his nickname of 'Lem', which is Afrikaans for 'blade', for his ability to 'cut' through his opponent's defence.Sharks Rugby Paired in the halves with Joost van der Westhuizen, Honiball was an integral part of Nick Mallett's legendary Springbok squad which equalled the record of 17 consecutive Test victories, a record shared with New Zealand. Honiball played in 14 of the 17 victories, which included the clean sweep of the 1998 Tri Nations Series, the Springboks' first-ever series victory. Such was his reading, distribution and tactical knowledge of the game that he had an enviable Springbok success rate of nearly 75 per cent. He made his debut in 1993 against the Wallabies in Sydney, coming on as a replacement.

After the Springboks struggled to find their rhythm in the following year's Tri Nations tournament, Mallett had considered recalling Honiball for the match against New Zealand in Pretoria. He had only just returned from serious injury and was playing well for club side Natal, but revealed that he had suffered an ankle injury, so Mallett sent him to see a specialist in Johannesburg. Honiball retired from international rugby after the Springboks beat New Zealand in the 1999 Rugby World Cup third/fourth place play-off.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Phillies from 2011 through 2013 and Oakland Athletics in 2014. Before playing professionally, Savery attended Rice University, and played college baseball for the Rice Owls. ==Amateur career== A 2004 graduate of Lamar High School, Savery was a four-year starter and letterman for the Lamar Redskins. During his tenure at Lamar, he earned first team all-state and first team all-greater Houston. He was a three-time first team all-district 18-5a honoree, and was voted the most valuable player in the district in 2004. Joe was named the 2004 Proline player of the year after hitting .556 with 7 home runs and 40 RBI as a senior. He also went 11-0 on the mound with 93 strikeouts, posting a 0.53 ERA. Joe lead the Redskins to be nationally ranked in 3 different polls during his senior year.http://www.riceowls.com/sports/m-basebl/mtt/savery_joe00.html Savery matriculated to Rice University in August 2004, where he played for the Rice Owls baseball team. Savery concentrated on baseball, starting at first base and in the outfield when not pitching. As a freshman in 2005, Savery stepped into the starting lineup as opening-day pitcher and a regular in the batting lineup. Savery earned second- and third-team all-America honors while being named National Freshman of the Year and Western Athletic Conference Player of the Year. He was named first-team all-WAC at pitcher and first base after leading the conference with a .382 batting average and finishing second with a 2.49 ERA. In the postseason, Savery helped Rice to an upset NCAA regional win over LSU at formidable Alex Box Stadium in Baton Rouge. In the NCAA super regional against top-ranked Tulane, Savery broke his right hand in the opening game while making a sliding catch against the Turchin Stadium fence. The injury prevented Savery from hitting, but he pitched into the seventh inning and allowed only one run in Rice's Game 2 loss. Tulane advanced to the 2005 College World Series with a win in Game 3. As a sophomore in 2006, Savery again earned third-team all-America status despite making only 11 pitching starts due to injury. At the plate, Savery hit .335 and was one of Rice's most dangerous postseason hitters, earning MVP honors in that year's conference tournament and making the all-regional team. He also hit a three-run home run in the decisive third game of the NCAA super regional against Oklahoma, helping the Owls to the 2006 College World Series. At the College World Series, Savery went 3-for-3 in Rice's opening-game win against Georgia but was just 1-for-9 after that. As a junior in 2007, Savery spent much of the season trying to recover his form on the mound after offseason surgery. He continued to dominate at the plate, leading the Owls in hitting, but struggled with control and efficiency on the mound while posting a sub-3.00 ERA. Savery was named a first-team all-America as a two-way player and earned his second conference Player of the Year award in three seasons. He saved his best for the postseason, leading Rice through the NCAA regional with a Most Outstanding Player performance that included a dominant mound performance in the Sunday clincher against TCU. Four days after the regional, during an emotional pre- super-regional press conference, Savery was selected in the first round of the 2007 Major League Baseball Draft. Rice then swept Texas A&M; in a tense super regional to advance to the 2007 College World Series. After hitting a homer in the first game against Louisville, Savery finally got to pitch in Omaha and earned the win in a 14-4 defeat of North Carolina. ==Professional career== ===Philadelphia Phillies=== Savery, pitching for the Class-A advanced Clearwater Threshers Savery was the Phillies' first-round draft pick out of Rice in 2007 as the 19th overall pick. After signing with the Philadelphia Phillies, Savery was assigned to the Williamsport Crosscutters of the New York-Penn League (Class A Short Season). In 7 starts, he compiled a 2-3 W-L record with a 2.73 ERA. He struck out 22 and walked 13. He played in the 2007 Arizona Fall League with the Peoria Saguaros. In 2008 Savery skipped over Class A Lakewood and was assigned to Class A Advanced Clearwater. There he went 9-10 with a 4.13 ERA over 27 games (24 starts). He compiled 122 Ks in 150.1 innings while giving up 60 walks. He allowed 10 home runs as well. In 2009 Savery split time between Reading and Lehigh Valley, the AA and AAA affiliates of the Phillies, respectively. In Reading he had one of his best seasons. He went 12-4 with a 4.41 ERA struck out 77 in 112.1 innings pitched while walking 53, and giving up 13 home runs. He earned a mid-season call-up to AAA Lehigh Valley. There he went 4-2 in 7 starts with an ERA of 4.38. In 39 innings he walked 24 while striking out only 19, indicating some issues with his control. In 2010 Savery was assigned to Lehigh Valley where his stats and his control got worse. He went 1-12 with his worst ERA of his professional career at 4.66, striking out 67 and giving up 51 walks in 127.1 innings. During the off-season of 2010 it was announced that Savery would be converted into a hitter, with the hope he can recapture his collegiate success. He participated in the FIL after the season to learn first base which is where he will play in 2011. During the off-season Joe worked on his strength and conditioning. He switched some of his training techniques from being a pitcher, and began training more like a hitter. After hitting .348 for the AAA Lehigh Valley IronPigshttps://www.baseball- reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=savery001joe the Phillies were quite optimistic about Joe's chances of becoming a force in their Major League Lineup.

Ordained to the priesthood on 18 December 1926, he then did pastoral work in Annecy until 1942, whilst teaching at the seminary and serving as Director of Works. During World War II, Duval supported the French Resistance and was wary of the Vichy regime.Commonweal.

To Women He also served as President of the North African Episcopal Conference from 1963 to 1988. He was opposed to Action Fran√ßaise, which supported establishing Catholicism as the state religion, because he believed that faith and politics should remain separate. Duval was a schoolmate of the Traditionalist Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, and in August 1976, Duval urged him to fully submit himself to the authority of the pope. Pope Paul VI created him cardinal-priest of S. Balbina in the consistory of 22 February 1965. Duval was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the conclaves of August and October 1978, which selected Popes John Paul I and John Paul II respectively.

The unit is responsible for the investigation of organised and serious crime on a national level. It was formed in 1997 with the amalgamation of a number of national and specialist investigation units. The Garda NBCI is headed by a Detective Chief Superintendent, who reports to the Assistant Commissioner in charge of Special Crime Operations. The bureau is headquartered at Harcourt Street, Dublin City, and operates throughout the country. ==Organisation== The Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation consists mainly of detectives, who are generally senior investigators, and is headed by an officer of Detective Chief Superintendent rank. The head of the Garda NBCI reports to the Assistant Commissioner in charge of Special Crime Operations, who reports directly to the Garda Commissioner. The NBCI was established on January 21, 1997, centralising other investigative branches around the country, as a response to the proliferation of serious and organised crime. Its predecessor was the Garda Central Detective Unit (CDU). Its main function is to provide a specialist investigative response to serious criminal activity, supporting other Garda units and/or local investigators in their investigation into serious crimes. The NBCI is the main unit within the Garda√≠ that investigates internal Garda criminality and corruption. The NBCI works closely with other Garda units, and law enforcement agencies from other countries when there is an international dimension to investigations, such as the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), Metropolitan Police Service and National Crime Agency (NCA) in the United Kingdom. The NBCI operates from the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) Headquarters of the Garda√≠ in Harcourt St, Dublin 2. NBCI officers are mostly experienced detectives, who have been promoted to the unit from other investigative units, and the majority have spent time as local/regional detectives. All officers within the NBCI are armed. The unit receives funding for specialist equipment (such as investigative tools, weapons and vehicles) which other areas of the force does not possess, and therefore more serious crimes and crimes of a sensitive nature are investigated by the NBCI. The Garda NBCI houses the following sub-units; *Anti-Racketeering Unit *Arts and Antiques Unit *Stolen Motor Vehicle Investigation Unit (SMVIU) *Environmental Crime Unit *Criminal Investigation Unit *Serious Crime Review Team (\\"Cold Case Unit\\") ==Remit== *Murder *Stolen Motor Vehicles & Plant Machinery *Serious & Organised Crime *Theft of Computer Components *Anti-Racketeering *Arts and Antiques Thefts *Environmental Crime *Postal and Telegraphy Thefts and Fraud *Intellectual Property Rights Violations *Review of Major Investigations *Cold Case Investigations *Extradition of Fugitives *Internal Investigation of Corruption / Criminality The responsibility for the investigation of crime rests with local Garda Superintendents, the NBCI provides expertise and skills in the investigation of serious and organised crime. Bureau staff members assist in all aspects of the investigation including; *Preliminary enquiries *Case management *Incident Room management *General investigation *File preparation *Interviewing of Suspects and Witnesses Specialist investigation teams from NBCI carry out these tasks when requested by local Garda officers or on the direction of senior Garda Management. ==Weapons== Unlike regular uniformed Garda officers ‚Äì who are unarmed ‚Äì detectives of the NBCI are plainclothes armed officers. NBCI detectives are more heavily armed and receive a higher standard of firearms training than regular Garda detectives, due to the nature of their work. NBCI officers are routinely armed with either of the following; * SIG Sauer P226 (9√ó19mm Parabellum semi-automatic pistol) * Walther P99 (9√ó19mm Parabellum semi-automatic pistol) ==See also== * Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) * Garda Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau * National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) ==References== ==External links== * Garda S√≠och√°na official website Category:Garda S√≠och√°na units ","title":"National Bureau of Criminal Investigation"},{"id":"11653340","text":"In Ohio, State Route 194 may refer to: *Ohio State Route 194 (1923), now part of SR 500 *Ohio State Route 194 (1920s-1960s), now part of SR 103 ","title":"Ohio State Route 194"},{"id":"11653347","text":"In Ohio, State Route 234 may refer to: *Ohio State Route 234 (1920s), now part of SR 93 *Ohio State Route 234 (1930s), now part of SR 60 and SR 754 ","title":"Ohio State Route 234"},{"id":"11653351","text":"In Ohio, State Route 240 may refer to: *Ohio State Route 240 (1920s-1930s), now part of SR 348 *Ohio State Route 240 (1940s-1960s), now part of SR 269 ","title":"Ohio State Route 240"},{"id":"11653361","text":"In Ohio, State Route 263 may refer to: *Ohio State Route 263 (pre-1927), now part of SR 170 *Ohio State Route 263 (1927), now parts of SR 120 and Holland Sylvania Road ","title":"Ohio State Route 263"},{"id":"11653388","text":"State Route 326 (SR 326) was the final designation for a short state highway near Holland, Ohio. At the time the route was removed from the state highway system in 1934, the road had been a state highway since the system's creation but with different designations throughout its history. ==Route description== SR 326 began at an intersection with Holland‚ÄìSylvania Road. The route headed northwest for about one mile (1.6 km) until curving to the north, crossing over Wolf Creek, and ending at SR 2 which was also known as Toledo‚ÄìWauseon Road. The entire route was in Springfield Township, though the northern terminus was located just outside the village limits of Holland. ==History== The short stretch of road had been a part of the state highway system since at least 1912. Prior to 1922, the road was the northernmost mile of SR 57, a route that ran from Maumee to what was then SR 20 near Holland. From 1923 until 1926, the route became the westernmost mile of SR 102. In 1927, the mile-long roadway became the entirety of State Route 223 as the roads north and southeast of the southern terminus became a part of US 20. This designation would remain until 1931 when this route became State Route 283 as a result of the creation of U.S. Route 223 within the state (located in the northern part of Lucas County). This designation was short-lived as the route became State Route 326 by 1932 (the route at the southern terminus also became US 20N at this time). SR 326 would only be signed for about two years because in 1934, the route was removed from the state highway system altogether.

P.\\" Arencibia (born January 5, 1986) is a Cuban-American former professional baseball catcher. He is currently a studio analyst for Fox Sports Florida. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Toronto Blue Jays, Texas Rangers, and Tampa Bay Rays from 2010 through 2015. ==High school career== As a teenager, Arencibia attended Westminster Christian high school in Miami, Florida, which has produced other MLB players, most notably Alex Rodriguez and Doug Mientkiewicz. Arencibia also played football and basketball in high school, but excelled in baseball. He later played for the Under-18 Florida Bombers, alongside future major leaguers Mat Latos, Gaby S√°nchez, Yonder Alonso, and Jon Jay. ==College career== Arencibia attended the University of Tennessee, and played college baseball for the Tennessee Volunteers. He won the USA Baseball Richard W. \\"Dick\\" Case Player of the Year Award in 2006. Prior to the 2007 draft, questions were raised about Arencibia's defensive abilities as a catcher. After drafting him, however, the Blue Jays decided to keep him as a catcher, rather than convert him to another position, such as first base. While attending college, Arencibia played with Chase Headley, Luke Hochevar, and Julio Borbon. In the summer of 2006, Arencibia played baseball in Cuba with David Price, and would later be drafted 20 positions behind Price in 2007. ==Professional career== ===Toronto Blue Jays=== ====2007‚Äì10==== Arencibia was drafted 21st overall by the Toronto Blue Jays in the 2007 MLB draft. He was assigned to Toronto's Low A ball affiliate, the Auburn Doubledays of the New York‚ÄìPenn League. Arencibia struggled during the early part of the season but hit well during the stretch and into the playoffs, helping the Doubledays win the NY-Penn League championship. He began the 2008 season with the Dunedin Blue Jays of the Florida State League. By the FSL all-star break, he led the league or was near the top in many offensive categories, finishing the first half of the season batting .315 with 13 homers, 22 doubles and 62 RBI. He was named as the starting catcher for the Western Division in the FSL All-Star Game. After the game, the Blue Jays promoted him to their Double-A team, the New Hampshire Fisher Cats of the Eastern League. During the off-season of 2008, Arencibia took part in the Arizona Fall League as a member of the Phoenix Desert Dogs. For the 2009 season, Arencibia was promoted to the Las Vegas 51s, the Blue Jays' Triple-A affiliate in the Pacific Coast League. Arencibia was promoted to the MLB on August 4, 2010 to replace the injured John Buck, who had been placed on the 15-day disabled list for a right thumb laceration. At the time of his promotion, Arencibia was batting .303 with a PCL leading 31 home runs and 79 RBI He started in his first MLB game for the Toronto Blue Jays on August 7, 2010 against the Tampa Bay Rays. In his first MLB at-bat, Arencibia hit a two- run home run on the first pitch from James Shields, becoming the 28th player in history to hit a home run on his first MLB pitch. In his following plate appearances, he hit a double, a single and then a solo home run and received a curtain call from the fans at the Rogers Centre while finishing the game just a triple shy of hitting for the cycle. Arencibia is the fifth player ever to hit two home runs in his first game. In addition, he became the first person in the modern era with four hits and two home runs in an MLB debut, a feat set 121 years before by Columbus Solons catcher Charlie Reilly. Arencibia is also the first Blue Jay to have four hits in a debut, and the first Blue Jay since Junior Felix to hit a home run on his first at bat. On August 18, 2010, Arencibia was optioned back to Triple-A Las Vegas to make room for the return of John Buck from the disabled list. He was recalled from Las Vegas on September 1. ====2011==== Arencibia was the starting catcher at the Blue Jays' 2011 home opener. He hit the team's first home run of the season, a 2-run homer to deep center. He finished the night with 2 home runs and a triple. On May 7, he broke up Justin Verlander's perfect game, being walked after a 12 pitch at-bat. On June 3 against the Baltimore Orioles, Arencibia hit his first career grand slam in an 8‚Äì4 victory. As of June 4, Arencibia led all major league rookies with 9 home runs, which is already a Blue Jays club record, surpassing the previous record of five, shared by Pat Borders (1988) and Greg Myers (1990). Toronto Blue Jays in 2011 In a game against the Kansas City Royals on August 25, Arencibia hit his 20th home run of the season, tying the single season record for home runs by Blue Jays catchers (John Buck hit 20 in 2010). While playing at home against the Tampa Bay Rays on August 29, Arencibia stole a base, his first career stolen base on his first attempt. In a game against the Boston Red Sox on September 7, Arencibia hit his 21st home run of the season, breaking a tie with John Buck for most home runs by a Blue Jays' catcher in a single season. He is one of three rookies in Blue Jays history to hit 21 or more home runs, along with Eric Hinske (24 in 2002) and Rowdy Tellez (21 in 2019). He led all major league catchers in passed balls in 2011, with 12. ====2012==== On Opening Day 2012, Arencibia hit a game-winning 3-run home run in the 16th inning against the Cleveland Indians. It was the longest game in Opening Day history in terms of innings. On May 16, 2012, Arencibia reached 100 RBI for his career in a 4-1 win against the New York Yankees. The following day, in a game against the New York Mets, Arencibia set a career high for RBI in a game with 6, in a 14-5 win. Arencibia also hit 2 home runs, giving him the first 3-game home run streak of his career.Blue Jays clout 5 homers, blow out Mets Arencibia was named AL Player of the Week for May 14‚Äì20, hitting .360 with 4 home runs, 10 RBI, 7 runs scored, and a slugging percentage of .920. He is the first catcher in Blue Jays history to win the award.Blue Jays catcher J. P. Arencibia named AL Player of the Week On July 25, in a game against the Oakland Athletics, Arencibia was hit on the right hand by a pitch while catching. Arencibia finished the inning, but left the game for precautionary reasons. X-rays came back positive for a fracture, and he was expected to miss 6 weeks. Arencibia began a rehab assignment with the Class-A Dunedin Blue Jays on September 2. He finished the season with a .233 batting average, 18 home runs, and 56 RBI. ====2013==== On May 6, 2013, Arencibia hit a two-run home run to give the Blue Jays an 8‚Äì7 lead against the Tampa Bay Rays, in a game where they had been down 7‚Äì0 after the third inning. The comeback victory was the largest by the Blue Jays since a 12-11 win in 2007, also against Tampa Bay. It was to be a rare 2013 highlight for Arencibia, who was a consistent target of criticism from both the fans and the press for his poor statistical performance that year. Arencibia was a guest on \\"Brady & Lang\\", a radio program broadcast on Sportsnet 590, on July 4, 2013. When asked for his opinion of Gregg Zaun and Dirk Hayhurst, two commentators (and former Blue Jays players) employed by Rogers Sportsnet who had criticized Arencibia's performance in recent broadcasts, Arencibia stated that \\"...speaking for myself and the team, there's not one person in our clubhouse that respects those guys\\". Arencibia stated that Hayhurst was a \\"below average player\\" during their time together in Triple-A, and also made mention of Zaun's link to the Mitchell Report, which named several players suspected of using performance-enhancing drugs during their careers. After setting off a firestorm of comments from fans, some defending his position, others against it, on July 23, Arencibia shut down his Twitter account. (It was later reopened by a fan group called \\"Team JP\\" on August 15.) Arencibia finished the 2013 season batting below the Mendoza line, hitting just .194, although he did hit 21 home runs, placing him second amongst MLB catchers to Matt Wieters, and 55 RBIs. However, his extremely low batting average, coupled with drawing only 18 walks over the course of the entire season, led to an historically low OPS for Arencibia: with a .592 OPS, he became the first player in major league history to reach 20 homers in a season and still post a sub-.600 OPS. (The next lowest OPS for a 20-homer season was .649 by Cleveland's Willie Kirkland in 1962.)http://www.dallasnews.com/sports/texas- rangers/headlines/20131220-texas-rangers-2014-roster-analysis-better-plate- discipline-key-to-j.p.-arencibia-s-improvement.ece?nclick_check=1 Arencibia was non-tendered on December 2, 2013, making him a free agent for the first time in his career. ===Texas Rangers=== ====2014==== On December 5, 2013, it was reported that Arencibia and the Texas Rangers were in discussions for a possible contract.

On July 29 at Globe Life Park, Arencibia dominated New York Yankees' pitching with four extra base-hits in five at bats (two doubles, two home runs, one of them being a grand slam) and batted in seven of eleven Rangers runs, but the Rangers fell 12-11.

In its second incarnation it was the only such light moved from another location in the Chesapeake Bay. ==History== The first light at this location was built in 1871 by Francis A. Gibbons, replacing a lightship which was stationed there the previous year. A ten pile arrangement similar to that of the York Spit Light in Virginia was used. Initially equipped with a sixth- order Fresnel lens, it was upgraded to a fifth order lens in 1881 after ice piled up around the foundation and disturbed some of the outer piles, tilting the house slightly. A second ice flow in 1918 piled up , knocking the house from the piles and destroying it. Although consideration was given to using a caisson structure, it was decided instead to reuse the house from the Cherrystone Bar Light, which had been deactivated in 1919. This was moved by barge and placed on a new six pile foundation in 1921, making the new light the only working lighthouse to be moved from one location to another in the bay. This light lasted until 1964, when the house was dismantled as part of the general program of eliminating such lights; a skeleton tower on the old piles replaced it. A replica of the second Choptank River Lighthouse was built on the waterfront in Cambridge, Maryland and is open for tours. It was dedicated September 22, 2012. ==References== * *Choptank River Light, from the Chesapeake Chapter of the United States Lighthouse Society * ==External links== *Choptank River Lighthouse - replica project * Category:Lighthouses in Maryland Category:Lighthouses completed in 1871 Category:Lighthouses completed in 1921 Category:Transportation buildings and structures in Talbot County, Maryland Category:Lighthouses in the Chesapeake Bay Category:Museums in Dorchester County, Maryland Category:Lighthouse museums in Maryland Category:Cambridge, Maryland Category:Buildings and structures completed in 2012 Category:Museums established in 2012 Category:1871 establishments in Maryland Category:1964 disestablishments in Maryland Category:2012 establishments in Maryland Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1964 ","title":"Choptank River Light"},{"id":"11653480","text":"The Dana‚ÄìFarber/Harvard Cancer Center is the largest National Cancer Institute (NCI) designated Comprehensive Cancer Center in the nation.

Their colours were Red and White, latterly represented by an All Red playing kit and they played at the Showground , Wood Street, Great Harwood. ==History== Founded in the 1880s Great Harwood joined Division Two of the Lancashire Combination in 1908. After World War I the league was reduced to a single division from which the club was eventually relegated in the summer of 1947 following the re-introduction of Division Two . They were later crowned Lancashire Combination Champions in 1968‚Äì69 and subsequently became founder members of the Northern Premier League. At the time the side featured several former Football League players including ex-England internationals Ronnie Clayton and Bryan Douglas, and ex-Welsh international Roy Vernon. In 1970‚Äì71 under the management of Tommy Cummings they reached the first round of the FA Cup for the first and only time, losing 6‚Äì2 at home to Rotherham United. In the summer of 1978 financial problems caused the club to fold. Following the demise of the club Great Harwood Wellington became the town's leading football club as they adopted the name Great Harwood Town and immediately took over tenancy of the Showground. ==Honours== *Lancashire Combination **Champions 1968‚Äì69 ==Former players== 1\\\\.

The former storehouse helper from Munich, and assistant to the Munich executioner Reichhart, was the chief executioner of the Pankr√°c prison from February 1943. Until 1945, 1,079 persons were executed in the so-called Sekyr√°rna (axe room). His assistants were the Czechs Alfred Engel, Robert T√Ωfa and Jan K≈ô√≠≈æek, who changed his name to Johann Kreuz. Later, the Gestapo changed the assistants; newly added were Anton√≠n Nerad from Prague-Bran√≠k and Otto Schweiger, the brother-in-law of Weiss. After the war, Weiss lived in the Federal Republic of Germany. In the 1970s, he requested a public pension from the Czech government, citing his work as a public servant for them. He died in Straubing, 62 years old. During executions, the executioners mostly followed this procedure: one held the hands of the condemned to prevent him from moving when the guillotine blade descended. The second stood at the feet of the prisoner and untied his hands after the beheading. The two additional assistants pulled the body to a trunk to the right of the place of execution, took the head out of the basket and laid it next to the body. After that, Weiss wrote in the execution book the name of his victim. As can be gathered from the notes, an execution took three minutes. The victims were cremated in Prague's Stra≈°nice Crematorium. == Further reading == * Marek Mahdal, \\"Pankr√°ck√° sekyr√°rna\\", 30 November 2004 (Contains the testimony of the Prague executioner {Notes from the years 1945‚Äì1946} and information from the Archive of the Prison Administration of the Czech Republic.) ==References== Category:German executioners Category:People from Munich Category:1906 births Category:1969 deaths Category:People from Ruma ","title":"Alois Weiss"},{"id":"11653580","text":"Coat-of-arms of the House of Zlatariƒá.

He was Governor of New Mexico Territory from 1869 to 1871. William was one half Native American (from his mother), most likely Choctaw. His father's name was Jacob Pile and his mother's name was Comfort Williams. ==Biography== Born near Indianapolis, Indiana, Pile completed preparatory studies, studied theology, became a minister in the Methodist Episcopal Church and was a member of the Missouri conference. At the outbreak of the Civil War, he entered the Union Army as chaplain of the 1st Missouri Light Artillery Regiment in 1861, serving under Colonel Clinton B. Fisk. He was made captain, Battery I, 1st Missouri Light Artillery, March 1, 1862 and promoted to lieutenant colonel of the 33rd Missouri Volunteer Infantry September 5, 1862, and colonel December 23, 1862, brigadier general of volunteers in 1863, commanding Post of Port Hudson, District of Baton Rouge and Port Hudson, Department of the Gulf (December 26, 1864 - February 13, 1865; and commanding 1st Brigade, 1st Division, United States Colored Troops, District of West Florida, Department of the Gulf (February 19 - April 25, 1865, and brevet major general in 1865. Three of the regiment's batteries were at Fort Donelson and apparently Pile was too. Made a battery commander, it is stated that he was at Shiloh; however, the records indicate that it was under the command of Lieutenant Charles H. Thurber. He was, however, in the Corinth, Mississippi operations which followed. As an infantry commander he fought at Devall's Bluff and took part in the Yazoo River expedition. Named a brigadier general, he took up recruiting duties in St. Louis and was not particularly concerned to whom-loyal or secessionist-the slaves he inducted belonged. After serving in a post command, he led a black brigade at Mobile. For the attack on Fort Blakely he was brevetted major general and was mustered out on August 24, 1865. His later career included one term as a radical Republican congressman; he was also territorial governor of New Mexico and a diplomat to Venezuela. Pile was elected a Republican to the United States House of Representatives from Missouri in 1866, serving from 1867 to 1869, being unsuccessful for reelection in 1868. There, he served as chairman of the Committee on Expenditures in the Post Office Department from 1867 to 1869. Afterward, he was appointed Ambassador to Venezuela and Brazil by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1869, but his nomination was withdrawn and was instead appointed Territorial Governor of New Mexico which he served as from 1869 to 1871. Pile was again appointed Ambassador to Venezuela by President Grant in 1871, which he served as until 1874. He moved to Monrovia, California in 1886, and purchased a 50-acre property, where he grew wine grapes. The following year, he commissioned the renowned Northern California architects Samuel and Joseph Cather Newsom to design a house for him, the stately \\"Idlewild\\" house at 255 N. Mayflower Avenue. After serving for one year as mayor, he applied to be consul general in Melbourne, Australia, but contracted pneumonia that same year and died in Monrovia on July 7, 1889. He is buried, along with his son, William E. Pile, in Live Oak Cemetery, at 200 E.

Originally developed by the Air Force Research Laboratory, AFGROW is mainly used for aerospace applications, but can be applied to any type of metallic structure that experiences fatigue cracking. == History == AFGROW's history traces back to a crack growth life prediction program (ASDGRO) which was written in BASIC for IBM-PCs by E. Davidson at ASD/ENSF in the early-mid-1980s. In 1985, ASDGRO was used as the basis for crack growth analysis for the Sikorsky H-53 helicopter under contract to Warner-Robins ALC. The program was modified to utilize very large load spectra, approximate stress intensity solutions for cracks in arbitrary stress fields, and use a tabular crack growth rate relationship based on the Walker equation on a point-by-point basis (Harter T-Method). The point loaded crack solution from the Tada, Paris, and Irwin Stress Intensity Factor Handbook was originally used to determine K (for arbitrary stress fields) by integration over the crack length using the unflawed stress distribution independently for each crack dimension. A new method was developed by F. Grimsley (AFWAL/FIBEC) to determine stress intensity, which used a 2-D Gaussian integration scheme with Richardson Extrapolation which was optimized by G. Sendeckyj (AFWAL/FIBEC). The resulting program was named MODGRO since it was a modified version of ASDGRO. Many modifications were made during the late 1980s and early 1990s. The primary modification was changing the coding language from BASIC to Turbo Pascal and C. Numerous small changes/repairs were made based on errors that were discovered. During this time period, NASA/Dryden implemented MODGRO in the analysis for the flight test program for the X-29. In 1993, the Navy was interested in using MODGRO to assist in a program to assess the effect of certain (classified) environments on the damage tolerance of aircraft. Work began at that time to convert the MODGRO, Version 3.X to the C language for UNIX to provide performance and portability to several UNIX Workstations. In 1994, MODGRO was renamed AFGROW, Version 3.X. Since 1996, the Windows-based version of AFGROW has replaced the UNIX version since the demand for the UNIX version did not justify the cost to maintain it. There was also an experiment to port AFGROW to the Mac OS but there was a lack of demand. An automated capability was added in the form of a Microsoft Component Object Model (COM) interface. The program is now developed and maintained by LexTech, Inc. == Software architecture == The stress intensity factor library provides models for over 30 different crack geometries (including tension, bending and bearing loading for many cases). In addition, a multiple crack capability allows the analysis of two independent cracks in a plate (including hole effects) and a non-symmetric cracked corner. Finite Element (FE) based solutions are available for two, non-symmetric through cracks at holes as well as cracks growing toward holes. This capability allows the analysis of more than one crack growing from a row of fastener holes. AFGROW implements five different crack growth models (Forman Equation, Walker Equation, Tabular lookup, Harter-T Method and NASGRO Equation ) to determine crack growth per applied cyclic loading. Other user options include five load interaction (retardation) models (closure, Fastran, Hsu, Wheeler, and Generalized Willenborg), a strain-life based fatigue crack initiation model, and the ability to perform a crack growth analysis with the effect of the bonded repair. The program also includes tools such as: stress intensity solutions, beta modification factors (ability to estimate stress intensity factors for cases, which may not be an exact match for one of the stress intensity solutions provided), a residual stress analysis capability, cycle counting, and the ability to automatically transfer output data to Microsoft Excel. AFGROW uses COM (Component Object Model) Automation interfaces that allow the use of scripts in other Windows applications. The program has a plug-in crack geometry interface that interfaces with structural analysis programs capable of calculating stress intensity factors (K) in the Windows environment. Users may create their own stress intensity solutions by writing and compiling dynamic link libraries (DLLs) using relatively simple codes. This includes the ability to animate the crack growth. This interface also makes it possible for finite element analysis software to provide three- dimensional based stress intensity information throughout the crack life prediction process. It is possible to select cases with two, independent cracks (with and without holes). A plug-in stress intensity model capability allows the creation of stress intensity solutions in the form of a Windows DLL (dynamic link library). Drawing tools allow solutions to be animated during the analysis. Interactive stress intensity solutions allow the use of an external FEM code to return updated stress intensity solutions. ==References== == External links == * Homepage ** Version Information Category:Mechanical engineering Category:Fracture mechanics Category:Structural analysis ","title":"AFGROW"},{"id":"11653743","text":"Cheryl Moch was a founding board member of the Jewish feminist organization (JFO).

The company \\"Happy bvba\\" has the exclusive license to manufacture and sell these puzzles. Happy Cubes are also known by a number of other names, among them: \\"Cube It!\\" cubes, \\"Wirrel Warrel\\" (in the Netherlands), \\"I.Q.ubes\\" and \\"Cococrash\\" (in Spain and Portugal). The Happy Cubes were made of 8mm-thick ethylene-vinyl acetate foam mats (also known as EVA). The tiles were based upon a 5x5 matrix where the outer squares may be present or absent. The central 3x3 kernel was fixed. Initially the puzzle is assembled into a 2-dimensional, flat 2x3 piece rectangle fitted into a frame. The basic challenge is to construct a perfect, 6-sided cube out of these 6 pieces. Usually, there is only one way to fit the pieces into a complete cube and it can be reached with various levels of difficulty by trial and error. ==Variations== There are four families of Happy Cube puzzles, each containing 6 different cubes. Each family has a unique texture, style and difficulty level. Within each puzzle family the cubes are differentiated by color. The four families of Happy Cube puzzles are: * The Little Genius - Textured with various icons of foods, vehicles, emotions etc.'. These are the easiest cubes to build and are designed for children aged three to seven years. * The Happy Cube - Plainly colored with a single color each and with no texture, medium difficulty. These are the original cubes that were designed by the inventor in 1986. * The Profi Cube - Textured with two interleaving colors, slightly harder to build than the Happy Cubes. There are two versions of this family, the first is colored with one dominant color and a black background and the newer version is much more lighter in shade, replacing the black background with a second dominant color similar in shade to the first one. * The Marble Cube - Textures as colored marble, the hardest difficulty. ==Solutions== The basic challenge of the Happy Cubes puzzles is to construct a single perfect cube from the 6 pieces of a single puzzle which share the same color scheme and texture. A subsequent challenge to this is to fit the pieces back into the 2-dimensional frame from which they came. With the presence of more than one puzzle available, pieces of several different cube puzzles can be joined together to make up larger and more complex structures other than the basic 6 faced cube. Some structures are more difficult to construct than others and the more pieces available, the easier it is to find a solution that makes a closed shape since there are more options of pieces to choose from. With enough pieces, virtually any structure imaginable can be constructed. Two of the most popular complex structures are the 2√ó2√ó2 cube which is a perfect cube with each face made of 4 pieces (all in all, 24 pieces) and the Star structure, which is made of 6 cubes attached in a single-cube sized common centre (all in all, 30 pieces). Several computer applications exist to aid in the process of designing large structures and finding solutions for them automatically. == References == ==External links== * Happy Cubes official site * The inventor's home page * The Happy Cube Solver An interactive application which solves happy cube puzzles and uses a 3D graphical user interface. * Happy Cube (Wirrel Warrel) Solver The first well- known Happy Cube Solver, using textual interface * Happy Cube (official hungarian site) Category:Mechanical puzzle cubes Category:Educational toys ","title":"Happy Cube"},{"id":"11653762","text":"Sch√∂nwald is a municipality in the district of Dahme-Spreewald in Brandenburg in Germany. ==History== The present Sch√∂nwald as an entity was created from the voluntary merger of two previously independent municipalities, Sch√∂nwalde (Lower Sorbian Bƒõ≈Çy G√≥zd) und Waldow-Brand.

In 2005 Temperamento met Caracas Nel, a Venezuelan living in Rhode Island that would eventually become his music manager. Despite not being signed to a record label, Temperamento quickly gained attention from fans of Spanish language rap music due to his sound and controversial subject matters. Producer SPK, best known as producer of the Reggaeton song 'Oye Mi Canto', offered Temperamento the opportunity to appear on his first album with Gemstar & Big Mato's \\"Mas Pure.\\" The song, which featured popular Hispanic artists such as Tony Touch and N.O.R.E, was a commercial success. Temperamento recorded several albums from 2005 to 2010, with individual music videos garnering hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube. ==Incarceration and conversion to Christianity== In 2010, Temperamento was sentenced to 27 months in prison for having committed an armed robbery one and a half years prior to the sentencing. A month before he began serving his prison sentence, Temperamento received online messages from his fans stating that God had a plan for his life. During that time period, the artist reflected on the cover of his most recent album El M.E.J.O.R, in which he was depicted as a gold pharaoh. Temperamento considered his self-depiction as a form of idolatry, and began to have stronger faith in God. Prior to his incarceration, Temperamento did not have traditional Christian beliefs. For several years prior to his imprisonment, the artist was a practitioner of the Afro-Cuban religion Santeria. Shortly after his release from prison in 2011, Temperamento began writing and performing rap music with strong Christian themes. His first music video was titled \\"Abre Tu Corazon\\" (Open Your Heart), and represented the artist's transition from gangster rapper to Christian rapper. ==Album Bajo Control== During the years 2011 and 2012, Temperamento developed Christian- themed rap songs in Spanish for his album Bajo Control. In August 2012, the rapper released a video titled \\"Mensaje Para el Mundo\\" (Message to the World), which he describes as a wake-up call to music fans.Temperamento Offers World a Message with New Rap Video The video emphasizes faith in God during times of difficulty, which range from natural disasters, to the impact of the Illuminati.

His music featured microtonality, electronics, and a variety of percussion. He invented a 31-tone instrument called the zoomoozophone in 1978. From 1990 to his death he was the conservator of the Harry Partch instrumentarium. ==Biography== Born in Los Angeles, Drummond studied trumpet and composition at the University of Southern California and California Institute of the Arts. He studied trumpet with Don Ellis and John Clyman, and studied composition with Leonard Stein. Drummond then worked as a musician for and assistant to the maverick composer and instrument builder Harry Partch. He performed in the premieres of Partch‚Äôs large-scale works Daphne of the Dunes, And on the Seventh Day Petals Fell in Petaluma, and Delusion of the Fury. Drummond also participated in recordings made by Partch for the Columbia Masterworks label in the late 1960s. In 1976, Drummond moved to New York City. A year later he co-founded (with flutist Stefani Starin) the contemporary music ensemble Newband. Newband recorded works by Partch, John Zorn, Joan LaBarbara, John Cage, Anne LeBaron, James Pugliese, and Thelonious Monk, as well as original works by Drummond. In 1990, he became director and curator of composer/inventor/musician Harry Partch's homemade instruments. Drummond performed many of Partch's compositions on the original instruments (such as kithara, surrogate kithara, harmonic canons, adapted guitar, and cloud chamber bowls), as well as incorporating the instruments into original compositions. Drummond conducted educational workshops, and trained student musicians to play the idiosyncratic instrumentarium. Drummond was a director of the New York Consortium for New Music for over ten years, and was involved in producing the annual Sonic Boom Festival. At the time of his death he was Associate Professor and Director of the Harry Partch Institute at Montclair State University, New Jersey.

Devastated in the Thirty Years' War and with a population of only 122 still in 1860, the rapid development of the former village on the riverside to a coveted suburban residential area began with the building of the railway line to G√∂rlitz shortly afterwards and the rise of Berlin as capital of the German Empire in 1871. Zeuthen station was inaugurated on 1 November 1897. Neighbouring Miersdorf was merged into the Zeuthen municipality in 1957. In World War II, the German Reichspostministerium research department under Wilhelm Ohnesorge had begun to build up a cyclotron particle accelerator and an isotope separator at Zeuthen, which from 1962 formed the nucleus of the East German Institute for High Energy Physics (IfH), part of the Academy of Sciences of the GDR. Following German reunification, the premises were merged as the second site of the DESY institute on 1 January 1992. == Demography == File:Bev√∂lkerungsentwicklung Zeuthen.pdf|Development of Population since 1875 within the Current Boundaries (Blue Line: Population; Dotted Line: Comparison to Population Development of Brandenburg state; Grey Background: Time of Nazi rule; Red Background: Time of Communist rule) File:Bev√∂lkerungsprognosen Zeuthen.pdf|Recent Population Development and Projections (Population Development before Census 2011 (blue line); Recent Population Development according to the Census in Germany in 2011 (blue bordered line); Official projections for 2005-2030 (yellow line); for 2014-2030 (red line); for 2017-2030 (scarlet line) ==Politics== ===Seats in the municipal assembly (Gemeindevertretung) as of 2008 elections=== *B√ºrger f√ºr Zeuthen (Free Voters): 6 *Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD): 6 *The Left: 4 *Christian Democratic Union (CDU): 4 *Alliance '90/The Greens: 1 *Free Democratic Party (FDP): 1 === Mayor === On September 24, 2017 Sven Herzberger (no party affiliation) won the election for an eight-year term with 62.9 % of the valid votes cast.Ergebnis der B√ºrgermeisterwahl am 24.

Devotion), as well as releasing some records under his own name in France. On many of these and later records he worked with fellow writer and producer Jean Kluger. In 1971 Vangarde and Kluger released the cult LP Le Monde Fabuleux Des Yamasuki as the Yamasuki Singers, a pseudo-Japanese concept album of pop songs, described on the sleeve of its CD reissue as \\"a fuzzed- out-educational-multi-cultural psych-rock-opera.... proto-psychedelic hip-hop with overweight drum beats and basslines\\". The song \\"Aieaoa\\" on the album was later recorded, as \\"Aie a Mwana\\", first by Black Blood and then by Bananarama, becoming the first UK hit for the latter group. Vangarde's main international successes came later in the 1970s, as writer and producer with Ottawan's \\"D.I.S.C.O.\\" and the Gibson Brothers's \\"Cuba\\". He also worked extensively with the Antillean group La Compagnie Cr√©ole, popular in France in the 1980s. As Who's Who he recorded the album Who's Who in 1979. Vangarde is Jewish. Vangarde has made campaigns in the past to ensure that descendants of Jewish artists in France, whose rights were taken from them in the Second World War, received financial compensation. In May, 2013, the London magazine Dazed & Confused featured an hour-long mix of funk, disco and electro produced by Vangarde.Yin-Wong, Flora, The Hits of Daniel Bangalter, Dazed & Confused, May 2013.

He previously played for the Detroit Tigers and Boston Red Sox. Selected by the Tigers in the 2007 MLB draft, he made his MLB debut in 2009, and was the youngest player in the American League. His manager, Jim Leyland, chose to start him in the 2009 American League Central tie-breaker game over Nate Robertson, Eddie Bonine, and Armando Galarraga. After the 2014 season, the Tigers traded Porcello to the Red Sox. He struggled in 2015, but rebounded in 2016, leading the majors in wins and winning the AL Cy Young Award (becoming the first Red Sox pitcher since Pedro Mart√≠nez to do so) and the AL Comeback Player of the Year Award. He won the 2018 World Series with the Boston Red Sox, starting the third game of the series. ==Amateur career== Porcello graduated from Seton Hall Preparatory School in West Orange, New Jersey in 2007. In his senior season, he compiled a 10‚Äì0 record with 103 strikeouts and a 1.44 ERA in 63 innings pitched. He threw a perfect game on May 12, 2007 against Newark Academy. Although Porcello signed a letter of intent to attend the University of North Carolina, he later declined in order to pursue his professional career in Major League Baseball. Porcello was drafted 27th overall in the first round of the 2007 Major League Baseball draft by the Tigers. His choice of sports agent Scott Boras to advise him may have scared away some teams, knocking him down to the 27th spot even though he was ranked No. 1 among high school prospects entering the draft. Porcello had been described as an \\"ace\\" who could be a \\"bona fide No. 1 starter.\\" He was also known as a \\"special\\" pitcher. Porcello was signed by the Detroit Tigers to a $7.28 million, four-year deal with two one-year options. The total contract is worth $11.1 million, making Porcello the highest-paid high schooler ever. He also received a $3.5 million signing bonus, the second- largest ever given out by the Tigers, surpassed only by the $3.55 million given to 2006 first round pick Andrew Miller. ==Minor league career== Porcello played the entire 2008 season with the Lakeland Flying Tigers of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League. He earned his first victory against the Tampa Yankees on April 3, 2008. On May 12, he was named the Florida State League Pitcher of the Week. On July 19, he took part in a seven inning combined no- hitter against the St. Lucie Mets. Porcello finished the season with a record of 8‚Äì6 in 125 innings pitched. His 2.66 ERA was the lowest in the FSL. ==Major league career== ===Detroit Tigers=== ====2009==== On February 7, 2009, Tigers general manager Dave Dombrowski stated that Porcello would be considered for the final spot in the Tigers rotation, pending his spring training performance. Porcello began drawing comparisons to Boston Red Sox ace Josh Beckett, namely from Tigers official Al Avila, who was the Florida Marlins scouting director when the team drafted Beckett in 1999. On April 1, Dombrowski confirmed that Porcello would make the 2009 opening day roster after posting a 2.63 ERA in five Grapefruit League games. Dombrowski stated: Detroit Tigers in 2009 On April 9, Porcello made his Major League debut against Toronto, opposite Blue Jays rookie pitcher Ricky Romero. The game marked the first time in MLB history that two first-round picks faced each other in their respective debuts. Porcello pitched five innings and took the loss for Detroit. He struck out four batters and allowed four runs on eight hits. On April 19, Porcello earned his first career win in an 8‚Äì2 victory over the Seattle Mariners. He allowed one run and struck out three in seven innings with no walks. He retired the final 14 batters he faced. Porcello won all five games he started in May. He became the youngest pitcher to win five starts in a row since Dwight Gooden won seven in a row in 1985, as well as the first Tiger age 20 or younger to win five consecutive starts since at least 1954 (research prior to that year is incomplete). On August 11, during a game against the Boston Red Sox, Porcello hit Kevin Youkilis with a pitch. Youkilis charged the mound, threw his helmet right in front of Porcello, and tackled him to the ground as both benches cleared. Both players were ejected for the brawl and were sentenced to five-game suspensions. Despite his youth, Porcello was selected by Tiger manager Jim Leyland to pitch in the one-game tie-breaker playoff for the AL Central Division crown after the Tigers and Minnesota Twins both finished the regular season at 86‚Äì76. Porcello allowed two runs (one earned) in innings of work, getting a no-decision in the game that the Twins eventually won in 12 innings. Porcello finished the 2009 season with a 14‚Äì9 record and 3.96 ERA. On November 16, it was announced that Porcello finished third in the voting for American League Rookie of the Year, behind Andrew Bailey of the Oakland Athletics and Elvis Andrus of the Texas Rangers. ====2010==== Porcello began the 2010 season with a 4‚Äì7 record, accumulating a 6.14 ERA. On June 20, 2010 he was sent down to AAA Toledo. He was called back up on July 17 to face the Indians. In his first start back with the team, Porcello pitched very well, continuing the trend of struggling starters in the Tiger rotation finding success upon returning from the AAA Toledo Mud Hens. He went eight innings against the Indians, allowing one run, striking out six, and walking none, albeit in a Tigers loss. Porcello finished the 2010 season with a 10‚Äì12 record, going 5‚Äì1 in his last 7 starts, and bringing his season ERA down to 4.92. ====2011==== Porcello at Dodger Stadium, June 2011 Porcello entered Spring Training competing for a job in the Tigers starting rotation, battling with teammates Phil Coke, Jacob Turner, and Brad Penny for a spot. He ended up in the Tigers rotation for the 2011 season. He started in 31 games for the Tigers, pitching 182 innings (his career high for a season, through 2013) and accumulating a 14-9 record, 104 strikeouts and a 4.75 ERA. In the 2011 postseason, Porcello made four appearances (two starts), compiling an 0‚Äì1 record with a 4.80 ERA and 12 strikeouts in 15 innings. ====2012==== On January 6, 2012, Porcello opted out of an option for 2012 included in his four-year contract, becoming arbitration eligible and under team control through 2015. After gaining Super Two status by reaching the required amount of service time, Porcello gained an extra year of arbitration eligibility, which was 2012. On January 16, Porcello agreed to a one-year, $3.1 million deal with the Tigers, avoiding arbitration. Because he filed for arbitration and did not accept his option for 2012, he earned an extra $1.76 million. Porcello made 31 starts in 2012, going 10‚Äì12 with a 4.59 ERA. He struck out a career-high 107 batters on the season, but also surrendered a career-high 226 hits. Porcello was on the postseason roster for the Tigers, who went all the way to the World Series, but he pitched only postseason innings, allowing no runs. ====2013==== On January 18, 2013, Porcello signed a one-year, $5.1 million contract with the Tigers to avoid arbitration for a second time. With the Tigers signing fourth starter An√≠bal S√°nchez to a five-year deal, Porcello competed with Drew Smyly for the fifth and final spot in the Tigers rotation. On March 26, it was announced that Porcello had won the No. 5 starter job over Smyly. In his Tigers career through 2012, Porcello wore uniform number 48. When the Tigers acquired outfielder Torii Hunter ‚Äì who also wears number 48 ‚Äì in the 2012‚Äì13 offseason, Hunter made a monetary offer for the number. Porcello, a New Jersey native, instead asked Hunter to donate the money he offered to victims of Hurricane Sandy, and Porcello changed to number 21 for the 2013 season. In a May 28 game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Porcello pitched eight shutout innings and fanned 11 batters to establish a new career high for strikeouts in a game. On June 30, Porcello threw a pitch that hit Ben Zobrist of the Tampa Bay Rays. It was widely thought that the pitch was in retaliation for a pitch that Rays reliever Fernando Rodney threw near the head of Tigers superstar Miguel Cabrera the night before. The benches were warned and there were no incidents the remainder of the game, but two days later, MLB suspended Porcello six games and fined him an undisclosed amount. On September 10, Porcello pitched his first career complete game in his 147th major league start, resulting in a 9‚Äì1 win over the Chicago White Sox. Porcello retired 14 consecutive batters after escaping a fourth-inning jam that yielded his only run allowed. Porcello finished the regular season with a 13‚Äì8 record, 4.32 ERA, and a career-high 142 strikeouts. ====2014==== On January 17, 2014, Porcello and the Tigers avoided arbitration for the third straight season by agreeing to a one-year deal worth $8.5 million. On June 26, Porcello pitched his first career complete game shutout in a 6‚Äì0 win over the Texas Rangers. He gave up just three hits in the game, striking out six and throwing 115 pitches. In his next start on July 1, Porcello pitched a complete game shutout in a 3‚Äì0 win over the Oakland Athletics, giving up four hits, striking out zero, walking no one, and throwing 95 pitches. Porcello became the first Tiger to pitch back-to-back shutouts since Jack Morris in 1986. He became the first Major League pitcher to throw a shutout without a walk or a strikeout since Jeff Ballard on August 21, 1989. In a more recent distinction, he became the first Major League pitcher to throw a no-strikeout shutout since Derek Lowe did it for the Indians on May 15, 2012. On August 20, Porcello pitched his third complete game shutout of the season in a 6‚Äì0 win over the Tampa Bay Rays, giving up three hits, striking out four and walking none. Porcello is the first Tiger pitcher to throw at least three shutouts in a season since Jeff Weaver in 2002. Porcello's three shutouts tied him with Henderson √Ålvarez for the major league lead. On August 26, Rick defeated the New York Yankees 5‚Äì2 for his 15th victory of the season, establishing a new career high in wins. He had won 14 games in two prior seasons (2009, 2011). Rick struggled down the stretch, however, going 0‚Äì4 with a 6.20 ERA in September. He would finish the 2014 regular season with a 15‚Äì13 record, 129 strikeouts, and a career-best 3.43 ERA. He topped 200 innings pitched for the first time in his career, with . ===Boston Red Sox=== On December 11, 2014, the Tigers traded Porcello to the Boston Red Sox in exchange for Yoenis C√©spedes, Alex Wilson, and Gabe Speier. On April 6, 2015, Porcello and the Red Sox agreed on a 4-year contract extension worth $82.5 million, including a $500,000 signing bonus. ====2015==== On August 2, 2015, Porcello was placed on the Disabled List (retroactive to July 30) for the first time in his career, with the Red Sox stating he was suffering from triceps soreness and inflammation. At the time, Rick was mired in his worst season, statistically, having posted a 5‚Äì11 record and a 5.81 ERA prior to the injury. He returned August 26 and threw seven shutout innings in a 3‚Äì0 win over the Chicago White Sox. In his next start, September 1 against the New York Yankees, Porcello struck out a career-high 13 batters in 8 innings, but lost a 3-1 decision. Porcello finished his first season in Boston with a 9‚Äì15 record in 28 starts, and an ERA of 4.92 which tied his career high. He gave up a career-high 25 home runs, but also had a career-high strikeout rate (7.8 K/9). ====2016==== Porcello rebounded from a bad season by leading the Red Sox back to the playoffs on the way to winning the Cy Young Award. On September 9, 2016, Porcello became the first Major League pitcher to reach 20 wins in the current season, as the Red Sox defeated the Toronto Blue Jays, 13‚Äì3. Porcello led the major leagues in 2016 with 22 wins (against four losses) and posted career bests in most major statistical categories, including: games started (33), innings pitched (223), strikeouts (189), ERA (3.15) and WHIP (1.01). He also allowed 32 walks over the entire season, leading the major leagues with a 5.91 strikeout-to-walk ratio, and threw three complete games. Porcello's 26 quality starts were tied for the AL lead with former teammate Justin Verlander. On November 7, Porcello was announced by the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) as a finalist for the 2016 American League Cy Young Award, along with Verlander and Corey Kluber. On November 9, Porcello was named the American League's Outstanding Pitcher, given by the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA). On November 16, Porcello won the 2016 American League Cy Young Award in unique fashion. He became the first pitcher in American League history to win the award despite not receiving the most first-place votes from the BBWAA. Porcello's former teammate with the Tigers, Verlander, received 14 first-place votes to Porcello's 8, but two Tampa Bay writers left Verlander off their five-pitcher ballots entirely. Porcello received the most second-place votes of anyone appearing on a ballot, giving him the award. The final tally of 137 to 132 was the third closest vote since 1970. Porcello's eight first place votes (out of 30 possible) was the third-fewest for a Cy Young Award winner. Porcello became the fourth Red Sox pitcher to win the award, joining Jim Lonborg, Roger Clemens, and Pedro Mart√≠nez. He also became the first American League pitcher to win the award while posting an ERA higher than 3.00 (coincidentally, no AL starting pitcher had a sub-3 ERA in the 2016 season) and fewer than 200 strikeouts since Bartolo Col√≥n in 2005. ====2017==== Porcello struggled the ensuing season after winning the Cy Young Award the previous season, finishing with a career high 17 losses. He also gave up 38 home runs, more than any other major league pitcher. He struck out 181 batters in innings. ====2018==== Porcello began the 2018 season in Boston's starting rotation. On April 12, against the Yankees, Porcello took a no-hitter through 6+ innings until giving up a double by Aaron Judge. Porcello pitched through seven innings, giving up only two hits while striking out six as the Red Sox won, 6‚Äì3. During the regular season, he made 33 starts for the Red Sox, going 17‚Äì7 with a 4.28 ERA in innings. The Red Sox finished with a 108‚Äì54 record and went on to face the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series. Porcello was Boston's starting pitcher in Game 3, getting a no decision in an extra innings loss. The Red Sox went on to win the series in five games, giving Porcello his first career championship title. ====2019==== Porcello again began the season in Boston's starting rotation. On 30 April against the Oakland Athletics, Porcello pitched 8 shutout innings giving up two hits on only 78 pitches.Through the end of April, he had a 2‚Äì3 record with 5.52 ERA. For the season, he made 32 appearances (all starts) compiling a 14‚Äì12 record with 143 strikeouts in innings with a 5.52 ERA He became a free agent on October 31. ===New York Mets=== ====2020==== On December 16, 2019, the New York Mets announced that they signed Porcello to a one-year contract. His first game was on July 26th, against the Atlanta Braves, in a season which was shortened to 60 games due to COVID-19. ==Personal life== Porcello, a resident of Chester Township, New Jersey, was inducted into the Spanish National Honor Society at Seton Hall Prep. He graduated with a four-year weighted cumulative GPA of 3.94. His older brother Zach is a pitching coach at Seton Hall University. His younger brother Jake is a 2009 graduate of Seton Hall Prep and was a pitcher at Seton Hall University and was drafted by the Tigers in the 48th round of the 2009 draft. Porcello is the maternal grandson of Sam Dente, who played for the Cleveland Indians in the 1954 World Series. ==Pitching style== Porcello is a groundball pitcher who relies on a sinking two-seam fastball. He throws his two-seamer about half the time, ranging around 90 mph. He also has a four-seam fastball in the 91‚Äì93 range (tops out at 94‚Äì95 mph) and a circle changeup in the low 80s which is used mostly on left-handed hitters. He used to throw an occasional slider, but scrapped it prior to the 2013 season for a more effective upper-70s curveball. Porcello's former pitching coach Jeff Jones for the Tigers describes the curve as a \\"change of pace, something that he can throw as a first pitch to a left-handed hitter for a strike.\\" Porcello's groundball rate in 2013 was 55.3%, the highest of his career and one of the best in the majors, while his flyball rate was only 23.7%. ==Awards and recognition== *2016 American League Cy Young Award. * Selected to the 2006 AFLAC High School All-American Classic Baseball game in San Diego, California * Named the 2006‚Äì07 Gatorade national baseball player of the year * Selected for the 2008 Florida State League mid-season and post-season All-Star teams * Named the AL Rookie of the Month for May 2009 * Named Tigers Rookie of the Year for 2009 * Inducted into the Chester Hall of Fame ==References== ==External links== *Minor league statistics * : Category:1988 births Category:Living people Category:American League wins champions Category:American sportspeople of Italian descent Category:Baseball players from New Jersey Category:Boston Red Sox players Category:Cy Young Award winners Category:Detroit Tigers players Category:Lakeland Flying Tigers players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:New York Mets players Category:People from Chester Township, New Jersey Category:People from Morristown, New Jersey Category:Seton Hall Preparatory School alumni Category:Sportspeople from Morris County, New Jersey Category:Toledo Mud Hens players ","title":"Rick Porcello"},{"id":"11653949","text":"Paulus Stephanus Cassel (February 27, 1821 ‚Äì December 23, 1892), born Selig Cassel, was a German Jewish convert to Christianity, writer, orator, and missionary to Jews. ==Biography== Paulus Stephanus Cassel, 1880 Cassel was born in Gross-Glogau, Silesia, Prussia. His father was a sculptor, and his brother David was a well-known rabbi in Berlin and docent at the Hochschule f√ºr die Wissenschaft des Judenthums (College for the Study of Judaism). Cassel studied at the Gymnasium of Glogau and Schweidnitz and at the University of Berlin, where he followed with special interest the lectures of the historian Leopold von Ranke. In 1849 he edited in Erfurt Constitutionelle Zeitung, and in 1850-56 Erfurter Zeitung, in a royalist spirit. He later received a doctor of divinity degree from Vienna. According to his own statement, his Christian friends, and especially his study of the history of Israel, led him to Christianity. He was baptized as a member of Evangelical Church in Prussia on May 28, 1855 in the St. Peter's Church of B√º√üleben (now a locality of Erfurt), receiving the name \\"Paulus Stephanus.\\" In later years he celebrated May 28 as his \\"second birthday\\". He became librarian of the Royal Library in Erfurt and secretary of the Academy in Erfurt in the following year. He remained in Erfurt till 1859. King Frederick William IV bestowed the title of professor on Cassel in recognition of his loyal labors. In 1860 he removed to Berlin, where he was a teacher at a gymnasium for a short time, and occupied himself with literary work. He was briefly editor of the official Deutsche Reform. He delivered public lectures, which drew increasingly large audiences, both Jews and Gentiles. These lectures made him known throughout Berlin and the country. In 1866-1867 Cassel was a Conservative member of the Prussian House of Representatives, the second chamber of the Prussian parliament. He became a prominent member of the Conservative Party of Prussia. In 1867 Cassel was appointed missionary by the London Society for Promoting Christianity Amongst the Jews (a Jewish Christian missionary society now known as the Church's Ministry Among Jewish People or CMJ), a position which he retained till March 1891. At the same time (1867) Cassel was assigned to the pastorate of the Christuskirche in Berlin, with over a thousand sittings, erected from 1863 to 1864 by the Society on K√∂niggr√§tzer Stra√üe (renamed as Stresemannstra√üe, now in Kreuzberg's part of the Friedrichstadt quarter).The Christ Church was destroyed on 3 February 1945 in an American air raid, its successor building was erected on Hornstra√üe from 1963 to 1964. He remained in service there for twenty-four years. He traveled and lectured widely, as this excerpt from a published letter shows (\\"Thoughts on the Jewish Mission\\", 1887): > Invitations came to give lectures in places at a distance. A dear friend of > mine shewed me in 1860 a map of Germany, on which he marked all the towns in > which I have lectured. Since then I have delivered over a thousand original > lectures in Berlin and elsewhere. God's hand has guided me everywhere. My > journeys have extended from Amsterdam to Buda-Pesth. I always had an > attentive audience, and the poorer people in both large and small towns > heard the Word with gladness - nay, even with enthusiasm. He baptized 262 Jews in Christuskirche, among them doctors, authors, merchants. In a pamphlet published a short time before his death, he complained of the inconsiderate treatment he had received at the hands of his Christian friends (Erstes Sendschreiben an Freunde in Deutschland und England √ºber die Christuskirche in Berlin und ihr Martyrium durch die London Society, 1891). Hermann Leberecht Strack states that it is not clear what induced Cassel to join the Christian Church, though he contends that Cassel's reasons were obviously not mercenary. (See Herzog-Hauck, Real-Encyc. iii. 744). Cassel combated anti-Semitism with considerable warmth (in Wider Heinrich von Treitschke: F√ºr die Juden, 1880; Die Antisemiten und die evangelische Kirche: Sendschreiben an einen evangelischen Geistlichen, 1881; Ahasverus: Die Sage vom ewigen Juden; eine wissenschaftliche Abhandlung; mit einem kritischen Protest wider Ed. v. Hartmann und Adolf St√∂cker, 1885; also Der Judengott und Richard Wagner: Eine Antwort an die Bayreuther Bl√§tter; Zum 28. Mai 1881). He wrote and spoke against Adolf St√∂cker and Richard Wagner and other expressions of Protestant anti-Semitism during a period of its resurgence. In his Emancipation und Mission Cassel endeavored to show that the Jews would obtain permanent relief from persecution not by civil enfranchisement, but through evangelization. In later years, however, he frankly receded from this view. De le Roi, the historian of Christian propaganda among the Jews, says that Cassel was animated by \\"a very decided Jewish spirit.\\" In 1860 Cassel published Die Geschichte des J√ºdischen Volkes seit der Zerst√∂rung Jerusalems (History of the Jewish people since the destruction of Jerusalem). He exerted himself in the interest of proselytism among Jews. He stated his views on missionary work among them in the pamphlet entitled Wie ich √ºber Judenmission denke, 1886; see also Nathanael. Zeitschrift f√ºr die Arbeit der Evangelischen Kirche an Israel, edited by Strack, 1897. From 1875 to 1889 he edited the weekly Sunem, ein Berliner Wochenblatt f√ºr christliches Leben und Wissen (16 vols.). Hallelujah! Einhundertundachtundachtzig geistliche Lieder is a collection of hymns reprinted from this journal. In 1847 Cassel wrote an earnest though somewhat fantastic study of Hungarian archaeology, Magyarische Alterth√ºmer, which long remained of value. Of especial interest is his translation (with notes) of the reply to Chisdai ben Isaac of Joseph, king of the Khazars (pp. 183 et seq.). Cassel died at Friedenau near Berlin, his last words being, \\"Wo ist denn das Himmelreich?\\" (Where is it, the kingdom of heaven?) His grave is preserved in the Protestant Friedhof I der Jerusalems- und Neuen Kirchengemeinde (Cemetery No. I of the congregations of Jerusalem's Church and New Church) in Kreuzberg, south of Halle Gate. According to the Allgemeine Zeitung des Judenthums, > When the anti-Semites began to show themselves, Cassel remembered his > origin, and opposed the leaders, St√∂cker, Wagner, and others with great > decision and manliness. It was this manly action that gives us some > satisfaction for his desertion of the parental religion. We have to judge > this apostasy very differently from that of many others in former and > present times, as he did not forsake his old creed for any worldly reason, > or to get honors and position, but rather because he followed a mystical > line of thought. God alone can judge the veracity and purity of his life; we > dare not. 'Peace be to his ashes!' ==History of the Jews== Cassel's only methodic work is his history of the Jews from the destruction of Jerusalem to 1847 (Geschichte der Juden seit der Eroberung und Zerst√∂rung Jerusalems und seines Heiligthums durch die R√∂mer bis zum Jahre 1847. Eine wissenschaftliche Skizze; \\"Juden [Geschichte]\\", in: Allgemeine Encyclopaedie der Wissenschaften und K√ºnste). This scientific treatment of Jewish history he wrote before his conversion, and it is signed \\"Selig Cassel.\\" Isaak Markus Jost, however, says of it: \\"It is one-sided and merely gives episodes out of the life of Jews in various countries. It is collated in a fragmentary manner, though rich in erudite notes\\"Isaak Markus Jost, Geschichte des Judenthums und seiner Secten: 8 books in 3 parts, Leipzig: D√∂rffling & Franke, 1857‚Äì1859, part 3 'books 6‚Äì8' (1859), p. 365. Sabbathliche Erinnerungen was also published before Cassel's conversion ‚Äî the first part anonymously, the second (signed \\"S. C.\\" in the preface) being put forth for the benefit of indigent veterans of 1813‚Äì1815 German Liberation Wars. ==Biblical studies== Cassel's Biblical studies are conservative; and it is surprising that he neglected to use the fund of rabbinical lore he undoubtedly possessed. In 1865 he wrote Das Buch der Richter und Ruth for Johann Peter Lange's Theologisch-Homiletisches Bibelwerk. A second edition was translated into English in 1872. In 1878 appeared Das Buch Esther: Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte des Morgenlandes; aus dem Hebr√§ischen √ºbersetzt, historisch und theologisch erl√§utert, section 1, with an appendix, a translation of the Second Targum. The original text of the Second Targum Cassel published in Aus Litteratur und Geschichte und Geschichte: Abhandlungen von D. Paulus Cassel, 1885: \\"Zweites Targum zum Buche Esther: Im vocalisirten Urtext mit sachlichen und sprachlichen Erl√§uterungen herausgegeben.\\" An English translation by Aaron Bernstein was published in Edinburgh in 1888. This English edition also gives translations of several of Cassel's essays; viz., \\"Mithra\\" (pp. 345‚Äì361), \\"The Winged Bulls of Persepolis\\" (pp. 362‚Äì377), and \\"Zoroaster\\" (pp. 378‚Äì400). Most of Cassel's other literary work partakes of the character of controversy. His larger work on Weihnachten, Urspr√ºnge, Br√§uche, und Aberglauben: Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte der Christlichen Kirche und des deutschen Volkes (1861), is a medley of ingenious but unsystematized erudition, and is pervaded by a tone of pious emotionalism. Altogether, Cassel's versatility has secured him merely the admiration of his contemporaries. He was incapable of acquiring a position of influence in the church of his adoption. His more general works are: Vom Wege nach Damaskus, Apologetische Abhandlungen, 1872; Aus guter Stunde, Betrachtungen und Erinnerungen, 1874; F√ºr ernste Stunden, Betrachtungen und Erinnerungen, 2d ed., 1881; Aus Literatur und Symbolik: Abhandlungen, 1884; Aus Literatur und Geschichte, 1885; Vom Nil zum Ganges, Wanderungen in die Orientalische Welt, 1880; and Das Leben des Menschen in Geschichte und Symbol, 1893. Besides, Cassel wrote a large number of pamphlets on theological, ethnological, and philological subjects. ==Works== * Ahasverus: Die Sage vom ewigen Juden; eine wissenschaftliche Abhandlung; mit einem kritischen Protest wider Ed. v.

She has performed as the lead vocalist for two major label bands, the Vels and Die Monster Die. The Vels were the more commercially successful of the two, with their 1984 single \\"Look My Way\\" peaking at No. 72 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. Cohen has also pursued a solo career and has released six studio albums since 2008. ==Early years== Cohen grew up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the daughter of two professional jazz pianists, Robert Cohen (died 2019) and Harriet Levin Cohen (died 2002). Her father Robert was a respected figure in the Philadelphia jazz community, having performed for decades in the area, and he also had a chance performance with highly influential saxophonist Charlie Parker. ==Career== ===The Vels=== Cohen is best known for her work as the primary songwriter and lead singer of the Vels, a Philadelphia new wave band that she co-founded in 1980. In 1984, they signed a recording contract with Mercury Records and released two studio albums, Velocity (1984) and House of Miracles (1986). They had one minor hit (\\"Look My Way\\") and a successful MTV music video. The Vels toured the U.S. in 1986, opening for British band the Psychedelic Furs.> ==Musical history== In 1980, Cohen wrote the disco song \\"Deetour\\" for Karen Young which was then released as a single in 1982, re-released on Horse Meat Disco in July 2009. To date this is the only time that she has written a song for someone else. The track \\"Souvenirs\\" was originally written for the Bangles but the recording deal failed to materialise and the song was instead recorded for the Vels' second album House of Miracles. After the Vels broke up in 1987, Cohen's career changed direction and she became active in the indie rock/underground and touring scene. Cohen's best-known venture in this period was the band Die Monster Die. DMD released two studio albums: 1992's Chrome Molly on Dutch East, and 1994's Withdrawal Method on Roadrunner Records. The band broke up soon after. (N.B. In 2000, another band, founded in Salt Lake City in 1995 as Casa Diablo, renamed itself DieMonsterDie; this band is unrelated to the band Cohen was in.) In 1996, Cohen sang a track (on camera) in the Martin Scorsese- produced movie Grace of My Heart (1996), directed by Allison Anders. In recent years, Cohen has performed frequently as a solo act, as well as collaborating with a number of groups including LYDSOD, Long Lost, Raw Thrills, Castles, and Espadrille. In 2008, she released her debut solo studio album Sky Flowers on her self-owned label Crinoline. Other solo studio albums include Walking Up Walls (2009), Pink Keys (2012), Wild Vines & Tenement Shrines (2013), Into the Grey Salons (2016), and her most recent album Artificial Fairytales (2019). With the release of Cohen's solo albums, she became active in video and animation, creating music videos to accompany her own releases, as well as composing soundtracks for other animations and video projects. ==Visual arts== Cohen's collages and paintings have appeared in galleries in New York City, San Francisco and elsewhere. She has made music videos for dozens of indie bands and musicians. In 2008, Cohen began to produce animated music videos for artists such as Ducktails, Coasting, Broken Deer, and Greatest Hits, using found imagery and objects in traditional cutout and stop motion animation style. Other video/animation work includes \\"Single Sentence Animations\\" for the independent publisher Electric Literature as well as gallery and installation work. Cohen animated 17 episodes of the 2016 TV show Single + Swiping for Full Screen Network. In 2010, Cohen had her first solo exhibition of visual works including video, collage, and installation, which took place at Live With Animals gallery in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Her work has been screened at Anthology Film Archives, The Film-Makers' Cooperative, Printed Matter, Inc., Microscope Gallery, Millennium Film Workshop, The New Museum, the Morbid Anatomy Museum, and the Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw, Poland. ==Discography== ===Solo releases=== * Sky Flowers (2008) (Crinoline Records) * Walking Up Walls (2009) (Olde English Spelling Bee) * Pink Keys (2012) (Olde English Spelling Bee & Crinoline Records) * Wild Vines & Tenement Shrines (2013) (Sixteen Tambourines Records) * Into the Grey Salons (2016) (Olde English Spelling Bee & Crinoline Records) * Artificial Fairytales (2019) (NNA Tapes) ===With the Vels (Mercury Records)=== * Velocity (1984) * \\"Private World/Hieroglyphics 12\\" Dub\\" (1984) * \\"Look My Way/Tell Me Something 12\\" Dub\\" (1984) * House of Miracles (1986) * \\"Girl Most Likely To 12\\" Dub\\" (1986) ===With Die Monster Die=== * \\"Planet b/w Blackwater Trailer Park Blue\\" 7\\" (Deadbolt Records) (1992) * \\"Slumber b/w Pennies\\" 7\\" (Roadrunner Records) (1993) * \\"Barknuckle b/w Wallflower Garden\\" 7\\" (Funky Mushroom Records) (1993) * \\"Chrome Molly\\" (Johnson Brothers Music/Dutch East India Trading) (1993) * \\"Withdrawal Method\\" (Roadrunner Records) (1994) ===With Espadrille (Spare Me Records)=== * \\"Swimmeret\\" (2001) * \\" Bikini Girl\\" b/w Hollow Sidewalk 7\\" (1999) ===With Moroccos=== * \\"3D Sound B/W Soul Safari\\" 7\\" (t.m.i Products) (1982) * \\"t.m.i. 015 A Compilation\\" (t.m.i Products) (1982) ===With Helivator (Lungcast)=== * \\"Gasoline T-Shirt\\" (1994) ===Appearing on=== * \\"Radio Scenic Glow Vol. 1\\" (Upstairs) (2009) * \\"Africa Germany Germany Mexico Turkey Australia\\" (Olde English Spelling Bee) (2009) * \\"Breakout\\" (Chrysalis Records) (1979) * \\"Deetour\\" (songwriter) (Atlantic Records) (1980) * \\"Greetings From Port Authority\\" Benna Evil Teen Records (1996) * \\"The Best of Nilsson\\" BMG (1998) ==Filmography== ===Music videos=== *\\"Landrunner\\" ‚Äî Ducktails (2009) *\\"Ichthus Hop\\" ‚Äî Talbot Tagora (2009) *\\"Black Pepper\\" ‚Äî Alice Cohen (2009) *\\"Memories of Glaciers\\" ‚Äî Alice Cohen (2009) *\\"White Woman\\" ‚Äî Broken Deer (2010) *\\"Kids\\" ‚Äî Coasting (2010) *\\"Ambulance\\" ‚Äî Greatest Hits (2010) *\\"Totem\\" ‚Äî Weekends (2010) *\\"Marsupial Shenanigans\\" ‚Äî Linda Hagood (2010) *\\"The Gutter\\" ‚Äî K-Holes (2011) *\\"The Phantom's Theme\\" ‚Äî Ruckus Roboticus (2013) *\\"Black Magic\\" ‚Äî Maria Minerva (2013) ===Art videos=== *\\"Spools\\" (2009) *\\"Trance Actions\\" (2010) *\\"Mirror Moves for Private Eyes\\" (2010) *\\"Ear Candy\\" (2010) *\\"For Claire\\" (2011) *\\"Perfumes of Venus\\" (2014) *\\"Elegant Interiors\\" (2014) *\\"Spirit of the Magpie\\" (2015) ===Other commissioned work=== *\\"Three Girls\\" ‚Äî Single Sentence Animation for Electric Literature (2009) *\\"Baba Iaga and the Pelican Child\\" ‚Äî Single Sentence Animation for Electric Literature (2010) *The BJ Rubin Show ‚Äî Cable Access Television Show (2014‚Äì2016) *Single + Swiping ‚Äî TV Docu-series (Full Screen Media Network) (2016) ==References== ==External links== * * * * Interview with Alice Cohen in the Philadelphia City Paper * Foxy Digitalis review of Walking Up Walls album * The Deli review of Sky Flowers album Category:1958 births Category:20th-century American singers Category:20th-century American women singers Category:21st-century American singers Category:21st-century American women singers Category:American electronic musicians Category:American female singer-songwriters Category:American female pop singers Category:American pop singers Category:American female rock singers Category:Atlantic Records artists Category:American women in electronic music Category:American rock songwriters Category:American people of Austrian descent Category:Sarah Lawrence College alumni Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Musicians from Philadelphia Category:Chrysalis Records artists Category:Mercury Records artists Category:Roadrunner Records artists Category:Bertelsmann Music Group artists ","title":"Alice Cohen"},{"id":"11653990","text":"WKOS (104.9 FM), branded as \\"104.9 Nash Icon\\", is a radio station serving the Tri-Cities, Tennessee, area with country music.

The refinery at Mongstad is modern, and has been extensively upgraded, with a capacity of 12 million tonnes of crude oil per year (230,000 barrels per day). The refinery is the largest in Norway, though medium-sized by European standards. It is owned by a company called Mongstad Refining, in which Statoil has whole ownership (since 2012).Statoil - Mongstad Facilities All the crude oil refined at Mongstad comes from the North Sea. The largest production is petrol, diesel, jet fuel, and light petroleum products. The heaviest components are used to make petrol coke, an important ingredient in anodes for aluminum production. In 2010, Statoil and DONG Energy opened the Mongstad Power Station, a natural gas-fired thermal power plant, to provide the site with heat energy and electricity, as well as power to the Troll gas field. ==History== The first use of the site was in 1975, when Statoil opened its refinery. At the end of the 1980s, the refinery was expanded to the tune of , resulting in the Mongstad scandal after a overexpenditure on the facility, costing several Statoil executives their jobs.

Protozoans of this order include parasites of humans, and both domesticated and wild animals including birds. Among these parasites are the Toxoplasma gondii that cause toxoplasmosis and Isospora belli, which results in isosporiasis. ==Definition== This is the largest order in the class Conoidasida and contains those species that all undergo merogony (asexual), gametogony (sexual) and sporogony (spore formation) during their lifecycles. ==Genera== Nineteen families, three subfamilies, and 70 genera are recognised in this order. The genera include: Adelea, Adelina, Aggregata, Alveocystis, Atoxoplasma, Babesiosoma, Barrouxia, Bartazoon, Besnoitia, Calyptospora, Caryospora, Caryotropha, Chagasella, Choleoeimeria, Cryptosporidium, Crystallospora, Cyclospora, Cyrilia, Cystoisospora, Dactylosoma, Desseria, Diaspora, Dorisa, Dorisiella, Eimeria, Elleipsisoma, Epieimeria, Frenkelia, Ganapatiella, Gibbsia, Goussia, Gousseffia, Grasseella, Hammondia, Haemogregarina, Hemolivia, Hepatozoon, Heydornia, Hoarella, Hyaloklossia, Isospora, Ithania, Karyolysus, Klossia, Klossiella, Lankesterella, Legerella, Margolisiella, Mantonella, Merocystis, Nephroisospora, Neospora, Octosporella, Orcheobius, Ovivora, Pfeifferinella, Polysporella, Pseudoklossia, Pythonella, Rasajeyna, Sarcocystis, Schellackia, Selenococcidium, Selysina, Sivatoshella, Skrjabinella, Spirocystis, Toxoplasma, Tyzzeria, Wenyonella Among the heteroxenous and cyst-forming genera are: Besnoitia, Cystoisospora, Frenkelia, Hammondia, Neospora, Sarcocystis, and Toxoplasma. ==Taxonomy== The taxonomy of this group is complex and only partly understood.

The title refers to Quentins Restaurant, a fictional upscale dining establishment in central Dublin, Ireland. The restaurant was referenced numerous times in previous Binchy titles; this novel explores its 30-year history as well as the lives of its patrons. The novel was produced as a BBC Word for Word audiobook in 2003. ==Plot== Ella Brady, a young science teacher, falls in love with a handsome, suave businessman (Don Richardson) who is married but assures her that his marriage is \\"dead\\". For some time she is happy with the torrid affair, and manages to overlook some inconsistencies in what he tells her. Until the moment when he is exposed as a corrupt swindler and runs away out of the country and out of her life ‚Äì leaving Ella, her family, and many people in Dublin without their savings. Ella is disgraced and quits her teaching job to work more than 60 hours a week at Quentins restaurant, with the Scarlet Feather catering company, and with a film crew, to help out her family. The book mostly concentrates on Ella's attempt to get funding for her friends' film company for a documentary about the restaurant Quentins. She struggles to get over Richardson, whom she still loves, and with whether or not to give the fraud squad access to a laptop he left in her possession. Eventually, her efforts to get funding lead her to meet a new man, Derry King, an American businessman with an Irish heritage which he hates because of the way his drunken Irish father treated him and his mother. Smaller plot points revolve around the background of Patrick and Brenda Brennan (the managers of Quentins), Ella's girlfriends Deirdre and Nuala, and many of the regulars at the restaurant; the main plot is interspersed with various vignettes in the lives of people who had been in contact with the restaurant in one way or another, these interweaving with each other and with Ella Brady's life in various unpredictable ways. ==Themes== The novel explores themes of love, family, friendship, and the benefits of hard and honest work. It also examines the \\"economy-driven Ireland\\" of the late 20th and early 21st century, as well as themes of celibacy and infertility. The idea of Dublin as a village rather than a city is reinforced, as Binchy reveals it to be \\"a place where everyone knows everyone and no one's secrets are safe\\". ==Recurring characters== Quentins features appearances by characters from previous Binchy novels, including: *Nora O'Donoghue and Aidan Dunne from Evening Class *Brenda and Patrick Brennan from Evening Class *Tom Feather, Cathy Scarlet, and Maud and Simon Mitchell, from Scarlet Feather *Ria Lynch and Colm Barry from Tara Road On a humorous note, the novel also explains why the name Quentins is spelled without an apostrophe. ==Publishing history== Quentins is Binchy's 13th book. In 2000 she announced that her upcoming novel, Scarlet Feather, would be her last; she also retired as a columnist at The Irish Times. While she decided to forego writing \\"big novels\\", with Quentins she continued producing short stories that link together to advance the plot.

Brackman was represented by sports agent Scott Boras. He is listed as 6 foot 10 inches tall and weighs 230 pounds. ==High school career== Brackman attended Moeller High School in Cincinnati, Ohio. ==College career== Andrew Brackman playing basketball for North Carolina State University Brackman attended North Carolina State University where he played two seasons as a dual-sport athlete, in basketball and baseball. During his freshman basketball season (2004‚Äì2005), he played center and forward averaging 7.4 points and 3.5 rebounds. In his freshman baseball season, he was 4-0 with a 2.09 ERA in 10 appearances as both a reliever and later, as a starting pitcher. He was starting pitcher of the first game of the 2005 ACC Baseball Tournament, striking out five batters in seven innings to earn the victory against the Miami Hurricanes. He was named a second-team preseason All-America player by Baseball America for 2006. After the Wolfpack was defeated in the 2006 NCAA tournament second round by Texas, Brackman chose not to return to the basketball team the next season, and instead focused on developing his pitching with hopes of doing well in professional baseball. Brackman suffered a stress fracture to his hip in his sophomore year of baseball limiting him to only seven games and a disappointing 1-4 record with a 6.09 ERA. In the summer of that year, he pitched for the Orleans Cardinals in the Cape Cod League earning a 1-0 record with a 1.09 ERA. This effort led to Baseball America ranking him the league's number two prospect. Brackman's junior year at NC State saw a return to his freshman-year numbers: in 13 games he struck out 74 batters in 78 innings with a 3.81 ERA and a record of 6-4, but due to elbow injuries, he did not pitch in either the ACC nor the NCAA tournament. ==Professional career== ===New York Yankees=== Brackman's injury record hurt his draft value, and he was not selected until the 30th pick of the 2007 Major League Baseball Draft. Following the draft, the Yankees signed Brackman to a guaranteed $4.5 million deal for four years including a $3.55 million signing bonus spread out over six years. The club also held options over Brackman for the 2011, 2012, and 2013 seasons which would have boosted the total value of his contract over $13 million if he met his bonus requirements. As specified by his contract, the Yankees placed Brackman on the 40 man roster. The Yankees recommended that he see Dr. James Andrews in Alabama to address his lingering elbow concerns. Later in August 2007, he underwent Tommy John surgery. Brackman began the 2008 season on the 60-day disabled list, a procedural move to keep him on the 40-man roster.

In April 1942 it became a military psychiatric hospital and became known as Northfield Military Hospital. In 1942, while Northfield was serving as a military hospital, psychoanalysts Wilfred Bion and John Rickman set up the first Northfield experiment. Bion and Rickman were in charge of the training and rehabilitation wing of Northfield, and ran the unit along the principles of group dynamics. Their aim was to improve morale by creating a \\"good group spirit\\" (esprit de corps). Though he sounded like a traditional army officer Bion's means were very unconventional. He was in charge of around one hundred men. He told them that they had to do an hour's exercise every day and that each had to join a group: \\"handicrafts, Army courses, carpentry, map-reading, sand-tabling etc.... or form a fresh group if he wanted to do so\\". While this may have looked like traditional occupational therapy, the real therapy was the struggle to manage the interpersonal strain of organising things together, rather than simply weaving baskets. Those unable to join a group would have to go to the rest-room, where a nursing orderly would supervise a quiet regime of \\"reading, writing or games such as draughts... any men who felt unfit for any activity whatever could lie down\\".

The poem is of modern non-Native origin, and is fake folklore (fakelore). The poem was originally written in 1947 by the non-Native author Elliott Arnold in his Western novel Blood Brother. The novel features Apache culture, but the poem itself is an invention of the author's, and is not based on any traditions of the Apache, Cherokee or any other Native American culture.Blood Brothers, 1979, introduction: ‚ÄúThere is no record of [Jeffords and an Apache girl] ever marrying, but‚Ä¶ knowing the basically simple process of an Apache wedding, I have taken a writer‚Äôs liberty and imagined that such a wedding took place. The entire story of Jeffords and [the Apache girl] Sonseeahray is pure fiction and every detail of it was invented, against a known historical background.‚Äù The poem was popularized by the 1950 film adaptation of the novel, Broken Arrow, scripted by Albert Maltz, and the depiction of the marriage is criticized as a \\"Hollywood fantasy\\" (Hollywood Indian stereotype).Mead, p. 136 ==Poem== The poem, in its original form in the 1947 novel, begins \\"Now for you there is no rain / For one is shelter to the other\\" and ends \\"Now there is no loneliness. / Now, forever, forever, there is no loneliness\\". The poem is not associated with any particular religion (aside from being misrepresented as Native American) and does not mention a deity or include a petition, only a wish. The 1950 film text begins \\"Now you will feel no rain\\" and ends \\"Go now. Ride the white horses to your secret place.\\"Broken Arrow Full Movie 1950 There are now numerous variations of the poem, generally based on the film, rather than the novel.Mead p. 136 One modern form ends with \\"May happiness be your companion and your days together be good and long upon the earth.\\" ==Criticism== The Economist, citing Rebecca Mead's book on American weddings,Rebecca Mead, One Perfect Day: The Selling of the American Wedding, 2007, characterized it as \\"'traditionalesque', commerce disguised as tradition\\".\\"American weddings: Beware the bridezilla monster\\", The Economist.

She is best known for featuring on the Tom Zanetti track \\"You Want Me\\", which peaked at number #22 on the UK Singles Chart. Sadie stated in 2005 that Aaliyah and her sister Shola Ama were both her inspirations. Sadie grew up around music, with her sister Shola Ama having an ongoing R&B; career, and her mum was a singer in a jazz group called Clamber. She has stated that Shola Ama helped teach her how to write music. Katy B said in 2016 that she was a 'massive fan' of Sadie Ama. == Career == Sadie Ama began her career as a model at the young age of 4. The first music video she modelled in was \\"Mama\\" by the Spice Girls in 1997, wherein she acted as a young Mel B. She later stated it was embarrassing to look back on in a 2007 BBC interview, although at the time it was great since she was a Spice Girls fan. She also modelled in Lemar's video for \\"50:50\\", and in So Solid's video for \\"Broken Silence\\". In 2005, she signed up for Arts Council which provided her funding for music. Sadie had wanted to be a singer when she was younger, but never properly pursued it until she met up with Terror Danjah (a grime producer), her friends cousin, who gave her a track for her to sing on. A year later in 2006, she finally released the song titled \\"So Sure\\" featuring grime MC Kano and produced by Terror Danjah. Her sister Shola Ama was active in helping her write songs and teaching her how to make music. She was only 15 at the time it was released. She stated in an interview that the pressures and anxiety were a lot for her at the time, and put a pause on music as a result, instead opting to go to college. In 2007, she was voted in at #4 on the BBC's Sound of 2007 poll. The poll was determined via tips from over 130 critics and broadcasters, and was intended to show rising talent. She was also nominated for \\"Best UK Newcomer\\" at the 2007 MOBO Awards. Her first single, \\"Fallin'\\", reached #67 on the UK Singles Chart in 2007.

The bacterium is a close relative of Bartonella quintana, the microbe which caused trench fever in thousands of soldiers during World War I. Named after Brazilian scientist Henrique da Rocha Lima, B. rochalimae is also closely related to Bartonella henselae, a bacterium identified in the mid-1990s during the AIDS epidemic in San Francisco as the cause of cat scratch fever, which still infects more than 24,000 people in the United States each year. Scientists discovered the bacterium in a 43-year-old American woman who had traveled to Peru for three weeks. She suffered from possibly life-threatening anemia, an enlarged spleen, a 102 degree Fahrenheit (39 degree Celsius) fever, and insomnia two weeks after returning to the United States, symptoms akin to those of typhoid fever and malaria. The patient's sickness was first attributed to Bartonella bacilliformis, a known related species with a similar appearance under a microscope that is spread by sand flies and infects 10% of the human population in some regions of Peru with Oroya fever. Antibiotic treatment based on this diagnosis rapidly cured her infection, but further investigation proved the bacteria were of a formerly unknown species. It is possible that other cases diagnosed as Oroya fever result from this species. The findings were published in the New England Journal of Medicine on June 7, 2007. In this same year, Bartonella rochalimae was also isolated from 3 dogs and 22 gray foxes in a rural area of Humboldt County along the Trinity River corridor near the town of Hoopa in northern California, USA. The authors temporarily named the new organism as Bartonella clarridgeiae-like since it was closely related to B. clarridgeiae, and no official name was yet suggested. The discovery was performed at the Department of Population Health and Reproduction, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis, and it was published in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology in 2007. In March 2009, a report of a dog with endocarditis due to Bartonella rochalimae was published in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology. The 9-year-old male, neutered shepherd mix from San Francisco was referred to the University of California, Davis, in January 2000 due to lameness and obtunded mentation. Endocarditis was confirmed by echocardiography, and the dog died in August 2000. Analysis of the damaged aortic valve indicated that the dog was infected with a new Bartonella species, later confirmed to be Bartonella rochalimae by DNA analysis. According to the authors, this was the first time that B. rochalimae was identified in domestic and wild animals and the first report of B. rochalimae isolation from mammals in North America. In May 2009, Bartonella rochalimae was also identified by DNA sequencing infecting a sick dog at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. The discovery was made at the Vector Borne Diseases and Diagnostic Laboratory of the North Carolina State University, College of Veterinary Medicine, and was published in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology. In July 2009, Bartonella rochalimae was also identified in fleas from cats and dogs from Chile. The organisms was detected by DNA amplification performed at the Special Pathogens Laboratory of the √Årea de Enfermedades Infecciosas of the Hospital San Pedro, La Rioja, Spain, and it was published in the Emerging Infectious Diseases journal. ==References== ==External links== *Type strain of Bartonella rochalimae at BacDive - the Bacterial Diversity Metadatabase Category:Bartonellaceae Category:Bacteria described in 2007 ","title":"Bartonella rochalimae"},{"id":"11654325","text":"William John Sweeney (born 5 January 1950) is a Scottish composer. ==Biography== Born in Glasgow, he attended Knightswood Secondary School. He studied the clarinet and composition at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama from 1967 to 1970, and at the Royal Academy of Music from 1970 to 1973, where his teachers included Alan Hacker and Harrison Birtwistle. He went on to teach woodwind instruments, and then composition at the University of Glasgow. An early influence was the European avant-garde, particularly Karlheinz Stockhausen, though he returned to tonal composition in the mid-1970s. His work is strongly influenced by traditional Scottish folk music; in particular, he has utilised the heterophonic style of Gaelic psalm-singing, and the piobaireachd form; he varies melodies through ornamentation, as in traditional pibroch, and in their contour; he modifies instruments' tone- colours through alternative fingerings. He has a strong regard for the music of Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek. He has also addressed the reconciliation of classical and traditional music with jazz, using improvisational techniques and sometimes combining the two idioms. He has been influenced by ancient Greek poetry, and Indian and Arab traditions in his use of ostinato and other techniques of varied repetition.

Niabi Zoo offers 40+ acres bustling with more than 600 animals representing 200 species from around the world and is open for general admission April‚ÄìOctober annually. Niabi offers robust education and outreach programs year round. Niabi is one of six facilities owned and operated by the Rock Island County Forest Preserve District. == History == The zoo's name \\"Niabi\\" comes from the Osage Nation language and means \\"young deer spared by the hunter.\\" Niabi Zoo traces its history back to 1959, when local masonry contractor and animal lover, Gordon V. McLain, opened McLain's Wild Animal Farm to the public. It operated as a privately owned zoo for several years until Patti S. Wiman (1895‚Äì1976) purchased the farm and some surrounding land in 1963 and deeded it to the Rock Island County Forest Preserve District, which owns and operates it as a non-profit community attraction to this day. After the zoo reopened to the public as a property of the Rock Island County Forest Preserve District, slow but steady improvements began to take shape. The zoo held its first Zoofari Ball fundraiser in 1972, and opened what was then called the ‚Äúpetting zoo‚Äù (now Domestic Animals) in 1974. One of the most popular attractions ‚Äì the train ride ‚Äì accepted its first passengers in the spring of 1975. The 1970s also saw the establishment of the adopt-an-animal program. This program allows guests to directly support their favorite animals at the zoo. The 1980s were an exciting time for Niabi Zoo. They opened the cat house in 1983, the education center in 1984 and the bird house (now the Biodiversity Hall) in 1985. In 1986 Niabi launched its official zoo volunteer program with 40 new volunteers. The 2000s marked a huge and exciting blossoming of available guest experiences and improvements to animal welfare. In 2003, Niabi opened the bald eagle exhibit, and in 2004, it built the animal care center, Niabi's first on-grounds hospital facility for the medical treatment of its animals. In 2005, the Gibbon exhibit opened, along with the Australian exhibit and the nutrition center where all of the animal diets are prepared and food is stored. 2007 and 2008 saw the addition of Passport to Africa and a new exhibit for the critically endangered red wolf. In 2011, the Zoo opened its new entry plaza and administration building to welcome guests and provide space for growing education programs. 2016 saw an increased focus on the park's aging infrastructure. While new exhibits were built and remodeled, Niabi also turned significant attention to repairing and replacing the water system, repairing and replacing other inadequate systems, and raising the standards of the entire experience to levels befitting a modern zoological park in the 21st century. 2017 brought renovations to the Reptile House, and new animals such as alpaca, mini donkeys, bactrican camels, aldabra tortoise, yellow-backed duikers and magean geese. As part of a rotating exhibit space, Niabi also open ‚ÄòOceans‚Äô in 2017 which featured over 50 aquatic species including seahorse and a Giant Pacific Octopus. The educational and outreach programs and volunteer program saw huge improvements as well this year. In 2018, Niabi added a pair of Pallas Cats. == Exhibits & Animals == Australian Walkabout: Walk-thru exhibit of rainbow lorikeets, Vivian the black swan, and an aviary of parakeets. Guests are able to feed the birds under staff supervision. Africa: Various areas around the zoo are home to animals from Africa. A main attraction, Passport to Africa includes a reticulated giraffe habitat featuring a male, Kenya, and a female, Twigga, that guests may feed under staff supervision. Inside the giraffe house is the home of a mixed primate exhibit, Wolf's Guenon and Allen's Swamp Monkey. Near the giraffe house are yards for plains zebras, ostriches, aldabra tortoises Charlotte and Wilbur, and Gabe the Dromedary. Asia: Around the zoo, species from Asia can be seen, including two Bactrian camels named Taj and Fergie, and white-cheeked gibbon, Max and CJ, with plans for future attractions. Biodiversity Hall: Previously called the \\"bird house,\\" the Biodiversity Hall is home to several species including fennec foxes, slender-tailed meerkats, Cleo the African porcupine, Rosie the binturong, and Bob the ball python. Big Cat habitat: Home to Bobcats Frick and Frack, Snow leopards, and two subspecies of Leopard, two African Leopards, and a critically endangered Amur leopard named Zeke.

The basic Anka-A is classified as a Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) UAV. Envisioned in the early 2000s for tactical surveillance and reconnaissance missions, the Anka has now evolved into a modular platform with synthetic aperture radar, precise weapons and satellite communication. The drone is named after a phoenix-like mythological creature called Z√ºmr√ºd-√º Anka (Anka ku≈üu in Turkish.) ==Design== Anka in flight The TUAV system consists of three air vehicles (A/V), Ground Control Station (GCS), Ground Data Terminal (GDT), Automatic Take-off, and Landing System (ATOLS), Transportable Image Exploitation System (TIES), Remote Video Terminal (RVT) and various Ground Support Equipment (GSE). The TUAV system, which is designed for night and day missions including adverse weather conditions, performs real-time image intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, moving/stationery target detection, recognition, identification, and tracking missions. While the TUAV system has an open architecture to support other potential payloads and missions, within the context of the existing project the air vehicle is configured to carry the following payloads on board: * Electro-optic Color Day Camera (EO Day TV) * Electro-optic/Forward Looking Infrared/Laser rangefinder/Laser Designator and Spotter Camera (EO/FLIR/LRF/LDS) * Synthetic Aperture Radar/Ground Moving Target Indicator (SAR/GMTI) * Inverse SAR (ISAR) The whole composite airframe is composed of a monoblock fuselage, detachable wing and V-Tail, retractable landing gear, redundant control surfaces, avionics and payload bays and service doors. The sandwich skin structure is reinforced by composite or metallic frames, ribs, and supports. Propelled by a pusher type heavy fuel engine, the aircraft is furnished with fuselage fuel tanks and fuel system, ice protection system, environmental control system, lighting system, redundant electrical system with battery backup, and harness system. The platform is also equipped with a digital flight control system, electro-mechanical actuators, and flight control sensor systems such as GPS, pitot-static, air data computer, navigation sensor, transducers, temperature, pressure, displacement sensors, etc. Various tasks are distributed along flight management computers and auxiliary control boxes. Identification and communication units and interface computers are employed in order to establish real time wide band communication and provide test and diagnostics functions. An air traffic radio is also integrated in the communication system for the integration of the aircraft into the civilian airspace. All flight critical equipment are dual or triple redundant and emergency modes of operational scenarios are taken into consideration for fail safe design. All airborne and ground-based flight control software is developed by TAI while payload and other relevant hardware and software items are aimed to be developed by national sub-contractors, such as Aselsan, AYESAS, and MilSOFT. UAV operations are supported by highly sophisticated ground control system with complete redundancy, developed by a domestic defence company Savronik.Unmanned Air Vehicle Ground Control Station Shelter , Savronik. Retrieved 1 July 2011. Whole mission segments of the air vehicle can be managed, monitored and controlled by a GCS. A pre-programmed mission plan can be loaded before the flight begins or can be altered during the flight. All the imagery stream of the payloads can be displayed and recorded in real time and all the payloads can be controlled from the GCS. ATOLS allows the air vehicle to perform its operation without operator intervention, including the most critical phases which are landing and take-off. In TIES, valuable intelligence information can be obtained by the analysis of bulky imagery data. TIES operators can initiate intelligence missions prior to or during flight. Refined information flows to the upper command layer in order to assist the headquarters to monitor a network of TUAV systems and benefit from the gathered intelligence information. Another interface of the TUAV system is the RVT, with which other friendly units who are close to the target area can utilize the real time imagery that TUAV air vehicle broadcasts. ==Development== Anka at Teknofest 2019 The contract regarding the development of an indigenous Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system for the reconnaissance requirements of the Turkish Armed Forces became effective on 24 December 2004. Within the framework of the program, a total of three prototypes and ground systems will be designed, developed, manufactured, and tested by mid-2011 as part of the prototype development phase. Subsequently, in 2012, the serial production phase of Anka-A would be launched and additional 10 systems (meaning 30 air vehicles) built for the Turkish Air Force. * On 30 December 2010, the first TAI Anka unmanned aerial vehicle completed its debut flight, with 14 minutes of cruising, at 15:45 local time. It crashed after 15 minutes. Defence Minister Vecdi G√∂n√ºl confirmed the flight.\\"First flight of Anka took place last week, on Thursday\\", stated Defence Minister Vecdi Gonul , Zaman, Retrieved 4 January 2011 * On 5 May 2011, TAI released the test flight video of Anka. Anka-A flew a test and calibration mission of 2h 30m. * Turkish Aerospace Industries announced on 25 October 2011 that the Anka had successfully completed its subsequent flight and landing tests and that it will now be in the Turkish Air Force inventory in 2012 that is much earlier than expected. Footage released by TAI also shows the Anka landing successfully putting all speculation abouts its crash landings to rest. * On 22 November 2011, the Anka held the follow-up test flight for 6 hours at 20,000 ft. The vehicle demonstrated its automatic take- off and landing system for the first time. * On 5 January 2012, Defence Industry Executive Committee authorized Undersecretariat for Defence Industries to commence talks with Turkish Aerospace Industries for the serial production of 10 Anka vehicles. * On 27 September 2012, an Anka prototype crashed during a flight test due to a technical problem. * On 20 January 2013, Anka completed acceptance tests by the Turkish Air Force. The final acceptance tests were conducted near Ankara, and involved an 18‚Äëhour‚Äëlong, 200 km ring flight. The tests also included a night landing in adverse weather conditions. The Anka has flown more than 140 hours and reached and altitude of 26,000 feet. * On 13 May 2013, the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex, Kamra handed over the first batch of Anka UAV parts to Turkish Aerospace Industries during IDEF 2013 at Istanbul, Turkey. * On 6 December 2013, another Anka UAV crashed in southeastern Turkey during a day flight. ==Configurations== Turkey's Directorate for Defence Industries has been stressing advanced variants of the Anka with larger payload capacity, extending Block A capabilities to the features like: *SATCOM *SIGINT *Air-to-ground and air-to-air missile integration According to the authority, the Anka will eventually have an indigenous 155 hp turbo-prop engine developed by TUSA≈û Engine Industries (TEI), with the cooperation of local companies in the future. ==Variants== ===Anka +A=== On 19 July 2012, the Turkish Defense Industry Executive Committee (SSIK) announced that Turkish Aerospace Industries had commenced research and development for the design and development of a \\"hunter killer\\" High-Altitude Long-Endurance version of the Anka UAV, named the Anka +A. It was planned that Anka +A will carry Cirit missiles of Turkey's ROKETSAN. The engines of the Anka +A UCAV had not yet been determined. It might have more powerful turbo engines or it could have gas turbine engine. The weight of Anka +A UCAV would be more than 4 tons compared to Anka Block A's 1.5 tons. It was highly expected that the UCAV would be presented to public in the events of IDEF'13 on 7‚Äì10 May 2013.Zaman Anka UAVs are getting armed === Anka-B === Anka-B with SAR Radar On 30 January 2015, the Anka-B completed its maiden flight successfully. Anka Block B is an improved version of the Anka Block A. The UAV carries an Aselsan synthetic aperture radar/ground moving-target indicator payload in addition to the platform's electro-optical/infrared sensor. During the maiden flight, Anka-B successfully performed \\"basic shakedown\\" and auto-landing. The Anka Block B also has a greater payload capacity than that of the Anka-A which includes SAR/ISAR/GMTI radar (in addition to the cameras of Anka A) that obtains and remits high resolution intelligence data back to base. The Anka Block B paved the way for weaponisation of the platform in the foreseeable future. Anka Block B passed 30.000 feet, 26 hours and 200 km radius during the test flights. Turkish Air Force ordered 10 Anka Block B in 2013 at a cost of $300 million. === Anka-S === Anka-S with modified radome for SATCOM Anka-S is a serial production configuration of Anka. It is equipped with ViaSat's VR-18C Highpower SATCOM antenna and a national flight control computer. Like Block A and Block B, Anka-S will be powered by Thielert Centurion 2.0S. On the other hand, Turkish Engine Industries (TEI) has been developing a national engine, capable of running with diesel and JP-8 jet fuel. On 25 October 2013, Turkish Undersecretariat for Defence Industry (SSM) ordered 10 Anka-S UAVs and 12 ground control stations for $290 million ($220.6 million + TRY 137 million). The UAVs would be delivered in three batches (2+4+4). The first batch was planned to be delivered in March 2017. A total of 6 aircraft were planned to be delivered in 2017. In 2016, media reported that the TAI was manufacturing 4 Anka-S UAVs for the armed forces. The first two of these aircraft were to be equipped with StarFIRE 380-HDL FLIR payload. However, these would be replaced with Aselsan CATS later on. On 17 August 2018, Directorate for Defence Industries announced that the Anka-S completed its first live fire tests. The platform was tested with MAM-L ammunition developed by the Roketsan. In September, Ismail Demir, director of the Turkey's defence industry authority, shared a picture of the first Anka-S equipped with Aselsan CATS optical system.https://twitter.com/IsmailDemirSSB/status/1044620673581285376 TAI delivered 2 more Anka-S to Turkish Air Force in September 2018,https://twitter.com/SavunmaSanayii/status/1042381426493153280 increasing the Anka-S inventory of Turkish Air Force to 8 aircraft. TAI is planning to deliver a total of 10 Anka-S to Turkish Air Force before 2019.https://twitter.com/Acemal71/status/1042393522974932992 In August 2018, the Anka-S carried out Turkey's \\"first satellite-controlled airstrike\\". In December, an Anka completed its first flight with an engine produced domestically. In 2019, the Anka broke its endurance records, flying longer than 24 hours. Although Ankas have an operational range of about 100 miles, the Anka-S (satellite-enabled) is capable of flying beyond \\"line of sight\\". === Anka-I === Electronic warfare and intelligence UAV made for the National Intelligence Organization. Equipped with electronic warfare and intelligence systems (ELINT and COMINT). http://www.millisavunma.com/anka-i-elektronik- harp-ve-istihbarat-iha/ === Anka-2=== The Anka-2 (code name Aksungur) is a twin engined version of the Anka-S which has a significantly higher payload capacity. This version is still under development and is planned to be taken into operation in 2020. ==Operational history== The Anka performed its first mission flight on 5 February 2016 in Turkey's eastern province of Elazig performing a four-hour exploration and observation flight.Turkish Drone Anka Makes Debut Flight - Defensenews.com, 7 February 2016 In the course of Turkey's Operation Olive Branch in 2018, the UAV for the first time used the Smart Micro Munition, MAM-L. Multiple Anka-S drones along with the advanced Bayraktar TB2 drones were deployed and extensively used during the Operation Spring Shield launched by Turkey following the heavy losses the Turkish forces incurred at the hands of the Russian-backed Syrian government in northwestern Syria at the end February 2020. The deployment was assessed by experts to be a tactical game-changer.

The deal was later cancelled. Some sources claimed that the cancellation was due to the disagreements between AK Parti government of then Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan and the Egyptian military regime led by General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, while other sources stated the deal was never finalized. Recep Tayyip Erdogan was supporting the first democratically elected president in Egypt's, who had won the Egyptian presidential election in 2012, before getting ousted in a military coup on July 3, 2013. * In April 2013, Saudi Arabian officials expressed interest in the Anka UAV. In November 2017, a Turkish official confirmed talks had been ongoing since 2013 for the purchase of 6 systems, but no official contract had been signed yet. The official stated specific requirements regarding reconnaissance capability and a possible transfer of technology to Saudi Arabia. A different source noted budgetary challenges to be overcome due to Saudi Arabia demanding a lower price due to lower oil prices constraining Saudi income. * In late November 2018, during IDEAS 2018, it was confirmed that Pakistan Navy is interested in Anka-S and has begun negotiations with Turkish Aerospace Industries for this UAV. ===Failed bids=== * In November 2017 it was revealed that there were talks with the United Arab Emirates, which ultimately amounted to no tangible results, in large part due to the United Arab Emirates also locally developing competing unmanned systems. == Operators == ; ‚Äì 24 activehttps://armstrade.org/includes/periodics/news/2020/0826/122059339/detail.shtml * Turkish Air Force ‚Äì 16 active (planned total 40) * Turkish National Intelligence Organization ‚Äì Anka-I variant * Turkish Naval Forces - 4 deliveredhttps://www.defenseworld.net/news/27711/Turkey_Delivers_Upgraded_ANKA_Combat_Drone_to_Navy#.X2XtFYuP7IU ; * A contract was signed in March 2020 for 6 Anka-S and 3 command centers at $USD 240 million.https://www.armyrecognition.com/march_2020_news_defense_global_security_army_industry/tunisia_to_purchase_turkish- made_anka-s_unmanned_aerial_vehicles.html ==Specifications (Anka-A)== ==See also== ==References== ==External links== * Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) * TAI Anka Documentary * TAI Anka Presentation * Flight Global: Turkey reveals MALE UAV details * East West Studies: Turkish Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (TIHA) Program Category:International unmanned aerial vehicles Category:Unmanned military aircraft of Turkey Category:Medium-altitude long-endurance unmanned aerial vehicles Category:Military robots Category:Single-engined pusher aircraft Category:V-tail aircraft Anka Category:Synthetic aperture radar Category:Aircraft first flown in 2010 ","title":"TAI Anka"},{"id":"11654424","text":"Icebird is an American indie rock group from Los Angeles.

He is noted for his alteration of preexisting media‚Äîsuch as old books, maps, record albums, and cassette tapes‚Äîto create new, transformed works of visual fine art. ==Life and art== Dettmer was born and raised in Naperville, Illinois in 1974. Until 2006, he lived in and around Chicago, where he earned a BA in fine arts from Columbia College Chicago in 1997. During school and following graduation, Dettmer worked as an artist and in positions related to graphics and signage design. In 2006, Dettmer moved with his wife to Atlanta, where he worked as a studio artist. (Brown 2008; Camper 2005). In 2013, Dettmer and his family relocated to New York City, where he continues his work today. ===Early work=== As a student, Dettmer focused primarily on painting. When he began to work in a sign shop, his work began to explore the relationship between text, images, language, and codes, including paintings based on braille, Morse Code, and American Sign Language. He then began to make work by repeatedly pasting newspapers and book pages to canvas and tearing off pieces, leaving behind layered fragments. (Sasaki 2009; Brown 2008; Camper 2005). In 2000, Dettmer started to experiment by gluing and cutting into books, the medium for which he is now best known. (Brown 2008). ===Recent work=== Brian Dettmer's Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman. Produced during a residency at Shandy Hall Dettmer's current work involves the appropriation and alteration of media to transform the physical form and/or to selectively remove and reveal content to create new works of fine art. Dettmer explains: \\"Old books, records, tapes, maps, and other media frequently fall into a realm that too much of today's art occupies. Their intended role has decreased or deceased and they often exist simply as symbols of the ideas they represent rather than true conveyors of content. ‚Ä¶ When an object's intended function is fleeting, the necessity for a new approach to its form and content arises.\\" (Valdez 2006). A large body of Dettmer's current work is created by altering books, including older dictionaries, encyclopedias, textbooks, science and engineering books, art books, medical guides, history books, atlases, comic books, wallpaper sample books, and others. Dettmer seals and cuts into the books, exposing select images and text to create intricate three-dimensional derivative works that reveal new or alternative interpretations of the books. Dettmer never inserts or moves any of the books' contents. (Moayeri 2008). This process is performed without pre-planning or mapping out the contents before cutting into the book. (Cullum 2010). As he cuts away unwanted material with knives, tweezers and surgical tools, Dettmer stabilizes the remaining paper with a varnish. (Fox 2009). An early example of Dettmer's altered books is his 2003 work, New International Dictionary, an original 1947 unabridged dictionary sealed and cut to expose images within the dictionary (Sundell 2005, at pg. 70). Dettmer has subsequently augmented his process by folding, bending, rolling, or stacking one or more books before sealing and cutting them or, in some instances, sanding them to create a variety of forms. Dettmer has also constructed larger sculptures using complete sets of encyclopedias and other reference books. Other notable examples of media transformed by Dettmer include music cassette tapes melted and formed into a life-sized human skeleton (Tyson 2007) and various animal skulls; cut and layered highway maps of the United States and the Middle East (Packer 2005) and three-dimensional map sculptures; VHS videotapes of gangster movies unraveled and formed into funeral flower arrangements; and a controversial reconfiguration of audio excerpts from George W. Bush's 2002 State of the Union Address. (Feigly 2003). Brian Dettmer's work has been published and exhibited widely in museums, art centers, and galleries around the world, including the Smithsonian (Washington D.C.), Museum of Arts and Design (New York), Virginia Museum of Contemporary Art (Virginia), Museum of Contemporary Art (Georgia), Museum Rijswijh (Netherlands), Wellcome Collection (United Kingdom), the Bellevue Arts Museum (Washington), The Kohler Arts Center (Wisconsin), and the Illinois State Museums (Illinois). His work can be found in public and private collections in the United States, Latin America, Europe, Australia, and Asia. ==References== * \\"Artist of the Week, Brian Dettmer\\" (interview), what to wear during an orange alert?, November 21, 2007.

Ero guro nansensu is a wasei-eigo word derived from the English words erotic, grotesque, and nonsense. ==Overview== Sada Abe Incident, noting the nonsensical nature of the incident. Apt to its namesake, this period of time in Japan saw a large increase in the release of literature, magazines, news articles, and music centered around erotic grotesqueness. The popularization of such media arose during the advent the Great Depression (1929) and died down following the February 26 Incident. After the publishing of Edogawa Ranpo's short story, , in the magazine Shinseinen in 1928, Japanese society saw a boom of bizarre and grotesque media. That same year, Yumeno Ky≈´saku published his novel . Around this time, nansensu was added to ero guro as a buzzword that draws from the established sense of erotic grotesqueness to convey a certain style of media, culture and lifestyle. The 1932 publication of marks the peak of this boom. In 1936, Ky≈´saku passed away shortly after the release of his novel . Ranpo moved to works aimed towards younger male audiences with his release of in the same year, and many of his previous novels either went out of print, or were banned as war efforts became increasingly pervasive. The boom of bizarre media ended around this time. The massive news coverage of the Sada Abe Incident in May 1936 is seen as a pivotal element of the ero guro nansensu movement. Shortly afterwards, the popular song , released earlier in March of the same year was banned from airing in June on the grounds that it was too erotic. The ero guro nansensu period is said to have ended with the start of NHK Kokuminkay≈ç radio broadcasts during the same month. Along with several books which had managed to avoided censorship by the Ministry of Home Affairs, books of this theme that had been banned during this period are often circulated through book buying clubs as underground books and are subject to study and analysis. Many books of this era were banned for their propoundment of radical ideologies such as anarchism, but most were banned on the grounds of their ero guro nansensu content. After the conclusion of World War II, censored books of this period resided in the National Diet Library as \\"Banned Books held under Possession by the National Diet Library\\", but some books were confiscated by American forces during the Occupation of Japan. The National Diet Library has worked with the American Library of Congress to digitize this content, including content that would have been considered obscene back in the day, but are not by today's standards (e.g. Kiyoshi Sakai's Eroero Soushi). Much of this content is free to view online if copyright laws have allowed for it to be available as such. Pages that had been removed from these books per censorship have also been re-released to the public under these archives. However, because the relatively recent nature of the commencement of public access to these libraries, there has been few in-depth analyses of its works. With the efforts of librarians such as Noritada ≈åtaki, endeavors to encourage studies of these books and further extensions of access to the public have been made. However, of the roughly 11,000 books banned during this period, the National Diet Library only holds about 7,000. The rest of the books must be found through personal collections. Unlike books which have gained the reputation of being \\"underground\\" after being banned, the location of books that were written to be circulated discreetly and thus avoid charges of obscenity are rarely held by the National Diet Library, so researchers make an effort to hunt down the books themselves. Even publishers of these books themselves may not know the whereabouts of any existing copies, making knowledge of these books scarce in underground book communities. In 2011, specialist and collector of banned books, J≈ç Ichir≈çdonated roughly 7000 books of this nature to Meiji University. Major publishers responsible for popularizing the movement include Hakubunkan, which published Shinseinen, and Heibonsha, which published Edogawa Ranpo Zensh≈´. === Censorship === Under the Empire of Japan, all major publications were heavily monitored by the Home Ministry Police Affairs Bureau and in some cases, censored. Books, news articles, and magazines containing ero guro nansensu material were immediately subject to prohibition from being sold or published. Standards for censorship were not well understood, and even works such as Sakutar≈ç Hagiwara's (which became considered a masterpiece post-World War II) had its first edition banned from sale. In the 1920s, major publishers began to take preemptive measures to avoid censorship and implemented \\"private perusal\\". In a system of prepublication self-censorship, they consulted official censors and erased words from their content that would have faced scrutiny for obscenity before they were even printed. However, even with these measures in place, the July 1926 publication of Kaiz≈ç was banned from sale altogether, prompting the publishing industry to fight back against the overbearing censorship. That same year, the Japan Writers' Association formed the and spoke to Osachi Hamaguchi (then Minister of the Home Ministry) directly, pressuring him to make changes to the censorship system. These efforts eventually allowed for the abolition of \\"private perusal\\" in many publishers in the following year. With the passage of the General Election Law and Taisho democracy at its peak, Kaiz≈çsha, the publisher of Kaiz≈ç, began to publish , books that collected modern Japanese literature that could be purchased for one yen, to make up for its faltering magazine sales. Soon enough, not just small and medium-sized publishers, but also large publishers followed suit, publishing cheap and accessible ero guro nansensu literature in the form of Enpon. The liberal atmosphere of the time fostered a rebellious temperament amongst the publishing industry, one which disregarded the censorship and bans placed upon their books. As usual, the censorship was strict, and some publishers still self-censored, but many companies played around with the law in various ways; for example, some included a \\"Table of Omitted Words\\" as a piece of paper attached to their books one could refer to, to understand what was being censored. In theory, a book banned under this policy would not be able to make it onto the market. However, many of the books of this nature managed to circumvent the authorities through various means. Ero guro nansensu literature gained a reputation for being \\"underground\\" as they were circulated through secret buying clubs. One method used to avoid censorship was to conduct \\"guerrilla releases\\", in which the released books were to be almost completely sold out before delivering them to Home Ministry for review. A few copies of the books would be kept specifically to be confiscated if the Home Ministry deemed it to be unworthy for public release. A list released post-World War II by one of the buying clubs distributing these works, S≈çtaikai, revealed the then president of Dai-ichi Tokyo Bar Association Kiyosaku Toyohara, along with many other intellectuals of the time, as members of the buying club. To describe such books as \\"underground\\" may be an overstatement, as the scale of these operations were quite large, evidenced by lawyers who testified against such buying clubs. Large publishing companies during this time period also engaged in \\"guerrilla releases\\". For example, in 1932 the company Heibonsha published an appendix to Edogawa Ranpo Zensh≈´, entitled which was promptly banned from sale for \\"corruption of public morals\\". The boom of ero guro nansensu media incited Heibonsha and other large publishers such as Shinchosha to release large amounts of bannable content. There were no laws during this period regarding audio media and as a result, erotic music developed into a popular genre of the time. In 1934, a revision on publishing legislation made audio media subject to censorship and bans, though enforcement of these laws was relatively low for a while. In 1936, enforcement of censorship began to increase and under the Public Order and Police Law of 1900, old music and audio records were also subject to banning. The first record to be censored was a comic dialogue, on the grounds that it was \\"too playful\\" (\\"„Åµ„Åñ„Åë„Åô„Åé„Å¶„ÅÑ„Çã\\"). Another popular song at the time, Wasurecha Iya yo was banned and copies withdrawn for being too erotic, warranting the offense of \\"disturbing public law and order, damaging customs\\". This led to the introduction of a de facto preemptive self-censorship system in the records industry, conducted with the consultation of officials from the Home Ministry. A newspaper headline announcing the ban of Hokumei Umehara's magazine \\"Grotesque\\". Umehara was extolled as the \\"King of Underground Publishing\\" in ero guro nansensu culture. (December 1928) Because punishment for publishing media that was banned was minimal (the maximum jail sentence was under 2 years, but most publishers were simply fined), there were some people who specialized in publishing such media. Miyatake Gaikotsu's literature was repeatedly banned throughout the Meiji, Taisho, and Showa eras, and even during the occupation of Japan through General Headquarters. However, one such writer named Hokumei Umehara was placed under constant surveillance and eventually deported from Japan. In 1925, a new law termed the Public Security Preservation Law of 1925 was put in place to suppress political dissent. The punishment for breaking this law was to be put to death. Offenders were known to be placed under imprisonment by the Special Higher Police without trial and brutally tortured. However, this punishment wasn't usually enforced on ero guro nansensu media by underground publishers. Kaiz≈çsha faced multiple bans on its left wing publications (for example Takiji Kobayashi's 1929 novel Kani K≈çsen), but these were only subject to normal publication laws, not the Public Security Preservation Law. Kaiz≈çsha went on publishing writers like Edogawa Ranpo without any subsequent bans. Because of this, it is theorized that the Home Ministry tacitly consented to the left wing's ero guro nansensu culture under the premise that it kept its \\"eroticism over terrorism\\" and \\"pink over red\\". However, this may also simply be because the distinction between socialist publications and ero guro nansensu publications is rather vague in publication legislation. In his book , ero guro nansensu researcher Aratsuki Hiroshi emphasizes that proletarian literature is \\"sexually perverted\\" and \\"erotic and grotesque\\". In the years following 1936, the censorship began to be enforced even more as the Second Sino-Japanese War begun. As a result, ero guro nansensu publications were restricted, and publishers who once advocated the ero guro nansensu culture lost their rebellious temperament. Edogawa Ranpo, whose work largely contributed to the boom of ero guro media in the 1930s was struck with a ban on his short story , and much of his previous books went out of print. After the downfall of the liberal atmosphere that fostered ero guro nansensu culture during the Second Sino-Japanese war, it experienced a revival during the post- war generation, termed apr√®s-guerre („Ç¢„Éó„É¨„Ç≤„Éº„É´). New \\"kasutori magazines\\" („Ç´„Çπ„Éà„É™ÈõëË™å), cheap magazines that took advantage of the liberalization of publication laws, contained sexual and grotesque content that allowed for the popularization of ero guro nansensu, restoring the liberal atmosphere seen in the Showa era. After the establishment of the Constitution of Japan, ero guro nansensu media still faced suppression. Notably, Michiyo Kogura, a writer and member of S≈çtaikai arrested before wartime, resumed his writings after the war, but was arrested again in 1957 in violation of Article 175 of the Penal Code. It was only after 1970, with the relaxation of laws dealing with obscene media that ero guro nansensu media was completely free of legislative scrutiny. In the 1990s, Hanzi Zukan was reissued by Heibonsha. After 2010, the National Diet Library started to publish its collection of banned literature onto its online digital collection. ==See also== * Sh≈çwa (1926‚Äì1989) *Taish≈ç * Literary modernism * Proletarian literature * Underground culture *Ero guro *Edogawa Ranpo *Samizdat ==References== ==External links== * Category:Japanese words and phrases ","title":"Ero guro nansensu"},{"id":"11654578","text":"Hugh Donald McCutcheon (born 13 October 1969), a native of Christchurch, New Zealand, is the former head coach of the US men's national volleyball team, the former head coach of the US women's national volleyball team, and the current head coach of the University of Minnesota's women's volleyball team.

It was founded in 1993 and currently there are over 220 students. It is known for its high level of Gemara learning. A picture of the outside of Yeshivat Hesder Yerucham. ==History== Inside the beis medresh of the yeshivaIn the early 1970s, a group of Religious Zionists settled in Yeruham with the goal of improving the south of Israel, and helping to increase the quality of life for the residents of Yerucham. Over time, the group grew in number and expanded its activities by taking on educational responsibilities as well. After establishing \\"Midreshet B'Yahad\\", a Seminar Center of Judaism, Society and Zionism Studies, the group realized the need for a yeshiva as the next step in strengthening the existing projects by bringing youth to Yeruham. The leader of this group, Shmuel Friedman Ben- Shalom, approached Rabbi Eliyhau Blumenzweig, who at the time taught at Yeshivat Har Etzion, with a proposition to be the Rosh Yeshiva, which he accepted. The yeshiva subsequently opened its doors in 1993. Today, the yeshiva is considered to be one of the most serious hesder yeshivas in the country. ==Curriculum== Lunch room of the YeshivaLunch room of the YeshivaDaily Schedule: Shachrit (and halachah seder): 6:30‚Äì8:00 am Breakfast: 8:00‚Äì8:30 am Morning seder: 8:30 am ‚Äì 1:00 pm Lunch/break: 1:00‚Äì3:00 pm Mincha: 3:00‚Äì3:20 pm Afternoon seder: 3:20‚Äì7:30 pm Supper: 7:30‚Äì8:00 pm Marriv: 8:00‚Äì8:30 pm Night seder: 8:30‚Äì11:00 pm (or later) Yeshivat Hesder Yerucham emphasizes the importance of learning Talmud in depth, specifically through the Brisker Method. A typical day in Yeshiva will include two sessions of intensive Talmud study (iyun) and one of extensive study (bekiut). In terms of the afternoon seder, students can either learn with a charvuras, go to shiurim, or a combination of both. The yeshiva offers weekly classes in Tanakh, Jewish philosophy, Hasidic philosophy and the works of Jewish scholars such as Maimonides, Rabbi Yehuda Halevi, the Maharal of Prague, Moshe Chaim Luzzatto, Joseph B. Soloveitchik, Abraham Isaac Kook, and many others. The daily schedule is: shachrit at 6:30 am, followed by a halachah seder until 8:00 am. Breakfast is from 8:00‚Äì8:30 am. After breakfast is morning seder, which is typically gemara iyun, and it goes from 8:30 am ‚Äì 1:00 pm. Following the morning seder is lunch and a break from 1:00‚Äì3:00 pm. Mincha is at 3:00 pm, followed by the afternoon seder, from about 3:20‚Äì7:30 pm. Afternoon seder consists of more iyun gemara, followed by a couple hours of emmunah. Many of the students use the entire afternoon seder for learning machshava, tanach, mussar, and emmunah. From 7:30‚Äì8:00 pm is Maariv, followed by supper from 8:00‚Äì8:30 pm. Night seder consists of learning bekiut, and it goes from 8:30 pm until at least 11:00 pm, although there is no given time for night seder to end, and many students learn until later. The daily schedule goes from Sunday to Thursday, and there is a morning shiurim given on Fridays as well. On motza'ei shabbos there is night seder, and on Thursday night many students do \\"mishmor\\" and learn until very late hours of the night. ==Educational approach== The gemara shiurim at the yeshiva are given at a very high level, and usually go into great depth on a certain topic in the gemara. The works of the Rishonim and Acharonim are often analyzed in the shiurim. The rosh yeshiva gives a \\"shiur klali\\" for the entire yeshiva during Thursday's morning seder. The yeshiva guides its students to base their perspective upon the teachings of Rabbi Yehuda Halevi and the Maharal of Prague in accordance with the ideology of Abraham Isaac Kook, as is often customary in Religious Zionist yeshivas. With the goal of educating students to deal independently with the challenges they face living as observant Jews in a modern world, the yeshiva encourages a broader study of biblical, rabbinic, and other classical and modern works. The yeshiva educates its students to be aware of their surroundings and attentive to the needs of society in general. The yeshiva believes that the keys to solving Israel‚Äôs socioeconomic gaps lie in integration and education. All the students volunteer in the community mainly in the field of education. Many of the yeshiva's alumni settle in Yeruham instead of heading to the country's central cities. The yeshiva also promotes other programs, among them: * Ye'adim (goals) - Concern of the Ethiopian Jewry in Israel's situation led Yerucham students to create a leadership training program for Ethiopian students with the intention of their returning to their communities. During the 5 years of Hesder the students synchronize their full Yeshiva studies with a B.Ed. degree in Herzog College. * Young Study Partners - First and second year students dedicate 2 hours weekly to studying Torah subjects with children from the local elementary school. They also serve as positive role models for the local youth and look to form a connection with their families. * Charity Fund - The goal of the Fund is to help the needy of Yeruham become self-sufficient and better managers of their money. The Fund uses the cooperation of the local welfare and professional financial advisors to this end. * B'levav Shalem Yeshiva High School ‚Äì Because of the lack of high quality religious high schools in the Negev, and as a part of the integration program the Hesder Yeshiva believes in, it was decided by alumni, residents of Yerucham, to open a Yeshiva High School for the local and general population. ==Educational staff== Rabbi Blumenzweig In addition to Rabbi Blumenzweig, the other rabbis who teach in the Yeshiva are Rabbi Uriel Eitam, Rabbi Chaim Wolfson, Rabbi Shai Gnizi, Rabbi Shmuel Gleizer, Rabbi Achiya Ben Pazi, Rabbi Asher Weiss, Rabbi Ido Heber, Rabbi Shmuel Ariel, and Rabbi Elyakim Sharir. Rabbi Gnizi, Rabbi Gleizer, Rabbi Asher Weiss, and Rabbi Ben Pazi all began as students in the yeshiva. There are also rabbis who come from afar to give weekly classes, such as Rabbi Eliyahu Bazak and Rabbi Meir Kahana. Previously there were other teachers who have since left. These include Rabbi Dr. Michael Abraham, Rabbi Ehud Barzilai, Rabbi Yair Ya'acobi (who is now serving as the rosh yeshiva of yerucham's religious highschool \\"B'levav Shalem\\"), Rabbi Avi Luria, Rabbis Yoseph Elitzor, and Rabbi Nir Weinberg (who left to establish and head the Hazor'im Yeshiva High-School in the lower Galilee). ==Yeshiva's publications== Here are some of the publications from the yeshiva's collective student body that have come out over the past number of years: *Kutanot Or (Coats of Light) - \\"A Jewish Perspective on the meaning of modesty and its value\\", collection of essays edited by Yeshiva's students. *Mimidbar Matana (A Present From The Desert) - A monthly newsletter which is sent out to students in the IDF and alumni. *Meisharim (Righteous) - A journal of articles on a variety of Torah topics, written by the students and teachers, published annually by the Yeshiva. *Hahazit ShebaOref (The Home-Front Front) - A collection of essays dealing with the trials and challenges of a non-combat soldier. The book‚Äôs intention is to answer some of the questions that soldiers serving in non-field units, such as the importance of their service, and halakhic perspective on different situations. Many of the rabbis that teach in the yeshiva have also published a number of sefarim. ==See also== *Hesder *Yeshiva *Yerucham *Torah *Israel *Gemara *Brisker method ==External links== *Yeshivat HaHesder Yerucham (Hebrew) *Midreshet Beyahad (Hebrew) Yerucham Category:Educational institutions established in 1993 Category:1993 establishments in Israel == Bibliography == ","title":"Yeshivat HaHesder Yerucham"},{"id":"11654619","text":"Heinemann Library is an imprint of American book publishing company Capstone Publishers.

The company exceeded the NOK 8 billion budget by NOK 6 billion in upgrading the oil refinery at Mongstad. Retrospectively the reasons for the overexpenditure were attributed to bad planning, technical miscalculations and bad project management. The executives in Statoil were also accused of inability to act and for withholding information from the Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy. At the time the incident aroused considerable media attention. The first warnings of a budget overspend came on 25 September 1987, when the over-expenditure was estimated at NOK 3,8 billion. On 20 November most of the board of directors had to resign.https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/21/business/oil-scandal-in- norway.html?pagewanted=1 Oil Scandal in Norway, New York Times The board was led by chairman Inge Johansen and deputy chairman Vidkunn Hveding since 1984. The other board members who also resigned were Thor Andreassen (member since 1978), Fredrik Thoresen (member since 1984), Guttorm Hansen (member since 1986) and Toril V. Lundestad (member since 1986). The only board members not to resign were the three employee representatives. Two days later chief executive officer Arve Johnsen also resigned, at the time the only CEO in the history of the company to resign. In January 1988 reports of a possibility of the overexpenditure accumulating another billion NOK were presented. By April the anticipated overspend was believed to be in the order of NOK 8 billion, although the final sum came to NOK 6 billion. The enormous shock effect of the Mongstad scandal should be understood in the light of the social and political situation of Norway in 1988. Statoil was at the time a limited company wholly owned by the Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, who managed the entire profit. After the company had started to make a profit around 1980 it had become the guarantor for welfare in the country in the minds of people. The company's transfers to government treasury coffers exceeded that of income tax at the time. CEO Arve Johnsen was the man who could do nothing wrong, the Labour Party man who controlled Statoil even during a conservative government. Prime Minister K√•re Willoch's attempt to clip Statoil's wings a few years earlier had failed. And at the same time came the bankruptcy in the largest bank, Den norske Creditbank that had announced the start of the fall of the Yuppie age. The media attention on the Mongstad scandal in 1988 was enormous, and was front-page material almost daily. The tabloid newspapers battles fiercely in trying to visualise the, at the time, almost unimaginable size of NOK 6 billion. The sum was creatively recalculated in kindergarten places, retirement home places, fighter jets etc. Sometimes the coverage became absurd with parallels such as Dagbladet's example of 6 billion = enough to buy one AG3 assault rifle for each of the country's 4,5 million inhabitants. For years the term one mong was used as a synonym for the number 6 billion. ==References== Category:Corporate scandals Category:History of the petroleum industry Category:Equinor Category:1987 in Norway Category:1988 in Norway ","title":"Mongstad scandal"},{"id":"11654667","text":"The Bombini are a tribe of large bristly apid bees which feed on pollen or nectar.

With the idea of easing the burden humanity places on the environment with conventional housing by growing \\"living, breathing\\" tree homes. It would be built by allowing native trees to grow over a computer-designed (CNC) removable plywood scaffold. Once the plants are interconnected and stable, the plywood would be removed and reused. MIT is experimenting with trees that grow quickly and develop an interwoven root structure that's soft enough to \\"train\\" over the scaffold, but then hardens into a more durable structure. The inside walls would be conventional clay and plaster. An old methodology new to buildings is introduced in this design - pleaching. Pleaching is a method of weaving together tree branches to form living archways, lattices, or screens.; the technique is also named \\"aeroponic culture\\". The load-bearing part of the structure uses trees that self-graft or inosculate such as live oak, elm and dogwood. The lattice frame for the walls and roof are created with the branches of the trees. Vines create a dense protective layer woven along the exterior, interspersed with soil pockets and growing plants. The Fab Tree Hab is an experiment that would develop over time. Extra operating costs required over the life-time of the home include pest management with organic pesticides and maintenance of the living machine's water treatment system. Technical demonstration and innovation is still needed for certain components, primarily the bioplastic windows that accept growth of the structure and the management of flows across the wall section to assure that the interior remains dry and animal-free. All in all, the elapsed time to reach livability is greater than the traditional sense, but so should be the health and longevity of the home and family. Above all, building this home could be achieved at a minimal price. Depending on the surrounding climate the house is to be grown in, the team expect it will take a minimum of five years to complete its structure. Realization of these homes will begin as an experiment, and it is envisioned that thereafter, the concept of renewal will take on a new architectural form - one of inter-dependency between nature and people. As of May 2007 Mitchell Joachim stated that there is a \\"50 per cent\\" organic project in California, combining natural elements and traditional construction. ==Trees== Main trees suggested to be used are elms and oaks. The teams hopes the homes can be grown using mainly native trees. == See also == * Arborsculpture * Autonomous building * Green architecture * Green building * Regenerative medicine * Sustainable design * Terreform ONE * Tissue engineering * Urban ecology ==References== ==Further reading== *James Nestor, \\"Branching Out,\\" Dwell, Vol. 7 No. 3, pp. 96‚Äì98, Feb. 2007. *Gregory Mone, \\"Grow your second home,\\" Popular Science, pp. 38‚Äì9, Nov. 2006. *Carolyn Johnson, \\"MIT plants seeds of a new kind of house\\", The Boston Globe, p.

It is a Technicolor adventure film adaptation of the classic 1844 novel The Three Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas. ==Plot== D'Artagnan (Gene Kelly), an inexperienced Gascon youth, travels to Paris to join the elite King's Musketeers. On his way, he encounters a mysterious lady at a roadside inn. When he picks a fight with one of her escorts, she becomes suspicious and has him knocked unconscious. His letter of introduction from his father to de Treville (Reginald Owen), the commander of the Musketeers, is burned. When he awakens, he continues on to the city. In Paris, he nevertheless presents himself to de Treville, who recognizes d'Artagnan's description of one of his assailants and, saying \\"A man is sometimes known by the enemies he makes\\", makes him a cadet. The young Gascon spots the very man and in his haste to confront him, annoys three of the most skillful Musketeers: Athos (Van Heflin), Porthos (Gig Young) and Aramis (Robert Coote). Each challenges him to a duel. At the appointed place, upon learning they are all there to duel the same man the master swordsmen are amused by the newcomer's audacity. Before they can begin, however, they are interrupted by Richelieu's guards, who try to arrest the Musketeers. Outraged that the three are outnumbered, d'Artagnan joins them in dispatching their foes, displaying his superb swordsmanship in the process. As a result, he is welcomed into their ranks. Later, d'Artagnan rescues (and falls in love with) Constance Bonacieux (June Allyson), a confidante of Queen Anne (Angela Lansbury). The queen had been given a matched set of twelve diamond studs by her husband, King Louis XIII (Frank Morgan). Foolishly, she gives them to her lover, the Duke of Buckingham (John Sutton), who is also the Prime Minister of Great Britain. Knowing of the queen's indiscretion, Richelieu (Vincent Price) sees a way to persuade the King to go to war with Britain. Richelieu arranges a ball and suggests to Louis that he have the Queen wear the diamonds. D'Artagnan and his three friends volunteer to travel to Britain to retrieve the jewels, but along the way, they are ambushed by Richelieu's men. One by one, the Musketeers are forced to stay behind to hold off their pursuers. Finally, only d'Artagnan and his servant Planchet (Keenan Wynn) are left to reach the Duke. However, Richelieu had already sent the beautiful Milady, Countess de Winter (Lana Turner) to work her wiles on His Grace and steal two of the studs. The Duke's jeweler is able to make replacements quickly and d'Artagnan races back to France. He arrives just in time to save the Queen from disgrace. Admiring d'Artagnan's resourcefulness, Richelieu has Constance abducted in an attempt to enlist him in his service. He also assigns de Winter to help persuade the young man. D'Artagnan tries to learn where Constance is being held from Milady, but begins to fall under her spell instead. When Athos discovers that the Countess de Winter is actually his treacherous wife, he tries to warn d'Artagnan, but is not believed. Then d'Artagnan finds out that Athos was telling the truth: He sees a brand on Milady's shoulder, the mark of a common criminal, just where Athos had told him he would. Fighting breaks out between Britain and France. The Queen succeeds in freeing Constance and sends her to Buckingham for safety. When the war goes against him, Richelieu gives de Winter a carte blanche and sends her to Britain to assassinate his foe. The Musketeers learn of the plot and send Planchet to warn the Duke. Athos confronts Milady and recovers the carte blanche as proof of Richelieu's treachery. De Winter is imprisoned by the Duke and placed in the custody of Constance, but when the latter lets her guard down de Winter kills first her, then Buckingham. Athos and d'Artagnan arrive too late to save them. D'Artagnan and Athos return to France with a self-imposed mission: find the Countess de Winter and give her justice for the murders of the Duke of Buckingham and Constance. They lose track of her on the road to Lille and return to Paris. Captain de Treville informs them that de Winter has not been seen in the city, and warns the Musketeers that she is under Richelieu's protection; if they continue their vendetta, if they are not killed they will have to flee to Spain as wanted men. They elect to proceed after Aramis recalls a conversation between Milady and Richelieu concerning the granting of a title and an estate near Lille. Caught once again by the Musketeers at that estate, the ancestral home of Athos, she begs for mercy but finds none, even though her husband still loves her despite her many crimes. Seeing this, she calms herself and walks with dignity to her execution. The Musketeers are ambushed by Richelieu's men, captured, and returned to the Royal Court for judgment. As Richelieu is about to have them sentenced to death by the king, d'Artagnan produces the carte blanche. Richelieu is compelled to recommend to King Louis that he grant Aramis's wish to enter a monastery; Porthos, an introduction to a rich widow; Athos, the restoration of his title and lands; and d'Artagnan, a commission as a Musketeer and a mission to England, for \\"the English lead too dull a life.\\" The four, dismissed by the King, stride from the throne room in triumph. ==Cast== *Lana Turner as Milady, Countess de Winter *Gene Kelly as d'Artagnan *June Allyson as Constance Bonacieux *Van Heflin as Athos *Angela Lansbury as Queen Anne *Frank Morgan as King Louis XIII *Vincent Price as Richelieu.

It was used as part of the Lockwood/Lamont film The Royal Rascal. ===Shooting=== Director George Sidney said he approached the film as \\"a Western with costumes... I didn't approach it as a classic. The dueling was pure choreography and the fights are pure Western stuff.\\" The big dueling scene was shot in Busch Gardens in Pasadena. Sidney said \\"we shot on the back lot, in a public park, on golf courses.\\" \\"Lana Turner and I played complicated practical jokes on each other during the making of The Three Musketeers,\\" Vincent Price said. \\"Finally Gene Kelly yelled at us to stop it.

According to MGM accounts it made $4,124,000 in the US and Canada and $4,288,000 elsewhere, recording a profit of $1,828,000.

It has a rich cosmopolitan history and was the principal city of the vast plain of the entire Punjab region for many centuries, and was the capital of the Sikh empire of Maharaja Ranjit Singh until the mid-1850s when it was conquered by the British. Before the partition of British India in 1947, Lahore had a large Hindu, Sikh and Jain population. In 1941, 64.5% of the population of Lahore was Muslim, while about 36% was Hindu or Sikh. At that time, the city contained numerous Hindu temples, Jain temples, and Sikh gurdwaras. The overwhelming majority of Lahore and West Punjab's non-Christian minority population fled to India at Partition, while East Punjab was similarly depopulated of almost its entire Muslim population. For example, on the eve of Partition, Amritsar was about 49% Muslim, whereas in the 1951 census, the figure had dropped to only 0.52%, while Ludhiana was 63% Muslim prior to Partition, but 97% Hindu and Sikh in the 1961 census.

He is based on the Frog Prince and first appeared in Fables #1 (July 2002). ==Fictional character biography== ===Pre-Fabletown=== Flycatcher was once a normal human named Ambrose, until Frau Totenkinder (centuries prior to receiving amnesty) turned him into a frog, who could only return to human form when he found true love. When he did, he became a happily married prince of a small kingdom in the Homelands, with a beautiful wife with whom he had eight children. He lived peacefully with his family, his only quirk being the occasional resumption of his frog curse when he was nervous, scared or especially excited. Fortunately it only took a kiss from his loving wife to return him to human form, and, as time went on, he would often go for years between instances of the curse asserting itself. His tranquil family life was shattered when the Adversary invaded his realm. As Flycatcher prepared to leave to fight the Empire, he was unaware that the enemy troops had already invaded his castle. As he bid farewell to his family, enemy soldiers burst into the room, causing his curse to manifest immediately. Trapped in his frog form, he could only watch helplessly as his younger children were murdered and his wife and eldest daughter repeatedly raped before being killed themselves. How Fly eventually returned to his human form is unknown, though it is speculated that he took a last kiss from his dead wife. In deep denial about the deaths of his wife and children, Fly wandered as a beggar for a long time, asking everywhere he went if people had seen his family. Eventually, he learned of the sanctuary of the mundane world and, figuring that his family would have fled there, traveled there as well. Failing to find any of his family members there, Fly asked one of the magic mirrors retrieved from the Homelands to search for his family on his behalf while he stayed protected in Fabletown ‚Äî a position which racked him further with guilt. Some of his friends and coworkers were aware of this situation, and together conspired to keep the truth from him, knowing that it would destroy him. Still, when drunk, Flycatcher appeared to have a clearer memory of what had really happened to his family (which was believed to be the reason why he'd so rarely turn to drink). ===Fabletown=== Flycatcher acted as the janitor for the Woodland building, the center of government for Fabletown. However, he wasn't employed in the traditional sense - the nature of his history being such that, if he had a job that he could choose to quit, he would have to do so and return to the Homelands to seek his missing family. As this would almost certainly result in his death, Bigby Wolf developed a system of convenient deception, whereby Fly was made to work off a never-ending series of short community service orders for a series of minor infractions (usually eating flies). Fly thus remained in the job that he enjoyed, and where he felt important in the service to his fellow Fables. The arrangement was nearly disrupted when the well-meaning Beast misguidedly freed Fly from his wrongful \\"punishment\\" after replacing Bigby as Sheriff, and offered to employ him legitimately instead, before Rose Red explained the real nature of the situation to him. Upon her arrival from the Homelands, Fly began spending a considerable amount of time with Red Riding Hood, having been asked to look after her by his close friend Boy Blue before the latter departed for the Farm. \\"Ride\\" became enamored of Fly for his sweet and thoughtful nature, and eventually accompanied him to Bigby and Snow White's wedding. Fly, however, seemed oblivious to the fact that Red was falling for him, something that he only seemingly began to realize when she went out into the mundane city, where she had a makeover with him in mind. He was shocked when he saw her and ran away, hiding in the depths of the business office, where his curse then manifested and reverted him once again to his frog form. Eventually, Santa Claus visited Flycatcher on Christmas eve and forced him to reveal that he could still speak as a frog, and also that he still remembered what had happened to his family in the Homelands. Santa then presented Fly with the ghost of his wife, so that she could restore him to human form. He then explained that Fly was destined to play a crucial part in future events, but only if he could learn to accept the past and move on. ===Haven=== During The Good Prince, Flycatcher finally faced his past. With his memory fully restored, he resigned from his \\"job\\" at the Woodlands and swore vengeance on those who had destroyed his family, attempting to enlist Boy Blue's help in training his combat skills. Blue refused, partly on the grounds that Fly's idea was essentially a suicide mission, but more importantly because he didn't want to be responsible for the one truly good Fable losing his innocence. It was this purity of spirit that would become central to Fly's actual destiny. Returning to Fabletown, Fly found himself awakening from his sleep as he was supernaturally drawn to the business office, where he encountered the ghost of the Forsworn Knight, now released from his armor. Introducing himself as Lance, the ghost of the great knight informed Fly that he was to act as a guide for the first part of Fly's quest. Lance bequeathed his magical armor to Fly (which resumed its luster after being placed on a pure and just person), and also helped him obtain the legendary Excalibur. He then formally knighted Fly, claiming he was to take up the role of the Once and Future King (formerly held by King Arthur). Fly was imbued with a now-clear vision of what he was meant to do. Flycatcher proceeded to lead Lancelot into the Witching Well, to find the ghosts of those who had previously been thrown there. Among the ghosts were Little Miss Muffet's spider husband (Mr. Web), Gretel, Shere Khan and Bluebeard, as well as Trusty John (the only Fable besides Fly to jump down the Witching Well while still alive). The ghosts were informed that they would have new flesh while near Flycatcher, on the condition that they serve as his loyal army. They then follow Flycatcher for the long march out of the land of the dead (which lasted more than a month) and into the Homelands, eventually finding the garden kingdom where Flycatcher had once ruled as a prince. Rechristening his kingdom \\"Haven\\", Flycatcher brought to him powerful magics that nullified any sent by the Adversary to his regained lands. Fly conquered opposing armies one after another through non-lethal means--he duels one giant to exhaustion using only the flat of his blade and sends his ghost army into the minds of a goblin horde, racking them with their own fears and nightmares. He positions Haven as a \\"third course\\" beside the two opposing parties in the war between the Adversary's Empire and Fabletown. Flycatcher ultimately manages to defeat every enemy sent at him without shedding any blood and graciously accepts his defeated enemies as new citizens of Haven, since their return to the Empire will result in being executed for their failure. Eventually, the Adversary assembles all of the wooden soldiers into the dreaded Golden Horde. As they march ‚Äî immune to the fear of the army of ghosts, and with the magic of the Sacred Grove too strong to be nullified by Flycatcher's ‚Äî the advancing army appears unbeatable. Fly senses the end of his visions, and believes that it means his final act in the conflict will result in his death. He walks alone to meet the Horde, apparently for the purpose of surrender. However, to the surprise of puppets and Fly alike, his magical armor (the armor of the Unspoiled Knight) adds itself to the Sacred Grove's magic, causing all of the wooden soldiers to suddenly sprout into an enormous grove of trees. Flycatcher, having not expected his own survival, explains that the Adversary is now defeated; the soldiers, nearly every one in the Empire, have all become a new Sacred Grove. Because there can be only one Sacred Grove in all the worlds, this means that Gepetto's will never grow back. Moreover, the new Sacred Grove's magic has increased Fly's own, meaning he would be able to continue expanding his kingdom of benevolent rule. When questioned about his intentions toward the Sacred Grove ‚Äî explicitly, whether he intends to raise his own army of wooden soldiers and capture lands from the Empire ‚Äî Fly experiences a nightmarish vision of an older version of himself waging war on countless worlds with such a wooden soldier army. This causes him to declare that the grove is to be left alone, and that it be no more than a place of quiet reflection and peace. During Boy Blue's recovery from the injury caused by the enchanted arrow he had been shot with during \\"War and Pieces\\", Blue told Flycatcher about how naive he was being about Red Riding Hood's feelings for him, and that he felt the two should get together. Soon after that, Flycatcher was quick to notice that Blue's arm had turned gangrenous and infected, despite his previous apparent recovery. When Blue was eventually taken to the Farm after the fall of Fabletown to Mr. Dark, his wound now seriously infected by the dark magic contained within the witching cloak (which was originally a sack carried by Mr. Dark), Flycatcher attempted to use the magic given to him by Haven and the Sacred Grove to heal Blue. However, this attempt failed, and Flycatcher was reduced to tears as he told everyone to say their last goodbyes to his best friend. Blue died the next morning and was buried in Haven on the hill overlooking the baseball field there. Later, Flycatcher finally decided to follow Blue's advice and move forward with his feelings towards Red Riding Hood, kissing her, which caused him to accidentally transform back into a frog. However, he decided he had allowed the curse to dominate him for too long, and he managed to turned himself back under his own power. Shortly afterwards, Flycatcher was called forward on a sad matter when one of his goblin subjects, Mr. Brump, ate a squirrel Fable, Mr. Seedcrate, while drunk. Flycatcher begged Trusty John to find a way to allow Brump mercy and thereby keep him from breaking his policy about killing. Flycatcher used his magic to gain Blue's strength by touching his grave and hardened his heart, simply banishing Mr. Brump from Haven, under penalty of death if he should return. Then, tired of hiding his feelings, he asked Red Riding Hood to spend the night with him, which she happily agreed to. In \\"The Last Story of Flycatcher\\" (released at the end of issue #141), it is revealed that Flycatcher and Red Riding Hood eventually got married. They were shown to be happily raising their four children (Trent, Lucy, Bobby and an unnamed son) years after their previous appearance in the series. ==Personality and traits== Tall and decidedly gangly, Fly is almost universally popular in Fabletown, as he's known for being kind and friendly to all (if not exceptionally bright). Indeed, he is generally treated with respect and politeness even by the most shady and harsh fables in the town. He becomes an invaluable part of administering Fabletown as the primary custodian of the Woodlands office. Snow and Bigby name one of their children Ambrose in their friend's honor. Although still ostensibly searching for his family, Fly develops something of a crush on Briar Rose during their centuries in Fabletown, to the extent that his kiss was enough to wake her from her curse. Fables artist Mark Buckingham has stated that Flycatcher is his favorite character; Buckingham has said that he is the only truly innocent character in the series. This has since been backed up in the series itself, in which it has been noted that Flycatcher was the only Fable to reach the mundane world who had nothing to be forgiven, covered up, or otherwise absolved of, under the Fabletown amnesty. ==References== Flycatcher Category:Fictional beggars Category:Fictional princes Category:Comics characters introduced in 2002 Category:Characters created by Bill Willingham Category:Fictional frogs and toads Category:Comics about animals Category:Comics about amphibians ","title":"Flycatcher (comics)"},{"id":"11654839","text":"David Porter (1849 - August 7, 1893) was an Ontario businessman and political figure.

From 1665‚Äì1666 and 1668‚Äì1669 he was a boy member of the court orchestra conducted by Daniel Danielis (1635-1696) of Duke Gustav Adolph of Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow. He was a bass singer at the Danish court music ensemble in Copenhagen in 1669 and in June 1670 moved to the Swedish court orchestra under Gustaf D√ºben the elder (ca. 1628-1690), a position he held until June 1679, having applied unsuccessfully for the position of choirmaster of St. John's in Hamburg in 1674. He became organist of the German church in Gothenburg, and in November 1684 moved to Copenhagen, where he succeeded J.M. Radeck as organist of the Helligaandskirke, a post he held to his death, and also the Trinitatis Church, after marrying his widow Magdalena Sibylla in May 1685 (a practice by no means rare). He succeeded Johann Lorentz as organist of the Church of Holmen in Copenhagen in 1689. He died, with his third wife and all their children, of the bubonic plague. ==Music== Sixty of his vocal works have survived, all but two of a sacred nature, with Latin texts; they were probably composed during his time in Stockholm. Most are intended for court performance, and one third for use in church services, but he also wrote larger works for royal ceremonies; Quis hostis in coelis and Domine in virtute were written for Charles XI's accession to the throne in 1672. His vocal works are related in form and style to the contemporary Italian concerted motet; indeed, he called them motetto. They are generally in sections which alternate in texture and scoring, and include ariosos or arias for solo voice. The simple counterpoint and expressive harmonic and melodic nature of these works is typically Italian, while his extravagant use of the violin and viol is rooted in the German tradition. His music is somewhat similar to that of Marco Giuseppe Peranda and Vincenzo Albrici, Kaspar F√∂rster, and Dieterich Buxtehude. The manuscripts of his compositions reside in the library of the University of Uppsala, and some have been published as C. Geist: 15 Ausgew√§hlte Kirchenkonzerte, edited by B. Lundgren, in Das Erbe deutscher Musik, 1st series, XLVIII (1960). Six vocal works on German texts were written during his time as organist of the German church in Gothenburg; they are typical of German Protestant works; chorale settings, sacred arias, and a concerto with aria. Three organ works of doubtful authorship have been published as Tre koralf√∂rspel, ed. Lundgren (Stockholm, 1943); these are chorale preludes on \\"Allein Gott in der H√∂h sei Ehr\\" (All glory be to God on high); Aus tiefer Not schrei ich zu dir (From deep affliction I cry out to you), using the melody by Wolfgang Dachstein rather than the more well-known one by Martin Luther, and Gelobet seist du, Jesu Christ (Praise to you, Jesus Christ). These works fall into the tradition of the North German school of organ music. ==Further reading== * Johann Mattheson: Grundlage einer Ehren- Pforte (Hamburg, 1740) * Andr√© Pirro: Dietrich Buxtehude (Paris, 1913) * Geoffrey Webber: North German Church Music in the Age of Buxtehude (Oxford, 1996) * Lars Berglund: Studier i Christian Geists vokalmusik [Studies in the Vocal Works of Christian Geist] (dissertation, University of Uppsala 2002) ==Sources== *Kerala J.

It was Minneapolis's first public football stadium. The Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board built the 16,560-seat stadium at The Parade, a park just west of downtown, in 1951. It was meant for high school, amateur, and small-college games. The stadium was also used for summertime Minneapolis Aquatennial festivities for over forty years. ==History== Thomas Lowry, who lived on a hill overlooking the grounds, and others donated most of the land for The Parade to the Minneapolis park board in 1904. The board did not act on Lowry's suggestion for a golf course for the park but did express its intent to use the area for active recreation purposes. In the spring of 1908, the park board developed five baseball fields at The Parade, which were the city's first public recreation facilities. They were so popular that a permit system was created. Two more baseball fields were added in the summer. The ball fields had practices every weeknight and games every Saturday. Athletics were not allowed on Sundays. That fall football goal posts were installed. The first citywide track meet was held in 1910 and the park board built four tennis courts in 1911. Woodrow Wilson gave a campaign speech at The Parade in 1912. After the seven baseball and two football fields were re-graded and open for play in 1914, the park became the center of amateur sports in the city. In the 1920s, some football games at The Parade attracted standing crowds estimated at 5,000 spectators. The park board proposed building a stadium there in 1933, and applied for federal public-works funding, but were unsuccessful. It tried again, in 1944, when it added a stadium to its list of \\"post-war progress\\" projects. The board claimed the city needed a stadium with a seating capacity between the huge Memorial Stadium at the University of Minnesota and various small park and school athletic fields. In 1950, the city finally approved $600,000 in bonds over two years to build only the stadium. To make room for it, the park board moved The Parade tennis center to Nicollet Park, since renamed Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Park. The stadium hosted its first major event in July 1951, when the Lone Ranger and Silver appeared at an Aquatennial children's event. That September, an exhibition football game between the Green Bay Packers and San Francisco 49ers drew 20,000 fans. At first, the stadium was a financial success, partly because of revenue from hosting an annual National Football League (NFL) exhibition game. But Parade Stadium was never intended to host professional games. When Metropolitan Stadium was built in Bloomington in 1956 to attract professional baseball and football to Minnesota, the yearly NFL exhibition game was played there. Parade Stadium continued hosting about 50 football games a year. The most popular were Friday-night and Saturday-night Minneapolis high school games. It hosted the annual Minnesota high school all-star football game for many years. Includes aerial photo. Augsburg University's football team used Parade Stadium as its home field from 1951 to 1983. It also was the starting point of the two Aquatennial parades each summer. The park board booked other events, from midget-car races to circuses. But area residents objected to the noise and traffic. The costs of maintaining the stadium soon exceeded revenue. By the mid-1960s, the only moneymaker at The Parade was the parking lot. After the Guthrie Theater opened across the street in May 1963, most of its patrons parked in the stadium lot. In the mid-1960s, Parade Stadium generated income by booking top musical acts for outdoor rock concerts. Buffalo Springfield, Jefferson Airplane, Fleetwood Mac, and Blondie, among others, played there. Singer Melissa Manchester drew the stadium's largest crowd of 30,000 in June 1976. The last big-name act to play at Parade Stadium was Simon and Garfunkel in July 1983. Eventually, music promoters became unwilling to meet the growing limitations placed on concerts by the park board to address complaints from people who lived near the stadium. By 1986, only five events were booked there, two of which were Aquatennial parades. The structure was 35 years old, and the park board estimated that it needed $250,000 in renovations. In 1988, the park board collaborated with the Walker Art Center to create the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden on park land next to the stadium. The Sculpture Garden's popularity led to its expansion in 1990. A heavily used softball field had to be moved to accommodate that expansion. The logical place to put it was where the little-used stadium stood. As a result, Parade Stadium was demolished in 1990, the softball field was moved, and the Sculpture Garden expanded. The Walker paid the million-dollar price tag for demolition of the stadium and relocation of the softball field. ===NFL preseason games at Parade Stadium=== *September 12, 1951 San Francisco 49ers 20-0 Green Bay Packers *September 17, 1952 Pittsburgh Steelers 7-6 Green Bay Packers *August 22, 1953 Green Bay Packers 31-7 New York Giants *August 14, 1954 Chicago Cardinals 27-10 Green Bay Packers *September 6, 1955 New York Giants 17-14 Baltimore Colts *August 25 1962 St Louis Cardinals 24-21 Minnesota Vikings ==Current uses== Since the football stadium was demolished, the baseball field on the site has been called Parade Stadium.

The entire athletic complex is called Parade Park and includes the three-sheet Parade Ice Garden. ==References== ===Sources=== * Charles E. Doell papers.

Named for the Island of Oahu, third largest island in the Hawaiian chain, it was the second US Naval vessel to bear the name. ==Construction== Oahu was laid down 14 August 1943, as the liberty ship SS Caleb C. Wheeler, under a Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MCE hull 1782, by the Bethlehem-Fairfield Shipyard, Inc., in Baltimore, Maryland; launched 9 September 1943; sponsored by Mrs. O. F. Hurt; acquired by the Navy from MARCOM 15 September 1943; converted by the Maryland Drydock Company, Baltimore, Maryland; and commissioned 4 April 1944, Commander Clyde Lovelace in command. == Service history == Following a Chesapeake Bay shakedown, the repair ship Oahu departed Hampton Roads, Virginia, 16 May 1944, steaming south and then west. Transiting the Panama Canal, she headed out into the Pacific. On 8 July, she arrived at Eniwetok and on 11 July, began repairing the damaged vessels of the Pacific Fleet. Oahu remained based at Eniwetok for the greater part of the next eight months. There she kept Allied vessels, naval and merchant, in trim and prepared them for the Philippine and Iwo Jima operations. Moving forward to Ulithi at the end of February 1945, she serviced the ships gathering for the invasion of Okinawa during March and then returned to the Marshalls. Oahu continued her work at Eniwetok until 6 December, when she got underway for the United States. == Decommissioning and post-war == Arriving at San Pedro, California, 25 December, Oahu, having repaired over two thousand ships during the war, was ordered to San Diego, California, to complete repair and pre- inactivation work on vessels going into mothballs. On 22 November she herself was ordered inactivated, and decommissioned in January 1947. She was berthed at San Diego as a unit of the Pacific Reserve Fleet until transferred 13 March 1962, and laid up at Suisun Bay. On 1 July 1963, she was permanently transferred to the Maritime Administration (MARAD). She remained there as a unit of the National Defense Reserve Fleet until being sold to General Metals of Tacoma, Inc., on 27 March 1978. She was withdrawn 7 June 1978, for scrapping. == Awards == Oahu received one battle star for World War II service. == Notes == == Bibliography == ===Online resources=== * * * * ==External links== * Ships of the U.S. Navy, 1940-1945 AR - Repair Ships * Liberty Ships built by the United States Maritime Commission in World War II * HyperWar: Beans, Bullet and Black Oil (Appendix) * Photo gallery at navsource.org Category:Luzon-class repair ships Category:Ships built in Baltimore Category:1943 ships Category:World War II auxiliary ships of the United States Category:United States Navy Hawaii-related ships ","title":"USS Oahu (ARG-5)"},{"id":"11655048","text":"Mega Twins, also known as in Japan, is a side-scrolling action game released for the arcades by Capcom in 1990. It was the tenth game released for the CP System hardware. ==Plot== The game features two twins who are attempting to re-take control of their land, Alurea, after a monster unexpectedly attacks, destroying everything in its path. The people of Alurea have lived in peace for a thousand years and have forgotten how to fight, yet the land's only survivors, the twin sons of the king, must take up the challenge and return their kingdom to its former glory. The two twins, aged around 15 at the time the game takes place, venture forth in search of a legendary stone known as \\"Dragon Blue Eyes\\", which is rumoured to be able to put everything back to rights. ==Gameplay== The game takes the form of a scrolling platform game, with the players controlling the characters of the twins. The game can be played alone (in which case only one of the twins is present), or with two players together controlling one twin each. In addition to moving around, the players can jump and also cling on to vertical walls, allowing them to climb to areas that would otherwise be out of reach. Each player is armed with a magic sword, which is the main weapon used against the enemies in the game. Magic bombs can also be collected as the game progresses, each of which will cause damage to all enemies on the screen when fired. Only a limited number of these bombs can be carried by the players at a time. The blue twin does more damage with his sword, while the red twin can carry more magic spells at a time. Each player has an energy bar which is depleted each time contact is made with an enemy or projectile. When the energy reaches zero, the player loses a life. Chests are scattered throughout the game (some of which are hidden and must be discovered), the majority of which contain coins that add point to the players' scores, but some of them contain power ups and bonuses such as a pill that replenishes the players' energy bars and an enhanced magic sword. ===Levels=== The game is made up of nine levels: *Round 1 ‚Äì the earth‚Äîconsisting of a forest section and a lava-filled cavern. The goddess Callia is encountered at the end of this level. *Round 2 ‚Äì the heavens‚Äîat the end, the Shrine of Meius, the god of the heavens, is reached. *Round 3 ‚Äì under the sea‚Äîduring which the twins travel through a haunted sunken pirate ship. *Round 4, stage 1 ‚Äì jungle/crystal caverns. *Round 4, stage 2 ‚Äì the underwater foundations. *Round 4, stage 3 ‚Äì the monster castle dungeon. *Round 4, stage 4 ‚Äì into the sky. *Round 4, stage 5 ‚Äì ascent to the top of monster castle. *Round 5 ‚Äì escape to paradise. The player is able to select to start on any of the first three levels, but the remaining levels can only be accessed sequentially. ==Ports== U.S. Gold released ports of Mega Twins for the Atari ST and Commodore Amiga in 1991. Ports for the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC were advertised, but were never published, though unfinished Spectrum and Amstrad versions have since surfaced on the Internet. A Mega Drive/Genesis port of the game was released by Sega in 1992 and 1993. Developed by Visco Corporation, this port was released in North America and Europe under the game's original Japanese title of Chiki Chiki Boys. This port lacks the 2-player cooperative mode, but is otherwise identical to the arcade version in terms of content and quality. A PC-Engine Super CD-ROM¬≤ port was released in 1994 exclusively in Japan by NEC Avenue. This port features enhanced versions of most of the arcade's BGM soundtrack in CD-DA format; however, some used the PC-Engine's sound chip. Unlike the Genesis port, the PC-Engine Super CD-ROM¬≤ version includes multiplayer. ==Legacy== The game is included in Capcom Classics Collection: Remixed for the PlayStation Portable, and Capcom Classics Collection Volume 2 for PlayStation 2 and Xbox, both released in 2006. ==References== ==External links== * * (as Chiki Chiki Boys) *Chiki Chiki Boys at Jap-Sai Category:1990 video games Category:Amiga games Category:Arcade games Category:Atari ST games Category:Cancelled ZX Spectrum games Category:Platform games Category:Sega Genesis games Category:TurboGrafx- CD games Category:U.S. Gold games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Video games developed in Japan ","title":"Mega Twins"},{"id":"11655055","text":"Merluza could refer to one of several things * Merlucciidae, a family of cod- like fish. * Merluza, a character in the Japanese adult visual novel Furifuri ","title":"Merluza"},{"id":"11655058","text":"Weil as Judy Hensler in Leave It To Beaver Jeri Warner Weil (born May 15, 1948, in California), billed professionally as Jeri Weil, is an American former child actress, best known for her role as Judy Hensler in the classic television series Leave It to Beaver. ==Acting career== Prior to being cast on Leave It to Beaver, Weil had appeared in two TV series and six films in uncredited roles.

The earliest written form was Harenhg in about 1195. It gave rise to the names Harringay (the district of London), the London Borough of Haringey, and Hornsey (a nearby district of London). Its development into these three forms was complex and included at least 162 variations. Since the history of Hornsey is mostly common with that of present-day Harringay and the etymology is shared, both are covered in this section. The name of the London Borough of Haringey is included to explain spelling differences. In 1243, the name was recorded as Haringesheye, an intermediate form between the Saxon Heringes-hege and its three present-day forms. With the second ‚Äòg‚Äô pronounced as ‚Äòy‚Äô in Old English, it can be seen how close the two versions were. In 1371 Haryngeay was recorded, and 16 years later Haringey appeared for the first time, making it the oldest of the three present-day forms. Haryngay appeared in 1393 and Harringay in 1569. The variant that became Hornsey developed the addition of an 's' in the middle with the use of Harnsey, recorded in 1392, and Hornsey appeared in 1646., The writer is much indebted to the enormously scholarly work of Stephen Madge whose exhaustive and painstaking research conducted over a period of 35 years should be regarded as the definitive text on the origins of the name Harringay. The first part of this section is entirely based on his work. Until the close of the eighteenth century all variants referred to the same area, around present-day Harringay and Hornsey, but from the late Tudor period Hornsey took precedence in common usage: Harringay survived more as a legal entity and in the records of the Manor of Harringay. The building of the large mansion of Harringay House in 1792 at the top of the hill between present-day Hewitt and Allison Roads saw the divergence of meaning of the names. Hornsey referred to the present-day district and subsequently the parish and Middlesex borough; Harringay to the house, its surrounding park and finally the present- day district, and continued as the common name in manorial records. Whilst the early residents of Harringay continued to use that name, in official documents from the early twentieth century the Borough of Hornsey referred to it as Haringey, which became the name of the London Borough of Haringey, created in 1964 when the Boroughs of Hornsey, Wood Green and Tottenham merged. A letter from a council officer in 1984 said, \\"When Tottenham and Hornsey were joined to form the new borough in 1964, the choice of name rested with a special panel which, after public consultation, opted for one of the spellings of the modern Borough of Hornsey. We are not aware of the reasons for that choice\\". Pupils in local schools at the time were taught that the new borough's name should be pronounced with the same ending as Finchley, Hackney and Hornsey.Valerie Crosby, Archivist, Bruce Castle Archives, London Borough of Haringey, 2007 ==Prehistory to 1750== In the Ice Age, Harringay was at the edge of a huge glacial mass that reached as far south as Muswell Hill. There is evidence of both Stone Age and Bronze Age activity in the immediate vicinity. In the 5th and 6th centuries the Saxon invasions brought Haering, the chieftain whose name still lives on today in local placenames. At the time of Domesday, the western part of modern Harringay was within the Manor of Harengheie and part of the Bishop of London's principal Manor of Stepney. The eastern part was within the Manor of Tottenham held by Waltheof II, Earl of Northumbria, the last of the great Anglo-Saxon Earls. From Domesday to the middle of the eighteenth century, Harringay was transformed from a mainly forested area to a pastoral one. It remained sparsely inhabited. Beyond the clearance of the forests, few incursions were made into Harringay lands save for the New River, the building of which presaged the more drastic developments to come. ==1750 to 1880== In 1750 the area that was to become Harringay was almost all agricultural land with only a few buildings. Over the 130 years to 1880, significant parts were brought into a more modern use, either as comfortable houses or as parkland. Most notably, Harringay House was built at the top of the hill between the present-day Hewitt and Allison Roads. At the southern end of Green Lanes, a large tile kiln and pottery was developed. But by 1880, fewer than two dozen buildings existed. Finsbury Park and nearby Alexandra Park were laid out during this period. And, perhaps most significantly, two railways were built, which, more than anything, presaged the next chapter in Harringay's history. ==1880 ‚Äì present day== The last 20 years of the nineteenth century saw the disappearance of Harringay House with the surrounding parkland and farmland under the advance of late Victorian urbanisation. From 1900, Harringay was spread across the borders of the urban districts, later municipal boroughs, of Hornsey and Tottenham in Middlesex. Following the Second World War, Harringay began to change as immigration altered the character of the district. In 1965 it was unified under one local authority with the creation of the London Borough of Haringey. ==Harringay and entertainment== From 1750 until the second half of the twentieth century Harringay gained fame as an entertainment centre. In the second half of the eighteenth century Hornsey Wood House was developed as a private leisure park and became one of the most popular places for Londoners to escape from the city at the weekends. Finsbury Park, the development of which swept the old tavern away, was the first major metropolitan park in England and was hugely popular in its heyday. In the early twentieth century Harringay Stadium and Harringay Arena drew crowds to the area. ==Economic history== Relying on agriculture for most of its recorded history, Harringay had a busy tile kiln, pottery and brickfields from the late eighteenth to the early twentieth century. ==Transport & communications history== The history of transport and communications through Harringay had a significant effect on shaping it today. ===Early roadways=== In Roman times, a great road to the north was established.See Early history page. This endured as a great line of communication and brought much activity through the heart of the area. It also acted as the rough dividing line for land ownership, identifying Harringay's position on the edge of manorial and subsequently borough boundaries. ===Rail=== In the mid-nineteenth century, the arrival of the Great Northern Railway (GNR) cleaved Harringay from the rest of its ancient borough. The subsequent arrival of the Tottenham and Hampstead Junction Railway (THJR) almost defined its present-day southern boundary. Harringay's development in the late nineteenth century was of a markedly different nature from what occurred to the west of the GNR and to the south of the THJR. ===The Tube=== On two occasions in the early twentieth century, a Tube station was almost built in Harringay. ==External links== * Harringay Online's Harringay Timeline *Hornsey Historical Society *Bruce Castle Museum *Hornsey Library Archives *A2A ‚Äì Access to Archives *A Vision of Britain through Time *Historic England's Images of England *Motco UK Directory and Image Database *City of London Collage online Historical Picture Database *Directory of London Photographers 1841 ‚Äì 1905 (Now maintained as an archive only) * Harringay online ‚Äì Website for Harringay residents with much information on Harringay and its history. ==References & notes== Category:History of the London Borough of Haringey Category:History of London by locality Category:History of Middlesex Category:Harringay ","title":"History of Harringay"},{"id":"11655068","text":"Staples2Naples was the first European Banger rally, organised by StreetSafari. == History == Staples2Naples started in 2003 when the first rally took place. ==External links== * Official Staples2Naples Website * The Three Blondes Doing Staples2Naples 2007 * Staples2Naples in the media - Channel 4 * Team MSportUK.com S2N05 (overshot by 1,804 miles) Category:Rally competitions in Italy ","title":"Staples2Naples"},{"id":"11655089","text":"Shrewley is a village and civil parish in Warwickshire, England, about 5 miles north-west of Warwick.

The land was acquired by deeds from private owners and the City of Gonzales in 1934 - 1936 and was opened in 1936. ==Features== The park is named for the dwarf palmetto (Sabal minor), which grows abundantly in the park. The San Marcos River runs through the park. The Oxbow Lake, initially created by flood waters, is now independent of the river and is spring fed. There are many bogs throughout the park that are surrounded by dense vegetation, giving the park a jungle-like atmosphere. The park was constructed by Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) Companies 873 and 886 between 1934 and 1937. The CCC built Park Road 11, a low water crossing on the San Marcos River, a water tower/storage building, refectory, and residence (currently the park headquarters), barbeque pits, picnic seating, rock pool and retention dams, rock table, culverts, concrete picnic tables, and two sets of entrance portals. ===Flora=== In addition to the dwarf palmetto, red buckeye and rattan vine are prevalent in the park. ===Fauna=== White-tailed deer are common throughout the park, as are raccoons, nine-banded armadillos, and fox squirrels. Over 240 species of birds such as the pileated woodpecker, and Kentucky warbler have been recorded within the park's boundaries. Some of the birds often spotted include the prothonotary warbler, and red-shouldered hawk. ==See also== * List of Texas state parks ==References== ==External links== * Texas Parks and Wildlife: Palmetto State Park Category:State parks of Texas Category:Protected areas of Gonzales County, Texas Category:Civilian Conservation Corps in Texas ","title":"Palmetto State Park"},{"id":"11655198","text":"Ishkur's Guide to Electronic Music is an interactive online guide to electronic music created by Kenneth John Taylor, aka Ishkur.

He was one of the group's original members and co- wrote several of their biggest hits, including the 1965 Grammy Hall Of Fame- inducted \\"The Tracks of My Tears\\". He is also a winner of the BMI Songwriter's Award, and the ASCAP Award Of Merit, and was a 2012 posthumous inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with the Miracles. ==Biography== Referred to as the Miracles' \\"secret weapon\\", Tarplin began his career accompanying the Supremes, who at the time were still teenagers, and known as the Primettes. They were seeking an audition with Motown Records, and Tarplin played guitar as they performed for Miracles lead singer Smokey Robinson. Robinson was impressed by Tarplin's guitar playing, and lured him away from the Primettes to join the Miracles in 1958. In the 2006 Motown DVD release, Smokey Robinson & the Miracles: The Definitive Performances 1963‚Äì1987, Robinson and fellow Miracles Pete Moore and Bobby Rogers commented that Tarplin's guitar playing style was reminiscent of the late Curtis Mayfield, and was the inspiration behind many of their greatest hits. His guitar riffs at the beginning of the Miracles' 1965 Grammy Hall of Fame million-seller, \\"The Tracks of My Tears\\", are among the most famous in pop music history. Whilst Tarplin remained with the Miracles for as long as Robinson was their lead singer, he is only present on the cover of three classic Miracles albums: Cookin' with the Miracles (1962), I'll Try Something New (1962), and The Fabulous Miracles (1963). He is mentioned, though not pictured, on the back cover of the group's very first album, Hi... We're the Miracles (1961), and listed as an original group member. As a songwriter, Tarplin helped co-compose many of the Miracles' hit singles, amongst them the million-selling Grammy Hall of Fame winner \\"The Tracks of My Tears\\" for which he received the ASCAP Award Of Merit (1965), \\"My Girl Has Gone\\" (1965), \\"I Like It Like That\\", (1964), \\"Going to a Go-Go\\" (1965), \\"The Love I Saw in You Was Just a Mirage\\" (1967), and \\"Point It Out\\" (1968). In addition, Tarplin co-wrote several Robinson-produced hits by Marvin Gaye, including the Top 10 million selling hits, \\"Ain't That Peculiar\\" and \\"I'll Be Doggone\\". His guitar work was featured on Gaye's Top 40 hit, \\"One More Heartache\\", which he also co-wrote, and another of Gaye's chart hits, 1965's \\"Take This Heart of Mine\\". He also played on The Four Tops 1970 Top 20 hit, \\"Still Water (Love)\\", co-written by Robinson, and The Marvelettes' 1967 Top 20 hit, \\"My Baby Must Be a Magician\\". Tarplin also appeared with the group on The Ed Sullivan Show, the 1964 film, The T.A.M.I. Show, the 1965 CBS television special, Murray The K - It's What's Happening, Baby, and virtually all of the group's personal appearance concerts worldwide, including the Motortown Revue shows in the early 1960s. Marv also appeared onstage with the Miracles on the 1983 NBC-TV music special Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever . Tarplin left the Miracles in 1973, shortly after Smokey Robinson and his wife Claudette left the group. His replacement in the Miracles was Donald Griffin, brother of Billy Griffin.(Robinson's replacement in the group). Robinson and Tarplin continued to collaborate as writers on Robinson's solo recordings, including hits such as \\"Cruisin'\\" (1979‚Äì1980) and the \\"Being with You\\" (1981). Tarplin also continued to play guitar on record and in concert for Robinson, and, until 2008, continued to tour with Robinson. In 2007, Milwaukee, Wisconsin musician, Paul Cebar, paid homage to Tarplin with his song \\"Marv's Fluttering Guitar (For Marv Tarplin)\\" from the album Tomorrow Sound Now For Yes Music People. ==Rock and Roll Hall of Fame controversy== In 1987, Smokey Robinson was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist. However, in a decision that has since sparked much scrutiny, debate, and controversy, Tarplin, and the other original members of the Miracles, Bobby Rogers, Ronnie White, Pete Moore and Claudette Robinson, were not. The Miracles were finally retroactively inducted into the hall by a special committee in 2012, alongside Smokey Robinson. Tarplin retired from touring in 2008 and is pictured on the cover of the 2009 Motown CD release The Miracles ‚Äì Depend On Me: The Early Albums. ==Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction in 2012== On February 9, 2012 (just 5 months after his death), it was announced that Marv Tarplin would be posthumously inducted with the rest of the Miracles into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame alongside group lead singer Smokey Robinson. This induction occurred on April 14, 2012. After a 26-year wait, Marvin was automatically and retroactively inducted with the rest of the original Miracles, Bobby Rogers, Pete Moore, Claudette Robinson, and Ronnie White into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame alongside Miracles lead singer Smokey Robinson. The induction was handled by a special committee designated in 2012 to induct the Miracles and five other pioneering groups that had been overlooked when their lead singers had been inducted into the Rock Hall many years previously. This induction occurred without the usual process of nomination and voting, under the premise that the entire group should have been inducted with Smokey Robinson back in 1987. ==Later years and death== Three years after leaving Robinson, Tarplin died in his Las Vegas home of undetermined causes on September 30, 2011. He was 70. Tarplin has 3 daughters named Talese, Lisa and Eboney. ==Compositions== Tarplin wrote the music for numerous songs, including several of Motown's biggest hits.

Harte & McDonald performed a Shocking Pinks gig at the Media Club in his hometown of Christchurch in December, 2003. This performance was attended by Tim Baird who ran local label Pinacolada Records; Baird subsequently funded and released the original version of the Shocking Pinks' debut album 'Dance the Dance Electric' on February 14th, 2004. This release featured a full-band lineup and introduced Harte's sound, which nodded to the sound of classic New Zealand bands such as The Clean and The Bats, as well as My Bloody Valentine's shoegaze sounds, and a budding dance-punk scene. The album earned strong reviews, including an 8.2 score on Pitchfork Media. In the wake of this success, international labels became interested (including James Murphy of DFA Records who would later work with the band). The debut album was later reissued on vinyl by Dutch record label Geertruida in 2015. The Shocking Pinks then signed to the legendary New Zealand imprint Flying Nun Records and released two further albums in 2005, Mathematical Warfare and Infinity Land, which Harte wrote and performed on his own. DFA Records signed Harte and released a series of limited-edition singles, which included remixes by The Glimmers, Deerhunter, Eluvium, and Arkitype, before issuing the self-titled album, Shocking Pinks, in the autumn of 2007 ‚Äîlargely a remastered compilation of songs from Mathematical Warfare and Infinity Land. ===Signing to Stars & Letters and Guilt Mirrors=== In November 2013 Shocking Pinks signed to Brooklyn label, Stars & Letters Records, and announced the release of a new triple album called Guilt Mirrors.

P. ananas has the widest distribution among the species of the genus, occurring throughout lowlands in entire Amazon (including Rio Negro) and Essequibo River basins. P. cristata has only been recorded from middle portion of the Negro River basin. ==Description== Physopyxis have an extremely small size among doradids, not exceeding SL. Their pectoral fin spine reaches the base of the anal fin, and the dorsal fin spine is serrated only at the anterior margin of its base. There are three pairs of barbels, one pair of maxillary barbels and two pairs of mental barbels. The dorsal and pectoral fin spines are strongly ossified and well-developed. P. cristata can be differentiated from the other species by its incomplete lateral line and a series of small spines along its dorsal midline. The other two species have complete lateral lines with well-developed plates that extend to the caudal fin. P. lyra has only one series of spines on its lateral plates and its adipose fin is usually present. The lateral plates have two or more series of spines in P. ananas, and the adipose fin is usually absent. ==Habitat== Physopyxis species are usually found in places with accumulated organic debris, like dense meshes of roots of floating macrophytes that are abundant in rivers with turbid water or submerged litter banks. Specimens also can be found among submerged leaf litter and among root mats of riparian plants, like Symmeria paniculata (Polygonaceae). P. lyra is predominantly nocturnal, and spends most of day time sheltered among submersed root mats or buried in sand. P. ananas and P. lyra have been found together among the submerged roots of aquatic macrophytes (Paspallum repens, Poaceae) at Aman√£ Lake, Japur√° River basin. They were also collected together in Nanay upstream from Iquitos. Dwarf cichlids of the genus Apistogramma and juvenile specimens of Amblydoras were found in the same habitat as P. cristata. ==References== Category:Doradidae Category:Fish of South America Category:Fauna of the Amazon Category:Catfish genera Category:Taxa named by Edward Drinker Cope Category:Freshwater fish genera ","title":"Physopyxis"},{"id":"11655416","text":"\\"Shores of California\\" is the third single by The Dresden Dolls duo, taken from the second studio album Yes, Virginia....

The home run was unusual because Frazier's bat slipped out of his hands as he was swinging. The same day, he had saved the life of a man choking on a piece of steak by administering the Heimlich maneuver. Of the latter experience, he said, \\"I gave two pumps and it came out . . . It was pretty surreal. I have never done that before.\\" On November 5, 2012, Frazier was named the Players Choice Awards National League Outstanding Rookie by the MLB Players Association.

Upon Frazier's arrival in New York, he changed his jersey number from No. 21 to No. 29, as No. 21 is unofficially retired by the Yankees for outfielder Paul O'Neill. Frazier had worn No. 21 throughout his entire career in honor of O'Neill, as he had grown up a Yankees fan in New Jersey. Frazier had stated that he hoped to speak to O'Neill to gain permission to wear the number; however, clubhouse manager Rob Cucuzza told Frazier that it would not happen. On July 25, 2017, against his former team, the Cincinnati Reds, Frazier hit into a run-scoring triple play in his first home at-bat as a Yankee.

Its members are known as Western Gangas to distinguish them from the Eastern Gangas who in later centuries ruled over modern Orissa. The Western Gangas ruled as a sovereign power from the middle of fourth century to middle of sixth century, initially from Kolar, later moving their capital to Talakad on the banks of the Kaveri River in modern Mysore district. Though territorially a small kingdom, the Western Ganga contribution to polity, culture and literature of the modern south Karnataka region is considered noteworthy. The Ganga kings showed benevolent tolerance to all faiths but are most famous for their patronage towards Jainism resulting in the construction of fine monuments in such places as Shravanabelagola and Kambadahalli. ==Religion== The Western Gangas gave patronage to all the major religious faiths of the time; Jainism and different sects of Hinduism such as Shaivism, Vaishnavism and Mƒ´mƒÅ·πÉsƒÅ school. However scholars have argued that not all Ganga kings may have given equal priority to all the faiths. Some historians believe the Gangas were ardent Jains,Dr. Lewis Rice, S. R. Sharma and M. V. Krishna Rao though inscriptional evidence is not conclusive since they mention kalamukhas (staunch Shaiva ascetics), pasupatas and lokayatas (followers of Pasupatha doctrine) who flourished in Gangavadi, indicating Shaivism was also popular. King Madhava and Harivarman were devoted of cows and Brahmins and King Vishnugopa was a devout Vaishnava.Srikantha Shastri in Kamath (2001), p49 Madhava III's and Avinita's inscriptions describe lavish endowments to Jain orders and temples.Adiga (2006), p249 There is also inscriptional evidence King Durvinita performed Vedic sacrifices prompting historians to claim he was a Hindu and was either a Vaishnavite or a Shaivite.Srikanta Sastri in However, Western Ganga records from the 8th century reveal a strong Jain influence evidenced by the many basadis they built and due to popularity of saints such as Pushpdanta, Pujyapada, Vajranandi, Srivaradhadeva, Ajitasena.Kamath (2001), p49 ===Jainism=== Gommateshwara at Shravanabelagola (982‚Äì983) C.E. Panchakuta Basadi, Kambadahalli Seeyamangalam Mahavira Rock Cut Temple Prior to the 8th century, Jain temples were called Chaitya, Cediya, Jainalaya, Jinageha or Jinabhavana, the term Basadi being used only later on.Adiga (2006), p251 Jain popularity received a further boost from the Ganga overlords, the Rashtrakutas, from the time of Amoghavarsha I. However evidence shows a decline in its popularity among local leadership (landlords or gavundas) from the 10th century when they began to favour Shaivism .Adiga (2006), p253 The true age of Jain popularity in the region was from the 8th century rule of King Shivamara I leading to the construction of numerous basadis.From the Kulaganga and Narasimhapura copper plates (Adiga 2006, p255) King Butuga II and minister Chavundaraya were staunch Jains which is evident from the construction of the Gomateshwara monolith.From the Kudlur plates of Butuga II (Adiga 2006, p256) A historian has claimed that majority of those Jains seeking release from the material world (moksha) by inviting death through rituals and asceticism (sannyasa) were from the aristocratic and prosperous mercantile community, such rituals among people from lower social classes being a rarity.Settar in Adiga (2006), p258 Women made endowments to Jain causes too, a royal concubine Nandavva and a wealthy feudal lady Attimabbe being examples.Adiga (2006), p259 Jains worshipped the twenty four Tirthankaras (Jinas), whose images were consecrated in their temples. Some scholars believe that Jain worship was not meant to gain boons or favours from the deity, rather to meditate and obtain perfection through detachment.Upadhye, Stevenson et al. in Adiga (2006), p261 However one historian claims a study of contemporary Jain literature reveals that spiritual and temporal benefits ware sought.Singh in Adiga (2006), p262 The assignment of creative and destructive powers to tirthankars is considered a parallel to the beliefs of Hindus who assigned these powers to Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, the holy trinity (Trimurti).Adiga (2006), p262 The worship of the footprint of spiritual leaders such as those of Bhadrabahu in Shravanabelagola from the 10th century is considered a parallel to Buddhism.P.B.Desai and Jaiswal in Adiga (2006), pp263-264 Some brahminical influences are seen in the consecration of the Gomateshwara monolith which is the statue of Bahubali, the son of tirthankar Adinatha (just as Hindus worshipped the sons of Shiva).Adiga (2006), p264 The worship of subordinate deities such as yakshas and yakshinis, earlier considered as mere attendants of the tirthankaras, was a development of the 7th century to 12th century.Adiga (2006), pp264-265 This is considered the beginning of devotional cults which elevated yakshi Jvalamalini Kalpa and Bhairava Padmavati Kalpa to deity status. Jvalamalini, depicted with flames issuing forth from her head and holding such attributes as a bow, shield, arrows, sword, discuss (cakra) etc., in her eight arms and riding a buffalo was the attendant of the eighth tirthankara, Chandraprabha.Settar sees parallels in Buddhism and Hinduism (Adiga 2006, p265) Padmavati was the yaksi of the twenty-third tirthankara, Parshva, and may have been derived from the Hindu namesake.Nandi in Adiga (2006), p266 Cult worship is considered consistent with the assimilation of forest and tribal dwellers into the Jain faith and a caste based society.Adiga (2006), p266 While asceticism was upheld in the earlier period, an increased inflow of endowments from wealthy merchants and royalty made monks more settled in temples.Adiga (2006), p270 Prayers, chantings, decoration and anointment of the deity in Digambara temples were carried out by upajjhayas or acharyas. In contrast, lay devotees in Svetambara derasars undertook these activities and the temple staff merely did the cleaning.Paul Dundas in Adiga (2006), p280 Ascetics did not indulge in any direct contact with the image of the deity, rather they spent time in penance and contemplation.Adiga (2006), p280 A historian has proposed that Jain temples may have employed courtesans (Devadasi or Sule) though this may have been a post 10th century development.Chennakka Yeligar in Adiga (2006), p280 ===Hinduism=== Kalleshwara Temple Complex, built in the 10th century by the Nolambas, a Western Ganga feudatory, at Aralaguppe in the Tumkur district Vedic Brahminism was popular in the 6th and 7th centuries when inscriptions refer to grants made to Srotriya Brahmins. These inscriptions also describe the gotra (lineage) affiliation to royal families and their adherence of such Vedic rituals as ashvamedha (horse sacrifice) and hiranyagarbha.From the Bendiganhalli and Bangalore copper plates, the Chaluvanahalli plates, Kutalur grant, Kadagattur and Nallala grants of King Durvinita, Kondunjeruvu grant of King Avinita (Adiga 2006, pp281-282) Brahmins and kings enjoyed a mutually beneficial relationship, rituals performed by the Brahmins gave legitimacy to kings and the land grants made by kings to Brahmins elevated them in society to the level of wealthy landowners who brought forest dwellers into the religious caste based society.Adiga (2006), p282 During the later part of the Ganga rule, with the rise in Jain popularity, patronage to Brahmins reduced. The Brahmins now sought and occupied influential positions in the military and administration.Adiga (2006), p283 Brahmins started to make donations to building memorials for fallen heroes and land grants to build temples.From 7th century Kannada inscription in Aihole describing endowment made by Mahajans (brahmins) to the excavation of a cavern in memory of King Pulakeshin II, the Punajur and Madur inscriptions (Adiga 2006, pp288-9) By the end of the 10th century, Brahmins resident in agraharas (schools of learning) were participating in puranic forms of worship in temples, constructing new ones or acting as trusties for devabhoga grants (temple grants).Adiga (2006), p291 Vaishnavism, however, was in a low profile and not many inscriptions describe grants towards its cause.Adiga (2006), p313 Some Vaishnava temples built by the Gangas were the Narayanaswami temples in Nanjangud, Sattur and Hangala in modern Mysore district, Kodandarama and Yoga Narasimha temples at modern Chikkamagaluru district and the Nolamba Narayaneshvara temple at Avani in modern Kolar district.From the Kalkunda inscription (Adiga 2006, pp314-316) The deity Vishnu was depicted with four arms holding a conch (Shanka), discus (chakra), mace (gada) and lotus (Padma).Adiga (2006), p317 From the beginning of the 8th century, patronage to Shaivism increased from every section of society; from the landed elite, the landlords, the assemblies (samaya) and the schools of learning (aghraharas). Hereditary ruling families such as the Bana, Nolamba and Chalukya clans gave patronage to the Shaivism.From the Nandi copper plates of Rashtrakuta Govinda III of 800, Koyattur-12000 grant of King Dodda Naradhipa Bana in 810, the Ganiganur inscription, Nolamba King Mahendradhirajas grant of his house towards a Shaiva temple in 878, Baragur inscription of 914 of King Ayappadeva Nolamba, the Ninneshvaradeva temple built by King Dilipayya Nolamba in 942 (Adiga 2006, pp293-294) Among minor Chalukya kings in Gangavadi region, Narasinga Chalukya of Mysore constructed the Narasingeshwara temple and Kings Goggi and Durga build the Buteshvara temple at Varuna in modern Mysore region.From the Kukkarahalli, Manalevadi, Aragodupalli and Torevalli inscriptions, (Adiga 2006, 294) Shaivism received patronage from local landlords, particularly from the 9th century onwards when temple priests and ascetics played an active role in temple construction.From the Homma inscription, inscription of Pontiff Tribhuvna Kavttara Bhatara of Avanya (Adiga 2006, pp298-99) Unlike the Jainism where strict doctrines prevented ascetics and monks from being involved in temple based activities, such regulations did not hamper the Shaiva preceptors who dedicated their energies towards gathering devotee support for monastic activities.Adiga (2006), p300 The Shaiva temples enshrined a Shiva linga (phallus) in the sanctum sanctorum along with images of the mother goddess and Surya (Sun god) for worship.This was popularised by the kalamukha monks (Adiga 2006, p292) Sometimes Vaishnava deity images were included asserting the all encompassing nature of Shiva. Nandi (a bull and attendant of Shiva) was normally enshrined in a separate pavilion facing the sanctum.Adiga (2006), p301H.V.Stietencron in Adiga 2006, p303 The linga was man made and on occasion had etchings of Ganapati (son of Shiva) and Parvati (consort and wife of Shiva) on it. Due to the vigorous efforts of priests and ascetics, Shaiva monastic orders flourished in many places including modern Nandi Hills, Avani and Hebbata in Kolar district, Baragur and Hemavati in Tumkur district, Pemjeru, Mysore and Shimoga.From Nandi copper plates of 800, Avani pillar inscription, Perbetta hero stones, 878 inscription of Nolamba Mahendradhiraja, Baragur inscription of 919, 942 Tumkur grant and Basavanahalli inscriptions (Adiga 2006, p304-305) Apart from these monasteries, seats of kalamukha orders existed in modern Kolar, Mysore and Tumkur districts. These orders were less visible in modern Hassan and Chikkamagaluru regions where Jainism was popular.From the Kempanapura inscription of 991, Kannambadi and Atakur inscriptions of 949 (Adiga 2006, p304) ==Notes== ==References== * * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:Social history of Karnataka Category:Western Ganga dynasty ","title":"Religion in Western Ganga kingdom"},{"id":"11655518","text":"Limacoidea is a taxonomic superfamily of medium-sized to large, air-breathing land slugs and snails.

They are known as Western Gangas to distinguish them from the Eastern Gangas who in later centuries ruled over modern Orissa. The Western Gangas ruled as a sovereign power from the middle of fourth century to middle of sixth century, initially from Kolar, later moving their capital to Talakad on the banks of the Kaveri River in modern Mysore district. Though territorially a small kingdom, the Western Ganga contribution to polity, culture, society and literature of the modern south Karnataka region is considered noteworthy. ==Society== wall relief sculpture at Shravanabelagola The society in the Western Ganga kingdom evolved during a time when many devotional movements were popularised, the local vernacular became important and the life of women was vastly changed from one that was domesticated to one of greater degree of emancipation and responsibility. Inscriptional evidence proves women became active in local administration.Adiga (2006), p203 It is known that Ganga kings distributed territorial responsibility to princes and their queens, an example being feudal queen Parabbaya-arasi of Kundattur,From the Kuntur inscription of 10th century (Adiga 2006, p203) the queen of King Sripurusha, Butuga II and Permadi all shared government responsibilities with their respective kings.Karmarkar (1947), p66 Inheritance of fiscal and administrative responsibility by women is also evident. A position of nalgavunda (local landlord) which had been bestowed upon Jakkiabbe, the wife of a fallen hero was later passed on to her daughter when Jakkiabbe took to asceticism.from the Bandalike inscription of 919 (Adiga 2006, p203) It was a common practice for the son-in-law of the family to inherit administrative responsibility upon the demise of an incumbent without sons, an example is the prime ministerial position under King Ereganga II that was inherited by the son-in-law of the previous incumbent.From the Shravanabelagola inscription (Adiga 2006, p204) The devadasi system (sule or courtesan) in temples was prevalent and was modelled after the structures in the royal palace.Adiga (2006), p398 This information comes from contemporaneous literature such a Vaddaradhane which makes a mention of the chief queen (Dharani Mahadevi) accompanied by lower ranking queens (arasiyargal) and courtesans of the women's quarter (pendarasada suleyargal). Courtesans and concubines were employed in the harem of the kings and chieftains. Inscriptions attest that some of them were well respected, examples being Nandavva at whose instance a local chief made land grant to a Jain temple,From the Perur plates (Adiga 2006, p398) JogabbeFrom the Heggothara inscription (Adiga 2006, p398) and Birakka.From the Bevinakuppe inscription (Adiga 2006, p398) The courtesans of the royal family were meant for the pleasure of kings and those of the royal court were meant for the entertainment of the courtiers.Adiga (2006), p399 Distinction between principle queens, lawfully wedded wives and inmates of the harem was clear. Kings were entertained at the bath by women who sang, played musical instruments and bathed with him or bathed while he watched. The one who pleased him the most was sent to the royal chambers later for the kings pleasure. No two women of the harem lived in the same quarters and beautiful girls were often purchased to make additions to the harem.Karmarkar (1947), p108 The devadasi system in temples was very popular of who there were two types; the angabhoga who had responsibilities closely related to and including bathing of the deity, daily worship, offering daily food (naivedya), betel leaf and areca nut to the deity while the rangabhoga was mainly concerned with the dance hall where she performed during special functions. On account of her close affiliation with the sanctum of the temple, the angabhoga devadasi was held in higher esteem than the rangabhoga.Yeligar in Adiga (2006), p399 Education in the royal family was closely supervised and included such subjects as political science, elephant and horse riding, archery, medicine, poetry, grammar, drama, literature, dance, singing and use of musical instruments. Brahmins enjoyed a high position in society and were exempt from certain taxes and customs due on land on the condition they carry out or manage public affairs such as teaching and local judiciary.Karmarkar (1945), p72 Also known as Mahajans, Brahmins performed other functions; as trustees and bankers, in management of school, temples, tanks, rest houses, collection of taxes due from villages and raising monies from public subscriptions, making them influential with those in higher command.Karmarkar (1947), p74 By virtue of an Hindu belief that killing of a Brahmin (Bramhatya) was a sin, capital punishment was not applicable to them. Alternately, severe crimes committed by a Brahmin was punishable by the severing of a foot or hand.From the notes of Alberuni and Bouchet (Karmarkar 1947, p103) Upper caste kshatriyas performed religious sacrifices, studied the Vedas, followed the puranic beliefs and like Brahmins were exempt from capital punishment. Contemporary literary sources reveal up to ten castes in the Hindu caste system; three of kshatriya, three types of Brahmin, two among vaishya and two among shudras.From the notes of Yuan Chwang (Karmarkar 1947, p103) Family laws permitted the wife and daughter or surviving relatives to claim property such as home, land, grain, money etc., if the deceased had no male heirs. If no claimants to the property existed, the state took possession of the same calling it Dharmadeya assets (charitable assets) From a modern Bijapur inscription of 1178 (Karmarkar, 1947, p104) Brahmins began using such surnames as \\"Dvivedi\\", \\"Upadhyaya\\", \\"Dikshit\\", \\"Pandvta\\", \\"Prasanna Sarawati\\" etc., during this time.Karmarkar 1947, p105 Intercaste marriage, child marriage, marriage of boys to maternal uncles daughter, Svayamvara marriage (where the bride garlands her choice of a groom from among many aspirants) were all in vogue.The Svayamvara marriage of Chalukya King Vikramaditya VI to Chandaladevi in the 11th century being an example (Karmarkar, 1947 p105) The system of purdah was unknown and women had the freedom to visit markets at their will. The Chinese traveller Yuan Chwang who visited in the 7th century wrote, \\"The inhabitants are proud, spirited, war like, grateful for favours, vengeful in wars, self sacrificing towards supplicants in distress, sanguinary to death with anyone who treated them insultingly. There war elephants go to battle intoxicated and people are fond of learning\\".Karmarkar (1947) , p109 The practice of erecting hero stones (virkal) for fallen heroes was common and sometimes families received monetary aid for maintenance of these memorials. The presence of numerous Mahasatikals (or Mastikal - hero stones for a woman who accepted ritual death upon the demise of her husband) attests to its popularity among royalty.From the writings of Marco Polo, Ibn Batuta, Bernier and Tavernier (Karmarkar 1947, p110) Ritual death by sallekhana, by Jalasamadhi (drowning in water) are also known.Karmarkar (1947), p110 Popular among men was the use of two unrestricted garments, a Dhoti as a lower garment and a plain cloth as upper garment while women wore Saris with stitched petticoats. Turbans were popular with men of higher standing and people used umbrellas made with bamboo or reeds.Karmarkar (1947), p111 Ornamentation was common among men and women, even elephants and horses were decorated. Men wore finger rings, necklaces (honnasara and honnagala sara), bracelets (Kaduga) and wristlets (Kaftkina). Women wore a nose jewel (bottu), nose ring (mugutti), bangles (bale or kankana) and various types of necklaces (honna gante sara and kati sutra). During leisure, men amused themselves with horse riding, watching wrestling bouts, cock fights, ram fights and duel between animals of different species.Karmarkar (1947), p112 Though the southern Deccan lacked the large universities of the north such as Nalanda or Taxila, they made up with a large and well organised network of smaller schools called by various names; agraharas, ghatikas, brahmapura or matha where higher education was imparted.Karmarkar (1947), p113 Inscriptions mention schools of higher education at Salotgi, Balligavi, Kuppattur, Talagunda, Perur, Nargund, Sarvajnapura, Begur, Sayyadi, Aihole, Nirgund, Degamve, Arasikere, Neralige etc. ==Notes== ==References== * * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:Historical Societies of Karnataka Category:Western Ganga dynasty ","title":"Western Ganga society"},{"id":"11655584","text":"thumb Alexey (Alex) Sergeyevich Selezniev (, alternative transliterations: Selesniev, Selesniew, Selesnev, Selesnieff; pronounced \\"selezNYOFF\\"; 1888June 1967) was a Russian chess master and chess composer. Selezniev was born in Tambov, Russia, into a wealthy merchant Russian family, and was a graduate from Moscow University's law faculty. He played in a number of pre- revolutionary tournaments at the Moscow Chess Club. He tied for 8-10th at Vilna 1912 (7th RUS-ch, B tourn, Karel Hromadka won).

In September 1914, four of them (Alekhine, Bogatyrchuk, Saburov, and Koppelman) were freed and allowed to return home through Switzerland. The Russian internees played eight tournaments, the first in Baden-Baden (1914) and all the others in Triberg im Schwarzwald (1914‚Äì1917).

Both players were interned in Germany for the duration of World War I, and decided to stay there until 1924. That year, both players were sent invitations to participate in the third USSR Championship, and somehow Nikolai Krylenko convinced them to play and stay in the Soviet Union. Selezniev participated in the third, fourth, fifth and sixth USSR Championships (1924, 1925, 1927, and 1929), but had only mediocre results each time. He tied for 6-8th at Moscow 1924 (Bogoljubov won), took 14th at Leningrad 1925 (Bogoljubov won), tied for 15-17th at Moscow 1927 (Fedor Bogatyrchuk and Peter Romanovsky won).

The success of worm charming can often depend on these soil conditions, with charmers choosing damp locations or using water to attract the worms. ==As a profession== Worms are sold as a live bait for fishermen, and many sellers use worm charming techniques to gather their stock. In some locations professional worm grunters need to obtain a permit in order to ply their trade. ==Competitive worm charming== In most competitions the fiddlers with the collector (or collectors) of the most worms in a set time are declared as the winners. They usually have a zone in which to perform their charming, measuring three yards square. Competitive worm charming at Willaston One of the first worm charming events took place in a school f√™te at Willaston County Primary School in Willaston, Cheshire. The World Worm Charming Championships started in 1980 and is now an annual event that celebrates the sport.

It was created by merging the design teams of Frank Whittle's Power Jets and the RAE turbine development team run by Hayne Constant. NGTE spent most of its lifetime as a testing and development centre, both for experimental developments and to support commercial engine companies. The newly merged venture was nationalised. Pyestock, a former golf course in a secluded wooded spot between Farnborough and Fleet was chosen as the turbine development site, as the activities at the NGTE would be top secret and the surrounding woodland would dampen the noise. Construction began in 1949 with small test \\"cubicles\\" inside buildings like the Plant House. When the possibility of supersonic jets arose, the site was expanded to the north west, with the Air House and several large test cells built circa 1961. For over 50 years Pyestock was at the forefront of gas turbine development. It was probably the largest site of its kind in the world. V bomber, Harrier and Tornado engines were tested on site. The power of the air house allowed Concorde's engines to be tested at 2,000 mph. Every gas turbine installed in Royal Navy ships was checked here; captured Soviet engines were discreetly examined. NGTE Pyestock closed down in 2000 and was decommissioned to make way for a business park. ==History== In 1942 the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) Turbine Division moved to new facilities in Pyestock. In 1944 Power Jets Ltd. (set up by Frank Whittle and two colleagues in 1936) merged with the RAE Turbine Division and was nationalised to form Power Jets (Research and Development) Ltd. In 1946 it was reconstituted as a division of the Ministry of Supply to form the National Gas Turbine Establishment. The Admiralty Marine Engineering Establishment (formerly the Admiralty Fuel Experimental Station which developed the Admiralty three-drum boiler) was taken over by the NGTE in 1965. Following the 1971 creation of the Ministry of Defence Procurement Executive, both the Admiralty Engineering Laboratory (1917-1977) and the Admiralty Oil Laboratory (1953-1977) were amalgamated with the NGTE. In 1995 the establishment became part of DERA. The establishment closed in 2000. ==The Buildings== === Air House === The Air House (1961) was a modernistic structure. Its eastern side is sheet glass; 8 large blue exhaust pipes rise the full length of the building, for the 8 compressor/exhauster sets inside. The pipes transported the fast moving air to/from the test cells. The Air House had two functions: blowing or sucking air, at up to 2,000 mph (for Cell 4). There were eight identical GEC compressor/exhauster sets which aggregated to 352,000 horsepower, then the largest installation of its kind in the western world. This is the final design for the compressor/exhauster sets from the late 1950s. They are made up of an in-line arrangement (from left to right) of an 8,000 horsepower steam turbine, then two low-pressure compressors, a high-pressure exhauster, a 27 MW 11 kV synchronous motor that provided 36,000 horsepower, and finally the barring gear and the exciter (a small generator that provides a current needed to start the main motor). The 8,000 horsepower steam turbine, which was powered by the site's boiler house, gave the compressor sets a kick start before it was synced with the grid. They could also be used whilst they were being run but this was expensive and only used on the supersonic tests. === Cell 3 === Cell 3 was mostly underground and was a supersonic replacement of Cell 2, allowing for higher speeds and a greater engine temperature range. There was a fairly large building above ground. But that was just to allow engines to be lowered into the test chamber from a huge crane. The test chamber itself was almost entirely underground. === Cell 3 West === Cell 3 West was a comparatively small building, with a large blue and white round opening on the front of the test chamber. It was the last altitude test cell built on site. It was one of the largest cells internally, allowing icing tests (testing to see how ice affects a turbine's performance) to be carried out on engines and helicopter rotors. The engine or turbine was suspended from the roof of the cell. === Cell 4 === The largest test cell on site, Cell 4 was built in 1965, at a cost of ¬£6.5 million, as part of the Concorde programme but also to test other supersonic jet engines. The test cell, unique in the world, takes up most of the steel clad structure with its mass of pipes, blast doors and electronics. It is connected to the Air House by blue pipes and was designed to simulate Concorde's flying conditions - Mach 2 (1522 mph) at 61,000 feet, but could test Concorde's engines at a maximum wind speed of 2,000 mph. The amount of energy required to run the air house (see below) at the speed needed was too great for the site's own power station, so electricity had to be taken from the National Grid. By the early 1970s, Pyestock had to negotiate with the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) to have enough electricity generated. So as not to strain the grid, Cell 4 could only be powered up at night. === Number 9 Exhauster === Pyestock's designers built the Air House on a large scale, thinking it could supply adequate suction for the supersonic test cells. But they could not have anticipated the phenomenal force required by Cell 4 - even with all eight exhausters running the suction was insufficient. The solution was to build another exhauster set directly next to Cell 4. As there are eight in the Air House, this one was named number 9. It is a Parsons \\"multi-stage axial-flow exhauster\\". It was used mainly by Cell 4 but also occasionally by Cell 3 and Cell 3 West. It was driven by a 36,000 horsepower synchronous motor, with power being taken first from the site's power station, and then when 3,000 rpm was reached it was synchronised with the National Grid. ==Filmography== Pyestock was used for several scenes in the 2005 film Sahara by Breck Eisner, based on the best-selling book of the same name by Clive Cussler. Internal sections of Cell 3 and Cell 4 were suitably reworked for the film's supposedly solar powered waste disposal facility. ==See also== * List of wind tunnels ==References== == External links == * Pyestock, the National Gas Turbine Establishment * Information and photos from an ex employee * Exploring NGTE Pyestock * Booklet documenting the Pyestock services from ~1982 * Site in 2011 * \\"Gas Turbine Development\\" an excerpt from a Hayne Constant lecture in a 1957 issue of Flight - Part 1 * \\"Gas Turbine Development\\" an excerpt from a Hayne Constant lecture in a 1957 issue of Flight - Part 2 * \\"Open Days at the NGTE\\" a 1966 Flight article Category:History of science and technology in the United Kingdom Category:Military research establishments of the United Kingdom Category:Military history of Hampshire Category:Fleet, Hart ","title":"National Gas Turbine Establishment"},{"id":"11655808","text":"Gastrodontoidea is a taxonomic superfamily of air-breathing land snails, terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusks in the limacoid clade. == Taxonomy== According to the taxonomy of the Gastropoda (Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005), families in this superfamily include: * Gastrodontidae * Chronidae * Euconulidae * Oxychilidae * Pristilomatidae * Trochomorphidae * Fossil taxa probably belonging to the Gastrodontoidea are: ** Subfamily ‚Ä† Archaeozonitinae Pfeffer, 1930Pfeffer G.

Three billion people in developing countries across the globe rely on biomass, in the form of wood, charcoal, dung, and crop residue, as their domestic cooking fuel. Since much of the cooking is carried out indoors in environments that lack proper ventilation, millions of people, primarily poor women and children face serious health risks. The major sources of indoor air pollution include combustion and building materials. Globally, 4.3 million deaths were attributed to exposure to IAP in developing countries in 2012, almost all in low and middle-income countries. The South East Asian and Western Pacific regions bear most of the burden with 1.69 and 1.62 million deaths, respectively. Almost 600,000 deaths occur in Africa, 200,000 in the Eastern Mediterranean region, 99,000 in Europe and 81,000 in the Americas. The remaining 19,000 deaths occur in high-income countries. Even though the rate of dependence on biomass fuel is declining, this dwindling resource will not keep up with population growth which could ultimately put environments at even greater risk. Over the past several decades, there have been numerous studies investigating the air pollution generated by traditional household solid fuel combustion for space heating, lighting, and cooking in developing countries. It is now well established that, throughout much of the developing world, indoor burning of solid fuels (biomass, coal, etc.) by inefficient, often insufficiently vented, combustion devices results in elevated exposure to household air pollutants. This is due to the poor combustion efficiency of the combustion devices and the elevated nature of the emissions. In addition, they are often released directly into living areas., Long, C., Valberg, P., 2014. Evolution of Cleaner Solid Fuel Combustion, Cornerstone, http://cornerstonemag.net/evolution-of-cleaner-solid-fuel-combustion/ Smoke from traditional household solid fuel combustion commonly contains a range of incomplete combustion products, including both fine and coarse particulate matter (e.g., PM2.5, PM10), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and a variety of organic air pollutants (e.g., formaldehyde, 1,3-butadiene, benzene, acetaldehyde, acrolein, phenols, pyrene, benzopyrene, benzo(a)pyrene, dibenzopyrenes, dibenzocarbazoles, and cresols). In a typical solid fuel stove, about 6‚Äì20% of the solid fuel is converted into toxic emissions (by mass). The exact quantity and relative composition is determined by factors such as the fuel type and moisture content, stove type and operation influencing the amount. While many pollutants can evolve, most measurements have been focused on breathing-zone exposure levels of particulate matter (PM) and carbon monoxide (CO), which are the main products of incomplete combustion and are considered to pose the greatest health risks. Indoor PM2.5 exposure levels have been consistently reported to be in the range of hundreds to thousands of micrograms per cubic meter (Œºg/m3). Similarly, CO exposure levels have been measured to be as high as hundreds to greater than 1000 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m3). A recent study of 163 households in two rural Chinese counties reported geometric mean indoor PM2.5 concentrations of 276 Œºg/m3 (combinations of different plant materials, including wood, tobacco stems, and corncobs), 327 Œºg/m3 (wood), 144 Œºg/m3 (smoky coal), and 96 Œºg/m3 (smokeless coal) for homes using a variety of different fuel types and stove configurations (e.g., vented, unvented, portable, fire pit, mixed ventilation stove). ==Implications== ===Health implications=== Rural Kenya has been the site of various applied research projects to determine the intensity of emissions that commonly occur from use of biomass fuels, particularly wood, dung, and crop residue. Smoke is the result of the incomplete combustion of solid fuel which women and children are exposed to up to seven hours each day in closed environments.Smoke's increasing cloud across the globe, Practical Action, accessed 5 May 2007. These emissions vary from day to day, season to season and with changes in the amount of airflow within the residence. Exposure in poor homes far exceeds accepted safety levels by as much as one hundred times over. Because many Kenyan women utilize a three-stone fire, the worst offender, one kilogram of burning wood produces tiny particles of soot which can clog and irritate the bronchial pathways. The smoke also contains various poisonous gases such as aldehydes, benzene, and carbon monoxide. Exposure to IAP from the combustion of solid fuels has been implicated, with varying degrees of evidence, as a causal agent of several diseases. Acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are the leading causes of disease and death from exposure to smoke. Cataracts and blindness, lung cancer, tuberculosis, premature births and low birth weight are also suspected of being caused by IAP. ===Women and gender=== Women and girls are largely responsible for collecting fuel-wood for cooking in most households, particularly in rural communities and in refugee camps. This increases their vulnerability to incidences of violence, including beating and bodily injury, assault, and rape. This time could be spent in more productive ways such as attending school or income production ‚Äì improved cookstove interventions in refugee camps have shown significant decreases in fuelwood collection times reported by women. Moreover, removing the need for women to collect fuelwood also significantly reduces reported rapes during firewood collection. The use of biomass coupled with inefficient cooking apparatus leads to a web of social and environmental concerns which directly links to the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. Women and girls also make up the majority of deaths from household air pollution (HAP), which has been shown to affect nearly three billion people worldwide. Replacing traditional kerosene/firewood stoves with cleaner ethanol stoves in Nigeria has been shown to mitigate adverse pregnancy outcomes from HAP. ==Interventions== Solar cookers use sunlight as energy source for outdoor cooking. ===Early interventions=== Unfortunately, finding an affordable solution to address the many effects of IAP ‚Äì improving combustion, reducing smoke exposure, improving safety and reducing labor, reducing fuel costs, and addressing sustainability ‚Äì is complex and in need of continual improvement. Efforts to improve cook stoves in the past, beginning in the 1950s, were primarily aimed at minimizing deforestation with no concern for IAP, though the effectiveness of these efforts to save firewood is debatable. Various attempts had various outcomes. For example, some improved stove designs in Kenya significantly reduced particulate emissions but produced higher CO2 and SO2 emissions. Flues to remove smoke were difficult to design and were fragile. ===Improved success=== Current improved interventions however, include smoke hoods which operate in much the same manner as flues, to extract smoke, but are found to reduce levels of IAP more effectively than homes that relied solely on windows for ventilation. Health, Environment And The Burden Of Disease: A Guidance Note , Cairncross, S., O'neill, D., McCoy., A., Sethi, D. 2003. DFID. Accessed 10 May 2007. Some features of newly improved stoves include a chimney, enclosing the fire to retain heat, designing a pot holder to maximize heat transfer, dampers to control air flow, a ceramic insert to reduce heat loss, and multi-pot systems to allow for cooking multiple dishes. Stoves are now known to be one of the least-cost means to achieve the combined objective of reducing the health burden of IAP and in some areas reducing environmental stress from biomass harvesting.Healthy Stoves and Fuels for Developing Nations and the Global Environment, Kammen, D. 2003. Accessed 12 May 2007. Some success in installation of interventions, including improved cook stoves, has been achieved primarily due to an interdisciplinary approach which includes multiple stakeholders. These projects have discovered that key socio-economic issues must be addressed to ensure the success of intervention programs. A multitude of complex issues indicate improved stoves are not merely a tool to save fuel. ===Successful interventions=== The following information represents one successful intervention known as the Kenya Smoke and Health Project (1998‚Äì2001)Kenya Smoke and Health Project, ITDG. 1998-2001. Accessed 5 May 2007. which involved fifty rural households in two separate regions, Kajiado and West Kenya. These areas were chosen due to different climate, geographic, and cultural implications. Community participation was the primary focus for this project and as a result, those involved indicated the results far exceeded their expectations. Local women's groups and, in the case of the project in West Kenya, men were actively involved. By involving the end-users the project resulted in more widespread acceptance and created the further benefit of providing local income. Three key interventions were discussed and disseminated; ventilation by enlarging windows or opening eaves spaces, adding smoke hoods over the cooking area, or the option of installing an improved cook stove such as the Upesi stove. Smoke hoods are free-standing units that act like flues or chimneys in their effort to draw smoke out of the dwelling. They can be used over traditional open fires and this study showed they contribute to considerably lower levels of IAP. The smoke hood models were made with hard manila paper and then transferred to heavy-gauge galvanized sheet metal and manufactured locally. This resulted in further employment opportunities for the artisans who were trained by the project. The Upesi stove, made of clay and kiln-fired, was developed by Practical Action and East African partners to utilize wood and agricultural wastes. Because this stove was designed and adapted for local needs it produced several winning features. Not only does it cut the use of fuel-wood by approximately half, and reduce exposure to household smoke, it also empowers local women by creating employment as they are the ones who make and market the stoves. These women's groups gain access to technical training in production and marketing and enjoy higher wage earnings and improved social status as a result of the introduction of this improved stove. Various benefits were realized including improved health; the most important aspect to each of the villagers involved. The people reported less internal heat allowing for better sleep, fewer headaches and less fatigue, less eye irritation and coughs and dizziness. Safety increased due to the smoke hoods preventing goats and children from falling into the fire and less soot contamination was observed, along with snakes and rodents not entering the home. Windows allowed for the ability to view cattle from indoors, and also reduced kerosene needs due to improved interior lighting. Overall, the indoor environment improved greatly from various simple things that are taken for granted in modern western homes. Greater indoor light also allows for more income generation for women as they can do beadwork by the window when weather doesn't allow for this work outdoors. Children also benefit from increased lighting for homework. Interpersonal relationships developed among the women due to the project, and men better supported their wives initiative when the end result benefited them as well. While initial efforts to improve stoves were limited in success, current efforts are more successful due to the recognition that sustainable domestic energy resources are \\"central to reducing poverty and hunger, improving health‚Ä¶and improving the lives of women and children\\" The optimal short-term goal in minimizing rural poverty is to provide inexpensive and acceptable solutions to the local people. Not only can stoves contribute to this intervention, but the use of cleaner fuels will also provide further benefits. Similar improved-stove projects have proven successful in other regions of the world. Improved stoves installed as part of the Randomized Exposure Study of Pollution Indoors and Respiratory Effects (RESPIRE) study in Guatemala were found to be acceptable to the population and produce significant health benefits for both mothers and children.Department of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley. Randomized exposure study of pollution indoors and respiratory effects (RESPIRE). http://ehs.sph.berkeley.edu/guat/page.asp?id=15 . Accessed 18 March 2008. Mothers in the intervention group had lower blood pressure and reductions in eye discomfort and back pain. Intervention households were also found to have lower levels of small particles and carbon monoxide. Children in these households also had lower rates of asthma. This initial pilot program has evolved into CRECER (Chronic Respiratory Effects of Early Childhood Exposure to Respirable Particulate Matter), which will attempt to follow children in intervention households for a longer period of time to determine whether the improved stoves also contribute to greater health over the lifespan.Department of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley. Chronic respiratory effects of childhood exposure to respirable particulate matter (CRECER). http://ehs.sph.berkeley.edu/guat/page.asp?id=1 . Accessed 18 March 2008. The National Program on Improved Chulhas in India has also had some success in encouraging the use of improved stoves among at-risk populations. Begun in the mid-1980s, this program provides subsidies to encourage families to purchase the longer-lasting chulhas and have a chimney installed. A 2005 study showed that stoves with chimneys are associated with a lower incidence of cataracts in women. Much of the available information from India is more of a characterization of the issue and there is less data available from intervention trials. China has been particularly successful at encouraging the use of improved stoves, with hundreds of millions of stoves installed since the beginning of the project in the early 1980s. The government very intentionally targeted poorer, rural households, and by the late 1990s nearly 75% of such households contained \\"improved kitchens.\\"Smith, KR. Household monitoring project in China. Environmental Health Sciences Department website. http://ehs.sph.berkeley.edu/hem/page.asp?id=29 . Accessed 18 March 2008. A 2007 review of 3500 households showed an improvement in indoor air quality in intervention households characterized by lower concentrations of small particles and carbon monoxide in household air. The program in China involved intervention on a large scale, but the cost of stoves was heavily subsidized so it is not known if its success could be replicated. ==Environmental impacts== Mortality and burden of disease are not the only detrimental effects of utilizing inefficient energy technology such as the combustion of biomass. Kenya's pre-dominant energy source is biomass, providing more than 90 per cent of rural household energy needs, about one-third in the form of charcoal and the rest from firewood.Global Village Energy Partnership, Nairobi, Kenya , UNDP. 2005. Accessed 30 April 2007. Biomass energy sourced primarily from savannah woodlands includes firewood for inhabitants and charcoal for urban use. A small percentage is sourced by neighboring communities from closed and protected forests which are generally found in high population density areas. While biomass harvesting in sensitive areas is problematic, it is now determined that the great majority of biomass clearing is due to agricultural expansion and land conversion. Approximately 38% of households 'in high agro- ecological zones' utilize agricultural waste due to frequent shortages of conventional fuel-wood. Use of crop residue and animal waste for domestic energy has detrimental results on soil quality and agricultural and livestock productivity. These materials are ultimately not available as soil conditioners, organic fertilizer, and livestock fodder, not to mention the \\"cumulative effects on national food security\\". Most farmers are aware however, that when agricultural waste and dung are not used for energy, they are important elements to maintaining soil fertility. One of the most efficient ways to utilize crop waste and dung for domestic energy is to produce briquettes. The process of compacting the material into a donut shape creates more efficient combustion which contributes to reduced emission levels. A simple device allows for this process and it can be done locally. ===Sustainable options=== Large-scale combustion of biomass is only feasible if carried out in a sustainable manner. The concern is paramount for regeneration of renewable and sustainable fuel-wood sources if it is to continue to be available long-term. Attempts at sustainable solutions in Kenya could include developing energy crops (trees and shrubs) which would also provide additional income for farmers. This solution would benefit cropland or rangeland prone to erosion and flooding as the root systems and leaf litter would enhance soil stability. Careful selection of regenerating varieties would be most sustainable because soil stability is not disrupted due to tilling and planting. Some people view this solution as a way to further exploit forests, but with proper management of forest resources this could be a viable solution. Fuels and cook stove technology can be assessed on two factors: energy efficiency and emissions in the household. High-performing efficient stoves can improve environmental outcomes to an extent even with unclean fuels (such as firewood and biomass). According to a study comparing environmental, social, and economic life cycle impacts of cooking fuels, with more efficient stoves ‚Äúmore of the heating value of the fuel is converted into useful cooking energy and therefore less fuel must be produced, transported, and burned to deliver the same amount of cooking.‚Äù Other sustainable options include liquid and gas fuels that are combusted in high-performing efficient stoves. For instance, ethanol produced from cellulosic/non-food feedstocks (wood, agricultural residue) has lower environmental life cycle impacts compared to ethanol produced from sugar and starch materials. LPG, though made from non-renewable fossil fuels, still has lower negative environmental impacts than traditional fuels ‚Äì thus even though it is not a sustainable alternative, it creates far less emissions impacts than traditional fuels. ==Challenges== ===Supply=== There exist trade-offs between efficiency and sustainability on the supply side of the cook stoves and fuels market. While developing cook stoves that use efficient and clean fuel sources is environmentally ideal, often this is not a viable solution due to barriers to scaling up production and consumption of these fuels. For instance, electric stoves are cited as emission-free ‚Äòclean‚Äô alternatives to biomass at the household level. However, negative externalities still exist - ambient air pollution in areas near power plants still poses a health risk, while the generation of electricity in India and China (countries largely dependent on coal for electricity generation) still poses significant environmental risks. Moreover, only households that are connected to the electric grid in a country or region will have access to electricity for household energy consumption, thereby excluding a large swathe of rural communities. ===Demand=== On the demand side, challenges exist in terms of creating an enabling environment for cook stove acquisition. Incorporating culturally sensitive behavior change techniques (BCTs) into demand interventions is necessary to foster large-scale behavior change, as discussed below. The other prohibitive aspect of cook stove interventions that do not involve paternalistic good provision is the high up-front costs of improved stoves. Consumers at the bottom of the income pyramid are often the target end-users of these improved technologies, but due to a lack of collateral or isolation, they do not have access to traditional forms of consumer finance and credit. Innovations in business models and the increased proliferation of microfinance institutions (MFIs) are addressing these issues ‚Äì however, MFIs face challenges of scaling up. ===Government intervention=== Given the negative externalities associated with unclean cook stove technology ‚Äì the negative impact on women and girls; lack of environmental sustainability; and increased risk of diseases associated with HAP ‚Äì there is a strong case for government intervention. For instance, one form of intervention could be direct subsidies linked to health and climate impacts ‚Äì for example, targeted subsidies carbon markets. The provision of public goods such as consumer education, access to consumer finance would also be beneficial interventions. Subsidies towards investment in R&D; for cleaner technologies and fuels, as well as for the implementation of a baseline standards and testing framework for cleanliness and efficiency (also provision of a public good), is necessary to create an effective and sustainable supply chain. Positive consumption externalities from improved cook stove use, justifying external intervention ==Developments== There have been significant developments in energy efficient cooking solutions, such as the Wonderbag, which can also significantly reduce fuel requirements for residential cooking. Improvements in technology have allowed for the use of more sustainable cooking solutions with traditional fuels, such as the BioLite Home Stove, a biomass stove which reduces fuel consumption by 50% and emissions by up to 95%. Innovations in business models have also allowed for cook stove suppliers to ‚Äúdramatically improve both manufacturer and end-user economics, while achieving high levels of health and environmental benefits.‚Äù For instance, Inyeneri is a for-profit energy company in Rwanda that operates as more as a ‚Äòcooking fuel utility company‚Äô. Its model successfully addresses a number of problems with stove adoption including prohibitively high upfront stove costs, consumer tendency to combine new and old cooking solutions, and lack of commercial viability of these enterprises. Additionally, innovations in mobile technology have allowed companies like PayGo Energy in Kenya and KopaGas in Tanzania to overcome the cost barrier that low-income consumers face, including the high up-front cost of stoves and the inaccessibility of purchasing fuels in small quantities (a form of the poverty penalty). MFIs have also begun to turn their attention to clean energy access, as seen with the success of the USAID-funded Renewable Energy Microfinance and Microenterprise Program (REMMP). ==Education interventions and behaviour change techniques== Educational intervention can contribute to reducing exposure to smoke by implementing behaviour change techniques that people to the dangers and encourage a willingness to alter living and cultural practices which could have a significant impact on mitigating exposure to IAP. Behaviour change is one aspect of influencing demand that can be achieved through targeted social marketing campaigns, which are usually of two types: either mass-market campaigns or focused approaches at the local and household level that employ demonstrations and follow up visits. Studies show that mass marketing campaigns do in fact increase awareness of risks of household air pollution, but are often unsuccessful in raising purchases of improved stoves. Design of these interventions must be undertaken with the knowledge that ‚Äúconsumer needs and preferences are complex and are influenced by many contextual and social factors that require a deep understanding of culture, going beyond technology and economics.‚Äù These factors include intra-gender issues, felt needs, cultural significance of food, and religious and cultural beliefs. Evidence of one successful government intervention was revealed by China who, between 1980 and 1995, disseminated 172 million improved cookstoves. This effort proved more successful due to the inclusion of local users, particularly women, who were involved in the design and fieldwork process. ==Primary intervention for children== Children up to five years of age spend 90% of their time at home. Globally, 50% of pneumonia deaths among children under five years of age are due to particulate matter inhaled from indoor air pollution. Many homes around the world used solid fuels for cooking. These fuels release large amounts of carbon monoxide and fine particulate matter. These chemical irritants when inhaled may cause different pulmonary conditions ranging from pulmonary epithelial cancer or acute pulmonary tract infection. ==Kenya and modern energy== As of 2004, Kenya has shown a willingness to undertake biomass energy issues with the understanding that consumption is associated with indoor air pollution and environmental degradation. Suggestions from the United Nations Development Programme include establishing an institution that will deal exclusively with biomass energy by developing policy guidelines on sustainable firewood, charcoal, and modern biomass such as cleaner fuels and wind, solar, and small scale hydropower. Short-term solutions rest in more efficient domestic energy use by way of improved cook stoves which provide more affordable options in the near future than a complete shift to nonsolid fuels. Long-term solutions rest on transition to modern cleaner fuels and alternative energy sources within a broad international and national policy and economic agenda. Government support for long-term solutions is feasible as witnessed by current efforts in Zambia to develop policy to promote biofuels. Kenya is the world leader in the number of solar power systems installed per capita (but not the number of watts added). More than 30,000 small solar panels, each producing 12 to 30 watts, are sold in Kenya annually. For an investment of as little as $100 for the panel and wiring, the PV system can be used to charge a car battery, which can then provide power to run a fluorescent lamp or a small television for a few hours a day. More Kenyans adopt solar power every year than make connections to the country's electric grid.The Rise of Renewable Energy ==Further action== National and international effort must be stepped up to advance short and long term solutions for the millions of women and children who suffer from poverty and disease as a result of indoor air pollution. Scientists predict the African continent will be the first to experience the effects of global warming where widespread poverty will put millions at further risk due to their limited capabilities to adapt. The potential is great for a more sustainable Africa with commitment from within and outside the region. Pneumonia is the number one killer of children in the world and indoor air pollution is a strongly significant risk factor for severe pneumonia. The global health community designated 2 November to be World Pneumonia Day in order to raise awareness about the disease and its causes. ==See also== * Envirofit * Guatemala Stove Project * Rocket stove * International Association of Certified Indoor Air Consultants (IAC2) * Rural electrification * Sick building syndrome * Renewable energy in China ==References== ==External links== * World Health Organization Page on Indoor Air Pollution * Washington Post Article on Indoor Air Pollution in Asia * IPS story on the Cost of IAP to Women's Health * Practical Action * 2 November is World Pneumonia Day Category:Building biology Category:International development Category:Air pollution ","title":"Indoor air pollution in developing nations"},{"id":"11655856","text":"WKYO (1360 AM) is a radio station licensed to Caro, Michigan broadcasting a full-service classic country format.

A super senior is a student in an American four-year educational institution such as a high school or university who has been attending the institution for more than 4 years or has over the usual number of credits required to graduate without achieving a diploma or bachelor's degree. ==Causes== Applied to education in the United States, super-seniors usually have the minimum number of credits to graduate but do not for various reasons. These students will advance through the grades (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior) on schedule and are classified as a \\"senior\\" for two or more years. ===Redshirt student- athlete=== A student-athlete may have been made a redshirt their freshman year, which delays their four-year eligibility for competition in the NCAA until their sophomore year. As a result, they will still be eligible the year after their senior year and may stay in college to continue competition. ===Multiple degrees=== Students who intend to complete two or more degrees at the same time are often required to earn approximately 140-150 credits to receive their degrees, rather than the normal 120. It is often in the student's best interest to earn all desired/required undergraduate degrees at the same time as financial aid is more readily available to undergraduates than to graduates returning for additional undergraduate degrees. They could also use summer school sessions as well. ===Change of majors=== Students may choose to change majors after they are well advanced in their schooling. These students often have enough general education credits and overall credits to graduate but do not have their major-specific credits completed. ===Leave of absence=== Students may take a leave of absence from their university for the difficult circumstances described below, or to pursue other endeavors, such as living, working, or studying abroad, tending to a fledgling business, or pursuing opportunities in their chosen career. Stanford University in particular is known for its sizable constituency of fifth-year (and sometimes even sixth-year) seniors who took time off to volunteer or work overseas. Many of Stanford's more famous alumni have taken a leave of absence and never returned to the school. Another school well known in this regard is Brigham Young University, the flagship school of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints. Many male BYU students, both at the main campus in Utah and at its branch campuses in Hawaii and Idaho, take two years off during their studies to go on LDS missions. Before a 2012 change in church policy, female students were much less likely to take time off to serve missions (which, for women, last 18 months). Under the old policy, men were allowed to serve at age 19, while women had to wait until 21 (by which time many would be close to finishing degrees, married, or both). With the new policy, males can go on missions immediately after high school as long as they are at least 18, while females can serve once they turn 19. ===Poor choice of classes=== Super- seniors often include students who chose their classes without considering graduation requirements. They are often missing important requirements for their major or core/general education. Additionally, in changing of majors this creates an important concept in core classes as well as other classes in the curriculum. ===Music majors=== For music majors, participation in music ensembles is an obvious requirement over the course of their college career. At many colleges, large ensembles (full choir, concert/marching/jazz band, and/or symphony orchestra) rehearse four hours a week for only one credit (typically, the number of credits correspond to hours spent in class per week). This is to encourage non-music majors to be in the ensembles; however, it is not unusual for music majors to carry 8 classes in a semester for a normal credit load of 15-16 credits. Due to this more intense time commitment, music majors often have to take 2 or more semesters to complete their graduation requirements. ===Low grades=== In many schools, the grade of \\"D\\" is enough to receive credit for a class, but not high enough to count towards the student's major or core/general education requirements. A student who receives too many D grades may have enough credits to graduate, but not good enough grades. Occasionally a student may keep his or her grade point average high enough to remain in school, but still fail enough classes that they do not have enough credits to graduate at the end of his or her four years. ===Desire to remain in school=== Some super-seniors have enough credits and requirements to graduate, but do not apply for graduation. In most cases, universities do not automatically grant graduation without application, and as long as tuition is paid, students are not forced to leave the school. This is normally not applicable to high school. Some super-seniors may be in their fifth or later year in the school but do not have enough credits to graduate. These students appear on paper as juniors or (simple) seniors and do not have enough credits to graduate with their peers. Some super-seniors take a leave of absence or extra majors on purpose to remain in school for as long as possible. Another example of a student‚Äôs desire to remain in school is if the student is an accounting major intending to sit for the Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination. Most states in the U.S. require CPA candidates to obtain at least 150 semester hours of college education. One way for a student to obtain the 150 semester hours required for the CPA Exam is to take additional accounting or business courses in the student‚Äôs fifth or subsequent years without having to enroll in a postgraduate program. ===Difficult or multiple majors=== Students in high-stress majors such as mathematics or those who take a difficult double-major (within the same degree) or minor may choose to take a minimum number of classes (two, three, or four depending on the number of credits offered per class) at one time in order to achieve higher grades or superior retention. ===Difficult circumstances=== Occasionally a student becomes ill or is injured in mid-semester and cannot complete/pass the classes he/she has begun. If this occurs after the drop-deadline, the school may make a judgment as to whether to count the grades against him/her or drop the student from the semester. In either case, the student would need an additional semester to graduate. Students may have other difficulties that prevent them from completing the graduation requirements in the traditional four years, such as raising a child or being required to work full-time. Such students may only attend classes on a part-time basis, taking over a decade to complete a bachelor's degree. ===College-required classes=== Many times, universities will require classes in order to graduate that fall under the \\"General Education Requirements\\" category. Often, universities will offer some of these classes (especially at smaller universities where number of teachers or resources are more limited) only once every few semesters. In some cases, students find it impossible (due to other courses, employment, or other reasons) to take these courses when they are offered and sometimes need to stay enrolled in the university for an extra semester or year until these classes are offered again. ===Tuition-free fifth year for personal interest studies=== At the University of Rochester, students are given the unique opportunity to partake in the Take Five Scholars Program. In this program, the student receives a fifth year, or one additional semester, tuition free while the student studies a subject outside of their major. The student has to apply for this program before their eighth semester. Agnes Scott College also offers a Fifth Year program, tuition-free. It is typically used to take courses that interest them but they could not take during their first four years, to finish a second major, or to take classes that are prerequisites for a graduate program they wish to pursue. ===Cooperative education=== Many colleges and universities offer a Cooperative Education program. In this program, a student has the opportunity to integrate work experience into his/her education through full-time employment during one or more semesters. Generally, a student will not enroll in any courses during the semester(s) of his/her full- time employment. Therefore, a student participating in Cooperative Education will require more than four years to complete his/her studies. ===Wait- listed=== Students are wait-listed when applying for college entrance or when enrolling in classes at their college or university. A spot on a wait-list delays students that are earning credits for core/general education or toward their major. Being wait-listed at the beginning of their college career or at any point during their time at a college or university prevents them from having enough credits to graduate in the traditional four years. ===Transfer students=== Transfer students may have to spend a longer time getting their degrees since different universities have different requirements. Also, students may transfer to narrow down their major to a specific one; an engineering student at one school may want to transfer to another one to major in a specific type of engineering, for example. ===Night Student=== Classes that night students need to graduate are not always available when the students are free. Work constraints, family, or other issues may create a situation where night students can only take a one to two classes per semester. This can lead to a senior having taken classes to remain as a student before the requisite courses are available. ==Effects== ===College or university=== Some universities reduce or withdraw state funding after a student's fifth year. In addition, parents who are paying for their children's education and living expenses may lose patience and cut their student's funding. Fifth year students are becoming more common as students increasingly choose to progress through difficult courses of study slow paces or pursue multiple majors or degrees. Although states often reduce or withdraw funding, there is still funding available to the students in the form of scholarships, as well as federal money such as work study and student loans. ===High school=== Public high schools may allow a fifth year super-senior who does not have enough credits to graduate to continue attending their regular school, though students older than age 19 are usually required to attend \\"continuation school\\" meant for adults who have not graduated with a high school degree. Students forced into continuation school often choose to drop-out or take the GED. ==Special education== In the United States, federal law (IDEA) states that public (state) schools are required to keep special-needs students in regular public schools (or a special education school if the student's IEP warrants it) until they graduate from that school or reach the age of 21. ==See also== *Grade retention ==References== Category:Students in the United States ","title":"Super senior"},{"id":"11655958","text":"{| |} Bakeng Duce front view Bakeng Duce rear view The Bakeng Deuce (formerly the Duce) is a parasol-wing monoplane designed in the United States in the early 1970s and marketed for homebuilding.

Pushpagiri was mentioned in the writings of the Chinese traveller Xuanzang () and some other ancient sources. Until the 1990s, it was hypothesised to be one or all of the Lalitgiri-Ratnagiri-Udayagiri group of monastic sites, also located in Jajpur district. These sites contain ruins of many buildings, stupas of various sizes, sculptures (many now removed to museums), and other artifacts. However, archaeological excavations conducted at Langudi Hills during 1996-2006 resulted in the discovery of another site, with inscriptions describing the local monastery as pu·π£pa sabhar giriya, and identified by the excavators as Pushpagiri. This has now become the general view among scholars. The site has now been made accessible for tourism. The visit of Xuanzang indicates that Pushpagiri was an important Buddhist site in ancient India. Along with Nalanda, Vikramashila, Odantapuri, Takshashila and Vallabhi, it is believed to be a major ancient centre of learning. It flourished between 3rd and 11th centuries CE. == Historical mentions == The Chinese traveler Xuanzang (c. 602-644) describes a sangharama (monastery) named Pu-se-p'o-k'i-li in the south-west region of a country, whose name is variously transliterated as U-Cha or Wu-T-U. Scholars such as Stanislas Julien and Samuel Beal restored Pu-se-po-k'i-li as \\"Pushpagiri\\", and name of the country as Ota or \\"Udra\\". Scholars identify this country as Odra in present-day Odisha. Xuanzang describes the monastery as follows: A 3rd century inscription of the Andhra Ikshvaku king Vira-purusha-datta, found at Nagarjunakonda (in present-day Andhra Pradesh), mentions that an upasika named Bodhisiri made numerous endownments to Buddhist establishments. One of these included sponsoring the erection of a stone mandapa at \\"Puphagiri\\". According to Thomas E. Donaldson, this is likely same as the Pushpagiri mentioned in Xuanzang's records (\\"Puphagiri\\" being the Pali form of the Sanskrit \\"Pushpagiri), and was located in the present-day Odisha. Pratapaditya Pal notes that if this identification is true, the site in Odisha must have been established by at least 3rd century. However, some other scholars, such as Dineshchandra Sircar and B. S. L. Hanumantha Rao, identify this \\"Puphagiri\\" with Pushpagiri Temple Complex in the present-day Cuddapah District of Andhra Pradesh. The 9th century Buddhist monk Prajna, after spending 18 years in various places including Nalanda, settled in an unnamed monastery of Wu-ch'a (identified with Odra), before going to China. A few scholars, such as Prabhat Mukherjee, identify this monastery with Pushpagiri. == Identification == { \\"type\\": \\"FeatureCollection\\", \\"features\\": [ { \\"type\\": \\"Feature\\", \\"properties\\": { \\"marker-symbol\\": \\"star\\", \\"title\\": \\"Langudi Hill (Pushpagiri)\\" }, \\"geometry\\": { \\"type\\": \\"Point\\", \\"coordinates\\": [86.1917, 20.7164] } }, { \\"type\\": \\"Feature\\", \\"properties\\": { \\"marker-symbol\\": \\"circle\\", \\"marker-color\\": \\"0000ff\\", \\"title\\": \\"Udayagiri, Odisha\\" }, \\"geometry\\": { \\"type\\": \\"Point\\", \\"coordinates\\": [86.2692, 20.6416] } }, { \\"type\\": \\"Feature\\", \\"properties\\": { \\"marker-symbol\\": \\"circle\\", \\"marker-color\\": \\"00ff00\\", \\"title\\": \\"Ratnagiri, Odisha\\" }, \\"geometry\\": { \\"type\\": \\"Point\\", \\"coordinates\\": [86.3354, 20.6412] } }, { \\"type\\": \\"Feature\\", \\"properties\\": { \\"marker-symbol\\": \\"circle\\", \\"marker-color\\": \\"ffff00\\", \\"title\\": \\"Lalitgiri\\" }, \\"geometry\\": { \\"type\\": \\"Point\\", \\"coordinates\\": [86.2524, 20.5905] } } ] } In the 20th century, a number of scholars identified the Pushpagiri mentioned in Xuanzang's records with various sites in present-day Odisha. Ramaprasad Chanda (1930) of the Archaeological Survey of India believed that either Udayagiri or Lalitgiri could be the historical Pushpagiri. Based on archaeological finds, K. C. Panigrahi (1961) hypothesized that Udayagiri, Lalitgiri and Ratnagiri formed a common complex, which was called Pushpagiri. As the crow flies, Ratnagiri and Udaygiri are about 11 km apart, and both about 7 km from Lalitgiri. N. K. Sahu (1958) placed Pushpagiri somewhere in the Phulbani- Ghumsur region, based on geographical descriptions in Xuanzang's works. In 1985, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) started excavation at Lalitgiri to confirm its relation to Pushpagiri. The excavation led to several important archaeological discoveries, but none of these confirmed the identification of Lalitgiri with Pushpagiri. === Langudi Hill excavations === In the 1990s, college lecturer Harish Chandra Prusty discovered a Buddhist site on the Langudi Hill in Jajpur district. This is some 18 km distant from Udaygiri, the closest of the \\"triangle\\" sites, further up the river. In 1993, he and Pradeep Mohanty described the Langudi site in an article published in the Bulletin of the Deccan College Research Institute. In 1996, the Orissa Institute of Maritime and South East Asia Studies and the Odisha state's archaeology department started exploring the site. Between 1996 and 2006, the Institute carried out excavations of an area stretching over . A fragmented Brahmi inscription discovered at the site names the site as pu·π£pa sabhar giriya (\\"flower-filled hill\\"), identified by the excavators as Pushpagiri. In 2000, an excavation conducted by the institute, under the supervision of archaeologist Debraj Pradhan, resulted in the discovery of a large stupa as well as several other archaeological artifacts. The artifacts included pillars, a fragmentary Brahmi inscription, terracota seals and Northern Black Polished Ware. Debraj Pradhan believed the stupa to have been erected by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka (304‚Äì232 BCE): Although Xuanzang suggests that Odra had 10 stupas erected by Ashoka, this is the only one to have been discovered so far. According to B. N. Mukherjee of Calcutta University, who deciphered the Brahmi inscription, the stupa may have been erected by \\"a lay Buddhist worshipper called Ashoka\\". By 2007, 34 rock-cut stupas of various sizes had been discovered on the northern part of the hill. A number of Buddhist rock-cut sculptures were discovered on the southern spur of the hill, including sculptures of Dhyani Buddhas in various postures. According to D. K. Dimri, the superintendent of the ASI's Orissa circle, the archaeological finds at the site cover a period between 1st century CE and 9th century CE, and suggest the existence of a major Buddhist monastic establishment. In 2007, the ASI took over the excavated site.

There are other Buddhist attractions around Langudi hills. Kaima hill, in its immediate vicinity, contains a unique rock-cut elephant surrounded by four monolithic khondalite pillars; this dates from the Mauryan period in the 3rd century, BCE. Deuli, a hill situated in the confluence of the Brahmani and Kimiria rivers, has preserved five rock-cut Buddhist chambers inside caves. Additional Buddhist sites have been discovered at Bajragiri, Sarapur and Paikrapur. The Langudi sites are perhaps the largest historic Buddhist complex in India. Langudi can be approached from Jaraka and Chandikhol on the National Highway 5, and is easily accessible from the urban centres of Cuttack and Bhubaneswar. The best months to visit the place are during October and February. ==References== Category:Buddhist sites in Odisha Category:Buddhist monasteries in India Category:Buddhist pilgrimage sites in India Category:Ancient universities of the Indian subcontinent Category:Buddhist universities and colleges Category:Buildings and structures in Jajpur district Category:Defunct Buddhist monasteries Category:Education in Odisha Category:Former Buddhist temples Category:Former populated places in India Category:Ruins in India Category:Stupas in India Category:3rd-century Buddhist temples Category:Educational institutions established in the 3rd century Category:3rd- century establishments in India Category:11th-century disestablishments in India Category:Archaeological monuments in Odisha Category:Buddhism in Odisha ","title":"Pushpagiri Vihara"},{"id":"11656053","text":"Platysilurus is a genus of long-whiskered catfishes native to South America. == Taxonomy == Platysilurus is classified under the \\"Calophysus-Pimelodus clade\\".

The village is separated by a few fields (the Hilperton Gap) from the northeastern edge of the town of Trowbridge and is approximately from Trowbridge town centre. South of Hilperton village are large areas of housing constructed from 1997, including Paxcroft Mead, Castle Mead and Lacock Gardens; these districts are sometimes mistaken for suburbs of Trowbridge. To the east are the Devizes Road and Stourton Park housing areas, and Paxcroft, a small industrial hamlet. In the west of the parish is the village of Hilperton Marsh which is adjacent to the village of Staverton (a separate parish) and the Canal Road Industrial Estate (part of Trowbridge). In the north, beyond the Kennet and Avon Canal, is the rural hamlet of Whaddon. The Bristol Avon forms part of the parish's northern boundary. The Paxcroft Brook, a tributary of the River Biss, crosses the south of the parish. ==History== Settlements with altogether 12 households were recorded at Helprintone or Helperitone in the Domesday Book of 1086. Little is known of Hilperton's history until the 19th century; home-based cloth weaving was a major source of employment but declined during that century. From the 16th century the Long family were landowners at Hilperton and Whaddon. Hilperton House dates from the 18th century and is Grade II* listed. A school with 100 places was built near the church c. 1840 and replaced with a larger building in 1875, which by 1893 was attended by 122 children on average. All ages attended until 1931, when it was reorganised into an infant school and junior school; it became voluntary controlled in 1948. Responding to the increase in population, a new school was opened in 1970 a short distance to the north, and was attended by 151 in 2004. The ancient parish of Whaddon was merged with Semington in 1894, then transferred to Hilperton in the late 20th century. The population of the parish was 748 in the 1801 census and little changed at 825 in 1951, but by 1971 had more than doubled to 1,928 and by 2011 had again increased to 4,967. A 2016 community governance review extended the Trowbridge boundary northeast into Hilperton, effective April 2017. The area transferred to Trowbridge, lying south of Hilperton Drive, has around 260 houses, The Mead primary school, and a local shopping centre with a Budgens supermarket and the Red Admiral pub. ==Religious sites== ===Church of England=== The ecclesiastical parishes of Hilperton and Whaddon were combined in 1854.Church of St Michael and All Saints The parish church of St Michael and All Angels was largely rebuilt by T.H. Wyatt in 1852, as the previous 15th-century church had insufficient capacity. Internal changes were made in the 1890s, including relocation of the organ to an enlarged vestry, the addition of stained glass windows, and the installation of the 12th-century font bowl from the church at Whaddon, mounted on a 19th-century shaft and base. Five of the six bells were recast in 1909. St Mary's church at Hilperton Marsh was built as a chapel of ease in 1889, using prefabricated corrugated iron components. After further funds were raised, a chancel in stone and flint was added in 1899; the church also gained the 19th-century font from St Michael's. Services were influenced by the Anglo-Catholic Oxford Movement. Changes in 1954 created the parish of Staverton with Hilperton Marsh, where St Mary's became the sole church on the closure of the older St Paul's church at Staverton in 2011. Whaddon's Church of St Mary is from the 12th and 14th centuries; a chapel for the Long family (later of Rood Ashton House) was added in 1770, and the chancel and bellcote were rebuilt in 1879. 12th-century stones survive, although rearranged, in the north (blocked) and south doorways. The church was designated as Grade II* listed in 1988. Today the two Hilperton churches, together with those at Whaddon and Semington, comprise the Canalside Benefice. ===Nonconformists=== A Particular Baptist chapel, an offshoot of the Back Street chapel at Trowbridge, was built in Hilperton village in 1806 and enlarged in 1821. The congregation numbered 59 in 1829 and 30 in 1890; the chapel continued in use until the second half of the 20th century, and has been replaced by dwellings. A Wesleyan Methodist chapel was built in the village in 1819, then rebuilt in 1891 with seating for 300. The chapel closed before the 1990s and is now a private house. ==Local government== Hilperton is an ancient civil parish with its own elected parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions. Hilperton electoral ward has the same boundaries as the parish; it has been represented by Cllr Ernie Clark (Independent) since 9 May 2005. ==Amenities== Hilperton village has a free house pub, the Lion and Fiddle, on Devizes Road. The post office and general stores closed in 2004, though a petrol station (with a small shop) remains in place. The village hall on Whaddon Lane is the social hub of the older part of Hilperton, and the adjoining football pitch is home to Hilperton United FC. Trowbridge Rugby Football Club, who play in Southern Counties South, have their ground at Paxcroft. The Kennet and Avon Canal crosses the rural northern section of the parish and forms the western boundary of Hilperton Marsh, where there is a marina. The village school continues as Hilperton CE Primary School. The south of the parish is served by The Mead Community Primary School at Paxcroft Mead, which was in Hilperton parish when it opened in 2001 but is within the area transferred to Trowbridge in 2017. Castle Mead School, another primary school in Trowbridge parish, is nearby. ==Landmarks== Hilperton is home to a mid-18th century limestone village lock-up known as The Blind House,http://roys- roy.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/lock-ups-at-heytesbury-hilperton-and.html a set of stocks,https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/618996 a green village pump manufactured by Lee Howl,http://www.villagepumps.org.uk/pumpsWilts.htm a milestone giving directions to three nearby towns, and two elaborate Paxcroft Mead signs constructed in 1997.

It is headquartered in Houston, Texas with Bishop Scott J. Jones currently serving as the presiding Bishop. The Texas Annual Conference is also unofficially referred to as \\"the Houston Area of The United Methodist Church\\". The Texas Annual Conference is the largest Annual Conference in the Church's South Central Jurisdiction and the third largest in the United Methodist denomination. The Texas Annual Conference was the original Annual Conference in Texas, which now contains 6 Annual Conferences that were carved out of the original Texas Conference. The State of Texas now has 5 geographical and 1 Spanish language conference. The jurisdiction of the Spanish language Conference, the Rio Grande Conference, covers the entire State of Texas and portions of New Mexico. The Texas Annual Conference contains over 1000 churches in over 800 pastoral appointments, 12 Wesley Foundations, 2 higher education institutions and many other ministries and outreaches. == Districts of the Texas Annual Conference == The Texas Conference is divided into 9 districts that cover subdivided areas of the conference territory. Districts are the United Methodist equivalent of a Roman Catholic diocese. McMahan Chapel, the oldest Protestant church in Texas and one of the oldest Protestant congregations west of the Mississippi River, is located in the East District and is celebrated each year with an annual Conference wide worship service and gathering, McMahon Chapel Day . The original Methodist missionary to what was then the Mexican territory of Texas, the Rev. Littleton Fowler, is buried under the pulpit of McMahon's Chapel. The Rev. Sumner Bacon, the first Presbyterian missionary to Texas, is buried in the nearby Chapel Hill United Methodist Church cemetery. District Superintendents (commonly referred to as a \\"DS\\") supervise each district. The superintendents serve for six years but they can serve for as long as eight if the presiding Bishop feels that there are exceptional reasons to do so. A superintendent may serve up to 12 years in total during the course of their ministry, and there are no exceptions allowed to this rule. Each of the nine districts coordinate, supervise, and support all of the work of the Church within its geographical boundaries. The West District in the Texas Annual Conference is currently the highest apportionment paying District in the entire United Methodist denomination. The southern and eastern districts of the Annual Conference were deeply affected by the damage of Hurricane Ike in the Fall of 2008, with several coastal congregations being wiped out completely. == External links == * The Texas Annual Conference website Category:United Methodist Church ","title":"Texas Annual Conference"},{"id":"11656077","text":"Soupy Norman is an eight-part Irish-Polish television programme broadcast by RT√â. It aired weekly on Thursday nights at 23:05 on the RT√â Two channel, in ten-minute segments. The series ran from May to December 2007. The show is a comedic re-dubbing of the Polish soap opera Pierwsza mi≈Ço≈õƒá (First Love), which has been running on Polsat television since 2004. The series is written and edited by Barry Murphy and Mark Doherty, with additional voices provided by Tara Flynn, Sue Collins, Luke Murphy and Mario Rosenstock. Where the original soap opera dealt with a girl leaving her family behind to go to college, the re-dubbed version of the programme explores the culture shock of a dysfunctional Polish family from Cork in Dublin. The series' surreal humour led to a cult following, with its episodes being popular on YouTube. A special episode entitled \\"The Late Late Soupy Norman Tribute\\" which featured dubbed clips from RT√â's The Late Late Show as well as clips from previous episodes of Soupy Norman as well as including a new scene of the show. This was broadcast on Christmas Eve 2007. A pilot sketch for the series initially aired on Armando Iannucci's show Time Trumpet on BBC 2, of which this show was a spin- off. ==Plot== The main story of the show concerns Esther, a Polish-Irish teenager from Buttevant, County Cork, who travels up to Dublin to study in college. There she encounters strong discrimination, for being a \\"culchie\\". She lives with Susan Costigan (or Gleeson, depending on the episode), described by Esther as \\"a woman with red hair\\", her daughter Kylie, her son Nathan (who becomes possessed by voices in the episode \\"Omen\\"), and her husband Declan. Kylie becomes Esther's friend, and they are seen stealing items (such as a dog) in the episode \\"Margarita\\". The series' other main characters are Esther's father, named Jack, and her Grandad, known to Jack as \\"Daddy\\", who live in Buttevant. She has a sister, who is unseen throughout the series, who Jack mentions a few times (\\"I have two daughters ‚Äì two of them ‚Äì and one of them's a boy\\"). Grandad is an extreme authority figure, as seen in the first episode \\"Buttevant\\", often sending Jack to the \\"bold chair\\" if he disobeys him in any way. He constantly berates Jack, calling him a \\"great big disappointment\\". The two of them are mostly seen drinking vinegar (Jack thinking it was whisky), and being visited by Soupy Norman, the title character. Soupy is always extremely aggressive and inebriated, and is only ever seen stumbling into the pair's house, delivering rambling, nonsensical rantings to the two men, always trying to punch Jack. In one episode, he asks to marry Esther's sister. He refers to Esther as \\"that culchie bitch\\". The Soupy Norman sequences are always taken from the same scene from First Love, and are repeated every episode. The series has a subplot of Sean, a Dublin youth, trying to make a living in the city. He does this by applying for increasingly strange jobs, such as a builder, walking a dog with \\"canine leg disorder\\", running the \\"Red Car Bar\\" nightclub, and helping Satanic spirits in the episode \\"Omen\\" (a reference to the film The Omen.) In the final episode, \\"Straz\\", a character called Soupy Dave (who is sometimes seen throughout the series trying to sell Jack and Grandad shady goods such as prawns and whale meat) is contracted by Jack's estranged wife (rarely seen before this episode) to kill him, using a number of surreal techniques. ==Episodes== ==Legacy== Although unsuccessful on its initial broadcast, Soupy Norman acquired a following online and is now considered a cult classic, with a 2018 article on RT√â's website naming it the third greatest Irish sitcom of all time, with the Rubberbandits commenting \\"To this day I've no idea how RTE let something that good on TV\\". ==References== ==External links== * Soupy Norman official site * The original sketch on Youtube * Soupy Norman on Bebo * Review of the series Category:2007 Irish television series debuts Category:2007 Polish television series debuts Category:Parody television series Category:Irish comedy-drama television series Category:Polish comedy-drama television series Category:2000s comedy-drama television series Category:RT√â original programming Category:2007 Irish television series endings Category:2007 Polish television series endings Category:2000s Irish television series Category:2000s Polish television series Category:Irish people of Polish descent ","title":"Soupy Norman"},{"id":"11656098","title":"Abu Basma Regional Council"},{"id":"11656122","text":"Fairfield and Suisun Transit (FAST) provides general public fixed route bus service through eight local and two intercity/commuter routes.

It was the first Silverface amplifier introduced in 1967 to sport the modern-looking \\"tailless\\" Fender amp decal, which became a standard feature on other Fender amplifiers in the early 1970s. The Bronco was a student amp to go with the matching Bronco guitar. Bronco amplifiers were shipped as a part of the Bronco \\"student\\" package offered during that time, which also included the matching Bronco guitar, introduced that same year. Some early Broncos used the early-mid 1960s \\"tailed\\" amp logo. The schematics and manuals listed the Bronco and the Vibro Champ as the same amp, except for the red letters and labels stamped on the control faceplate (Vibro Champs have blue labels and lettering like the rest of the Silverface amplifier models). The controls were also the same. It was discontinued in 1975. Teagle, J. and Sprung, J.: Fender Amps: The First Fifty Years ==Technical information== Fender has recently released an amplifier bearing the name \\"Bronco\\" but it has little resemblance to the original version beyond using an speaker. The new Bronco is a completely solid state amplifier using integrated circuits to control both the preamp section as well as power amp section of the amplifier. Solid state diodes are used to rectify the input AC mains electricity going into the amp to DC. Current production Fender Bronco amplifiers use no tubes and are housed in a tweed style cabinet constructed of medium density fiberboard and covered in a diagonal tweed fabric similar in appearance to amplifiers produced by Fender in the late 1950s. New production Broncos have the controls mounted on the top-rear of the amplifier unlike the original 'Silverface' Bronco. The original Fender Bronco uses an all-tube AB764 circuit featuring a 12AX7 dual-triode preamp tube utilizing both sections of the tube in the preamp section of the amp. A second 12AX7 tube is used for driving the vibrato function. The power tube in the original Bronco is the 6V6GTA power tube, often used by Fender in its tube amps of the era. This amp's circuitry design is commonly known as a 'single-ended, class A' amplifier. Rectification in the original Bronco is via a single 5Y3GT rectifier tube, used by Fender since the early 1950s. In fact, Fender used an earlier version of this rectifier tube in the 1940s (the 5Y3) before it was phased out by manufacturers in the early 1950s to be replaced by the more electrically robust 5Y3GT. ==References== ==External links== Owner's Manual for the current production solid state Fender Bronco Category:Instrument amplifiers B ","title":"Fender Bronco Amp"},{"id":"11656148","text":"Financial crime is crime committed against property, involving the unlawful conversion of the ownership of property (belonging to one person) to one's own personal use and benefit. Financial crimes may involve fraud (cheque fraud, credit card fraud, mortgage fraud, medical fraud, corporate fraud, securities fraud (including insider trading), bank fraud, insurance fraud, market manipulation, payment (point of sale) fraud, health care fraud); theft; scams or confidence tricks; tax evasion; bribery; sedition; embezzlement; identity theft; money laundering; and forgery and counterfeiting, including the production of Counterfeit money and consumer goods. Financial crimes may involve additional criminal acts, such as computer crime and elder abuse, even violent crimes such as robbery, armed robbery or murder. Financial crimes may be carried out by individuals, corporations, or by organized crime groups. Victims may include individuals, corporations, governments, and entire economies. == Bribery == The U.S. introduced the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in 1977 to address bribery of foreign officials. This legislation dominated international anti-corruption enforcement until around 2010 when other countries began introducing broader and more robust legislation, notably the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010. The International Organization for Standardization introduced an international anti-bribery management system standard in 2016. In recent years, cooperation in enforcement action between countries has increased. ==Money Laundering== For most countries, money laundering and terrorist financing raise significant issues with regard to prevention, detection and prosecution. Sophisticated techniques used to launder money and finance terrorism add to the complexity of these issues. Such sophisticated techniques may involve different types of financial institutions; multiple financial transactions; the use of intermediaries, such as financial advisers, accountants, shell corporations and other service providers; transfers to, through, and from different countries; and the use of different financial instruments and other kinds of value-storing assets. Money laundering is, however, a fundamentally simple concept. It is the process by which proceeds from a criminal activity are disguised to conceal their true origin. Basically, money laundering involves the proceeds of criminally derived property rather than the property itself. Money laundering can be defined in a number of ways, most countries subscribe to the definition adopted by the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (1988) (Vienna Convention) and the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (2000) (Palermo Convention): The Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF), which is recognized as the international standard setter for Anti-money Laundering (AML) efforts, defines the term \\"money laundering\\" briefly as \\"the processing of criminal proceeds to disguise their illegal origin\\" in order to \\"legitimize\\" the ill-gotten gains of crime. In 2005, money laundering within the financial industry in the UK was believed to amount to ¬£25bn a year. In 2009, a United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) study estimated that criminal proceeds amounted to 3.6% of global GDP, with 2.7% (or USD 1.6 trillion) being laundered. == Fraud == In 2005, fraud within the financial industry was estimated to cost the UK ¬£14 billion a year. == Law enforcement agencies == There are law enforcement agencies whose main enforcement activities focus on criminal violations of their country's tax code and related financial crimes, such as money laundering, currency violations, tax- related identity theft fraud, and terrorist financing. Some of these law enforcement agencies are: * Australia - Australian Taxation Office * Canada - Canada Revenue Agency * Mexico - Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera * Netherlands - Fiscale Inlichtingen- en Opsporingsdienst * Nigeria - Economic and Financial Crimes Commission * United Kingdom - Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs * United States of America - Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation == See also == * Black market * Credit card fraud * Financial Crimes Enforcement Network * Financing of terrorism * Fraud * Greenmail * Grey market * Mafia * Money laundering * Organized crime * Securities fraud * Skimming (casinos) * Skimming (fraud) * Structuring (smurfing) * Tax haven * White-collar crime * World Bank residual model * Wood laundering ==References== ==External links== *Havocscope Black Markets - Database on black market activities such as money laundering and tax evasion. *Federal Bureau of Investigation - Financial Crimes Report to the Public * EU financial crimes website * International cooperation on money laundering and FATF * Category:Property crimes ","title":"Financial crime"},{"id":"11656212","text":"Brazil‚ÄìGuyana relations have traditionally been close.

In 1968, immediately after Venezuelan President Raul Leoni decreed \\"ownership\\" of a nine-mile strip of ocean off Guyana's three-mile territorial sea limits, the Brazilian government showed support to Guyana in the controversy with Venezuela. It also helped promote closer bilateral relations, and on August 26, 1968 Deputy Prime Minister Ptolemy Reid visited Brazil for discussions with leaders of the Brazilian government. As a result, the Brazilian government announced the opening of a Brazilian embassy in Georgetown. In 1970, the Brazilian government inaugurated the Centre of Brazilian Studies in Georgetown and begun to construct a highway that would link the Brazilian city of Manaus to the capital of Guyana, Georgetown. In 1975, the United States alleged that Guyana was allowing Cuban troops to refuel in Guyana en route to the Angolan civil war. The Brazilian military government was staunchly anti-communist, and it briefly undertook military maneuvers on its border with Guyana. In November 2002, it was reported that Brazil had carried out a military operation in the region of Guyana claimed by Suriname, to destroy several airstrips used by drug traffickers. The Brazilian government did not confirm the story, but insisted that if it had been carried out it would have been done with Guyana's permission. In 2016, during the commemorations of the 50th anniversary of Guyana's independence, the Brazilian government officially changed the way it spelled the name of its neighbouring country, from colonial-form Guiana, with an \\"i\\", to the post-independence, official form \\"Guyana\\". ==See also== *Foreign relations of Brazil *Foreign relations of Guyana *Union of South American Nations ==References== * * ==External links== *Brazilian Defence, Naval and Army Attach√© in Guyana *Ministry of Foreign Relations of Brazil *Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Guyana Guyana Category:Bilateral relations of Guyana ","title":"Brazil‚ÄìGuyana relations"},{"id":"11656225","text":"your bitcoinThe following lists events that happened during 1952 in Afghanistan. ==Incumbents== * Monarch ‚Äì Mohammed Zahir Shah * Prime Minister ‚Äì Shah Mahmud Khan ==January 6, 1952== Shah Wali Khan, Afghan ambassador to the United Kingdom, says in an interview with The Hindu that the area of Pakhtunistan includes the states of Chitral, Dir, Swat, Bajaur, Tirah, Waziristan, and Baluchistan. \\"The right of 8,000,000 Pakhtuns to enjoy freedom cannot be ignored,\\" he adds. ==January 1952== A bill to nationalize oil is passed by the seventh National Assembly and a UN technical assistance mission under Philip Beck (U.S.) is invited to Afghanistan. Shortly after its arrival the mission visits the Shibarghan area in the northwest, about 72 km from the Soviet border, where rich oil deposits have been discovered. On August 21 Izvestiya publishes a report that this mission is a tool of the U.S. imperialists, who are planning the construction of military roads and airfields near the Soviet border. Later Andrey Vyshinsky, the Soviet foreign minister, sends a strong note to Kabul protesting against the mission's presence in Afghanistan. The Kabul government refutes this note in September, explaining that, as Afghanistan's economic life depends on motor transport, all oil prospecting is in the country's vital interests. ==February 1952== A royal proclamation is issued calling upon the people to elect the eighth National Assembly (171 seats) within three months.

The Helmand valley irrigation projects are coordinated under a specially appointed development board. This board will have under its control the two large irrigation and hydroelectric power dams of Arghandab and Kajakai as well as the Nahr-i-Boghra 154-km-long canal. The two major dams will irrigate 650,000 ac of formerly arid land, and the new power stations will have a generating capacity of more than 200,000 kW. These projects have cost the country more than $60,000,000 since their inception in 1946. In addition to these projects, the Sarobi hydroelectric power plant about 65 km downstream from Kabul enters its third and last phase; it will have a generating capacity of 24,000 kW. The main use of the power will be to run the Gul-Bahar textile mill of 1,800 looms, which will substantially increase the cloth production that by 1953 stands at 10,000,000 m per year from the four existing mills. Coal production was increased by one-third during 1952‚Äì53 to 14,500 tons yearly. Plans in hand call for the opening of new collieries which will treble the 1953 output.

He was the third son of Hannibal Hamlin, the Vice President of the United States, and his wife. His brother, Charles Hamlin, was a Union Army majorHunt and Brown, p. 257.Eicher, p. 276. who was appointed a brevet brigadier general at the end of the war.Eicher, p. 747. Hamlin was educated at the Hampden Academy and studied at Waterville College (now Colby College) in Waterville, Maine. He was admitted to the bar in 1860 and practiced law for a year in Kittery, Maine. ==Civil War== Hamlin was commissioned as a captain in the Union Army in April 1862, serving as an aide-de-camp to Maj. Gen. John C. Fr√©mont. Hamlin was among the first to advocate enlisting African-American troops in the Union Army. In February 1863, he was appointed the first colonel of the 80th United States Colored Troops and was assigned to field duty in Louisiana. There he eventually took charge of a brigade of black troops and participated in the Siege of Port Hudson. He was promoted to brigadier general in December 1864 and assigned command of the military district of Port Hudson, Louisiana, Department of the Gulf. Hamlin was mustered out of the United States Volunteers on January 15, 1866. On February 21, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Hamlin for the award of the honorary grade of brevet major general, U.S. Volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the award on April 26, 1866.Eicher, p. 712. Hamlin was a Companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. ==Postbellum life== Hamlin remained in Louisiana after the war during the early days of Reconstruction, but died of yellow fever in 1867. Although he was initially interred in the Girod Street Cemetery in New Orleans, Louisiana, he was reburied three months later in his family plot at Mount Hope Cemetery in Bangor, Maine. ==See also== *List of American Civil War generals (Union) ==Notes== ==References== * Eicher, John H., and David J.

The CNV component was first described by W. Grey Walter and colleagues in an article published in Nature in 1964. The importance of this finding was that it was one of the first studies which showed that consistent patterns of the amplitude of electric responses could be obtained from the large background noise which occurs in electroencephalography (EEG) recordings and that this activity could be related to a cognitive process such as expectancy. ==Main paradigms== Grey Walter and colleagues conducted the experiment in the chronometric paradigm. They had noticed that the electric response became attenuated, or habituated when a single stimulus is repeated. They also noticed that the amplitude of the electric response returned when a second stimulus was associated with the first stimulus. These effects were strengthened when a behavioral response was required for the second stimulus. In a chronometric paradigm, the first stimulus is called the warning stimulus and the second stimulus, often one that directs the subject to make a behavioral response, is called the imperative stimulus. The foreperiod is the time between the warning and imperative stimuli. The time between the imperative stimulus and the behavioral response is called the reaction time. The CNV, then, is seen in the foreperiod, between the warning and imperative stimulus. Walter and colleagues also noticed that electric responses to warning stimuli seemed to have three phases: a brief positive component, a brief negative component, and a sustained negative component. They noticed that the brief components varied due to sensory modality, while the sustained component varied with the contingency between the warning and imperative stimuli and the attention of the subject. They labeled this component the \\"contingent negative variation\\" because the variation of the negative wave was contingent on the statistical relationship between the warning and imperative stimuli. In their study, Walter et al. (1964) presented clicks or flashes, singly or in pairs, at intervals between 3‚Äì10 sec. The warning stimuli were single clicks or flashes and the imperative stimuli were repetitive clicks or flashes. The modality of the imperative stimuli was opposite that of the warning stimuli. The behavioral response was a button press which terminated the repetitive stimuli. In 1990 a bidirectional CNV paradigm was used by Liljana Bozinovska and her team to obtain a CNV-based brain-computer interface for control of a computer buzzer.L. Bozinovska, G. Stojanov, M.

Proceedings of the 4th International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering, Antalya, Turkey, p. 451-454, 2009 ==Component characteristics== Walter et al. (1964) showed that a single click elicits a brief positive peak and a brief negative peak. Repetitive flashes elicit brief positive and negative peaks. If these stimuli are separated by 1 sec the same individual patterns result. After around 50 presentations, these peaks are indistinguishable from noise. On the other hand, when a single click is followed by the repetitive flashes which are terminated by a button press, there is a large gradual negative peak which ends sharply with the button press. This is the contingent negative variation. Another classical study was described by Joseph Tecce in the Psychological Bulletin in 1972. In this review, Tecce summarizes the development, morphology, and locus of appearance of the CNV. ===Development=== Studies have shown that the CNV appears after about 30 trials of paired stimuli, although this number can be reduced when the subject understands the task in advance. Light flashes, clicks, and tones have all been used to elicit the CNV. A response to the imperative stimulus is necessary to elicit a clear CNV. This response could be a physical or mental response. The CNV is elicited when two, linked stimuli are presented. When the imperative stimulus is removed unexpectedly, the CNV attenuates until it is completely suppressed after about 20‚Äì50 trials. The CNV is immediately restored if paired with the imperative stimulus again. ===Morphology=== The negative CNV peak rises around 260‚Äì470 ms after the warning stimulus. It will rise quickly if the subject is uncertain about when the imperative stimulus will be, and it will rise gradually if the subject is confident about when the imperative stimulus will be. The maximum amplitude is usually around 20 microvolts. ===Topography=== The CNV appears most prominently at the vertex and is bilaterally symmetrical. ==Functional sensitivity== There is much research which describes what stimulus characteristics can affect characteristics of the CNV. For example, intensity, modality, duration, stimulus rate, probability, stimulus relevance, and pitch discrimination can affect the CNV component. ===Attention and expectancy=== Attention also affects the amplitude of the CNV. The following examples from various task conditions and studies show that the CNV is changed when the experimental protocol changes the attention needed to perform the tasks. First, when subjects were told that the imperative stimulus would be removed, the CNV was reduced. Second, in one condition subjects were allowed to choose whether they were going to press the button or not. In trials where the subject chose not to respond, there was no CNV. Third, when the subject was specifically told that there would not be repetitive flashes, no CNV was elicited. Fourth, another condition showed that a CNV was elicited in subjects who were told to estimate when the repetitive flashes would come even when no flashes were presented. Fifth, when subjects were asked to pay attention and respond quickly, CNV amplitude was increased. The results of these conditions suggest that the CNV is related to attention and expectancy. ===Probability=== When the probability of repetitive flashes is random and the repetitive flashes are removed in about 50% of the trials, the amplitude of the CNV is about half as that of normal. ===Intensity=== Some researchers have shown that the intensity of the stimulus may affect the CNV amplitude. It seems that the CNV component has a higher amplitude for stimuli that have low-intensity, i.e. is difficult to see or hear, as opposed to stimuli that have high-intensity. This could be because the subject must pay more attention to perceive the low-intensity stimulus. If the detection of the imperative task becomes too difficult, then the CNV amplitude is reduced. In other words, attention to the imperative stimulus is important for the development of the CNV and increased task difficulties distract the attention. In related studies, researchers have also shown that the larger the motoric response needed, the larger the CNV. Studies with subjects that have a lack of sleep tend to show a reduced CNV. This provides further evidence that lack of attention might decrease the CNV amplitude. ===Interstimulus interval=== The amplitude of the CNV changes when one changes the foreperiod, or interstimulus interval (ISI). The most frequent ISI used is between 1.0‚Äì1.5 seconds. Trials with an ISI between 0.5‚Äì1.5 elicit a robust CNV wave. When the ISI is reduced to 0.125 or 0.25 seconds, the CNV becomes suppressed. On the other hand, trials with an ISI of 4.8 seconds show reduced CNV amplitude. ==O-wave and E-wave== Most researchers agree that the CNV component has been associated with information processing and response preparation. The main controversy is whether the CNV is composed of more than one component. After discovery of the CNV, researchers were able to distinguish between two main components of the CNV. Loveless and Sanford (1975) and Weerts and Lang (1973) increased the interstimulus interval to greater than 3 seconds and showed that two components can be visually distinguished from the CNV. The first wave followed the warning stimulus and was called the O wave, or orienting wave. This wave showed enhanced amplitude in the frontal regions. The second wave preceded the imperative stimulus and was called the E wave, or expectancy wave. A study conducted by Gaillard (1976) provided further evidence that the O wave was frontally distributed and was more strongly affected by auditory stimuli rather than visual stimuli. A related, important issue has been the question of whether all or part of the CNV corresponds to the readiness potential. The readiness potential is the neural preparation for motoric responses. Both components have a similar scalp distribution with a negative amplitude and are associated with a motor response. In fact, many researchers claimed that the terminal CNV, or E wave, was in fact the readiness potential, or Bereitschaftspotential. This was the general consensus until other work provided evidence that the CNV can be distinguished from the RP. First, the RP is usually lateralized to the contralateral side of the motoric response, while the CNV is usually bilateral. Second, the CNV can occur even when a motor response is not required. Third, a RP occurs without any external stimuli. This shows that the RP occurs for motor responses while the CNV occurs when two stimuli are contingent with each other. ==Localization== Another important topic in studying the CNV component is localizing the general source of the CNV. For example, Hultin, Rossini, Romani, H√∂gstedt, Tecchio, and Pizzella (1996) used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to determine the location of the electromagnetic source of the CNV wave. Their experiment suggests that the terminal CNV is located within Brodmann's area 6 and corresponds to the premotor cortex. The work done by Zappoli and colleagues is another example of research completed to determine the generators of the CNV component. Zappoli (2003) studied the ERP patterns, including the CNV, of subjects with brain disorders or brain damage. Zappoli reviews evidence which shows that in certain cases epileptic discharges affect the expectance waves and therefore decrease the CNV amplitude. Zappoli also described research which investigated the CNV characteristics in patients which had lobotomies of frontal regions. The CNV amplitudes were decreased or absent in these patients. ==Theory== Many theories have been posited to account for cognitive processes underlying the CNV component. Walter and colleagues suggested that CNV amplitude varies directly with subjective probability or expectancy of the imperative stimuli. Other researchers suggested that the CNV amplitude varies with the intention to perform an act. Another theory is that CNV varies with the motivation of the subject to complete the task. Tecce suggests that the CNV is related to both attention and arousal level. ==See also== * Bereitschaftspotential * C1 and P1 * Difference due to memory * Early left anterior negativity * Error- related negativity * Late positive component * Lateralized readiness potential * Mismatch negativity * N2pc * N100 * N170 * N200 * N400 * P3a * P3b * P200 * P300 (neuroscience) * P600 * Somatosensory evoked potential * Visual N1 ==References== Category:Electroencephalography Category:Evoked potentials ","title":"Contingent negative variation"},{"id":"11656280","text":"your bitcoinThe following lists events that happened during 1954 in Afghanistan.

In 1859 he earned his medical doctorate from the University of Vienna, where he studied under Carl Ferdinand von Arlt (1812-1887). Beginning in 1867 he was a professor of ophthalmology at the University of Heidelberg. Becker was a pioneer in ophthalmic pathology, and the author of numerous writings on the eye. His many publications include treatises on the vessels of the macula lutea, congenital total color blindness, strictures of the lacrimal canaliculi and manifestations involving the movement of blood in the retina. He also completed Arlt's autobiography, \\"Meine Erlebnisse\\", following the death of his former teacher, and in 1866, published a German edition of Franciscus Cornelis Donders' work \\"On the Anomalies of Accommodation and Refraction of the Eye\\" (London, 1864) as \\"Die Anomalien der Accommodation und Refraktion des Auges\\". In addition, he published a large number of anatomist Heinrich M√ºller's medical papers in a collection titled \\"Heinrich M√ºller's gesammelte und hinterlassene Schriften zur Anatomie und Physiologie des Auges\\" (Heinrich M√ºller's collected and bequeathed writings on the anatomy and physiology of the eye).Heinrich M√ºller @ Who Named It Dr. Jos√© Rizal (1861-1896), martyr and national hero of the Philippines, completed his ophthalmological studies under Professor Becker at the University Eye Clinic Heidelberg in 1886.

In 1887 Becker established the \\"Graefe Museum\\" at the University of Heidelberg in honor of oculist Albrecht von Graefe (1828-1870). In 1879 he introduced the concept \\"cataracta complicata\\" to describe lenticular changes that often appear in various ocular diseases -- these are generally characterized by punctate, striate or diffuse opacities often accompanied with a polychromatic luster.

He was trained at first by Michael Moorer then by Jeff Mayweather and now by Norman Wilson; his manager is the very powerful Scott Hirsch who recently netted his fighters Jameel McCline and Shannon Briggs Don King-arranged title fights. Hirsch seems determined to keep Chapman out of harm's way and move him along slowly. Chapman's opposition has been less than imposing so far; he is 28-0 but never faced a contender. None of Chapman's first fifteen opponents had a positive record, but his last twelve opponents at least all had winning records. His most notable opponents so far are Chicago-based Edward Gutierrez who was 15-0-1 coming into the bout, New York veteran John Carlo who possessed a 14-1 record, and fellow undefeated Mid-West prospect Matt Hicks 7-0. He has captured several regional heavyweight titles including the IBF Southern Regional title, the North American Boxing Council title, the WBC Latino title and the Arkansas State title. His relationship with the very well connected Hirsch has netted him valuable exposure in the boxing press as a real heavyweight prospect. He has been featured repeatedly on television and received a WBC World Rating of 14.

The offer referenced above was a $500,000 offer but David was told it was for $100,000. This is why David didn't take the fight. In addition, this was not a title fight, but David Haye was trying to add credibility to his bid to become a legitimate heavyweight. JD told me he would have to knock out David Haye to win the fight, sensing with Haye's connections in England generally and ties to the promotion, a decision would be out of the question. Also, when David did not go, his owner stopped all support and assistance. And David was threatened by a co-worker if he didn't take the fight for $100,000.

Born in Tyaskin, Maryland, he played a total of seven seasons in the majors, splitting time between eight teams in three different leagues. He is credited by the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame as the first Italian-American to play in the majors, but conversations with family members have called into question whether the family has any Italian ancestry. ==Early life== Dickerson was born in 1858. He is sometimes thought to be of Italian ancestry, but at least one historian and one family member dispute this notion. According to one of his granddaughters, he was born to William Porter Dickerson and Mary Larmore, who came to the United States from England, but who may have lived in Scotland before that. His granddaughter said that his middle name, Pessano, was given to him in honor of the physician who delivered him. She said that she was not aware of any Italian ancestry in the family. ==Career== In , Dickerson began his career with the Cincinnati Reds at the age of 19, and played 29 games in the outfield, but did not find himself a regular starting position until the following year. In , he took over the regular left field job after Charley Jones departed for the Boston Red Caps. That season proved to be his best in the majors; he batted .294, drove in 57 runs, and hit a league-leading 14 triples. Dickerson departed the team the next season, moving on to the Troy Trojans, where he played mainly in center field. He relocated to the Worcester Ruby Legs later that season and split time in center with Harry Stovey. In , he moved over to left field and had a very productive season, batting .316. He did not play in the majors again until , playing 85 games with the Pittsburgh Alleghenys. His production went down significantly, and he hit just .249. He played for four teams over the next two seasons. His best showing was with the St. Louis Maroons of the Union Association, when he hit .365 in 46 games in 1884. In , he played in five games for the Buffalo Bisons before his career came to an end. ==Post-career== Dickerson died at the age of 61 in Baltimore, Maryland. He was interred at Loudon Park CemeteryBaseball Necrology in Baltimore. In 1979, he was inducted into the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame. ==See also== *List of Major League Baseball annual triples leaders *List of Major League Baseball single-game hits leaders ==References== ==External links== * Category:1858 births Category:1920 deaths Category:Major League Baseball left fielders Category:Major League Baseball center fielders Category:19th-century baseball players Category:Baltimore Orioles (AA) players Category:Buffalo Bisons (NL) players Category:Cincinnati Reds (1876‚Äì1879) players Category:Louisville Eclipse players Category:Pittsburgh Alleghenys players Category:St. Louis Maroons players Category:Troy Trojans players Category:Worcester Ruby Legs players Category:Erie (minor league baseball) players Category:Buffalo (minor league baseball) players Category:Binghamton Crickets (1870s) players Category:Norfolk (minor league baseball) players Category:Syracuse Stars (minor league baseball) players Category:Chattanooga Lookouts players Category:Portland (minor league baseball) players Category:London Tecumsehs (baseball) players Category:New Haven (minor league baseball) players Category:Baseball players from Maryland Category:People from Wicomico County, Maryland ","title":"Buttercup Dickerson"},{"id":"11656499","text":"your bitcoinThe following lists events that happened during 1957 in Afghanistan. ==Incumbents== * Monarch - Mohammed Zahir Shah * Prime Minister - Mohammed Daoud Khan ==April and May 1957== Mohammad Daud visits Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Turkey, and Egypt. ==June 8‚Äì11, 1957== H.S.

The Miracle design represented the culmination of lessons learned from his many previous designs. Working in conjunction with Barry Read, Jack Holt developed the slot and glue method of constructing Miracles, which enabled some boats to be built from kits even by inexperienced amateurs. The first Miracle dinghies were built and launched in 1975. Since then, the Miracle's success grew strongly, and sail numbers today exceed 4,121. The Miracle is a forgiving and versatile sailing dinghy, ideal for beginners or experts, children and adults alike. There is a class association based in the UK, with several active fleets around the country. The Miracle was supplied initially as a plywood kit and designed for home building, based on the slot and glue method of construction. As a result, many Miracles were built by enthusiasts. Subsequently, professionally assembled Miracles were built by Bell Woodworking, who were the sole source of kits, and a few by other professional builders. Build quality of the commercially built craft was reportedly very good, and is supported by the fact that many older examples have survived. Most Miracles are made of wood. In the early 1990s, a composite version of the Miracle was developed, made from a combination of a glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) hull and wooden deck. Shortly after that, a boat made entirely of GRP was then produced, only a few of these remain, and they still attract good prices. In 1997, plans became available so that the dinghy could be produced as a home build again. ==References== == External links == * Classic Boat guide to the Miracle Dinghy Class * Official Miracle Dinghy Class Association Website * Miracle Association: Miracle specs * GoSail.co.uk: Introduction to the Miracle * Draycote Water Sailing Club: Miracle fleet * Miracle Dinghy Forum Category:Dinghies Category:Boats designed by Jack Holt Category:1970s sailboat type designs ","title":"Miracle (dinghy)"},{"id":"11656608","text":"Royal Copenhagen 2010 plaquettes are a series of small, collectible plates produced by Danish factories, Aluminia and Royal Copenhagen.

The most common colors are moderate to deep blue on a white background, though some have additional colors. On the front, each has a scene depicting boats, landscapes, people, animals, steeples, buildings, statues, bridges, windmills, and more. Some also have a date on the outside edge. A variety of artists have provided the detailed artwork, including Kai Lange, J√∏rgen Nielsen, and Sven Vestergaard (1932-). On the back, each plaquette has two pierced holes so the plaquettes can be hung for display. In addition to the number 2010, most (though not all) have an identification number, along with a description (usually in Danish, all capital letters) of the front scene. Some have the words ‚ÄúROYAL COPENHAGEN DENMARK FAJENCE‚Äù, or just ‚ÄòDENMARK‚Äù. Some have the factory mark, three wavy lines one atop another. Some have a monogram.

The plates were very popular as souvenirs or gifts for family abroad. The series includes a large selection of Danish castles and churches as well as other attractions. Earl Nelson Newman wrote and privately printed a small hard-cover book in 1973 entitled \\"The Danish Royal Copenhagen Plaquettes: 2010 Series\\". This book contains pictures and descriptions of plates #1-#85, and the special series featuring American Presidents, zoo animals, and antique autos. Because there was nearly no information/literatur about the \\"2010\\" Series,Carsten Pedersen (a collector himself) wrote a collector's catalogue in 2010. The catalogue describes about 448 miniplates (plaquettes) from the \\"2010\\" series and other series (old and new) from Royal Copenhagen, Aluminia, K√∂benhavns Fajancefabrik and Bing & Gr√∂ndahl, Copenhagen. The catalogue was privately printed and entitled \\"Royal Copenhagen, Aluminia, Bing & Gr√∂ndahl - Plaquetten-Miniplates Series 2010 and special editions\\" ==References== ==Further reading== * Christoffersen, Lars.

She is credited with being \\"the most famous female painter and calligrapher in the Chinese history...remembered not only as a talented woman, but also as a prominent figure in the history of bamboo painting.\\"Marsha Weidner, ed. Flowering in the Shadows: Women in the History of Chinese and Japanese Painting. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1990, p. 14. She is also a well-known poet in the Yuan dynasty. ==Life== She was born into a landed family in Huzhou, which is likely considered as a descendant of the high-ranking WuXing official Guan Zhong. Guan was an exception kids in her family and well educated in her youth, where she grew up on her family's ancestral lands, nicknamed \\"The Roost of the Esteemed.\\" Her father thought very highly of her, seeing her as an exceptional child as soon as she was born; hence the name Guan Daosheng, translating to \\"Way of Righteousness Rising as the Sun\\". https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and- maps/guan-daosheng-1262-1319 Guan was the wife of Zhao Mengfu, a renowned scholar-official and artist often considered the greatest artist of the earlier Yuan period. Guan and Zhao were married in 1286 and established a home in Wuxing \\"with the purchase of a town house with gardens in Huzhou, and a country retreat at Dongheng village near Deqing,\\"McCausland, Zhao Mengfu: Calligraphy and Painting for Khubilai's China. HK: Hong Kong University Press, 2011, p. 40. where they were later buried. Zhao was considered as the prosperity of the imperial Song (Sung) family but also served for the Yuan state bureaucracy. Guan‚Äôs father acknowledged Zhao as a suitable husband for his daughter due to Zhao's talent and social status. While married to Zhao, Guan gave birth to two sons and two daughters, who she raised alongside the one son and four daughters Zhao had with his previous wife, who died prior to his marriage to Guan. Because of Zhao's important position within the Yuan bureaucratic hierarchy, Guan was able to accompany him on long trips around the nation, a luxury most citizens, especially women, would not have enjoyed. She especially often joined him on trips between the northern capital at Dadu and the southern cultural center of Huangzhou. In the year of their marriage, they embarked on a three-year trip from their home in Wuxing to Dadu. In the year of 1279, Kublai Khan had finalizing the Mogol conquest and founded the Yuan Dynasty (1279-1368). In order to spiritually control over the Chinese, especially Han Chinese, Kublai had looked for the most talented Chinese scholars to serve for his royal court. Therefore, Zhao started his career at the highest offices of state, who was then honored not only as a great artist but also as ‚Äúa versatile man of letters‚Äù who recorded the emperor‚Äôs activities. Therefore, Zhao‚Äôs wife, Guan Daosheng, was also be able to display her talent to others and was honored as the talent lady. Accordingly, Guan's works finally been seen and honored. Both Guan Daosheng and her prominent husband Zhao Mengfu \\"harbored deep Chan Buddhist faith and enjoyed friendship with monks, such as their teacher Zhongfeng Mingben and others residing in the monasteries on the Tianmu Mountains, close to their homes in Wuxing and Deqing in northern Zhejiang....\\"McCausland, 17. Guan Daosheng died in 1319 at the age of 58 after a long illness. She died \\"on board the official boat in Shandong on the way home\\";McCausland, p. 104 her husband had sought permission to return due to his wife's illness. \\"The text of his letter informing [a relative] of her death and his painful journey home with her coffin, known as 'Zuimeng tie' ('Alcoholic delirium'), portrays a man devastated by the loss.\\"McCausland, p. 104 Because some of her husband's writings focused on his dislike of northern China's climate where they lived, \\"it may even [have] been that a meagre northern diet contributed to [her] death...possibly of beriberi brought on by malnutrition.\\"McCausland, p. 19. In the three years he lived after her death, it is said that he painted mainly bamboo, one of her favourite subjects, in her memory. Today, their \\"town house and garden in Huzhou, Lianhuazhuang, and their tomb in the country at Dongheng have been restored\\"McCausland, p. 7. and a small museum has been built in her husband's honour. ==Artistic career and style== Guan appears to have become active as a painter around 1296 and as a calligrapher in 1299. She was talented in calligraphy and painting ink bamboo and plum with delicate and elegant strokes. It is believed that she and her husband did paintings together.Osvald Siren. Chinese Painting, as quoted in Weidner, p. 97. The calligraphy of herself, her husband and one of their three sons, Zhao Yong, were collected in a scroll by the Yuan Emperor Ayurbarwada (better known as the Emperor Ren). He commented that it was a rare thing for a husband, wife and son to all be talented in calligraphy. \\"The imperial seal was applied to these works and they became part of the Imperial Archives collection.\\"Weidner, p. 59. The focus of Guan's work on bamboo painting is atypical for a female artist, as the subject was thought to be imbued with highly desirable masculine qualities, namely its ability to bend without breaking and greenness through the winter, symbolic of steadfast companionship. She is also believed to have depicted bodies of water alongside bamboo in her work in order to add more feminine associations to the plant. A bamboo scroll of hers from 1301 was found in her husband's studio, obviously showing her knowledge on the discourse surrounding bamboo being depicted by a woman; the scroll confidently stated: \\"To play with brush and ink is masculine sort of thing to do, yet I made this painting. Wouldn't someone say that I have transgressed? How despicable; how despicable.\\" Guan's paintings of bamboo garnered extensive praise, most notably among critics who noted their surprise at their strong, masculine brushstrokes that, according to such critics, did not betray the fact that a woman had made them. Praise such as this undoubtedly helped lead to Guan's 1317 reception of the title \\"Madam of the Wei Kingdom\\" from the imperial court in the capital. Indeed, some of Guan's works received the imperial seal of Emperor Renzong and his sister, Grand Princess Sengge Ragi, and were housed in the collection of the imperial archives. The greatest contribution of Guan Daosheng to the genre of bamboo painting was her tendency to paint it as part of a landscape, as opposed to isolated branches that were pressed close to the picture plane. As seen in Bamboo Groves in Mist and Rain, attributed to Guan, the bamboo itself is painted as part of the thickets in which it naturally grows, and it is seen as subject to the effects of the landscape and atmosphere in which it is located. This style followed the tradition of an artist of the early Yuan whose name goes unrecorded in China but who is called Tan Zhirui in Japan, where his paintings were brought by Chan Buddhist monks. The ink tonality does not vary much in these works by Guan, as the entirety of the subject matter is affected by the misty atmosphere in which it is portrayed.View from Jade Terrace, catalogue numbers 1, 2 and Cahill, p.190 She inscribed poems on her paintings and used a style of poetry that was used rarely by women. In her poems she shows concern for her husband and children, but does this in a humoristic way. When her husband once considered taking a concubine, and wrote a short poem assuring her that he was just contemplating what his friends were doing and she would still be the official wife, she wrote a short poem in response (\\"Song of You and Me\\") and left it where he could find it. The subject was reportedly never raised again and after her death, he did not remarry. It is likely that many of Guan's works were dedicated to high-ranking female patrons. Beyond her association with Sengge Ragi, it is known that Guan dedicated Bamboo Groves in Mist and Rain to a \\"Lady Chuguo.\\" By commonly directing her works to female recipients, Guan may have been promoting the influence of women at the imperial court.Purtle, Jennifer. \\"The Icon of the Woman Artist: Guan Daosheng (1262-1319) and the Power of Painting at the Ming Court c. 1500.\\" A Companion to Asian Art and Architecture. Rebecca M. Brown and Deborah S. Hutton, eds. Chichester: Wiley-Blackwell, 2011 == Poem == She wrote a poem \\"Song of Me and You\\" in response to her husband who wanted to have concubines which was very popular in China during that time, especially for those who worked in the government or high-ranking officers. In addition, she further wrote a poem called \\"Married Love\\" before her death. Her husband later found this piece of poem and decided not to marry a third time. In \\"Song of Me and You,\\" it reads, \\"You and I have so much love, that it burns like a fire [...]. In life we share a single quilt, in death we share a single coffin. ==Legacy== She is referred to \\"in the nineteenth century compilation of information on woman painters drawn from many earlier sources by T'ang Sou-yu, the wife of the Hangchow scholar and book collector Wang Yuan-sun\\"Weidner, p. 104 and is \\"one of the few women who is mentioned in early Western surveys of Chinese painting and whose work has been studied by modern Chinese scholars.\\"Ch'en Pao-chen, \\"Kuan Tao-sheng ho t'a te chu-shih t'u\\" (Kuan Tao-sheng and her painting of bamboo and rock), National Palace Museum Quarterly II, No. 4 (1977): 51-84 as quoted in Weidner, p. 14. Few of her paintings remain but one example in the National Palace Museum in Taipei is believed to have a \\"plausible claim to authenticity\\";McCausland, p. 281. it is a monochrome handscroll painted in 1308 entitled Bamboo Clumps in Mist and Rain. \\"Most of Guan Daosheng's scroll paintings appear to have been done for other women of roughly equal status-- either her relatives or the wives of her husband's colleagues....\\" After death, Daosheng's tombstone was marked the same as one who would be buried as a feudal lord, giving her high honor. In 2006, Guan's poetry served as the inspiration for a series of paintings by contemporary artist Au Hoi Lam, which were displayed at the Hong Kong Central Library in an exhibition entitled When Words are Sweet...Paintings by Au Hoi-lam. ==References== ==External links== *For a translation of Zhao Mengfu's poem, and Guan Daosheng's response entitled \\"Song of You and Me\\", see *Ink Bamboo by Guan Daosheng *For a translation of Guan Daosheng's poem titled \\"Married Love\\" http://yourdailypoem.com/listpoem.jsp?poem_id=268 Category:Chinese women poets Category:Yuan dynasty poets Category:Yuan dynasty calligraphers Category:Yuan dynasty painters Category:1319 deaths Category:1262 births Category:13th- century Chinese writers Category:14th-century Chinese writers Category:Writers from Huzhou Category:Painters from Zhejiang Category:Poets from Zhejiang Category:13th-century Chinese poets Category:14th-century Chinese poets Category:Chinese women painters Category:Women calligraphers Category:14th- century Chinese calligraphers Category:14th-century Chinese women writers Category:13th-century Chinese women writers Category:Buddhist artists ","title":"Guan Daosheng"},{"id":"11656671","text":"Alabama Territory's at-large congressional district was the congressional district for the Alabama Territory. == List of delegates representing the district == On March 3, 1817, the Alabama Territory was created.

DECs are designed to increase transparency about the energy efficiency of public buildings. The certificate looks similar to the energy labels provided on new cars and electrical appliances such as fridges and freezers ‚Äì it uses a similar scale for energy efficiency, i.e. from A to G with A being the most efficient and G the least. The aim of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive is for the public to receive energy information about a building they are visiting. In Ireland, the display of a DEC became mandatory for all public buildings over 1,000m¬≤ from 1 January, 2009. Since 9 July 2015, all public buildings in the UK over 250m¬≤ must display a DEC prominently at all times. Where the building has a total useful floor area of more than 1,000m¬≤, a UK DEC is valid for 12 months. The accompanying advisory report is valid for seven years. Where the building has a total useful floor area of between 250m¬≤ and 999m¬≤, the DEC and advisory report are valid for 10 years. DECs are not required in public buildings in Scotland. EPCs are used instead. DECs are designed to promote the improvement of the energy performance of buildings. The A3 sized certificate is valid for one year and is accompanied by an Advisory Report (AR) which is valid for seven years. The advisory report is designed to help building owners and occupiers to improve the energy efficiency of their buildings so that future DECs show a better rating. ARs do not need to be displayed, but must be available. DECs and ARs must be undertaken by an accredited energy assessors using approved software. In order to produce the DEC the energy assessor needs to know the gross internal floor area of the building and the operating hours together with actual meter readings or consignment notes for all fuels used during the year of assessment. It is, therefore, important for owners and occupiers of public buildings over 1,000m¬≤ to maintain good records of fuel used. If the energy assessor does not have access to suitable and sufficient information then a DEC cannot be produced. ==United Kingdom== The option to generate a default G rating was withdrawn in the UK on April 16, 2011. The penalty for each breach is ¬£500 for failing to display a DEC at all times in a prominent place clearly visible to the public and ¬£1,000 for failing to have possession of a valid advisory report. In addition to these penalties, it is still necessary to commission a DEC and an advisory report. In the future the Government is expected to extend the requirement for DECs large privately owned buildings which the public have access to, such as supermarkets.

The MHRI was active between 1956 and 2012, when it was merged with the Florey Neuroscience Institutes to form the Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health. Based in Melbourne, Victoria, the research efforts of the MHRI were focused on understanding schizophrenia, bipolar and major mood disorders, and Alzheimer's disease. == History == The Mental Health Research Institute was founded in 1956 as part of the Victorian Health Department. At that time the Institute specialised in common mental disorders in the community, with a focus on risk factors, prevention and appropriate treatment. The building was located close to the original Royal Park Hospital in . A working party established in 1983 recommended that a major expansion and re-organisation should take place. This resulted in more emphasis on neuroscience and the creation of a fully independent research organisation. In 1987 the Institute was incorporated in Victoria, and subsequently grew rapidly from an initial staff of three to over 100 staff prior to its merger. A modern neuroscientific research centre was completed in 1994 at a cost of 5.5 million. Prior to its merger, the Institute occupied a purpose built facility that houses clinical and research laboratories with strong molecular and in-vivo capabilities. Prior to its amalgamation, the MHRI was a fully accredited as an independent medical research institute by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and was affiliated with the University of Melbourne, the Royal Melbourne Hospital and Monash University. MHRI also promoted postgraduate psychiatry training through its association with the university sector. The Institute attracted competitive research funding from national and international sources and is internationally respected for its laboratory and clinical work. World leading researchers regularly visited MHRI as part of the Visiting Professors program. In 2012, with the amalgamation of the Mental Health Research Institute and the Florey Neuroscience Institutes, the Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health was formed. Research at the merged Florey Institute includes psychiatric conditions such as depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, and on neurodegenerative illnesses, particularly Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and Parkinson‚Äôs disease. ==References== == External links == * The Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health * One in Five Category:Defunct medical research institutes in Australia Category:2012 disestablishments in Australia Category:1956 establishments in Australia Category:Research institutes established in 1956 Category:Mental health in Australia ","title":"Mental Health Research Institute (Melbourne)"},{"id":"11656901","text":"Tins (Tins, ) is a 2007 film about a journalist who possesses information on uranium sales and is set up by his enemies and sent to prison. Initially the film was planned as a political thriller, but along the way it gained features of action with elements of mysticism and surrealism. The film is full of vivid pictures of spy and terrorist games in Moscow, modern Gulag in the Far North, gold mines, escape with elite spetsnaz in the pursuit, underground community of permanently high punks, and other quite unusual settings. The title, which literally translates as \\"Canned Food\\", has multiple meanings. One was introduced by Varlam Shalamov in his tales about Gulag, and it was called \\"calf\\" - a younger convict accepted to escape team for food, as a walking piece of meat. Another meaning is an interpretation of the film's idea: human beings are \\"sealed\\" structures that open only in extreme situations. The third meaning has to do with actual canned meat taken for escape: in the movie these cans play an important part because of their unexpected content. The film was shot in Crimea, Ukraine, where director Egor Konchalovsky had found locations for shootings of Siberian taiga, Ural mines and Moscow streets. He had transformed Inkerman quarries into the Ural prison camp. Marat Basharov, playing the journalist, had his head shaven for the role, and Sergey Shakurov, playing criminal boss or \\"thief in the law\\", had his body tattooed. ==Plot== Igor Davidov, an international journalist, possesses dangerous information about high-ranking traitors, including an Army General, a State Duma elected official and a well-known nuclear scientist who plan to sell weapon grade uranium to a Middle East country. The traitors realise that someone has leaked their plans. They trace the leak to Igor. Events turn nasty. The villainous General Astrahantsev kidnaps the children of loyal Commander Usoltsev, a veteran of the Chechnya war; the nuclear scientist is murdered. The conspirators succeed in framing Usoltsev and Davidov on charges of murder and drug dealing. Both men, who had not previously met, soon find themselves in a remote prison camp. They try to discover the real reasons for their being in prison. Then with the help of criminals they escape from the camp to seek justice.

The bureau is a division of the Office of the Attorney General. The KBI assists local law enforcement agencies with more mobile and criminal activity. In the early years, the crimes were often bank robberies. Today, the KBI‚Äôs main task is providing expertise and assistance to local law enforcement departments in handling criminal incidents. The KBI has also been given the authority to maintain the state‚Äôs criminal justice records. Years later, the KBI Forensic Science Laboratory was added to assist the criminal justice community in Kansas with forensic science services. The KBI was the primary agency involved in the murder investigation chronicled in Truman Capote's In Cold Blood as well as confirming the identity of the BTK Killer in Wichita.Welch, Larry.

A. Salvatore, the first book in the Transitions series. ==Plot summary== The story begins a century after the events of The Two Swords. Drizzt Do'Urden still wields Twinkle and Icingdeath and he now wields Taulmaril, Cattie-Brie's magical bow. Drizzt defeats a group of bandits calling themselves Casin Cu Calas, a group that wears black and travels through the Orcish Kingdom of Many-Arrows and slays Orcs in their sleep. He is angered when one of them mentions Bruenor Battlehammer's past weakness by allying with the Orcs. The sixth heir to the throne of Kingdom of Many-Arrows, Obould the Sixth, is visiting the house of a \\"beautiful\\" Orcish maiden who is set to marry an elf from the Glimmerwood (formerly Moonwood). The book then returns to the \\"past\\" where Drizzt, with his traveling companion Innovindil, are returning from the journey to the grave of Ellifan. A group of Orcish shaman start conspiring against Obould, and coax forth the Half Ogre-Half Orc Clan Karuck. Innovindil and the rest of her clan are attacked by Clan Karuck, where Innovindil and her Pegasus are slain. Hralien and his friend find her corpse in a tangle below a tree. Another drow, Tos'un and one of the instigators of the Orcish war, has been living in the area alone. Hralien begins hunting for Tos'un, believing him to have masterminded the ambush as it was too well organized to have been orcs. The real mastermind is a powerful Gnomish wizard named Jaculi, that has been trained by Illithids and other powerful creatures, who has been secretly controlling Clan Karuck's different Shaman for centuries. Back in Mithral Hall Drizzt accompanies Bruenor to a place they believe to be the ancient and lost dwarvern home of Gauntlgrym. With Regis and the dwarves Thibbledorf Pwent, Torgar Hammerstriker, and Cordio Muffinhead they enter, only to discover a cavern full of powerful, otherworldly monsters. Regis and Drizzt silently share doubts about this place being Gauntlgrym, upon seeing the buildings. The buildings look like ones you'd find above ground, and not under. After a vicious battle with two monsters from the Plane of Shadow, they enter into a massive building and find statues of Orcish and Dwarven scholars and tapestries of Orcs and Dwarves living together. A frustrated, dejected Bruenor takes several scrolls and heads home to Mithral Hall. Cattie-Brie and Wulfgar search for Colson, Wulfgar's surrogate daughter, and with the help of Alustriel, ruler of the city of Silverymoon, finds her in the town of Nesm√©. Once she is retrieved, Wulfgar leaves the Companions of the Hall to return her to her original home of Auckney and her birth mother, Meralda, before departing for Icewind Dale and the Tribe of the Elk. Cattie-Brie, saddened by Wulfgar's departure, returns to Mithral Hall with Alustriel. To avenge Innovindil's death, Hralien goes to find Drizzt in Mithral Hall and asks him to capture Tos'un Armgo. Tos'un also wields Khazid'hea, a sentient sword previously wielded by Catti-brie. Clan Karuck gathers up several tribes along the River Surbin and races towards dwarven and Silverymoon wizards as they finish construction on a bridge across the river. Several dwarves are slain in the nighttime battle as well as a very powerful wizard. After collecting the dead the next morning, Alustriel, who gave Catti-brie three wizardly items, promises to train Catti-brie in the Arts. After several days of work, Nanfoodle and Regis finally decipher the text on the scrolls. As it turns out, the language is a mixture of Dwarven and Orcish alphabets. According to the text, Dwarves and Orcs had lived together for centuries, and relations were continuing to improve. After gathering information from Regis, Nanfoodle determines that the only reason the city fell is because something melted the permafrost beneath the city, sucking the entire town and its population under. Drizzt departs Mithral Hall and eventually captures Tos'un. Bruenor, Regis, Hralien, Torgar Hammerstriker, Thibbledorf Pwent and Cordio Muffinhead track down Drizzt and together with a bound Tos'un they set out to kill King Obould Many-Arrows and end the war. Throughout the book Clan Karuck chieftain Grguch has made Obould's armies restless. Obould sends his Shaman to parlay with the dwarves, apologizing for the attacks and sends a messenger to Grguch. The runner sent to Mithral Hall is captured by treacherous Orcs, and the other messenger is slain by Grguch himself. Grguch, believing he is following the ways of Gruumsh, prepares an assault on Obould's encampment. As Bruenor and his group marches towards Obould, Drizzt and Hralien search for a way to prove Tos'un innocent. After hearing a discussion between two of the original conspirators proving Tos'un innocent, Drizzt heads off with Bruenor alone. Grguch and Obould are in a desperate battle, with Obould slowly gaining the upper hand until the Jack-possessed Karuck shaman, Hakuun, starts firing lightning bolts at Obould. Drizzt forces Bruenor to choose the destiny of the land and Bruenor leaps atop the back of Obould, and spring boards himself into Grguch. Drizzt runs after Hakuun and slays him and the shape shifting Jack. Bruenor is fighting a terrible battle with Grguch which ends with a disemboweled and headless Grguch. A battered Bruenor and dying Regis are brought before Obould. As Obould stares down at Bruenor, the Shaman messenger meant for the parlay heals Regis at Obould's command. Obould lowers his weapon and seemingly agrees to a parlay with Mithral Hall and the North. Hralien allows Tos'un to live in the Moonwood and the group returns home. In Garumn's Gorge, Bruenor and Obould sign a treaty, ending the war and establishing the Kingdom of Many-Arrows. Catti-brie takes on the enchanted robes of the wizard Jack and accepts the mentoring of Lady Alustriel and Nanfoodle. Back in the future, Hralien and Drizzt remain with the captured members of Casin Cu Calas. They discuss Tos'un and his elven wife Sinnifain and their children, the renaming of Moonwood, and the current state of the Orcish kingdom before they part ways once again. ==Reception== The Orc King was No. 8 on the fiction hardcover bestseller list as reported by The Buffalo News in October 2007.

This was the first of Benchley's 46 comedy short films, with six made for Fox, one each for Universal Pictures and RKO Radio Pictures, 29 for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and nine for Paramount Pictures.

A number of Round Tablers were contributing new material for the revue and Benchley wanted to do his part, but as often happened he procrastinated. According to fellow Round Tabler Donald Ogden Stewart, Benchley didn't start writing the sketch until about a week before the revue, and then only scribbled rough notes on the back of an envelope (Benchley would not commit a full script to paper until 1930Altman, p. 206).

When it was founded in 2007, it was attempting both consumer appliances as well as electric vehicle wireless charging, as made clear by their former CEO, Eric Giler, in 2009. Their vision of the future soon morphed into claims of wirelessly powering entire homes, including appliances, home computers, heating, lighting etc., simply by using giant transmitter coils embedded in the walls. They also were demonstrating drones being wirelessly charged using giant receiver coils placed between the feet of the drones, stating: \\"Drones, also known as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), offer a rich application space for WiTricity magnetic resonance technology, both for wireless charging of drones and for delivery of wireless charging by drones. This vision was emphasized in late 2014 by their current CEO, Alex Gruzen who stated \\"I'm confident that we'll see many Rezence-based products at CES this [coming] year, and with major powerhouse organizations, like Intel, licensing our technology and implementing it as part of the Rezence specification, we're excited to see our vision of a wireless world start to become a commercial reality in the next year.\\" It was not to be, and Intel abandoned its Rezence-based attempts in 2016, and by 2017, Rezence was over in effect, drones never took off, and wireless homes were clearly well out of reach. WiTricity announced layoffs as a result, and now focuses solely on wireless charging systems for electric vehicles (EVs). WiTricity uses resonant inductive coupling technology principle for power transfer. As explained on the WiTricity website, that approach invokes \\"coupled resonators\\"‚Äîcreated by tuning both the receiver and the transmitter independently to the same resonant frequency, in effect disregarding the effects of coupling when they are placed in close proximity. As also mentioned on the Wikipedia page for wireless power transfer, \\"a drawback of resonant coupling theory is that at close ranges when the two resonant circuits are tightly coupled, the resonant frequency of the system is no longer constant but splits into two resonant peaks, so the maximum power transfer no longer occurs at the original resonant frequency and the oscillator frequency must be re-tuned to the new resonance peak.\\" == History == The term WiTricity was used for a project that took place at MIT, led by Marin Soljaƒçiƒá in 2006. The MIT researchers successfully demonstrated the ability to power a 60 watt light bulb wirelessly, using two 5-turn copper coils of 60 cm (24 in) diameter, that were 2 m (7 ft) away, at roughly 45% efficiency. The coils were designed to resonate together at 9.9 MHz (wavelength ‚âà 30 m) and were oriented along the same axis. One was connected inductively to a power source, and the other one to a bulb. The setup powered the bulb on, even when the direct line of sight was blocked using a wooden panel. Researchers were able to power a 60 watt light bulb at roughly 90% efficiency at a distance of 3 feet. The research project was spun off into a private company, also called WiTricity. The emerging technology was demonstrated in July 2009 by CEO Eric Giler at the TED Global Conference held in Oxford. There he refers to the original idea, first applied by the physicist Nikola Tesla between his coils, and shows a WiTricity power unit powering a television as well as three different cell phones, the initial problem that inspired Soljacic to get involved with the project. It is however now being pointed out that the entire device was not being \\"powered wirelessly\\" as claimed or implied by Giler at 8 minutes and 50 seconds into the video. It is clear that only the charging icon appears, which typically only means the battery had started charging (at an unknown rate). WiTricity technology licensing agreements both in EV charging and consumer devices were announced over the course of several years with companies such as Toyota, Aptiv (formerly Delphi), Mahle, TDK, IHI Corporation, Shindengen, Daihen, BRUSA, and Anjie Wireless. Global corporate investors have included Toyota, Intel Capital, Delta Electronics Capital, Foxconn, Haier, and Schlumberger. Despite the huge investments for consumer devices and electric vehicles (EVs), the only consumer product ever released using WiTricity technology was the ill-fated 2-in-1 (tablet with detachable keyboard), the Dell Latitude 7285 in 2017. In EV charging, the only outcome was a leased version of the BMW530e, offering only 3.2 kW delivered wirelessly over 8 cm at 85% efficiency. This efficiency translates to almost half a kiloWatt of heat generated in the enclosed garage while charging. Interested users in USA are selected only from California, up to a maximum of 200 approved \\"testers\\" only, and only after passing an inspection of their homes and garage, which had to be enclosed. A huge investment into WiTricity, for EV charging was made by Toyota back in 2011. Prior to that, in 2010, Delphi had already announced they too were partnering with WiTricity for EV charging . Intel abandoned all efforts in bringing wireless charging to laptops back in 2016. Dell, one of the first partners of WiTricity, along with Foxconn, Haier, Delta and Schlumberger all effectively did the same by the end of 2017, after the solitary release of the Dell Latitude 7285 mentioned above. And neither Toyota or Aptiv (formerly Delphi), have had any visible success with EV charging, despite Toyota indicating EV wireless charging was coming soon back in 2014. The key competitor of WiTricity in EV charging, Qualcomm-Halo, had been announcing for long that their technology would be available in 2018 in the Mercedes S550e, but instead, in early 2019, Qualcomm-Halo sold its entire patent EV charging portfolio to WiTricity and effectively exited the business. To observers, the pattern was noticeably similar to the fate of Rezence (wireless charging standard) which was also started by Qualcomm, but they had by all accounts lost interest along the way, with no product to show, and WiTricity had rushed in to push the standard along till 2017, after which they focused on EV charging instead. In late 2012, the company announced it would make a $1000 demonstration kit available to interested parties, to promote development of commercial applications. The kit was intended to demonstrate the principle of \\"coupled resonators\\" to promote their foray into consumer appliances based on the now-defunct Rezence standard, and delivered barely 100 milliWatts at 250 kHz. In 2014, WiTricity said it already had a demonstration kit providing 3.3 kW, and their CEO Alex Gruzen said they were well on their way to creating a 6.6 kW kit. The datasheet for the 3.3 kW kit from 2014, claims a distance of 12-15 cm, and a \\"coil to coil\\" efficiency of \\"up to 97%.\\" It needs to be clarified that the definition of efficiency used by the MIT researchers was different from the usual definition based on input and output power, and so when they say \\"97%,\\" the actual efficiency number could be significantly off. MIT researchers were only referring to the energy estimated lost between the coils, which loss is actually considered negligible in all near-field inductive or resonant methods as opposed to radio-frequency based systems. This correction is further supported by the actual specifications of the 2018 leased version of the BMW530e based on WiTricity technology, which offers only 85% efficiency, over just 8 cm, as mentioned elsewhere on this page. By February 2014, WiTricity abandoned their original approach for consumer devices, based on 9.9MHz, which was the frequency originally used by the MIT researchers, which unfortunately stood absolutely no chance of ever getting regulatory approvals. They then joined the Alliance for Wireless Power, also known as A4WP or WiPower, to support the Rezence standard which was operating at the more reasonable and recognized ISM band frequency of 6.78MHz. Alex Gruzen was hired as CEO of WiTricity in April 2014. Till June 2010, he had served as Senior Vice President, Consumer Product Group at Dell, in which position he had been responsible for Dell's consumer desktop and notebook lines of business.. Alex got Witricity a design win at Dell, as announced in January 2017, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.https://www.barrons.com/articles/witricity-energous-were-shipping-deal- with-it-say-wireless-power-pioneers-1505418421 On closer examination, the Dell Latitude 7285, was not a usual laptop , but a 2-in-1‚Äîa tablet with a detachable keyboard, at an add-on cost of $549.99 for the Rezence-based wireless charging option. It was labeled a \\"hack\\" by The Verge. The Rezence standard was already considered imperiled when Intel abruptly abandoned it in June 2016, despite having invested heavily in WiTricity. The Dell Latitude 7285 was by all accounts a flop, and Alex Gruzen decided to take WiTricity out of the competition for powering consumer electronics, and focus on wireless power for electric vehicles, which had they had in fact been pursuing too, since 2007. The company has reportedly collaborated with car makers Audi, BMW, Chrysler, Jaguar, Nissan, and Toyota. In 2017, despite having raised $68 million to support both consumer appliances and EV charging, the company ordered layoffs, reducing its workforce from 80 to 55 and closing an office in Austin, Texas, all in an effort to reposition WiTricity to address the market opportunity around electric vehicles and directly contend with its biggest EV competitor, Qualcomm Halo. After years of R&D;, patent design and licensing with global automakers, 2018 saw the first EV with WiTricity‚Äôs technology hit the streets ‚Äì the BMW 530e iPerformance sedan, equipped with the first-ever wireless charging system . This delivered 3.2 kilowatts across 8 cm, with an efficiency of 85%, which indicates almost half a kilowatt of heat generated within the garage while charging. Building on this achievement, WiTricity was named a 2018 New Energy Pioneer by Bloomberg New Energy Finance and signed several new licensing deals including MAHLE in Germany and Anjie Wireless in China. However, despite the reported press release from WiTricity, there is no independent confirmation from Anjie Wirelesshttp://www.anjiewl.com/en/xinwenzhongxin/. The BMW530e wireless charging option was made available in USA in mid-2019, but on a very limited trial basis only. It was available under lease, only in California, and only for a maximum of 200 approved \\"testers\\" in USA. It was not for sale. Further, a third-party contractor Qmerit would need to first inspect the applicant's home before approving the lease under a pilot programhttps://www.qmerit.com/bmwwireless. It has also been reported that in fact only 9 cars have been equipped with this wireless charging feature, under the pilot program in USAhttps://www.mckennabmw.com/introducing-the- new-530e-wireless-charging-pilot-in-norwalk-ca.htm. In 2019, Honda partnered with WiTricity to demonstrate their wireless vehicle-to-grid (V2G) charging model at CES 2019 in Las Vegas, leveraging WiTricity‚Äôs DRIVE 11 wireless charging system.https://electriccarsreport.com/2018/12/honda-to-debut- wireless-v2g-system-at-ces-2019/ In February 2019, announced the acquisition from Qualcomm Incorporated and Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. of certain technology platform and IP assets, which will bring over 1,500 patents and patent applications related to wireless charging that WiTricity will own or control. Prior to the acquisition, Qualcomm Incorporated and WiTricity had been working collaboratively with global standards organizations, which currently leverage reference designs from each company. This acquisition will simplify ratification of the standard and help ensure interoperability across automakers. EV drivers will be able to use any standards-compatible wireless charging pad to power their vehicles. The EV charging portfolio sold off by Qualcomm in 2019, originally came from their 2011 acquisition of a New Zealand spin-out of the University of Auckland called HaloIPT. It is the same place from where the spin-out called PowerbyProxi later emerged, acquired by Apple in 2017, to supposedly create the now-canceled AirPower. By May 2020, WiTricity was announcing UL certification for Tier 1 licensees such as the Lumen Group. Despite the successes, privately, WiTricity applied for, and received, in May 2020, a COVID-19 forgivable Paycheck Protection Program loan of up to $2 million US dollars, claiming it was thereby saving 42 jobs{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/projects/ppp-business-loans/businesses/witricity- corporation. ==See also== * Electrosmog * Evanescent wave coupling * List of emerging technologies * Nikola Tesla * Qi (inductive power standard) -another standard for wireless energy transfers * Resonant energy transfer * WREL technology ==References== ==Reference articles== * ==External links== * * * Category:Energy development Category:Electric power distribution Category:Wireless energy transfer ","title":"WiTricity"},{"id":"11657104","text":"Clifford D.

Acting as an X-Files for the younger crowd, the series took a darker tone than other Disney Channel Originals. The third and final season, Disney replaced Cara DeLizia (due to her wanting to pursue future projects outside of Disney) with actress Alexz Johnson playing Annie Thelen.

Despite the uncertain status of the region, political leaders met in September 1849, and elected Hugh N. Smith as its Congressional delegate. Smith presented his credentials to Congress on February 4, 1850, but the House refused to seat him, ruling that no territorial government existed and no authority to elect a delegate had been granted. == List of delegates representing the district == On September 9, 1850, following the passage of the Compromise of 1850, New Mexico Territory was officially created by an act of Congress and was given the authority to elect a delegate. {| class=wikitable style=\\"text- align:center\\" |- style=\\"height:3em\\" !

He is the head men's basketball coach at the University of Northern Iowa, a position he has held since 2006. He served as an assistant at North Dakota, North Dakota State, and Northern Iowa before taking over as head coach at Northern Iowa in 2006. ==Playing career== Jacobson attended Mayville-Portland high school. After his senior year he was named 1989's North Dakota Mr. Basketball. Jacobson went on to play collegiately at the University of North Dakota from 1989 to 1993. He was a four-year letterman for the Sioux, a two- year starter, and he ended his career as the school's all-time assist leader. UND made two Division 2 Elite Eight appearances and four regional appearances, along with winning two conference championships, during his career. He was team captain in 1991-92 and 1992‚Äì93, was named to the NCC's All-Academic Team in 1993, and was a player representative to UND's letterwinner's association from 1991-93. ==Coaching career== Jacobson's biggest coaching accomplishment was in 2009‚Äì10, when the Panthers made a run into the Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA Tournament highlighted by an upset of top national seed Kansas. ESPN.com columnist Pat Forde called the Panthers' win \\"the biggest tourney upset in years,\\" and called the clinching shot by Panthers guard Ali Farokhmanesh \\"the greatest early-round shot in NCAA tournament history.\\" In March 2010, Jacobson signed a 10-year extension with UNI. The contract guarantees the coach $450,000 a year with annual increases of $25,000 through the length of the contract. In the 2010-11 season, Jacobson led the Panthers to their eighth consecutive 18-plus win season, third straight postseason bid and a Valley- leading third straight 20-plus win season. Prior to that stretch of eight straight seasons, UNI had tallied only six 18-plus win seasons in the history of its program. Jacobson also coached UNI as it became the first college program ever to represent the United States of America at an international basketball competition. In August 2007, UNI was chosen to be Team USA at the World University Games in Bangkok, Thailand. Donning the Red, White and Blue, UNI went 5-1 in the tournament, losing only to eventual gold medalist Lithuania, while posting wins over Angola, Turkey, China, Finland and Israel. Jacobson finished his first campaign at the helm of UNI with an 18-13 record. The 18 wins were the most for a first-year Panther head coach since the team joined the Division I ranks in 1980. In addition, UNI posted wins over Iowa State and Iowa - sweeping the Cyclones and Hawkeyes in the same season for just the second time ever - including posting a win in Iowa City for the first time in program history. Before taking over as head coach, Jacobson was the Panthers' top assistant coach starting in 2001, and was a key cog in bringing the Panthers from the basement of the Missouri Valley Conference to the penthouse. With Jacobson on staff, the development of UNI basketball has been remarkable. UNI has also advanced to the NCAA tournament seven times (2004, 2005, 2006, 2009, 2010, 2015, and 2016), including receiving two at-large bids. UNI also achieved its first-ever Division I top-25 ranking during the 2005-06 season. On November 15, 2014, Jacobson became the all-time win leader for a coach in UNI Men's basketball history. After recording a win over his alma mater University of North Dakota, he notched his 167th UNI victory. In the 2014-15 season, Jacobson led the Panthers to their highest ranking in school history (#10) in the AP and (#9) in the Coaches Poll. UNI also in that season achieved the most wins in the school's history with 31. After that season Jacobson, was given a 10-year extension with an average of $900,000 per year through 2024-25. On November 21, 2015, Jacobson led UNI to a victory over #1 North Carolina. The win was one of the biggest in program history and came in just the first meeting of the two basketball programs. The Panthers are 2-0 vs AP #1 ranked teams in program history. Just four days later the coach hit another career milestone. After defeating the University of Dubuque in convincing fashion, the coach recorded his 200th victory at the university. Nearly three weeks after achieving the 200th victory, UNI stunned #5 ranked Iowa State in the Big Four Classic in Des Moines, IA. On March 6, 2016, UNI won its fourth MVC tournament under Jacobson. In the first round of the MVC tournament, Jacobson notched his 250th Northern Iowa career win against Evansville on March 1, 2018. On March 5, 2020, Jacobson was named MVC coach of the year. ==Head coaching record== ==References== ==External links== * Northern Iowa profile Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:American men's basketball coaches Category:American men's basketball players Category:Basketball coaches from North Dakota Category:Basketball players from North Dakota Category:Maccabiah Games basketball players of the United States Category:North Dakota Fighting Hawks men's basketball coaches Category:North Dakota Fighting Hawks men's basketball players Category:North Dakota State Bison men's basketball coaches Category:Northern Iowa Panthers men's basketball coaches Category:People from Traill County, North Dakota Category:Guards (basketball) ","title":"Ben Jacobson"},{"id":"11657442","text":"Broadgate is an area in the northeast of the City of London: Broadgate may also refer to: *Broadgate, East Riding of Yorkshire, England *Broadgate, Hampshire, England *Broadgate, the area in the centre of Coventry (England) *Broadgate, a street in the centre of Lincoln, Lincolnshire, England (part of the A15) *Broadgate, Lancashire, an area of Preston, Lancashire, England *Broadgate, a road in Beeston, Nottinghamshire **Broadgate Park, on the Beeston/Nottingham border ==See also== * Bradgate (disambiguation) ","title":"Broadgate (disambiguation)"},{"id":"11657487","text":"Wausau West High School is a public high school serving students in grades 9 to 12 of the Wausau School District. It was built in 1970 on the west side of the city of Wausau, Wisconsin to accommodate the growing city population. Its enrollment is approximately 1,775. Its rival school is Wausau East High School. == History == The first high school in Wausau was built in 1889 and later replaced by a larger building, Wausau High School, in 1898. By the mid-20th century the school was beginning to become overcrowded. This was exacerbated by a state law passed in the early 1960s that integrated schools from surrounding areas into the Wausau School District. By the end of the decade, the school district decided to build a second high school on the west side, and in 1970 Wausau's second high school opened its doors. Wausau High School was renamed Wausau East High School, and the new building on the west side of Wausau became Wausau West High School.D.C. Everest Oral History Project. Local Voices: Stories of Wausau - Past and Present. Weston, WI: D.C. Everest Area Schools, 2006, pp. 518-520. == Extracurricular activities == West provides extracurricular programs in the performing arts, athletics and academics (Science Olympiad). ===Performing arts=== West's drama program has performed musical and non-musical shows, such as \\"Little Shop of Horrors\\" (Fall 1995), \\"The Music Man\\" (1988), Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, Grease, Singin' in the Rain, Cinderella, \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\" (Spring 1993), \\"As You Like It\\" (Spring 1994), \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" (Spring 1995), \\"The Orange Splot\\" (Spring 1996) and others. The drama program participates in the Central Wisconsin Educational Theatre Alliance, a group of local high school drama teachers and students that presents more challenging productions. With funding from grants, community donations, and the profits from past performances, the organization is able to produce plays and musicals on a larger scale than is possible at the high school level. Past shows include Peter Pan, Cats, Les Mis√©rables, Romeo and Juliet, and The Phantom of the Opera. ===Music=== The school music department teaches choral music, orchestra, and band. There are four choirs: freshmen, men's choir, women's choir, and concert chorale, and a select group from concert chorale known as master singers. The choral music program has been producing Pop Concert in the spring for over four decades. This revue of pop, rock, country, and Broadway music from all periods was shown on Wisconsin Public Television in 2014. Bandstock, a fall production of the band program and some of the choirs, is a performance with a professional rock band and light show. === Sports === Wausau West High School is in the WIAA Division 1 bracket. A school rivalry exists between the two Wausau High Schools, East and West, who both compete in the Wisconsin Valley Conference. During the \\"Log Game\\", the annual football game between the two schools, the schools play for possession of the traditional log. (The concept of the \\"log\\" comes from the fact that Wausau was once an important logging center.) The boys' soccer teams compete for the Wausau Rock each fall. The two schools also compete in ice hockey for possession of the Kuehlman Cup. The teams also compete, along with Mosinee and D.C. Everest, for the Marathon Cup in ice hockey.

Originating in Moscow and then Paris, and directed by Nikita Balieff, the revue toured the United States, Europe, and South Africa. The show consisted of songs, dances, and sketches, most of which had been originally performed in Russia. The revue was enormously successful in the U.S., and one of its legacies is the popularization of the jaunty tune The Parade of the Wooden Soldiers by Leon Jessel. ==Early production history in Moscow, Paris, and London== In 1906, Armenian actor Nikita Balieff moved to Moscow, and took a job at the Moscow Art Theatre under Constantin Stanislavski. After years of only non-speaking roles, and with a desire to perform comedy rather than drama, Balieff, along with theatre devotee Nikolai Tarasov, co-created his own theatre group in a basement near the Moscow Art Theatre. He named the cabaret and troupe The Bat, after a well-known cabaret in Vienna called Fledermaus. The Bat enjoyed much success and popularity in Moscow, until the Russian Revolution in 1917. Balieff then went into exile in western Europe, and began presenting vaudeville shows there with other Russian √©migr√©s. La Chauve-Souris opened in Paris in December 1920. The spectacle was noticed by the British theatrical producer Charles B. Cochran, who brought Balieff and his troupe and show to London. ==In the United States== In 1922 La Chauve-Souris made its first tour to America, through an arrangement with the producer Morris Gest. La Chauve Souris performed on Broadway from February 1922 to June 1922 (153 performances) and January 1925 to March 1925 (61 performances) in productions produced by F. Ray Comstock and Morris Gest. Balieff and his company also toured from Washington, D.C. to California for 65 consecutive weeks. Between 1922 and 1929, Balieff returned to America to tour six times, appearing on Broadway in 1922, 1923, 1925, 1927, and 1929, with one final show billed as New Chauve-Souris in 1931. In 1927 Balieff was featured on the cover of Time magazine.Balieff's 1927 Time magazine cover The shows consisted of songs, dances, and sketches, most of which had been originally performed in Russia. Balieff, as master of ceremonies for the show, was known for his feigned lack of English on stage. His monologues and introductions were delivered in a mix of Russian, French, and English language and slang coupled with much gesticulation. However, in private Balieff's English was better than that of his stage persona. The Rockettes' annual \\"Parade of the Wooden Soldiers\\" mimics the original Chauve-Souris choreography. One of La Chauve-Souris's most popular acts, The Parade of the Wooden Soldiers, which used the delightful Leon Jessel tune \\"Die Parade der Zinnsoldaten\\" (\\"The Parade of the Tin Soldiers\\"), referenced a story regarding Tsar Paul I. The legend claims the Tsar left his parade grounds without issuing a \\"halt\\" order to the marching soldiers. Without one, the soldiers marched to Siberia before being remembered and ordered back. The Balieff vaudeville version with its popular tune was a mainstay in Chauve-Souris, and later became part of The Rockettes repertoire as well in their Radio City Christmas Spectacular. The Chauve-Souris \\"Parade of the Wooden Soldiers\\" was also filmed, and premiered on April 15, 1923 at the Rivoli Theater. La Chauve-Souris also toured Europe and South Africa, appearing in major capital cities. In 1934 Balieff created a new Chauve-Souris production, which proved to be his last theatrical venture. ==Phonograph records== Several recordings were made of Sauve-Chouris numbers. Part of the La Chauve-Souris revue was recorded by British Columbia Graphophone Company, AX 2717, 2719 - 9220, speed 80 rpm, under the title Chauves Souris: * Side A: \\"Round the Hay Wain\\" * Side B: \\"A Russian Barcarole\\" In Russian.

The film, shown under the title Parade of the Wooden Soldiers with two-color Technicolor sequences, is now in the Maurice Zouary collection of the Library of Congress.SilentEra entry ==Parody== La Chauve-Souris inspired a parody called No Sirree! (subtitled \\"An Anonymous Entertainment by the Vicious Circle of the Hotel Algonquin\\"), written and performed by Robert Benchley and other members of the Algonquin Round Table for one night only in April 1922. No Sirree! had its genesis at the studio of Neysa McMein, which served as something of a salon for Round Tablers away from the Algonquin Hotel. Acts included: \\"Opening Chorus\\" featuring Alexander Woollcott, John Peter Toohey, George S. Kaufman, Marc Connelly, Franklin P. Adams, and Benchley, with violinist Jascha Heifetz providing offstage, off-key accompaniment; \\"He Who Gets Flapped,\\" a musical number featuring the song \\"The Everlastin' Ingenue Blues\\" written by Dorothy Parker and performed by Robert E.

It is anchored by Burlington Coat Factory, Home Depot, Ross, Safeway, T.J. Maxx, and Walgreens. ==History== Aerial view of northern San Francisco Peninsula, facing northeast; Westlake Shopping Center is visible in the middle-right part of the photograph In 1945, developer Henry Doelger purchased of land in San Mateo County just south of San Francisco; the tracts had previously been used for hog and cabbage farming. Over the next twenty years, Doelger would go on to develop the area into the Westlake neighborhood of Daly City, including the shopping center, originally named Westlake Town & Country Shopping Center, in the center of the tract. Doelger broke ground on the Westlake development in 1949; the groundbreaking ceremony for the shopping center was held in March 1949. The uniform appearance of the planned community (notorious for its racial restrictions) inspired singer Malvina Reynolds to write the song \\"Little Boxes\\" in 1962. Westlake opened on April 20, 1951, making it one of the earliest malls in America; at the time, its 3,000-car parking area was the largest in America. It was also the first community shopping center in the Bay Area. Its open-air pedestrian promenades allowed the center to be used for outdoor concerts, art shows, fairs, dances, and other community events for many years. Doelger sold the Westlake Shopping Center in 1965. Westlake was subsequently purchased by the Westlake Development Company in 1972, who later sold it to its current owners, Kimco Realty Corporation, on October 22, 2002. In 2017 Kimco announced plans to add apartments above ground-level retail at Westlake. Under those plans, a 6-story mixed-use building with 179 apartments on the upper floors would replace an existing 2-story commercial building and a 60-space parking lot; underground parking would be provided for 260 cars. The proposed mixed-use building would replace the existing northeast corner of the Westlake site, near the intersection of John Daly Boulevard and Park Plaza Drive. The developer has received permission for this plan. In 2018, it was announced that Kimco has plans to work to develop in housing at Daly City.https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2018/09/07/daly-city- shopping-center-could-bag-some-housing.html ==Design== Aerial view of Westlake Shopping Center from north, with Trader Joe's on left and Home Depot on right.

It is built on the Black Volta river at the Bui Gorge, at the southern end of Bui National Park. The project is a collaboration between the government of Ghana and Sino Hydro, a Chinese construction company. Construction on the main dam began in December 2009. Its first generator was commissioned on 3 May 2013,http://www.modernghana.com/news/462096/1/president-mahama-inaugurates- the-bui-hydro-electri.html President Mahama Inaugurates the Bui Hydroelectricity Project retrieved 2013 June 5 and the dam was inaugurated in December of the same year. Bui will be the second largest hydroelectric generating plant in the country after the Akosombo Dam. The reservoir flooded about 20% of the Bui National Park and impacts the habitats for the rare black hippopotamus as well as a large number of wildlife species. It required the resettlement of 1,216 people, and affected many more. == History == The Bui hydro-electric dam had first been envisaged in 1925 by the British-Australian geologist and naturalist Albert Ernest Kitson when he visited the Bui Gorge. The dam had been on the drawing board since the 1960s, when Ghana's largest dam, the Akosombo Dam, was built further downstream on the Volta River. By 1978 planning for the Bui Dam was advanced with support from Australia and the World Bank. However, four military coups stalled the plans. At the time Ghana began to be plagued by energy rationing, which has persisted since then. In 1992, the project was revived and a first feasibility study was conducted by the French firm Coyne et Bellier.Oliver Hensengerth:Interaction of Chinese Institutions with Host Governments in Dam Construction:The Bui dam in Ghana , German Development Institute, Discussion Paper 3/2011, p. 9-13, retrieved on May 7, 2011 (full version not available on-line) Construction of the dam In 1997 a team of students from Aberdeen University carried out ecological investigations in the area to be flooded by the reservoir. The Ghanaian environmental journalist Mike Anane,Global 500 Forum:Adult Award Winner in 1998: Mike Anane , retrieved on May 9, 2011 who was included in UNEP‚Äôs Global 500 Roll of Honour for 1998, called the dam an \\"environmental disaster\\" and a \\"text book example of wasted taxpayer money\\". In his article he quoted the investigation team, but apparently somewhat exaggerated the environmental impact of the dam. The leader of the investigation team, the zoologist Daniel Bennett, clarified that \\"the opinions (Anane) attributes to our team are unfair and misleading\\". He continued to say that \\"Contrary to Mr Anane's claims, we are unaware of any globally endangered species in Bui National Park, nor did we claim that the dam would destroy the spawning runs of fish.\\"Daniel Bennett, Aberdeen University Black Volta Project, letter to newspaper editor re. articles about Bui Dam, 8 November 1999, retrieved on May 9, 2011 Although Daniel Bennett always maintained a neutral stance towards the construction of the dam, in April 2001 the government of Ghana banned him from doing further research on the ecology of the Bui National Park. The government stated that the issue was \\"very sensitive\\" and Bennett's \\"presence in the National Park was no longer in the national interest\\". One of the journalist who criticized the government for banning Bennett was Mike Anane. In 1999 the Volta River Authority, the country's power utility, signed an agreement with the US firms Halliburton and Brown and Root to build the dam without issuing a competitive bid. In December 2000 President Jerry Rawlings, who had ruled the country for the two previous decades, did not contest in elections (as per the constitution) and his party lost to the opposition led by John Kufuor. In October 2001 the new government shelved the dam project. According to Charles Wereko-Brobby, then President of the Volta River Authority, Bui Dam was not considered the least‚Äìcost option and could not meet \\"immediate\\" energy needs. Instead gas-powered thermal power plants were to be built, producing electricity at what was said to be half the cost of Bui. Furthermore, a severe drought in 1998 exacerbated the energy crisis due to low water levels in Akosombo Dam. As a consequence, the government wanted to reduce its dependence on hydropower at the time. However, in 2002 the project was revived. An international call for tender was issued, but only a single company submitted a bid and the tender was cancelled. In 2005 the Chinese company Sinohydro submitted an unsolicited bid for the dam together with funding from the Chinese Exim Bank. The government accepted the bid and the Ministry of Energy signed contracts for an environmental impact assessment in December 2005, as well as for an updated feasibility study in October 2007. The government created the Bui Power Authority in August 2007 to oversee the construction and operation of the project and the associated resettlement. Responsibility for the dam was thus transferred from the Volta River Authority, which until then had been responsible for the development and operation of all power projects in Ghana. Coyne et Bellier is the consulting engineer for the dam. Field investigations for the dam began in October 2007. In January 2008 preparatory construction began and in May 2008 the first people were resettled. In December 2008 the river was diverted and a year later construction on the main part of the dam began. The filling of the reservoir began in June 2011.Bui Power Authority:Project Milestones and Completion Schedule , Retrieved on May 7, 2011 Unit 3 was connected to the grid on 3 May 2013; Units 2 and 1 were commissioned by the end of November 2013. The dam and power station were inaugurated in December 2013 by President John Mahama. ==Design== The Bui Dam is a gravity roller-compacted concrete-type with a height of above foundation and above the riverbed. The crest of the dam is meters long and sits at an elevation of above sea level (ASL). The main dam's structural volume is . Southwest of the dam two saddle (or auxiliary) dams maintain pool levels and prevent spillage into other areas of the basin. The first and closest to the main dam is Saddle Dam 1. It is southwest of the main dam and is a rock-fill embankment dam. The dam rises above ground level and has a crest length of . southwest of the main dam is Saddle Dam 2. This dam is a zoned earth-fill type with a height of ASL and a crest length of . Both saddle dams have a crest elevation of ASL. Bui Dam, Ghana in November 2013 shortly before official opening. Looking upstream, approximately north-east. Powerhouse at right, with three orange penstocks visible above the roof (one for each generator). Spillway has five bays. The penstock for the future house unit is visible at the left. The dam crest is about 75 metres above the powerhouse main floor. Powerhouse paved road under construction visible in foreground. Telpher construction crane supported by cables has not yet been removed. The dam's spillway near the right bank consists of five radial gates, each wide. The spillway sits at an elevation of and has a maximum discharge of which correlates to a 1-in-10,000 year flood. The dam's outlet works consist of a single outlet on the right bank converted from one of the diversion tunnels. ==Reservoir== The reservoir that the main and saddle dams create will have a maximum capacity of of which is useful for power generation and irrigation. The reservoir's maximum operating level will be ASL and the minimum ASL. At the maximum level, the reservoir will have a surface area of while the at minimum it will be . The reservoir's volume at minimum level is . The average length of the reservoir will be with an average depth of and a maximum . ==Bui Hydropower Plant== Just downstream of the dam on the left bank is the dam's powerhouse. The intake at the reservoir feeds water through three penstocks to the three separate 133 MW Francis turbine-generators. Each turbine-generator has a step-up transformer to increase the voltage to transmission level. A fourth unit, with a penstock on the spillway, will provide four megawatts for station service and black start power, and will provide minimum flow to maintain river levels if the main units should be shut down. The power station will have an installed capacity of 400 megawatts and an estimated average annual generation of . The power station's switchyard is located downstream. Four 161 kV transmission lines connect the substation to the Ghana grid.Bui Power Authority:Bui Hydroelectric Project:Project Features , retrieved on May 7, 2011 ==Benefits== The Bui hydropower plant will increase the installed electricity generation capacity in Ghana by 22%, up from 1920 MW in 2008 to 2360 MW. Together with three thermal power plants that are being developed at the same time, it will contribute to alleviate power shortages that are common in Ghana. Like any hydropower plants, the project avoids greenhouse gas emissions that would have occurred if thermal power plants had been built instead. An additional expected benefit is the irrigation of high-yield crops on 30,000 hectares of fertile land in an \\"Economic Free Zone\\".Bui Power Authority:Bui Hydroelectric Project:Bui Irrigation Project , retrieved on May 7, 2011 The current status of the irrigation project is unclear. ==Cost and financing== The total project costs are estimated to be US$622 million. It is being financed by the government of Ghana's own resources (US$60m) and two credits by the China Exim Bank: a concessional loan of US$270 million at 2% interest and a commercial loan of US$292 million. Both loans have a grace period of five years and an amortization period of 20 years. The proceeds of 30,000 tons per year of Ghanaian cocoa exports to China, which are placed in an escrow account at the Exim Bank, serve as collateral for the loan. Once the dam becomes operational, 85% of the proceeds of electricity sales from the hydropower plant will go to the escrow account. If not all the proceeds are needed to service the loan, the remainder reverts to the government of Ghana.Oliver Hensengerth:Interaction of Chinese Institutions with Host Governments in Dam Construction:The Bui dam in Ghana , German Development Institute, Discussion Paper 3/2011, p. 37f., retrieved on May 7, 2011 (full version not available on-line) == Environmental and social impact == The reservoir behind the Bui Dam started to fill up in 2011 An Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) for the dam was completed in January 2007 by the US consulting firm Environmental Resources Management (ERM).Environmental Resources Management (ERM):Environmental and Social Impact Assessment of the Bui Hydropower Project , Final Report, January 2007, retrieved on May 7, 2011, posted on the website of the Regional Dialogue on large hydraulic infrastructures in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) During its preparation hearings were held in Accra and in five localities near the project area, such as Bamboi. However, no hearings were conducted in the project area itself. Once completed, an independent panel appointed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of Ghana reviewed the ESIA. The latter was revised in the important aspects, including the following: \\"compensation\\" had to be provided for the inundated area of Bui National Park, a \\"rescue plan\\" for the hippos was required and it had to be specified how resettlement would be carried out. When the EPA issued the environmental permit for the dam, it required the Bui Power Authority to present within 18 months an Environmental Management Plan based on the revised ESIA. Construction and resettlement began in 2008, but no environmental management plan had been submitted as of July 2010.Oliver Hensengerth:Interaction of Chinese Institutions with Host Governments in Dam Construction:The Bui dam in Ghana, German Development Institute, Discussion Paper 3/2011, p. 22-24, retrieved on May 7, 2011 (full version not available on-line) === Environmental impact === The Bui National Park will be significantly affected by the Bui Dam. 21% of the park will be submerged. This will affect the only two populations of black hippopotamus in Ghana, whose population is estimated at between 250 and 350 in the park.Bennett, D. and B. Basuglo.D. 1998. Final Report of the Aberdeen University Black Volta Expedition 1997. Viper Press, Aberdeen, Scotland. It is unclear if hippos can be relocated and if there is any suitable habitat near the area to be inundated. Even if there were such a \\"safe haven\\", it is not clear if the country's game and wildlife department has the means to rescue the animals. The Environmental and Social Impact Assessment states that hippos will be vulnerable to hunting during the filling period of the reservoir. It also claims that they would ultimately \\"benefit from the increased area of littoral habitat provided by the reservoir\\". The dam could also have other serious environmental impacts, such as changing the flow regime of the river which could harm downstream habitats. A survey by the University of Aberdeen has revealed that the Black Volta River abounds with 46 species of fish from 17 families. None of these species is endangered. Nevertheless, these fish communities could be severely impacted by changes to water temperature, turbidity and the blocking of their migration. Waterborne disease could also occur. Schistosomiasis in particular could become established in the reservoir, with severe health risks for local people. === Social impact === The Bui dam project requires the forced relocation of 1,216 people, of which 217 have been resettled as of June 2010.Bui Power Authority:Background of the Bui Resettlement , retrieved on May 7, 2011 In order not to slow down the construction of the dam, the Bui Power Authority has opted for a quick resettlement process. It neglected the recommendations of a study, the \\"Resettlement Planning Framework\\", that it had contracted itself. In theory, all affected people are expected to be moved to a new locality called Bui City. However, as of 2010 the city does not exist and there is not even a schedule for its construction. Instead, the first 217 relocated people have been moved to a temporary settlement called Gyama Resettlement Township, which has dilapidated infrastructure. Fishers were resettled on dry land and lost their livelihoods. Although the study had recommended to establish an independent body to monitor the resettlement, no such body has been set up.Oliver Hensengerth:Interaction of Chinese Institutions with Host Governments in Dam Construction:The Bui dam in Ghana , German Development Institute, Discussion Paper 3/2011, p. 27-33 and p. 43, retrieved on May 7, 2011 (full version not available on-line) ==See also== * List of power stations in Ghana * Electricity sector in Ghana ==References== Category:Dams in Ghana Category:Gravity dams Category:Roller-compacted concrete dams Category:Dams completed in 2013 Category:2013 establishments in Ghana Category:Dams on the Volta River ","title":"Bui Dam"},{"id":"11657734","text":"A slicer is an effects unit which is similar to a vibrato, phaser, or autopan.

Sanderling, Minesweeper No. 37, was laid down on 27 May 1918 at the Tebo Yacht Basin by the Todd Shipbuilding Co., New York City; launched on 2 September 1918; and commissioned on 4 December 1918, Lieutenant Stanley Danielak in command. ==World War I mine clearance== Commissioned after the end of World War I, Sanderling conducted exercises and performed miscellaneous towing operations out of Tompkinsville, New York, through January and February 1919. In March, she proceeded to Boston, Massachusetts, whence she sailed on 14 April for the Orkney Islands to join in the postwar sweeping operations to clear the North Sea for peacetime shipping. On the 29th, the day she arrived at Kirkwall, the first sweeping operation in the American-laid fields began. Experimental in nature, that sweep disposed of only 221 mines and put hardly a dent in the barrage which had been stretched from Orkney to Norway to stop German submarine traffic from going into the Atlantic Ocean. The six following sweeps used different methods, improved equipment, and more ships ‚Äî including Sanderling. These modified operations proved to be more productive. During the third operation, in June, Sanderling and , operating together, located a sunken U-boat. The submarine, probably , fouled their sweep gear, almost stopping the two ships, and sent oil to the surface. Sweeping operations were soon resumed and continued more \\"routinely,\\" if hazardously, for Sanderling until the sixth operation in August and early September. Influenza struck the mine force as it worked the eastern end of the barrage. Soon thereafter, Sanderling was damaged by an upper level countermine. Repairs, however, were effected quickly, and the ship was ready to return to sea as the final clearance sweeps were conducted. ==Return to East Coast operations== By 1 October, the North Sea Mine Barrage, originally a concentration of over 70,000 British and American mines, had been swept; and Sanderling headed home. Moving south, then west, she returned to Tompkinsville, New York on 19 November. On the 25th, the North Sea Mine Force was disbanded, and Sanderling proceeded to Charleston, South Carolina for an extended overhaul. ==West Coast operations== Designated AM-37 on 17 July 1920, she departed the South Carolina coast on 3 August; moved up to Norfolk, Virginia; and on the 31st sailed for California. She conducted exercises en route; arrived at San Diego, California on 28 October; and remained in Californian waters until January 1921. She then proceeded west, arriving on the 21st at her new home port, Pearl Harbor. ==Deactivation and accidental sinking== Sanderling remained active only until 11 May, when she was placed in reduced commission. A year later, on 2 May 1922, she was decommissioned and berthed with the reserve fleet at Pearl Harbor. On 26 June 1937, while still in reserve, the minesweeper accidentally sank. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register, effective on the day of her loss. ==References== ==External links== * *uboat.net - USS Sanderling Category:Lapwing-class minesweepers Category:Ships built in New York City Category:Shipwrecks in the Pacific Ocean Category:Maritime incidents in 1937 Category:1918 ships Category:World War I minesweepers of the United States ","title":"USS Sanderling (AM-37)"},{"id":"11657781","text":"How to Behave is a short film released through MGM Studios starring Robert Benchley.

Though it was designed for a clean sound, its overdriven sound is praised by players and critics. ==History== The Super evolved from the so-called Dual Professional, \\"often cited as the world's first twin-speaker amplifier,\\" which was introduced in 1947. The Dual Professional had two slightly angled 10\\" Jensen speakers, and had two 6L6 tubes producing 18 watts. It was renamed the Super in the fall of 1947. The amplifier's circuit was changed in 1955 (until then it was identical to the Fender Pro, except for the speaker configuration) when the 6L6 tubes were exchanged for 6V6 tubes; the 1958 5F4 model was again equipped with 6L6 tubes, so its circuitry was again almost identical to that of the Pro (5E5-A model) and the Bandmaster (5E7 model). The 5F4 model had Presence, Bass, and Treble controls, and separate Volume controls for the microphone and instrument inputs. It used 12AY7 pre-amplifier tubes for \\"more clarity and headroom\\" than a 12AX7 would. A fixed-bias output stage and split-phase inverters helped the Super overdrive more quickly than the Fender Bassman and produce a sound that, according to Vintage Guitar's Dave Hunter, \\"in the estimation of many a vintage-amp fan, is among the sweetest and most delectable of any amp ever made.\\" In 1960, the Super Amp was redesigned along with the remainder of the Professional Series of Fender amplifiers. Accordingly, the 5G4 Super Amp was clad in light brown tolex and outfitted with a forward facing control panel. The chassis contained a larger circuit with 5 preamp tubes to support a new onboard vibrato circuit. The Super, however, was the only one of these updated Professional amps to retain its tube rectifier, giving it a unique sound more akin to the preceding tweed 5F4 design. By the end of 1960, the vibrato circuit was beefed up again resulting in the 6 preamp tube model 6G4 followed shortly after by the 6G4-A. This latter model (6G4-A) is the most common design lasting from mid 1961 to 1963 until the Super-Reverb Amp was debuted. The 6G4-A however typically sports standard brown tolex with wheat colored grill cloth and delivers approximately 40 watts of power. During this time, the 2-10\\" speakers were either Jensen AlNiCo or Oxford AlNiCo models. The output transformer was an initial weak point in the design as they tended to short out and fail under the increased power after 1958 when the Super regained its 40 watts of muscle thanks to the return to 6L6/5881 power tubes. As a result, Fender began using Woodward-Schumacher 4-ohm transformers (stamped 125A6A). These transformers had thicker gauge wires than the previous Triad version (stamped 45216) and handled the higher power with less stress. ==See also== *Fender Super Reverb ==References== S ","title":"Fender Super"},{"id":"11657841","text":"The Northern District Times is an Australian local newspaper, serving the communities in parts of the Lower North Shore and lower Hills District areas of Sydney.

He joined the team in 1996 and was a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement in 2011. Son of former hurler Pat and older brother of former player Eoin, McGrath was a stalwart on the Waterford team for more than a decade. He has won four Munster winners' medals, one National League winners' medal and three All-Star awards. He ended up as an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion. At club level McGrath is a Munster medalist with Mount Sion. In addition to this he has also won six county club championship medals. McGrath is currently a selector with the Waterford senior hurling management team. ==Playing career== ===Club=== McGrath plays his club hurling with the Mount Sion club in Waterford city and has enjoyed much success. In 1998 McGrath won his first county club championship medal following a 3‚Äì19 to 0‚Äì10 trouncing of Ballyduff Upper. After surrendering their title to Ballygunner in 1999, Mount Sion were back the following year to exact revenge. A 1‚Äì20 to 0‚Äì9 defeat of Ballygunner gave McGrath a second county championship medal. Mount Sion surrendered their club title in 2001, however, McGrath's side were back in the final again in 2002. A 1‚Äì19 to 2‚Äì14 defeat of Ballygunner secured the championship once again. It was the first of three county final victories in- a-row over Ballygunner. In 2002 McGrath won a Munster club medal as Mount Sion defeated Sixmilebridge to take the title. The club was defeated in the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final. Four club titles in-a-row proved beyond Mount Sion, however, the club bounced back in 2006 with McGrath winning a sixth county championship medal following a seven-point defeat of Ballygunner. ===Inter-county=== McGrath first came to prominence on the inter-county scene at the age of seventeen as a member of the Waterford minor hurling team. He later played with the under-21 county side, however, he enjoyed little success in these grades. By 1996 McGrath had joined the Waterford senior team and made his debut in that year's championship. In 1998 McGrath played in his first Munster final in the senior grade. Waterford held All-Ireland champions Clare to a draw in the Munster final, however, the Decies lost the replay. McGrath's side later faced Kilkenny in the All-Ireland semi-final in what would be the county's first appearance in Croke Park since 1963. Kilkenny won by a single point. Four years later in 2002 McGrath claimed his first Munster winners' medal as Waterford defeated Tipperary by 2‚Äì23 to 3‚Äì12 to claim the provincial crown for the first time in thirty-nine years. After surrendering the Munster title to Cork in 2003, McGrath's side were back in the provincial showpiece for a third successive year in 2004. In one of the greatest games of all-time Waterford defeated Cork in a Munster final for the first time in forty-five years to take the title by 3‚Äì16 to 1‚Äì21. In 2007 McGrath added a National Hurling League medal to his collection when Waterford defeated Kilkenny by 0‚Äì20 to 0‚Äì18 in the final. He later claimed a third Munster winners' medal as Waterford defeated Limerick by 3‚Äì17 to 1‚Äì14 in the provincial decider. While Waterford were viewed as possibly going on and winning the All-Ireland title for the first time in almost half a century, Limerick ambushed McGrath's side in the All-Ireland semi-final. 2008 began poorly for Waterford as the team lost their opening game to Clare as well as their manager Justin McCarthy. In spite of this poor start McGrath's side reached the All-Ireland final for the first time in forty-five years. Kilkenny provided the opposition and went on to defeat Waterford by 3‚Äì30 to 1‚Äì13 to claim a third All-Ireland title in-a- row. McGrath lined out in another Munster final in 2010 with Cork providing the opposition. A 2‚Äì15 apiece draw was the result on that occasion, however, Waterford went on to win the replay after an extra-time goal by Dan Shanahan. It was a fourth Munster winners' medal for McGrath, a record that he shares with five other Waterford players. McGrath returned to inter-county hurling for the National League in 2011, however, midway through that competition he retired from the Waterford panel due to injury. ===Inter-provincial=== McGrath was also a regular on the Munster team at various times between 1997 and 2009. He won two Railway Cup medals, in 1997 and 2001. ==Management== McGrath has some coaching experience with various Mount Sion underage teams. In 2012 he was announced as a replacement for Nicky Cashin as a Waterford selector under Michael Ryan. He resigned as selector in 2013 when Ryan stepped down. ==Honours== ===Team=== ;Mount Sion *Munster Senior Club Hurling Championship (1): 2002 *Waterford Senior Club Hurling Championship (6): 1998, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006 ;Waterford *Munster Senior Hurling Championship (4): 2002, 2004, 2007, 2010 *National Hurling League (1): 2007 ;Munster *Inter-provincial Championship (2): 1997, 2001 ===Individual=== *All-Stars (3): 2002, 2004, 2007 *In May 2020, the Irish Independent named McGrath at number ten in its \\"Top 20 hurlers in Ireland over the past 50 years\\".

In 1917, J. N. Klock and his wife, Carrie, bought a significant stretch of lakeshore including tall dunes and of shoreline from E. K. Warren, donor of Warren Dunes, and deeded the land to the city of Benton Harbor. They gave the land in memory of their daughter, Jean, who died in early childhood. The Klock deed stipulates that the property be used for bathing beach, park purposes, or other public purposes. At the park dedication, Klock stated, \\"In taking an inventory of life, we all take stock of the circumstances surrounding the happiest moments. The giving of this park to the city of Benton Harbor has been to Mrs. Klock and myself, the happiest moment of our lives. The deed of this park in the courthouse of St. Joseph will live forever. Perhaps some of you do not own a foot of ground, remember then, that this is your park, it belongs to you. Perhaps some of you have no piano or phonograph, the roll of the water murmuring in calm, roaring in storm, is your music, your piano and music box.

The course is privately owned with daily usage available to anyone for $150.00 per round. Residents of Benton Harbor can play for about $40.00 per round, as can all residents of Berrien County.Warm Weather Gives Harbor Shores Early Start, www.scribd.com ==Development vs. Preservation== Jean Klock Park is one of the oldest public parks in the state of Michigan and predates the formation of Michigan's state parks, which occurred in the early 1920s. In 1952 the city of Benton Harbor purchased an adjoining parcel of land along the northern border of the park to be added to the park acreage. Mr. Klock had tried for years with no success to buy it himself, but his death in 1938 and then World War II deferred the long-sought acquisition. The addition extended the beach shoreline by . In 1990 the city commissioned a master plan for Jean Klock Park, funded by a Coastal Zone Management Program grant, and the report concluded: \\"Two general areas comprising the majority of the site are particularly sensitive to human impact. The sand dunes and the wetlands on this property are of a level of quality that they require protection from over-use. Their importance as a resource cannot be overestimated.\\"Jean Klock Park Master Plan, 1990, Coastal Zone Management Grant, www.scribd.com The golf course development is extremely controversial. Taking one side of the controversy, the Michigan Messenger (December 21, 2009) stated that the golf course development has severely damaged the natural resource values on the park property. On the other side of the debate, are advocates for a luxury housing development, which would be centered around an 18-hole championship golf course designed by golf legend and course designer Jack Nicklaus. They depict the plan as transformative of the entire area surrounding Benton Harbor.Harbor Shores Golf Club to Transform Southwest Michigan, www.scribd.com Until recent years, Jean Klock Park was considered untouchable for commercial development. In 1986, the city sought to add the eastern part of Jean Klock Park, excluding the dunes, to a Downtown Development Authority (DDA), but protests from residents who were enraged by the city's disregard for the Klock deed restrictions and community understanding of acceptable uses for the park influenced the Michigan Attorney General's office to issue an opinion that stated that land not contiguous to a city's downtown area could not be incorporated into a DDA.JKP Added to Downtown Development Authority, 1986, www.scribd.com In 2003, the city announced that, because of financial difficulties, Benton Harbor would sell an under-utilized portion of Jean Klock Park to Grand Boulevard Renaissance, LLC, which intended to construct a residential development on the property. The residents of Benton Harbor filed a lawsuit challenging the city‚Äôs right to convey the property, asserting that such a conveyance violated the park's deed‚Äôs covenants and restrictions. The case was settled, and the parties agreed to a consent judgment that allowed the sale of a portion of Jean Klock Park to the private developer in exchange for an injunction against further privatization or conversion of the park. The consent judgment stated that Jean Klock Park shall not be used ‚Äúfor any purpose other than a bathing beach, park purposes, or other public purpose related to bathing beach or park use; provided, however, that there shall be no recreational vehicle park campsites...The restrictions in this paragraph shall run with the land and shall be binding upon the City and its successors.‚Äù In July 2005, the city and Harbor Shores Community Redevelopment Corporation announced that they wished to use a portion of Jean Klock Park for a golf course that would be part of a privately owned mixed-use development consisting of commercial and retail buildings, residences, the golf course, a marina, and other recreational uses. The project would use twenty-two acres of park land for three holes of an 18-hole Jack Nicklaus championship golf course. The city would lease the necessary land to Harbor Shores for a period of up to 105 years. On July 8, 2008, two plaintiffs in the 2003 litigation filed another lawsuit, claiming that a privately owned and operated golf course violates the previous consent judgement, seeking enforcement of the restrictions in the deed and the consent judgment. The plaintiffs argued that the consent judgment‚Äôs intent was to require that the Jean Klock Park continue to be used for passive recreational use ‚Äì the same way it had been used since 1917. Harbor Shores and the city responded with motions citing very expansive uses to which public parks in Michigan have been subjected, including runways and nuclear reactors. A golf course is a park purpose, the judge ruled, or certainly a public purpose related to a park use. The Berrien County Circuit Court further held that, because the city itself is empowered to use the park land as a golf course, the deed and consent judgment are not violated if the city leases the land to another party to do the same thing. The plaintiffs immediately appealed the circuit court decision. The Appeals Court denied the appeal, affirming the lower court's ruling. A petition to appeal the decision was sent to the Michigan Supreme Court, but was declined.Michigan Supreme Court Order, Jean Klock Park, 02 05 2011, www.scribd.com ==Ongoing Litigation== Seven other people filed a federal lawsuit against the City of Benton Harbor, the National Park Service, the United States Army Corps of Engineers, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. Golf course construction on the park site required permits from the Corps of Engineers and the State of Michigan, as well as permission from the National Park Service. The golf course development covers over and adjoins federally regulated wetlands, two rivers and Lake Michigan, all regulated waters of the United States. On January 25, 2012, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Julie Weiss v. Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior (Western District of Michigan), an appeal from Julie Weiss and other concerned citizens to stop the development project, found most of the plaintiffs' claims to be debatable.Docket No. 10-1313, United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, January 25, 2012 ==Support of \\"Preservation\\" by Environmental Protection Organizations== External organizations have supported the efforts of residents to \\"preserve\\" the park since 2003, including the Alliance for the Great Lakes, the Michigan Environmental Council, and Freshwater Future.

The Leloir Institute of biotechnology. Founded by Nobel Laureate Dr. Luis Leloir, it is among the most prestigious in its field in Latin America, and the world. The most important aspects of science and technology in Argentina are concerned with medicine, nuclear physics, biotechnology, nanotechnology, space and rocket technology and several fields related to the country's main economic activities. According to the World Bank, Argentine exports in high-technology are products with high R&D; intensity, such as in aerospace, computers, pharmaceuticals, scientific instruments, and electrical machinery. Benefiting from Latin America's highest literacy rates since shortly after President Domingo Faustino Sarmiento made primary education universally available in the 1860s and 1870s, Argentine researchers and professionals at home and abroad continue to enjoy a high standing in their fields. Argentine Bernardo Houssay was the first Latin American awarded with a Nobel Prize in sciences. Educated in a National University, Houssay went on to establish Argentina's National Research Council, a centerpiece in Argentine scientific and technological development, fifty years on. Many other Argentines have contributed to scientific development around the world, though sometimes having to emigrate to do so. Probably for that, the Argentine education is referred as the Latin American docta (in Spanish: La docta Latinoamericana), which originates from the Latin docta (learned). ==Eminences in their fields== Dr. Luis Agote (second from right) overseeing the first safe and effective blood transfusion (1914) Despite its modest budget and numerous setbacks, academics and the sciences in Argentina have enjoyed an international respect since the turn of the 1900s, when Dr. Luis Agote devised the first safe and effective means of blood transfusion as well as Ren√© Favaloro, who was a pioneer in the improvement of the bypass surgery . Argentina is the Latin American country with the most Nobel Prize laureates; and has three Nobel Prize winners in the sciences: Bernardo Houssay in Physiology or Medicine in 1947, Luis Federico Leloir in Chemistry in 1970, and C√©sar Milstein in Physiology or Medicine in 1984. Dr. Domingo Liotta created the first artificial heart in 1969, revolutionizing the heart transplant field. They have also contributed to bioscience in efforts like the Human Genome Project, where Argentine scientists have successfully mapped the genome of a living being, a world first. Argentina has its own satellite programme, nuclear power station designs (4th generation) and public nuclear energy company INVAP, which provides several countries with nuclear reactors. SAC-D satellite Other projects are focusing on IS, nanotechnology, biotechnology, helicopters, farming machinery and military defensive systems. Established in 1991, the CONAE has since launched 8 indigenous built satellites successfully, AMSAT, MuSat, SAC-B, SAC-A, SAC-C, SAC-D/Aquarius, ARSAT I and ARSAT-2. In June 2009, secured an agreement with the European Space Agency on for the installation of a 35-m diameter antenna and other mission support facilities at the Pierre Auger Observatory. The facility will contribute to numerous ESA space probes, as well as CONAE's own, domestic research projects. Chosen from 20 potential sites and one of only three such ESA installations in the world, the new antenna will create a triangulation which will allow the ESA to ensure mission coverage around the clock. Social sciences have a particularly strong tradition in Argentina. Home to 122 think tanks specializing in public policy and economics issues, Argentina ranks fifth in the number of these institutions worldwide. In April 2009, Dr. Sandra D√≠az, researcher from the Instituto Multidisciplinario de Biologia Vegetal (IMBIV - NU of C), was elected as a foreign associate member to the National Academy of Sciences (U.S.A.) in recognition of her outstanding work on climate change, being the first Hispanic woman to achieve this honor. Moreover, Dr. Diaz won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 as a member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Dr. Luis Federico Leloir (left) and his staff toast his 1970 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Currently there are further outstanding Argentine researchers in the mentioned institution as Alberto Carlos Frasch (NU of SAM), Armando Parodi (NU of SAM - Leloir Institute), and Francisco de la Cruz (Balseiro Institute - NU of Cu). Among the public institutions devoted to research and development in Argentina are: *CITEDEF: Defense Scientific and Technical Research Institute *CNEA: National Atomic Energy Commission *CONAE: National Space Activities Commission *CONICET: the National Research Council *INTA: National Agricultural Technology Institute *INTI: National Industrial Technology Institute *INVAP: Argentine high-technology research & development company ==A well-educated work force== Literacy Level Four out of five Argentine adults have completed grade school, over a third have completed their secondary education and one in nine Argentine adults have college degrees. Likewise, Argentina has the highest rate of university students in Latin America, besides having more within the southern hemisphere with professors and institutions awarded prestigious prizes and fellowships from philanthropic institutions like the John S. Guggenheim Foundation awards or the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, to name a few. Official sources recently reported roughly 1,500,000 college students within the Argentine University System; this represents the highest rate - relative to its total population - of academic students in Latin America and exceeds the ratio in many developed countries. ==See also== *Education in Argentina *List of universities in Argentina *Argentine defense industry *Spanish language in science and technology ==References== ==External links== *Science and Technology in Argentina (Spanish) *Science and Education in Argentina *Argentine Higher Education Official Site *The Argentine Education System Category:Argentine culture Category:National universities Category:Education in Argentina Category:Academia in Argentina ","title":"Science and technology in Argentina"},{"id":"11657978","text":"The following lists events that happened during 1962 in the Kingdom of Afghanistan. ==Incumbents== * Monarch - Mohammed Zahir Shah * Prime Minister - Mohammed Daoud Khan ==January 1962== On January 22, 1962, the United States announces that Afghanistan has agreed to open the border for eight weeks following January 29, 1962, in order to allow aid supplies to enter from Pakistan. Meanwhile, the U.S. ambassador, Henry A. Byroade, continues efforts to open the border from Pakistan; the only alternative routes for aid supplies are from the north via Soviet rail connections, or through Iran at a cost of $70 per ton extra. In April the Afghan government signs an agreement with the Iranian government for use of the route through Iran. The Iranian ambassador to Pakistan, Hassan Arafa, proposes that the best solution to Afghanistan's problems lies in the formation of an Iran-Afghan-Pakistan confederation. Kabul refuses to consider the proposal. During July and early August the Shah of Iran visits both Pakistan and Afghanistan in an effort at conciliation. ==April 1962== A second five-year plan is announced by Prime Minister Mohammad Daud, with a foreign-aid requirement of $734,000,000 for the expansion of mines, industries, agriculture, and communications. In June the U.S. expresses its unwillingness to make a firm commitment of funds over a five-year period. The Afghans also seek commitments from Japan, Italy, and Yugoslavia.

Both the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. continue their road-building projects in Afghanistan. The U.S. grades and paves the road from Kabul to Peshawar (Pakistan) and is building another road, costing more than $30,000,000, from Kabul to Kandahar and thence to the Pakistan border. The Soviets are building a tunnel to connect the modern road from the Oxus river (their frontier with Afghanistan) to Kabul, at an estimated cost of $40,000,000. ==Incumbents== * Monarch - Mohammed Zahir Shah * Prime Minister - Mohammed Daoud Khan (until 10 March), Mohammad Yusuf (starting 10 March) ==February 25, 1963== A Soviet-Afghan trade protocol is signed in Moscow, pursuant to which Afghanistan is to export wool, cotton, dried and fresh fruits, and oilseeds in exchange for motor vehicles, rolled steel, oil products, and consumer goods. ==March 1963== For the first time in Afghan history, a new administration is formed with no members of the royal family in the cabinet, when Sardar (Prince) Mohammad Daud Khan resigns and a commoner, Mohammad Yusuf, is appointed to the prime ministership. The new Prime Minister announces his cabinet on March 13, 1963; he makes several shifts within the cabinet, taking charge of external affairs, appointing new First and Second Deputy Premiers, and changing other posts. His most controversial appointment is the designation of Gen. Mohammad Khan, who was dismissed as governor of Kandahar by a previous cabinet, as Defense Minister. The new Prime Minister undertakes serious currency reform, abrogating multiple rates which priced the Afghani to the U.S. dollar at anything from 20 to 57, while the free market rate was near 50.7. The new, uniform rate establishes 45 Afghanis to the dollar for all transactions. The reform is supported by the International Monetary Fund, which assigns Afghanistan a drawing fund of $5,625,000 to support Afghan foreign exchange reserves during the transition period. ==April 26, 1963== An announcement is made that the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID) has granted Afghanistan a loan of $2,652,000 for the purchase of three U.S. passenger aircraft to be used by Ariana Afghan Airlines. ==Week of May 11, 1963== Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, the president of India, visits Kabul. ==June 4, 1963== The prime minister receives a unanimous vote of confidence from the National Assembly.

For the first time in several years relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan are relatively amicable following the decision of the government of Afghanistan to deal with the Pakhtunistan dispute only through diplomatic negotiations and to carry on normal relations with Pakistan in other respects. Afghanistan does not, however, join the Istanbul Pact drawn up in July between Pakistan, Iran, and Turkey to foster economic cooperation. Observers voice the belief that Afghanistan's desire to maintain a strictly neutral policy is the basis of the decision not to join, since all three of the other countries are members of pro-Western alliances. ==September 9, 1964== The Grand Council (loya jirga) is convened to discuss and ratify a new constitution; the latter event takes place on September 19. The House of the People is to have 216 elected members, and the House of the Elders is to have 84 members, one-third elected by the people, one-third appointed by the king, and one-third elected indirectly by new provincial assemblies. Under the terms of the new constitution no members of the royal family may become Prime Minister or hold any other ministerial portfolio; neither may a member of the royal family become a member of the loya jirga, or Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. This is a complete reversal of the situation that prevailed until 1963 when Mohammad Yusuf became the first Afghan Prime Minister not of royal blood. On the other hand, the constitution also provides that only descendants of Mohammad Nadir Shah, father of the present king, may ascend the throne. Democratic reforms in the new constitution include the guaranteeing of such individual liberties as the right of free trial in all criminal cases, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to form political parties. ==September 1964== The Salang Highway is opened, linking Kandahar in south Afghanistan and Kabul with Kushka, the southernmost town of the Soviet Union on the 1,900-km border between the U.S.S.R. and Afghanistan. This highway provides the first motor access through the mountains of the Hindu Kush to connect the northern towns of Afghanistan with the capital and the south. Built by Soviet engineers and with Soviet aid, the highway took more than four years to complete and cost about $38 million, which is to be repaid by Afghanistan. Its most spectacular feature is a tunnel 2,670 m long. In the meantime, the U.S. Agency for International Development authorized a loan of $7.7 million for the construction of an all-weather highway from Herat to Islam Qala on the Iranian border, and the Soviet Union signed an agreement to provide the equivalent of ¬£10.5 million for another highway in northern Afghanistan. ==End of 1964== Afghanistan's new progressive outlook is recognized when it receives a credit of $3.5 million from the International Development Association, the first ever granted to Afghanistan by that organization. Seven secondary vocational schools are created with the funds.

The improvement of relations with Pakistan continues, and although toward the end of 1964 the loya jirga (the traditional Grand Council of the nation, superseded under the new constitution) passed a formal resolution in favour of the creation of Pakhtunistan, the violent propaganda that had offended Pakistan so seriously died down.

The unit's full official name is 7th \\"Coronel Conde\\" Mechanized Infantry Regiment, and it is part of the 1st Armored Brigade, 3rd Army Division. The regiment fought in the South American wars of independence and in the Falklands War (), as part of the 10th Brigade, during the battles of Mount Longdon and Wireless Ridge. ==Origins== The 7th Regiment traces its origins back to November 1810. At that time, it was known as the Cochabamba Infantry Regiment in Bolivia, and comprised locals. The Mayor of Chuquisaca, Francisco Rivero, was designated its commanding officer, with the rank of colonel. In June 1811, the unit was renamed No. 7 Infantry Regiment, and had its baptism of fire on 20 June 1811 at Huaqui, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Bola√±os. Given the scarcity of experienced officers and the lack of training among the infantry fighting the well-armed and disciplined Spanish-backed enemy, the 7th Regiment soldiers could not maintain their assigned positions and soon joined in the retreat of the Patriot forces with the unit being disbanded in the aftermath of defeat. However, in 1812, it was officially announced that plans were in progress for the reformation the regiment with horseback grenadiers and supporting infantry recruited from the patriots residing in the Banda Oriental Province. ==War of Independence== On 31 May 1813 the 7th Regiment was officially formed in Buenos Aires, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Toribio de Luzuriaga. Sent to Upper Peru in late 1814, it suffered heavy losses in the Second Battle of the Sipe Sipe fighting Spanish Royalist forces. The combat unit was soon reformed and placed under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Pedro Conde. On 19 January 1817, the companies of the regiment formed the vanguard of the patriot forces of General Soler. They crossed the Andes through the Paso de Los Patos, taking part in the Battles of Achupayas, Putaendo, Las Coimas and Guardia Vieja. El 12 February 1817, the formation played an important role in the victory obtained during the Battle of Chacabuco against Spanish backed forces. The combat companies were then placed under the command of General Bernardo O' Higgins, taking part in the liberation of southern Chile, fighting at the Battles of Gavil√°n, Carampague and Talcahuano. Durante the Second Battle of Cancha Rayada, the regiment held firm despite a surprise enemy counterattack. The regiment later took part in the Liberation of Peru as part of the 1st Division under General Las Heras and later General Arenales. == Post- independence == On 17 April 1917, the 7th Regiment boarded trains at Estaci√≥n Mu√±iz taking them to their new home base of La Plata. == Falklands War == In 1982, the Argentine Army was organised into five corps, with its tactical deployment built around twelve brigades. With their tanks, the 1st and 2nd Armoured Cavalry Brigades were not suitable for operations in the Falklands/Malvinas and the 6th and 8th Mountain Infantry Brigades and 11th Mechanized Infantry Brigades were facing Chile. The 3rd and 7th Jungle Infantry Brigades in the north were not equipped for cold weather operations and were facing Brazil and Uruguay. The 4th Airborne Infantry Brigade, which was the National Strategic Reserve, was deployed in C√≥rdoba Province and the 10th Mechanized Infantry Brigade in Buenos Aires was entrusted with the defence of the Atlantic Littoral. In the immediate aftermath of Operaci√≥n Rosario, the Argentine Army High Command recommended that Brigadier-General Julio Fern√°ndez Torres' 4th Airborne Brigade and Brigadier-General Oscar Luis Jofr√©'s 10th Mechanized Brigade be readied for possible deployment to the Falklands. When Brigadier General Jofr√© was warned to take his 10th Brigade to the Malvinas, he ordered the 1982 intake of conscripts to be replaced by reservists. This was done by announcements on the radio, television, newspapers, phone calls, telegrams and home visits. Having heard and seen the wide coverage of the recuperation of the Falklands, most were more than willing to complete their military service, as demanded by Law 4.031 of the Servicio Militar Obligatorio by then-president Julio Argentino Roca, the military hero and statesman who conquered the Patagonia during the \\"Conquest of the Desert\\". The recalled reservists had a year of training, which included the 7th Colonel Conde Regiment fighting a mock battle in central Argentina alongside the 3rd General Belgrano and 6th General Viamonte Infantry Regiments of the 10th Brigade. They possessed fully automatic FN FAL rifles, FAP light machine guns and PAM sub-machine guns; these weapons delivered more firepower than the British L1A1 rifle (SLR). They were also equipped with FN MAG 7.62mm general-purpose machine guns, which were almost identical to those of the British Paras and Commandos. At their San Miguel del Monte training camp the 7th Regiment companies prepared for a possible war against Chile and carried out some helicopter drills with the 601st Combat Aviation Battalion. Some fifty of the 7th Regiment were to fight more resolutely than the rest and passed on their skills, having been put through a commando course organized by commando-trained Major Oscar Jaimet, the Operations Officer of the 6th Infantry Regiment. Private Jorge Altieri in an interview after the war told how he trained hard with B Company: > I was issued with a FAL 7.62 millimetre rifle. Other guys were given FAP > machineguns and others got PAMs [submachine guns]. The main emphasis in > shooting was making every bullet count.

Data resources are usually as stored in databases under a database management system or other software such as electronic spreadsheets. In many smaller organizations, data administration is performed occasionally, or is a small component of the database administrator‚Äôs work. In the context of information systems development, data administration ideally begins at system conception, ensuring there is a data dictionary to help maintain consistency, avoid redundancy, and model the database so as to make it logical and usable, by means of data modeling, including database normalization techniques. ==Data Resource Management== According to the Data Management Association (DAMA), data resource management is \\"the development and execution of architectures, policies, practices and procedures that properly manage the full data lifecycle needs of an enterprise\\". Data Resource management may be thought of as a managerial activity that applies information system and other data management tools to the task of managing an organization‚Äôs data resource to meet a company‚Äôs business needs, and the information they provide to their shareholders. From the perspective of database design, it refers to the development and maintenance of data models to facilitate data sharing between different systems, particularly in a corporate context. Data Resource Management is also concerned with both data quality and compatibility between data models. Since the beginning of the information age, businesses need all types of data on their business activity. With each data created, when a business transaction is made, need data is created. With these data, new direction is needed that focuses on managing data as a critical resource of the organization to directly support its business activities. The data resource must be managed with the same intensity and formality that other critical resources are managed. Organizations must emphasize the information aspect of information technology, determine the data needed to support the business, and then use appropriate technology to build and maintain a high- quality data resource that provides that support. Data resource quality is a measure of how well the organization's data resource supports the current and the future business information demand of the organization. The data resource cannot support just the current business information demand while sacrificing the future business information demand. It must support both the current and the future business information demand. The ultimate data resource quality is stability across changing business needs and changing technology. A corporate data resource must be developed within single, organization-wide common data architecture. A data architecture is the science and method of designing and constructing a data resource that is business driven, based on real-world objects and events as perceived by the organization, and implemented into appropriate operating environments. It is the overall structure of a data resource that provides a consistent foundation across organizational boundaries to provide easily identifiable, readily available, high-quality data to support the business information demand. The common data architecture is a formal, comprehensive data architecture that provides a common context within which all data at an organization's disposal are understood and integrated. It is subject oriented, meaning that it is built from data subjects that represent business objects and business events in the real world that are of interest to the organization and about which data are captured and maintained. ==References== Category:Databases ","title":"Data administration"},{"id":"11658045","text":"Westhampton is a station along the Montauk Branch of the Long Island Rail Road.

It derives from the medieval personal name, of Biblical origin, from Aramaic ◊™◊ê◊ï◊û◊ê t'om'a, a byname meaning 'twin'. It was borne by one of the disciples of Christ, best known for his skepticism about Christ's resurrection (John 20:24‚Äì29). The th- spelling in English results from the initial letter of the name in the Greek New Testament being a theta. The English pronunciation as t rather than a dental fricative is the result of French influence from an early date. In Britain, the surname is widely distributed throughout the country, but especially common in Scotland, Cornwall, and Wales. Thomas is the ninth most common surname in the United Kingdom. It is found as a personal name among Christians in India, and in the United States; it is also used as a family name among the Saint Thomas Christian families from Kerala, South India. In the 1990 United States Census, Thomas was the twelfth most common surname, accounting for 0.3% of the population.United States Census Bureau (9 May 1995). s:1990 Census Name Files dist.all.last (1-100).

It is currently positioned in geostationary orbit at a longitude of 131 degrees West, from where it is used to relay cable television across North America for onward distribution. It broadcasts to Canada, the Caribbean, Mexico and the United States. AMC-11 was built by Lockheed Martin, and is based on the A2100A satellite bus. It was originally ordered by GE Americom as GE-11, however following the merger of GE Americom and SES, it was redesignated AMC-11 while still under construction. It is equipped with 24 transponders operating in the G and H bands of the NATO frequency spectrum, or the C band of the IEEE spectrum. At launch it had a mass of , with an expected operational lifespan of around fifteen years. The launch of AMC-11, which was conducted by International Launch Services, was the penultimate flight and last commercial launch of the Atlas II carrier rocket, which flew in the Atlas IIAS configuration. The launch occurred from Space Launch Complex 36B at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, at 22:22 GMT on 19 May 2004. The launch successfully placed AMC-11 into a geosynchronous transfer orbit, from which it raised itself to geostationary orbit by means of a LEROS-1C apogee motor. Its insertion into geosynchronous orbit occurred at 20:00 on 24 May 2004. In late May and early June 2010, the Galaxy 15 satellite, which had failed with its transponders still broadcasting, passed close to AMC-11. Since Galaxy 15 broadcast on similar frequencies to AMC-11, interference from its transponders could have affected signals originating from AMC-11. As a result, AMC-11 was manoeuvred out of the way of Galaxy 15, and the SES-1 satellite was brought in to provide backup in case AMC-11 could not continue broadcasting. Galaxy 15 passed within 0.2 degrees of AMC-11, however no service interruptions occurred. ==See also== *2004 in spaceflight ==References== Category:Spacecraft launched in 2004 Category:SES satellites Category:Satellites using the A2100 bus ","title":"AMC-11"},{"id":"11658207","text":"Partiture by Ferdinad Beyer.

It is located in the southern part of the Avenues south of Quintara and north of Sloat Boulevard. Also referred to as the \\"Parkside District,\\" the neighborhood includes the following parks: Parkside Square, Pine Lake, Pine Lake Park (a.k.a. Dog Park), Concert Meadow, Charlie Sava Pool (formerly Carl Larsen Pool), Carl Larsen Park, Stern Grove, McCoppin Park, and McCoppin Square. ==Location== The Parkside as a neighborhood started in July 1905 when a syndicate led by William Crocker announced they had quietly bought land from the estate of Adolph Sutro and others to create a new million-dollar development. The \\"park\\" of Parkside was not Golden Gate Park, but rather the stand of trees and plants around Laguna Puerca (now called Pine Lake, and often called \\"Mud Lake\\" or \\"Crawdad Lake\\" by old-timers) west of Sigmund Stern Grove. The boundaries of the Parkside consist of Quintara Street on the north, Sloat Boulevard on the south, 36th Avenue/Sunset Boulevard on the west, and a diagonal eastern boundary line that abuts on the former Rancho San Miguel property, running from 12th Avenue on the north to 19th Avenue and Sloat on the south. Later with more development to the west from Sloat Boulevard west to the ocean, east to Quintara and south to the San Francisco Zoo the Outer Parkside is also part of the Parkside District of San Francisco. Parkside Elementary School (located at 25th Avenue and Vicente Street) was closed in 1975 and torn down in 2004. In its place today stands Dianne Feinstein Elementary School at the Parkside Campus. Parkside Library is located at 22nd Avenue and Taraval. ==Characteristics== The area is mostly residential, except for the commercial corridor on Taraval Street. Its buildings largely consist of almost identical \\"cookie-cutter\\" stucco houses with various decorative elements, which were constructed in the 1920s and 1930s, when assembly-line techniques entered building construction. The L Taraval of the Muni Metro serves the neighborhood and provides a mode of transportation to downtown. Other transit lines include the 29 Sunset, 48 Quintara-24th Street, 66 Quintara, and 18 46th Avenue. The Parkside branch of the San Francisco Public Library is also located in the area. The Sigmund Stern Recreational Grove is known as the location of the Stern Grove Festival summer concerts. The neighborhood is represented by District 4.

The lake lies within the boundary of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge and is the lowest point in the Blitzen Valley drainage. == History == The lake has been known by several names, including Salt Lake in 1838,Named by the Bureau of Topographical Engineers on Map of the United States, Territory of Oregon. Tonowama, and Lake Harney. Despite a history of 9,000 years of human inhabitation on Harney Lake by the Northern Paiute Indians primarily as nomadic wintering camps, little sign of modern human habitation is evident on Harney Lake. The nearest residents live in the community of Narrows. == Water level == During wet years, the lake receives water from Malheur Lake, located approximately to the east. The depth of Harney Lake is less than during normal water years and has dried up completely during times of drought. As typical to other alkali lake beds in the western United States, minimal aquatic life is found in Harney Lake. A species of inland brine shrimp is the only form of life in Harney Lake. Despite its limited food supply, the lake is part of an important inland marsh ecosystem for migratory birds in the arid southeast Oregon desert. ==Ecology== ===Malheur Lake Basin redband trout=== Malheur and Harney lakes have reduced access by Great Basin redband trout due to irrigation diversions, channelization, draining of marshlands and high alkalinities. Even if trout could gain access again, redband populations would not survive in this marginal habitat. Harney Lake has been inhospitable to redband trout for many years due to high alkalinities. Today, redband trout in the Malheur Lakes Basin are widely distributed in small- and medium-size streams. The redband is a unique subspecies adapted to the Malheur Lake Basin ecosystem. In these closed High Desert basins, redband trout have evolved to survive in environments with vast extremes of both water flow and temperature. They are one of only eight separate desert basin populations of interior native redband trout. The Malheur Lakes redband comprises 10 population groups in the closed interior basin of Harney and Malheur lakes. Historically, all streams were interconnected and these fish moved to the lakes and among population segments.Behnke, R.J. 1992. Native Trout of Western North America.

Darley is one of the few items of the University's to have survived the fire of 1845. Reverend Doctor Robert Bruce (1778‚Äì1846) is often regarded as the first chancellor of the University of Pittsburgh, then called the Western University of Pennsylvania, serving from 1819 to 1835 and again from 1836 to 1843. During this time the heads of the university held the title of \\"Principal\\", a holdover from the institution's academy days, and there were also several Principals prior to Bruce that headed the forerunner to the Western University of Pennsylvania, the Pittsburgh Academy. In 1819 the Pennsylvania legislature modified the 1787 charter of the Pittsburgh Academy to confer university status on the school. This initiated the selection of Reverend Bruce to be Principal of the University from 1819 and he served in that capacity until 1835 when Gilbert Morgan was selected as President. Upon Morgan's departure in 1836, Bruce was reinstated to his former position. Bruce was born in the parish of Scone, Perthshire, Scotland, February 20, 1778, was a graduate of the University of Edinburgh. Bruce was pastor of the First Associate (United) Presbyterian Church of Pittsburgh from 1808 to his death in 1846, and was a professor of natural history, chemistry, and mathematics at the Western University of Pennsylvania from 1820 to 1843. Thomas Mellon, founder of Mellon Financial Corporation and student at the University under Bruce, described him in his autobiography in the following way: > In Latin and Greek, mathematics and . . . philosophy, Doctor Bruce, the > president of the college, heard our recitations. He was one of a class of > men rarely met with: modest and retiring of manner, shunning notoriety, and > averse to anything that had the appearance of ostentation. He was highly > cultured in general literature, an extensive reader, liberal minded, and a > most accurate scholar in the several branches he professed. He had all the > philosophy of Bacon and Descartes, Hume, Reid, and Dugald Stewart at command > ‚Äì he had himself been a student of Dugald Stewart. . . . > The sentiments of Dr. Bruce's valedictory to our class in September, 1837, > have influenced my life and still abide in my memory. > . . . He had the learning of a great scholar and the ability of an apt > teacher; and what was no less important to his position, his dignity of > manner and kindness of heart secured the love and respect of the students. > Bruce's tenure in leading the university was noted for his decision to allow the admission of the first Black student in 1829. Bruce was known to be one of the leading abolitionists in the Pittsburgh region. Bruce withdrew from the University in 1843 because of perceived criticism by reform-minded trustees. He then rented some rooms and set up a school, College Duquesne, and a number of Western University students who were members of the Tilghman Literary Society followed him. Before his death, the misunderstanding with the University was cleared up and the charter of College Duquesne was allowed to lapse by 1849. Meanwhile, the Western University of Pennsylvania graduated its own students and, almost thirty years later, the seceding students were officially recognized as University alumni and nineteen survivors were awarded honorary master of arts degrees. ==References== * * Category:Chancellors of the University of Pittsburgh Category:1778 births Category:1846 deaths ","title":"Robert Bruce (Pitt Chancellor)"},{"id":"11658354","text":"The Birmingham A's were a Minor League Baseball team that played in the Double-A Southern League from 1967 to 1975.

There are three major Internet service providers in Singapore, namely, Singtel, StarHub, and M1 and other growing providers like MyRepublic and ViewQwest. Over the years, the Singapore Government has been promoting the usage of broadband Internet access, as part of its Intelligent Nation 2015 (iN2015) and Smart Nation initiative. Internet access is readily available in Singapore, with a connectivity rate of over 99%. Recent surveys have also indicated a significant emotional connectedness between Singaporeans with their internet access. In August 2018, Ookla's tests determined that Singapore's broadband speed of 181.47 Mbit/s is the highest in the world. ==Beginnings== Before the Internet, Singapore was the first country in the world to launch an interactive information service to the public. A service known as Teleview was jointly developed by Telecom Authority of Singapore (TAS) and GEC-Marconi of the UK. The service started trials during late 1987 using specifically designed terminals. This was expanded in 1989, and eventually, as Personal Computers became more capable, there was a software/hardware addition made available for the PC. Early service providers for editorials were Singapore Press Holdings, Housing Development Board and Singapore Stock Exchange, which provided a range of services, including general news, business news, housing lots and selection lists, real-time stocks and shares prices. Teleview was initially set up as a public service at the same time Singapore Telecom was formed in 1992 from the business arm of TAS, whereas TAS remained as the statutory regulatory authority. Subscribers connected to the Teleview, now-defunct, service by SingTel, via a dialup connection initially by 1200‚Äì2400 bit modems (V22 Biz) and then later via 9600-14400 kbit/s modems. Pages with photographic images were sent to the terminal by Full Field Teletext transmissions from dedicated data inserters/UHF TV Transmitters. Subscribers initially paid no time based usage fee for this service. However, later charges, on top of telephone line charges were levied. A later development from Teleview provided an interfaced connection to the Internet. Subscribers were given access to the Internet via a text-only terminal; email was accessed by Pine, and webpages were viewed by Lynx. Subsequently, Teleview was rendered obsolete, and SingNet started offering to the Internet via SLIP/PPP over modem. ==Dial-up access== Access to the Internet via Teleview-SingNet evolved to a full-fledged dial-up service known as SingNet, a subsidiary of SingTel. The formerly-private TechNet network was purchased by Pacific Internet. A third ISP was Cyberway; it was eventually purchased by StarHub on 21 January 1999. ==Broadband access== In a government-led initiative to connect the island in a high-speed broadband network using various mediums such as fibre, DSL and cable, the Singapore ONE project was formally announced in June 1996, and commercially launched in June 1998. By December 1998, Singapore ONE is available nationwide with the completion of the national fibre optics network. In 1997, commercial trials for SingTel ATM-based \\"SingTel Magix\\" service were undertaken in March, before being launched in June. Also in June, Singapore Cable Vision commenced trials for its cable modem based services, before being commercially deployed in December 1999. Singtel's ADSL service was subsequently rolled out on a nationwide scale in August 2000. In 2006, M1 introduced its broadband services. ==Current developments== In January 2001, the Broadband Media Association was formed to promote the broadband industry. By April the same year there were six broadband Internet providers, with the total number of broadband users exceeding 300,000. Pacific Internet introduced wireless broadband services in October 2001. In December 2006, Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) introduced a programme named \\"Wireless@SG\\". It is part of its Next Generation National Infocomm Infrastructure initiative. It offers everyone free wireless access in high human-traffic areas, including the Central Business District, downtown shopping belts like Orchard Road, and residential town centres. By April 2013 the access speed had increased to 2 Mbit/s in April 2013.The free service was planned to continue until 31 March 2017. In early September 2010, internet service providers in Singapore rolled out the Next Generation Nationwide Broadband Network (Next Gen NBN) service plans. The Next Gen NBN is Singapore's nationwide ultra-high speed fibre network. It offered broadband speeds of up to 1 Gbit/s at comparable prices to ADSL and cable connection. Deployed 75% nationwide as of August 2011, Next Gen NBN is on track to achieve its target of 95 per cent coverage by mid-2012. In November 2014, ViewQwest unveiled plans for a 2 Gbit/s fibre broadband service for households in Singapore, offering the country's fastest internet connection in the market. In March 2015, the service was officially launched making it the world's fastest home broadband plan alongside Japan. Cable and ADSL services were withdrawn permanently in June 2016, with existing customers slowly being phased out. Singtel has announced complete shutdown and transfer of its ADSL customers by April 2018. StarHub has announced complete shutdown of cable customers by June 2019. In August 2016, Colt launched dedicated bandwidth, business-grade internet services for enterprises in Singapore. In August 2018, Singapore's broadband speed of 181.47 Mbit/s was ranked the highest in the world. ==Censorship== In Singapore, Internet services provided by the three major Internet service providers are subject to regulation by the Media Development Authority (MDA) to block a \\"symbolic\\" number of websites containing \\"mass impact objectionable\\" material, including Playboy, YouPorn and Pornhub. ==ISPs== There is a category about Internet service provider , see: : Category:Internet service providers of Singapore === Optical fibre broadband providers === ==== Networking company ==== * NetLink Trust (Formerly OpenNet) (Passive Infrastructure Company ; NetCo ; Wholesale) ==== Operating company ==== * Nucleus Connect (Active Infrastructure Company ; OpCo ; Wholesale) ==== Retail service providers ==== * M1 * Singtel * StarHub * MyRepublic * ViewQwest * WhizComms ===Wireless@SG (Wi-Fi) operators === Free access; Minimally 5 Mbit/s * M1 * Singtel * StarHub ===Mobile broadband providers=== 3G/4G LTE Network *MNOs: **Singtel (includes sub-brand GOMO) **StarHub (includes sub-brand Giga!) **M1 **TPG Telecom *MVNOs: **Circles.Life (on M1's network) **Zero1 (on Singtel's network) **MyRepublic (on StarHub's network, on M1's network from 1 Apr 2020) ** Grid Mobile (on Singtel's network) ** redOne (on StarHub's network) ** VIVIFI (on Singtel's network) ** geenet mobile (on M1's network) ** CMLink SG (on Singtel's network) == IXPs == There are currently multiple Internet Exchange Points available in Singapore, \\\\- Singapore Internet Exchange (SGIX) - www.sgix.sg \\\\- Singapore Open Exchange (SOX) -www.sox.net.sg \\\\- Equinix Internet Peering Exchange (EIE) - www.equinix.com see: : Category:Internet exchange points in Singapore ==References== ==External links== *IDA Singapore *Next Generation Nationwide Broadband Network (Next Gen NBN) *Wireless@SG ","title":"Internet in Singapore"},{"id":"11658488","text":"The year 1912 in radio involved some significant events. ==Events== * 15 April - Sinking of the RMS Titanic: CQD and SOS radio distress signals are sent. * 5 July - International Radiotelegraph Convention signed in London. * 13 August - The United States Congress passes the Radio Act of 1912, \\"An Act to regulate radio communication\\", requiring that all radio stations be licensed.Text of the 1912 Act. * 9YV, an experimental station operated by Kansas State University in Manhattan, Kansas, becomes the first radio station in the United States to offer a regularly-scheduled daily broadcast (in morse code) of the weather forecast. ==Births== *16 February ‚Äì Del Sharbutt, American radio and television announcer (died 2002) *24 June ‚Äì Brian Johnston, English cricket commentator and radio presenter (died 1994) *1 July ‚Äì Wallace Greenslade, English radio announcer (died 1961) *5 October ‚Äì Tony Marvin, American radio and television announcer (died 1998) *26 November ‚Äì Eric Sevareid, American radio news reporter (died 1992) *Rita Zucca, Italian American Axis propaganda broadcaster (died 1998) ==References== Category:Radio by year ","title":"1912 in radio"},{"id":"11658510","text":"Girmitiya or Jahajis were indentured Indian labourers whom the British Empire sent to Fiji, Mauritius, South Africa, and the Caribbean (mostly Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, and Jamaica) to work on sugarcane plantations for the benefit of European settlers.

In 1655 he was patronized by Joachim Gersdorff, the royal seneschal. In 1660 he became a professor of philology at the University of Copenhagen and in 1666 of chemistry and botany. Borch was a noted traveller with his three pupils, the sons of Gersdorff, between 1660-1665 he travelled to Holland, where he visited his former pupil Steno, Johann Glauber, Giuseppe Francesco Borri and Comenius. In England he met Robert Boyle and in France he visited Melchis√©dech Th√©venot. His well recorded journals of his travels are an important document of the European scientific climate in the 17th century. Borch is one of the fathers of experimental science in Denmark. It was Borch who first introduced Steno to fossils such as glossopetrae which Borch used, as was common for the time, in medicines. He is the founder of Collegium Mediceum/Borchs Kollegium in central Copenhagen.

He and his wife settled in what is now Cloud County in 1860. In addition to founding the town of Concordia, he is credited with leading the movement to separate what was then Shirley Township from Washington County in 1866. ==Political career== In 1866, the people of Shirley Township sent Hagaman to Governor of Kansas Samuel J. Crawford with the petition requesting the right to organize as a county. The governor granted permission and Shirley Township became Shirley County (later \\"Cloud\\" County). Hagaman was elected county clerk and promptly became a candidate to be the first to represent Shirley County in the Kansas House of Representatives, losing to John B. Rupe. In 1868, he ran again for the Kansas House and this time won, barely defeating a man named Donoho. He later served two terms as Mayor of Concordia from 1878‚Äì1880 and also served five terms on the city council. ==The founding of Concordia== As Hagaman rose to political power in the state of Kansas, he faced political opposition in the town of Clyde, Kansas from several sources. In her book on the history of Concordia, Janet Pease Emery wrote: > Jim Hagaman was done with Clyde. He swore it would never be the county seat. > If it took every ox, cow, and horse he owned, he'd see that the courthouse > went elsewhere ‚Äì even if he had to build a town himself. Madder than hops, > Hagaman took out a claim in Lincoln Township and founded Concordia. ==Newspaper editor== In 1879, Hagaman (along with his son James E. Hagaman) founded The Concordia Blade newspaper, the third local newspaper printed in the town. The paper struggled in its early years, as did the other local publications (The Empire and the Republican). In 1889 he sold out his interest to The Blade Publishing Company. All three papers were later merged to form the Concordia Blade-Empire which is still in publication as of 2013. ==His death== James Hagaman died in Concordia in 1904. Although he had been behind the scenes for over 25 years and in front on both the town council and as the mayor, the city council made no official mention of his passing. Janet Pease Emery's book states \\"Hagaman left life passively, causing not a ripple in the pond where for so many years he was the big fish.\\" Although no one knew how old he was at death, those close to him guessed he was around 73 years old. His widow Mary Hagaman purchased a cemetery plot and presumably buried him there in an unmarked grave. ==Notes== ==References== * Concordia Blade Empire: http://www.bladeempire.com/ * Bell, Rachel Lowrey (1998a).

Six people were killed during these events, which became known as the \\"Mad Dog Killings.\\" A number of others were shot, beaten, or pistol-whipped but survived. Taborsky earned his nickname due to the savagery of the killings that condemned him to death. In 1957 Connecticut package store hours were modified to close from 8:00 pm to 11:00 pm due in part as a response to the crimes of Taborsky and his partner Arthur \\"Meatball\\" Culombe. https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/10/nyregion/one-law-and-the-violent- history-behind-it.html He was executed by electric chair at the age of 36. His execution in 1960 was the last in Connecticut (and in New England) until that of Michael Bruce Ross in 2005. Taborsky donated his body to Yale School of Medicine, and his ashes were later buried in the garden of Christ Church Cathedral. ==First time on death row== Taborsky is an anomaly in Connecticut death penalty lore. He is the only convict sent to death row not once, but twice, for different crimes. Taborsky first came to Connecticut's death row for the 1950 murder of Louis Wolfson, a West Hartford liquor store owner during a robbery. His younger brother Albert, who was also his co-conspirator, testified against Taborsky at the trial in exchange for a life sentence. In prison Albert exhibited signs of mental illness and was institutionalized. Joseph Taborsky, having learned through the prison grapevine that his brother Albert wound up in an insane asylum, appealed his case. In 1955 the Connecticut Supreme Court reversed Taborsky's conviction (and death sentence) because the sole witness against him - Albert - was incurably insane. Because there were no other witnesses to the robbery and murder of Wolfson, Taborsky could not be tried again.This paragraph is taken extensively from the following article that originally appeared in the Hartford Courant: https://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc- xpm-2005-01-02-0501020480-story.html Thus, he was freed from death row, after less than three years in early October 1955. Taborsky appeared appropriately humble, stating, \\"You can't beat the law. From now on, I'm not even going to get a parking ticket.\\" This paragraph is taken extensively from the following article that originally appeared in the Hartford Courant: https://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc- xpm-2005-01-02-0501020480-story.html ==Second time on death row== After his release from prison, Taborsky met another felon, Arthur \\"Meatball\\" Culombe, who would become his accomplice during the \\"Mad Dog Killings\\". In one grocery- store robbery, a 3-year-old girl was running around the store as Taborsky beat her grandparents unconscious. When Taborsky ordered Culombe to shoot the girl, Culombe hid her beneath a deli case, told the girl to be quiet, and fired a shot into the floor. Taborsky left, believing that the girl was dead. Ibid. Because of this incident, his low IQ, and his cooperation with the authorities, Culombe was given a life sentence. Taborsky was sentenced again to die in the electric chair on June 27, 1957. He thereby became the only convict sent to Connecticut's death row on two separate occasions for two separate crimes. On May 17, 1960, Taborsky died at age 36 in the electric chair for the \\"Mad Dog Killings\\". Before his execution, he would also confess to the 1950 murder of Wolfson. https://connecticuthistory.org/joseph-taborsky- and-the-mad-dog-killings/ He would be the final criminal to be executed in the Connecticut \\"Old Sparky\\" electric chair. ==Murder victims== * First murder: ** Louis Wolfson was killed on March 23, 1950 (on Taborsky's 26th birthday).

It was the first commercially successful revolver to use rimfire cartridges instead of loose powder, musket ball, and percussion caps. It is a single-action, tip-up revolver holding seven .22 Short black powder cartridges. ==History== ===Early history=== As Samuel Colt's patent on the revolver was set to expire in 1856, Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson were researching a prototype for a metallic cartridge revolver. When they discovered that a former Colt employee named Rollin White held the patent for a \\"Bored-through\\" cylinder, a component needed for this new invention, the two partners approached White to manufacture a newly designed revolver-and- cartridge combination. Rather than make White a partner in their company, Smith and Wesson paid him a royalty of $0.25 on every \\"Model 1\\" revolver that they made. It would become White's responsibility to defend his patent in any court cases which eventually led to his financial ruin, but was very advantageous for the new Smith & Wesson Company. ==Variants== The Model 1 had three issues or major variants, with each subsequent issue introducing significant technical changes. ===1st Issue=== The 1st Issue of the Model 1 was the first major iteration (and the least common), with approximately 12,000 produced over a three-year period. The features that easily distinguish the 1st issue are the flared, square cornered shaped grip (also seen in the 2nd Issue), the small round side plate, the round profile of the frame between the back of the cylinder and the grip, a split articulated hammer, and the flat spring barrel latch seen in some early variants. There are six known variations of the Model 1, first identified in an article by John Kountz in the April 1956 issue of \\"The Gun Report\\". In this article, Kountz noted specific differences in the recoil shield, the barrel latch (the first two variations used a dart style flat spring catch, while later variations used a larger bayonet release), the rifling and other subtle differences. Serial numbers were issued sequentially for the Model 1 1st Issues ranging from 1 through approximately 12,000. ===2nd Issue=== The 2nd Issue of the Model 1 looks similar to the 1st Issue, with several notable differences. The side plate on the 2nd Issue is much larger and irregularly shaped. The profile of the frame is flatter (a likely concession for manufacturing efficiency), and the hammer is one piece. Model 1 2nd Issues retain the flared, square cornered shaped grip and the octagonal tip-up style frame, and at first glance the two issues are easy to confuse. There are several variations of the 2nd Issue guns. Variants between serial numbers 12,000 through to about 20,000 involve the shape of the side plate (\\"straight\\" or \\"round\\"), the design of the trigger spring (flat spring, V spring or coil spring), and the number of patent dates on the cylinder (two or three). There was also a decrease in the size of the barrel roll stamps at around serial number 95,000. 2nd Issue marked \\"2D QUAL'TY\\" are also seen occasionally. There were approximately 110,000 2nd Issues produced from 1860 through 1868, with serial numbers ranging from approximately 12,000 (following the 1st Issue) through to approximately 120,000. ===3rd Issue=== Model One Third issue. Open for loading Lock of Smith & Wesson Model One Third variation with side plate removed. The mainspring is under tension from a screw in the low-front grip frame as on modern S&W; revolvers. The Model 1, 3rd Issue represented a substantial redesign for the Model 1, with a fluted cylinder, a round barrel and a rounded \\"bird's head\\" style grip. Finishes included full nickel plating, full blued steel, and a \\"half plate\\" nickel/blue combo, and there were two barrel lengths offered by the factory. Variants include the \\"square\\" and \\"triangular\\" top strap design that changed around serial number 9,500. The 3rd Issue guns were produced from 1868 through 1882 with serial numbers from 1 through approximately 131,000. ==Popularity== The Model 1 was in popular demand with the outbreak of the American Civil War as soldiers from all ranks on both sides of the conflict made private purchases of the revolvers for self-defense. So much that orders for the Model 1 revolver outpaced the factory's production capabilities, forcing Smith & Wesson to expand into a new facility and began experimenting with a new cartridge design more suitable than the .22 Short in 1860. This popularity led to numerous knockoffs and patent infringements by other armsmakers. Rolin White and S&W; brought infringement cases against Manhattan Firearms Company, Ethan Allen, Merwin & Bray, National Arms Company and others. The courts mostly allowed these manufacturers to continue production runs, with a royalty on each revolver paid to White. In some cases, Smith & Wesson bought the revolvers back to remark and sell; these are marked \\"APRIL 3 1855\\" as a patent date. ==See also== * Smith & Wesson Model 2 * Smith & Wesson Model 1 1/2 * Smith & Wesson Model No. 2 Army * Smith & Wesson Model 3 * Smith & Wesson Safety Hammerless ==References== ==External links== * Smith & Wesson Model No. 1, Third Issue * Smith & Wesson‚Äôs First Revolver: The Model 1 * Smith & Wesson Tip Up Revolvers‚ÄîChapter III * Smith & Wesson No. 1 1st Issue revolver w/ Original Gutta Percha Case * Look at Smith & Wesson Mod.

Harvey; and commissioned on 9 June 1944, Lt. (jg.) Robert Mac-Ross, USNR, in command. Initially assigned to the 3rd Naval District, YMS-446 operated in the Staten Island, New York area until 23 July 1945 when she got underway for California. She arrived at Newport Beach, California, on 22 August; and, in September, was routed farther west. From 25 September to 11 October, she conducted exercises out of Pearl Harbor; then continued on across the Pacific. On 2 November, she arrived at Fukuoka, Japan; and, for the remainder of the year, cleared shipping lanes to that northern Ky≈´sh≈´ manufacturing port. During January and February 1946, she conducted similar minesweeping operations off the northern coast of the Inland Sea to ensure safe passage to and from Kure. She completed her postwar sweeping duties in mid-February and, on the 28th, departed Japan. YMS-446 then steamed east. After stops in the Marianas, the Marshalls, and the Hawaiian Islands, she arrived at San Pedro, California, on 14 April; and, in May, put into Charleston, South Carolina. During July and August, she underwent overhaul; then, because of personnel shortages, she remained immobilized into December. Early in 1947, the YMS departed Charleston for Key West, Florida, but returned in February. On the 17th, she was redesignated Sanderling (AMS-35)). On the 18th, she got underway for fleet maneuvers off Puerto Rico; but, later in the day, collided with a Norwegian merchant ship and was towed to Norfolk, Virginia, for repairs. In May, she returned to Charleston; and, two months later, she moved south to conduct operations off Florida for the Mine Countermeasure Station, Panama City, Florida. In November, she returned to South Carolina for indefinite berthing at the Minecraft Base at Charleston. In May 1948, Sanderling resumed operations along the east and Gulf Coasts, from Newfoundland to the Mississippi River and in the Caribbean. Based at Norfolk and then at Charleston, she operated primarily from Hampton Roads, Virginia, south for the next nine years; participating in type and fleet exercises and providing services for the Operational Development Force. During that period, she was redesignated twice: to AMCU-49, effective 1 February 1955; and to MHC-49, effective7 February 1955. In mid-September 1957, she arrived at Green Cove Springs, Florida, and joined the Reserve Fleet. Two months later, on 14 November, she was decommissioned. Sanderling remained berthed at Green Cove Springs until struck from the Navy List on 1 November 1959. ==Awards and honors== YMS-446 earned one battle star for her post-World War II minesweeping operations. == See also == * List of United States Navy ships == References == * == External links == * * HyperWar: US Navy Minecraft, 1940-1945 Category:PCS-1376-class minesweepers Category:YMS-1-class minesweepers of the United States Navy Category:Ships built in City Island, Bronx Category:1944 ships Category:World War II minesweepers of the United States Category:Harkness-class minehunters Category:Cold War minehunters of the United States ","title":"USS Sanderling (AMCU-49)"},{"id":"11658631","text":"Petalura ingentissima, the giant petaltail, has been described as the world's largest dragonfly, with a wingspan of 160 mm.

Emilia is the stepmother to Jack's remarkably intelligent eight-year-old son, William Woolf. William lives primarily with his mother, the medical doctor Carolyn Soule. It is Emilia's job, however, to pick up William from his nursery school every Wednesday afternoon. When she picks him up, Emilia is often subjected to snide glances and whispers from the other mothers because, it transpires, her relationship with her husband began when he was still with his wife. They had an office affair, and eventually the marriage dissolved. Later, the reader discovers that Emilia and Jack have recently lost their daughter, Isabel. They kept the little girl for 3 days, then she died during the night of SIDS in her mother's arms after being fed. The bulk of the story deals with the results of Isabel's death, including the strain this puts on Emilia and Jack's marriage, as well as Emilia's feelings towards William. Emilia does not particularly like William (in fact, she describes him as \\"insufferable\\" early on in the story), but tries to be a good parent to him. This is hindered by the fact that William serves as his mother's mouthpiece, and sometimes speaks in a very matter-of-fact way about Isabel's death. ==Film adaptation== A film adaptation of the novel has been made with Natalie Portman starring in the lead role. The film was directed by Don Roos and also starred Scott Cohen and Charlie Tahan.

Dubbed a stone frigate, HMCS Chippawa is a land-based naval establishment for part-time sailors as well as a local recruitment centre for the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN). She is the furthest inland unit of all 24 naval reserve divisions located in major cities across Canada. She was first formed in February 1923 as the Winnipeg Company Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve (RCNVR) and then in 1941 as HMCS Chippawa. == Namesake == HMCS Chippawa is named after a British mercantile schooner called HMS Chippawa that saw action against the Americans at the Battle of Lake Erie on 10 September 1813. The ship itself was named after the Ojibwe Indigenous ethnic group (Chippewa being an anglicized adaptation) which inhabited the area near the Saulte at the west end of Lake Superior. ==History== ===Formation (1923-1941)=== The division was originally formed on 19 March 1923 as the Winnipeg Company of the Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve, later renamed The Winnipeg Division in 1936. In 1941, the division was commissioned HMCS Chippawa. The first commanding officer of the division was Eustace Brock,HMCS Chippawa History Page the Assistant Secretary of the Great-West Life Assurance Company. In March 1923 the unit's first quarters were a small office and a classroom located in McGregor Armouries. Later, in the spring of 1924 the division moved into the Rat-Portage Lumber Company building in Norwood, which is still standing today as the Poulin's Exterminators building. In the years following, the division moved to the old St Matthews Church on the corner of Sherbrook Street and Ellice Avenue, to a condemned fire hall on Gertrude Avenue just off Osborne Street (now demolished), to space at the Security Storage building on Ellice Avenue, and then in October 1942 to the old Winnipeg Winter Club located at 51 Smith Street. === Cold War (1945‚Äì1989) === Anchor statue outside of the Naval Museum of Manitoba In the spring of 1950 the Red and Assiniboine Rivers overflowed their banks and threatened Winnipeg. Thousands of citizens had to be evacuated from their homes and sent to neighbouring towns and provinces. Chippawa became the centreCBC Digital Archives of flood-fighting activities and naval personnel, both Regular and Reserve, were sent to Winnipeg from all over the country and lived on board Chippawa for several weeks. The ship's galley was activated and within 48 hours was serving 1,500 meals a day to the flood fighters. Chippawas Main Drill Deck served as a marshalling area for motor boats and other marine craft used during the flood. In the early 1950s a polio epidemic hit the city and Chippawas facilities were once again pressed into service. Chippawas heated swimming pool was used for therapy for polio victims for close to two years following the epidemic. During the 1960s Chippawa participated in Canada's Centennial by building an authentic York boat on the drill deck of Chippawa, and later launched and named her Chippawa II. In 1967, Chippawa provided facilities and support for the Pan-American Games hosted by Winnipeg. It was during this decade that HMCS Chippawa grew to be the largest of all the 21 Naval Reserve divisions with more than 300 members of ship's company, comprising all ranks. A reorganization of military bands left the Chippawa band as one of the few remaining official Naval Reserve bands in Canada. Lately, the manning of the s has caused many of Chippawa trained personnel to leave Winnipeg to commission and man the ships. This has caused challenges to the recruiting system, to replace these people as fast as they depart. ===Post-Cold War (1990-present)=== In the spring of 1997, Manitoba endured another flood. Chippawa became the home for nearly 200 naval reservists from units across Canada. Chippawas galley put out thousands of meals for the flood fighters, her classrooms became accommodations, and her main deck became a parking lot and repair area for boats of all shapes and sizes. The reserve sailors were tasked to flooded areas all across southern Manitoba. In the flooded areas just south of Winnipeg, the reservists were instrumental in saving many homes in the area of Grande Pointe and South St. Mary's Road. At the end of the emergency the Commander of Maritime Operations Group Four, Captain Forcier, told all reserves in Chippawa that in the areas just south of Winnipeg \\"he had witnessed the finest example of seamanship he had ever seen, Regular Force or Reserve.\\" Nelson, p. 213 In summer of 1998, the old Winnipeg Winter Club building was demolished and a new building was built on the same site. While the building was being built the division paraded in Hangar 11 at 17 Wing Winnipeg.

In 1994, Collins took his first coaching job as an assistant to Jeff Capel II with the Old Dominion Monarchs. ==Coaching career== He left Old Dominion after one season to join the coaching staff at Hampton. As a part of the Pirates' staff, Collins helped a program that was transitioning to Division I upon his arrival become a constant presence at the top of the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference. This rise to the top reached its apex with back-to-back MEAC tournament titles in 2001 and 2002.

While Collins was still able to be competitive with the Pirates, he was never able to quite match the same high level of success set by Merfeld. Hampton won 19 games in Collins' first season, a school record for most wins by a first- year coach, but fell just short of a third consecutive MEAC title with a loss to South Carolina State in the MEAC championship game. The Pirates returned to the MEAC title game in 2005, but again fell short, this time falling to Delaware State. Collins was, however, named the MEAC Coach of the Year for his efforts. In 2006, after finishing in a tie for 5th during the regular season, the Pirates made a surprise run through the MEAC tournament and won their third MEAC title, and their first with Collins at the helm. However, their 16-15 record before the NCAA tournament sent Hampton to the opening-round game in Dayton, Ohio, where the Pirates were eliminated by Monmouth. Just two days after the loss, Collins resigned as the head coach of the Hampton Pirates. ===Winston-Salem State=== Collins returned to his home state in September 2006 when he was hired to lead the Winston-Salem State Rams in their first season of Division I competition. In his first season with the Rams, playing as an independent with a schedule mostly of road games, Collins managed a 5-24 record. The 2007‚Äì2008 season, Collins' second with the team, marked the Rams' first season of MEAC competition. In 2010, Winston-Salem State returned to Division II, where the Rams had four-straight winning seasons and two NCAA tournament appearances. ===Maryland Eastern Shore=== On April 8, 2014, Collins accepted the head coaching job at Maryland Eastern Shore, returning to coaching in the MEAC with the third different team in his career. 2014-2015 \\"Win Today\\" Results: \\\\- 100% Graduation Ratehttp://www.umeshawks.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec- rel/032515aaa.html \\\\- Best WINNING season in 41 years \\\\- From 6-24 (.200) to 18-15 (.545): 34.5% improvement \\\\- 3-1 (.750) in the Atlantic 10 Conferencehttp://www.delmarvanow.com/story/sports/college/2014/12/28/umes- defeats-school/20977393/ \\\\- 11-5 (.687) in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference MEAChttp://espn.go.com/mens-college- basketball/conferences/standings/_/id/16/meac-conference \\\\- 2015 CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament (first in 30 years)http://www.wboc.com/story/28562468/historic-season-comes-to-an-end-for- umes \\\\- MEAC Coach of the Yearhttp://www.delmarvanow.com/story/sports/college/2015/03/06/collins-andino- win-meac-awards/24541309/ \\\\- MEAC Rookie of the Year: Ryan Andinohttp://www.hamptonpirates.com/news/2015/3/6/MBB_0306151459.aspx \\\\- Riley Wallace National Player of the Year: Mike Myershttp://hbcusports.com/2015/04/10/umes-player-of-the-year-mike-myers-to- play-in-basketball-summit/ http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/college/basketball/mens/bal-rise-of-f-mike- myers-has-raised-3point-prowess-for-umes-mens-basketball-20141210-story.html \\\\- The Ben Jobe Award National Coach of the Yearhttp://www.benjobeaward.com \\\\- The Hugh Durham Award National Coach of the Year Finalisthttp://www.bigskyconf.com/news/2015/4/3/MBB_0403154413.aspx On March 26, 2018, Collins contract with Maryland Eastern Shore was not renewed after 4 seasons. ==Personal== Collins, a Southern Pines, North Carolina native, played four years for the Eastern Kentucky University Colonels and played professional basketball in Helsinki, Finland.Bobby Collins - Winston-Salem State ==Head coaching record== ==Notes== : Winston-Salem State became a transitional member of NCAA Division I in 2006 and was ineligible for postseason competition until the 2010‚Äì11 season.

Among the difficulties that Afghanistan, together with other developing countries, faces is the shortage of local investment capital. Accordingly, the government offers considerable inducements in the third five-year plan to investors in the private sector. Capital goods for approved industries can be imported free; there is an income-tax holiday for three years after production started; and import tariffs on a protective scale are to shelter locally produced goods from foreign competition. These measures are designed to minimize direct government participation in the sphere of light industry, so that funds can be made available for the completion of projects begun during the second plan and for additional investment in heavy industry. During 1967 about 131 development projects are underwritten at a cost of 5 billion Afghanis. These fall into three main groups: mines and industry; irrigation and agriculture; and communications and social services. But in general, emphasis is placed on consolidation. A major objective of the government is to reduce by degrees excessive dependence upon foreign aid for national development. This is likely to take some time, particularly since such aid is readily available from the U.S.S.R., the United States, and the World Bank, to say nothing of West Germany, Britain, and China. Additional assistance in such projects as match manufacture, tanning, shoe manufacture, and furniture making comes from Sweden and France. All this does not change the traditional Afghan determination to treat other nations as friends but not as masters, and to retain complete control over domestic and foreign policies. An example of this is the vesting of the new internal air services linking Kabul with many formerly remote areas in the official Afghan Air Authority. Relations with Pakistan ease further, along with an increase in trade. ==Incumbents== * Monarch - Mohammed Zahir Shah * Prime Minister - ** until 11 October - Mohammad Hashim Maiwandwal ** 11 October-1 November - Abdullah Yaqta ** starting 1 November - Mohammad Nur Ahmad Etemadi ==March 28, 1967== Maiwandwal meets with U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson during a visit to Washington, D.C. ==May 1967== The Soviet head of state, Nikolai Podgorny, pays a visit to witness the opening of the Soviet-aided Naghlu Dam. ==October 11, 1967== Prime Minister Maiwandwal resigns for health reasons, the king asking Abdullah Yaqta, Minister of State, to assume the premiership ad interim pending the formation of a new government. Maiwandwal's resignation is widely regretted, since he is looked upon as one of the main architects of the new Afghanistan. He successfully concluded the second five-year development plan and launched the third; he won national confidence in the 1964 constitution, which liberalized the political structure of the country; his visits abroad strengthened Afghanistan's international position and its traditional policy of friendship without involvement. He eased relations with Pakistan and gave a new impetus to the growth of trade between the two countries. Only a few days after Maiwandwal's resignation, the king takes the final step to complete the structure of the government as contemplated in the 1964 constitution by inaugurating the Supreme Court. This body, consisting of eight judges presided over by Abdul Hakim Ziayee, a prominent jurist with experience in diplomacy, completes the separation of powers among the Executive, the Legislature, and the Judiciary. ==November 1, 1967== Nur Ahmad Etemadi, First Deputy Premier and Foreign Minister, is appointed Prime Minister. Etemadi, a firm believer in his predecessor's domestic and foreign policies, retains the foreign portfolio and otherwise makes few changes in the personnel of the cabinet. ==References== Afghanistan Category:Years of the 20th century in Afghanistan Afghanistan ","title":"1967 in Afghanistan"},{"id":"11658884","text":"Deborah Jane Lawrie (born 14 May 1953), known as Deborah Wardley while married, was the first woman to become a pilot with a major Australian airline after winning a landmark sex discrimination case against Ansett Airlines. ==Early life and education== Deborah Lawrie was born in Sydney and her family later moved to Melbourne. She graduated with a degree in science from the University of Melbourne in 1974 and in education from Rusden State College in 1975. She taught high school mathematics and science from 1975 to 1977. She obtained a private pilot licence in 1971 (aged 18) and a commercial pilot licence in 1973. She logged 2600 flying hours and became a general aviation flying instructor and charter pilot in 1976. ==Case against Ansett== Lawrie first applied to Ansett Airlines in 1976 and kept sending applications for two years. During that time, 10 fellow male flying instructors were accepted into the Ansett pilot training program. She was finally interviewed in 1978 but was rejected. She took the case to the then new Victorian Equal Opportunity Board under the equivalent direct discrimination provisions of the Victorian Equal Opportunity Act 1977, and challenged Ansett's rejection under recently enacted equal opportunity legislation. Having married days before the case began, she chose to use her married name in the case.

Reg Ansett denied the allegation of discrimination but admitted that it was his strong personal view that women were not suited to be airline pilots.Maloney, Shane and Grosz, Chris.

(2010). 4.'To Demand Equality is to Lack Ambition': Sex discrimination Legislation‚ÄîContexts and Contradictions1. Sex Discrimination in Uncertain Times, 93. Chicago In a letter to the secretary of the Women's Electoral Lobby, the general manager of Ansett wrote: : \\"Ansett has adopted a policy of only employing men as pilots. This does not mean that women cannot be good pilots, but we are concerned with the provision of the safest and most efficient air service possible. In this regard, we feel that an all-male pilot crew is safer than one in which the sexes are mixed.\\" Ansett raised a number of objections to the employment of women as pilots, including: * That pilots needed strength, even though there was no strength test for pilots * That unions would object * That women's menstrual cycles made them unsuitable * Pregnancy and childbirth would disrupt a woman's career to the point where it would jeopardise safety and incur extra costs for the company. This was Ansett's main legal argument. The Victorian Equal Opportunity Board ruled that Ansett's refusal to employ Wardley was illegal. It awarded damages of $14,500 and ordered Ansett to include her in its next pilot training program. Ansett delayed its training intake and appealed to the Supreme Court of Victoria but the appeal was dismissed. Ansett appealed the Supreme Court decision to the High Court of Australia in October 1979, but employed Wardley from 5 November pending the outcome of the case. During classroom training, Ansett attempted to sack her by claiming she had been at fault in a near-miss incident at Moorabbin Airport despite an inquiry exonerating her and identifying the other pilot as at fault. Ansett backed down after unions stepped in. When classroom training was completed in December 1979, she was not assigned to training aircraft despite the male trainees progressing to flight training. Ansett Airlines had been taken over by Peter Abeles and Rupert Murdoch in late 1979. Wardley had previously trained Murdoch's brother in law, John Calvert-Jones, to fly. She telephoned Calvert-Jones in early January 1980 informing him of the situation. Two days later Rupert Murdoch issued a memo directing that she was to be treated the same as the male pilot candidates. She commenced flight training immediately and made her first commercial flight co-piloting a Fokker F27 from Alice Springs to Darwin on 22 January 1980. The High Court dismissed Ansett's appeal in March 1980..Scutt, J. A. (2003). Without Precedent-Sex/Gender Discrimination in the High Court. Alternative LJ, 28, 74.

She was one of 1,640 pilots who resigned en masse following the 1989 Australian pilots' dispute. She briefly returned to teaching and had her first child, Thomas, in January 1991. She published her autobiography in 1992. In 1993 she moved to the Netherlands and joined KLM as a Fokker 50 pilot. In 1994 she became a Fokker 50 instructor. In 1998 she became Flight Safety Manager and Chief Flight Safety Investigator for KLM Cityhopper. Until 2007 she was also a senior Airbus A330 captain with KLM. Now divorced, she has resumed using the name Deborah Lawrie. After reaching the mandatory retirement age for airline pilots in Europe, Lawrie returned to Australia in 2008. She joined Jetstar Airways as Safety Investigations Manager and occasional pilot to maintain her Airbus A320 type rating. In July 2012 she joined Tigerair Australia and was an Airbus A320 Captain and instructor. Lawrie was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in the 2019 Queen's Birthday Honours in recognition of her \\"significant service to aviation as a commercial pilot, and to women in the profession\\".

In domestic affairs the year is marked by a thorough overhaul of the judicial system by the new Supreme Court; this involves reorganizing the powers and functions of the lower courts in line with the requirements of the constitution. In economic affairs the policies laid down in 1967 for encouraging investors in the private sector by substantial inducements - tax holidays, free import of capital goods, and protective tariffs - are continued. Government investment is again directed to the completion of projects begun under the second development plan and to the encouragement of heavy industry. The emphasis is again on consolidation rather than on beginning new projects, and on the gradual replacement of foreign aid by increased exploitation of national resources. ==Incumbents== * Monarch - Mohammed Zahir Shah * Prime Minister - Mohammad Nur Ahmad Etemadi ==End of January 1968== The Soviet Premier, Alexei Kosygin, visits Kabul.

Afghanistan Category:Years of the 20th century in Afghanistan Afghanistan ","title":"1968 in Afghanistan"},{"id":"11658914","text":"your bitcoinThe following lists events that happened during 1969 in Afghanistan. Domestically, the year is one of quiet administrative and economic progress. The division of powers among the executive, the legislature, and the judiciary laid down in the 1964 constitution, although virtually completed in 1968, entails much detailed work in its precise application to existing institutions. This is especially true in the judicial field, where the structure and functions of the lower courts, previously shaped largely by tradition, are found to need considerable alteration. The changes necessitated in this, as in other branches of the administration, are effected with little friction, due to the popularity of the prime minister and to the steady support which he receives from the king. In the economic field, the policy of mobilizing local resources to replace by degrees the massive foreign aid furnished by the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. continues in accordance with Afghan determination to avoid undue dependence on external help. The main difficulty lies in the shortage of capital for investment in the private sector; and in spite of the inducements proffered by the government growth is slow. In foreign affairs, the traditional Afghan desire to preserve complete autonomy regardless of external aid and to maintain friendly relations with other countries remains dominant. India's desire for close relations is shown by a visit from Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and by Indian aid in the restoration of the Bamiyan antiquities. Relations with Pakistan and with its new government after the fall of President Mohammad Ayub Khan are correct rather than cordial because of continued Afghan support for the promotion of Pakhtunistan. This support again becomes vocal when the Pakistan government incorporates the states of Dir, Swat, and Chitral, hitherto domestically autonomous, into the administrative structure of West Pakistan, in accordance, it is claimed, with the wishes of the states' peoples. The resulting resentment in Afghanistan does not last, and the country's policy of friendly neutrality toward both the Communist and non-Communist worlds continues smoothly. ==Incumbents== * Monarch - Mohammed Zahir Shah * Prime Minister - Mohammad Nur Ahmad Etemadi ==May 1969== Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin arrives to attend the country's 50th independence day celebrations. ==Early June 1969== As Afghanistan does not escape the worldwide spread of radical ideas among the student population, the government finds it necessary to close Kabul University temporarily because of student unrest. Secondary schools in the capital are also shut, but there are no serious disturbances. ==29 August - 11 September 1969== Afghanistan holds its second free parliamentary election since the introduction of the constitution in 1964, with candidates standing for the 216 seats of the House of the People and for one-third of the House of Elders. Many conservative local landowners who have shunned the first election campaign for office and win seats. Often they win at the expense of more liberal, national-minded incumbents; the new parliament, thus, is more conservative than the previous one. Since political parties were not legalized in time for the elections, most of the candidates are men of local prominence again chosen for their personal prestige rather than their political views. Turnout is much higher than in 1965, but still only about 50%; except in times of national crisis political life is so highly localized that interest in central institutions remains minimal, although in Kabul and its environs live broadcasts of the proceedings in Parliament, which result in the confirmation (as required by the 1964 constitution) of Prime Minister Nur Ahmad Etemadi and his new cabinet, attract large crowds of listeners.

It ran from September 6, 2007 to September 15, 2007. The lineup consisted of 349 films from 55 countries, selected from 4156 submissions. The selection included 275 mid- to feature-length films, of which 234 were premieres, with 71 by first-time directors. The festival was attended by members of the industry, press and general public. It opened with the world premiere of Jeremy Podeswa's Fugitive Pieces, a film based on the international bestselling novel by Anne Michaels, and closed with Paolo Barzman's Emotional Arithmetic. ==Film reception== Critical favourites included No Country for Old Men, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly and 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days which were equally well received at the Cannes Film Festival, plus the Joy Division biopic Control which, along with the eponymously titled documentary on the band, Joy Division, was picked up by The Weinstein Company. Peter Howell of the Toronto Star named Sidney Lumet's Before the Devil Knows You're Dead a major Oscar contender. The audience favourite, David Cronenberg's Eastern Promises, won the top prize at the festival. The New York Times pointed out that two previous winners had gone on to win Best Picture Oscars.Best Picture winners American Beauty and Chariots of Fire had both previously won the People's Choice Award. Highly discussed but divisive films among the public and critics include comedies Juno and Margot at the Wedding, the Bob Dylan biopic I'm Not There and Brian De Palma's Iraq War documentary Redacted. Films expected to stir controversy for their transgressive sexual content, such as Ang Lee's Lust, Caution, Alan Ball's Nothing Is Private and Martin Gero's Young People Fucking, did divide audiences but without fanfare. The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford and Across the Universe both won their share of supporters despite previous reports of shooting delays and director-studio clashes. ==Awards== * Chris Chong Chan Fui's Pool (Kolam) won the Award for Best Canadian Short Film * St√©phane Lafleur's Continental, a Film Without Guns won the Citytv Award for Best Canadian First Feature Film * Guy Maddin's My Winnipeg won the Toronto-City Award for Best Canadian Feature Film * Israel C√°rdenas and Laura Amelia Guzm√°n's Cochochi won the DIESEL Discovery Award * Anah√≠ Berneri's Encarnaci√≥n won the Artistic Innovation Award * Rodrigo Pl√°'s La Zona won the Prize of the International Critics (FIPRESCI Prize) * David Cronenberg's Eastern Promises won the Cadillac People's Choice Award ** Jason Reitman's Juno was first runner-up ** Ellen Spiro and Phil Donahue's Body of War was second runner-up In addition, film director and historian Peter Bogdanovich was awarded the International Federation of Film Archives Award for his contribution towards film preservation.

Progress in establishing a modern type of administration throughout the country to replace traditional tribal institutions is steady rather than spectacular. The personal popularity of the king and his firm support of the prime minister ensures growing respect for the central government, but this does not prevent occasional outbreaks of severe intertribal hostilities. An important factor in the modernizing process to which the king has committed himself is the steady improvement of communications with the outside world. Several international airlines call regularly at Kabul, and the road from the capital to the Khyber Pass carries increasingly heavy traffic in both directions. The tourist industry receives a great impetus both from the erection on the road between Kabul and Paghman of a luxury hotel with spectacular views, and from the readiness with which the Afghan diplomatic posts in many countries grant tourist visas. External communications are stimulated by a marked improvement in relations with Pakistan. The Afghan government shows increasing interest in the economic success of the Regional Cooperation for Development program (RCD), which is being vigorously pursued by Pakistan, Iran, and Turkey; a visit to Kabul by the Pakistan finance minister, Nawab Muzaffar Ali Khan Qizilbash, leads to a scheme for technical aid in the fields of irrigation, seeds, and fertilizers to help Afghanistan achieve agricultural self-sufficiency as part of its policy of decreasing its reliance on external aid. ==Incumbents== * Monarch - Mohammed Zahir Shah * Prime Minister - Mohammad Nur Ahmad Etemadi Afghanistan Category:Years of the 20th century in Afghanistan Afghanistan ","title":"1970 in Afghanistan"},{"id":"11658970","text":"The Cold Spring Historic District is a historic district that includes much of the central area of the Hudson River Cold Spring village in Putnam County, New York. It is roughly bounded by Main Street (in the northeastern portion of the village the eastern end of NY 301), Cedar (NY 9D) and Fair streets and Paulding Avenue. It gives Cold Spring its quaint character and has been described as \\"one of the best-preserved 19th century townscapes in the Hudson River region\\".Village of Cold Spring, 2003, COLD SPRING HISTORIC DISTRICT; retrieved June 7, 2007. A consultants' report for the village's 1987 master plan quotes the National Register of Historic Places saying, upon adding the district in 1982: Most of the houses, churches and other buildings came into existence in the years before the Civil War, when the nearby West Point Foundry was at the peak of its production and workers were rapidly moving into the area. Today the district includes over 200 buildings, many of them contributing properties. They have helped transform the village into a popular upscale residence for commuters and weekend destination for New York City residents due to the nearby Metro-North train station offering easy access to Grand Central Terminal. ==2005 lawsuit== Like some other municipalities with federally designated historic districts, Cold Spring has added sections to its zoning code to preserve that character. In 2005, a resident, Donald Lusk, filed suit in federal court against the village after it cited him for nonconforming signs he had put up in front of his house in protest of a proposed nearby condominium development. The case went all the way to appeals court, which decided in 2007 that his First Amendment rights had been violated by the process by which his signs were judged nonconforming, which partly considered the content of those signs. However, the ordinances dictating the size, shape and placement of the signs themselves were upheld as permissible regulations of the time, place and manner of speech.Lusk v.

It is endemic to Florida in the United States. == Anatomy and Appearance == Libellula jesseana adults are about 5 centimeters long. The male is pruinescent blue on the thorax and abdomen with orange wings. The female may have a similar coloration to the male, or have a golden hue overall identical to Libellula auripennis, the golden-winged skimmer. == Distribution and habitat == Libellula jesseana is limited to ten counties in the panhandle and northern peninsula of Florida. There is a protected population at Gold Head Branch State Park in Clay County. Most other populations receive no protection. Libellula jesseana occurs at infertile, clear, sandy-bottomed lakes with shoreline stands of maidencane (Panicum hemitomon) and sometimes sedges and St. John's worts. The adults require open woodland or shrub-land nearby for foraging. Libellula jesseana. NatureServe. 2012. == Life history == Purple skimmer nymphs feed on nearly all small invertebrate organisms in their aquatic environment, and the adults catch insects that they locate visually. Adult purple skimmers are diurnal. The life cycle last approximately one year, with nymphs over-wintering and adults flying from mid-April through mid- September. == Conservation == Libellula jesseana is threatened due to habitat degradation related to human population growth in Florida. Much of the habitat is threatened by processes such as eutrophication due to pollution from septic tanks and fertilizers, and groundwater depletion due to irrigation. In degraded wetlands, the common L. auripennis may outcompete the rare L. jesseana. The long term population trend expectation is a decline of 30-70% of the population. The NatureServe conservation status for this species is critically imperiled. == References == Category:Libellulidae Category:Odonata of North America Category:Endemic fauna of Florida Category:Insects of the United States Category:Insects described in 1922 ","title":"Libellula jesseana"},{"id":"11659065","text":"The umuduri is a Burundian and Rwandan stringed instrument. It is a musical bow consisting of a string supported by a flexible wooden string bearer or bow that is 125‚Äì135 cm in length. The string is traditionally made from plant fiber and animal gut, however, metal wire is becoming widespread. ==Construction and design== A gourd is attached to the bow to act as a resonator. A wooden stick and the inzebe rattle are also used. Two loops bring the string closer to the bow, the third (attached to the gourd resonator by a cord) divides the string into two unequal lengths. This creates two different notes, usually a fourth or a fifth, as fundamental notes. To keep the resonator and the musical bow apart, a cloth or a pad of banana peel is placed between the two to ensure that there is no direct contact between the bow and the gourd that might interfere with sound production. ==Playing technique== To play the instrument, the bow is held in the left hand vertically in front of the body and the gourd is pressed against the body. A thin stick, used to strike the string, and an inzebe rattle are held in the right hand. In addition to the two fundamental notes that the string produces, the upper (longer) part of the string can be shortened using the index or middle finger, resulting in three notes: second/fourth or fifth. ==Cultural significance== The umuduri is made by the Twa but used by the Hutu. Along with the ikembe, the umuduri was introduced to Rwanda in the early twentieth century. It is played at festivals and official ceremonies; such as the ikinimba, which is a dance accompanied by instruments to tell the stories of kings and heroes of Rwanda.

He was awarded a civil CBE in the 1946 New Year Honours. == Biography == William Kelly Wallace was born in 1883 and educated privately. He joined the Midland Railway Northern Counties Committee (NCC) railway in Ireland in 1906, after three years of practical training. He gained knowledge as a railway engineering, particularly in bridges inspecting all 228 bridges from Belfast to Londonderry in 1910. In 1919 he an assistant engineer to Bowman Malcolm. Although primarily a civil engineer, he was appointed to the joint positions of Locomotive Engineer and Civil Engineer on the NCC in 1922 when Bowman Malcolm retired. In 1924 he became chief engineer, a position he held till 1930. In collaboration with the Manager, James Pepper, he initiated a renewal programme in which, not only were new locomotives built, but suitable classes of older locomotives would be \\"heavily rebuilt\\", in the main following the style of the Midland Railway and, later, the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). As Civil Engineer, Wallace took over the task of completing the new bridge across the River Bann at Coleraine, County Londonderry from Bowman Malcolm. This opened for traffic in March 1924. He oversaw the installation of colour light signalling at York Road station, Belfast which was commissioned in 1926. This was the first of its kind in Ireland and among the earliest large installations in the United Kingdom. Wallace devised an innovative method of constructing reinforced concrete bridges using T-section pre-cast concrete beams carried on reinforced concrete piers. Four beams created the bridge deck on to which ballasted track could be directly laid. In September 1930 he left the NCC to become Chief Stores Superintendent (Euston) on the LMS. In 1934 he became Chief Civil Engineer. Wallace was an advocate of British Standard track and flat-bottom rails and among the works he carried out were extensive trials of flat-bottom track with two types of baseplate on the former Midland and Caledonian mainlines. He also initiated an assessment of continuously welded rail (CWR). In 1946 he designed the Adam Viaduct, the first prestressed concrete railway bridge in the United Kingdom. In 1948 he left the railway service.William Kelly Wallace: Chief Civil Engineer, London, Midland and Scottish Railway - National Archives Wallace was known for having a dry sense of humour and was popular with his colleagues. He was appointed President of the Institution of Civil Engineers for 1955‚Äì56, after being on its council and committees for 11 years. In 1949 he chaired the first meeting of its associated society, the British Geotechnical Society, and he received an honorary doctorate of science from Queen's University, Belfast in 1956. William Kelly Wallace died in Surrey in May 1969. == References == == Further reading == * Currie, J.R.L.

Greater opportunities for women in education have further encouraged their involvement in politics. The most prominent Muslim female leaders are former prime minister of Pakistan Benazir Bhutto (served 1988‚Äì1990 and 1993‚Äì1996), Indonesian President Megawati Sukarnoputri (became president 2001), former Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller (served 1993‚Äì1995), former Senegalese Prime Minister Mame Madior Boye (appointed 2001), Bangladeshi Prime Ministers Khaleda Zia (served 1991‚Äì96 and 2001‚Äì06) and Sheikh Hasina Wajed (served 1996‚Äì01 and 2009‚Äìpresent), former Iranian Vice President Masoumeh Ebtekar (served 1997‚Äì2005), former Malian Prime Minister Ciss√© Mariam Ka√Ødama Sidib√© (served 2011‚Äì12), Kosovan President Atifete Jahjaga (served 2011‚Äì16), former President of Mauritius Ameenah Gurib (served 2015‚Äì2018), and current President of Singapore Halimah Yacob (elected in 2017). Dar al-Ifta al- Misriyyah, an Islamic institute that advises Egypt's ministry of justice, issued a fatwa stating that female rulers and judges are allowed in Islam. The Qur‚Äôan contains verses that appear to support the role of women in politics, such as its mention of the Queen of Sheba, who represented a ruler who consulted with and made important decisions on behalf of her people.. Haeri, Shahla. 2020. The Unforgettable Queens of Islam: Succession, Authority, Gender. Cambridge University Press . Further, the Hadith provides numerous examples of women having public leadership roles. Muhammad‚Äôs first wife, Khadija bint Khuwaylid, was his chief adviser as well as his first and foremost supporter. His third wife, Aisha Abu Bakr, a well-known authority in medicine, history, and rhetoric, often accompanied the Prophet to battles, even leading an army at the Battle of the Camel. However, it is also within the context of this battle that a famous hadith is ascribed to Muhammad where he says, \\"Never will succeed such a nation as makes a woman their ruler.\\" However, contemporary scholars have cast doubt on the authenticity of this Hadith, citing the odd timing of the Hadith's first release, its contradiction with the verses of the Quran, and the most likely use of the Hadith for a specific person at the time (Queen of Persia) rather than as a general rule or advice. Though leadership opportunities for Muslim women are cemented in religious text and continue to expand today, earlier generations had different understandings of women's roles. Despite modern developments and greater inclusion of Muslim women in political life, there are Muslims in certain countries who maintain that the ideal Muslim woman should confine herself to the role of mother and wife. ==Islamic texts== Islamic scholars argue that the Qur'an gives women the right to participate in public affairs, as there are examples of women who took part in serious discussions and argued even with Prophet Muhammad himself.. Shahla Haeri 2020. The Unforgettable Queens of Islam: Succession, Authority, Gender. Cambridge University Press . In addition, during the Caliphate of Umar, a woman argued with him in the mosque, proved her point, and caused him to declare in the presence of many people: \\"A woman is right and Umar is wrong\\". However, one of the major problems with the ability for women to lead in Muslim-majority countries stems from differences in interpretation of the textual foundations for Islam, the Qur'an and Hadiths. This problem is exacerbated by the complexity of the Arabic language, the different sectors of Islam, such as the differences between Shia Islam and Sunni Islam, and the differences that occur across the different regions. There is not a singular interpretation of the Qur'an that defines Islam. Therefore, the role of women as leaders cannot be definitively found in the Qur'an. The role of female leaders is constantly evolving depending on interpretation. Through new modern interpretations from the \\"progressive Islam\\" movement, women have gained more freedom and power as leaders. Sections of the Qur‚Äôan used to limit women's power: ‚ÄúMen are the protectors of women, because Allah hath made the one of them to excel the other, and because they spend of their property (for the support of women).‚Äù This verse, however, is often misinterpreted. In Chapter 27, verses 29‚Äì44, the Qur‚Äôan references female leadership with the Queen of Sheba (Bilqis) who had a role similar to head of state.. Sections of the Qur‚Äôan used to equate women's power: \\"Hence, do not covet the bounties which God has bestowed more abundantly on some of you than on others. Men shall have a benefit from what they earn, and women shall have a benefit from what they earn. Ask, therefore, God [to give you] out of His bounty: behold, God has indeed full knowledge of everything.\\" \\"Verily for all men and women who have surrendered themselves unto God, and all believing men and believing women, and all truly devout men and truly devout women, and all men and women who are true to their word, and all men and women who are patient in adversity, and all men and women who humble themselves [before God], and all men and women who give in charity, and all self-denying men and self-denying women, and all men and women who are mindful of their chastity, and all men and women who remember God unceasingly: for [all of] them has God readied forgiveness of sins and a mighty reward.\\" ==History== The female role has been constructed throughout history. Historically in Islamic societies, the women's role has been within the home, which has limited and created obstacles for female leaders. During the time of the Prophet Muhammad and throughout the early and per-Islamic period, women were given a great sense of freedom and power. The wives of Muhammad, referred to as the Mothers of the Believers, were considered the ideal way for women in Islam to behave. Many of his wives and women within the early Islamic period were widely important in different leadership areas. Khadija bint Khuwaylid was not only economically successful prior to her marriage to Muhammad, but she is also considered the first convert to Islam, aiding the Prophet during the revelations and the tumultuous history of the early Islamic period. His wife Hafsa bint Umar was entrusted with keeping the Qur'an safe, and his wife Aisha bint Abi Bakr led an army in the Battle of the Camel. The Prophet also appointed Umm Waraqa as a female imam of both men and women. The Prophet allowed women to take on these powerful leadership positions. However, after his death, the role of women in society became dictated by an onslaught of Hadiths and interpretations of Qur'an verses from a male dominated and patriarchal society. However, the role of women in all of Islam is difficult to generalize, as there are many different sectors of Islam and different interpretations of Qur'an verses which place the role of women in Islamic societies in different ways. Overall, women became regulated to positions within the household, becoming protected through seclusion, with men dictating the major decisions of their lives. Therefore, a separate movement for the rights and freedoms of females in Islam began to stir in the early 20th century. Two major figures who called for the liberation and education of women in Islamic societies were Rifa 'a al-Tahtawi and Qasim Amin. Qasim Amin is considered the father of women's reform in the Muslim Middle East, challenging societal norms in his book The Liberation of Women. Amongst these two male leaders were also three Egyptian women, Maryam al-Nahhas, Zaynab Fawwaz, and Aisha al-Taymuriyya, who worked for the Islamic feminism movement in the late 19th century. In 1956, Doria Shafik led a suffrage movement in Egypt. The movement for women as political leaders in modern-day Islamic society was spearheaded by these modern day activists for gender equality. However, the progress of this movement varies in different Arab countries and within different sectors of Islam, as new interpretations shape the gender construction for women in Islamic societies. ==Political leaders== There are several medieval queens, including the Sayyida Hurra Queen Arwa of Yemen (1067‚Äì1138), and Razia Sutan of India (1236‚Äì1240),Shahla Haeri. 2020, pp. 77-138. The Unforgettable Queens of Islam: Succession, Authority, Gender. Cambridge University Press. There are many more twentieth and twenty-first century examples of women leading Muslim-majority countries. The majority of all Muslims in the world live in countries that have, at some time, elected women as their leaders. The three most populous Muslim-majority countries have had women as leaders including Indonesia,Shahla Haeri. 2020, pp.183-218.

The third Afghan Constitution (in 1964 under King Zahir Shah) gave women the right to vote and enter parliament as elected candidates for the first time. As a result, in elections the following year three women were elected as members of the parliament and two appointed as members of the senate. Kubra Noorzai was appointed Minister of Public Health in 1965 and re-appointed in 1967. *Shafiqa Ziayee Shafiqa Ziayee became the second female minister when appointed Minister without Portfolio in 1971. *Massouda Jalal After graduating medical school in Kabul in 1988, she practiced as a physician until 1999 when the rule of the Taliban made this impossible. She began working for the women-led UN World Food Programme (WFP) in 1999. After the Taliban was removed from power in 2002 she was one of 200 women who participated in the loya jirga. She ran for president in 2002, becoming the first woman to run for this position in Afghanistan. She won 171 votes (the second most ballots received) in the 2002 presidential election against Karzai. She lost the election to Hamid Karzai but served within his cabinet as the Women's Affairs Minister from 2004‚Äì2006. Jalal was later nominated to study in Washington, DC, at the Center for Development and Population Activities (CEDPA), which teaches women how to advance their leadership roles. *Azra Jafari One of 200 women who participated in the loya jirga after the fall of the Taliban in 2002. She is the first female mayor in Afghanistan. She is the current mayor of Nili, a town in Daykundi Province of Afghanistan. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton standing with Afghan female politicians, including Fauzia Koofi on her right and Sima Samar to her left. *Fawzia Koofi In 2014, she became a candidate for President of Afghanistan after being elected as the Vice President of the National Assembly of Afghanistan in 2005. As Vice President she became the first female Second Deputy Speaker of Parliament. *Sima Samar She served as the Afghanistan Ministry of Women's Affairs from 2001‚Äì2003. *Frozan Fana Ran in the Afghan Presidential Election of 2009. *Shahla Atta Ran in the Afghan Presidential Election of 2009. ===Azerbaijan=== *Tahira Tahirova She was a Soviet politician and diplomat.

Her specialities are Professor and Doctor of medicine. She became the first female ambassador in Azerbaijan in 1993. She served as the Secretary of State in Azerbaijan from 1993 to 1994. She chose to resign from this position because of her dissatisfaction with corruption within the government. She founded the Azerbaijan Liberal Party in 1995 and has conducted Presidential runs as the head of this party. On 7 June 2003, in the Liberal Party Congress, Shevket resigned from the party in order to start her presidential campaign as an independent candidate. Thus, she has laid another cornerstone in the political tradition of Azerbaijan. As leader of the National Unity Movement and the Liberal Party of Azerbaijan, Shevket participated in the 2005 Parliamentary Election at the head of the list of 70 Liberal Party candidates. She won a decisive victory in her constituency, which was officially recognised by the Central Election Commission. As the result of total falsification, however, the victory of at least 11 Liberal Party candidates was not officially recognized. On 17 February 2006, the \\"Azadliq\\" Political Bloc was created. In 2010, before the parliamentary elections, \\"Azadliq\\" Political Bloc has been disbanded due to the decision of the Popular Front Party to join a coalition with the Musavat Party. *Mehriban Aliyeva She is the Vice President and First Lady of Azerbaijan, the head of Heydar Aliyev Foundation, the chairperson of Azerbaijani Culture Friends Foundation, the President of Azerbaijani Gymnastics Federation, the goodwill ambassador of UNESCO and ISESCO. In 1995, she established the Azerbaijani Culture Friends Foundation. In 1996, with financial support from Chevron, the foundation gave lifetime awards to six representatives of Azerbaijani art and culture. In Azerbaijan's 2005 parliamentary elections, she was elected to the National Assembly of Azerbaijan. She had previously broken with tradition to help campaign for her husband in 2003, when he ran for President of Azerbaijan. On 24 November 2006, Aliyeva was awarded the title of Goodwill Ambassador of ISESCO for her attention to the children in need and help to improve their living conditions and education. *Leyla Yunus She is an Azerbaijani human rights activist who serves as the director of Institute of Peace and Democracy, a human rights organisation.

Yunus is a historian by training and wrote her dissertation on \\"English-Russian Rivalry on the Caspian Sea and Azerbaijan in the First Part of the 18th Century\\". In the last years of the Soviet Union, Yunus was active in pro-reform circles. In 1988, she founded the \\"Popular Front of Azerbaijan in Support of Perestroika\\", together with a small group of moderate intellectuals. Early on, this Popular Front of Azerbaijan was deliberately modeled on the example of the Popular Front of Estonia. *Ganira Pashayeva She is a Member of the National Assembly of Azerbaijan. Since 1998, she worked as a reporter, correspondent, editor, leading editor, senior leading editor, Deputy editor-in-chief, and Deputy editor-in-chief of the news service and Deputy editor-in-chief of the news section at the ANS Group of Companies Television Company.

She is also the chairperson and leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Zia has been ranked by Forbes three times as one of the \\"100 Most Powerful Women in the World\\". ===Egypt=== Nearly one-third of the Parliament of Egypt- the fifth most populous Muslim majority nation- also consists of women. *Rawya Ateya In 1956 she became the first woman to be commissioned as an officer in the Liberation Army of Egypt. She is considered to be a pioneer for female leaders in Muslim-majority countries. She was the first female Parliamentarian in the Arab world when in 1957 she served in the Parliament of Egypt. ===Indonesia=== The most populous Muslim-majority country. *Megawati Sukarnoputri She served as president of Indonesia from 2001‚Äì2004, becoming the first female president of Indonesia and the fourth female to lead a Muslim- majority nation.

The late Benazir Bhutto, former prime minister of Pakistan. *Benazir Bhutto In 1982 Bhutto became the first female in Pakistan to lead a political party, the Pakistan People's Party. Her father, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, founded the Pakistan People's Party in 1968. She was elected twice as the Prime Minister of Pakistan. Her first election to Prime Minister in 1988 made her the first woman to lead a Muslim-majority country. She served in this position from 1988‚Äì1990 and from 1992‚Äì1996. She was assassinated as a candidate in the 2008 election for Prime Minister.Shahla Haeri. 2020, pp.141-182. The Unforgettable Queens of Islam: Succession, Authority, Gender, Cambridge University Press ===Romania=== *Sevil Shhaideh She was nominated, but never served, as Prime- Minister in the country with by contrast, more than 80 percent of Romanians are Orthodox Christians, while fewer than 1 percent are Muslims. ===Senegal=== *Mame Madior Boye She was elected as the Minister of Justice in 2000 and was Prime Minister from 2001 to 2002. She is the first female in Senegal to hold this position. ===Turkey=== Tansu √áiller is the first and only female Prime Minister of Turkey. *Tansu √áiller Became Prime Minister of Turkey in 1993. Four Muslim countries have been or are currently led by women because of successions after deceased fathers, husbands, etc. Ciller, however, won her position as Prime Minister entirely on her own. Ciller attended Robert College and later received her Master's and Ph.D. Ciller returned to Turkey and taught economics at Bosphorus University after her husband was offered a good job. She entered politics in 1990 by joining the True Path Party (which she is now the president of) under Suleyman Demirel. Ciller quickly became assistant of the party, and then entered the 1991 election where she won and received the responsibility for ministry of economy in the government. President Turgu Ozal died in 1993, so Demirel took his position as president. Ciller saw her chance and took it, for she won the position as prime minister in June 1993. Ciller's supporters favor her modernization/westernization ideas. Despite her followers, Ciller also had many people against her reforms. Ciller was forced to leave the government after she made some unpopular actions as prime minister. Her questionable decisions led to three different parliamentary investigations on her, so Ciller decided to leave office in 1995. Despite her mistakes, Ciller still remains powerful today. Since 1995, the number of women in the parliament has been continually on the rise. Female representation rate did not fall below 10 percent after the 2007 elections.An Afyon University paper by D. Ali Aslan ===Other=== Other Muslim female national political leaders include Ciss√© Mariam Ka√Ødama Sidib√©, Sitt al-Mulk (in eleventh century), Sibel Siber and Aminata Tour√©. ==Queens== *Queen Rania of Jordan She was proclaimed Queen by her husband on 7 February 1999. She uses her position to advocate for better education, health, and tribal community empowerment. She attempts to empower women and the youth within her own country. Jordan has many laws which discriminate against women, this is at odds with the opinion of the Royal Family. Globally, she works with the United Nation's Children's Fund and the United Nations Girls' Education Initiative, as well as promotes dialogues for tolerance between different cultures. She was also ranked in 2011 as one of the \\"World's Most Powerful Women\\" by Forbes. ==Political history by country== Muslim women's roles and opportunities in public office vary depending on the country/region and the type of government in power. For this reason, one cannot generalize the subject of Muslim female political leaders. It is best to look at the histories of each country to get a better understanding of how Muslim women's roles have evolved over time. === Afghanistan === Muslim women generally do not participate in public office in Afghanistan. However, there have been drastic changes and attempts throughout history to increase their participation in the government. King Amir Aman Allah (1919‚Äì29) was overthrown because he tried to liberate women, and Muhammad Dawud (1953‚Äì63) attempted public unveiling. In 1967, a delegated Afghan woman participated in a conference on Asian women in Ceylon, and in 1958 a female delegate was sent to the United States. King Zahir Shah (1933‚Äì73) formally announced voluntary end of female seclusion in 1959. During the constitutional period (1963‚Äì73), the liberal constitution accorded significant rights to women (i.e. right to vote and right to education). The king appointed two women to the Constitutional Advisory Commission, and the loya Jirga (Grand Assembly) included four women. Four women were elected in the 1965 elections, where Miss Kubra Nurzai became minister for Public Health (first female minister in Afghanistan), and Mrs. Shafiqa Ziayee became a minister who remained without portfolio in Etemadi's second cabinet (1969‚Äì71). The People's Democratic Party (PDPA) (a progressive agenda for women's rights) and the Democratic Organization of Afghan Women were established in 1965. The Taliban then emerged in 1996 and enforced a drastic reduction of women's freedom. Women were not allowed to receive education or employment, and many women were fired from their government positions. Overall, it was very hard for women to work under Taliban rule. In December 2001 after the fall of the Taliban, the Bonn Process worked to make Afghan women a more active political force. The 2002 Loya Jirga endorsed the Transitional Administration, which included three women out of twenty-one commissioners. 12.5% of the delegates in the loya Jirga were women, and one woman was even elected as vice chair of the loya Jirga. The Ministry of Women's Affairs (MOWA) was established in 2002. The government of Afghanistan signed the Convention for the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) in 2003. In 2004, Afghanistan reserved seats for female candidates in legislative elections for the first time. As a result, almost 30% of the women won their seats on their own (not because they were reserved), and 68 women (27%) were also elected to parliament. Although there has been significant improvement of women's participation in public office, men are still the majority in the government and therefore still tend to make the final decisions. === Arab States === In 2005, women occupied 5.7% of all parliamentary seats in the region, as compared to 12-15% in other regions. Some Arab countries have tried to adopt legislation to increase women's participation, but the laws are never usually enforced. Some Arab countries have also adopted quotas that guarantee the representation of women. For example, Morocco reserves 30 seats of 325 and Jordan reserves 6 of 110 seats for women. Although women are still underrepresented, their participation is rising. For example, the number of female politicians elected in Morocco in 2003 rose from 84 to 127 (out of 22,944 elected officials, though). The King of Morocco appointed Zoulikha Nasri as first female royal counselor. The Arab states employ more women in key positions at a ministerial level. For example, Lebanon ranks fourth in the world and Jordan ranks eighth for most women employed at this level. The United Arab Emirate's Ministry of education (UAE) reported that there were more female than male workers in more than 25 federal ministries. In 2001, there were 16,223 women versus only 9,518 men. Although women are gaining more opportunities in public office, 68% of Arab women in political life now are dissatisfied with the current level of female political participation. Women want to keep moving up and eventually hold key decision-making positions. Female candidates also have to put gender issues second and national issues first in order to get the male vote. Laws regarding women and their right to vote in office are still weak and not well-enforced. Many Arab people continue to exclude women from public/political positions and some political regimes promote this as well. Many familial dynamics still promote male over female political participation in the current century as well. === Azerbaijan === In Azerbaijan, placing women in government has progressed better than in other Islamic countries. Universal suffrage was introduced in Azerbaijan in 1918 by the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, thus making Azerbaijan the first Muslim- majority countries ever to enfranchise women. Now, 28 women are members in the Azerbaijan Parliament (Milli M…ôclis). As of 2015, there were 21 women in the 125-seat parliament. The percentage of female members of parliament increased from 11 to 17 percent between 2005 and 2015. Traditional social norms and lagging economic development in the country's rural regions continued to restrict the role of women in the economy, and there were reports that women had difficulty exercising their legal rights due to gender discrimination. As of May 2009, women held the positions of Deputy Chairman of the Constitutional Court, Deputy Chairman of the Nakhchivan AR Cabinet of Ministers, four Deputy Ministers, an Ambassador, and Ombudsmen of Azerbaijan and Nakhchivan AR. Women constituted 4 of the 16 members of the Central Election Commission and chaired of 3 of the 125 district election commissions. Though a secular country, Azerbaijan requires certification and registration for people performing religious rites. Muslim women in Azerbaijan can study to become certified mullahs and lead women-only gatherings, a tradition that goes back centuries. In 2000, Azerbaijan signed up to the Optional Protocol of CEDAW, recognizing the competence of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, after which it can receive and consider complaints from individuals or groups within its jurisdiction. A new domestic violence law went into force in 2010, which criminalized spousal abuse, including marital rape. Rape is illegal in Azerbaijan and carries a maximum 15-year prison sentence. === Central Asia === During the Russian Empire, the participation of women in public office was not possible in Muslim territories. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union ruled after the Russian Empire, and the first women were elected to local and central governing bodies because of its new policies. This representation was low, however, until the end of the 1930s. In Turkestan, fewer than half of the elected female delegates in 1926 represented the Muslim population. In 1925, Soviets worked to create more opportunities for women to participate at all levels of public and political life. The Communist Party took steps to enable Muslim women to be active in public and political life. One requirement was increasing female representation in public office. Throughout Soviet history, only two women were appointed to the position of minister (culture and health). The Communist Party gave women secondary positions rather than top positions, so although their participation was increasing, their roles were not as important as their male counterparts. Only Yadgar Nasretddinova was able to achieve the highest levels of power in the Soviet system from the 1940s to 1970s. Yagar occupied Chair of Supreme Soviet in Uzbek SSR and Chair of Upper Chamber of Supreme Soviet of USSR. Women appointed by the Soviet government were not appointed for their educational or professional abilities, but rather by their social origin. This led to many non-professional women and men in positions of power, and as a result, women in politics and in power were seen in a negative light. Women in general were stereotyped as incapable of making decisions. Actual equality never was achieved, but the goal of changing historical traditions where women were not allowed in power was met. Despite its successes, this process, called Sovietization, had a lot of hidden barriers and regulations for women. The quota system practiced by the Soviet regime was abolished in 1989 and as a result many women lost their positions in the government. 26% of the members in the Turkish parliament during the post-Soviet period were women. 9.9% of the parliament in Uzbekistan was also women. 14.9% of the Tajikistan parliament was women in 2000. Equal rights and opportunities laws have been drafted in most Muslim countries of Central Asia; however, women are still stuck in secondary positions because of traditional patriarchal views of women. === Iran === Women actively participated in the Iranian Constitutional Revolution of 1905/06, which recognized all citizens as equal. The electoral law of 1906, however, denied women the right to vote. Women voted for the first time in the 1963 referendum on the White Revolution (reform introduced by Mohammad Reza Shah). The government did not allow women's participation in the 1963 vote, but they also did not deny them the right to set up their own ballots and vote. Women also voted in the September 1963 parliamentary elections. For the first time, six women were elected to parliament, and the Shah appointed two other women to the senate. The number of women deputies also increased in the following parliamentary elections. In 1978, on the eve of the Islamic Revolution, 22 women were in the parliament. Women retained the right to vote after the Islamic Revolution, and four were elected to parliament under the Islamic Republic. In the 2000 Majlis elections, 13 women were elected to parliament. In the 1960s and 1970s, Farrukhru Parsa was elected as minister of education and Mahnaz Afkhami as minister of state for women's affairs. The position of minister of state for women's affairs was abolished in 1978. Today, Iranian women are still working to gain more rights in the political sphere. === Turkey === Women's formal political participation began with the Turkish Republic. A group of women attempted to establish a women's party after the rise of the Turkish Republic but were denied. The legal status of women changed between 1920 and 1935. Turkish women were granted political rights much earlier than women in other Islamic or European countries. They were allowed to vote for local elections in 1930 and national elections in 1934. There was also a lot of support from single party leaders for more women's participation in government between 1930 and 1946. In the 1935 national elections, 18 women (4.6%) were elected to parliament. There was, however, a decline in the participation of women after the multi-party regime. Until 1984, the percentage of women in parliament was between .61 and 1.76. After 1984, there was a slight increase, but the percentage of women still never surpassed that of 1935. For example, in the 2002 election, 24 (4.5%) were women. Thirteen of 365 women were in the Justice and Development Party (AKP) and eleven of 177 were in the social-democratic Republican People's Party (CHP). Between 1935 and 2004, 126 women were members of the parliament, but 48.9% of them did not get the opportunity for a second term. Therefore, of 8,517 seats, only 183 (2.1%) women occupied them. Women in Turkish government are generally concentrated in areas associated with traditional women's roles (i.e. education and health). Only 14 women have taken part in 16 cabinets occupying 28 ministerial posts since 1971. Tansu Ciller, leader of the True Path Party (DYP) became the first female prime minister in Turkey and served until 1996. It is statistically proven that the total number of women working in public office has been increasing at a faster rate than males. Prime Minister office abolished in Turkey in 2018. Since 1995, the number of women in the parliament has been continually on the rise. Female representation rate did not fall below 10 percent after the 2007 elections.An Afyon University paper by D. Ali Aslan ==Movements== By the nineteenth century, Muslim women began creating women's organizations aimed at including women as public leaders. During this time, women began to advocate for higher education, along with protesting the full veiling they were forced to wear. Debate on such issues gave certain women access to public roles, specifically women of higher classes. Western ideals may be responsible for influencing certain women to become activists and obtain public leadership roles. The nineteenth century also marked the reformation of certain social restrictions and oppression toward women, specifically regarding education, polygamy, and the arranged marriage of a young girl to a much older man. Wardah al-Yaziji and Wardah al-Turk, two educated women in Syria, began writing Aishah al-Taymuriyah of Egypt during the 1860s and 1870s. The women discussed potential reforms for their gender in hopes of raising awareness of gender inequality. Around the same time, and in contribution to this publication, Hind Nawfal, an immigrant from Syria to Alexandria, published a monthly women's piece in Arabic called Al-fatah. In 1891, Zaynab Fawwaz, also an immigrant to Alexandria, published the newspaper Al-nil. Such actions are considered some of the first marks of Muslim feminism. At the beginning of the twentieth century, women began participating in national movements and campaigns. Women in Iran participated in the Tobacco Rebellion and the Constitutional Revolution in 1908. As a result, upper-class women founded political societies that aimed at increasing rights for women in education and politics. Such national participation helped counter female seclusion in Muslim society. Following World War I, gender issues were highlighted as an area to reform. Iran, Tunisia, and Egypt all addressed controversial topics of women's rights in divorce and child custody while reforming amendments. Iran and Turkey began strongly opposing the need of head scarfs. Such reformations have continued through the twenty-first century. ==See also== *Female figures in the Quran *List of the first female holders of political offices *List of the first women heads of government and state in Muslim-majority countries *Sultana (title), the female title parallel to a sultan; a Muslim woman leader *Women in Islam *Sex segregation in Islam *Women as imams == References == Analyzing Muslim Women‚Äôs Leadership : The Contemporary Context Category:Lists of female politicians Female political leaders Category:Women's rights in Islam ","title":"Muslim women political leaders"},{"id":"11659289","text":"Toe walking refers to a condition where a person walks on their toes without putting much weight on the heel or any other part of the foot. Toe walking in toddlers is common. These children usually adopt a normal walking pattern as they grow older. If a child continues to walk on their toes past the age of three, they should be evaluated by a doctor. Toe walking can be caused by different factors. One type of toe walking is also called \\"habitual\\" or \\"idiopathic\\" toe walking, where the cause is unknown. Other causes include a congenital short Achilles tendon, muscle spasticity (especially as associated with cerebral palsy) and paralytic muscle disease such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy. A congenital shortening of the Achilles tendon can be hereditary, can take place over time as the result of abnormal foot structure which shortens the tendon, or can shorten over time if its full length is not being used. Toe walking is sometimes caused by a bone block located at the ankle which prevents the antagonist movement, dorsiflexion. This cause is often associated with trauma or arthritis. It may also be one way of accommodating a separate condition, foot drop. Persistent toe walking in children has been identified as a potential early sign of autism. Toe walking has been found to be more prevalent in males than females when tested with very large numbers of children. This study looked for family history of toe walking and the connection to children demonstrating idiopathic toe walking (ITW). 64.2% of the subjects with ITW were males showing a relationship between ITW and males. Of 348 subjects with positive family history of toe walking, about 60% had family history on the paternal side showing it may be genetically related to paternal genes. In 30‚Äì42% of idiopathic toe walkers, a family link has been observed. ==Cause== ===Unknown=== Idiopathic toe walking can be described as bilateral toe walking with no orthopedic or neurological cause past the age of two. In this condition, children are able to voluntarily walk with the normal heel-toe pattern, but prefer to walk with the toe-toe pattern. In order for it to be considered idiopathic, the child's medical history should be clear of any neurological, orthopedic, or neuro-psychiatric conditions including other gait abnormalities. Two classifications of idiopathic toe walking have been established. The Alvarez's classification identifies the severity of the dysfunction based upon kinematics and ankle rockers. The Pomarino classification identifies the toe walking according to the individual's specific characteristics and characterizes them into three types based on the signs presented. Diagnosis includes a spin test, walking, heel walking, dorsiflexion range of motion, and lumbar lordosis. Some treatment options include serial casting and surgery for ankle motion. ===Cerebral palsy=== Studies have been performed to determine the source of the association between toe walking and cerebral palsy patients. One study suggests that the toe walking‚Äîsometimes called an equinus gait‚Äîassociated with cerebral palsy presents with an abnormally short medial and lateral gastrocnemius and soleus‚Äîthe primary muscles involved in plantarflexion. A separate study found that the gait could be a compensatory movement due to weakened plantarflexion muscles. The study performed clinical studies to determine that a greater plantarflexion force is required for normal heel-to-toe walking than for toe walking. Able bodied children were tasked to perform gaits at different levels of toe walking and the study discovered that their toe walking could not reduce the force to the levels that cerebral palsy patients indicated in their walk. This suggests that cerebral palsy in which an equinus gait is present may be due to abnormally weakened plantarflexion that can only manage toe walking. ==Diagnosis== A doctor will typically evaluate whether there is bilateral (both legs) toe walking, what the child's range of motion is (how far they can flex their feet) and perform a basic neurological exam. Treatment will depend on the cause of the condition. ==Treatment== For idiopathic toe walking in young children, doctors may prefer to watch and wait: the child may \\"outgrow\\" the condition. If there is a reduction in the child's range of motion, there are several options. * Wearing a brace or splint either during the day, night or both which limits the ability of the child to walk on their toes and stretches the Achilles tendon. One type of brace used is an AFO (ankle-foot orthosis). * Serial casting where the foot is cast with the tendon stretched, and the cast is changed weekly with progressive stretching. However, these casts may not be changed weekly and instead every 2‚Äì3 weeks. * Botox therapy is used to paralyze the calf muscles to reduce the opposition of the muscles to stretching the Achilles tendon, usually together with serial casting or splinting. * If conservative measures fail to correct the toe walking after about 12‚Äì24 months, surgical lengthening of the tendon is an option. The surgery is typically done under full anesthesia but if there are no issues, the child is released the same day. After the surgery, a below-the- knee walking cast is worn for six weeks and then an AFO is worn to protect the tendon for several months. For toe walking which results from more serious neuro-muscular conditions, additional specialists may need to be consulted. ==References== == External links == Category:Foot diseases ","title":"Toe walking"},{"id":"11659309","text":"John Paul Wolstenholme (born 7 May 1982) was an English cricketer.

The treaty established the modern Malaysia-Thailand Border lies on Golok River in Kelantan until Padang Besar in Perlis. In 2014, there were nearly 70,000 people self-identifying as \\"Siamese\\" or \\"Thai\\" who hold Malaysian nationality. This number excludes those senior citizen Siamese living in Malaysia who do not hold Malaysian citizenship because of political constraint. == Demographics == In 2000, the national statistics cited 50,211 individuals of Siamese ethnicity in Malaysia. Among these, 38,353 (or 76.4% of them) hold Malaysian citizenship. === Culture === The Malaysian Siamese community has the similarity of cultural region along Malay Peninsular. Which is community activity, ethnolinguistic identity and languages spoken by Malaysian Siamese are similar to community in fourteen provinces of Southern Thailand as well as southernmost of Burma community. The Malaysian-Siamese lead a way of life similar to other Malaysian-Malays. Malaysian Siamese still have the strong belief and practices of Hinduism and Buddhism while the Malaysian-Malays has the adoption of Islam in 14th century, established in Sultanate of Malacca. The Malaysian Siamese well known in northernmost of Malaysia are Perlis, Kedah, Perak, Penang, Terengganu and Kelantan. One could not differentiate a Malay or a Siamese if they are not spoken their mother tongue. The only distinctive mark among them is their religion and language. Otherwise Malaysian Siamese are like Malays as they also speak fluent local Malay dialects. Majority of Malaysian Siamese can read and write in Thai because there is Thai language learning and teaching in the schools which were established inside the village temples since 1943.They also often follow news in Thailand, watch Thai dramas and listen to Thai music.http://gscm.nida.ac.th/uploads/files/1536032634.pdf The Malaysian Siamese often get patronage from the state governments for their community well being. Often, temples are given generous fundings by the governments. Their community are also known for the making of traditional medicine. === Religion === The Malaysian Siamese predominantly profess to Buddhism and the predominant form of Buddhism is TheravƒÅda Buddhism which is centred in their place of worship called Wat. The Malaysian Siamese lives are closely tied to their temples (Wat) and they also have strong faith in Buddhism. Monks have a significant role to strengthen communities and encourage villagers to participate in traditional ceremonies and Buddhist rituals on important religious days like (Uposatha Days, Magha Puja, Visakha Puja, Buddhist Lent (Vassa), and End of Buddhist Lent (Kathina)) to preserve the Siamese-Buddhist cultural identity. Most of them settled around temples and consider them as centers for holding religious ceremonies, cultural and social activities.http://gscm.nida.ac.th/uploads/files/1536032634.pdf There also exists a small Thai-speaking Muslim minority called Samsam.

The film centers on an elderly widower named Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner) and an earnest boy named Russell (Jordan Nagai). By tying thousands of balloons to his house, Carl sets out to fulfill his dream to see the wilds of South America and complete a promise made to his late wife, Ellie. The film was directed by Pete Docter and co-directed by Bob Peterson, who also wrote the film's screenplay, as well as the story with Tom McCarthy, with music composed by Michael Giacchino from The Incredibles and Ratatouille . Docter began working on the story in 2004 called Heliums, which was based on fantasies of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating. He and eleven other Pixar artists spent three days in Venezuela gathering research and inspiration. The designs of the characters were caricatured and stylized considerably, and animators were challenged with creating realistic cloth. Up was Pixar's first film to be presented in Disney Digital 3-D. It was released on May 29, 2009, and opened the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, becoming the first animated and 3-D film to do so. The film grossed over $735 million, and received universal acclaim, with critics calling it one of the best animated films of all time. Asner's vocal performance and Michael Giacchino's score were praised, as was the montage of Carl and his wife Ellie growing old together. The film won two Academy Awards, including Best Animated Feature, and was nominated for three more, including Best Picture, making it the second animated film in history to receive such a nomination (and the first Pixar film to do so), following Beauty and the Beast (1991). == Plot == Renowned explorer Charles F. Muntz says he has found a new species of giant bird at Paradise Falls, South America. However, archaeologists study the skeleton of the bird and conclude that Muntz fabricated it. Disgraced, Muntz vows to bring back a live specimen and will not return until he does so. Youngster Carl Fredricksen meets Ellie. Both are aspiring explorers who idolize Muntz, and the two quickly become friends. Ellie reveals her dream to Carl about going to live by Paradise Falls. The two eventually get married and repeatedly save up for a trip to Paradise Falls, but always end up spending the money on more pressing needs. As an elderly man, Carl finally buys tickets for the trip, but Ellie falls ill and dies before they can go. Carl continues living in the house he and Ellie fixed up, stubbornly holding out while the neighborhood around him is replaced by skyscrapers. When he unintentionally injures a construction worker, the developer trying to buy his place seizes the opportunity. The court deems him a public menace and orders him to move to a retirement home. However, Carl resolves to keep his promise to Ellie. Having worked his entire life as a balloon salesman, he turns his house into a makeshift airship by attaching hundreds of helium balloons to it and flies away. Russell, a young Wilderness Explorer trying to earn his final merit badge for \\"Assisting the Elderly\\", becomes an accidental stowaway. Before Carl can drop Russell off, a cumulonimbus storm drives them all the way to South America. The house lands on a tepui opposite Paradise Falls. Carl and Russell harness themselves to the still-buoyant house and begin to walk it across the mesa, hoping to reach the falls before the balloons deflate. Russell encounters a tall colorful bird whom he names \\"Kevin\\", who is trying to gather food for her chicks. They then meet a Golden Retriever named Dug, who wears a special collar that allows him to speak, and who vows to take the bird to his master. The next day, they encounter a pack of aggressive dogs (also with special collars) led by Alpha, a Doberman Pinscher, and are taken to their master, the elderly Muntz. Muntz invites Carl and Russell aboard his dirigible, where he explains to them that he is still searching for the giant bird he promised to bring back. Russell notes the bird's similarity to Kevin and Muntz becomes hostile, thinking they are attempting to capture the bird for themselves‚Äîhe implies he has killed other visitors he suspected of doing the same thing. Carl and Russell flee with Kevin and Dug, but Kevin is injured in the process. Using the tracking device on Dug's collar, Muntz finds and captures Kevin, then sets fire to Carl's house, which pops many of the balloons. Carl is forced to decide whether to save his house or Kevin; he chooses his house, upsetting Russell. Carl finally parks the house at Paradise Falls, where Carl sadly looks through Ellie's childhood scrapbook and finds a final note thanking him for their \\"adventure\\" and encouraging him to have a new one. Reinvigorated, Carl goes outside, only to see Russell flying away, using some balloons and a leaf blower, to try to rescue Kevin. Carl lightens the house enough for him and Dug to follow. Muntz captures Russell, but Carl and Dug board the dirigible and free both Russell and Kevin. Muntz pursues them around the airship and corners Kevin, Dug, and Russell inside Carl's house. They escape by jumping back onto the dirigible after Carl lures Kevin with chocolate; Muntz leaps after them, but gets caught on some balloon lines and falls to the ground far below. The house, having lost too many balloons, descends out of sight through the clouds. Carl and Russell reunite Kevin with her chicks and fly the dirigible back home. Russell receives his \\"Assisting the Elderly\\" badge and also \\"The Ellie Badge\\" from Carl. Carl then becomes a grandpa-like figure to Russell. Unbeknownst to Carl, his house lands on the cliff beside Paradise Falls, fulfilling his promise to Ellie. ==Voice cast== * Ed Asner as Carl Fredricksen: A salesman and widower who flies his house to Paradise Falls to fulfill a childhood dream he shared with his late wife Ellie. Docter and Rivera noted Asner's television alter ego, Lou Grant, had been helpful in writing for Carl because it guided them in balancing likable and unlikable aspects of the curmudgeonly character. When they met Asner and presented him with a model of his character, he joked, \\"I don't look anything like that.\\" (The appearance of Carl is meant to resemble Spencer Tracy as he appeared in his final film, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.) They tailored his dialogue for him, with short sentences and more consonants, which \\"cemented the notion that Carl, post- Ellie, is a disgruntled bear that's been poked awake during hibernation\\". ** Jeremy Leary as Young Carl Fredricksen * Jordan Nagai as Russell: A Wilderness Explorer who is trying to earn a merit badge for \\"Assisting the Elderly\\" and becomes a stowaway on Carl's house as it flies to Paradise Falls. Throughout most of the film, he makes several comments to Carl that suggest that Russell's father and mother are no longer together. Russell's design was based on Pixar animator Peter Sohn, who is Korean-American. The Pixar employees frequently sketch each other during meetings, and a drawing of Sohn became the model for Russell. Docter auditioned 400 boys in a nationwide casting call for the part. Nagai, who is Japanese American, showed up to an audition with his brother, who was actually the one auditioning. Docter realized Nagai behaved and spoke non-stop like Russell and chose him for the part. Nagai was eight years old when cast. Docter encouraged Nagai to act physically as well as vocally when recording the role, lifting him upside down and tickling him for the scene where Russell encounters Kevin. East Asian Americans have positively noted Pixar's first casting of an East Asian lead character, in contrast to the common practice of casting non-East Asians in East Asian parts, particularly in the role of an \\"all-American\\" boy without any stereotypes typically seen with East Asian characters, such as martial arts. * Christopher Plummer as Charles F. Muntz: A renowned explorer who claims to have discovered a species of giant bird and has not been seen since vowing to bring a live specimen from South America. The name of his airship, the Spirit of Adventure, may have been inspired by Charles Lindbergh's airplane, Spirit of St. Louis. In various interviews, Pete Docter has mentioned Howard Hughes and real-life adventurers Charles Lindbergh and Percy Fawcett as inspirations for Muntz. * Bob Peterson as: :*Dug: The Golden Retriever misfit of Muntz's pack of dogs that can all communicate with humans through a device on each of their collars. Peterson knew he would voice Dug when he wrote his line \\"I have just met you, and I love you.\\", which was based on what a child told him when he was a camp counselor in the 1980s. The DVD release of the film features a short called Dug's Special Mission, which follows Dug just before his first meeting with Carl and Russell. Dug previously appeared in Ratatouille as a shadow on a wall that barks at Remy. :*Alpha: The Doberman Pinscher leader. Pete Docter has stated that Alpha \\"thinks of himself as Clint Eastwood\\". Despite his menacing appearance, a frequent malfunction in Alpha's translating collar causes his voice to sound comically high-pitched and squeaky, as if he had been breathing helium. The normal voice for his translator is a resonant, intimidating bass. In either voice, Alpha has a roundabout speech pattern that causes his sentences to be longer than necessary. * Pete Docter as: :*Kevin: The \\"Beast of Paradise Falls\\". :*Campmaster Strauch: Russell's scout leader, seen at the end of the film. * Elizabeth Docter as Ellie: A bold and adventurous young girl who meets Carl in their childhood when he walks into her home and eventually marries him as an adult. The voice actor is the director's daughter, who also provided some of the drawings shown by Ellie. Elizabeth only voiced Ellie as a child, as the adult Ellie had no spoken lines. * Delroy Lindo as Beta: A Rottweiler and one of Muntz's dogs. * Jerome Ranft as Gamma: A Bulldog and one of Muntz's dogs. * John Ratzenberger as Tom: The construction worker who asks if Carl is ready to sell his house * David Kaye as the newsreel announcer. * Danny Mann as Steve: A construction worker whom Carl injures after he accidentally damages Carl's mailbox * Mickie McGowan as Edith: A police officer who brings Carl home after his court appointment. * Don Fullilove and Jess Harnell as George and A.J.: Two nurses who work at Shady Oaks Retirement Village. ==Production== The main character Carl Fredricksen is partially based on Spencer Tracy. ===Development=== Director Pete Docter began writing Up in 2004 under the title of Heliums. He developed the fantasy of a flying house on the idea of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating, which stemmed from his difficulty with social situations growing up. Actor and writer Tom McCarthy aided Docter and Bob Peterson in shaping the story for about three months. Docter selected an old man for the main character after drawing a picture of a grumpy old man with smiling balloons. The two men thought an old man was a good idea for a protagonist because they felt their experiences and the way they affect their view of the world was a rich source of humor. Docter was not concerned about an elderly protagonist, stating that children would relate to Carl the way they relate to their grandparents. Early concepts differed from the final film. The initial version featured a floating city on an alien planet populated with muppet-like creatures, with two brothers vying to inherit their father's kingdom, and when the brothers fell to Earth, they encountered a tall bird who helped them understand each other. But the story just didn't seem to work properly, and Docter and Peterson realized that the most intriguing element was the isolation of the floating city. Yet the people living there would consist of a whole community, and were therefore not really isolated. So the whole city was stripped down to a single flying house with just a single occupant, where balloons replaced the magic which kept the floating city up. After that they got the idea to use an old person, and found the contrast between the elderly grumpy man and the happy balloons in Docter's drawing appealing, inspiring them to work out his backstory. The next concept introduced many of the elements that eventually made their way into the film, but had Carl and Russell landing the house on a Soviet-era spy airship camouflaged as a giant cloud rather than on a tepui. This concept was rewritten due to its similarity to another idea Pixar was developing. Another idea Docter added, then removed, was magic fountain-of-youth eggs laid by the bird, in order to explain the age discrepancy between Muntz and Carl, but they decided this subplot was too distracting, and people would forgive the minor inconsistency. Also, the biggest single influence on Up early on was The Station Agent, by Tom McCarthy. Docter noted the film reflects his friendships with Disney veterans Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston, and Joe Grant (who all died before the film's release and thus the film was dedicated to them). Grant gave the script his approval as well as some advice before his death in 2005. Docter recalled Grant would remind him the audience needed an \\"emotional bedrock\\" because of how wacky the adventure would become; here it is Carl mourning for his wife. Docter felt Grant's personality influenced Carl's deceased wife Ellie more than the grouchy main character, and Carl was primarily based on Spencer Tracy, Walter Matthau, James Whitmore, and their own grandparents, because there was \\"something sweet about these grumpy old guys\\". Docter and Jonas Rivera noted Carl's charming nature in spite of his grumpiness derives from the elderly \\"hav[ing] this charm and almost this 'old man license' to say things that other people couldn't get away with ... It's like how we would go to eat with Joe Grant and he would call the waitresses 'honey'. I wish I could call a waitress 'honey'.\\" Docter revealed the filmmakers' first story outline had Carl \\"just want[ing] to join his wife up in the sky. It was almost a kind of strange suicide mission or something. And obviously that's [a problem]. Once he gets airborne, then what? So we had to have some goal for him to achieve that he had not yet gotten.\\" As a result, they added the plot of going to South America. The location was chosen due to both Docter's love of tropical locations, but also in wanting a location Carl could be stuck with a kid due to the inability to leave him with an authority such as a police officer or social worker. They implemented a child character as a way to help Carl stop being \\"stuck in his ways\\". Docter created Dug as he felt it would be refreshing to show what a dog thinks, rather than what people assume it thinks. Knowledge of canine communication, body language and pack behaviors for the artists and animators to portray such thoughts came from consultant Dr. Ian Dunbar, veterinarian, dog behaviorist, and trainer. The idea for Alpha's voice derived from thinking about what would happen if someone broke a record player and it always played at a high pitch. Russell was added to the story at a later date than Dug and Kevin; his presence, as well as that of the construction workers, helped to make the story feel less \\"episodic\\". Carl's relationship with Russell reflects how \\"he's not really ready for the whirlwind that a kid is, as few of us are\\". Docter added he saw Up as a \\"coming of age\\" tale and an \\"unfinished love story\\", with Carl still dealing with the loss of his wife. He cited inspiration from Casablanca and A Christmas Carol, which are both \\"resurrection\\" stories about men who lose something, and regain purpose during their journey. Docter and Rivera cited inspirations from the Muppets, Hayao Miyazaki, Dumbo, and Peter Pan. They also saw parallels to The Wizard of Oz and tried to make Up not feel too similar. There is a scene where Carl and Russell haul the floating house through the jungle. A Pixar employee compared the scene to Fitzcarraldo, and Docter watched that film and The Mission for further inspiration. The character Charles Muntz comes from Howard Hughes and Errol Flynn. ===Animation=== Docter and eleven other Pixar artists visited tepuis in Venezuela in 2004 for research. Docter made Venezuela the film's setting after Ralph Eggleston gave him a video of the tepui mountains of Canaima National Park; tepuis were previously featured in another Disney film, Dinosaur. In 2004, Docter and eleven other Pixar artists spent three days reaching Monte Roraima by airplane, by jeep, and by helicopter. They also spent three nights there painting and sketching, and encountering ants, mosquitoes, scorpions, frogs, and snakes. They then flew to Matawi Tepui and climbed to Angel Falls. Docter felt \\"we couldn't use [the rocks and plants we saw]. Reality is so far out, if we put it in the movie you wouldn't believe it.\\" The film's creatures were also challenging to design because they had to fit in the surreal environment of the tepuis, but also they had to be realistic because those mountains exist in real life. The filmmakers then visited the Sacramento Zoo to observe a Himalayan monal for Kevin's animation. The animators designed Russell as an Asian-American, and modeled Russell after similar looking Peter Sohn, a Pixar storyboarder who voiced Emile in Ratatouille and directed the short Partly Cloudy, because of his energetic nature. While Pixar usually designs their characters to be caricatured, Carl was even more so, being only at least three heads high. He was not given elderly features such as liver spots or hair in his ears to keep him appealing, yet giving him wrinkles, pockmarks on his nose, a hearing aid, and a cane to make him appear elderly. Docter wanted to push a stylized feel, particularly the way Carl's head is proportioned: he has a squarish appearance to symbolize his containment within his house, while Russell is rounded like a balloon. The challenge on Up was making these stylized characters feel natural, although Docter remarked the effect came across better than animating the realistic humans from Toy Story, who suffered from the \\"uncanny valley\\". Cartoonists Al Hirschfeld, Hank Ketcham, and George Booth influenced the human designs. Simulating realistic cloth on caricatured humans was harder than creating the 10,000 balloons flying the house. New programs were made to simulate the cloth and for Kevin's iridescent feathers. To animate old people, Pixar animators would study their own parents or grandparents and also watched footage of the Senior Olympics. The directors had various rules for Carl's movements: he could not turn his head more than 15‚Äì20 degrees without turning his torso as well, nor could he raise his arms high. However, they also wanted him to grow more flexible near the end of the film, transforming into an \\"action hero\\". A technical director calculated that to make Carl's house fly, he would require 23 million balloons, but Docter realized that such a high number made the balloons look like small dots. Instead, the balloons created were made to be twice Carl's size. There are 10,297 balloons for shots of the house just flying, 20,622 balloons for the lift-off sequence, and a varying number in other scenes. ===Music=== Up is the third Pixar film to be scored by Michael Giacchino, after The Incredibles and Ratatouille. What Pete Docter wanted most importantly out of the music was the emotion, so Giacchino wrote a character theme-based score that producer Jonas Rivera thought enhanced the story. At the beginning of the movie, when young Carl is in the movie theater watching a newsreel about Muntz, the first piece of music heard is \\"Muntz's Theme\\", which starts out as a celebratory theme, and echoes through the film when Muntz reappears 70 years later. \\"Ellie's Theme\\" is first heard when she is introduced as a little kid and plays several times during the film in different versions; for instance, during the sequence where Carl lifts his house with the balloons, the theme is changed from a simple piano melody to a full orchestral arrangement. Giacchino has compared the film to opera since each character has a unique theme that changes during a particular moment in the story. The score was released as a digital download on May 26, 2009, three days before the film opened in theaters. It won the Academy Award for Best Original Score, the Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album, the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score, and the 2010 BAFTA Award for Best Film Music. It is the first score for a Pixar film to win the Oscar (Randy Newman also won for Monsters, Inc. and Toy Story 3, but in the category of Best Original Song). == Marketing and release == George Lucas with the film's protagonists at the 66th Venice International Film Festival in September 2009 When the film screened at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, California, from May 29 to July 23, 2009, it was accompanied by Lighten Up!, a live show featuring Disney characters. Other tie-ins included children's books such as My Name is Dug, illustrated by screenwriter Ronnie del Carmen. Despite Pixar's track record, Target Corporation and Walmart stocked few Up items, while Pixar's regular collaborator Thinkway Toys did not produce merchandise, claiming its story is unusual and would be hard to promote. Disney acknowledged not every Pixar film would have to become a franchise. Promotional partners include Aflac, NASCAR, and Airship Ventures, while Cluster Balloons promoted the film with a replica of Carl's couch lifted by hot air balloons for journalists to sit on. In Colombia, unexpected publicity for the film was generated due to the uncanny similarity of Carl with Colombian ex-president Julio C√©sar Turbay Ayala. Prior to the film's worldwide release date, Pixar granted a wish from ten-year-old Colby Curtin to see the film before she died. Colby had a rare form of vascular cancer and was too sick to go to a theater. A Pixar employee flew to the Curtins' house with a DVD of the finished film and screened it for her and her family. Curtin died seven hours later at 9:20 pm, shortly after seeing the film. Pete Docter (left), Jonas Rivera (right) in 2009 with KUSI-TV's Phil Konstantin Director Pete Docter intended for audiences to take a specific point from the film, saying: ===Upisodes=== Prior to its theatrical release, Disney¬∑Pixar created three small animated vignettes called Upisodes to promote Up on the Internet. These Upisodes chronicled Carl Fredricksen and Russell's journey through the jungle, which are not seen in the movie. Fans were able to view the vignettes on both Apple iTunes movie trailer site and YouTube. * Upisode One: Animal Calls ‚Äì in the first episode, Russell demonstrates his ability to mimic animal calls. * Upisode Two: First Aid ‚Äì in the second episode, Russell tries to relieve a minor injury that Carl received. * Upisode Three: Snipe Trap ‚Äì in the third and final episode, Russell attempts to capture the elusive snipe. ===Home media=== Up was released on Blu-ray Disc and DVD in North America on November 10, 2009, and in the United Kingdom on February 15, 2010. It features the film plus the theatrical short Partly Cloudy and the new short Dug's Special Mission, as well as an audio commentary by director Pete Docter, Adventure is Out There a documentary about the filmmakers' research journey to South America, The Many Endings of Muntz (an alternate ending of sorts), and a digital copy. The Blu-ray edition has a four-disc pack that adds Cine-Explore with BonusView, Global Guardian Badge and Geography games, eight documentaries, and BD-Live to the Deluxe DVD and digital copy platters. A Limited Edition, known as the Luxo Jr. Premium Pack, includes a collectible lamp modeled after Pixar's bouncy short star that is designed to hold a complete Pixar Blu-ray collection. In addition, Pixar also created a short film titled George and A.J., written and directed by storyboard artist Josh Cooley. This shows what the two Shady Oaks retirement home workers did after Carl left with his house. It was initially available for purchase at the iTunes Store and then was later posted to Disney¬∑Pixar's Facebook and YouTube pages. In its first week, it sold 3,969,792 units ($66,057,339) and eventually reached 10,811,453 units ($182,591,149), becoming the best-selling DVD among those released in 2009 in units sold. It also became the third in sales revenue behind Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, and Twilight. The rental release of the film to Netflix, Blockbuster, and Redbox was controversial since it failed to include closed captioning. Disney faced a consumer backlash over this and quickly released a statement that this removal was an unfortunate error and that it was moving to correct the issue. Up was released on 4K Blu-ray on March 3, 2020.https://www.amazon.com/UP-Blu-ray-Ed- Asner/dp/B082PRDW21/ref=tmm_frk_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid;=1587692043&sr;=8-1 ==Reception== ===Box office=== Up earned $293 million in the United States and Canada and $442.1 million in other countries for a worldwide total of $735.1 million. Worldwide, it was the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2009, the fourth-highest-grossing Pixar film, the 92nd-highest-grossing film, and the 24th-highest-grossing animated film. In the United States and Canada, Up is the 59th-highest-grossing film before inflation, the tenth-highest-grossing Disney film, the seventh-highest-grossing 3-D film, the sixth-highest-grossing animated film, the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2009, and the fourth- highest-grossing Pixar film. On its opening weekend, it performed stronger than analysts had been expecting, ranking number one with $68,108,790. This is the fourth-highest-grossing opening for Pixar and the third-largest post- Memorial Day opening. It set a record for opening-weekend grosses originating from 3-D showings with $35.4 million (first surpassed by Avatar). The opening- weekend audience was 53% female and 47% under 17 years old. The film experienced small drop-offs on subsequent weekends, but lost first place to The Hangover. Outside the US and Canada, it is the 43rd-highest-grossing film, the tenth-highest-grossing animated film, the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2009, and the third-highest-grossing Pixar film. It was on top of the overseas box office for three consecutive weekends and for four in total. Its highest- grossing opening weekends were recorded in France and the Maghreb region ($8.88 million); the UK, Ireland and Malta ($8.44 million), and Japan ($7.24 million). These three were also its highest-grossing countries in total earnings. Among major countries, it was the highest-grossing animated film of 2009 only in Spain ($37.1 million), Australia ($25.3 million), and South Korea ($6.32 million). ===Critical response=== On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 98% approval rating based on 296 reviews, with an average rating of 8.72/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \\"An exciting, funny, and poignant adventure, Up offers an impeccably crafted story told with wit and arranged with depth, as well as yet another visual Pixar treat.\\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 88 out of 100 based on 37 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare average grade of \\"A+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars and called it \\"a wonderful film.\\" The Hollywood Reporter lauded the film as \\"Winsome, touching and arguably the funniest Pixar effort ever, this gorgeously rendered, high- flying adventure is a tidy 90-minute distillation of all the signature touches that came before it.\\" Although the San Francisco Chronicle noted that the film \\"contains many boring stretches of mindless freneticism and bland character interaction,\\" it also declared that there are scenes in Up of \\"such beauty, economy and poetic wisdom that they belong in any anthology of great movie moments ... to watch Up with any attention is to be moved and astonished by the economy with which specific visuals are invested with emotion throughout [the film]. ... \\" Variety enthused that \\"Up is an exceptionally refined picture; unlike so many animated films, it's not all about sensory bombardment and volume ... Unsurprisingly, no one puts a foot wrong here. Vocal performances ... exude a warm enthusiasm, and tech specifications could not be better. Michael Giacchino's full-bodied, traditional score is superlative ...\\" The Globe and Mail stated that Up is \\"the kind of movie that leaves you asking 'How do people come up with this stuff?'\\" along with an overall positive review on the film, despite it being predictable. The character of Carl Fredricksen has received mostly positive reception. Bill Capodagli, author of Innovate the Pixar Way, praised Carl for his ability to be a jerk and likable at the same time. Wall Street Journal editor Joe Morgenstern described Carl as gruff, comparing him to Buster Keaton, but adds that this begins to wear thin as the movie progresses. He has been compared with Spencer Tracy, an influence on the character, by The Washington Post editor Ann Hornaday and Empire Online editor Ian Freer, who describes him as similar to a \\"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner-era\\" Tracy. Entertainment Weekly editor Lisa Schwarzbaum described his appearance as a cross between Tracy and an eccentric out of a George Booth cartoon. TIME editor Richard Corliss also makes the comparison, calling him a \\"trash compacted version\\" of Tracy. He has also been compared to Walter Matthau, another inspiration for the character's design, by LA Weekly editor Scott Foundas, suggesting that actor Ed Asner was channeling him while performing the role of Carl. Variety editor Todd McCarthy described Carl as a combination of both Tracy and Matthau. The relationship between Carl and his wife Ellie has been praised in several media outlets. In his book Disney, Pixar, and the Hidden Message of Children's Films, author M. Keith Booker described the love between Carl and Ellie as touching. While also describing the scene of the two of them aging as a \\"masterpiece of its own kind,\\" he was not sure how much children would appreciate the scene, commenting that his son was squirming in his seat during the scene. Reelviews editor James Berardinelli praised their relationship, stating that it brought a tear to his eye in a way no animated film has done, including anything by famed anime director Hayao Miyazaki. Ann Hornaday praised the prologue, describing it as \\"worthy of Chaplin in its heartbreaking poignancy.\\" Chicago Tribune editor Michael Phillips praised the scene, describing it as an emotional and cinematic powerhouse, and that he also was nearly moved to tears. However, Salon editor Stephanie Zacharek criticized the love between Carl and Ellie, describing their marriage as resembling a dental adhesive commercial more than a real relationship. Edward Asner was praised in several media outlets for his portrayal of Carl. San Francisco Chronicle editor Mick LaSalle praised Asner as a great choice due to having a grumpiness to his voice that is not truly grumpy, but rather coming from a protective stance. Entertainment Weekly editor Lisa Schwarzbaum praised Asner's acting, stating that he has a \\"Lou Grant authority\\" to his voice. Time editor Richard Corliss stated that Asner had the \\"gruffness and deadpan comic timing to bring Carl to life.\\" The Boston Globe editor Ty Burr concurred with this, stating that his Lou Grant-like voice had not diminished with time. USA Today editor Claudia Puig praised Asner's delivery, describing it as superb. The formulation of Russell as an Asian-American character, along with the casting of an Asian-American in the role was met positively as well. Both Nagai and the film were awarded by the East West Players for the depiction of Russell. EWP lauded Pixar for the creation of the character, stating, \\"We are proud to honor a very progressive film company like Pixar who cast an Asian-American character alongside an elderly one to play the leads in a feature film.\\" The character is noted as Pixar's first lead Asian character, and was further positively received within the added context of historical non-Asian castings for Asian roles in entertainment. Asian-American organizations and entertainment websites, such as media watchdog Media Action Network for Asian Americans (MANAA), Racebending.com, and Angry Asian Man praised the character and Pixar for its diverse character depictions, noting the general lack of Asian-American lead characters and Asian actors cast in entertainment. In an interview with NPR in 2013, Angry Asian Man's Phil Yu reflected on the character's lack of typical Asian stereotyping, stating, \\"You know, he just happens to be Asian and he's, you know, really adorable character. But that kid could've been of any ethnicity but they made the effort to make him Asian‚Äîjust a little color, you know, and it's really wonderful when that kind of thing happens where they don't have to play that up and make it like a thing or a joke, which happens a lot.\\" ===Accolades=== Up won two awards at the 82nd Academy Awards, for Best Animated Feature and Best Original Score. It is the second of three animated features to have been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. Beauty and the Beast and Toy Story 3 were also nominated for Best Picture in their respective years. Up also won Best Original Score and Best Animated Feature Film at the 67th Golden Globe Awards. It was nominated for nine Annie Awards in eight categories, winning two awards for \\"Best Animated Feature\\" and \\"Best Directing in a Feature Production\\". Up also received the Golden Tomato from Rotten Tomatoes for highest-rating feature in 2009, and best reviewed animated film, with an approval of 98 percent from film critics, based on 259 reviews. At the 2010 Kids' Choice Awards the film won Favorite Animated Movie. Jordan Nagai was awarded the Breakout Performance Award at the 44th East West Players 44th Anniversary Visionary Awards and Silent Auction for his role as Russell by the East West Players. The organization also awarded the film with the EWP Visionary Award for its progressive casting of an Asian-American lead. Dug, the talking canine, was awarded the Palm Dog Award by the British film critics as the best canine performance at Cannes Film Festival, winning over the fox from Antichrist and the black poodle from Inglourious Basterds. ==Video games== On May 26, 2009, a video game of the same name was released for multiple platforms. Another video game, Kinect Rush: A Disney‚ÄìPixar Adventure, was released on March 20, 2012, for the Xbox 360. It features characters from five of Pixar's films: Up, The Incredibles, Cars, Ratatouille, and Toy Story. In 2018, a Lego The Incredibles video game was released which featured several references to Up and its characters. ==See also== * Cluster ballooning * Lawnchair Larry flight * Vera Coking, a real-estate holdout * Edith Macefield, another real-estate holdout ==References== ==External links== * * Pixar website * * * * * * * Category:2009 films Category:2009 computer-animated films Category:2009 3D films Category:3D animated films Category:2000s adventure comedy films Category:2000s American animated films Category:2000s fantasy adventure films Category:American 3D films Category:American adventure comedy films Category:American computer-animated films Category:American films Category:American fantasy adventure films Category:Animated films about birds Category:Animated films about dogs Category:Animated films about death Category:Animated films about friendship Category:English-language films Category:Films about old age Category:Films about real estate holdout Category:Films adapted into video games Category:Films about widowhood Category:Films set in South America Category:Films set in Venezuela Category:Films using computer-generated imagery Category:Pixar animated films Category:Walt Disney Pictures films Category:Films scored by Michael Giacchino Category:Films directed by Pete Docter Category:Films with screenplays by Pete Docter Category:Scouting in popular culture Category:Best Animated Feature Academy Award winners Category:Best Animated Feature BAFTA winners Category:Best Animated Feature Film Golden Globe winners Category:Films that won the Best Original Score Academy Award Category:2009 comedy films ","title":"Up (2009 film)"},{"id":"11659405","title":"Billy Gabor"},{"id":"11659427","text":"Brian Eugene Howard (born October 19, 1967) is an American former professional basketball player.

The lack of rain over large areas in 1971 has decimated the sheep population, which constitute the principal source of protein for a meat-eating nation; food crops also suffered severely. The year 1972 brings little relief, and the flow of people into Pakistan and Iran in quest of food continues. Both these countries again respond generously to the government's appeal for external assistance, and later in the year UN agencies give substantial help. Even so, by the fall the situation in some provinces, particularly Ghor, becomes desperate. Some 50,000-100,000 people, many of them women and children, face starvation. At this juncture, the UN Children's Emergency Fund rushes food, medicine, and clothing to the distressed area, and many people who would otherwise have perished are kept alive. The king and his government work tirelessly to overcome the national emergency, but the country's resources are still limited, communication with many outlying regions is not easy, and effective relief work is handicapped by local traditions of autonomy. One bright spot is the growing importance of the tourist industry. Foreign travelers naturally follow the excellent roads, constructed mainly with Soviet and U.S. help, that link the major cities, and are little tempted to go beyond the direct overland route from Europe to India and Nepal, in which Afghanistan is an essential link. Thus they are little affected by the distress in the outlying areas, and the foreign exchange that they bring into the country proves invaluable to the government. In foreign affairs Afghanistan's traditional policy of neutrality is strictly observed, and relations with all its neighbours remain friendly. No attempt is made to take advantage of Pakistan's difficulties, but, at the same time, economic and cultural contacts with India continue. ==December 1972== After a massive vote of no confidence in the lower house of parliament, King Zahir Shah accepts the resignation of the government of Abdul Zahir, which had come under severe criticism for its alleged failure to cope with the emergency. The king appoints Mohammad Musa Shafiq to form a new administration which takes office later in the month. Shafiq had been prominent in shaping the constitution of 1964, which banned members of the royal family from public office, and had thereby brought to an end the quasi-dictatorship of Gen. Sardar Mohammad Daud Khan, the king's cousin and brother-in-law, who had virtually ruled Afghanistan from 1953 to 1963. The new prime minister sets to work to deal with the economic crisis, mobilizing young officials, students, and army officers into a relief corps to distribute the foreign aid that pours into the country from the U.S. and from international agencies. Even so, it is estimated that approximately 80,000 people have died of starvation before supplies could reach them. Afghanistan Category:Years of the 20th century in Afghanistan Afghanistan ","title":"1972 in Afghanistan"},{"id":"11659439","text":"your bitcoinThe following lists events that happened during 1973 in Afghanistan. ==Incumbents== * Monarch: Mohammed Zahir Shah (until 17 July) * President: Mohammed Daoud Khan (starting 17 July) * Prime Minister: Mohammad Musa Shafiq (until 17 July) ==Beginning of 1973== Afghanistan's internal situation is dominated by difficulties arising from three successive seasons of drought in the central and northern areas of the country. In Ghor province, the shortage is particularly bad; famine is widespread and there are many deaths from starvation. Although massive Soviet and U.S. aid programs, supplemented by less ambitious efforts sponsored by China, Britain, France, India, and other countries, have done much to improve roads, power supplies, irrigation, and other essential elements of an economic substructure on which future progress could be based, the gap that divides Kabul from the outlying and backward areas shows little signs of closing. In those parts of the country the authority of the central government remains minimal, and small notice is taken of the men selected for parliament. Thus, the capital tends to be a world of its own, where governments change, where unrest is chronic, and where the country finds almost its only link with the outside world. ==July 1973== King Zahir Shah, whose personality has for many years ensured an element of continuity, absents himself in Italy for eye treatment. While he is out of the country, on July 17, Daoud Khan, who has long resented his exclusion from power, takes advantage of some discontent over promotions in the armed forces, along with student unrest and resentment among the educated classes against unemployment, to depose the king in a virtually bloodless coup. The King's forty-year reign was ended within a matter of minutes. Leftist military officers and civil servants of the Parcham faction, including the Air Force colonel Abdul Qadir, assist in the overthrow. Daud Khan abolishes the constitution of 1964 and establishes the Republic of Afghanistan with himself as president as well as foreign minister. He announces his adherence to Afghanistan's traditional policy of nonalignment, but is an acknowledged friend of the Soviet Union and a firm supporter of secessionist movements in the Pashto-speaking areas of Pakistan, the North-West Frontier Province and Balochistan - an outlook that seems likely to revive the friction with Pakistan that marked his earlier period of power. Zahir Shah formally abdicates on August 24, and remains in exile in Italy. Daud Khan attempts to introduce socioeconomic reforms, but gradually moves away from the socialist ideals his regime initially espoused. ==September 20, 1973== Radio Kabul announces the discovery of an allegedly Pakistan-backed plot to overthrow the new regime. A number of civilians and high-ranking military personalities are arrested, including former Prime Minister Mohammad Hashim Maiwandwal, who is later reported to have hanged himself on October 1 while awaiting trial. Five defendants are subsequently condemned to death and executed on December 25, while others receive long terms of imprisonment. A second attempted coup is foiled in December. The Kabul press accuses Pakistan of fomenting these conspiracies, but no solid evidence for the accusation is forthcoming. In view of Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's desire for friendly relations with Afghanistan, it seems more likely that the conspiracies were the products of domestic discontent. Afghanistan Category:Years of the 20th century in Afghanistan Afghanistan ","title":"1973 in Afghanistan"},{"id":"11659449","text":"The following lists events that happened during 1974 in Afghanistan. Throughout the year Afghanistan continues to suffer from the effects of the shortage of rainfall that afflicted the northern and central areas during the preceding three years. Many of the affected areas are remote and difficult to reach, lying beyond the main lines of communication and the few good highways laid down by Soviet and U.S. engineers as part of the massive aid programs of their respective countries. Daud Khan and his cabinet in Kabul do their best to mount rescue operations with the help of aid from abroad, but in areas where the subsistence level remains low, even in the best of times, deaths from starvation can not be prevented. Inevitably, discontent over the failure of the new republican regime to cope with economic difficulties manifests itself in a number of areas. In the capital itself, the euphoria that followed the abolition of the monarchy in 1973 and the attendant hopes for the dawn of a more democratic era begin to falter and fade in the face of the president's masterful rule. Many who expected an improvement in their position, including members of the armed services and the central bureaucracy, find themselves disappointed. Nevertheless, the president's personal authority over the central government is never effectively challenged. He commands the loyalty of the bulk of the armed forces, and their efficiency, thanks to Soviet help in both training and the supply of sophisticated weaponry, is high. The central government is strong enough to enforce its will upon outlying areas should the occasion arise. ==Incumbents== * President: Mohammed Daoud Khan ==Beginning of June 1974== President Daud pays a three-day official visit to Moscow, during which he signs an extensive economic cooperation agreement with the Soviet Union. The close ties with the Soviet Union are not allowed to imperil Afghanistan's cherished and traditional neutrality, however. During the year Daud also concludes a cooperation agreement with China and forms a new link with Bangladesh, to which he promises assistance. Only with Pakistan are his relations difficult; he continues to support schemes for the creation of an independent Pakhtunistan and a new \\"Greater Baluchistan\\" that, if realized, would give Afghanistan a corridor through friendly territory to the coast of the Arabian Sea. His representatives raise these questions at numerous international gatherings, including the Islamic summit held at Lahore, Pakistan, early in the year, but they receive little or no encouragement. However, this in no way diminishes Daud's determination to persist with his plans. ==Autumn 1974== It is announced that another attempt to overthrow the regime has been discovered and quashed; its leader has been executed and 11 participants imprisoned. Shortly afterward there is trouble in Takhar province, where the Muslim Brotherhood, which dislikes President Daud's secularizing policy, is very influential. The government is obliged to take stern action; 70 members of the brotherhood are arrested, along with the governor of the province, the Revenue Commissioner, and the Superintendent of Police, and all are brought to trial on charges of plotting against the state.

Under the energetic guidance of Mohammed Daoud Khan, considerable external help was secured for the construction of oil refineries, fertilizer factories, and various agricultural projects envisaged in the then current five-year plan, both China and the Soviet Union having contributed interest-free loans and technical aid. There were no serious challenges to the president's authority, supported by a regular army equipped with Soviet weaponry, although some spasmodic discontent with the prevalent economic stringency finds expression during the year. In foreign affairs, the government adheres firmly to the traditional policy of accepting external aid but refusing entangling alliances. Improved terms are secured from the Soviet Union for the sale of Afghanistan's natural gas, but this does not prevent equally friendly relations with China. Pakistan's actions against insurgents in Baluchistan and the North-West Frontier Province are bitterly criticized by the government and press in Kabul. The proscription by Pakistan of the National Awami Party, whose activities in Baluchistan and the North-West Frontier Province were favoured by Afghanistan, further worsens relations between the two countries.

Salvatore. ==Plot summary== The Arcane Brotherhood has long held the city of Luskan in their power, but when corruption eats away at their ranks, Captain Deudermont comes to the rescue of a city that has become a safe haven for the Sword Coast's most dangerous pirates. But rescuing a city from itself may not be as easy as Deudermont thinks, and when Drizzt can't talk him out of it, he'll be forced to help. The story begins with Captain Deudermont and the Sea Sprite crew still fighting pirates. One of the captured pirates raises questions of the effectiveness of Deudermont's actions, suggesting that Deudermont is allowed to capture pirates purely as a show and then stating that the Arklem Greeth, a lich who controls the Hosttower in the city of Luskan, supports the pirate trade. On Deudermont's return to Waterdeep, he meets with Lord Brambleberry of Waterdeep, and the two of them decide to stop Arklem Greeth and his pirate crews. Meanwhile, Drizzt and Regis decide to travel to Icewind Dale to learn the fate of Wulfgar. Their path leads them to Longsaddle, home of the Harpell family. During their visit, a philosophical debate ensues about crime and whether the 'greater good' justifies the use of severe punishment. Drizzt and Regis leave Longsaddle and head for Luskan, where they meet with captain Deudermont and learn of his plan. They decide to help in the fight. The task of saving Luskan is presented as moral conflict between trying to better the city at the risk of destroying it or accepting stability under less morally pure rule. After a few battles that tear the city apart, Arklem Greeth blows up the Hosttower, killing a large percentage of Luskan's population. With the war apparently over, Drizzt and Regis continue on their path to Icewind Dale. There they find Wulfgar living in a cave invaded by a carefree Drizzt and Wulfgar many years ago, testing himself against the harsh seasons before he plans to return to his people. Back in Luskan, while Deudermont tries to rebuild the city and keep the people of Luskan safe and fed, the High Captains work against Deudermont, hoping to turn the people of Luskan against him and assume the position of rulers. Eventually, civil war breaks out in Luskan. Drizzt and Regis return to help. The final battle sees the death of Deudermont, the sinking of the Sea Sprite, and the return of the rule of the High Captains in Luskan. Drizzt and Regis leave the city with the rest of Deudermont's crew. ==Reception== The Pirate King reached 8 on The New York Times bestseller list on November 2, 2008. ==References== Category:2008 American novels Category:Forgotten Realms novels Category:Novels by R.

Salvatore. ==Plot summary== When the Spellplague ravages Faer√ªn, old friends and foes alike are caught in the chaos. The blinding light released from the destruction of Crenshinibon burned out the eyes of the mighty Hephaestus, leaving him angry, sullen and defeated. A strand of Mystra's falling Weave released the necromancy of the ruined shard, reviving as apparitions the seven original liches that created it and giving sentience to the dead mind flayer Yharaskrik. Yharaskrik tricks Hephaestus into breathing onto Crenshinibon again, which transforms the dragon into a dracolich. Yharaskrik compels Hephaestus to smash Crenshinibon into his skull, binding them together. Yharaskrik's sentience then binds with Hephaestus/Crenshinibon, the three becoming the Ghost King. The three minds, with no privacy and never alone in the one body, had a great shared power: the dracolich's flight, strength, breath and an aura of death and disease, the militant and strategic mind - as well as psionic powers - of the mind-flayer, and the Crystal Shard's necromantic powers and patience combined. Seeking revenge on those responsible for his blindness, the mind of Hephaestus immediately set his sights on Jarlaxle Baenre. Traveling with the silly, but undeniably dangerous, dwarf Athrogate, the latter rhyming the whole way, Jarlaxle snapped out of Reverie one night at the intrusion of the dracolich threatening to find him. Not unintelligent, Jarlaxle had not missed the Spellplague beginning around him as Mystra's Weave itself collapsed. And after being attacked - first by the undead and second by one of Crenshinibon's liches, who he inadvertently destroyed when he threw his pocket hole dimension over the top of the lich, which collided with the dimensional gate the lich contained - they caused a rift and the lich disappeared. He knew the only way to survive and perhaps stop this horrid monstrosity of a foe was to enlist the help of the mighty drow Drizzt, as well as the holy Deneirrath priest Cadderly. He also knew, due to the last encounter with Cadderly - ending in a threat should Jarlaxle ever return to Spirit Soaring - that the only way to get Cadderly was to get Drizzt, and the only way to Drizzt was Cadderly. As he journeyed to Mithral Hall, attempting to discern a way to get the drow on his side, he learned of a terrible side effect of Mystra's falling Weave touching Drizzt's wife Catti- brie. He then decides his only chance - maybe Faer√ªn's only chance - was to convince Drizzt that Cadderly was her only chance and to let him go with him as well. After using a disguised Athrogate to convince Bruenor and Drizzt that Cadderly was Catti-brie's best hope, Jarlaxle meets up with Drizzt, Bruenor and Pwent, explains to him their plight and how their problems may be connected. Meanwhile, Spirit Soaring is filled with priests, mages, sages and scholars of all sorts, all gathered to discuss the recent failures in magic, the failure of some gods to answer but not others and other effects of the Spellplague. Shortly after Cadderly's children and the druidic dwarf Pikel arrive at Carradoon, the town starts being assaulted by the Ghost King's undead which, despite their great martial prowess, drives them and the town's people deep into caves under the mountain. At the same time creatures of the Shadow Plane begin assaulting Spirit Soaring but the combined might of the remaining empowered priests and wizards, led by Cadderly, hold them off until sunrise, when they retreat. Shortly after, as the remaining people at Spirit Soaring equip themselves with magical weapons of the cathedral's collection, their patrols begin to report heavier losses as magic begins to fail completely. Cadderly attempts to find Deneir and finds his god weaving the Metatext and therefore himself into the broken Weave to fix the damage and stabilize it. Soon after, a group of priests and mages who have lost faith sally forth against Cadderly's advice to escape and return a few minutes later as zombies at the forefront of an army of shadow creatures, who had returned even during the day. Drizzt and company run into Danica, Cadderly's wife, who had been out searching for their missing children when she stumbled across what appeared to be the death of Ivan Bouldershoulder at the Ghost King's foot. Barely escaping alive and with Jarlaxle's help, she recovers in time for them to reach the battle at Spirit Soaring. They attempt to press through with the unconscious Catti-brie on a wagon but not even a fierce charge by the dwarven heroes followed by the speed of the drow could break through the unstoppable tide. Seeing his wife and some friends in danger, his need to act called out and something answered. Reciting off unknown spells, he creates a flying horse and carriage out of a cloud and rides down to rescue the fighters below displaying godlike power in the form of potent and great unknown spells. The Ghost King is defeated but escapes to the Shadowfell, where he recovers rapidly. He returns and is defeated a second time, disappearing to the Shadowfell again. Cadderly uses Catti-brie as a conduit to enter the Shadowfell to finish off the Ghost King. In the end, Cadderly defeats the Ghost King at the cost of his life and becomes the new Ghost King, forever reinforcing and guarding the ward containing the rift left by the old Ghost King. The rift is in the shattered remains of Spirit Soaring. Catti-brie is allowed one last night with Drizzt, before she and Regis both die from the Spellplague and are taken by Mielikki as a reward partly to Drizzt. The goddess puts them into a pocket paradise plane for all time. ==Reception== The Ghost King reached 11 on The New York Times bestseller list on October 25, 2009. ==References== Category:2009 American novels Category:Forgotten Realms novels Category:Novels by R.

Kentucky was classified as the Upper South or a Border state,Tobacco and Staple Agriculture and enslaved African Americans represented 24% by 1830, but declined to 19.5% by 1860 on the eve of the Civil War. The majority of slaves in Kentucky were concentrated in the cities of Louisville and Lexington, in the fertile Bluegrass Region as well the Jackson Purchase, both the largest hemp- and tobacco-producing areas in the state. In addition, many slaves lived in the Ohio River counties where they were most often used in skilled trades or as house servants. Few slaves lived in the mountainous regions of eastern and southeastern Kentucky. Those slaves that were held in eastern and southeastern Kentucky served primarily as artisans and service workers in towns.http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ky/state/counties/pendleton/african/blackslavekyquestion.htm As a border state positoned between free states to the north and fellow slave owning states to the south, with both independent, hardscrabble white farming families as well as plantations like those of the deep south, Kentucky had economic ties to both slavery, engagement with northern free state industrialism and also western frontier ethos. Kentucky entered the Union as a state deeply divided over the issue of slavery. The conflicting pulls of northern economic relations, westward expansion, and fundamental support for slavery and southern-style plantations caused Kentuckians to be morally divided over the issue of slavery before, during, and immediately after the Civil War. Though loyal to the Union during the Civil War, the majority of Kentucky didn't see a profound need to end slavery and, as with most of the country, held notions of distinctions between white and black races in which whites were considered more advanced, superior.http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ky/state/counties/pendleton/african/blackslavekyquestion.htm ==Overview== Prior to 1792, Kentucky formed the far-western frontier of Virginia, which had a long history of slavery and indentured servitude. In early Kentucky history slavery was an integral part of the state's economy, though the use of slavery varied widely in a geographically diverse state. From 1790 to 1860, the slave population of Kentucky was never more than one- quarter of the total population. After 1830, as tobacco production decreased in favor of less labor-intensive crops, much of the planter class in the central and western part of the state sold their slaves to markets in the Deep South, where the demand for agricultural labor rose rapidly as cotton cultivation was expanded. It was lucrative for slave owners to sell their slaves to the deep south, shipping approximately 80,000 Africans southward between 1830 and 1860.http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ky/state/counties/pendleton/african/blackslavekyquestion.htm Kentucky's slave population was concentrated in the \\"bluegrass\\" region of the state, which was rich in farmland and a center of agriculture. In less populated mountainous areas of Kentucky with independent farmers, slave holding was much less frequent. In 1850, 28 percent of Kentucky's white families held enslaved African Americans, but only 5% had 100 or more slaves. In Lexington, slaves outnumbered slave owners: 10,000 slaves were owned by only 1,700 slave owners. Lexington was a central city in the state for the slave trade.https://www.onlyinyourstate.com/kentucky/square-dark-and-evil- history-ky/ Only 12 percent of Kentucky‚Äôs slave owners owned 20 or more slaves, just 70 white families held 50 or more slaves. Fluctuating markets, seasonal needs and widely varying geographical conditions characterized Kentucky slavery.http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ky/state/counties/pendleton/african/blackslavekyquestion.htm Slaves were part of the settlement of Kentucky in the 1750s and 1760s, as permanent settlers started arriving in the late 1770s, especially after the American Revolution, some brought slaves to clear and develop the land. Early settlements were called stations and developed around forts for protection against indigenous peoples such as the Shawnee, Cherokee, Chickasaw and Osage, with whom there were numerous violent conflicts. Most of the early settlers were from Virginia, and some continued to rely on slave labor as they developed larger, more permanent plantations. Planters who grew hemp and tobacco, which were labor-intensive crops, held more slaves than did smaller farmers who cultivated mixed crops. Subsistence agriculture could be done without any slave labor, although some subsistence farmers held a few slaves with whom they would work. Some owners also used enslaved African Americans in mining and manufacturing operations, for work on riverboats and along the waterfront, and to work in skilled trades in towns. Early farms in Kentucky tended to be smaller than the later plantation complexes common in the Deep South, so most slaveholders had a small number of slaves. As a result, many slaves had to find spouses \\"abroad\\", on a neighboring farm. Often, African American men had to live apart from their wives and children. It was not infrequent for slaves to be \\"hired out,\\" leased on temporary basis to other farmers or business for seasonal work. This was a common practice across the upper south. Some historians estimate that 12% of the slaves in Lexington and 16% of the slaves in Louisville were hired out.https://civilwargovernors.org/understanding-the-complexities-of-slavery- in-kentucky/ Kentucky contained small but notable free black hamlets throughout the state. About 5% of Kentucky's black population was free by 1860.http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ky/state/counties/pendleton/african/blackslavekyquestion.htm Free Negros were among the slaveholders; in 1830, this group held slaves in 29 of Kentucky's counties. In some cases, people would purchase their spouse, their children, or other enslaved relatives in order to protect them until they could free them. After the 1831 Nat Turner's slave rebellion, the legislature passed new restrictions against manumission, requiring acts of the legislature to gain freedom.Notable Kentucky African Americans Database: Slave Owners, Slaves, Free Blacks, Free Mulattoes in Kentucky, 1850-1870 [by county N-Z, University of Kentucky, accessed 2 December 2013] Kentucky exported more slaves than did most states. From 1850 to 1860, 16 percent of enslaved African Americans were sold out of state, as part of the forced displacement to the Deep South of a total of more than a million African Americans before the Civil War. Many slaves were sold directly to plantations in the Deep South from the Louisville slave market, or were transported by slave traders along the Ohio and Mississippi rivers to slave markets in New Orleans, hence the later euphemism \\"sold down the river\\" for any sort of betrayal. Kentucky had a surplus of slaves due to reduced labor needs from changes in local agriculture, as well as substantial out-migration by white families from Kentucky. Beginning in the 1820s and extending through the 1840s and 1850s, many white families migrated west to Missouri, south to Tennessee, or southwest to Texas. The larger slave-holding families took slaves with them, as one kind of forced migration. These factors combined to create greater instability for enslaved families in Kentucky than in some other areas. ==Fugitive slaves== Because of Kentucky was separated from free states only by the Ohio River, it was relatively easy for an enslaved person from Kentucky to escape to freedom. Notable fugitives from Kentucky included Henry Bibb, Lewis Clarke, Margaret Garner, Lewis Hayden, and Josiah Henson. The formerly enslaved James Bradley legally left Kentucky by this route. A mass escape attempt occurred in August 1848, when 55 to 75 armed slaves fled from several counties, representing one of the largest coordinated escape attempts in American history. They were captured by the state militia several days later after a shootout. ==Abolitionism== The abolition movement developed in the state by the 1790s, when Presbyterian minister David Rice unsuccessfully lobbied to include a slavery prohibition in each of the state's first two constitutions, created in 1792 and 1799. Baptist ministers David Barrow and Carter Tarrant formed the Kentucky Abolition Society in 1808. By 1822, it began publishing one of America's first anti-slavery periodicals. Conservative emancipation, which argued for gradually freeing the slaves and assisting them in a return to Africa, as proposed by the American Colonization Society, gained substantial support in the state from the 1820s onward. Cassius Marcellus Clay was a vocal advocate of this position. His newspaper was shut down by mob action in 1845. The anti-slavery Louisville Examiner was published successfully from 1847 to 1849. ==Politics== In Kentucky, slavery was not as integral to the economy as it developed in the Deep South. The small-farm nature of much of Kentucky meant that slave labor was not so critical to profits as it was for the labor-intensive crops of the Deep South, such as cotton, sugar, and rice farming. But Louisville became a major slave market, which generated considerable profits. Controversial laws in 1815 and 1833 limited the importation of slaves into Kentucky, which created the strictest rules of any slave state. The Nonimportation Act of 1833 banned any importation of slaves for commercial or personal purpose. The ban was widely violated, especially in counties near the Tennessee border. Slavery was the principal issue that led to the third constitutional convention held in 1849. While the convention was convened by anti-slavery advocates who hoped to amend the constitution to prohibit slavery, they greatly underestimated pro-slavery support. The convention became packed with pro-slavery delegates, who drafted what some historians consider the most pro-slavery constitution in United States history. It repealed the prohibition on bringing slaves into the state. After the embarrassing defeat, abolitionists lost political power during the 1850s. Anti-slavery newspapers were still published in Louisville and Newport; but support for slavery was widespread in Louisville. Thousands of households in Louisville owned slaves, and the city had the largest slave population in the state. In addition, for years the slave trade from the Upper South had contributed to its prosperity and growth. Through the 1850s, the city exported 2,500-4,000 slaves a year in sales to the Deep South. The trading city had grown rapidly and had 70,000 residents by 1860.Slavery in the Cities: The South, 1820-1860 John Gregg Fee established a network of abolitionist schools, communities and churches in Eastern Kentucky,(see Berea College, Berea, KY) where slaveholders were the fewest in number. In the turmoil following John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry, Fee and his supporters were driven from the state by a mob in 1859. ==Civil War== Kentucky did not abolish slavery during the Civil War, as did the border states of Maryland and Missouri. However, during the war, about 75% of slaves in Kentucky were freed or escaped to Union lines. The war undermined the authority of master over slave. Slaves quickly learned that authority and protection resided with the Union army. When Union military lines moved into areas previously held by Confederates, slaveholders often fled leaving property and slaves behind. Most of these abandoned slaves immediately assumed the stance of free blacks. The war broke down the control that slaveowners had on slaves. By 1862 it had become common for Kentucky slaves to ask for wages in return for their labor. When denied, slaves often fled the plantation. Another move was for unsupervised slaves to enlist in the Union army, thereby securing the rights of free men. By the war's end Kentucky had mustered 23,703 blacks into federal service.https://historyengine.richmond.edu/episodes/view/4033 The Kentucky legislature considered a conditional ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment, to deny freedmen and other blacks constitutional rights and require them to leave the state within ten years of freedom. Instead, it rejected the Amendment.Vorenberg, Final Freedom (2001), p. 217. Even after the conclusion of the Civil War and fall of the Confederacy, slaveholders in Kentucky continued to believe that slavery would continue to exist, and continued to hold and trade enslaved people through most of 1865. Slavery legally ended in the US on December 18, 1865, when the 13th Amendment became part of the Constitution. The 13th Amendment was not ratified in the state until 1976.Lowell Harrison & James C.

This was the era of the local version of beat music; which included 1960s garage rock, proto-punk and pop. Their initial line-up included, Jeff W Donoghue on bass guitar, Ian Kinkead on drums, Bob Millar and Gary Schober on guitars. The later, Deakins 'trio' released two singles in 1966, \\"Tonight You're Gonna Fall in Love with Me\\" and \\"Take Me for a Little While\\", via GO!!. The band regularly appeared on the related TV pop music weekly series, The Go!! Show, and on daily weekday show, Kommotion, both broadcast by ATV-0. The Deakins disbanded in 1973. == History == The Deakins were a Melbourne-based band created in 1963, originally as a 1960s pop, surf rock quartet, with Jeff W Donoghue on bass guitar, Ian Kinkead on drums, Bob Millar on lead guitar and Gary Schober on rhymth guitar. Each member would also participate with vocals. They reformed as a trio and later as a quintet. They performed in Melbourne, Geelong, Torquay and Warrnambool. In developing their sound they focused on three-part vocal harmonies. Jeff Donoghue used a Fender Bass VI (six string bass guitar), as part of his performance. For over three years, they were the resident band at a Geelong Saturday dance venue, Surf City, later renamed, Teen Scene. They also worked at many surf club dances along the Victorian southern coast, near the Great Ocean Road region. In Melbourne, the Deakins performed at a variety of music venues as well. These include some notable locations that have avoided demolition, like the George Hotel, in St. Kilda, Victoria and Festival Hall (Melbourne). During years, 1964 to 1965 each member turned 18-years-old and, with Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War, each registered for possible conscription into National Service. None were chosen to serve and the group decided to turn professional. Their decision to do so, in 1965, resulted in Schober departing. They were part of the second wave of rock and roll in Australia. As a trio of Jeff Donoghue, Ian Kinkead and Bob Millar, in 1966 the Deakins were signed to the GO!! label. In one morning session, early in 1966, the Deakins' GO!! recordings were produced by Ron Tudor and engineered by Roger Savage at Armstrong Studios in South Melbourne. They recorded four tracks, for two singles, \\"Tonight You're Gonna Fall in Love with Me\\" (cover version of the Shirelles' 1964 track) and \\"Take Me for a Little While\\" (originally by Evie Sands in 1965), which were both issued in 1966. The B-side of their second single, \\"Look and Learn\\", was written by Donoghue, with guitar arrangement by Millar. During 1966 they regularly appeared on TV pop music shows, Kommotion and The Go!! Show, both broadcast on ATV-0. In 1967 Kommotion finished up early in the year, while The Go!! Show ended in August. Go Records ceased by 1968. Consequently, along with a wave of other artists of the time, the Deakins' GO!! era had ended. The group continued working in the club and pub circuit around Melbourne. During the Vietnam War, in the early 1970s, Kinkead, departed the group to join with other musicians to entertain the American soldiers serving in Southern Vietnam. When Kinkead returned to Melbourne in 1972 they reformed as a quintet, with Donoghue, Kinkead and Millar, joined by two new members from Kinkead's Vietnam experience. The group, with a second lead singer and a keyboard player, performed in a new music era, the Australian pub rock scene. The 1960s weekend dance hall venues were obsolete. External pressures and demands caused the Deakins to disband in 1973. Their last appearances were at the Blackburn Hotel (see Blackburn). == Legacy == The GO!! Shows archives are limited in number today and although over 200 shows were performed they are rare collectors items now. The Deakins performances of \\"Look and Learn\\" and \\"Tonight you're gonna fall in love\\" was recorded on series three, episode 117, on 28 November 1966. The tape for this episode survived. Other artists appearing on the shows were numerous and some of the other rare tapes to remain, including extracts of performances by a then young singer, Olivia Newton-John. Decades on, after a resurgence of interest in the music of the Sixties for Australian garage groups, other Australian Record Companies have rescued the Deakins' song set from the archives.

A. Salvatore, whose related works include The Legend of Drizzt series and The Hunter's Blades Trilogy. It contains three books, Servant of the Shard (also included as the third book in the Paths of Darkness quartet, which books were later published as the 11th through 14th books of The Legend of Drizzt), Promise of the Witch King, and Road of the Patriarch. ==Plot== The trilogy continues the tale of the infamous assassin, Artemis Entreri, previously featured in books as Drizzt Do'Urden's self-proclaimed archenemy, and the cunning drow mercenary, Jarlaxle, previously relevant as the leader of Bregan D'aerthe, an outlaw group of drow based primarily in and around Menzoberranzan, that does business mostly with the drow of Menzoberranzan. Continuing the story of Artemis and Jarlaxle told in the Paths of Darkness series, Artemis and Jarlaxle begin an adventure that tests their skills, their minds, and their souls. While the two characters are antagonists in the Drizzt Do'Urden series, in The Sellswords trilogy they are the main characters of some of the few books in Salvatore's Forgotten Realms novels that do not focus on the legendary drow warrior, Drizzt Do'Urden, as the hero of the novel. The Sellswords develops the two characters more deeply than was possible in the other Salvatore books, giving the reader an in depth view of the mind of the cold, calculating Artemis Entreri and the ambitious, opportunistic Jarlaxle. ==Works included== # Servant of the Shard (2000) # Promise of the Witch King (2005) # Road of the Patriarch (2006) ==Reception== Pat Ferrara of mania.com comments: \\"The second book of arguably the coolest Forgotten Realms literary spin-off to date, Promise of the Witch-King continues the Sellswords Series without skipping a beat. Tightly knit plotlines, absurd yet memorable and engaging characters, and hellishly fast-paced storytelling culminate in a wild melee of swords and sorcery led by the master himself.\\" The audio recording of Road of the Patriarch received a favorable review from California Bookwatch, which praised all aspects of the novel, including the plot, the action, and the narration by David Colacci. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Forgotten Realms novel series ","title":"The Sellswords"},{"id":"11659586","text":"≈åmiya Â§ßÂÆÆ is a Japanese word originally used for the imperial palace or shrines, now a common name, and may refer to: ==People== *≈åmiya (surname), a Japanese surname *≈åmiya, or is a female character in The Tale of Genji, an 11th-century novel ==Places== *≈åmiya Palace *≈åmiya Bonsai Village, famous for bonsai pot gardening is located in Kita-ku, Saitama, Japan *≈åmiya-shuku, the fourth station on the 17-19th-century Japanese national highway Nakasend≈ç, located in current ≈åmiya-ku, Saitama *Railway stations: See ≈åmiya Station (disambiguation) for an incomplete list *Refugee Camps: Omiya Refugee Camp in Gwere, Uganda. *Local governments: ** Current ward/government names *** ≈åmiya- ku, Saitama, ≈åmiya, Saitama, Japan. *** Hitachi-≈åmiya, Ibaraki, ≈åmiya, Naka District, Ibaraki, Japan *** :ja:≈åmiya , Miyazaki, Miyazaki was ≈åmiya, Miyazaki District, Miyazaki, Japan ** Past government names *** ≈åmiya, Kitaadachi District, Saitama was a city and its area is now Kita-ku, Minuma- ku, Nishi-ku and ≈åmiya-ku of Saitama, Saitama, Japan *** ≈åmiya, Chichibu District, Saitama was a town and now is a part of Chichibu, Saitama, Japan *** ≈åmiya, Watarai District, Mie was a town and now is a part of Taiki, Mie, Japan *** ≈åmiya, Naka District, Ky≈çto was a town and now is a part of Ky≈çtango, Kyoto, Japan *** ≈åmiya, Fuji District, Shizuoka was a town and now is part of Fujinomiya, Shizuoka, Japan *** ≈åmiya, Minami-Aizu District, Fukushima was a village and now is a part of Minamiaizu, Fukushima, Japan *** ≈åmiya, Shioya District, Tochigi was a village and now is a part of Shioya, Tochigi, Japan *** ≈åmiya, Shimotsuga District, Tochigi was a village and now is a part of Tochigi, Tochigi, Japan *** ≈åmiya, Oku District, Okayama was a village and now is divided into Okayama, Okayama and Setouchi, Okayama, Japan *** ≈åmiya, Hino District, Tottori was a village and now is a part of Nichinan, Tottori, Japan *** ≈åmiya, Inashiki District, Ibaraki was a village and now is a part of Ry≈´gasaki, Ibaraki, Japan ==Sports== *Omiya Ardija, a professional football (soccer) club based in ≈åmiya-ku, Saitama, Japan and ≈åmiya Park Soccer Stadium ","title":"≈åmiya"},{"id":"11659590","text":"Hyderabadi cuisine (native: Hyderabadi Ghizaayat), also known as Deccani cuisine, is the native cooking style of the Hyderabadi Muslims, and began to develop after the foundation of the Bahmani Sultanate, and more drastically with the Qutb Shahi dynasty around the city of Hyderabad, promoting the native cuisine along with their own. Hyderabadi cuisine had become a princely legacy of the Nizams of Hyderabad State, as it began to further develop further on from there. It is an amalgamation of Mughal, Turkish, and Arabic along with the influence of the native Telugu and Marathwada cuisines. Hyderabadi cuisine comprises a broad repertoire of rice, wheat and meat dishes and the skilled use of various spices, herbs and natural edibles. Hyderabadi cuisine has different recipes for different events, and hence is categorized accordingly, from banquet food, for weddings and parties, festival foods, and travel foods. The category to which the recipe belongs itself speaks of different things like the time required to prepare the food, the shelf life of the prepared item, etc. The legacy of authentic Hyderabadi cuisine and its unabridged royal saga of dishes and recipes is believed to still persist with old Deccan families. ==History== ===Medieval period=== The Deccan region is an inland area in India. The native cuisine was prominent until the Vijayanagara Empire lasted, it was during the rule of Delhi Sultanate, Muhammad bin Tughluq when he shifted the capital from Delhi to Daulatabad, the Deccan region adopted the foreign cuisines. In the 14th century when the Bahmani Sultanate was formed by revolting against the Delhi Sultanate in Deccan, the Turkish noblemen were appointed in the high positions, and introduced the Turkish cuisine. The two- centuries-long political instability in the region of the Deccan and the main Central Mughal authority and migration has introduced Deccan with multiple foreign cuisines. In Deccan medieval cuisine, banquets were common among the aristocracy. Multiple courses would be prepared and served in a style called DastarkhƒÅn (A long cloth laid on the floor on which food dishes and dinners plates are placed). Food was generally eaten by hand, served on among commons and nobility. The food was mostly meat oriented being grilled and fried in tandoor. The curry were highly seasoned and flavored by using spices. Fruits were preferred rather than dessert after main course. Once the meals are ended Kahwa (liquid hot drink) was consumed that contains ingredients to digest food. The ingredients of the cuisine varied greatly according to the seasons and festivals, and many items were preserved in the form of Pickles. ===Modern period=== The modern cuisine was evolved during the Nizams in the mid-17th century, and elevated to a sublime art form. Hyderabad has a history of continuous influx of migrants from all over the world and in general from the Indian sub-continent, particularly since 1857. Most of the foreign food had been improved to suit the culinary preferences, resulting to form the unique derivative cuisine that excels over the original. Biryani (Turkish) and Haleem (Arabic) for instance is prepared all over India, but the Hyderabadi variety is ultimately from the Hyderabadi Biryani and Hyderabadi Haleem. Til ke chatuni with Arabic tahini, Persian dried lamb with beans is modified with dalcha, tandoori naan of Uzbek (Central Asia) to create Sheermal. Most of the modern day desserts in Hyderabadi cuisine were introduced and invented during the times of Nizams, today that had become an integral part of cuisine. Hyderabadi cuisine is an integral part of the cuisines of the former Hyderabad State that includes the state of Telangana and the regions of Marathwada (now in Maharashtra) and Kalyana-Karanataka (now in Karnataka). The Hyderabadi cuisine contains city-specific specialties like Hyderabad (Hyderabadi biryani and Hyderabadi Haleem) and Aurangabad (Naan Qalia), Parbhani (Biryani and Tahari), Bidar (Kalyani Biryani) and others. The use of dry coconut, tamarind, and red chillies along with other spices are the main ingredients that make Hyderabadi cuisine different from the North Indian cuisine. ==Course== Hyderabadi dinner also known as Dastarkhwan are usually of five course meal; Aghaz (Soup), Mezban (appetizers), Waqfa (Sorbet), Mashgool Dastarkhwan (Main course) and Zauq-e-shahi (dessert). ==Starters== ===Lukhmi=== Lukhmi is a regional non-vegetarian variation of the samosa, though, it is shaped into a flat square patty. It is made from flour and stuffed with minced mutton or beef, known as Kheema. It is eaten as an evening snack or served as a starter at celebrations. Murtabak Murtabak is often described as spicy folded omelette pancake with bits of vegetables. It is the most common form of Murtabak; which is egg-filled pancake, sometimes mixed with green onion and minced meat, made from pan fried crepes which is folded and cut to squares.https://www.deccanchronicle.com/140309/commentary-sunday- chronicle/article/rich-medley-nawabi-flavours ===Hyderabadi Haleem=== Hyderabadi Haleem is a popular dish of Hyderabad. It is a stew composed of mutton, lentils, spices and wheat. It originates from Harees, an Arab dish brought to Hyderabad by Arab migrants. Harees is still prepared in its original form in Barkas. It is sometimes served as a starter at celebrations, but it is usually only prepared during the month of Ramadan for the Iftar meal. ===Biryani=== Hyderabadi Biryani with salad (left), Mirchi-ka-Salan (top right), and Dahi-ki-Chutney (top left). The layer of meat is hidden under the layer of rice. Hyderabadi Biryani is one of the most popular dishes of the city. It is distinctly different from other variations of the Biryani, originating from the kitchens of the Nizams of Hyderabad. It is a celebration dish of basmati rice and mutton, along with yoghurt, onions and various spices. ===Variants=== * Kalyani Biryani is a variant of the Hyderabadi Biryani using beef instead of lamb or mutton. This meal was started after Kalyani Nawabs of Bidar came to Hyderabad sometime in the 18th century. The Kalyani biryani is made with small cubes of beef, regular spices, onions and many tomatoes. It has a distinct tomato, jeera (cumin), dhania (coriander) flavour. *Degh ki biryani is a typical biryani made from small cubes of Beef or mutton. This biryani is famous in Parbhani and generally serves in marriages. :The meat is flavoured with ginger, garlic, red chili, cumin, garam masala, fried onion and Curd. This biryani is also known as kachay gosht ki biryani or the dum biryani, where the meat is marinated and cooked along with the rice. It is left on a slow fire or dum for a fragrant and aromatic flavor. * Tahari, made by the Hyderabadi Muslims is a rice and meat dish. Unlike biryani in which rice is precooked and then layered with meat, rice in tahari is cooked in meat. Occasionally vegetables, more commonly potatoes, are also added. It is served with dahi ki chutney. == Other dishes == === Pathar-ka- Gosht === Pathar ka Gosht is a mutton kebab. It is named for the traditional method of preparation, on a stone slab. (Pathar means stone in Urdu as well Hindi)https://www.deccanchronicle.com/140710/lifestyle-food/article/pathar-ka- gosht-vanishing-delicacy ===Hyderabadi Khichdi=== The Hyderabadi version of the popular dish Khichdi is distinct from the many variants enjoyed all across India. It is eaten with Kheema (minced mutton curry). It is consumed as a breakfast item, as well as during the month of Ramadan for the Sehri meal. === Talawa Gosht === Tala hua Gosht, or Talawa Gosht (in Hyderabadi dialect) is a simple mutton or beef dish usually accompanied by Khatti Dal. It may be eaten with Roti or rice. ==Desserts== Faluda * * Qubani ka meetha (Khubani-ka- Meetha) - Apricot Pudding, Toppings with almond and cream.

It is a Grade I listed building. The gardens are Grade II listed in the English Heritage Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest. ==History== Lake House was built in 1578 for George Duke, a wealthy clothier, shortly after he acquired the manor of Lake. The house is built of Chilmark stone, the pale limestone from which Salisbury Cathedral was also built, and flint chequerwork: its treatment at Lake House has been described as \\"an outstanding example of this technique\\". The house has two storeys, with basement and attic areas; the stone mullion windows have transoms. It has gabled terracotta-tiled roofs and the chimneys are diagonally-set. Its west front faces the road and is symmetrical, forming a five-part pattern of central projecting porch, flanked on either side by recessed windows and then at each end by semi-octagonal bay windows. The projecting bay areas carry up the full height of the two storeys and are topped by crenallations. There are five small windowed gables at roof level. The Duke family shield is above the doorway. It is thought that the original building was L-shaped, with the principal block facing west (as today) and the shorter block running eastwards behind its northern end. It has been suggested that this north wing may incorporate part of an earlier house. A parallel wing, which partly fills the internal angle of the L, is thought to have been built to accommodate a Georgian staircase in the late 18th century. In 1897 the house left the possession of the Duke family for the first time in nine generations, when the widow of the Rev. Edward Duke (1814‚Äì95), who was an archaeologist and colleague of Richard Colt Hoare, sold the house. The buyer, Joseph Lovibond, had the house thoroughly restored under the direction of architect Detmar Blow working with the advice of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. The work was considered \\"a showpiece of restoration at a time when methods of restoring were the subject of much controversy.\\" Only fifteen years later, in 1912, the house was completely gutted by fire, and all of the original period features and fittings were destroyed. Detmar Blow again oversaw the restoration, altering the plan and using appropriate late 16th and 17th century chimneypieces and panelling salvaged from other buildings of the period. Lovibond died in 1918 and the house and its estate was sold to Lord Glenconner, who united it with that of Wilsford. Lord Glenconner never lived in the house, instead letting it to tenants. After the death of Lord Glenconner's widow, Lady Grey, the house and combined estates were purchased by its second tenant, Lt. Col. F. G. G. Bailey. In 1933 Bailey commissioned architect Darcy Braddell to make additions to the house, in a style sympathetic to the original, and again using architectural elements and internal fittings salvaged from elsewhere. At the south-east corner a single- storey dining hall was built, with a barrel vaulted ceiling and large oriel window; a spectacular seventeenth century carved stone chimneypiece; panelling and carved frieze dated 1633, to which Bailey had his family initials added, and plaster ceiling from a London livery company. At the same time the 18th- century wing adjoining it was given a gabled treatment to bring it into harmony with the rest of the building. To the north of the dining hall were added kitchens and offices on two levels, extending across the east part of the house. In 1956 the estates were in the ownership of Lady Janet Bailey, Col. Bailey's widow. The house was purchased by musician Sting and his wife Trudie Styler in 1990.https://www.sodajerker.com/episode-140-sting/ timestamp 25:57 Sting recorded his album Ten Summoner's Tales in the house, and the couple run an organic farm on the estate. In 1999 Styler co-authored The Lake House Cookbook, with her chef, Joseph Sponzo, which contains photographs and information about the house. The gardens of Lake House were featured in the 2017 book The Secret Gardeners by Victoria Summerley and photographer Hugo Rittson Thomas.Summerley and Rittson Thomas, 2017 pg. 236 ==Meteorite== A chondrite meteorite sat by the doorstep of Lake House for at least 80 years, before being donated to the Natural History Museum when the Bailey family sold Lake House in 1991; it is now on display in Salisbury Museum. It is the largest meteorite known to have fallen in the UK, and is thought to have been hidden in a prehistoric burial mound, before being excavated in the 19th century by Edward Duke. == References == *Summerley, Victoria, and Rittson Thomas, Hugo (2017) The Secret Gardeners Francis Lincoln ==Further reading== *Architectural Review 1899 Volume 5, 171‚Äì9. *Country Life Vol 23, 8 February 1908, pp 198‚Äì203 *Country Life Vol 81, 27 March 1937; pp 326‚Äì331 *Country Life Vol 81, 3 April 1937; pp 352‚Äì7 *B.

This body of notables nominated by the provincial governors last met in 1973 to ratify the abolition of the monarchy and the birth of the republic. Its task in 1977 is to approve a new constitution, the main features of which are the vesting of wide powers in the President as Head of State, henceforward to be elected by the Grand Assembly every six years, and the reaffirmation of Islamic institutions as the core of national life. The Assembly approves the constitution on February 14, having written in several new articles and amended others. It endorses the president's policy of nonalignment in foreign affairs and the cultivation of friendship with other Islamic countries. ==March 2, 1977== Agreement on the resumption of air communications between Afghanistan and Pakistan and India is reached, as relations continue to improve. The idea of a \\"Pakhtun\\" state is not abandoned, but support for it is less strident. ==March 18, 1977== Daud Khan appoints a new cabinet composed of sycophants, friends, sons of friends, and even collateral members of the royal family. Daud continues to be responsible for the office of Foreign Minister but relinquishes the Defense portfolio. ==April 12‚Äì15, 1977== Daud Khan pays an official visit to the Soviet Union.

Daud Khan and most of his family are killed. Daud dies in Kabul together with the country's Vice-President, leading ministers, and the commander of the armed forces, all of whom reportedly tried to resist the takeover. The fighting continues into the following day. On April 30 a Revolutionary Council headed by Taraki assumes control of the government. Amin becomes Foreign Minister. The country is renamed the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. Although Taraki professes a non-aligned policy, there are signs that he is leaning heavily on the Soviet Union for economic aid and advice. ==June 1978== Taraki attempts to purge the ruling PDPA of prominent leaders of the Parcham wing of the party. Some are sent abroad as ambassadors, including Deputy Prime Minister Babrak Karmal, who is appointed ambassador to Czechoslovakia. ==July 1978== Taraki's reform program - which threatened to undermine basic Afghan cultural patterns - and political repression having antagonized large segments of the population, the first major uprising occurs in Nurestan. Other revolts, largely uncoordinated, spread throughout all of Afghanistan's provinces, and periodic explosions rock Kabul and other major cities. ==August 17, 1978== It is announced that the Defense Minister, Gen. Abdul Qadir, one of the coup leaders, has been arrested after the discovery of an alleged plot to overthrow the government. Qadir also belonged to the Parcham faction. ==December 5, 1978== After two days of talks in Moscow, Taraki and Brezhnev sign a treaty called the Soviet-Afghan Friendship treaty, which commits their countries to a 20-year treaty of friendship and cooperation. Among other things, both nations pledge to continue \\"to develop cooperation in the military field on the basis of appropriate agreements.\\" Article 4 of the treaty justified Soviet intervention in the case of outside armed invasion, and this article was used by Soviets in 1979 to justify their invasion of the country. Taraki says Afghanistan will remain officially non-aligned. However, most political observers believe that Taraki's favourable view of Marxism signifies much more than a mere continuation of Afghanistan's traditional economic ties with its powerful Soviet neighbour to the north.

ESPN Brasil was the first country-specific version of ESPN outside the United States, launched in June 1995. The channel has covered major sporting events, like the 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2016 Summer Olympics; the 1998, 2006, 2010 and 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 1999, 2003 and 2007 Pan-American Games. High ratings and prestige in the segment have been marks of the channel; it also won the APCA award twice, in 1995 for \\"Best Sports Programming\\" and in 1998 for \\"Best Coverage of the 1998 FIFA World Cup\\". Despite having a team that's regarded as one of the best in Brazilian sports broadcasting and important broadcasting rights for international competitions like La Liga, Premier League and the Bundesliga, major local series rights have historically not been present; the Campeonato Brasileiro, Copa do Brasil and the states' championships are held by local Grupo Globo and SporTV. ESPN, however, has purchased the rights to broadcast the 2009, 2010 and 2011 editions of the Copa do Brasil for TV and Campeonato Paulista, Copa Libertadores de Am√©rica, Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie A and Copa Sudamericana for radio. In May of 2020 CADE (Conselho Deliberativo da Economia) approves ESPN Brasil/Fox Sports Brasil fusion after failing to sell Fox Sports Brasil for other group. In September of 2020, as part of the unification, the group started to use the slogan \\"ESPN e Fox Sports Juntos na Torcida\\" (ESPN and Fox Sports Together in the match) on two channel's to standardize transmissions and not cause any discomfort to the public in the retransmissions of the events on two brother's channel's. Brasil made a partnership with R√°dio Eldorado to broadcast sports on radio. The new R√°dio Eldorado ESPN used Eldorado's radio assets and the team of commentators from ESPN Brasil. It was renamed R√°dio Estad√£o ESPN in 2007 due to a partnership agreement with the O Estado de S. Paulo newspaper.Estad√£o, Quem Somos, In 2005 the company incorporated ESPN International coverage, starting to broadcast in two channels. Before this date, programs such as the SportsCenter International Edition, MLB and the NFL were transmitted directly from Bristol, Connecticut, with Portuguese audio from Andre Adler, Marco Alfaro, Sergio Cesario, Roby Porto, Jos√© In√°cio Werneck, and Roberto Figueroa. Since 2005, shows and games are recorded and broadcast from its studios in S√£o Paulo, though morning schedules continue to include USA and Latin American programs. Prior to May 2011, programs produced by ESPN Brasil generally did not use in-game score graphics, though international programs had them. Beginning that month, ESPN Brasil began using the same score and other graphics used by the US channel. In March, the ESPN'S network in Brazil started with the broadcast 100% in HD with sports events and original programs. This is the same practice of ESPN in USA. The four channels of ESPN in Brazil is broadcast fully in HD. In October 2013, ESPN launched a second screen app, ESPN Sync, to connect to broadcasts of football matches.http://www.techvibes.com/blog/mobovivo-and-espn-sync-soccer-to-the- second-screen-2013-11-14 == ESPN channels in Brazil == Four separate channels of ESPN exist in Brazil: * ESPN Brasil, the main channel, more football orientated with live debate, news, interviews and major international football games. * ESPN, focused in US-based competitions (NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL), tennis and international football.

Retrieved date 2017-03-07 especially when movement is paired with the breath. ==Description== The vinyasa forms of yoga used as exercise, including Pattabhi Jois's 1948 Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga and its spin-off schools such as Beryl Bender Birch's 1995 Power Yoga and others like Baptiste Yoga, Jivamukti Yoga, Vinyasa Flow Yoga, Power Vinyasa Yoga, and Core Strength Vinyasa Yoga, derive from Krishnamacharya's development of a flowing aerobic style of yoga in the Mysore Palace in the early 20th century. ===Krishnamacharya's usage=== According to Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga's official history, Krishnamacharya learned the complete system of asanas (postures) and vinyasas (transitions) from an otherwise unknown document, the Yoga Kurunta, supposedly written 5,000 years ago by Vamana Rishi; the history tells that Krishnamacharya copied it out and taught it, unmodified, to Pattabhi Jois. However, the original manuscript was supposedly destroyed by ants, and no copy survives; neither Jois nor any other of Krishnamacharya's pupils transcribed it, as would have been expected in a traditional guru-shishya relationship. Further, Krishnamacharya \\"surprising[ly]\\" did not cite the text in his 1935 Yoga Makaranda or his c. 1941 Yogasanagalu. The Yogasanagalu did contain tables of asanas and vinyasas, and these are \\"comparable\\" to Jois's system, but far from being fixed as written in an ancient manuscript, Krishnamacharya's \\"jumping\\" yoga style at the Mysore palace was constantly changing, adapted to the needs of specific pupils according to their ages, constitutions (deha), vocations (vrttibheda), capabilities (sakti), and paths (marga); the approach was \\"experimental\\". In contrast, the system that Krishnamacharya taught to Jois and that became the basis of Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga was fixed. This may have been because Jois had to teach at the Sanskrit Pathasala in 1933, while Krishnamacharya's other pupils were studying at his Yogasala, so he may, Mark Singleton suggests, have taught the 18-year-old Jois a simple fixed sequence suitable for a novice teacher to use with large groups of boys. Norman Sjoman notes that Krishnamacharya cited the 19th century Sritattvanidhi which documents asanas used in the Mysore palace in his early writings; his early vinyasas developed into forms more like those of Jois, something that Sjoman takes as evidence that Krishnamacharya created rather than inherited the vinyasas: \\"It was not an inherited format\\". Krishnamacharya used \\"vinyasa\\" in at least two different ways. One was in a broad sense to mean \\"an appropriately formulated sequence of steps (krama) for approaching a given posture\\". The other was a \\"stage in the execution of an asana\\". For example, Sarvangasana is introduced with the words \\"This has 12 vinyasas [stages]. The 8th vinyasa is the asana sthiti [the actual pose].\\" ===Pattabhi Jois's usage=== In contrast, Pattabhi Jois used \\"vinyasa\\" in a narrower sense to mean \\"the repetitious linking movements\\" between the asanas of Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga. The Ashtanga yoga teacher Gregor Maehle explains that this flowing style \\"creates a movement meditation\\". The vinyasa sequences used in the touring demonstrations of Krishnamacharya's yoga were, according to an interview with Jois, \\"virtually identical to the aerobic schema\\" of modern Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga, namely \\"several distinct 'series' within which each main asana is conjoined by a short, repeated, linking series of postures and jumps based on the Surya Namaskar model\\". ===Sharath Jois's usage=== Modern vinyasa yoga such as is taught by Sharath Jois (grandson of Pattabhi Jois) coordinates the breath with the vinyasa transition movements between asanas. A particular sequence of asanas, also called a vinyasa, is used repeatedly in Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga classes; it involves Chaturanga Dandasana (Low Staff Pose), Urdhva Mukha Svanasana (Upward Dog Pose) and Adho Mukha Svanasana (Downward Dog Pose) to link other asanas. Sharath Jois defines vinyasa as a system of breathing and movement. ==See also== * Trul khor ==References== ==Sources== * * * ==External links== * ","title":"VinyƒÅsa"},{"id":"11659678","text":"your bitcoinThe following lists events that happened during 1979 in Afghanistan. ==Incumbents== * President: ** until 14 September: Nur Muhammad Taraki ** 14 September-27 December: Hafizullah Amin ** starting 27 December: Babrak Karmal * Chairman of the Council of Ministers: ** until 27 March: Nur Muhammad Taraki ** 27 March-27 December: Hafizullah Amin ** starting 27 December: Babrak Karmal ==10-20 March 1979== A mutiny in the Herat garrison by Afghan army officers is crushed. ==27 March 1979== In a cabinet reshuffle, Taraki inducts Foreign Minister Amin as prime minister and himself takes over chairmanship of the Supreme Defense Council. ==Early September 1979== A rebel force is routed near Kabul in a major battle, and later an offensive is mounted to destroy guerrillas in districts bordering Pakistan. Taraki leaves for Havana, Cuba, to represent Afghanistan at the sixth summit conference of nonaligned nations, leaving the government in the hands of Amin. Returning via Moscow, Taraki is advised by Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev to get rid of Amin, whose anti- Islamic policy is considered dangerous. Taraki, however, fails in this as Amin is tipped off about the plot and manages to turn the tide of events to his own favour. ==16 September 1979== Taraki is overthrown in a coup, and Amin becomes president of the Revolutionary Council, which is nominally in charge of running the government, together with the Central Committee of the Khalq party and the Council of Ministers. Contradictory reports suggest that Taraki is killed during the takeover, although his death is only announced on 9 October and stated to be the result of \\"a severe and prolonged illness.\\" On 17 September Amin announces that his rule marks the beginning of a \\"better Socialist order.\\" ==19 September 1979== A general amnesty is declared in an ineffective effort to placate the Muslims. This is followed by an administrative purge and a further attempt at reconciliation with Islam. Radio Kabul accuses Pakistan and Iran of sending armed infiltrators to undermine the government. Pakistan is also charged with arming the Afghan refugees and tribal rebels in the border areas with the help of Saudi Arabia, China, and the U.S. Afghan refugees in Pakistan are at one time estimated to number 140,000. ==27 December 1979== Amin is overthrown and killed in a coup backed by Soviet troops. Viktor Karpukhin carries out the taking of the presidential palace, in which two Soviet soldiers are killed. Ex-deputy prime minister Karmal, who has been in exile in Czechoslovakia, is picked as Amin's successor. The Soviets have begun a massive military airlift into Kabul, and at least two motorized divisions have crossed the Soviet-Afghan border. Babrak Karmal, whose Parcham party spearheaded the coup against Daud but later lost power to the faction led by Taraki and Amin, is considered more pro-Soviet than Amin had been. In one of his first speeches, he denounces Amin as an agent of U.S. imperialism. At year's end reports from Kabul indicate that some 40,000 Soviet troops are fanning out through the country in an apparent attempt to crush the Muslim rebels. On 31 December U.S. Pres. Jimmy Carter declares it is imperative that world leaders immediately make it clear to the Soviet Union that its actions will have \\"severe political consequences.\\" Afghanistan Category:Years of the 20th century in Afghanistan Afghanistan ","title":"1979 in Afghanistan"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},R={class:"card-container"};function I(s,e,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your bitcoinü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",R,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),b(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const H=d(P,[["render",I]]),F=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/53.md","filePath":"drive/53.md"}'),D={name:"drive/53.md"},W=Object.assign(D,{setup(s){return(e,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{F as __pageData,W as default};
