The bill applies to containers made of aluminum/bimetal, glass or any plastic, containing soft drinks, beer/malt beverages, carbonated or non-carbonated waters, plain or flavored waters, energy drinks, juices, iced teas or iced coffees. Milk/dairy, nutritional drinks and wine and spirits are not included in the program. The chief goals of the measure, recently rebranded TennCan, are to reduce litter, increase recycling, create green jobs, support sustainable manufacturing and generate funding, training and other benefits for social-service agencies, community causes and other nonprofit entities in Tennessee. Proposed legislation The proposed legislation has undergone numerous revisions since it was first introduced by two Republican legislators in 2003. Need RECYCLING: Tennessee consumes more than 5 billion beverage containers a year, according to the Container Recycling Institute, but recycles no more than 10 percent of them, according to the state's solid waste management agency. The proposed deposit-return legislation is projected to increase the recycling rate to approximately 80 percent, based on data in states with similar programs, while providing reliable quantities of high-quality recycled feedstock for manufacturers in Tennessee and the Southeast, especially those producing beverage cans, carpet, glass bottles and fiberglass. LITTER: Tennessee spends an estimated $11 million a year on litter abatement. Its principal agency for litter collection is the \\"county litter grants\\" program within the department of transportation (TDOT). Since 1982, the program has used a \\"litter tax\\" on beverages to fund regular cleanups by work-release inmates from the county jails (the tax also funds Keep Tennessee Beautiful, the state affiliate of Keep America Beautiful.) From FY 2003‚Äì2004 to FY 2015‚Äì2016, litter grant collections averaged 23.5 million pounds a year, with a high of 28.7 million pounds in FY 2003-2004 and a low of 17.4 million pounds in FY 2005‚Äì2006. Removing those high and the low years, the average is just slightly higher, 23.7 million pounds, or an average 3.73 pounds per capita. These data do not include litter collections along interstate and federal highways performed by TDOT contractors, nor do they include cleanups performed by volunteers, Keep Tennessee Beautiful affiliates, neighborhood groups, the annual Great American Cleanup or other groups or events. In order to put these numbers in context, the Tennessee Bottle Bill Project in 2006 sought to compare Tennessee's litter collections with those in Maine, which charges a 5-cent deposit on most beverages (15 cents on wine and spirits). Extrapolating from data provided by Maine's department of transportation (the only entity in the state that picks up litter on a regular basis), the Tennessee Bottle Bill Project determined that Maine's per-capita litter in 2006 was approximately one-quarter of a pound. Moreover, according to informal assessments in 2006 by Maine DOT personnel, roughly 10-20 percent of Maine's litter consists of beverage containers. In contrast, the Tennessee Bottle Bill Project estimates that 50 percent or more of Tennessee's litter, by volume, is beverage containers. This estimate is based on estimates by numerous groups involved with litter cleanups in Tennessee, including county sheriffs, county litter-grant deputies, environmental organizations, watershed protection groups and others; as well as on the results of an informal source-separated survey conducted in November 2006 by the Tennessee Bottle Bill Project, using volunteers across the state, including several jail crews. That survey found that of 645.5 13-gallon garbage bags filled as full as possible, 325.5 contained bottles and cans only, or 50.42 percent. How the proposed bill would work Under the proposed legislation, the state's environmental agency will have ultimate responsibility for the program, with the department of revenue providing accounting functions as well as management of the \\"deposit beverage container fund.\\" The fund is the account into which all initial deposits and other revenues are placed, and from which all program expenses are paid, including reimbursements and allowances. Any reserves in the fund, including unclaimed deposits, belong to the program, may not revert to the state's general fund and may be used only for purposes authorized by the legislation. The 5-cent deposit is initiated by the beverage distributor and is collected by the department of revenue at the start of the cycle. The distributor recovers his deposit when he sells the product to a retailer; the retailer recovers his deposit when he sells the product to a customer; the customer recovers his deposit when he takes the empty container to a certified redemption center; the redemption center owner recovers his deposit when he sells the cancelled container to a certified processor; and the certified processor recovers his deposit when he invoices the bottle bill program for reimbursement. Certified redemption centers are the heart of the program. They are independent businesses (storefront, portable, mobile, reverse vending machine or satellite kiosks) that have been authorized by the program to accept qualifying containers from the public, determine the quantity, issue the refunds, sort the containers by material and/or color (not by brand or bottler), and sell the sorted (and in some cases compacted) containers to a certified processor. The certified processor (typically a scrap yard, materials recovery facility, curbside recycling provider or dedicated collection and recycling service) then bales, shreds or otherwise adds value to the sorted containers before selling them to manufacturers or other processors. In addition to paying market prices for the containers, the certified processor pays the redemption center the refund value of 5 cents plus an \\"overhead allowance\\" equal to 1 cent (maximum) per container. The processor then invoices the bottle bill program for the sum of these two amounts, as well as \\"administrative allowance\\" of one-tenth of a cent per container to defray his costs for associated paperwork and record-keeping. Some redemption centers may be authorized as \\"depots,\\" expanded facilities where the public may drop off non- deposit glass (such as wine bottles and food jars) as well as other recyclables, for instance, electronics. Redemption centers may be owned by any entity meeting certification requirements, including individuals, retailers and other businesses, local government entities, including county solid waste convenience centers and not-for-profit organizations. The current version of the legislation (introduced in 2018) requires that every redemption center either be owned or operated by a nonprofit entity such as an agency serving the homeless or the handicapped, or it must maintain an ongoing \\"beneficial relationship\\" with at least one such entity in the area, such as a school, library, animal shelter or Little League team. \\"Beneficial relationship\\" will be defined by the program but may include hosting bottle drives or donation bins for the nonprofit.  Potential issues  One aspect of beverage recycling laws that has come into question is illegal redemption from outside states. Michigan, which offers 10 cents for every can and bottle recycled, has faced issues of fraudulent returns from neighboring states. None of Tennessee's neighbor states currently has beverage deposit laws.

The most senior match official is the referee. They may be assisted by a range of other officials depending on the level and rules of the competition. Equipment The match officials may use the following equipment: ;Coin :The referee organises a coin toss with the team captains,prior to the game commencing. To decide who kicks off and what end each team takes initially. ;Whistle :Referees must carry a whistle to stop play and then signal to players about many decisions during a game.RLIF, 2004: 43 A referee will let players know when they can take a kick-off or optional kick by using his whistle, for example, as well as to stop after foul play or while awarding a try at other times in a game. ;Red card :A red card is used to signal that a player is being sent from the field, or \\"sent off\\", for the rest of a match by the referee holding it aloft in the direction of that player. In some competitions a red card is not used and a player is simply pointed to the touch line by the referee. A referee sends a player to the \\"sin bin\\" for ten minutes. Spread fingers are used as the signal instead of a yellow card. ;Yellow card :A yellow card is used to signal that a player is being temporarily suspended from the game. The player is sent to the \\"sin bin\\" for 10 minutes, after which time they are allowed to return to carry on playing.RLIF, 2004: 42 In some competitions a yellow card is not used, instead the referee, while facing the player being disciplined, will hold out both hands with fingers and thumbs spread to represent 10 minutes. ;Flag :The two touch judges each carry a flag which is used to signal certain things to both the referee and players.RLIF, 2004: 44 If the ball or the player in possession of it goes into touch the touch judge will raise their flag into the air. Touch judges hold their flags in front of them perpendicular to the touch line so that defenders know how far to retreat to be onside in situations when the referee is unable to because of other responsibilities, for example at a scrum. The flags are also waved to draw the referee's attention to incidents and are raised behind the goal posts to signal that a penalty goal or conversion attempt has been successful, or waved at waist-height to indicate an unsuccessful kick. In international and professional matches, touch judge use flags that are electronically hooked up to a receiver worn by the main referee, similar to those used in high-level soccer. By pushing a button on the flag handle, the receiver vibrates or beeps, thus drawing the referee's attention. ;Microphone and earpiece :The referee, touch judges and video referee can remain in constant contact by using microphones and earpieces. The referee's microphone is broadcast as part of media match presentations. Uniform Match officials on the playing field including the referee, touch judges and in-goal judges all wear an official uniform of a colour distinguishable from those being worn by the two sides playing each other. These uniforms have no special markings to signify the official capacity of the wearer, instead this can be identified by the positioning and equipment of the official. Refereeing systems Different refereeing systems are in use: ;Laws of the Game :A referee and two touch judges are mandated for games.RLIF, 2004: 41 A timekeeper is an optional official. ;International competition :A referee, two touch judges, video referee and timekeeper. ;Professional leagues :National Rugby League, Australasia: Two referees, two touch judges, video referee, timekeeper. :Super League, Europe: A referee, two touch judges, video referee, reserve referee/official(s), timekeeper, match commissioner, interchange official. In-goal judges are used if the video referee is not being used for a match. Positions and responsibilities=Referee Referees must be well-sighted. Here a referee watches an attempt to score. Unsighted referees might consult with the video referee if needed. The players of each team should be made available for kit inspection.RFL, 2009: B2:11, p15 The referee inspects the playing kit of the two teams to ensure it is within the rules, safety is the main concern. The boots worn by players can be of particular interest so as to make sure that there are no sharp edges. The strapping worn by some players has also been scrutinised. The referee organises a coin toss with the captains of the two teams playing to decide which team kicks off and which end they play at from kick-off. Referees may take disciplinary action from the moment they enter the playing field until the moment they leave it after they have blown their whistle to signal full- time.Hickey, 2006: 6 The referee may blow for half time and full-time when those periods have elapsed, or after hearing the hooter if responsibility has been delegated. Potential top level referees must first pass refereeing exams set by a governing body, such as the Rugby Football League in the United Kingdom, before officiating at progressively more senior levels of the sport, gaining experience in amateur competitions and then moving onto the professional leagues where they will progress to the top if good enough. Referees need to be \\"very fit\\", with physical training being a requirement at a professional level of competition. Good communication skills, an ability to \\"handle top athletes with respect and authority\\" and being able to operate under pressure and scrutiny have been cited as by Stuart Cummings, a former referee, as skills needed to control a game. Full-time referees have been used in the Super League professional competition since 2007. =Referee's signals= The referee having made a decision should indicate that decision by using a signal.RLIF, 2004: 46 Touch judge Touch judges watch play from each touchline Two touch judges are used in a rugby league game.Hickey, 2006: 7 They move along each touch line following play. Their main function is to judge when the ball or a player carrying the ball has gone into touch. They also stand together behind the goal posts to judge whether conversions or penalty kicks at goal have been successful. =Touch judges' signals= The touch judges cannot stop play but can signal the referee to enable them to assist the referee.RLIF, 2004: 49 Video referee The screen is used to signal the video referee's decisions. Unlike other sports, the video screen in the venue makes the announcement, not the referee. The video referee may be called upon by the referee to examine the play in possible tries. In the Super League competition they can examine play from the preceding play-the-ball. A video referee may also be asked to check whether an attempted 40-20 kick has been successful and sometimes called upon by the referee if there is a stoppage to check events before making a decision. Once a decision has been made by the on field referee, the video referee may not overrule it. The video referee was first seen in Australia at the 1996 Super League World Nines. The use of the video referee has led to new rule interpretations. In Northern Hemisphere competitions, the video referee is stationed at the ground itself, usually in either the TV production truck or a special booth inside the stadium, while in the NRL a group of video referees make decisions on all matches from \\"The Bunker\\", a specially-constructed facility near league headquarters in Sydney modeled after similar instant-replay rooms used by American sports leagues like MLB or the NHL. In-goal judge In-goal judges may be used if no video referee system is present at a match to assist the referee in his decision making. Timekeeper The referee shall keep the time during a game unless this responsibility is delegated to an appointed official. Delegation of responsibility is usually decided by the rules of a competition, it is standard practice for professional competitions to use an appointed official in place of the referee. The British Rugby Football League's Operational Rules, for example, require the home team to provide a timekeeper for first team games with the away team being entitled to bring their own to sit alongside their opponent's representative.RFL, 2009: B2:8, p14 The timekeepers signal half time and full-time as well as extra time periods if they are played.RLIF, 2004: 17 When time has expired the timekeepers sound the hooter, at this signal the referee will blow his whistle to end play at an existing stoppage or wait for the next one to occur.RLIF, 2004: 16 A referee can signal by raising both arms to a timekeeper to take account of stoppage time and to stop their watch until signalled again by waving one arm above their head to carry on timing. A timekeeper may be used to assist the referee in timing the temporary suspension (sin bin) of a player. Match Commissioner The Match Commissioner is responsible for the whole game. They ensure the game kicks off on time and any incidents that may arise are brought to the attention of the Rugby Football League. This is an essential role as it allows the game to run consistently without any interruptions Interchange Official The Interchange Official ensures that the interchange process is carried out smoothly and legally. No interchange can take place without the Interchange Official present. Usually, the Interchange Official will be responsible for the home team's interchange and the Reserve Referee/Official will be responsible for the away team's interchange.

Plot Three sisters Shamoli, Kanchan and Kakoon arrive in Mumbai from their village in search of livelihood. At first, they have to face terrible hardship in the new city. But soon they find help from Veeru, the chauffeur and protege of a powerful and wealthy lawyer named Kunal Mehra, who has never faced defeat in a single case. Veeru gets jobs for Kanchan and Shamoli as maids in Kunal's home. Shamoli impresses Kunal with her presence of mind, and once saves him from a very difficult situation. The middle-aged Kunal, a confirmed bachelor for years, though at first avoids Shamoli because of her status, later feels attracted and proposes to her, leaving Shamoli in confusion. He does not know that she and Veeru love each other. Unknown to them all, Kanchan also silently loves Veeru. Kakoon, the little sister, has a major accident and needs expensive treatment at once. Veeru tries his best to help and even takes loans, but that is still insufficient. Kunal has meanwhile given Shamoli a proposal to either marry him or leave. Being rich, only Kunal is in a position to help, so Shamoli having no other alternative quickly decides to accept his proposal and marry him. This angers Veeru and Kanchan, who believe Shamoli has lost her head over Kunal's wealth. Rejected by her loved ones, Shamoli struggles to be accepted in her husband's elite social circle, where she is often tormented and humiliated by Karishma, the wife of Kunal's brother. She gradually falls in love with Kunal. Shamoli's resolve is tested further when Veeru comes to live in Kunal's house, following a surprise revelation that the two men are long- lost brothers. Then, Kunal learns the truth that Shamoli had married him only to save her little sister's life and that she used to love Veeru. He becomes upset and in anger, drives both Shamoli and Veeru out of his house. But he later feels regret and decides to set her free from their marriage, send her back to Veeru and leave the city. However, Shamoli realizes that she now loves Kunal and not Veeru, so she chooses to stay with her husband. Kanchan and Shamoli reconcile with each other. Veeru accepts the fact that Shamoli is now Kunal's wife and despite Kunal's insistence to stay with them, decides to stay away from them until he achieves his dream of becoming a lawyer. In the end, Veeru accomplishes his goal and marries Kanchan, giving recognition to her love for Veeru. He then pays a visit to his brother's house, and the show ends in a happy note with both the brothers and the sisters united.

It is a Greek Revival house built in the 1830s by a local hotelier. Later it was home to Hiram Charles Todd, a descendant of one of the original owners who was active in New York state politics. The house remains intact today with almost no alterations. In 1972 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the very first listing in Saratoga Springs. Later that year it became a contributing property to the Franklin Square Historic District. Two decades later that district became part of the new West Side Historic District. It is currently used as office space for several local businesses. Building The house is located on the corner of Franklin Street just south of the square. The neighborhood is residential, with large trees lining the streets. The other houses are similar in size to the Todd House, either in Greek Revival as well or other Victorian styles. An iron fence runs along the north and east edges of the property; there is a parking lot in the rear. It is two stories high, with a square three-by-three-bay central block and seven- bay T-shaped rear wing. The siding is clapboard over wood frame with diagonal brick braces. A wide entablature goes down to the middle of the second story windows; fretwork flanks the three on the east (front) facade. The main entrance is flanked by projecting bay windows. The mostly flat roof is pierced by six chimneys. On that elevation, a full-height pedimented portico with four Doric fluted columns shelters the main entrance. It is one of five porches on the building. Two on the north side, facing Division Street, have colonnades echoing that on the front. On the west (rear), the only portion of the building with a gabled roof, there is a small upstairs porch and larger enclosed one downstairs. Inside, the central hall has a double staircase that converges into a curved single one. The drawing room runs the length of the south side of the house on the first story. It is divided with a semi- elliptical arch. On the west end of the living room two French doors lead into the music room. History The house was built by Thomas Marvin, a nephew of the founder of the United States Hotel, one of Saratoga Springs' early resorts. The exact date is unknown, but it was likely built in 1837, around the time of his marriage. Marvin at the time was co-owner of the hotel along with his brother, and the house faced the rear of the hotel across the square, originally called Marvin Square after the family. The front bay windows were added shortly after it was built. During the house's construction, in 1833, Marvin heard of the proposed rail link that would connect the village with existing tracks at Ballston Spa. He sold a piece of land to the railroad so that the trains could run past the house and the hotel. The house thus became a landmark of Saratoga Springs to visitors.

Software components with no available source code are called binary blobs and, as such, are mostly used for proprietary firmware images in the Linux kernel. While generally redistributable, binary blobs do not give the user the freedom to audit, modify or, consequently, redistribute their modified versions.  History  The Linux kernel started to include binary blobs in 1996.Take your freedom back, with Linux-2.6.33-libre FSFLA, 2010. The work to clear out the binary blobs began in 2006 with gNewSense's find- firmware and gen-kernel. This work was taken further by the BLAG Linux distribution in 2007 when deblob and Linux-libre was born.Alexandre Oliva: Linux-libre and the prisoners‚Äô dilemma FSFLA, 2009.jebba: BLAG :: View topic - Linux Libre BLAG forums, 2008. Linux-libre was first released by the Free Software Foundation Latin America (FSFLA), then endorsed by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) as a valuable component for the totally free Linux distributions. It became a GNU package in March 2012. Alexandre Oliva is the project maintainer.  Proprietary firmware removal  The GNU logo with Freedo, Linux-libre's mascot  Methods  The removal process is achieved by using a script called deblob-main. This script is inspired by the one used for gNewSense. Jeff Moe made subsequent modifications to meet certain requirements for its use with the BLAG Linux and GNU distribution. There is another script called deblob-check, which is used to check if a kernel source file, a patch or a compressed sources file still contains software which is suspected of being proprietary. Benefits Aside from the primary intended effect of running a system with only free software, the practical consequences of removing device firmware that a user is not allowed to study or modify has both positive and negative effects. Removal of device firmware can be considered an advantage for security and stability, when the firmware cannot be audited for bugs, for security problems, and for malicious operations such as backdoors, or when the firmware cannot be fixed by the Linux kernel maintainers themselves, even if they know of problems. It is possible for the entire system to be compromised by a malicious firmware, and without the ability to perform a security audit on manufacturer-provided firmware, even an innocent bug could undermine the safety of the running system. Side effects The downside of removing proprietary firmware from the kernel is that it will cause loss of functionality of certain hardware that does not have a free software replacement available. This affects certain sound, video, TV tuner, and network (especially wireless) cards, as well as some other devices. When possible, free software replacement firmware is provided as a substitute, such as the openfwwf for b43, carl9170 and ath9k_htc wireless card drivers.  Availability  The source code and precompiled packages of the deblobbed Linux kernel are available directly from the distributions which use the Linux-libre scripts. Freed-ora is a subproject which prepares and maintains RPM packages based on Fedora. There are also precompiled packages for Debian and derived distributions such as Ubuntu.

In 2005 the sisters were determined to not let their mother‚Äôs disability, a broken hip requiring her to use a wheelchair, call off the annual trip. In 2006 after being urged by family and friends to publish their southern style recipes into a book, the seven sisters chipped in $157 each to pay for the publication costs. In May 2006 the ‚ÄúSisters Family Cookbook‚Äù was published. To begin with the sisters ordered 300 copies. Much to their surprise the cookbooks ‚Äúsold like hotcakes‚Äù and since then more than 6,000 copies of the first book have been sold. ‚ÄúThe first copies contained recipes from each sister, with a healthy dose of humorous trips and quotes, famous wise sayings, helpful kitchen pointers and heartwarming stories and poems all crowded together in a three-ring binders with a picture of the sisters on the front.‚Äù Shirley Williamson, one of the sisters, found out in September 2006 that she needed a kidney transplant and had to go on dialysis. Shirley was told that the transplant would cost $10,000 and that did not include the medicine after the surgery.http://lagrange.uber.matchbin.com/printer_friendly/722846 Following this, all proceeds from the books went towards to the medical expenses of Shirley‚Äôs kidney transplant. In January 2008 Lena Drake, great niece of Shirley Williamson, was told she was a positive match and a month later she was cleared to donate one of her kidneys. In March 2008 the operation took place. Later on in the year the sisters compiled another book, ‚ÄúSisters Family Cookbook Second Helping,‚Äù with almost twice the number of recipes. The sisters dedicated the book to Lena Drake. More than 1,000 copies of the second book have been sold. ‚ÄúSomething Special‚Äù In the back of the ‚ÄúSisters Family Cookbook: Second Helping‚Äù is a section called ‚ÄúSomething Special‚Äù. This section was written by Willie Todd, one of the sisters, and has a short story about each one of the sisters and their childhood memories.

She appeared in the series from 5 October 2009 until 13 September 2011. Actress Helen Russell-Clark ‚Äì who went on to play Jem Costello ‚Äì originally auditioned for the role, but the part was awarded to Barlow. Producer Lucy Allan said Barlow was her favourite addition to the cast during 2009. Initially portrayed as an imaginary character in a schizophrenia storyline, Rae was later revealed to be real when she arrived to study in Hollyoaks. She was central to a controversial suicide storyline, and was part of a love triangle with Ste Hay (Kieron Richardson) and Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan), which left her pregnant by Ste. She miscarried during an argument with Brendan and subsequently feuded with him; Barlow praised her character for being one of the few who dared to oppose the Hollyoaks villain. Rae was originally characterised as a chav with a feisty persona, but underwent a transformation when she attempted to embrace domestic life with Ste. During series four of the post-watershed spin-off Hollyoaks Later, Rae was murdered by a serial killer, Silas Blissett (Jeff Rawle). The late broadcast slot allowed an explicit depiction of her death. Barlow hoped that Rae would be remembered for her strong-willed nature, and that her exit would be considered one of the best in the programme's history. In 2011, Barlow won an All About Soap award for Rae's love-triangle storyline. AfterElton criticised the lack of character development Rae received, and along with the Sunday Mercury, bemoaned the dearth of realism exhibited in Rae staying with Ste despite knowing that he was homosexual. Readers of the soap opera magazine Inside Soap indicated that they did not want Silas to murder Rae. Creation and casting At a July 2009 Hollyoaks press day, series producer Lucy Allan announced that there would be a \\"big stunt\\" involving schizophrenic character Barry \\"Newt\\" Newton (Nico Mirallegro) in October of that year. It was later revealed that a new character, Rae, would join the serial as part of a \\"shock suicide plot\\" involving Newt, in which the two characters would jump off a bridge. Alice Barlow's casting as Rae was announced in October 2009. Barlow stated that she was \\"absolutely on top of the world\\" to receive the part, particularly as one of her childhood dreams was to appear in a soap opera. Helen Russell-Clark ‚Äì who went on to play Jem Costello in the serial ‚Äì also auditioned for Rae, and reached the final stages of casting. Allan said Rae was one of her favourite additions to the cast in 2009 and expressed her pride in Barlow's performance, saying, \\"to introduce a character as somebody and then to completely change the character six weeks later, while still delivering the performances that Alice does, is a testament to a young actress.\\" In early 2011, Barlow decided to leave Hollyoaks to pursue other projects. Her departure was kept secret until her exit scenes were aired. Barlow described her time with the programme as \\"the perfect end\\" to her teenage years and said she could not \\"have asked for anything better.\\" Development=Characterisation During her first appearances as a figment of Newt's imagination, Rae was depicted as a goth with an emo persona. When she was reintroduced as a real person, Rae's character was more reminiscent to that of a chav. The character later underwent a transitional period; she retained her strong personality, but displayed a weaker side resulting from the setbacks she encountered. Barlow found the role challenging, as her own personality is dissimilar from her character's. She described Rae as someone who always makes her opinion known, and hoped she would be remembered for her strong-willed persona. Suicide pact Rae's appearance during Newt's hallucinations (2009) Rae was introduced as Newt's imaginary friend. They made a suicide pact, and jumped off a bridge together into deep water. The stunt was filmed at Stanley Dock in Liverpool, where a tower was erected for them to jump from. Although stunt doubles were available, both Barlow and Mirallegro decided to perform their own stunts, and spent around four minutes filming underwater. The storyline received prominent coverage in the media days before the scenes were due to be broadcast because two young girls in Scotland had died in a similar suicide pact, having jumped from the Erskine Bridge into the River Clyde. Channel 4 decided to broadcast the Hollyoaks scenes as planned, and released a statement which explained: > We feel it is appropriate to continue with the transmission of these > episodes as this is not a one-off programme but an established and long- > running series. The audience will be familiar with the character of Newt and > this plotline, which has been both trailed and promoted, has been developing > over a number of weeks. Hollyoaks has a strong track record of dealing with > sensitive issues, and the transmission will be followed by a programme > support announcement directing viewers to a 24-hour helpline. The care home in which the two deceased girls had been housed criticised the decision, and deemed the broadcast \\"likely to cause further distress.\\" Allan said the underwater sequence following the bridge jump was her favourite scene of 2009. She said, \\"It was a beautiful moment on screen and it was the moment that the audience realised that Newt was trying to kill himself. For me, that moment of realisation made that scene so powerful.\\" Once the suicide storyline had concluded, it was revealed that Rae was a real character in the series. RelationshipsSte Hay and Brendan Brady= Following Newt's departure from the series, Rae began dating Ste Hay (Kieron Richardson). A love triangle formed between Rae, Ste and Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan), who wanted Ste for himself. Scanlan said that Brendan's actions ‚Äì paying Veronica (Lynsey McLaren) to try and split Ste and Rae up, and giving Ste money to stay away from Rae ‚Äì demonstrated Brendan's willingness to use \\"power and manipulation\\". Unaware that Ste and Brendan had begun an affair, Rae discovered that she was pregnant. All About Soap magazine wrote that Rae was \\"knocked sideways\\" by the discovery, and noted her uncertainty at the prospect of becoming a teenage mother. Brendan and Ste decide to end their affair for Rae's sake, but soon resumed their relationship. Rae ultimately learnt of the affair; Richardson characterised her response as being \\"shocked and angry\\", and Barlow told Inside Soap magazine that the revelation left her character \\"more torn than ever.\\" The discovery prompted Rae to consider having an abortion, but Brendan convinced her not to, and revealed that he once lost his own child. Barlow called the scenes \\"really heartfelt stuff\\", and explained that Ste saw no problem with Rae having the baby, as he already had a son and considered himself a good father, whereas it was \\"a bigger deal\\" for Rae, who was childless. Discussing Rae and Ste's relationship, Barlow said that Rae truly loved Ste, and that they had a special connection formed through the hardships they had faced together. Despite this, Rae rebuffed Ste's attempt to rekindle their relationship. However, during an argument with Brendan, Rae suffered a miscarriage. Barlow found the filming of these scenes difficult. As the storyline concluded, Rae resolved to remain friends with Ste and support him through his difficult relationship with Brendan. This resulted in a feud between Brendan and herself. Barlow explained that Rae had \\"a handle\\" on him and was \\"one of the few characters [able to] stand up to Brendan.\\" She enjoyed portraying this dynamic, and assessed that Rae \\"always felt like she had the upper hand\\" as she knew the truth about Brendan's sexuality. =Ethan Scott= Rae was involved in a relationship storyline with Ethan Scott (Craig Vye), who was already romancing both Liberty Savage (Abi Phillips) and Theresa McQueen (Jorgie Porter). Viewers were initially unaware that Rae was seeing Ethan, but knew that he was cheating on Theresa and Liberty with an unknown third woman. Porter said Theresa, her character, was incredulous when she saw Ethan kissing Rae. Barlow was also surprised by the twist; she had not expected Rae to be involved. Once the three women discovered the truth about Ethan's infidelity, they decided that \\"the best revenge is humiliation\\", exposed Ethan's lies and poured gunge over him in front of the entire village. Vye described the storyline as a \\"classic case of wanting what you can't have\\". He explained that Ethan was not ready to settle down and would end up alone. The actors involved made an effort to give the storyline a comedic tone, to keep it from becoming too serious. Porter felt that it reflected real life, as there are men in society who behave as Ethan did. The storyline proved popular with viewers, and both Barlow and Porter received a high volume of messages through the social networking website Twitter from viewers expressing their surprise at Rae's involvement. Digital Spy showcased Rae being exposed as Ethan's lover and her subsequent revenge plot in its \\"Pic of the day\\" feature. Departure and death Jeff Rawle (pictured) plays Rae's murderer, Silas Blissett. Barlow decided to leave Hollyoaks in early 2011, as she felt she had given all she could to the role. This prompted the producers to devise a memorable exit storyline for Rae. Barlow was informed of their plans in March 2011, but her exit, and details of the storyline, were concealed from viewers. Speculation arose that Rae would become the next victim of serial killer Silas Blissett (Jeff Rawle); Barlow tried to discredit these rumours, and denied that she was leaving Hollyoaks as she wanted viewers to be \\"surprised and shocked\\" by her exit. In August 2011, a leaked clip of Silas preparing to attack Theresa was posted on YouTube, which led viewers to believe that Theresa would become his next victim, which was confirmed in the fourth series of Hollyoaks Later. Porter said that it was \\"scary and worrying\\"; however, she would not confirm whether Silas killed her character. Emma Smithwick, the programme's producer, confirmed that the late night episodes would feature the death of a regular character. When the episodes aired, Silas was angered by Rae's attitude ‚Äì her desire to use men for casual flings ‚Äì and realised he could frame Brendan for her murder. He then beat Rae and strangled her to death in an alleyway. Barlow said that because Hollyoaks Later is broadcast late at night, there were no limits to the storyline, allowing the producers to \\"do whatever they wanted with it.\\" She described Rae's death scene as \\"absolutely incredible\\" and loved the chance to work with accredited actor Rawle. She explained that Rae's death had been kept secret in order to shock viewers in the same way the death of Sarah Barnes (Loui Batley) had previously done. Barlow said she was happy and grateful with the nature of her exit storyline, as the opportunity to \\"go out with a bang\\" was better than Rae leaving quietly in a taxi. She hoped that Rae's murder would \\"go down in Hollyoaks history\\" as one of the best exits. In the aftermath, Brendan was arrested for Rae's murder after Silas planted evidence on him. Barlow stated that other characters blamed Brendan because he had caused Rae to fear for her life, and that Ste believed he was culpable because \\"[a]fter all the ups and downs, Ste knows exactly what the relationship between Rae and Brendan has been like and all the problems they've had.\\" Storylines Rae meets Newt (Nico Mirallegro) while he is living rough, and teaches him how to survive on the streets. She is disliked by Eli (Marc Silcock), Newt's alternate persona caused by his schizophrenia. Rae and Newt become close and begin a relationship. After Newt admits he has schizophrenia, Eli takes over his mind and tries to kill Rae, but Newt manages to stop him. Newt and Rae decide to escape their problems by committing suicide together by jumping from a height into water. As they climb to the top of a warehouse to jump, Newt's ex- girlfriend Lauren Valentine (Dominique Jackson) and his foster father Jack Osborne (Jimmy McKenna) rush to stop Newt, who pushes Eli into the canal as Rae jumps. Newt jumps in after them, but is rescued by Jack. After recovering, Newt locates Rae's grandmother Lily (Meryl Hampton) and tells her that her granddaughter is dead. Rae, however, then arrives alive and well. She does not recognise Newt, and has a different hairstyle and clothing from her previous appearances. Newt realises that he had seen a photograph of Rae and had created an alternate persona around her. The woman he thought he had known was another figment of his imagination. To Rae's displeasure, her school is soon merged with Newt's. She rebuffs his attempts to talk to her, and after gaining employment at the local diner, is further dismayed to find that Newt works there. She tries to have him fired, but eventually accepts that they must work together. After she is locked in a cupboard by Lauren, Rae reveals that she is claustrophobic and believes she is cursed. She tells Newt that both of her sisters died before their 18th birthdays and she believes the same will happen to her. Newt helps Rae to overcome her fear of the curse, and she agrees to move to Scotland with him. However, her grandmother suffers a stroke shortly before her planned departure, so she decides to stay in Hollyoaks to care for her. Rae grows close to Ste, her employer at the diner, and they begin dating. Brendan Brady is jealous because he is attracted to Ste, and tries to separate them. Brendan and Ste begin sleeping together; he tells Ste to continue seeing Rae so their own relationship can remain a secret. Rae discovers that she is pregnant and Ste promises to support her. Rae considers having an abortion but ultimately decides against it. After catching Brendan and Ste kissing, Rae resolves to raise the baby alone, but suffers a miscarriage after a vicious row with Brendan. Rae threatens to out Brendan to the community, so he retaliates by setting her up and having her arrested as a drug dealer. Rae is released without charge after Warren Fox (Jamie Lomas) tampers with the substance, which is found to be icing sugar. Rae briefly works as a barmaid at a local pub, but leaves her job after exposing an affair between Gaz Bennett (Joel Goonan) and her boss Heidi Costello (Kim Tiddy). She begins a relationship with Ethan Scott (Craig Vye), unaware that he is also dating Theresa McQueen and Liberty Savage. When the women discover his infidelity, they plot their revenge together. Rae tells Ethan she has an STD, Theresa claims to be pregnant and Liberty pretends to set a wedding date. They then humiliate Ethan with the truth and throw gunge over him in front of the local residents. When Rae accidentally reveals that Brendan is gay in front of his son, Brendan is furious and threatens to kill her. Rae later tells Silas Blissett (Jeff Rawle) about Brendan's threat, but is unaware that Silas is a serial killer. Rae also reveals that she is tired of men treating her badly, and vows to use them in future. Silas steals Theresa's phone and sends Rae a text message asking to meet her outside. When Rae emerges, Silas repeatedly punches her, then strangles her to death. He places Rae's body in the boot of Brendan's car, framing him. Ste arranges a memorial for her after Brendan is charged with her murder. However, Brendan is later released when Silas is discovered as her killer. Reception In 2011, Rae, Ste and Brendan's romance plot won the \\"Best Love Triangle\\" accolade at the All About Soap Bubble Awards. Rae's murder earned a nomination for \\"Spectacular Scene of the Year\\" at the 2012 British Soap Awards. Holy Soap said that Rae's most memorable moment was being locked in a cupboard and subsequently revealing herself to be cursed. Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury called Rae's interest in Ste a mystery, noting his violent history and homosexuality as reasons Rae should have avoided him. Anthony D. Langford of AfterElton said that Hollyoaks had no interest in Rae as a character, and no desire to \\"make her a real fleshed out person\\". He added that Rae had no common sense because \\"no woman would regularly leave her man alone for long periods of time with the guy she knows he had an affair with.\\" He also said that Rae should have known that Ste and Brendan's affair had resumed. Langford later wrote that Rae's murder and the subsequent blaming of Brendan were predictable, but made \\"compelling drama\\", and that Rae had been killed in \\"a rather gruesome and shocking fashion\\". Inside Soap polled its readers on which Hollyoaks character they most wanted to be murdered by Silas. Rae and Theresa were voted as favourites to survive, while Leanne and Ruby Button (Anna Shaffer) were voted to be his next victims.

Life and education Gussow was born May 8, 1931, in New York City but grew up in Rockville Centre, NY.Cotter, Holland. \\"Alan Gussow, 65; Painted and Protected Nature.\\" New York Times. 7 May 1997. Print. He took art classes at the Pratt Institute before graduating from Middlebury College in 1952 with a degree in Literature. The following year, while studying painting at Cooper Union,Gray, Lyle. Alan Gussow--An Overview. New York: Babcock Galleries. 2006. he was awarded the Prix de Rome. Only 21 years old, he was the youngest ever to have won the award at that time. By the time he left New York to study at the American Academy in Rome from 1953 to 1955, Gussow had learned printmaking from Stanley William Hayter, and was already heavily influenced by Paul Klee, Arshile Gorky, and Stuart Davis.Sawin, Martica. Alan Gussow: A Painter's Nature. New York: Hudson Hills Press, 2009. In 1956, Gussow married Joan Dye, who was then a Time magazine researcher and later a nutritionist and chair of the nutrition department at Columbia Teacher's College. Together, they made a home with their sons in the Hudson River Valley, where they eventually became avid organic gardeners, incorporating into their home garden a method of biodynamic double digging championed by Alan Chadwick. Balancing his passion for art with teaching jobs, writing, and endeavors to save the environment, Gussow made yearly painting trips to Monhegan Island, ME and kept a studio in his New York home. He died from cancer May 5, 1997, in Piermont, NY. Art Over the course of an artistic career that lasted almost half a century, Gussow honed a visionary blend of abstraction and representation with nature as his primary subject. Gussow cites his walks through the Middlebury college campus in Vermont as some of his original inspiration to become an artist.Gussow, Alan. \\"Moving Toward the Center of Life: Art and Ceremony in Sustainable Culture\\" IC #5. Spring 1984. Page 6. His early paintings created in the 1950s and 1960s are landscapes of a more traditional nature, depicting scenes painted from a separate vantage point. Still, Gussow came of age in a time when action painting and artists like Jackson Pollock and Franz Kline were at the peak of their popularity, and eventually he connected the energy of his art with the energy he experienced in natural settings, presenting a perspective all his own. The works he created throughout the 1970s and the rest of his life capture deeper, more personal encounters with nature--smells, tastes, tactile sensations, sounds. In The New York Times, Holland Cotter describes a selection of Gussow's later pastels, \\"...passages of undulating horizontal lines suggested both flowing water and fingerprint patterns, summing up the intimate link between man and nature that was Mr. Gussow's central concern.\\" In 1980, Gussow experienced what he would later describe as a pivotal realization when he traveled with his wife to Australia and was captivated by aboriginal art. Profoundly moved by the role art played in these communities, Gussow severed his gallery connection upon returning home and began to experiment with art as a process instead of as a product. In 1982 his International Shadow Project was a prime example of his belief that an artist's duty is to connect people to their shared potential to change the world around them. On the 40th anniversary of the bombings on Hiroshima, the project involved 15,000 people painting silhouettes in the streets of 400 cities all over the world in an act of creative remembrance. Gussow's first solo museum show was in 1961 at the Washington County Museum of Fine Arts in Hagerstown, MD; he has since been the focus of more than 50 one-man exhibitions and has been included in over 60 group shows internationally. After 20 years of representation by the Peridot Gallery and Joan T. Washburn, Gussow's work has shown at the Sid Deutsch Gallery, MB Modern, Gavin Brown's Enterprise and Babcock Galleries. His work can be found in numerous significant museums as well as public and private collections in the U.S. and abroad. Gussow as an activist, author, and educator In addition to being recognized as a painter, Gussow was a voice heard nationally on matters concerning the natural environment. His first foray into the world of activism was in 1965 when he played an integral role in preventing a proposed Con Edison plant that would have destroyed Storm King Mountain in the Hudson Valley. With others, he went on to found the Citizen's Committee for the Hudson River, and brought Senator Robert F. Kennedy to the Hudson to explain the dangers facing the river. Gussow testified before Congress on environmental issues and advised George McGovern when he was a senator and embarking on his presidential campaign.Driscoll, John. Foreword. Alan Gussow: A Painter's Nature. New York: Hudson Hills Press, 2009. As a consultant for the National Park Service, he implemented and inaugurated the Artist in Residence program in the National Parks. Gussow was an active teacher for 40 years. He played a significant role in establishing the fine arts program at the Parsons School of Design, where he taught through 1968, and also taught at Sarah Lawrence College, the University of Massachusetts, Middlebury College, and the University of California in Santa Cruz where he held positions in both the Environmental Studies and the Art Department. Gussow's publications include 13 articles, essays and monographs. His book, A Sense of Place: The Artist and the American Land, published in 1972, couples works by American landscape artists spanning four centuries with excerpts of their own writing. Both this book as well as his 1993 publication, The Artist as Native: Reinventing Regionalism, inspired major gallery exhibitions.

Also known by his given birth name Saieed Jafar-Zadeh, he is better known in the public as Homay. He is the founder and leader of the Mastan Ensemble. Biography Homay was born in Gilan, a province located in North- west portion of Iran, bordering the Caspian Sea. From an early age, Homay showed an interest in the arts. His favorite subjects at school were poetry and painting. At the age of 15, he began singing and acting in theater. At 16, he entered art school where he would receive his diploma for painting. At the age of 19, he left theater school and decided to study musical harmonization and composition with focus on piano and setar. Receiving his formal education in art studies and pursuing his degree from The Conservatory of Music in Tehran, Iran, Homay studied Persian poetry. His studies were conducted under supervision of professors such as Dr. Ali Gholi Bakhtiari-Tayari and Mr. Ali- Akbar Kanni. Homay learned Gilaki folk music with Mr. Fereydoun Pour-Reza and Persian classical music (radif) with Maestros Kamal-Din Abbas, Hengameh Akhvan and Karim Saleh Azimi. At the age of 30 he decided to study Italian Opera. To learn the discipline, he traveled to Italy and Canada to study under two operatic masters - Mr. Daniel Ebi (Toronto) and Mr. Delfo Menicucci (Viargu, Italy). Homay & Mastan Ensemble Performances Homay & the Mastan Ensemble enjoyed success after the release of their album entitled \\"Molaghaat Ba Doozakhian,\\" or \\"Meeting with Sinners among the Flames\\", which was written, composed, and sung by Homay. Homay & the Mastan Ensemble released \\"In Che Jahanist?\\" (\\"Questions for Our World\\", \\"What sort of World is This?\\") in 2007, an album that examining the relationship between human beings and the reality that they create.

Over the past several years, Homay has been working on an international project entitled \\"Saving Our Planet Earth\\". To compile the various components of this project both musically and artistically, Homay has spent much time traveling and conducting research in various countries around the world, including Africa, India and Iran. Homay became a vegetarian 5 years ago. Although Homay lives in Iran, he is unable to perform there. As such, his fans travel outside the country to attend his performances. Parvaz has performed several mixed performances of Persian music in conjunction with symphony orchestras in operatic format in Belgium, Los Angeles and Toronto.

History In 1898, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of St. John's Michael Francis Howley donated land for an orphanage on the northeastern edge of the Dominion's capital, approximately north of Quidi Vidi Lake. The orphanage was named the Mount Cashel Boys Home after the Rock of Cashel in County Tipperary where it is said that Saint Patrick baptized the pagan king √ìengus mac Nad Fro√≠ch in 450 AD. The facility was located on the eastern side of the intersection of Mount Cashel Road and Torbay Road. The Mount Cashel Orphanage, as with numerous other orphanages in Newfoundland, received a bequest from the estate of James M. Ryan in 1917. Following Confederation in 1949, the provincial government began to place wards of the state at the Mount Cashel Orphanage in the 1950s.1945 Newfoundland Population Census St. John's East District For the last 40 years of operation, the facility was operated by the Christian Brothers of Ireland in Canada (CBIC). The CBIC announced on November 27, 1989 that the orphanage would be closing.Notoririous Mount Cashel Orphanage to close Canada's largest sexual abuse scandal was disclosed in 1989, resulting in the closure of the facility in 1990 after the last resident was moved to an alternate facility. The property was seized and the site razed and sold for real-estate development in the mid-1990s as part of a court settlement ordering financial compensation to the victims. Today a Sobeys supermarket at 10 Elizabeth Avenue and a small residential development called Howley Estates sit on the land once occupied by the orphanage. Sexual and physical abuse scandal A pattern of physical and sexual abuse of more than 300 orphanage residents perpetrated by staff members, specifically members of the Christian Brothers of Ireland in Canada (CBIC), was uncovered during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Multiple criminal investigations, a provincial Royal Commission of Inquiry (the Hughes Inquiry) and an Archdiocese of St. John's inquiry (the Winter Commission) resulted in criminal convictions and millions of dollars in court-imposed financial settlements. Compensation was provided by the Government of Newfoundland for orphanage residents who were wards of the state and several properties owned by the CBIC in Newfoundland and Labrador and other provinces were seized and liquidated. As of May 2009 there were still approximately 50 civil lawsuits being processed by the courts by victims of the sexual and physical abuse at the orphanage.Heritage Newfoundland and Labrador, Mount Cashel Orphanage Abuse Scandal Timeline Early complaints In December 1975 the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary (RNC) began an investigation into physical and sexual abuse allegations at the Mount Cashel Orphanage. This resulted in five staff who were members of the Christian Brothers of Ireland in Canada being implicated by twenty residents. The investigation was curtailed by the Chief of the RNC on instruction from the Department of Justice, despite two members of the CBIC admitting sexual wrongdoing. No further residents were interviewed and the two staff members were placed in treatment centres outside the province and then transferred to other CBIC-operated institutions in Canada. In 1982 the RNC began a second investigation into physical and sexual abuse allegations at the Mount Cashel Orphanage. Thirteen separate reports were written (nine by the Department of Social Services and four by the RNC). One staff member who was a member of the Christian Brothers of Ireland in Canada was charged with sexual offences and convicted, receiving a sentence of four months in jail and three years probation. 1989 media revelations A caller to VOCM's radio call-in program Open Line on February 13, 1989 mentioned suspicion of a cover-up by the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador into sexual and physical abuse at the orphanage. One of those listening to Open Line that day was a justice of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador who followed up on the issue with the provincial government's Associate Deputy Attorney-General. On February 14, 1989 the Crown prosecutor's file on the physical and sexual abuse allegations at the Mount Cashel Orphanage was officially re-opened and the RNC was instructed to complete its 1975 investigation and determine why charges were never laid. On February 19, 1989 the independent weekly newspaper The Sunday Express, under the direction of publisher Michael Harris, began to publish allegations of sexual and physical abuse perpetrated by staff at the Mount Cashel Orphanage against residents, dating back to the 1950s. These editions of The Sunday Express created a sensation across Newfoundland and Labrador and quickly led to calls for a public inquiry; within weeks of Michael Harris's interviews with Shane Earle, the government appointed Justice Samuel Hughes to hold a public inquiry that was broadcast live on television. 1989‚Äì1996 criminal investigation The RNC investigation that was reactivated in February 1989 eventually resulted in the arrest of 14 staff members (nine members of the Christian Brothers of Ireland in Canada, five lay people) on 88 counts of physical and sexual abuse. Charges were laid against four members of the CBIC in 1992 relating to the aborted 1975 investigation, followed by further charges in 1996 alleging sexual and physical abuse committed by six staff during the 1950s and 1960s. A further four staff members were eventually charged, although only nine members of the CBIC were convicted.\\"The Canadian situation\\" 1989 Royal Commission The growing controversy during Easter Week in late March 1989 as a result of The Sunday Express publication regarding the alleged cover-up by the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, the RNC, and the Archdiocese of St. John's led interim Premier Tom Rideout to announce the appointment on March 31, 1989 of a Royal Commission led by a retired justice of the Supreme Court of Ontario, Samuel Hughes QC, to investigate the obstruction of justice. The Commission, usually known as the Hughes Commission, started the Hughes Inquiry on June 1, 1989 and heard from dozens of witnesses over two years, making its report public in April 1992. It found that the Christian Brothers of Ireland in Canada staff members who had been the target of the RNC investigation in 1975 should have been charged. The commission also found that the Department of Justice had interfered with the police investigation. Commissioner Hughes recommended that the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador establish a compensation fund for the abuse victims, although no size limit was discussed, nor recommendations on providing counselling services to victims. 1989 civil lawsuit One of the victims of sexual and physical abuse at the Mount Cashel Orphanage, Shane Earle, filed a civil lawsuit in April 1989, naming the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador and the Archdiocese of St. John's as defendants. The action was amended to claim $18 million for 9 former residents of the orphanage. 1989 Archdiocesan Commission of Enquiry The Winter Commission was appointed in 1989 by bishop Penney and released its report during the following year. Its conclusion led to the resignation of Penney. Settlements and continuing litigation On April 5, 1992, the Christian Brothers of Ireland in Canada formally apologized to the victims of physical and sexual abuse at the Mount Cashel Orphanage. In response to the Hughes Inquiry, and facing dozens of civil lawsuits, the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador acknowledged its responsibility in 1997 as a result of having sent wards of the state to the Mount Cashel Orphanage and paid a settlement of C$11.25 million to approximately 40 former residents who were victims of sexual and physical abuse. The provincial government then began a process of seeking to reclaim this money from the assets of the Christian Brothers of Ireland in Canada. The CBIC announced the closure of the Mount Cashel Orphanage on November 27, 1989; it was permanently closed the following year after the last resident was relocated to another facility. The court-ordered compensation to victims saw the CBIC demolish the orphanage and sell the land to property developers for $8 million, which was paid to victims. CBIC properties across Canada became the target of court-ordered liquidation. In December 2000 The StarPhoenix reported that leaders of the Christian Brothers at the Vatican conspired to transfer ownership of the order's assets out of Canada to prevent court-ordered liquidation to pay compensation to sexual and physical abuse victims. It was also alleged that the Archdiocese of Vancouver conspired to shield Vancouver College and St. Thomas More Collegiate. On July 27, 2002 an out-of-court settlement of $19 million was paid by the two schools to the liquidating company Deloitte and Touche, appointed to oversee the liquidation of the Christian Brothers of Ireland in Canada. A news release from Deloitte and Touche stated that the settlement was \\"reasonable\\" despite the schools having a real estate value of $40 million at the time. A lawyer for Mount Cashel victims was also quoted in opposition to any of the $19 million settlement being used to pay the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, arguing that it should be used for compensating the victims. From 1996 to 2004 approximately $27 million in compensation was paid to roughly 100 victims of physical and sexual abuse at the Mount Cashel Orphanage by the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador and the Christian Brothers of Ireland in Canada. 2009 case involving Bishop Lahey Raymond Lahey, Bishop of Antigonish, announced on August 7, 2009 that the Diocese of Antigonish had reached a $15 million settlement for a class action lawsuit filed by victims of physical and sexual abuse by several diocesan priests in eastern Nova Scotia dating to the 1950s. On October 2, 2009 it was revealed by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that Lahey, while a minister at a suburban St. John's parish, had been observed in the mid-1980s to have possessed child pornography material. This accusation was made in 1989 by a then-Mount Cashel resident to the Hughes Commission; the resident had been visiting Lahey's house at the time when the material was noticed. The RNC never acted upon the revelation and did not begin an investigation.Police review 1980s allegations against bishop CBCBishop porn issue known to N.L. Church in 1989 CBC Lahey was found to have child pornography on his computer when returning from abroad to Canada in September 2009. He resigned as bishop, was suspended from priestly and sacramental duties, and pleaded guilty in 2011 to criminal charges. He was given a prison sentence (already served as pre-trial custody), and was defrocked by the Vatican the following year.

The Saber is a commercial radio that was developed for the U.S. military sometime around 1989. The Saber is widely recognizable by thin, sleek design compared to other radios at the time. Despite the fact that the Saber was originally marketed to the military, many law enforcement agencies and fire departments realized the benefits of the Saber and Motorola soon had a much larger customer base for the radio than they expected. Saber Conventional The first Saber line was Conventional operation only. The conventional Sabers were capable of PL/DPL and were encryption capable. The Saber came in 4 different flavors; I, II, III, and IE. The Model I has 12 channels in 1 zone, and no display or keypad. The IE was a Model I with an additional zone of 12 channels, 24 in all. The Model II is either capable of 4 or 10 zones, for a total of 48 or 120 channels. This is dependent on the memory. It has a backlight display which was capable of 5 alphanumeric characters if you have the 120 channel 2 KB version or the basic zone/channel display for the 48 channel version. It came with 3 softkeys to access menu options. The Model III was basically a Model II with a full DTMF keypad. Systems Saber The Systems Saber added analog trunking operation, direct access to functions via the keypad (on the Systems Saber III), and increased channel capacity to a then-unheard of 255 conventional channels. The Systems Saber also increased the number of channels per zone to sixteen and added the ability to reprogram the function of many of the controls. ASTRO‚Ñ¢ Digital Saber The Astro Saber was introduced in the mid 1990s and was a technologically advanced and state of the art at the time. The Astro Saber is feature packed Not only is it capable of IMBE Digital and conventional analog on a per channel basis, but also some models are 12.5/25 kHz per channel as well. This makes some Astro Saber Narrow Band compliant. Model I has 16 channels, in 1 zone. No display or keypad. Model II has 16 channels in 16 zones and a 14 character alphanumeric backlight display. It came with 6 softkey buttons to access an advanced menu. Model III was basically a model II with a full DTMF keypad.

Many of its themes involve the repatriation of diaspora Circassians and the revitalization of the Adyghe language. Historical context=Circassia and the Circassians before the Russian invasion Ibrahim Pasha and sons, a Circassian Ottoman Pasha The Circassians were known to inhabit their homeland since antiquity. They formed many states throughout time that were known to the outside world, occasionally falling under brief control of the Romans, and later Scythian and Sarmatian groups, followed by Turkic groups including importantly the Khazars and being a protectorate of the Ottoman Empire. Nonetheless, the Circassians generally maintained a high level of autonomy. Due to their Black Sea coast location, owning the important ports of Anapa, Sochi and Tuapse, they were heavily involved in trade, and many early European slaves were Circassians (additionally, the Mamluks of Egypt, the Persian ghulams, and the Ottoman Janissaries had a strong ethnic Circassian component). Ruling themselves, Circassians have interchangeably used feudal systems, tribal-based confederacies and monarchies to rule their lands, often incorporating a mix of two or all three. Circassia was generally organized by tribe, with each tribe having a set territory, roughly functioning as greater than a province, but less than completely autonomous, more on the level of a US state (of course, the level of autonomy varied between tribes and time). Not all of the tribes within the confederation were ethnic Circassian: at different times, Nogais, Ossetians, Balkars, Karachays, Ingush, and even Chechens participated as members of the confederation. In the 19th century, three such tribes (first one, then seeing its example, two more very close in time to each other) overthrew their feudal governments in favor of direct democracy (which some intellectuals, such as Tony Wood, argue the default government for the Chechens, at that time a neighboring polity);The Chechen Nation: A Portrait of Ethnical Features Lyoma Usmanov Jan, 9, 1999, Washington, D.C.K. Tumanov was the first to pay attention to the existence of Chechens in ancient times in East Asia and Southern Caucasus. (\\"The prehistoric language of Caucasus\\", Tiflis, 1913). however, this experiment was cut short by the conquering of Circassia by Tsarist Russia and the end of independence in favor of the rule of colonial Russia. Circassophilia in the West During and after the Enlightenment, Western European cultures showed much interest in the Circassians, specifically their physical appearance, language and culture, portraying the men as especially courageous (a legend that became especially popular in the court of London during the Crimean War when they were allies with Circassia). Circassians were often thought of as being especially beautiful, having curly black hair, light eyes and pale white skin (generally somewhat close to their actual appearance), giving rise to the phenomenon of Circassian beauties.see King, Charles. The Ghost of Freedom: A History of the Caucasus The Italian and Greek presence in port towns had an effect on both the dialects of the said Italians/Greeks and the Circassians around the area (as well as the Abkhazians, if they are to be considered Circassian). The Circassian language(s) were widely regarded as unique and beautiful by 19th century linguists (today, they are often linked to extinct languages in Anatolia). A poster from c. 1843 advertising Circassian Hair Dye Racial scientists, after discovering an intimate similarity between the skull shapes of Caucasians (primarily judged by Circassians, Georgians and Chechens, the most numerous groups), went to declare that Europeans, North Africans, Middle Eastern peoples and Caucasians were of a common race, termed \\"Caucasian\\", or later, as it is known today, as \\"Caucasoid\\". Scientific racism went far to emphasize the superior beauty of the Caucasian people, above all the Circassians, referring to them as \\"how God intended the Caucasian race to be\\" and that the Caucasus was the \\"first outpost of the superior race\\". According to Johann Freidrich Blumenbach, a chief advocate of the Circassophilic theory of Circassians as the prime and most superior examples of Caucasoid race (usually followed then by Georgians in second place), the Circassians were the closest to God's original model of humanity, and thus \\"the purest and most beautiful whites were the Circassians\\". > ...It is no exaggeration to say that for several decades in the middle of > the 19th century \\"Circassia\\" became a household in many parts of Europe and > North America. Correspondents from major newspapers found their way to > Circassia or gleaned information from foreign consuls and merchants in > Trebizond and Constantinople. The \\"Circassian question\\", the political > status of the northwestern highlands of the Caucasus, was debated in > parliaments and gentlemen's clubs.King, Charles. The Ghost of Freedom: A > History of the Caucasus. Oxford, 2010. Page 93. Meanwhile, beauty products got names in the US and Western Europe such as \\"Circassian Soap\\", \\"Circassian Curl\\", \\"Circassian Lotion\\", \\"Circassian Hair Dye\\", \\"Circassian Eye Water\\", etc. The Circassian is also known to be, somewhat correctly, tall and thin. This admiration developed for the Circassians, especially their physique, but also (later) their culture, which in some ways resembled that of Medieval Europe, such as the feudal system employed by some tribes. Though Circassophilia already was a fad in the West, it took a suddenly different form during the Crimean War, when the alliance with the Circassians of Britain led to a more understanding, even sympathetic view of them: rather than a simple obsession with their physical characteristics; expressions of solidarity with the \\"beautiful, honorable Circassians\\" became a sort of war rally. Britain glumly observed the Muhajirs (Caucasian exiles) miserably, only to forget that the Circassians ever existed decades later once their country had been absorbed by Russia. This had a profound effect on modern nationalism, as noted by Charles King.King, Charles. The Ghost of Freedom: A History of the Caucasus. Oxford, 2010. Pages 92-123. Russian invasion, conflict and Muhajirism Circassian warrior during Russian-Circassian War The mountaineers leave the aul, by P. N. Gruzinskyy, 1872 The earliest date of Russian expansion into Circassian land was in the 16th century, under Ivan the Terrible, who notably married a Kabardin wife Maria Temryukovna, the daughter of Muslim prince Temryuk of Kabardia to seal a contract of alliance with the Kabardins, a subdivision of the Circassians. After Ivan's death, however, Russian interest in the Caucasus subsided and they remained largely removed from its affairs; with other states in between Russia and Circassia, notably the Crimean Khanate and the Nogai Horde.See Charles King's The Ghost of Freedom: A History of the Caucasus The Circassians freely roamed in their native regions for centuries afterwards, but during the peaks of the Persian Safavids and Afsharids, parts of the Circassian lands fell under Persian rule for a brief number of years. In the 18th century, however, Russia regained its imperial ambitions in the region, and expanded steadily southward, with the eventual goal of obtaining the riches of the Middle East and Persia, using the Caucasus as a connection to the region. The first incursion of the Russian military into Circassia occurred in 1763, as part of the Russo-Persian War. Eventually, due to a perceived need for Circassian ports and a view that an independent Circassia would impede their plans to extend into the Middle East (plans which were never achieved), Russia soon moved to annex Circassia. Tensions culminated in the devastating Russian- Circassian War, which in its later stages was eclipsed by the Crimean War. Despite the fact that a similar war was going on at the other side of the Caucasus (Chechnya, Ingushetia, and Dagestan fighting against Russia to preserve their states' existence), as well as the attempts of some (ranging from Circassian princes to Imam Shamil to Britain) to connect the two struggles, connections between the Circassians and their allies with their Eastern Caucasian counterparts were quashed by an Ossetian alliance with Russia. Hostilities peaked in the 19th century, and led directly to the Russian-Circassian War, in which the Circassians, along with the Abkhaz, Ubykhs, Abazins, Nogais, Chechens and in the later stages the Ingush (who started out as allies of Russia), as well as a number of Turkic tribes, fought the Russians to maintain their independence. This conflict became entangled with the ensuing Crimean War, and at various times the Ottomans gave small assistance to the Circassian side. Additionally, the Circassians succeeded in securing the sympathies of London, and in the later stages of the Crimean War, the British supplied arms and intelligence to the Circassians, who reciprocated by busying the Russians and returning with intelligence of their own. However, this was not enough to save the Circassians from the oncoming defeat and Russian domination. Russia finally subdued the Circassians, tribe after tribe, with the Ubykhs, Abazins, Abkhaz and Balkars being last. While some tribes accepted Russian rule after being firmly conquered, others continued insurgency, even though Circassia as a whole had surrendered. Russia soon proceeded to order the Muhajirs. Approximately 1-1.5 million Circassians were killed, and upon order of the Tsar, and most of the Muslim population was deported (i.e., all except Ossete Muslims and Kabardins; the modern Circassians and Abazins either managed to escape or, as is the case with most, returned; at the time after the deportation, as Charles King notes in his books, travelers who searched throughout the area for Circassians could not find any left except the Kabardins), mainly to the Ottoman Empire, causing the exile of another 1.5 million Circassians and others. This effectively annihilated (or deported) 90% of the nation. Circassians refugees were viewed as an expedient source for military recruits, and were settled in restive areas of nationalist yearnings- Armenia, the Kurdish regions, the Arab regions and the Balkans. The Balkan and Middle Eastern societies they settled among considered them foreign aliens, and tensions between the Circassians and the natives over land and resources occasionally led to bloodletting, with the impoverished Circassians sometimes raiding the natives.King, The Ghost of Freedom, pages 97-98. At the Conference of European Countries which was held in December 1876 ‚Äì January 1877 in Istanbul, the idea of transferring the Circassians from the Balkans to the Asian states of the empire was introduced. With the beginning of the Russian-Ottoman War in 1877, Circassians abandoned their villages and set on the road with the retreating Ottoman troops. Still more Circassians were forcefully assimilated by nationalist Muslim states (Turkey, Iran, Syria, Iraq, etc.) who looked upon non-Turk/Persian/Arab ethnicity as a foreign presence and a threat. In modern times=Emergence of the modern movement The modern movement has its roots in secret societies as well as organizations during the perestroika period under Mikhail Gorbachev. Support Circassian nationalism is becoming increasingly popular among younger Circassians, and to a lesser extent, older ones as well. It is now almost universally popular among younger Circassians, causing fears for the Russian government (especially as now the Circassians' neighbors, such as the Balkars/Karachei, have adopted similar agendas). It is suspected by some analysts that even the republican governments have members with nationalistic agendas. Modern Circassian nationalism is the ideology of several activist groups in the so-called \\"Circassian belt\\" of autonomous republics in Russia, as well as in areas where the Circassian diaspora is (Turkey, Israel, etc.), and in Abkhazia, which has ethnic ties to Circassia. The widely criticized 1999 election in Karachay‚ÄìCherkessia where the Cherkes candidate was beaten became a symbol of martyrdom, causing huge crowds of Abazins and Circassians in the capital to lead protests.http://www.iwpr.net/?p=p&s;=f&o;=159562&apc;_state=hENf-159565 Both Adyge Khase and the International Circassian Organization have declared that their aim is \\"to protect the rights of the Circassians wherever they live and to facilitate the return of the substantial portion of the Circassian Diaspora to the Circassian inhabited lands of the Northwest Caucasus to change the demographic structure\\" (back to what it was before ethnic cleansing occurred) Attempting to achieve recognition of the \\"Circassian genocide\\" is also a very prominent movement among Circassians, though it is not necessarily purely nationalist. Another major movement, often tied into this, but more blatantly nationalistic, is the movement to recreate a \\"historical Circassia\\", the core of Circassian nationalism, with its historical territories, and make Circassian one group on the census. There is a feeling among some Circassians that the notion that Kabardins, Adyghe, Cherkes and Shapsugs (all four are separate on the Russian census) are different nations is a Kremlin strategy designed to divide the Circassian nation. Many politicians even warn that if this is not removed, that \\"dismemberment will ultimately lead to the death of the Circassian nation\\". Many Circassian nationalists (moderates, such as Cherkesov) do not advocate withdrawing from the Russian federation, holding instead that a unified Circassia still within Russia is good enough. Nonetheless, most assert that this unified Circassia within Russia should have one official language, Adyghe. The movement to split Karachay‚ÄìCherkessia and Kabardino-Balkaria has won itself the official support of many Circassians (especially in Karachay‚ÄìCherkessia, where Karachay and Russians dominate government posts) as well as the influential Circassian organization \\"Adyge Khase\\". After the crisis involving the ethnic identity of the man who first scaled Mt.Elbrus, a group of young Circassians, led by Aslan Zhukov, reconquered the mountain in a symbolic move. Aslan Zhukov (also 36-year-old founder of Adyge Djegu, another major Circassian nationalist organization) was then murdered on 14 March 2010 by a gunshot in a dark alley. His death spurred another round of rioting among Circassians, who variously attribute his death to the government of the republic, the Russian government, the Russians in the republic or the Karachay, some combination, or all four. The head of the republic said that his death should not be painted in ethnic terms but this only resulted in the addition of him to the list of possible culprits from the Circassian point of view. Adygea In Adygea, a number of reports came in August 2009 about Russian Orthodox crosses being thrown off mountains in symbolic demonstrations against the Russian Orthodox church, viewed by Circassians as a symbol of oppression. The perceived favoritism of Moscow towards the Cossacks is also a major bone of contention amongst Circassians. An organization calling itself \\"Union of Slavs\\", led by Nina Konovaleva and Boris Karatayev, was created in 1991 to counter the activities of Circassian organizations such as Adyge Khase, and prevent Circassians from removing Russians from positions of prestige and power, as well as to \\"protect Russians/Cossacks from Circassian control of the land\\". In 1991, Union of Slavs in Adygeya actively opposed the establishment of Adygeya as separate from Krasnodar Krai as an ethnic republic within Russia, stating that Circassians were only 22% of the populace and as such, it was not fair to the other 78%. The Union of Slavs has called the increasing autonomy of Adygeya and the activism in Karachay‚ÄìCherkessia and Kabardino-Balkaria part of a \\"dangerous conspiracy\\" to create a \\"Greater Circassia\\", achieve demographic dominance by repatriating Diaspora Circassians, and then marginalize or even expel the Russian residents (\\"colonists\\", in Circassian ideology).\\"What is there in the ICA‚Äôs Dossier‚Äù published in the Russian Language bulletin of the Union Of Slavs, Za Kubanye in Adygeya in its October 2000 edition, No: 21 It has called for the liquidation of the three Circassian republics (two of which are also shared with Karachays or Balkars) due to \\"discrimination of Russians\\". In Karachayevo-Cherkessia In November 2009, in response to a fallacious news article deemed to slander the nation, Circassian activists ramped up efforts with the scheduling of a mass-protest against the ignorance of the Russian government and the Russian people of their rights in Karachaevo-Cherkessia. However, the government canceled the gathering, saying it would be banning any and all public gatherings for an indefinite period to prevent the spread of the H1N1 flu virus.http://www.09biz.ru, 19 November However, the head of the Circassian youth movement, Timur Jujuev, said \\"All the public markets continue working on a regular basis, so where is the emergency? We are going to organize the demonstration even if we will need to wear surgical masks and even if we do not have a license from the government. This is not the will of one or two men; it is the will of a nation, and we have right to say what we think\\".http://www.kavkaz-uzel.ru, 19 November There has also been a swift escalation of tension between the Circassians and the non-Circassians in the three republics (Russians, Karachai and Balkars). While the Russians in Adygea demand the abolition of Adygea, the Karachai have taken to a strategy of keeping Circassians out of office- Jamestown reports that \\"Over the last seven months, the Karachai majority in the KCHR parliament have repeatedly banned the Circassian candidate Vyacheslav Derev from taking a position in the Russian Federation Council\\" (the time of reporting was November 2009).NTR local television channel, 12 November Furthermore, for the last 31 years, no Circassian has held the highest post in the republic, as the Soviet and then Russian officials always appointed Karachai. There is a movement, highly popular among both Circassians and Karachai, to divide the republic into monoethnic units of Cherkessia and Karacheia, perhaps to prepare these units for a merger. There have also been numerous clashes between Karachai and Circassian historians over various historical issues. One of the most scandalous cases occurred when Karachai historians claimed that the conqueror of Mt. Elbrus (Khashar Chilar in Circassian, Hilar Hakirov in Karachai) was a Karachai rather than a Circassian from Nal'chik (going against the testimony of the members of the early 19th century expedition to the top of the mountain which he led). On 20 November, a poster hailing the \\"great Karachai hero\\" Hakilov in Cherkessk was burned and destroyed by unknown perpetrators.\\"Cherkessk\\", 21 November What actually started the protests by Circassians in Karachaevo-Cherkessia was a news article by the local newspaper Express-Post. It denied the fact that the Circassian village of Besleney had saved dozens of Jewish children from the Nazis, prompting a joint Jewish- Circassian contingent to protest the existence of the report as well as an outcry in Circassian-operated independent media sources. Express-Post apologized later, but it was these protests that were planned to be spread to the capital (and canceled) to protest the general \\"deep oppression\\" of Circassians. In Kabardino-Balkaria Intended to coincide with protests in Karachay‚ÄìCherkessia, Circassian youth groups held mass \\"national protests\\" in Kabardino-Balkaria on 17 November 2009. It was attended by about 3000 people (considering that it was limited to the city of Nal'chik and the small population of the republic's Circassian population alone, let alone in that city, this is a huge figure). Ibragim Yagan, a leader of a Circassian NGO posted a video on Facebook. It featured him standing under both the flag of the Russian Federation and the Circassian national flag, called upon all Circassian youth to wake up to claim their rights and historic lands. He said that \\"We have been constantly watched, followed, blackmailed for our political activities... But we cannot lose anymore, because we have already lost everything.\\" Yagan is then drowned out by a wave of cheers. It is important to note that unlike in Adygea (22% Circassian as of 2003) and Karachay‚ÄìCherkessia (11-16%, depending on if the Abazins are considered Circassian, in 2003), Kabardino-Balkaria has a clear Circassian (of the Kabardin subdivision) majority (at 55%). However, \\"after the parliament of KBR ratified the bill ‚ÄòOn land and territory‚Äô earlier this month, each Balkar living in KBR in turn has received 10.6 hectares of the land while only 1.6 hectares belong to each Circassian\\" noted Jelyabi Kalmykov, and this soon became a rallying cry at the protest.Gazeta Yuga, 19 November, cited in Jamestown Article (let us find this thing... and translate it) Ruslan Keshev, the leader of the Circassian Congress in Kabardino-Balkaria declared that \\"If the government does not listen to us we are ready for radical actions. This is the only homeland we have.\\" Russian recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia The Russian recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia is also an issue. On one hand, Circassians are often highly enthusiastic to help the Abkhaz, who they view as brothers, and are enthusiastic also for Abkhazia's independence. On the other hand, however, it evidences a perceived double standard used negatively on the Chechens (whom many Circassians supported during the First Chechen War), and to a lesser extent, the Circassians as well. Paul A. Goble noted that the recognition of South Ossetia, in addition to enraging the Chechens and Ingush, also radicalized many Circassians against Russia, because of the mass of double standards. There is a large amount of cooperation between Circassian activists and Abkhazia as well: Circassians poured into Abkhazia to assist them in their war for independence against Georgia, and most websites dedicated to independence of Circassia or promotion of Abkhazia are linked to their cross-Caucasus counterpart. According to Western Circassophile John Colarusso, some Circassians consider Abkhazia a possible addition to Circassia if the Abkhaz themselves wish to join. Repatriation Repatriation has been a major issue. The Russian state (as well as Russians in general), as noted above, is highly suspicious of any return of the Circassians (not in the least because it was Russia who exiled them in the first place for \\"security reasons\\"), while Circassians living in Circassia view it as the only way to revive the nation and save it from extinction. The Circassians have set up a number of organizations with the explicit goal of encouraging return of their \\"brothers\\". The most notable of these is the ICA (International Circassian Association)'s \\"Repatriation Committee\\", which has branches in several countries. Russia has a double digit official repatriation quota for Circassians viewed by many (Colarusso, Henze, etc.) as being an attempt to prevent the Circassians, who are viewed as a threat, from returning. On 9 August 2009, Adygea officially attempted to overrule the Russian immigration quota for Circassians by putting forth its own de facto quota, which was drastically higher, allowing many more Circassians to return to their homeland. According to Western Circassophile John Colarusso, the movement to allow and encourage Circassian return to their homeland (hence, changing the demographics in a way that is advantageous for the Circassians and disadvantageous for the Russians) is one of the major objectives and rallying points of the modern movement.The World & I, November 1991 issue. Washington, D.C.: The Washington Times Publishing Corporation. Pp. 656-669. [translated into Circassian, Russian, Turkish, and Arabic] Russia has also unintentionally (in addition to the single-digit quota for Circassians, which is defined as including all four of the census groups as well as the Abazins) set up a number of barriers. According to an essay by Cicek Chek, these include: > Circassians living in the North Caucasus and the more numerous Circassians > living in the Diaspora have been seeking a radical simplification of the > procedures for the repatriation of the community. Most Circassians who have > tried to return have fallen under the provisions of the 1991 Russian > citizenship law which requires that: * they give up their previous > citizenship, * live in the country for five years before getting Russian > citizenship * know Russian, and pass a test on the Russian Constitution, * > keep a large sum in a bank of the republic that they try to acquire the > citizenship from, and * people holding non-ordinary passports (diplomatic, > privileged, etc) could not apply at all.

It has been reported that the fact that Russia's repatriation policies have shown heavy favoritism to ethnic Russians and have granted very few if any Circassians the right to return is another major grievance, especially considering that the return of Circassians to Russia would aid Russia in its attempts to overcome its crisis of declining population. Diaspora renaissance In the first decade of the 21st century, the Circassian diaspora abroad has begun experiencing a cultural reawakening. Contacts are being established with their homeland, but also, more importantly, there are now many institutions being founded to strengthen the Circassian identity within the diaspora. For example, in 2005, the Circassian Education Foundation (website here: ), a scholarship fund for Circassians, was founded in Wayne, New Jersey, USA. It is, in fact, a creation of a mother- organization, the Circassian Benevolent Organization. It has since given scholarship funds to Circassians across the US. The organization (Circassian Education Foundation) has also worked on a project of making a free online Circassian-American English dictionary (available here: which will then, it hopes, be used by Circassians for their language so they can, in turn pass it on to their children as well as revitalize it. The Circassian diaspora in the Middle East also are undergoing a cultural reawakening, largely due to the reestablishment of contacts with their homeland, however, unlike that in Western countries (primarily the US, Germany, The Netherlands, Austria and Israel), it is often paired with tension between Circassians and the ethnic majority of the country, Arabs or Turks.Colarusso, John. Circassian Repatriation: When Culture is Stronger than Politics. The World & I, November 1991 issue. Washington, D.C.: The Washington Times Publishing Corporation. Pp. 656-669. [translated into Circassian, Russian, Turkish, and Arabic] -- available here: The governments of Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Russia and Iran have all forced assimilation of Circassians and suppressed their culture in the past and suppressed various attempts at past renaissances. Nonetheless, in the past few years, in many of these countries, the diaspora has become much more aware of their identity and active. \\"Nart-TV\\", a program broadcasting from Adygeya, about Circassian identity, history and life, is now broadcasting in many Middle Eastern countries, including Israel and Jordan. On 8 August 2010, a university opened in Amman, Jordan, specifically for Circassians to preserve Circassian heritage and culture, with classes in the Circassian language and on Circassian culture and history in addition to practical topics. Russian reaction Russians may view Circassian nationalism extremely fearfully and suspiciously, not simply because it claims a chunk of what Moscow considers its territory, but because, just as was the case with Chechnya, the Baltics, and so on, nationalist movements may result in the loss of the previous prestige and dominance by ethnic Russians, a stigmatization of the Russian language, and the re-establishment of native dominance (hence, the \\"South Africa\\" syndrome). As a result of tensions, politics in all three republics are often highly ethnic-based, and in Kabardino-Balkaria and Karachay‚ÄìCherkessia, the dispute is often three-way (Russians vs. Circassians and Abazins vs. Karachay in Karachay‚ÄìCherkessia; Russians vs. Kabardins vs. Balkars in Kabardino-Balkaria). While Kabardino-Balkaria and Karachay‚ÄìCherkessia's non-Circassian leaders have come under fire from Circassian nationalists for \\"oppression\\", ethnic Adyge leader Aslan Dzharimov of Adygea styled himself as a moderate who would balance the centralizing urges of Moscow and the Russians against the autonomism/separatism of the Adyge.Aslan Dzharimov, Ozerklikten Cumhuriyete Adigey (From Autonomy to Republic: Adygeya), in Turkish, Turkiye Isbirligi ve Kalkinma Ajansi, 1996, Ankara/Turkey, page 16. Although originally popular on this premise, he soon ended up angering both sides, and Adyge Khase denounced him as a collaborationist and \\"traitor to the Circassian nation\\". Russians may often view the three republics as integral parts of Russia, especially since Russians are an overwhelming majority of the resident population in Adygea. The Russian government has taken to either trying to silence the nationalism or trying to gain control over individual Circassian activist groups. Analysts, even Russians such as Sergei Markedonov have voiced concern over what they perceive as the continuing \\"radicalization\\" of Circassian youth due to the Kremlin's attempts to control them, and are disappointed that Medvedev continues this policy. In addition, Russia officially keeps a very low immigration quota for Circassians - as low as 50 (though the only republics Circassians would likely to immigrate to are those in former Circassia). The government of Adygea, however, has seized the opportunity to override this quota for their own territory with their own version: 1400 per year for Adygea alone (rather than 50 per year for all of Russia). After Russian protest at this action, Adygea said that they were in fact acting on Yeltsin's own words ‚Äì for republics to \\"take as much sovereignty as they can swallow\\". Russia has criticized http://www.natpress.net/stat_e.php?id=4513 articles in the constitutions of the three republics discussing heritage, language and the like and labeling them as \\"separatist\\", recommending they be edited. Some websites, such as CircassianWorld have published various articles of stories from Circassian activists about them (the activists) being intimidated by \\"FSB veterans\\", as the activists claim they identified themselves. Russia has denounced several of the assertions that the Adygei have of their history (in addition to Ukrainian accounts of Holodomor and Chechen and other accounts of the perceivedly genocidal deportation to Siberia) - including the genocide - as false and \\"fabrications\\", and as attempts to throw tar on Russia's reputation. The Cossacks, even more than other Russians, are highly antagonistic towards Circassian nationalism, as it is towards their aims, which include the revival of traditional Cossack paramilitary forces, already underway in Russia (see Cossacks and related pages). Circassians believe that will be a tool, as the Cossacks were in the past, for oppression of ethnic minorities and silencing their demands.Valery Tishkov, Ethnicity, Nationalism and Conflict In And After The Soviet Union: The Mind Aflame, Sage Publications, London, Thousand Oaks, New Delhi, 1997, page 236. Many journalists, both Circassian and Russian (for example, Natalya Rykova), have stated that Russian \\"skinheads\\" are intrinsically tied to the ethnic tensions in the \\"Circassian\\" republics, whose opinions they perceive as being advanced not in the least by the Russian media. According to the above-cited article from Window-On-Eurasia, \\"Polls show that many Russians believe the problem of hate crimes can be solved either by restricting immigration or by toughening law enforcement\\", and that \\"...Confronted with this challenge, the Russian government has largely failed to do what is necessary to contain it. It \\"liquidated\\" a special ministry for nationality affairs. It closed the federal program for promoting tolerance and countering extremism. And it fails to provide sufficient funds and staff to other ministries to deal with the challenge.\\" Furthermore, Putin's current policy for internal division of the Russian Federation is not at all pleasing for advocates of self-determination: it advocates \\"enlargement of regions of Russia\\". Sergei Mironov stated on 30 March 2002 that \\"89 federation subjects is too much, but larger regional units are easier to manage\\" and that the goal was to merge them into 7 federal districts. Gradually, over time, ethnic republics were to be abolished to accomplish this goal of integration. (English Translation) Many people, ranging from Circassian activist coordinators to Akhmed Zakayev, Ichkerian head of government-in-exile to the liberal journalist Fatima Tlisova have speculated that Russia has tried to use a policy of divide and rule throughout the North Caucasus (citing examples of the Circassian vs. Karachai/Balkar rivalry, Ossetian-Ingush conflict, Georgian-Abkhaz conflict, Georgian-Ossetian conflict, interethnic rivalries in Dagestan and even the Nagorno-Karabakh War, which Russia also insists on mediating), creating \\"unnatural conflicts\\" that can only be solved by Kremlin intervention, keeping Caucasian peoples both weak and dependent on Russia to mediate their conflicts. Sufian Jemukhov and Alexei Bekshokov, leaders of the \\"Circassian Sports Initiative\\" stated that the conflict \\"has the potential to blow up the whole Caucasus into a bloody mess with the mass civilian casualties and therefore keep the Circassians from opposing the Sochi Winter Olympics...Moscow plays the conflict scenario when the participants do not have the ability to solve the conflict, but the conflict is absolutely manageable and can be easily solved by its rulers from the Kremlin.\\"Adygey Natpress, 14 November... let's find this... (my Russian is little more than nonexistent) In the context of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics The occurrence and location of the Sochi Olympics are particularly inflaming, and even insulting, to Circassians. They will take place at the site of one of the largest post Russo-Circassian war massacres of Circassians, and on the official anniversary of Circassian Genocide. As a result, it has become a rallying point to the Circassian activist organizations. Campaign for genocide recognition Former Russian President Boris Yeltsin's 1994 made a statement acknowledging ‚Äúresistance to the tsarist forces [in the 19th century] was legitimate,‚Äù but he stopped short of recognizing ‚Äúthe guilt of the tsarist government for the genocide.‚Äù A few years later, the leaders of Kabardino-Balkaria and Adygea sent appeals to the Duma, asking it ‚Äúto reconsider the situation and to issue the needed apology.‚Äù In the later years of the 2000-2010 decade, the movement to secure recognition for the Circassian genocide, largely taking a leaf out of the book of the Armenians has gained in momentum and popularity. Reasons for this include the location of the Sochi Olympics, US recognition of the Armenian genocide (prompting a bill on the Circassian genocide in New Jersey, where most Circassians in the US live) and the repeated insistence by Russians that the Georgians committed \\"genocide\\" against the Abkhaz and Ossetes. In October 2006, the Circassian organizations operating in Russia, Turkey, Israel, Jordan and several other countries with well-sized diasporas sent the president of the European Parliament a letter with a request to recognize the genocide against the Circassian people. There has been no action taken so far. Circassians have attempted to attract global media attention to the Circassian Genocide and its relation to the city of Sochi (where the Olympics were held in 2014) by holding mass protests in Vancouver, Istanbul and New York during the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics. On 20 March 2010, a Circassian Genocide Congress was held in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi, funded in part by the Circassian members of the Western political analysis center, the Jamestown Federation. The congress passed a resolution, urging Georgia to become the first UN-recognized State to recognize the Circassian Genocide. In May 2011, Georgia followed through and recognized the acts as a genocide.Georgia Says Russia Committed Genocide in 19th Century. The New York Times. 20 May 2011Georgia Recognizes ‚ÄòCircassian Genocide‚Äô . Civil Georgia. 20 May 2011Recognizes Russian 'Genocide' Of Ethnic Circassians. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. 20 May 2011 Soon after, the Chechen separatist government-in-exile announced that it commended Georgia's decision, and advocated pan-Caucasian solidarity, and Circassians, Georgians, Chechens and other Caucasian diaspora in European countries staged demonstrations to show their support. In appreciation for the Georgian recognition, the Georgian flag was seen flying in Nalchik, the capital of Kabardino-Balkaria, which had been a bastion of anti-Georgian sentiment before the recognition.

The play makes use of a dramatic conceit whereby the Czech communist cabinet minister Josef Frank is imagined alive in the 1970s (in real life he was hanged in 1952), and his hallucinations of life in Stalinist Czechoslovakia interweave with the main plot. In an introduction to the play, Brenton wrote that he was \\"trying to write a kind of Jacobean play for our time, a 'British epic theatre'. Making only limited use of naturalism, the play features several long speeches; in the same introduction Brenton quotes Julie Covington, who appeared in the original production, as describing acting in it as being \\"like opening a furnace door - your time comes, you open the door and blaze, then shut it\\".Brenton: Plays One, Methuen 1986 Stage history The play was commissioned by the National Theatre as part of a policy of staging new plays by leading authors in the company's new South Bank home.Peter Hall's Diaries edited by John Goodwin, Hamish Hamilton, 1983 p. 168 At the time Brenton was a Marxist and seen as something of a polemicist; however, in an interview with Theatre Quarterly from around the time the play was being written, he expressed dissatisfaction with fringe theatre - the context in which his plays had previously been seen - and a desire to reach the bigger audiences subsidised theatre companies would provide.Peter Hall's Diaries edited by John Goodwin, Hamish Hamilton, 1983 p. 170 Furthermore, in the play's programme, Brenton disclaimed being a moralist. Weapons of Happiness became the first commissioned play to be performed at the reopened National Theatre when it premi√®red on the Lyttelton stage on 14 July 1976.\\"National Theatre\\" Retrieved on 6 October 2009 The cast included Geoffrey Bateman as Joseph Stalin, Nick Brimble, Julie Covington, Frank Finlay as Josef Frank, Bernard Gallagher, Michael Medwin, William Russell and Derek Thompson. It was designed by Hayden Griffin and directed by David Hare, a collaborator of Brenton from Portable Theatre Company and co-writer with him of Brassneck and Pravda, itself staged at the National. Given the subject of the play, it is ironic that its first production took place against the backdrop of the National Theatre itself undergoing a good deal of difficulties with trade unions.Cf. Peter Hall's Diaries While the play drew in a younger, more radical audience to the National Theatre, Peter Hall, the artistic director of the theatre, noted in his diary that the stage crew (many of whom were political) did not care for it, and that he was disappointed by the newspaper reviews.Peter Hall's Diaries edited by John Goodwin, Hamish Hamilton, 1983 pp. 242-3 However, Michael Coveney was enthusiastic, describing in the Financial Times \\"highly charged scenes that speak directly about the quality of life in England today\\". The production ran for 41 performances, and Weapons of Happiness went on to win the Evening Standard Award for Best Play. The play was sufficiently successful that after it opened Peter Hall asked Brenton for another, which would be the controversial The Romans in Britain.Power Play: the life and time of Peter Hall by Stephen Fay, Hodder & Stoughton 1995 P.278 Weapons of Happiness was revived at the Finborough Theatre in 2008.

The plot follows a soldier returning from World War II who marries the woman of his dreams, but he is unable to consummate his marriage, ruining the couple's chances of a shared happiness. The film is the first American feature film by Konchalovsky and opened the 41st Venice International Film Festival. Maria's Lovers also was nominated C√©sar Award for Best Foreign Film. Plot In the spring of 1946, Ivan, an American soldier, returns home psychologically scarred after spending some time in a Japanese prison camp during World War II. Once back in his small Pennsylvania town, Ivan settles in, trying to put his life back together while living with his stoic peasant father. Shortly after his arrival, Ivan looks for his childhood sweetheart, Maria, a beautiful woman who is taking care of her old deaf grandmother. However, he is disappointed to find Maria in the arms of Al, a captain. Ivan's father thinks that Maria is too good for his son, but perhaps good enough for himself. He pairs his son with Mrs Wynic, a flirty neighbor. Ivan has sex with her, but he is tormented by the traumas of the war. He tells her that it was his dreams about Maria that allowed him to survive the prison camp. Ivan is given a hero's welcoming by his community, formed by immigrants from Yugoslavia. During the celebrations, when Al goes to dance with one of Maria's friends, Ivan grabs the opportunity to get close to her. Together they leave the party on his motorbike, heading for their favorite spot of years ago. He gives her a pair of earrings that he planted there for her, before leaving for the war. The next morning, Al is furious and breaks his relationship with Maria. Ivan's goal is fulfilled and he marries Maria in an orthodox ceremony, but his dream of a happiness shared with Maria is soon broken. Having adored Maria for so long from afar, now that they are together, Ivan is unable to consummate their marriage, disturbing their happiness. Maria works as a nurse and would like to have children. Deeply in love with Ivan, she has to deal with her increasing sexual frustration. On the advice of Clarence, a drifter singer passing by the town, Ivan reaffirms his sense of manliness with Mrs Wynic, with whom he is not impotent. Maria discovers Ivan's infidelity, and a terrible argument ensues between them. Al invites the couple to his engagement party to Maria's girlfriend. In the middle of this gathering, Al breaks off his engagement, realizing that he is still in love with Maria. Al and Ivan have a confrontation. Ivan offers to let Al have Maria, but to demonstrate his own love for Maria, he puts his hand in a burning stove. Maria, very much in love with Ivan, tells Al that she does not love him. Maria heals Ivan's hand, but the unhappiness between them increases further. She is pursued by Clarence who tries to seduce her, but she remains faithful to Ivan and resists Clarence's advances. One day, unexpectedly, Ivan leaves town by train. Moving to a new city, he starts work in a slaughter house, making new friends. Left to her own devices, Maria finally succumbs to Clarence's advances. Though she quickly rejects him, she is pregnant. Maria searches out Ivan and tells him of her pregnancy and of the death of her grandmother, but Ivan is now cruelly indifferent towards her. Out with his friends one night, Ivan meets up with Clarence. Clarence does not remember him and tells the story of how he seduced Maria, and that she later refused to have anything further to do with him. Furious, Ivan hits a still incredulous Clarence. Ivan, still tormented by nightmares of his war experiences, is visited by his father, who tells Ivan that he is dying and that he must come back to Maria. Ivan returns home, admitting to Maria that he loves her baby. Now that Maria's chaste image has vanished, she and Ivan are able to make love for the first time.

It was originally available in limited release, and there has been no plans to release an edition for other languages. Realm of the Jade Goddess is the first of the Entdecker trilogy of games, which are games based on Teuber's earlier game, Entdecker, but incorporate new themes and game mechanics. It is considered the easiest of the three games in the trilogy.  Gameplay  The players take roles of explorers in a jungle, in search of artifacts from a mysterious \\"lost city\\". Gameplay takes place on a board 11 tiles wide and deep, with the central row and column fully explored; players begin the game with their explorers (represented by jeeps) in the center space of the board. Each tile consists of either jungle sections or sections of the lost city, and lines in white or brown run through the centers of each tile (white if it runs through a jungle quadrant and brown otherwise). The game also comes with a second type of tile, the \\"artifact tile\\", which serves as the treasures to be retrieved in the game. There are both \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" artifacts, which differ in their scoring value at the end of the game. Each artifact token also consists of a particular quarter of an artifact, which are labeled \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\", and \\"D\\". At the start of a player's turn, a player may move their jeep. Jeeps may freely move along white lines, and must stop their movement after moving on a brown line. With the exception of the central (starting) tile, only one jeep may occupy any tile. If the jeep moves to a tile adjacent to unexplored terrain (that is, where no tiles are present), one tile is placed to \\"explore\\" the area. Tiles are generally randomly drawn, and must be placed so that the colors of connecting lines match between adjacent tiles. If a player draws a tile that cannot be placed, they are set aside in a player's reserve, and may be placed on subsequent explorations in lieu of drawing tiles. The player's jeep is then placed on the newly explored tile. If the player drew a tile consisting of all jungle, the player may move their jeep a second time, placing tiles if necessary. After tiles are placed, players may place an archaeologist on any lost city section of the tile, or remove an already- placed archaeologist figure. Each player has three single archaeologist figures, and one each of archaeologist figures that count as two and three archaeologists. Placing a single archaeologist is free, but a double or triple archaeologist costs one or two gold pieces, respectively, to place. When the lost city is completed (that is, when it is entirely surrounded by jungle or by the edge of the game board), the lost city is considered completed, and players gain gold pieces and artifacts depending on the number of gold coins and artifact heads depicted on each tile making up the lost city: each player having at least one archaeologist receives gold equal to the number of gold coins in the city. The player(s) with the most archaeologists in the lost city receives artifact tiles based on the number of artifact heads in the lost city. The player(s) with the second most receives half the number of artifact tiles (rounded up), and so on until every player with archaeologists in the lost city receives artifact tiles. (The exception to this rule is when there is only one artifact symbol, in which case \\"runners-up\\" receive nothing). Players may choose to move their jeep to the central (starting) tile, which allows the player to exchange one artifact tile in their possession with one of five artifact tiles that were exposed at the start of the game, or exchanging two artifact tiles for two randomly drawn artifact tiles for the price of one gold piece. After a player finishes their turn, the player may take a second turn by paying one gold piece. The game ends when all tiles are taken (that is, all tiles are either on the board or in the reserves of players) or when all artifact tiles have been claimed; in the case of the former, each player has one final turn. Each artifact tile is worth one victory point, and a completed set of artifacts (\\"A, \\"B\\", \\"C\\", and \\"D\\") is worth 5 extra points if the set consists of only \\"good\\" artifacts\\" and 3 points otherwise. The player with the most points wins, with the number of artifact tiles and the number of gold pieces used as a tiebreaker.

Whilst Chainrai has been vocal in his denial of the assertion, he has not been as forthcoming about his previous dealings with Gaydamak. Chainrai successfully sued Gaydamak for damages around the time Al Faraj purchased Portsmouth Football Club. It is currently unclear whether the damages awarded to Chainrai had been paid. Fans therefore speculate that Chainrai's arrival at Portsmouth was intended to seize the club and liquidate its assets by way of remuneration for the court order, with the Gaydamak family consequently extracting as much value from the club as was possible before the club's account was frozen.

It is a member of the Southeast Kansas Library System, a consortium of over 100 independent libraries in Southeast Kansas that provides services to member libraries such as inter-library loan. History The local library association that would later become Oswego Public Library was formed in 1867. In the early 20th Century they petitioned Andrew Carnegie, and in 1912 the original library building was constructed at 704 Fourth Street in Oswego, Kansas at the cost of $5,000. The library building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987, and when the building was expanded with a grant in 1995, great care was taken to preserve the historic architecture stylings of the building. In 2006 the Southeast Kansas Library System announced Oswego Public Library had won its \\"Library Makeover,\\" a grant project worth over US$15,000 for interior re-design. Under the direction of OPL Librarian/Director Elizabeth Turner, the project was completed on-time and under budget by the summer of 2007. Funding OPL receives funding from memorials, the city of Oswego, Kansas, the Southeast Kansas Library System, as well as the State of Kansas. Services Oswego Public Library provides library cards free of charge to local residents, provided they can provide proof-of-residency.OPL Policies The Library has a collection of over 16,000 fiction and non-fiction books, with specialized areas for young children's, teen, and adult fiction, as well as research areas for non-fiction. OPL also boasts an impressive five-year catalog of back issues of all of its nearly fifty magazine subscriptions, providing patrons with a wealth of periodical literature for research and pleasure. Hundreds of current CDs, DVDs, Books on Tape, and Books on CD are also available for checkout. OPL works with the State Library of Kansas and provides related services, such as Kansas State Library Cards. In the late 2000s, OPL received its first two Gates Foundation computers for Patron Access. Since then, those machines have been supplemented by other library technology purchases and at least two more Gates machines. In total, the library provides seven computers for patron access, including a laptop for use inside the library. OPL also offers free 802.11b/g Wi-Fi and low-cost printing. The Library has used an automated cataloging system since 1990, one of the first in the area to do so. Library makeover project In 2006 the Southeast Kansas Library System announced that Oswego Public Library had won a US$15,000 grant for an interior redesign. Along with a US$7,000 pledge from the Oswego Public Library library board, this idea became known as \\"Project OSWEGO\\"SEKLS awards Oswego Public Library Makeover Grant and yielded great results, including a new young adult section, an entirely redesigned children's area, complete with a life-size tree sculpture. A coffee house style reading area, complete with daily national and regional newspapers and weekly newspapers, pub seating, and an adequate selection of coffees and teas, was also added. KOHA Transition In 2009 the Library announced it would be moving in October to the Koha library automation system, thus providing patrons with off-site online access to library services, including inter- library loan and book reservation. When the transition is complete, a patron receiving a library card at one participating Southeast Kansas Library System Library will be able to check out materials at any other participating SEKLS Library. As of the summer of 2010, OPL staff had completed the transition. Oswego Public Library patrons may use their library cards at any other participating Southeast Kansas Library System library.

Development  For the past ten years, Diego Bu√±uel has been a foreign correspondent for French television covering countries like Iraq, Afghanistan, or the Congo. Every time he left for one of his stories, he would tell his production crew in the Paris office, \\"Don't tell my mother I am in Colombia, it makes her really nervous.\\" After a few years of traveling repeatedly, Bu√±uel realized that the international news coverage, which he was part of, only focused on the worst headlines possible. Thus, Bu√±uel embarked on a rather unusual effort ‚Äì to talk about countries that make headlines, but instead of focusing on the same three basic stories, he extended the reach of his eye to look at a more subtle vision of these countries, full of culture, people, interests that rise high above the daily news reports. Don't Tell My Mother criss-crosses the globe as Bu√±uel stops in burgeoning mega-cities ‚Äì some plagued by the overwhelming demands that come along with housing millions of residents. But all these cities are riding high on the hopes of newcomers arriving daily in search of opportunity. Whether he is spending the night in one of the most dangerous parts of S√£o Paulo with a group of graffiti artists inspiring radical social change, dressing in drag in Dhaka, or drag racing through Johannesburg, Bu√±uel explores these diverse metropolises. Bu√±uel, on the show, comments: \\"Travelling is my passion ‚Äì I'm fascinated by the remarkable stories every country has to offer. It was this desire that led me to travel the world ‚Äì to Pakistan, Venezuela, Iraq and more ‚Äì looking for stories and meeting fascinating people along the way. It was a great trip, sometimes travelling to dangerous places, which is why I never told my mother where I was when travelling ‚Äì check out my video, photos and blogs from the trip here, but do me a favour ‚Äì Don't Tell My Mother.\\"http://natgeoadventure.clix.pt/au/Show.aspx?Id=245&SetLanguage;=true Season 1=Colombia Known for drug-trafficking, kidnapping and guns, Colombia has a well-earned reputation for danger. Bu√±uel gets his first taste of this treacherous lifestyle after meeting a tailor who specializes in bullet-proof clothing. In a country that produces 80 percent of the world's cocaine, Bu√±uel goes on patrol with the farmers tasked with destroying cocaine plants one-by-one in the mine-littered fields of guerrilla country. Travelling to Medellin, Bu√±uel visits the abandoned home of drug lord Pablo Escobar, where he tours Escobar's dinosaur park full of towering dinosaur statues, and visits Escobar's pet hippos. Bu√±uel also meets one of Escobar's former hired gunmen who now teaches the children of his fallen friends. On Dead Man's Road, Bu√±uel heads to Cali, where travelling at the wrong time of day can get you kidnapped. Kidnapping is so prevalent, one radio station has developed the 'Hostage Voices' programme so relatives can send messages to hostages over the radio. Despite the rampant civil war dividing the country, Colombia has made steps forward ‚Äì in Picalena Prison, one warden has helped unite right-wing paramilitaries with left-wing guerrillas through an unlikely tactic: soccer. Afghanistan Bu√±uel takes a 52-minute road trip from the capital Kabul to Taliban hotbed Kandahar, stopping by Mazar-e-Sharif and Herat. From the Kabul golf course, to a female Army helicopter pilot, from an interview with Mullah Omar's look-alike who spent two years in hiding, to the first night-club open to Afghanis, Bu√±uelexplores stories about a country that many have tried to boil down to burkas, bearded fighters and poppy harvests. Congo Bu√±uel travels around the Democratic Republic of Congo, a place ridden with gang violence and political instability. Pakistan Bu√±uel travelled to Pakistan to break some of the stereotypes that have plagued this country. Roaming from Karachi, Hyderabad, Lahore, Islamabad and to end finally in the Pakistani Himalayas. North Korea After leaving behind his cell phone, GPS and even newspapers before entering the country, Bu√±uel poses as an actor to enter North Korea. Two friendly touring guides accompanied him and provides any necessary information. Starting in the capital of Pyongyang, Bu√±uel is housed in a hotel built on an island. Attending a Catholic mass in Pyongyang, Bu√±uel finds that there are no ordained priests in North Korea; mass is led by party members. Bu√±uel also tours a fairground where children have the chance to 'Kill American Imperialism' in a shooting game. Venturing to the world's largest stadium, Bu√±uel watches 100,000 dancers perform in celebration of 60 years of dictatorship. While this festivity paints an image of happiness and unity, the portrait is not quite as picturesque in the countryside. The effects of poverty, famine and oppression are deeply etched in the faces of its people and the landscape. Even in Pyongyang, the signs of repression are omnipresent ‚Äì from the number of dances allowed to be performed (only 5‚Äì7 according to one party member) to the images of Kim Jong Il found in every corner. Holy Land (Palestine) Bu√±uel goes from the Gaza Strip to Jerusalem. We meet a printer of the Martyrs of Gaza; Nadim, a Christian brewer in Ramallah; Lucy, who rescues Palestinian donkeys and tries to rehabilitate them; and rappers at a Gazan bachelor party. Venezuela Bu√±uel visits Caracas. He stumbles across a socialist protest where tense relations with the U.S. over politics and oil are top of mind for participants.

Background Omar Abubakar Hambagda was born on 28 July 1949. He obtained an MA from the University of Lancaster. He became commissioner for Health (1993) and Education (1999) in Borno State, and was an associate professor and head of business management at the University of Maiduguri. In 1996, he published a book: Accountability in government: the role of the civil service. First Senate term 2003-2007 Borno State, Nigeria In April 2003, Hambagda ran for the Senate on the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) ticket and was elected for the Borno South constituency. He was reelected in 2007. He was a strong contender for the position of Senate Minority leader, but lost to Senator Maina Maaji Lawan of Borno North. In January 2004, Hambagda announced that the Federal Government would start construction of a 62 kilometre road to link Nigeria with Cameroon and Chad, costing about N800 million. The road, which had been started and abandoned before, would give farmers in Borno State access to the international market. Senator Hambagda chaired the Executive sub-Committee of the National Assembly on the Review of the Constitution, which recommended approving third term for President Olusegun Obasanjo. In November 2005, he stated that he personally disagreed with this idea. However, in April 2006, he was stoned and almost lynched by angry youths in the Biu Local Government Area of Borno State who were against a third term for Obasanjo. Second Senate term 2007-2011 In November 2007, some members of Senator Hambagda's Committee on Ethics, Privileges and Public Petitions alleged that Senate President David Mark was involved in fraud and impropriety. Allegations included a N400m renovation contract of the official residence of the President of the Senate and N2.5billion that was smuggled into the 2007 supplementary budget. In January 2008, Senator Nuhu Aliyu said he had a list of alleged fraudsters in the National Assembly that included at least two committee chairmen in the Senate. Hambagda, as chairman of the Senate Committee on Ethics and Public Petition, said his committee was ready to inquire into the subject without fear or favour. In February, Senator Aliyu said that after talking to his lawyers he was withdrawing the charge and apologized to the Senate. In September 2008, the Pan-African Transparent Leadership Centre awarded him the Nelson Mandela Gold Award for his excellent leadership and contributions to society. In an interview in April 2009, he expressed support for creating a new Savannah State comprising the southern portion of Borno State. As chairman of the house committee on Ethics, Privileges and Public Petitions, he was responsible for a probe of ten senators who went to Ghana in April 2009 on an all-expenses-paid trip for a seminar on the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), where they may have been influenced by oil companies. The senate decided to refer the matter to Senator Hambagda's committee on Ethics, Code of Conduct and Privileges, with a directive to beam its hearing live so Nigerians could monitor the hearing.

She paints still life paintings, some of light bouncing off reflective surfaces, such as plastic wrap containing solid objects and empty or partially filled glassware. Background and education Janet Isobel Fish was born on in Boston, Massachusetts, and was raised in Bermuda, where her family moved when she was ten years old. She came from a very artistic family. Her father was professor of art history Peter Stuyvesant Fish and her mother was sculptor and potter Florence Whistler Voorhees. Her sister, Alida, is a photographer. Her grandfather, whose studio was in Bermuda, was American Impressionist painter Clark Voorhees. Another member of her family also named Clark Voorhees was her uncle, a wood carver whose wife was a painter. Fish knew from a young age that she wanted to pursue the visual arts. She said, \\"I came from a family of artists, and I always made art and knew I wanted to be an artist.\\" Fish was talented in ceramics, and had her mother's kiln available. She initially intended to be a sculptor. As a teenager, Fish had a job helping out in the studio of sculptor Byllee Lang. She attended Smith College, in Northampton, Massachusetts, concentrating on sculpture and printmaking. She studied under George Cohn, Leonard Baskin, and Mervin Jules. She spent one of her summers studying at the Art Students League of New York, including a painting class led by Stephen Greene. Fish received a Bachelor of Arts from Smith in 1960. This was followed by a summer residency at The Skowhegan School of Art in Skowhegan, Maine in 1961. She enrolled at the Yale University School of Art and Architecture in New Haven, Connecticut, attending from 1960 to 1963. There she changed her focus from sculpture to painting. Her instructor for an introductory painting class was Alex Katz, who encouraged students to explore the shows in New York galleries. Fish got a sense of the direction of that art world. During that period, art schools tended to favor the teaching of Abstract Expressionism, and at first Fish followed along, painting in that style. She soon abandoned it, noting that \\"Abstract Expressionism didn't mean anything to me. It was a set of rules.\\" Her fellow Yale students included Chuck Close, Richard Serra, Brice Marden, Nancy Graves, Sylvia and Robert Mangold, and Rackstraw Downes. In 1963 Fish became one of the first women to earn a Master of Fine Arts from Yale's School of Art and Architecture. Life and work After graduating, Fish spent a year in Philadelphia, then she took up residence in SoHo, where she and Louise Nevelson became friends. Fish largely rejected the Abstract Expressionism endorsed by her Yale instructors, feeling \\"totally disconnected\\" from it and desiring instead the \\"physical presence of objects\\"; but some of its very general principles, such as the boldness and smooth, flowing brushstrokes, may have influenced her figurative work. Her work, although Realist, may include abstract forms. In 1967 she enjoyed her first solo show, at Rutherford, New Jersey's Fairleigh Dickinson University. The exhibit included detailed paintings of vegetables and fruits. Her first New York exhibition followed two years after. Fish is known for her large, bold Realist still lifes, especially the way she paints everyday items such as clear glassware partially filled with water, concentrating on the shapes of the objects and the play of light off of their surfaces. She is interested in painting light and a concept she has on occasion called \\"packaging.\\" For instance, if she paints a jar of pickles, the jar becomes \\"packaging,\\" and this can translate into a searching for the light that describes the jar, and a subsequent translation into color. She created still life paintings of grocery store products packaged in cellophane. She said that the \\"plastic wrap catches the light and creates fascinating reflections\\". Among her other favorite subjects are everyday objects, especially various kinds of clear glassware, either empty or partially filled with liquids such as water, liquor, or vinegar. Examples range from glasses, bottles, goblets, and jars to a fishbowl filled with water and a goldfish. Other subjects include teacups, flower bouquets, textiles with interesting patterns, goldfish, vegetables, and mirrored surfaces. Even though she was painting still lifes, she sometimes included human figures, such as a girl performing cartwheels or a boy with his dog splashing in the water. Fish's work has been characterized as photorealist and has also been associated with new realism. She does not consider herself a photorealist; elements such as her composition and use of color demonstrate that her artistic point of view is that of a painter rather than a photographer. A writer for The New York Times said that Fish's \\"ambitious still life painting helped resuscitate realism in the 1970s\\" and that her work depicting everyday objects imbued them with a \\"bold optical and painterly energy\\". Critic Vincent Katz concurs, stating that Fish's career \\"can be summed up as the revitalization of the still-life genre, no mean feat when one considers that still life has often been considered the lowest type of objective painting\\". She has been an art instructor at the School of Visual Arts and Parsons The New School for Design (both in New York City), Syracuse University (Syracuse, New York), and the University of Chicago. Fish had two short-lived marriages, which she claims were unsuccessful at least partly due to her high ambitions and her reluctance to be a \\"good conventional housewife\\". She resides, and paints, in her SoHo, New York City loft and her Vermont farmhouse in Middletown Springs. Recognition In an interview, American painter Eric Fischl spoke of his admiration for Janet Fish: \\"She's one of the most interesting realists of her generation. Her work is a touchstone, and tremendously influential. Anyone who deals with domestic still life has to go through her, she's very important.\\" Fish has been honored with various awards and fellowships, including: * MacDowell Fellowship, 1968, 1969 and 1972 * Harris Award, Chicago Biennale, 1974 * Australia Council for Arts Grant, 1975 * Elected into the National Academy of Design, 1990 * Hubbard Museum Award, 1991 * Aspen Art Museum Woman in Arts Award, 1993 * American Academy of Arts and Letters Award, 1994 * Smith College Medal, 2012 Museum collections * Albrecht-Kemper Museum of Art, Saint Joseph, Missouri * Art Institute of Chicago * Bermuda National Gallery * Canton Museum of Art * Cleveland Museum of Art * Columbia Museum of Art * Dallas Museum of Art * Dayton Art Institute * Farnsworth Art Museum * Harn Museum of Art * Kalamazoo Institute of Arts * Maier Museum of Art at Randolph College * Metropolitan Museum of Art * Mount Holyoke College Art Museum * Museum of Fine Arts, Boston * Museum of Fine Arts, Houston * Museum of Victoria * Orlando Museum of Art * Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts * Smith College Museum of Art * Smithsonian American Art Museum * Westmoreland Museum of American Art * Whitney Museum of American Art * Wichita Art Museum ReferencesSources  External links Some sites displaying images of Fish's work: * DC Moore Gallery  Category:American women painters Category:Modern artists Category:1938 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century American painters Category:21st- century American painters Category:Artists from Boston Category:Smith College alumni Category:Art Students League of New York alumni Category:Yale School of Art alumni Category:School of Visual Arts faculty Category:Parsons School of Design faculty Category:Syracuse University faculty Category:University of Chicago faculty Category:MacDowell Colony fellows Category:Painters from Massachusetts Category:American people of Dutch descent Category:20th-century American women artists Category:21st-century American women artists ","title":"Janet Fish"},{"id":"24589585","text":"Football Club Blue Stars Z√ºrich are a football team from Z√ºrich, Switzerland that currently play in the 2.

The group believes that industrial civilization, as they define it, is endangering the environment, and that it must be destroyed using a broad range of tactics including militancy.McBay, Aric, Lierre Keith, and Derrick Jensen. 2011. Deep Green Resistance. New York: Seven Stories Press. Beliefs In the 2011 book Deep Green Resistance, the authors Lierre Keith, Derrick Jensen and Aric McBay state that civilization, particularly industrial civilization, is fundamentally unsustainable and must be actively and urgently dismantled in order to secure a future for all species on the planet. The term was created for a 2007 conference entitled Deep Green Resistance, Confronting Industrial Culture in Deerfield, Massachusetts. Lierre Keith was the main organizer. DGR holds bright green environmentalism to be inadequate. DGR believes that lifestyle changes, such as using travel mugs and reusable bags and taking shorter showers, are too small for the large-scale environmental problems the world faces. It also states that the recent surge in environmentalism has become commercial in nature, and thus in itself has been industrialized. The movement asserts that per person the industrial waste produced is orders of magnitude greater than the home waste produced; therefore, it is industrialism that must be ended, and with that, lifestyle changes will follow. Critics point out that DGR does not offer a feasible method for accelerating the massive numbers of human deaths predicted, but Keith and Jensen contend that while the reality of them not being actually able to slaughter millions of people is unpleasant, an apocalypse is inevitable anyway and delaying mass murder will only result in more suffering and that they are merely trying to prepare the world for the forthcoming death and wide-scale violence. Jensen states that if activists do not wish to participate in terrorism and murder, they, at the very least, should prepare to set up local committees to reduce or channel the additional violence. The DGR claims to be radical feminist. DGR has been described as transphobic and TERF. A transitioning member, identifying as a woman, requested to join a women's communal sleeping and showering space and, later, a women's caucus space; this was refused. McBay claimed he \\"left the organization at the beginning of 2012 after a trans inclusive policy was cancelled by Jensen and Keith. Many ... people ... left the organization for that reason\\". A 2013 post on the DGR website quixotically titled Protect Women, Feminism, and Free Speech protests and defines gender as non-existent. DGR views gender as a brutal and corrupt caste system that requires destruction. Tactics Considering that the majority of global society will not voluntary starve or die, the DGR believes armed warfare is unavoidable. It dismisses that any gradual shift to sustainability is possible. DGR believes that industrial civilization will inevitably collapse, that they must act decisively before the collapse to ensure that the Earth remains inhabitable for all organisms, and build a more sustainable society after the collapse. DGR supports an active resistance movement with the objective of accelerating the collapse of industrial civilization. Jensen has concluded that \\"the mass of civilized people will never be on our side.\\" This has led to organizing a strategy that is pessimistic about popular involvement, and therefore aims at forcing change without the majority's consensus. DGR holds that lifestyle change is not effective. Mainstream environmentalism is criticised for its emphasis on individual lifestyle changes and technological solutions, instead of confronting and holding individuals, industries, institutions and society accountable. The founders of the DGR view technological solutions, no matter how well-intentioned, as unsatisfactory and warn that they could even lead to accelerated environmental destruction. In the organization's eponymous book, Keith lists a number of reasons where she finds violence justified, although she understands that people \\"who care about justice want to reject violence\\". Keith and McBay have openly encouraged a clandestine militant network, and DGR provides support for such action. The organisation supports conflict and militancy in order to achieve its goals. The foundational book of the DGR details how a network of \\"well-organized underground militants\\" are to rise up in \\"coordinated attacks\\" to obliterate industrial infrastructure \\"perhaps using electromagnetic pulses\\". The DGR describes militant action as a potentially necessary means to achieve the drastic changes they desire. The DGR endorses violent strategies for social action. In a YouTube video they posted McBay and Keith promote the idea of clandestine networks organized along hierarchical lines, with frontline troops disciplined by a command structure, and hierarchies are best for organizing an insurgency. Jensen predicts that in the future the authorities will try to arrest members. He dismisses mass genocide as acceptable considering \\"global economy is murdering humans and non-humans\\" and \\"don't blame those who want to stop ... exploitation... help to stop the exploitation\\". He has clarified such ideas on Democracy Now!: \\"I get accused of being the 'violence guy' ... I want to put everything on the table ... it's appropriate to have militant response or non-militant response.\\" Criticism In 'Deep Green Resistance' ‚Äì How not to build a movement - A path to certain defeat, a 2012 review of the 2011 DGR manifesto, Ian Angus criticizes DGR's ideas as polarizing, elitist, extremist or asocial. Regarding advocacy for dictatorship, eco-terrorism and genocide Bron Taylor argues in Resistance: Do the Ends Justify the Means? that \\"radical tactics tend to be counterproductive\\" in winning the general public. Anarcho-primitivists John Zerzan, Kevin Tucker and others criticise the promotion of hierarchy in organising militants, the code of conduct, the historical understanding of revolution and radical history, and the cult of personality around Jensen and Keith.

He studied architecture in Madrid, but decided to cease his studies in favor of the religious life. This was often interrupted due to his struggle with diabetes and his being called for active service. But these never hindered his religious call and he did as best as he could to deal with his diabetes through his constant life of reflection and writing on spiritual subjects in his letters. He was beatified on 27 September 1992 by Pope John Paul II and was canonized a saint of the Catholic Church by Pope Benedict XVI on 11 October 2009. Life Rafael Arn√°iz Bar√≥n was born on 9 April 1911 in Burgos as the first of four sons to Rafael Arn√°iz (an engineer) and Mercedes Bar√≥n (newspaper columnists); his siblings after him were Rafael, Fernando, Leopoldo, and Mercedes. His baptism was celebrated on 21 April 1911 and he was named as \\"Rafael Arturo Alvaro Jos√© de la Immaculada Concepci√≥n i San Luis Gonzaga\\". He made his First Communion in Burgos on 25 October 1919. In his childhood he went to several schools that the Jesuits ran and from October 1920 to 1922 was at one such college in Burgos where he was noted for his artistic talents; several bouts of fever often interrupted his studies. In his adolescence it was clear that he had a range of intellectual and artistic gifts as well as those of the spiritual nature. These qualities were well- balanced in him and it produced an open and positive attitude to people and things which was characterized with exuberant good humor and respect. In 1923 his parents relocated to Oviedo and he accompanied them so that he could attend the Jesuit college of San Ignacio where he graduated in 1929. On 26 April 1930 he began his architectural studies in Madrid though suspended it for a brief period of time in December 1930 after he had a bacterial infection. His mother - in April 1921 - took him to his maternal grandmother in Madrid to recover and he was there for a month. Once he recovered his father took him to Zaragoza in August 1921 to a church for him to be consecrated to the Mother of God. Once he graduated from high school in 1930 he sought a deeper commitment to Jesus Christ which began in 1930. As a graduation present, he spent his summer vacation with his uncle Leopoldo and his aunt Mar√≠a who were the Duke and Duchess of Maqueda at their residence near √Åvila. It marked the beginning of a deep and lasting friendship among them. At their encouragement he made his first contact that September with the Trappists of San Isidro de Due√±as in Palencia. He was attracted to the silence and was attracted to the Gregorian chant such as the Salve Regina that was sung at Compline. On 15 April 1934 - having finished his architectural studies he entered the order as a postulant and then became a novice; he was convinced that this was his true religious calling. He suffered from a severe case of diabetes mellitus which developed four months after his entering the convent and was diagnosed on 26 May 1934. The saddened and perplexed novice was forced to rest at home for a few months before returning, which he did three successive times from 1935 through 1937 at the height of the Spanish Civil War (one occasion was from 29 September to 6 December 1936 and again from 7 February to 15 December 1937). He was called into the armed forces but was declared unfit for active service. On his final return to the convent - due to his medical condition - he was obliged to enter as a conventual oblate instead of as a monk taking the last place and living on the margins of the order; this circumstance revealed his intense vocational commitment. He received the habit on 17 April 1938 prior to his death and between December 1937 to April 1938 he had written 33 letters. On 22 April 1938, he suffered a high fever and became delirious at times due to that ailment; he saw his father for the last time on 21 April. He died from diabetes on 26 April 1938. His remains were relocated in 1965 and for the final time on 13 November 1972 into a small chapel. Pope John Paul II on 19 August 1989 - at WYD in Santiago de Compostela he was proposed as a model for adolescents. Spiritual values He embodied the order's charism and grace in a pure and intense manner and allowed himself to be led through a series of bewildering contradictions and perplexities such as sickness and war as well as him being unable to pronounce his vows ‚Äì he renounced himself and his self-will. He lived with humiliation until in his death he attained the essence of monastic vows ‚Äî though he was never allowed to profess them on an official level. To him, the figure of Christ was not the object of research but rather the companion of absolute love. Sainthood Tomb. The sainthood process started in Palencia in an informative process that spanned from 28 June 1961 until 30 April 1967 while theologians agreed on 25 January 1974 that all of his spiritual writings were in full accordance with the norms of the faith. The formal introduction to the cause came later on 15 January 1983 and the late Trappist became titled as a Servant of God. The Congregation for the Causes of Saints validated the informative process in Rome on 26 June 1987 and received the Positio dossier in 1987. Theologians approved this dossier on 12 May 1989 as did the C.C.S. on 11 July 1989. The confirmation of his heroic virtue on 7 September 1989 allowed for Pope John Paul II to sign a decree that titled him as Venerable. The process for a miracle took place in the location that it originated in and it received C.C.S. validation on 6 October 1989; a medical board approved it on 31 October 1991 as did the theologians on 4 March 1992 and the C.C.S. on 7 April 1992. John Paul II approved this miracle on 13 June 1992 and beatified the Trappist on 27 September 1992 in Saint Peter's Square. The process for another miracle opened in Madrid and spanned from 9 April 2005 to 7 May 2006 before its validation on 30 November 2006. Medical experts assented to this on 13 March 2008 as well as theologians on 7 June 2008 and the C.C.S. members on 4 November 2008. Pope Benedict XVI approved this miracle on 6 December 2008 and formalized the date for the sainthood celebration in a consistory on 21 February 2009. Benedict XVI canonized him on 11 October 2009. Canonization miracle The miracle that led to the canonization was the January 2001 healing of Bego√±a Alonso Leon in Madrid. She was 30 and in the fifth month of being pregnant with her daughter Laura and began to feel severe contractions and headaches as well as signs of eclampsia. On 25 December 2000 - Christmas - she was admitted at seven months into a Madrid hospital due to the symptoms worsening and after an ultrasound was directed to the surgical theatre for a cesarean section. Her daughter was born in good health but Leon's condition worsened and she was in the intensive care unit for over two weeks. Her rapid healing after this was attributed to the late Trappist whom she appealed to during her illness.

The history between Middle Tennessee and Troy dates back to 1936, which was the oldest rivalry in the Sun Belt Conference when both teams were in the same league together. In 1999, the rivalry was renewed after a 46-year hiatus. The lengthy period was a result of the two programs competing in different divisions. That all changed when Troy announced it would make the move from Division I-AA to I-A and join the Sun Belt Conference, allowing the two programs to compete annually. With both of the program's history dating back longer than any other in the conference, the proximity between the schools, and the intense recruitment for the same players, the rivalry quickly re-ignited from 1999 to 2001. The rivalry escalated when both teams unintentionally attended the same movie theater and a few verbal taunts were traded the night before the 2001 contest. In 2003, The Palladium Trophy was introduced in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. A year later, Troy officially joined the Sun Belt Conference. In 2008, ESPN named The Battle for the Palladium as one of the Top 5 Group of 5 conference rivalries in college football. The Palladium Greek mythology holds that The Palladium is a wooden statue that fell from the Heavens. It was kept at the Temple of Athena in the city of Troy. According to legend, as long as The Palladium was preserved within the walls of the city, Troy would be safe and could not be taken. However, a Raider by the name of Odysseus‚Äîalso known as the Raider of Cities‚Äîstole the Palladium during the Trojan War leading to the fall of Troy. In the spirit of the Blue Raiders' and Trojans' link to Greek mythology, Middle Tennessee and Troy compete in the Battle for The Palladium whenever they meet in football. Legend dictates the winner of The Palladium gains an unknown and unexplainable advantage over the other making it more difficult to regain control during future battles. The history between the two schools dates back to 1936 with the Blue Raiders owning a 12‚Äì9 advantage in the series. History of the trophy In 2003, alumni from Middle Tennessee undertook a grassroots effort to engage fans, alums, and the Student Government Associations from both schools to capitalize on the escalating rivalry with a trophy. The Palladium became the perfect match due to the schools' Greek Mythology ties. Middle Tennessee's mascot, Lightning, is a Pegasus-like winged horse, and the city of Troy has forever been linked to Greek Mythology. Marcia Berkall, a wood carving artists who owns Whittlins and Wood, was commissioned to replicate the wooden statue of Athena and The Palladium was born. The Palladium is approximately three feet tall and is made of basswood. Gold leaf was applied to Athena's helmet, shield and to the tip of the spear. History of the series From 1936 to 1953, Middle Tennessee dominated the series winning eight consecutive matchups. In those early years, the games were generally lopsided as Middle Tennessee shutout Troy in five of the eight wins. Troy earned its first win when the series renewed in 1999. In a stretch from 2006 to 2011, Troy had won six straight and seven of the past eight meetings. The last game was played in 2020, with Troy winning 47-14. Middle Tennessee currently leads the all-time series 12‚Äì9. As of 2020, Troy has won eight of the last ten games, only losing in 2005 and 2012. The most memorable game in the rivalry came in 2006. With Middle Tennessee undefeated in conference play on the final day of the regular season and Troy hoping to beat the Blue Raiders to gain a share of the conference championship, the Trojans scored 14 points in the final 2:19 to win 21‚Äì20 in what has been called the Miracle in Murfreesboro. Middle Tennessee appeared to have throttled the Trojans high-powered offense for the entire game and led comfortably when Troy took possession with just over two minutes left. However, Troy scored a quick touchdown followed by a successful onside kick. Troy then scored the game clinching touchdown with seconds remaining preventing Middle Tennessee from winning its first outright Sun Belt Championship. Troy and Middle Tennessee shared the conference championship, but it was Troy who went on to the New Orleans Bowl. Middle Tennessee was selected for the Motor City Bowl.

For more than thirty years he was the sub-prior of Downside Abbey in Somerset and was also a visiting professor in theology at Brown University. Early life Born at Salisbury in 1907, Trethowan was the son of William James Trethowan, a solicitor, by his marriage to Emma Louisa Van Kempen. He was baptised in the Church of England as \\"William Kenneth\\" and educated at Felsted School and Brasenose College, Oxford. While at Oxford he contracted poliomyelitis and was left with a withered arm. Career In 1929 Trethowan was received into the Roman Catholic Church and took a job as a schoolmaster at the Oratory School, London, later transferring to Ampleforth. He became a novice monk at Downside Abbey in 1932 and the same year was 'clothed' a monk under the name of Dom Illtyd. In 1933, he was ordained a priest and from then on taught philosophy to junior monks in the monastery. From 1936 to 1982, he also taught classics and later English literature at Downside, a boarding school for boys attached to the monastery. He served as sub-prior of Downside Abbey between 1958 and 1991 and, when he retired, was given the honorary title of \\"Cathedral Prior of Ely\\".Luke Bell, OSB, Obituary: Dom Illtyd Trethowan in The Independent dated 10 November 1993 He was also a visiting professor in theology at Brown University.Illtyd Trethowan, Awareness of God, at leaderu.com Trethowan died at Bath, Somerset, on 30 October 1993, having said shortly before that he was happy to die. In an obituary, The Independent said of him Author Trethowan was the author of several religious books and many learned articles, translations and book reviews. He edited Walter Hilton's The Scale of Perfection and, from 1946 to 1952 and again from 1960 to 1964, he edited the Downside Review. A fearless thinker, he argued the centrality of contemplation and also that philosophical certainty about God was possible. He also worked to gain a greater audience for some less well known writers, including Maurice Blondel and Dominique Dubarle. For philosophical inspiration he looked to Augustine.Catholic Theology in Britain: the Scene since Vatican II, note 30, at christendom-awake.org For over twenty years, he was in dialogue with Eric Mascall, with whose work Louis Bouyer draws comparisons, calling Trethowan \\"a born Augustinian, but of exceptional intellectual acuity\\".Louis Bouyer, The invisible Father: approaches to the mystery of the divinity, p. 80 online at books.google.com In Awareness of God, Trethowan writes In Absolute Value, Trethowan asserts that an awareness of moral obligations is an awareness of God.Absolute Value (1970), p. 84 He later expanded on this: Published works (selected)=Major publications *1948: Certainty, Philosophical and Theological (Dacre Press) *1952: Christ in the Liturgy (Sheed and Ward) *1953: The Meaning of Existence: a metaphysical enquiry (London: Longmans, Green) (with Dom Mark Pontifex) *1954: An Essay in Christian Philosophy (Longmans, Green) *1961: The Basis of Belief: an essay in the philosophy of religion (Burns & Oates) *1970: Absolute Value: a study in Christian theism (Allen & Unwin; Humanities Press) *1971: The Absolute and the Atonement (Allen and Unwin; Humanities Press) *1975: Mysticism and Theology-‚Äîan essay in Christian metaphysics (G.

After seeing a New Jersey revival of Porgy and Bess in 1941, he encouraged producer Cheryl Crawford to bring the show back to Broadway in a second run that doubled the length of its failed 1935 Broadway debut, and helped earn the play \\"its landmark place in theater history\\". He served in the United States Army during World War II, stationed on Okinawa as a reporter for Stars and Stripes. William Shawn of The New Yorker tried to hire Watt for the New Yorker in 1945 however Watt was unwilling to give up his beat as a newspaper theater critic and Shawn gave him a column at the New Yorker as a music critic. In 1971 a favorable review from Watt of Jesus Christ Superstar helped director Andrew Lloyd Webber overcome a negative review from The New York Times and led the play to a lengthy run.Moritz, Owen. \\"News Broadway critic, composer Douglas Watt dead at 95\\", Daily News, October 1, 2009.

Watt not only covered Broadway, he was also a pianist and songwriter whose songs \\"After All These Years\\" and \\"Heaven Help Me\\" were recorded by Doris Day and Frankie Laine. He also worked with Duke Ellington on a play adapted from George Bernard Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra. He was friends with composers Frank Loesser, Richard Rodgers and Kurt Weill, and helped spur the careers of Eugene O'Neill and Tennessee Williams. During his career at the Daily News, he was able to attend the 1949 debut of Death of a Salesman starring Lee J. Cobb in the title role of Willy Loman, as well as the 50th-anniversary production of the play with Brian Dennehy in the lead.

What makes a job so- called recession-proof is society's perpetual need and heavy demand for the service related jobs.

Appointed Chief of the Name by Elizabeth I. Included in the 1585 Composition of Connacht. Annalistic references * M1560.7. The Earl of Thomond marched into West Connaught against Murrough-na-dtuath, the son of Teige, son of Murrough, son of Rory O'Flaherty. He passed into the country of the Joyces, by Fuathach, by Bon-an-Bhonnain. The inhabitants of the town of Galway came to defend the ford of Tir-Oilein against him, but he crossed it with the good- will of some, and in despite of others, and marched through the plain of Clanrickard, both when going and returning. * M1572.9. A proclamation was issued by the President of the province of Connaught, Sir Edward Phiton, about the festival of St. Patrick, respecting a court to be held at Galway of all those who were under the authority of the Queen, from Limerick to Sligo. At this summons came the Earl of Clanrickard and his sons, Ulick and John, with the chiefs of their people; the descendants of Richard Oge Burke; the Lower Mac William, i.e. John Burke, the son of Oliver, son of John, together with the Lower Burkes; and the Dal-Cais, with their adherents. Upon their arrival before the President in Galway, the two sons of the Earl of Clanrickard, Ulick and John, heard some rumour, on account of which they dreaded the President, and privily fled from the town. When the President heard of this fact, he made prisoners of the chieftains of Clanrickard, and left them in durance in the town; and he himself, with the Earl (the father of the two already referred to, whom he had arrested), proceeded to Athlone, and from thence to Dublin, where he left the Earl, and (then) he himself returned again to Athlone. As soon as the sons of the Earl heard of that affair, they ordered the soldiers and mercenaries of the neighbouring territories to repair to them without delay. That summons was promptly responded to by the Clann-Sweeny of Upper and Lower Connaught, and by the Clann-Donnell Galloglagh (who had many hundreds of Scots along with them). Before however they had time to assemble together, the President took his forces and soldiers with him to Galway, and carried with him the ordnance and rising-out of that town to Achadh-na-n-iubhar, the castle of the sons of Donnell O'Flaherty; and it was Murrough-na-dtuagh, the son of Teige O'Flaherty, that induced him to go on this expedition. Two of the sons of Donnell O'Flaherty were left about i.e. in care of the castle. The President, after having half destroyed the castle, took complete possession of it, and left such part of it as remained undestroyed to Murrough-na-dtuagh O'Flaherty. He then returned to Galway, and passed through Clanrickard and Hy- Many to Athlone, without receiving battle or opposition.

It is known from a number of isolated jaws and molars which show that its molars were almost identical to those of the living Lundomys. On the other hand, the animal possesses a number of derived traits of the palate which document a closer relationship to living Holochilus, the genus of South American marsh rats, and for this reason it was placed in the genus Holochilus when it was first described in 1996. The subsequent discoveries of Noronhomys and Carletonomys, which may be more closely related to extant Holochilus than H. primigenus is, have cast its placement in Holochilus into doubt, and it was ultimately made the type species of a separate genus, Reigomys.  Taxonomy  Material of Reigomys primigenus was collected in 1924 and 1927 by Elmer Riggs of the Field Museum of Natural History, but the animal was not described until 1996, when Scott Steppan formally named it as a new species of the genus Holochilus and diagnosed it, contrasting it to related species.Steppan, 1996, p. 523 The material Riggs collected includes nine mandibles, three maxillae, and five isolated molars. The specific name Steppan gave to the animal, primigenus, means \\"primitive\\" in Latin and refers to the primitive features of the animal when compared to its relatives Holochilus and Lundomys.Steppan, 1996, p. 524 In order to determine the relationships of his new species, Steppan carried out a cladistic analysis, in which he also included the oryzomyines Holochilus, Lundomys, Pseudoryzomys, and Cerradomys, as well as the non- oryzomyine Sigmodon.Steppan, 1996, table 2; Weksler et al., 2006, for nomenclature His results supported a close relation between R. primigenus and extant Holochilus, with Lundomys and Pseudoryzomys more distantly related.Steppan, 1996, fig. 4A In 1999, another rodent from the same group was described: Noronhomys, a recently extinct species from the Brazilian island of Fernando de Noronha. Michael Carleton and Storrs Olson, who described the animal, argued that Holochilus primigenus was probably outside the clade of Noronhomys and extant Holochilus and that H. primigenus should probably be excluded from the genus.Carleton and Olson, 1999, p. 50 When Ulyses Pardi√±as described another extinct rodent from this group, Carletonomys from the Pleistocene of Argentina, he suggested that H. primigenus should be placed in its own genus because of its mosaic of Holochilus- and Lundomys-like features.Pardi√±as, 2008, p. 1275 The phylogenetic analysis conducted by Machado et al. (2014) confirmed that living members of the genus Holochilus are more closely related to Noronhomys and Carletonomys than to H. primigenus. The authors moved H. primigenus to its own genus, which they named Reigomys.  Description  Reigomys primigenus was a large rat, though smaller than both Lundomys and living Holochilus, characterized by an S-shaped (\\"sigmodont\\") crown on the third lower molar. Features of the molars are nearly indistinguishable from those of Lundomys and include cusps located opposite each other, enamel valleys that barely reach the midline of the molars, and short mesolophs and mesolophids (accessory crests). Other notable features include a robust mandible (lower jaw) with a steeply rising coronoid process, short incisive foramina (perforations of the front part of the palate) that barely extend between the first molars, and a short bony palate that hardly extends beyonds the third molars, all of which are shared with extant species of Holochilus to the exclusion of Lundomys. Also unlike in Lundomys, there is an additional small root present at the labial (outer) side of the first upper molar. In eight specimens that could be measured, the length of the lower toothrow is 6.79 to 7.58 mm, averaging 7.28 mm; the first lower molar is 2.62 to 3.08 mm long, averaging 2.89 mm, and 1.75 to 1.93 mm broad, averaging 1.85 mm in seven measured teeth; the only preserved complete upper toothrow is 6.64 mm long; and the first upper molar is 2.63 to 2.70 mm long and 2.03 mm broad in two specimens.Steppan, 1996, table 1  Distribution and ecology  Remains of Reigomys primigenus come from several localities in river sediments of the Tarija Formation in Tarija Department, which have been paleomagnetically dated to about 0.7 to 1.0 million years ago (chrons Clr.ln to early Cln, Ensenadan South American land mammal age). Other sigmodontine rodents found there include Andinomys, Calomys, Kunsia, Nectomys, Oxymycterus, Phyllotis, and another akodontine, probably Akodon, Necromys, or a related genus. The deposits were deposited by a river and the paleoenvironment was probably a floodplain or channel. Reigomys primigenus is not known from any other localities and is considered to be extinct.Steppan, 1996, p. 527  References = Bibliography  * Carleton, M.D. and Olson, S.L. 1999.

RADION's core work primarily focuses on long-term assistance to underprivileged and marginalized communities in Asia. RADION International, headquartered in Chiang Mai, Thailand, serves communities in critical need across northern Thailand and The Philippines. As of 2018, RADION has launched its signature child protection and developments programs to serve communities in Laos in partnership with the Ministry Of Labour and Social Welfare (MLSW), Laos PDR. RADION has also been involved in short-term projects to disaster areas, like in The Philippines during Haiyan typhoon. RADION programs cover child rescue and protection, community development, disaster recovery, with the bulk of its work dedicated to aiding critically needy children and their families. Most of its donors are Singaporeans. History= Founding  RADION International was founded in 2007, starting as three-man team based in Chiang Mai. The founders of RADION had learned of the plight of some 8,900 Hmong from previous humanitarian missions and were inspired to provide aid to the critically needy among the refugees. The Hmong, who had sought asylum in Northern Thailand following the events of the regional conflicts, had fallen into extreme poverty, with children becoming a particular high-risk group. The organization has since designed most of its programs to address the needs of these children and their families, which founders say necessitate long-term efforts of some \\"20-to-40 years\\". In 2018, RADION claims to have reached as many as 7,000 direct beneficiaries in 2018 alone. RADION International's Chairman is Dr Joel Yang, and is led by Executive Director Eugene Wee, who is also one of the founders.  Initiatives  RADION runs a number of both long-term and short-term programs in Asia, with most of its efforts targeting the Hmong refugees in Northern Thailand. The strategic focus of the programs has shifted over the years, in response to the evolving needs of the beneficiaries on the ground.  STREETKIDS! Rehabilitation Shelter (STK)  An intervention and rehabilitation program for children from high-risk backgrounds (i.e. poverty, substance abuse, gangs, physical abuse/neglect). The program provides education, nutrition, healthcare, emotional support and character development for these children. Building on the success of the StreetKIDS, a second shelter was set up in Chiangmai in 2011 to accommodate the influx and education needs for the older children. In 2012, The StreetKIDS programme started to receive more high-risk and abuse cases, prompting the management to set up a rescue arm to provide direct assistance to children who were at risk of being trafficked as well as victims of abuse.  Project LIVES!  Project LIVES! is an annual humanitarian relief & awareness campaign. The campaign was first started in 2007 and sought to aid targeted communities relief items through community action. Relief aid has typically taken the form of cold wear, food items, hygiene items, and children's toys. Held yearly in Singapore, the Project LIVES! has also become a platform for inspiring action in the community, creating awareness for caring for communities.

Integrated Farm and The SHOPHOUSE! and Integrated Farm are social enterprises created to aid victims of domestic violence by providing jobs, work skills training and rehabilitation in a safe environment. The goal is to empower these womenfolk to one day attain financial independence and self-sufficiency. RADION also started the Project SHOPHOUSE, one of its earliest initiatives, to provide low-cost internet access to needy students. RADION started an integrated farm in 2009 to trial and showcase the feasibility of different farming technologies for farmers, helping them in areas of animal husbandry, agriculture, aquaculture and bio fuel development.  Community and Livelihood Development  The organisation built on the success of the farm to start off the community development program - a holistic programme to address issues of poverty, domestic violence, substance abuse and lack of healthcare among rural communities.  DEKThai Children's Weekend Education  A preventive children's weekend program, preventing underprivileged children from falling into vices of drugs and domestic violence. The program provides weekend tuition, livelihood skills training, healthcare education and nutrition to village children that come from poor backgrounds.  Village Outreach Programme (VO)  An elderly care program that provides nursing care, nutrition and emotional support to the poorest and most at-risk villagers in the community.  Community Development Program (CDP)  A two- pronged program with an advocacy arm to educate youth in an effort to break the vicious cycle of poverty, violence and drugs, and a social business arm that provides practical work-skill training and safe shelter for victims of domestic violence.  Organizational Philosophy  The organisation is founded on Christian values. According to the organization's founders, RADION's name originates from the combination of two words, \\"RADIATING\\" and \\"MISSION\\". It strongly believes in reaching oppressed and needy groups through practical actions and to be a catalyst for change within these communities.  Long-Term Developmental Model  RADION targets communities that are marginalised due to political, geographical or social constraints. The organisation promotes aid and community development through a four-prong approach, administering programs to children, young adults and the elderly. The organization is currently the only non-governmental organization serving the Hmong hill-tribe village of Khek Noi ‚Äî the largest Hmong community in Thailand.The Land Without The Concept Of A Title Deed Short-Term Humanitarian Relief RADION provides direct assistance to all rural villages within a 120 km radius of its integrated centre in Phetchabun, Thailand in the event of natural calamities or disasters that occur in the area. Humanitarian Relief/Recovery projects are short term projects targeted at channeling timely life-saving support to underserved communities in the event of natural disasters or calamities. These adhoc projects provide affected villagers with food, shelter, medical care and crisis support. Disaster Recovery projects aim to provide mid-term assistance to communities impacted by disasters through the provision of livelihood options and economic recovery. Past Projects 2007‚Äì2009 : Pioneered outreaches spanning 600 km across Thailand, providing 8900 Hmong-Lao refugees in 3 different areas with humanitarian aid. a. Phetchabun Refugee Camp (8200 refugees) b. Nong Khai Detention Center (158 refugees) c. Refugee Settlement (450 refugees) Each site had different pressing needs, and as a result, outreach operations varied in scale and intensity from basic MILK! Missions (children nutrition augmentation missions), FRUITS! Mission (family food augmentation mission) to first-aid training. Jan 2009 : Disaster Relief & Medical Support RADION International responded when the Thai government called for additional support during the sudden cold snap in 2009. RADION International provided medical assistance to 8 villages within a 120 km radius from RADION's field office in Phetchabun. Nov 2013 - Jan 2014 : Disaster Relief For Super Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) RADION was amongst the first to respond after Super Typhoon Haiyan hit the Philippines in Nov 2013. The disaster response team spearheaded missions into Capiz Province that had been devastated by the typhoon but neglected by other aid agencies. The relief effort is currently still ongoing with volunteer teams providing medical care, relief items and establishing development initiatives to assist and restore affected communities.  Impact and Accolades  The STREETKIDS! programme saw a 66% rehabilitation success rate for juvenile drug users on the programme. RADION's community development initiatives and successful collaboration with local leaders brought juvenile substance use down from 25% to 11.9%. The effort was recognized by the Social Development Office, Royal Thai Embassy and RADION was awarded Outstanding Brands by BrandAlliance.

Taylor in the Second Empire style. History The plot of land where the Berwick Hotel was built was bought by Joseph Taylor in 1866. He built his house on the site and lived there until the 1880s when he moved into his Queen Anne style house on the other side of town. The old house was torn down to make room for the larger structure covering the entire lot. Taylor chose the name Berwick from his bride's hometown of North Berwick, Maine.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 550. The hotel opened to much celebration on August 16, 1887; it was a Romanesque Revival building. In November 1891, the hotel was destroyed by fire, but Taylor quickly arranged for the erection of a replacement. At the time, Cambridge was in the middle of a period of prosperity that had continued with little interruption since the first railroad came in the 1850s. Because the hotel sits on a sloped lot, it is irregular in its plan: parts of the building are four stories tall, while others are only three. In 1983, the hotel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its place in local history. It is located within a National Register-listed historic district: the Wheeling Avenue Historic District, designated in 1987, which extends along Wheeling Avenue from Fourth Street to Tenth Street.

A voltmeter or ammeter is attached to the sample, and a heat source, such as a soldering iron, is placed on one of the leads. The heat source will cause charge carriers (electrons in an n-type, electron holes in a p-type) to move away from the lead. The heat from the probe creates an increased number of higher energy carriers which then diffuse away from the contact point. This will cause a current/voltage difference. For example, if the heat source is placed on the positive lead of a voltmeter attached to an n-type semiconductor, a positive voltage reading will result as the area around the heat source/positive lead becomes positively charged.A simple explanation for experiment is that the thermally excited majority free charged carriers are translated with in the semiconductor form the hot probe to be he cold probe. The mechanism for this motion with in semiconductor is of a diffusion type since the material is uniformly doped.

The Pacific Island Leaders Meeting was established by Japan in 1997 in order to facilitate and strengthen relations with the leaders of the nations of the Pacific Islands Forum. Since its foundation, PALM has become an important venue of dialogue between Japan and Pacific Island nations for important issues such as development aid and climate change. PALM meetings There have been five PALM meetings since the forum's founding - 1997, 2000, 2003, 2006 and 2009. The first meeting took place in Tokyo in 1997, while the most recent forum met in Hokkaido, Japan in May 2009. PALM 4 At the meeting of the fourth forum Pacific Island Leaders Meeting (PALM 4) in 2006, Japanese and Pacific leaders adopted the Okinawa Partnership. Under the Okinawa Partnership, Japan agreed to increase its commitment to the development of Pacific Island Forum countries. PALM 5 The 5th forum of the Pacific Island Leaders Meeting (PALM 5) took place between May 22‚Äì23, 2009, in Hokkaido. The meeting was jointly co-chaired by then Prime Minister of Japan Taro Aso and the Premier of Niue Toke Talagi, who was also the chairman of the Pacific Islands Forum at the time. The 2009 PALM summit was divided into three main themes or objectives. * The first theme was entitled, \\"Eco-friendly: creating a Pacific Environmental Community,\\" which addressed the issues concerning the environment and climate change. * The second theme was called \\"Rich: Overcoming vulnerabilities and promoting human security.\\" This objective discussed what are known as human security issues, including health, water supply, and education in the small island states of the Pacific. The main focus of this discussion was to build the capacity of these resources. Japan planned to discuss its efforts to alleviate the impact of the Global financial crisis of 2008‚Äì2009 on the Pacific island nations. * The third theme was called \\"We are Islanders: People to People exchange.\\" This theme's objective was to strengthen cultural exchanges of people between Japan and the Pacific Islands in a way that would benefit both sides strategically. Fiji, which is under a military dictatorship, was invited to the 2009 PALM forum. However, Commander Frank Bainimarama, the leader of the 2006 coup, was not invited to the meeting.

It is preferred for relatively small waste loads, where lower operating efficiency is offset by mechanical simplicity. Conventional sewage treatment Mechanized sewage treatment typically includes settling in a primary clarifier, followed by biological treatment and a secondary clarifier. Both clarifiers produce waste sludge requiring sewage sludge treatment and disposal. Activated sludge agitates a portion of the secondary clarifier sludge in the primary clarifier effluent. Remaining secondary sludge and all primary sludge typically require digestion prior to disposal. Process modification Extended aeration agitates all incoming waste in the sludge from a single clarifier. The combined sludge starts with a higher concentration of inert solids than typical secondary sludge and the longer mixing time required for digestion of primary solids in addition to dissolved organics produces aged sludge requiring greater mixing energy input per unit of waste oxidized. Applications Extended aeration is typically used in prefabricated \\"package plants\\" intended to minimize design costs for waste disposal from small communities, tourist facilities, or schools. In comparison to traditional activated sludge, longer mixing time with aged sludge offers a stable biological ecosystem better adapted for effectively treating waste load fluctuations from variable occupancy situations. Supplemental feeding with something like sugar is sometimes used to sustain sludge microbial populations during periods of low occupancy; but population response to variable food characteristics is unpredictable, and supplemental feeding increases waste sludge volumes. Sludge may be periodically removed by septic tank pumping trucks as sludge volume approaches storage capacity.

Returning to private ownership following the war, the vessel sank in a hurricane in 1950. Description Sabalo had a gross register tonnage (GRT) of 204. The vessel was long overall with a beam of and a draft of . The ship had a speed of and in U.S. Navy service was equipped with two 3-pounder guns and machine guns. In U.S. service Sabalo had a complement of 12. Service history=Construction and US Navy career Sabalo was built as a civilian motor yacht in 1916 by George Lawley and Sons at Neponset, Massachusetts for W. Earl Dodge of New York City, a local financier. The U.S. Navy acquired her from her owner for $25,230 on 11 May 1917 for World War I service as a patrol vessel. She was commissioned on 20 July 1917 as USS Sabalo (SP-225). Assigned to the 3rd Naval District, Sabalo operated in the New York Harbor area on section patrol duty for the remainder of World War I. On 1 October 1917, she joined the patrol vessel in coming to the assistance of the sinking patrol vessel USS Mohawk, which had collided with the British tanker off Sandy Hook, New Jersey, and she and Mohican rescued all 77 members of Mohawks crew. Sabalo was decommissioned on 3 March 1919 and returned to Dodge the same day. Interwar Dodge kept Sabalo in use as a pleasure yacht until 1921, when he sold her to Van Lear Black of Baltimore, Maryland. Franklin Roosevelt piloted the yacht as a guest of Black. Black fell to his death off the aft deck in 1930. Black's estate in turn sold her in 1931 to the Albert Pack Corporation of Chicago, Illinois, which renamed her Breezin' Thru. In 1937, Leila Y. Post Montgomery of Battle Creek, Michigan, bought Breezin' Thru. Royal Canadian Navy and postwar service  HMCS Cougar sometime between 1940 and 1945. After failing to acquire any British vessels at the beginning of World War II for auxiliary purposes, the Royal Canadian Navy discreetly searched the American market for suitable ships. However, American law prevented the sale of ships for possible use in the war to any of the belligerents. The Royal Canadian Navy requisitioned unsuitable Canadian yachts and had their respective owners go the United States and buy those ships the Navy wanted as replacements. Once the ships arrived in Canada, the navy then returned the original yachts and requisitioned the new ones. The Royal Canadian Navy acquired Breezin' Thru in 1940 after she was purchased by Clarence Wallace, the president of Burrard Dry Dock. Breezin Thru had not been Wallace's designated target vessel in the United States, but the shipbroker suggested the yacht after the Royal Canadian Navy's selection was found to be in a poor state. Once the vessel had arrived on the West Coast of Canada, Wallace used the vessel himself for a couple of weeks to maintain the illusion that Breezin Thru had not been purchased for military purposes. She was rearmed with one 6-pounder gun at the bow. The ship was renamed Cougar and commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 11 September 1940 with the pennant number Z 15. In Canadian service, the vessel had a complement of 5 officers and 35 crew. After commissioning, Cougar had a quiet career on the west coast, initially placed on antisubmarine patrol out of Esquimalt, British Columbia. In May 1942 she was transferred to Prince Rupert Force, based at Prince Rupert, British Columbia. She returned to Esquimalt in June 1944, where she served as an examination vessel. The vessel was paid off on 23 November 1945 and sold to American interests in 1946. HMCS Cougar in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, ca. December 1940. Once again named Breezin' Thru, she operated as a pleasure yacht until sunk during a hurricane at Kingston, Jamaica, in September 1950.

The town is the administrative center of the LGA. The town was once the capital of the Biu kingdom, and is now capital of the Biu Emirate. Biu lies on the Biu Plateau at an average elevation of 626 meters. The region is semi-arid. History The name of Biu was initially called Viu which in Babur and Bura Language means high. The Biu kingdom became established around 1670 in the reign of Mari Watila Tampta. King Mari Watirwa (r. 1793‚Äì1838), whose capital was near Biu at Kogu, defeated Fulani invaders from the Gombe Emirate to the west. In 1878 Mari Biya, became the first Babur king to rule from Biu. The emir's palace is now situated in the town. With British rule, Biu division was created in 1918. Mai Ari Dogo was acknowledged as the first emir of Biu in 1920. The area became known as the Biu federation after 1957, when the districts of Shani and Askira were added to the emirate. Maidalla Mustafa dan Muhammad (b. 1915) became Mai Biu, also styled Kuthli, in 1959.

Using Grove's clean language, a progressive questioning technique using clients' exact words, the facilitator works with a client's self-generating metaphors to clarify personal beliefs, goals, and conflicts, and to bring about meaningful change. Because of its reliance on emergence and self-organization it has been called a \\"post-modern oriented therapeutic approach\\".Nehyba & Lanc 2013 Background The practice of symbolic modeling is built upon a foundation of two complementary theories: the metaphors by which we live,Lakoff & Johnson, 1980 and the models by which we create. It regards the individual as a self-organizing system that encodes much of the meaning of feelings, thoughts, beliefs, experiences etc. in the embodied mind as metaphors. Lawley & Tompkins, 2000 Symbolic modeling aims to heighten awareness of clients' personal \\"symbolic domain of experience\\", facilitating them to develop a unique \\"metaphor landscape\\" and to explore their internal metaphors, which in conceptual metaphor theory are seen to govern behavior. Needham-Didsbury, 2012 Intent The symbolic modeling process guides the client through an exploration of the client's own metaphors, their organization, interactions, and patterns. These embodied metaphors can restrict a client's ways of viewing the world and his or her coping strategies, due to the inner logic prescribed by the metaphors. Without shifting these metaphors, lasting change may be difficult, as the embodied mind may continue to work within the constraints of this old paradigm. Through the facilitation, the client can discover how these metaphors can change to meet their desired outcomes, transformative shifts can occur within a client's \\"metaphor landscape\\", bringing about meaningful change on cognitive, affective and behavioral levels. The \\"metaphor landscape\\" phenomenon is not a new discovery, with some similarities to \\"waking dream\\" or r√™ve ev√©ill√©, a term coined by Robert Desoille in the 1930s. Martin, 2007 Process Symbolic modeling proceeds through five defined stages, as follows: *Stage 1: Entering the symbolic domain *Stage 2: Developing symbolic perceptions *Stage 3: Modeling symbolic patterns *Stage 4: Encouraging transformation *Stage 5: Maturing the evolved landscape Clean language is used throughout, to avoid contaminating or distorting the developing metaphor landscape through the form, content or presentation of the therapist's questions.Lawley & Tompkins, 2000 A more structured subset of the above process called symbolic modeling lite is used in coaching:Lawley & Tompkins, 2011 *Phase 1: Set up *Phase 2: Identify a desired outcome *Phase 3: Develop a desired outcome landscape *Phase 4: Explore effects of desired outcome landscape *Phase 5: Mature changes as they occur *Phase 6: Set down Evidence base A number of studies have assessed the efficacy of symbolic modeling with 95 dyslexic coachees;Doyle & McDowall, 2015 in a psychotherapy case study;Rees & Manea, 2016 and in an organisational setting.Robinson, 2012/2013 Other applications While therapy and coaching are the primary application areas of symbolic modeling, researchers have started to apply the method to metaphor research,Akbari, 2013 game design, Rusch, 2017, problem solving,Groppel- Wegener, 2015 and as a qualitative research methodology.van Helsdingen & Lawley, 2012Tosey et al., 2014 NotesReferences * Akbari, M.

Construction  Shady Side was built in 1873 at Bulls Ferry. She was described in later service as \\"one of the handsomest passenger-boats on Long Island Sound\\", and in reminiscences from 1939 as \\"a remarkably swift and handsome steamboat of medium size\\". She had a licensed capacity of 600 passengers in 1880, and 700 in 1899. Shady Side's engines were made by Fletcher, Harrison and Company. Her wooden hull was long, with a beam breadth of , a hold depth of . Her gross tonnage was 444 and her net tonnage 329.  Service  Stamford, A Souvenir\\" (1892) published by the Gillespie Brothers Originally, Shady Side was owned by the Morrisania Steamboat Company, and ran passengers to upper Manhattan and the Bronx by way of the East River. Later the vessel was used on routes to Stamford, Connecticut and Fort Lee, New Jersey, with stops at Shady-Side, Guttenberg, and Tilly Toodlum. Her final trip to Harlem was made on July 4, 1880, after the new elevated railroad made route uneconomical. From the beginning, Shady Side was involved in stern competition with vessels of other companies. The Shady Side was the fastest boat of the Morrisania Steamboat Company, and frequently raced against the Sylvan Dell, which was the fastest of the Harlem Line. In 1875, as part of this sparring, the Sylvan Dell had a piece of oak strapped to her to prevent Shady Side easily passing. Captain Longstreet, superintendent of the Morrisania line, took control of Shady Side in response one morning in April 1875 and swung her around in such a way as to knock the beam off Sylvan Dell. This caused cheering from passengers on Shady Side but was condemned as dangerous horseplay by The New York Times. Later that month, Captain Longstreet's license was revoked for thirty days as a result, and the captains of both the Shady Side and Sylvan Dell‚ÄîCharles G. Tennant and William Weatherwax, respectively‚Äîwere censured, Tennant for remaining at the helm while Longstreet took over and Weatherwax for continuing to operate the Sylvan Dell after complaints had been raised about the beam. In 1881, it was reported in The New York Times that the police intended to buy her for the 24th precinct, and that \\"she cost $83,000, was sold to the steam-boat company for $58,000, and the amount now ask for her is $38,000. It will cost about $3,500 to fit her up, and the Police flag can be transferred to her in the early Spring.\\" The mortgage on Shady Side was foreclosed on in 1881, but she continued in service as a passenger vessel after being sold. In 1882, Shady Side was making regular trips between Pier 3, North River and Tompkinsville, Staten Island, at half the price ‚Äì five cents ‚Äì of the regular ferry. The Staten Island Ferry Company complained about the under-cutting and it was found that Shady Side was being operated without a ferry license. The case went to the New York Supreme Court, which ruled against the boat's operators and enjoined them from running that route, an injunction that was re-ratified in July. In August 1882, Shady Side was again undercutting fares on a different route, between New York and Yonkers, again charging five cents against a standard fare of twenty cents for a single ticket. The two firms that ran the Chrysteneh, the Riverdale and the Caroline A. Peene began blocking docks that the Shady Side wanted to use and casting away her lines. There were reports of passengers being assaulted, and at one point a fence and a locked gate were erected to block access to the Shady Side, over which passengers clambered. The other operators believed Shady Side must be running at a great loss and would not be able to continue, while the operator of the Shady Side, Walter H. Shupe, manager of the Columbia Line, said they were acting within their rights and that they had taken the matter to the Yonkers Police Court. It was reported in several papers that this strategy was so popular that in September Shady Side's owners hired a larger boat, the Americus, which had a capacity of 1,500 passengers, to keep up with demand, and that the Americus was owned by a secret society numbering 800,000 members called the \\"Sons of Columbia\\", who chartered the Americus for sixty days at $160 per day. In June 1883, Shady Side had been working on the Delaware River between Wilmington and Philadelphia, running a loss, when the captain took her from the wharf. A 'wanted' notice was run on the front page of The New York Times on the assumption she had been taken to New York. In later service, either from 1886 or 1902, Shady Side took passengers between New York and Stamford, Connecticut, which she continued to do until at least 1910 and perhaps 1921.  Accidents in fog  The Shady Side was involved in two incidents due to fog in which another ship was damaged, causing one and assisting in the other. In the first incident, in mid-March 1875, Shady Side struck and sank a tug boat called Mary, which was backing out of a slip between piers on the East River near Corlears Hook. George F. Townsend sued as a result and was awarded damages in May of the next year, Judge Blatchford finding that the tug was blameless and not outside the end of Jackson Street pier, whereas Shady Side was moving too fast given the fog. On the morning of October 21, 1894, in very heavy fog, at least four ships ran aground in New York. Of these, the largest was the wooden side-wheel steamer Drew, carrying 150 passengers, which ran aground on Washington Point at about 7:40 a.m., tearing a hole in the starboard bow. Passengers were able to disembark by gangplank and when the tide rose, it was Shady Side that was towed Drew off the rocks and back to dock.  Later years  Around 1921, Shady Side came into the ownership of Marcus Garvey, running under the Black Star Line. Shady Side was abandoned on the mud flats at Fort Lee, New Jersey in 1922 when the Black Star Line collapsed as its owners were convicted of mail fraud.  Later vessels  Another ship called the Shady Side was built in 1913 at Osborn Boat Works for Edenton Ferries, while the steamboat was still in operation. That vessel, which was unrelated, was sold to the United States Navy in 1918, designated SP-2079 and assigned to ferry service. It was redesignated YFB-2079 in 1920 and sank in a storm in 1925, being declared unfit for service after being raised.

The Center's programs and resources have been developed to advance the study of homeland security research, scholarship, and professional discipline to enhance U.S. national security and safety. The Center offers a Master of Arts degree in Security Studies (Homeland Security and Defense), an Executive Leaders Program, Executive Education Seminars, the University and Agency Partnership Initiative, and self-study courses. Resources include the Homeland Security Digital Library and Homeland Security Affairs, an on open- source academic journal. History The events of September 11th, 2001 revealed that new homeland security issues and threats were facing the United States. There was a need for educational programs for homeland security professionals who could prevent, plan for, respond to, and lead recovery efforts from terrorist events occurring within the U.S. The Naval Postgraduate School Center for Homeland Defense and Security was created by Congress, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the U.S. Department of Defense in April 2002 to implement this educational role. The first master's degree classes began in January 2003. The CHDS created educational programs to: * Educate and prepare local, state, tribal, and federal homeland security leaders * Develop new policies, strategies, and organizational arrangements to prevent and respond to future terrorist or catastrophic events * Define the emerging discipline of homeland security and the curriculum components of graduate and executive‚Äêlevel homeland security education * Promote and encourage homeland security collaboration across professional disciplines and all levels of government * Facilitate the development of a national homeland security education system by using an open-source model to develop programs, curriculum, and educational tools * Share educational resources with other academic institutions and agencies to expedite the development of homeland security programs nationwide. Programs and Resources The programs and resources of the CHDS improve domestic safety and defense by promoting the study of homeland security as a field of research, scholarship, and professional discipline. There are several types and levels of homeland security education programs offered by the Center, including a master's degree program, seminars, a digital library, self-study courses, an online journal, and podcasts. The Masters Program The CHDS Master's Program offers a Master of Arts degree in Security Studies (Homeland Security and Defense) awarded by the Naval Postgraduate School. Candidates for this degree are local, state, tribal, federal, and military homeland security professionals and officials. Courses are taught through a combination of short but intensive in-residence sessions, and network-based learning. This program gives homeland security leaders the knowledge and skill to develop strategies, plans, and programs that reduce national vulnerability to terrorist and catastrophic events. Students learn organizational and management skills, development of interagency cooperation, and actionable policy and strategy. Students‚Äô thesis research benefits their home states or agencies. Some theses have been implemented at the national level. The Executive Leaders Program The Executive Leaders Program (ELP) has been developed from the CHDS master's degree curricula. Participants study key homeland security topics and issues while building working relationships and networks across local, state, tribal, federal, and jurisdictional lines. This program was designed to accommodate the busy schedules of executives. It is conducted in four one-week in- residence sessions which take place over nine months. As the ELP is a certificate program, it does not require the intensive workload typical of graduate-level degree programs. Pacific Executive Leaders Program The Pacific Executive Leaders Program (Pacific ELP), a graduate level education curriculum, to address specific challenges facing officials in these unique areas. This course is intended for mid- and senior-level homeland security professionals as an opportunity to develop the strategies, policies and organizational elements they need to better understand and address emerging regional security issues, public policy debates, terrorist threats and best practices in homeland security. Fusion Center Leaders Program The Fusion Center Leaders Program (FCLP) is built upon guidance from the National Fusion Center Management Group comprising state and local partners, Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and Department of Justice (DOJ). This graduate level course examines key questions and issues facing fusion center leaders and their roles in homeland security, public safety, and the Information Sharing Environment (ISE). The course is shaped to enhance critical thinking related to homeland security and public safety intelligence issues at the local, state, territorial, tribal and federallevels of government and in the private sector. Executive Education Seminars The Executive Education Seminars (EES) re half-day seminars which help senior-level state and local officials identify and plan for their locale's specific homeland security threats. Customized and conducted at the locality by Mobile Education Teams (MET), these seminars enhance leadership development, communication, and knowledge at all levels of local, state, and federal governments and agencies. Strategic planning, policy development, and organizational design are discussed. Multimedia briefings and news stories create the context for these facilitated, non-attributive roundtable discussions. The University and Agency Partnership Initiative The University and Agency Partnership Initiative (UAPI) expands and develops homeland security education nationwide. Partner institutions and agencies around the country are provided with the CHDS curriculum, web-based learning technology, access to the Homeland Security Digital Library, and other CHDS educational resources. All educational materials and resources are provided at no cost to UAPI partners. In return, partners share their curricula and specialized expertise with CHDS and the other UAPI partners. The multiplier effect of this program increases the number of students with access to homeland security education programs nationwide. Self-study Courses CHDS offers online, non-credit self-study courses in targeted homeland security topics to students, educators, and government officials. These courses are developed by the CHDS faculty from the Center's homeland security master's degree curriculum. Offered at no cost, these courses are designed for homeland defense and security professionals who want to learn more about their field and require the flexibility of self-paced instruction. NPS does not provide credit for these courses, however, participants may download a record of completion. The Homeland Security Digital Library File:Hsdllogo-1-.jpg The Homeland Security Digital Library (HSDL) is the nation's foremost collection of documents and resources related to homeland security. The library assists homeland security professionals, researchers, and academics of all disciplines with homeland security research and information. Library access is offered to U.S. citizens who are federal, state, tribal, and local U.S. government officials; members of the U.S. military; homeland security researchers and academics; or security staff protecting organizations vital to U.S. infrastructure. Resources are collected from a wide variety of sources and are selected and evaluated by a team of librarians and subject-matter specialists before inclusion in the library. Documents are open-source and are published by federal, state, tribal, and local government agencies; professional organizations; think tanks; academic institutions; and international governing bodies. Websites, maps, and other types of resources are also available at the HSDL. Access to most of the HSDL collection requires a password protected account or organizational access (military installations; federal, territorial, tribal, state and local government agencies; and research institutions (including a number of colleges and universities), but the HSDL ‚ÄúOn The Homefront‚Äù blog, a customized search of select homeland security blogs, a resource page for grants, a list of homeland security books and journal sources, and a Twitter alert for newly published reports, as well as other resources are open-source and available to the general public. Homeland Security Affairs Homeland Security Affairs (HSA) is the online journal of the CHDS. It provides a forum to propose and debate strategies, policies, and organizational arrangements to strengthen U.S. homeland security. Contributors to Homeland Security Affairs represent top subject matter experts and practitioners in the field of homeland security and include instructors, alumni, participants in CHDS programs, and partners of CHDS. This peer-reviewed academic journal captures the best of their collective work, as well as that of scholars and practitioners throughout the nation. Homeland Security Affairs accepts submissions of original research articles, short-form articles and essays, and media reviews.

Early life Forrest was born in Falkirk, Scotland on 13 March 1873. He went to Kilmarnock Academy. On leaving school, he was apprenticed with a local chemist until 1891 when, on the inheritance of a small legacy, he decided to travel to Australia,Charles Adams, Mike Early, Jane Brook and Katherine Bamford where he searched for gold and also worked on a sheep station before returning to Scotland in 1902. Forrest's life then took a most unexpected turn; caught in a shower while fishing the Gladhouse Loch in Tweedsdale, he sought shelter beneath an overhanging bank where he chanced upon an ancient stone coffin. The discovery led to his introduction to Professor Bayley Balfour, Regius Keeper of the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh, who offered him a job in the Herbarium. Whilst Forrest doubtless found the indoor work dull, it was to provide an excellent preparation for his explorations. A year later, Balfour recommended Forrest, now aged 30, to Liverpool horticulturist and cotton broker Arthur Kilpin Bulley, who was sponsoring an expedition to southwestern China in search of exotic plants, particularly species of rhododendron, of which Yunnan has many.Lyte, C. (1983). The Plant Hunters. Orbis Publishing, London. Julia Brittain Plant collecting Forrest made his first expedition to Yunnan in 1904.Sue Gordon (Editor) In August, he arrived at the town of Talifu (Dali City). He started setting up a base of operations and began to learn the local language. He later helped with the inoculation of thousands of locals against smallpox. By the summer of 1905, he was ready to mount his first expedition to the northwest corner of Yunnan near the border with Tibet. He and his team of 17 local collectors stayed briefly at the French mission under P√®re √âtienne-Jules Dubernard in the small town of Tzekou. Forrest and his team then collected numerous plants, herbarium specimens and seeds. In the sanctuary of the rhododendron forests, so rich in variety of flora and fauna, the group was unaware of the massacre that was to meet them on their return to the mission, and that only one would survive. As one source puts it \\"This first trip was both exciting and horrifying.\\" Foreigners had been targeted for death by the local Tibetan Buddhist lamas, during the 1905 Tibetan Rebellion. Forrest had a narrow escape, but this did not discourage him from returning to Yunnan. The Lamas pursued him until a Naxi \\"King\\" named Lee rescued him. He witnessed atrocities committed by the Lamas during the rebellion. He eventually became perhaps the foremost collector of Yunnan flora, amassing hundreds of species of rhododendron, and other shrubs and perennials. He was honoured with the Royal Horticultural Society's Victoria Medal of Honour in 1921, and the Veitch Memorial Medal in 1927, and was elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society in 1924. Altogether, Forrest made seven trips to Yunnan, collecting samples and seeds for the Herbarium and for avid collectors willing to pay for new species to add to their collections. In total, he brought back perhaps 31,000 plant specimens. He discovered numerous species including Gentiana sino-ornata. The specific epithet forrestii now adorns more than thirty genera. Including; Rhododendron forrestii, Pieris formosa var. forrestii, Primula forrestii, Iris forrestii and Hypericum forrestii. Personal life Forrest married Clementina Traill in 1907; they had three sons. Death On 5 January 1932, while hunting game in the hills near Tengchong, the town wherein Forrest traditionally set up his base, he suffered a massive heart attack and died instantly. He was buried at Tengchong, next to his friend George Litton, who had been Acting British Consul there until his death 26 years earlier. References *McLean, B. (2004). George Forrest, Plant Hunter.

I wanted to get away from safety and walking with little steps.\\" \\\\- Hanrahan on moving to London Professional Life and Accolades  In 1960, Hanrahan began printmaking, working with her German lecturer and print master, Udo Sellbach. In 1961, Hanrahan won the Cornell Prize for painting. In 1962, she served as president of the South Australian Graphic Art Society. In 1963, at the age of 24, she left Adelaide to study at the Royal College of Art in London. She lived mostly in England until the early 1980s, with her partner, sculptor Jo Steele. Hanrahan also lectured for a time at the Falmouth in Cornwall and Portsmouth College of Art. During this time she returned periodically to Adelaide to teach at the South Australian School of Art and to organise her one-woman exhibitions, and she eventually returned there to live permanently. Her first exhibition was at the Contemporary Art Society Gallery in Adelaide in December 1964.History Trust of South Australia 'Barbara Hanrahan' retrieved 5 October 2009 Upon her return Hanrahan was also a member of the Australian Women‚Äôs Art Movement and the Australian Women's Art Register. Both organizations strived for equal pay for female artists as well as increased exposure. Hanrahan often combined writing with visual arts. She kept a diary in her late teenage years and then again in London to make sense of a strange city.http://mpegmedia.abc.net.au/rn/podcast/extra/hht_20110220_hanrahan84.mp3 She began writing her first book, The Scent of Eucalyptus, a semi- autobiographical consideration of her childhood, shortly after the death of her grandmother in 1968.Hanrahan, Barbara SA Memory Website, State Library of South Australia Retrieved 21-04-2014 The book was published in 1973. Her edited diaries were published in 1998, revealing less than favourable comments about many of her contemporaries. Although some friends and colleagues commented that it was interesting to understand how Hanrahan's brain worked. A biography by Annette Marion Stewart was published in the same year. The Barbara Hanrahan Fellowship for South Australian writers was established in Hanrahan's memory in 1994 by her partner Jo Steele. A street in Thebarton is named after her, and in 1997 a building at the University of South Australia's City West campus was named to honour her memory.  Art  Hanrahan was a painter and printmaker. Hanrahan experimented with printing styles such as screen printing, etching, relief printing, and woodblock and lino cutting. She would often revisit the same print in different styles and colours such as ‚ÄúWedding Night‚Äù, which has three variations. Hanrahan's work is personal and private yet its themes are universal. The relationships between girlfriends, women and men, and the struggle against societal structures. These themes are constantly repeated throughout her ouvre in prints, such as Wedding night (1977) and Dear Miss Ethel Barringer (1975). Both works depict Hanrahan's unease with women's roles in society. The juggling act in Dear Miss Ethel Barringer, of a woman having to play multiple roles at once. And her unease with society's outdated values, by the 60‚Äôs many women were not virgins at the time of marriage. Hanrahan's Wedding Night depicts the outdated assumption that for consummation to happen the woman must be purer. Wedding night captures the moment of unease between the couple and the lack of intimacy shown by the gap between them. ‚ÄúWedding night has shocked people since its creation by its refutation of romance of the event,‚Äù writes Alison Carrol. Hanrahan‚Äôs work is described as, exploring the ‚Äúthemes of society and its norms, its expectations and its conventions and how the individual fares therein - buffeted and withstanding, weak and strong. She particularly analyses the relationship between men and women, often through their sexuality, and, as well, the relationship of the generations. The subjects are clearly chosen, gleaned from a lifetime of careful looking, listening, reading, digesting and remembering.‚Äù Critic and art historian Alison Carroll draws parallels between the simplicity of Hanrahan scenes and David Hockney's pop art; ‚ÄúHanrahan uses Hockney, but, in her best work of the periods, she moves on considerably from him; she achieves a high emotional pitch, working with uncomfortable themes of love, family and relationships and using awkward childlike form. The process goes far beyond the easy, self-controlled world of Pop art.‚Äù Carroll implies that the simplicity in both Hanrahan and Hockney's drawings are similar. Hanrahan, however, strays from the pop art formula and creates complex feelings between the characters in her works and the viewer and the works. =Exhibitions= Hanrahan exhibited her artwork internationally, including in London, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden, Scotland, the United States and Canada.Obituaries: Hanrahan, Barbara Janice (1939-1991) Retrieved 21-04-2014 Her artwork is collected in numerous galleries in Australia including the National Gallery of Australia. Her work 'Generations' (1991) was used as the cover art for Mixed matches : interracial marriage in Australia by June Duncan Owen.

In books such as the Scent of Eucalyptus are described as breaking the suburban female mould, ‚Äúin- scribing the female sexual, reproductive and excretory body in text‚Äù. Her novels often had a main character that was similar to Hanrahan herself. Annette Stewart writes about the difficulty in being able to distinguish fact and fiction. ‚ÄúConfusion between reality and the imagination was key to barbara writing, lending it a particular and distinctive atmosphere.‚Äù Hanrahan's book, Sea Green features a narrator, Virginia and her move from Adelaide, South Australia to London. Sea Green is autobiographical, Virginia is Barbara. The book is reminiscent and nostalgic for the place where she once lived. Hanrahan's novel, Michael and Me and the Sun, documents her sexual encounters on her journey to London and the relationships she had. Again it is both fictional and autobiographical, Hanrahan using a main character similar to herself. Like Hanrahan's art, her writing was also punchy and to the point. She documented the patriarchal facts of finding a man ‚ÄúTo be popular on the ship you had to be willing to iron, and the men came along to the ironing room looking helpless.‚Äù This tension in relationships and their roles was expressed in her writings and art. = List of works = * The Scent of Eucalyptus (1973) * Sea-Green (1974) * The Albatross Muff (1977) * Where the Queens All Strayed (1978) * The Peach Groves (1980) * The Frangipani Gardens (1980) * Dove (1982) * Kewpie Doll (1984) * Annie Magdalene (1985) * Dream People (1987) * A Chelsea Girl (1987) * Flawless Jade (1989) * Iris in her Garden (1991) * Michael and Me and the Sun (1992) * Good Night Mr Moon (1992) * The Diaries of Barbara Hanrahan, edited by Elaine Lindsay (1998) Many of her papers and unpublished writings are held at the National Library of Australia.Papers of Barbara Hanrahan.

He moved to live in Milan in 1973 to study printmaking and photography at the Scuola Cova, and design with Bruno Munari at the Instituto Polit√©cnico. Zerpa was a self-taught painter, by 1974 he was creating installations and performance pieces. He returned to Venezuela in 1980, but spent two years in New York: (1982 to 1984). By 1984 he ceased performing and concentrated on making objects. His work is in many ways autobiographical. It recalls department store displays cases which serve as stages for his homages to the past. Zerpa also trained in design, photography and printmaking, paintings, drawings, sculptures, performances and installations, He exhibited internationally and won many awards. Carlos Zerpa trained in Italy, Germany, and United States; he blended kitsch with references to Giotto, van Gogh, Picasso, and Duchamp. His focus was towards historical themes in terms of spatial and temporal shifts was addressed to several Venezuelan artist one of them being Carlos Zerpa. The preoccupation with time seems especially relevant in a country whose historical development does not go back much before the eighteenth century. Carlos Zerpa and Miguel von Dangel chose as their referent the period of the discovery of the new world and just prior, through a mythology of its human and animal inhabitants primarily located in the Caribbean and the area now occupied by Venezuela. Zerpa after Christopher Columbus encountering ‚Äúnew tribes, strange animals and lush forests‚Äù Carlos capitalized these myths as well as on his grasp of Western art history, from which he appropriated liberally. Carlos Zerpa, April 22, 2012 in Caracas Influence: Carlos Zerpa series the‚Äù India Nova's‚Äù El Dorado was greatly influenced by Theodor de Bry, a Flemish designer, engraver, and printmaker. Zerpa valued de Bry's work that his most recognized series was his interpretation on acrylic painting series called ‚ÄúEl Dorado‚Äù which was based on the fanciful chronicles and records of European explorers and visually on prints by the Belgium artist. Zerpa deliberately created a secondhand visual account of an already distorted Eurocentric one by borrowing from de Bry; he perpetuated the farce by enhancing/ modifying a modern-day mythology for the new world. Zerpa did his own version of ‚ÄúEl Dorado‚Äù the de Bry's 1594 print of an Indian ruler being dusted with gold before a ritual ceremony. In Zerpa's garishly colored painting, the Indian ruler stands in a classical contrapposto while the attendants sponge him with paint and blow the gold powder onto his naked body. A dark eagle hovers menacingly above. Zerpa reversed the figures to account for the fact that the source was a printed image. The eagle in his painting substitutes for a mountain in de Bry's print. Zerpa managed to incorporate personal genuine totaling, for example by reversing the figures seeing as it was a printed image it was easily manipulated, he also replaced the mountain on de Bry's print with an eagle. There is major diversity on both de Bry's piece with Zerpa depiction of ‚ÄúEl Dorado‚Äù, but both equally respond individual. Zerpa's transformation of ‚ÄúEl Dorado‚Äù(1987;PL. 12.8), ‚ÄúThe Golden One‚Äù was a very stylistic approach with vibrant neon colors lavishing from the ground up. The totality of the golden one deems modern, pop art capturing historical events from time in an original method. Another work by Zerpa ‚ÄúAcefalo A cephalous, or (The Headless one 1987), he parodies accounts of a headless tribe with an arrow-bearing figure whose face is on his chest. In one of his typical anachronisms, Zerpa includes a barely detectable chair in the sky above the figure, appropriated from van Gogh's painting of his bedroom in Arles. Other works by the Carlos Zerpa series are, [El Dorado], [The Golden One] in the Nova series of 1987, acrylic on canvas 192x132 cm which exhibited at Caracas, Mercantil Collection. Other paintings Zerpa interprets [Acephalous, or The Headless One](1987), [This Golden Whale] (1987), [Trito, an Adam in the Tropics] (1986). Zerpa had solo exhibitions at the Museo de Arte Carillo Gil in Mexico City in 1993 and at the Museo de Bellas Artes in Caracas in 1994.

Since the coaxial cables originally used for the analog system have significant unused data spectrum available, it is a simple matter to just replace the camera and the recorder to obtain nearly seven times higher detail (1920x1080 vs 640x480) than the original camera system.

Payne is most known for building designs in the U.S. State of Texas after 1926, but before this as a member of the Ittner Firm, he designed schools and hospitals in other states. Payne was born in St. Louis, Missouri, and was trained at Washington University in St. Louis. Upon graduation, he attended Fort Sheridan Officers Training School, and served in World War I in Company H, 320th Infantry, 80th Division. On September 25‚Äì26, 1918 he fought in the Meuse-Argone Offensive, leading men of H Company to take Dead Man's Hill (Le Mort Homme). Payne received a battlefield commission to Captain just before the Armistice. He returned to St. Louis after the war to work with the Ittner form until 1926. That year he was recruited by Houston School Board to design all new schools for the city. After this contract was completed he went on to design schools, jails, office buildings, stadiums, houses and museums in Texas including for Anahuac ISD, Beaumont ISD, Corpus Christi ISD, Houston ISD, and Huntsville ISD. After December 7, 1941, Payne tried to secure the renewal of his WWI Commission as Captain, but was refused because of disabilities resulting from injuries in the First World War. He found an outlet for his desire to serve by applying at Brown Shipbuilding in Houston where he worked on the design of destroyers, frigates escorts and landing craft. The USS Stewart is one surviving example of this work. Payne was an active member of the American Institute of Architects, and was awarded the Edward C. Kemper Award by the organization in 1962.

He held the longest term of any American governor appointed over the territory by the United States Government. A Naval Academy graduate, Poyer served in numerous positions and retired in 1906 on account of failing health; however, the navy recalled him to service in 1915 to serve as governor. During the 1918 flu pandemic, Poyer quarantined the territory to stop the spread of the pandemic to American Samoa. Because of his actions, no deaths occurred in American Samoa, and he received the Navy Cross. Upon his final retirement, Poyer had reached the rank of commander. Life and career=Early life Poyer was born in Indiana in 1861.United States Civil Service Commission (1887), 473. He was appointed to the United States Naval Academy from Wisconsin in October 1879.Hamersly (1902), 216. Naval career Poyer became an ensign in February 1884, a lieutenant (junior grade) in December 1894. He was stationed to the Washington Navy Yard from 1892 to 1894, the USS Montgomery from August 1894 to 1897, the Naval War College in June 1897, back to the Washington Ship Yard from 1897 to 1898, and the USS Saint Paul.

Angered by the quarantine of ships, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Logan of the New Zealand Army, administrator of Western Samoa, cut off communications with American Samoa. For his leadership in preventing the spread of Spanish influenza, Poyer received the Navy Cross. Poyer transferred command of American Samoa to Warren Jay Terhune on June 10, 1919, ending his governorship. His term is the longest of any naval governor of American Samoa.

Quantrill raided the small Kansas town of Aubry, southwest of Kansas City, Missouri, and just west of the Kansas-Missouri border. Three residents were killed in the raid and much property was carted away by the guerrillas.William C. Pollard, Jr., \\"Forts and Military Posts in Kansas: 1854-1865\\" (Ph.D. dissertation, Faith Baptist College and Seminary, 1997), p. 8; William E. Connelley, Quantrill and the Border Wars, 1956 ed. (New York: Pageant Book Co., 1956), pp. 225-8. Quantrill's raid resulted in Aubry being garrisoned by Company E of the 8th Regiment of Kansas Volunteers. Capt. John Greelish was the first garrison commander. Aubry was garrisoned by Union troops intermittently for the rest of the Civil War. Greelish's troops arrived about March 10 and two days later won a skirmish near Aubry with about thirty of Quantrill's men. After this an additional company of troops was sent to Aubry. Maj. E. F. Schneider then took command. Later in 1862 Company D of the 11th Kansas Infantry, under command of Lt. Dick Rooks, manned the post at Aubry. Rooks was a Red leg and a Jayhawker. This company remained at Aubry through the winter of 1862-3.Connelley, pp. 234-5; Col. Robert H. Graham, report, The War of the Rebellion (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1883), Series I, Vol. VIII, pp. 335-6; Oliver H. Gregg, \\"History of Johnson County, Kansas,\\" Atlas Map of Johnson County, Kansas (Wyandotte, Kans,: E. F. Heisler & Co., 1874), p. 31. Later in 1863 troops were again sent to Aubry. The post, under the command of Capt. Joshua A. Pike, had seventy-two men, composed of two companies of cavalry. Pike was very soon to discredit himself. On the evening of August 20 Quantrill passed within sight of the post with about 400 guerrillas and Confederate Army recruits. These men were on their way to raid Lawrence, Kansas. Pike formed his men into a line of battle south of his post, but he took no action to determine the identity of Quantrill's men or to pursue them once he suspected they were guerrillas. He passed the information about the travelers to all the troops in the area, but he did not notify his superiors about them in a timely manner.Untitled letter, The Independent (Oskaloosa), August 15, 1863, p. 2; Connelley, pp. 315-6; Capt.

Thomas Ewing, report, The War of the Rebellion (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1888), Serive I, Vol. XXII, Part I, p. 580. Capt. Charles F. Coleman, in command of the post at Little Santa Fe, Missouri, marched with eighty men to Aubry. About midnight Coleman and Pike took their forces in a very belated attempt to pursue Quantrill. By this time Quantrill was so far ahead of them that the pursuers could not possibly catch him. Pike was not to remain at Aubry much longer, but from August 1863 to at least September 1864 a force of one company, and sometimes two companies, of the 11th Kansas Cavalry was on duty guarding Aubry.

Sometime after September 19, 1864, very possibly during the height of Price's Missouri Raid, the garrison at Aubry was removed. A result was a raid by about ten guerrillas under Dan Vaughn on January 31, 1865. Word of the impending raid reached authorities in Olathe and a squad of soldiers rushed into Aubry, arriving too late to prevent the killing of a traveler, the robbery of two residents and the burning of several houses. Once again soldiers, around twenty, were stationed at Aubry.

He played college football at the University of Arizona. Early years Lucky was born in Antioch, California where he played in Antioch Youth Football. He graduated from Antioch High School, where he served as team captain and recorded 36 receptions for 650 yards and 11 touchdowns, earning All-Northern California and All-state honors as a senior. He left high school rated as the 15th best tight end in the country by SuperPrep magazine. In 2014, he was inducted into the Antioch Sports Hall of Fame. College career Lucky accepted a football scholarship from the University of Arizona, where he became a three-year starter for the Wildcats, starting 35 of his final 36 games. As a redshirt freshman, he appeared in 11 games, starting the last 2, while making 5 receptions for 99 yards. He was named the regular starter at tight end as a sophomore, posting 14 receptions for 168 yards and 2 touchdowns. The next year, he finished fourth on the team with 13 receptions for 154 yards and 2 touchdowns, helping the team win the Insight.com Bowl. As a senior, he was fourth on the team with 11 receptions for 142 yards. He also added 40 knockdown blocks, helping the team average 213 rushing yards-per-game (14th in the nation). In the last game against Arizona State University, his blocking contributed to gaining 607 rushing yards, including a school record 288 rushing yards by Trung Canidate. He finished as one of the school's top receiving tight ends, with 43 receptions for 563 yards and 4 touchdowns. He also earned his degree in Political science. Professional career Because his size was similar to that of an offensive tackle, Lucky was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the seventh round (229th overall) of the 1999 NFL Draft, with the intention of using him as a blocking tight end. His rookie season got off to a difficult start as he suffered a stress fracture in his left foot on August 27 and was forced to miss five weeks, including the first 2 games. On October 3, he earned his first career start and first career reception, both against the Arizona Cardinals. His sophomore season with the Cowboys never got under-way as he suffered a career threatening injury, tearing the ACL, MCL and PCL in his right knee during the pre-season opener against the Pittsburgh Steelers. He underwent re-constructive surgery to repair the ligaments in his knee on August 1, 2000, and was placed on the injured reserve list. After 12 months of rehab, he returned to action and earned starts in 5-of-16 games in 2001. His blocking helped bring about a resurgence in the team's running game that saw the Cowboys rank third in the league with 136.5 yards-per-game on the ground. As a receiver, he recorded 13 receptions for 96 yards and his first career touchdown. In view of his comeback, his teammates voted him the recipient of their 2001 Ed Block Courage Award. In 2002, he appeared in 16 games (no starts) and recorded one reception for 22 yards. He also was a part of the 17-14 loss to the Seattle Seahawks where Emmitt Smith broke the NFL all-time rushing record. That year would mark his final season as a professional football player, after retiring because of knee injuries. Personal life Off the field, he showed support for the Race for the Cure in the Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth metroplex, which benefits the Susan G. Komen for the Cure foundation.

History and description  Built as a private residence in 1927, it has been operating as a wedding chapel since at least 1939 when owner Ollie McKee began performing ceremonies. By the early 1940s it was called Gretna Green Wedding Chapel, named after the Scottish wedding destination of Gretna Green. Elvis Presley visited the chapel in 1967, while planning his wedding to Priscilla Beaulieu. According to Frommer's, Presley himself gave the owners of the chapel permission to use the Graceland name, but in fact it was not renamed until after the singer's death, the same year that Elvis-themed weddings began there.

The group took its name from Greek mythology, where Hades was the Gatekeeper of the Underworld. Their hardcore style lyrics and dark production are reminiscent of many British Hip Hop 'Britcore' acts, such II Tone Committee, Hijack and Killa Instinct. The group have developed a strong following overseas, having performed at many festivals in Europe, including Germany's Mass Hysteria in Hamburg. In 2008, they were the first independent Australian hip hop act to perform at the Glastonbury Festival in the United Kingdom. History Newcastle brothers Kid Lyrical and Wizardry met Likewyze onstage, when the duo began rhyming over a performance of a funk band Likewyze was playing guitar in. At the time Likewyze was studying audio at music school and offered to record the duo, along with Scotty B and DJ Skoob, the three time NSW DMC champion. This resulted in their debut album, the self-titled, independently released Blades of Hades. By 2005, Jane Tyrrell had joined the Sydney hip hop group The Herd full-time. The group counter-acted the line-up change and shortened their name to just 'Blades' in 2006. The same year, they released their second album This Installment, which was distributed by Obese Records. The album featured Newcastle DJ Mark N on cuts and production for the track 'Blast Opposition', which they also released a video clip for. Blades appeared on Oriel Guthre's documentary Skip Hop: Volume One in 2006. They were interviewed and also contributed to the project's soundtrack. Shadow Art was released in 2008, followed by their free to download mix tape Two Thousand And Nine the following year. Another free to download mix tape was released in 2010. In June 2010, Blades signed to Difrnt Music which acts include Cog and Regular John. Blades are the record label's first hip hop group. Lui from Unda K9 negotiated and got the crew signed whilst she was working as Label Manager for David Edwards (former manager for INXS, Michael Hutchence and the Executive Producer of Rock Star: INXS) who is the MD Difrnt Music.

Description Polydactylus sexfilis is a medium-sized species, which attains a maximum total length of and a weight of . It has a ponted snout and the head has an almost horizontal profile. There are two separated dorsal fins, the first dorsal fin has 8 spinesand the second dorsal fin contains a single spine and 12 or 13 soft rays. The anal fin has 3 spines and 11 or 12 soft rays, the base of the anal fin is roughly equal in length to the second dorsal-fin base. The pectoral fin has 15 or 16 rays, and this fin has a length which is equal to 20 to 23% of the standard length, and its tip does not reach the tip of pelvic fin; almost all the rays of the pectoral fin are unbranched except that in the largest specimens some of the rays may be branched. There are six pectoral filaments, the first is the shortest and does not reachthe pelvic fin origin. The second to fifth filaments reach past the pelvic-fin origin and the sixth is the longest and reached to or just beyond the tip f the pelvic fin. The caudal fin is deeply forked and its lobes are non- filamentous, although they are long. The simple lateral line has 60 to 67 pored scalesand runs from the upper end of the gill slit to the upper end of the lower lobe of the caudal fin. The head and flanks are tinged silvery brown dorsally, becoming silvery on their lower flanks. There are 7 to 9 prominent dark longitudinal stripes above the lateral line and 1 to 12 faint stripes below it, these may be absent in smaller fish. The first dorsal fin is black; the second dorsal fin is greyish with the last ray being white. The base of the pectoral fin is greyish black, darkening to black towards the rear. The pectoral filaments are greyish-black with white tips and bases. The front part of the pelvic fin is greyish black with the rest of it being coloured white. The anal fin is greyish-black with its last ray being white. The tail is uniformly greyish black. Distribution Polydactylus sexfilis has an Indo- Pacific distribution. It tends to occur mainly around oceanic islands. It has been recorded from Mauritius, Seychelles, Kenya and a number of other islands in the northern Indian Ocean. It is also found from Indonesia north to the island groups of southern Japan and east to the Hawaiian Islands, French Polynesia and Pitcairn Island. It has not been collected from continental Australia but has occurred from Cocos (Keeling) Island. Habitat and biology Polydactylus sexfilis is found in shallow water which are less than along sandy and rocky coastal beaches, in lagoons and near reef areas near oceanic islands, often where the water is very turbulent. It feeds largely on crustaceans and fishes. They reach sexual maturity as males when they attain a fork length of and then changing sex to fertile females after an intermediate hermaphrodite stage when they reach a fork length of . Spawning is governed by the phases of the moon. Fisheries Polydactylus sexfilis is an important species for commercial fisheries in Hawaii where it is also used in aquaculture. In Hawaiian this species is called moi and in pre colonial Hawaii the moi was reserved for royalty. They were farmed in specially created ponds.

The protusible mouth can be extended forward to catch prey.

It lives in clear and calm waters in rocky and coral reefs from the surface to 120 m deep. Behaviour The Chinese trumpetfish is diurnal and solitary. It is a clever stealth hunter with two techniques to catch its prey. The first is the ambush, consisting of lying in wait for a potential prey close to hard coral, black coral bush, or gorgonian. The second is the discrete tracking, where the trumpetfish stays close to some big fishes (groupers, carangids) or even hawksbill sea turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) until it has the opportunity to approach unsuspecting prey. The Chinese trumpetfish feeds on small fishes and crustaceans.

On 29 October 2012, ECWVTA was extended to cover all new road vehicles and their trailers. *United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) regulations. *National Small Series Type Approval (NSSTA) - the key advantages of this scheme are that some technical requirements may be reduced in comparison with ECWVTA; however, the number of vehicles that can be manufactured are limited. *Individual Vehicle Approval (IVA) The European Commission shall adopt amendments to this Directive which are necessary to lay down technical requirements for small series vehicles, vehicles approved under the individual approval procedure and 'special purpose vehicles'. ECE Regulations to which the Community has acceded and which are listed in Part I of Annex IV and in Annex XI of the frame Directive are part of the EC type- approval of a vehicle in the same way as the separate directives or regulations. They shall apply to the categories of vehicles listed in this Annexes. When the Community has decided to apply on a compulsory basis a UNECE Regulation for the purpose of EC vehicle type-approval in accordance with Article 4(4) of Decision 97/836/EC, the annexes to the Frame Directive shall be amended as appropriate in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 40(2) .The UNECE Regulations listed in Part II of Annex IV are recognised as being equivalent to the corresponding separate directives or regulations in as much as they share the same scope and subject matter. Where the Community has decided to applya new UNECE Regulation or a UNECE Regulation as amended, Part II of Annex IV shall be amended as appropriate. Automotive EC Directives and ECE Regulations require third party approval - testing, certification and production conformity assessment by an independent body. Each member state is required to appoint an Approval Authority to issue the approvals, and a Technical Service to carry out the testing to the Directives and Regulations. An approval issued by one Authority will be accepted in all the Member States. If a vehicle is produced in a very small quantity (e.g. M1 maximum 75 per year), single EU Member States can grant exception on a discretionary basis, however the validity of the Type Approval is limited to the boundaries of those Nations which concede to it. Cornerstones of the Type Approval process are: *Application by the vehicle or component manufacturer *Testing by a technical service *Granting of the approval by an Approval Authority *Conformity of Production by the manufacturer in agreement with the Approval Authority *Certificate of Conformity by the manufacturer for the end-user A particular country‚Äôs Type Approval may consist of one or more of the following forms: *Component Type Approval ‚îÄ approval of a component that may be fitted to any vehicle (e.g., seat belts, tires, lamps) *System Type Approval ‚îÄ approval of a set of components or a performance feature of a vehicle that can only be tested and certified in an installed condition (e.g., restraint system, brake system, lighting system) *Whole Vehicle Type Approval (WVTA) ‚îÄ approval of a vehicle in its entiretyResaffa Nogueira Martins, Henrique.

Thanks to that, the car can be registered in each European member state without additional national tests or approval. This harmonisation results in reduced costs and lead time for the manufacturer, importer as well as the consumer. Mandatory compliance date for ECWVTA for M1 vehicles was 2009-04-29. However cars that already have an ECWVTA but are imported from non EC countries often need to be re-approved when entering the EC.

Biography Wehr received his degree in medicine from the University of Louisville School of Medicine in 1969. He subsequently completed his psychiatric residency at Yale School of Medicine and his internship was at Michael Reese Hospital. In a 1990s study on photoperiodicity in humans, Wehr placed a group of volunteers in an environment in which it was dark for 14 hours each day for a month. The subjects were able to sleep as much as they wanted during the experiment. The first night, the subjects slept an average of 11 hours a night. This was judged as probably repaying a chronic sleep debt. By the fourth week, the subjects slept an average of eight hours a nightbut across two separate blocks, not unbroken. First, subjects tended to lie awake for one to two hours and then fall quickly asleep. Onset of sleep was linked to a spike in the hormone melatonin. Melatonin secretion by the brain's pineal gland is triggered by darkness. After an average of three to five hours of sleep, the subjects would awaken and spend an hour or two in quiet wakefulness before a second three- to five-hour sleep period. It was thus suggested that such a biphasic pattern of sleep is the natural or pre-historic tendency for humans. No research into the sleeping patterns in natural environments of primates closely related to humans was cited for comparison. Wehr and colleague Norman E. Rosenthal are credited with identifying and describing Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) and developing light therapy to treat it.Ivry, Sarah (13 August 2002), \\"Seasonal Depression Can Accompany Summer Sun\\", The New York Times, Retrieved 14 April 2010 Wehr and colleague Anna Wirz-Justice were awarded the Anna-Monika Prize for their work in the chronobiology of depressive illness.

(2000) Universalism, in R. Johnston, D. Gregory, G. Pratt and M. Wats(eds), ‚ÄúThe Dictionary of Human Geography\\". Oxford: Blackwell, 869-70. Universalist thinking began in the Age of Enlightenment when philosophers decided on \\"truths\\" that could explain occurrences rationally and accurately. Development geography, human geography and other disciplines seek to find and critique universal \\"truths\\". Critics suggest that Universalism has created a world knowledge hierarchy placing Western Europe, North America and the rest of the \\"developed\\" world at the top, as the centre of knowledge, and placing the rest of the globe below, as ignorant and needing to be educated. The hierarchy reiterates the core-periphery notion, examining it in terms of knowledge differentials across space. Origins As intellectuals began to question traditional understandings of the world and think on a global scale, new \\"truths\\" were created to help explain the world as placeless, free of cultural specificity, abstract and apolitical.Lawson, V.L., \\"Making Development Geography\\". London: Hodder Arnold They began to manifest themselves in development policies, political apparatuses, and other institutions. In the late 19th and 20th century, √âmile Durkheim wrote that \\"the truths of [modern] science are independent of any local context\\", echoing the Enlightenment's philosophies and assuming an isotropic globe, thus allowing homogeneity to overtake difference.Durkheim E., \\"Selected Writings\\".Cambridge: University Press A sense of security and superiority was wielded as the world was now understood, which allowed for the continued teaching of and reliance upon universal \\"truths\\". > One can see how saying that all knowledge is geographically located is > widely taken as a way of saying that the knowledge in question is not > authentically true at all.Nagel, T. The View From Nowhere. Oxford: > University Press Global diffusion As universal \\"truth\\" claims gained acceptance among Western intellectuals, they began an important transition into the school system. Michel Foucault describes the 17th- and-18th century school systems as being important because of highly complex systems of conditioning.Foucault Michel, \\"Power/Knowledge: Selected Interviews and Other Writings, 1972-1977\\". New York: Pantheon Books, 125. As \\"truth\\" claims were taught to children, they became embedded within societal and political apparatuses. Once cemented within such institutions, they were able to flourish and remain. Through the imperialist expansion by the west and the successive colonisation around the globe, supposed universal \\"truths\\" began to diffuse across borders, space and place. Once colonies were set up and dominant hegemons were in place the processes of the west began to be the processes of the world and the necessary steps to modernisation. Changing truths The realization that the truths may not be universal across different spaces was an important factor in the 1970s, when questions arose of nationally varying styles of science. By the mid-1980s, geographical sensibility towards science increased, seeking to show that locality and spatial situation needed to be remembered to understand how scientific knowledge was made, became credible and flowed globally.Shapin, S. Placing the View from Nowhere: Historical and Sociological Problems in the Location of Science. Blackwell It has been with that new situational approach to knowledge formation that allowed geographers to begin analyses of epistemology with relation to place and confront \\"truth\\" formation with a more culturally ecological (cultural ecology) approach. Foucaulta truths Important to universalism in geography is understanding how knowledge becomes accepted as truth. Foucault discusses truth in terms of \\"societal regimes of truth\\" and explains that truths are made up by societies by selecting \\"the types of discourse which it accepts and makes function as true\\" and creating and controlling \\"the mechanisms that enable us to distinguish between true and false statements\\".Foucault Michel, \\"Power/Knowledge: Selected Interviews and Other Writings, 1972-1977\\". New York: Pantheon Books, 131 He goes on about the relationship between truth and systems of power and how they produce and maintain such regimes of truth.

He found a canopic chest with cosmetic boxes. The objects were later sold to Berlin. Around 1832 John Gardner Wilkinson copied inscriptions of a coffin naming a queen with the same name. The original coffin is now lost. On the coffin it is stated that she was the daughter of the vizier Senebhenaf and of a woman called Sobekhotep. The inside of the coffin was decorated with different spells, many of them belong to the Egyptian Book of the Dead. Her coffin is one of the earliest sources for this funerary composition. It is not fully clear whether the coffin and the canopic chest were found in the same tomb. Giuseppe Passalacqua described the tomb and mentions an anthropoid coffin richly decorated with figures of deities. However, the coffin copied by Wilkinson is rectangular and not decorated with figures of gods. Therefore, Herbert E. Winlock, looking at the evidence concluded that there were two queens with the name Mentuhotep. One was the wife of king Djehuti, the other one is known from her coffin.H. H.

Early life and first band Curtis grew up in Stockton, California, and was raised Baptist. Curtis grew up listening to Contemporary Christian Music, as well as singing along to her dad playing 40s-era standards on the family's baby grand piano. Curtis learned to sing in church, and began playing the piano at age four. A piano teacher once told her she played the piano \\"like a boy\\". After college, Curtis formed the rock/pop group Paradigm, which became a popular act on the college touring circuit. The band separated in 2006. Solo career After dissolving Paradigm, Curtis turned her attention full-time to writing, and in 2007 released her debut solo EP, Boomerangs & Seesaws. Curtis began touring nationally in support of this EP, which was followed by a second EP, Paris Can't Have You, in March 2008. Both EPs were produced by Curtis's husband, producer/engineer Jamie Hill. Curtis's song \\"Before the Sun\\", from Boomerangs & Seesaws, was featured on MTV's hit show \\"The Hills\\". In 2008, Grammy-winning producer Charlie Peacock (Civil Wars, Amy Grant, Sixpence None The Richer) heard Curtis's track \\"Boomerangs & Seesaws\\" on her MySpace page, and contacted Curtis and offered to work on her next recording at his studio in Nashville. To finance the project, Curtis released a limited-edition fan club single of her song \\"Get Outta Town\\", the sales of which paid for her travel and recording expenses. Peacock produced Curtis's third EP Why Don't You Stay?, which was released in July 2009. Why Don't You Stay? was mixed by Joe Zook (OneRepublic, Modest Mouse, Katy Perry). 2010 and 2011 saw Curtis retrenching, writing, touring, and developing her sound. Writing on her website in 2011, she said, \\"I grew up in a pretty traditional musical environment, and when I started writing songs, I gravitated to the piano, because that's what I grew up playing. But my husband, Jamie, has a whole bunch of non-traditional instruments sitting around our house, and finally my curiosity got the better of me and I started playing around with them. We did 'Brightest Light' with that in mind, and wow! I feel like it's a huge step forward. It's like I have more colors to paint my little scenes with. It's really exciting.\\" Curtis released two 10-track maxi-singles in 2011, for the songs \\"Brightest Light in the Room\\" and \\"Let's Stay In\\", both of which showcased her evolving sound. Where before Curtis had used mostly natural acoustic-based instruments, these songs featured prominent drum machines and synthesizers. \\"Brightest Light in the Room\\" was written for two female US Army veterans on the occasion of their wedding engagement. A third standalone single, \\"Anti-Gravity\\", was released in August 2012. The song was written by Curtis on the occasion of the death of her neighbor, opera composer Daniel Cat√°n. On June 18, 2013, Curtis released her debut full-length album of downtempo dreampop, Cinemascope, produced by her husband, Jamie Hill. Cinemascope was subsequently nominated in the 2014 Independent Music Awards in the category of Best Producer. Curtis released her follow-up album Metaforma on June 17, 2014. Curtis also released a companion acoustic album on the same day, entitled Personal Songs Volume 1. Curtis initially sold this album only at shows, eventually releasing it worldwide on October 21, 2014. Curtis was the winner of the 2007 Winery Music Awards. Touring Curtis has done 11 national and 5 regional tours since 2007. She often makes reference to her 2002 Volkswagen Jetta, which she drives when on tour. The Jetta's wheel was used as the picture on the CD single of \\"Get Outta Town\\". Curtis announced on Twitter on September 28, 2014 that her Jetta had hit 333,333 miles. House Concert Touring and Book Frustrated with what she characterized as difficulty making progress on the traditional club and coffeehouse touring circuit, Curtis started experimenting in 2011 with supplementing her regular touring schedule with house concerts. She found house concerts to be \\"the most rewarding, fulfilling, and successful kind of touring I‚Äôve ever done\\", and soon abandoned traditional touring to focus exclusively on house concert touring. Curtis developed a highly profitable model for house concert touring, and in February 2014 published a how-to book detailing her method, titled \\"No Booker, No Bouncer, No Bartender: How I Made $25K On A 2-Month House Concert Tour (And How You Can Too).\\" Personal life Curtis lives in Tacoma, Washington. She is married to producer/engineer Jamie Hill. Discography *Boomerangs & Seesaws EP (2007) *Paris Can't Have You EP (2008) *Why Don't You Stay?

Demographics , Lakhpur had a population of 1,892 people. As per the 2011 Census, the population is 1,895 people.https://www.censusindia.gov.in/pca/final_pca.aspx The village has , of which is woodland. Lakhpur hosts the annual Dussehra Mela which can attract up to 4,000 people. Neighbouring villages include Sahni (Lakhpur-Sahni), Malikhpur, Begampur, Sangatpur, Chak Prema, Dhadday, Dhadoli and Bir Dhadoli. History It is said that the village is named after Maa Lakhi who had two sons and one daughter. The sons descendants are divided into two pattis (groups of families descending from one common ancestor). The pattis are the \\"Surjan\\" patti and the \\"Moru\\" patti with the surname Dhadwal or Thadwal. It is believed that Maa Lakhi's descendants have been living in Lakhpur for the past 25 generations. Some Dhadwal families have also settled in the village of Jagatpur near Mukandpur in the district of Nawanshahr (also known as Shahid Bhagat Singh Nagar district); in Apra, near Phillaur; and Mothada Kalan, also near Phillaur. The descendants of Maa Lakhi's daughter settled the neighbouring village of Bir Dhadoli and continue to reside in the village. Maa Lakhi belonged to a village near Nadalon in Hoshiarpur. The village may have been Ajnoha but this cannot be confirmed. Her husband's family also lived in Hoshiarpur near the present day Himachal Pradesh border. Maa Lakhi's father gave the couple land to settle on which became known as Lakhpur. Villagers confirm that Maa Lakhi was a devotee of Bhagat Baba Kalu who lived during the 16th century and built a shrine in Panshta also known as Panchhat. Maa Lakhi took her children to the shrine, especially on Baisakhi. Therefore, the period when the village was settled could be at any time during the 16th century, making the village at least 400 years old. According to local tradition, Lakhpur was already an established village at the time when Sri Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji visited Lakhpur whilst he was travelling from Kartarpur to Kiratpur Sahib, and then visited Palahi (near Phagwara) in 1635, where he was involved in a battle against the Mughals led by Ahmad Khan. It is said that Guru Ji visited Lakhpur before visiting Chak Prema and stopping at Palahi. Guru Ji also visited Domeli, Hadiabad and Phagwara where Gurdwaras have been built in memory of the visit. Around Lakhpur The village has four Gurdwaras. The oldest, Gurdwara Sahib Guru Granth Sahib, is managed by the Shromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee. The dharamsal of Bhagat Jawala Dass Ji is currently being reconstructed and will be the fifth Gurdwara. The village also has a pharmacy, a Mandir, the shrine of Lakha Datta Pir (Sakhi Sarwar), the dharamsals of Baba Ram Dass Ji, Baba Amar Dass Ji and Guru Ravidas Ji, the Baba Balak Nath Mandir and shrine of Bhagat Baba Kalu, a primary school, Government Secondary School (which runs the Galaxy Science Club), a Post Office, Shaheed Shrines, a bank, a Mosque, Jathera and some shops.

Various villages entered the tournament which included Sangatpur, Jagpalpur, Ghumana, Manaka, Harkowal and Akalgarh. Religion Lakhpur is a mix of Sikhs and Hindus. It also has a Muslim Gujjar and Bazigar settlement. Location of Lakhpur Lakhpur is located east of the Phagwara-Hoshiarpur Road. Heading north from Phagwara for 5 km, one must turn right opposite Khatti and travel for 2.2 km on the Chak Prema-Lakhpur Road. File:Lakhpur New Map.png Gurdwara Sahib Guru Granth Sahib During the times of Guru Arjan Dev Ji, the village was known as Lakhu Pur. People of the village used to go to Amritsar to pay homage to Guru Arjan Dev Ji. Remembering this, Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji and Sri Guru Har Rai Sahib Ji visited Lakhpur where they held congregations to preach about Sikhism.Sadhe Itihasak Gurdham - Majha, Malwa, Doaba, Himachal Pradesh De Gurdware. Giani Bhajan Singh - Star Books 2003 The people of Lakhpur built a dharamshala on the spot where the congregations were held. Later, Gurdwara Sahib Guru Granth Sahib was built on the same exact spot. Chitti Bein and the Great Flood Chitti Bein by Lakhpur The Chitti (White)Bein passes through all districts of doaba and drains into the Sutlej, near Harike in Amritsar District. It also flows near Lakhpur. Locals recall the flood of the mid 1940s, known as the Great Flood. It is said that the Chitti Bein breached its banks at a number of places, causing severe devastation. The water reached as far as the gate of the middle part of Lakhpur. So much damage was caused to the G.T Road near Chiheru that a new section of the Road had to be constructed. The Chitti Bein is prone to seasonal flooding because seasonal torrent (stream)/torrents, known in Punjabi as choes, drain into it. The most famous are the Maili Choe; the Jammanwala Choe and the Nasrala Choe. The Maili Choe takes its name from the Maili Dam near the village of Maili in Hoshiarpur District. It merges with the Chitti Bein near the village of Cheta (Nawanshahr District). The Jamanwala Choe winds it way through Hoshiarpur district flowing near the villages of Panchhat, Narur, Nasirabad and drains into the Chitti Bein near Malikhpur. Both these choes drain into the Chitti Bein prior to flowing near Lakhpur. It is for this reason that there is wetland, near the Lakhpur woodland, which is caused when the Chitti Bein breaches its bank. After flowing near Lakhpur, the Chitti Bein flows for some kilometres, and is joined by the Nasrala Choe which takes its name from the Nasrala bridge near the village of Nasrala on the Hoshiarpur-Jalandhar Road. It merges with the Chitti Bein near the village of Ucha. The Narur choe joins the Nasrala Choe near the village of Babeli.

The Boeing 707‚Äì328 aircraft involved in the accident was just four months old. The flight was uneventful until approaching Pointe-√†-Pitre. The airport is surrounded by mountains and requires a steep descent. The weather was poor ‚Äì violent thunderstorm and low cloud ceiling. The VOR navigational beacon was out of service. The crew reported themselves over the non-directional beacon (NDB) at 5,000 feet (1,524 m) and turned east to begin the final approach. Due to incorrect automatic direction finder (ADF) readings caused by the thunderstorm, the plane strayed 15 km (9.3 mi) west from the procedural let-down track. The plane crashed in a forest on a hill called Dos D'Ane (\\"The Donkey's Back\\"), at about 1,400 feet (427 m) and exploded. There were no survivors. Among the dead were French Guianan politician and war hero Justin Catay√©e and poet and black-consciousness activist Paul Niger. The investigation could not determine the exact reason for the accident, but suspected the insufficient meteorological information given to the crew, failure of the ground equipment, and the atmospheric effects on the ADF indicator. After the crash Air France pilots criticized under-developed airports with facilities that were ill-equipped to handle jet aircraft, such as Guadeloupe's airport.\\"Boeing Crash Pilot's Alleged Protest Before Flight.\\" The Times. 2 July 1962. 10. This was the second accident in less than three weeks with an Air France Boeing 707 after the crash on 3 June 1962. Tex Johnston, Chief Test Pilot of Boeing Aircraft Co. wrote in his autobiography of events leading up to the crash. \\"Air France flight crews were habitually late (for crew training by Boeing), and on occasion the airplane not serviced. ... After much extra, and in my mind, excessive flight training, the chief pilot failed to qualify.\\" He informed the Air France Chief Executive in writing \\"I did not believe the captain capable of qualifying in the 707.\\" Later \\"... an Air France instructor qualified the chief pilot. On his second trip as captain, he missed an inclement weather approach... and crashed into a mountain.\\" Some debris still remain at the site, where a memorial monument was placed in 2002 to mark the 40th anniversary of the crash.

In the 2016-17 school year, Reading Partners delivered individualized reading tutoring to more than 11,200 students in 225 elementary schools. Program In its core program, Reading Partners operates reading centers at elementary schools in under-served communities where children reading below grade level receive free one-on-one tutoring from volunteers using a structured, research-based curriculum.http://mercurynews.info/wishbook/2008/page.php?w=reading The program is proven to improve students' progress in reading, with over 83% meeting their primary end of year growth goals, according to the Reading Partners impact report released in 2017. Teachers refer students struggling with reading to the campus Reading Partners program, where they receive the one-on-one attention of a trained volunteer tutor for ninety minutes each week. Tutoring sessions focus on building students‚Äô reading skills in five critical areas of literacy: phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary, fluency, and comprehension. Reading Partners‚Äô curricular materials consist of three key components, each of which address different levels of reading ability with curriculum-based, logically sequenced materials. Upon entry into Reading Partners, every student is assessed using the Rigby PM Ultra Benchmarking Kit and placed into one of the three programs depending on the child‚Äôs individual needs. History Reading Partners began at Belle Haven Elementary School in Menlo Park when members of the community joined together to help students struggling with reading skills. At the time, fewer than 1 in 5 students at Belle Haven could read at grade level and more than 80% of students qualified for the National School Lunch Program.

In March 1964, muttonbirders arrived to find the island had been devastated by the effect of rats that were causing one of New Zealand's greatest ecological disasters of the twentieth century. Previously free of mammalian predators, the ecology of the island was devastated in a matter of years and many endemic species of bird (some flightless) were driven to extinction. The surviving biomass of insect and bird life has been heavily reduced. An eradication programme to rid the island of rats and the island was rat-free again in 2006. Animals that became extinct Despite intervention by the New Zealand Wildlife Service that trapped and transferred some surviving birds to other, rat free, off-shore islands, two species of bird did not survive and became extinct. These were Stead's bush wren and the South Island snipe. The New Zealand greater short-tailed bat also became extinct.

It is endemic to the Hawaiian islands of Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Maui, Lanai and Hawaii. The species was first described by Arthur Gardiner Butler in 1877. Pupa Caterpillar Recorded food plants include Cocos nucifera, but it occasionally also feeds on Pritchardia (including Pritchardia pacifica), banana and introduced palms. Young larvae feed gregariously on the underside of the leaf of their host plant protected by a thin web of silk. At first they eat the substance of the leaf and leave the opposite epidermis. They soon scatter more or less, and make hiding places by fastening together the lower edges of coconut leaflets. Often several caterpillars can be found in the same place. As they become slightly larger, they eat the whole substance, eating from the edge, and not leaving the epidermis. When the leaflet is mostly eaten, they migrate to other leaflets. Larvae are full grown in about four weeks from hatching. Full-grown larvae are 32‚Äì35 mm long and dull greenish, with two dorsal whitish lines. Pupation takes place in a slight cocoon in the caterpillar's retreat. The pupa is 15‚Äì19 mm long and light to dark brown according. The pupal period lasts 11‚Äì13 days.

Origins and youth Husni al-Barazi was born in the Syrian city of Hama into a prominent landowning family of Kurdish origin. He was educated in Istanbul where he attended classes with the Bedir Khan brothers. Later he received a doctorate degree from the Sorbonne.  Political activity  During the French Mandate, Al-Barazi joined the Syrian opposition to French rule, but in 1926 he was arrested for his opposition activities and was exiled to Lebanon. Upon returning to Syria in 1928, Al-Barazi ran for parliamentary elections and was elected a Member of the Syrian Parliament. Al-Barazi reportedly played a prominent role in the local hashish market. He was appointed Minister of Culture from 1934 till 1936, then Governor of Alexandretta (Iskenderun) from 1936 to 1938. In April 1942 he was appointed Prime Minister, but was removed from his position and isolated by the French authorities in January 1943, following which he again moved to Lebanon. Downfall, exile and death Al Barazi returned to Syria in 1946 and remained in his position as Member of Parliament during all the military coups that took place from the late forties until the mid fifties. During this period, he was accused of plotting against the state and was arrested several times. However, in 1948 he was Governor of Aleppo, and the following year became deputy to the military governor of Syria under Husni al-Za'im. In Aleppo he co-founded the newspaper al-Nass, which was critical of Egypt's leader Gamal Abdel Nasser. He went into final exile in 1954, when, while he was on a trip to Turkey, he was accused of plotting and conspiring against Syria, and was sentenced to death in absentia. In the late 1960s, al-Barazi was pardoned on account of his old age but never returned to Syria; he remained in exile between Lebanon and Turkey, where he died in 1975.

It instituted many reforms, particularly in the 1970s under the Vatican II Council, in order to modernize practices and positions. In this period, Catholic missionaries in the Far East worked to improve education and health care, while evangelizing peoples and attracting numerous followers in China, Taiwan, Korea, and Japan. Catholic social teaching In 1891 Pope Leo XIII issued Rerum novarum in which the Church defined the dignity and rights of industrial workers. Rerum novarum The Industrial Revolution brought many concerns about the deteriorating working and living conditions of urban workers. Influenced by the German Bishop Wilhelm Emmanuel Freiherr von Ketteler, in 1891 Pope Leo XIII published the encyclical Rerum novarum, titled \\"On Capital and Labor\\". This encyclical set in context Catholic social teaching in terms that rejected socialism but advocated the regulation of working conditions. Rerum novarum argued for the establishment of a living wage and the right of workers to form trade unions.Duffy, Saints and Sinners (1997), p. 240 In Rerum novarum, Leo set out the Catholic Church's response to the social instability and labor conflict that had arisen in the wake of industrialization and had led to the rise of socialism. The Pope taught that the role of the State is to promote social justice through the protection of rights, while the Church must speak out on social issues in order to teach correct social principles and ensure class harmony. He restated the Church's long-standing teaching regarding the crucial importance of private property rights, but recognised, in one of the best-known passages of the encyclical, that the free operation of market forces must be tempered by moral considerations: : Let the working man and the employer make free agreements, and in particular let them agree freely as to the wages; nevertheless, there underlies a dictate of natural justice more imperious and ancient than any bargain between man and man, namely, that wages ought not to be insufficient to support a frugal and well-behaved wage-earner. If through necessity or fear of a worse evil the workman accept harder conditions because an employer or contractor will afford him no better, he is made the victim of force and injustice.Rerum novarum, ¬ß 45 Rerum novarum is remarkable for its vivid depiction of the plight of the late 19th-century urban poor and for its condemnation of unrestricted capitalism. Among the remedies it prescribed were the formation of trade unions and the introduction of collective bargaining, particularly as an alternative to state intervention. Rerum novarum also recognized that the poor have a special status in consideration of social issues: the modern Catholic principle of the \\"preferential option for the poor\\" and the notion that God is on the side of the poor found their first expression in this document.The Busy Christian's Guide to Social Teaching.Catholic Encyclopedia (1911): Rerum Novarum. Quadragesimo anno Forty years after Rerum novarum, and more than a year into the Great Depression, Pope Pius XI issued Quadragesimo anno, subtitled \\"On Reconstruction of the Social Order\\". Released on 15 May 1931, this encyclical expanded on Rerum novarum, noting the positive effect of the earlier document but pointing out that the world had changed significantly since Pope Leo's time. Unlike Leo, who addressed mainly the condition of workers, Pius XI concentrated on the ethical implications of the social and economic order. He called for the reconstruction of the social order based on the principle of solidarity and subsidiarity.Duffy 260 He also noted major dangers for human freedom and dignity, arising from both unrestrained capitalism and totalitarian communism. Pius XI reiterated Leo's defence of private property rights and collective bargaining, and repeated his contention that blind economic forces cannot create a just society on their own: Quadragesimo Anno also supported state intervention to mediate labor- management conflicts (a reference to the economic system which Mussolini was attempting to establish in Italy at the time), and introduced the concept of subsidiarity into Catholic thought. Prior to Quadragesimo anno, some Catholics had wondered whether Leo XIII's condemnation of radical left-wing politics in Rerum novarum extended only to outright communism or whether it included milder forms of socialism as well. Pius made it clear that non-communistic Socialism was included in the condemnation. The Catholic Church defined a distinctive position for itself between free-market capitalism on the right and statist socialism on the left. Pius XII The social teachings of Pope Pius XII repeat these teachings, and apply them in greater detail not only to workers and owners of capital, but also to other professions, such as politicians, educators, housewives, farmers bookkeepers, international organizations, and all aspects of life including the military. Going beyond Pius XI, he also defined social teachings in the areas of medicine, psychology, sport, TV, science, law and education. There is virtually no social issue, which Pius XII did not address and relate to the Christian faith.Franzen, 368 He was called \\"the Pope of Technology,\\" for his willingness and ability to examine the social implications of technological advances. The dominant concern was the continued rights and dignity of the individual. With the beginning of the space age at the end of his pontificate, Pius XII explored the social implications of space exploration and satellites on the social fabric of humanity, asking for a new sense of community and solidarity in light of existing papal teachings on subsidiarity.Felictity O'Brien, Pius XII, London: 2000, p.13 The Catholic Church exercised a prominent role in shaping America's labor movement. In 1933, two American Catholics, Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin, founded a new Catholic peace group, the Catholic Worker that would embody their ideals of pacifism, commitment to the poor, and to fundamental change in American society. They published a newspaper of the same name for years. Anti-clericalism In Latin America, a succession of anti- clerical regimes came to power beginning in the 1830s.Stacy, p. 139. In the 1920s and 1930s, the Catholic Church was subjected to unprecedented persecution in Mexico, as well as in Europe in Spain and the Soviet Union. Pope Pius XI called this the \\"terrible triangle\\".Fontenelle, 164 The \\"harsh persecution short of total annihilation of the clergy, monks, and nuns and other people associated with the Church\\",Riasanovsky 617 began in 1918 and continued well into the 1930s. The Civil War in Spain started in 1936, during which thousands of churches were destroyed, thirteen bishops and some 6,832 clergy and religious Spaniards were assassinated.Franzen 397 After the widespread Church persecutions in Mexico, Spain and the Soviet Union, Pius XI defined communism as the main adversary of the Catholic Church in his encyclical Divini Redemptoris issued on 19 March 1937.Franzen 365 He blamed Western powers and media for a \\"conspiracy of silence\\" with respect to the persecutions carried out by Communist, Socialist and Fascist forces. Mexico In Mexico, the Calles Law eventually led to the \\"worst guerilla war in Latin American History\\", the Cristero War.Chadwick, Owen, pp. 264‚Äì265. Between 1926 and 1934, over 3,000 priests were exiled or assassinated.Scheina, p. 33. In an effort to prove that \\"God would not defend the Church\\", Calles ordered Church desecrations in which services were mocked, nuns were raped, and captured priests were shot. Calles was eventually deposed. Despite the persecution, the Church in Mexico continued to grow. A 2000 census reported that 88 percent of Mexicans identify as Catholic. Spain During the Spanish Civil War, Spanish republicans and anarchists targeted priests and nuns as symbols of conservatism, murdering large numbers of them.Chadwick, Owen p. 240. Confiscation of Church properties and restrictions on people's religious freedoms have generally accompanied secularist and Marxist-leaning governmental reforms.Norman, pp. 167‚Äì172. Soviet Union Worried by the persecution of Christians in the Soviet Union, Pius XI mandated Berlin nuncio Eugenio Pacelli to work secretly on diplomatic arrangements between the Vatican and the Soviet Union. Pacelli negotiated food shipments for Russia, and met with Soviet representatives including Foreign Minister Georgi Chicherin, who rejected any kind of religious education, or the ordination of priests and bishops, but offered agreements without the points vital to the Vatican.(Hansjakob Stehle, Die Ostpolitik des Vatikans, Piper, M√ºnchen, 1975, pp. 139‚Äì141 Despite Vatican pessimism and a lack of visible progress, Pacelli continued the secret negotiations. Pius XI ordered them to be discontinued in 1927, because they generated no results and he believed they would be dangerous to the Church's standing, if made public. The harsh persecution continued well into the 1930s. The Soviet government executed and exiled many clerics, monks and laymen, confiscating Church implements \\"for victims of famine\\", and closing many churches.Riasanovsky 634 Yet according to an official report based on the census of 1936, some 55% of Soviet citizens identified themselves openly as religious, while others possibly concealed their belief. In other countriesEastern Europe= Following the Soviet doctrine regarding the exercise of religion, postwar Communist governments in Eastern Europe severely restricted religious freedoms. Even though some clerics collaborated with the Communist regimes during their decades of power, from the late 1980s the Church's resistance and the leadership of Pope John Paul II have been credited with hastening the downfall in 1991 of communist governments across Europe. =China= The rise to power of the Communists in China of 1949 led to the expulsion of all foreign missionaries, \\"often after cruel and farcical 'public trials'.\\"Bokenkotter, pp. 356‚Äì358. In an effort to further isolate Chinese Catholics, the new government created the Patriotic Church whose unilaterally appointed bishops were initially rejected by Rome but subsequently many were accepted.Chadwick, Owen pp. 259‚Äì260.\\"China installs Pope-backed bishop\\", BBC News 21 September 2007. Retrieved 8 September 2009 The Cultural Revolution of the 1960s encouraged gangs of teenagers to eliminate all religious establishments and convert their occupants into labourers. When Chinese churches eventually reopened, they remained under the control of the Communist party's Patriotic Church, and many Catholic pastors and priests continued to be sent to prison for refusing to renounce allegiance to Rome. =Latin America= General Juan Per√≥n's Argentina and Fidel Castro's Cuba also engaged in extensive anti- clericalism, confiscating Catholic properties. In 1954, under the regime of General Juan Per√≥n, Argentina saw extensive destruction of churches, denunciations of clergy and confiscation of Catholic schools as Per√≥n attempted to extend state control over national institutions.Norman, The Roman Catholic Church an Illustrated History (2007), pp. 167-8 Cuba, under atheist Fidel Castro, succeeded in reducing the Church's ability to work by deporting the archbishop and 150 Spanish priests, discriminating against Catholics in public life and education and refusing to accept them as members of the Communist Party. The subsequent flight of 300,000 people from the island also helped to diminish the Church there.Chadwick, A History of Christianity (1995), p. 266 Response to authoritarianism Authoritarianism or Fascism describes certain related political regimes in 20th-century Europe, especially the Nazi Germany of Hitler, the authoritarian Soviet Union, the Fascist Italy of Mussolini and the falangist Spain of Franco. Pope Pius XI was moderately skeptical of Italian Fascism. To Pope Pius XI, Dollfuss in Austria was the ideal politician realising Quadragesimo anno. Nazi Germany In the 1937 encyclical Mit brennender Sorge, drafted by the future Pope Pius XII,Pham, Heirs of the Fisherman: Behind the Scenes of Papal Death and Succession (2005), p. 45, quote: \\"When Pius XI was complimented on the publication, in 1937, of his encyclical denouncing Nazism, Mit Brennender Sorge, his response was to point to his Secretary of State and say bluntly, 'The credit is his.' \\" Pope Pius XI warned Catholics that antisemitism is incompatible with Christianity.Vidmar, The Catholic Church Through the Ages (2005), pp. 327‚Äì333, quote: \\"Mark well that in the Catholic Mass, Abraham is our Patriarch and forefather. Anti-Semitism is incompatible with the lofty thought which that fact expresses. It is a movement with which we Christians can have nothing to do. No, no, I say to you it is impossible for a Christian to take part in anti-Semitism. It is inadmissible. Through Christ and in Christ we are the spiritual progeny of Abraham. Spiritually, we are all Semites.\\" Read from the pulpits of all German Catholic churches, it described Hitler as an insane and arrogant prophet and was the first official denunciation of Nazism made by any major organization.Bokenkotter, A Concise History of the Catholic Church (2004), p. 389-92 Nazi persecution of the Church in Germany then began by \\"outright repression\\" and \\"staged prosecutions of monks for homosexuality, with the maximum of publicity.\\" When Dutch bishops protested against deportation of Jews in the Netherlands, the Nazi's responded with even more severe measures. On 20 July 1933, the Vatican signed an agreement with Germany, the Reichskonkordat, partly in an effort to stop Nazi persecution of Catholic institutions.Coppa, p. 132-7Rhodes, pp. 182‚Äì183 quote \\"His contention seemed confirmed in a speech by Staatsminister Wagner in Munich on the 31st March 1934, only nine months after the signature of the Concordat. Wagner said if the Church had not signed a concordat with Germany, the National Socialist government would have abolished the Catholic Youth organisations altogether, and placed them in the same 'anti-state' category as the Marxist groups. ... If the maintenance of Catholic education and of the Catholic Youth associations was, as we have seen often enough before, the principal aim of Papal diplomacy, then his phrase, 'the Concordat prevented greater evils' seems justified. ... \\"The German episcopate considered that neither the Concordats up to then negotiated with individual German States (Lander), nor the Weimar Constitution gave adequate guarantees or assurance to the faithful of respect for their convictions, rights or liberty of action. In such conditions the guarantees could not be secured except through a settlement having the solemn form of a concordat with the central government of the Reich, I would add that since it was the German government which made the proposal, the responsibility for all the regrettable consequences would have fallen on the Holy See if it had refused the proposed Concordat. Although the Church had few illusions about National Socialism, it must be recognized that the Concordat in the years that followed brought some advantages, or at least prevented worse evils. In fact, in spite of all the violations to which it was subjected, it gave German Catholics a juridical basis for their defence, a stronghold behind which to shield themselves in their oppositions to the ever- growing campaign of religious persecution.\\" When this escalated to include physical violence, Pope Pius XI issued the 1937 encyclical Mit brennender Sorge.Rhodes, p. 197 quote \\"Violence had been used against a Catholic leader as early as June 1934, in the 'Night of the Long Knives' ... by the end of 1936 physical violence was being used openly and blatantly against the Catholic Church. The real issue was not, as the Nazis contended, a struggle with 'political Catholicism', but that the regime would tolerate the Church only if it adapted its religious and moral teaching to the materialist dogma of blood and race - that is, if it ceased to be Christian.\\"Shirer, p. 235 quote \\"On July 25, five days after the ratification of the concordat, the German government promulgated a sterilization law, which particularly offended the Catholic Church. Five days later the first steps were taken to dissolve the Catholic Youth League. During the next years, thousands of Catholic priests, nuns and lay leaders were arrested, many of them on trumped-up charges of 'immorality' or 'smuggling foreign currency'. Erich Klausener, leader of Catholic Action, was, as we have seen, murdered in the June 30, 1934, purge. Scores of Catholic publications were suppressed, and even the sanctity of the confessional was violated by Gestapo agents. By the spring of 1937, the Catholic hierarchy, in Germany, which, like most of the Protestant clergy, had tried to co-operate with the new regime, was thoroughly disillusioned.McGonigle, p. 172 quote \\"Hitler, of course flagrantly violated the rights of Catholics and others whenever it pleased him. Catholic Action groups were attacked by Hitler's police and Catholic schools were closed. Priests were persecuted and sent to concentration camps. ... On Palm Sunday, 21 March 1937, the encyclical Mit Brennender Sorge was read in Catholic Churches in Germany. In effect it taught that the racial ideas of the leader (fuhrer) and totalitarianism stood in opposition to the Catholic faith. The letter let the world, and especially German Catholics, know clearly that the Church was harassed and persecuted, and that it clearly opposed the doctrines of Nazism.\\" Drafted by the future Pope Pius XIIPham, p. 45, quote: \\"When Pius XI was complimented on the publication, in 1937, of his encyclical denouncing Nazism, Mit Brennender Sorge, his response was to point to his Secretary of State and say bluntly, 'The credit is his.'\\" and read from the pulpits of all German Catholic churches, it criticized Hitler,Vidmar, p. 327 quote \\"Pius XI's greatest coup was in writing the encyclical Mit Brennender Sorge (\\"With Burning Desire\\") in 1936, and having it distributed secretly and ingeniously by an army of motorcyclists, and read from the pulpit on Palm Sunday before the Nazis obtained a single copy. It stated (in German and not in the traditional Latin) that the Concordat with the Nazis was agreed to despite serious misgivings about Nazi integrity. It then went on to condemn the persecution of the church, the neopaganism of the Nazi ideology-especially its theory of racial superiority-and Hitler himself, calling him 'a mad prophet possessed of repulsive arrogance.'\\" and condemned Nazi persecution and ideology and has been characterized by scholars as the \\"first great official public document to dare to confront and criticize Nazism\\" and \\"one of the greatest such condemnations ever issued by the Vatican.\\"Norman, p. 167 quote \\"But violations began almost at once by Nazi Party officials, and in 1937 the papacy issued a Letter to the German bishops to be read in the churches. Mit Brennender Sorge ... denounced the violations as contrary to Natural Law and to the term of the Concordat. The Letter, in fact, amounted to a condemnation of Nazi ideology: 'In political life within the state, since it confuses considerations of utility with those of right, it mistakes the basic fact that man as a person possesses God-given rights which must be preserved from all attacks aimed at denying, suppressing, or disregarding them.' The Letter also rejected absolutely the concept of a German National Church.\\"Bokenkotter, pp. 389‚Äì392, quote \\"And when Hitler showed increasing belligerence toward the Church, Pius met the challenge with a decisiveness that astonished the world. His encyclical Mit Brennender Sorge was the 'first great official public document to dare to confront and criticize Nazism' and 'one of the greatest such condemnations ever issued by the Vatican.' Smuggled into Germany, it was read from all the Catholic pulpits on Palm Sunday in March 1937. It denounced the Nazi \\"myth of blood and soil\\" and decried its neopaganism, its war of annihilation against the Church, and even described the Fuhrer himself as a 'mad prophet possessed of repulsive arrogance'. The Nazis were infuriated, and in retaliation closed and sealed all the presses that had printed it and took numerous vindictive measures against the Church, including staging a long series of immorality trials of Catholic clergy.\\"Rhodes, p. 204-205 quote \\"Mit brennender Sorge did not prevaricate. Although it began mildly enough with an account of the broad aims of the Church, it went on to become one of the greatest condemnations of a national regime ever pronounced by the Vatican. Its vigorous language is in sharp contrast to the involved style in which encyclicals were normally written. The education question was fully and critically examined, and a long section devoted to disproving the Nazi theory of Blood and Soil (Blut und Boden) and the Nazi claim that faith in Germany was equivalent to faith in God. There were scathing references to Rosenberg's Myth of the Twentieth Century and its neo-paganism. The pressure exercised by the Nazi party on Catholic officials to betray their faith was lambasted as 'base, illegal and inhuman'. The document spoke of \\"a condition of spiritual oppression in Germany such as has never been seen before\\", of 'the open fight against the Confessional schools and the suppression of liberty of choice for those who desire a Catholic education'. 'With pressure veiled and open,' it went on, 'with intimidation, with promises of economic, professional, civil, and other advantages, the attachment of Catholics to the Faith, particularly those in government employment, is exposed to a violence as illegal as it is inhuman.' 'The calvary of the Church': 'The war of annihilation against the Catholic Faith'; 'The cult of idols'. The fulminations thundered down from the pulpits to the delighted congregations. Nor was the Fuhrer himself spared, for his 'aspirations to divinity', 'placing himself on the same level as Christ': 'a mad prophet possessed of repulsive arrogance' (widerliche Hochmut).\\" According to Eamon Duffy, \\"The impact of the encyclical was immense\\" and the \\"infuriated\\" Nazis increased their persecution of Catholics and the ChurchChadwick, Owen p. 254 quote \\"The encyclical was smuggled into Germany and read from the pulpits on Palm Sunday. It made the repression far worse; but it too was necessary to Christian honour.\\" by initiating a \\"long series\\" of persecution of clergy and other measures.Courtois, p. 29 quote \\"... Pope Pius XI condemned Nazism and Communism respectively in the encyclicals Mit Brennender Sorge ... and Divini redemptoris ... .\\"Duffy, (paperback edition) p. 343 quote \\"In a triumphant security operation, the encyclical was smuggled into Germany, locally printed, and read from Catholic pulpits on Palm Sunday 1937. Mit Brennender Sorge ('With Burning Anxiety') denounced both specific government actions against the Church in breach of the concordat and Nazi racial theory more generally. There was a striking and deliberate emphasis on the permanent validity of the Jewish scriptures, and the Pope denounced the 'idolatrous cult' which replaced belief in the true God with a 'national religion' and the 'myth of race and blood'. He contrasted this perverted ideology with the teaching of the Church in which there was a home 'for all peoples and all nations'. The impact of the encyclical was immense, and it dispelled at once all suspicion of a Fascist Pope. While the world was still reacting, however, Pius issued five days later another encyclical, Divini Redemptoris denouncing Communism, declaring its principles 'intrinsically hostile to religion in any form whatever', detailing the attacks on the Church which had followed the establishment of Communist regimes in Russia, Mexico and Spain, and calling for the implementation of Catholic social teaching to offset both Communism and 'amoral liberalism'. The language of Divini Redemptoris was stronger than that of Mit Brennender Sorge, its condemnation of Communism even more absolute than the attack on Nazism. The difference in tone undoubtedly reflected the Pope's own loathing of Communism as the ultimate enemy. The last year of his life, however, left no one any doubt of his total repudiation of the right-wing tyrannies in Germany and, despite his instinctive sympathy with some aspects of Fascism, increasingly in Italy also. His speeches and conversations were blunt, filled with phrases like 'stupid racialism', 'barbaric Hitlerism'.\\" Pius XI later warned that antisemitism is incompatible with Christianity.Vidmar, pp. 327‚Äì333, quote: \\"Mark well that in the Catholic Mass, Abraham is our Patriarch and forefather. Anti-Semitism is incompatible with the lofty thought which that fact expresses. It is a movement with which we Christians can have nothing to do. No, no, I say to you it is impossible for a Christian to take part in anti-Semitism. It is inadmissible. Through Christ and in Christ we are the spiritual progeny of Abraham. Spiritually, we are all Semites.\\" Despite a number of condemnations of atrocities committed during World War II, Pope Pius XII has been criticized for not having explicitly spoken out against the Holocaust. Although he never defended himself against such criticism, there is evidence that he chose to keep his public pronouncements circumspect while acting covertly to assist Jews seeking refuge from the Holocaust. Although Pius XII was exhorted by the British government and the Polish government-in-exile to condemn Nazi atrocities directly, he declined to do so out of concern that such pronouncements would only instigate further persecution by the Nazis. These sentiments were based on opinions expressed to him by bishops in Germany and Poland. When Dutch bishops protested against the wartime deportation of Jews, the Nazis responded by increasing deportations rounding up 92 converts including Edith Stein who were then deported and murdered.Vidmar, p. 331. \\"The brutality of the retaliation made an enormous impression on Pius XII.\\"Duffy, (paperback edition) p. 348 quote \\"It is clear from Maglione's intervention that Papa Pacelli cared about and sought to avert the deportation of the Roman Jews. but he did not denounce: a denunciation, the Pope believed, would do nothing to help the Jews, and would only extend Nazi persecution to yet more Catholics. It was the Church as well as the Jews in Germany, Poland and the rest of occupied Europe who would pay the price for any papal gesture. There was some weight in this argument: when the Dutch Catholic hierarchy denounced measures against Jews there, the German authorities retaliated by extending the persecution to baptized Jews who had formerly been protected by their Catholicism.\\" In Poland, the Nazis murdered over 2,500 monks and priests and even more were imprisoned.Chadwick, Owen pp. 254‚Äì255. In the Soviet Union, an even more severe persecution occurred. After the war, Pius XII's efforts to protect their people were recognised by prominent Jews including Albert Einstein and Rabbi Isaac Herzog.Bokenkotter p. 192 quote \\"The end of the war saw the prestige of the papacy at an all-time high. Many nations had ambassadors accredited with the Vatican. The President of the United States sent his personal representative, while a constant stream of the world's celebrities moved through its portals. The Holy Year of 1950 brought millions of more humble pilgrims to the tomb of Peter. The pope gave daily addresses on every conceivable subject and was widely quoted around the world. The number of Catholic dioceses increased during his reign from 1,696 to 2,048. ... Einstein, for instance, in an article in Time, paid tribute to Pius and noted that the Church alone 'stood squarely across the path of Hitler's campaign.' ... 'Rabbi Herzog, the chief rabbi of Israel, sent a message in February 1944 declaring \\"the people of Israel will never forget what His Holiness ... (is) doing for our unfortunate brothers and sisters in the most tragic hour of our history.\\"' David Dalin cites these tributes as recognition of the work of the Holy See in saving hundreds of thousands of Jews.\\" However, the Church has also been accused by some of encouraging centuries of antisemitism and Pius himself of not doing enough to stop Nazi atrocities.Phayer, pp. 50-57 Prominent members of the Jewish community have contradicted these criticisms.Bokenkotter, pp. 480‚Äì481, quote:\\"A recent article by American rabbi, David G. Dalin, challenges this judgement. He calls making Pius XII a target of moral outrage a failure of historical understanding, and he thinks Jews should reject any 'attempt to usurp the Holocaust' for the partisan purposes at work in this debate. Dalin surmises that well-known Jews such as Albert Einstein, Golda Meir, Moshe Sharett, and Rabbi Isaac Herzog would likely have been shocked at these attacks on Pope Pius. ... Dalin points out that Rabbi Herzog, the chief rabbi of Israel, sent a message in February 1944 declaring 'the people of Israel will never forget what His Holiness ... (is) doing for our unfortunate brothers and sisters in the most tragic hour of our history.'\\" Dalin cites these tributes as recognition of the work of the Holy See in saving hundreds of thousands of Jews.\\" The Israeli historian Pinchas Lapide interviewed war survivors and concluded that Pius XII \\"was instrumental in saving at least 700,000, but probably as many as 860,000 Jews from certain death at Nazi hands\\". Some historians dispute this estimateDe√°k, p. 182. while others consider Pinchas Lapide's work to be \\"the definitive work by a Jewish scholar\\" on the holocaust.Dalin, p. 10 Even so, in 2000 Pope John Paul II on behalf of all people, apologized to Jews by inserting a prayer at the Western Wall that read \\"We're deeply saddened by the behavior of those in the course of history who have caused the children of God to suffer, and asking your forgiveness, we wish to commit ourselves to genuine brotherhood with the people of the Covenant.\\" This papal apology, one of many issued by Pope John Paul II for past human and Church failings throughout history, was especially significant because John Paul II emphasized Church guilt for, and the Second Vatican Council's condemnation of, anti-Semitism.Bokenkotter, p. 484 The papal letter We Remember: A Reflection on the Shoah, urged Catholics to repent \\"of past errors and infidelities\\" and \\"renew the awareness of the Hebrew roots of their faith.\\" In Poland, the Nazis murdered over 2500 monks and priests while even more were sent to concentration camps.Chadwick, A History of Christianity (1995), pp. 254-5 The Priester-Block (priests barracks) in Dachau concentration camp lists 2600 Roman Catholic priests.Vidmar, The Catholic Church Through the Ages (2005), p. 329 Stalin staged an even more severe persecution at almost the same time. After World War II historians such as David Kertzer accused the Church of encouraging centuries of anti-Semitism, and Pope Pius XII of not doing enough to stop Nazi atrocities. Prominent members of the Jewish community, including Golda Meir, Albert Einstein, Moshe Sharett and Rabbi Isaac Herzog contradicted the criticisms and spoke highly of Pius' efforts to protect Jews, while others such as rabbi David G. Dalin noted that \\"hundreds of thousands\\" of Jews were saved by the Church.Bokenkotter, A Concise History of the Catholic Church (2004), pp. 480-1, quote:\\"A recent article by American rabbi, David G.

Pope Pius XI declared - Mit brennender Sorge - that Fascist governments had hidden \\"pagan intentions\\" and expressed the irreconcilability of the Catholic position and Totalitarian Fascist State Worship, which placed the nation above God and fundamental human rights and dignity. His declaration that \\"Spiritually, [Christians] are all Semites\\" prompted the Nazis to give him the title \\"Chief Rabbi of the Christian World.\\"Derek Holmes, History of the Papacy, p. 116. Catholic priests were executed in concentration camps alongside Jews; for example, 2,600 Catholic Priests were imprisoned in Dachau, and 2,000 of them were executed. A further 2,700 Polish priests were executed (a quarter of all Polish priests), and 5,350 Polish nuns were either displaced, imprisoned, or executed.John Vidmar, The Catholic Church Through the Ages: A History (New York: Paulist Press, 2005), p. 332 & n. 37. Many Catholic laypeople and clergy played notable roles in sheltering Jews during the Holocaust, including Pope Pius XII (1876‚Äì1958). The head rabbi of Rome became a Catholic in 1945 and, in honour of the actions the Pope undertook to save Jewish lives, he took the name Eugenio (the pope's first name).John Vidmar, The Catholic Church Through the Ages: A History (New York: Paulist Press, 2005), p. 332. A former Israeli consul in Italy claimed: \\"The Catholic Church saved more Jewish lives during the war than all the other churches, religious institutions, and rescue organisations put together.\\"Derek Holmes, History of the Papacy, p. 158. Latin America South America, historically Catholic, has experienced a large Evangelical and Pentecostal infusion in the 20th century due to the influx of Christian missionaries from abroad. For example: Brazil, South America's largest country, is the largest Catholic country in the world, and at the same time is the largest Evangelical country in the world (based on population). Some of the largest Christian congregations in the world are found in Brazil. China In 1939, Pope Pius XII, within weeks of his coronation, reverted the 250-year-old Vatican policy and permitted Catholics to practice Confucianism.Franzen 324 The Church began to flourish again with twenty new arch-dioceses, seventy-nine dioceses and thirty-eight apostolic prefects, but only until 1949, when the Communist revolution took over the country.Franzen 325 Second Vatican Council A major event of the Second Vatican Council, known as Vatican II, was the issuance by Pope Paul VI and Orthodox Patriarch Athenagoras of a joint expression of regret for many of the past actions that had led up to the Great Schism between the Western and Eastern churches, expressed as the Catholic- Orthodox Joint declaration of 1965. At the same time, they lifted the mutual excommunications dating from the 11th century. The Catholic Church engaged in a comprehensive process of reform following the Second Vatican Council (1962-65).Duffy, Saints and Sinners (1997), p. 270-6 Intended as a continuation of Vatican I, under Pope John XXIII the council developed into an engine of modernisation. It was tasked with making the historical teachings of the Church clear to a modern world, and made pronouncements on topics including the nature of the church, the mission of the laity and religious freedom. The council approved a revision of the liturgy and permitted the Latin liturgical rites to use vernacular languages as well as Latin during mass and other sacraments. Efforts by the Church to improve Christian unity became a priority.Duffy, Saints and Sinners (1997), p. 274 In addition to finding common ground on certain issues with Protestant churches, the Catholic Church has discussed the possibility of unity with the Eastern Orthodox Church. On 11 October 1962 Pope John XXIII opened the Second Vatican Council, the 21st ecumenical council of the Catholic Church. The council was \\"pastoral\\" in nature, emphasising and clarifying already defined dogma, revising liturgical practices, and providing guidance for articulating traditional Church teachings in contemporary times. The council is perhaps best known for its instructions that the Mass may be celebrated in the vernacular as well as in Latin. At the Second Vatican Council (1962‚Äì1965) the debate on papal primacy and authority re-emerged, and in the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church Lumen gentium, the Roman Catholic Church's teaching on the authority of the Pope, bishops and councils was further elaborated. Vatican II sought to correct the unbalanced ecclesiology left behind by Vatican I. The result is the body of teaching about the papacy and episcopacy contained in the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, Lumen gentium. Vatican II reaffirmed everything Vatican I taught about papal primacy and infallibility, but it added important points about bishops. Bishops, it says, are not \\"vicars of the Roman Pontiff.\\" Rather, in governing their local churches they are \\"vicars and legates of Christ\\".cf. Catechism, nos. 894-95 Together, they form a body, a \\"college,\\" whose head is the pope. This episcopal college is responsible for the well- being of the Universal Church. Here in a nutshell are the basic elements of the Council's much-discussed communio ecclesiology, which affirms the importance of local churches and the doctrine of collegiality. In a key passage about collegiality, Vatican II teaches: \\"The order of bishops is the successor to the college of the apostles in their role as teachers and pastors, and in it the apostolic college is perpetuated. Together with their head, the Supreme Pontiff, and never apart from him, they have supreme and full authority over the Universal Church; but this power cannot be exercised without the agreement of the Roman Pontiff\\".Lumen gentium, 22 Much of the present discussion of papal primacy is concerned with exploring the implications of this passage. Chapter 3 of the dogmatic constitution on the Church of Vatican Council I (Pastor aeternus) is the principal document of the Magisterium about the content and nature of the primatial power of the Roman Pontiff. Chapter 4 is a development and defining of one particular characteristic of this primatial power, namely the Pope's supreme teaching authority, i.e. when the Pope speaks ex cathedra he teaches the doctrine of the faith infallibly. Reforms Changes to old rites and ceremonies following Vatican II produced a variety of responses. Some stopped going to church, while others tried to preserve the old liturgy with the help of sympathetic priests.Bokenkotter, A Concise History of the Catholic Church (2004), p. 410 These formed the basis of today's Traditionalist Catholic groups, which believe that the reforms of Vatican II have gone too far. Liberal Catholics form another dissenting group who feel that the Vatican II reforms did not go far enough. The liberal views of theologians such as Hans K√ºng and Charles Curran, led to Church withdrawal of their authorization to teach as Catholics.Bauckham, Richard, in New Dictionary of Theology, Ed. Ferguson, (1988), p. 373 According to Professor Thomas Bokenkotter, most Catholics \\"accepted the changes more or less gracefully.\\" In 2007, Benedict XVI reinstated the old mass as an option, to be celebrated upon request by the faithful.Apostolic Letter \\"Motu Proprio data\\" Summorum Pontificum on the use of the Roman Liturgy prior to the reform of 1970 (7 July 2007) A new Codex Juris Canonici - Canon Law called for by John XXIII, was promulgated by Pope John Paul II on 25 January 1983. It includes numerous reforms and alterations in Church law and Church discipline for the Latin Church. It replaced the 1917 version issued by Benedict XV. The Catholic Church initiated a comprehensive process of reform under Pope John XXIII.Duffy, pp. 270‚Äì276. Intended as a continuation of the First Vatican Council, the Second Vatican Council (1962‚Äì1965), developed into an engine of modernisation, making pronouncements on religious freedom, the nature of the Church and the mission of the laity. The role of the bishops of the Church was brought into renewed prominence, especially when seen collectively, as a college that has succeeded to that of the Apostles in teaching and governing the Church. This college does not exist without its head, the successor of St. Peter. It also permitted the Latin liturgical rites to use vernacular languages as well as Latin during Mass and other sacraments. Christian unity became a greater priority.Duffy, Saints and Sinners (1997), p. 274. In addition to finding more common ground with Protestant Churches, the Catholic Church has reopened discussions regarding the possibility of unity with the Eastern Orthodox churches. Modernism and Liberation theology In the 1960s, growing social awareness and politicization in the Church in Latin America gave birth to liberation theology. The Peruvian priest, Gustavo Guti√©rrez, became a primary theorist and, in 1979, the bishops' conference in Mexico officially declared the Latin American Church's \\"preferential option for the poor\\".Bokenkotter, pp. 454‚Äì457. Archbishop √ìscar Romero, a supporter of the movement, became the region's most famous contemporary martyr in 1980, when he was murdered by forces allied with the government of El Salvador while saying Mass.Bokenkotter, p. 463. Both Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI (as Cardinal Ratzinger) denounced the movement. The Brazilian theologian-priest Leonardo Boff was twice ordered to cease publishing and teaching. Pope John Paul II was criticized for his severity in dealing with proponents of the movement, but he maintained that the Church, in its efforts to champion the poor, should not do so by advocating violence or engaging in partisan politics. The movement is still alive in Latin America today, although the Church now faces the challenge of Pentecostal revival in much of the region. Sexuality and gender issues The sexual revolution of the 1960s brought challenging issues for the Church. Pope Paul VI's 1968 encyclical Humanae Vitae reaffirmed the Catholic Church's traditional view of marriage and marital relations and asserted a continued proscription of artificial birth control. In addition, the encyclical reaffirmed the sanctity of life from conception to natural death and asserted a continued condemnation of both abortion and euthanasia as grave sins which were equivalent to murder.Norman, The Roman Catholic Church an Illustrated History (2007), p. 184 Ordination of women Efforts to lead the Church to consider the ordination of women led Pope John Paul II to issue two documents to explain Church teaching. Mulieris Dignitatem was issued in 1988 to clarify women's equally important and complementary role in the work of the Church.Bokenkotter, A Concise History of the Catholic Church (2004), p. 467 Then in 1994, Ordinatio Sacerdotalis explained that the Church extends ordination only to men in order to follow the example of Jesus, who chose only men for this specific duty.Pope Benedict XVI, Jesus of Nazareth (2008), pp. 180‚Äì1, quote: \\"The difference between the discipleship of the Twelve and the discipleship of the women is obvious; the tasks assigned to each group are quite different. Yet Luke makes clear‚Äîand the other Gospels also show this in all sorts of ways‚Äîthat 'many' women belonged to the more intimate community of believers and that their faith‚Äîfilled following of Jesus was an essential element of that community, as would be vividly illustrated at the foot of the Cross and the Resurrection.\\" Humanae vitae The sexual revolution of the 1960s precipitated Pope Paul VI's 1968 encyclical Humanae vitae (On Human Life), which rejected the use of contraception, including sterilization, claiming these work against the intimate relationship and moral order of husband and wife by directly opposing God's will. It approved Natural Family Planning as a legitimate means to limit family size. Abortion was condemned by the Church as early as the 1st century, again in the 14th century and again in 1995 with Pope John Paul II's encyclical Evangelium vitae (Gospel of Life).Bokenkotter, p. 27, p. 154, pp. 493‚Äì494. This encyclical condemned the \\"culture of death\\" which the pope often used to describe the societal embrace of contraception, abortion, euthanasia, suicide, capital punishment, and genocide. The Church's rejection of the use of condoms has provoked criticism, especially with respect to countries where the incidence of AIDS and HIV has reached epidemic proportions. The Church maintains that in countries like Kenya and Uganda, where behavioral changes are encouraged alongside condom use, greater progress in controlling the disease has been made than in those countries solely promoting condoms. Feminists disagreed with these and other Church teachings and worked together with a coalition of American nuns to lead the Church to consider the ordination of women.Bokenkotter, pp. 465‚Äì466. They stated that many of the major Church documents were supposedly full of anti- female prejudice and a number of studies were conducted to discover how this supposed prejudice developed when it was deemed contrary to the openness of Jesus. These events led Pope John Paul II to issue the 1988 encyclical Mulieris dignitatem (On the Dignity of Women), which declared that women had a different, yet equally important role in the Church.Bokenkotter, p. 467. In 1994 the encyclical Ordinatio sacerdotalis (On Ordination to the Priesthood) further explained that the Church follows the example of Jesus, who chose only men for the specific priestly duty. Modern response to Protestantism Well into the 20th century, Catholics‚Äîeven if no longer resorting to persecution‚Äîstill defined Protestants as heretics. Thus, Hilaire Belloc - in his time one of the most conspicuous speakers for Catholicism in Britain - was outspoken about the \\"Protestant heresy\\". He also defined Islam as \\"A Christian heresy\\", on the grounds that Muslims accept many of the tenets of Christianity but deny the godhood of Jesus (see Hilaire Belloc#On Islam). In the second half of the century - and especially in the wake of Vatican II - the Catholic Church, in the spirit of ecumenism, no longer referred to Protestantism as a heresy, even if the teachings of Protestantism are heretical from a Catholic perspective. Modern usage favors referring to Protestants as \\"separated brethren\\" rather than \\"heretics\\". The latter term is occasionally applied to Catholics who abandon their Church to join a Protestant denomination. Many Catholics consider most Protestants to be material rather than formal heretics, and thus non-culpable. Among the doctrines of Protestantism that the Catholic Church considers heretical are the beliefs that: the Bible is the only source and rule of faith (\\"sola scriptura\\"), faith alone can lead to salvation (\\"sola fide\\"), and no sacramental, ministerial priesthood is attained by ordination, but there is a universal priesthood of all believers. Catholic-Orthodox dialogue Ecumenism broadly refers to movements between Christian groups to establish a degree of unity through dialogue. \\"Ecumenism\\" is derived from Greek (oikoumene), which means \\"the inhabited world\\", but more figuratively something like \\"universal oneness.\\" The movement can be distinguished into Catholic and Protestant movements, with the latter characterised by a redefined ecclesiology of \\"denominationalism\\" (which the Catholic Church, among others, rejects). Over the last century, a number of moves have been made to reconcile the schism between the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox churches. Although progress has been made, concerns over papal primacy and the independence of the smaller Orthodox churches has blocked a final resolution of the schism. Some of the most difficult questions in relations with the ancient Eastern Churches concern some doctrine (i.e. Filioque, Scholasticism, functional purposes of asceticism, the essence of God, Hesychasm, Fourth Crusade, establishment of the Latin Empire, Uniatism to note but a few) as well as practical matters, such as the concrete exercise of the claim to papal primacy and how to ensure that ecclesiastical union would not result in absorption of the smaller Churches by the Latin component of the much larger Catholic Church (the most numerous single religious denomination in the world). Both parties wanted to avoid the stifling or abandonment of the other churches' rich theological, liturgical and cultural heritage. With respect to Catholic relations with Protestant communities, certain commissions were established to foster dialogue, and documents have been published that address points of doctrinal unity, such as the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification produced with the Lutheran World Federation in 1999. Joint Theological Commission The Joint International Commission for Theological Dialogue Between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church first met in Rhodes in 1980. Other moves toward reconciliation In June 1995, Patriarch Bartholomew I, who was elected as the 273rd Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople in October 1991, visited the Vatican for the first time, when he joined in the historic inter-religious day of prayer for peace at Assisi. Pope John Paul II and the Patriarch explicitly stated their mutual \\"desire to relegate the excommunications of the past to oblivion and to set out on the way to re-establishing full communion.\\" In May 1999, John Paul II traveled to Romania: the first pope since the Great Schism to visit an Eastern Orthodox country. Upon greeting John Paul II, the Romanian Patriarch Teoctist stated: \\"The second millennium of Christian history began with a painful wounding of the unity of the Church; the end of this millennium has seen a real commitment to restoring Christian unity.\\" Pope John Paul II visited other strongly Orthodox areas such as Ukraine, despite lack of welcome at times. He said that healing the divisions between Western and Eastern Christianity was one of his fondest wishes.

The complete title is: The UnDutchables: an observation of the Netherlands, its culture and its inhabitants. The book was first published in 1989, has been a best-seller in the Netherlands since 1990 and is also popular in North America, the United Kingdom, Australia, and former Dutch colonies. To remain current, it is updated every 2‚Äì4 years. The book has been translated into Dutch and traditional Chinese (Ëç∑Ëò≠‰∏çÂî¨Áàõ). Authors When the book was first released, the authors had spent a cumulative total of 22 years living in the Netherlands. Colin White (British) lived and worked there for 7 years, and Laurie Boucke (American) lived and worked there for 15 years. Overview There is no plot and the book is not a travel guide. Instead, the authors subject the Netherlands and the Dutch to an irreverent and unmerciful scrutiny. The UnDutchables takes an in-depth humorous look at daily Dutch life, quirks and character, with subjects varying from coffee drinking habits to child rearing, and from train travel to the toilet. The Dutch press refers to the book as a laughing mirror. Popular culture The name ‚ÄúThe UnDutchables‚Äù has been used by numerous entities including a radio program in New Zealand, sports teams, a rock band, an employment agency, an online chat group, a theatrical play, nightclub, firmware, and many videos on YouTube. In 2004 White-Boucke Publishing acquired a Trademark registration for the name ‚ÄúUnDutchables‚Äù and for a line of UnDutchables merchandise that includes a Dutch-style perpetual birthday calendar, a desk calendar with daily jokes, coffee mugs, T-shirts and pens. History In 1987 near the end of a long stay in the Netherlands, Laurie Boucke had the idea to write an in-depth humor book about that country. At the time, there were no books of this genre readily available. Laurie Boucke began formulating the structure and text during the authors‚Äô last months as Dutch residents. Colin White joined the project when his interest was piqued by the advent of desktop publishing. New editions have been published in 1989, 1991, 1993, 2001, 2006, 2010, 2013 and 2017. The first edition appeared in a comic book / magazine format (8.5\\" x 11\\") with 80 pages. Subsequent editions have been in a more standard book format, with the most recent edition being 312 pages in length and consisting of 21 chapters. In 1989, renowned Dutch journalist Johannes van Dam spotted the book in the front window of the Athenaeum bookstore in Amsterdam and wrote a review for the Dutch daily Het Parool. In his review he wrote that the book ‚Äúin a very exact yet funny way discloses all the secrets about us that we really would have preferred to keep to ourselves.‚Äù This review launched the book in the Netherlands. There have been many subsequent reviews. For example, in 1991, de Telegraaf called the book a ‚Äúlaughing mirror: readers can only laugh as they concede their ridiculous habits.‚Äù Later, The European called the book ‚Äúa cult among English-speaking expatriates‚Äù and the Washington Post described it as ‚Äúa sometimes funny, sometimes scathing portrayal of Dutch national habits.‚Äù Film rights were optioned in 1996 when a studio hoped to sign John Cleese as the main presenter, but Cleese was not available, and the film rights are again available.

Brooks and illustrated by Kurt Wiese. It tells how animals in New York State rebel against humans, destroying property and taking control of farms. At the same time, Freddy‚Äôs friend Mr. Camphor is pressured into running for governor. The situations collide when animals take over Camphor‚Äôs estate, imprisoning the political figures there. Author Brooks was in ill health. There is an element of finality toward the end of the story, as Freddy‚Äôs foe Mr. Garble (encountered 13 books and 13 years before) is at last jailed. All animals are given the right to vote in human elections. Uncharacteristically foretelling, Brooks writes that years later Freddy is elected mayor of Centerboro. (p. 243) Elements of its plot are similar to George Orwell's 1945 novel Animal Farm. Plot summary The local rabbits have been much help to the Bean animals, so it is a surprise that some are vandalizing and stealing. Confronted, instead of apologizing, a rabbit criticizes Mrs. Bean, then gives ridiculous evidence that her husband was eaten by the Beans. Freddy and Jinx the cat investigate, discovering that the Grimby house in the woods next to the farm is used for political meetings. The speaker, inside a mechanical man that amplifies and distorts his voice, encourages the animal assembly to be \\"free\\" of humans. Freddy guesses their foe Mr. Garble is behind it. The A.B.I. (Animal Bureau of Investigation) is alerted to watch. Freddy‚Äôs friend Mr. Camphor is asked to run for governor. This does not suit him (\\"I could sound like a fine governor, if I didn‚Äôt have to do any governing.\\" p. 32). Camphor asks Freddy to visit the political meeting at his mansion, to say bad things about Camphor‚Äôs suitability. The pig, in his disguise as Dr. Hopper, invents faults, including that Camphor giggles in church and during speeches. But the political committee manages to see the bright side of these faults. Money was stolen, and Mr. Bean‚Äôs handkerchief found at the crime scene. Since Mr. Bean‚Äôs laundry was stolen by rabbits, Freddy suspects a plot to organize animals against humans, telling lies that might be eventually believed. Miss Anguish, Camphor‚Äôs sister, is one of the guests. Her thinking is spacey, but it may be an act. She states that Freddy is a Hollywood film director. (So now Freddy is dealing with three odd sorts of thinking at once.) Freddy tries convincing the committee again that Camphor is an unsuitable candidate: He proposes that all animals be given the right to vote! While the committee is deliberating, Freddy investigates the money theft. Before he can collect evidence, Mr. Bean is jailed. Camphor joins the local Indian tribe to hide. Jinx discovers Simon the rat has returned, and with Mr. Garble is encouraging all animals to revolt and take control of farms from humans. To infiltrate the group, Jinx determines to pretend he has joined the revolution. Freddy and Camphor‚Äôs butler, Bannister, are unable to convince Camphor to return; he has disguised himself as an Indian. The A.B.I. discovers the hideout where Garble is managing the revolution. They capture him, and smash the mechanical man used to make speeches. It is too late to stop the revolution, however. Farms are taken over, including the Bean farm, which is then run by Jinx. Since the Bean animals do not know Jinx is undercover, he takes considerable abuse. To strike at the revolution, Freddy gets the cooperation of the captured Garble by convincing him that the Indians will burn him at the stake. Then Freddy turns to Simon, and for a while follows Jinx‚Äôs lead ‚Äî only to trick Simon into sitting a cage disguised as a throne. With Simon out of the way, Camphor decides to appeal directly to the animals of the revolution, promising them the right to vote ‚Äî which will make them the equals of people. This strikes a chord, and the revolution falters. Employing the aid of the dogs, who have generally stay loyal to their human masters, the farms are gradually recovered. Garble escapes. He captures Freddy, Miss Anguish and Jinx, holding them for ransom. Miss Anguish tries to confuse their captors, but finally in desperation they set a fire to attract attention. Garble is recaptured and sent to prison. Simon and his criminal family are packed in a crate that is indefinitely shipped from place to place. The revolution fails. With the animal vote, Camphor becomes governor. Illustrations There are 38 black and white, pen and ink drawings by Kurt Wiese, endpapers, and a full color cover, both depicting scenes from the book.

Born in Tenterfield, New South Wales, and trained in Canberra and Sydney, Bancroft worked as a fashion designer, and is an artist, illustrator, and arts administrator. In 1985, Bancroft established a shop called Designer Aboriginals, selling fabrics made by Aboriginal artists including herself. She was a founding member of Boomalli Aboriginal Artists Co-operative. Art work by Bancroft is held by the National Gallery of Australia, the Art Gallery of New South Wales and the Art Gallery of Western Australia. She has provided art work for more than 20 children's books, including Stradbroke Dreamtime by writer and activist Oodgeroo Noonuccal, and books by artist and writer Sally Morgan. She has received design commissions, including one for the exterior of a sports centre in Sydney. Bancroft has a long history of involvement in community activism and arts administration, and has served as a board member for the National Gallery of Australia. Her painting Prevention of AIDS (1992) was used in a campaign to raise awareness of HIV/AIDS in Australia. Bancroft has served on the boards of copyright collection agency Viscopy and Tranby Aboriginal College, and the Artists Board at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney. Early life A Bundjalung woman, Bancroft was born in Tenterfield, a town in rural New South Wales, in 1958. She was the youngest of seven children of Owen Cecil Joseph Bancroft, known as \\"Bill\\"‚Äîan Aboriginal Australian from the Djanbun clan‚Äîand Dot, who is of Scottish and Polish ancestry. Bancroft has said that her great-great-great-grandmother Pemau was one of only two or three survivors from her clan, the rest murdered when their land was settled by a white farmer. Her grandfather and uncle worked in local goldmines. She recalled that her father's education was obstructed by discrimination because he was Aboriginal. His lack of formal training meant that he had to work away from home cutting railway sleepers, while her mother worked at home as a dressmaker. Bancroft's father was an engineer during World War II, managing barges at Madang and Rabaul. Following her father's advice on the importance of getting an education or a trade, Bancroft completed high school in Tenterfield before moving to Canberra in 1976 with her husband-to-be Ned Manning, who had also been her teacher. There Bancroft completed a Diploma of Visual Communications through the Canberra School of Art, followed by a Master of Studio Practice and a Master of Visual Arts (Paintings) at the University of Sydney. She never returned to live in Tenterfield, although her three sisters were living there in 2004. Her father died around 1990. Bancroft has three children: Jack was born in 1985, Ella in 1988. She separated from Manning when they were very young; her third child Rubyrose was born in 1999. Jack was awarded NSW Young Australian of the Year in 2010 for his work arranging the mentoring of Indigenous school students. Career=Art and design Bancroft was a founding member of the Boomalli Aboriginal Artists Co-operative, one of Australia's oldest Indigenous-run artists' organisations, established in 1987. She served in the roles of chairperson, director, and treasurer during its first two decades. In 1985, she opened a shop in Sydney called Designer Aboriginals, selling the work of designers including her own fabrics, and staffed by her Indigenous female students. Bancroft, Euphemia Bostock and Mini Heath were the first Australian fashion designers invited to show their works in Paris, where Bancroft's painted designs on cloth were exhibited at the 1987 Printemps Fashion Parade. Two years later, in 1989, she contributed to a London exhibition, Australian Fashion: The Contemporary Art. Despite these successes, she moved away from the fashion industry, telling an interviewer in 2005 that she had not done fabric design for 15 years. Described as \\"an instinctive colourist\\", Bancroft has since worked primarily as a painter, and has developed \\"a glowing style reminiscent of stained glass windows\\". She has cited as influences the American painter Georgia O'Keeffe, European painters Joan Mir√≥, Wassily Kandinsky, and Marc Chagall, and Australian Indigenous artists such as Emily Kngwarreye, Rover Thomas, and Mary MacLean. Although initially known as a fabric and textile designer, Bancroft has worked with many artistic media, including \\"jewellery design, painting, collage, illustration, sculpture and interior decoration\\". Art works by Bancroft are held by the National Gallery of Australia, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the Art Gallery of Western Australia and the Queensland Art Gallery. The National Gallery holds one of her screenprints, Entrapped, created in 1991. Between 1989 and 2006, Bancroft held eight solo exhibitions and participated in at least 53 group exhibitions, including shows at the Australian Museum in Sydney, the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra, and the National Gallery of Victoria. Her art has been exhibited in Indonesia, New Zealand, the US, France and Germany. In 2004, Bancroft was commissioned to design a large mural covering the exterior of a sports centre housing two basketball courts at Tempe Reserve in Marrickville, New South Wales. The mural depicts a snake, a man, and a woman, representing both biblical and Indigenous Australian creation stories. It also includes the goanna, the ancestral totem of the Marrickville area's original inhabitants, the Wangal people. Bancroft ventured into illustrating children's books in 1993, when she provided the artwork for Fat and Juicy Place written by Dianna Kidd. The book was shortlisted for the Children's Book Council of Australia's Book of the Year and won the Australian Multicultural Children's Book Award. In the same year, she illustrated Stradbroke Dreamtime by Indigenous activist and writer Oodgeroo Noonuccal. She was the third artist to have provided images for successive editions of the book, of which the first edition was released in 1972. Bancroft has since contributed artwork for over 20 children's books, including some by prominent Australian writer and artist Sally Morgan, whom she regards as a mentor and friend. These books include Dan's grandpa (1996) and Sam's bush journey (2009). The two artists collaborated on an exhibition of prints at Warrnambool Art Gallery in Victoria in 1991. Researcher and museum curator Margo Neale has described the art of both Bancroft and Morgan as depicting \\"their relationship to country and family in generally high-keyed works, celebrating and commemorating through personal or collective stories in mainly figurative narratives.\\" As well as working with established writers, Bancroft has created a number of children's books in her own right, including An Australian 1 2 3 of Animals and An Australian ABC of Animals, which have been favourably reviewed as imaginative and well-illustrated. Her style of illustration has been described as \\"bold and mysterious\\", and as \\"traditional Australian Aboriginal representation rendered in bright, eye-catching colors.\\" In 2009 Bancroft received the Dromkeen Medal for her contribution to children's literature. In May 2010, the Governor-General of Australia Quentin Bryce launched Bancroft's latest book, Why I Love Australia. A long-time supporter of Bancroft's work, Ms Bryce said: \\"Why I love Australia is a work and title that, again, speaks volumes of its author and illustrator. It simply and exquisitely rejoices in telling a story of this magnificent, sacred land we share: the mountains, rivers and gorges; seas and coral reefs; grasslands and bushlands; saltpans and snow; houses and streets; the jeweled night sky, and so much more.\\" Bancroft's art has also appeared in the publications of a number of other individuals and organisations, including as cover art for books from the Australian Museum and the New South Wales Education Department, for Larissa Behrendt's novel Home, and for Roberta Sykes's controversial autobiographical narratives Snake Cradle and Snake Dancing, among others. Administration and activism Bancroft has been active in arts organisations, and served two terms on the board of the National Gallery of Australia during the 1990s. She was chair of the Visual Arts Board of the New South Wales Ministry for the Arts, and of the National Indigenous Arts Advocacy Organisation from 1993 to 1996. In the lead-up to the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Bancroft was a member of the design committee that advised on the development of the games' official logo, and has acted as a judge for the $35,000 Country Energy Art Prize. Bancroft was a member of the board of directors of the Australian copyright collection agency, Viscopy, and while serving in that position has been an advocate of resale royalty rights for artists. She has observed that \\"resale royalties are an intrinsic link to the improvement of the inherent rights of Australian artists to a fair income\\". She was a member of the Sydney Museum of Contemporary Art's Artist Advisory Group in 2005, and is a member of the Museum's Artists Board. She has served on the board of the Indigenous training organisation, Tranby Aboriginal College. Within and beyond her artistic works, Bancroft has demonstrated concern for a range of social issues, particularly those affecting Indigenous Australians. Her painting Prevention of AIDS (1992) was reproduced on posters and postcards aimed at raising awareness of HIV/AIDS, and was one of several of her images commissioned by the federal Department of Health to highlight issues regarding the disease in the Indigenous community. In 2000, two years after the death of activist Mum (Shirl) Smith, Bancroft and the Boomalli Aboriginal Artists Co-operative organised a fund-raising exhibition of art works in Smith's honour. Bancroft is a director of the Australian Indigenous Mentoring Experience, a not-for-profit organisation that aims to increase senior high school and university admission rates for Indigenous students. She has taught and mentored Indigenous school students such as Jessica Birk, a winner of the Australia Council's inaugural Emerging and Young Artist Award in May 2009.

The choice of that algebra still varies from theory to theory. As a result of this change some variables that are usually continuous may become discrete. Often only such discrete variables are called \\"quantized\\"; usage varies. The idea of quantum spacetime was proposed in the early days of quantum theory by Heisenberg and Ivanenko as a way to eliminate infinities from quantum field theory. The germ of the idea passed from Heisenberg to Rudolf Peierls, who noted that electrons in a magnetic field can be regarded as moving in a quantum space-time, and to Robert Oppenheimer, who carried it to Hartland Snyder, who published the first concrete example. Snyder's Lie algebra was made simple by C. N. Yang in the same year. Overview Physical spacetime is a quantum spacetime when in quantum mechanics position and momentum variables x,p are already noncommutative, obey the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and are continuous. Because of the Heisenberg uncertainty relations, greater energy is needed to probe smaller distances. Ultimately, according to gravity theory, the probing particles form black holes that destroy what was to be measured. The process cannot be repeated, so it cannot be counted as a measurement. This limited measurability led many to expect that our usual picture of continuous commutative spacetime breaks down at Planck scale distances, if not sooner. Again, physical spacetime is expected to be quantum because physical coordinates are already slightly noncommutative. The astronomical coordinates of a star are modified by gravitational fields between us and the star, as in the deflection of light by the sun, one of the classic tests of general relativity. Therefore, the coordinates actually depend on gravitational field variables. According to quantum theories of gravity these field variables do not commute; therefore coordinates that depend on them likely do not commute. Both arguments are based on pure gravity and quantum theory, and they limit the measurement of time by the only time constant in pure quantum gravity, the Planck time. Our instruments, however, are not purely gravitational but are made of particles. They may set a more severe, larger, limit than the Planck time. Criteria Quantum spacetimes are often described mathematically using the noncommutative geometry of Connes, quantum geometry, or quantum groups. Any noncommutative algebra with at least four generators could be interpreted as a quantum spacetime, but the following desiderata have been suggested: * Local Lorentz group and Poincar√© group symmetries should be retained, possibly in a generalised form. Their generalisation often takes the form of a quantum group acting on the quantum spacetime algebra. * The algebra might plausibly arise in an effective description of quantum gravity effects in some regime of that theory. For example, a physical parameter \\\\lambda, perhaps the Planck length, might control the deviation from commutative classical spacetime, so that ordinary Lorentzian spacetime arises as \\\\lambda\\\\to 0. * There might be a notion of quantum differential calculus on the quantum spacetime algebra, compatible with the (quantum) symmetry and preferably reducing to the usual differential calculus as \\\\lambda\\\\to 0. This would permit wave equations for particles and fields and facilitate predictions for experimental deviations from classical spacetime physics that can then be tested experimentally. * The Lie algebra should be semisimple.Yang, I. E. Segal 1947 This makes it easier to formulate a finite theory. Models Several models were found in the 1990s more or less meeting most of the above criteria.  Bicrossproduct model spacetime  The bicrossproduct model spacetime was introduced by Shahn Majid and Henri Ruegg and has Lie algebra relations : [x_i,x_j]=0,\\\\quad [x_i, t]=i \\\\lambda x_i for the spatial variables x_i and the time variable t. Here \\\\lambda has dimensions of time and is therefore expected to be something like the Planck time. The Poincar√© group here is correspondingly deformed, now to a certain bicrossproduct quantum group with the following characteristic features. Orbits for the action of the Lorentz group on momentum space in the construction of the bicrossproduct model in units of \\\\lambda^{-1}. Mass-shell hyperboloids are 'squashed' into a cylinder. The momentum generators p_i commute among themselves but addition of momenta, reflected in the quantum group structure, is deformed (momentum space becomes a non-abelian group). Meanwhile, the Lorentz group generators enjoy their usual relations among themselves but act non-linearly on the momentum space. The orbits for this action are depicted in the figure as a cross-section of p_0 against one of the p_i. The on-shell region describing particles in the upper center of the image would normally be hyperboloids but these are now 'squashed' into the cylinder : \\\\sqrt{p_1^2+p_2^2+p_3^2}< \\\\lambda^{-1} \\\\, in simplified units. The upshot is that Lorentz-boosting a momentum will never increase it above the Planck momentum. The existence of a highest momentum scale or lowest distance scale fits the physical picture. This squashing comes from the non-linearity of the Lorentz boost and is an endemic feature of bicrossproduct quantum groups known since their introduction in 1988. Some physicists dub the bicrossproduct model doubly special relativity, since it sets an upper limit to both speed and momentum. Another consequence of the squashing is that the propagation of particles is deformed, even of light, leading to a variable speed of light. This prediction requires the particular p_0,p_i to be the physical energy and spatial momentum (as opposed to some other function of them). Arguments for this identification were provided in 1999 by Giovanni Amelino-Camelia and Majid through a study of plane waves for a quantum differential calculus in the model. They take the form : e^{i \\\\sum_ip_ix_i} e^{i p_0 t} \\\\, in other words a form which is sufficiently close to classical that one might plausibly believe the interpretation. At the moment such wave analysis represents the best hope to obtain physically testable predictions from the model. Prior to this work there were a number of unsupported claims to make predictions from the model based solely on the form of the Poincar√© quantum group. There were also claims based on an earlier \\\\kappa-Poincar√© quantum group introduced by Jurek Lukierski and co-workers which should be viewed as an important precursor to the bicrossproduct one, albeit without the actual quantum spacetime and with different proposed generators for which the above picture does not apply. The bicrossproduct model spacetime has also been called \\\\kappa-deformed spacetime with \\\\kappa=\\\\lambda^{-1}.  q-Deformed spacetime  This model was introduced independently by a team working under Julius Wess in 1990 and by Shahn Majid and coworkers in a series of papers on braided matrices starting a year later. The point of view in the second approach is that usual Minkowski spacetime has a nice description via Pauli matrices as the space of 2 x 2 hermitian matrices. In quantum group theory and using braided monoidal category methods one has a natural q-version of this defined here for real values of q as a 'braided hermitian matrix' of generators and relations : \\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\alpha & \\\\beta\\\\ \\\\gamma &\\\\delta\\\\end{pmatrix}=\\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\alpha & \\\\beta\\\\ \\\\gamma &\\\\delta\\\\end{pmatrix}^\\\\dagger,\\\\quad \\\\beta\\\\alpha=q^2\\\\alpha\\\\beta,\\\\ [\\\\alpha,\\\\delta]=0,\\\\ [\\\\beta,\\\\gamma]=(1-q^{-2})\\\\alpha(\\\\delta-\\\\alpha),\\\\ [\\\\delta,\\\\beta]=(1-q^{-2})\\\\alpha\\\\beta These relations say that the generators commute as q\\\\to 1 thereby recovering usual Minkowski space. One can work with more familiar variables x,y,z,t as linear combinations of these. In particular, time : t = \\\\text{Trace}_q \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\alpha & \\\\beta\\\\ \\\\gamma &\\\\delta\\\\end{pmatrix} = q\\\\delta+q^{-1}\\\\alpha is given by a natural braided trace of the matrix and commutes with the other generators (so this model has a very different flavour from the bicrossproduct one). The braided- matrix picture also leads naturally to a quantity : {\\\\det}_q\\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\alpha & \\\\beta\\\\ \\\\gamma &\\\\delta\\\\end{pmatrix}=\\\\alpha\\\\delta-q^2\\\\gamma\\\\beta which as q\\\\to 1 returns us the usual Minkowski distance (this translates to a metric in the quantum differential geometry). The parameter q=e^{\\\\lambda} or q=e^{i \\\\lambda} is dimensionless and \\\\lambda is thought to be a ratio of the Planck scale and the cosmological length. That is, there are indications that this model relates to quantum gravity with non-zero cosmological constant, the choice of q depending on whether this is positive or negative. We have described the mathematically better understood but perhaps less physically justified positive case here. A full understanding of this model requires (and was concurrent with the development of) a full theory of 'braided linear algebra' for such spaces. The momentum space for the theory is another copy of the same algebra and there is a certain 'braided addition' of momentum on it expressed as the structure of a braided Hopf algebra or quantum group in a certain braided monoidal category). This theory by 1993 had provided the corresponding q-deformed Poincar√© group as generated by such translations and q-Lorentz transformations, completing the interpretation as a quantum spacetime. In the process it was discovered that the Poincar√© group not only had to be deformed but had to be extended to include dilations of the quantum spacetime. For such a theory to be exact we would need all particles in the theory to be massless, which is consistent with experiment as masses of elementary particles are indeed vanishingly small compared to the Planck mass. If current thinking in cosmology is correct then this model is more appropriate, but it is significantly more complicated and for this reason its physical predictions have yet to be worked out.  Fuzzy or spin model spacetime  This refers in modern usage to the angular momentum algebra : [x_1,x_2]= 2 i \\\\lambda x_3,\\\\ [x_2,x_3]= 2 i \\\\lambda x_1,\\\\ [x_3,x_1]= 2 i \\\\lambda x_2 familiar from quantum mechanics but interpreted in this context as coordinates of a quantum space or spacetime. These relations were proposed by Roger Penrose in his earliest spin network theory of space. It is a toy model of quantum gravity in 3 spacetime dimensions (not the physical 4) with a Euclidean (not the physical Minkowskian) signature. It was again proposed in this context by Gerardus 't Hooft. A further development including a quantum differential calculus and an action of a certain 'quantum double' quantum group as deformed Euclidean group of motions was given by Majid and E. Batista A striking feature of the noncommutative geometry here is that the smallest covariant quantum differential calculus has one dimension higher than expected, namely 4, suggesting that the above can also be viewed as the spatial part of a 4-dimensional quantum spacetime. The model should not be confused with fuzzy spheres which are finite-dimensional matrix algebras which one can think of as spheres in the spin model spacetime of fixed radius.  Heisenberg model spacetimes  The quantum spacetime of Hartland Snyder proposes that : [x_\\\\mu,x_ u]= i M_{\\\\mu u} where the M_{\\\\mu u} generate the Lorentz group. This quantum spacetime and that of C. N. Yang entail a radical unification of spacetime, energy-momentum, and angular momentum. The idea was revived in a modern context by Sergio Doplicher, Klaus Fredenhagen and John Roberts in 1995 by letting M_{\\\\mu u} simply be viewed as some function of x_\\\\mu as defined by the above relation, and any relations involving it viewed as higher order relations among the x_\\\\mu. The Lorentz symmetry is arranged so as to transform the indices as usual and without being deformed. An even simpler variant of this model is to let M here be a numerical antisymmetric tensor, in which context it is usually denoted \\\\theta, so the relations are [x_\\\\mu,x_ u]= i \\\\theta_{\\\\mu u}. In even dimensions D, any nondegenerate such theta can be transformed to a normal form in which this really is just the Heisenberg algebra but the difference that the variables are being proposed as those of spacetime. This proposal was for a time quite popular because of its familiar form of relations and because it has been argued that it emerges from the theory of open strings landing on D-branes, see noncommutative quantum field theory and Moyal plane. However, it should be realised that this D-brane lives in some of the higher spacetime dimensions in the theory and hence it is not our physical spacetime that string theory suggests to be effectively quantum in this way. You also have to subscribe to D-branes as an approach to quantum gravity in the first place. Even when posited as quantum spacetime it is hard to obtain physical predictions and one reason for this is that if \\\\theta is a tensor then by dimensional analysis it should have dimensions of length{}^2, and if this length is speculated to be the Planck length then the effects would be even harder to ever detect than for other models.  Noncommutative extensions to spacetime  Although not quantum spacetime in the sense above, another use of noncommutative geometry is to tack on 'noncommutative extra dimensions' at each point of ordinary spacetime. Instead of invisible curled up extra dimensions as in string theory, Alain Connes and coworkers have argued that the coordinate algebra of this extra part should be replaced by a finite-dimensional noncommutative algebra. For a certain reasonable choice of this algebra, its representation and extended Dirac operator, one is able to recover the Standard Model of elementary particles. In this point of view the different kinds of matter particles are manifestations of geometry in these extra noncommutative directions. Connes's first works here date from 1989 but has been developed considerably since then. Such an approach can theoretically be combined with quantum spacetime as above.

He is a neo-expressionistic, lyrical abstract painter, gouache designer and printmaker. He was educated at the Academy of Brussels (1940‚Äì47 and 1949‚Äì50) and in Sint-Joost-ten-Node and the Vrije Atelier of Sint-Lambrechts-Woluwe. He debuted with wonderful expressionistic still life, reminiscent of Jean Brusselmans. Much early work dealt with stills of vegetables. Later Wyckaert became interested by William Turner and James Ensor and their ideas of luminism. In 1955 Wyckaert started to lyrically abstract interpret his environment, which contained noticeable influences of Eastern calligraphy. From this, he evolved to a dynamic abstract combination of attractive colors, which harmoniously shape a free interpretation of landscape. Although Wyckaert was already critically acclaimed, by receiving several honors such as the Jules Raeymaekers of the Royal Academy Award, an honorable mention by JPB (1957) and an honorable mention by Sao Paulo Art Biennial (1961), his true breakthrough began at the beginning of the 1970s. Around this time he started experimenting with gouache, printmaking and lithography. Wyckaert was known for his pro-active involvement in several art movements such as being the Co- founder of Belgian art magazine De Meridiaan and Taptoe Brussels (1955). Also he was a member of Pr√©sence (1949), the Situationist International (SI) and the International Movement for an Imaginist BauhausLetter and well known for his influence and intimate friendship with several CoBrA-members. He was honored by the SI to read the Declaration in the Name of the Fourth SI Conference to the Institute of Contemporary Arts, at the Institute of Contemporary Arts on 28 September 1960. After the city of Brussels started with art projects to enhance their underground, Wyckaert was appointed to decorate the Jacques Brel metro station. He has exhibited his work in several renowned museums from Rome to Sao Paulo. Chief Editor of 'De Meridiaan' De Meridiaan, later published as De kunst-meridiaan, was a Flemish literary magazine that published bimonthly in Belgium and the Netherlands from 1951 until 1960. It was founded by Belgian artist Maurice Wyckaert, poet Clara Haesaert and her husband Gentil Haesaert. De Meridiaan was the main competitor of Tijd en Mens, another literary magazine. Because of its success the magazine evolved from a basic regional magazine to a well-known international art magazine. In 1955 De Meridiaan founded Galerie Taptoe, an artistic centrum, exhibition room and literary caf√© in Brussels.

He hailed from Harestua in Lunner. At the age of twenty he joined the resistance Osvald Group. He went through some initial training and performed sabotage missions in Hadeland before being hired as a guard in the Communist Party of Norway. The party was strictly illegal, and had a secret base in Hemsedal. On 30 October 1942 the guard hut was attacked by German soldiers and Monsrud and fellow resistance fighter Finn Eriksen were captured. Monsrud was incarcerated at Grini from 2 to 24 November, then at M√∏llergata 19 until February 1943. He went through torture, but survived. Finn Eriksen, who had suffered a gunshot wound, died of the trauma three months later. The Osvald Group later split with the Communist Party, and Monsrud joined Milorg, working for the Secret Intelligence Service with the illegal radio transmitter Gullfaks. Named after Gullfaxi of Norse mythology, Gullfaks was operated from different places in B√¶rumsmarka and Nordmarka until the liberation of 8 May 1945. For his efforts the mountain Monsrudnabben in the Heimefrontfjella range in Antarctica was named in his honour. After the war Monsrud took forester's education at Kongsberg. In 1949 he started working as a forester for Oslo municipality. He was eventually promoted to municipal consultant for wild game. He lived in Maridalen. He struggled throughout his life with nightmares caused by war and torture, and died in December 2009.

The first implementation powered by LGTE was the search engine of DIGMAP, a project co-funded by the community programme eContentplus between 2006 and 2008, which was aimed to provide services available on the web over old digitized maps from a group of partners over Europe including several National Libraries. The tool LGTE is built in Java Programming Language around the Lucene library for full-text search and introduces several extensions for dealing with geographical and temporal information. The package also includes utilities for information retrieval evaluation, such as classes for handling CLEF/TREC (Cross Language Evaluation For√∫m/Text Retrieval Conference) topics and document collections. Technically LGTE is a layer on the top of Lucene and provides an extended Lucene API to integrate several services like snippets generation, query expansion, and many others. The LGTE provides the chance to implement new probabilistic models. The API depends on a set of modifications at the Lucene level, originally created by the researchers of the University of Amsterdam in a software tool named Lucene-lm developed by the group of Information and Language Processing Systems (ILPS). At the time, the tool was tested with success for the Okapi BM25 model, and a multinomial language model, but also includes divergence from randomness models. The LGTE 1.1.9 and later versions also provide the possibility to isolate the index fields in different index folders. Another recent feature is the configuration of Hierarchic Indexes using foreign key fields. This gives the chance to create scores for example based on the text of the sentence combined with the general score of the entire page. Features * Provides Isolated Fields using different folders * Provides Hierarchic indexes through foreign key fields * Provides classes to parse documents using Yahoo PlaceMaker * Provides a simple and effective abstraction layer on top of Lucene * Supports integrated retrieval and ranking with basis on thematic, temporal and geographical aspects. * Supports the Lucene standard retrieval model, as well as the more advanced probabilistic retrieval approaches. * Supports Rochio Query Expansion. * Provides a framework for IR evaluation experiments (e.g. handling CLEF/TREC topics). * Includes a Java alternative to the trec_eval tool, capable of performing significance tests over pairs of runs. * Includes a simple test application for searching over the Braun Corpus or the Cranfield Corpus.

It has spindle-shaped pseudobulbs, between five and ten dark green leaves with purplish markings and flowering stems with up to fifteen chocolate brown flowers with a yellow labellum.Lewis Roberts. Description Dendrobium johannis is an epiphytic or lithophytic herb with brownish or purplish pseudobulbs that are long, wide and tapered at both ends. There are between five and ten dark green to purplish leaves long and wide near the upper end of the canes. Between six and fifteen flowers long, wide are borne on a flowering stem long. The flowers are chocolate brown with a bright yellow labellum, long lasting and have an unpleasant scent. The sepals and petals are thick, shiny and twisted, the sepals long and wide and the petals a similar length but narrower. The labellum is long, wide with three lobes. The side lobes are upright and the middle lobe is curved with three ridges along its midline. Flowering occurs from March to July. Taxonomy and naming Dendrobium johannis was first formally described in 1865 by Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach who published the description in The Gardeners' Chronicle and Agricultural Gazette from a specimen collected by John Gould Veitch. James Bateman noted the following: \\"Prof. Reichenbach being anxious to connect in some way the name of Mr John G. Veitch with that of a plant which forms one of his more remarkable discoveries, and being unable to call it Dendrobium Veitchianum because that name had long since been given by Dr. Lindley to another species of the genus discovered by Lobb, hit upon the ingenious device of making his Christian name the passport to immortality in the present instance. Certainly no one ever laboured harder in the cause of science or deserved the compliment better than the adventurous young traveller, who has already added so many new things to our collections, and who, we sincerely hope, may be spared to enrich them still more. This orchid is sometimes included in the genus Cepobaculum,Clements, M.A. & Jones, D.L. (2002), Nomenclatural changes in the Dendrobieae (Orchidaceae) 1: The Australasian Region. The Orchadian 13(11) but the splitting of Dendrobium into numerous genera has not typically been accepted. Distribution and habitat The chocolate tea tree orchid occurs in the Western Province of Papua New Guinea and in Australia from the tip of Cape York Peninsula to the McIlwraith Range and Coen. It is locally common at altitudes of between in open forest, swampy areas and monsoonal thickets. Conservation status This orchid is classed as \\"vulnerable\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The main threat to the species is illegal collection.

The standard specifications related to AAL2 are ITU standards I.363.2 and I366.1.  What is AAL2?  AAL2 is a variable bitrate, connection-oriented, low latency service originally intended to adapt voice for transmission over ATM. Like other ATM adaptation layers, AAL2 defines segmentation and reassembly of higher-layer packets into ATM cells, in this case packets of data containing voice and control information. AAL2 is further separated into two sub-layers that help with the mapping from upper layer services to ATM cells. These are named Service Specific Convergence Sub-layer (SSCS) and Common Part Sub-layer (CPS). The AAL2 protocol improves on other ATM Adaptation Layers, by packing lots of small packets efficiently into one standard-sized ATM cell of 53 bytes. A one- byte packet thus no longer has an overhead ratio of 52 unused bytes out of 53 (i.e. 98%). Potentially, total of 11 one-byte CPS packets (plus 3/4 of a 12th CPS packet) could squeeze into a single cell. Of course, CPS packets can come in other sizes with other CIDs, too. When the transmission is ready, the CPS packets are all multiplexed together into a single cell and transported over standard ATM network infrastructure. The transport networks for ATM are well standardized fiber optic (SDH/Sonet, i.e. STM-1/OC-3 or higher) or copper cable (PDH, i.e. E1/T1/JT1 or higher bandwidth fixed lines) based synchronous networks with built-in redundancy and OAM-related network features which Ethernet networks never had originally (in order to keep things simple) but are sorely missed in metro Ethernet standard networks. Efforts to improve Ethernet networks are in a sense trying to reinvent the wheel √† la ATM. AAL2 is one example of a useful benefit of ATM, as a general standard for Layer 2 protocols. ATM/AAL2's efficient handling of small packets contrasts with Ethernet's minimum payload of 46 bytes vs the 1-byte minimum size for an AAL2 CPS packet. AAL2 is the standard layer 2 protocol used in all Iu interfaces, i.e. the interfaces between UMTS base stations and UMTS Radio Network Controllers (RNCs) (Iu-B), inter-RNCs (Iu-R), UMTS RNCs and UMTS Serving GPRS Support Nodes (SGSNs) (Iu-PS), and UMTS RNCs and media gateways (MGWs) (Iu- CS).  AAL2 and the ATM Cell  The basic component of AAL2 is the CPS packet. A CPS packet is an unanchored unit of data that can cross ATM cells and can start from anywhere in the payload of the ATM cell, other than the start field (STF). The STF is the first byte of the 48-byte ATM payload. The STF gives the byte index into the ATM cell where the first CPS packet in this cell begins. Byte 0 is the STF. The data from byte 1 ... (STF+1), would be the straddled remainder of the previous ATM cell's final CPS packet. If there is no remainder from the previous cell, the STF is 0, and the first byte of the cell after the STF is also the location of the start of the first CPS packet. The format for the 1 byte STF at the beginning of the ATM cell is: * 6 bits - offset field (OSF) * 1 bit - sequence number (SN) * 1 bit - parity (P)  OSF  The Offset Field carries the binary value of the offset, in octets, between the end of the P bit and the start of the CPCS-PDU Payload. Values of greater than 47 are not allowed.  SN  The Sequence Number numbers the stream of CPCS-PDUs.  P  The Parity bit is used to detect error in the OSF and SN fields. If the ATM cell has fewer than 47 bytes, the remainder will be filled by padding.  AAL2u  One common adaptation of AAL2, AAL2u, doesn't use the STF field at all. In this case, one single CPS packet is aligned to the beginning of the cell. AAL2u is not used in standardized interfaces, but rather in proprietary equipment implementations where the multiplexing/demultiplexing, etc. that needs to be done for standard AAL2 either is too strenuous, is unsupported, or requires too much overhead (i.e. the 1 byte of STF) from the internal system's point of view. Most computer chips do not support AAL2, so stripping this layer away makes it easier to interwork between the ATM interface and the rest of the network.  ATM AAL2 Cell Diagram  The following is diagram of the AAL2 ATM cell: Format of AAL type 2 Cell  AAL2 and the CPS Packet  A CPS packet has a 3-byte header and a payload of between one and 45 octets. The standard also defines a 64-octet mode, but this is not commonly used in real 3G networks. The 3-byte CPS header has following fields: * 8 bits - channel identifier (CID) * 6 bits - length indicator (LI) * 5 bits - user to user indication (UUI) * 5 bits - header error control (HEC)  CID  The Channel Identifier identifies the user of the channel. The AAL2 channel is a bi-directional channel and the same channel identification value is used for both directions. The maximum number of multiplexed user channels is 248. As some channels are reserved for other uses, such as peer-to-peer layer management. CE : Channel Element CID = CE -E + ID  LI  The Length Indicator indicates the length (in number of octets) of the CPS information field, and can have a value between 1 and 45 (default) or sometimes between 1 and 64. For a given CID all channels must be of the same maximum length (either 45 or 64 octets) NB: the LI is one less than the actual length of the payload, so 0 corresponds to the minimum length of 1 octet, and 0x3f to 64 octets.  UUI  User to User Indication conveys specific information transparently between the users. For example, in SSSAR, UUI is used to indicate that this is the final CPS packet for the SSSAR PDU.  HEC  This is Header Error Control and checks for errors in the CID, LI and UUI fields. The generator polynomial for the CPS HEC is: G(x) = x^5 + x^2 + 1  ATM AAL2 CPS Packet Diagram  The following is a diagram of the CPS packet: Format of AAL type 2 CPS-Packet  References  External links  * Broadband Forum - ATM Forum Technical Specifications * AAL2 ITU Standard Category:Network protocols Category:ITU-T recommendations ","title":"ATM Adaptation Layer 2"},{"id":"24593250","text":"Peter Willett is a Professor of Information Science at the University of Sheffield, England.

It was written by Melvin Burgess and is the first project he has written for television and online platforms. The story comprises four ten-minute episodes and three levels of an online game where the audience can explore an online simulation of the main location, a haunted house, playing games and unlocking a back story that relates back to the main story within the television episodes. Plot The Well is the story of four teenagers; Beth (Jo Woodcock), Luis (Gregory Foreman), Coll (Karen Gillan) and Ivan (Isaac Ssebandeke) who accidentally uncover a cursed Celtic well and release an evil spirit into the world. The teenagers must discover how to restore order before one of them is killed by the evil hag that they have disturbed, who has already killed a young girl called Bethany who features in the online platform of the show. Characters Beth (Jo Woodcock): Beth is the leader of the gang. She has a soft spot for Ivan. Her brother is Luis who is very much the complete opposite of her. She suffers from nightmares which are disturbingly vivid and tries to cover up her fear by being very cocky and pretending to be really cool. Coll (Karen Gillan): Coll is the most sensible of all of the gang and is extremely intelligent. However, despite her pretty looks, every time she performs well in her exams boys seem to hate her even more especially Luis, much to her disappointment. She is the one most eager to solve the mystery of the well and doesn't give up. Online The Well uses an approach of telling a story across different platforms, namely television and online. Although the story can be understood as a four-part television drama, in-between episodes the audience can go online and gain access to the back story. The online story is set in the 1800s and crosses over into the present day story that unfolds concurrently on television. By exploring a three dimensional replica of the house and completing a series of games, the audience are rewarded with a new piece of the back story which is told to them by ghosts. Each section of story that is unlocked builds to reveal a tale of a young girl called Bethany who also disturbed the well and was eventually killed by the hag. Special features When the phone number from the show is dialed from a mobile phone, the phone will receive specialized text messages related to the series. Producers The Well was created by Liverpool-based digital media company Conker Media for BBC Switch. The 3D house was created by Milky Tea and the online games by Splinter Design Communications.

Life and work Born in La Plata in 1891 to Clara Manes, a Greek Argentine immigrant, and Antonio Curatella, from Italy, Curatella Manes first acquired an interest in sculpture during his frequent childhood visits to the newly inaugurated La Plata Fine Arts Museum. He entered the labor force in 1905 as a typographer in a printing house, though an accident some months later ended his career in that industry. Drawing on his childhood interest, he was taught the basics of sculpture by Arturo Dresco, who owned a local atelier.Pablo Curatella Manes: Biograf√≠a The Curatellas relocated to Buenos Aires, where the young sculptor enrolled in the National Fine Arts School in 1907. A rebellious streak promptly led to his expulsion, though Curatella earned an apprenticeship in 1908 under Lucio Correa Morales, with whom he worked on a number of works commissioned by Public Parks Director Charles Thays. Following the 1910 elections, he created a commemorative gold medal for Vice President-elect Victorino de la Plaza, who secured a scholarship for Curatella that took him to Florence and Rome. Curatella traveled extensively in Italy, as well as much of western Europe, touring the region's museums and cathedrals. On his return to Argentina in 1912, National Fine Arts School director Ernesto de la C√°rcova nearly ordered the funds' repayment, objecting to travel and activities not covered by the scholarship, desisting from the punishment after being shown a folio of Curatella's prolific work. His first Buenos Aires exhibit, in 1912, was followed by a return to Europe. He settled in the Montparnasse section of Paris and studied under Aristide Maillol and Emile-Antoine Bourdelle, but was forced to return home after the outbreak of World War I. In his native La Plata he opened an art gallery, the Sal√≥n de Oto√±o (Autumn Salon), in 1916. A brief return in 1917 to Paris, where Curatella worked under Maillol, Maurice Denis and Paul S√©rusier, was eventually followed by a second scholarship, with which he settled in Paris in 1920. Studying under Henri Laurens, Juan Gris, Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi and Le Corbusier, Curatella explored Cubism, and his sculptures became more avant-garde; he also established his first atelier, where he acquired the habit of creating and destroying sculptures in a single day.Answers.com: Pablo Curatella Manes He married French painter Germaine Derbecqre in 1922 and in 1926, was given a post in the Argentine Embassy. Returning to Argentina in 1929, he exhibited Las Tres Gracias (The Three Graces), which marked a departure towards the Abstract which would typify his work in subsequent years. Commissioned to create wall reliefs for the Argentine Pavilion in the 1937 Paris Exhibition, Curatella returned to France and opened an atelier on rue Lauriston, in Paris. His monumental Tierra Argentina and Los Dos Hemisferios (\\"Argentina\\" and \\"The Two Hemispheres\\") earned him the honor of serving in the Paris Exhibition's sculpture jury, and following the event, he was made an Officer of the L√©gion d'honneur. Reappointed to the embassy in 1939 as a charg√© d'affaires, Curatella oversaw the repatriation of Argentine nationals in France following the Nazi invasion of France in 1940. Following World War II, he oversaw the reopening of the Argentine Embassy, as well as the reconstruction of the Boulogne-Sur-Mer home where the hero of the Argentine War of Independence, General Jos√© de San Mart√≠n, died in 1850. Curatella continued to sculpt during his diplomatic tenure, and was among those who in 1946 reinaugurated the Salon des Ind√©pendants, an artists' society and exhibit series banned by the Vichy regime. He remained active in the salon until being transferred to the Embassy in Athens in 1949, upon which he donated thirty-one works to the Argentine government for the purpose of creating a museum of modern art (which were added to the National Museum of Fine Arts, instead). He contributed to Unesco festivals and was appointed to the organizing committee for Expo 58, while accepting a commission from architect Mario Roberto √Ålvarez for two reliefs, El Drama and La Comedia, for display in the public San Mart√≠n Theatre, inaugurated in 1960. Curatella returned to the diplomatic corps in 1958, as an official in the Argentine Embassy in Brussels, whereby he oversaw the Argentine pavilion at Expo 58 and was honored with the Order of Leopold. Invited as a commissioner of the 1961 Paris Biennale, he reopened his rue Lauriston atelier. His El Guitarrista and Torso Femenino were acquired by the Modern Art Museum of the City of Paris, but a sudden illness forced the noted sculptor to return to Buenos Aires, where he died in 1962, at age 70. He lived to see his vision for the Buenos Aires Museum of Modern Art, which was opened in 1956 by art critic Rafael Squirru; a number of Curatella's works are among its collections.Museo de Arte Moderno References Category:1891 births Category:1962 deaths Category:People from La Plata Category:Argentine people of Greek descent Category:Argentine people of Italian descent Category:Argentine diplomats Category:Officiers of the L√©gion d'honneur Category:20th-century Argentine sculptors Category:Male sculptors Category:20th-century male artists ","title":"Pablo Curatella Manes"},{"id":"24593312","text":"Edward Vaughan (or Wagham) (died 1522) was a Welsh bishop of St David's, remembered for construction work in his diocese. Life He is assumed of Welsh origin, according to some a native of South Wales. He was born about the middle of the fifteenth century, and was educated at Cambridge, where he graduated LL.D. On 21 June 1487 he was instituted to the church of St. Matthew, Friday Street, London, and subsequently became vicar of St Mary's Church, Islington also. At St. Paul's Cathedral he was successively promoted to the prebend of Reculverland, 15 April 1493, that of Harleston, 16 November 1499, and was made treasurer 10 November 1503, holding along with the latter the prebend of Bromesbury in the same church. He built a house near St. Paul's for his successors in the treasurership, and distributed five hundred marks to the poor in London in time of dearth. He was made archdeacon of Lewes in 1509, and on 22 July in the same year, vacating his London appointments, he was consecrated bishop of St. David's, to which he was promoted by the pope's bull of provision dated 13 January 1509. He erected at St. David's the chapel which still bears his name. On its walls he placed three coats-of-arms his own, those of Henry VII, and of Sir Rhys ap Thomas, probably a past patron, and who spent his latter days at Carew Castle, close to Lamphey, at that time an episcopal residence. He remodelled and roofed the lady chapel and its ante- chapel, while the roof of the nave, and probably also the porch and the upper stage of the tower, belong to his period. He also built the chapel at Lamphey, and John Leland ascribes to him the chapel of St. Justinian (now in ruins), the chapel at Llawhaden Castle, where Vaughan often resided, and a great barn (now destroyed) at Lamphey. The interior decoration of Hodgeston church is supposed to be his. Vaughan died in November 1522, and was buried in the chapel which he built and which bears his name. Over him was placed a marble tomb, with his effigy in brass; what now remains is a large slab of shell marble, immediately in front of the altar.

Maur√≠cio (Mois√©s) Bensa√∫de (also known professionally as Maurizio Bensaude) (13 February 1863, in Ponta Delgada ‚Äì 22 December 1912, in Lisbon), was a Portuguese operatic baritone. He arrived in Lisbon in 1884, where he received vocal training for a short time, and then made his debut in the same year at the Teatro da Trindade in Lisbon, in the op√©rette La petite mari√©e by Charles Lecocq. He then worked in another operetta at the Portuguese capital, in the Teatro de D. Maria, where he appeared in operettas and musical comedies. However, he continued to take singing lessons, and began to take on operatic roles as well at the end of the 1880s. He quickly became a success, and went on to have extensive international guest appearances. In 1896, he sang at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome, playing Riccardo in Bellini's I Puritani in 1897, and playing Gunther in Twilight of the Gods. In the 1893‚Äì94 and 1898‚Äì99 seasons, he was engaged at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, where he served as Amonasro in the debut of Aida. In 1899, he performed at the Teatro Regio in Turin, and in 1900, he performed at the Covent Garden Opera in London as Amonasro and as Figaro in Barber of Seville. He also had other guest appearances at the Berlin Court Opera, the Teatro Argentina in Rome, Paris and Milan, at the Odessa Opera, and in Zagreb. He also toured through Brazil and the United States. In 1910, he gave up his stage career. At times he worked as the head of an opera troupe, with whom he held opera performances in Portugal. He worked as a teacher and was active in the management of the Teatro de S√£o Carlos in Lisbon, but he died two years after his farewell stage. Bensaude was married to the opera singer Julia de Fano. His repertoire for the stage included Enrico in Lucia di Lammermoor, Germont in La Traviata, Lescaut in Manon by Massenet, the Escamillo in Carmen, Marcello in Puccini's La Boheme, and Alfio in Cavalleria Rusticana. US career Although Bensaude was primarily active in Europe, he had more than a passing career in the United States. He made his debut at New York's Metropolitan Opera on November 23, 1894, as Amonasro in Verdi's Aida,Brown, T. Allston, A History of the New York Stage From the First Performance in 1732 to 1901, New York: Dodd, Mead and Co., 1903, page 459 and his debut in Philadelphia on the following December 18 in the same role.Curtis, John, ed. Frank Hamilton, Opera in Philadelphia Performance Chronology 1875-1899, page 209 he would remain a member of the Metropolitan company for the remainder of the season. At least at first he made little impression in New York, where critics described his voice as \\"pleasant\\"\\"Music: Opening of the New York Season,\\" The Critic, December 1, 1894 or \\"tolerable\\"; The New York Times, in a generally mixed review of the production, indicated the artist \\"lacks distinction, both vocally and dramatically.\\" \\"Verdi's 'Aida' at the Opera,\\" The New York Times, November 24, 1984 Perhaps Bensaude was overshadowed by other developments; the Aida soprano Libia Drog was attempting to erase memories of her own unsuccessful New York debut two days earlier in Rossini's William Tell, when she was so stricken by stage fright that she froze onstage and was unable to perform, and the Rhadames, Francesco Tamagno, drew critical reproval for \\"bawling\\" his part over the footlights.

It was filmed in the small town of Boonah in Queensland, Australia and follows the lives of Dawn (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and her four children after the unexpected death of her husband Peter (Aden Young). The film is an adaptation of the 2002 debut novel Our Father Who Art in the Tree by Australian writer and performer Judy Pascoe. The film closed the Cannes Film Festival on 23 May 2010 following the Awards Ceremony and received a seven- minute standing ovation. In addition, The Tree premiered at the 2010 Sydney Film Festival. The film is distributed in the US by Zeitgeist Films, opening on 15 July 2011 in New York, on 22 July in Los Angeles, Boston and Washington, D.C., and throughout the country over the summer.  Plot  Dawn and Peter O'Neil live together with their children (three boys and a girl), on the outskirts of a small country town. Next to their rambling house stands the kids' favourite playground: a giant Moreton Bay Fig tree (now known in real- life as the Teviotville Tree), whose branches reach high towards the sky and roots stretch far into the ground. Everything seems perfect until Peter suffers a heart attack, crashing his car into the tree's trunk. Dawn is devastated, left alone with her grief and four children to raise. Until one day, 8-year-old Simone, reveals a secret to her mother. She's convinced her father whispers to her through the leaves of the tree and he's come back to protect them. Dawn takes comfort from Simone's imagination, and starts to believe in it herself; just like Simone, Dawn also likes to spend time in the tree. It starts to dominate their physical and emotional landscape. But the close bond between mother and Simone forged through a mutual sorrow and shared secret, is threatened by the arrival of George, the plumber, called in to remove the tree's troublesome roots. As the relationship between Dawn and George blossoms, the tree continues to grow, with its branches infiltrating the house, its roots destroy the foundations. Dawn decides the tree has to go. George and some other workmen arrive, but Simone climbs in the tree to defend it. Dawn and George try to convince her, but she refuses to come down. George argues to Dawn that the girl is only 8 years old, Dawn should not allow her to stop the necessary removal of the tree. This irritates Dawn, and she cancels the operation, and tells George she does not want to see him again. In a big storm the house is demolished by the tree, and the family leaves the area, planning to start living somewhere else, perhaps in a tent.  Cast  * Charlotte Gainsbourg as Dawn * Marton Csokas as George * Aden Young as Peter * Morgana Davies as Simone * Christian Byers as Tim * Tom Russell as Lou * Gabriel Gotting as Charlie * Gillian Jones as Vonnie * Penne Hackforth-Jones as Mrs Johnson  Production  The Tree was written and directed by Julie Bertuccelli, it is based on the screenplay by Elizabeth J Mars, produced by Sue Taylor of Taylor Media, Yael Fogiel and Laetitia Gonzalez of Les Films du Poisson, and is a co-production between Australia and France. It came to be a co-production when Julie Bertuccelli was given the book Our Father Who Art in the Tree by a close friend. When she looked into getting the rights for the film she found that Australian producer Sue Taylor already had them, however she did not have a director. It just so happened that Julie is a director, and from there the co-production was born. The tree used in the film is Teviotville Tree, located in the small town of Teviotville in the state of Queensland. It has a 34 m spread, 20 m height and 2.31 m diameter at 1 m above ground, which is the narrowest point. The tree has low branches which have not been pruned off, and when they are laden with fruit they reach the ground. It is very rare to find this in a Moreton Bay Fig tree. It is estimated that it was planted in 1880.  Soundtrack  Original film music was written and composed by Gr√©goire Hetzel.

It has spindle-shaped pseudobulbs, between three and seven leathery, dark green leaves and between three and fifteen yellow, yellowish brown or brown flowers with a mauve to purple labellum. Description Dendrobium trilamellatum is an epiphytic herb with spindle- shaped, cane-like, green pseudobulbs long and wide. There are between three and seven leathery, linear to lance-shaped, dark green leaves, long and wide. Between three and fifteen pleasantly-scented flowers are borne on a flowering stem long. The flowers are yellow, yellowish brown or brown with darker stripes, long and wide. The sepals and petals are strongly twisted, thick and shiny. The sepals are long, the dorsal sepal wide and the lateral sepal wide. The petals are a similar length to the sepals but only about half as wide. The labellum is mauve to purple with a cream-coloured to yellow centre, long, wide and has three lobes. The side lobes are erect and middle lobe is arrowhead- shaped and curved with three ridges along its midline. Flowering occurs from July to November.Beasley, John. (2009). Plants of Cape York: The Compact Guide. John Beasley, Kuranda, Qld., Australia. . Dendrobium trilamellatum has apparently been frequently confused with D. johannis. They are, however, easy to tell apart if flowering: D. trilamellatum flowers in the spring while D. johannis flowers in the autumn. The former has a delightful scent, while the latter smells unpleasant.Scarth-Johnson, Vera (2000). National Treasures: Flowering Plants of Cooktown and Northern Australia. Vera Scarth-Johnson Gallery Association Inc. Cooktown. (pbk); . Taxonomy Dendrobium trilamellatum was first formally described in 1908 by Johannes Jacobus Smith and the description was published in Nova Guinea : R√©sultats de l'exp√©dition scientifique N√©erlandaise √† la Nouvelle-Guin√©e. Smith noted \\"This species is closely related to D. johannis Rchb.f.\\". In 2002, Mark Clements and David Jones included this orchid in the genus Cepobaculum as C. trilamellatum. They also raised Dendrobium johannis var. semifuscum, which had been described in 1883 by Reichenbach, to species level as Cepobaculum semifuscum.Clements, M.A. & Jones, D.L. (2002), Nomenclatural changes in the Dendrobieae (Orchidaceae) 1: The Australasian Region. The Orchadian 13(11) The splitting of Dendrobium into numerous genera has not typically been accepted and both C. trilamellatum and C. semifuscum are regarded by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families as synonyms of D. trilamellatum. Distribution and habitat The fragrant tea tree orchid grows on paperbark and rough-barked trees mainly in open forest, woodland. It is found on Cape York Peninsula from the Iron Range to Cooktown and the McIlwraith Range, on some Torres Strait Islands and on the coast of New Guinea. Use in horticulture The orchid needs good light. It grows well on a slab and needs a dry winter but frequent watering in summer.

The museum closed on 30 September 2015. It displayed a huge variety of glass objects, dating from the 17th century to the present day, across nine galleries. In addition to the glass displays were several paintings that demonstrate glass making and the local landscape. The museum also displayed glass making tools and ephemera produced by the glass industry. Various events and temporary exhibitions were held throughout its history. To complete the visitor experience it had a shop that sold various souvenirs, books, vintage glassware and products from contemporary glassmakers. History of the building The museum represented the latest chapter for a building that has hosted many contrasting occupants. The original structure was a modest two-storey farmhouse built in the mid or late 18th century and faced Barnett Lane. The threshing barn (now the Hot Glass Studio) dates from the same period and serves as a reminder that two hundred years ago this area was open country and farmland. In the early 1800s the house was transformed into a much grander residence when a fine three- storey Regency block with sash windows and portico was built onto the back of the original building. This then formed the main entrance, reversing the orientation of the original house. In 1943 the house, along with 16 acres, was purchased by Kenneth George MacMaster, an engineering contactor and property developer. The following year MacMaster sold the house to Dennis Smith from Tividale. Smith was the last private owner of Broadfield House and lived here with his family until 1949. In 1949 the house was acquired by Staffordshire County Council for use as a Mothercraft Hostel. Following local government reorganisation in 1966 ownership was transferred to the enlarged County Borough of Dudley. In 1969 Broadfield House became an Old People‚Äôs Home. It was not a suitable site, as illustrated by the 44 stairs and no lift. Following the creation of Dudley MBC in 1974, the Council closed the home and began looking at alternative uses for the building. Inevitably the Mothercraft Hostel and Old People's Home left their mark on the building and features remain that are suggestive of an institutional use. In 1976 the idea emerged of using the building as a new home for the Council‚Äôs Brierley Hill and Stourbridge Glass Collections. This met with considerable opposition as the people of Brierley Hill and Stourbridge were very protective of their collections and did not want them moved from their respective towns. At the final Council meeting, the decision to go ahead won by only one vote! Conversion work began in 1979 and Broadfield House Glass Museum was officially opened by Princess Michael of Kent on 2 April 1980. Exhibitions The museum held various temporary exhibitions, with local, national and international artists represented, featuring historical and contemporary glassworks. The Studio The Hot Glass Studio is sponsored by The Hulbert Group of Dudley and has been made available for use by graduates and established glass-blowers. It is currently occupied by Allister Malcolm. Archives and Library The museum housed archives from various sources, containing such items as pattern books, catalogues, description books and invoices. In addition, there is a large collection of images and recorded material providing insight into the people and the manufacturing process. It also housed an extensive reference library of books and information on glassworking, including the entire library of Robert Charleston, former head of glass and ceramics at the Victoria & Albert Museum. The Charleston library includes approximately 700 books as well as his own collection of papers, articles and archival material. Both the library and archive will continue to be in the care of DMBC Museum Service.

In this game the player is a gangster in the 1930s. Omerta players rank up by stealing cars, committing crimes, breaking people out of prison and dealing alcohol and narcotics.  Development  Omerta was launched publicly on 26 September 2003 with the first version, now known as Omerta 1.0. This version was written by Moritz Daan in Groningen. During the 16-year run of Omerta, there have been about 38 million player registrations. In January 2008 Omerta moved to a new service provider with 20 servers running the FreeBSD operating system. In July 2009 version 3.0 of Omerta was released. In the first month after the release more than 100,000 players registered. Following several intermediate versions, in February 2013 version 4.0 was released with enhanced game-play and a modern graphical style replaced the original frame-based standard web layout. Version 5.0 has been the current build since 2015.  Gameplay  Omerta is a strategic massively multiplayer online role playing game where players undertake criminal activities to earn money and experience. Players form Mafia families which engage in a constant power struggle to become the dominant force in the game. An important feature is the ability to permanently kill other players accounts - to gain money and a tactical advantage. Players hope to become the Don of a successful Mafia family. Team play and cooperation are essential and during Omerta's lifespan, many durable alliances have come into existence. Set in 1930s gangster and Mafia world, the game is all about status, money and respect. Players get rank points by doing crimes, stealing cars and busting friends out of jail. You can even run your own organised crime ring, robbing local banks and holding up cars on quiet roads. As you delve deeper into the dark gangster world, many players find other business opportunities, such as gambling clubs, reselling booze and even drug dealing. New game players choose to start in a city of either USA or Italy, where the Mafia has got a large influence even now. One of the more gambling cities, Las Vegas, allows gangsters to try their luck with a wide range of slot machines, black-jack games, and even roulette tables. In a deadly and sometimes cruel world it helps to have allies, both for protection and shared wealth. Many game players have set up families, who will look out for each other until the very end. Families are rich, powerful and can run whole neighbourhoods of a city, so you may want to keep on their good side. As you would imagine, they aren't too happy if another player or rival family shoots one of their guys or takes one of their casinos. For those more cautious game players there are other forms of protection, bodyguards, fast getaway vehicles and even bulletproof suits  Business model  Omerta is a pioneer of free-to-play games; it does not carry banners or other advertisements and there are no exclusively-paid functions which would give paying-players advantages over those who cannot. From launch Omerta operated a 'click-limit' whereby players paying can view more pages of the game each minute. Players would request a maximum of eleven webpages per minute, or purchase an unlock-code which raised the click-limit to 40 webpages per minute. A second code might be activated, allowing more message-storage in a player's inbox, a more feature-rich profile page and various other soft, non-advantageous perks. Codes can be purchased via phone and web-based micro-payments, including via PayPal or by using the game's own internal auction tool. In 2015 this early-web device was retired in favour of a premium content based system wherein players are able to part- automate play while offline, however, the model remains free-to-play owing to the ability to purchase content unlock codes via an in-game market feature called 'oBay'.  IP licensing deal with Kalypso Media  In the summer of 2012 a licensing partnership was agreed with Germany-based game developer Kalypso Media, in order for Kalypso to use Omerta's IP for the PC game Omerta, City of Gangsters. The PC game features a link to Omerta (the web-game) on its index page and on the games's promotional web site. A special flier from Omerta the RPG was carried in the box-edition of Omerta, City of Gangsters.

The term Tesco Town comes from the name of the retailer Tesco, but is used to describe any area dominated by one particular retailer. In October 2009 the Competition Commission passed its proposal for a \\"competition test\\" on to the Department for Communities and Local Government. The test would ban from adding more space in an area, which it says will improve choice for shoppers by making it easier for rival grocers to open. Towns dominated by Tesco=Aylesbury Tesco traditionally had a market share of 50% in Aylesbury. The company has three stores. This compares to Sainsbury's having two stores and Morrisons one. However, branches of Aldi, Lidl, Asda and Waitrose opened in quick succession in 2013. There are plans for a second Aldi as of 2014 and plans for a third Sainsbury's as of 2015. Banbridge Banbridge, Co Down in Northern Ireland can also be classed as a Tesco Town with a Superstore and Extra store for a population of approximately 14,000. Bedford Bedford has been described as a Tesco town with the town having a Tesco for every 7,500 people.http://www.bedfordshire- news.co.uk/Features/Tesco-friend-or-foe-You-be-the-judge-23032012.htm Bicester Bicester is one of the UK's best known Tesco-towns, operating five stores in a region with a population of 29,000. Featuring a Tesco superstore on the southern side of town, near the Bicester Village designer outlet, and a further four Tesco Express stores around the general neighbourhood and community areas. At its peak, Tesco's market share in the town was 90%. Following the opening of a large Sainsbury's in Bicester town centre in 2013, and the proposed extension of the Bicester Village outlet centre over the Tesco superstore site, Tesco is planning to re-locate and double the size of that store into a Tesco Extra, to better compete with Sainsbury's. Sainsbury's has indicated that when the new Tesco Extra opens, they will extend their own superstore to compete with Tesco. Aldi and Lidl have also opened stores in the town recently. Both Asda and Waitrose have considered opening supermarkets in Bicester in the past, but have decided against due to the high Tesco market share. However, since the opening of Sainsbury's, the market share of Tesco is said to have plummeted. In January 2015, Tesco announced the closure of their Tesco Metro store in Bicester, located directly opposite the Sainsbury's superstore. Buckingham Tesco has an 80% market share in Buckingham at present. The retailer currently has two stores in the town. The only major competition is a branch of Waitrose. However, this will change when two Sainsbury's stores open up. Inverness In 2007, it was reported that in Inverness, where there are currently four stores in the small city, Tesco had a 51% share of the market for groceries in the city, the highest rate of penetration for any locality in the UK. Kirkby In April 2008, Tesco purchased a shopping centre in Kirkby, Merseyside for ¬£65million which saw nearly all shops in Kirkby become tenants. Oakham Oakham is also said to be a town where Tesco has a high market share. There is also a proposal to build a Sainsbury's supermarket in the town. Perth Tesco has a 60% market share in Perth. Southall Tesco has a 58% market share in Southall. Launceston Other than a small Lidl supermarket, Launceston's only large supermarket is Tesco. Truro Tesco has a 53% market share in Truro. Worcester In Worcester, Tesco are viewed unfavourably by local press due to the alleged monopoly of the Tesco brand in the city.https://www.worcesternews.co.uk/news/7443340.store-attacked- for-monopoly/ There are two large supermarkets less than three miles apart situated in the middle of two recently developed urban areas.

The Tesco Express store on Brindley Road is notably frequently subjected to theft leading to the installation of anti-theft spikes on the roof. This led to problems with Worcester County Council because Tesco did not seek planning permission to erect them.https://www.worcesternews.co.uk/news/18661785.tesco-forced-remove- spikes-worcester-shops-roof/ There is only one Asda, one Morrisons, one Waitrose, and two medium sized Sainsburys (and one Sainsbury's Local) in comparison to the high number of Tesco stores in Worcester.

Here she sang in the seasons 1928-29, 1930‚Äì31, 1933‚Äì34 and 1936-37 batches from the dramatic vocal category. In 1932 and 1933 Jacobo performed at the Monte Carlo Opera as Aida, Amelia in Verdi's Un ballo in maschera and as the title heroine in Lucrezia Borgia by Donizetti. In the early thirties, she was the great prima donna of Italian opera in the Netherlands. The Dutch audience admired her, among other things as Leonora in \\"La forza del destino\\" and in Il trovatore, as Tosca, as the title heroine in La Gioconda, and as Santuzza in Cavalleria rusticana. In 1930 and 1932 Jacobo performed very successfully at La Scala as Turandot.

Early life Lavlu was born in Jugia village, near Kushtia town in the Kushtia District in the Khulna Division of western Bangladesh. Career=Early career In 1977, Lavlu moved to Dhaka, to join the Aranyak Natyadal Theatre, where he acted in stage plays until 1985 but desired to do other things. After Bangladesh Television (BTV) started its own production, he acted in several television dramas. In the early 1990s, he explored other options and began working as a photographer. In 1997, after working as a photographer for about six years, he found a new passion as a director. Acting and directing Lavlu made his television film directorial debut with Koutob, written by Masum Reza. Among the critically acclaimed television films he directed by 2004 are Dichakrojaan (1997), Gahargachi (1997), Ekjon Aynal Lashkar (1999), Adhuli (2002) and Gor (2002). Since 2004, Lavlu has directed and acted in many different telenovelas. Ronger Manush (2004) was his first telenovela directorial debut. Following its success, he pursued making more of them. Since then he has directed and acted in five telenovelas. Two of these include Vober Hat (2007) and Ghor Kutum (2008). Both of these telenovelas included the same stars, such as Mosharraf Karim and Chanchal Chowdhury (a favourite of Lavlu's, cast in most of his work). Lavlu has also acted in and directed many television films including Goruchor (2007), Potro Milai (2007), Swapner Bilat (2007), Dholer Baddo (2008), Pattri Chai (2009) and Warren (2009).

She writes novels, poetry, screenplays, children's books and material for radio and the theatre.  Biography  Lindsay was educated at the Perse School for Girls in Cambridge, where she was known as Nicky Townley. She trained as a nurse at Guy's Hospital, London before moving to Dublin where she completed a modelling course with the Miriam Woodbyrne Agency. She lived in West Africa, studying drama with the Festival Players and playing in the Pro Musica chamber orchestra for five years before returning to Ireland. On her return, she studied flute in the Royal Irish Academy of Music with Doris Keogh and later with Andre Prieur. Moving to County Wicklow in 1975, Lindsay continued to play the flute with the Dublin Orchestral Players and the Dublin Symphony Orchestra. She also wrote and illustrated her first book for children, Batty Cat, which was published several years later. In 1994, she started to write seriously and has had five novels published by Poolbeg Press (A Place for Unicorns, Diving through Clouds, Eden Fading, Tumbling Jude and Butterfly), two illustrated children's books (Batty Cat and My Magic Place) and a collection of her poetry, Lines of Thought. A collection of her broadcast pieces for Sunday Miscellany on RTE 1 is also available on Amazon. She now has eight novels available on Amazon Kindle Books. Four of which have a para- normal theme. Lindsay records her own work on RT√â 1 and has read her short stories and monologues and talked about her work in a wide variety of venues, including schools and libraries, Trinity College, Dublin, Mount Juliet and also for the Irish Country Women's Association. Lindsay returned to serious acting in 2008, playing Ana in The Clean House by Sarah Ruhl in The New Theatre, Temple Bar, Dublin. She has had numerous articles, scripts, short stories and poems published in magazines, journals and collections in both the UK and Ireland. Her novel, Diving Through Clouds, has been published in the United States and in the Reader's Digest Select Editions in several countries. A Place for Unicorns has also been published in Germany. Lindsay hosted an Arts slot on East Coast Radio and has written and recorded many scripts for the Sunday Miscellany programme on RTE Radio One and has read her work on the Book on One and Lyric FM. She has been interviewed on radio and television on the BBC, RTE 1 and TV3. For several years she has performed her own one woman show in a wide variety of venues. In 2007, she completed a screenwriting course and is now involved in writing both for the theatre and the screen. Her monologues have been performed by members of the Attic Studio, Dublin and also on the radio and stage. The Dry Rain Theatre Company has also performed her revue, Electric Gas. In 2008, Lindsay attended workshops at the Gaiety School of Acting in Dublin and also with directors Vinny Murphy and Graham Cantwell. She has worked in feature and short films and television commercials and is also a voice-over artist. Lindsay completed her first full-length script for the stage, Christmas Fairy Tells All - a wacky, alternative Christmas show for grown ups. It was staged at The New Theatre, Temple Bar, Dublin from Monday 29 November to Saturday 4 December 2010. In February 2011, she joined the cast of Ireland's only soap opera, Fair City, on RT√â 1 television, playing the part of Grace Cleary. Cancer treatment over an eighteen-month period reduced her writing and acting activities but, in 2013, she returned to work with increased enthusiasm. In 2017, she joined forces with the artist Naomi Peppard, working on a children's book called The Song of the Ha-Ha Bird. She is a member of Irish Actors' Equity, the Irish Film and Television Academy and the Irish Writers' Union. She is also a member of Piehole voice-over agency.

The algebra A here is regarded as a coordinate ring but it is important that it may be noncommutative and hence not an actual algebra of coordinate functions on any actual space, so this represents a point of view replacing the specification of a differentiable structure for an actual space. In ordinary differential geometry one can multiply differential 1-forms by functions from the left and from the right, and there exists an exterior derivative. Correspondingly, a first order quantum differential calculus means at least the following: 1\\\\. An A-A-bimodule \\\\Omega^1 over A, i.e. one can multiply elements of \\\\Omega^1 by elements of A in an associative way: : a(\\\\omega b)=(a\\\\omega)b,\\\\ \\\\forall a,b\\\\in A,\\\\ \\\\omega\\\\in\\\\Omega^1. 2\\\\. A linear map {\\\\rm d}:A\\\\to\\\\Omega^1 obeying the Leibniz rule : {\\\\rm d}(ab)=a({\\\\rm d}b)+({\\\\rm d}a)b,\\\\ \\\\forall a,b\\\\in A 3\\\\. \\\\Omega^1={a({\\\\rm d}b)\\\\ \\\\ a,b\\\\in A} 4\\\\. (optional connectedness condition) \\\\ker\\\\ {\\\\rm d}=k1 The last condition is not always imposed but holds in ordinary geometry when the manifold is connected. It says that the only functions killed by {\\\\rm d} are constant functions. An exterior algebra or differential graded algebra structure over A means a compatible extension of \\\\Omega^1 to include analogues of higher order differential forms : \\\\Omega=\\\\oplus_n\\\\Omega^n,\\\\ {\\\\rm d}:\\\\Omega^n\\\\to\\\\Omega^{n+1} obeying a graded-Leibniz rule with respect to an associative product on \\\\Omega and obeying {\\\\rm d}^2=0. Here \\\\Omega^0=A and it is usually required that \\\\Omega is generated by A,\\\\Omega^1. The product of differential forms is called the exterior or wedge product and often denoted \\\\wedge. The noncommutative or quantum de Rham cohomology is defined as the cohomology of this complex. A higher order differential calculus can mean an exterior algebra, or it can mean the partial specification of one, up to some highest degree, and with products that would result in a degree beyond the highest being unspecified. The above definition lies at the crossroads of two approaches to noncommutative geometry. In the Connes approach a more fundamental object is a replacement for the Dirac operator in the form of a spectral triple, and an exterior algebra can be constructed from this data. In the quantum groups approach to noncommutative geometry one starts with the algebra and a choice of first order calculus but constrained by covariance under a quantum group symmetry. Note The above definition is minimal and gives something more general than classical differential calculus even when the algebra A is commutative or functions on an actual space. This is because we do not demand that : a({\\\\rm d}b)=({\\\\rm d}b)a,\\\\ \\\\forall a,b\\\\in A since this would imply that {\\\\rm d}(ab-ba)=0,\\\\ \\\\forall a,b\\\\in A, which would violate axiom 4 when the algebra was noncommutative. As a byproduct, this enlarged definition includes finite difference calculi and quantum differential calculi on finite sets and finite groups (finite group Lie algebra theory). Examples 1\\\\. For A={\\\\mathbb C}[x] the algebra of polynomials in one variable the translation- covariant quantum differential calculi are parametrized by \\\\lambda\\\\in \\\\mathbb C and take the form : \\\\Omega^1={\\\\mathbb C}.{\\\\rm d}x,\\\\quad ({\\\\rm d}x)f(x)=f(x+\\\\lambda)({\\\\rm d}x),\\\\quad {\\\\rm d}f={f(x+\\\\lambda)-f(x)\\\\over\\\\lambda}{\\\\rm d}x This shows how finite differences arise naturally in quantum geometry. Only the limit \\\\lambda\\\\to 0 has functions commuting with 1-forms, which is the special case of high school differential calculus. 2\\\\. For A={\\\\mathbb C}[t,t^{-1}] the algebra of functions on an algebraic circle, the translation (i.e. circle-rotation)-covariant differential calculi are parametrized by q e 0\\\\in \\\\mathbb C and take the form : \\\\Omega^1={\\\\mathbb C}.{\\\\rm d}t,\\\\quad ({\\\\rm d}t)f(t)=f(qt)({\\\\rm d}t),\\\\quad {\\\\rm d}f={f(qt)-f(t)\\\\over q(t-1)}\\\\,{\\\\rm dt} This shows how q-differentials arise naturally in quantum geometry. 3\\\\. For any algebra A one has a universal differential calculus defined by : \\\\Omega^1=\\\\ker(m:A\\\\otimes A\\\\to A),\\\\quad {\\\\rm d}a=1\\\\otimes a-a\\\\otimes 1,\\\\quad\\\\forall a\\\\in A where m is the algebra product. By axiom 3., any first order calculus is a quotient of this.

Writer and editor In 1907, after working as a bank clerk for twenty years, Power joined The Glasgow Herald as a full-time member of its editorial staff and remained there as essay and leader writer for nearly twenty years. A considerable essayist and critic, Power was a supporter of the Scottish Renaissance literary movement in the 1920s. In 1926 he left the Glasgow Herald to become editor of the Scots Observer, a new weekly newspaper which was supported by the Scottish churches. However, the paper was not a commercial success, and he resigned as editor in 1929 to work for Associated Newspapers. Power was a founding member of the Scottish centre of PEN International.

Political career On 12 March 1940, at the age of 66, Power was announced the Scottish National Party (SNP) candidate in the by- election. Power had come from nowhere to poll 37% (7,308 votes), coming second behind the Conservative Party, registering the SNP's largest percentage of a by-election vote to date. Power succeeded Andrew Dewar Gibb as the leader of the SNP. At the SNP Annual Conference in May 1942, Power was re-nominated by John MacCormick for the post of leader of the SNP, but he was narrowly defeated (33 votes to 29) by Douglas Young. This led MacCormick to convene a meeting of his supporters, which established Scottish Convention.Jack Brown, The National Movement in Scotland, pp.240‚Äì242Keith Webb, The growth of nationalism in Scotland, p.147 Power died in Clackmannan County Hospital, Alloa, in June 1951, aged 77. He was married in 1906 to Giulia Dick (1871‚Äì1922), and in 1924 to his second wife, Williamina Mills (1877‚Äì1946). There were no children of either marriage.

Military career Sir Colquhoun GrantIn common with a number of contemporaries, such as Sir Richard Hussey Vivian, he made use of a distinctive middle name in place of a common first name when knighted. joined the 36th Foot as an ensign in 1793, exchanging (some years later) to the cavalry (25th Light Dragoons), with which he served at Seringapatam, but returning to the infantry in 1802 to command the 72nd Foot, which he led for six years. In 1806, at the head of his regiment he joined Sir David Baird's expedition to the Cape of Good Hope and on 8January was wounded in action against the Batavian army at the Battle of Blaauwberg. On announcing the victory of the British in despatches Baird remarked: > \\"Your lordship will perceive the name of Lt.-Col. Grant among the wounded ; > but the heroic spirit of this officer was not subdued by his misfortune, and > he continued to lead his men to glory as long as an enemy was opposed to the > 72nd Regt.\\" He exchanged to the 15th Hussars in 1808, and took part in Sir John Moore's expedition to the Peninsular, being wounded at Sahag√∫n fighting the French. He returned to Spain in January 1813, in command of a cavalry brigade, which saw action at the Battle of Morales. He continued to serve in this capacity, with one interruption, until the end of the Peninsular campaign. Wellington was less than impressed with the performance of Grant's hussar brigade at the Battle of Vitoria and Grant was eventually replaced in command. However, Grant's political influence meant that he soon returned to the Peninsular to take over command of the light dragoon brigade of Robert Ballard Long. He was appointed KCB in 1814. At Waterloo, Grant commanded the 5th Cavalry Brigade, consisting of the 7th and 15th Hussars with the 13th Light Dragoons attached, which was stationed in the centre of the allied position; during the battle he had five horses shot under him. Grant was promoted to lieutenant-general in 1830, and he served as a Tory Member of Parliament (MP) for the rotten borough of Queenborough from 1831 until the borough was disenfranchised under the Reform Act 1832. Grant was a groom of the bedchamber to Prince Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, later King of Hanover. He was reputed to have been the strongest man in the British Army, and was given the nickname \\"The Black Giant.\\"The nickname became popular when he commanded the hussar brigade in 1813, his towering frame and swarthy looks contrasted with the appearance of his constant companion, a diminutive red-headed brigade major. The descriptive phrase \\"The Black Giant with his Red Dwarf\\" became commonplace within the brigade. He was appointed colonel of the 12th (The Prince of Wales's) Royal Regiment of (Light) Dragoons (Lancers) in 1825. He transferred to the 15th (The King's) Regiment of (Light) Dragoons (Hussars) in 1827, succeeding the Duke of Cumberland, a post he held until his death. Personal life Grant died in 1835. He had married Marcia, daughter of the Reverend J. Richards, of Long Bredy, Dorset. Their only surviving child, Marcia, eloped with Whig politician Richard Brinsley Sheridan in May 1835.

She is an author and performer.  Career  During six years of solo career, Vinnitskaya released 5 CDs: Sunrise (2004), 007 (2005), Dolls (2006), Electro (2007), maxi-single Envelope (2008), ZaMIXovano. The Best mixes (2008). She started to write songs in childhood, sending them to the newspaper Pionerskaya Pravda. Some time later Vinnitskaya became a fan of the band Kino and thanks to this started to play the guitar. In 1993, she created her first group The Last Unicorn, where she appeared as the author of her music and lyrics. The first concerts took place in Kiev Central Hospital. Unfortunately, the first attempt to become an artist collapsed: not enough information and badly developed Ukrainian business forced the group to stop their activity. During these few years Vinnitskaya worked as the insurance agent, but was always thinking about the creation of her own band. In 1996 she gave up her work in the insurance company in hope of self-actualization. The long searches of her own way have been started. Vinnitskaya has played in the Theater of the Ecology Institute, in Psychological Theatre etc. \\"Me together with my brother decided to go and to try ourselves. We have prepared our programs. I was singing aria of Maria Magdalena from Jesus Christ Superstar. So we‚Äôve entered. I was taken to the theatre troupe though I wanted to enter the popular troupe. But I do not regret about it because I have discovered myself as the actress\\" A year later the troupe broke up because of not very strong management. Vinnitskaya again was looking for herself and for her own way. At the end of 1997 she discovered a new profession ‚Äî TV hostess at the music channel Biz TV. Some time later the future singer became a hostess of the other TV program FAN CLUB at the Inter channel. At the same time she was starting to work as a DJ at the radio station. In 1998 she entered the school of journalism INTERNEWS. These times she was very busy. She was working from 8 am to 9 pm ‚Äî INTERNEWS and 10 pm to 2 am as a radio DJ. \\"I don't miss about the stage passed. I have given a lot of my forces but I got much more\\" In 2000 Vinnitskaya was invited as the soloist in one popular project that at that time was at the stage of creation ‚Äî it was VIA Gra. She worked there for 3 years and then made a decision that she had been thinking about for a long time ‚Äî to create her own band and to sing her own songs. \\"Alena has passed a long way to the scene, starting as the insurance agent, continuing as the TV host, and later becoming the participant of mega popular band. But this fame and glory wasn‚Äôt enough for her. Alena has always wanted more ‚Äî to sing her own songs.\\"  Cosmopolitan Ukraine  The debut work Forget It All by Vinnitskaya as the independent artist became a mega hit, and has reached the top of popularity in Ukrainian and Russian hit-parades. Soon the second hit of the singer appeared, Sunrise, and the single Tormented Heart followed it. These mega popular songs became a sunrise of Vinnitskaya as the independent, thinking singer. Some time later she played on the scene together with The Cardigans, who came to Ukraine to give their one concert. Before the concert Nina Person has listened for a few Vinnitskaya's works and remained satisfied, saying during the press-conference that she liked the songs of Alena Vinnitskaya. In 2004 Vinnitskaya signed an agreement with the representative of world-famous recording company Universal Studios and soon the first album of the singer Sunrise appeared. A year later the second album 007 represented Vinnitskaya in traditionally male role ‚Äî as the secret agent. She has coped with a complex and male character, proposing to the audience her own version of James Bond music. The album also contains new visions of singer's hits in performance of popular DJ's in the country. The premier of the new song Dolls, the main song on Vinnitskaya's third album, took place on 13 February 2006. A video version of this work was released a week later. Vinnitskaya, as usual, is the author of music and lyrics. \\"This song -is a story about women, who are ready for everything just to reach their aim of success, wealth and power. Their willingness of this destroys their personality, and they become tough, insincere to themselves and the people around them‚Ä¶\\" the singer says. In spring 2006 Vinnitskaya's third album came out. \\"This is one of the most free and courageous works of us\\", she said. The album of dance music Electro appeared in January 2007. Electro consists of 12 songs. It has remixes of several of Alena's songs, that shows the popularity of her music not only on radio and TV, but also in clubs. The singer's latest achievement became a maxi-single Envelope. It had been shown to the public in spring 2008. That autumn on TV channels and radio station appeared the hit Gold Autumn.

The NSF is an independent federal agency with an annual (US)$7-billion budget. Its 2013 Fact Sheet stated that \\"[NSF's] programs and initiatives keep the United States at the forefront of science and engineering, empower future generations of scientists and engineers, and foster economic growth and innovation. NSF funds discovery, learning, innovation, and research infrastructure to boost U.S. leadership in all aspects of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics research and education. In Fiscal Year 2012, NSF supported more than 300,000 individuals in 1,895 institutions in every state in the United States\\". Suresh led NSF from 2010 to 2013. He established a number of new initiatives including Integrated NSF Support Promoting Interdisciplinary Research and Education (INSPIRE); Partnerships for Enhanced Engagement in Research (PEER), in collaboration with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID); Science Across Virtual Institutes (SAVI); the NSF Career-Life Balance Initiative; Graduate Research Opportunities Worldwide (GROW); and the NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps). During this time Suresh served as a member of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC), a cabinet-level council comprising federal agency heads and cabinet secretaries. He co-chaired the NSTC Committee on Science and the Committee on Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Education, and served as a member of the cabinet-level National Ocean Council. Suresh also chaired the Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee (IARPC), which helped set priorities for coordinating future arctic research across the federal government. Under Suresh's leadership, IARPC released a multiagency five-year strategic plan. Alt URL In response to an invitation from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, Suresh established and chaired a Global Summit on Scientific Merit Review at NSF in May 2012. This Summit included the participation, for the first time, of the heads of leading science funding agencies from nearly 50 countries. Summit participants endorsed a Statement of Principles of Scientific Merit Review to serve as a basis for potential multilateral collaborations in the future, and launched a virtual entity, the Global Research Council (GRC), to co-ordinate practices and enhance international scientific collaboration between developed and developing countries. In an editorial in Science magazine, Suresh stated, \\"Good science anywhere is good for science everywhere\\". Commenting on Suresh's departure from NSF, President Obama stated, \\"We have been very fortunate to have Subra Suresh guiding the National Science Foundation for the last two years. He has shown himself to be a consummate scientist and engineer ‚Äì beholden to evidence and committed to upholding the highest scientific standards. He has also done his part to make sure the American people benefit from advances in technology, and opened up more opportunities for women, minorities, and other underrepresented groups. I am grateful for his service.\\"  Carnegie Mellon University  Suresh was appointed as the 9th president of Carnegie Mellon University in 2013 and served as president until 2017. During this time he also held faculty appointments in CMU's Departments of Materials Science and Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Engineering and Public Policy, School of Computer Science, and in the Heinz College. In 2017, his total compensation was $1.1 million, making him the second highest paid private college president in Pennsylvania. As President, Suresh worked to increase the numbers of women recruited to science, technology and mathematics disciplines. He was quoted as saying ‚ÄúIf the United States is to remain a leader in discovery and innovation, we must engage the enormous talent pool represented by our young women.‚Äù During Suresh's tenure, CMU settled a major patent infringement lawsuit against Marvell Technology Group. Suresh announced that the majority of the funds received by the university, expected to be about $250 million, would be dedicated to programs that \\"enhance the student experience\\". Suresh also negotiated several major donations from philanthropists and corporations, including $20M from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to build a new Center for Computer Science,, $67M from CMU alum David Tepper to enhance collaboration among CMU's schools and colleges, $35M from Tata Consultancy Services and $5.5M from Uber. In early 2017 Suresh pledged support to CMU's students following President Trump's immigration ban. In a letter circulated to students, Subra Suresh commented that he was \\"deeply troubled by some of the news out of Washington in recent days, and potential threats ‚Äì explicit and implicit ‚Äì posed to the work of so many students and scholars across the nation who were not born in the United States.\\" Suresh recounted his own journey as an immigrant to the United States writing, \\"I first came to the US at age 21 with a partially filled suitcase, less than $100 in cash, and a one- way airplane ticket purchased with a loan. Once in the US, I was able to pursue a series of extraordinary opportunities for scholarship and service without regard for my national origin ‚Äî an experience that forged in me an unshakeable faith in the ability of this nation to help everyone to succeed, wherever they came from.\\" Suresh has consistently advocated for diversity in higher education. In 2014 he commented to the Pittsburgh Gazette that \\"Diversity in the broadest sense ‚Äî intellectual, cultural, ethnic, racial or national origin ‚Äî intrinsically enhances artistic and technical innovation\\".  Nanyang Technological University Singapore  Suresh was inaugurated as President of NTU Singapore in January 2018. He quickly launched an initiative to turn the NTU campus into a \\"smart\\" campus, with eco-friendly buildings, greater use of robotics, and driverless electric buses. He has overseen the establishment of the Alibaba-NTU Joint Research Institute on artificial intelligence, a collaboration with Volvo on driverless buses, a second artificial intelligence collaboration with SenseTime, and a collaboration with Surbana Jurong focused on urban challenges. On 27 August 2018, Suresh announced a 5-year plan with a number of major initiatives: * Creation of a new university-wide postdoctoral fellowship program to attract up to 350 of the best young scholars world-wide to NTU; * Recruitment of up to 300 faculty members; * Introduction of 300 new four-year Ph.D. fellowships; * Introduction of 100 new named professorships; * Construction of a 40,000 gross sq. m (400,000 gross sq. ft.) academic building by 2021, which will be the largest wooden building in Asia; * Doubling of the energy harvested from the sun, to up to 10MW, to power up to 10% of the electricity needs of the NTU campus by 2019; * A reduction in campus-wide energy consumption by 35% and 50% by 2021 and 2025, respectively, compared to 2011; * Streamlining of academic and administrative services to improve operational efficiency; and * A new S$10M fund (Accelerating Creativity and Excellence) for multidisciplinary research.  Research  Suresh's research is focused in three areas: modeling and engineering the mechanical properties of structural and functional materials, the mechanical properties of biological cells and molecules, and the implications of these properties for human disease. His work crosses traditional disciplinary boundaries in engineering, physical sciences, life sciences, and medicine. More than 100 students, postdoctoral fellows, and visiting scholars have been members of his research group, and many now occupy prominent positions in academia, industry, and government worldwide.

The airfield is a part of the former Ordensburg Vogelsang military training area. History The airfield was built as part of the National Socialist estate about 1935 for light courier aircraft operations. It was likely a grass airfield with a small aircraft parking area and possibly a hangar and a station building. In May 1940, as part of the buildup in western Germany prior to the Battle of France, the Luftwaffe stationed Kampfgeschwader 76 (KG 76) with Dornier Do 17Z light bombers, and Jagdgeschwader 3 and 21 (JG 3, JG 21) with Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighters at the airfield. All of these units moved into Belgium shortly after the invasion on 10 May.The Luftwaffe, 1933-45 Vogelsang was not used again by combat aircraft until 1945. In late February 1945, as a result of the Western Allied invasion of Germany, United States Army forces moved through the Eifel area and captured the airfield about 1 March. On 8 March the IX Engineer Command 816th Engineer Aviation Battalion moved in and began to construct an operational airfield for Allied aircraft. The engineers laid down a 3600' Pierced Steel Planking runway aligned 15/33 on the former Luftwaffe field to support all-weather operations on the site. On 23 March the airfield was designated as Advanced Landing Ground \\"Y-51 Vogelsang\\".IX Engineer Command ETO Airfields, Airfield Layout Its operational use by the USAAF was by the Ninth Air Force 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Group, which operated various photo-reconnaissance aircraft (P-38, P-51) from the airfield taking reconnaissance photos west of the Ludendorff Bridge supporting the advancing Ninth Army to close the Ruhr Pocket until the end of April 1945 when it moved into Central Germany. After the combat units moved out, the airfield remained open, supporting the Occupation forces in the area with transport supply flights until being closed on 10 July 1945.Maurer, Maurer.

History  The art of weaving developed in the region comprising Pakistan at a time when few other civilizations employed it. Excavations at Moenjodaro and Harappa - ancient cities of the Indus Valley civilization - have established that the inhabitants used spindles and spun a wide variety of weaving materials. Some historians consider that the Indus Valley civilization first developed the use of woven textiles.Ancient Textiles of the Indus Valley Region, by Jonathan Mark Kenoyer, published 2004 (in Tana Bana: The woven soul of Pakistan by Koel Publications, Karachi), University of Wisconsin, Madison. First Evidence of Cotton at Neolithic Mehrgarh, Pakistan: Analysis of Mineralized Fibres from a Copper Bead, published 2002, Journal of Archaeological Science. Carpet weaving may have been introduced into the area of present-day Pakistan as far back as the eleventh century with the coming of the first Muslim conquerors, the Afghan Ghaznavids and the Ghaurids. It can with more certainty be traced to the beginning of the Mughal Dynasty in the early sixteenth century, when the last successor of Timur, Babur, extended his rule from Kabul, Afghanistan to Dhaka, Bangladesh and founded the Mughal Empire. Under the patronage of the Mughals, local craftsmen adopted Persian techniques and designs. Carpets woven in the Punjab at that time (often called Lahore carpets today) made use of motifs and decorative styles found in Mughal architecture. Photograph of Carpet Weavers in Karachi Jail - 1873 During the Mughal period, the carpets made on the South Asia became so famous that demand for them spread abroad. These carpets boasted distinctive designs and high knot densities. Carpets made for the Mughal emperors, including Jahangir and Shah Jahan, were of the finest quality. Under Shah Jahan's reign, Mughal carpet-weaving took on a new aesthetic and entered its classical phase. The carpets woven in Lahore were the first to reach European markets, including England, as far back as Seventeenth century. During the British colonial era, prison weaving was established in district and female jails in cities such as Lahore and Karachi. Carpet-weaving outside of jails was revived after the independence when Pakistan's carpet-weaving industry flourished.Excerpts from the book, Oriental Rugs, by John Kimberly Mumford, published 1900, Charles Scribner‚Äôs Sons, New York. At present, hand-knotted carpets are made by Afghan refugees residing in Pakistan, making carpets and one of the country's leading export products. Hand-knotted rug manufacture is Pakistan's second- largest cottage and small industry. The craftsmen have the capacity to produce any type of carpet using all the popular motifs of guls, medallions, paisleys (botehs), traceries, and geometric designs in various combinations.Stone, Peter F.

He married Charlotte Bulkeley, daughter of Henry Bulkeley and Sophia Stuart, on 9 January 1696, at Saint- Germain-en-Laye, France. Henry Bulkeley was the \\"Master of the Household\\" for Kings Charles II and James II. The family fought as part of the Jacobite Irish Army during the War of the Two Kings, before going into exile in the Flight of the Wild Geese. Charles succeeded his brother Daniel O'Brien, 4th Viscount Clare, to the title as 5th Viscount Clare in the Jacobite Peerage on his brother's death from a mortal wound received in the Battle of Marsaglia, Italy 4 October 1693. Charles was transferred from the Queen's Dismounted Dragoons where he was colonel, to the command of O'Brien's Regiment on 6 April 1696. Later in the year he led the regiment in the siege of Valenza in Lombardy, and the next year they were stationed with the army at Meuse. By 1698 over one third of King James‚Äô army was either dead or crippled, and when the treaty of Ryswick ended the war between Louis and William, James‚Äô soldiers were disbanded, unemployed, and homeless. Many became beggars but others joined the Irish Brigade in the Spanish army, while others went to Austria and entered the Catholic Corps. Hostilities were renewed and Clare‚Äôs Regiment was assigned to the Army of Germany for two years in 1701-02. At the Battle of Cremona, in 1702, the Irishmen defended the town against Prince Eugene and the imperial army. The attack was to be a surprise but the Wild Geese foiled the attempt. The following year Lord Clare was promoted to brevet Brigadier of Infantry on 2 April 1703. A few months later on 20 September 1703, the unit took part in the successful Battle of Hochstedt, better known as the Battle of Blenheim and a year later was involved with the unsuccessful battle on 13 August 1704, at the second Battle of Blenheim. Although Clare‚Äôs Regiment experienced ups and downs, they were always admired. Two months after Blenheim, Charles rose to the brevet rank of Marshal-de-Camp on 26 October 1704, and a year later Lord Clare was assigned to the Army of the Moselle under the Marshel de Villars. Clare‚Äôs Regiment fought in the disastrous Battle of Ramillies on 23 May 1706, where they distinguished themselves with great glory, but Lord Clare was mortally wounded and died at Brussels, Belgium. Due to the great service the O'Brien family had given to France, and having risked all, King Louis XIV made sure that the regiment was kept in the family, and appointed Lt. Col. Murrough O'Brien (of the Carrigonnell O'Brien's) as its commander until the minor Charles came of age. Charles O'Brien and Charlotte Bulkeley had two children, Charles O'Brien, 6th Viscount Clare (27 Mar 1699 ‚Äì 9 Sep 1761) and Henry O'Brien (b. 12 Feb 1701).

History Clermont-Ganneau, followed by Macalister, identified the site with the tomb of the biblical matriarch Rachel based on the biblical text (). It can be hypothesised from the name Qaber Um Bene Israin, \\"Tombs of the Mothers of the Sons of Israel\\", that this is the tomb of Rachel (see ), or that there is a connection to the death and burial of the nurse Deborah \\"below Bethel\\" from , as well as to the passage about the oak of Tabor being near Rachel's tomb in 1 Samuel 10. The Israel Antiquities Authority survey gives the site the identification code Hizma, site number 480 in Benjamin, coordinates 17580 and 13880. Archaeological evidence shows that the site was occupied during the Middle Bronze Age. Excavation work was executed by Tzur Abeles, Excavation Permits granted by the Staff Officer for Archaeology in the West Bank, 1968-2007 who published the results in 1997. Bibliography list There were originally five structures, but one was demolished in the late 1980s to make way for the Ramallah bypass road.Etshalom, Yitzchak, Kever Rachel: The \\"Northern Theory\\", see part VII (pg. 6) Louis-Hugues Vincent researched the site and found five very large stone structures, between 10‚Äì53 metres long and 2.8-6.62 metres high, each with a funerary room in its centre. The rough-hewn stone blocks form rectangular walled structures. Vincent studied the building style and drew the conclusion that they were erected by Bronze Age nomadic shepherds, who would bring their dead back here and bury them inside the structures. When Vincent asked local inhabitants for the name of the site, they said Qubbur Bene Israin, \\"Tombs of the Sons of Israel\\". They called the largest structure Qaber Um Bene Israin, \\"Tomb of the Mother of the Sons of Israel\\".

It is the shorter and steeper of two primary hiking routes into the Enchantments, one of Washington's most popular hiking areas. It separates Colchuck Lake (elevation ) to the northwest from the Upper Enchantment Basin (elevation ~) to the southeast. Aasgard Pass is located at the saddle between Dragontail Peak and the Enchantment Peaks. Attempts to change the name officially in 1967 and 1988 were both turned down by the US Board on Geographic Names; thus, the name \\"Colchuck Pass\\" is retained on United States Geological Survey (USGS) maps. Mountaineers have long referred to the feature as Aasgard Pass, the name favored by famed climber and guide author Fred Beckey. The name was likely coined by Bill and Peggy Stark, who explored the Enchantments extensively in the mid-20th Century, and who gave Nordic mythological names to many of the lakes that previously had been named by A. H. Sylvester, a U.S. Geological Survey topographer supervisor of Wenatchee National Forest in the early 1900s who is credited with discovering the region. The official naming rulings of the US Board in the 1960s resulted in a mixture of the two name sets being adopted as official. The current policy of not adopting new names for geographic features in wilderness areas probably precludes the rest of the names identified by the Starks from ever achieving official status.  Deaths and Accidents  On August 6, 2010, a 52-year-old man was hiking and glissading with his son when he slipped and fell about 15 feet into a waterfall on Aasgard Pass. Stephen Grate led hikes in the Renton and Issaquah areas to teach the history of coal mining. On July 3, 2011, a 21-year-old student at Pacific Lutheran University named Julia A. Rutherford was glissading down Aasgard Pass with a group when she slipped and fell into a crevasse and into running glacial water. Officials say the woman fell in around 00:30am and because of the freezing temperatures of the water likely did not survive over 20 minutes. On June 5, 2016 a 24-year-old man named Qi He fell into a waterfall hole and died. Due to the snowpack, rescuers could not retrieve his body until a month after the accident. His family has asked local authorities to post warning signs at Colchuck Lake and the Enchantments trailhead to prevent future accidents. One June 5, 2017 a 19-year-old man named Benjamin Gore from Mercer Island was presumed dead after glissading into the same waterfall hole around 5 PM. His body was recovered on June 25, 2017 due to deep snow and fast-running water. In May 1998 Steve Smith, a Mountaineers Climbing Education Manager, slipped into a waterfall under the snowpack at Aasgard Pass. Steve managed to climb and dig his way back out and has documented his experience online at The Mountaineers' blog for others to learn about.https://www.mountaineers.org/blog/lessons-learned-2013-glissading- into-a-30-foot-hole-in-aasgard-passhttp://komonews.com/news/local/hidden- hazard-backcountry-hikers-on-snowfields References Aasgard Pass from above, with Colchuck Lake below External links * Category:Mountain passes of Chelan County, Washington Category:Mountain passes of Washington (state) Category:Mountain passes of the Cascades Category:Wenatchee National Forest ","title":"Aasgard Pass"},{"id":"24594005","text":"Ant√¥nio Olinto Marques da Rocha (Ub√°, MG - May 10, 1919 - Rio de Janeiro, RJ - September 12, 2009) was a Brazilian writer, essayist and translator.

It was part of the Action Bikes range, smaller in size than the Grifter but larger than the Boxer, with frame dimensions designed to accommodate 6 to 10 year olds.  Design and styling  The frame styling of the Strika visually resembles a BMX although it was probably intended to resemble a motorbike. The most notable features are the imitation front suspension forks and the chunky padded saddle. The Strika was heavy compared to a similar size BMX and reputed to have ungainly handling qualities for stunt riding. Early models of the Strika were fitted with a back pedal brake in addition to hand brakes. This feature was omitted from later models manufactured after approximately 1978. Known production colours are flame red, lime green, black, and silver. In 1980 the Strika was complemented by the Strika XL which differed only by having a yellow frame and blue tyres, and a saddle identical to that later used on the Mini Burner.Raleigh Action Bikes catalogue 1980  Successors  The Strika was replaced by the Burner and Mini Burner in the 1980s although the Raleigh brochures from 1982 and 1983 show both the Strika and the Strika XL being sold alongside the Burner.Raleigh Action Bikes catalogues 1982 and 1983 In the late 1990s, Raleigh released the Dirt Cross with a frame styling and design similar to that of the Strika.

They inhabit the region of the Fourth Cataract of the Nile. Similar to their neighbouring tribes, the mid-stream Manasir and the downstream Shaiqiyah (ÿßŸÑÿ¥ÿßŸäŸÇŸäŸëÿ©), the Rubatab are an Arab tribe in the Northern Sudan, with an archaic Arabic mother tongue. Culture=Communication The Rubatab people speak Arabic. Their accent is different from other tribes in Sudan, but the language is the same, including the alphabets. People from other tribes may have difficulty understanding them because of their distinct accent. People in Rubatab show respect for each other, even when it comes to greeting one another. They usually shake hands and put the right hand on the other person‚Äôs shoulder (for men) saying \\"salaam aleikum\\" and the other answers by saying \\"wa aleikumu salaam\\". Women show respect for each other by shaking hands, hugging or kissing each other on each cheek. People in the tribe have traditional Islamic names, like Mohammed and Ahmed.Masder, Nada. Personal interview. 29 Sept. 2009. Art forms The Rubatab people have a distinct dance style from other tribes. Weddings are the only occasions where men dance with women. The people generally prefer painting rather than crafting. Many people are farmers, and few are artists. A notable exception is Mohammed Sadiq, a famous comedian and actor. The music is simple, the instruments are homemade. Women play drums and men play tambour. Men and women have their own distinct drums. In local architecture, many one- story buildings are made with bricks and cement. Each home has two doors, one for men and one for women. The dress style is similar to the northern Sudanese people. Women wear toub that are one piece of generally a brightly colored cloth wrapped around the entire body and covering the hair. Underneath women wear dresses which are worn without the toub indoors. Men wear jalabiya, a traditional white full-length, long-sleeved gown with white trousers underneath. Wealthy Rubatab women wear jewellery to show their riches. Also, there is heavy emphasis on beauty in the eyes and women emphasize their eyes with eyeliner.Masder, Nada. Personal interview. 29 Sept. 2009. Social behavior The people of the Rubatab tribe play many different games. Girls play a game called \\"Higla\\". In this game, they draw a circle on the floor and throw rocks inside the circle and jump. Males play soccer and a game with rocks and sticks. They usually play these games after school or during break times. The Rubatab people follow Islamic holidays. They have many traditional foods. One is called asida (porridge in English), made from sorghum, and they eat it with a tomato sauce. Another dish is called gorassa, which looks like pancake, and it is eaten with tomato sauce. They have three meals each day, breakfast is at 10 a.m., lunch is at 3 p.m. and dinner (optional) is at 10 p.m. By tradition, when a child is born, the mother is not allowed to go out until 40 days after the birth. She stays at home with some relatives and friends. People come and give the mother money. On the seventh day after birth the child is officially named. A sheep or a cow is killed for a feast to celebrate this event. The size of the feast and the type of animal depends on the family's wealth. After 40 days have passed, there is another party, and the mother is free to leave the home. When someone dies, people call everyone from their family and all the family members come to the house. If the father dies, people close the room and wash the dead body. They wash the whole body with water, and afterwards they would put perfume on the body, and wrap it in white cloth. They put the body on a bed, and the body is then taken to the grave where it is buried according to Islamic procedures. When a husband dies, the wife wears white, and she stays in her home for four months and ten days. She is not supposed to put on any makeup as a sign of respect to the deceased.Masder, Nada. Personal interview. 5 Oct. 2009. Social structureRoles of women and girls= Women are responsible for the house and children. Women stay at home and raise the children. Girls usually stay at home and help their mothers to cook or do other tasks. Girls are allowed to go to school and work. Although generally expected to be in the home, they can have any job they want and are also allowed to finish school. In the past, girls were not allowed to go to school. Some believe it was not safe to send girls to school, but now girls have a right to go to school. =Roles of men and boys= Men work to feed their family. They also must make decisions with their wives. They often sit outside separately from women during times of leisure talk or play cards. Boys have more freedom and will play outside or spend time with the men. Some families follow these general rules and others do not. Many believe that boys and men are more important than girls. They generally have a higher status, and people prefer having sons to daughters. =Roles of young people= Teenagers have to respect the elders and must follow general social rules about interaction depending on their family's perception of these traditional rules. Girls must respect boys and act like ladies by paying attention to how they dress and act. Boys are expected to act strong and emulate men. Boys must respect traditional rules about decency, which include not touching women. =Roles of elders= Old people are respected and honored by others in society. Elders teach children how to respect other people and punish those who do not follow directions. =People and how they are important= Rubatab people honor those who are generous with them. =Choosing a spouse= In the past, the groom would send his family. The groom would introduce himself to the girl‚Äôs family. He would tell about himself, giving details to the family. The girl‚Äôs family would go and ask others in the community about the potential groom's character and reputation. Assuming all information gathered is favorable, he brings his family to introduce them to the other family. Men greet and socialize with the men and women with the women. Women bring gifts.Masder, Nada. Personal interview. 5 Oct. 2009. InstitutionsFamily= Most families in Rubatab give their son a house when he is ready to get married. The leader of the family is always the father. Mothers help make decision with the father, but the father is always the final decision. While some families follow traditional rules that show favoritism to boys, more recently some families treat girls more equally to boys. =Religion= The Rubatab people believe in Islam. Rubatab people trace their ancestry to Arabia. There is mutual respect for other tribes that believe in other religions. They are no other religions in the Rubatab tribe. =Government= Decisions are made by men mostly, but women do have rights if they treated fairly. Solutions are discussed and then put to a vote for a final decision. Meetings amongst decision-makers happen in safe place set aside for meetings. Meetings are often called by people in the government. =Rules= The rules in the group are respecting each other and treating people fairly. In the past, marriage outside the tribe was forbidden for both women and men. =Education= Girls and boys go to school. In some schools, girls sit separately from boys. There are girls' schools and boys' schools. The teachers are both male and female, but in high school usually women are the teachers. Subjects taught are mathematics, science and language, but the largest focus is on religion.Masder, Nada. Personal interview. 11 Oct. 2009. Economic base Jobs are similar to the world, such as engineering. Wealthy persons buy luxury cars and live in quality houses. Some people are self-employed. In the past people weren't allowed to trade anything to the other group, but the rules changed, and now some people do.Masder, Nada. Personal interview. 15 Oct. 2009.

Arrival at Fiji Most accounts place Savage as a sailor aboard a ship registered in Port Jackson (Sydney), Australia, from which he was left in Tonga around 1807. From Tonga he was taken to Fiji by the Eliza which was wrecked near Nairai Island. Exploits with the Bau Given his fluency of the Tongan and Fijian languages and proclivity for violence, Savage easily insinuated himself in the company of the Bau Island chieftain Naulivou. From the wreckage of the Eliza, Savage was able to salvage a number of muskets which he then demonstrated to the Bauan leaders. This combination of circumstance, personality, and technology allowed Savage to participate in the Fijian wars, allegedly the first time firearms were ever used in Fiji. Savage led a small group of beachcombers as mercenaries in the service of Naulivou and quickly showed their worth in fights with his enemies. Lacking certain cultural inhibitions of Fijians (such as targeting opposing chieftains at the outset of battle) and leveraging their individual skill with muskets proved Savage and company as a violent and capable force in Fijian internecine warfare. Savage is credited with using an arrow-proof structure built outside his enemies' fortifications so that he could fire at them with impunity. Other accounts of his lethality depict that his ‚Äúvictims were so numerous that the townspeople piled up the bodies and sheltered behind them; and the stream beside the village ran red.‚Äù For his services, Savage was accorded a certain amount of prestige and rewards from Naulivou, although the scope and magnitude of the more sensational details, to include numerous wives, influence on local politics, and becoming a cannibal chief in his own right, appear to be exaggerated accounts mixed with European yarns of ‚Äúwhite savages.‚Äù The events of Dillon's Rock In 1813, the Hunter reached Fiji to ply in the sandalwood trade and subsequently employed a number of local European beachcombers including Savage. As recounted by third mate Peter Dillon, Savage was killed in a skirmish with Wailea Fijians on September 6, 1813. Ashore as a member of a party to destroy Wailean canoes, Savage and the other scattered members of the party found themselves the victims of an ambush. They attempted to flee back to the anchored Hunter, but found ‚Äúit impossible to get to the boat through the crowds of natives that intercepted the pathway.‚Äù At this point Dillon directed the men to climb a flat-topped hill of a rock (which later became Dillon's Rock) and organized a defense. Because of its steep and narrow ascent, the rock could only be climbed by a few persons at a time, allowing the defenders to maximize their volleys. After some intense and sporadic exchanges, the Wailea fell back to a siege of sorts comprised (by Dillon‚Äôs accounting) of several thousand natives. At this point, Savage suggested that they break and run, but this was outrightly dismissed by Dillon, who, to further accentuate his resolve, threatened to shoot the first man who attempted to run. Using the lull in fighting to attempt to parlay, Dillon reminded the Wailea that eight of their own, including a priest‚Äôs brother, were held hostage on board the Hunter. Dillon proposed sending a man down to go to the ship to secure their release in exchange for the defenders. The Wailea agreed and so an injured defender was sent down to facilitate the transaction. During this ceasefire, several chiefs climbed the hill to implore the remaining defenders to accept offers of friendship and peace. Savage, confident in his knowledge of the language and customs was convinced that he could go down safely and secure some sort of resolution. Dillon disagreed and refused to leave the rock before the prisoner exchange, and allowed Savage to go only if he left his musket and ammunition behind. Savage then descended the rock and spoke with the Wailea for some time who continued to try to convince Dillon to join them but to no avail. Finally, exasperated by Dillon‚Äôs refusal to come down and triggered by another defender attempting to escape, the Wailea attacked the unarmed Savage and quickly overpowered him, eventually drowning him in a well. Dillon goes on to describe cannibalistic practices and rituals involved with Savage‚Äôs and the others‚Äô bodies, but those details have been disputed by others. Results of Savage's exploits The life of an archetypal beachcomber with few documented exploits has served as the legend- making clay of numerous writers and historians in the time since. Savage's influence (and by association muskets) on Fiji's history has been debated. Scholarly books and articles have examined Savage's legacy in terms of his aid in the rise of the Bau (and thus their subsequent dominance of Fiji), his introduction of firearms, and his role as an agent of social change with varying degrees of support and reproof.

He has been Chief Executive of the British Olympic Association, a Championship Football Club and a European Youth Olympic Festival. He was Chief Operating Officer of the inaugural 2015 European Games in Baku and also managed the British Biathlon Team and Team GB athletes at twelve Summer and Winter Olympic Games. In addition he orchestrated the national political and PR campaigns to persuade the Government and Mayor of London to bid for the 2012 Olympic Games. Early life Simon Clegg was born in Harlington, Middlesex and grew up in Godalming, Surrey and attended Stowe School in Buckingham. He spent two years as a trainee Quantity surveyor in Guildford and joined the Parachute Regiment as a territorial soldier. After two years later and a short period as a regular soldier in the Parachute Regiment he passed the selection process for entry into the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst. He was commissioned in 1981 into the Royal Regiment of Artillery and posted to 94th Locating Regiment in Celle, West Germany. After three seasons as a competitive cross country skier and biathlete he was in seconded for 12 months to the British Ski Federation. On his return to the Army he was selected to join the Royal Horse Artillery and in 1988 at the age of 28 completed the final year of his Short Service Commission by commanding a Battery in 7th Parachute Regiment Royal Horse Artillery.  British Biathlon Team  On secondment from the Army Clegg managed the British Biathlon Team for the 1984/85 season and was involved in World Cup races in Belarus and East Germany and a world championship event in Ruhpolding (West Germany). On returning to the Army in 1985 he was appointed part-time Manager of the National Development squad. Clegg was nominated by the British Ski Federation to be the British Olympic Association's Team Quartermaster for the 1988 Olympic Winter Games in Calgary, Subsequently was asked to manage the sole British ski jumper Eddie 'The Eagle' Edwards. He undertook a similar role as Team GB's Quartermaster at the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul. British Olympic Association On leaving the Army in 1989 Clegg joined the British Olympic Association as Assistant General Secretary becoming Deputy General Secretary two years later and in 1997 became the organisation's first Chief Executive. In 1990, he was seconded to help manage the IOC Session in Birmingham and in 1995 was Chief Executive of the European Youth Olympic Festival in Bath, the largest international multi-sport youth event ever staged in the UK, involving 48 countries, 10 sports and 2600 athletes. In total Clegg managed Team GB athletes at twelve Olympic and Olympic Winter Games, six as Team GB's Chef de Mission including Salt Lake City (Team GB's most successful Olympic Winter Games since 1936) and Beijing (Team GB's most successful Olympic Games since London in 1908). In Beijing he achieved the aspirational target that he'd set for Team GB in London of fourth place in the medals table (for which he had been ridiculed in certain parts of the British media) four years early. During the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Clegg controversially decided to take the International Equestrian Federation to the Court of Arbritation for Sport over a judging decision in the three-day event. The court found in favour of the British Team, who were supported in the action by France and the US, resulting in Leslie Law winning the gold medal, Pippa Funnell winning the bronze medal and the entire team being upgraded from bronze to silver medalists. These medals were presented by Her Royal Highness The Princess Royal in the presence of Her Majesty The Queen at the Team GB reception at Buckingham Palace after the Games. 2012 Olympic Games Clegg was part of Manchester's failed bids for the 1996 and 2000 Olympic Games. In 1997 on his appointment as the British Olympic Association's Chief Executive he, together with his Chairman, Craig Reedie and Project Manager, David Luckes, set about exploring whether London could host an Olympic Games. Clegg orchestrated the political and PR campaigns which culminated in the announcement in the House of Commons by the Prime Minister that London would bid for 2012. Clegg handed the project over to the bid committee headed up initially by Barbara Cassani and then subsequently Seb Coe. He was a board member of the bid, one of three British signatories on the host city contract in Singapore and subsequently a board member of LOCOG until he resigned on leaving the British Olympic Association after the Beijing Olympic Games. Clegg was however invited by Lord Coe, the LOCOG Chairman, to retain his position on the LOCOG Sports Advisory Group where he remained until the closing ceremony. During the 2012 Olympic Games, Clegg was appointed as the official Olympic Attache for Guam. Ipswich Town Clegg was appointed Chief Executive of Ipswich Town in April 2009 replacing Derek Bowden and working directly with the club's owner Marcus Evans. One of his first tasks was to replace the manager, Jim Magilton with former Sunderland FC manager with Roy Keane on a two-year contract that was terminated on 7 January 2011. Paul Jewell replaced Keane until he resigned in October 2012 whereupon the former Wolves FC manager, Mick McCarthy was appointed with whom Clegg worked until he himself resigned in February 2013. It is reported that Clegg obstinately supported Liverpool FC in his childhood because his father was a Manchester United shareholder. From 2007- 2009 Clegg was a member of the Chelsea FC Advisory Board. 2015 European Games In 2013, Clegg was appointed as the European Olympic Committee's Senior Consultant (subsequently Executive Director) for the European Games in Baku. In 2014, he replaced Jim Scherr as the Organising Committee's Chief Operating Officer and relocated to Azerbaijan. He led a team of 2,500 full-time staff, supported by 12,000 volunteers, to deliver an event with a global television audience of 823 million households in an unprecedented compressed timescale. Honours/Awards He was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 2001 for his management of Team GB at the 2000 Olympic Games (Team GB's most successful Olympic Games since 1920) and a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2005 for his contribution to the London Olympic bid. The President of the Republic of Azerbaijan awarded Clegg the Dostlug Order in July 2015 for his contribution to the success of the inaugural European Games. In 2008, he was awarded the British Sports Journalists' JL Manning award for outstanding services off the field of play and in 2012 an Honorary Degree from University Campus Suffolk.

It was open from 1851 to November 2012. , the grounds was still owned by the State of Illinois. History Illinois originally did not have any system for caring for its mentally ill citizens who were either living with their family or kept in local almshouses. Dorothea Dix lobbied the state legislature to create a facility in Illinois designed for the care of the mentally ill. On March 1, 1847, the legislature established the Illinois State Asylum and Hospital for the Insane with a nine-member board of trustees that was empowered to appoint a superintendent, purchase land within four miles of Jacksonville, and construct facilities. (L. 1847, p. 52). At the time, only two other states had state-operated facilities for the mentally ill. The hospital was created to shift the economic burden of the mentally ill onto the state, which paid all of the patients' expenses. However, patients (or their county of residence) remained responsible for transportation, clothing and incidentals. At the time, institutions for the mentally ill either had a number of small cottages, or a single large central building under the Kirkbride Plan. The trustees selected Kirkbride's approach for the new institution. The center building was five and a half stories high, with two separate wings for each gender extending with staggered setbacks from the center. In 1984, the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, although it was demolished in the 1970s.http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/IL/Morgan/state.html Retrieved 2009-10-11. Construction of the buildings was begun in 1848 and James M. Higgins was hired as Superintendent. Although Dix had expressed interest that Jacksonville State Hospital be opened by 1849, it wasn't until November 3, 1851, that the first two wards were ready for occupancy and the first patient, Sophronia McElhiney, of McLean County, was admitted. In 1860, Elizabeth P.W. Packard's husband had her committed to Jacksonville against her will, due to a disagreement over her religious beliefs. At the time, Illinois law (which was enacted when the hospital opened) had an exception to its commitment hearing requirement to allow husbands to confine their wives to an asylum without any hearing. After three years, she was discharge from the hospital. Her husband then imprisoned her in their home, and after gaining her freedom through a lawsuit, she formed the Anti-Insane Asylum Society. She led a campaign to amend the Illinois law to guarantee a public hearing for all people declared insane, including women whose husbands wished to have them committed. She also saw similar laws passed in three other states. Jacksonville remained Illinois' only such hospital until two additional facilities, the hospital at Elgin and the hospital at Anna, were authorized in 1869, and the legislature renamed Jacksonville as the Illinois Central Hospital for the Insane, assumed primary responsibility for patients from the counties of central Illinois. As a part of this reorganization, the legislature also reduced the size of Jacksonville's board of trustees to three members and the newly created a new statewide Board of State Commissioners of Public Charities to supervise all state institutions while each one retained its own separate board. When the Board of State Commissioners of Public Charities was abolished in 1909, the institute was reorganized and renamed Jacksonville State Hospital effective January 1, 1910. In 1917, the Department of Public Welfare assumed responsibility for Jacksonville State Hospital and retained control until the creation of the Illinois Department of Mental Health in 1961 (L. 1961, p. 2666). From 1944 to 1974, the hospital provided training in psychiatric nursing for students from general hospital nursing schools. Jacksonville's Psychiatric Nursing Affiliation Program, which was headed by the State Alienist. Retrieved 2009-10-06. In 1974, Jacksonville State Hospital's duties expanded beyond in-patient care of mental illness to include treatment for the *developmentally disabled.\\" To reflect this change in mission, the legislature renamed it the Jacksonville Mental Health and Developmental Center' in 1975. (P.A. 79-581, p. 1895.) Jacksonville phased out its in-patient treatment of mental illness and its name was changed one last time to reflect its new mission. Final years When closed, the Jacksonville Developmental Center treated primarily developmentally delayed patients, some of whom also had mental illnesses.

It is 1,214 hectares in size and it was named in honour of Sir Gerald Templer, a British High Commissioner in Malaya. \\"On 8 September 1954, His Highness the Sultan of Selangor, the late Sultan Hishamuddin Alam Shah declared that Templer‚Äôs Park was 'dedicated by Selangor to serve as a refuge and a sanctuary for wildlife and a meeting-place for all who love and respect the beauty of nature'. The following year the government gazetted the area as ‚Äúa Botanical Garden and Public Park‚Äù under the land enactment (Notification 104-1955)\\".http://www.mns.my/article.php?aid=2037 This forest reserve consists of multi-tiered waterfalls, jungle streams and trails. Several amenities are available in this forest reserve, such as picnic grounds, fishing spots, parking lots, public toilets and stalls. Wildlife that can be spotted in Templer's Park include the park monkey, the hawk-cuckoo, the crested serpent eagle, the emerald dove, the forest wagtail, malkohas, the barbet, the woodpecker, the flycatcher-shrike, the blue-winged leafbird, the earless agamid, the Malaysian crested lizard, various kinds of toads and snakes and serow (goat-antelopes). Studies by Malaysian Nature Society have confirmed that there is still a population of serow living in the vicinity.http://www.mns.my/article.php?aid=2037 The cave, Gua Anak Takun, is home to a rare species of trapdoor spider, Liphistius batuensis. Templar Park is the type locality where the holotype of the Malaysian spine-jawed snake Xenophidion schaeferi was collected in 1988. To date this is the only known specimen of this rare snake, which belongs in the obscure and primitive snake family Xenophidiidae. The family contains only one other species, X. acanthognathus, also only known from its holotype, which was collected in Sabah, northeast Borneo. These snakes are harmless, nonvenomous, and thought to feed on earthworms or insect larvae. Threats from Development The integrity and natural character of Templer's Park is under threat from controversial recent developments which are apparently either a.) adjacent to the park on former parkland which was sold to private interests, or b.) illegally taking place on actual parkland. Developments such as T-Parkland@Templer's Park by the company MCT involved the construction of high-end residences, a 17-story tower block and golf courses. In addition, currently some 50 hectares of ongoing deforestation is taking place for a road and more residences, which will likely impact the quality of the streams in the park due to erosion if this activity continues. Surprisingly, this activity seems to have the consent of the local planning authorities, where the site sign carries the license number 'US HS 3 2012 BALAK'.http://www.mns.my/article.php?aid=2037 The authorities appear to be unconcerned about this steady loss of forest to developers and have 'yet to lift a finger' according to a local nature resource.http://www.naturemalaysia.com/templer-park.htm Accessibility Templer's Park can be accessed from the Rawang exit of the North‚ÄìSouth Expressway. The park can also be reached by taking the No 66 bus from Puduraya in Kuala Lumpur. Incidents In 2008, a Danish man went missing for 12 hours in Templer's Park before finding his way out of the jungle. He went missing at an altitude of 500 feet above sea level.

MacHugo was a merchant trading in tobacco until found guilty of smuggling, which led to revenue officers impounding his entire stock and putting him out of business. He became involved in the United Irishman movement, acting as a link between members in Loughrea and its environs and in Dublin. He was a close associate of Francis Dillon and Peter Finnerty, all of whom helped build the society's network in the town, especially among its lower-class tradesmen. When Finnerty was imprisoned in spring 1798, he continued to stay in touch with the society in Loughrea via MacHugo; a report dated April 1798 stated that \\"There is strong ground to think that Peter Finnerty corresponds with his friends in this town thro' this man.\\" His activities with the United Irishmen led to Richard Trench, 2nd Earl of Clancarty, stating that local people were being taught \\"the secret introduction of modern philosophical opinions.\\" Administration of seditious oaths and violent outbreaks, especially in the Slieve Aughty region, were on the rise at the time. However, because guns and ammunition were successfully seized by the authorities, when the actual Irish Rebellion of 1798 broke out, County Galway remained quiet. In January 1799 MacHugo was still under surveillance, as the county was again disturbed and fears of a further rising were very great. Despite this, MacHugo remained free, and fades from the historical record afterward.

PACCS was designed to ensure that National Command Authority would retain sole, exclusive, and complete control over US nuclear weapons. Among other components, it included Strategic Air Command assets such as the Looking Glass aircraft and mission, and various hardened command and control facilities. The belief by the Soviet Union in the reliability of PACCS was a crucial component of the US mutual assured destruction doctrine, ensuring a long term stalemate. Peacetime Orbits of PACCS aircraft (c. 1972) History The Strategic Air Command headquarters staff, under the direction of General Thomas S. Power conducted the feasibility of placing a continuous command and control element in an airborne mode. The purpose of such a system would be to use the aircraft as a platform for specially installed communications equipment to insure delivery of command directives to SAC strike forces in the event ground-based headquarters were destroyed. The original plan envisioned an aircraft, crew, and command and control team on 15-minute ground alert. This was later changed to a continuous airborne alert posture. The functions of this PACCS Airborne Command Post kept expanding until it became a true alternate command and control system, complete with force status monitoring, initiation or relay of launch/execution directives, a battle staff, communications to support an alternate CINCSAC, and limited capabilities to reconstitute and replan residual resources. PACCS, in later variants, included an Airborne Launch Control System (ALCS) capability, which provided an alternate means for execution message delivery to missile combat crews and a back-up launch control center, forcing the Soviet Union to target each missile silo, rather than just the launch control centers to incapacitate the Minuteman force.Strategic Air Command: \\"Weapon Systems Acquisition 1964-1979\\", 28 Apr 1980 Components=Airborne *E-4B National Emergency Airborne Command Post (NEACP) **1st Airborne Command and Control Squadron - Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska *EC-135 Airborne Command Post (ABNCP) \\"Looking Glass\\" **2d Airborne Command and Control Squadron - Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska **4th Airborne Command and Control Squadron - Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota **22d Air Refueling Squadron - March Air Force Base, California; West Auxiliary Command Post (West AUXCP) 2d Airborne Command and Control Squadron history ***Ground Entry Point - Lamar, ColoradoIRIS #010808041 - Post Attack Command and Control System overview **99th Air Refueling Squadron - Westover Air Force Base, Massachusetts; East Auxiliary Command Post (East AUXCP) Strategic Air Command Regulation 100-24 Vol III: SAC Communications System Operations/EWO Support Requirements, 6 Jul 1979 ***Ground Entry Point - Plano, Illinois **913th Air Refueling Squadron - Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana; Central Auxiliary Command Post (Central AUX) ***Ground Entry Point - Lyons, Nebraska *EB-47L **4362d Post Attack Command and Control Squadron - Lincoln Air Force Base, Nebraska **4363d Post Attack Command and Control Squadron - Lockbourne Air Force Base, Ohio **4364th Post Attack Command and Control Squadron - Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho **4365th Post Attack Command and Control Squadron - Plattsburgh Air Force Base, New York Ground * Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana (Second Air Force (later Eighth Air Force) Command Post) * Westover Air Force Base, Massachusetts (Eighth Air Force Combat Operations Center, aka \\"The Notch\\") * March Air Force Base, California (Fifteenth Air Force Command Post) *Grissom Air Force Base, Indiana * Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska (Strategic Air Command Headquarters) **Headquarters Emergency Relocation Team (HERT) - Cornhusker Army Ammo Plant, Grand Island, NebraskaYahoo!

He served an apprenticeship in the shipbuilding yard Pile & Co. at West Hartlepool.Debretts Guide to the House of Commons 1886 In his spare time, he studied foreign languages and other subjects and this helped him develop a career in the iron and steel industry. Iron merchant Jacks moved to a shipyard in Sunderland, and then became manager of Sunderland and Seaham Engine Works and Foundry. With his language skills, he was sent on an errand to Italy to intercept goods that the buyer did not intend to pay for, and not only retrieved the goods, but sold them at a higher price and obtained fresh business for his employers. He was encouraged to join a business in Glasgow in 1870 and founded the iron and steel merchants William Jacks & Co in 1880. He built and sold steamers, completed large contracts for ironwork, and became a director of several companies. It was in the 1885 that Jacks took as a junior partner in the firm Bonar Law, future Conservative prime minister.Andrew Taylor: Bonar Law, Haus Publishing, 2006 Although Jacks' politics were on the opposite side of those of the junior partner, his example may have had an influence on the younger man.George Eyre-Todd Who's Who in Glasgow in 1909 ‚Äì Andrew Bonar Law Glasgow Digital Library Political career In 1885 Jacks was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Leith District of Burghs but in the 1886 general election which followed Gladstone played what was known as the \\"Leith dirty trick\\", standing unopposed and thus ousting his former supporter. In the by-election which followed in August 1886 when Gladstone decided to resume the Midlothian seat he had feared losing, Jacks stood as a Liberal Unionist, but was heavily defeated. In the 1892 general election Jacks stood again as a Liberal and was elected MP for Stirlingshire, but lost that seat in 1895.Craig, op. cit., page 561 Jacks was elected Chairman of the British Iron Trade Association in 1893 and was afterwards President of the West of Scotland Iron and Steel Institute and of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce.

The palace is one of the most outstanding examples of Neoclassical architecture in Latvia.  History  In 1795, Empress Catherine II of Russia granted Charlotte von Lieven (1742‚Äì1828), the tutor of her grandchildren, a lifetime use of the property at Me≈æotne. In 1797, Emperor Paul I of Russia turned it into the hereditary estate of the Lieven family. In 1799, he raised her to the title of countess. In 1826 she was raised by Nicholas I of Russia to a princess. During the last years of the Duchy of Courland's history, the manor was rented by Johann Friedrich von Medem. His daughter Anna Charlotte Dorothea married Duke Peter of Courland. The construction of the manor house was started in 1797 under the guidance of the architect Johann Georg Adam Berlitz. He used the neo-classical design by the Italian architect Giacomo Quarenghi and added side avant-corps to the building. The construction work was completed in 1802. An English style landscape park and complex of subsidiary buildings were added to the ensemble. A previous manor house already existed next to it and was renovated to become the caretaker's house and administrative centre.Mezotne manor manager's house (the old manor house) Other buildings include the dairy, stables, distillery, and others, which was able to make the estate largely self-sufficient.Mezotne manor dairy Charlotte von Lieven lived permanently in St. Petersburg, together with the Czar's family. Only once did she have an opportunity to visit her estate at Me≈æotne. In 1818 she accompanied Empress Maria Feodorovna on her journey to Germany and on 2 September arrived in Me≈æotne. They spent one day there and left early in the morning. After the death of Charlotte von Lieven in 1828, the manor was inherited by her son Johann who had returned to Me≈æotne in 1817 after his military service in the Russian army. His son Paul, the master of ceremonies at the Russian court and land marshal of the Vidzeme Knighthood, expanded his estate by obtaining the Bauska Manor with its castle ruins as well as Derpele and Krimulda Manors in Vidzeme. In 1881 Me≈æotne was inherited by Paul Lieven's son Anatol. He started his career in St. Petersburg, but when he attained the rank of lieutenant of the Guards Cavalry, he left the army and settled in Me≈æotne. The house suffered severe damage in 1919, when it was looted by the warlord Pavel Bermondt-Avalov's troops. In 1920, Prince Anatol Lieven was dispossessed of the estate as a result of the Latvian government's agrarian reform.4.100 sakoptakie kulturas pieminekli Latvija, Riga, Valsts kulturas piemineklu aizsardzibas inspekcija, 2005. It was used from 1921 until 1944 as the local agricultural school. During World War II, the manor was partially destroyed by artillery shells fired by the Soviet army in 1944. In 1946, the manor was taken over by the Latvian Agricultural Experiment Station. Restoration work started at the end of 1958. In 1996, the house was transferred to the control of the State Real Estate Agency, which carried out extensive reconstruction and restoration work in 2001, and a hotel opened. The house and grounds are used today also for conferences and wedding receptions and other events.  Architecture  The facade to the front has a portico with four columns, the part to the park has a semi-rotunda that both correspond to the design by Giacomo Quarenghi. The bel √©tage is located on the first floor, which can be accessed by a staircase that was built in the second half of the 19th century. The domed main hall stretches over two storeys, which was also designed by Giacomo Quarenghi. The main hall is in the centre of the house, on either sides are various salons and the dining room. The hall is built in the neoclassical style and the space was influenced by the Pantheon in Rome. The third floor was used as living quarters and guest rooms. The interior used to be filled with paintings, sculptures, porcelain and furniture.  Garden  The park stretches behind the house and is styled in the English landscape garden. It goes down to the bank of the Lielupe River. Sheep are used to graze the grass and keep it trim.

Henry Schr√∂der Bank; and senior manager of the paintings department at Sotheby‚Äôs Geneva. Elizabeth also regularly collaborates, and occasionally curates, exhibitions and special art events. In 1999, she dreamed of bringing art out of the closed spaces that galleries are and making it accessible to a much larger public without necessarily jeopardizing artistic quality and integrity. She was one of the co-founders of Eyestorm ‚Äì an online gallery allowing a whole new audience to access artistic content for the first time. Since then, she focused on fostering and highlighting innovative ways of displaying art. Projects The 46664 - 1 Minute of Art to Aids project commissioned leading world artists to create one-minute films representing their vision on HIV/AIDS. In 2007 she also published the book Adam au Chromaland which is a cartoon that integrates artworks in its story.

It is part of the College of Fine and Applied Arts, at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. The facility includes three tea rooms, or Chashitsu, a tea garden (Roji) and Japanese rock garden. It currently conducts classes in Japanese tea ceremony, Japanese Aesthetics and Ikebana for university students and members of the community. An annual event at the house welcomes international students. In 2019 an expansion effort was under way. Japan House History Japanese artist Shozo Sato arrived at Krannert Center for the Performing Arts as an artist-in-residence in 1964, and began teaching tea ceremony. He struggled to find the right setting for the classes, sometimes even teaching them from his own home. Eventually, after several years, Morton Weir, then Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs, now Chancellor Emeritus, heard of the rising popularity of these tea ceremonies. He arranged for Professor Sato to be able to use an old Victorian house on campus, at Lincoln Avenue and California (now the site of the Alice B. Campbell Alumni Center). In the early 1990s Professor Sato retired, leaving the community, and the old Victorian was torn down for redevelopment. Professor Kimiko Gunji, a longtime teaching assistant of Professor Sato, approached her tea school in Japan, the Urasenke Foundation of Tea, and they agreed to donate two tearooms for a new Japan House. With that commitment in hand, Professor Gunji and then Associate Provost Roger Martin moved ahead, receiving commitments for $100,000 from the Japan Illini Club, the Commemorative Association for the Japan World Exposition and the Japan Foundation Center for Global Partnership. The University had selected a site within the relatively new Arboretum for Japan House. Architect Jack Baker and the firm of Isaksen Glerum Architects PC designed the structure and construction began. Japanese master carpenter, Seiji Suzuki, then visited and installed three Japanese tearooms into the empty building. The new Japan House was dedicated on June 18, 1998. Over the years, Japan House has been the site of many programs, events and visits, ranging from tea ceremonies, presentations and performances of traditional Japanese culture. Japan House has also worked with other units on campus, working to bring Japanese exhibitions and performances to Krannert Center for the Performing Arts, the Spurlock Museum, and Krannert Art Museum. In 2012 Professor Jennifer Gunji-Ballsrud became the third director of Japan House, after the retirement of her mother, Kimiko Gunji. Not long afterwards, Professor Shozo Sato returned to the Champaign-Urbana community.

His gr-gr-gr-gr-gr-grandfather was Conchobar √ì Cellaigh (died 1268), a notable ruler of the kingdom. Se√°n lived in the parish of Creagh, Ballinasloe, and was described by historian Rev Jerome Fahey as: > an exceedingly influential petty-chief, holding a position astride the main > highway into western Connacht. Morne na Maighe, his daughter (or sister?) > was the wife of Domhnall √ì Madadhan, lord of S√≠ol Anmchadha, the territory > to the south of Clonmacnowen. ..in the sixteenth century [he] occupied > Creagh castle. As a result of the strategic importance of his lands, and their extensiveness, he was sought out by the Castle Administration in Dublin, who hoped to make him abandon the Gaelic Brehon laws and become a loyal subject of the crown. In an effort to secure his lands from other √ì Cellaighs, and to obtain the protection of the crown, Se√°n made a submission of Surrender and regrant in 1578, acknowledging the rule of Elizabeth I. For this he was rewarded with the legal title to his impressive list of property. The Fiants list them as: > all the manors and lands in Towyn alias Twunsrwra, Creagh, killynmalron, > Behagh, Downe(lowe), Garwalle, Clonekyn, Balledonyllan, Tolrose, Keil, > Garraf, Cowllery, Colleghcally, Cornesharrog, Lurce, Cillalachdan, > Parklosnisker, Ballylough, and Belligh, Cos.

Se√°n's surrender to the laws of the Crown were part and parcel of the Surrender and Regrant policy pursued in sixteenth-century Ireland. It enabled Se√°n's family, in the eyes of the crown, to legally hold their lands according to the English legal system. However, much of this land was confiscated in the aftermath of the Irish Confederate Wars by the Cromwellian administration.

It is a neeti (moral) Shatakam. Sataka Karta (Sataka Creator)  Sumati Satakam is composed of more than a 100 poems (padyalu). According to many literary critics Sumati Satakam was reputedly composed by Baddena Bhupaludu (AD 1220-1280). He was also known as Bhadra Bhupala. He was a Chola prince and was a Vassal under the Kakatiya empress Rani Rudrama Devi during the thirteenth century. He was a pupil of Tikkana, the greatest writer in Telugu. If we assume that the Sumatee Satakam was indeed written by Baddena, it would rank as one of the earliest Satakams in Telugu along with Vrushadhipa Satakam of Palkuriki Somanatha and Sarveswara Satakam by Yathavakkula Annamayya. The Sumatee Satakam is also one of the earliest Telugu works to be translated into European languages. Sri Riasat Ali Taj (1930-1999) a prominent personality, poet, author, critic, writer, educationist, linguist & translator from Karimnagar has made poetic translations (Manzoom Tarjuma in Urdu Rubaiyaat) published in popular Urdu magazines and news papers in early 1950s. Features Sumati Satakam has been extremely popular for a long time with parents and teachers who try to teach the right conduct and social values to young children. The language used is very simple. The poems have the musical quality of classical meters. Most of the words are simple Telugu. The use of Sanskrit words is very limited. There are hardly any words unfamiliar to modern readers. The poems do not look anything like the sophisticated compositions using the highly cultivated language of . Since the Telugu used by the author is so close to what the common people used, the poems look surprisingly familiar to the users of the Telugu. The poems have an astonishing communication power. All the poems are in kanda padyam meter. Being in short meter and being unconnected to each other the poems are easy to remember. Even if one does not remember the entire poem, it is commonplace to quote some gem like statements from the Satakam. Each generation of school children learns some of them during elementary and high schools.

It is included in all 64-bit versions of Windows‚Äîincluding Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, IA-64 and x64 versions of Windows Server 2003, as well as 64-bit versions of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10. In Windows Server 2008 R2 Server Core, it is an optional component, . WoW64 aims to take care of many of the differences between 32-bit Windows and 64-bit Windows, particularly involving structural changes to Windows itself. Translation libraries The WoW64 subsystem comprises a lightweight compatibility layer that has similar interfaces on all 64-bit versions of Windows. It aims to create a 32-bit environment that provides the interfaces required to run unmodified 32-bit Windows applications on a 64-bit system. WOW64 is implemented using several DLLs, some of which include: # \`Wow64.dll\`, the core interface to the Windows NT kernel that translates (thunks) between 32-bit and 64-bit calls, including pointer and call stack manipulations # \`Wow64win.dll\`, which provides the appropriate entry-points for 32-bit applications (win32k thunks) # \`Wow64cpu.dll\`, which takes care of switching the processor from 32-bit to 64-bit mode. This is used in x86-64 implementations of Windows only. Other DLLs and binaries are included for Itanium and ARMv8 64-bit architectures to provide emulation to x86 or for 32-bit entry points if the architecture has a native 32-bit operating mode. Architectures Despite its outwardly similar appearance on all versions of 64-bit Windows, WoW64's implementation varies depending on the target instruction set architecture. For example, the version of 64-bit Windows developed for the Intel Itanium 2 processor (known as the IA-64 architecture) uses \`Wow64win.dll\` to set up the emulation of x86 instructions within the Itanium 2's unique instruction set. This emulation is a much more computationally expensive task than the \`Wow64win.dll\`'s functions on the x86-64 architecture, which switches the processor hardware from its 64-bit mode to compatibility mode when it becomes necessary to execute a 32-bit thread, and then handles the switch back to 64-bit mode. Registry and file system The WoW64 subsystem also handles other key aspects of running 32-bit applications. It is involved in managing the interaction of 32-bit applications with the Windows components such as the Registry, which has distinct keys for 64-bit and 32-bit applications. For example, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\Software\\\\Wow6432Node is the 32-bit equivalent of HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\Software (although 32-bit applications are not aware of this redirection). Some Registry keys are mapped from 64-bit to their 32-bit equivalents, while others have their contents mirrored, depending on the edition of Windows. The operating system uses the \`%SystemRoot%\\\\system32\` directory for its 64-bit library and executable files. This is done for backward compatibility reasons, as many legacy applications are hardcoded to use that path. When executing 32-bit applications, WoW64 transparently redirects 32-bit DLLs to \`%SystemRoot%\\\\SysWoW64\`, which contains 32-bit libraries and executables. Exceptions from these redirects are %SystemRoot%\\\\system32\\\\catroot %SystemRoot%\\\\system32\\\\catroot2 %SystemRoot%\\\\system32\\\\driverstore %SystemRoot%\\\\system32\\\\drivers\\\\etc %SystemRoot%\\\\system32\\\\logfiles %SystemRoot%\\\\system32\\\\spool %SystemRoot%\\\\system32\\\\driverstore (only for Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP) 32-bit applications are generally not aware that they are running on a 64-bit operating system. 32-bit applications can access \`%SystemRoot%\\\\System32\` through the pseudo directory \`%SystemRoot%\\\\sysnative\`. There are two Program Files directories each visible to both 32-bit and 64-bit applications. The directory that stores the 32 bit files is called Program Files (x86) to differentiate between the two, while the 64 bit maintains the traditional Program Files name without any additional qualifier. Application compatibility 32-bit applications that include only 32-bit kernel-mode device drivers, or that plug into the process space of components that are implemented purely as 64-bit processes (e.g. Windows Explorer) cannot be executed on a 64-bit platform. 32-bit service applications are supported. The SysWOW64 folder located in the Windows folder on the OS drive contains several applications to support 32-bit applications (e.g. cmd.exe, odbcad32.exe, to register ODBC connections for 32-bit applications). 16-bit legacy applications for MS-DOS and early versions of Windows are usually incompatible with 64-bit versions of Windows Vista, 7, 8, and 10, but can be run on a 64-bit Windows OS via Microsoft Virtual PC or DOSBox. 32-bit versions of Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 10 on the other hand, can usually run 16-bit applications with few to no problems. 16-bit applications cannot be directly run under x64 editions of Windows, because the CPU does not support VM86 mode when running in x64. Internet Explorer is implemented as both a 32-bit and a 64-bit application because of the large number of 32-bit ActiveX components on the Internet that would not be able to plug into the 64-bit version. Previously, the 32-bit version was used by-default and it was difficult to set the 64-bit version to be the default browser. This changed in Internet Explorer 10, which ran 32-bit add-ons inside a 64-bit session, eliminating the need to switch between the two versions. If a user was to go into the 32-bit folder (typically C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Internet Explorer) and double-click the iexplore.exe file there, the 64-bit version will still load. In Internet Explorer 9 and previous, this would load only the 32-bit version. , a bug in the translation layer of the x64 version of WoW64 also renders all 32-bit applications that rely on the Windows API function GetThreadContext incompatible. Such applications include application debuggers, call stack tracers (e.g. IDEs displaying call stack) and applications that use garbage collection (GC) engines. One of the more widely used but affected GC engines is the Boehm GC. It is also used as the default garbage collector of the equally popular Mono. While Mono has introduced a new (but optional) GC as of October 2010 called SGen-GC, it performs stack scanning in the same manner as Boehm GC, thus also making it incompatible under WoW64. No fix has been provided, although workarounds have been suggested. Performance According to Microsoft, 32-bit software running under WOW64 has similar performance to executing under 32-bit Windows, but with fewer threads possible and other overheads. A 32-bit application can be given a full 4 gigabytes of virtual memory on a 64-bit system, whereas on a 32-bit system, some of this addressable memory is lost because it is used by the kernel and memory-mapped peripherals such as the display adaptor, typically resulting in apps being able to use either 2GB or 3GB of RAM at most.

The episode aired on November 2, 2009. Plot Hiro Nakamura arrives three years in the past to save the love of his life, Charlie Andrews. Shortly after arriving, Hiro encounters Sylar, who proceeds into the diner. Charlie pours coffee for her would-be assassin, who startles her after Sylar reveals he knows about her aneurysm. Hiro watches from afar, wondering how he can stop Sylar. Meanwhile, in the present, Samuel Sullivan is worried for his dying friend Arnold, who has the ability to manipulate space-time like Hiro, and intends to have Hiro replace him. When Samuel wonders where he could be, Lydia reveals that Hiro had loved Charlie before she died, correctly deducing Hiro must have gone back in time to save her. Samuel asks Arnold one last time to be sent back, and appears by Hiro. Samuel warns Hiro of the implications to history he could cause by saving Charlie. Hiro asserts Charlie is that important to him, and promises to keep everything else in balance. Noah Bennet is also at the diner, oblivious to what is about to happen, meeting with his partner, Lauren. The two seem to have been together for sometime, with Lauren taking the initiative and offering a key to her motel room. Noah is reluctant, but takes the key, as he is more worried about his daughter Claire Bennet's fate in the upcoming homecoming game. After meeting with Isaac Mendez to see his paintings (the same scene from \\"Seven Minutes to Midnight\\"), Lauren comforts Noah, briefly kissing him, before they awkwardly leave. Later, Noah meets with Claire, where they share a nice moment together before she leaves to go cheer with the other cheerleaders. Noah sees Lauren at her motel room, but explains he can't do this, saying he truly loves his family. Lauren understands, but Noah also explains he needs Lauren's help to deal with Sylar and Claire. Later, Noah receives a note from Lauren explaining she had her memory of their meetings wiped by the Haitian. Hiro successfully stops Sylar from killing Charlie by stopping time, and moves his body into the cargo space of a bus. However, after returning to the diner, Hiro realizes by having Charlie not die, he will never go back in time to save her in the first place, thus never falling in love with her. Hiro meets with his past self, convincing him that Charlie is dead and that he must go back in time to save her to preserve the space‚Äìtime continuum. He also orders Ando Masahashi to wait in the diner for his eventual return. Finally, Hiro meets with Charlie, and convinces her to come away with him. As they are about to leave, Charlie begins rambling off random facts, and Hiro realizes she must be dying from her aneurysm. Realizing Sylar could save her, Hiro rushes off to find him, though Sylar traps him with his telekinetic powers and demands to know who he is. Hiro thwarts Sylar's attempts to kill him by stopping time, and offers to tell him about his future in exchange for helping Charlie. Sylar grudgingly agrees, and successfully fixes the blood clot in Charlie's brain. Hiro explains to Sylar that he will gather many abilities, and that he will die alone after being stopped by Hiro and others like him. Hiro says he wishes to help him, but says Sylar must continue on his path, teleporting him out of the diner and into an alleyway. Sylar overhears the cheerleaders' chanting, foreshadowing his attempt to kill Claire. Later, Charlie chastises Hiro for saving her, saying he had done it for selfish reasons, and for not stopping Sylar. Hiro talks briefly with Noah in the diner, but is then surprised by Charlie's return. She thanks him for saving her life, and the two make up with a kiss. She leaves the diner with Hiro following, but when Hiro exits, he finds Charlie gone and Samuel standing outside. Samuel reveals he has taken Charlie, suggesting she is back at his carnival in the present time. Hiro angrily demands to know where she is and Samuel tells him he must retake control of his power and bring them back to the present if he ever wants to see her again. Grabbing Samuel, Hiro manages to teleport them to the Carnival in the present. Samuel shows him Arnold, who has finally died, after his last act of trapping Charlie somewhere in time. Samuel explains he is keeping Charlie as a way to get Hiro to do what he wants; Hiro asks what he must do, to which Samuel says he must correct the wrongs in his life, starting with one event eight weeks ago. In a flashback to that time, Samuel is shown apologizing over the motionless body of Mohinder Suresh. Cultural references Hiro uses the catchphrases of two other time-travellers: \\"Oh boy!\\" (Dr. Sam Beckett in Quantum Leap), and \\"Great Scott!\\" (Dr. Emmett Brown in Back to the Future). He also compares his relationship to Charlie with Crono and Marle from the video game Chrono Trigger. Reception \\"Once Upon a Time in Texas\\" was watched by 6.2 million viewers, the best figures for Season Four. This was attributed in part to the return to the series of Jayma Mays, now best known for her role as Emma Pillsbury on the Fox show Glee. Critics gave the episode mixed reviews, with many comparing the state of the series now rather unfavourably to how it was regarded in 2006, where this episode is set. Entertainment Weekly called it the \\"least bad episode of the season so far\\", welcoming the chance to see Sylar once again as the \\"grinning malevolent villain\\" of Season One, but criticising the Noah Bennett office romance subplot as unnecessary. The HD Room praised the writing of Samuel - \\"one of the show's more interesting characters\\" - and called it a \\"solid episode\\" that \\"should please fans of the show.\\" IGN called it \\"a decently told tale... of course, a little more action would have been nice.\\" The ending of the episode, which featured the first glimpse of Mohinder Suresh this season, attracted much comment, with more than one reviewer quipping that Samuel should not necessarily regard killing Mohinder as a mistake. EW said that a plot revolving around saving Mohinder's life would be \\"officially the worst idea Heroes has ever had.\\" Despite the mixed reception, the episode was tied with \\"Tabula Rasa\\" in first place on TV.com, both episodes sharing an 8.8 over 10. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club rated this episode a C-.

He is now based in San Clemente, California. Beginnings Addison began kayaking in South Africa in the mid 1970s. Introduced by his father to the sport, they would construct the fiberglass kayaks they needed to paddle the rivers in the basement of Rhodes University where his father Graeme Addison was a professor of Journalism. Throughout the 1970s and intom the early 1980s, their kayaking consisted of long multi day expeditions in the unknown, and it was here on these long expeditions that Addison forged his love for paddling adventure. The beginnings were simple however, as he and his friends did not know about basic skills such as the Eskimo Roll until he and his friends saw a paddler roll in a TV show called American Sportsman. They were astonished, replayed the segment of the tape, and with the aid of the 1981 world silver medalist kayaker Jerome Truran, taught themselves to roll.Ford, Kent, interview with Addison in Take the Wild Ride, video, c. 1993. In 1982, a small shipment of \\"plastic\\" kayaks entered the country (which was under international sanctions because of the Apartheid regime)and Graeme purchased two of the kayaks, the Perception Dancer for Corran and himself. Effectively indestructible, short and maneuverable, these boats completely changed the face of paddling for the young paddler who's skills sets increased at such a rapid rate that by 1987 he'd run the highest waterfall in the world; the 31m in Tignes, France. Competitions Addison competed internationally in whitewater slalom in the early 1990s. He finished 34th in the K-1 event at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona.1992 Summer Olympics official report Volume 5. , p. 150 In 1987, Addison successfully ran the highest waterfall ever attempted in a kayak: a 31m vertical drop into Lake Tignes in France. The unofficial record stood for over a decade until it was broken in 2004 by Ed Lucero's 34m waterfall in the Northwest Territories of Canada. In 1989, he famously ran 85-foot Looking Glass Falls in a Batman costume. The river was running low, so the landing was shallow, and Addison broke his back.David Ferrell, Los Angeles Times, Chasing a Dream and the River, February 21, 1998. Retrieved June 16, 2015. Addison competed for South Africa in a number of world freestyle kayaking championships, winning more events than any other competitor in the years 1993 to 1999, and earned a silver medal in 1995 and 1999,World Freestyle Kayaking Championships '99 New Zealand and bronze in 1998. He also produced a number of kayaking films between 2002 and 2007. Design career Addison has had a long career in kayak design. Early career As well as a competitor, he became known in the whitewater kayaking community as a designer by pioneering a number of innovative designs (including his first planing-hulled kayak in 1988, later independently reinvented by Canada's Necky Kayaks. Addison continued to work on the concept and brought it to the mass market in the early 1990s Jesse Metzger, Newton North High School CAPStone Research Program, The Evolution of Freestyle Kayaking, May 2014 that is the technology upon which most modern whitewater kayaks are based). Working for Perception Kayaks, Addison was responsible in part for the design of one of the world's best selling creek boats, the Corsica, in 1990.Bluegrass Whitewater Association, Corran Addison Kayaker, January/February 2004 He left Perception and started Savage Designs in 1994, leaving in 1996. In 1995, he designed the Fury, one of the world's first planing-hulled river kayaks. His marketing at Savage Designs laid the groundwork for the Generation X marketing that was to be followed by his next start-up company, Riot Kayaks, where he worked as chief designer and head of marketing.Playak.com, Q&A; with Corran Addison about his homecoming to Riot Riot Kayaks The Riot brand was notorious for cutting edge designs and a go-for-broke attitude to freestyle kayaking and extreme white water. One boat which he designed was the Glide, the kayak that is reputed to have been responsible for a last-minute rule change at the 1997 world championships because it was so far ahead in technology that he was considered to have an unfair advantage by the other athletes. He also designed the Disco in 1999, the design which all modern freestyle kayaks are measured against today. Addison was in his day considered somewhat controversial in the world of whitewater kayaking by his brash and cocksure attitude. However, the young kayakers of today mirror the young Addison in many ways and so it would seem he helped pave the way to a new generation of kayaking which subsists in today's pro paddlers. Imagine Media In 2002 Addison took his tinkering in the field of making sports action videos from an amateurish pastime to a professional level when he started Imagine Media. He produced the award- winning film, End Game, and numerous other films including \\"Legend of the Falls\\", \\"Air force 1\\", and \\"Mad Boys\\". He also worked on several Hollywood film projects as a stuntman or providing safety. Imagine Surfboards After leaving Riot in 2003, he began designing for Dragorossi, a new Kayak brand out of Italy. He was becoming more interested in surfing which had become his new passion, despite surfing his whole life starting in Durban South Africa where he lived through the 1980s. Addison owned and designed for his surf company called Imagine Eco, based out of Montreal. The name was changed to Imagine Eco, and was considered a cutting-edge company in the field of sustainable and ecological business, and has been leading the way in promoting responsible manufacturing in the surf industry.. He sold it to the investment firm \\"The Contrarian Group\\" in California in 2010 for $2 million. Imagine Surf (the name was changed again when it was subsequently sold to the Pryde Group, based out of Hong Kong). Corran is also a competitive Stand Up Paddle Surfer and competed in the 2010 Hawaiian World Cup, has won numerous distance and racing SUP competitions all of the world, and is a big wave surfer, having surfed such well knows spots as Wiamea, Makaha and Sunset. Corran SUP IN 2012 Corran started his lnext venture, Corran SUP, based out of Southern California. The brand pioneered paddleboards for use in whitewater, and focused on \\"made in the USA\\", producing almost everything in the United States. Corran built a reputation as a leading shaper of both surfing and racing paddleboard designs, with several of his designs getting rave reviews in the industry magazines. In January 2015 the brand was sold to Kayak Distribution.Martin Vilaboy, InsideOutdoor Magazine, Kayak Distribution Acquires Corran SUP, December 1, 2014. Retrieved June 16, 2015. He pioneered surfing the Habitat 67 wave in Montreal. His company Imagine Surfboards offers river surfing lessons, teaching over 3,500 students in Montreal since 2005. Imagine also manufactures and sells surfboards, suits and accessories. Soul Waterman In 2015 Corran started his latest company, SOUL WATERMAN. Based in Montreal Canada, where he started Riot in the 1990s, and the brand is designing a new line of highly innovative whitewater specific paddleboards and kayaks. Corran has arrived with his latest industry changing innovation, custom kayaks. He has developed a secret method of manufacturing one piece, one-off designed from the ground up for each paddlers needs. This is something which is completely unique to kayaking, and should prove to be a game changer. Other Sports Corran retired from competitive kayaking in 2002, and since then has gone on to compete in Paddleboarding and SUP Surfing. He has competed at a world class level, taking part in the surfing world Cup, and has competed and won SUP racing events internationally. Corran was one of the first people in the United States to be certified by the National Ski Patrol on a Snowboard. He was a sponsored snowboarder for many years, racing in the Mid Atlantic series for several years. Corran is also a licensed sportbike motorcycle racer, competing on sportbikes.

Following his forced emigration to England in 1938, he continued to paint in watercolour and oil. He pioneered the technique of Byzantine mosaic in the UK. Biography Mayer-Marton was born Gy≈ërg, or Georg in German, later changed to George on British naturalization, in Gy≈ër, Hungary in 1897, and grew up during the final years of Austro-Hungary. He served in the Austro-Hungarian Army during the First World War. From 1919 to 1924 he studied art at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna and Academy of Fine Arts, Munich and also visited Ravenna in Italy. He settled in Vienna, and in 1927 became Secretary, later Vice-President, of the leading progressive society of Viennese artists, the Hagenbund. In 1928 he provided illustrations in the Chinese style for \\"Der Kreidekreis\\" (\\"the Circle of Chalk\\") by Klabund and submitted paintings to the art competitions at the 1928 Summer Olympics, but did not win a medal. In 1938 following the Anschluss of Austria and the enactment of Hitler‚Äôs Nuremberg laws, Mayer-Marton and his wife fled to England. In 1940, during the London Blitz, his studio home in St John's Wood was burnt by an incendiary bomb. The majority of his life's work and personal possessions was destroyed. He was not in a position to paint in oil again until 1948. Mayer-Marton's parents had remained in Gyor and were eventually deported and killed. When, in 1945, Mayer-Marton learned of their deaths he painted the work Women with Boulders, showing two figures in a bleak rock- strewn landscape. Once in the UK Mayer-Marton worked for the predecessor of the Arts Council. In 1952, he took up the post of Senior Lecturer in the department of painting at the Liverpool College of Art and introduced the new subject of mural art. He created several Byzantine-style mosaics during his career in the UK. He executed a number of mosaic commissions from the Roman Catholic Church, decorating schools and churches in the North West of England. The Roman Catholic church of Holy Rosary in Fitton Hill, Oldham, opened in 1955, contains a significant mosaic. It is 8 m high and originally included frescos showing Mary and St John with a mosaic showing the crucifixion in the centre. The frescos were painted over with white emulsion paint in 1980. The church was closed in 2017 and remains unused in 2020. A mosaic by Mayer-Marton of the Pentecost was moved from the Church of the Holy Ghost, Netherton, when it was demolished in 1989 and installed in the Chapel of Unity in Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral. He completed over 200 oil paintings while in Liverpool. Several are held in private collections and also art galleries including: Glynn Vivian Art Gallery, Swansea; Victoria Gallery & Museum, and the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool; Derby Museum and Art Gallery; National Galleries of Scotland and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art. Mayer- Marton died from leukaemia in Liverpool in August 1960, leaving several of his mosaic designs unfinished.

(March 2003) \\"The Trust Imperative\\" is a marketing theory based on building consumer relationships through trustworthy dialogue and unbiased information. The concept was originated by Dr. Glen L. Urban, professor and former dean of the MIT Sloan School of Management. Trust- based marketing focuses on customer advocacy techniques that assist consumers in making informed purchase decisions based on comprehensive marketplace options and equitable advice. The theory contends that being honest and open is the best path to building consumer trust and creating a more loyal customer base. This is said to give customers increased consumer power through Internet access to product information and competitive pricing. Companies therefore can no longer rely on traditional models of \\"push marketing\\" in which a product‚Äôs positive attributes may mask unsuitable characteristics. For customers wanting to make an informed decision on a complex decision purchase, trust-based marketing is claimed to provide consumers with unbiased advice. The theory is that in competitive markets, companies need to approach their customers with respect and acknowledge that product and competitor information is easily accessible. Companies that provide consumers with comprehensive product options, including their competitor's, will earn the trust of the consumer even if it does not result in an immediate sale. When impartial and candid information is presented, a consumer's loyalty towards the company increases and greater lifetime profitability per customer will be achieved. Urban argues that \\"Trust-based companies have higher customer retention and more stable revenue streams. The prediction is that trust-based businesses will, in the end, have higher sales volumes and lower marketing costs than companies that survive on push-based marketing strategies.\\" MIT Faculty Spotlight According to authors Dan Kennedy and Matt Zagula, trust-based marketing is used by Ponzi schemers such as Bernie Madoff, who was successful despite the fact that ‚Äú[none] could explain exactly what Bernie did with their money or how he consistently generated above-par returns.‚Äù Urban originally tested his hypothesis with a prototype site for General Motors called TruckTown which provided unbiased comparisons of competing truck products. He found that more than 75% of TruckTown visitors said they trusted TruckTown more than the dealer who had sold them their last vehicle. Urban continued to test his theory with projects such as AutoChoiceAdvisor, a website to help car shoppers find the vehicle that best suits their needs) and a Medicare Insurance advisor called PlanPrescriber.

Family Thomas Kitson was the son of Robert Kitson (or Kytson)Burke's American Families with British Ancestry, The Landed Gentry, page 2960; accessed Sep 2017 of Warton, Lancashire. His mother's name was Margaret Smyth, daughter of Sir William Smyth and Lady Margaret Cornwall . His sister, Margaret Kitson, married John Washington, ancestor of George Washington. Washington family, Sulgrave Manor, Northamptonshire Retrieved 15 July 2013. Career Kitson came to London as a youth, and was apprenticed to the London mercer and Merchant Adventurer, Richard Glasyer. He was admitted a freeman of the Mercers' Company in 1507, and served as Warden in 1525-6 and 1533-4 and as Master in 1534‚Äì5. He served as Sheriff of London in 1533‚Äì4, and was knighted on 30 May of that year, an honour not conferred on his co- sheriff, William Forman. In May 1534 he was associated with Rowland Lee, Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, in taking oaths of fealty from priests and monks. Kitson had financial dealings with the Crown on a large scale. By 1509 his mercantile transactions were already extensive, and by 1534-5 only ten other merchants exported cloth in larger quantities. He was a member of the Company of Merchant Adventurers until his death, and traded at the cloth fairs or staples held by the company at Antwerp, Middelburg, and elsewhere in Flanders. Hengrave Hall, built by Sir Thomas Kitson Kitson had a house in London on Milk Street with a chapel, a garden on Coleman Street, and a house and chapel in Stoke Newington. Like other wealthy London merchants he had a house in Antwerp. He also purchased properties in the counties of Devon, Dorset and Somerset, and in 1521 acquired from Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham, for ¬£2340, the manors of Hengrave in Suffolk and Colston Bassett in Nottinghamshire. On the Duke's attainder and execution in the following year, Kitson was for a time deprived of the estates, but they were restored to him, confirmed by an Act of Parliament of 1524. He obtained a licence from Henry VIII to build an embattled manor house at Hengrave on a magnificent scale. The building was begun in 1525, and finished in 1538. A later inventory of the furniture and goods at Hengrave shows its extent and elegance. Kitson subsequently purchased several other manors in Suffolk from the crown. Besides Hengrave, he had houses at Westley and Risby in Suffolk. Kitson died 11 September 1540, and was buried in Hengrave Church. In the north-east angle of the chapel is an ornate monument to the memory of his widow, Margaret, Countess of Bath, and her three husbands..

The projectiles have mostly been dated to within a few hundred years of 900 AD, in the early era of the Owasco culture. The knives are thin, five-sided points with sharp tips. Jack's Reef Corner Notched and Jack's Reef Pentagonal are related and contemporary points, with The Corner Notched points rarer than the Pentagonal ones.

Design and development The earliest systematic naming scheme used by the Royal Aircraft Factory categorised by layout, e.g. B.E.2, with B for Bleriot type or tractor aircraft plus E for experimental. A few types, like the B.S.1 were briefly named under a layout plus role scheme (S for scout), but by the end of 1913 the B.S.1 had become the S.E.2 (Scout Experimental), the layout letter dropped. The initial sketches for what became known as the R.E.1 (Reconnaissance Experimental) were labelled B.S.2. In this context reconnaissance meant two-seaters, as opposed to the single-seat scouts. At that time reconnaissance or scouting was seen as the only military purpose of aircraft. The R.E.1, completed in July 1913, was described in contemporary reports as intended for the same purposes as the B.E.2, using the same engine but being an aircraft of more modern refinement. It was a single bay biplane with equal span, constant chord wings, unswept but with stagger. Wing warping was use for lateral control. The rudder was similar to that of the B.E.2, curved and extending below the fuselage, but a triangular fin was fitted that reached forward to the strongly swept leading edge of the B.E.2 style tailplane. The fuselage was flat sided with deep, rounded decking and slender overall to the rear. The cockpits were in tandem, the pilot's at the rear with sides cut to the bottom of the decking. He sat behind the trailing edge, with a cut-out in the upper wing to improve visibility. The observer's cockpit was between the wings and less deep. The air-cooled 70 hp (52 kW) Renault engine was uncowled and drove a four-bladed propeller. The single-axle undercarriage was attached to two longitudinal members which ran forward to serve as anti-nose-over skids, fixed to the fuselage by two pairs of robust struts. By September 1913 the only two R.E.1s built, serials 607 and 608, were with the Flying Department of the Royal Aircraft Factory. They were intended as experimental machines and were much modified. One desire was to make automatically stable aircraft, so they could be flown hands-off to give the pilot observation time. Within a month or so of completion, 607 had a wing extension of about 2 ft (610 mm) and 608 was probably built with the extension. In November 607 had four fins attached to the upper wing top surface, positioned above each pair of interplane struts and above each of the centre section struts; soon after 608 had them too, plus a reduction of stagger and a finless, enlarged rudder. In the quest for stability 607, now with ailerons replacing wing warping had a series of increases in dihedral, By March 1914 it could be flown hands off in \\"squally conditions\\". Later its stagger was also reduced and a rectangular tailplane fitted. In May 1914 the second R.E.1, no. 608 was transferred to the RFC and for a short while wore the number 362, though it went to war in August as 608. It may have gone with under-seat armour, albeit only 1/25th in (1 mm) thick, but it only survived for about a week. 607 stayed at Farnborough and was still at work in February 1915 doing photographic and wireless testing.

It alternated routes from Ludington, Michigan, to Milwaukee, Kewaunee, and Manitowoc, Wisconsin.  Commissioning and early history  The C&O; fully absorbed the Pere Marquette Railway in 1947, inheriting the car ferry service already established in Ludington. The division became known as the \\"Pere Marquette District\\" of the C&O; railroad. There were already several car ferries working out of Ludington at the time, including the Pere Marquette 21 and Pere Marquette 22, the City of Saginaw 31 and City of Flint 32, and the '. C&O; decided to improve its ferry fleet by adding two new ships. While similar in design to the immensely popular City of Midland 41, the new ships would have several notable design changes, such as a full-width pilot house that gave the crew an almost 360-degree view, and new lifeboat davits that freed up deck space. Hull 369, which would become the Spartan began construction in late 1950 by the Christy Corporation of Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin. She was launched on 4 January 1952 without fanfare; the ' was being built at the same time, and the owners preferred a double-christening ceremony. During construction, many cities on both sides of Lake Michigan lobbied for their names to go on the new ships, as was the tradition with previous Pere Marquette car ferries (i.e. City of Midland 41). C&O; decided that fewer feelings would be hurt if the twin ferries were named Spartan and Badger, after the mascots of Michigan State University (then Michigan State College) and the University of Wisconsin. The ships were christened on 6 September 1952 after the Badger was successfully launched. The Spartan completed her sea trials on 27 September 1952 and was delivered to C&O; on 23 October. She immediately began work for the C&O;, operating from her home port of Ludington.  Abandonment and the final years  In the mid-1970s, the C&O; railway decided that the car ferries were no longer profitable to operate and petitioned the Interstate Commerce Commission to allow them to abandon the ferry routes. There were only three ferries left in service by this point: the City of Midland 41 (built in 1940), the Badger, and the Spartan. In 1978, C&O; was granted permission to systematically eliminate its ferry routes. There was no longer a need for three ferries, and in September 1979 the Spartan was laid up in Ludington. In spring 1980 she was steamed up again to run as part of a lease agreement with the Ann Arbor Railroad, then operated by the Michigan Interstate Railway, out of Frankfort, Michigan, but was abandoned after it was discovered Frankfort harbor was too shallow for the Spartan. The ship was tied up at Ludington's number 3 slip for many years. She has since been moved to number 2 slip.  Today  The SS Spartan (right) laid up in number 2 slip and her sistership, the SS Badger docked at number 2 slip in Ludington, Michigan The SS Spartan today sits at Ludington's 2 slip, one of the last of the true railroad-car ferries remaining. Due to the rarity of her coal-burning Skinner Unaflow steam engines that she and the Badger share, the Spartan has been used frequently as a parts ship to keep her twin running. In the early 2000s, when a new passenger ferry service was proposed from Muskegon, Michigan to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Lake Michigan Carferry (the owners of the Badger and Spartan since 1992) proposed a diesel-converted Spartan as the ship of choice for the run.

The larger portion of the park, , is on the west bank. Clock tower in the park Merkez Park starts just north of Sabancƒ± Mosque and extends north to Galleria Shopping Mall. On the west of the park there is Fuzuli Street. On the east bank, the park starts north of the Sheraton Hotel (under construction) and extends north to the Acqualand Entertainment Center. On the east, the park is bordered with Hacƒ± Sabancƒ± Boulevard. Sinanpa≈üa and Yavuzlar footbridges connect both sections of the park. History A large portion of the area of the west bank of today's Merkez Park was a citrus garden. South of the garden, there was a neighborhood of shanty homes. At the very south, just north of D-400 State road, there was the Central Bus Terminal on the river side, and the Archaeology Museum (which is still there) and a gas station on the street side. North of the garden up to the old dam, was a reserve land for floods which used to happen frequently until the 1950s. On the east bank, there was a neighborhood of shanty homes and a large area of vacant land. Children's playground The idea to create a large urban park on the banks of the Seyhan River was first included in the city plan in 1988 by the mayor, Ayta√ß Durak. Named Merkez Park, it was planned to be built in an area from north of D-400 State road to the old dam. The project was presented to the public at the art gallery of the Municipal Hall. The first step to take was to relocate the Central Bus Terminal which was just north of D-400 State road. The Central Bus Terminal was moved to the west end of the city. Cycling path At the 1989 local elections, Selahattin √áolak was elected mayor, and he reversed the project. Although river banks are zoned as construction-free areas by laws, a large shopping mall was approved for the area just south of the Demirk√∂pr√º bridge. On the area north of Demirk√∂pr√º, Selahattin √áolak built a large amphitheater, named Mimar Sinan Amphitheater. Footbridge over the Seyhan River, connecting the both sections of the park At the 1994 local elections, Ayta√ß Durak was elected mayor for a second term. He had to modify the original plan of Merkez Park due to the constructions in the project area. The modified project resumed by re-zoning the neighborhood within the project area. There were around 100 homes in the area and demolition of the homes started in 1998. During this period, the Sinanpa≈üa footbridge was built to connect both banks of the Seyhan River. Sabancƒ± Mosque, at the corner of Seyhan bridge, was completed in 1998. Before the construction of Merkez Park, a citywide recreational pathway was completed on both banks of the Seyhan River. Park construction started by building the major pathway of the park from Galleria to Sabancƒ± Mosque. Citrus trees were completely removed and converted into multi-functional green areas. The gas station next to the Archaeology Museum was moved to another location and the park was extended towards Sabancƒ± Mosque. An underground car park was built at the area between Sabancƒ± Mosque and the museum. The ground was set as green area. The construction of the west bank of the park was fully completed in 2008. Landscaping Activity ground Merkez Park is well landscaped and carries a wide variety of trees and plants in an open concept. There are 67 species of trees and bushes, 40 species of cactuses, aromatic and ground covering plants. The number of total plants exceed 400 thousand. Some of the plants that were brought from Italy are shaped as animal figures. Within the park there are 12 ponds and a playground for children including the disabled. At the section for the youth there is a skating court, ground chess and mini amphitheater. Viewing terraces are built on a higher level and there are also circular shaped resting terraces. There are also running and cycling paths between the park and Fuzuli Street. A 2100-seat amphitheater at the north of the park hosts concerts and movie theatres. Next to the amphitheater, there is a quay for river boats. A rowing club located inside Merkez Park provides rowing at the river.

It was original built in 1878 and rebuilt in 1899. It is situated about south of Minnesota State Highway 19 at 8501 Garfield Avenue S, southeast of Lonsdale, Minnesota. History According to the congregation minutes, on May 15, 1876, Norwegian immigrants established the Throndhjem's (sic) Church. The name was inspired by the historic city of Trondheim and the province of Trondelag. The original church was erected on the same site during 1878. The chancel in the current building dates to that original church. Trondhjem is an architectural mix of Greek Revival and Gothic Revival styles, which also incorporates elements of the stave churches of Norway. The original church built in 1878 used a cruciform architectural plan. All but the chancel was taken down in 1899 to allow a larger building to be erected on site, with the original chancel incorporated into the new building and many elements in this building showing signs of prior use most likely re-used from the prior structure.Trondhjem Norwegian Lutheran Church (Minnesota Historical Society) Present status In 1988 the Trondhjem Lutheran Congregation moved out of this historic building into a new church located a half mile away. The old church building has been restored by the Trondhjem Community Preservation Society, Inc. Annually the society hosts a winter concert, an ice cream social in July and the Syttende Mai celebration, all part of fundraising efforts.Old Trondhjem Church (Trondhjem Community Preservation Society, Inc.) The restoration project of the old church building was completed during 2002. The interior of the 1899 church had originally been decorated with hand painted and stenciled Casein paint on a decorative motif. The original murals were uncovered under layers of embossed tin, paint and wallpaper. The murals were restored in the restoration and where necessary were replicated in areas where the original art work was missing.Old Trondhjem Norwegian Lutheran Church (Renaissance Art, Restoration & Architecture) In 2001 Trondhjem Norwegian Lutheran Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places by the United States Department of Interior, United States Park Service, because of its historical significance.

The school teaches grades 8 to grade 12. The school's motto is \\"Laetus Laborum\\" which means \\"Let Cheerfulness abide with Industry\\". History=Early years F R Miller, in her Masters Thesis - The History of a Johannesburg Primary School 1902 - 1937 - writes as follows regarding the establishment of the school: During the course of 1902, 102 pupils (57 boys and 45 girls) were enrolled at the school and accommodated in a marquee. The first headmaster, G Newby, noted that he had to send home pupils in sub-standards and Standard II and III because the marquee was swamped by rain. Between 1903 and 1904, a more suitable school building was constructed by the Transvaal Education Department. It was designed to accommodate 250 children, was a zinc and wood building, and was erected at a cost of 2071.10 pounds. There were 200 children on the roll, and classes ranged from Sub A and Sub B to Standard Seven. School hours were then from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. In 1908, the Turffontein Evening Government School, at which elementary subjects were taught, was opened and a Senior Cadet Corps was started. By 1909 the situation at Turffontein might be described as \\"critical\\" with over five hundred children occupying a building originally constructed for two hundred and fifty, and on the 1909 - 1910 estimates of the TED, provision was made to construct a new school building for six hundred pupils, which would be adequate for the current enrolment. In August 1909, the school had to be closed for three days because of a snow storm. By December 1909, the numbers had increased to 490 and a lack of accommodation was felt. The estimated cost of the building was 11,075 pounds and its completion was waited with considerable anticipation. After several years of makeshift and inadequate accommodation, the new brick and wood building was complete on 11 October 1910, later that month, the school was closed for three weeks because of an outbreak of measles. There is also a flagpole which was donated by Robinson Deep Goldmine in 1915 and remains in excellent condition. There have been alterations, additions and renovations to the building over the years but it remains essentially the same structure occupied by Turffontein Central, Intermediate and Sir John Adamson School until relocation to Winchester Hills in 1959. The classrooms, situated on the east, west and north wings, were large and cold, and featured sash windows. The pupils sat in American dual desks and had two holes for the china inkwells. Each desk had a shelf underneath it on which pupils placed books and writing materials. Over the next few years enrolment continued to increase and by December 1915, nearly 1,000 pupils attended the school, making it one of the largest in Johannesburg. =Controversies= There are numerous complaints in the school records of the frequent absence of teachers. The school was overcrowded, having 880 on the roll. In 1914, school hours were from 8.30 a.m. to noon, and then from 1.30 p.m. to 3.30 p.m. From 1915, it seems that the school catered for classes to Standard Six only. Snow fell again in July 1915, and once again classes were cancelled,. About 1000 children attended the school in 1916. In some classes there were over 50 pupils, and accommodation difficulties were acute. On 30 April 1918, the school was closed because of Mr Newby's death, and Miss Lawrie took charge until 8 December 1918, when Mr John Butler took up duties as principal. 1920s and 1930s The House system - still in use at the school - was introduced in 1922. The four houses with their distinctive colours - Selborne (Red), Buxton (Green), Gladstone (Yellow) and Connaught (Blue), were named after a High Commissioner for South Africa, and the first three Governor-Generals of the Union of South Africa. In order to meet the costs of the multiplicity of activities, a composite fee of 1s. per child per term was introduced. In 1928, the name of the school was changed to the Turffontein Intermediate Government School. By 1931, the school budget was two hundred and twenty pounds and everybody paid a \\"modest subscription of six shillings per year\\". The largest expense noted by Butler in his report was 68 pounds, two shillings and three pence, spent on library books, extending the junior library and purchasing school prizes. One year later, it became a primary school and was renamed the Sir John Adamson School in honour of a former Director of Education for the Transvaal. In 1935, after many years of planning and negotiating with the Education Department, a new library and restroom were opened at the school. The library was officially open on 19 October 1935 at a special assembly. Mr E J Butler handed the buildings over to Mr S P Bekker, the Administrator of the Transvaal and Mr G A C Kuschke, the Director of Transvaal Education, declared the building open. Another change of name took place in 1937, and the school became better known as the Sir John Adamson Junior High School. Pupils who were enrolled in Standards II, III and IV at the time had to leave to attend other schools in 1938. In the case of the Standard IV group, this was particularly inconvenient as they returned to the school in their Standard VI year. In addition, the reorganisation meant that certain staff members - some of whom had had a lengthy association with the school - had to depart. In 1940, Ernest \\"Johnny\\" Butler, retired from the Transvaal Education Department. He had spent 22 years as school principal. 1940s and 1950s By 1940, the annual school subscription had risen to 1 pound. A large portion of the budget went to the school magazine which was given free to every pupil. Education was disrupted during the years of World War II when many staff members - both male and female - were involved in active service. In 1940, there were no less than eight staff members on Active Service: Pte. J R Evans, L/Cpl. J R Dick, P/N. N Valentine, 2nd Lieut. J Teare, 2ns Lieut. H R Corbett, 2nd Lieut. H Rogan and H P Tobiansky. Mr H Cartwright Robinson who was appointed Principal after the retirement of Mr Butler, spent only six months at the helm of the school before he volunteered for active service. In his absence, Mr H Holmes served as acting principal. New buildings replaced the old wood and iron structures in 1945. These were officially opened by the Director of Education, Mr H H G Kreft, on 22 November. The pupils assembled for the ceremony in the playground. In the presence of members of the Witwatersrand Central School Board, Inspectors, local principals and parents, Mr Kreft opened the buildings with the gold key presented to him by Mr Spicer, the architect. From the beginning of 1951, the school was known as Sir John Adamson High School. A governing body was instituted in 1952, with Mr H Schwarz as chairman. In the same year, the governing body instituted the first governing body prizes for bilingualism. It soon became apparent that the existing school grounds were far too small to accommodate a fully fledged high school. In 1953, Mr Whiteford expressed a need for at least twenty acres of land. Plans of the new school, to accommodate 750 pupils, were drawn and approved in 1955. The first matriculation exam was written at the school in this year. The new building for the Sir John Adamson High School was removed from the provincial priority list and put on a list of schools to be built at a later date when sufficient finance was available. However, through the persistent efforts of those who had the interests of the school at heart, building started towards the end of the following year. The land on which the present school buildings are housed was secured by the first governing body of the school, and in particular, councillor Harry Schwarz, chairperson of the governing body. As a tribute to councillor Schwarz, the school hall - which is still in use today - was named after him. In 1957 the school's new badge was registered with the government and came into general use in 1958. The Foundation Stone of the new building was laid on 7 June 1958, by Dr A H du Preez van Wyk, the then Director of Education. It was on this occasion too that the school song, composed by Miss Weiss with words by Mr J H Whiteford, was heard for the first time. The black marble foundation stone which was originally located outside of the school's main foyer was preserved during alterations to the administrative block in the 1990s and can still be seen - in its original position - inside the new foyer. In July 1959, moving operations began. The School Board provided a 5-ton truck and, on this, over 400 desks, tables, chairs, library books, Science, Industrial Arts, and Home Economics equipment, office furniture, piano and pictures had to be transported more than two miles. The new school was officially opened on 31 October 1959, by the Administrator of the Transvaal, the Honourable Dr William Nicol. A new era in the history of the Sir John Adamson High School had begun. With the move to the new building came many innovations. The school cadet detachment changed into a naval unit, and the distinctive prefects' blazers were introduced. For the first eighteen months, sporting activities were limited as the sports fields had not yet been completed, interschool sports had to be played at other schools. 1960s and 1970s By the end of 1961, many of the additional facilities and amenities essential to the running of a high school had been completed: the playing fields, tennis courts and hall. 1962 saw the holding of the first sports meeting at the new school and the swimming bath was completed in 1963. In 1964, a new science laboratory and art room were added to the existing building. During the third term of 1965, a Sir John Sports Committee was established. This committee was set up to control not only sporting activities at the school, but all extramural activities. Owing to the efforts of the committee, colour scrolls for Academic achievement (Pro Meritore), Debating (Ars Oratoris) and Drama (Pro Arte) were awarded from 1966, in addition to the scrolls for achievement in sport. Also, pupils with three colour-awards and/or Provincial colours are recommended for honours blazers. Special honours ties were introduced, and the first of these were presented to Mr D J Rees in August 1967. All prefects, and pupils with honours blazers, are entitled to wear these ties. In 1973, a five-year plan focussing on the provision of future facilities was announced. By 1974, there was a pre-cast concrete fence in front of the school, the school owned four buses, a basketball court and a six-bay garage for the school buses had been constructed. In 1975 and 1976, the main improvements included the grassing of the hockey field, the completion of concrete netball fields, precast fencing around the swimming pool, swimming change rooms, the first stages of a concrete pavilion and a languages room. The completion of the pavilion was planned for 1977 when the school would celebrate its 75th anniversary but was completed a year in advance. In 1981 two new laboratories and two new centres were opened and taken into use. 1980s and 1990s The 1980s were a very difficult period in terms of staffing. Mr Hankey, who assumed duty as principal in 1981 remarked that the school's \\"greatest liability was a shortage of teachers\\" and identified this as the \\"biggest problem that our schools are facing today\\". In 1991, a long-awaited political change swept through the country, the school opted to become a \\"Model B\\" school. Thus, in 1992, Sir John opened its doors to pupils of all races for the first time in its history. During the course of 1992, the Government changed the status of the school to that of \\"Model C\\". The entire principle of \\"free\\" education changed and, with the exception of staff salaries, the parents became responsible for the financial needs of the school. After many years of planning, a computer room eventually became a reality. Initially, there were 15 pupil workstations installed and pupils were given the opportunity to use the centre during school time. Unfortunately, the school was unable to keep up with the rapid changes in technology and the centre was soon outdated. It was only in 2001 that a new state-of-the-art computer room was opened. Computing was introduced as an examination subject at Grade 10 level and Junior pupils were given the opportunity to make use of the centre under the guidance of Future Kids. In March 1996, all four Education Departments in Gauteng - products of the Apartheid Government - merged to form the Gauteng Department of Education. A new SA Schools Bill completely changed education in South Africa. As a result of government rationalisation that accompanied the dramatic changes occurring in educational years, many staff members opted for early retirement or voluntary severance packages. The sweeping changes included a teacher-pupil ratio of 35:1. In order to maintain the standards of education that had characterised the long history of our school, it was decided to appoint additional staff on the Governing Body's payroll. In 1998, under the guidance of the current principal - R J de Beer - extensive alterations were completed on the administrative block which completely changed the physical face of the school. 2000 to present In 2001, the school re-organisation fell in line with the introduction of Outcomes Based Education with its eight Learning Areas: Language, Literacy and Communication; Mathematical Literacy, Mathematics and Mathematical Studies; Natural Sciences; Human and Social Sciences, Economic and Management Sciences; Technology, Life Orientation and Arts and Culture. The emphasis within the classroom shifted to the attainment of expected outcomes and continuous assessment. In 2004, the long-awaited utility hall was built and opened on 31 August 2004, by Mr Plessis, Chairman of the Governing Body. Ms de Beer, left the school at the end of 2004.

As the United States office for the Association Montessori Internationale, the Association Montessori International/USA oversees recognition of eligible Montessori schools, assists in recruitment and organization of Montessori teacher training, and organizes professional development opportunities in the United States. The organization also maintains a member database of about 17,000 teachers, school administrators, parents, and interested individuals.  History  The Association Montessori Internationale is the oldest Montessori organization in the world.Schmidt, Danna (2009) Understanding Montessori: A Guide for Parents. Random House. p. 255. Maria Montessori established AMI in 1929, with the headquarters in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The international head office of AMI is still located in Amsterdam.Lillard, Paula Polk (1972). Montessori A Modern Approach. Schocken Books Inc. p. 15. The organization was founded to maintain the integrity of her life's work and to ensure that it would be perpetuated after her death: \\"The AMI was to function not only as organizer of courses and overseer of teacher training, not only as a way of keeping the various worldwide Montessori schools and societies in touch with each other and disseminating information about the movement's ideas and activities, but also as a firm, controlling rights to the publication of Montessori's books and the manufacture and sale of the materials as well as recipient of training-course fees.\\"Kramer, Rita (1988) Maria Montessori: A Biography. Perseus Books. p. 311. Mario Montessori, Maria‚Äôs son and personal assistant, was given the task of safeguarding the Montessori movement after Maria Montessori's death. \\"At [Montessori's] death she appointed Mr. Montessori as her successor in the task of directing and coordinating the work of the Association Montessori Internationale... A responsibility laid upon Mr. Montessori's shoulders was the delicate task of safeguarding the integrity of the Montessori movement, in the many countries where it is active, by recognizing under the aegis of the Association Montessori Internationale only such \\"Montessori\\" schools and training courses as faithfully interpret, both in spirit and practice, the Montessori principles.\\"Standing, E.M. (1998) Maria Montessori: Her Life and Work. Plume. p. 72. Mario Montessori sent Margaret Elizabeth Stephenson to the United States in 1961. A trainee of Maria Montessori herself Stephenson first operated as Mario Montesori's personal representative in the United States. As the movement grew, Montessori granted her request to set up a branch office of AMI in the United States. AMI/USA was founded in 1972 and directed for its first ten years by Karin Salzmann. In 1988, Virginia McHugh succeeded Jon Osterkorn as Executive Director of AMI/USA. Today there are over 200 AMI schools across the United States. The AMI recognition program was initiated in the United States to assist families in assessing whether schools are following Dr. Montessori‚Äôs principles and practices in their original integrity and completeness. The AMI standards maintain the level of excellence that Montessori envisioned and were developed by the AMI Scientific Pedagogy Group for this purpose. These standards ensure that children are provided the opportunity for full intellectual, social, and psychological growth and that the approach is consistent with what is presented in AMI training courses worldwide. It is upon these standards that AMI recognition status is granted by level within the school, each year. During the past twenty years the amount of scientific research confirming the Montessori method has increased: \\"Maria Montessori, through observation of children, developed materials that engage both the hands and the mind of the child. Science and research, especially in the past twenty years, have come to prove that Montessori's observations accurately describe the learning needs of children and have shown as well that the principles Dr. Montessori envisioned do create joyful learners.\\"Schmidt, Danna (2009) Understanding Montessori: A Guide for Parents. Random House. p. 85.  Mission  The mission of the Association Montessori International of the United States (AMI/USA), as stated on the organization's website, is to bring the principles of Dr. Maria Montessori to the education of children, to help them attain their full potential in our society. AMI/USA collaborates with affiliates such as the Elementary Alumni Association (EAA) and the North American Montessori Teachers' Association (NAMTA).  Programs  School Recognition Program A certificate of recognition is granted to a subset of Montessori schools who prove that they meet a set of specific Montessori standards as derived from Maria Montessori‚Äôs original research and methodology. Programs must apply annually for one of the following levels: recognized, affiliated, or associated. Professional Development AMI/USA facilitates conferences each year. The annual refresher course and workshops cater to all AMI trained professionals, as well as classroom assistants, administrators, and, beginning in 2009, parents. Additionally, in fall and spring, AMI/USA sponsors a regional conferences. Membership AMI/USA facilitates membership benefits to AMI members living in the United States. Membership to AMI through AMI/USA is offered on an individual basis; schools and institutions are not eligible for AMI membership. Membership benefits include a yearly subscription to AMI and AMI/USA publications, including the quarterly AMI/USA newsletter AMI/USA News and the bi-annual AMI scholarly journal Communications. Members also receive a preferred rate on AMI/USA publications, and receive a discount from AMI approved Montessori materials distributors. Teacher Training Program AMI/USA works in partnership with AMI Montessori training centers to help ensure the caliber of AMI teacher training is maintained in the United States. \\"The standards of Montessori practice were originally delineated by the Association Montessori International (AMI) in 1929. They represent an integrated body of materials, methodology, psychology, and philosophy that provides Montessori teachers with a common reference point.\\"Loeffler, Margaret Howard (1992). Montessori in Contemporary American Culture. Heinemann Educational Books. p. 195. We Are Montessori AMI/USA also coordinates the \\"We Are Montessori\\" project, which has the objective of \\"celebrating Montessori alumni and bringing awareness to the benefits of Montessori education.\\" The initiative collects information to showcase alumni they consider as successful, and the schools that fostered their education. To date, AMI/USA it is the only organization systematically collecting information on Montessori alumni in the United States.

The flight was operated by a Tu-104A aircraft. On 30 June 1962, with 76 passengers (including 14 children) and 8 crew members aboard, the flight departed Irkutsk on schedule, and made a timely report 50 kilometers from Krasnoyarsk. A few minutes later, an agitated voice later identified as that of the co-pilot made an incoherent emergency transmission with a background of an unusual noise. Repeated subsequent attempts to contact the flight failed. The aircraft's wreckage was found 28 km east of Krasnoyarsk Airport, in flat terrain with small areas of forest. Investigators subsequently determined that the plane had impacted the ground upside-down at an angle of 40¬∞. There were no survivors. Cause of disaster The official cause of the disaster was reported to be a stall and loss of spatial orientation in cloud. A second theory was a loss of control due to a fire in the passenger cabin. However, damage found on the port side of the fuselage (specifically, an entry hole with signs of fire damage on the inside) was consistent with damage from an anti-aircraft missile, and there was unofficial confirmation that such a missile had gone astray during an air defense exercise in the area. Unofficial sources indicated that a fragment of the fuselage was found with a 20 cm hole and fire damage, indicating a high-speed impact. At the time of the crash, a unit at nearby Magansk had fired anti-aircraft missiles as part of an exercise. The responsible missile had allegedly lost its intended target in a storm front before hitting the Tu-104.

Five referendums have been held on the topic, most recently in 2017. The population of Puerto Rico in 2015 was over three million people and larger than that of 21 states. In November 2012, a referendum, the fourth as of that date, was held. Fifty-four percent (54.0%) voted \\"No\\" to maintaining the current political status. As their preferred alternative to remaining a commonwealth, 61.11% chose statehood, 33.34% chose free association, and 5.55% chose independence. On December 11, 2012, the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico enacted a concurrent resolution requesting the President and the Congress of the United States to respond diligently and effectively on the demand of the people of Puerto Rico to end its current political status and to begin the transition of Puerto Rico to become a state of the union. In 2014, resolutions were introduced in both houses of the United States Congress (H.R. 2000; S. 2020) to hold a yes-or-no referendum among the residents of Puerto Rico on statehood. If a \\"yes\\" majority prevailed, the President would have been required to submit legislation to Congress enacting Puerto Rican statehood. Both resolutions died in committee. A fifth referendum was held on June 11, 2017. Turnout was 23%, a historical failure in a territory where voting turnout usually hovers around 80%. A boycott of the vote was led by the citizenry at large, citing discontent over never-ending non-binding referendums, and protesting Ricardo Rossell√≥'s pro- statehood administration's choice to spend public funds in subsidizing this vote when the island was in the midst of a devastating fiscal crisis and battered by the imposed austerity measures of a non-elected fiscal control board regarded as the height of colonial imposition . Some would later try to attribute the boycott to the PPD party, citing its support for the status quo. The numbers, however, do not support the notion that the boycott was divided along party lines. Of the minimal number of voters who participated, 97.18% chose statehood, 1.50% favored independence and 1.32% chose to maintain the commonwealth status. In June 2018, Rep. Jenniffer Gonz√°lez filed a bill that would pave the way for Puerto Rico to become a state in 2021; the bill was not acted upon after introduction. Background Following the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Puerto Rico was ceded to the United States in 1898, through the signing of the Treaty of Paris. Puerto Rico became an unincorporated, organized territory of the US with Commonwealth status through a series of judicial decisions by the Supreme Court of the United States, collectively known as \\"The Insular Cases\\" and the enactment of several statutes by Congress. In 1900, the U.S. Congress enacted the Foraker Act, establishing a civil government in the territory and then in 1917, Puerto Ricans were granted US citizenship, by the enactment of the Jones-Shafroth Act. The Office of the President is responsible for policy relations between the United States and Puerto Rico, although according to the Territorial Clause of Constitution of the United States of America \\"The Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States...\\".  Potential benefits of statehood  Puerto Rico is, by a considerable margin, the largest U.S. territory in terms of both population and geographical area, being similar to Connecticut with respect to population size and geographical area. Puerto Rican residents do not participate in the Presidential elections because Puerto Rico does not have any electoral votes, but individual Puerto Ricans do have the right to vote when resident in a U.S. state. Statehood would allow the population to vote in all elections as the residents of states already can. In early 2017, the Puerto Rican government-debt crisis posed serious problems for the government which was outstanding bond debt that had climbed to $70 billion or $12,000 per capita at a time with 12.4% unemployment. Statehood might be useful as a means of dealing with the financial crisis, since it would allow for bankruptcy and the relevant protection. Congress has the power to vote to allow Chapter 9 protection without the need for statehood, but in late 2015 there was very little support in the House for this concept. Other benefits to statehood include increased disability benefits and Medicaid funding as well as the higher (federal) minimum wage. Potential drawbacks of statehood Currently, residents of Puerto Rico only have to pay federal income taxes on work performed in the US and District of Columbia, and not at home, unless working for the U.S. Government. This benefit could go away if Puerto Rico becomes a state. U.S. corporations that currently operate there as controlled foreign corporations may relocate if Puerto Rico became a state and federal corporate taxes applied. History Since the transfer of sovereignty of Puerto Rico from Spain to the United States, the relationship between Puerto Rico and the US has been evolving. On April 11, 1899, the peace treaty between Spain and the USA (the 1898 Treaty of Paris) became effective, and established a military government in Puerto Rico. This was short lived, since the following year (April 2, 1900) Congress enacted the Foraker Act, which established a civil government and free trade between Puerto Rico and the USA. Puerto Ricans, although incapable of electing members of the territory's executive branch, but were now able to elect their local representatives and a resident commissioner to the US Congress, who had voice but no vote. In 1917, the enactment of the Jones-Shafroth Act the territory of Puerto Rico was organized and statutory US citizenship was granted to its residents. Since 1967, there have been several referendums, which included questions on statehood. Puerto Ricans chose not to alter the status quo in referendums until 2012. The 2012 referendum produced a more equivocal result. 1967 referendum A referendum on the status of the island was held in Puerto Rico on 23 July 1967.Nohlen, D (2005) Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I, p552 Voters were given the choice between being a Commonwealth, statehood or independence. The majority of voters voted for Commonwealth status, with a voter turnout of 65.9%.Nohlen, p555 1998 referendum A referendum in December 1998 offered voters four political status options: statehood, independence, free association, and territorial commonwealth, plus \\"none of the above.\\" The latter option won 50.5% of the vote, followed by statehood, with 46.6%. Turnout was 71%. 2012 statehood vote On November 6, 2012, eligible voters in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico were presented with two questions: (1) whether they agreed to continue with Puerto Rico's territorial status and (2) to indicate the political status they preferred from three possibilities: statehood, independence, or a sovereign nation in free association with the United States. A full 970,910 (54.0%) voted \\"No\\" on the first question, expressing themselves against maintaining the current political status, and 828,077 (46.0%) voted \\"Yes\\", to maintain the current political status. Of those who answered on the second question 834,191 (61.2%) chose statehood, 454,768 (33.3%) chose free association, and 74,895 (5.5%) chose independence. The preferred status consultation did not include Puerto Rico's current status as a territory (Estado Libre Asociado as defined by the 1952 Constitution) as a choice, but instead an alternative named \\"E.L.A. Soberano\\" President Barack Obama pledged to respect the voters' decision. In December 2012, the newspaper Caribbean Business allegedly obtained, from a White House source, a statement claiming that Obama urged Congress to act upon the referendum's results. On August 1, 2013, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee held a hearing on Puerto Rico's status as a direct result of the 2012 referendum vote and invited Governor Alejandro Garc√≠a Padilla, Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi, and pro-independence supporter Rub√©n Berr√≠os to give testimony and answer questions from the committee. June 2017 referendum Because there were almost 500,000 blank ballots in the 2012 referendum, creating confusion as to the voters' true desire, Congress decided to ignore the results. The 2014 budget bill included $2.5 million in funding for a future referendum; there was no deadline attached to the funds. The fifth referendum, entitled \\"Plebiscite for the immediate decolonization of Puerto Rico\\" was held on June 11, 2017 and offered three options: \\"Statehood\\", \\"Free Association/Independence\\" and \\"Current Territorial Status\\", and the U.S. Justice Department required Puerto Rico to add the territorial status as an option as a requirement to release the $2.5 million funds set aside by the Obama administration to help educate the population on any future plebiscite, however the vote was held before the ballot could be reviewed, so the funds were not released. Newly elected Governor Ricardo Rossell√≥ is strongly in favor of statehood for Puerto Rico to help develop the economy and help to \\"solve our 500-year-old colonial dilemma... Colonialism is not an option... It‚Äôs a civil rights issue ... 3.5 million citizens seeking an absolute democracy,\\" he told the news media. Benefits of statehood include an additional $10 billion per year in federal funds, the right to vote in presidential elections, higher Social Security and Medicare benefits, and a right for its government agencies and municipalities to file for bankruptcy. The latter is currently prohibited. At approximately the same time as the referendum, Puerto Rico's legislators are also expected to vote on a bill that would allow the Governor to draft a state constitution and hold elections to choose senators and representatives to the U.S. Congress. Regardless of the outcome of the referendum or the bill on drafting a constitution, action by the United States Congress would be required to implement changes to the status of Puerto Rico under the Territorial Clause of the United States Constitution. If the majority of Puerto Ricans were to choose Free Associated State option‚Äîonly 18% voted for it in 2012‚Äîand if it were granted by the U.S. Congress, Puerto Rico would become a Free Associated State‚Äîa virtually independent nation. It would have a political and economical treaty of association with the U.S. that would stipulate all delegated agreements. This could give Puerto Rico a similar status to Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau, countries which currently have a Compact of Free Association (agreement) with the United States. The agreement between the U.S. and Puerto Rico might cover topics such as the role of the U.S. military in Puerto Rico, the use of the US currency, free trade between the two entities, and whether Puerto Ricans would be U.S. citizens. The three current Free Associated States use the American dollar, receive some financial support and the promise of military defense if they refuse military access to any other country. Their citizens are allowed to work in the U.S. and serve in its military. United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization Since 1953, the UN has been considering the Political status of Puerto Rico and how to assist it in achieving \\"independence\\" or \\"decolonization\\". In 1978, the Special Committee determined that a \\"colonial relationship\\" existed between the US and Puerto Rico. The UN's Special Committee has often referred to Puerto Rico as a nation in its reports, because, internationally, the people of Puerto Rico are often considered to be a Caribbean nation with their own national identity. Most recently, in a June 2016 report, the Special Committee called for the United States to expedite the process to allow self-determination in Puerto Rico. More specifically, the group called on the United States to expedite a process that would allow the people of Puerto Rico to exercise fully their right to self-determination and independence. ... [and] allow the Puerto Rican people to take decisions in a sovereign manner, and to address their urgent economic and social needs, including unemployment, marginalization, insolvency and poverty\\". Puerto Rico Statehood Admission Act of 2019 A bill (H.R. 4901) for Puerto Ricans to vote \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" on statehood was introduced on October 29, 2019 by Puerto Rico Resident Commissioner Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon. The bill was referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources on the same day and is still awaiting review by the committee. If it passes, the vote would be scheduled for November 3, 2020. A corresponding bill in the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico that would implement the vote, known in English as the Law for the Final Definition of the Political Status of Puerto Rico (P.S. 1467), was approved by both houses on March 31, 2020, and sent to the Governor for signature. The single question is, \\"Should Puerto Rico be immediately admitted into the Union as a state?\\", with only two options: \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\".Puerto Rico: Governor V√°zquez informs that funds should be sought for the plebiscite for statehood Nodal, 4 Mar 2020 2020 referendum On May 16, 2020, Governor Wanda V√°zquez Garced announced that a referendum on Puerto Rico's statehood will be held in November. For the first time in the territory's history, only one direct question will be asked, as opposed to presenting multiple options such as independence and other forms of status or maintaining the current territorial status. The announcement came amid growing disillusionment with Puerto Rico's territorial status due to the lack of access to federal funds for recent natural disasters, such as Hurricane Maria and the COVID-19 pandemic. Mainland support * The 1940 Democratic Party platform expressed their support to a larger measure of self-government leading to statehood for Puerto Rico. * The Democratic platform of 1940 said: * President Gerald Ford proposed statehood in 1976: * President Ronald Reagan favored statehood: * President George H. W. Bush raised the issue of statehood before Congress in his first State of the Union message in 1989: * President George H. W. Bush issued a memorandum on November 30, 1992, to heads of executive departments and agencies, establishing the current administrative relationship between the federal government and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. This memorandum directs all federal departments, agencies, and officials to treat Puerto Rico administratively as if it were a state insofar as doing so would not disrupt federal programs or operations. * On December 23, 2000, President Bill Clinton signed executive Order 13183, which established the President's Task Force on Puerto Rico's Status and the rules for its membership. Section 4 of executive Order 13183 (as amended by executive Order 13319) directs the Task Force to \\"report on its actions to the President ... on progress made in the determination of Puerto Rico's ultimate status.\\" President George W. Bush signed an additional amendment to Executive Order 13183 on December 3, 2003, which established the current co-chairs and instructed the Task Force to issue reports as needed, but no less than once every two years. * Both the Democratic Party and Republican Party, in their respective 2008 party platforms, have expressed their support of the rights of the United States citizens in Puerto Rico to determine the destiny of the Commonwealth to achieve a future permanent non-territorial political status with government by consent and full enfranchisement. * The Republican Party platforms of 2008, 2012 and 2016 stated: * The Democratic Party platform of 2008 stated: * The Democratic Party of 2012 stated: * The latest report by the President's Task Force on Puerto Rico's Status recommends that all relevant partiesthe President, Congress, and the leadership and people of Puerto Ricowork to ensure that Puerto Ricans are able to express their will about status options and have that will acted upon by the end of 2012 or soon thereafter.REPORT BY THE PRESIDENT's TASK FORCE ON PUERTO RICO's STATUS , page 23, Recommendation No. 1 & page 30, Recommendation No. 7 & Recommendation No. 2, page 24, 2nd paragraph of page 28, March 11, 2011, The White House. * The report further recommends, \\"If efforts on the Island do not provide a clear result in the short term, the President should support, and Congress should enact, self-executing legislation that specifies in advance for the people of Puerto Rico a set of acceptable status options, including the Statehood, that the United States is politically committed to fulfilling. This legislation should commit the United States to honor the choice of the people of Puerto Rico (provided it is one of the status options specified in the legislation) and should specify the means by which such a choice would be made. The Task Force recommends that, by the end of 2012, the Administration develop, draft, and work with Congress to enact the proposed legislation.\\" Statehood supporters Congressman Ruben Gallego speaking in support of Puerto Rican statehood in 2019.

Pinafore (1878) and Frederic in The Pirates of Penzance (1880). He later became a noted voice teacher and continued to perform, mostly at society events. On the death of his elder brother, in 1903, he became the seventh baronet of Kilfane. Early years Power was born in Kilkenny, the fourth son of Sir John Power of Kilfane, and his wife, Frances Elizabeth, n√©e Wade, from Clonabrany, County Meath. He was educated at Cheltenham College and Trinity College, Dublin, and studied voice in Milan and Florence from 1873 to 1876, with Achille Graffigna and Francesco Lamperti, among others.\\"Power, Sir George\\", Who Was Who, A & C Black, 1920‚Äì2008; online edition, Oxford University Press, December 2007, accessed 28 June 2010G√§nzl, Kurt. \\"Sir Ralph Rackstraw, Bart \\", Kurt G√§nzl's blog, 7 May 2018 In 1876, Power first appeared on stage at the Teatro Manoel in Valletta, Malta, singing Count Almaviva in The Barber of Seville. He made his London stage debut in December 1877 at Her Majesty's Theatre playing the tenor role in Thomas Haynes Bayly's English version of Adolphe Adam's opera The Swiss Cottage.The Morning Post, 25 December 1877, p. 4 This proved to be Power's only appearance in serious opera. Power joined Richard D'Oyly Carte's Comedy- Opera Company in February 1878 at the Opera Comique in London, succeeding George Bentham in the leading tenor role of Alexis in Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera The Sorcerer. From March to April 1878 Power also played the Defendant in Trial by Jury when that companion piece was added to the bill at the Opera Comique.\\"The London Theatres\\", The Era, 31 March 1878, p. 12 He created the role of Ralph Rackstraw in the next Gilbert and Sullivan opera, H.M.S. Pinafore, \\"one of the most successful pieces of musical theatre of the Victorian era\\" playing the character from May 1878 to February 1880. The Daily News wrote that Power \\"displayed a light tenor voice of very agreeable quality, and acted the part of the sentimental lover well\\", although The Times found his intonation \\"a little uncertain\\".Allen, p. 77. When The Pirates of Penzance premiered in London, Power originated the role of Frederic in that opera.Stone, David. George Power at Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company (1875‚Äì1982), The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 27 August 2001, accessed 27 July 2010Power and HMS Pinafore at the Theatre History website Power received warm reviews for this role from the London press. The Times said that his \\"sympathetic tenor voice was heard to great advantage in the sentimental music\\", and The Standard wrote that he \\"acts ... just in that simple-minded way that brings out most strongly the absurdity of the character, and he sings exceedingly well.\\"Allen, p. 109. A critic from The New York Times, however, commented: \\"Temple has been a member of the Gilbert- Sullivan company from the first. Mr George Power has not: and his \\"thin\\" style is a material drawback. As an actor, he is weak, as a man he is not interesting, as a tenor he is small. Once or twice he sang sweetly, and he was always in tune. As a concert singer he would probably be very successful in sentimental ballads; as Frederic he is unsatisfactory.\\"\\"The Pirates in London\\". The New York Times, 20 April 1880, p. 2. The Era agreed with the majority: \\"a very agreeable light tenor voice and a pleasing style, qualities which have already gained for him no little favour in the previous opera ‚Ä¶ [he has] good taste vocally and a fair amount of histrionic skill.\\" During the run of Pirates, Power took part in some Sunday matin√©e performances of new operettas along with D'Oyly Carte colleague Rutland Barrington, and on one occasion acted in a non-musical play, L'Aventuri√®re, given in the original French by a cast headed by Herbert Beerbohm Tree.\\"The Examiner of Plays\\", The Examiner, 15 May 1880, p. 609 Power played Frederic until October 1880, when he left the D'Oyly Carte company. Later years Power, Leonora Braham, Jessie Bond and Julia Gwynne at Sullivan's memorial in 1914 Over the following months, Power performed mostly in society concerts. In May 1881, he appeared in the operetta Incognito, by Henri Log√©, and in July 1881, Power played Lieut. de Blanc-Mange in a short operetta, Out of Sight, by Frederick Clay and B. C. Stephenson.\\"Out of Sight\\", The Era, 9 July 1881, p. 7 In August 1881, he created the role of Charles Lorrimore in the Edward Solomon and Henry Pottinger Stephens comic opera Claude Duval, at the Olympic Theatre, opposite Marion Hood, who had been his partner in The Pirates of Penzance. The production ran for only 54 performances, and Power left the production three days before it closed in October.The Standard, 26 October 1881; p. 4 Power then became a teacher of singing,Fitz-Gerald, S. J. Adair. \\"The Story of the Savoy Opera in Gilbert and Sullivan Days\\", p. 41, London: Stanley Paul & Co. (1924) continuing to make occasional appearances on the stage until he end of the century, mostly in concert and society events, and with Percy North's Operetta Company. In 1885 he played Colonel Sylvester at Hove in a new operetta, When One Door Shuts Another Opens by Harriet Young and Charles Thomas.\\"A New Operetta\\", The Era, 31 October 1885, p. 17 His students included the Russian tenor Vladimir Rosing. When his elder brother Sir Adam Clayton Power (1844‚Äì1903) died, Power succeeded to his family's baronetcy as the seventh baronet of Kilfane.Power on The Peerage.com Together with Jessie Bond, Leonora Braham and Julia Gwynne, he was one of four artistes of the original D'Oyly Carte Opera Company who attended a reunion at the Savoy Hotel in 1914. The four then posed for a group photograph beside Arthur Sullivan's monument in the Victoria Embankment Gardens. On 2 September 1915, by then in his late 60s, Power married Eva Gertrude Boulton (1864‚Äì1952), the daughter of family friend Sir Samuel Bagster Boulton and Sophia Louisa Cooper. There were no children, and the Power baronetcy ended on his death in 1928. Power died in Kensington, London, aged 81, and is buried in the Boulton Family Vault in Brookwood Cemetery.
