S - Z, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, p. 1810 is a historic and ethnographic area in Romania, inhabited mainly by Sz√©kelys. Its cultural centre is the city of T√¢rgu Mure»ô (Marosv√°s√°rhely), the largest settlement in the region. Sz√©kelys (or Szeklers), a subgroup of Hungarians, live in the valleys and hills of the Eastern Carpathian Mountains, corresponding to the present-day Harghita, Covasna, and parts of Mure»ô counties in Romania. Originally, the name Sz√©kely Land denoted the territories of a number of autonomous Sz√©kely seats within Transylvania. The self-governing Szekler seats had their own administrative system,J√≥zsa H√©vizi, Thomas J. DeKornfeld, Autonomies in Hungary and Europe: a comparative study, Corvinus Society, 2005, p. 195 and existed as legal entities from medieval times until the 1870s. The privileges of the Sz√©kely and Saxon seats were abolished and seats were replaced with counties in 1876. Along with Transylvania and eastern parts of Hungary proper, Sz√©kely Land became a part of Romania in 1920, in accordance with the Treaty of Trianon. In August 1940, as a consequence of the Second Vienna Award, the northern territories of Transylvania, including Sz√©kely Land, were ceded to Hungary, under Third Reich auspices. Northern Transylvania came under the control of Soviet and Romanian forces in 1944, and were confirmed as part of Romania by the Paris peace treaties, signed after World War II, in 1947. Under the name Magyar Autonomous Region, with T√¢rgu-Mure»ô as capital, parts of Sz√©kely Land enjoyed a certain level of autonomy between 8 September 1952 and 16 February 1968. There are territorial autonomy initiatives with the aim to obtain self-governance for this region within Romania. Geography The exact territory of present-day Szeklerland is disputed. The boundaries of the historical Sz√©kely seats and the present-day administrative divisions of Romania are dissimilar. According to Minahan its territory is an estimated . The autonomy proposal of the Szekler National Council consists of about 13,000 km2. This size is close to the extent of the historical Sz√©kely Land. However, it does not contain the region of Aranyos Seat. The UDMR's autonomy project covers a slightly bigger territory. It includes the whole territories of Mure»ô, Harghita, and Covasna counties. History Sz√©kely flag - Kurult√°j, 2014 =The ancient period= Transylvania was populated by Thracian peoples in the First Iron Age. The area received a large influx of Scythians from the East in the first half of the first millennium BC. The Celts appeared in Transylvania in the La T√®ne period (c. 4th century BC). Dacian culture presence in southeastern Transylvania is marked by discoveries such as the flagship hoard S√¢ncrƒÉieni (Harghita county) or Dacian fortresses in Covasna county (Cetatea Z√¢nelor) or Jigodin (Harghita county). Dacian Kingdom led by Decebal was taken after two wars, in 106 AD by the Roman Empire under the emperor Trajan, who began organizing the new Roman province of Dacia. Southeastern Transylvania was included in the provinces of Dacia Porolissensis, Dacia Apulensis and Meuse and fortified with numerous camps such as those at InlƒÉceni ( Praetoria Augusta) and S√¢npaul (Harghita county) Bre≈£cu (Angustia) and Oltenia (Covasna county) or Br√¢ncovene≈üti and CƒÉlugƒÉreni (Mure»ô county). After the fall of Roman Dacia, present-day territory of Szeklerland became part of the Thervingi kingdom \\"Gutthiuda\\". The migration of the Huns from the east pressured most of the German tribes to leave. In the Battle of Nedao the East Germanic Gepids defeated the Huns and founded Gepidia in the territory of present-day Transylvania. This marked the end of the Hunnic Empire. =The medieval period= The territory of Szeklerland was part of the Avar Khaganate. During this period, Avar and Slavic groups migrated into Transylvania. From around 900 to 1526 the area was under the direct control of the Hungarian state. The Szeklers presumably settled in Transylvania in the 12th century from present day Bihar and Bihor counties. Ancient Hungarian legends suggest a connection between the Sz√©kelys and Attila's Huns. The origin of the Sz√©kely people is still debated. The Sz√©kely seats were the traditional self-governing territorial units of the Transylvanian Sz√©kelys during medieval times. (Saxons were also organised in seats.) The Seats were not part of the traditional Hungarian county system, and their inhabitants enjoyed a higher level of freedom (especially until the 18th century) than those living in the counties. From the 12th and 13th centuries, the Sz√©kely Land enjoyed a considerable but varying amount of autonomy, first as a part of the Kingdom of Hungary, then inside the Principality of Transylvania. The autonomy was largely due to the military service the Sz√©kely provided until the beginning of the 18th century. The medieval Sz√©kely Land was an alliance of the seven autonomous Sz√©kely seats of Udvarhely, Cs√≠k, Maros, Sepsi, K√©zdi, Orbai and Aranyos. The number of seats later decreased to five, when Sepsi, K√©zdi and Orbai seats were united into one territorial unit called H√°romsz√©k (literally Three seats). The main seat was Udvarhely seat, which was also called the Principal seat () At Sz√©kelyudvarhely (Odorheiu Secuiesc) were held many national assemblies of the Sz√©kelys A known exception is the 1554 assembly, which took place at Marosv√°s√°rhely (T√¢rgu Mure»ô)http://mek.oszk.hu/03100/03187/03187.pdf =Modern era= Due to the Ottoman conquest Transylvania became a semi-independent polity. From the end of the 17th century, Transylvania became part of the Habsburg Monarchy (later Austrian Empire), and governed by imperial governors. In 1867, as a result of the Austro-Hungarian Compromise, Transylvania become an integral part of the Kingdom of Hungary, within Austria-Hungary. In 1876, a general administrative reform abolished all the autonomous areas in the Kingdom of Hungary and created a unified system of counties. As a result, the autonomy of the Sz√©kely Land came to an end as well. Four counties were created in its place: Udvarhely, H√°romsz√©k, Cs√≠k, and Maros-Torda. (Only half of the territory of Maros-Torda originally belonged to Sz√©kely Land.) The isolated Aranyossz√©k became a district of Torda-Aranyos county. In December 1918, in the wake of the First World War, Romanian delegates from throughout Transylvania voted to join the Kingdom of Romania. There was an attempt in Sz√©kelyudvarhely to found a \\"Sz√©kely Republic\\" on 9 January 1919; however, its creation was unsuccessful.B√âLA K√ñPECZI, HISTORY OF TRANSYLVANIA, Volume III. From 1830 to 1919, Atlantic Research and Publications, Inc., 2001-2002, p. 784 In 1920, by the Treaty of Trianon, Transylvania along with further territories was officially ceded to the Kingdom of Romania. The Romanian language officially replaced Hungarian in the Sz√©kely Land, but Sz√©kely county boundaries were preserved, and Sz√©kely districts were able to elect their own officials at local level and to preserve Hungarian-language education. After 1930, the Romanian authorities began to Romanianize the Hungarian population of Sz√©kely Land.;S√°ndor B√≠r√≥, The Nationalities Problem in Transylvania, 1867-1940: A Social History of the Romanian Minority Under Hungarian Rule, 1867-1918 and of the Hungarian Minority Under Romanian Rule, 1918-1940, Social Science Monographs, 1992, p. 486. the presence of minorities in political life was repressed. The election of Hungarians was consistently nullified. The place-names were subjected to Romanianization. The minority languages were excised from official life and the local authorities were mostly led by appointed ethnic Romanians.Michael Mandelbaum, The New European Diasporas: National Minorities and Conflict in Eastern Europe, Council on Foreign Relations Press, 2000, p. 33 In 1940, as a result of the Second Vienna Award, Northern Transylvania became part of Hungary again; this territory included most of the historical Sz√©kely areas. Hungarian authorities subsequently restored the pre-Trianon structure with slight modifications. Ion Gigurtu's antisemitic laws, the Romanian version of Nuremberg Laws, were replaced by Hungarian ones. The Jews of the Sz√©kely Land were subjected to particularly harsh treatment. These individuals had their citizenship status reviewed, many of them being detained. In Cs√≠kszereda (Miercurea Ciuc), dozens of families were rounded up and expelled. The men in the area were drafted into forced labor battalions. For example, 1,200 Jewish males of Marosv√°s√°rhely (T√¢rgu Mure»ô) were conscripted between 1941 and 1944; over half died in Ukraine, Poland and Hungary.Shmuel Spector, Geoffrey Wigoder (eds.), The Encyclopedia of Jewish Life Before and During the Holocaust: Seredina-Buda-Z, p. 1289. NYU Press, 2001, However, despite discrimination and many casualties, most of the community lived in relative safety until the March 1944 occupation of Hungary by Nazi Germany. A conference devoted to the concentration of Jews in the Sz√©kely Land was held on 28 April 1944; it covered the counties of Cs√≠k, H√°romsz√©k, Maros-Torda and Udvarhely. The area's Jews were ghettoized in Sz√°szr√©gen (Reghin), Sepsiszentgy√∂rgy (Sf√¢ntu Gheorghe) and Marosv√°s√°rhely. Roundups began on 3 May 1944 and were completed within a week. The Hungarian authorities actively participated in the crimes of the Nazis. The Jews ghettoized at Sepsiszentgy√∂rgy were later sent to Sz√°szr√©gen, whence on 4 June 1944, 3,149 were boarded on a train bound for the Auschwitz concentration camp. Three transports left Marosv√°s√°hely for Auschwitz: on 27 May, 30 May and 8 June 1944; altogether, they carried 7,549 Jews.\\"The Holocaust in Northern Transylvania\\", part of the Final Report of the International Commission on the Holocaust in Romania, at the Yad Vashem site Sz√©kely Land as envisaged by the autonomy supporters based on the historical Sz√©kely seats. On 12 September 1944, the Second Vienna Award was voided by the Allied Commission through the Armistice Agreement with Romania, and the Romanian-Soviet forces seized the area in Autumn 1944; however, the Romanian administration was expelled from these territories in October due to the activities of the Romanian paramilitary groups created in the area to avenge the atrocities committed by the Hungarians against the Romanians during the Hungarian rule in Northern Transylvania.Rogers Brubaker, Nationalist Politics and Everyday Ethnicity in a Transylvanian Town, Princeton University Press, 2006, p. 80 For instance, the so-called Iuliu Maniu Guards terrorized the Szekler villages, butchered the local Hungarians by axe and hatchet and operated a death camp in Feldioara.FBIS Daily Report: East Europe, Issues 159-169, Issues 159-169, The Service, 1988, p. 6The New Hungarian Quarterly, Volumes 31-32, Corvina Press, 1990, p. 34\\"Magyar civilek intern√°l√°sa 1944 ≈ësz√©n Rom√°ni√°ban, Hungarian Civilians‚Äô Relocation in the Autumn of 1944 in Romania.

Iacob, History of Communism in Europe vol. 3 / 2012, Zeta Books, 2012, p. 53 by the Soviets. The USSR let the Romanian authorities back to the area in March 1945, and the Paris Peace Treaties officially returned Northern Transylvania to Romania. Following the Northern Transylvania's return to Romania after World War II, a Magyar Autonomous Region was created in 1952 under the Soviets' pressure,Nicolae Edroiu, Vasile Pu»ôca»ô, The Hungarians of Romania, Funda≈£ia Cultural«é Rom√¢n«é, 1996, p. 27Plural Societies, Volume 18, Foundation for the Study of Plural Societies., 1988, p. 71 which encompassed most of the land inhabited by the Sz√©kelys. In 1960, the region was renamed to Mure»ô-Magyar Autonomous Region. It was abolished in 1968, when Romania, following an administrative reform, returned to its traditional local administrative system based on counties. Roughly speaking, present-day Harghita County encompasses the former Udvarhely and Cs√≠k, the latter including Gyergy√≥sz√©k; Covasna County covers more or less the territory of the former H√°romsz√©k; and what was once Maros-Torda is mostly part of present-day Mure≈ü County. The former Aranyossz√©k is today divided between Cluj and Alba counties. Nicolae Ceau»ôescu got to power in 1965. For the next couple of decades, due to the Romanianization efforts, a large number of ethnic Romanians settled in Sz√©kely Land.Ingrid Piller, Linguistic Diversity and Social Justice: An Introduction to Applied Sociolinguistics, Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 101 Those Sz√©kely Hungarians who possessed degrees were subjected to resettlement. In March 1990, the city of T√¢rgu Mure»ô witnessed violent clashes between ethnic Romanian and Hungarian groups. After the fall of communism, many hoped that the former Magyar Autonomous Region, abolished by Nicolae Ceau≈üescu's regime, would soon be restored. This did not happen; however, there are Sz√©kely autonomy initiativesManifesto of the Szekely Assembly and further efforts from Sz√©kely organisations to reach a higher level of self-governance for the Sz√©kely Land within Romania. On 2 February 2009, Romanian President Traian BƒÉsescu met the Hungarian President L√°szl√≥ S√≥lyom in Budapest and discussed the issues of minority rights and regional autonomy. BƒÉsescu stated \\"The Hungarian minority will never be given territorial autonomy.\\" In 2014, the UDMR and the Hungarian Civic Party had a joint autonomy proposal for Szeklerland but the Szekler National Council also possessed its own suggestion. In 2016, Hans G. Klemm, the United States Ambassador to Romania, together with other local officials, were pictured with a Szekler flag during his visit to Szeklerland. The photo was posted by the mayor of Sf√¢ntu Gheorghe on Facebook. The reactions of the politicians in Bucharest were turbulent. In a response Klemm affirmed that the only two flags that are important to him, as a diplomat, are the U.S. and the Romanian ones.http://www.nineoclock.ro/new-reactions-in-row-over-photo-showing- american-ambassador-holding-szekely-flag-we-were-not-dishonest-with- ambassador-u-s-ambassador-says-sfantu-gheorghe-mayor/ Image:Sz√©kely counties towns.svgTraditional Sz√©kely Land (19th century) File:Hungarian autonomous province02.pngHungarian autonomous provinces under the Communist era File:Szekelyfold.svgPresent-day counties of Harghita, Covasna, and Mure»ô within Romania =Constitutional issues= Article 1 of the Romanian Constitution defines the country as a \\"sovereign, independent, unitary and indivisible national state.\\" It has often been argued that, as a result of this provision, any ethnic-based territorial autonomy, including that of the Sz√©kely Land, would be unconstitutional. The Supreme Council of National Defence of Romania declared that an autonomy of the so-called Sz√©kely Land would be unconstitutional. Population In 2002 the estimated ethnic composition of Sz√©kely Land (Mure»ô, Covasna and Harghita counties) consisted of Hungarians (61%), Romanians (33%), Germans (3%) and Roma (3%). The area forms a Hungarian ethnic enclave within present-day Romania.B√©la Tomka, A Social History of Twentieth-Century Europe, Routledge, 2013, p. 411Sherrill Stroschein, Ethnic Struggle, Coexistence, and Democratization in Eastern Europe, Cambridge University Press, 2012, p. 210 Cited: \\"Sz√©kely, a Hungarian sub-group that is concentrated in the mountainous Hungarian enclave\\" The population of historical Sz√©kely Land (according to the 2002 census) is 809,000, 612,043 of them Hungarians, accounting for 75.65% of the total. The Hungarians represent 59% of the populations of Harghita, Covasna and Mure»ô counties. The percentage of Hungarians is higher in Harghita and Covasna (84.8% and 73.58% respectively), and lower in Mure»ô County, not all of which falls inside the traditional region (37.82%). According to the 2011 official census, 609,033 Hungarians (56.8%) live in the counties of Covasna, Harghita and Mure»ô (out of a total population of 1,071,890 inhabitants). In Mure»ô county the Romanians are the most numerous (52.6%), while in the counties of Covasna and Harghita, the Hungarians make up the majority (71.6% and 82.9%). The 2011 census compared to the data of the previous census (2002) also shows that the Romanian ethnic ratio in Szeklerland has been decreasing (due to emigration).Horv√°th Istv√°n, Tonk M√°rton, Minority politics within the Europe of regions, Editura ISPMN, 2014, p. 205 T√¢rgu Mure»ô is the home for the largest community of Hungarians in Romania (57,532 in 2011), but the town itself has a Romanian majority (66,943 out of 127,849 inhabitants). Important centers of the Sz√©kely Land are T√¢rgu-Mure≈ü (Marosv√°s√°rhely), Miercurea Ciuc (Cs√≠kszereda), Sf√¢ntu Gheorghe (Sepsiszentgy√∂rgy), and Odorheiu Secuiesc (Sz√©kelyudvarhely).

It consisted of one infantry division, one horsed cavalry division, and two brigade-strength infantry detachments. It formed part of the 2nd Army Group, and was responsible for the defence of the section of the Yugoslav-Hungarian border between the Danube and the Tisza rivers. The 1st Army was not directly attacked during the first few days after the invasion commenced, but attacks on its flanks resulted in successive orders to withdraw to the lines of the Danube and then the Sava. The Hungarians then crossed the border in the sector for which the 1st Army had been responsible, but the Yugoslavs were already withdrawing and the Hungarians faced almost no resistance. This was followed by the German capture of Belgrade and the rear area units of 1st Army. Remnants of the 1st Army continued to resist along the line of the Sava, within days, tens of thousands of Yugoslav soldiers had been captured. The Germans closed on Sarajevo, and accepted the unconditional surrender of the Royal Yugoslav Army on 17 April, which came into effect at the following day. Background alt=Map highlighting the location of Yugoslavia The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was created with the merger of Serbia, Montenegro and the South Slav- inhabited areas of Austria-Hungary on 1 December 1918, in the immediate aftermath of World War I. The Army of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was established to defend the new state. It was formed around the nucleus of the victorious Royal Serbian Army, as well as armed formations raised in regions formerly controlled by Austria-Hungary. Many former Austro- Hungarian officers and soldiers became members of the new army. From the beginning, much like other aspects of public life in the new kingdom, the army was dominated by ethnic Serbs, who saw it as a means by which to secure Serb political hegemony. The army's development was hampered by the kingdom's poor economy, and this continued during the 1920s. In 1929, King Alexander changed the name of the country to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, at which time the army was renamed the Royal Yugoslav Army (, VKJ). The army budget remained tight, and as tensions rose across Europe during the 1930s, it became difficult to secure weapons and munitions from other countries. Consequently, at the time World War II broke out in September 1939, the VKJ had several serious weaknesses, which included reliance on draught animals for transport, and the large size of its formations. Infantry divisions had a wartime strength of 26,000‚Äì27,000 men, as compared to contemporary British infantry divisions of half that strength. These characteristics resulted in slow, unwieldy formations, and the inadequate supply of arms and munitions meant that even the very large Yugoslav formations had low firepower. Generals better suited to the trench warfare of World War I were combined with an army that was neither equipped nor trained to resist the fast-moving combined arms approach used by the Germans in their invasions of Poland and France. The weaknesses of the VKJ in strategy, structure, equipment, mobility and supply were exacerbated by serious ethnic disunity within Yugoslavia, resulting from two decades of Serb hegemony and the attendant lack of political legitimacy achieved by the central government. Attempts to address the disunity came too late to ensure that the VKJ was a cohesive force. Fifth column activity was also a serious concern, not only from the Croatian nationalist Usta≈°e but also from the country's Slovene and ethnic German minorities. Composition The 1st Army was commanded by Armijski ƒëeneral Milan Raƒëenkoviƒá, and his chief of staff was Brigadni ƒëeneral Todor Miliƒáeviƒá. It was organised and mobilised on a geographic basis from the 1st Army District, which was divided into divisional districts, each of which was subdivided into regimental regions. The 1st Army consisted of: * 7th Infantry Division Potiska * 3rd Cavalry Division * Infantry Detachment Senta (brigade-strength) * Infantry Detachment Sombor (brigade-strength) Its support units included the 56th Army Artillery Regiment, the 1st Anti-Aircraft Battalion, and the 1st Army Anti-Aircraft Company. The 1st Air Reconnaissance Group comprising fifteen Breguet 19s was attached from the Royal Yugoslav Air Force and was based at Ruma just south of Novi Sad. Deployment The 1st Army was part of the 2nd Army Group, which was responsible for the eastern section of the Yugoslav-Hungarian border, with the 1st Army deployed in the Baƒçka region between the Danube and the Tisza, and the 2nd Army in the Baranya and Slavonia regions between Slatina and the Danube. On the right flank of the 1st Army was the 6th Army, an independent formation that was responsible for the defence of the Yugoslav Banat region east of the Tisza. The boundary with the 2nd Army ran just east of the Danube to Vukovar, then south towards Bijeljina. The boundary with the 6th Army ran just to the east of the Tisza to the confluence with the Danube, then south across the Sava through Obrenovac. The Yugoslav defence plan saw the 1st Army deployed with one division forward with an infantry detachment on each flank, and a cavalry division held in depth. The deployment of the 1st Army from west to east was: * Infantry Detachment Sombor around Sombor * 7th Infantry Division Potiska centred on Baƒçka Topola with its forward elements in Subotica * Infantry Detachment Senta around Senta * 3rd Cavalry Division south of the Danube in the Fru≈°ka Gora region between Novi Sad and Sremska Mitrovica The 44th Infantry Division Unska, which was under the direct command of the General Headquarters of the VKJ, was deployed in the 1st Army area to the east of the 3rd Cavalry Division, centred on Stara Pazova on the road between Novi Sad and Belgrade. Operations =6‚Äì10 April= The 1st Army faced the Hungarian 3rd Army, and during the first few days after the commencement of the invasion, there were exchanges of fire with Hungarian border guards, but the 1st Army faced no direct attacks. Neither the 1st Army or the Hungarians were ready for full-scale fighting, as they were still mobilising and deploying their forces. On 9 April, due to events in other parts of Yugoslavia, the 6th Army on the right flank of the 1st Army was ordered to withdraw south of the Danube and deploy on a line facing east to defend against an attack from the direction of Sofia, Bulgaria. 2nd Army Group also received orders to withdraw south of the line of the Drava and Danube. 1st Army began to withdraw, and on the same day elements were approaching the Danube crossing. The following day, the situation deteriorated significantly when the German XLI Motorised Corps crossed the Yugoslav-Romanian border into the Yugoslav Banat and struck the 6th Army, halting its withdrawal and disrupting its ability to organise a coherent defence behind the Danube. Also on 10 April, the main thrust of the XLVI Motorised Corps of the 2nd Army, consisting of the 8th Panzer Division leading the 16th Motorised Infantry Division crossed the Drava at Barcs in the 4th Army sector. The 8th Panzer Division turned southeast between the Drava and Sava rivers, and meeting almost no resistance and with strong air support, had reached Slatina by evening, despite poor roads and bad weather. Later that day, as the situation was becoming increasingly desperate throughout the country, Du≈°an Simoviƒá, who was both the Prime Minister and Yugoslav Chief of the General Staff, broadcast the following message: The bulk of the 1st Army were able to cross the Danube and began to prepare defences. By the evening of 10 April, the 1st Army was ordered to withdraw from this line and form a defensive line behind the Sava from Debrc to the confluence with the Vrbas river, for which one or two days would be needed. On the night of 10/11 April, the whole 2nd Army Group continued its withdrawal, but units of the 2nd Army on the left flank of the 1st Army that included significant numbers of Croats began to dissolve due to the fifth column activities of the fascist Usta≈°e and their sympathisers. =11‚Äì12 April= alt=a black and white photograph of a two engined monoplane At dawn on 11 April, Hungarian forces, consisting with the Mobile, IV and V Corps of Vez√©rezredes (Lieutenant General) Elem√©r Gorondy-Nov√°k's 3rd Army, crossed the Yugoslav border north of Osijek and near Subotica, overcame Yugoslav border guards and advanced on Subotica and Paliƒá. The XLVI Motorised Corps continued to push east south of the Drava, with the 8th Panzer Division capturing Na≈°ice, Osijek on the Drava, and Vukovar on the Danube, followed by the 16th Motorised Infantry Division which advanced east of Na≈°ice, despite bridge demolitions and poor roads. The 8th Panzer Division had effectively routed the 2nd Army Group by 11 April. On the same day, Messerschmitt Bf 110's of I Group of the 26th Heavy Fighter Wing ( 26, ZG 26) destroyed several 1st Air Reconnaissance Group Breguet 19s at Ruma. The rest were flown to Bijeljina, but were destroyed the following day when I/ZG 26 swept over the airfield in one of the most effective attacks of the campaign. On the night of 11/12 April, the 8th Panzer Division captured Sremska Mitrovica on the Sava at 02:30, destroyed a bridge over the Danube at Bogojevo, and advanced on Lazarevac about south of Belgrade. These advances delayed the withdrawal of the 2nd Army Group south of the Sava. By 12 April, the withdrawal of the 2nd Army Group was being threatened from the left flank, with 2nd Army having \\"no combat importance at all\\". On the right flank, 6th Army attempted to regroup while being pressed by the 11th Panzer Division as it drove towards Belgrade. West of Belgrade, remnants of the 2nd Army Group tried to establish a line along the Sava, but XLVI Motorised Corps had already captured the bridges. When elements of the 8th Panzer Division captured Zemun without a fight, they captured 1st Army's rear area units. On 12 April, the 1st Army's 3rd Cavalry Division counter-attacked at ≈†abac and pushed the Germans back across the Sava. The Hungarians pursued the 1st Army south, and occupied the area between the Danube and the Tisza meeting virtually no resistance. Serb Chetnik irregulars fought isolated engagements, and the Hungarian General Staff considered irregular resistance forces to be their only significant opposition. The Hungarian 1st Parachute Battalion captured canal bridges at Vrbas and Srbobran. This, the first airborne operation in Hungarian history, was not without incident. The battalion's aircraft consisted of five Italian- made Savoia-Marchetti SM.75 transport aircraft formerly with the civilian airline MALERT, but pressed into service with the Royal Hungarian Air Force (, MKHL) at the start of the European war. Shortly after takeoff from the airport at Veszpr√©m-Jutas on the afternoon of 12 April, the command plane, code E-101, crashed with the loss of 20 or 23 lives, including 19 paratroopers. This was the heaviest single loss suffered by the Hungarians during the Yugoslav campaign. Meanwhile, Sombor was captured against determined Chetnik resistance, and Subotica was also captured. alt=a black and white photograph of troops and animals pulling vehicles out of the mud On the evening of 12 April, elements of the SS Motorised Infantry Division Reich, under command of XLI Motorised Corps crossed the Danube in pneumatic boats and captured Belgrade without resistance. About the same time, most of the elements of XLVI Motorised Corps that were approaching Belgrade from the west were redirected away from the capital. Elements of the 8th Panzer Division did continue their thrust to capture the Sava bridges to the west of Belgrade, and entered the city during the night. The rest of the 8th Panzer Division turned southeast and drove towards Valjevo to link up with the left flank of the First Panzer Group southwest of Belgrade. The 16th Motorised Infantry Division was redirected south across the Sava, and advanced toward Zvornik. Fate On 13 April, the Hungarians occupied Baranja without resistance, and pushed south through Baƒçka to reach the line of Novi Sad and the Great Baƒçka Canal. Early on 14 April, the remnants of 2nd Army Group, including the 1st Army, continued to fight against the 8th Panzer Division and 16th Motorised Infantry Division along the Sava. On 14 and 15 April, tens of thousands of Yugoslav soldiers were taken prisoner by the Germans during their drive on Sarajevo in the centre of the country, including 30,000 around Zvornik and 6,000 around Doboj. On 15 April, the 8th and 14th Panzer Divisions entered Sarajevo. After a delay in locating appropriate signatories for the surrender document, the Yugoslav High Command unconditionally surrendered in Belgrade effective at 12:00 on 18 April.

In Latin script typography, roman is one of the three main kinds of historical type, alongside blackletter and italic. Roman type was modelled from a European scribal manuscript style of the 15th century, based on the pairing of inscriptional capitals used in ancient Rome with Carolingian minuscules developed in the Holy Roman Empire.Bringhurst, p 124. During the early Renaissance, roman (in the form of Antiqua) and italic type were used separately. Today, roman and italic type are mixed, and most typefaces are composed of an upright roman style with an associated italic or oblique style. Early roman typefaces show a variety of designs, for instance characters resembling what would now be considered blackletter. Printers and typefounders such as Nicolas Jenson and Aldus Manutius in Venice and later Robert Estienne in France codified the modern characteristics of Roman type, for instance an 'h' with a nearly straight right leg, serifs on the outside of the capital 'M' and 'N', and 'e' with level cross stroke, by the 1530s. Popular roman typefaces include Bembo, Baskerville, Caslon, Jenson, Times New Roman and Garamond. The name roman is customarily applied uncapitalized distinguishing early Italian typefaces of the Renaissance period and most subsequent upright types based on them, in contrast to Roman letters dating from classical antiquity.Bringhurst.Nesbitt.

It is just north of the M4 motorway in West Berkshire, in the civil parish of Yattendon (where according to the Grid Ref the 2011 Census population was mostly included), which is also the closest village, and lies in the North Wessex Downs area of outstanding natural beauty (AONB). History Burnt Hill is thought to have been established as a brick making settlement in the 18th century and there were several brick works in the area in the 18th and 19th centuries. The hamlet probably takes its name from the glow in the night sky from the firing of bricks. In 1703 one Isaac Jeram is recorded as working in bricks at Burnt Hill.In the Valley of the Pang, Dick Greenaway and Dorcas Ward In the south east of the village is Kiln Pond and, as its name suggests, this was probably a source of clay for the brick making. By 1830 in reaction to the introduction of mechanisation to agriculture the South of England erupted in what became known as the Swing Riots. Disturbances started in nearby Yattendon and on 21 November a hard core of rioters met at the Axe and Compass, Burnt Hill. After a night at the pub they acquired a sledge hammer and a horn and at first light set off to local farms to extort money and smash threshing machines, later returning to the Axe and Compass before setting off again at nightfall to other farms in the area. By the early hours of 24 November the troops arrived and arrested eleven of the rioters although none was eventually charged.Basildon, Berkshire An Illustrated History, Clive Williams Landscape Burnt Hill is surrounded by fields of the Yattendon Estate, many of Christmas trees, for which the estate is well known and Burnt Hill Common of mixed woodland. There was a convoy camp stationed at Burnt Hill Common during World War 2 and concrete foundations of many of the building can still be found in amongst the trees. Combined Ashampstead and Burnt Hill Commons are 80 hectares of mixed woodland. Until the mid 13th century the Commons were pasture woodland. Subsequently, they were enclosed to form a deer park with a substantial bank and inner ditch that can still be traced for some 5.5 km.In the Valley of the Pang, Dick Greenaway and Dorcas Ward The main street around which most of the village is arranged is named Scratchface Lane, probably referring to the narrow, bramble strewn track it once was. Buildings There are some notable buildings in Burnt Hill including the Methodist Chapel 1864 which is still in use, Burnt Hill House, Burnt Hill Cottage, Wistaria Cottage (now very much extended), Sloe Pightle (pightle a small field or enclosure presumably where sloes grew) and Nut & Bolt House formerly the Axe and Compass Public House ( The Compasses Inn). The Axe and Compass changed its name to the Nut & Bolt Public House in the 1970s (reputedly after the licensees of the time; John and Val Bolton Pub Names of Britain, Leslie Dunkling and Gordon Wright ) According to the West Berkshire Campaign for Real Ale when the Boltons were asked why they changed the name they said, \\"Because we are the Bolts and all our customers are nuts!\\" It is now called Nut & Bolt House, a private house.

Until around 2010 it was named Compass Pightle, providing a link between Axe and Compass and the use of artisan tools as names and symbols and Sloe Pightle and the now archaic use of the word pightle for a small field or clearing. At the time of the 1851 religious census, the Primitive Methodists were holding Sunday services in a cottage at Burnt Hill, which was not used exclusively for religious worship. It attracted a congregation of forty. The census return for that Sunday was signed by a local preacher, George Merritt, who lived in Burnt Hill and was an agricultural labourer.http://www.myprimitivemethodists.org.uk/page_id__440_path__0p9p72p.aspx In 1864 the Methodist chapel was built and named Zion.

Equal is a brand of artificial sweetener containing aspartame, acesulfame potassium, dextrose and maltodextrin. It is marketed as a tabletop sweetener by Merisant, a global corporation which also used to own the well-known NutraSweet brand when it was a subsidiary of Monsanto and which has headquarters in Chicago, Illinois, Switzerland, Mexico, and Singapore. In French Canada, Equal is known as \\"√âgal\\". History In the early 1980s, Equal and its European counterpart, Canderel, were the first aspartame-based sweeteners to be sold to the public. Originally, the product was to be named Equa. The Chicago advertising agency for G. D. Searle, Tatham, Laird & Kudner, recommended adding an \\"L\\" to the end of the name, to imply its taste is equal to sugar. Products Equal is sold variously as a bottled powder (\\"Equal Spoonful\\"), in blue individual-serving packets, and as a dissolving tablet for use in beverages such as tea and coffee. =Contents= An Equal packet contains dextrose, aspartame (1.7%), acesulfame potassium (1.2%), starch, silicon dioxide (an anti-caking agent), maltodextrin, and unspecified flavouring.Source: Equal packet made in Argentina for sale by Merisant Australia Pty Ltd, January 2007 Equal tablets are not an identical formulation, and their primary ingredient is lactose.Source: Equal tablets made in the Czech Republic by Merisant for sale in the United States, August 2017 Other ingredients are aspartame, acesulfame potassium, cellulose gum, and calcium stearate.

Once left-wing, it has been supportive of that party's successor parties, the Democratic Party of the Left, Democrats of the Left and from October 2007 until its closure the Democratic Party. The newspaper closed on 31 July 2014. It was restarted on 30 June 2015, but it ceased again on 3 June 2017.\\"Chiude L'Unit√†, ultimo numero in Pdf. \\"Cos√¨ si calpesta una storia\\".  History and profile  l'Unit√† was founded by Antonio Gramsci on 12 February 1924 as the \\"newspaper of workers and peasants\\", the official newspaper of the Italian Communist Party (PCI). The paper was printed in Milan with a circulation of 20,000 to 30,000. On 8 November 1925, publications were blocked by the Prefect of the city together with Italian Socialist Party's Avanti!. After an assassination attempt on Benito Mussolini (31 October 1926), its publication was completely suppressed. A clandestine edition was resumed on the first day of 1927 with irregular circulation in Milan, Turin, Rome and in France. Full publication was resumed after the Allied conquest of Rome on 6 June 1944, the new editor-in-chief being Celeste Negarville. After the liberation from the German occupation in 1945, new local editions were started in Milan, Genoa and Turin, the latter edited by philosopher Ludovico Geymonat. Elio Vittorini became the editor-in- chief of l'Unit√† during this period. The newspaper's contributors included Davide Layolo, Luigi Cavallo, Ada Gobetti, Cesare Pavese, Italo Calvino, Alfonso Gatto, Aldo Tortorella and Paolo Spriano. In the same year, the Festa de l'Unit√† was launched in most Italian cities. In 1957, the Genoese, Milanese and Torinese editions were merged into a single edition for northern Italy. The newspaper's editorships were unified in 1962 under Mario Alicata, who was succeeded by Maurizio Ferrara in 1966. In 1974, daily circulation of l'Unit√† amounted to 239,000 copies, but this number dropped considerably starting from early 1980s, mostly from the competition with the new left-oriented La Repubblica: the 100 million copies sold in 1981 decreased to 60 million in 1982. In the subsequent year, a document published by the newspaper which accused the Christian Democratic minister Vincenzo Scotti of being a collaborator of the Camorra leader Raffaele Cutolo proved to be a false. The editor-in-chief Claudio Petruccioli resigned and was replaced by Emanuele Macaluso. Massimo D'Alema, the future Prime Minister of Italy, was managing- director until July 1990. From 1989 to 1990, the newspaper was accompanied by a satirical weekly magazine, Cuore, directed by Michele Serra. In 1991, the title changed from Journal of the Italian Communist Party to Journal founded by Antonio Gramsci. From 1992 to 1996, director was Walter Veltroni, who started periodically accompanying the newspaper with free gifts such as books and videocassettes. The newspaper ceased publication for eight months from 28 July 2000 to 28 March 2001 because of financial troubles. Since then, it was published by Baldini & Castoldi, a company not linked to the Democrats of the Left or Democratic Party. However, its political position continued to be strongly tied to the Democratic Party. On May 2008, Tiscali founder and Sardinia President Renato Soru finalized a deal to become the new newspaper owner. One of the first moves made by the new property was the appointment of former La Repubblica journalist Concita De Gregorio as new editor-in-chief in August 2008, replacing Antonio Padellaro in the post. On 7 May 2012, the paper began to be published in Berliner format. l'Unita again suspended publication on 31 July 2014.\\"Hanno ucciso l'Unit√†\\". . l'Unit√†. 30 July 2014.

The BFGS method belongs to quasi-Newton methods, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seek a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function. For such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero. Newton's method and the BFGS methods are not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum. However, BFGS can have acceptable performance even for non-smooth optimization instances. In Quasi- Newton methods, the Hessian matrix of second derivatives is not computed. Instead, the Hessian matrix is approximated using updates specified by gradient evaluations (or approximate gradient evaluations). Quasi-Newton methods are generalizations of the secant method to find the root of the first derivative for multidimensional problems. In multi-dimensional problems, the secant equation does not specify a unique solution, and quasi-Newton methods differ in how they constrain the solution. The BFGS method is one of the most popular members of this class., page 24 Also in common use is L-BFGS, which is a limited-memory version of BFGS that is particularly suited to problems with very large numbers of variables (e.g., >1000). The BFGS-B variant handles simple box constraints. The algorithm is named after Charles George Broyden, Roger Fletcher, Donald Goldfarb and David Shanno.  Rationale  The optimization problem is to minimize f(\\\\mathbf{x}), where \\\\mathbf{x} is a vector in \\\\mathbb{R}^n, and f is a differentiable scalar function. There are no constraints on the values that \\\\mathbf{x} can take. The algorithm begins at an initial estimate for the optimal value \\\\mathbf{x}_0 and proceeds iteratively to get a better estimate at each stage. The search direction pk at stage k is given by the solution of the analogue of the Newton equation: :B_k \\\\mathbf{p}_k = - abla f(\\\\mathbf{x}_k), where B_k is an approximation to the Hessian matrix, which is updated iteratively at each stage, and abla f(\\\\mathbf{x}_k) is the gradient of the function evaluated at xk. A line search in the direction pk is then used to find the next point xk+1 by minimizing f(\\\\mathbf{x}_k + \\\\gamma\\\\mathbf{p}_k) over the scalar \\\\gamma > 0. The quasi- Newton condition imposed on the update of B_k is :B_{k+1} (\\\\mathbf{x}_{k+1} - \\\\mathbf{x}_k) = abla f(\\\\mathbf{x}_{k+1}) - abla f(\\\\mathbf{x}_k). Let \\\\mathbf{y}_k = abla f(\\\\mathbf{x}_{k+1}) - abla f(\\\\mathbf{x}_k) and \\\\mathbf{s}_k = \\\\mathbf{x}_{k+1} - \\\\mathbf{x}_k, then B_{k+1} satisfies B_{k+1} \\\\mathbf{s}_k = \\\\mathbf{y}_k, which is the secant equation. The curvature condition \\\\mathbf{s}_k^\\\\top \\\\mathbf{y}_k > 0 should be satisfied for B_{k+1} to be positive definite, which can be verified by pre-multiplying the secant equation with \\\\mathbf{s}_k^T. If the function is not strongly convex, then the condition has to be enforced explicitly. Instead of requiring the full Hessian matrix at the point \\\\mathbf{x}_{k+1} to be computed as B_{k+1}, the approximate Hessian at stage k is updated by the addition of two matrices: :B_{k+1} = B_k + U_k + V_k. Both U_k and V_k are symmetric rank-one matrices, but their sum is a rank-two update matrix. BFGS and DFP updating matrix both differ from its predecessor by a rank-two matrix. Another simpler rank-one method is known as symmetric rank-one method, which does not guarantee the positive definiteness. In order to maintain the symmetry and positive definiteness of B_{k+1}, the update form can be chosen as B_{k+1} = B_k + \\\\alpha\\\\mathbf{u}\\\\mathbf{u}^\\\\top + \\\\beta\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\mathbf{v}^\\\\top. Imposing the secant condition, B_{k+1} \\\\mathbf{s}_k = \\\\mathbf{y}_k . Choosing \\\\mathbf{u} = \\\\mathbf{y}_k and \\\\mathbf{v} = B_k \\\\mathbf{s}_k, we can obtain: :\\\\alpha = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathbf{y}_k^T \\\\mathbf{s}_k}, :\\\\beta = -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathbf{s}_k^T B_k \\\\mathbf{s}_k}. Finally, we substitute \\\\alpha and \\\\beta into B_{k+1} = B_k + \\\\alpha\\\\mathbf{u}\\\\mathbf{u}^\\\\top + \\\\beta\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\mathbf{v}^\\\\top and get the update equation of B_{k+1}: :B_{k+1} = B_k + \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{y}_k \\\\mathbf{y}_k^{\\\\mathrm{T}}}{\\\\mathbf{y}_k^{\\\\mathrm{T}} \\\\mathbf{s}_k} - \\\\frac{B_k \\\\mathbf{s}_k \\\\mathbf{s}_k^{\\\\mathrm{T}} B_k^{\\\\mathrm{T}} }{\\\\mathbf{s}_k^{\\\\mathrm{T}} B_k \\\\mathbf{s}_k}.  Algorithm  From an initial guess \\\\mathbf{x}_0 and an approximate Hessian matrix B_0 the following steps are repeated as \\\\mathbf{x}_k converges to the solution: # Obtain a direction \\\\mathbf{p}_k by solving B_k \\\\mathbf{p}_k = - abla f(\\\\mathbf{x}_k). # Perform a one-dimensional optimization (line search) to find an acceptable stepsize \\\\alpha_k in the direction found in the first step, so \\\\alpha_k=\\\\arg \\\\min f(\\\\mathbf{x}_k+\\\\alpha\\\\mathbf{p}_k). # Set \\\\mathbf{s}_k = \\\\alpha_k \\\\mathbf{p}_k and update \\\\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \\\\mathbf{x}_k + \\\\mathbf{s}_k. # \\\\mathbf{y}_k = { abla f(\\\\mathbf{x}_{k+1}) - abla f(\\\\mathbf{x}_k)}. # B_{k+1} = B_k + \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{y}_k \\\\mathbf{y}_k^{\\\\mathrm{T}}}{\\\\mathbf{y}_k^{\\\\mathrm{T}} \\\\mathbf{s}_k} - \\\\frac{B_k \\\\mathbf{s}_k \\\\mathbf{s}_k^{\\\\mathrm{T}} B_k^{\\\\mathrm{T}} }{\\\\mathbf{s}_k^{\\\\mathrm{T}} B_k \\\\mathbf{s}_k}. f(\\\\mathbf{x}) denotes the objective function to be minimized. Convergence can be checked by observing the norm of the gradient,  abla f(\\\\mathbf{x}_k). If B_0is initialized with B_0 = I, the first step will be equivalent to a gradient descent, but further steps are more and more refined by B_{k}, the approximation to the Hessian. The first step of the algorithm is carried out using the inverse of the matrix B_k, which can be obtained efficiently by applying the Sherman‚ÄìMorrison formula to the step 5 of the algorithm, giving : B_{k+1}^{-1} = \\\\left(I - \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{s}_k \\\\mathbf{y}_k^T}{\\\\mathbf{y}_k^T \\\\mathbf{s}_k} \\\\right) B_{k}^{-1} \\\\left(I - \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{y}_k \\\\mathbf{s}_k^T}{\\\\mathbf{y}_k^T \\\\mathbf{s}_k} \\\\right) + \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{s}_k \\\\mathbf{s}_k^T}{\\\\mathbf{y}_k^T \\\\mathbf{s}_k}. This can be computed efficiently without temporary matrices, recognizing that B_k^{-1} is symmetric, and that \\\\mathbf{y}_k^{\\\\mathrm{T}} B_k^{-1} \\\\mathbf{y}_k and \\\\mathbf{s}_k^{\\\\mathrm{T}} \\\\mathbf{y}_k are scalars, using an expansion such as : B_{k+1}^{-1} = B_k^{-1} + \\\\frac{(\\\\mathbf{s}_k^{\\\\mathrm{T}}\\\\mathbf{y}_k+\\\\mathbf{y}_k^{\\\\mathrm{T}} B_k^{-1} \\\\mathbf{y}_k)(\\\\mathbf{s}_k \\\\mathbf{s}_k^{\\\\mathrm{T}})}{(\\\\mathbf{s}_k^{\\\\mathrm{T}} \\\\mathbf{y}_k)^2} - \\\\frac{B_k^{-1} \\\\mathbf{y}_k \\\\mathbf{s}_k^{\\\\mathrm{T}} + \\\\mathbf{s}_k \\\\mathbf{y}_k^{\\\\mathrm{T}}B_k^{-1}}{\\\\mathbf{s}_k^{\\\\mathrm{T}} \\\\mathbf{y}_k}. In statistical estimation problems (such as maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference), credible intervals or confidence intervals for the solution can be estimated from the inverse of the final Hessian matrix. However, these quantities are technically defined by the true Hessian matrix, and the BFGS approximation may not converge to the true Hessian matrix.

Kept by Museum of Prehistory and Early History (Berlin) The Negau helmets are 26 bronze helmets (23 of which are preserved) dating to c. 450 BC‚Äì350 BC, found in 1812 in a cache in ≈Ωenjak, near Negau, Duchy of Styria (now Negova, Slovenia). The helmets are of typical Etruscan 'vetulonic' shape, sometimes described as of the Negau type. They were buried in c. 50 BC, shortly before the Roman invasion of the area. Helmets of the Negau type were typically worn by priests at the time of deposition of these helmets, so they seem to have been left at the ≈Ωenjak site for ceremonial reasons. The village of ≈Ωenjak was of great interest to German archaeologists during the Nazi period and was briefly renamed Harigast during World War II. The site has never been excavated properly. Inscriptions On one of the helmets (\\"Negau B\\"), there is an inscription in a northern Etruscan alphabet. The inscription need not date to c. 400 BC, but was possibly added by a later owner in c. 2nd century BC or later. It is read as: : :harikastiteiva\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ip, Many interpretations of the inscription have been proffered in the past, but the most recent interpretation is by T.L. Markey (2001), who reads the inscription as 'Harigast the priest' (from *teiwaz \\"god\\"), as another inscribed helmet also found at the site bears several names (mostly Celtic) followed by religious titles. In any case, the Germanic name Harigast is almost universally read. Formerly, some scholars have seen the inscription as an early incarnation of the runic alphabet, but it is now accepted that the script is North Etruscan proper, and precedes the formation of the Runic alphabet. Harigast constitutes an attestation of the Germanic sound shift, probably the earliest preserved, preceding Tacitus perhaps by some two centuries. Must (1957) reads Hariœáas Titieva as a Raetic personal name, the first element from the Indo-European (Venetic rather than Germanic), the second from the Etruscan. The four discrete inscriptions on the helmet usually called \\"Negau A\\" are read by Markey as: Dubni banuabi 'of Dubnos the pig- slayer'; sirago turbi 'astral priest of the troop'; Iars'e esvii 'Iarsus the divine'; and Kerup, probably an abbreviation for a Celtic name like Cerubogios.

Two buildings suffered direct hits from the twister, and more than 90 cars in the parking lots were damaged and destroyed. There were only minor injuries on campus. The Hal Reed Ramer Administration Building received major damage, including damage to the office of the President. Noble Caudill Hall suffered perhaps the worst damage, as much of the second floor on the south side of the building collapsed, and a large section of roofing above WVCP radio and the Wemyss Auditorium was ripped off and/or collapsed inward. Caudill Hall closed for more than a year and a half until repairs were completed. In all, eleven classrooms had to be relocated due to damage and 72 faculty and staff offices were moved. Volunteer State building coordinators and campus safety staff have been credited with helping to save lives on the day the tornado hit. They were honored in a ceremony at the school. By spring of 2007, the Ramer building was fully occupied again, including a new home for the student radio station. The Caudill Building re-opened for classes on January 12, 2008. A major landscaping project was finished in spring 2008 marking the end of tornado repair. Administration *Dr. Hal R.

Franciszek Smuglewicz (; 6 October 1745 - 18 September 1807) was a Polish-Lithuanian draughtsman and painter. Smuglewicz is considered a progenitor of Lithuanian art in the modern era. He was precursor of historicism in Polish painting. He was also a founder of Vilnius school of art, his most prominent students were Jan Rustem, Jan Krzysztof Damel, Gaspar Borowski and J√≥zef Oleszkiewicz. His father ≈Åukasz Smuglewicz and brother Antoni were also painters. Biography Franciszek Smuglewicz was born in Warsaw as son of ≈Åukasz Smuglewicz, who was also a painter, and Regina Olesi≈Ñska. His mother, Regina Olesi≈Ñska, was the niece of painter Szymon CzechowiczMariusz Karpowicz. \\"Krakowskie obrazy Szymona Czechowicza\\". Rocznik Krakowski. Vol. 56 (1990). p. 131Edward Rastawiecki.

He made his first steps as a painter in his father and Czechowicz joint workshop in Warsaw. In 1763 Franciszek journeyed to Rome, where he began the study of fine arts under the tutorship of Anton von Maron. He stayed in Rome for 21 years, where he embraced the Neo-Classical style. In 1765 he received a royal scholarship from the King of Poland Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski and was admitted into the Saint Lucas Academy. As a colleague of Vincenzo Brenna he participated in cataloging artifacts from Nero's Domus Aurea. In 1784 he returned to Warsaw, where he founded his own school of fine arts, one of the predecessors of the modern Academy of Fine Arts. A classicist, but under strong influence of the Polish baroque, Smuglewicz became a notable representative of historical paintings, a genre that dominated the fine arts of Poland throughout the 19th century. Around 1790 he started working on a series of sketches and lithographies inspired by Adam Naruszewicz's History of the Polish Nation. Although never finished, this series gained him much popularity. In 1797 he moved to Vilnius, where he became the founder and the first deacon of the Institute of Sketch and Painting at the Academy of Vilnius. In 1801 he painted allegorical ceiling paintings for Tsar Paul I at his new imperial palace, the Mikhailovsky Castle, in St Petersburg, which was also designed by Brenna.August von Kotzebue, The Most Remarkable Year in the Life of Augustus von Kotzebue, London,(1802). Vol III, pp. 60, 68 and 80. A tutor of generations of Polish-Lithuanian painters, Smuglewicz devoted himself to historical paintings in the latter years of his life. He brought to Lithuania classical ideas and views of enlightened classicism. He painted everyday life, and the architecture of Vilnius in a realistic manner. His works helped with the ongoing reconstruction of the Royal Palace of Lithuania in Vilnius. Among the notable surviving works of that period are A Meeting of the Four Years' Sejm (1793) and Ko≈õciuszko's Oath at Krak√≥w's Old Town Market (1797), Lithuanian Peasants, Freeing Peasants from Serfdom in Merkinƒó. Among his works of the period are views of the city walls and city gates that were demolished during the 19th century. He was buried in Vilnius at Rasos Cemetery (Polish: Cmentarz na Rossie), although the exact location is not known.

Pariente is the second woman to hold the position of chief justice and served on the court from 1997 to 2019. From 1993 to 1997 she was a judge on Florida's Fourth District Court of Appeal. Early life and education Pariente was born in New York City in 1948. She attended public schools in New York and lived in Tenafly, New Jersey, where she graduated from Tenafly High School in 1966.Coutros, Evonne. \\"Ex-Tenafly Classmates Give Justice High Marks\\", The Record (Bergen County), November 21, 2000, backed up by the Internet Archive as of November 4, 2012.

Pariente later attended the George Washington University Law School, receiving her law degree in 1973, graduating fifth in her class, and was elected a member of the Order of the Coif. Clerkship and private practice In 1973, Pariente moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida for a two-year clerkship under Judge Norman C. Roettger, Jr. of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. After finishing her clerkship in 1975, Pariente moved to West Palm Beach and joined the civil law firm of Cone, Wagner and Nugent, becoming a partner in 1977. In 1983, Pariente formed the law firm of Pariente & Silber. During Pariente's 18 years in private practice, she was active in the Florida Bar--serving on the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit Grievance Committee, Florida Bar Civil Rules Committee, and Fifteenth Judicial Circuit Nominating Commission--and organized Palm Beach County's first Bench-Bar Conference. Pariente also was a founding member and master of the Palm Beach County chapter of the American Inns of Court and was a longtime member of the board of directors of the Palm Beach County chapter of the Legal Aid Society. Service on the Fourth District Court of Appeal and Florida Supreme Court In September 1993, Pariente was appointed to Florida's Fourth District Court of Appeal by Governor Lawton Chiles(D). She served on the district appellate court until December 10, 1997, when Chiles appointed her a justice of the Florida Supreme Court. During Pariente's term on the court, she had worked to reform the family law system in Florida and served as liaison and later the chair of the Supreme Court's Steering Committee on Families and Children in the Courts. Pariente was also a member of the Governor's Advisory Committee on Character Education (1999) and the Florida Bar's Commission on the Legal Needs of Children (2000‚Äì2002). In March 2003, Pariente was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a radical double mastectomy and a full course of chemotherapy. During her treatment, she was noted for never missing an oral argument or judicial conference. Her decision after treatment to sit on the bench without wearing a wig during televised court proceedings was widely hailed as a breakthrough for other women in treatment. Florida Supreme Court Building Pariente was the author of the 2004 decision in Jeb Bush v. Michael Schiavo, which ruled unconstitutional a law passed by the Republican-controlled Florida Legislature authorizing Governor Jeb Bush to intervene in the Terri Schiavo case. In January 2006, Pariente authored a decision in Jeb Bush v. Ruth Holmes, ruling one of Florida's three school voucher programs unconstitutional. As a result, some Republican legislators pledged to campaign against Pariente in November, when she faced a routine merit retention vote. While no organized campaign against Pariente's retention resulted, no Florida judge has ever been removed from office as a result of organized campaigns. In the 2006 general election, Pariente won retention by receiving 67.6% of the vote. She won retention again in 2012 by a similar margin, despite organized opposition from several groups and the state Republican Party.

Hudson (1794-1862). Hudson (DD-475) was launched 3 June 1942 by the Boston Navy Yard; sponsored by Mrs. Henry H. Hough, wife of Admiral Henry H. Hough (Ret.); and commissioned 13 April 1943, Commander Richard R. Pratt in command. History After shakedown and escort duty along the Atlantic coast, Hudson sailed for Efate, New Hebrides, where she was just in time to provide fire support for the initial landings on Bougainville 1 November. As the Japanese staged a heavy air attack 8 November, Hudson helped repel them by splashing two \\"bogies\\" and assisting on a third. She then made antishipping sweeps in the Truk area and participated in operations against the Green Islands 1 February 1944. En route to the invasion, Hudson attacked and sank a Japanese submarine on 31 January. Following a brief respite in Australia, Hudson steamed to Kwajalein to join the armada readying for the invasion of the Marianas. After delivering shore bombardment to clear the way for landings on Saipan, Guam, and Tinian, the destroyer took part in the Battle of the Philippine Sea on 19 June. She contributed two kills to the massive destruction of Japanese planes later known as \\"The Marianas Turkey Shoot\\". In mid-July, as the invasion of Guam was launched, Hudson steamed off the island to screen transports and shot down another enemy aircraft, as well as rescuing three downed Navy pilots and a Japanese flier. From the Marianas, Hudson steamed to Palau to support landings on Peleliu and Angaur from 12-25 September. Departing Manus in the Admiralty Islands on 4 October, she reached San Francisco 2 weeks later for overhaul. After refresher training at Pearl Harbor, Hudson returned to action, arriving off Iwo Jima on 19 February 1945. she provided vital radar picket protection during the initial invasion of the enemy stronghold. While returning from Iwo Jima after the island was secured, Hudson rescued eight survivors of a B-29 Superfortress which had crashed at sea on 8 March. Her next action came as a radar picket ship off Okinawa on 1 April, when American troops stormed the last Japanese stronghold before the home islands. On 5 April the Hudson gained credit for her second Japanese submarine, when a 6-hour attack with six barrages of depth charges resulted in the sinking of the RO-49 off Okinawa. Although under almost constant attack by kamikaze aircraft, Hudson suffered only one injury to a crewman, inflicted when a kamikaze crashed nearby on 22 April 1945, a wingtip clipping a chief on the head. Also off Okinawa, Hudson became known as the \\"destroyer that saved a carrier\\". On 4 May a kamikaze pilot crashed into the escort carrier Sangamon (CVE-26). Hudson steered for the fiercely blazing carrier. Despite the exploding ammunition on the drifting carrier, the destroyer was able to go alongside three times, getting a total of 16 hoses over the side. The overhanging flight deck of the carrier caused extensive damage to Hudson's superstructure as burning debris and a flaming plane jettisoned by Sangamons crew crashed into Hudsons depth charges on the fantail, causing some damage. When the fires were finally under control, Hudson had suffered damage equal to that of the kamikaze plane's victim, though the carrier had been saved with only a small loss of life and was ordered to Guam for repairs on 10 May. Fate Promptly repaired, Hudson joined the 3rd Fleet off Okinawa 22 June and then proceeded to Eniwetok for convoy duty in the Marshalls. After escorting a convoy to the Aleutians, she returned to Northern Japan to take part in the occupation and control of the enemy home islands 8 September, 6 days after the signing of unconditional surrender in Tokyo Bay. From Japan, Hudson sailed to Alaska where she began carrying veterans back to the States in Operation Magic Carpet. She then put in at the Puget Sound Navy Yard, Bremerton, Wash., to prepare to decommission. Sailing to San Diego 15 March 1946, Hudson decommissioned and went into reserve there 31 May. In January 1947 Hudson was moved to Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Calif, where she was put into mothballs. Hudson was stricken 1 December 1972, sold 27 November 1973 and broken up for scrap. Honors Hudson received nine battle stars for World War II service.

The center of this circle is called the circumcenter and its radius is called the circumradius. Not every polygon has a circumscribed circle. A polygon that does have one is called a cyclic polygon, or sometimes a concyclic polygon because its vertices are concyclic. All triangles, all regular simple polygons, all rectangles, all isosceles trapezoids, and all right kites are cyclic. A related notion is the one of a minimum bounding circle, which is the smallest circle that completely contains the polygon within it, if the circle's center is within the polygon. Every polygon has a unique minimum bounding circle, which may be constructed by a linear time algorithm. Even if a polygon has a circumscribed circle, it may be different from its minimum bounding circle. For example, for an obtuse triangle, the minimum bounding circle has the longest side as diameter and does not pass through the opposite vertex. Triangles All triangles are cyclic; that is, every triangle has a circumscribed circle. =Straightedge and compass construction= Construction of the circumcircle (red) and the circumcenter Q (red dot) The circumcenter of a triangle can be constructed by drawing any two of the three perpendicular bisectors. For three non- collinear points, these two lines cannot be parallel, and the circumcenter is the point where they cross. Any point on the bisector is equidistant from the two points that it bisects, from which it follows that this point, on both bisectors, is equidistant from all three triangle vertices. The circumradius is the distance from it to any of the three vertices. =Alternative construction= Alternate construction of the circumcenter (intersection of broken lines) An alternative method to determine the circumcenter is to draw any two lines each one departing from one of the vertices at an angle with the common side, the common angle of departure being 90¬∞ minus the angle of the opposite vertex. (In the case of the opposite angle being obtuse, drawing a line at a negative angle means going outside the triangle.) In coastal navigation, a triangle's circumcircle is sometimes used as a way of obtaining a position line using a sextant when no compass is available. The horizontal angle between two landmarks defines the circumcircle upon which the observer lies. =Circumcircle equations= Cartesian coordinates In the Euclidean plane, it is possible to give explicitly an equation of the circumcircle in terms of the Cartesian coordinates of the vertices of the inscribed triangle. Suppose that :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{A} &= (A_x, A_y) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{B} &= (B_x, B_y) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{C} &= (C_x, C_y) \\\\end{align} are the coordinates of points A, B, and C. The circumcircle is then the locus of points v = (vx,vy) in the Cartesian plane satisfying the equations :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{v} - \\\\mathbf{u}^2 &= r^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{A} - \\\\mathbf{u}^2 &= r^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{B} - \\\\mathbf{u}^2 &= r^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{C} - \\\\mathbf{u}^2 &= r^2 \\\\end{align} guaranteeing that the points A, B, C, and v are all the same distance r from the common center u of the circle. Using the polarization identity, these equations reduce to the condition that the matrix :\\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{v}^2 & -2v_x & -2v_y & -1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{A}^2 & -2A_x & -2A_y & -1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{B}^2 & -2B_x & -2B_y & -1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{C}^2 & -2C_x & -2C_y & -1 \\\\end{bmatrix} has a nonzero kernel. Thus the circumcircle may alternatively be described as the locus of zeros of the determinant of this matrix: :\\\\det\\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{v}^2 & v_x & v_y & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{A}^2 & A_x & A_y & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{B}^2 & B_x & B_y & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{C}^2 & C_x & C_y & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}=0. Using cofactor expansion, let :\\\\begin{align} S_x &= \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\det\\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{A}^2 & A_y & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{B}^2 & B_y & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{C}^2 & C_y & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] S_y &= \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\det\\\\begin{bmatrix} A_x & \\\\mathbf{A}^2 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ B_x & \\\\mathbf{B}^2 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ C_x & \\\\mathbf{C}^2 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] a &= \\\\det\\\\begin{bmatrix} A_x & A_y & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ B_x & B_y & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ C_x & C_y & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] b &= \\\\det\\\\begin{bmatrix} A_x & A_y & \\\\mathbf{A}^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ B_x & B_y & \\\\mathbf{B}^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ C_x & C_y & \\\\mathbf{C}^2 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\end{align} we then have av2 ‚àí 2Sv ‚àí b = 0 and, assuming the three points were not in a line (otherwise the circumcircle is that line that can also be seen as a generalized circle with S at infinity), , giving the circumcenter S/a and the circumradius . A similar approach allows one to deduce the equation of the circumsphere of a tetrahedron. Parametric equation A unit vector perpendicular to the plane containing the circle is given by : \\\\widehat{n} = \\\\frac{(P_2 - P_1) \\\\times (P_3 - P_1)}{ (P_2 - P_1) \\\\times (P_3 - P_1)}. Hence, given the radius, r, center, Pc, a point on the circle, P0 and a unit normal of the plane containing the circle, \\\\widehat{n}, one parametric equation of the circle starting from the point P0 and proceeding in a positively oriented (i.e., right-handed) sense about \\\\scriptstyle{\\\\widehat{n}} is the following: :\\\\mathrm{R} (s) = \\\\mathrm{P_c} + \\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{s}}{\\\\mathrm{r}}\\\\right) (P_0 - P_c) + \\\\sin\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{s}}{\\\\mathrm{r}}\\\\right) \\\\left[\\\\widehat{n} \\\\times(P_0 - P_c)\\\\right]. Trilinear and barycentric coordinates An equation for the circumcircle in trilinear coordinates x : y : z is . An equation for the circumcircle in barycentric coordinates x : y : z is . The isogonal conjugate of the circumcircle is the line at infinity, given in trilinear coordinates by and in barycentric coordinates by . Higher dimensions Additionally, the circumcircle of a triangle embedded in d dimensions can be found using a generalized method. Let A, B, and C be d-dimensional points, which form the vertices of a triangle. We start by transposing the system to place C at the origin: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{a} &= \\\\mathbf{A}-\\\\mathbf{C}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b} &= \\\\mathbf{B}-\\\\mathbf{C}. \\\\end{align} The circumradius, r, is then :r = \\\\frac {\\\\left\\\\\\\\mathbf{a}\\\\right\\\\\\\\left\\\\\\\\mathbf{b}\\\\right\\\\\\\\left\\\\\\\\mathbf{a} - \\\\mathbf{b}\\\\right\\\\} {2 \\\\left\\\\\\\\mathbf{a}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{b}\\\\right\\\\} = \\\\frac{\\\\left\\\\\\\\mathbf{a} - \\\\mathbf{b}\\\\right\\\\}{2 \\\\sin\\\\theta} = \\\\frac{\\\\left\\\\\\\\mathbf{A} - \\\\mathbf{B}\\\\right\\\\}{2 \\\\sin\\\\theta}, where Œ∏ is the interior angle between a and b. The circumcenter, p0, is given by :p_0 = \\\\frac{(\\\\left\\\\\\\\mathbf{a}\\\\right\\\\^2\\\\mathbf{b} - \\\\left\\\\\\\\mathbf{b}\\\\right\\\\^2\\\\mathbf{a}) \\\\times (\\\\mathbf{a} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{b})} {2 \\\\left\\\\\\\\mathbf{a}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{b}\\\\right\\\\^2} + \\\\mathbf{C}. This formula only works in three dimensions as the cross product is not defined in other dimensions, but it can be generalized to the other dimensions by replacing the cross products with following identities: :\\\\begin{align} (\\\\mathbf{a}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{b})\\\\times\\\\mathbf{c} &= (\\\\mathbf{a} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{c})\\\\mathbf{b} - (\\\\mathbf{b} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{c})\\\\mathbf{a}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{a}\\\\times(\\\\mathbf{b}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{c}) &= (\\\\mathbf{a} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{c})\\\\mathbf{b} - (\\\\mathbf{a} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{b})\\\\mathbf{c}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left\\\\\\\\mathbf{a}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{b}\\\\right\\\\ &= \\\\sqrt{\\\\left\\\\\\\\mathbf{a}\\\\right\\\\^2\\\\left\\\\\\\\mathbf{b}\\\\right\\\\^2 - (\\\\mathbf{a} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{b})^2}. \\\\end{align} =Circumcenter coordinates= Cartesian coordinates The Cartesian coordinates of the circumcenter U = \\\\left(U_x, U_y\\\\right) are :\\\\begin{align} U_x &= \\\\frac{1}{D}\\\\left[(A_x^2 + A_y^2)(B_y - C_y) + (B_x^2 + B_y^2)(C_y - A_y) + (C_x^2 + C_y^2)(A_y - B_y)\\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] U_y &= \\\\frac{1}{D}\\\\left[(A_x^2 + A_y^2)(C_x - B_x) + (B_x^2 + B_y^2)(A_x - C_x) + (C_x^2 + C_y^2)(B_x - A_x)\\\\right] \\\\end{align} with :D = 2\\\\left[A_x(B_y - C_y) + B_x(C_y - A_y) + C_x(A_y - B_y)\\\\right].\\\\, Without loss of generality this can be expressed in a simplified form after translation of the vertex A to the origin of the Cartesian coordinate systems, i.e., when . In this case, the coordinates of the vertices and represent the vectors from vertex A‚Ä≤ to these vertices. Observe that this trivial translation is possible for all triangles and the circumcenter U' = (U'_x, U'_y) of the triangle A‚Ä≤B‚Ä≤C‚Ä≤ follow as :\\\\begin{align} U'_x &= \\\\frac{1}{D'}\\\\left[C'_y({B'_x}^2 + {B'_y}^2) - B'_y({C'_x}^2 + {C'_y}^2)\\\\right], \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] U'_y &= \\\\frac{1}{D'}\\\\left[B'_x({C'_x}^2 + {C'_y}^2) - C'_x({B'_x}^2 + {B'_y}^2)\\\\right] \\\\end{align} with :D' = 2(B'_x C'_y - B'_y C'_x). \\\\, Due to the translation of vertex A to the origin, the circumradius r can be computed as :r = \\\\U'\\\\ = \\\\sqrt{{U'_x}^2 + {U'_y}^2} and the actual circumcenter of ABC follows as :U = U' + A Trilinear coordinates The circumcenter has trilinear coordinates : where are the angles of the triangle. In terms of the side lengths a, b, c, the trilinears are :a\\\\left(b^2 + c^2 - a^2\\\\right) : b\\\\left(c^2 + a^2 - b^2\\\\right) : c\\\\left(a^2 + b^2 - c^2\\\\right). Barycentric coordinates The circumcenter has barycentric coordinates : a^2\\\\left(b^2 + c^2 - a^2\\\\right):\\\\; b^2\\\\left(c^2 + a^2 - b^2\\\\right):\\\\; c^2\\\\left(a^2 + b^2 - c^2\\\\right),\\\\, where are edge lengths ( respectively) of the triangle. In terms of the triangle's angles \\\\alpha, \\\\beta, \\\\gamma, the barycentric coordinates of the circumcenter are The circumcenter is listed under X(3). :\\\\sin 2\\\\alpha :\\\\sin 2\\\\beta :\\\\sin 2\\\\gamma . Circumcenter vector Since the Cartesian coordinates of any point are a weighted average of those of the vertices, with the weights being the point's barycentric coordinates normalized to sum to unity, the circumcenter vector can be written as :U = \\\\frac {a^2\\\\left(b^2 + c^2 - a^2\\\\right)A + b^2\\\\left(c^2 + a^2 - b^2\\\\right)B + c^2\\\\left(a^2 + b^2 - c^2\\\\right)C} {a^2\\\\left(b^2 + c^2 - a^2\\\\right) + b^2\\\\left(c^2 + a^2 - b^2\\\\right) + c^2\\\\left(a^2 + b^2 - c^2\\\\right)}. Here U is the vector of the circumcenter and A, B, C are the vertex vectors. The divisor here equals 16S 2 where S is the area of the triangle.

Using Cartesian coordinates to represent these points as spatial vectors, it is possible to use the dot product and cross product to calculate the radius and center of the circle. Let : \\\\mathrm{P_1} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ y_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ z_1 \\\\end{bmatrix}, \\\\mathrm{P_2} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} x_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ y_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ z_2 \\\\end{bmatrix}, \\\\mathrm{P_3} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} x_3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ y_3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ z_3 \\\\end{bmatrix} Then the radius of the circle is given by :\\\\mathrm{r} = \\\\frac {\\\\leftP_1 - P_2\\\\right \\\\leftP_2 - P_3\\\\right\\\\leftP_3 - P_1\\\\right} {2 \\\\left\\\\left(P_1 - P_2\\\\right) \\\\times \\\\left(P_2 - P_3\\\\right)\\\\right} The center of the circle is given by the linear combination :\\\\mathrm{P_c} = \\\\alpha \\\\, P_1 + \\\\beta \\\\, P_2 + \\\\gamma \\\\, P_3 where :\\\\begin{align} \\\\alpha = \\\\frac {\\\\leftP_2 - P_3\\\\right^2 \\\\left(P_1 - P_2\\\\right) \\\\cdot \\\\left(P_1 - P_3\\\\right)} {2 \\\\left\\\\left(P_1 - P_2\\\\right) \\\\times \\\\left(P_2 - P_3\\\\right)\\\\right^2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\beta = \\\\frac {\\\\leftP_1 - P_3\\\\right^2 \\\\left(P_2 - P_1\\\\right) \\\\cdot \\\\left(P_2 - P_3\\\\right)} {2 \\\\left\\\\left(P_1 - P_2\\\\right) \\\\times \\\\left(P_2 - P_3\\\\right)\\\\right^2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\gamma = \\\\frac {\\\\leftP_1 - P_2\\\\right^2 \\\\left(P_3 - P_1\\\\right) \\\\cdot \\\\left(P_3 - P_2\\\\right)} {2 \\\\left\\\\left(P_1 - P_2\\\\right) \\\\times \\\\left(P_2 - P_3\\\\right)\\\\right^2} \\\\end{align} Location relative to the triangle The circumcenter's position depends on the type of triangle: *For an acute triangle (all angles smaller than a right angle), the circumcenter always lies inside the triangle. *For a right triangle, the circumcenter always lies at the midpoint of the hypotenuse. This is one form of Thales' theorem. *For an obtuse triangle (a triangle with one angle bigger than a right angle), the circumcenter always lies outside the triangle. These locational features can be seen by considering the trilinear or barycentric coordinates given above for the circumcenter: all three coordinates are positive for any interior point, at least one coordinate is negative for any exterior point, and one coordinate is zero and two are positive for a non- vertex point on a side of the triangle. =Angles= The angles which the circumscribed circle forms with the sides of the triangle coincide with angles at which sides meet each other. The side opposite angle Œ± meets the circle twice: once at each end; in each case at angle Œ± (similarly for the other two angles). This is due to the alternate segment theorem, which states that the angle between the tangent and chord equals the angle in the alternate segment. =Triangle centers on the circumcircle of triangle ABC= In this section, the vertex angles are labeled A, B, C and all coordinates are trilinear coordinates: *Steiner point = bc / (b2 ‚àí c2) : ca / (c2 ‚àí a2) : ab / (a2 ‚àí b2) = the nonvertex point of intersection of the circumcircle with the Steiner ellipse. (The Steiner ellipse, with center = centroid (ABC), is the ellipse of least area that passes through A, B, and C. An equation for this ellipse is .) *Tarry point = sec (A + œâ) : sec (B + œâ) : sec (C + œâ) = antipode of the Steiner point *Focus of the Kiepert parabola = csc (B ‚àí C) : csc (C ‚àí A) : csc (A ‚àí B). =Other properties= The diameter of the circumcircle, called the circumdiameter and equal to twice the circumradius, can be computed as the length of any side of the triangle divided by the sine of the opposite angle: :\\\\text{diameter} = \\\\frac{a}{\\\\sin A} = \\\\frac{b}{\\\\sin B} = \\\\frac{c}{\\\\sin C}. As a consequence of the law of sines, it does not matter which side and opposite angle are taken: the result will be the same. The diameter of the circumcircle can also be expressed as :\\\\begin{align} \\\\text{diameter} & {}= \\\\frac{abc}{2\\\\cdot\\\\text{area}} = \\\\frac{AB BC CA}{2\\\\Delta ABC} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] & {}= \\\\frac{abc}{2\\\\sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)}}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] & {}= \\\\frac{2abc}{\\\\sqrt{(a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c)}} \\\\end{align} where a, b, c are the lengths of the sides of the triangle and is the semiperimeter. The expression \\\\sqrt{\\\\scriptstyle{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}} above is the area of the triangle, by Heron's formula. Trigonometric expressions for the diameter of the circumcircle include :\\\\text{diameter} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2 \\\\cdot \\\\text{area}}{\\\\sin A \\\\sin B \\\\sin C}}. The triangle's nine-point circle has half the diameter of the circumcircle. In any given triangle, the circumcenter is always collinear with the centroid and orthocenter. The line that passes through all of them is known as the Euler line. The isogonal conjugate of the circumcenter is the orthocenter. The useful minimum bounding circle of three points is defined either by the circumcircle (where three points are on the minimum bounding circle) or by the two points of the longest side of the triangle (where the two points define a diameter of the circle). It is common to confuse the minimum bounding circle with the circumcircle. The circumcircle of three collinear points is the line on which the three points lie, often referred to as a circle of infinite radius. Nearly collinear points often lead to numerical instability in computation of the circumcircle. Circumcircles of triangles have an intimate relationship with the Delaunay triangulation of a set of points. By Euler's theorem in geometry, the distance between the circumcenter O and the incenter I is :OI = \\\\sqrt{R(R - 2r)}, where r is the incircle radius and R is the circumcircle radius; hence the circumradius is at least twice the inradius (Euler's triangle inequality), with equality only in the equilateral case.Nelson, Roger, \\"Euler's triangle inequality via proof without words,\\" Mathematics Magazine 81(1), February 2008, 58-61. See in particular p. 198. The distance between O and the orthocenter H is See in particular p. 449. :OH = \\\\sqrt{R^2 - 8R^2\\\\cos A \\\\cos B \\\\cos C} = \\\\sqrt{9R^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)}. For centroid G and nine-point center N we have :\\\\begin{align} IG &< IO, \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2IN &< IO, \\\\\\\\\\\\ OI^2 &= 2R\\\\cdot IN. \\\\end{align} The product of the incircle radius and the circumcircle radius of a triangle with sides a, b, and c is Republished by Dover Publications as Advanced Euclidean Geometry, 1960 and 2007. :rR = \\\\frac{abc}{2(a + b + c)}. With circumradius R, sides a, b, c, and medians ma, mb, and mc, we have :\\\\begin{align} 3\\\\sqrt{3}R &\\\\geq a + b + c \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] 9R^2 &\\\\geq a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] \\\\frac{27}{4}R^2 &\\\\geq m_a^2 + m_b^2 + m_c^2. \\\\end{align} If median m, altitude h, and internal bisector t all emanate from the same vertex of a triangle with circumradius R, then Reprinted by Dover Publications, 2007. :4R^2 h^2(t^2 - h^2) = t^4(m^2 - h^2). Carnot's theorem states that the sum of the distances from the circumcenter to the three sides equals the sum of the circumradius and the inradius. Here a segment's length is considered to be negative if and only if the segment lies entirely outside the triangle. If a triangle has two particular circles as its circumcircle and incircle, there exist an infinite number of other triangles with the same circumcircle and incircle, with any point on the circumcircle as a vertex. (This is the n = 3 case of Poncelet's porism). A necessary and sufficient condition for such triangles to exist is the above equality OI=\\\\sqrt{R(R-2r)}. Cyclic quadrilaterals Cyclic quadrilaterals Quadrilaterals that can be circumscribed have particular properties including the fact that opposite angles are supplementary angles (adding up to 180¬∞ or œÄ radians). Cyclic n-gons For a cyclic polygon with an odd number of sides, all angles are equal if and only if the polygon is regular. A cyclic polygon with an even number of sides has all angles equal if and only if the alternate sides are equal (that is, sides 1, 3, 5, ... are equal, and sides 2, 4, 6, ... are equal). A cyclic pentagon with rational sides and area is known as a Robbins pentagon; in all known cases, its diagonals also have rational lengths. In any cyclic n-gon with even n, the sum of one set of alternate angles (the first, third, fifth, etc.) equals the sum of the other set of alternate angles. This can be proven by induction from the n=4 case, in each case replacing a side with three more sides and noting that these three new sides together with the old side form a quadrilateral which itself has this property; the alternate angles of the latter quadrilateral represent the additions to the alternate angle sums of the previous n-gon. Let one n-gon be inscribed in a circle, and let another n-gon be tangential to that circle at the vertices of the first n-gon. Then from any point P on the circle, the product of the perpendicular distances from P to the sides of the first n-gon equals the product of the perpendicular distances from P to the sides of the second n-gon. =Point on the circumcircle= Let a cyclic n-gon have vertices A1 , ..., An on the unit circle. Then for any point M on the minor arc A1An, the distances from M to the vertices satisfy :\\\\begin{cases} MA_1 + MA_3 + \\\\cdots + MA_{n-2} + MA_n < n/\\\\sqrt{2} & \\\\text{if } n \\\\text{ is odd}; \\\\\\\\\\\\ MA_1 + MA_3 + \\\\cdots + MA_{n-3} + MA_{n-1} \\\\leq n/\\\\sqrt{2} & \\\\text{if } n \\\\text{ is even}. \\\\end{cases} =Polygon circumscribing constant= A sequence of circumscribed polygons and circles. Any regular polygon is cyclic. Consider a unit circle, then circumscribe a regular triangle such that each side touches the circle. Circumscribe a circle, then circumscribe a square. Again circumscribe a circle, then circumscribe a regular 5-gon, and so on. The radii of the circumscribed circles converge to the so-called polygon circumscribing constant :\\\\prod_{n=3}^\\\\infty \\\\frac 1 {\\\\cos\\\\left( \\\\frac\\\\pi n \\\\right)} = 8.7000366\\\\ldots. . The reciprocal of this constant is the Kepler‚ÄìBouwkamp constant.

It is operated by the Tennessee Board of Regents. Like most community colleges, emphasis is on associate's degree-level classes, but it also offers some third- and fourth-year college-level courses as well, through arrangements with other institutions.  History  The Tennessee Board of Education authorized the establishment of one of the first three community colleges in Tennessee on June 22, 1965. The name Cleveland State Community College was chosen by the board of education on February 11, 1966. Bids for the first five campus building were announced on July 20, 1966, and the school's campus broke ground on September 11, 1966. David F. Adkisson was named the first president on January 1, 1967. Approximately 700 students enrolled for the school's first classes which began on October 2, 1967 and took place at North Cleveland Baptist Church, due to a delay in the completion of the campus. At this time offices were held at 685 Broad Street N.W. in Downtown Cleveland. The move to the current campus and permanent facilities took place on January 3, 1968. At this time, the campus consisted of the Administration Building, Library, Science Building, Student Center, and Gymnasium. The official dedication ceremonies for the college took place on April 29, 1968. The first graduation ceremonies were conducted on June 1, 1969.  Campus  The sits on the eastern foot of Candies Creek Ridge in northern Cleveland near Interstate 75. The campus has 10 major buildings housing modern classrooms, laboratories, and student activity centers. Additional features include a library, a multi-media center of emphasis, computer laboratories, a 400-seat theatre, a 3,000-seat gymnasium, athletic fields and tennis courts, a large reflector telescope, and a satellite downlink receiver which enables the college to serve as a site for many teleconferences. Cleveland State offers classes throughout the service area in southeast Tennessee, which includes Bradley, Meigs, McMinn, Monroe, and Polk counties. The college also has offices and classrooms in Athens and Madisonville.  Organization and administration  Cleveland State Community college operates within the governance of the Tennessee Board of Regents. Dr. David F. Adkisson served as founding president of Cleveland State Community College from 1967 to 1978. Dr. L. Quentin Lane was appointed to the presidency in 1978 and served until 1985. A. Ray Coleman served briefly as interim president in 1985. Dr. James W. Ford was then appointed as president of Cleveland State from 1985 to 1992. Dr. Renate G. Basham served as interim president from 1992 to 1996. Dr. Carl M. Hite served as president from 1996 until 2013. The current president is Dr. William A. Seymour, who was hired in 2014.  Academic profile  Approximately 3,700 credit students and 1,300 non-credit students enroll in Cleveland State Community College in a typical fall semester. The credit student population is split about evenly in the choice of transfer or career-technical programs. The average age of all students is 28 years and the student population is non-racially identifiable. There are over 200 employees at the college including more than 70 full-time faculty members. Eighty-six percent of the faculty hold Master's or Doctor's degrees.  Student life  = Sport = The college athletic teams are nicknamed the Cougars.

For many years he was a senior figure in the Italian Communist Party (PCI). Political career Ingrao was born at Lenola, in the province of Latina. As a student he was a member of GUF (Gruppo Universitario Fascista) and won a \\"Littoriale\\" of culture and art. Ingrao joined the PCI in 1940 and took part in the anti- fascist resistance during World War II. After the war, he led the Marxist- Leninist tendency in the party, representing its left wing. This led him to frequent political differences with Giorgio Amendola, leader of the social democratic tendency. Ingrao was a Member of Parliament continuously from 1950 to 1992. In 1947‚Äì1957, he was editor-in-chief of the party newspaper, L'Unit√†. He was the first Communist to become President of the Italian Chamber of Deputies, a position he held from 1976 to 1979. After PCI's then-secretary Achille Occhetto, in what was called the Svolta della Bolognina, decided to change the party's name, Ingrao become his main internal opponent. In the PCI's 20th Congress of 1991, he joined the reformist majority in its successor, the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), but soon left the group. After the European elections of 2004, he abandoned PDS and adhered (as an independent) to the more hardline successor to the old PCI, the Communist Refoundation Party. He has written a number of poems and political essays. His most important work is Appuntamenti di fine secolo (\\"Rendez-vous at the end of the century\\"), published in 1995 in collaboration with Rossana Rossanda. Ingrao was an atheist. He married , who died in 2003. Ingrao died on September 27, 2015 at the age of 100.Addio a Pietro Ingrao, morto a Roma lo storico dirigente del Pci, La Repubblica, 27 September 2015.

Early life  Kl√§ber left school at the age of 14 and began training as a locksmith and later trained to be a mechanic at Zeiss. He joined the Wandervogelbewegung and traveled through many countries of Europe. World War I broke out and put an end to his travels. In 1914 he joined the German Army and fought in World War I, where he was wounded and contracted typhoid fever.  Politics  Upon returning from the war he joined the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and the Spartakusbund. He participated in armed uprisings in Halle, Hamburg and Berlin as well as in the strike against the Kapp-Putsch. He earned his living as a traveling book salesmen for the Th√ºringen Ministry of Culture, specializing in political literature: social critical lyrics, as well as novels depicting the hardships of the working class. He published his first volume of workers poetry ‚ÄúNeue Saat‚Äù (new seed) in 1919. In 1923 he traveled to the USA and spent a year touring, giving lectures and studying the situation of workers in the USA. His experiences in the USA became his first novel written in 1923, which wasn't published until 1927 ‚ÄúPassagiere der III. Klasse‚Äù (Third Class Passengers). Back in Germany in 1924 he married the writer and professional storyteller Lisa Tetzner. Together they traveled promoting communist literature. In addition to writing, giving lectures and editing magazines and books Kl√§ber also worked in mines near K√∂ln, as well as other jobs to aid his understanding of the working class laborers. He joined the Bund proletarisch-revolution√§re Schriftsteller (the Association of Proletarian-Revolutionary Authors) and was one of the publishers of the journal regularly sent to their members, Linkskurve. Kl√§ber gained a reputation as a leading authority on Communist literature. As a known opponent of National Socialism, he was arrested the day after the Reichstag fire and incarcerated. With the help of his wife, he was soon released from prison and sent into exile over Austria to Carona in Ticino in neutral Switzerland. In 1938 he left the KPD as a reaction to Stalinism.  Literary career  With the encouragement of his wife, Lisa, Kl√§ber devoted himself to writing. The conditions of his exile prohibited him from publishing under his own name, so he adopted the pseudonym Kurt Held. He saw children as the true victims of war, class struggle and injustice. His books portrayed children realistically and conveyed messages of morality. His greatest success \\"The Outsiders of Oskoken Castle\\" was soon followed by similar books about working class children: ‚ÄúDer Trommler von Faido‚Äù (The Drummer of Faido), ‚ÄúMatthias und seine Freunde‚Äù (Matthias and his Friends) and the four volume series ‚ÄúGiuseppe und Maria‚Äù.  Death  He died in exile on 9 December 1959 in Sorengo, Switzerland from the consequences of the typhoid fever he contracted in World War I.

It is a particular case of mechanical telephony, where sound (i.e., vibrations in the air) is converted into vibrations along liquid or solid medium. These vibrations are transmitted along the medium and then reconverted back to sound. In the case of tin can telephone the medium is a string.  History  Before the invention of the electromagnetic telephone, there were mechanical acoustic devices for transmitting spoken words and music over a distance greater than that of normal speech. The very earliest mechanical telephones were based on sound transmission through pipes or other physical media, and among the very earliest experiments were those conducted by the British physicist and polymath Robert Hooke from 1664 to 1685.McVeigh, Daniel P.

Grant & Son, 1902, p. 28. 182x182px The highly similar acoustic tin can telephone, or 'lover's phone', has also been known for centuries. It connects two diaphragms with a taut string or wire, which transmits sound by mechanical vibrations from one to the other along the wire (and not by a modulated electric current). The classic example is the children's toy made by connecting the bottoms of two paper cups, metal cans, or plastic bottles with tautly held string. For a short period of time acoustic telephones were marketed commercially as a niche competitor to the electrical telephone, as they preceded the latter's invention and didn't fall within the scope of its patent protection. When Alexander Graham Bell's telephone patent expired and dozens of new phone companies flooded the marketplace, acoustic telephone manufacturers could not compete commercially and quickly went out of business. Their maximum range was very limited, but hundreds of technical innovations (resulting in about 300 patents) increased their range to approximately a half mile (800 m) or more under ideal conditions.Jacobs, Bill.

During the 20th century, it came into common use in preschools and elementary schools to teach children about sound vibration.  Operation  202x202px When the string is pulled taut and someone speaks into one of the cans, its bottom acts as a diaphragm, converting the sound waves into longitudinal mechanical vibrations which vary the tension of the string. These variations in tension set up longitudinal waves in the string which travel to the second can, causing its bottom to vibrate in a similar manner as the first can, thus recreating the sound, which is heard by the second person. The signal can be directed around corners with at least two methods: The first method can be implemented by creating a loop in the string which is then twisted and anchored to another object. Another method makes use of an extra can positioned on the apex of the corner; the string is threaded through the base of the can so as to avoid coming into contact with the object around which the signal is to be directed.

It stands on one of the many hills in the Vulture, the vast region that stretches south of the river Ofanto (which forms the natural border of the northern Basilicata), region of deep-rooted origins history that is called Melfi. It extends along the slopes of volcanic of Vulture and is a large sub- area of Basilicata region, characterized by the cultivation and production of grapes \\"Aglianico, which gives its name to one of the most renowned regional wines and appreciated, the'Aglianico del Vulture, precisely. Ripacandida rises from the rock on which you can enjoy the scenery as far as the eye can see, huge and impressive, while walking through the narrow streets of the main street, peering in the direction of the Vulture can be seen in all her radiant beauty, especially in light of the reddish clear summer sunsets, this mountain almost \\"magic\\" that dominates the landscape to north-west.  History  Ripacandida, Italy, evening view of street The archaeological survey of the years 1977‚Äì80 due to the antiquity of Ripacandida the seventh century BC, but by the end of the nineteenth century historian Lucan Michele Lacava found some caves dating archeolitica and floor mosaics at the foot of Ripacandida. The Greek historians (Aristotle, Timaeus, and Antiochus of Syracuse) cite as \\"Enotria\\" contemporary Basilicata. FromGeographyof Strabo we learn that \\"before the arrival of the Greeks on the Ionian coast of Basilicata, and there were Choni Enotri. The second Oenotrian Dionysius of Halicarnassus descended from Oenotrus, originating from the mythical hero 'Arcadia who arrived around 1800 BC, subjugated the indigenous plant and viticulture. His successor, Italy became farmers, pastoralists, instituting the \\"Syssitia\\". Later the region was occupied by Samnites, populations Osco-Samnite from which descend the Luciani. They descended from the mountains of Sannio and in several waves occupied the peninsula. They practiced \\"sacred spring\\": when the population grew a group of young people choose a symbol (Totem) and partly in search of new lands. It was a nation of proud warriors, powerful enough to bind the Roman army for fifty years. Rome suffered the humiliation of defeat at the Caudine Forks, and then reorganize the army and crush the Samnites. The Romanization of the region came with the transfer of 20 000 settlers, was born near Venus, in 291 BC Samnites are descended from many other ethnic groups: the Hirpini, the Caudini, the Bruttii etc. The Luke Society is organized into tribes, each with its own head i \\"Meddices\\" who are elected annually. All are expected to participate in community life, everything is divided equally. Federation linked by a bond, in case of war, elect a head of the basileus \\". The ancient town of Ripacandida Web site was more important than Serra di Vaglio (Vaglio Basilicata) a few miles from power. The Lucan through rivers: Basento, Bradano, Agri and Sinni traded with the Greek cities (Metaponto, Siris, Heraclea). The Sele and 'Ofanto allow access to both sides: the Adriatic and Tyrrhenian. Dialect idiom (true linguistic island in the neighborhood) we find the root of many words with the Oscan of Greek origin. Oral tradition says that the city was built by the Romans under the name \\"Candida Latinorum\\" (remains of Roman aqueduct). Some scholars believe the name is given by the white color of the hill. The modern town dates from the time of invasions Gothic, when the inhabitants moved from the valley on the hill, and build their houses around the temple dedicated to Jupiter (present castle-Church mother). I Lombard the fortified walls interspersed with towers. Undergoing the various dominations arrive at the first written sources of the XI-XII sec. The papal bull Eugenius III (1152) decreed the construction of the churches of San Donato (the only one that still exists), San Pietro, San Zaccaria, San Gregorio. Participates in the First Crusade. And is registered in the Catalogue of the Barons with thirteen nobles, headed by the overlord Roger Marescalco to participate in the Third Crusade to William the Good (1188‚Äì1198).

Change number of feudal lords, Caracciolo Grimaldi of Monaco, Boccapianola Tironi, the last owner is the Duke Mazzacara (1806). A first colony Albanian refugees in 1482 is housed in a suburban area called Canton and later moved to Massa Lombarda. On 5 October 1571 share in the victory Battle of Lepanto with a large number of citizens including Gianlorenzo Lioy. Between five hundred and seven hundred is home to a study of Theology. In April 1861, sided with the robbers led by Carmine Crocco, on this occasion there was the first victim: the National Guard captain Michael Anastasia. He also had fierce brigands Turtoro, Di Biase, Larotonda. = The end of the 19th century: heavy immigration to the United States = At the end of the 19th century, the inhabitants of Ripacandida started immigrating in search of a better future, first to Altoona, Pennsylvania and then on to Blue Island, Illinois. Two sons of immigrants from Ripacandida in Blue Island have become famous: boxer Tony Musto, who fought Joe Louis for the World Heavyweight Title on 8 April 1941 and Gary Sinise, an award-winning actor, musician and director, who co-founded Chicago's Steppenwolf Theater Company. In memory of the traditions in Ripacandida, the town of Blue Island celebrates Saint Donatus of Arezzo with its Feast of St. Donatus every year in August. The Nobel Prize in Physics in 1997 was awarded to William Donald Phillips of Pennsylvania, whose mother was born in Ripacandida in 1913 and moved to the United States in 1920. =1940‚Äì1960= During the 1940s, Ripacandida was suffering under the wrath of Benito Mussolini. Many of the residents had to find shelter or stay in nearby caves. The Nazis circled all around the town to find all of the Jewish folk. Some died even if they were not Jewish, but died if they were crippled, had dark hair/dark eyes, and were a different culture besides European. = 1980‚Äì2000 = From the 1980s to the early 2000s, German anthropologist Thomas Hauschild (member of the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences and chair in the dpt. for social anthropology at the University at Halle/Saale, Germany) used to document extensively religious and political life in Ripacandida and surroundings. In this, he was supported by many protagonists from the local population, including Michele Ciccarella, Carmela \\"Quartariegg'\\" Carlucci Perretta, Vito Gioiosa, Luigi \\"Ginetto\\" Gilio, and many others. His findings were edited in the form of numerous articles in scientific journals and in his book \\"Magie und Macht in Italien\\" (2002), translated into English by Jeremy Gaines (\\"Power and Magic in Italy\\", London and New York, Berghahn publishers, 2011). In 2009, Thomas Hauschild accompanied the famous art historian Hans Belting (Order Pour le M√©rite of Arts and Sciences, Berlin and Dumbarton Oaks Institute, Harvard U.) to Ripacandida. On behalf of the local \\"Pro Loco\\" association (Gerardo Cripezzi, Luigi Gilio and others), Hans Belting evaluated the frescoes at the San Donato church at Ripacandida and attested to their extraordinary value as a monument in the history of arts. Following Belting, the frescoes reflect impressively periods of peace and unrest, of earthquake and new economic development in the small Lucanian centre. In this occasion, Hans Belting accepted the regional award \\"Fede e Arte\\" from the local UNESCO committee and from the Pro Loco. in a highly acclaimed speech, Hans Belting attested for the many \\"secrets\\" still hidden in these frescoes for future research.

German linguist Bigalke did his fieldwork in the 1980s all over the Basilicata and shortly also at Ripacandida. Monuments of interest The center of town has architecture of mainly the 18th and 19th century. The exception is the Casa Lioy, a palace built in 1089 with subsequent reconstructions. =Religious architecture= Facade before restoration * The church of Santa Maria del Sepulcro is church in Ripacandida. Previously, the site had housed a church dedicated to Saint Catherine of Alexandria. A new church was built to consolidate two parishes, and consecrated in 1540 by Monsignor Aquaviva, bishop of Melfi. The church was completed in 1602 by Abbot Lorenzo Leonibus. The exterior facade is accessed by a marble staircase; it has a Renaissance portal and three clocks: two mechanical and one a sundial. The typmpanum has a Madonna of the Sepulchre. The name was called Sepulcro to commemorate thirteen barons who died in Palestine in Third Crusade in William the Good. The interior has a chapel of the sacrament by Giovanni Battista Rossi, who also completed the polychrome marble balustrade of the presbytery. In four columns of the balustrades are bas- reliefs of the Passion of Christ. The sacristy houses a \\"Piet√†\\" by Christian Danone and a \\"St. Bartholomew\\" by Gaetano Recco. * The church of San Giuseppe was part of a cloistered nunnery founded in 1735 by Giovanni and Giovanni Battista Rossi. The church, which dates to 1173, presents a facade of terracotta bricks, with a baroque portal. The main altarpiece depicts a Madonna and Child with Saints Teresa and Joseph by a follower of Francesco Solimena. The interior has a baroque decoration. In the sacristy is the tomb of the mystic Sister Maria Araneo (died circa 1790), granddaughter of Giovanni Rossi and prioress of the monastery. Legend holds that her body was found, in a miraculous state of preservation, earthquake 1980. A year later, in 1751, this church was the site of a miracle by St. Gerard Majella (record of the event is preserved at the Sanctuary of Materdomini in Nocera Superiore. * The church of San Antonio was built at the site of an ancient tower. It was severely damaged by the earthquake of 1980. * The church of Santa Maria del Carmine is located near the entrance of the old cemetery (now a public garden) is presumed to have been built before the earthquake of 1694. Reconstructed with this title archpriest Baffari (uncle of the Blessed GB Rossi), however, clear from the baronial family coat of arms placed on the entrance door. It presents a unique decoration, made in the first half of the eighteenth century. Recent renovations have restored to its original splendor frescoes depicting the Holy Trinity, Our Lady of Mount Carmel and rosettes with the Saints, and Bishop Donald Donato (San Donato by Ripacandida). At the side of the seventeenth-century sculpture of the Madonna del Carmine San Donato Sanctuary At the entrance from the north-east up area there is the ancient shrine of San Donato by Ripacandida, patron of the town, with its paintings of 1500 and its millennial history. The adjacent \\"villa\\", the churchyard behind the millennial center of pilgrimage, contains meticulously cultivated trees that derive from the 16th century or earlier. The local feast of Saint Donatus (5‚Äì7 August) is one of the oldest and most beautiful festivals of saints of the Basilicata, showing still remnants of authentic old folk customs. The shrine, one of the most famous of Basilicata, is affiliated with the church of San Francesco in Assisi and received the gift of a relic of the patron saint of Italy. In December 2010, the sanctuary gets from 'UNESCO recognition of Monumento a messenger of peace culture to the profound spiritual values that for centuries forward. Naturalistic =The Forest= One of the natural beauty of the wood is Ripacandida, though little appreciated. Called the Great Forest, perhaps because it was originally more of a big region. One of the few residues of the immense forests that covered the Lucania (for Latin lucus = wood), now much reduced as a result of uncontrolled cuts. Composed of tall trees such as oaks, cedars, etc.. For centuries it has employed, fed and warm during the cold winters of the population Ripacandida and neighboring countries. The peasants, including women fearless and courageous, they went to the woods to cut and then sell what was called a \\"body\\" of wood. Uploaded on mules, was brought to sell in neighboring countries. Refuge and breeding herds, during the so-called \\"transhumance\\", which used the forest as a resting place for their long journeys. Also has a construction called \\"mansions\\" and \\"pile\\" that is, drinking troughs for animals. During the robbery, was a refuge for the robbers, who used the many caves to avoid capture. =La Pineta= The pine forest was planted in the late fifties to the base and on the slopes of the hill on which stands Ripacandida. On fire repeatedly over the years, resistant in some areas, where she grew lush and precisely to the base and side Rionero. Since 2006, (i.e. since the Fonti del Vulture were bought by a famous multinational company), we see in the spot of 'Water Lily where it makes a fine show. Traditions =The game of Morra= One of the favorite pastimes ripacandidesi, especially by men, was the game of Morra. During the long winter evenings but also to distract them from the drudgery of the fields two or more people are delighted to \\"guess the sum of the fingers shown in the game for two players.\\" The winner was a good shot of \\"Aglianico\\". The first news of the game of Morra date back to ancient Egypt, but probably were the Roman soldiers to spread in Italy, because it was very common in ancient Rome. The success of the game is because it only requires the use of hands, a game so that you can play everywhere, poor but not simple, requiring skill and intelligence. The player must think in fractions of a second in two ways: to predict the opponent's game and never play the numbers that you expect your opponent. In recent years, associations have been created at national level who seek to take up the slack. Today, the Morra has become a rarely practiced custom. =Easter Bread= The characteristic shape braided bread traditionally prepared for the Passover is called \\"rucilatieggh\\". Do not know the origin of the custom of the Easter bread, unique among other things, because neighboring countries does not exist. Prepared by the good housewife, was then baked in the houses, each house had its oven. \\"I rucilatieggh\\" were prepared from a dough of flour, oil, water, fennel seeds, eggs, salt and baking powder and then polished with egg yolk. The tradition continues in the bakery who prepare for Tuesday and Friday. =The cupboard= Traditionally every house had Ripacandida the oven for baking bread, which had a high form of bread similar to matter. The bread was baked once placed in the cupboard, which was also used for mixing, 'lu'mpasta'pan'. In every kitchen there was this piece of furniture that was in the form of a box: two doors, two drawers and upper compartment with hinged lid flare. After the fifties, retired skilled tradesmen all the antique furniture in exchange for plastic containers. To the cry of 'mobil'viecch' reaping what to ripacandidesi no longer needed, then restore them and sell them at high prices.

Molony, who had developed a passion for the race-track and gambling from the age of ten years, and acted as a bookie for his school-mates, graduated from the University of Western Ontario in London with a degree in journalism. Initially planning to be a financial writer, he did so well in a Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) aptitude test that he was put in their management-training program and hired right out of university. Molony spent a few weeks as a teller before working in savings, current accounts, foreign exchange and loan accounting, then \\"floating\\" among some of the bank's huge network of some 1,600 branches, which gave him a further broad exposure to the bank's highly regimented workings and familiarity with its systems and internal weaknesses.Ross, Gary Stephen; Stung: The Incredible Obsession of Brian Molony, McClelland & Stewart, 2002. On a modest annual salary of about $10,000, Molony led an unassuming lifestyle in Toronto, wearing inexpensive, ill-fitting clothes and leaving carefully calculated seven percent tips in restaurants. At the same time, he was embezzling $10.2 million from CIBC to feed his gambling habit, writing loans in the names of both real and fictitious companies. Molony was then able to transfer millions of dollars out of the bank through a company called California Clearing Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Desert Palace, a Las Vegas casino. This corporation's only purpose was to let people deposit sums of money into the casino without detection.Von Bergen, Jane; \\"Caesars Reaches Accord With Bank In Molony Case\\", Philadelphia Inquirer, May 15, 1986. Molony was arrested on April 27, 1982, the day after he lost a million dollars at the tables at Caesars Atlantic City Hotel-Casino. Caesars claimed that it never asked Molony for personal or credit information, yet admitted in court to supplying him with tens of thousands of dollars' worth of hotel rooms and a private Learjet to travel to and from Las Vegas and Atlantic City. Molony pleaded guilty to embezzlement in November 1983, and served two-and-half years in prison, although some sources claim that he served six years. On release, he agreed to a program of restitution and community service, which includes public speaking about the compulsion of gambling. Molony is now married with children, and works as a business consultant. A federal lawsuit, filed by the CIBC in 1982, contended that Caesars officials induced Molony to gamble even though they knew‚Äîor should have known‚Äîthat the money could not possibly have been his. CIBC's counsel initially stated that he hoped to recover some $4,732,000 that Molony lost at Caesars from February 7, 1981 to April 23, 1982; the terms of the settlement are private. As part of an agreement between the casino and the state Division of Gaming Enforcement, Caesars was forced to close for a day on November 30, the Saturday after Thanksgiving, as a disciplinary measure. The New Jersey Casino Control Commission also levied $36,500 in fines against six Caesars employees. Industry analysts estimated that the casino stood to lose between $700,000 and $800,000 because of the shutdown.Maykuth, Andrew (December 1, 1985) \\"New Jersey shuts down casino for a day\\"; The Day; p3 Gary Stephen Ross's best-selling non-fiction book Stung chronicles Molony's 18 months of increasingly brazen fraud and out-of-control gambling.

It was upon a meeting with Nab√≠l-i-A ªzam that Bad√≠ ª heard a poem by Bah√° ºu'll√°h and began weeping. After finishing his studies, he gave away his possessions and set out on foot for Baghdad, where a significant number of Bah√° º√≠s were under persecution.

Aquinas College is a private Roman Catholic college in Nashville, Tennessee. It was founded in 1961 and named in honor of St. Thomas Aquinas. History Aquinas College is a private, Catholic, four-year liberal arts college founded in 1961, owned and operated by the Dominican Sisters of St. Cecilia Congregation in Nashville, Tennessee. Offering undergraduate and graduate degrees in education and the arts and sciences, Aquinas College is a leader in the formation of educators who are sent forth to teach, preach, and witness to Truth and Charity for the salvation of souls and the transformation of culture. Aquinas College roots began in 1928 as St. Cecilia Normal School as a school for religious sisters located at the St. Cecilia Motherhouse. In 1961, the school moved away from the Motherhouse, opened to the public, and became Aquinas Junior College. In 1994, the college was renamed Aquinas College when it began offering four-year degrees. Since that time, Aquinas College has grown to include four-year programs in Liberal Arts, Business, Nursing, and Teacher Education. And in 2012, the College began graduate studies in the School of Education and in the School of Nursing, and founded a residential life program and House Life program. Aquinas is part of the Dominican Campus, located approximately five miles (8 km) west of downtown Nashville. Also on the same plot of land are Overbrook School, a coeducational eight-grade Catholic primary school, and Saint Cecilia Academy, a Catholic girls' high school. The addition of a third and fourth year collegiate curriculum caused a major change in the school's operation. It had previously been a major power in junior college athletics (notably baseball and basketball). However, the school's administration felt that continuing to play junior college athletics while operating as a four- year college, as was done for a period, misrepresented the school's true nature to the public and that competition at the four-year collegiate level of athletics would prove cost-prohibitive, so the institution currently sponsors no athletic programs. In 2014, Aquinas College began the implementation of its Vision 2020: Truth & Charity strategic plan, which included the reintroduction of intercollegiate athletics. The College promptly implemented three initiatives outlined in the strategic plan: the foundation of a perpetual Eucharistic Adoration chapel, the foundation of study abroad in Bracciano, Italy, and the implementation of a four-year Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) program. The founding of Aquinas College in 1961 was the realization of a long-held dream of the Dominican Sisters of St. Cecilia of Nashville, Tennessee: to have a place where the newest members of the religious community could receive their initial degrees to serve in the community's teaching apostolate. Over the years, this fundamental mission has remained, even as the sisters have continually found ways to be of service to the educational and catechetical needs of the Nashville community and beyond. In the fall of 2017, Aquinas College embarked on a path of reconfiguration in order to focus its academic programming on preparation of educators and to strengthen its service to Catholic school teachers, leaders, and catechists through spiritual and professional formation programs. In 2019 Aquinas College released and began implementation of Sent to Witness: Aquinas College Strategic Plan 2019‚Äì2025, in support of the sharp focus on education.Sent to Witness: Aquinas College Strategic Plan 2019-2025 https://www.aquinascollege.edu/about- aquinas/strategic-plan-2019-2025/ The Center for Catholic Education at Aquinas College in conjunction with the School of Education serves Catholic elementary and secondary schools by providing spiritual and professional formation opportunities in the area of mission and Catholic identity.Homepage, Center for Catholic Education at Aquinas College at https://www.aquinascollege.edu/centers/center-for-catholic-education/ accessed February 17, 2020.

Rankings The U.S. News & World Report has ranked Aquinas College as 14th in Best Regional Colleges in the South in its 2015 rankings, up from a ranking of 30th in the previous year. Contributing to the high ranking were the low class sizes and student-to- faculty ratio, high freshman retention rate, high test scores, a high graduation rate, and a high peer assessment score. The magazine also recognized Aquinas College for being 4th in Best Colleges for Veterans in the same regional college category, up from 7th in the previous year.

Formed in 2002 in Watt's hometown of San Pedro, California, the band first consisted of organist Pete Mazich and drummer Jerry Trebotic, both of whom had played with Watt in a side project, The Madonnabes, that was devoted to reinterpreting the works of Madonna; the three musicians had also previously recorded a song for a Doctors Without Borders benefit album under the name Mike Watt & Masina in 1998, with Mazich's wife Ljil on vocals. The Secondmen did three tours of the United States and Canada wherein they played early versions of some of the songs that were to be on the album, along with songs from Watt's back catalog and hand-picked cover versions rearranged for organ. Mazich's day job commitments forced him to tour as much as his earned vacation time (five weeks for the spring 2002 tour; seven weeks for the spring 2003 tour) would allow. For the remainder of the 2002 tour, guitarist Tom Watson took Mazich's place, and the Secondmen finished the tour as The Jom and Terry Show; the spring 2003 tour saw former Screamers and Twisted Roots keyboardist Paul Roessler (who is also Watt's former brother-in- law) sub for Mazich during the last three weeks of the tour. By October 2003 Mazich decided to quit the day job in order to be able to concentrate on music while working as a freelance, \\"casual\\", longshoreman in between Watt tours. In January 2004, the band recorded The Secondman's Middle Stand along with former that dog. vocalist Petra Haden in a San Pedro recording studio. The group initially intended to start promoting the album during the 2004 Lollapalooza festival, but the cancellation of the festival led to the band not touring behind the album until September of that year. At one point, neither Trebotic nor Mazich could join Watt so they were temporarily replaced by Raul Morales and Tom Watson with the new combination named The Missingmen. In 2005, personal commitments similar to Trebotic's forced Mazich to sit out a European tour behind Middle Stand; Paul Roessler played in his stead a second time. (Maintaining a sense of humor, Watt nicknamed the Roessler/Morales lineup \\"The Second-string Men\\".) The original lineup, however, did regroup to film a trilogy of three videos from The Secondman's Middle Stand with director Mike Muscarella. A regrouping of the original Secondmen lineup of Watt, Mazich and Trebotic played the Festival Periferias in Huesca, Spain on October 29, 2005, and a benefit concert for the San Pedro Skateboard Association on November 5, 2005. After the success of those gigs, the Secondmen were scheduled to play two more Los Angeles-area shows, including a December 3 opening slot with reunited punk legends and longtime heroes of Watt's, the Germs. The original lineup continues to play on occasion in the Los Angeles area, and has also played as a five-piece with Watson and Morales as The Secondmissingmen; this hybrid lineup debuted on Watt's 57th birthday.

In the case of war with the Soviet Union, AFNORTH would assume supreme command of all Allied forces in northern Europe (Norway and Denmark) and Germany north of Elbe/Hamburg and adjacent sea territory. History For much of its existence its commander-in-chief (CINCNORTH) was a British Admiral or General. The chief-of-staff was always a German Vice Admiral. The central Air Force Commander Northern Europe, who would assume command of all NATO air forces in AFNORTH's area in the case of war, was directly subordinated to CINCNORTH and was always a general from the U.S. Air Force. The leadership of AFNORTH additionally included a Land Deputy, a Sea Deputy, and an Air Deputy, who were for a period Danish or Norwegian Major Generals or Rear Admirals. Headquarters Allied Air Forces Northern Europe was created by SHAPE on 29 March 1951. Major General R.K. Taylor, U.S. Air Force, was assigned as its commander on 2 April 1951. The Headquarters was established in London on 1 June 1951 and later transferred to Oslo, Norway on 22 June 1951. By June 1952 no units had been earmarked or allocated for it. Major General Homer L. Sanders held command September 1954-September 1957. Major General Carl D. Peterson became Air Deputy in June 1977. Until the formation of BALTAP around 1962, AFNORTH comprised Allied Land Forces Norway, Allied Land Forces Denmark, and Allied Air Forces and Allied Naval Forces, Northern Europe (four commands).Bernd Lemke, Dieter Kr√ºger, Heinz Rebhan, Wolfgang Schmidt: Die Luftwaffe 1950 bis 1970. Konzeption, Aufbau, Integration. Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, M√ºnchen 2006, , S. 489. In 1989 at the end of the Cold War AFNORTH's major subordinate commands were Allied Forces North Norway; Allied Forces South Norway; and Allied Forces Baltic Approaches (Karup). BALTAP comprised AIRBALTAP, NAVBALTAP, LANDZEALAND, responsible for the land defence of Zealand and the other Danish islands, and Allied Land Forces Schleswig-Holstein and Jutland (LANDJUT). From 1962 LANDJUT had been responsible for the land defence of the Baltic Approaches from a headquarters at Rendsburg, Germany. LANDJUT comprised the 6th Panzergrenadier Division and the Danish Jutland Division. LANDJUT was planned to be reinforced in time of war by the United Kingdom Mobile Force, primarily 1st Infantry Brigade and the US Army's 9th Infantry Division. In case of war with the Warsaw Pact AFNORTH would have moved its headquarter to the subterranean command center at Kols√•s. HQ AFNORTH Kols√•s closed on the morning of 30 June 1994. The HQ that replaced it, HQ Allied Forces Northwestern Europe (AFNORTHWEST), located at RAF High Wycombe in the United Kingdom, was activated in the afternoon of 30 June 1994.For more on AFNORTHWEST, see Office of Public Information accessed February 2009 AFNORTHWEST directed three Principal Subordinate Commanders: Commander Allied Air Forces Northwestern Europe (COMAIRNORTHWEST), Commander Allied Naval Forces Northwestern Europe (COMNAVNORTHWEST) (the former EASTLANT/CINCHAN), and Commander Allied Forces Northern Europe (COMNORTH), an amalgamation of Allied Forces North and South Norway. In addition, in various circumstances Baltic Approaches naval forces would report to either CINCNORTHWEST or COMNAVNORTHWEST. AFCENT, located in Brunssum in the Netherlands, was renamed AFNORTH. AFNORTHWEST was disestablished on 3 March 2000, CINCNORTHWEST transferring his authority to RHQ AFNORTH the same day. In the year 2004, it was again renamed, to Joint Force Command Brunssum.

Jerry Wayne Hairston Jr. (born May 29, 1976) is an American former professional baseball infielder and outfielder. He played sixteen seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Baltimore Orioles, Chicago Cubs, Texas Rangers, Cincinnati Reds, New York Yankees, San Diego Padres, Washington Nationals, Milwaukee Brewers, and Los Angeles Dodgers. He played every position except pitcher and catcher during his baseball career. He is the grandson of former major leaguer Sam Hairston, the son of former major leaguer Jerry Hairston Sr., and the brother of Scott Hairston. He helped the Yankees win the 2009 World Series, beating the Philadelphia Phillies, giving him his only World Series title. High school and college In High School, he was a two-time All-State selection at Naperville North High School in baseball and an all-area selection in basketball. He was drafted in the 42nd round of the 1995 Major League Baseball draft by the Baltimore Orioles but chose instead to go to college. Hairston played college ball at Southern Illinois University in 1996 and 1997, where he batted .360 for his career and was the Missouri Valley Conference Freshman of the Year in 1996. In both years he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League, playing for the Bourne Braves in 1996, and the Wareham Gatemen in 1997. He was later inducted as a member of the Southern Illinois Baseball Hall of Fame. Professional career =Baltimore Orioles= Hairston was drafted in the 11th round of the 1997 Major League Baseball draft by the Baltimore Orioles. He made his professional debut in 1997 with the rookie-league Bluefield Orioles, where he hit .330 in 59 games. In 1998, he made a fast rise up the farm system, starting in A with the Frederick Keys, where he played in 80 games and hit .302, then he was promoted to the AA Bowie Baysox, where he hit .326 in 55 games and received a September promotion to the Major Leagues. He made his major league debut with the Orioles on September 11, 1998 against the Anaheim Angels at second base, he was hitless in three at-bats in that game. He appeared in a total of 7 games in 1998, primarily as a pinch runner or late inning defensive replacement, and did not get a hit in 7 at-bats. In 1999 and 2000, he split his time between the AAA Rochester Red Wings and the Orioles. He recorded his first Major League hit on June 27, 1999 off of New York Yankees pitcher Orlando Hern√°ndez and his first home run came off of Joey Hamilton of the Toronto Blue Jays on July 1, 1999. He had fairly regular playing time with the Orioles in 2001 and 2002 and was used more as a utility player in 2003 and 2004. In his seven seasons with Baltimore, he played in 558 games, batting .261. =Chicago Cubs= He was traded (along with Oriole prospects Mike Fontenot and David Crouthers) to the Chicago Cubs in the 2005 offseason for Sammy Sosa. The Cubs attempted to use Hairston as a leadoff man, but he finished the 2005 season with an unremarkable on-base percentage of .336 and stole only 8 bases in 17 attempts. Even though most Cubs fans initially welcomed the dismissal of Sosa‚Äîwhose performance was on the decline and was seen as a problematic teammate‚Äîthe poor play of Hairston would eventually cause many fans to sour on this particular trade. In two seasons with the Cubs, he hit .251 in 152 games. =Texas Rangers= Hairston's statistics declined further at the start of the 2006 season, and on May 31, he was traded to the Texas Rangers for Phil Nevin. Hairston was released from the Rangers after the 2006 season but re-signed to a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training. Hairston won a spot on the opening day roster, as a reserve outfielder and utility player. A series of injuries to teammates Hank Blalock, Ian Kinsler, Mark Teixeira, and Frank Catalanotto, as well as the trades of Teixeira and Kenny Lofton, led to Hairston playing on a regular basis throughout the 2007 season. Hairston became a free agent after the season. In his two seasons with Texas, he hit .194 in 136 games. =Cincinnati Reds= On March 3, 2008, Hairston signed a minor league contract with the Cincinnati Reds. On April 21, his contract was purchased by the Reds and was added to the roster. He was re-signed after the season, on January 7, 2009, to a one-year contract; the contract contained $2 million in guaranteed money. In two seasons with the Reds, he hit .287 in 166 games. =World Baseball Classic= Hairston represented Mexico at the 2009 World Baseball Classic alongside his brother Scott. Hairston's mother was born in Mexico, making him eligible to play for the Mexican team. He had 4 hits in 14 at-bats in the Classic. =New York Yankees= On July 31, 2009, he was traded to the New York Yankees for minor league catcher Chase Weems. On August 1, 2009, Hairston got his first hit and RBI as a Yankee. On October 17, 2009, he got his first career post-season hit in his first career post-season at-bat and later ended a 13-inning ALCS Game 2 by scoring on an error by the Angels' Maicer Izturis. This gave the Yankees a 2‚Äì0 advantage going into the third game of the series. He had 1 hit in 6 at-bats for the Yankees in the 2009 World Series. In his half season with the Yanks, he hit .237 with 2 homeruns and 12 RBIs in 45 games. =San Diego Padres= On January 18, 2010, Hairston signed a one-year, $2.15 million contract with the San Diego Padres, the same team as his brother, Scott Hairston, was playing on. Hairston's 2010 season was cut short in September with a fractured right tibia, but he still played in 119 games with the Padres, hitting .244. =Washington Nationals= Hairston with Nationals in 2011 spring training. On January 19, 2011, Hairston agreed to a one-year, $2 million contract with the Washington Nationals that included over $1 million in incentives. He played in 75 games for them, hitting .268. =Milwaukee Brewers= On July 30, 2011, Hairston was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers for Double-A outfielder Erik Komatsu. He played in 45 games for the Brewers, hitting .274. =Los Angeles Dodgers= On December 5, 2011, the Los Angeles Dodgers signed Hairston to a two-year contract worth $6 million. On June 1, 2012 Hairston was part of a Dodgers lineup that featured the sons of five former Major Leaguers (along with Tony Gwynn Jr., Iv√°n DeJes√∫s Jr., Dee Gordon and Scott Van Slyke). This was the first time in Major League history that this had occurred. It was also the first time a starting infield of four major league sons had ever occurred: first baseman Van Slyke, second baseman Hairston, third baseman De Jesus and shortstop Gordon. On August 22, it was determined that Hairston would need surgery on his left hip. The injury had bothered him for some time before he finally went on the disabled list on August 13. The surgery would sideline him for the rest of the season. In 78 games with the Dodgers in 2012, Hairston hit .273 while playing numerous different positions. In 2013, Hairston was a key reserve for the Dodgers, playing 28 games at third base, 23 in left field, 4 in right field, 13 at first base and 1 at second base. He struggled with the bat however, hitting just .211. Broadcasting career On December 11, 2013, it was announced that Hairston would be retiring as an active player to join the Dodgers pre and post game broadcasting crew on SportsNet LA. Performance- enhancing drugs controversy According to Luis Fernando Llosa and L. Jon Wertheim, Hairston received genotropin, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and clomiphene citrate in 2004. One of Hairston's prescriptions was written by \\"A. Almarashi.\\" Investigators believe Almarashi is an alias for a Queens, N.Y., doctor stripped of her medical license in 1999. She is awaiting trial on multiple charges after allegedly writing bogus prescriptions for thousands of online customers she never examined. Hairston denied any connection, stating \\"Not one time have I taken steroids or anything like that. [ . . .] I would never do anything like that to jeopardize my career or my family's name.\\" On December 13, 2007, he was cited in the Mitchell Report to the Commissioner of Baseball of an Independent Investigation Into the Illegal Use of Steroids and Other Performance Enhancing Substances by Players in Major League Baseball. Personal life Jerry's brother Scott is also a professional baseball player. Their father Jerry Hairston Sr. and grandfather Sam Hairston were also major league players, making him the first African American to be a third- generation major-leaguer. Hairston's heritage is also Mexican American on his mother's side. His uncle Johnny Hairston also played in the majors. Several other family members have also played in the minor leagues. He attended Naperville North High School in Naperville, Illinois and Southern Illinois University. Hairston became a Jehovah's Witness in July 2000.No byline (2001-06-25), \\"Hot Hitter Plays With Fire\\".

She is perhaps best known for her short story \\"Wedding Day\\", which was published in the magazine Fire!! and explores how gender, race, and class dynamics shape an interracial relationship. Bennett was a dedicated and self-preserving woman, respectfully known for being a strong influencer of African-American women rights during the Harlem Renaissance. Throughout her dedication and perseverance, Bennett raised the bar when it came to women's literature and education. One of her contributions to the Harlem Renaissance was her literary acclaimed short novel \\"Poets Evening\\"; it helped the understanding within the African-American communities, resulting in many African-Americans coming to terms with identifying and accepting themselves. Early life and education Gwendolyn Bennett Bennett was born July 8, 1902, in Giddings, Texas, to Joshua Robbin BennettSandra Y. Govan, \\"Gwendolyn Bennett's Life and Career\\", Modern American Poetry. and Mayme F. (Abernethy) Bennett. She spent her early childhood in Wadsworth, Nevada, on the Paiute Indian Reservation. Her parents taught in the Indian Service for the Bureau of Indian Affairs. In 1906, when Bennett was four years old, her family moved to 1454 T Street NW, Washington D.C.,\\"Gwendolyn Bennett\\" profile so Joshua could study law at Howard University and Mayme could train to be a beautician. Gwendolyn's parents divorced when she was seven years old. Mayme gained custody of Gwendolyn; however Joshua kidnapped his daughter. They lived in hiding, along with her stepmother, Marechal Neil, in various places in the East, including Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Brooklyn, New York, where she attended Brooklyn's Girls' High from 1918-21. While attending Girls' High, Bennett was awarded first place in a school wide art contest, and was the first African-American to join the literary and dramatic societies. She wrote her high school play and was also featured as an actress. She also wrote both the class graduation speech and the words to the graduation song. After her graduation in 1921, Bennett took art classes at Columbia University and the Pratt Institute. In her undergraduate studies, her poem \\"Heritage\\" was published in The Crisis, magazine of the NAACP, during November 1923; in December of the same year, \\"Heritage\\" was included in Opportunity, a magazine published by the National Urban League. In 1924, her poem \\"To Usward\\" was chosen as a dedication for the introduction of Jessie Fauset's novel There Is Confusion at a Civic Club dinner hosted by Charles S. Johnson.\\\\--> Bennett graduated from Columbia and Pratt in 1924 and received a position at Howard University, where she taught design, watercolor painting and crafts. A scholarship enabling her to study in Paris, France, at the Sorbonne, was awarded to Bennett during December 1924. She then continued her fine arts education at the Acad√©mie Julian and the √âcole du Panth√©on in Paris. During her studies in Paris, Bennett worked with a variety of materials, including watercolor, oil, woodcuts, pen and ink, and batik, which was the beginning of her career as a graphic artist. However, most of her pieces from this period of her life were destroyed during a fire at her stepmother's home in 1926. Harlem Bennett was a prominent figure and best known for the poetry and writing she produced that had a direct influential impact on the motives and essence of the Harlem Renaissance. Some ideologies that her works brought into perspective include the emphasis of Racial pride and the reminiscence of African values, such as music and dance. One of her most influential poems, Fantasy, not only emphasized the racial pride of African-Americans, but also for women in general by shining light on possibilities that may not have been necessarily attainable for women during this time period. When Bennett left Paris in 1926, she headed back to New York to become the assistant to the editor for Opportunity.\\"Gwendolyn B.Bennett\\", Margaret Busby, Daughters of Africa, Cape, 1992, p. 215. During her time at Opportunity, she received the Barnes Foundation fellowship for her work in graphic design and the fine arts. Her artwork was also used for Crisis and Opportunity covers with themes that included diverse races, ages, classes, and/or genders allowing Bennett to display of the beauty in diversity. Later, during the same year, she returned to Howard University once again to teach fine arts. While assistant to the editor at Opportunity she was given the chance to publish articles discussing topics involving literature and the fine arts, and her column titled \\"The Ebony Flute\\" (1926‚Äì28)\\"Gwendolyn Bennett\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. distributed news about the many creative thinkers involved with the Harlem Renaissance. In 1926, she was also a co-founder and editor of the short-lived literary journal, Fire!!\\"Fire!!!\\", Encyclopedia Britannica, Retrieved 18 October 2018. Conceived by Langston Hughes and Richard Nugent, Bennet served as an editor for the single edition of Fire!!, along with Zora Neale Hurston, John Davis, and Aaron Douglas. The failed publication is now reportedly regarded in some circles as a key cultural moment of the Harlem Renaissance. Finding inspiration through William Rose Bennet‚Äôs poem, \\"Harlem\\", she founded and named her self-proclaimed literary column, ‚ÄúThe Ebony Flute‚Äù, another way in which Bennett was able to impact the Harlem Renaissance. ‚ÄúThe Ebony Flute‚Äù was another contribution that Bennett gave to the Harlem Renaissance, as she emphasized Harlem culture and social life. To keep updated with news, Bennett counted on her network contacts to foster the thriving and diverse environment that the Harlem Renaissance had to offer. Bennett found ways to influence and contribute to her community without even publishing her own assemblage of poetic and literary works. Along with her emphasis on racial pride and literary column, ‚ÄúThe Ebony Flute‚Äù, Bennett also shared a romantic vision of being African through romantic lyric. One way she expressed and shared this vision was through, To a Dark Girl, one of her more famous works of poetry. Creating an empowering aspect to African-American women features, Bennett's imagery and comparisons to queens are used to influence African-American women in embracing their blackness. Bennett admired African-American artists and they made her feel proud to be part of that community, despite experiencing judgement from whites in the past. Although homosexuality was heavily criticized at the time, it had become common for both homosexual and straight female poets to write of lesbianism, and this included Bennett. Female, African-American poets had never before written about this topic, and even though it was considered taboo then, she and many other poets inspired other women to follow in their footsteps several years later. Harlem Circles, created by Bennett, were intended to be a place for writers to gather, share ideas, and spark inspiration. Over a period of eight years, some of the most famous Harlem Renaissance figures, such as Wallace Thurman and Langston Hughes met up in these groups and produced significant works as a result. Criticism Her work during this period of her life was praised by her fellow writers in Harlem. The playwright Theodore Ward declared that Bennett's work was one of the \\"most promising of the poets out of the Harlem Renaissance\\" and also called Bennett a \\"dynamic figure... noted for her depth and understanding.\\" J. Mason Brewer, an African-American folklorist and storyteller, called Bennett a \\"nationally known artist and poetess.\\" Since Brewer was also a native Texan, he further stated that as a result of Bennett's Texas birthplace, \\"Texans feel that they have a claim on her and that the beautiful and poignant lyrics she writes resulted partially from the impression of her early Texas surroundings.\\" Activist and author James Weldon Johnson described Bennett's work as \\"delicate\\" and \\"poignant\\". This was an opportune time for female poets as many of them were not only taken seriously by peers and those in their community, but were also successful. Receiving such positive criticism from other members of the Harlem Renaissance helped Bennett gain recognition. Later life and Harlem influence After marrying Dr. Albert Joseph Jackson in 1927, Bennett resigned from Howard University as the school's administration disapproved of their relationship. That same year, the couple moved to Eustis, Florida. Her time in Florida had a negative impact on her work as it was too far from Harlem to promptly receive news for her to write about in her column for Opportunity. Due to the racism they encountered and their town's financial problems, they remained in Florida for only three years and moved to Long Island in 1930. Bennett began to write more frequently after working with the Federal Writers Project and Federal Art Project. After losing their home in Long Island, Jackson died in 1936, and Bennett moved back to New York. In 1940, she married educator and writer Richard Crosscup, who was of European ancestry. Their interracial marriage was not socially acceptable at Bennett's time. Harlem remained Bennett's passion, however, and during the late 1930s and the 1940s she remained in the arts. She served as a member of the Harlem Artists Guild in 1935, and the Harlem Community Art Center was under her leadership from 1939-44. During this time, she was active on the board of the Negro Playwright's Guild and involved with the development of the George Washington Carver Community School. In 1941, the FBI continuously investigated Bennett on suspicion that she was a Communist and continued to do so on and off until 1959 despite no conclusive or evidential findings. However, this experience caused her to remove herself from the public eye and she began working as a secretary for the Consumers Union. Bennett retired in 1968 and moved with her husband, Richard Crosscup, to Kutztown, Pennsylvania, where they opened an antique shop called Buttonwood Hollow Antiques. Death In 1980, Crosscup died of heart failure, and Bennett herself passed away from cardiovascular complications on May 30, 1981, aged 78, at Reading Hospital in Reading, Pennsylvania. Successes in poetry Throughout Bennett's life, she attained success in different fields of work. Bennett was a poet, short-story writer, columnist, journalist, illustrator, graphic artist, arts educator, teacher and administrator on the New York City Works Progress Administration Federal Arts Project (1935-41). Bennett‚Äôs poems appeared in journals published during the Harlem Renaissance: Crisis, Opportunity, William Stanley Braithwaite's Anthology of Magazine Verse (1927), Yearbook of American Poetry (1927), Countee Cullen's Caroling Dusk (1927), and James Weldon Johnson's The Book of American Negro Poetry (1931). Bennett garnered success with the recognition of these several journals and writers with appreciation of the messages behind her words during this period; the Harlem Renaissance.

It was established on 23 January 2001 by the Government of Canada as a program of Library and Archives Canada.  History  Since the nineteenth century, the Library has gathered an extensive collection of paintings and portraits, almost all of which are in storage in its archives in Gatineau, Quebec. A plan to permanently house the collection in a gallery in Ottawa, Ontario, across the street from the Parliament Buildings, was announced in 2001, and initial plans called for its opening in 2004/2005, but this plan is now defunct. Library and Archives Canada is instead partnering with museums, galleries and other institutions across the country to showcase the collection. The proposed new gallery in Ottawa would have created a public location to display this collection. In the meantime, the Portrait Gallery of Canada is displaying its collection to the public in travelling exhibitions. Its \\"Portraits in the Streets\\" series brought portrait reproductions to urban areas of Canadian cities, including Ottawa, Quebec City, and, in 2010, Vancouver. Renovations and additions were underway until 2006 at the former location of the American Embassy, at 100 Wellington Street in Ottawa. It was intended that this building would house the gallery's collection upon its completion, projected for 2007. However, the project was put on hold in 2006 by the Conservative government, who considered locating the museum in Calgary and for it to be partially funded by the energy company EnCana. In particular, there were discussions with EnCana about including the museum in the company's office tower then under construction in Calgary.\\"EnCana in talks for national gallery: Private funds could bring portrait museum to Calgary;\\" Theresa Tayler. Calgary Herald. Calgary, Alta.: Dec 6, 2006. As of June 2007, construction of additional gallery space had not started, and two weeks later, EnCana announced that the gallery would not be moving into their new office tower in Calgary. A competition for private sector corporations to house the collection attracted bids from Edmonton, Calgary and Ottawa, but that competition was cancelled in November 2008. The idea of locating a gallery outside of Ottawa resulted in a motion before the Senate that would have made it illegal to move the gallery outside Ottawa.Edmonton in bidding for portrait gallery References  External links  * Portrait Gallery of Canada homepage * On-line Portrait Portal (search) Category:Art museums and galleries in Ontario Category:Museums in Ottawa Category:Proposed museums in Canada Category:Art museums established in 2001 Category:2001 establishments in Ontario Category:Portrait galleries Canada Portrait ","title":"Portrait Gallery of Canada"},{"id":"1926528","text":"The Mayo Clinic Health System Event Center is a 5,280-seat (8,200 for concerts) multi-purpose arena in Mankato, Minnesota, built in 1994 and opened in early 1995. It is home to the Minnesota State Mavericks men's ice hockey team and also hosts musical performances, conventions and other events. Prior to its construction, the team played their home games at All Seasons Arena, which is now their main practice facility. Until April 1, 2019, the arena's naming sponsor was Verizon Communications, one of America's major telecommunications companies. Inside the Verizon Center Ice Arena before an NCAA Division 1 Hockey Game between the Minnesota State Mavericks and the Michigan Tech Huskies men's teams The Verizon Center inside before a hockey game event History In the 1992 general election, Mankato voters approved a 0.5% tax increment to support downtown renovations, including construction of a new sports arena. Construction began in 1994, and the facility opened as the Mankato Civic Center in 1995 with a men's hockey event on February 3. The south side of the complex incorporates the restored exterior of the First National Bank of Mankato, a 1913 Prairie School building. In 1999, locally headquartered phone company Midwest Wireless purchased the naming rights, changing the venue's name to the Midwest Wireless Civic Center. In July 2007, the facility's name changed to the Alltel Center following Alltel's acquisition of Midwest Wireless.Alltel Press Release. Alltel. 10 July 2007. Accessed 10 July 2007. Alltel paid $110,000 per year for naming rights. In 2009, the name changed again, this time to the Verizon Wireless Center, after Alltel was acquired by Verizon Wireless. In 2015, an expansion of the facility began with the purchase and demolition of the adjacent US Bank building. Construction was completed the following year, and the additional space with room for up to 2,000 more people opened on September 1, 2016. The name of the new facility was originally intended to be the Event Center, but prior to opening the City of Mankato decided to call it the Performing Arts Center instead to better reflect the anticipated usage primarily for musical and theatrical events. In 2017, Verizon dropped \\"Wireless\\" from the name and the facility became simply the Verizon Center. The Performing Arts Center was also renamed the Grand Hall later in the year. In March 2019, it was announced that Verizon would not be renewing its naming rights agreement. On April 1, 2019, the facility's name reverted to Mankato Civic Center, and remained so through the end of the year. On December 30, 2019, the City of Mankato announced a new naming rights agreement with Mayo Clinic Health Systems effective January 1, 2020. Events Primarily, the Center hosts hockey games, concerts and conventions. Notable past artists and events include Aerosmith, Disney Live, Elton John, James Taylor, Jeff Dunham, John Mellencamp, Kenny Rogers, KISS, Monster Jam, Tom Petty and WWE Live.

He is best known for his abstract colour landscapes.  Biography  Franco Fontana was born in 1933 in Modena. He started taking photographs in the 1950s when he was working as a decorator in a furniture showroom.Colombo, Cesare., Bignardi, Irene, Zannier, Italo, and Fratelli Alinari. Museo Di Storia Della Fotografia. Italy, the One and Only : A Century of Photography, 1900-2000 / Curated by Cesare Colombo ; Texts, Irene Bignardi, Cesare Colombo, Italo Zannier ; with the Collaboration of Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Central Office of Cultural Affairs. Firenze: Alinari, 1998. Print. In 1961 he joined a local amateur club in Modena. The experience would be a turning point in his career, and Fontana went on to have his first solo exhibition in 1965 at the Societ√† Fotografica Subalpina, Turin and at the Galleria della Sala di Cultura in Modena in 1968. Since then he has participated in more than 400 group and solo exhibitions. Fontana has photographed for advertising campaigns for brands such as Fiat, Volkswagen, Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane, Snam, Sony, Volvo, Versace, Canon, Kodak, Robe di Kappa, Swissair, and has been a magazine photographer for publications including Time, Life, Vogue (USA and France), Venerd√¨ di Repubblica, Panorama, and with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and The New York Times. Fontana's first book, Skyline,, was published in 1978 in France by Contrejour and in Italy by Punto e Virgola with a text by Helmut Gernsheim. Fontana is the art director of the Toscana Fotofestival.https://www.intoscana.it/it/articolo/steve-mccurry-al-toscana- foto-festival/ He has received numerous awards, such as the 1989 Tokyo Photographer Society of Japan - The 150 Years of Photography - Photographer Award. Style and Critical Reception Fontana is especially interested in the interplay of colours. His early innovations in colour photography in the 1960s were stylistically disruptive. According to art critic Giuliana Scim√©, Fontana \\"destroyed all the structures, practices, and technical choices within the Italian tradition.\\"Scim√©, G., & Dau, M. (1997). Notes on Italian Photography: Part II: From Futurism to the Present. On Paper, 1(4), 32-35.Duddy, N. (1991). A View on landscape photography. Doctoral dissertation, Bloemfontein: Central University of Technology, Free State. Fontana uses 35mm cameras, and as noted by Iwan Zahar, deploys distant viewpoints with telephoto lenses to flatten contours in a landscape of crops and fields into bands of intense, saturated colour.Zahar, I. (2015). Photo Exemplar Classification: The Integration of Photographic History into Photographic Technique. In International Colloquium of Art and Design Education Research (i-CADER 2014) (pp. 161-172). Springer, Singapore. This is an effect that Franco Lef√®vre has described as 'dialectical landscapism'. Of his use of colour in his 2019 retrospective exhibition Sintesi ('Synthesis') at Fondazione Modena Arti Visive, curator Diana Baldon has observed; > ‚ÄúHis bold geometric compositions are characterised by shimmering colours, > level perspectives and a geometric-formalist and minimal language...By > adopting this approach during the 1960s, Fontana injected a new vitality > into the field of creative colour photography for then multicolour was not > in fashion in art photography...The way Fontana shoots, dematerialises the > objects photographed, which loose three-dimensionality and realism to become > part of an abstract drawing‚Äù. Aside from the rural landscape Fontana has applied his graphic sensibility to other subjects: city architecture, portraiture, fashion, still-life and the nude. Fontana's photographs have also been used as album cover art for records produced by the ECM Records jazz label.

This is in contrast to other parties that defend a determined ideology and seek voters who adhere to that ideology and convince people towards it. Examples =Armenia= Following the 2018 Armenian parliamentary election, the My Step Alliance rose to power on an anti-corruption and pro-democracy platform. The alliance has been described as maintaining a big tent ideology, as the alliance does not support any one particular political position. Instead, it focuses on strengthening Armenia's civil society and economic development. =Australia= The Liberal Party of Australia and its predecessors originated as an alliance of liberals and conservatives in opposition to the Australian Labor Party, beginning with the Commonwealth Liberal Party in 1909. This ideological distinction has endured to the present day, with the modern Liberal Party frequently described as a \\"broad church\\", a term popularised by former leader and Prime Minister John Howard. In this context, \\"broad church\\" is largely synonymous with \\"big tent\\". In the 21st century, the party is often characterised as having a \\"small-l liberal\\" wing and a conservative wing, which frequently come into conflict with each other. The party has historically found strong support primarily from the middle- class, though it has in recent decades appealed to socially conservative working-class voters. =Argentina= From its foundation the Justicialist Party has been a Peronist catch-all party, which focuses on the figure of Juan Per√≥n and his wife Eva. Juntos por el Cambio is an Argentine big tent political coalition. It was created in 2015 as Cambiemos. It is composed of Republican Proposal (center-right), Civic Coalition ARI (centre) and Radical Civic Union (centre-left). =Brazil= The Brazilian Democratic Movement is a centrist and big tent party. =Canada= At the federal level, Canada has been dominated by two big tent parties practicing \\"brokerage politics\\". Both the Liberal Party of Canada and the Conservative Party of Canada (or its predecessors) have attracted support from a broad spectrum of voters.Although parties such as the Communist Party of Canada, the Quebec-Nationalist Bloc Quebecois, among others, have elected members to the House of Commons, far- right, far-left, and separatist politics have never gained a prominent force in Canadian society and have never formed a government in the Canadian Parliament. =Finland= The centre-right National Coalition Party has been described as catch-all party supporting the interests of the urban middle classes. =France= The La R√©publique En Marche! party founded by President Emmanuel Macron has been described as a centrist party with a catch-all nature. =Germany= Both the Christian Democratic Union of Germany/Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CDU/CSU) and the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) are considered big tent or catch-all parties, known in German as Volksparteien (\\"people's parties\\"). =India= The Indian National Congress attracted support from Indians of all classes, castes and religions opposed to the British Empire. The Janata Party which came into power in India in 1977, was a catch-all party which consisted of people with different ideologies opposed to The Emergency. =Ireland= Fine Gael and Fianna F√°il are considered catch-all parties, both being supported by people from different social classes and political ideologies. Both parties are however usually described as being very similar, and are positioned on the centre-right with a liberal conservative ideology. The reason they remain separate is due mainly to historical factors, with those who supported the Anglo-Irish Treaty in the 1920s eventually becoming Fine Gael, and those opposed would join Fianna F√°il and seek an independent Ireland. =Italy= In Italy, the Five Star Movement led by comedian and actor Beppe Grillo has been described as a catch-all, protest party and \\"post-ideological big tent\\" because its supporters do not share similar policy preferences, are split on major economic and social issues and are united largely based on \\"anti-establishment\\" sentiments.Valentina Romei, Five Star Movement: the protest party explained in charts: Direct democracy and rejection of binary politics brings success but stunts maturity, Financial Times (January 10, 2017). The Five Star Movement's \\"successful campaign formula combined anti-establishment sentiments with an economic and political protest which extends beyond the boundaries of traditional political orientations\\", yet its \\"'catch-all' formula\\" has limited its ability to become \\"a mature, functional, effective and coherent contender for government\\". The Northern League attracted voters in its early years from all the political spectrum. Forza Italia on the centre-right and the Democratic Party on the centre-left are considered catch-all parties, both having been formed from mergers of political parties with numerous ideological backgrounds. =Mexico= The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) which held power in Mexico for 71 uninterrupted years from 1929 to 2000 was founded following the Mexican Revolution. Mexican president Plutarco El√≠as Calles founded the PRI, then known as the National Revolutionary Party, in 1929 with the intent of providing a political space in which all the surviving leaders and combatants of the Mexican Revolution could participate, and to solve the grave political crisis caused by the assassination of president-elect √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n in 1928. Throughout its nine-decade existence, the PRI has adopted a very wide array of ideologies (often determined by the President of the Republic in turn). It nationalized the petroleum industry in the 1940s and the banking industry in the 1970s. In the 1980s, the party went through reforms that shaped its current incarnation, with policies characterized as centre- right, such as the privatization of State-run companies, closer relations with the Catholic church, and embracing free-market capitalism and neoliberal policies. The National Regeneration Movement, founded by the current president of Mexico Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador, has often been described as a big tent party due to its various constituents that joined its ranks during the 2018 general elections. =Portugal= The centre-left Socialist Party (PS) and centre-right Social Democratic Party (PSD) have been described as catch-all parties. =Romania= The centre-right Save Romania Union (USR) is considered big tent or catch-all parties. =Spain= Citizens, or simply \\"Cs\\" (Ciudadanos, in Spanish) has been considered as an example of astroturfing in the Spanish media since 2015. Originally founded as a social democratic regional party opposed to Catalan nationalism, it switched to a catch-all message in order to attract votes from the right to the moderate left in its appearance in the national political landscape. Its stance includes a mix of liberalism and pro-Europeanism, but the party has also embraced populist views on the legitimacy of its political opponents, conservative views on topics such as the criminal system and personal property and Spanish nationalist positions without many problems by its own leader, In√©s Arrimadas, becoming one of the most recognisable \\"catch-all\\" parties in the history of the country. In the mid 2010s, however, the party's main ideology is perceived to have drifted towards the right, with Albert Rivera admitting that they would not agree to form a coalition with the two main centre-left and left parties after the 2019 Spanish general elections, regardless of the results. In addition to this, some commentators argue that after the 2019 Spanish general election, Ciudadanos has attempted to become the hegemonic party of the right in the place of the People's Party, which suffered from massive loses in vote percentage and seats in the Congress of Deputies, thus contributing to its shift to the right. Similarly, in the regional parliaments CS has allied with both the People's Party and also with the extreme right-wing party Vox to achieve coalitions. Thus giving rise to the expression \\"the three rights\\" while defining their opposition as \\"the left\\". = South Africa = The African National Congress (ANC) has been the governing party of South Africa since the country's first democratic election in 1994 and has been described by the media as a \\"big tent\\" party. An important aspect of its electoral success has been its ability to include a diverse range of political groups most notably in the form of the Tripartite Alliance between the ANC, the South African Communist Party, and the country's largest trade union COSATU. Additional interest groups included in the party include members of the business community and traditional leaders. =United Kingdom= When Gordon Brown became British Prime Minister in 2007, he invited several members from outside the Labour Party into his government. These included former CBI Director-General Digby Jones who became a Minister of State and former Liberal Democrats leader Paddy Ashdown who was offered the position of Northern Ireland Secretary (Ashdown turned down the offer). The media often referred to Brown's ministry as \\"a government of all the talents\\" or simply \\"Brown's big tent\\". The Brexit Party, founded by Nigel Farage, may be considered a single- issue big tent party as it ran star candidates in the 2019 European Parliament election from across the political spectrum, including former Conservative Member of Parliament Ann Widdecombe and former Revolutionary Communist Claire Fox.Peter Walker, \\"Former communist standing as MEP for Farage's Brexit party\\", The Guardian, 23 April 2019 Both Widdecombe and Fox were elected. In Scotland, the Scottish National Party is possibly the longest established big tent party in the UK, with the goal of seeking Scottish independence by those that support various other political ideologies and from various political positions. Since 2007, the SNP have been the largest single party in the Scottish Parliament and has formed the Scottish Government three times. =United States= The Democratic Party during the New Deal coalition, formed in support of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal policies from 1930s until 1960s, was a \\"big-tent\\" party.David C. King, \\"The Polarization of American Parties and Mistrust of Government\\" in Why People Don't Trust Government (eds. Joseph S. Nye, Philip Zelikow, David C. King: Harvard University Press, 1997). This coalition brought together labor unions, working-class voters, farm organizations, liberals, Southern Democrats, African Americans, urban voters and immigrants.Lisa Young, Feminists and Party Politics (University of Michigan Press, 2000), p. 84.Holly M. Allen, \\"New Deal Coalition\\" in Class in America: An Encyclopedia (Vol. 2: H-P), ed. Robert E. Weir (ABC-CLIO, 2007), p. 571: \\"During the 1930s liberals, labor unions, white ethnics, African Americans, farm groups, and Southern whites united to form the New Deal coalition. Though never formally organized, the coalition was sufficiently cohesive to make the Democratic Party the majority party from 1931 into the 1980s. Democrats won seven out of nine presidential contests and maintained majorities in both houses of Congress from 1932 to 1964. The divisiveness of the Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War, the increasing segmentation of the labor force, and waning influence of unions, and the relative weakness of Democratic Party leadership are among the factors that led to the coalition's erosion in the late 1960s.\\" The Blue Dog Coalition is a big-tent caucus of centrist and conservative Democrats in the House of Representatives, some being socially conservative and fiscally and economically progressive or vice versa. For a brief period following the 2006 and 2008 elections, when Democrats held a majority in the House, this caucus wielded increased influence over the party, but its power declined again after a large majority of its members were defeated or retired in the 2010 election. Its Republican counterpart is the Republican Main Street Partnership. In counter to the New Deal coalition, the Republican Party was for much of its history a \\"big tent\\" party that encompassed a wide range of right-wing and center-right causes, including a wide range of politicians who were fiscally conservative and socially moderate or liberal and vice versa. During the 1970s and 1980s, the Republican party attracted support from wealthy suburban voters in the South and Midwest, Northeastern moderates, Western libertarians, and rural conservatives across the country. From 1968 to 1988, Republicans won five out of six presidential elections, with the only exception being a narrow loss to Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1976. The culture wars of the 1990s and the growing influence of the Christian right within the party prompted the socially moderate and liberal sections of the Republican base, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest, to begin slowly leaving the party in favor of moderate Democrats or independents. As a result, Republicans have lost the national popular vote in six out of seven presidential elections since 1992, while winning narrow Electoral College victories three times. However, moderate Republicans continued to thrive at the state level until the dawn of the 21st century. Following the 1974 Dallas Accord, the Libertarian Party embraced the big tent idea to the extent it ensured that the anarcho-capitalist views would not be excluded from the majority minarchist party.Paul Gottfried, The conservative movement: Social movements past and present , Twayne Publishers, 1993, p. 46.

Hayward Field was named after track coach Bill Hayward (1868‚Äì1947), who ran the Ducks' program from 1904 to 1947. Renovated in 2004, it is one of only five International Association of Athletics Federations Class 1 certified tracks in the United States (along with Hutsell-Rosen Track, Icahn Stadium, John McDonnell Field, and Rock Chalk Park). The elevation of Hayward Field is approximately above sea level and its infield has a conventional north-south orientation. The Pacific Ocean is approximately to the west, separated by the In 2018, the stadium was demolished and will be rebuilt on the same site. Expected to reopen in 2020, the new stadium is financed by UO's philanthropic community, with alumnus Phil Knight as the  Early years  Hayward was built in 1919 to replace Kincaid Field, and was intended to primarily serve the school's football During halftime of the season opener that year, the venue was named for track coach Hayward; he was busy working as the team's trainer during the break, and did not know of the honor until the following day. In 1921, a six-lane cinder track was constructed around the football field. Renowned architect Ellis F. Lawrence designed the west grandstand, which opened in 1925. A natural grass field was first installed at Hayward Field in 1937; the surface was previously a mixture of dirt and sawdust. That field surface was not unique in the Northwest in the Pacific Coast Conference: Bell Field in Corvallis, Multnomah Stadium in Portland, and Husky Stadium in Seattle made similar transitions to natural grass in this period of time. For most of its existence as a football venue, it was notorious for its poor playing conditions in rainy weather. Despite several improvement efforts, the field didn't drain very well even after the switch to grass, and often turned to mud. In 1949, a 28-row grandstand in the south end zone was constructed; with temporary bleachers in adjacent corners, the venue's capacity was raised to 22,500 for football. Even with these changes, by the 1960s, the football team had long since outgrown Hayward Field, which was one of the smallest stadiums in the University Division (forerunner of Division I). Only 9,000 tickets were available to the general public. While nearly every seat was protected from the elements, it had little else going for it. It was in such poor condition that coaches deliberately steered prospective recruits away from it on their visits to Eugene. As a result, outside of the Civil War game with Oregon State, the Ducks played their higher-attended home games (in practice, nearly all of their conference games) at Portland's Multnomah Stadium, away. Athletic director Leo Harris chafed at making the Ducks make the two-hour trip to Portland three times a year, and pressed for a new stadium on land just north of campus. School president Arthur Flemming was initially skeptical of the project, and asked Skidmore, Owings & Merrill to evaluate whether it was feasible to build the stadium on the northern site, expand Hayward Field to up to 40,000 seats (believed to be the minimum capacity for moving the entire home slate to Eugene), or build a new stadium on Hayward Field's footprint. The study definitively ruled out Hayward Field as the site for a new or renovated football stadium. SOM believed that city officials would never sign off on expanding Hayward Field since it hadn't been built to code, and there was no room to build a new stadium on Hayward's footprint. As a result, Hayward Field's final varsity football game was played in 1966, a one-point loss to Washington State on Its replacement, Autzen Stadium, opened in September 1967, and Hayward Field became a facility solely for track and field, except for a few freshman team football games.  Eight lanes  The track was widened to eight lanes late in the summer of 1969 and converted to an all-weather surface that autumn. Its first synthetic track was Pro-Turf, a urethane and sand composite which led to a hard and fast surface; it produced many world records and gained a reputation as the world's fastest track. Light in color, it was resurfaced with the same in 1976.  New west grandstand  Decayed and in disrepair, the original west grandstand was built in 1925 and its roof added demolished in and the finish line (for most events) was moved to the track's northeast corner for the 1974 season. The new west grandstand, also made of wood with a capacity of 4,300 spectators, was ready for use in March 1975. The Prefontaine Classic originated as the \\"Hayward Field Restoration Meet\\" to help raise funds for a new  Metric  The track was converted to metric in the summer of 1987, its lap length changed from to 400 meters, a reduction of . The geometry of the track was changed to the international configuration, with shorter straights and longer turns. This widening of the infield required the relocation of the , 500-ton east grandstand, which was raised and moved east in March. The surface was again Pro-Turf, but with different surface properties; a textured top layer and a reddish color. In addition, a 200 m warmup track was added to the southwest of the main track, along with a new hammer throw area and a weight room facility. A state-of-the-art scoreboard was added in 1991, which gave unofficial times and competitors' placings just seconds after race completion. This project was completed with a great deal of help from the Oregon Track Club as well as the efforts of many others. Bill McChesney SR who is the father of the Oregon 5K record holder and 1980 Olympian, Bill McChesney, was president of the OTC at the time and was one of the key members of the community that made this project possible.  Bowerman Building  Spectators watch the 110 m hurdles After a donation in 1990 by Bill Bowerman (1911‚Äì1999), UO's longtime track coach (1948‚Äì1973), the Bowerman Building was added to the northwest of the track, housing locker rooms, U of O track memorabilia and the university's International Institute for Sport and Human Performance. Bowerman began a public jogging program at Hayward Field in 1963 after a visit to New Zealand, inspired by coach Arthur Lydiard.  Renovation  A major renovation in 2004 added a new entrance named Powell Plaza. It also moved the practice track, expanded it to 400 meters, and replaced the aging fencing bordering the complex. After Hayward Field was awarded the 2008 U.S. Olympic Trials, it underwent additional renovations in 2007. Eight light poles were installed for televised night events, and the crowned infield was removed and reconfigured. A walkway was added behind the west grandstand, and a new scoreboard was installed, thanks to a donation by alumnus Phil Knight and Nike. On April 17, 2018, it was announced that from the summer of 2018 to 2020, Hayward field would undergo a major renovation. The renovation would demolish both current grandstands and establish a new stadium around the track with a capacity of 12,900, expandable to nearly 30,000 for major events.  Major competitions  Hayward Field in 2007 Hayward Field has hosted USATF championships in 1986, 1993, 1999, 2001, 2009, 2011, and 2015 and the Olympic trials in 1972, 1976, 1980, 2008, 2012, and 2016. It has been the site of numerous NCAA championships, USATF Elite Running Circuit events, and the annual Nike Prefontaine Classic. The Olympic trials are scheduled to return in 2021 in the The World Junior Championships, now known as the World U20 Championships, were held at Hayward Field in 2014, and the World Athletics Championships are scheduled for the new stadium In film Hayward Field appeared in a fictionalized staging of the Olympic trials for the 1982 film Personal Best, in the 1998 biography of Steve Prefontaine Without Limits, and Alexi Pappas's Tracktown (2016).

Charles McMahon (May 10, 1953 - April 29, 1975) and Darwin Lee Judge (February 16, 1956 - April 29, 1975) were the last two United States servicemen killed in Vietnam during the Vietnam War. The two men, both U.S. Marines, were killed in a rocket attack one day before the Fall of Saigon. Charles McMahon, 11 days short of his 22nd birthday, was a Corporal from Woburn, Massachusetts. Darwin Judge was a 19-year-old Lance Corporal and Eagle Scout from Marshalltown, Iowa. Deaths McMahon and Judge were members of the Marine Security Guard (MSG) Battalion at the US Embassy, Saigon and were providing security for the DAO Compound, adjacent to T√¢n S∆°n Nh·ª©t Airport, Saigon. McMahon had arrived in Saigon on 18 April, while Judge had arrived in early March. Both died in a North Vietnamese rocket attack on T√¢n S∆°n Nh·ª©t on the morning of April 29, 1975. In accordance with procedures for deceased Americans in Vietnam, their bodies were transferred to the Saigon Adventist Hospital, near Tan Son Nhut. In telephone calls to the hospital on the afternoon of April 29, the few remaining staff advised that the bodies had been evacuated; in fact the bodies were left behind.Major James H, Kean SSN/0802 USMC, After Action Report 17 April ~ 7 May 1975 p. 5 & 8 Operation Frequent Wind, the American evacuation of Saigon, was completed the following day, April 30, 1975. Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, through diplomatic channels, secured the return of the bodies the following year. Judge was buried with full military honors in March 1976 in Marshalltown, Iowa. There was a flag draped coffin, a Marine Honor Guard, and a rifle firing salute. The flag that covered his coffin was folded and presented to his parents. His funeral was so ignored that major and minor media did not attend the event. The lone exception was the Daily Iowan (Iowa City, Iowa). A full set of photographs of the event is available. Due to ignorance of his military funeral in March 1976, Judge was given a second Marine burial honors 25 years later through planning by Douglas Potratz, USMC MSG who served with Judge in Saigon and Ken Locke, boyhood friend and fellow Eagle Scout; Virtual Wall - Darwin Judge, include \\"Home Of Brave\\" by Bob Faw, NBC News, April 28, 2000] retired USMC Lieutenant Colonel Jim Kean, the commanding officer of the Marines during the Fall of Saigon, presented a flag to Judge's parents at a ceremony held at the Iowa Veteran's Home Vietnam War Memorial. 25th Anniversary Observance, Marshalltown, Iowa, Fall of Saigon Marines Association] The Fall of Saigon Marines Association, a California non- profit, public-benefit corporation, was formed to honor the last two Marines to be killed in action in Vietnam. The association sponsors two $500 scholarships for Eagle Scouts attending Marshalltown High School in Marshalltown, Iowa (as a memorial to Eagle Scout Judge). First and last American casualties in Vietnam The first U.S. casualty in Vietnam was Flying Tiger John T. Donovan who was killed on May 12, 1942, but American involvement in Vietnam was not considered official at that time and as such his name does not appear on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. For over 40 years the first American serviceman who died in Vietnam was in controversy. Richard B. Fitzgibbon Jr.'s death in June 1956 was deemed to have taken place before the start of the Vietnam War. However, the family of Fitzgibbon had long lobbied to have the start date changed and their cause was taken up by U.S. Representative Ed Markey (D-MA). After a high level review by the DoD and through the efforts of Fitzgibbon's family, the start date of the Vietnam war was changed to November 1, 1955. The November 1955 date was chosen as the new start date because that was when the Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) in Vietnam was separated out from \\"MAAG, Indochina\\". This was a reorganization of the MAAG into the different countries. With this new date Fitzgibbon became the first person to die in the Vietnam War, Fitzgibbon's name was added to the Vietnam Memorial Wall in 1999. The former first two official casualties were U.S. Army major Dale R. Buis and Master Sergeant Chester Charles Ovnand who were killed on July 8, 1959. While McMahon and Judge were the last American ground casualties in Vietnam, they are not the last casualties of the Vietnam War (a term which also covers the U.S. involvement in Cambodia and Laos) recorded on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial; those names belong to the 18 Americans killed in the Mayaguez Incident.

It can also be demonstrated with other behaviors such as positive word-of-mouth advocacy. Corporate Brand loyalty is where an individual buys products from the same manufacturer repeatedly and without wavering rather than from other suppliers.American Marketing Association Dictionary . Retrieved 2011-07-09. The Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB) endorses this definition as part of its ongoing Common Language: Marketing Activities and Metrics Project . Loyalty implies dedication and should not be confused with habit with its less than emotional engagement and commitment. Businesses whose financial and ethical values, for example ESG responsibilities, rest in large part on their brand loyalty are said to use the loyalty business model. Marketing Brand loyalty, in marketing, consists of a consumer's commitment to repurchase or continue to use the brand. It can be demonstrated by repeated buying of a product, service, or other positive behaviors such as word of mouth advocacy. This concept of a brand displays imagery and symbolism for a product or range of products. Brands can have the power to engage consumers and make them feel emotionally attached. Consumer's beliefs and attitudes make up brand images, and these affect how they will view brands with which they come into contact. Brand experience occurs when consumers shop or search for, and consume products. Holistic experiences such as sense, relation, acting and feeling occur when one comes into contact with brands. The stronger and more relational these senses are to the individual, the more likely repeat purchase behavior will occur. After contact has been made, psychological reasoning will occur, followed by a buy or not-buy decision. This can result in repeat purchase behavior, thus incurring the beginning brand loyalty. Brand loyalty is not limited to repeat purchase behavior, as there is deeper psychological reasoning as to why an individual will continuously re-purchase products from one brand. Brand loyalty can be shortly defined as the \\"behavioral willingness\\" to consistently maintain relations with a particular brand.Aaker, as cited by . In a survey of nearly 200 senior marketing managers, 68 percent responded that they found the \\"loyalty\\" metric very useful.Farris, Paul W.; Neil T. Bendle; Phillip E. Pfeifer; David J. Reibstein (2010). Marketing Metrics: The Definitive Guide to Measuring Marketing Performance. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc. . The Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB) endorses the definitions, purposes, and constructs of classes of measures that appear in Marketing Metrics as part of its ongoing Common Language: Marketing Activities and Metrics Project . True brand loyalty occurs when consumers are willing to pay higher prices for a certain brand and go out of their way for the brand, or think highly of it. Brand loyalty can predict brand performance outcomes. It also highlights the importance of marketing communication when trying to promote a certain product that's not doing as well as other brands. Marketers are able to look at the patterns of brand loyalty and pick out characteristics that make that product thrive. Examples of brand loyalty promotions include My Coke Rewards, Pepsi Stuff and Marriott Rewards. =Long-term impact on business= Brand loyalty in marketing consists of a consumer's devotion, bond, and commitment to repurchase and continue to use a brand's product or service over time, regardless of changes with competitors pricing or changes in the external environment. Brand loyalty reflects a customer's commitment to remain in a relationship for a long period of time with a brand. A critical factor of building brand loyalty is developing a connection or relationship between the consumer and the brand. When an emotional relationship is created between the consumer and the brand this leads to a strong bond and a competitive advantage for that particular brand. Loyalty consists of both attitudinal and behavioral components. Attitudinal loyalty relates to the customers willingness to purchase product or service from the brand at any reasonable cost. Behavioral loyalty is the re-purchasing. Both behavioral and attitudinal components are important. One example is that a consumer displays behavioral loyalty by buying Coke when there are few alternatives available and attitudinal loyalty when they will not buy an alternative brand when Coke is not available. The attitudinal component is psychological, this leads to the behavioural action of repeat purchase. It is the attitudinal loyalty that drives most loyalty behavior and ensures loyalty over time not just with one purchase. ‚ÄúBrand loyalty is desired by firms because retention of existing customers is less costly than obtaining new ones. Firms profit from having loyal customers‚Äù. =Benefits= Brand loyalty has shown to profit firms by saving them a lot of money. Benefits associated with loyal consumers include: * Acceptance of product extensions. * Defense from competitors cutting of prices. * Creating barriers to entry for firms looking to enter the market. * Competitive edge in market. * Customers willing to pay high prices. * Existing customers cost much less to serve. * Potential new customers. Generally speaking, brand loyalty will increase profit over time as firms do not have to spend as much time and money on maintaining relationships or marketing to existing consumers. Loyal long-term customers spend more money with a firm. Customer behavior Brand loyalty is more than simple repurchasing. Customers may repurchase a brand due to situational constraints (such as vendor lock-in), a lack of viable alternatives, or out of convenience. Such loyalty is referred to as \\"spurious loyalty\\". Previous studies showed that customer loyalty is affected by customer satisfaction, but the association differs based on customer switching costs (procedural, relational, and financial). True brand loyalty exists when customers have a high relative attitude toward the brand which is then exhibited through repurchase behavior. This type of loyalty can be a great asset to the firm: customers are willing to pay higher prices, they may cost less to serve, and can bring new customers to the firm. For example, if Joe has brand loyalty to Company A he will purchase Company A's products even if Company B's are cheaper and/or of a higher quality. From the point of view of many marketers, loyalty to the brand ‚Äî in terms of consumer usage ‚Äî is a key factor. However, companies often ensure that they are not spending resources to retain loyal but unprofitable customers. Usage rate Most important is usually the 'rate' of usage, to which the Pareto 80-20 Rule applies. Kotler's 'heavy users' are likely to be disproportionately important to the brand (typically, 20 percent of users accounting for 80 percent of usage ‚Äî and of suppliers' profit). As a result, suppliers often segment their customers into 'heavy', 'medium' and 'light' users; as far as they can, they target 'heavy users'. However, research shows that heavy users of a brand are not always the most profitable for a company. Loyalty A second dimension, is whether the customer is committed to the brand. Philip Kotler, again, defines four status of loyalty:Kotler, P. & Keller, K.L., 2016. Marketing management / Philip Kotler, Kevin Lane Keller. 15 [ed.], Global., Harlow. # Hard-core Loyals - who buy the brand all the time. # Split Loyals - loyal to two or three brands. # Shifting Loyals - moving from one brand to another. # Switchers - with no loyalty (possibly 'deal prone', constantly looking for bargains or 'vanity prone', looking for something different). Again, research shows that customer commitment is a more nuanced a fine-grained construct than what was previously thought. Specifically, customer commitment has five dimensions, and some commitment dimensions (forced commitment may even negatively impact customer loyalty). Psychological reasoning Line of people waiting for the iPhone 3G outside of the Apple Store in New York City, 2008. Humans are attracted to certain brands due to each individual psychological make up. Cognitive responses can be matched with brand personalities. Brand personalities are broken down into 5 categories of traits: sincerity, ruggedness, competence, sophistication and excitement. Consumers are usually drawn to brands because the brand will strongly convey one of these traits, and that trait will resonate in the individual consumers mind. These traits are matched to the five psychological factors that the consumers are influenced by. These are the perception, learning, motivation, and beliefs and attitudes. In relation to brand loyalty, the most important factors are beliefs and attitudes. A belief that one might hold can be based on real knowledge, faith or opinion and have the ability to carry an emotional charge. Consumers use these beliefs to form a brand image in their minds, and marketers try to either change or enhance people's beliefs to draw them to their brand. Marketers can advertise messages such as ‚Äòno added sugar‚Äô and then if this statement resonates in the consumers mind, they will believe that this brands beliefs matches theirs. Beliefs that consumers hold against brands can also be false, as word of mouth, false advertising and so forth can create false impressions. Marketers will try to counteract these negative beliefs so the consumer feels like they hold similar beliefs as the brand. Attitudes can be based on brand salience and accessibility. Consumers make constant evaluations on every aspect of their lives and these make up attitudes. Ones attitude is usually difficult to change, so marketers try to fit their brands and products into categorical attitudes. Each time a consumer makes contact with a brand (through advertising and promotion), they reflect on their attitudes to make judgements and decisions about that particular brand. If a person's attitude coincides with what a brand is trying to convey, the consumer will put the brand into a ‚Äòliking‚Äô category in their mind. The consumer will then be more likely to increase involvement with this brand, and because attitudes are difficult to change, the chances of brand loyalty occurring are increased. Other advertising techniques such as comparative advertising have shown to increase the brand attitudes one might have. When a brand praises a competitor, rather than using a negative comparison, consumers are shown to have more positive brand attitudes, therefore drawing them to the brand. Brands may advertise themselves in ways that have nothing to do with their product, but using emotional influences that they know the average consumer will engage with. For example, using religion, world peace, love, death, children and many more symbols that humans can feel sentimental about will attract consumers to their brand Through advertising, marketers are beginning to focus more on implicit emotional messages, rather than the actual content or information about their brand. Consumers take notice of campaigns, and a wave effect can occur, due to the relational sense of the campaign to the common person's emotions. Once an emotional hold has taken force, consumers are more likely to be able to recall the brand than consumers who have been subject to a large amount of content information. Because of this increased level of recall, brand loyalty is more likely to occur, as the brand name is resonating in the consumers mind due to a feeling of emotional attachment. Furthermore, consumers are willing to pay more for a product that has a brand name that resonates with them emotionally. = High VS Low Involvement Consumers = Buying decisions from consumers can be dependent on their level of involvement with the product or brand. Brand loyalty can stem from whether the consumer is highly or lowly involved with the brand. High involvement consumers interact with brands and products that are important to them, are risky or expensive and products that people who are important to the consumer have strong opinions on. High Involvement consumers will usually progress through complex buying behavior to decide whether they want to purchase a product whose brand greatly differs from others. This involves gaining knowledge of the product, specifications and attributes, and furthermore creating attitudes that lead to the buyer's decision. Similarly, dissonance-reducing buying behavior occurs in the same situation, but instead with brands they see little differences between. This process consists of consumers finding purchase convenience, attractive pricing, and shopping around. High involvement consumers search for more product attributes and engage in more product related activities, such as searching for more information on a product and researching the brands background. This engagement makes consumers aware and knowledgeable of the brands attributes, so therefore they can shape behavioral brand loyalty, as the consumer feels that they know the brand well. Low involvement consumers take on the habitual buying behavior or variety seeking behavior. These processes occur when a consumer is purchasing fast moving goods and requires a low product involvement level. Habitual behavior occurs when the consumer doesn't see large differences between brands; so therefore don't search for information. Consumers usually purchase on the basis of advertising or promotion creating familiarity. The attitudes formed by being exposed to advertisements and promotions are what can cause brand loyalty to occur. The limited amount of information processing and lack of cognitive work done to assess each brand can mean that these consumers stick with a brand simply because it is less work. Low involvement consumers are using short-cut evaluations so a known brand name that they haven't thought deep enough to find faults in will be an easy buy-decision for them. Habitual buying behavior can result in brand loyalty subconsciously. The consumer isn't actively aware they want to purchase repeatedly from a particular brand, it is just in their habitual nature to do so. Alternatively, low involvement consumers who are using variety seeking behavior see differences between brands and tend to do a lot of switching. To attempt to persuade these consumers into habitual buying behavior, marketers will try to dominate shelf space, cut prices or introduce new products. If a low involvement consumer continues to use variety-seeking behavior, brand loyalty is unlikely to be established. Factors influencing brand loyalty Loyalty includes some degree of predisposition toward a brand. It is determined by several distinct psychological processes, and it entails multivariate measurements. Customer perceived value, brand trust, customer satisfaction, repeat purchase behavior, and commitment are found to be the key influencing factors of brand loyalty. Commitment and repeated purchase behavior are considered as necessary conditions for brand loyalty followed by perceived value, satisfaction, and brand trust. Fred Reichheld, one of the most influential writers on brand loyalty, claimed that enhancing customer loyalty could have dramatic effects on profitability. However, new research shows that the association between customer loyalty and financial outcomes such as firm profitability and stock-market outcomes is not as straightforward as was once believed. An organization's ability to attract and retain customers is vital to its success. Customer loyalty requires a strong appetite by the customer for a product. Marketing tools such as integrated marketing communications (IMC) and branding can be used in ways to increase perceived attraction between the consumer and the brand. These tools are used to boost emotional response and attachment to the brand, as well as to influence feelings the customer has for a brand, both are important for congruency and a relationship, this in turn leads to the development of brand loyalty. Relationship development and maintenance can also be achieved through the use of loyalty programs or a celebrity endorser. These can help to increase a bond between a brand and a consumer. IMC is defined as ‚Äúintegrating a variety of convincing messages across various forms to communicate with and develop relationships with customers‚Äù. IMC can be used to convey the brand image, increase awareness, build brand equity, and achieve shared values between the consumer and the brand. = IMC and brand loyalty = IMC and branding are both relevant marketing tools for increasing the brand loyalty of consumers. The decisions made around communications and branding should be based on solid and factual market research about the consumers. If the brand or the IMC do not seem to be relevant to the target market, consumers will not pay attention. An example of this is that high customization, creativity and a more direct voice is recommended for messages directed towards generation Y consumers as generation Y want to be treated differently from the rest of the market and marketers should acknowledge this. Loyalty programs help to reward and encourage customers, which is a necessary factor for customers to want to repurchase. The consumer should feel a connection with the brand to want repeat purchase and portray other brand loyalty behaviors such as positive word of mouth. ‚ÄúA loyalty program is an integrated system of marketing actions that aims to make member customers more loyal to a brand‚Äù. The main goal of a loyalty program is to create or enhance customer loyalty towards a brand whilst being sustained even after a loyalty program is discontinued. Thus, to an extent a loyalty program motivates customers to change their behavior. The reason for marketers to use such tactics as a loyalty program is to increase likelihood of repeat purchase and retrieve vital information about the spending habits of the consumer. Loyalty programs that enhance the consumer's opinion about how much the firm can offer them may be essential for building a relationship. Even though these programs can cost a lot of money, they help to create a relationship between the brand and the consumer. An example of a loyalty program is a simple point system. Frequent customers earn points or dollars, which transform into freebies, discounts, rewards or special treatment of some sort, customers work toward a specific number of points to redeem their benefit. Celebrity endorsers moderate the relationship between the consumer and the brand by personifying the brand to match the perceptions of the consumer themself. Using a celebrity endorser can facilitate a relationship built between consumers and a brand because endorsers can represent similarities between themselves and the consumer, and themselves and the brand. Celebrities are used to make marketing tactics more convincing and marketing communications more effective. An example is that a celebrity may be influential to a generation Y consumer because that generation views them as likeable, real and beautiful. In order for celebrity endorsers to effectively reach the audience, they must connect and identify with the audience. The use of a popular celebrity endorser could personalize the brand for the consumer and create the relationship between the consumer and the brand. To ensure endorsement is successful the celebrity should match the brand and the consumer. The effect of using a celebrity endorser that consumers look up to and want to emulate can lead to increased congruence between the values of the consumers and the brand, and improve the relationship between the two. Industrial markets In industrial markets, organizations regard the 'heavy users' as 'major accounts' to be handled by senior sales personnel and even managers; whereas the 'light users' may be handled by the general sales force or by a dealer. Portfolios of brands Andrew Ehrenberg, then of the London Business School said that consumers buy 'portfolios of brands'. They switch regularly between brands, often because they simply want a change. Thus, 'brand penetration' or 'brand share' reflects only a statistical chance that the majority of customers will buy that brand next time as part of a portfolio of brands they prefer. It does not guarantee that they will stay loyal. Influencing the statistical probabilities facing a consumer choosing from a portfolio of preferred brands, which is required in this context, is a very different role for a brand manager; compared with the ‚Äî much simpler ‚Äî one traditionally described of recruiting and holding dedicated customers. The concept also emphasizes the need for managing continuity. Issues When brands are well established and have a decent flow of consumers, problems may arise such as slips in product quality, safety of products and lack of customer care. These problems can be detrimental to a brand that has become too confident as they can be publicly exposed and reputations can be ruined. On the contrary, many brands continue to get away with scandals, and it does not affect their image in any way. For example, the Coca-Cola brand has been involved in scandals including murders in Colombia, crimes in India and various health dangers; all relating back to the company name. The power that this brand holds is the fact that Coca-Cola is the top in its field and has a hold over competitors. The reputation of such a massive organization is hard to dent with the powerful distribution rights and funds to create some of the best ad campaigns. Stability One of the most prominent features of many markets is their overall stability ‚Äî or marketing inertia. Thus, in their essential characteristics they change very slowly, often over decades ‚Äî sometimes centuries ‚Äî rather than over months. This stability has two very important implications. The first is that those who are clear brand leaders are especially well placed in relation to their competitors and should want to further the inertia which lies behind that stable position. This, however, still demands a continuing pattern of minor changes to keep up with the marginal changes in consumer taste (which may be minor to the theorist but will still be crucial in terms of those consumers' purchasing patterns as markets do not favor the over-complacent). These minor investments are a small price to pay for the long term profits which brand leaders usually enjoy. The second, and more important, is that someone who wishes to overturn this stability and change the market (or significantly change one's position in it), massive investments must be expected to be made in order to succeed. Even though stability is the natural state of markets, sudden changes can still occur.

It was followed by various sequels released for the PlayStation and other platforms. The story focuses on a human brought to File City on File Island by Jijimon to save the island. Digimon have been losing their memories and becoming feral and the city has fallen into disarray. The goal of the player, who is represented by an unnamed young boy, is to save the island by helping Digimon recover their memory and return to the city. Gameplay The player's Agumon ends a battle with an enemy Agumon. The gameplay revolves around raising a single Digimon from its egg form, hatching into a Fresh, up through In-Training, Rookie, Champion, and with work, Ultimate. A Digimon partner will \\"fade away\\" with age, and return to an egg eventually, so the player has to raise it again. To raise a Digimon partner, the player must train it, feed it, let it rest, and take it to bathrooms. Training is done to increase the Digimon's stats to make it stronger in battle. Raising a Digimon well will result in the Rookie Digimon \\"Digivolving\\" into a Champion form with better stats, while not training or raising it well will cause it to Digivolve into Numemon, a Champion Digimon with inferior stats and skills. The other main part of gameplay is battle. The player's partner Digimon fight the Digimon that have become aggressive due to a crisis on File Island, and some will calm down and work at the city when defeated. Partner Digimon begin the game with a few basic skills, but acquire more as they progress in levels through the game. The player cannot control the actions of an unintelligent Digimon, but as it gets smarter more control over its actions is given to the player. More Digimon working for the city will make training and various other aspects of the game much easier. Many will open shops and even sell items, some which will open playable mini-games for gaining rewards and items. Plot The game revolves around a young boy (the player can name the protagonist in the beginning of the game), the protagonist, who is drawn into the Digital World through his V-Pet device. Jijimon greets and asks him a few questions, the answers to which determine whether he begins with an Agumon or Gabumon. His goal is to travel around File Island, locating all of the resident Digimon of File City who have turned feral and bring them back, raising Digimon partners in the process. He must train his Digimon and battle his way through all of Digimon World until the once sparsely populated city is flourishing with different Digimon from all of Digimon World. He must eventually go to Infinity Mountain (the final location) to confront the antagonist, Analogman, and the mega Machinedramon, and save the Digital World from destruction. Development Developer and publisher Bandai (now Bandai Namco Entertainment) used an extensive marketing campaign to compete with Nintendo's Pok√©mon media franchise, specifically the video games Pok√©mon Red and Blue. A promotional Digimon trading card was offered to the first 100,000 North American customers to purchase the game. The game was officially announced in conjunction with Digimon World 2 in May 2000, before either's release. Reception Digimon World received a 23 out of 40 total score from editors of Japanese Weekly Famitsu magazine, and went on to sell approximately 250,000 copies in the region by February 2000. The English version sold enough copies to qualify as a Greatest Hits title in North America, and Platinum Range in Europe, but received mixed reviews from critics, earning a 52.55% average on GameRankings. GamePro magazine criticized the game's \\"tinny\\" music and sound effects, as well as the largely uncontrollable nature of its combat system, recommending it only for \\"a hardcore Digimon fan\\". GameSpot's Miguel Lopez likewise stated that \\"Digimon World isn't for everyone ‚Äì only dedicated Digimon fans or fans of the monster- raising genre need apply,\\" but found the graphics pleasing, declaring that \\"despite its disassociating play focus, no one can deny that Digimon World is a nice-looking game.\\" IGN's David Zdyrko offered a similar opinion on the game's visuals, stating \\"There's nothing revolutionary being done here [...] but it still can be classified as a good looking videogame,\\" but found the game's battle system unfulfiling. Legacy The game was followed by various sequels released for the PlayStation and other platforms, though they do not retain all the gameplay elements found in the original. In addition, despite being localized as such, Digimon World DS, Digimon World Dawn and Dusk, Digimon World Data Squad, and Digimon World Championship aren't official games in the series. Digimon World Re:Digitize was first announced in July 2011, in an issue of V-Jump, as the first Digimon game for the PlayStation Portable. The game was announced to be developed by Japanese video game developer Tri- Crescendo, The original premise of Re:Digitize was to call back to the first Digimon World game; unlike the sequels. Digimon World: Next Order was announced in the July 2015 issue of V-Jump. It was originally released for PlayStation Vita and published by Bandai Namco. A trailer was released on July 31 and featured clips from the original Digimon World before showcasing its gameplay. It is based on the concept of an ‚Äúevolving world,‚Äù and like Re:Digitize, the player takes control of the main character travels alongside a Digimon partner. The first partners to be revealed were Agumon and Gabumon.

A flash cartridge is one of several cartridges containing flash memory that have been developed for use in video game consoles. These cartridges enable homebrew applications and games to be used. The capacity of the cartridges can range from 64 Mbit up to 8 Gbit (Commercial carts range from 32 Mbit to 256 Mbit). More recent cartridges use external memory cards as memory, in place of onboard memory, such as Compact Flash, Secure Digital, etc. memory cards. These cartridges remain the best-known way to create and distribute homebrew games for many consoles, such as the Game Boy Advance. (another option in this case being the GBA Movie Player, which can run specially designed homebrew programs but cannot run illicit copies of commercial GBA Game cartridges due to the lack of onboard RAM for fast data access).  Linkers  Extreme Flash Advance, USB port built-in Games are written to the cartridge with a device called \\"linker\\". Depending on the brand of flash cartridge, the linker either connects to a link port on the console and writes to the cartridge through the console, or connects to a mini-USB slot on the cartridge itself and writes directly to the flash cartridge. These linkers usually connect to a PC through a USB or parallel plug on the other end. Most linkers that connect to a link slot are capable of copying ROM information from commercial software cartridges. Some more recent flash cartridges use digital media cards (SD, MMC, CF, etc.) in which files are placed via a memory card reader.  Flash card adapters  A number of devices have been released which use popular flash memory cards such as SD and CF for storage. These have proven popular since the development of techniques to run Nintendo DS software from a GBA cartridge, due to the smaller size of DS games and the low price of these cards compared to conventional GBA flash cartridges. Examples of such devices include the M3, R4 and Supercard.  Software  There are those that use a program called LittleWriter to write games to the cartridges. However, some people (especially people with older computers) use other software to write games to the cartridge. An example of this software is X-ROM Frontend by DanSoft Australia. Some flash cartridges use specialized software designed for the specific cartridge, such as Power Writer and USB Writer software for the Flash2Advance Ultra cartridges. This presents several conflicts in regard to homebrew, as Power Writer uses a large database for proper naming and saving of games. ROMs that are not in the database (such as emulators or any other GBA homebrew) are prone to saving issues, and editing the database manually is difficult and involves the use of a hex editor. Such cartridges often have a proprietary interface, making it difficult or impossible to use operating systems other than Microsoft Windows for writing to the cartridge with a few exceptions.  Other Nintendo flash cartridges  Flash cartridges are also available for other Nintendo consoles, such as the DS, DSi, and the 3DS. The DSi and the 3DS have the ability to update their system firmware via the Internet, which makes it possible for Nintendo to fix the exploit that allowed the flashcarts to work, and essentially block the flashcart from loading on the console. There are also project files existing on the Internet that guide people through creating their own flash cartridge for the original Nintendo Game Boy.http://www.digital- circuitry.com/DOC/NINTENDO/GAMEBOY/DIY%20Nintendo%20GAMEBOY%20Classic%20Flash%20Cartridge.pdf  Legality  The legality of flashcarts has been called into question many times, primarily by Nintendo. In a 2010 high court case, the court ruled in Nintendo's favour, and flashcarts were outlawed in the United Kingdom.  Official flash cartridges  Some game consoles have official flash cartridges (and official emulators) used by developers to test prototypes of their games. These cartridges are usually part of the console's software development kit and are only available to licensed developers.

In June 2000, he was elected vice-Chairman of the St. Petersburg Legislative Assembly and, in 2001, entered the Federation Council of Russia as a representative of St. Petersburg. In December 2001, Sergey Mironov was elected to be a Speaker of the Federation Council. Since February 2003, Sergey Mironov has been the Chairman of the Council of Inter-Parliamentary Assembly of States ‚Äì members of the Commonwealth of Independent States and since April 2003 ‚Äì Chairman of the Russian Party of Life. Sergey Mironov is from Saint Petersburg. Mironov was a candidate in the 2004 presidential election. He was not considered to be a serious candidate and was quoted as saying: \\"We all want Vladimir Putin to be the next president.\\" He polled less than one per cent of the vote. In October 2006, he became the leader of the new left-wing opposition party A Just Russia (–°–ø—Ä–∞–≤–µ–¥–ª–∏–≤–∞—è –†–æ—Å—Å–∏—è), which was formed by uniting Rodina, Mironov's Russian Party of Life, and the Russian Pensioners' Party. This effectively makes him the leader of the opposition as the three parties together would be stronger than the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. Mironov has several times proposed an amendment to the Russian constitution that would allow the President to be elected for 3 consecutive 5 or 7 year terms. In 2007, Boris Gryzlov, leader of the rival United Russia party, said that changing the constitution would be unacceptable. Mironov is considered to be more socialistic oriented, as he pushes for setting up special agricultural exchanges for state purchases of agricultural goods and for more state intervention in regulating prices of basic food stuff. In the March 2012 presidential election, he received 3.86% of the votes. In March 2014, Mironov was included in list of Russian government sanctioned individuals because of their direct or alleged indirect involvement in the 2014 Crimean crisis.http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/03/17/fact-sheet- ukraine-related-sanctions On 25 July 2014, amidst an armed insurgency in Eastern Ukraine, the Ukrainian Interior Ministry launched criminal proceedings against Mironov for alleged financial support to the armed insurgents.Specially Designated Nationals List (SDN)  Personal  Sergey Mironov during a visit to Poland in 2010 Third wife: Mironova Irina Yurievna ‚Äì officer apparatus to the Interparliamentary Assembly of the CIS.

Electoral history =2004 presidential campaign= Mironov ran for president in the 2004 presidential election as the nominee of the Russian Party of Life. His candidacy was seen largely as a ploy to lend credence to the contest, as he was widely known to be a strong supporter of Vladimir Putin.

It is based on the macroinvertebrate species (such as freshwater shrimp, freshwater sponges, worms, crayfish, aquatic snails, freshwater mussels, insects, and many others) found at the study site during sampling. Some of these species are tolerant to pollution, low dissolved oxygen, and other stressors, but others are sensitive; organisms vary in their tolerances. Therefore, different species will usually be found, in different proportions, at different river sites of varying quality. Some organisms are especially good indicator species. The species found at the reference sites collectively make up the species assemblage for that site and are the basis for a statistical comparison between reference sites and non-reference sites. The comparison between the expected species and the observed species can then be used to estimate this aspect of the ecological health of a river. The system is meant to be standardized, easy to use, and relatively low cost. It can complement other types of water quality monitoring such as chemical monitoring. RIVPACS supports the implementation of the Water Framework Directive as its official tool for macroinvertebrate classification Reference sites can be chosen and adjusted several ways. Usually they represent the best conditions within the region or area under study, and are a short stretch of river. Sometimes the reference site expectations are adjusted for degradation of the entire region by human impact. 'Pristine' freshwater sites are sampled to collect information on physical characteristics, chemistry, and macroinvertebrates, sometimes several times each year. This information is then used to predict what invertebrates are present from samples of physiochemistry from other sites. RIVPACS is used across the UK and supported by Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Countryside Council for Wales, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Natural England, Environment Agency, Northern Ireland Environment Agency, Freshwater Biological Association, Scotland and Northern Ireland Forum for Environmental Research, Scottish Environment Protection Agency, Scottish Government, Scottish Natural Heritage, South West Water, and Welsh Assembly Government. This classification of freshwater sites based on the macroinvertebrate fauna was first derived in 1977. Since then it has been developed and updated with addition of a wider range of freshwater sites. It has been adapted into various other versions around the world, including a Canadian version known as CABIN, AUSRIVAS in Australia, MEDPACS in Spain, and others.

Derivation Goldman's equation seeks to determine the voltage Em across a membrane. A Cartesian coordinate system is used to describe the system, with the z direction being perpendicular to the membrane. Assuming that the system is symmetrical in the x and y directions (around and along the axon, respectively), only the z direction need be considered; thus, the voltage Em is the integral of the z component of the electric field across the membrane. According to Goldman's model, only two factors influence the motion of ions across a permeable membrane: the average electric field and the difference in ionic concentration from one side of the membrane to the other. The electric field is assumed to be constant across the membrane, so that it can be set equal to Em/L, where L is the thickness of the membrane. For a given ion denoted A with valence nA, its flux jA‚Äîin other words, the number of ions crossing per time and per area of the membrane‚Äîis given by the formula : j_{\\\\mathrm{A}} = -D_{\\\\mathrm{A}} \\\\left( \\\\frac{d\\\\left[ \\\\mathrm{A}\\\\right]}{dz} - \\\\frac{n_{\\\\mathrm{A}}F}{RT} \\\\frac{E_{m}}{L} \\\\left[ \\\\mathrm{A}\\\\right] \\\\right) The first term corresponds to Fick's law of diffusion, which gives the flux due to diffusion down the concentration gradient, i.e., from high to low concentration. The constant DA is the diffusion constant of the ion A. The second term reflects the flux due to the electric field, which increases linearly with the electric field; this is a Stokes‚ÄìEinstein relation applied to electrophoretic mobility. The constants here are the charge valence nA of the ion A (e.g., +1 for K+, +2 for Ca2+ and ‚àí1 for Cl‚àí), the temperature T (in kelvins), the molar gas constant R, and the faraday F, which is the total charge of a mole of electrons. Using the mathematical technique of separation of variables, the equation may be separated : \\\\frac{d\\\\left[ \\\\mathrm{A}\\\\right]}{-\\\\frac{j_{\\\\mathrm{A}}}{D_{\\\\mathrm{A}}} + \\\\frac{n_{\\\\mathrm{A}}FE_{m}}{RTL} \\\\left[ \\\\mathrm{A}\\\\right]} = dz Integrating both sides from z=0 (inside the membrane) to z=L (outside the membrane) yields the solution : j_{\\\\mathrm{A}} = \\\\mu n_{\\\\mathrm{A}} P_{\\\\mathrm{A}} \\\\frac{\\\\left[ \\\\mathrm{A}\\\\right]_{\\\\mathrm{out}} - \\\\left[ \\\\mathrm{A}\\\\right]_{\\\\mathrm{in}} e^{n_{\\\\mathrm{A}}\\\\mu} }{1 - e^{n_{\\\\mathrm{A}}\\\\mu }} where Œº is a dimensionless number : \\\\mu = \\\\frac{F E_{m}}{RT} and PA is the ionic permeability, defined here as : P_{\\\\mathrm{A}} = \\\\frac{D_{\\\\mathrm{A}}}{L} The electric current density JA equals the charge qA of the ion multiplied by the flux jA : J_{A} = q_{\\\\mathrm{A}} j_{\\\\mathrm{A}} Current density has units of (Amperes/m2). Molar flux has units of (mol/(s m2)). Thus, to get current density from molar flux one needs to multiply by Faraday's constant F (Coulombs/mol). F will then cancel from the equation below. Since the valence has already been accounted for above, the charge qA of each ion in the equation above, therefore, should be interpreted as +1 or -1 depending on the polarity of the ion. There is such a current associated with every type of ion that can cross the membrane; this is because each type of ion would require a distinct membrane potential to balance diffusion, but there can only be one membrane potential. By assumption, at the Goldman voltage Em, the total current density is zero : J_{tot} = \\\\sum_{A} J_{A} = 0 (Although the current for each ion type considered here is nonzero, there are other pumps in the membrane, e.g. Na+/K+-ATPase, not considered here which serve to balance each individual ion's current, so that the ion concentrations on either side of the membrane do not change over time in equilibrium.) If all the ions are monovalent‚Äîthat is, if all the nA equal either +1 or -1‚Äîthis equation can be written : w - v e^{\\\\mu} = 0 whose solution is the Goldman equation : \\\\frac{F E_{m}}{RT} = \\\\mu = \\\\ln \\\\frac{w}{v} where : w = \\\\sum_{\\\\mathrm{cations\\\\ C}} P_{\\\\mathrm{C}} \\\\left[ \\\\mathrm{C}^{+} \\\\right]_{\\\\mathrm{out}} + \\\\sum_{\\\\mathrm{anions\\\\ A}} P_{\\\\mathrm{A}} \\\\left[ \\\\mathrm{A}^{-} \\\\right]_{\\\\mathrm{in}} : v = \\\\sum_{\\\\mathrm{cations\\\\ C}} P_{\\\\mathrm{C}} \\\\left[ \\\\mathrm{C}^{+} \\\\right]_{\\\\mathrm{in}} + \\\\sum_{\\\\mathrm{anions\\\\ A}} P_{\\\\mathrm{A}} \\\\left[ \\\\mathrm{A}^{-} \\\\right]_{\\\\mathrm{out}} If divalent ions such as calcium are considered, terms such as e2Œº appear, which is the square of eŒº; in this case, the formula for the Goldman equation can be solved using the quadratic formula.

The Canadian Provost Corps was authorized on 15 June 1940.The Regiments and Corps of the Canadian Army (Queen's Printer, 1964) The Canadian Provost Corps was amalgamated into the Canadian Forces in 1968. Canadian Military Police Corps During the early years of World War I, Regimental Police were the only police element in the Canadian Army. The situation was such that the 2nd Canadian Division made its brigades responsible for the provision of \\"Trench Police\\" to perform traffic control duties. The Canadian Military Police Corps was formed during October 1917, with a total of 850 all ranks. The CMPC school was formed at Ottawa on 1 June 1918, and closed ten months later on 11 March 1919. The CMPC itself was disbanded on 30 June 1920. Royal Canadian Mounted Police At the outbreak of World War II, the Canadian Army was without any form of military police. On September 13, 1939, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) requested and received permission to form a Provost Company using volunteers from its ranks. This was designated 1 Provost Company (RCMP), of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division, Canadian Active Service Force. Initially, it was 120 men; many of them were in the UK by the end of 1939. Second World War In mid June 1940, the Canadian Provost Corps was officially born out of 1 Provost Company. For most of 1940, 1 Provost Company was stationed in England, but was involved in the battles during the fall of France (Brest, Laval, Sable and Chateaubriant). The Canadian Provost Corps Training Centre operated from November 1942 to May 1946, training a total of 1,897 all ranks. During World War II, most of the Canadian Army in England was stationed at Aldershot. Canadian MPs wore red-topped caps and were armed with .38 revolvers carried in a holster on the left hip together with white pattern 1937 web belt, brace and brace attachment in the same manner as the British Corps of Military Police (CMP). Lance-Corporal N.G. Rosborough of the Canadian Provost Corps talking to members of the Belgian Resistance in Bruges during the Battle of the Scheldt; September 1944 The corps saw action for the first time on 18 August 1942 in the Dieppe Raid. Of the 41 members who took part, 22 returned to England, one was killed, eighteen were taken prisoner (seven of them being wounded). During 1943, 1 Provost Company became involved in operations in Sicily (Pachino, Valguarnera, Assoro, Agira, Adrano and Regalbuto) and after the crossing into Italy on 3 September 1943, the company continued its support of the I Canadian Corps as part of the Eighth Army as Allied forces crept northwards from the toe of Italy. Places where 1 Provost Company saw action included: Campobasso, Torella, Motta Montecorvino, San Leonardo, The Gully, and Ortona in 1943; San Nicola, San Tommaso, Cassino II, the Gustav Line, the Liri Valley, the Hitler Line, and Got Lamone Crossing in 1944; and Misano Ridge, Rimini Line, San Martino, San Lorenzo, and Fosso Vecchio in 1945. In the Cassino area of Italy, the Canadian Provost assisted the British CMP on \\"Highway 6\\", where 11,000 vehicles were handled every day. The Canadians were part of twenty-four provost and traffic control companies and two Special Investigation Branch sections that were attached to the Eighth Army. Shortly after the Normandy landings in June 1944, the 2nd Canadian Line of Communications (LoC) Provost HQ and six sections were deployed in Northern France on traffic control duties. 1 Provost Company also saw action at Apeldoorn in the Netherlands. On 18 October 1945, 1 Provost Company was de- activated when it was repatriated to Canada. By September 1945, the C Pro C numbered 6,120 men. Postwar history The Canadian Provost Corps School was formed at Camp Borden in the late 1940s, and by 1948 there were at least ten Provost Companies, including five Militia Provost Companies, in the Canadian Army. 25 Provost Detachment headed to Korea in 1950, where it formed part of 1 Commonwealth Division Provost Company (\\"1 COMWEL Div Pro Coy\\"). It was stated in the Standing Orders of this unit that it was the only integrated unit of its kind in the Allied Forces. In 1955, the Provost Detachment was disbanded after a total of 264 Canadian MPs had served in Korea. From 23 November 1951, the 27th Brigade Provost Detachment was located in Hanover, West Germany with NATO. In November 1958, the 4 Canadian Infantry Brigade Group rotated into Germany and the Provost Platoon in Germany was renamed No.4 Provost Platoon. During 1968, the platoon was renamed 4 Military Police Platoon and was located at Canadian Forces Base Lahr until the pull out of 4 Canadian Mechanised Battle Group (CMBG) in 1992. In March 1964, the United Nations authorized a force to serve on the island of Cyprus. Members of the Military Police served on Cyprus from that time until Canada pulled out in 1992. On 1 February 1968, the Provost Corps ceased to exist, when all branches of the Canadian military were unified into the Canadian Forces and security became the responsibility of the Canadian Armed Forces Security and Intelligence Branch.

The character is not from the main reality where stories are set in the Marvel Universe, but from an alternate universe.(See Sidebar) Publication history The character was created by Roy Thomas and John Buscema, and debuted as a member of the team of superheroes called the Squadron Supreme in The Avengers #85 (Feb 1971) as American Eagle, then as Cap'n Hawk in The Avengers #148 (June 1976), and finally as Blue Eagle in Squadron Supreme #1 (Sept 1985). Fictional character biography James Dore Sr. operated during World War II under the persona of American Eagle, outfitted with a pair of wings which he obtained through unknown means. During this period, he was allied with other heroes such as Power Princess and Professor Imam as members of the Golden Agency. At an unspecified time after the war, he had retired, was married and sired a son years later. James Dore Jr., who was born in Mayflower, Freedonia on his Earth, was an airplane mechanic. He began his career as a superhero when he inherited the mantle of the American Eagle from his father and joined the Squadron Supreme. With the Squadron Supreme, he encountered the Avengers Goliath II, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch, and the Vision.Avengers #85 Eventually Dore abandoned the American Eagle identity after a falling out with his father over political differences, and adopted the identity of Cap'n Hawk. Alongside the Squadron Supreme, he battled the Avengers on behalf of the Serpent Cartel, and then turned against the Cartel when their hold on him was broken.Avengers #148 Alongside the Squadron and Thor, he battled Emil Burbank and the evil Hyperion.Thor #280 Alongside the Squadron, he was mind-controlled by the Overmind. Cap'n Hawk and the Squadron were used as pawns in the Overmind's conquest of Earth-712. The Squadron members were freed by the Defenders, and the two teams battled and defeated the Overmind and his ally Null, the Living Darkness.Defenders #112-115 The Squadron Supreme, as a result of their conflict with the Overmind, instituted the \\"Utopia Program\\". They assumed control of Earth-712's United States, and publicly revealed their true identities.Squadron Supreme #1 James again adopted another identity after his father died from a heart attack. Using a costume made by his dead father, he took the name Blue Eagle. With the Squadron, he battled a group of rebel soldiers at Fort Largo.Squadron Supreme #4 The Squadron then battled the Institute of Evil.Squadron Supreme #5 Dore then discovered that the Golden Archer had used the Behavior Modification Device on Lady Lark, and called for the Archer's dismissal from the team.Squadron Supreme #6 Blue Eagle was captured by Nighthawk's Redeemers and placed under Master Menace's Behavior Modification machine.Squadron Supreme #11 Blue Eagle recovered and returned to the Squadron, just in time for the Redeemers' attack on Squadron City. During the battle, Blue Eagle killed the Black Archer with his mace, but lost the use of his wings after Lamprey drained the artificial gravity effect from them. Blue Eagle fell and crashed into Pinball, breaking his neck and the back of Pinball. Both Blue Eagle and Pinball died immediately and were placed in cryostasis until they could be revived and their injuries repaired.Squadron Supreme #12 Blue Eagle's wings were later adopted by fellow Squadron member Lady Lark, as she had grown to love Dore shortly before his death. Lady Lark later changed her codename to Skylark. After a period of time when the surviving members of the Squadron Supreme had returned to Earth-712 from their forced exile, they found the government of Earth combined to create an armed force of Blue Eagles to patrol and keep the populace docile. These troops would be opposed by the Squadron along with the Eagle's opposite number, the Nighthawks. Powers and abilities Blue Eagle wears a specially designed flying suit of synthetic stretch fabric equipped with artificial wings on his back enabling natural winged flight, that was designed by his father James Dore Sr. (the original American Eagle) and his mother Adrian Dore. These wings had a \\"anti-gravity effect\\" that allowed Dore to fly. =Equipment= The Blue Eagle costume could be enhanced with a shield, light armor, and a protective helmet. Other versions A version of Blue Eagle appears in Supreme Power, a modern revamp of the Squadron Supreme, in the possible future timeline of the Supreme Power: Hyperion mini-series. Dore was highly skilled in hand-to-hand combat, specializing in aerial combat. He demonstrated a wide range of skill with ancient melee weapons.

Career =Early life= At the age of four Neben survived a bout of spinal meningitis, which left her in a coma for three days. Doctors told her parents that she was unlikely to survive, and that if she did, she would probably have endured brain damage and have lost her hearing. Neben played soccer and ran cross-country in junior high and high school. She attended the University of Nebraska on a track and cross-country scholarship. Stress fractures stopped her running and she became an undergraduate assistant coach in distance running. She took up cycling after graduating from college with a Bachelor of Science degree in biology. She then obtained a master's degree in biology from the University of California, Irvine, having originally commenced studies for a PhD. Whilst she was at UC Irvine she scored a top 10 finish at the national collegiate cycling championships, which persuaded her to exit with her master's degree and focus on professional cycling. =Professional career= She concentrated first on mountain biking but her greatest success was on the road. She won the Rupert to Pomerelle stage of the 2001 Women's Challenge race with its long, steep climb to the finish, the fourth American to win a stage at the Women's Challenge since it became a UCI event. She then concentrated on road cycling and was picked for the road world championship team in 2001 and 2002. Neben raced again in 2004. She missed placing first by eight seconds in the time trial selection race for the Olympic Games. In spring 2005, she won the Tour de l'Aude in France. She won again in 2006. She was picked for the 2008 U.S. Olympic team and came 33rd in the road race event in Beijing. Later in 2008 she became the World TT Champion. Neben made the 2012 U.S. Olympic team for the Women's road race, along with Kristin Armstrong, Shelley Olds and Evelyn Stevens. In the Women's time trial she finished 7th. Doping suspension Neben tested positive for the banned substance 19-Norandrosterone on May 31st 2003, after she won the Coupe du Monde Montreal World Cup race. The test results were not confirmed until after her \\"A\\" sample and \\"B\\" sample both returned 6.9ng/ml, which is above the 5ng/ml cutoff. Neben appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport [CAS] and accepted a provisional suspension from mid-July 2003. Neben said the positive test came from contaminated supplements. As she was a member of the T-Mobile Women's Cycling Team, a trade team owned by USA Cycling, she enlisted USA Cycling top management as witnesses in her defense. Sean Petty, VP of Marketing of USA Cycling, Gerard Bisceglia, CEO for USA Cycling, Steve Johnson, COO and Director of Athletics for USA Cycling, Bob Stapleton, Vice Chair for T-Mobile USA all testified on her behalf. The North American CAS ruled in October 2003 that doping had occurred but that it was not intentional. Neben was suspended, in a split decision, for six months, starting from the provisional ban beginning on July 13, 2003. The ruling also stated that all competitive results which occurred on or after May 31,2003 were cancelled. Therefore, her win at the Coupe du Monde Montreal on May 31st was cancelled, but not her Elite Women's Road Race National Title, which occurred on May 22nd. She would have to be tested for drugs regularly for the following 18 months.https://www.usada.org/wp- content/uploads/arbitration_ruling_10_21_2003_Neben.pdf Personal life She is married to Jason, an assistant professor of education at Concordia University Irvine.

The Anatomy of Revolution at Fifty.\\" Journal of Peace Research, Vol. 26, No. 4, November 1989, pp. 421‚Äì431. Born in Winsted, Connecticut, his family soon moved to Springfield, Massachusetts, where he grew up and attended the public schools there before entering Harvard University in 1915. His excellent academic performance enabled him to win a Rhodes Scholarship to attend Oxford University, receiving a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in 1923. Brinton then began teaching at Harvard University that same year, becoming full professor in 1942 and remaining at Harvard until his death.Columbia Encyclopedia entry on Brinton He was McLean Professor of Ancient and Modern History from 1946 to 1968. For many years he taught a popular course at Harvard known informally to his students as \\"Brunch with Brinton.\\" Brinton was known for his witty, convivial, and urbane writing and commentary,Reviews of Brinton's History of Western Morals and was fluent in French. During World War II he was for a time Chief of Research and Analysis in London in the Office of Strategic Services.Reference to Brinton's work for OSS He was also Fire Marshal for St. Paul's Cathedral in London, which withstood the Blitz with minor damages. After the war, he was commended by the United States Army for \\"Conspicuous Contribution to the Liberation of France\\" and was chairman of the Harvard Society of Fellows in the late 1940s.\\"Education: Good Fellows\\". Time, May 3, 1948. Membership during that period included McGeorge Bundy and Ray Cline, who would go on to become quite influential in national security and intelligence. In the early 1960s Brinton was the dissertation supervisor at Harvard of the young historian Will Johnston.Stackelberg, Roderick. Memory and History: Recollections of a Historian of Nazism. 2011. p. 88. He also served as an advisor for historian Elizabeth Eisenstein, author of The Printing Press as an Agent of Change. In 1963 Brinton was elected president of the American Historical Association. He was also president of the Society for French Historical Studies. On February 19, 1968 Brinton testified at the Fulbright Hearings on the Vietnam war as to the nature of the Vietnamese opposition, saying that Americans are sympathetic to a revolution but not a Communist one, and that if Ho Chi Minh had not been a Communist, \\"The whole story would have been different.\\".\\"Brinton Teaches Senators Lesson About Revolution.\\" The Harvard Crimson, February 20, 1968.

The district also borders the Independencia, San Mart√≠n de Porres, and San Juan de Lurigancho districts. Vestiges of Lima's colonial heyday remain today in an area of the R√≠mac district known as the Historic centre of Lima, which was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1988.

It began airing in 1981 as Towards 2000, then in 1985 was renamed Beyond 2000, a name the show kept until its cancellation in 1999. It then started airing again in 2005 with the name Beyond Tomorrow. Towards 2000 and Beyond 2000 Towards 2000 debuted on the ABC in 1981 as a half-hour show dedicated to showcasing developments and inventions in science and technology. Original presenters were Jeffrey Watson, Sonia Humphrey and David Flatman. There were four series of the program (1981, 82, 83 and 84) and it was a popular and high rating success on the national broadcaster. After production finished on the 4th series, the ABC decided not to continue with Towards 2000, and instead started up a new science program, named Quantum, under the newly appointed Dick Gilling from BBCTV. The Towards 2000 reporters then spoke with Ted Thomas, General Manager of ATN 7, who agreed that his network could start a new hour long production and name it Beyond 2000, airing until 1993 when it was picked up by Network Ten, airing until 1999. Beyond 2000 was also broadcast internationally, airing on the Discovery Channel in the United States and Canada, on RT√â in the Republic of Ireland, and on the satellite channel Sky News in Europe and on TV One in New Zealand. An American-produced version of the show also aired on the Discovery Channel in 1992, with an American presenter (Henry Tenenbaum, presently an anchor/reporter for television station KRON San Francisco) used for the studio segments. An American version entitled Beyond Tomorrow was hosted by newsman Dave Marash and aired in the early years of the Fox television network. Fourteen series of Towards/Beyond 2000 were produced, with the last being made in 1999 as a one-off, after a production break of about four years. At this point, the rising cost of producing the series, coupled with increased competition from other science and technology shows forced the closure of the program. A Beyond 2000 website was published by the same company between 1999 and 2003. This provided science and technology news, as well as video clips from the old TV shows. The website was eliminated in a round of company-wide budget cuts that reflected a general downturn in the Australian media industry at the time. =Presenters= * Sonia Humphrey * Iain Finlay * Jeff Watson * David Flatman * Carmel Travers * Chris Ardill-Guinness * Simon Reeve * Amanda Keller * Andrew Carroll * Maxine Gray * Anthony Griffis * Dr Caroline West * Dr John D'Arcy * Simon Nasht * Sharon Nash * Bryan Smith * Tracey Curro * Andrew Waterworth * American versions were presented by Henry Tenenbaum, Dave Marash and Susan Hunt. Beyond Tomorrow Beyond Tomorrow logo In 2005, Beyond 2000 returned to the Seven Network under the new name of Beyond Tomorrow. The first episode aired 1 June 2005. Picking up where its predecessor left off, Beyond Tomorrow delves even deeper into the world of technological innovations and scientific breakthroughs. Topics range from how probes planted in the brain can now be used to battle Parkinson's disease and obsessive compulsive disorder, to how the grumpiness of North Sea oil workers has led to a cure being found for snoring. Segments from MythBusters, another Beyond Television production, also air as part of the program (criticised by Australian viewers because Beyond Productions also sold Mythbusters to SBS, both shows airing almost at the same time slots, with the Beyond Tomorrow version redubbing the American narrator with an Australian narrator and calling them \\"Beyond Tomorrow's Mythbusters\\", some viewers feeling the company was insulting their intelligence by doing this double dip into the Australian market). The hour-long magazine style episodes feature breakthroughs in all areas of life including the environment, medicine, sport, computers, space, agriculture, transport, architecture, leisure and adventure. Beyond Tomorrow airs in the US on The Science Channel and on Discovery Channel Canada; The series has been criticised by some fans of the earlier Beyond 2000 for featuring 'futuristic' technologies that are obsolete or have been in common use for several years. The theme music was also criticised for not being on par with Beyond 2000's, some calling it lazy, generic and bland. The official website is no longer up.

Ginny Mule was involved with producing four independent films, each featuring McKinnon and Goggins onscreen. Blount appeared in Ginny Mule's first three films, but died in 2010. Ginny Mule first produced the black comedy short The Accountant, written and directed by McKinnon, about a ruthless and hard drinking accountant (McKinnon) who appears to help two family farmers (Goggins and Eddie King); the film received an Academy Award for Live Action Short Film after qualifying at the Atlanta Film Festival. The company then created Chrystal, starring Billy Bob Thornton as an Arkansas ex-convict returning home after imprisonment to rekindle the relationship with the wife he left behind. McKinnon was nominated for the Grand Jury prize at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival for his writing and directing the film, while Blount was recognized by the 2004 Stockholm International Film Festival jurors as Best Actress for her portrayal of the title character.

Presumptive nominee  In United States presidential elections, the presumptive nominee is a presidential candidate who is assumed to be their party's nominee, but has not yet been formally nominated or elected by their political party at the party's nominating convention.Sabato, Larry; Ernst, Howard R. Wiessler, David (March 4, 2008) \\"Factbox: Presidential political terms\\", Reuters. Ordinarily, a candidate becomes the presumptive nominee of their party when their \\"last serious challenger drops out\\" or when the candidate \\"mathematically clinches‚Äîwhichever comes first. But there is still room for interpretation.\\"Nathaniel Rakich, \\"What Makes a Presidential Nominee 'Presumptive'?\\", The New Republic (May 3, 2016). A candidate mathematically clinches a nomination by securing a simple majority (i.e., more than 50 percent) of delegates through the primaries and caucuses prior to the convention. The time at which news organizations begin to refer to a candidate as the \\"presumptive nominee\\" varies from election to election. The shift in media usage from \\"front-runner\\" to \\"presumptive nominee\\" is considered a significant change for a campaign. In the modern era, it is the norm for the major political parties' nominees to be \\"clear well before the conventions\\"; in the past, however, some conventions have begun with the outcome in doubt, requiring multiple rounds of balloting to select a nominee. The last major party conventions with more than one ballot for president occurred in 1952 for the Democrats and 1948 for the Republicans.

It is the second installment of the Robot Romance Trilogy, which also includes Ch≈çdenji Robo Combattler V and T≈çsh≈ç Daimos. It is directed by Tadao Nagahama and produced by Yoshiyuki Tomino. It aired on TV Asahi from June 4, 1977 to March 25, 1978. Voltes V's themes all revolve around rebellion, specifically the French Revolution, and also social issues such as social stratification and racial discrimination. Despite moderate success in Japan, the series was extremely popular in the Philippines, Cuba and Indonesia. In the United States, this super robot along with the other two aforementioned super robots first appeared in the late 1970s as a part of Mattel's Shogun Warriors line of imported toys. An upcoming 2020 Filipino live-action television series adaptation, titled Voltes V: Legacy, is currently in pre- production under Philippine television network GMA, to be directed by Mark A. Reyes. Plot 14,000 light-years from Earth in a stellar system in the Scorpio Cluster, lies the planet of Boazan. Their social system revolves around oligopolistic politics by the nobles, with a caste system. Those with horns are considered noble and have high status, while the hornless are treated as slaves. But when La Gour is about to ascend to the throne, he was exposed as hornless by his ambitious bastard cousin Zu Zambajil and enslaved by the empire. La Gour led a rebellion against the empire, but his ragtag troops of former slaves were simply no match against the superior might of the Boazanian military. His desperate comrades sacrificed themselves in order for him to board their last remaining space saucer, leading him to planet Earth. He was found wounded and unconscious near his ship's wreckage by a local woman, Mitsuyo Go, who he later marries. Fearing Zambajil's interplanetary conquest ambitions, La Gour, who now goes by the name Professor Kentaro Go, collaborated with his wife as well as premier Earth scientist Professor Hamaguchi and Earth International Defense Force commander General Oka to design and construct the ultimate defense against the potential incoming Boazanian invasion. Ten years later, the Boazanians had finally invaded Earth under the orders of Prince Heinel and launches their \\"beast fighters\\" all over the world, defeating most of the world's armed forces. In order to fight back and to honor Kentaro's wishes who had vanished, Professor Hamaguchi gathered the three children of Kentaro: Kenichi, Daijiro and Hiyoshi alongside two new members: Ippei and Megumi at the fortress island base \\"Camp Big Falcon\\". While not an easy task, they were tasked to pilot Kentaro's latest creation and humanity's final hope: \\"Voltes V\\" in order to repel back the impending Boazanian invasion, and for the Go Siblings; to find out the whereabouts and mysteries surrounding their father. Characters =The Voltes Team= ; : :The Leader of the Voltes Team. Born on June 22, he is an 18 year old marksman, a Motocross champion, an ace pilot, and the eldest of the three Go brothers. During his younger years, Kenichi used to behave like a typical playful child and was prone to mischief, but the long absence of his father molded him into a more responsible son and older sibling. Stern and selfless, he is rarely one to indulge in personal pursuits that might be detrimental to their cause and he often decides on the best course of action in most of the team's numerous predicaments. Due to his headstrong temperament and unwavering resolve, Kenichi often clashes with the more cynical Ippei which often results in fierce fisticuffs but the two share no ill will and eventually get along better. Aside from his exceptional marksmanship and formidable barehanded fighting skills, Kenichi is also quite adept with the use of swords (he can hold his own against Heinel, an accomplished swordsman). His uniform is red and he pilots the (Head). ; : :Born on November 24. Ippei is an 18-year-old rodeo champion, who was orphaned while still a young boy. His mother died trying to save him from a pack of wolves. After his mother's death, he grew bitter, aloof, but cool under crisis. He learned how to live in the streets and perform odd jobs. This kind of life strengthened his personality. Upon joining the rodeo, he learned to ride horses and how to use a whip. He found his greatest friend in a white stallion known as . The two, man and beast, became inseparable. He won two rodeo championship contests with Eiffel as his horse. Then one day, the Earth International Defense Force asked Ippei to join the team. When he refused, he was taken forcibly, so for the first time, Ippei and Eiffel were separated. Dr. Hamaguchi has Eiffel brought to Big Falcon early in the series and he has a rivalry with Kenichi. His uniform is blue and he pilots the (Arms). ; : :Born on November 18, Daijiro is the second oldest of the Go brothers and a 17 year old defense tactician. He was once a playful child, but Daijirou's outlook in life suddenly changed when his father disappeared. Alarmed by this change in his personality, Mrs. G≈ç sent him to live in the country where a martial arts master taught him different fighting styles and forms of meditation. Upon rejoining his brothers, Daijirou was already a master of different hand-to-hand fighting styles. The B≈ç became his favorite weapon. Together with Kenichi and Hiyoshi, Daijirou started training as a member of the Voltes V Team. His uniform is dark green and he pilots the (Body and Chest). ; : :Born on October 20, Hiyoshi is the youngest of the Go brothers and a 10 year old a genius in inventing automatons. He has been interested in learning mechanics, robotics, and electromagnetism since a very young age. He was considered a genius by many university professors. He even created a funny little octopus-robot called Tako-chan. But to his big brothers, Kenichi and Daijirou, Hiyoshi will always be a little brother, a child who never felt the warmth and love of a real father. He also excels in swimming and diving. Because of his exceptional talents, Hiyoshi was asked to join the Voltes V Team as a technical handyman, specifically for repairs during field operations. His uniform is light green and he pilots the (Legs). ; : :Megumi is a 16 year old kunoichi and the 18th heir of the K≈çga-ry≈´ ninja, Born on May 17. Megumi received special training during her childhood. By the age of 13, she already possessed extraordinary skills and lightning reflexes. She also learned gentle arts from her mother. Through her mother's guidance, Megumi became a person with a calm yet alert disposition. Joining the Voltes V Team, she was the voice of reason among the male members, especially whenever Kenichi and Ippei were about to clash during personal conflicts. Her cool demeanor and uncanny skills qualified Megumi as the fifth (and only female) member of the Voltes V team. Her uniform is yellow with pink accents and she pilots the (Feet). =Allies= ; / : :The father of the three G≈ç brothers and a former Boazanian Royal. Being the son of the emperor's brother, La Gour was born as a royal-blooded Boazanian noble but he was unfortunately born without horns. Due to this abnormality, his parents made him wear fake horns in order to avoid stigma and scandal. The aging current emperor at the time lacked a legitimate male heir, so despite La Gour's undisclosed imperfection, the latter was still groomed to be next in line to the Boazanian throne. The horned elites' extreme prejudice and severe maltreatment of the hornless slaves struck a chord in young La Gour's psyche and he vowed that one day he will bring forth justice and equality between the two classes. Gifted with an extremely brilliant scientific mind, La Gour's academic excellence and unwavering work ethic eventually earned him the title of Boazania's Chief Science Minister; the majority of the planet's technological advancements (particularly in regards to the military sciences) can be attributed to his efforts. He got betrothed to a horned noblewoman named Lozaria and during their honeymoon he revealed his fake horns to her. His wife told him that he was still the man she chose to love and the couple was overjoyed. :Moments before being crowned as the new emperor, La Gour's secret was finally publicly divulged by his jealous and ambitious bastard cousin, Zu Zambajil. He was branded a traitor, stripped of his title, separated from his wife and imprisoned. Lozaria later dies during childbirth while the helpless La Gour could only weep in mourning behind bars. With the aid of the rebels he was able to escape from prison. He then led a rebellion against the empire, but his ragtag troops, formerly enslaved, were simply no match against the superior might of the Boazanian military. His desperate comrades sacrificed themselves in order for him to board their last remaining space saucer, leading him to planet Earth. He was found wounded and unconscious near his ship's wreckage by a local woman, a scientist named Mitsuyo Go, who he later marries. Fearing Zambajil's interplanetary conquest ambitions, La Gour (who now went by the name Professor Kentaro Go) collaborated with his wife, as well as premier Earth scientist Professor Hamaguchi and Earth International Defense Force commander General Oka to design and construct Voltes V, his greatest creation and the ultimate defense against the potential incoming Boazanian invasion. After the birth of their third and youngest son, Hiyoshi, Professor Kentaro Go tearfully left his newfound home and family; he returned to Boazania as a diplomat in a peaceful effort to put an end to the cruelty and tyranny of the now current reigning emperor, Zambajil. Instead of listening to Professor Go's appeal of non-violence towards other planets, the ruthless monarch offered his long lost cousin a high ranking position as lead designer of Boazania's interplanetary war machine. Disgusted by how vile and despotic Zambajil had become, Professor Go vehemently refused and was therefore incarcerated. :Throughout the events of the series, his sons are figuring out his disappearance and also his origins, which is also tied to the invasion of the Boazanians on Earth. After the brothers finally found him in Boazan, he and the rebels assisted with the Voltes Team in order to take down Zu Zambajil's rule. Throughout the end of the series, it is revealed that he is also the father of Prince Heinel; making him a half-brother of the three Go brothers. After the rebellion, he is crowned as the new ruler of Boazan. ; : :The human wife of Professor Kentaro Go and the mother of the three Go children. She met La Gour when he escaped Boazania and crash-landed on Earth. She later married La Gour and, as a scientist herself, assisted him in creating Voltes V. She raised her children on her own when her husband left, and continued to care for them until her death. She sacrificed herself to help Voltes V when it was under the mercy of a beast fighter. ; : :The former commander of Camp Big Falcon fortress at the beginning of the series. Regarded as planet Earth's top scientist, he helped design and build the Voltes V robot alongside his good friend Professor Kentaro G≈ç. Due to his friendship with their absentee father, Professor Hamaguchi is somewhat of a father figure to the Voltes team, especially to the three Go brothers. Despite appearing to be an old man, he is very capable of defending himself; Boazanian soldiers who were trying to seize him failed when they were met with his vicious roundhouse kicks. Professor Hamaguchi acted as the commander of Camp Big Falcon on Professor Go's behalf until he was killed after sacrificing his life to save the Voltes team. ; : :Megumi's father and the 17th heir of the K≈çga-ry≈´ ninja. He is one of the co-designers of Voltes V, and commander of the Earth International Defense Force. On the verge of retirement due to ill health; he dies late in the series saving his daughter from a Boazanian beast fighter that had the power to control people's minds. ; : :The recent commander of Camp Big Falcon after Hamaguchi's death. Sakunji, a former student of Hamaguchi, is called upon to take over command of Big Falcon. He is a hard- nosed commander who continually pushes the Voltes V Team to their limits during training, sometimes to the point of risking their lives. Although he first appeared cruel, he has also shown his soft side as the series went through, especially that he was concerned about the people of the Earth more than anything else. ; : :A Boazanian colleague and ally of Doctor Kentaro Go. He was a member of Boazanian nobility, and military general until he deliberately broke his horns, because he \\"believed in equality and decided to fight for it\\" and joined the rebellion against Emperor Zambajil. When Dr. G≈ç returned to Boazania, he freed him from capture and escaped with him to Earth, along with a handful of rebels. He assisted Voltes V by piloting the \\"Mechanical Eagle\\" and installing new weapons upgrade components during the battle. En route to Camp Big Falcon, he was attacked by a beast fighter and was mortally injured. However, just before he died, he managed to tell Kenichi, Daijir≈ç, and Hiyoshi of their father and their Boazanian origins. ; : :Another Boazanian colleague and ally of Doctor Kentar≈ç G≈ç who escaped with him to Earth. He is the leader of the Boazanian refugees/rebels on Earth and helped G≈ç construct the Solar Bird, a giant spaceship that is designed to be the partner for space travel for Camp Big Falcon. After G≈ç was re-captured by General Gururu, he led the Voltes team and Camp Big Falcon to Boazania to launch the final attack on Emperor Zambojil and his regime. =The Boazanian Nobility= ; : :The series' main antagonist, Zu Zambajil is the emperor of Boazania who is extremely racist, cruel, and selfish, but ultimately a coward. The son of the previous emperor and his mistress, he overtook the throne when he revealed the \\"hornlessness\\" of his cousin, La Gour. Driven by greed and the desire for conquests, he ordered his people to create beast fighters as a tool to expand his empire further. His ambition knew no bounds: Under his rule, horned and hornless alike who dared oppose him were imprisoned, enslaved, and executed. He sent Prince Heinel, the son of La Gour, to Earth, as a means of removing a perceived threat to his rule. As time wore on, he sent others to pretend to aid Heinel while spying on him. When Voltes V and the Big Falcon reached Boazania, the people rebelled against him and the few still loyal to him turned against him and fled. He met his end when, while trying to escape with a wagonload of riches, he was found by Prince Heinel, who killed him in repayment for betraying his planet and people. ; : :The half-brother to the Go brothers from their father's side. He was born the son of a traitor, and is bitter and a noble villain. As a child, he had a rough time being called a traitor's son, with no memory of his parents and only loved by his grandparents. He wanted to clean that stain, but being a possible heir makes his second-degree uncle Zambajil hate him secretly and was hesitant to appoint him. Though first shown as a villain and using dirty tactics, he is later shown to have noble qualities like playing fair at times, in contrast to most of his comrades who prefer to use cheating methods; like most Super Robot princes that would eventually succeed him. Graduating as best student at the Institute of Military Science and Warfare, He has a high sense of honor, like most warriors and regards himself more of a soldier than a prince. Due to his repeated failures, his second-degree uncle Zambajil removed him from duty. Prince Heinel sought to restore Boazan to glory; after all, he was only a scapegoat, and he would rather die in battle than die a loser. He later realized that he was fighting against his own father and his own half- siblings. His mother was Lozaria, the Boazanian wife of La Gour/Kentaro who died after giving birth to him. When he saw Zambajil try to escape, he threw a dagger to kill the despotic Emperor to redeem himself. In the end, he died a redeemed man, enjoying a few moments of peace having saved his younger half- brother Kenichi's life. ; : :Prince Heinel's aide and would-be lover, born on May 5. Motivated by love, she remained loyal to her prince until the end, when she took a sniper's bullet, saving his life. As she died, she confessed her love to him, and he realized that he loved her as well. ; : :The three-horned General sent to Earth with Prince Heinel and Katharine. Fiercely loyal to Heinel while also a wise strategist, he is the one who convinced Heinel, and himself, that the Go Brothers are actually part Boazanian. He later chose death over surrender to the Voltes team. ; : :A one-horned, aged, hunchback, toothless scientist, one of Prince Heinel's original aides. His invention of the Anti-Super Electromagnetic Device nearly destroyed Voltes V. Cunning and contemptuous, he discreetly captured Prof Go just before he returned to Earth and attempt to use him for his plans to kill Heinel and Voltes V. Eventually, his attempt to betray Heinel failed and he was executed. ; : :The second general sent by the Emperor, sent by Emperor Zambojil to keep an eye on Prince Heinel and kill him if necessary. He kept his identity concealed most of the time with a blank mask. Upon arrival, he created a combat beast with a special alloy called Maxingal, the same alloy used for his armor, which was supposedly impervious to Voltes V's weapons and sword. Using this alloy, he intended to defeat Voltes V and take over Heinel's position, but lost and became Zuhl's replacement under Heinel. Since his arrival, all beast fighters constructed has Maxingal as standard armor but they're still no match when Voltes V upgraded its sword with the Ch≈çdenji/Superelectromagnetic Ball. Along with Gururu, he betrayed Heinel and attempted to blew up Earth with a Magmite Bomb. During the battle to liberate Boazan, he died when the starship he and Gururu were on was destroyed by Voltes V. ; : :The head of the Boazanian Military and the last commander sent to Earth. He re-captured Lagour/Prof G≈ç and betrayed Heinel with Bergan. Overconfident, he was killed during the liberation of Boazan. ; : :The chief inspector of Emperor Zambajil, and one of the few who knew about Zambajil's betrayal of La Gour and the Boazanian throne. He is well known to deliver bad news to the emperor from his scouting, thus many executions ordered by the Emperor was a result of his reports. Zambajil sent him to Earth to report on Heinel's progress, but discreetly wanted him to ensure Heinel's death at the hands of Voltes V. He plotted with Zuhl to have Heinel pilot a beast fighter, while at the same time leaked information to Big Falcon about the beast fighter's weak points. His plan backfired when Katharine overheard the plot. Heinel ordered Zuhl to reinforce the weak points, and in mid-battle the beast fighter destroyed Zaki's nearby ship with him inside. Development Voltes V was produced by Toei Animation with animation from Sunrise and sponsorship from Popy for the toys. During the development of Voltes V, Nagahama originally conceived the series to be a sequel to Ch≈çdenji Robo Combattler V and follows the event of the series after the finale before making it into a separate series. From Nagahama's memo, the series is originally meant to be titled or . Both names are ultimately scrapped and it was renamed to Voltes V. During the time of its development, NET TV has transitioned its name to TV Asahi during 1977. In a proposal from Popy in 1976, Voltes V was meant to have a Gun-like finisher attack but Sunrise and Toei wanted the actual attack for the toys to be changed. As such, it was changed to a sword gimmick, which is carried over to the mecha's \\"Heaven's Blade/Laser Blade\\" attack. At that time also in 1976, Nagahama was given creative direction on the series and used Stage combat as reference for the titular mecha's combat moves. As describing the story itself, the plot of the Go Sibling's search for their father were inspired from Taiga dramas as explained by Shoichi Taguchi, one of the animes that inspired him for the series plot was 3000 Leagues in Search of Mother and that he wanted the heroes to search for their father instead of a mother. Akinori Watanabe, the previous director of Toei Company's Television Business Division was worried that the plot alone will be too depressing to viewers and wanted to avoid viewers crying all the time. In response to Watanabe's request, he created the rival character to the Go Siblings, Prince Heinel. Heinel himself was based on one of the actors in the world-famous Takarazuka Revue. According to Kei Iijima, one of Toei's producers, that the brothers and Heinel will be rivals throughout the series until the final episode, in which he will be revealed to be related to them by blood but have a tragic end and redemption. He stated also that \\"This is because I wanted viewers to strongly elicit anger against various discriminations around them and to hate discrimination through this work and think about correcting them.\\" The final draft of the series was completed in March 1977, with the first episode was broadcast on June 4 of the same year. Shinya Sadamitsu and Yoshiyuki Tomino were brought to the staff by Nagahama for their roles as producer and art director. Kazuo Tomizawa was also brought in as one of the staff until he decided to focus more on Invincible Super Man Zambot 3. Media =Anime= Voltes V was broadcast in Japan by TV Asahi from June 4, 1977 to March 25, 1978, replacing Ch≈çdenji Robo Combattler V in its initial timeslot. The series' opening theme is titled by Mitsuko Horie, Koorogi '73, and Columbia Yurikago-kai with the ending theme titled by Ichiro Mizuki. The lyrics to the opening theme were written by Toei staff with music written by Asei Kobayashi, and arranged by the series' composer, Hiroshi Takada, while the lyrics to the ending theme were penned by Akira Aoi (Tadao Nagahama), with music written by Asei Kobayashi, and arranged by Hiroshi Tsutsui. The English-language dub of Voltes V was originally aired in the Philippines by GMA Radio and Television Arts on May 5, 1978 (with a sponsorship from Purefoods). The series was shown every Friday (6:00 pm) and became popular nationwide. Another English dub, written and directed by William Ross, was produced in Tokyo, Japan by Frontier Enterprises, later released in North America in 1983 by 3B Productions as Voltus 5. It was a condensed version of episodes 1, 2, 9 and 18 produced by Toei. The English- dubbed feature used the character names of the Philippine English version. Telesuccess Productions (formerly known as Questor International) currently holds the Philippine rights to the anime series since its premiere on GMA in 1978. At the Otakon 2018 convention on August 13, 2018, Discotek Media announced that they licensed the series for its DVD and Blu-ray release in North America.https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-08-12/discotek- licenses-giant-robo-kimagure-orange-road-galaxy- express-999-more/.135382https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime- news/2018/08/13-1/discotek-announces-licenses-for-basically-everything-at- otakon =Live-action drama= On December 31, 2019 during the New Year countdown program, GMA released a one-minute teaser of Voltes V: Legacy, an upcoming live action series adaptation licensed from Toei Company through its Philippine licensor Telesuccess Productions, Inc.https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-01-02/philippines-gma-network- reveals-live-action-voltes-v-legacy-series/.154979 Mark A. Reyes will be the director and lead the production of the series. Reyes revealed that he has been working for the project of Voltes V: Legacy for five years. As confirmed by Reyes through questions from fans, GMA partnered with post-production and visual effects firm Riot Inc. Post Production (known for Max's \\"Kaleidoscope World\\" commercial and the same group that handled the effects of the original Encantadia) for the project with approval and supervision from Toei. GMA's video graphic department will also be involved with Voltes V: Legacy. =Toys= During the series' run, Popy released a diecast metal toy of Voltes V. The toy was available either with the five Volt Machines sold separately or in a gift set known as the \\"Volt In Box\\". Aside from the Volt Machines combining to form Voltes V, the toy also transformed into Voltank mode (an alternate vehicle mode wherein the robot lied down face-first with the Volt Panzer and Volt Lander's wheels on the ground). Voltank mode never appeared in the series, but was a unique feature of the toy. The boxed set was re-released in 1982 before being repackaged as part of Bandai's Godaikin line for the international market in 1983. Popy also released a Jumbo Machinder version of Voltes V. Standing at over 24 inches in height, the toy featured firing projectile fists and could transform into Voltank mode, which small children could ride on. In 2006, Bandai released a newer, smaller Voltes V toy as part of their Soul of Chogokin line. This toy is more detailed and more poseable than its Popy diecast predecessor. In 2008, the toy was re-released as a special edition called \\"Respect for Volt In Box\\", which pays homage to the original toy in both color scheme and packaging. In addition, this version has been retooled to transform into Voltank mode. In 2018, Bandai released the Soul of Chogokin Voltes V F.A. (Full Action) figure. The figure sacrifices its combination gimmick in favor of more anime-accurate proportions and dynamic articulation. In 2020, Bandai announced that the titular mecha will also be released under the DX Soul of Chogokin line. =Video games= The series itself is been included and featured in the long-running Super Robot Wars series of video games. Legacy in the Philippines The cartoon show was extremely popular in the Philippines, it‚Äôs theme song was ordinarily played as an introduction before the singing of the Philippine national anthem for many years in both public and private elementary schools. = 1979 ban and use as a protest icon = In April 1979, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos issued a directive banning Voltes V and other similarly-themed anime series, ostensibly due to concerns about \\"excessive violence\\" and \\"harmful effects on children\\". This, however, led to speculations that the series was banned from broadcast due to its underlying themes of rebellion and revolution. In 2012, Marcos' son Bongbong defended his late father's decision to ban Voltes V, citing pressure from parents. After Marcos' ouster in the February 1986 People Power Revolution, the series returned to Philippine television on multiple broadcasters, beginning with PTV in 1986, ABS-CBN in February 1987, IBC in 1989, and RPN from 1988 until 1990. It returned on the original network, GMA in 1999, with the English dub aired every Friday beginning on January 15 and a Filipino/Tagalog dub airing later in December. In the same year, the last five episodes of Voltes V that were cut from broadcast due to President Marcos' ban, were compiled together and released for the first time theatrically by GMA Films under the title as \\"Voltes V: The Liberation\\". A thirteen-foot sculpture made by Toym Leon Imao called at the time Last, Lost, Lust for Four Episodes was displayed in front of the Palma Hall at the University of the Philippines Diliman from September 20 to 28, 2014, consisting of brass, fiberglass, and galvanized iron. The sculpture was made to represent \\"the anger felt as a 10-year-old when Voltes V and the other robots were summarily removed from television.\\" = Musical theme legacy = The music theme of the show is popularly remembered as a song played as filler music just before the national anthem in many schools during flag-raising ceremony. Due to popularity of the anime, Voltes V has embedded itself in Filipino pop culture. The debut album of the Filipino rock band Eraserheads is titled Ultraelectromagneticpop!, a reference to the \\"Ultraelectromagnetic Top\\" used in the series. In the GMA's comedy-gag show, Bubble Gang, its segment Ang Dating Doon (which is a parody of the religious program, Ang Dating Daan) top- billed by Isko \\"Brod Pete\\" Salvador used the Voltes V theme as its theme song. In 1978, the comic trio of Tito Sotto, Vic Sotto and Joey de Leon, more popularly known as the TVJ trio, also made a Tagalog parody of the song, also titled as Voltes V, which is included in their album TVJ Tough Hits Vol. 4. = New Filipino dubs = In May 2006, the cable channel Hero, owned by the ABS-CBN Corporation, released the series as Voltes V Evolution with a new voice cast. In an attempt to promote the show to a younger audience, the network had Jett Pangan, Sandara Park, Dennis Trillo and other Filipino celebrities re-dub the characters' voices. On March 27, 2017, in celebration of the anime's 40th anniversary, a new Tagalog dub of Voltes V returned to Philippine television and to GMA in the \\"Astig Authority\\" block every weekday mornings. The new voice cast features several of the network's artists such as Bea Binene, Derrick Monasterio, Jak Roberto, Hiro Peralta, and Ken Chan. The same version of the Tagalog dub of Voltes V re-aired on the network on July 30, 2018.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xFnpZ00WjY In September 2016, a video-on-demand service, iflix began streaming all episodes of Voltes V both in English and Filipino dub.

According to the Namelist of Bulgarian Rulers, Vinekh reigned for seven years and was a member of the Vokil (or Ukil) clan (which may be the same family as that of his predecessor). According to the chronology developed by Moskov, Vinekh would have reigned 754-762\\\\. Other chronologies date the reign of Vinekh to 756-762 but do not entirely agree with the testimony of the Imennik. Vinekh ascended the throne after the defeat of his predecessor Kormisosh by the Eastern Roman Emperor Constantine V Kopronymos, which has led some scholars to assume that he was a usurper. In c. 756 Constantine V campaigned against Bulgaria by land and sea, and defeated the Bulgarian army led by Vinekh at Marcellae (Karnobat). The defeated monarch sued for peace and undertook to send his own children as hostages. In 759 Constantine V invaded Bulgaria again, but this time his army was ambushed in the mountain passes of the Stara Planina (battle of the Rishki Pass). Vinekh did not follow up his victory and sought to re-establish the peace. This won him the opposition of the Bulgarian nobility, which had him massacred together with his family.

Early life  Benko was born on July 15, 1928 in Amiens, France, where his Hungarian parents were on vacation. He was raised in Hungary. Benko learned to play chess aged eight from his father, but did not compete in tournaments until age 17, due to World War II. During the war, he dug ditches for the Hungarian army before being captured by the Soviet army, which forced him to be a laborer. He eventually escaped to his home, only to find that his brother and father had been sent to Russia as laborers, and his mother died as the war neared its conclusion. Benko made rapid progress once he began tournament play, and became Hungarian champion by age 20. He qualified for the 1952 Interzonal tournament, but was unable to compete as he was sent to a concentration camp in March 1952 for attempting to defect to the American embassy in West Berlin during a chess tournament in East Berlin. He starved and saw others around him die.The Early Life of Pal Benko, chess.comBenko, Pal. Silman, Jeremy. Pal Benko: My Life, Games, and Compositions. Siles Press. (2004) He remained imprisoned for 16 months, attaining release after Stalin's death. He emigrated to the United States in 1958 after defecting following the World Student Team Championship in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland, in 1957. FIDE awarded him the title of Grandmaster in 1958. He was previously awarded the title of International Master in 1950.  World title candidate  Benko's highest achievement was qualifying and competing in the Candidates Tournament‚Äîthe tournament to decide the challenger for the World Championship‚Äîin 1959 and 1962. Both tournaments had eight of the world's top players. He finished eighth in 1959 and sixth in 1962. Benko qualified for the 1970 Interzonal tournament, the leaders of which advance to the Candidates. He gave up his spot in the Interzonal to Bobby Fischer, however, who went on to win the World Championship in 1972.  Other achievements  Benko finished in first place (or tied for first place) in eight U.S. Open Chess Championships, a record. His titles were: 1961, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1969, 1974, 1975. He won the 1964 Canadian Open Chess Championship. He represented Hungary at the 1957 Student Olympiad in Reykjav√≠k on , scoring 7¬Ω/12, and Hungary was fourth as a team. He had earlier played for the national Hungarian team at the Moscow 1956 Olympiad, on board three, scoring 10/15, and helping Hungary to team bronze. He moved to the United States, but it was not until 1962 that he appeared on the U.S. team. He would wind up on six teams in a row. At Varna 1962, Benko played board two, scored 8/12 for the silver medal on his board, and the U.S. finished fourth. At Tel Aviv 1964, he was again on board two, scored 9¬Ω/14, and the U.S. ended up sixth. At Havana 1966, Benko was on board three, scored 8/12, and the Americans won team silver. At Lugano 1968, he made 6/12 on board three, and the U.S. finished fourth. At Siegen 1970, Benko was on board four, scoring 8¬Ω/12, and the Americans again finished fourth. His last Olympiad was Skopje 1972, where he played on board three, made 9¬Ω/16, and the U.S. ended up ninth. Benko defeated four players who held the World Champion title at some point in time.

After Fischer retired, Benko was one of the few players with whom he maintained contact; reportedly the two corresponded every week. According to Chessmetrics, at his best, Benko was ranked 17th in the world, with a peak rating of 2687.Chessmetrics Player Profile: Pal Benko  Later life and death  In later life Benko was a tutor to many up-and-coming players from his native Hungary; his students included the Polg√°r sisters (Susan, Sofia, Judit Polg√°r) and Peter Leko. Benko had a column on chess endgames in Chess Life magazine, which is published by the United States Chess Federation, for decades: \\"In the Arena\\" (1972‚Äì1981), \\"Endgame Lab\\" (1981‚Äì2013), and chess problem column \\"Benko's Bafflers\\". In 2003 he revised Reuben Fine's book Basic Chess Endings. Benko died on August 26, 2019, in Budapest at the age of 91.

The factory where design and manufacturing take place is just over the border in England. The company is known for its model railway products in N gauge and OO gauge. History Dapol's name is a play on its founders David and Pauline Boyle's names. He owned a model concern Highfield Birds & Models. In 1981 he first tried to buy the Airfix and Mainline ranges.Ramsay's British Model Trains catalogue edition 6, by Pat Hammond, 2008 p101. The Dapol brand name was first used in a Railway Modeller advert of September 1983.Railway Modeller magazine September 1983 issue page 6a. The first Dapol wagons (for OO) were announced to become available on 20 November 1983.Railway Modeller magazine advert November 1983 p12a. From 1 March 1984 ex Airfix railway kits became available.Railway Modeller magazine March 1984 p25a advert. Later in the year the Railway Modeller carried a two-page profile of the new concern with the upbeat title An exciting new model empire.Railway Modeller September 1984 p364ff. A lot of David Boyle's background was explored. Some of Dapol's ambitions were frustrated. That article said that the Austerity 2-8-0 and the LMS Beyer Garratt were both under development for 1985 but they never appeared from Dapol. However the L&YR; Pug, the Austerity 0-6-0ST and the GWR Hawksworth County which were announced early in 1984 were all produced promptly, well reviewed and have had long model lives. At this time the operation was headquartered in Navigation Road, Northwich. During 1985 Dapol successfully bought Mainline (and thereby the former Airfix) model railway ranges from Palitoy.Model Railway Constructor magazine June 1985 page 328 and November 1985 page 565 describe the transition. It was announced in the Railway Modeller of February 1989 that Dapol had bought the former Trix/British Liliput range from Ernest Rosza.Railway Modeller magazine February 1989 page 91. The Dapol 1989 catalogue also showed that the Model- Land building range had been bought.Dapol 1989 catalogue page 50ff where the model are labelled Dapoland. In 1994, while the company was moving to its previous location at Llangollen in North Wales, a huge fire destroyed the old site at Winsford in Cheshire, and large quantities of products and historical Wrenn material were destroyed. In 1996 Dapol sold many of its inherited model railway lines to Hornby.Rail Express magazine October 1996 page 65 report. In 1998 the company came under the control of a new board of directors headed by George Smith, who retired on 1 October 2010. The company remains in the ownership of the Boyle family who founded the company. In 2001 Dapol sold the little-exploited Wrenn product line (bought in 1993 from Wrenn) and trading name to three Wrenn collectors. From 1988‚Äì2001 Dapol also produced a wide range of Doctor Who action figures. In 2002 the BBC declined to renew the licence. The Dapol site also hosted the 'BBC Doctor Who Experience' exhibition until 2003. In 2004 Dapol were awarded the 'UK Small Business of the Year' award. In 2007 Dapol were awarded the Model Rail (magazine) 'N-gauge Manufacturer of the Year' award. In 2010 Dapol were awarded the Model Rail (magazine) 'N-gauge manufacturer of the year', 'Best N gauge steam loco of the year' (Terrier), 'Best N-gauge Diesel locomotive of the year' (class 67), Best N-gauge Rolling Stock of the year (MK3 coach) making a 'clean sweep' for all the awards for N gauge. In 2010, following the retirement of previous MD George Smith, Dapol welcomed a new managing director, Joel Bright, a director for the previous eight years and uncle of the current owner, Craig Boyle. Products =N gauge= Dapol manufactures a growing range of N gauge locomotives, coaches and wagons, and is the main competitor of Graham Farish in the British 'ready-to-run' market. Continuous improvement in model specifications has led to the introduction of 40:1 gearing in locomotive drive mechanisms, NEM couplings on all stock, and LED lighting strips for coaching stock (yellow for 'older' coaches, to represent incandescent illumination, and white for more modern coaches and EMUs to represent fluorescent fittings). =OO Gauge= Dapol B26 OO scale wagon 10 ton BR meat wagon In 00 gauge, Dapol manufactures ready-to-run locomotives, wagons and kits. Kits are moulded in grey plastic (polystyrene) and the range features buildings, road vehicles, wagons and locos. Some of the kits use moulds bought in 1993 from the Airfix company, some of which in turn originated with Kitmaster prior to being bought by Airfix in 1962. Others have come from the Lines Brothers Model-Land range. The first OO scale locomotives to be entirely originated by Dapol were the L&YR; Pug 0-4-0ST, the Austerity 0-6-0ST and GWR County 4-6-0 generated in 1984/5.Railway Modeller magazine January 1984 issue p40.Ramsay's British Model Trains catalogue edition 6, by Pat Hammond, 2008 p102-103 The next was the LB&SCR; Terrier.

Combining traditional scholarship with 21st-century showmanship techniques, the museum ranks as one of the most visited presidential libraries. Its library, in addition to housing an extensive collection on Lincoln, also houses the collection of the Illinois State Historical Library, founded by the state in 1889. The library and museum is located in the state capital of Springfield, Illinois, and is overseen as an agency of state government. It is not affiliated with the U.S. National Archives and its system of libraries. Collection =Museum exhibits= Lincoln Family in the Museum Entry Plaza. John Wilkes Booth can be seen watching them. Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum at Springfield, Illinois The museum contains life-size dioramas of Lincoln's boyhood home, areas of the White House, the presidential box at Ford's Theatre, and the settings of key events in Lincoln's life, as well as pictures, artifacts and other memorabilia. Original artifacts are changed from time to time, but the collection usually includes items like the original hand written Gettysburg Address, a signed Emancipation Proclamation, his glasses and shaving mirror, Mary Todd Lincoln's music box, items from her White House china, her wedding dress, and more. The permanent exhibits are divided into two different stages of the president's life, called \\"Journey One: The Pre-Presidential Years\\", and \\"Journey Two: The Presidential Years\\", and a third, the \\"Treasures Gallery\\". Temporary exhibits rotate periodically. Past exhibits have dealt with the Civil War and Stephen A. Douglas. , a collection of Annie Leibovitz's photography, including photos of Lincoln's items, is on display. One of the museum's permanent exhibits, Campaign of 1860, includes modern-style television updates on the campaign's progress from the late Meet the Press anchor Tim Russert. Another of the permanent exhibits, \\"The Civil War in Four Minutes,\\" displays a large animated map which displays the changing battle lines of the Civil War in four minutes. In addition to its exhibits, the Lincoln Museum runs two special effects theater shows, Lincoln's Eyes and Ghosts of the Library. The \\"Under His Hat: Discovering Lincoln's Story From Primary Sources\\", is the home of the Lincoln Collection Digitization Project, a thematic online resource that features a 360-degree online view of his hat (the actual hat is, , also on display at the museum). Burbank, California-based BRC Imagination Arts, led by Bob Rogers, was responsible for all of the permanent exhibits and presentations, music, theaters, lifelike figures and full-immersion historical settings. =Library collection= The Lincoln Presidential Library is a research library which houses books, papers and artifacts related to Lincoln's life and the American Civil War. In addition to the works associated with Lincoln and his era, the library houses the collection of the Illinois State Historical Library (founded by the state in 1889) and serves as a premier repository of books, pamphlets, manuscripts, and other materials of historical interest pertaining to the history of the state of Illinois. While the library is open to the public, its rare collection is non-circulating. A reading room, named the Steve Neal Reading Room in honor of Illinois historical journalist Steve Neal, is open to the public. Administration The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum was administered by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency, until it was made into an independent state agency in 2017. Historian and former director of several presidential libraries, Richard Norton Smith, served as the museum and library's Founding Executive Director. In 2010, Eileen R. Mackevich, MBE, was appointed director by Illinois Governor Pat Quinn. Mackevich formerly served as the Executive Director of the national Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission. She was also active as a broadcast journalist and talk show host on Chicago public radio, and was the co-founder of the Chicago Humanities Festival. Mackevich's objectives were to raise money, and attract more international interest. She served until in 2015. In 2016, Governor Bruce Rauner appointed Alan Lowe as director of the museum and library. He served as Director of the George W. Bush Presidential Center in Dallas, Texas before accepting his position at the ALPLM. As First Lady of Illinois, Lura Lynn Ryan became a major fundraiser and the Library's first chairwoman. She launched the fundraising for the library by raising $250,000. Ryan also organized a program in which Illinois schoolchildren collected pennies for the construction of the presidential library, which raised $47,000 dollars. Ryan was appointed to the 14-member Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission by the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives to commemorate the 200th birthday of former U.S. President Abraham Lincoln in 2009. She served on the commission from 2001 to 2010. Architecture Illinois Old Capitol Building The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum is located in Springfield, Illinois, in the historic downtown section, near many other Lincoln cultural sites. The presidential library opened on October 14, 2004, and the museum opened on April 19, 2005. Until 1970, Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. was designated as the \\"Lincoln Museum\\". The buildings which now house the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum are in three separate structures. Each structure encompasses one city block. Two of the buildings, the museum and the library, are separated by a street and connected above the street level by an enclosed walkway. The entrance of each building features a rotunda, reflective of the dome on the Old State Capitol State Historic Site in Springfield, where Lincoln served four terms as a legislator. Both structures were designed by the architectural firm HOK. The third building, the former Springfield Union Station, had originally been adapted to serve as the museum's visitor center. However, since early 2014, the station has, instead, housed an exhibit called \\"Lincoln: History To Hollywood\\", which displays two sets, as well as several props and costumes, from the 2012 film \\"Lincoln\\", directed by Steven Spielberg. The sets, props, and costumes are on loan to the Museum directly from Spielberg himself, and will remain on display (with costumes rotating in and out) through December 2019. Debate over exhibit design and education of history The museum has sparked debate within the field of museum design and among historians for its use of theatrics and inaccurate reproductions to tell the Lincoln story. Public response has been positive, delivering larger than expected attendance, enthusiastic visitors and a boost to the regional economy, including increased attendance at surrounding historical attractions.Wetterich, Chris (August 25, 2005). \\"Attendance at Historic Sites Jumps 19%.\\", State Journal Register (Illinois). However, museum traditionalists have disapproved of this departure from the display and interpretation of real artifacts. Southern Illinois University Carbondale historian John Y. Simon have said the museum's approach, which borrows presentation technologies from entertainment, trivializes the subject matter. Suggesting that it is more like a theme park than a museum, Simon called the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Museum a \\"Six Flags Over Lincoln\\" and architecture critic Blair Kamin referred to it as \\"Lincoln Land.\\" Other academics applaud the Lincoln Museum's approach. John R. Decker wrote in the Journal of American History: > Like any other modern collection (the Lincoln Presidential museum) has an > audience base that extends far beyond specialists and academics. Rather than > merely pandering to the public or dumbing down history, the ALPLM > intelligently and compellingly uses visual culture to meet its mission as a > public pedagogical institution. The museum addresses complex historical > material and opens the historical discourse to a wider audience than would > be possible through more conventional means.Decker, John D. (December, > 2005). \\"Reviews: Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum.\\", Journal > of American History. The scholarship behind the content and design for the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Museum was a collaboration between international exhibit designers, BRC Imagination Arts, the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency (IHPA), and a content team assembled by state historian Dr. Thomas H. Schwartz. This content team included the world's leading Lincoln scholars, Pulitzer Prize winning historians, and Illinois school teachers representing the fourth, seventh and eleventh grades. A key goal of this collective was that exhibits promote a greater level of personal interest in Abraham Lincoln. The museum's gift shop has seen record sales of history books. Overall sales in the gift shop hit $1 million within three months of the museum's opening to the public.Landis, Tim, Morris, Natalie (July 21, 2005). \\"Tourism Booming: Museum Seems to be Boosting All Attractions.\\", State Journal Register (Illinois).

It is a multiple-branching deciduous shrub growing to tall with an open, spreading, irregular habit, only rarely forming a small tree. The leaves are 3‚Äì8 cm long rounded ovals, green with a waxy glaucous sheen. The autumn colour can be strikingly varied, from peach and yellow to scarlet. The flowers are numerous, produced in large inflorescences long; each flower 5‚Äì10 mm in diameter, with five pale yellow petals. Most of the flowers in each inflorescence abort, elongating into yellowish-pink to pinkish-purple feathery plumes (when viewed en masse these have a wispy 'smoke-like' appearance, hence the common name \\"smoke tree\\") which surround the small (2‚Äì3 mm) drupaceous fruit that do develop.

San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD), established in 1851, is the only public school district within the City and County of San Francisco, and the first in the state of California. () Under the management of the San Francisco Board of Education, the district serves more than 55,500 students in more than 160 institutions. SFUSD utilizes an intra-district school choice system and requires students and parents to submit a selection application. Every year in the fall, the SFUSD hosts a Public School Enrollment Fair to provide families access to information about all the schools in the district. This system is set to change as the school board has resolved to overhaul the system to ensure that more students (at least at the elementary level) are placed at neighborhood schools. SFUSD has the second highest Academic Performance Index among the seven largest California school districts. Newsweek‚Äôs national ranking of \\"Best High Schools in America\\" named seven SFUSD high schools among the top five percent in the country in 2007.

At the time, white and black students were the largest demographic groups in the school district. The decree was intended to benefit black children.

Tom Stannage describes the diary as \\"an immensely valuable social document\\" and \\"the best published guide we have to life in Swan River colony between 1830 and 1840.\\"Stannage, C. T. (1978). Introduction to Facsimile edition of Moore (1884). Background Moore was an Irish lawyer who settled in the Swan River Colony in 1830, the colony's second year. He describes his decision to keep a journal as follows:Moore, George Fletcher (1884). Diary of Ten Years Eventful Life of an Early Settler in Western Australia, and also A Descriptive Vocabulary of the Language of the Aborigines. First published by M. Walbrook, London. Facsimile edition published in 1978 by University of Western Australia Press, Nedlands, Western Australia Moore's handwritten diary for the period from 1834 to 1841 is extant, and is held by the State Library of Western Australia. Editions Portions of Moore's letters and diary have been published a number of times. The letters from 1830 to mid-1833 were published in 1834 as Extracts from the Letters and Journals of George Fletcher Moore, now filling a judicial office at the Swan River Settlement. Publication was at the request of Moore's father Joseph, and may have been without George Fletcher Moore's knowledge. In the early 1880s, Moore's letters fell into the hands of Sir Thomas Cockburn Campbell, editor of The West Australian newspaper. Cockburn Campbell sought and received Moore's permission to publish them in The West. The letters appeared in serial during 1881 and 1882, and a copy of each issue was sent to Moore, who kept a scrapbook of them. In 1884, Moore decided to publish them afresh, together with a reprint of his 1842 A Descriptive Vocabulary of the Language of the Aborigines. These were published under the title Diary of Ten Years Eventful Life of an Early Settler in Western Australia and also A Descriptive Vocabulary of the Language of the Aborigines.

Manji writes that the Jews' historical roots stretch back to the land of Israel, and that they have a right to a Jewish state. She further argues that the allegation of apartheid in Israel is deeply misleading, noting that there are in Israel several Arab political parties; that Arab-Muslim legislators have veto powers; and that Arab parties have overturned disqualifications. She also writes that Israel has a free Arab press; that road signs bear Arabic translations; and that Arabs live and study alongside Jews.Manji, Irshad.

Manji has made multiple translations of the book (namely Arabic, Urdu, Malay and Persian) available for free download on her website, with the intention of reaching readers in those countries where her book is banned. Since its publication, the book has been met with both praise and criticism from Muslim and non-Muslim sources. Khaleel Mohammed, an imam and professor of Islam at San Diego State University, wrote in his foreword to Manji's book that \\"Irshad wants us to do what our Holy Book wants us to do: end the tribal posturing, open our eyes, and stand up to oppression, even if it's rationalized by our vaunted imams.\\" On the other hand, M. Junaid Levesque-Alam claimed that the book ignored scholarship by Jewish historians on alleged Israeli ethnic cleansing against Palestinians. He also stated that the book is openly feted by Americans who have advocated war on Iraq and Iran.The Only Good Muslim is the Anti-Muslim by M.

History  In 1835 Joseph S. Battle established Battle's Camp along the Wilmington and Raleigh Railroad. The settlement was initially located entirely in Edgecombe County, North Carolina, but in 1871 the county line was altered to run along the railroad and Battle's Camp straddled both Edgecombe and Nash counties. In 1873 the community was incorporated as the town of Battleboro. By 1900 the town had 229 residents. Two years later the business district was destroyed in a fire, but it was later rebuilt. By 1990 the town had grown to include 447 residents. In April 1994, a black rights group, Concerned Citizens for Battleboro, initiated a boycott of local white-owned businesses in protest of alleged harassment by authorities after a black woman was maced by a police officer and arrested for intervening in a traffic stop involving her niece. The boycott garnered national media attention and forced the town's largest grocery store to close. Over the next few years many residents of the Battleboro began urging that the town be annexed by the larger city of Rocky Mount, mostly to receive cheaper government services. The all-white Battleboro Board of Commissioners repeatedly refused to consider the matter, leading racial minorities in the town to accuse the board of discrimination. On June 4, 1996 residents of the community voted in a nonbinding referendum 132-34 in favor of annexation. Battleboro was incorporated into Rocky Mount later that year.

It is located in the town of Vard√∏ on the island of Vard√∏ya on the Barents Sea near the mouth of the Varangerfjord in northeastern Norway near the Russian border. History In 1251, an embassy from the Republic of Novgorod to King Haakon IV Haakonson of Norway complained of clashes between the Norwegians and the Karelians in northern Finnmark. A Norwegian embassy was dispatched to Novgorod where a treaty (the original of which is now lost) was signed to conclude a peace between the two countries, including the Novgorod tributary land of Karelia.Stagg 1952: p. 61-63 The Finnmark coast was originally important as a source of furs from the trade with the Karelians, but this trade dropped off as the Hanseatic League increased the fur trade through their Novgorod centre. Finnmark remained important as a fishery; the fish was shipped as stockfish to Bergen and traded there with the Hansa merchants. =Vargh√∏ya= The first fortification was erected by Haakon V Magnusson in 1306 and was called Vargh√∏ya. It is not known how long this fort was manned, but in 1307 the Archbishop of Trondhjem went to Vard√∏hus to consecrate the new Vard√∏ Church. The earliest record still extant which defines the border between Norway and Russia is from 1326. In 1340, records show the Archbishop made further efforts to improve conditions there.Stagg 1952: p. 61-65 =√òsterv√•gen= The second fortification to be built was in √òsterv√•gen (the \\"East Bay\\") which was erected between 1450 and 1500. This fortification was rectangular with two corner bastions.Kavli 1987 It appears on various maps from the 14th and 15th century. The Captain of Vard√∏hus owned a share of the fishery. While visiting the fort in 1511, Erik Valkendorf wrote: \\"the country would not be habitable for Christians were it not that the catch of fish is so plentiful as to attract people to settle down there. And this dried fish, which they call 'stockfish', is so valuable and excellent that it is exported to nearly every Christian country.\\"Stagg 1952: p. 75 In 1583, the Norwegian rights to the Arctic Sea were formally recognized by England; the agreement stipulated that each vessel which passed into the White Sea was to stop at Vard√∏hus to pay duty.Stagg 1952: p. 83 In 1597, Boris Godunov ('de facto' regent of Russia from 1584 to 1598 and Tsar from 1598 to 1605) wrote to King Christian IV of Denmark and Norway, asserting that Vard√∏hus and \\"the Lapp country (as far as Troms√∏) was from ancient times a perpetual patrimony of the Czar.\\" In 1600, Godunov refused to ratify the Treaty of Tyavzino which resolved conflicting Swedish and Russian claims to the Kola peninsula to the east of Vard√∏hus as well as other territories both claimed. This treaty did not acknowledge the Norwegian presence at Vard√∏hus nor the Norwegian claims to this territory. As a result of these border conflicts with Russia, King Christian IV of Denmark-Norway asserted Norway's historic ownership and visited Vard√∏hus in 1599 to instruct the governor of Vard√∏hus to collect taxes from Russians in his province, including the Kola peninsula and to exclude the Swedes, who were also attempting to claim the territory based on the Treaty of Tyavzino.Stagg 1952: p. 84-90 At this time, Vard√∏hus was so decrepit that he continued to live on board his ship, Victor. His name has been preserved as it was carved on a beam from the 1599 fort to commemorate the visit.Niemi 1988, p. ? As a further effort at improving his hold on Finnmark, Christian IV built the fortress of Altenhus near Alta in 1610. =Vard√∏hus= By the 1730s, Vard√∏hus had become decrepit. The seat of government of Finnmark was transferred from Vard√∏hus to Altengaard. Major upgrades to the current fortress began in 1738. Modern history Vard√∏hus did not see enemy action until the 20th century. The last time the fortifications were on active anti-invasion duty was during the First World War. The Second World War saw the fortress used as an anti-aircraft site and as a POW camp before the German occupation.Fjeld 1999, p. 211 Interior of Vard√∏hus Fortress in 1989, showing Vard√∏'s sole tree, which was cut down in 2002 after rotting due to the harsh climate. It has been replaced. =Second World War= During the period from the beginning of the Second World War to the German invasion of Norway, Vard√∏hus Fortress was an active unit under the command of Naval District no. 3 in Troms√∏. For a time during the Winter War, 15-20 Finnish soldiers were interned at the fortress after being pushed across the border from Northern Finland by Soviet offensives.Fjeld 1999: 210 Norwegian Campaign At the outbreak of the German invasion on 9 April 1940, Vard√∏hus was under the command of Captain Johan Basilier Basilier. The garrison consisted of one retired lieutenant, two privates, ten non-combatant military personnel, and two civilians. The weapons at the disposal of the garrison in 1940 were: * Four Krupp m/1887 8.4 cm field guns * Two turn-of- the-century model 37 mm Armstrong cannon (on loan from the Royal Norwegian Navy since 1914) * One Hotchkiss m/1896 65 mm cannon * One Maxim m/1898 37 mm autocannon * Initially one heavy machine gun of unknown make, several more added to the arsenal during the campaign * Two m/1915 Madsen machine guns in 6.5√ó55mm Krag calibre During the evening of 9 April 1940 Captain Basilier received orders to mobilize a small number of additional soldiers to guard the fortress. With the announcement of general mobilization on 11 April further troops were called in for service. Captain Basilier, who had been suffering from poor health since Easter that year, took sick leave on 13 April and was replaced by Navy Lieutenant B. Bjerkelund. From this date a full mobilization was carried out in the Vard√∏ area, in addition the members of the local rifle association were deployed to guard duty at important objectives. Soon the entire island was under guard, and coast guard and air observation posts were operational. All the different outposts were connected to the fortress via telephone lines. The machine guns at the fortress were readied for use with improvised anti-aircraft mounts produced by a local blacksmith. A few days after the full mobilization began a force of 150 men were at the disposal of the commander of Vard√∏hus and by the 10 June cease-fire around 215 men sorted under Vard√∏hus Fortress. =POW camp= On 20 April 1940 the commander in chief of Northern Norway, General Carl Gustav Fleischer, issued orders to the 3rd Naval District that an internment camp for German prisoners of war was to be established at Vard√∏hus.Steen 1958: 250 Four days later, on 24 April, the 1,382 ton steamer Nova arrived in port with 155 German POWs. Most of the German prisoners were crew members from the Kriegsmarine destroyer Erich Koellner, sunk at Djupvik on the southern side of the Ofotfjord during the Battles of Narvik. The prisoners included the destroyer's commander, Fregattenkapit√§n Alfred Schulze-Hinrichs. The prisoners were housed under guard at the Quarantine Detention building. The POW camp at Vard√∏hus was closed down after a central POW camp for German detainees was established at Skorpa in Troms county and the 155 prisoners shipped to Skorpa on Nova on 13 May. Nova was escorted southwards by the patrol boat Ingrid - a captured German trawler operated by the Royal Norwegian Navy. The prisoners were released from Skorpa on 12 June 1940, after the mainland Norwegian capitulation.Sandberg 1945: 174 Other military activities at the fortress included the establishment of a 12-bed field hospital and a radio station. From 23 May the fortress came under the command of the newly established East Finnmark Naval District responsible for all RNoN units in eastern Finnmark. =Air attack= The fortress' sole action with the German invasion forces came on 4 June 1940. Since early May German aircraft had overflown the area without incident, but on 4 June a single Luftwaffe bomber made an attack. The bomber missed its intended target, the radio station, but damaged the church and the commandant's quarters. After expending its bomb load, the bomber flew low and strafed the area, riddling the radio hut and other buildings with bullets. In response to the attack, Corporal Olav B√∏rve returned fire using the 65 mm Hotchkiss gun with case-shot, firing 13 rounds.Stjern 2003: 19 After a while, the fortress' machine guns also fired back at the aircraft. With at least one of the case-shot rounds damaging the German bomber's hull it limped away from the area with a wounded navigator. Following the attack, work began on the construction of a new anti-aircraft position on the nearby Kirkeberget hill. The position was completed, but no armaments were installed before the cease-fire went into effect. Surrender and transitional period On 8 June Lieutenant Bjerkelund was informed that the fighting in Norway was coming to a close and given the opportunity to evacuate to the United Kingdom. Seizing the opportunity, Bjerkelund left for Rosyth that same day on the patrol boat Nordhav II. Bjerkelund was replaced as commander by coastal artillery lieutenant H. Johannesen later in the day. Of the ten officers and NCOs and 214 men at the fortress all but 12 of the men were demobilized on 9 June. The officers, NCOs and the dozen privates were to continue to serve until the arrival of German occupation forces. =\\"Flag war\\"= With the first Germans arriving only on 17 July, Vard√∏hus became the last armed unit under a Norwegian flag to lay down their arms during the Norwegian Campaign.Fjeld 1999, p. 212 This occurred on 20 July, when German soldiers took down the Norwegian flag. Between 20 and 25 July no flag flew over Vard√∏hus, as the Germans had ordered the Norwegian soldiers not raise the flag again.Fjeld 1999, p. 213 However, since the Norwegian interpreted the order as only to not raise the State flag, they instead raised the Civil ensign on 25 July. From that day until 7 November the Norwegian flag flew at least part of every day, five times being removed by German soldiers who raised their own, which was replaced when they left. Each time the Nazi flag was burnt. During this time Captain Rynning was the fortress commander and served as a symbol of Norwegian sovereignty and as a buffer between German military authorities and the Norwegian military and civilian authorities. This, and \\"the flag war\\", continued until Rynning was arrested on the order of Reichskommissar Josef Terboven on 7 November. Rynning spent the next two years as a political prisoner at Grini and M√∏llergata 19 in Norway. In December 1942 Rynning was given prisoner of war status and deported to camps in Germany and occupied Poland for the rest of the war, returning on 7 June 1945. German occupation During the occupation the Germans improved the fortifications in the Vard√∏ area, among other things building two coastal artillery batteries. Vard√∏hus was utilised by the occupiers as a barracks for the crews manning the modern German-built fortifications. In 1944, as the Germans retreated from Finland through Finnmark before the advancing Finns, General Lothar Rendulic ordered a scorched earth policy. Vard√∏ was burned, with only a few houses remaining.Stagg 1952, p. 197 Even though the German coastal artillery batteries were demolished before the Germans left, Vard√∏hus was left intact, although in a miserable state of disrepair. =Post-World War II= Prison During the immediate post-war period, from 1945 to 1947, the fortress was demilitarised and used as a prison for people convicted of treason in the post-war legal purge. In 1947, Vard√∏hus was returned to fortress status manned by a commander and a few privates. Salute fortress The command of the fort is now the responsibility of the Royal Norwegian Navy, with a commander and four soldiers stationed there. Today the fort has few practical military purposes and serves primarily as a salute fortress, firing gun salutes on Norwegian Constitution Day (17 May), dissolution of the Union with Sweden Day (7 June) and on all royal birthdays. The fortress is unique for the fact that, on the winter day that the sun can again be seen from the fortress walls after the period of continuous darkness, the fortress guns fire a two-round salute. The gunshots announce to the school pupils of Vard√∏ that they have the rest of the day off in celebration of the return of the sun. Museum As the Fortress has mainly the same appearance today as in 1738 it serves as a piece of cultural and military history. The fortress is open to the public and houses a museum.

It allows the user to control their computer with natural speech, without having to train the computer beforehand. The commands must be present in the Speakable items folder though but can be created with something as simple as a shortcut, AppleScript, keyboard command, or Automator workflows. History Speakable items was first introduced as part of Apple's speech recognition software PlainTalk in 1993. Originally available only on Quadra AV models, it was later integrated with the System 7.1.2 release of the Macintosh system software. With the release of Mac OS X v10.4 it was featured as #12 on their list of features. In OS X Mountain Lion, Speakable Items has been relocated to the Accessibility panel in System Preferences.  Automation  Mac OS X v10.4 added Automator workflows which can also be used as Speakable items. If a workflow is saved as an application and put in the Speakable items folder it becomes available to the speech recognition software. The words the computer will recognize to execute the command will be the name of the saved Automator application. Some words might have to be misspelt for the computer to know the proper pronunciation. (For example, the computer best recognizes \\"Les Mis√©rables\\" as Lay Mizzer Ob). Because Automator is made to comply with AppleScript applications only, most third party or non AppleScript applications, such as Limewire or Final Cut Studio apps will not work with speakable items, unless you configure commands only with \\"define a keyboard command\\": in which you'll just select \\"this application only\\" after making a keyboard command.  Problems  While Speakable Items is useful, as well as innovative, recognition gets hard and distorted some times. # In Macs without dual beamforming microphones (pre-2012), background noise interferes with recognition, and limits the usefulness of the \\"listening continuously\\" option. # Sometimes the pronunciation the computer understands varies from the proper pronunciation. This usually happens with custom commands. # The Speakable items folder also has the abilities to open applications that are blocked by Parental Controls without an administrators permission. This is achieved by copying and application and placing within the folder and opening it from there.

Extracurricular activities Princeton offers a variety of extracurricular activities, including academic challenge team, baseball, basketball, bowling, cheerleading, chess, cross country, debate, diving, American football, golf, soccer, swimming, tennis, track and field, volleyball, water polo and wrestling. With regard to competitive activities, Princeton High School was a founding member of the Greater Miami Conference and its students have won numerous team titles, including: * Baseball, boys, champions 1970 (AAA) (won as Lincoln Heights HS, before merger) * Basketball, boys, champions 1970 (A) (won as Lincoln Heights HS, before merger) * Basketball, girls, champions 1987 (AAA), 2014 (Div 1) * American football, boys, champions 1978, 1983, 1987 (AAA) * Tennis, boys, champions 2003(Ohio Tennis Coaches' Association) * Track & Field, girls, champions 1989 (AAA) * Water Polo, boys, champions 1977, 1981; Community involvement Princeton High School encourages community involvement by both staff and students. In 2000, Princeton High School began involvement in the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society‚Äôs Pennies for Patients campaign ‚Äì renamed Pasta for Pennies in certain markets in which the Olive Garden restaurant provides sponsorship. Princeton High School was again the top fund-raising school in the nation in 2008, when they raised over $46,000 during the three-week campaign. Princeton High School staff and students are also active in other charitable endeavors, hosting an annual Relay For Life since 2003. This event has raised as much as $38,000 from one overnight Relay event.

Only female flies are attracted to the song, and they deposit living larvae on and in the vicinity of calling males. The larvae burrow into and eat the cricket who dies in about 7 days when the flies pupate. This was the first example of a natural enemy that locates its host or prey using the mating signal of the host/prey.Cade, W. H. 1975.

He played as a safety with the Green Bay Packers in the National Football League (NFL). Wood was an eight-time Pro Bowler and a nine-time All-Pro. In 1989, Wood was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Wood played college football for the USC Trojans, becoming the first African-American quarterback to play in what is now the Pac-12 Conference. Undrafted out of USC, he was granted a try-out with Green Bay. Wood changed his position to safety in his rookie year, and played for the Packers from 1960 to 1971, winning five NFL championships. He later coached in the NFL, World Football League (WFL), and Canadian Football League (CFL). College career After graduating from Armstrong High School in Washington, D.C. in 1956, Wood went west and played college football in southern California, playing his freshman year at Coalinga Junior College, where he was a junior college All-American. He transferred to the University of Southern California in Los Angeles in 1957 and played for the Trojans under first-year head coach Don Clark. While there he was the first African American quarterback in the history of the Pacific Coast Conference and its successor AAWU, now the Pac-12 Conference. Wood also played safety. As a junior in 1958, he was sidelined with an injured shoulder, and as a senior in 1959, he separated his right shoulder and missed several games. NFL career Wood was not selected in the 1960 NFL draft, and wrote a letter to head coach Vince Lombardi to request a tryout; the Packers signed him as a rookie free agent in 1960. After a few days with the quarterbacks, he requested a switch to defense and was recast as a free safety, and was a starter in the season. He started until his retirement in 1971. Wood won All-NFL honors nine times in a nine- year stretch from 1962 through the 1971 season, participated in the Pro Bowl eight times, and played in six NFL championship games, winning all except the first in 1960. Wood was the starting free safety for the Packers in Super Bowl I against the Kansas City Chiefs and Super Bowl II against the Oakland Raiders. In Super Bowl I, he recorded a key interception that helped the Packers put the game away in the second half. In Super Bowl II, he returned five punts for 35 yards, including a 31-yard return that stood as the record for longest punt return in a Super Bowl until Darrell Green's 34-yard return in Super Bowl XVIII. He led the NFL in interceptions and punt return yards in 1962. Wood finished his 12 NFL seasons with 48 interceptions, which he returned for 699 yards and two touchdowns. He also gained 1,391 yards and scored two touchdowns on 187 punt returns. He holds the record for the most consecutive starts by a safety in NFL history. Wood retired as a player after the 1971 season; he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1989, and the Packers Hall of Fame in 1977. Coaching career After retiring as a player in January 1972, Wood became the defensive backs coach for the San Diego Chargers. In 1975, he was the defensive coordinator of the Philadelphia Bell of the WFL and became the first African-American head coach in professional football of the modern era in late July, days before the first game of the season. The Bell's season lasted only 11 games when the league folded in October. Wood was later an assistant coach for the Toronto Argonauts in the CFL under Forrest Gregg, a Packer teammate. When Gregg left after the 1979 season for the Cincinnati Bengals in the NFL, Wood became the first black head coach in the CFL, but after an 0‚Äì10 start in 1981, he was fired. Personal His son, Willie Wood Jr., played for (1992‚Äì1993) and later coached the Indiana Firebirds in the Arena Football League, after coaching at Woodrow Wilson High School in Washington, D.C. Wood Jr. also served as the wide receiver/defensive backs coach and special teams coordinator for the Cleveland Gladiators of the Arena Football League. Wood later lived in Washington, D.C. and underwent replacement knee surgery. In his later years, he had dementia. Wood died of natural causes on February 3, 2020 at an assisted living facility in Washington, D.C. at the age of 83. In March 2012, a block of N Street NW in D.C.

Since a state cannot afford to track the many individuals who do business on an itinerant basis, the ones targeted are usually very wealthy and high profile, namely professional athletes. Not only are the working schedules of famous sports players public, so are their salaries. The state can compute and collect the amount with very little investment of time and effort. History While \\"jock taxes\\" date to the 1960s, states started aggressively taxing the income of non-resident athletes in 1991, when California imposed the tax on the earnings of Chicago Bulls players who traveled to Los Angeles to play the Lakers in that year's NBA Finals. Illinois soon retaliated, imposing its own \\"jock tax\\" on out-of-state players‚Äîalthough Illinois' tax is only imposed on athletes from jurisdictions that impose jock taxes on Illinois-based players. Other states followed suit; by 2014, the only U.S. jurisdictions with major professional teams without a jock tax were Florida, Texas, Washington state, and Washington, D.C. (the three states do not impose personal income taxes, while the U.S. Congress specifically prohibits the District of Columbia from imposing its income tax on non-residents who work there). States are not the only U.S. jurisdictions that impose jock taxes‚Äîseveral cities impose their own jock taxes on top of those levied by their states. For example, since 2005, Pittsburgh has assessed what it calls the Non-Resident Sports Facility Usage Fee‚Äîa 3% tax on income derived from an individual's participation in any paid- admission event in a publicly funded venue, as long as the individual is not a city resident. In depth The following is an in-depth analysis of modern- day examples and criticisms of the jock tax. = Examples =  Alex Rodriguez  After the 2000 Major League Baseball season, Alex Rodriguez signed what was then the largest contract in American sports history, a ten- year contract worth $252 million, with the Texas Rangers. The tax collecting authorities of other states were notified alongside the public, and would separately demand that Rodriguez's employer withhold the tax due from his salary and remit it to each of them. Even though the state of Texas did not have an income tax, he still had to pay the various state income taxes applied to each away game in each location except for Florida, Illinois, Washington state, and Washington, D.C. (as an American League player, he would visit the three states every season). It is estimated that Rodriguez paid $520,000 a year for state income taxes outside his own state.  Tennessee \\"privilege tax\\"  Tennessee, which has only a limited income tax that excludes wages and salaries, began imposing its own special form of jock tax in July 2009, which it called a \\"privilege tax\\", and later repealed in April 2014. The tax was unique in several respects. First, it was a flat-rate tax of $2,500 per game, imposed on all players who were on a team's roster for a game in the state, including Tennessee residents. However, the tax applied to a maximum of three games per calendar year. In another quirk, NFL players were exempt‚Äîwhen first imposed, the tax only applied to NBA and NHL players. In addition, the tax did not go to the state treasury. Instead, taxes imposed on NHL players went to the operators of Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, home to the Nashville Predators, while taxes imposed on NBA players went to the operators of FedExForum in Memphis, home to the Memphis Grizzlies (both teams are Tennessee's only representatives in their respective leagues). Finally, because the tax was categorized as a fee, it could not be claimed as a deduction on other states' tax returns. Because of the quirks of the tax, some players on visiting teams were required to pay more in privilege taxes than they earned from games played in the state. Another individual who was disproportionately affected by the tax was Chris Johnson, who earned $54,000 for eight games with the Grizzlies under two 10-day contracts in , but was still subject to the full $7,500 privilege tax‚Äîthe same amount collected from Grizzlies players who were on the team for an entire calendar year. The collective bargaining agreement that ended the 2012‚Äì13 NHL lockout called for team owners to pay their players' privilege taxes. The Tennessee privilege tax was repealed in April 2014; the lead sponsor of the repeal bill noted that because the tax was imposed on NBA and NHL players but not on NFL players, it was constitutionally suspect. It stopped being collected from NHL players starting with the , while the tax continued to be collected from NBA players through the 2015‚Äì16 season.  Andrew McCutchen  In 2015, Andrew McCutchen, then an outfielder with the Pittsburgh Pirates, inadvertently left the first page of his direct deposit pay stub for May 1‚Äì15 in the visitors' clubhouse at Wrigley Field after the Pirates finished a three-game series against the Chicago Cubs. The stub was found by a visitor during a stadium tour and posted online. (McCutchen was not financially harmed by the exposure because the posted stub contained no bank routing numbers.) It revealed that he had state taxes for Illinois and Missouri, as well as city taxes for Philadelphia and St. Louis, withheld. In addition, Arizona, Ohio, and the city of Cincinnati were listed as potential tax recipients, but no money was withheld for those jurisdictions because the Pirates did not play in those places during the stated period. The stub also indicated that other taxable locales were \\"continued on next stub\\", which was not found by the visitor and thus never posted.  Brock Osweiler  A 2018 Sports Illustrated story on NFL players' tax situations began by examining the unusual 2017 tax situation of Brock Osweiler. In 2016, Osweiler played for the Houston Texans in the income tax-free state of Texas, giving him what writer Andrew Feldman called a \\"tax filing [that] was about as simple as you can get for an NFL player\\", paying other states only for the days he actually spent in those jurisdictions. At the time, he maintained his residency in Texas. During the 2017 offseason, he was traded to the Cleveland Browns, but was cut after the team's last preseason game and picked up by the Denver Broncos, with the Browns paying almost all of his $16 million contract for that season while he played in seven games for the Broncos. Feldman added, \\"So what did his tax bill come to? The experts say ... they‚Äôre not sure. (emphasis in original) In 2017, Osweiler was indisputably liable for about $150,000 in Ohio state income tax for the time he spent in the Browns' preseason training camp at Baldwin Wallace University in Berea. However, even though the Browns paid almost all of his season salary, an attorney with the Ohio Department of Taxation told SI that even though almost all of his income that year came from an Ohio source, the state could not tax him on income that was earned while he was not present in the state (assuming that Osweiler did not become an Ohio resident). According to several tax accountants consulted by SI, Osweiler was liable for $600,000 in Colorado income tax based on his time spent in that state, plus another $150,000 to the other states in which he played in 2017. One accountant suggested a different possibility: > One CPA suggests that Ohio and Colorado could both claim they deserve that > $600,000, forcing an appeal and possible federal court case. The result > could depend on whether the Browns paid Osweiler a lump sum before he left > Ohio, or if he continued getting weekly payouts.(emphasis in original) =Criticism of the \\"jock tax\\"= In 2003, the Tax Foundation conducted a study on the jock tax. It concluded that the tax is: *Poorly targeted *Arbitrarily enforced *Unrealistically burdensome to athletes According to the foundation, the jock tax \\"forces traveling professionals to file potentially dozens of state and local income tax returns annually.\\" The foundation argues that the jock tax is poor tax policy. An analyst for the foundation pointed out in 2014 that because taxes are imposed on everyone who travels with a professional sports team, many individuals subject to the tax are not the stereotypical highly-paid athletes: > Many trainers and scouts do not earn much more than the national median > income, and players earning the league minimum in some leagues, such as > Major League Soccer, earn only around $35,000 per year. This can lead to a > substantial tax complexity burden because many team members have to file > income taxes in around 15-20 states each year. ... the tax hits many people > who may not be able to easily absorb the substantial compliance costs > associated with the tax. The aforementioned 2018 SI story further illustrated this complexity. Because the Dallas Cowboys split their 2017 training camp between Oxnard, California and Texas, wide receiver Dez Bryant was subject to $10,000 in state income tax for every day the team spent in Oxnard. In the same year, the Miami Dolphins trained in Oxnard in the days following Hurricane Irma, subjecting the team's on-site personnel to California's income tax for that period. Ndamukong Suh was subject to more than $50,000 in California income tax during this time. One unnamed 2016 All-Pro had federal, state, and city tax filings for that year that totaled 400 pages, and during the team's bye week went on a vacation to income tax-free Florida that saved him $20,000 in income taxes. One major sports league was able to partly address this issue. MLB successfully lobbied Arizona in the 1990s for an exemption from non-resident state income taxes during spring training. Since that time, the only players who are subject to Arizona income tax during spring training are those who make their permanent residence in the state. Similarly, during the season, the only players who are subject to non-resident Arizona income tax are those present for Arizona Diamondbacks games.

It is a sprawling shrub that can reach up to 10 feet in height. The leaves, which range from an inch in width to about five inches, vary in their shapes. They have a velvety feel to them. The small hibiscus-shaped flowers generally hang downward. Though charming up close, the flowers can be hidden by the much larger leaves and not often visible at a distance.

The center or staminal column is yellowish. It inhabits dry forests on the islands of LƒÅnai, Maui, Oahu and Hawaii. It is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List; only about 450‚Äì500 plants remain in fewer than ten naturally occurring populations throughout the islands. The rarity of this plant can be attributed to the alteration of its habitat for agricultural and urban development, overgrazing by livestock and feral animals, and competition from invasive weeds.

He was forced to resign in the aftermath of the Yom Kippur War. Early life David (Dado) Elazar was born in Sarajevo, and of Sephardic heritage. He emigrated to Palestine in 1940 with the Youth Aliyah program and settled on kibbutz Ein Shemer. He soon joined the Palmach and fought in many important battles during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, including the Battle of San Simon Monastery in Jerusalem. As a soldier, he advanced through the ranks, eventually serving as commander of the famous HaPortzim Battalion of the Harel Brigade. David Elazar addressing members of Harel Brigade. 1948. Rafael Eitan standing on left. Elazar remained in the army after the war, transferring to the armored corps following the 1956 Sinai campaign. He served as deputy to the commander of the corps, Haim Bar Lev, taking over as commander of the armored corps in 1961. He remained in this position until 1964, when he was appointed Chief of the Northern Command, a position he held until 1969. During the Six-Day War of 1967 he was a crucial advocate for the occupation of the strategic Golan Heights, which was then a part of Syria, and he oversaw the capture in just two days. After the war, Elazar served as the chief operations officer on the general staff. On 1 January 1972, he was appointed Chief of Staff. Chief of General Staff The first months of his tenure were spent combating terrorism. On 30 May, the Japanese Red Army killed 25 civilians and wounded 71 more at an attack on Lod Airport, Israel's leading transportation hub (see: Lod Airport Massacre). On 5 September of that year, another group attacked Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. The attack became known as the Munich Massacre. In response to these attacks, Elazar ordered what was, until then, the largest strike against Palestinian bases in Syria and Lebanon. Three Syrian jets were downed, and dozens of fedayeen were killed in a heavy artillery barrage. In Operation Spring of Youth, which took place on the night of 9‚Äì10 April 1973, dozens more Palestinians, including several key Palestinian leaders, were assassinated in Beirut by the IDF.Gal Perl Finkel, Don't 'poke the bear' in Syria, The Jerusalem Post, October 6, 2018. One of the decisions made by Elazar during his tenure was the order to down a Libyan passenger jet that strayed into Israeli airspace and was suspected to be on a terrorist mission when it did not respond. The plane was shot down by the Israeli Air Force over the Sinai Peninsula under direct orders from Elazar, killing over 100 civilians. Only later was it discovered that this was a civilian aircraft that had made a navigational error. On 27 May 1973, the IDF announced a state of emergency and reserve troops were called up in response to a movement of Egyptian troops. The state of emergency was cancelled when it became clear that this was only an exercise. This event had a major impact on the General Staff, as it led them to believe that the Egyptian forces were not preparing for war, later that year, on Yom Kippur. After the war however, it became apparent that these frequent maneuvers carried out by the Egyptians were part of an elaborate ruse meant to induce complacency in the Israelis regarding the true intentions of Egyptian troop movements at the time the actual attack took place. On 13 September, Israel shot down thirteen Syrian fighter jets, which had attempted to down Israeli aircraft. The Yom Kippur War =Events leading up to the war= In 1957, Israel was forced, under American pressure, to withdraw from the Sinai which it had occupied since attacking Egypt the previous year. Closing the Tiran strait to Israeli ships by Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1967 was one of the major causes for the 1967 war, during which Israel re-occupied the Sinai peninsula. On 1 October 1973, the armies of Egypt and Syria were placed on alert. Due to an erroneous intelligence assessment and poor decisions by the Israeli military, the IDF responded with only limited measures, few reserve units were called up, and it was determined that war was \\"unlikely.\\" In the early hours of 6 October (on Yom Kippur, the holiest of the Jewish holidays), Elazar finally became convinced that war would indeed break out that same day, even though the Chief of Military Intelligence Major General Eli Zeira and the Minister of Defense Moshe Dayan still believed that this was highly unlikely. Dayan's conviction had two major consequences: #Dayan refused to approve Elazar's request for a general call-up of the reserves (Elazar nevertheless eventually decided independently on a limited call-up, beginning on 5 October). #Dayan refused to approve Elazar's recommendation that the IDF engage in a pre-emptive air strike, planned for 11:00 a.m. on Yom Kippur (the airforce was ready for the strike, but its jets never took off). =The war= At 2:00 p.m. on Yom Kippur, the armies of Egypt and Syria launched a coordinated attack against Israel. In many ways, this came as a surprise to the IDF and its command. After a series of fierce battles to block the invading armies, a failed counter-offensive in the Sinai, and heavy losses to Israel's airforce and ground troops alike, the incursion was finally halted. On 11 October, fighting in the north was pushed back across the Syrian frontier, and on 16 October, Israeli troops crossed the Suez Canal under the command of General Ariel Sharon. In the early days of the fighting, Elazar was one of very few Israeli commanders who managed to keep his cool and even maintain an optimistic view of where events were heading. This was in especially sharp contrast with the political leadership, most notably Moshe Dayan, who spoke of the \\"destruction of the Third Jewish Commonwealth.\\" At the same time, the war highlighted sharp personal differences among the top military brass, particularly along the Southern Front‚Äîsome of these differences have yet to be resolved. At one point in the fighting, Elazar was forced to replace the Chief of the Southern Command, Major General Shmuel Gonen (known as \\"Gorodish\\") with the former Chief of General Staff Haim Bar- Lev. He also enlisted the help of generals Rehavam Zeevi and Aharon Yariv, both of whom had recently retired from the IDF, as his special advisers. By the end of the war, the IDF had penetrated deep into Syrian territory. Mount Hermon, which had been taken from Israel at the start of the war, returned to Israeli control. On the Southern Front, the Egyptian Third Army was surrounded in the Sinai, and Israeli troops had occupied the southern sector of the west bank of the Suez Canal fighting with the unconventional tactics of General Ariel Sharon. Nevertheless, despite these military achievements, Israel paid dearly in casualties, and the Egyptians still held some territory east of the canal, and none of the major cities were captured, although Suez was under siege.Gal Perl Finkel, Wars are won by preparation and not by courage alone, The Jerusalem Post, April 8, 2017. =The aftermath= The high casualty rate and the fact that Israel was caught unprepared, in terms of both intelligence and operations, led to a wave of public protests throughout the country. On 21 November, as soon as the war ended, the Agranat Commission was set up to investigate why the IDF was so poorly prepared for the war. The commission met for several months. It held 140 sessions and listened to dozens of witnesses before releasing its interim report on 1 April 1974, calling for Elazar to be removed as Chief of Staff. The report stated that \\"Elazar bears personal responsibility for the assessment of the situation and the preparedness of the IDF\\" and recommended that he and the chief of military intelligence Eli Zeira be removed from their posts. Elazar immediately submitted his resignation to the government, claiming that he had been mistreated, especially since the report suggested no sanctions against the country's political leadership. He also complained that his actions during the war were never considered. In his resignation letter, Elazar wrote: Elazar's grave in Mount Herzl On 15 April 1976, he died of a heart attack while swimming. He is buried on Mount Herzl, Jerusalem. Legacy David Elazar, popularly known as \\"Dado,\\" remains a controversial figure in Israel to this very day. The conclusion made by the Agranat Commission that he was personally responsible for the failure to prepare for war was not fully accepted by the public. The consensus today holds that Elazar was an extremely capable war leader who kept his cool in a crisis situation and made the correct strategic decisions.Rabinovich, Abraham (25 October 2016) \\"What Could Have Been if Israel Had Prepared Differently 43 Years Ago?\\", The Jerusalem Post Israeli General Aviezer Ya'ari, head of the IDF's research department credits two specific decisions made by Elazar relatively early in the fighting as crucial to achieving Israel's eventual tactical victory in the war despite the significant setbacks it suffered initially. One was Elazar's decision to shift divisional reserve forces that were being held opposite the Jordanian border in the event Jordan was to enter the war to the Golan Heights sector instead. These forces then proved instrumental in first halting the Syrians' rapid advance, then turning the tide of battle against them. The second was his decision, despite vigorous objections from his field generals, to postpone further counter-attacks in the Sinai until the Egyptians, which had dug in defensive positions alongside the east bank of the Suez Canal, first started an offensive push eastwards from those positions. This led to the Battle of the Sinai, which was fought on terms better suited to Israeli tactics and which they decisively won, thus weakening overall Egyptian resistance and facilitating a hard-fought but eventually successful counteroffensive that allowed the IDF to cross the Suez Canal and trap most of the Egyptian Third Army on its eastern bank by the end of the war.

In 1776 James Vickers took over the manufacturing himself and remained as owner until his death in 1809, when the company passed to his son John and son-in-law Elijah West. In 1836 the company was sold to John Vickers's nephew Ebenezer Stacey (the son of Hannah Vickers and John Stacey). After the development of electroplating with silver in 1846, Britannia metal was widely used as the base metal for silver-plated household goods and cutlery.

Darby) refers to the Bible as translated from Hebrew and Greek by John Nelson Darby.  History and principles  Darby published a translation of the New Testament in 1867, with revised editions in 1872 and 1884. After his death, some of his students produced an Old Testament translation based on Darby's French and German translations (see below). The complete Darby Bible, including Darby's 3rd edition New Testament and his students' Old Testament, was first published in 1890. Darby's purpose was, as he states in the preface to his English NT, to make a modern translation for the unlearned who have neither access to manuscript texts nor training and knowledge of ancient languages of the Scriptures. He was the principal scholar for a number of translations ‚Äì and not the sole translator of any one of the various translations that bear his name. He worked with various brethren who had academic and spiritual qualifications. He also acknowledges dependence on the critical work of Samuel Prideaux Tregelles and various other scholars. Darby's translation work was not intended to be read aloud. His work was for study and private use. In his own oral ministry he generally used the English KJV. When Darby first issued his New Translation into English he wrote in the preface to the Revelation: \\"if the reader find my translation exceedingly similar to Mr. William Kelly's, I can only rejoice in it, as mine was made a year or two before his came out, and he has never seen mine up to the time of my writing this ...\\" (Darby went on to write that his New Testament translation had been lying by him for some years then.) In his introduction to the 1871 German version, he wrote, \\"In the issue of this translation, the purpose is not to offer to the man of letters a learned work, but rather to provide the simple and unlearned reader with as exact a translation as possible.\\" In the Old Testament Darby translates the covenant name of God as \\"Jehovah\\" instead of rendering it \\"LORD\\" or \\"GOD\\" (in all capital letters) as most English translations do. Among other widely used translations aside from The Darby Bible other versions such as Robert Young's Literal Translation (1862, 1898), The American Standard Version (1901), Recovery Version (1991), and the Jehovah's Witnesses' New World Translation (1961, 1984, 2013) have followed this practice. The footnotes of many editions (such as the 1961 Modified Notes Edition) of Darby Bible's New Testament indicate where \\"Lord\\" (\\"Kurios\\" in Greek) in the scripture text probably refers to Jehovah. The 1961 Modified Notes Edition of the Darby Bible includes the 1871 New Testament Preface, which says in part: \\"All the instances in which the article is wanting before Kurios are not marked by brackets; but I give here all the passages in which Kurios, which the LXX employ for Jehovah, thence transferred to the New Testament, is used as a proper name; that is, has the sense of 'Jehovah.'\\" It then gives a listing of those places. For some verses the Darby New Testament has detailed footnotes which make reference to his scholarly textual criticism comparisons. Critics of the Darby Bible include Charles Spurgeon.  Example verses  Genesis 1:1-3 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. And the earth was waste and empty, and darkness was on the face of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light. And there was light. Isaiah 34:14 And there shall the beasts of the desert meet with the jackals, and the wild goat shall cry to his fellow; the Lilith also shall settle there, and find for herself a place of rest. Psalm 119:89 LAMED. For ever, O Jehovah, thy word is settled in the heavens. Matthew 6:9-13 Thus therefore pray *ye*: Our Father who art in the heavens, let thy name be sanctified, let thy kingdom come, let thy will be done as in heaven so upon the earth; give us to-day our needed bread, and forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors, and lead us not into temptation, but save us from evil. John 1:1-3 In [the] beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.*He* was in the beginning with God. All things received being through him, and without him not one [thing] received being which has received being. John 7:16‚Äì17 Jesus therefore answered them and said, My doctrine is not mine, but that of him that has sent me. If any one desire to practise his will, he shall know concerning the doctrine, whether it is of God, or that I speak from myself. Philippians 4:13 I have strength for all things in him that gives me power. Other languages =German= The Darby Bible in German is known as the \\"Elberfelder Bibel\\". Julius Anton von Poseck (1816‚Äì1896) had been translating some NT Epistles into German. In 1851 he sent his work in progress to Darby for review. This stimulated Darby to begin work in 1854 on a full translation and he proceeded on the German translation with von Poseck and Carl Brockhaus (1822‚Äì1899). The German NT was published in 1855. When von Poseck moved to England in 1857, the Old Testament translation was made by Darby, Brockhaus and a Dutch Hebraist, Hermanus Cornelis Voorhoeve (1837‚Äì1901). The OT work commenced 1869 and was completed in 1871, when the whole Bible was published. Since then there have been a number of significant updates and revisions, including the revisions in 1960, 1975, 1985 by R. Brockhaus Verlag Elberfeld (entitled: \\"Elberfelder Bibel\\") and most recently in 2003 by Christliche Schriftenverbreitung H√ºckeswagen (entitled: \\"Elberfelder √úbersetzung, Edition CSV H√ºckeswagen\\"). Darby's principles of translation are in the Introduction to his German translation of the New Testament: > \\"Now whilst the learned can examine the original text, this privilege is out > of the reach of the unlearned, and of those unacquainted with that text. It > has therefore been our endeavour and object to give a helping hand to the > latter class, and to furnish them at a small cost with as faithful and exact > a representation as possible of the divine word in their own language. > Undoubtedly every translation must be more or less defective, and we by no > means value our work so highly as that we would set aside one more perfectly > executed by another hand. How great the difficulties are of conveying the > expressions of one language, especially of the rich Greek, in another, those > alone can tell who have tried to make a translation. [...] We might indeed > have clothed many passages in more elegant German, but, without being in > bondage to words, we have been governed throughout by the thought that the > faithful rendering of the original text outweighs every other consideration; > and the more so because we believe with the very fullest conviction the > divine inspiration of the holy scriptures as the revelation of the infinite > wisdom of God, and the expression of His gracious character in Jesus Christ. > But since no one is able to grasp the whole expanse of this revelation, and > often a meaning beyond the comprehension of the translator lies hidden in a > sentence, which would be lost in a free translation but may be found in a > more literal one, through deeper teaching of the Holy Spirit‚Äîit is evidently > necessary to reproduce the original text as in a mirror.\\" =French= William Joseph Lowe (1840‚Äì1927) and Pierre Schlumberger were in the translation team for the Pau-Vevey French translation which was first issued in 1859. The title page read, 'Les Livres Saints Connus sous le Nom de Nouveau Testament. Version nouvelle.' Darby worked on this project in Pau, Southern France, but the work was done primarily for the numerous Brethren in French-speaking Switzerland. The translation of the New Testament was reissued in 1872, 1875 and 1878. The complete Bible appeared in 1885. =Dutch= The 'Darby' New Translation of the New Testament in Dutch is chiefly the work of H. C. Voorhoeve, but he seems to have leaned somewhat on the labours of the German team. His work has gone through a number of revisions. The most recent (5th) edition of the Voorhoeve Testament known as the 'Telos' translation is the work of J. Klein Haneveld, Willem J. Ouweneel, Henk P. Medema and Gerard H. Kramer in 1982. This last edition has been updated and is republished by Grace Publishing House in 2018. An anonymous 'Darby' type translation of the Psalms also exists and is available from Uit Het Woord Der Waarheid, Aalten, Netherlands. =Italian= Numerous biographies of Darby suggest he completed work on an Italian New Testament. His work has not been located but a translation based on his French work was completed by Plymouth Brethren members, Edward Lawrence Bevir (1847‚Äì1922) (one of JND's peers) and revised by Alexander Carruthers (1860‚Äì1930). The Italian NT was first issued in 1890 and a revision was completed in 1930. It is still in print (2008). =Swedish= This edition of the New Testament arose out of the peculiar tendency among the Taylor Exclusive Brethren to complete and exact uniformity. Its page layout is almost precisely similar to the English edition produced by the Taylor Brethren in 1961 and published by AB Petersons Foerlag, Gothenburg. The principal work was done by Eric Carr√©n and is in fact a tertiary translation based on the German and other Darby translations of the New Testament. The Swedish 'Darby' New Testament is still in print (2008). Previous attempts to produce a 'Darby' type translation of the New Testament had been made by a Glanton brother. He tentatively published at least two of Paul's Epistles in booklet form (copies held at Cross Archive, London). =Further languages= A number of foreign language translations show their dependence upon Darby's work. These include W. H. Westcott's Congo vernacular Bible, Victor Danielson's Faroese work and the Romanian Bible published by Gute Botschaft Verlag, Dillenburg, Germany. A Slovak New Testament has been issued by Kingston Bible Trust on the basis of Darby's work. It contains annotations by F. E. Raven.

Design and development After the Olympic games in Berlin in 1936 introduced gliding as an Olympic sport, plans were made to fly the 1940 Olympic championships with a standard design of sailplane to give each pilot the same chances. The Meise was redesigned to fit into the new Olympic class specifications. The new 'Olympia' Meise had the prescribed wingspan of 15 m (49 ft 2 in), spoilers, but no flaps, and an undercarriage consisting of a skid and a non-retractable wheel. The pilot sat all-enclosed in an aerodynamically clean fuselage made of laminated wood and topped by an acrylic glass hood. The plane could be launched by winch as well by towplane. Its wood-and-fabric construction made it easy for flying clubs to maintain, to repair and even to build the gliders from kits. A design contest to select the single Olympic glider was run by testing the prototypes of the entered and accepted designs at Sezze airfield in Italy between 20‚Äì26 February 1939. There were six evaluation pilots of different nationalities. They chose Hans Jacobs‚Äô design, the DFS Meise. Both the Meise as well as the Olympic class gained immediate enthusiastic support, and the 1940 Olympic gliding championship would probably have ended up as an all-Meise contest -- if the Second World War had not intervened and the 1940 Olympics had not been cancelled. Nevertheless, 626 Olympia Meises were built in Germany during the war by Flugzeugbau Ferdinand Schmetz Herzogenrath (601 built) and Flugzeugbau Schleicher (25). Most of the German production were among the 15,000 German gliders destroyed in 1945. 17 were also built at the time in Sweden. The design of the Olympia Meise survived the war and was taken up by a small British firm called Chilton Aircraft Ltd. The German drawings were not detailed and so entirely new drawings were made that retained the Olympia Meise's aerodynamic shape but otherwise it was a stronger and heavier aircraft. After building one prototype, which flew in 1946, the rights and drawings of the Chilton aircraft were taken up by another British company, Elliotts of Newbury (EoN). Their first EoN Olympia flew in 1947. Later variants by Elliotts continued to be produced as gliders suitable for the World Gliding Championships into the late 1950s. The Olympia was also built after the war in Germany, where series production restarted in 1956, in France as the Nord 2000 (100 built), in the Netherlands, Switzerland (12), Hungary (35) with a further twenty modified as the Cinke, Australia (3), Austria, in Czechoslovakia as the Zlin Z-25 ≈†ohaj, Brazil (7).
