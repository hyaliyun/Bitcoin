Br√©z√© had succeeded his father Thomas as court master of the ceremonies to Louis XVI in 1781.

Br√©z√© did not formally intimate to President Bailly the proclamation of the royal s√©ance until the 20th of June, when the carpenters were about to enter the hall to prepare for the event, thus provoking the session in the tennis court. After the royal s√©ance Br√©z√© was sent to reiterate Louis's orders that the estates should meet separately, when Mirabeau replied that the hall could not be cleared \\"except at the point of bayonets\\".

It is the fourth installment in the Saw film series, the third directed by Bousman. The film stars Tobin Bell, Costas Mandylor, Scott Patterson, Betsy Russell, Lyriq Bent, Justin Louis, and Donnie Wahlberg. Set concurrently with the events of Saw III, the plot follows Officer Daniel Rigg, who is put through a series of tests by the Jigsaw Killer meant to help him let go of his obsession to save everyone, while also attempting to save his partners, Eric Matthews and Mark Hoffman. The film also explores John Kramer's legacy and his ability to manipulate people into continuing his work after his death, while providing more of his backstory and an additional explanation as to why he became Jigsaw. Saw IV was the first film in the franchise to not be written by Leigh Whannell. It was released by Lionsgate in the United States on October 26, 2007, and received generally negative reviews from critics. Despite this, the film was a box office success, grossing $139 million worldwide. A sequel, titled Saw V, was released in 2008. Plot A microcassette is found in John Kramer's stomach during his autopsy, which contains a posthumous message from John that informs Detective Mark Hoffman he will be tested. Elsewhere, two men ‚Äì one with his eyes sewn shut, the other with his mouth sewn shut ‚Äì awaken in a mausoleum, chained at the neck to a winch. The muted man can kill the blinded man to get a key from his collar and free himself. After Detective Allison Kerry's death in a Jigsaw \\"game,\\" a SWAT team led by Hoffman and Officer Daniel Rigg and Kerry's FBI contacts Peter Strahm and Lindsey Perez arrive at the crime scene. Noting John and Amanda Young's physical limitations, Strahm speculates that a third accomplice was involved and becomes suspicious of Rigg, who became obsessed with saving people after Detective Eric Matthews' disappearance. That night, Rigg is attacked in his home and awakens to find a video from Jigsaw informing him that he must play a game to overcome his obsession and that Eric is alive (having been saved and held captive by Jigsaw for six months after he was left for dead by Amanda) and part of the game along with Hoffman, who has been kidnapped earlier that night; both men will be killed if Rigg doesn't complete the game within 90 minutes. Rigg finds a madam named Brenda bound to a chair in his living room and accidentally activates a trap, which tears her scalp off. He frees her but ends up killing her in self-defense when she attacks him with a knife to evade arrest. Rigg is then instructed to abduct motel owner and serial rapist Ivan Landsness. He forces Ivan into a trap, which requires Ivan to blind both of his eyes to escape. Ivan only blinds one of his eyes, and the trap dismembers him. Next, Rigg is led to a school where he once investigated the abuse of a young student, committed by her father. He finds that the student's parents are impaled by metal spikes: Rex, who has already died from blood loss, and his also abused wife Morgan, who has remained alive at his expense by pulling the spikes from both of their bodies. Rigg gives her a key to free herself, then turns on a fire alarm and goes to the location of his final test. Investigating Rigg's apartment, the agents find a clue that leads them to Jill Tuck, John's ex-wife, who reveals that she miscarried her son Gideon when Cecil Adams, a drug addict, slammed a door into her stomach while robbing her rehab clinic. The loss of their son destroyed their marriage and made John insane. At the motel, the agents learn that the room was rented out to lawyer Art Blank, John's former business partner, and the survivor of the mausoleum trap. Art is revealed to be the man overseeing the current game when he hands Eric a gun. At the school, Strahm and Perez find a puppet, whose face explodes and sends shrapnel into Perez's face. After she is hospitalized, Strahm questions Jill and learns how John ended his work with Art after falling into his depression, and that Cecil became the first victim of John's games. Strahm connects her story and a prior clue to the Gideon Meatpacking Plant, the location of Rigg's final test. Strahm arrives after Rigg, but ends up following Jeff Denlon, who is trying to pass his own game. He finds him in a sickroom with the corpses of John, Amanda, and his wife Lynn, and kills Jeff in self-defense. Meanwhile, Art pulls out a device that will free him, Eric, and Hoffman once the timer expires; if used before then, a pair of pincers will sever his spine. Realizing Rigg is meant to fail the game for them to survive, Eric shoots him to prevent him from entering the room too early, but Rigg opens the door nonetheless, which causes two ice blocks to crush Eric's head. Rigg shoots and kills Art, believing he is responsible for the game, only to learn from Art's tape recorder that his obsession with saving everyone resulted in Eric's death, who was meant to save himself. Hoffman, the actual Jigsaw accomplice, who was in no real danger, then releases himself, leaves Rigg to bleed to death, and seals Strahm in the sickroom. The film ends with Hoffman at the morgue; thus revealing that John's autopsy took place after the events of the film.

Background Sophronius of Jerusalem was instrumental in overturning Patriarch Sergius' first attempt at solving the monophysite question. The Ecthesis was another attempt by the Byzantine emperors to heal the divisions in the Christian Church over the disputes over the nature of Jesus Christ. In 451 the Council of Chalcedon had ruled that Christ did not possess one divine nature, but instead possessed two distinct natures, one fully divine and one fully human, with both acting in harmony together. This ruling was consistently rejected by the Non-Chalcedonians, who were against the idea of the two natures, maintaining that the humanity and divinity of Christ were united in one nature.Bury 2005, p. 249 Throughout the 6th century, the Byzantine Emperors either covertly encouraged this group (Anastasius I), or actively persecuted them (Justin II). By the beginning of the 7th century, the court and the religious hierarchy at Constantinople were by and large firmly in the Chalcedonian camp. However, this put them at odds with the majority Non-Chalcedonians in Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia and Armenia. Such a division was dangerous in an empire that was under threat from the Persian Sassanids, especially as the Non-Chalcedonians considered their schismatic brethren to be more of a threat than any foreign invader. Consequently, the emperors at Constantinople were always seeking some method of rapprochement to heal the breach in the church, and thereby prevent the empire‚Äôs enemies from taking advantage of the internal divisions. With the reign of Heraclius, he and the Patriarch Sergius had attempted to find common ground between the Chalcedonians and the Non-Chalcedonians by issuing the doctrine of the single energy of Christ during the mid 630s. It did gain some acceptance initially, with Pope Honorius I giving his written assent, though it is clear that he considered the problem one of terminology, not theology.Bury 2005, p. 252 However, this compromise position was firmly opposed by the Patriarch of Jerusalem, Sophronius, and the doctrine was repudiated at the synod of Cyprus. Release of the Ecthesis Yet Patriarch Sergius refused to give in, and in 638 he and Heraclius released a slightly amended formula, called the Ecthesis. In this revision, the question of the energy of Christ was not relevant. Instead, it promoted the belief that while Christ possessed two natures, he had only a single will.Norwich 1990, p. 309 This notion of Monotheletism, the Doctrine of the Single Will as proscribed in the Ecthesis was sent as an edict to all four eastern metropolitan sees. A copy was posted in the narthex of Hagia Sophia, and when Sergius died in December 638, it looked as if Heraclius might actually achieve his goal, with the eastern patriarchs agreeing to the formula, and gaining many adherents across the east, including Cyrus of Alexandria and Arkadios II of Cyprus. But during 638 in Rome, Pope Honorius I who had seemed to support monothelitism died. His successor Pope Severinus condemned the Ecthesis outright, and so was forbidden his seat until 640. His successor Pope John IV also rejected the doctrine completely, leading to a major schism between the eastern and western halves of the catholic church. When news reach Heraclius of the Pope‚Äôs condemnation, he was already old and ill, and the news only hastened his death, declaring with his dying breath that the controversy was all due to Sergius, and that the Patriarch had pressured him to give his unwilling approval to the Ecthesis.Norwich 1990, p. 310 Aftermath This was the final attempt to win over the Non-Chalcedonians to union with the Chalcedonians by means of a theological compromise. The areas that were largely Non-Chalcedonian were soon overrun by the Islamic armies that poured in from the sands of Arabia in 634. The new conquerors allowed the Non-Chalcedonians to practice their faith in peace, which suited them since they no longer had the need to bend their beliefs to the Byzantine hierarchy. Since the areas that remained to the empire were largely Chalcedonian, the need to reach a theological compromise soon disappeared. Yet the Byzantine emperors were still not finished with the doctrine of Monotheletism. Constans II, the grandson of Heraclius was not a supporter of Monotheletism, and was determined to end the dispute with the west. Consequently, he ordered that all discussion about the Monothelite doctrine was to cease and that all theological positions were to be as before the Monothelite controversy erupted, issuing his Typos in 648 to this effect.Norwich 1990, p. 317 This directive was ignored in the west, as the ecthesis was condemned by the Lateran Council of 649. This infuriated emperor Constans who ordered the arrest and trials of Pope Martin I and Maximus the Confessor. The persecutions of the zealous prosecutors only ended with the death of Constans in 668, and Monothelitism was officially condemned at the Third Council of Constantinople (the Sixth Ecumenical Council, 680‚Äì681) in favor of Dyothelitism, which put to rest the issue of the ecthesis.

In all, 59 programmes were newly approved: 33 PhD programmes, 13 M.A, M.Sc, M.A(Ed) and M.Sc(Ed) programmes and 13 B.A and B.Sc programmes. Vice Chancellors Professor Olukayode Oyesiku was its first Vice-Chancellor.TASUED site He was succeeded by Professor Segun Awonusi. In January 2013, Professor Oluyemisi Oluremi Obilade became the 3rd Vice- Chancellor of the university.Ogun sacks TASUED Vice-Chancellor, appoints replacement, Preminum Times, Retrieved 8 February 2016 The current Vice- Chancellor is Professor Abayomi Adelaja Arigbabu. He assumed office on 19 March 2018, as the 4th Vice-Chancellor of the institution. Colleges The university has five colleges for its undergraduate programmes and a postgraduate college. *College of Specialised and Professional Education (COSPED) *College of Science and Information Technology (COSIT) *College of Humanities (COHUM) *College of Social and Management Sciences (COSMAS) *College of Vocational and Technology Education (COVTED) *The Postgraduate College (TPC) Campus and hostels The university has halls and auditoriums such as the Otunba Gbenga Daniel Auditorium, university (e-learning) block, Alex O. Onabanjo Complex, CEPEP building, the Science Complex, and the Lecture Theatre. It also has halls of residence (hostels) for students.http://m.thenigerianvoice.com/mobile/12141/1/tai-solarin-varsity- gets-hostel.html Students also reside in hostels built by the residents of the local communities such as Ijagun, Ijele, Imaweje, and Ijebu Ode. Mosun Filani and Oluwatobi Oyinlola are notable alumni of the university.  Occupy TASUED  A new government came to power in Ogun State in 2011 led by Senator Ibikunle Amosun and attempted to scrap TASUED. Students of the institution rose up against the decision and formed the #OccupyTASUED campaign. On February 14, 2012, on one of their trips to the state house in Oke-Mosan Abeokuta, the bus conveying TASUED supporters got its tyre punctured and rolled over twice. The accident inflicted injuries on many and eventually caused the death of Olatunji Fashina aka Humble TeeJay. Layemi, Azeez Agboola (Olofin), Ishola Adebayo Crown, Owoblow, Tola Ben, and few others were also on the bus that was involved in the accident. Today, Tunji Fashina is being honoured as a hero of the successful struggle ‚Äôcause he paid the huge price with his life. The Students Union Govt (SUG) building got named after him.

It is based on the 1941 film, Dumbo. The original attraction opened at Disneyland on August 16, 1955https://d23.com/this-day/dumbo-the-flying-elephant-attraction-opens-at- disneyland/. The four other versions of the attraction were opening-day attractions at their respective parks. It is currently the only attraction that can be found at all six Disney castle parks worldwide. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Disney_theme_park_attractions One elephant from the ride is in the collection of the Smithsonian National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C., donated in 2005, on the occasion of Disneyland's 50th anniversary. Attraction Based on the character from the 1941 animated feature, the 16 ride vehicles each resemble Dumbo, and are mounted on articulated armatures connected to a rotating hub. The passengers ride in the \\"Dumbos\\" and can maneuver them up and down with a joystick that operates a hydraulic ram. The ride itself rotates counterclockwise at a constant rate. A figure of Timothy Q. Mouse, currently voiced by Chris Edgerly, rides atop the central hub. Originally at Disneyland and Magic Kingdom, the figure held a training whip and stood on a disco ball. With the exception of Tokyo Disneyland, he currently stands on a hot air balloon and holds the \\"magic feather\\". Starting in 2012, Magic Kingdom's Timothy currently spins with his magic feather on top of the attraction's marquee. Each of the parks, with the exception of Disneyland Paris, has an extra Dumbo vehicle located outside of the attraction to be used by guests for better photo opportunities. Tokyo Disneyland's photo spot differs from its three counterparts; the character is shown in his regular outfit from the original film, with a pink saddle blanket and Timothy Mouse in his hat. All of the Dumbos, with the exception of the newer Dumbo in Walt Disney World (which was added with the New Fantasyland expansion), spin counterclockwise. The newer Dumbo in Walt Disney World spins clockwise. History =Disneyland= The original design of the attraction had 10 ride vehicles which were intended to represent not the \\"one and only\\" Dumbo, but the alcohol-induced \\"pink elephants\\" scene from the film. The installation at Disneyland was manufactured by Arrow Development. The ride was scheduled to be one of Disneyland's opening-day attractions, but instead opened a month after the park's grand opening, due to flawed prototypes. For the first two years, the hub of the original Dumbo ride lacked the ball with the Timothy Mouse figure. Also, the original Dumbos has hinged ears that were supposed to flap, but failed, due to a number of mechanical problems. So, the ears remained stationary until the mid-1960s, when new Dumbos were given casts with no hinges for movement. The attraction was given another slightly \\"newer\\" modification around 1978. During his 1957 visit to Disneyland, former United States President Harry S. Truman politely declined a ride on Dumbo the Flying Elephant, due to the elephant being a Republican symbol. During the 1970s, the attraction was planned to be expanded and renamed \\"Dumbo's Circusland\\" and was displayed in \\"Disneyland Presents a Preview of Coming Attractions\\", but was cancelled. In 1983, as part of Fantasyland's major remodeling, the ride was moved to where Skull Rock used to be, allowing Dumbo's original location to be a shortcut to Frontierland. It was completely rebuilt with a kinetic toymaker- like design, although ten elephants were still used and Timothy still held the whip. In a featurette of the ride, as shown on the DVD release of the film's 70th anniversary, the head Disney imagineer, Tony Baxter, even noted that the new ride looked like one of Geppetto's inventions. In 1990, the attraction was updated with the 16 rainbow-colored vehicles (and Timothy's magic feather) originally intended for installation at Disneyland Paris, after an incident during which a bracket support broke. During the 1992 Disneyana convention, one of the original ride vehicles sold for US$16,000. Like other remaining 1955 attractions, one of Disneyland's Dumbos was painted gold in honor of the park's 50th anniversary in 2005. During that same time, Timothy's magic feather was replaced by the whip. At Disneyland, a circa 1915 band organ occasionally provides background music for the attraction. This powerful instrument can be heard more than a mile away, so it is rarely played. In 2018, the queue of the ride was expanded and is now covered with new shade structures. Also riders are now assigned to specific Dumbo elephants. The queue is now completely wheelchair accessible. =Magic Kingdom= Dumbo the Flying Elephant at Magic Kingdom, before the new Fantasyland expansion Magic Kingdom's original 1971 version of this attraction was designed differently from its 1955 Disneyland counterpart. On opening day, it not only soft-opened without Timothy and his disco ball, but the elephants created for this version oddly wore no hats. The test vehicles were eventually re-updated shortly afterwards with the elephants now wearing hats, like the Disneyland version, while Timothy and his ball were eventually added around 1972. The ride was later updated with the 16 vehicles and the new ride mechanism in 1993. However, it does not include a central water feature like its Disneyland, Disneyland Paris, and Hong Kong Disneyland counterparts; the utilidors running directly below the attraction prevented the installation of water pipes necessary for the water features to operate. Also for this version, as well as its Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland counterparts, Timothy's hot air balloon had red and white stripes, rather than rainbow stripes for the Disneyland version. In 1997, the attraction's queue was covered to provide shade and decorated with topiaries. For nostalgic visitors, a replica of Magic Kingdom's 1971 version currently exists at Tokyo Disneyland, being the only park to still feature 10 flying elephants and Timothy spinning on a disco ball. It is also the only other park, aside from Disneyland, to have Timothy holding a whip. Magic Kingdom's Fantasyland underwent a large expansion and renovation that began in 2011. The new Fantasyland was constructed in phases with the first half of the storybook circus open by mid-2012; a section dedicated to The Little Mermaid, a section dedicated to Beauty and the Beast, and the second half of storybook circus were opened by December 6, 2012, some additional attractions opened in 2013, and the final phase was the opening of the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, which soft-opened in mid-May 2014, and officially opened on May 28. Some elements of Mickey's Toontown Fair were demolished and others were rethemed to a new Storybook Circus area. An expanded Dumbo the Flying Elephant ride was built in this new location with an interactive queue. Storybook Circus began soft openings on March 12, 2012, including one of the new Dumbo carousels. The southern end of Storybook Circus had a delayed opening on March 21, 2012. During the soft openings, it was revealed that the new attraction received the water features that have been included with the attraction in many other Disney Parks around the world. However, unlike the other versions, an additional effect occurs at night when the fountain lights change colors, an effect that was picked up from the Disneyland version, but with more colors. The Dumbo vehicles, which are richly detailed and vibrantly colored, now spin clockwise from the original version, which was reconstructed next to the new one, that soft-opened on June 22. The two rides therefore rotate counter to each other. The attraction also features a new soundtrack and artwork panels at the bottom of the carousels that tell the story of Dumbo, like the Prince Charming Regal Carrousel attraction. However, a new central hub was introduced that lacks the hot air balloon with Timothy Mouse and the magic feather. This figure has been moved above the attraction's marquee. A signature feature of this version is an indoor queue themed to the Bigtop from the film. Inside guests receive ticket-themed pagers where they can wait until prompted, and small children can play in the play area themed to Dumbo's fire rescue stunt scene. =Shanghai Disneyland= Unlike the other Disney parks, this installment of the ride is the only version that is not placed at the park's Fantasyland. Instead, it is placed at the Gardens Of Imagination.

The intention is that this understanding will prevent students from contracting sexually transmitted infections, such as HIV and HPV. CSE is also designed with the intention of reducing unplanned and unwanted pregnancies, as well as lowering rates of domestic and sexual violence, thus contributing to a healthier society, both physically and mentally. Comprehensive sex education ultimately promotes sexual abstinence as the safest sexual choice for young people. However, CSE curriculums and teachers are still committed to teaching students about topics connected to future sexual activity, such as age of consent, safe sex, contraception such as birth control pills, condoms, and the ending of pregnancy, when conception does occur, through abortion. This also includes discussions which promote safe behaviors, such as communicating with partners and seeking testing for sexually transmitted infections. Additionally, comprehensive sex education curricula may include discussions surrounding pregnancy outcomes such as parenting, adoption, and abortion. The most widely agreed benefit of using comprehensive sex education over abstinence-only sex education is that CSE acknowledges the student population will be sexually active in their future. By acknowledging this, CSE can encourage students to plan ahead to make the healthiest possible sexual decisions. This ideology of arming students to most successfully survive their future sexual experiences underlies the majority of topics within CSE, including various methods of contraception and refusal skills.  History  As of 2019, sex education in the United States became mandated on a state level. It is up to each state, district, and school board to determine the implementation of federal policy and funds for sex education. 24 out of the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia mandate sex education and 34 states mandate HIV education. Where sex education is mandated, there is no federal policy requiring the instruction of comprehensive sex education. In prior years under the Bush administration, there was strong support in congress by Conservative Republicans for the sanction of abstinence-only-until-marriage sex education. Under President Obama's administration, abstinence-only-until- marriage sex education was opposed and suggested to be eliminated. Now under President Trump's administration, federal agenda has reverted back to supporting an abstinence approach. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention‚Äôs 2014 School Health Policies and Practices Study found that on average high school courses require 6.2 hours of taught class time on human sexuality, but only 4 hours or less on HIV, other sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy prevention.  Benefits  Studies have found that comprehensive sex education is more effective than receiving no instruction and/or those who receive abstinence-only instruction. Acknowledging that people may engage in premarital sex rather than ignoring it (which abstinence- only is often criticized for) allows educators to give the students the necessary information to safely navigate their future sexual lives. CSE advocates argue that promoting abstinence without accompanied information regarding safe sex practices is a disregard of reality, and is ultimately putting the student at risk. For example, programs funded under AEGP are reviewed for compliance with the 8 standards (listed below in \\"Abstinence Education Grant Program (AGEP) Requirements), but are not screened for medical accuracy. Therefore, critics believe that students under these educational programs are put at a disadvantage because it prevents them from making informed choices about their sexual health. Additionally, under these AEGP programs, health educators have referred to those that engage in sex, especially females, as \\"dirty\\" and \\"used.\\" They have also used phrases such as \\"stay like a new toothbrush, wrapped up and unused\\" and \\"chewed-up gum\\" to teach abstinence. Under a CSE model, language would be more sensitive. There is clear evidence that CSE has a positive impact on sexual and reproductive health (SRH), notably in contributing to reducing STIs, HIV and unintended pregnancy. Sexuality education does not hasten sexual activity but has a positive impact on safer sexual behaviours and can delay sexual debut.UNESCO. 2009. International Technical Guidance on Sexuality Education: An Evidence- informed approach for schools, teachers and health educators. Paris, UNESCO. http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001832/183281e.pdf A 2014 review of school-based sexuality education programmes has demonstrated increased HIV knowledge, increased self-efficacy related to condom use and refusing sex, increased contraception and condom use, a reduced number of sexual partners and later initiation of first sexual intercourse. A Cochrane review of 41 randomized controlled trials in Europe, the United States, Nigeria and Mexico also confirmed that CSE prevents unintended adolescent pregnancies. CSE is very beneficial in regards to teen pregnancy because studies show that, teen pregnancy and childbearing have a significant negative impact on high school success and completion, as well as future job prospects. A study in Kenya, involving more than 6,000 students who had received sexuality education led to delayed sexual initiation, and increased condom use among those who were sexually active once these students reached secondary school compared to more than 6,000 students who did not receive sexuality education.Maticka-Tyndale, E. 2010. A multi-level model of condom use among male and female upper primary school students in Nyanza, Kenya. Soc Sci Med, Aug 5, Vol. 71, No. 3, pp. 616‚Äì25. Epub 2010, May 5. CSE also reduces the frequency of sex and the number of partners which in turn also reduces the rates of sexually transmitted infections. UNAIDS and the African Union have recognized CSE‚Äôs impact on increasing condom use, voluntary HIV testing and reducing pregnancy among adolescent girls and have included comprehensive, age-appropriate sexuality education as one of the key recommendations to fast track the HIV response and end the AIDS epidemic among young women and girls in Africa.UNAIDS and the African Union. 2015. Empower Young Women and Adolescent Girls: Fast tracking the end of the AIDS epidemic in Africa. Geneva, UNAIDS. As the field of sexuality education develops, there is increasing focus on addressing gender, power relations and human rights in order to improve the impact on SRH outcomes. Integrating content on gender and rights makes sexuality education even more effective.UNFPA. 2014a. Operational Guidance for Comprehensive Sexuality Education: A focus on human rights and gender. New York, UNFPA. http://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/ les/pub- pdf/UNFPA%20Operational%20Guidance%20for%20 CSE%20-Final%20WEB%20Version.pdf A review of 22 curriculum- based sexuality education programmes found that 80 per cent of programmes that addressed gender or power relations were associated with a significant decrease in pregnancy, childbearing or STIs. These programmes were five times as effective as those programmes that did not address gender or power.Haberland, N.A. 2015. The case for addressing gender and power in sexuality and HIV education: A comprehensive review of evaluation studies. International Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health, Vol. 41, No. 1, pp. 31‚Äì42. https:// www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/4103115.html CSE empowers young people to reflect critically on their environment and behaviours, and promotes gender equality and equitable social norms, which are important contributing factors for improving health outcomes, including HIV infection rates. The impact of CSE also increases when delivered together with efforts to expand access to a full range of high- quality, youth-friendly services and commodities, particularly in relation to contraceptive choice.UNESCO. 2011a. School-Based Sexuality Education Programmes. A cost and cost-effectiveness analysis in six countries. Paris, UNESCO. http://www.unesco.org/new/ leadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/ED/pdf/CostingStudy.pdf A global review of evidence in the education sector also found that teaching sexuality education builds confidence,Unterhalter, E., North, A., Arnot, M., Lloyd, C., Moletsane, L., Murphy-Graham, E., Parkes, J. and Saito, M. 2014. Interventions to enhance girls‚Äô education and gender equality. Education Rigorous Literature Review. London, Department for International Development. http://r4d.d d.gov.uk/pdf/outputs/HumanDev_evidence/Girls_Education_Literature_ Review_2014_Unterhalter.pdf a necessary skill for delaying the age that young people first engage in sexual intercourse, and for using contraception, including condoms. CSE has a demonstrated impact on improving knowledge, self- esteem, changing attitudes, gender and social norms, and building self- efficacy.  Criticism  = Comprehensiveness= While CSE implementation is on the rise in the United States, it remains difficult for state officials to regulate what is and is not taught in the classroom. This is due in large part to the undefinability of CSE; CSE has the potential to comprise such a wide range of sexual information, and over-all focus varies widely between curriculums. Educators have also accused CSE as fundamentally operating as a form of \\"abstinence-plus,\\" due to the reality that CSE often involves minimal body related information and excessive promotions of abstinence. \\"So-called Comprehensive Sex Ed\\" says Sharon Lamb, a professor at the University of Massachusetts Boston, \\"has been made less comprehensive as curricula are revised to meet current federal, state, and local requirements.\\"  Inclusion of LGBT community  The LGBT population experiences health disparities associated with stigma, discrimination, negative connotations as well as stereotypes. This population is subject to systemic barriers to adequate healthcare services ultimately impacting their wellbeing and welfare negatively. The care that they are provided with often is from clinicians who are not trained well in addressing the concerns of this population. This lack of training from the provider hinders the experience and ultimately influences the quality of care and adequate delivery of healthcare. Due to discrimination and lack of cultural sensitivity that perpetuate prejudice, this population experiences limited health-seeking behaviors. Thus, making preventative services unattainable, furthermore, increasing and prolonging illnesses and ailments. Research shows higher risk of contracting HIV and other STDs; the number is increased when assessing the intersecting population of gay men of color. Lesbian and bisexual females are less likely to obtain routine care like: breast and cervical cancer screenings. Gay men are at an increased risk of prostate, testicular, anal, and colon cancers, while lesbian and bisexual women have an increased risk of ovarian, breast, and endometrial cancers. As a result stigma, discrimination, victimization, and sexual abuse LGBT youth is more likely to be involved in high-risk sexual behaviors at an earlier age. While comprehensive sex education exists in schooling, many programs do not address the needs of the LGBT community. This population faces different health disparities ultimately driven by discrimination, shortfalls of peers, the lack of parental support, community services, and school based sex education. The implementation of LGBT comprehensive sex education utilized as an intervention seeks to combat these health disparities, by informing the population of the importance of developing sexual health. Sexual health involves not only preventing disease, but also a respectful approach to sexual relationships, sexuality, and accepting an individual's gender identity and sexual orientation. The term \\"comprehensive\\" is also often misleading because some comprehensive programs do not show the holistic picture of human sexuality. LGBT advocates have long been critical of the ways in which comprehensive sex education generally promotes marriage as the end goal for students. LGBT advocates want to express other forms of relationships other than marriage. Students should have sex education that encompasses the different forms and should be allowed to exercise those forms in which they are most comfortable with. Even when curriculums claim to be inclusive of LGBT experiences, they often promote heteronormative lifestyles as \\"normal.\\" Inclusion of LGBT identities and health topics is necessary for LGBT students to feel safe and seen in their sex ed classrooms. When sex education fails to include LGBT identities and experiences, LGBT youth can be vulnerable to risky sexual behaviors and encourage negative sexual health outcomes. Due to the lack of LGBT sex education provided in schools, LGBT youth will look to peers and the internet which can lead to misinformation. When these students do not have access to or an interest in marriage they are practically erased from the CSE narrative. In Canada, a federal report showed that LGBT community has less access to health services and faces more comprehensive health challenges compared to the general population. As a result of lack of support for the LGBT population, the Comprehensive Health Education Workers (CHEW) Project emerged in October 2014. Their goal is to educate the LGBT community about topics such sexual and gender identity, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), healthy social relationships, and depression. They do this though workshops, arts‚Äêbased projects, and one‚Äêon‚Äêone meetings. The CHEW project is set exclusively to the LGBT community in order to establish a safe environment in which LGBT youth can gain resources for sex education. A cross sectional study done in New York City analyzed the sexual behaviors of high school girls. Studies found that, \\"high school girls who identified as LGBT were more likely to report substance use such as: alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, heroin, meth, ecstasy and prescription drugs. They also had higher rates of contemplating and/or attempting suicide.\\" Another study found that \\"the LGBT youth accesses health information online five times more than the heterosexual population, and these rates are even higher for LGBT youth that identify as a person of color which stems from the fact that they lack health resources. Rights, Respect, Responsibility includes an inclusive LGBT curriculum for grades K-12. By having a curriculum, such as the Right, Respect, Responsibility suggests, students will be have accurate information to all identities as well as establish a safe classroom for LGBT students. As of May 2018, only 12 states require discussion of sexual orientation and of these, only 9 states require that discussion of sexual orientation be inclusive (California, Colorado, Delaware, Iowa, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Washington). Additionally, several states have passed legislation that bans teachers from discussing gay and transgender issues, such as sexual health and HIV/AIDS awareness. Furthermore, three states require that teachers only portray LGBT people in a negative light (Alabama, South Carolina, and Texas). = School context = \\"Before the late 1800s, delivering sex education in the United States and Canada was primarily seen as a parent‚Äôs responsibility. Today, programs under the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States (SIECUS) begin comprehensive sex education in pre-kindergarten, drawing criticism related to the age at which it is appropriate to address sexual matters with children.  Federal funding for sexual education  Although there is no federal mandate that requires states to teach sexual education, there is federal funding available to assist with sexual education programs. = Abstinence Education Grant Program (AGEP) = Historically, funding for abstinence education has always been favored over CSE. In 1996, during Bill Clinton's presidency, legislation was passed to promote abstinence in education programs. Under Title V Section 510 of the Social Security Act, the Abstinence Education Grant Program (AGEP), was passed. AEGP has always been renewed before its expiration date, and each time funds gradually increase from fifty million dollars per year to seventy-five and as high as $6.75 million per state grant in 2015. The way the funds are disbursed are based on the proportion of low-income children in each state. So far, thirty-six states have been given AEGP funds.  Abstinence Education Grant Program (AGEP) Requirements  Part of Section 510(b) of Title V of the Social Security Act, contains the \\"A-H guidelines,\\" which are the eight criteria that programs must abide by order to be eligible to receive federal funding. They are as follows: :A. Has as its exclusive purpose teaching the social, psychological, and health gains to be realized by abstaining from sexual activity; :B. Teaches abstinence from sexual activity outside marriage as the expected standard for all school-age children; :C. Teaches that abstinence from sexual activity is the only certain way to avoid out-of- wedlock pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and other associated health problems; :D. Teaches that a mutually faithful, monogamous relationship in the context of marriage is the expected standard of sexual activity; :E. Teaches that sexual activity outside the context of marriage is likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects; :F. Teaches that bearing children out of wedlock is likely to have harmful consequences for the child, the child's parents, and society; :G. Teaches young people how to reject sexual advances and how alcohol and drug use increase vulnerability to sexual advances; and :H. Teaches the importance of attaining self-sufficiency before engaging in sexual activity; In addition to abiding by these 8 conditions, AGEP compliant programs cannot discuss contraception, STIs, or methods for protecting against STIs, except when describing failure rates. = Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program (TPP) = More recently legislation has pushed for funding that goes beyond abstinence only education. In 2010, President Obama introduced the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program (TPP), which provides a total of $114.5 million annually to sex education programs that are \\"medically accurate and age- appropriate.\\" TPP falls under a subsection of United States Department of Health and Human Services (\\"HHS\\") which is overseen by the Office of Adolescent Health. Funding for TPP is dispersed if \\"they emulate specific evidence-based programs promulgated under TPP.\\" = California Comprehensive Sexual Health and HIV/AIDS Prevention Education Act = In January 2016, the California Healthy Youth Act, amended the California Comprehensive Sexual Health and HIV/AIDS Prevention Education Act to include minority groups and expand health education. Before it authorized schools to provide comprehensive sex education and required that all materials are made accessible to students with a variety of needs. It also focused solely on marital relationships. It now mandates that schools provide comprehensive sex education and states that \\"materials cannot be biased and must be appropriate for students of all races, genders, sexual orientations, and ethnic and cultural backgrounds, as well as those with disabilities and English language learners.\\" Additionally, education must now include \\"instruction about forming healthy and respectful committed relationships,\\" regardless if marital status. Furthermore, it is now required to have discussions about all FDA-approved contraceptive methods in preventing pregnancy, including the morning after pill. In conclusion now requires that all sex education programs promulgated in the state should *normalize sexuality as part of human development; *ensure people receive integrated, comprehensive, accurate, and unbiased sexual health and HIV prevention and instruction; and *provide pupils with the knowledge and skills to have healthy, positive, and safe relationships.  As a human right  Some critics state that young people‚Äôs access to CSE is grounded in internationally recognized human rights, which require governments to guarantee the overall protection of health, well-being and dignity, as per the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, and specifically to guarantee the provision of unbiased, scientifically accurate sexuality education. These rights are protected by internationally ratified treaties, and lack of access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) education remains a barrier to complying with the obligations to ensure the rights to life, health, non-discrimination and information, a view that has been supported by the Statements of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) Committee, and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The commitment of individual states to realizing these rights has been reaffirmed by the international community, in particular the Commission on Population and Development (CPD), which ‚Äì in its resolutions 2009/12 and 2012/13 ‚Äì called on governments to provide young people with comprehensive education on human sexuality, SRH and gender equality. Other analysis show that comprehensive sex education is not an international right nor a human right because it not clearly stated in either a treaty nor custom. By international law, states are required to provide access to information and education about reproductive health, but this does not require a sex education curriculum. It may take different forms such as mandating that local school districts create a system for providing information to students, or mandating that health clinics and practitioners dispense information to patients.  In curricula  = Teaching methods = As CSE gains momentum and interest at international, regional and national levels, governments are increasingly putting in place measures to scale-up their delivery of some form of life skills-based sexuality education, as well as seeking guidance on best practice, particularly regarding placement within the school curriculum. Sexuality education may be delivered as a stand-alone subject or integrated across relevant subjects within the school curricula. These options have direct implications for implementation, including teacher training, the ease of evaluating and revising curricula, the likelihood of curricula being delivered, and the methods through which it is delivered. Within countries, choices about implementing integrated or stand-alone sexuality education are typically linked to national policies and overall organization of the curricula. The evidence base on the effectiveness of stand-alone vs. integrated sexuality education programming is still limited. However, there are discernible differences for policy-makers to consider when deciding the position of CSE within the curriculum. As a stand-alone subject, sexuality education is set apart from the rest of the curriculum, whether on its own or within a broader stand-alone health and life skills curriculum. This makes it more vulnerable to potentially being sacrificed due to time and budget constraints, since school curricula are typically overcrowded. However, a stand-alone curriculum also presents opportunities for specialized teacher training pathways, and the use of non-formal teaching methodologies that aim to build learners‚Äô critical thinking skills. The pedagogical approaches promoted through sexuality education ‚Äì such as learner-centred methodologies, development of skills and values, group learning and peer engagement ‚Äì are increasingly being recognized as transformative approaches that impact on learning and education more widely. As a standalone subject, it is also significantly easier to monitor, which is crucial in terms of evaluating the effectiveness of programming, and revising curricula where it is not delivering the desired learning outcomes. When sexuality education is integrated or infused, it is mainstreamed across a number of subject areas, such as biology, social studies, home economics or religious studies. While this model may reduce pressure on an overcrowded curriculum, it is difficult to monitor or evaluate, and may limit teaching methodologies to traditional approaches. = Terminology = Apart from the different teaching methods, terminology also differs. Abortion, homosexuality, abstinence have connotations and definitions that vary state. For example, the word \\"abstinence\\" may refer to disengaging from all forms of sexual activities until marriage or may refer to only disengaging from sexual intercourse. Furthermore, the degree of sexual activity that \\"abstinence\\" connotes is often unclear, because sexual behavior that is not sexual intercourse may or may not be included in its definition. As a result, students are left confused about what activities are risky and teachers do not know what they can and cannot teach. The term \\"comprehensive,\\" is also falls on spectrum, therefore can be considered an umbrella term. CSE means something radical for some institutions while it can mean something moderate and even conservative for others. According to the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States (SIECUS), the guidelines for comprehensive sexuality education are as follows: * appropriate to the age, developmental level, and cultural background of students; * respects the diversity of values and beliefs represented in the community; * complements and augments the sexuality education children receive from their families, religious and community groups, and healthcare professionals; * teaches not only about abstinence, but also contraception, including emergency contraception and reproductive choice; * teaches about lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) issues and questions issues; * teaches anatomy, development, puberty, and relationships; * teaches all of the other issues one would expect to be covered in a traditional sexuality education class; and * should be science-based and medically accurate = Sexual education exemption = Just as teaching methods and curricula vary by state, excusal from sex education also varies by state. States may have with an opt out or opt in produce. In some states, students can opt out of receiving sexual education without specifying a particular reason. In other states, students can only opt out for religious or moral reasons. In an opt-in provision, parents must actively agree to allow their children to receive sex education prior to the start of the sexual education.  Sexual content in the media  Since 1997, the amount of sexual content on TV has nearly doubled in the United States. Additionally, a study done in 2008 showed that nearly 40% of popular music lyrics contained sexual references which were often sexually degrading. These lyrics were also often accompanied with mentions of other risk behaviors, such as substance use and violence. Teens (ages 13‚Äì15) in the United States, use entertainment media as their top source for education in regards to sexuality and sexual health. Additionally, a study found that 15-19 year olds in the U.S use media far more than parents or schools to obtain information about birth control. Some studies have found that, \\"very few teen television shows mention any of the responsibilities or risks (e.g., using contraception, pregnancy, STIs) associated with sex and almost none of the shows with sexual content include precaution, prevention, or negative outcomes as the primary theme.\\" Television shows 16 and Pregnant and its spin-off, Teen Mom, which first aired on MTV in 2009 received major disapproval from some parents as they thought the shows glamorized teen pregnancy and motherhood. However, 16 and Pregnant actually led to a 4.3 percent reduction in teen pregnancy, mostly as a result of increased contraceptive use. In contrast, other data shows that exposure to high levels of sexual content on the television causes adolescents to have twice the risk of becoming pregnant in the following 3 years, compared to those who were exposed to low levels. The film Mean Girls, directed by Mark Waters shed light on the state sex education in some parts of the United States. In the film the health instructor states, \\"At your age, you're going to have a lot of urges. You're going to want to take off your clothes and touch each other. But if you do touch each other, you will get chlamydia and die.\\" This line is meant to be satirical, but it illustrates common flaws within sex education in the U.S. It depicts simplistic descriptions of sexual activity and implementation of fear without any legitimate basis. Comprehensive sex education is the main topic in the documentary The Education of Shelby Knox released in 2005 about Lubbock, Texas, which has one of the highest teen pregnancy and STD rates in the nation. The \\"solution\\" to which is a strict abstinence-only sex education curriculum in the public schools and a conservative preacher who urges kids to pledge abstinence until marriage. In 2013, How to Lose Your Virginity was released, a documentary that questioned the effectiveness of the abstinence- only sex education movement and observed how sexuality continues to define a young woman's morality and self-worth. The meaning and necessity of virginity as a social construct is also examined through narration and interviews with notable sexuality experts, such as former Surgeon General Dr. Joycelyn Elders, \\"Scarleteen\\" creator and editor Heather Corinna, historian Hanne Blank, author Jessica Valenti, and comprehensive sex education advocate Shelby Knox. Not only have films portrayed sex education, but so has social media. Platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, and others are used as a tool to uplift the narratives of marginalized communities such as persons of color and LGBT persons in hopes to \\"strengthen sexual health equity for all.\\" As a result of the mass amount of sex content in media, media literacy education (MLE) has emerged. It was created to address the influence of unhealthy media messages on risky health decisions, such as intention to use substances, body image issues, and eating disorders. A study analyzed the effectiveness of a teacher- led MLE program, called Media Aware Sexual Health (MASH), which provides students with accurate health information and teaches them how to apply that information to critical analysis of media messages. This comprehensive sex education resulted in increased intentions to talk to a parent, partner and medical professional prior to sexual activity, and intentions for condom use. Due to knowledge gaps in most sex education curricula for teens, free online resources like Sex, Etc., Scarleteen.com, and teensource.org have been created to promote comprehensive, inclusive, and shame-free sex education for teenagers.

The RSO is the principal security attach√© and advisor to the U.S. Ambassador at American embassies and consulates. Working for the U.S. Department of State as special agents, RSOs are also considered officers within the State Department acting as specialists within the United States Foreign Service. The RSO is also the senior law enforcement representative at a U.S. Embassy. Seal of the Diplomatic Security Service / Regional Security Office Authority and responsibilities Working under the dual supervision of the Chief of Mission (Ambassador) and the Diplomatic Security Service, the RSO ensures that all mandated security programs are carried out. The word \\"regional\\" derives from a historical shortage of agents, leading to many embassies with no resident DSS Agent; often an RSO would have to oversee security at several embassies and consulates. Since virtually each embassy now has an RSO, the term is largely anachronistic. In some cases, an RSO may regionally oversee security at consulates and other U.S. presence facilities from an embassy within a country. At an embassy, the RSO reports directly to the Deputy Chief of Mission, who in turn reports directly to the Ambassador. Under the RSO's direct supervision are the following groups: U.S. Marine Security Guards, Assistant RSOs, local guards, foreign service national (FSN) investigators, an office management specialist and other secretarial and staff assistants, a Surveillance Detection Unit (with a mission of detecting hostile surveillance), security engineering officers, security technical specialists, as well as Navy Seabees assigned to post. The RSO is in charge of security for all Americans assigned to an embassy (or on temporary duty to Post) that come under the authority of the Chief of Mission. The RSO's responsibility for security relates to personnel, information, physical security of embassy buildings and residences, as well as the conduct of criminal investigations, particularly those involving passport and visa fraud. At larger embassies having other law enforcement agencies in addition to the Diplomatic Security Service, the RSO chairs a law enforcement working group as the Ambassador's main law enforcement and security attach√©/advisor. This group is composed of all other U.S. law enforcement agencies that may be represented at an embassy such as ICE/HSI, CBP, FBI/LEGAT (legal attach√©), U.S. Secret Service, NCIS, AFOSI and others.

Sabac was raised by his mom and grandmother who are Sicilian Italian. Sabac grew up in the Gravesend section of Brooklyn, NY neighboring Bensonhurst and Coney Island. Sabac began his journey into hip hop as a B-Boy and aspiring Graffiti artist. At the age of 12 Sabac began exploring the art of emceeing. He would listen to the mix shows and memorize other MCs lyrics. He would then make parodies of the songs using his own lyrics. Sabac would perform at block parties, school talent shows and anywhere there was music and a mic, constantly battling other MCs. At the age of 15 while attending Lafayette High School in Brooklyn, NY, Sabac would promote parties and shows for artists like T-La-Rock, Milk and Gizmo, Big Daddy Kane, Greg Nice and many other hip hop legends. While in school, Sabac found himself getting into trouble with the law. He had to do community service at the CityKids Foundation where he ended up learning how to use his lyrics to express his pain and the things that were going on around him. He received training in Facilitation, Conflict Management, Public Speaking, Curriculum Design and Implementation and much more. He began working at CityKids between school, touring and odd jobs.

In more than four decades of practice, his work in ecological design has garnered widespread recognition for its broad- based and singular approach, one that is centered on giving voice to the land and its communities (Enlow, 6‚Äì7). Called the ‚Äúpoet laureate of landscape architecture‚Äù (Miller, 7) Jones‚Äôs poetry informs his designs (Jones, 10). His firm‚Äîco-founded with Ilze Grinbergs Jones in 1969‚Äîhas been at the forefront of the fields of landscape aesthetics, environmental planning, design for cultural spaces, and scenic and wildlife conservation (Woodbridge, 29, 60). Jones & Jones is perhaps best known for pioneering the habitat immersion method of zoo design at Seattle‚Äôs Woodland Park Zoo, but their work has also transformed design and scenic planning practices for highways, rivers, parks, forests, watersheds, and communities (Streatfield, 20). Jones & Jones is the recipient of more than 100 awards, including the first-ever Firm of the Year Award from the American Society of Landscape Architects (2003), the Richard J. Neutra Award for Professional Excellence (2007), and the President‚Äôs Award of Excellence from the American Society of Landscape Architects (1980). Early life and influences Grant Jones grew up in Richmond Beach, Washington, a small community on Puget Sound located 10 miles north of Seattle. His father was architect Victor N. Jones. His mother, Ione Thomas Jones, encouraged his exploration of nature, particularly the tide flats below the family farm. This early, intimate connection with his home landscape would shape Jones‚Äôs language and his understanding of place (Amidon, 14). Jones received a Bachelor of Architecture from the University of Washington in 1961, and remained at UW as a Graduate Poet under Theodore Roethke until Roethke‚Äôs death in 1963. His study with Roethke further strengthened his awareness of the connection between language and the natural world. With the encouragement of his professor and mentor, landscape architect Richard Haag, Jones entered the graduate program for landscape architecture at Harvard University, where he received a master's degree in 1966. While at Harvard, Jones theorized that the distinct geologic and living forms that together define a landscape are just as much a language as the linguistic units that together comprise a poem. He created a Fortran model to catalog and measure the various intrinsic elements of a landscape and evaluate their influence on its overall aesthetic value. This early Fortran computer program would later inform his firm‚Äôs ground- breaking work in visual resource assessment, including plans for the Nooksack River and Puget Sound (Miller, 7). In 1966, Jones won Harvard‚Äôs Frederick Sheldon Traveling Fellowship and spent the next two years exploring South America and Europe, searching for examples of regionally distinctive community planning, architecture, and culture. As Sheldon Fellow, Jones sought to revitalize the concept of environmental determinism, the idea that plants, animals, and people‚Äîas well as human culture and language‚Äîall evolve from their landscape, or physical environment. He also sought to demonstrate that the study of diverse cultural and architectural adaptations to place could serve as a model to improve development practices in American communities (Amidon, 19).He later went on to fund Trioango LLC for the purpose of the new construction movement. Jones & Jones Grant Jones returned to Seattle in 1969 and established Jones & Jones with his then-wife, Ilze Grinbergs Jones. Ilze and Grant had studied together at the University of Washington, and both shared the conviction that architecture and landscape architecture are inseparable disciplines (Enlow, 6‚Äì7). They had traveled together during the Sheldon Fellowship and were both strongly influenced by the principles of bioregionalism (Amidon, 21). Ilze Jones influenced the new practice through her love of the urban built environment and her interest in public green infrastructure, community building, and broad-scale environmental planning. In 1973, the two were joined by Johnpaul Jones, an architect of Cherokee-Choctaw descent whose work designing cultural spaces has received wide acclaim. Deeply rooted in his Native American heritage and closely connected to the land, Johnpaul‚Äôs designs include museums and other cultural spaces that honor and share the living heritages of indigenous people. Notable among them is the Smithsonian Institution‚Äôs National Museum of the American Indian on the Mall in Washington, D.C., for which he served as lead design consultant. Jones & Jones has grown in subsequent years to include partner Mario Campos and a staff of more than a dozen architects and landscape architects. (Enlow, 7). Landscape historian David C. Streatfield writes, ‚ÄúTheir designs interpret place as bio-physical processes, and as intertwined acts of cultural will and transformation. [‚Ä¶] Ever since its inception this firm has established new standards of excellence in analysis and creative design.‚Äù (Streatfield, 20) In conferring its highest honor, the Firm of the Year Award, the ASLA recognized Jones & Jones for ‚Äúthe unique culture it has created and its philosophy of embracing that which is challenging and unexplored. Its work and its commitment to future generations have created an enduring legacy‚Ä¶‚Äù Selected projects In the early 1970s, Jones & Jones was commissioned by the Whatcom County Park Board to develop a preservation plan for the Nooksack River in northwest Washington State. The plan identified intrinsic landscape features of high aesthetic value and made recommendations for their preservation, while suggesting other areas that would be suitable for recreational uses. The study involved mapping the river‚Äôs watershed and viewshed and then breaking it up into its component drainage basins, branches, channels, and floodplains. Each distinct river segment was then analyzed using a series of quantitative and qualitative measurements based on integrity, health, uniqueness, and resiliency. This was the first plan ever developed for a river, and the project received an Honor Award from the American Society of Landscape Architects (Amidon, 43). The analytic methods employed by Jones & Jones in the study of the Nooksack River proved valuable to other projects requiring the careful management of visual resources. These included corridor planning for utilities and the design of roads. The firm has become well known for the design of scenic roadways and wildlife highways, considering them a vital form of green infrastructure. In 1990, Jones was asked to join the design team for the expansion of the Paris to Lexington Road (aka Paris Pike), an historic 12-mile road leading from Lexington to Paris, Kentucky. The old two-lane highway could no longer handle the demands of increased traffic, but expanding the road to four lanes threatened the mature trees, historic stone fences, and original farm entrances along the route. It was the first time since World War II that a landscape architect had been approached to design a highway (Amidon, 34). Jones‚Äô solution was to break the highway into two separate ribbons that weave through the landscape independently, while ensuring that the most characteristic features of the landscape remain intact. U.S. Highway 93 crosses the Flathead Indian Reservation in western Montana, nation of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Nation (CSKT). The 55-mile stretch of road runs north from Evaro to Polson, Montana, traversing a majestic landscape of expansive valleys and mountain ranges that is home to a great diversity of wildlife, including grizzly bears, deer, elk, bighorn sheep, and painted turtles. For much of its history, the highway sliced straight through the landscape, through small communities and towns, and through wildlife habitat, resulting in the decline of some species and in numerous roadway fatalities (Jones & Jones, 1‚Äì4). Working closely with the CSKT, along with the Federal Highway Administration and the Montana Department of Transportation, Jones & Jones redesigned the highway to respond to and respect the unique aesthetic and ecological characteristics of the landscape, seeking ways for the land to influence the road. As the firm notes, ‚ÄúThe design of the reconstructed highway is premised on the idea that the road is a visitor‚Äù (Jones & Jones, 1). The design concepts for the highway, begun in 2000, sought to simultaneously encourage understanding of the land and of the communities that call it home, including the Salish and Kootenai people and rich populations of plants and animals (Jones & Jones, 1). In addition to following the topography and respecting cultural concerns, a key objective of the design process was the development of numerous wildlife crossing areas designed to ensure the safe passage of animals over or under the roadway. Road-kill data was analyzed, along with historic migration patterns, to determine where to site crossings in an effort to restore traditional wildlife movement routes. U.S. Highway 93 now features forty wildlife crossing structures. The project received the Transportation Planning Excellence Award from the Federal Highway Administration in 2008. Jones & Jones pioneered the habitat immersion approach to zoo design with the development of the gorilla and African savannah exhibits at Seattle‚Äôs Woodland Park Zoo (Hyson, 23; Hancocks, 118). In 1978, zoo director David Hancocks approached the firm for a master plan. Rather than the traditional arrangement of animal enclosures behind concrete walls and bars, Hancocks and his design team, led by Grant Jones, sought to recreate the animals‚Äô natural habitat. The gorilla forest was developed in the first phase of the project: careful manipulation of landform, plants, and sight lines immersed not only the gorillas but also the visitors in the animals‚Äô native habitat. The landscape immersion method has been described as ‚Äúan astonishing departure from conventional zoo design because it reflected a pronounced shift in philosophy‚Äù from a homocentric to a biocentric view of the world (Hancocks, 118). The philosophy is now widespread (Hyson, 23), and since the late 1970s, Jones & Jones has developed master plans and specialized habitat designs for scores of zoos on four continents. ILARIS (Intrinsic Landscape Aesthetic Resource Information System) is a GIS model developed by Jones & Jones to assess the intrinsic aesthetic value of Puget Sound. In 2002, the firm was commissioned by the Trust for Public Land to develop a system to evaluate and protect important landscape features of Puget Sound and its near-shore areas. ILARIS was based on Grant Jones‚Äô early Fortran program from his days at Harvard, as well as on Jones & Jones‚Äô breakthrough scenic planning work for rivers such as the Nooksack and Alaska‚Äôs Susitna. The model is a framework to synthesize and assess the biologic, cultural, and aesthetic values of intrinsic landscape features, and the result is a language that gives voice to the landscape and assists conservation and planning organizations in making land-use decisions. In 2005 ILARIS received a Research and Communication Merit Award from the Washington Chapter of the American Society of Landscape Architects (WASLA), and in 2006 the model won the National ASLA Professional Award of Honor in the Research Category.

Protected area Ringed by steep mountain ranges to the north, east and west, the valley is known as a habitat of tigers, but encroachment by man has greatly decreased their numbers, to perhaps as few as 100 animals.

From 1904 to 1909 they were one of the strongest teams in black baseball, winning five eastern championships in six years. The team was organized by Sol White, H. Walter Schlichter,\\"Colored Baseball Men Organize Association\\" The Anaconda Standard, Anaconda, MT, Sunday Morning, November 11, 1906, Page 2, Column 7 and Harry Smith.  Founding and first years  In 1902, white sportswriter H. Walter Schlichter joined with long-time Negro league player Sol White and Harry Smith, sports editor of the Philadelphia Tribune (an African-American newspaper), to organize the Philadelphia Giants. Schlichter arranged for the team to play in the major league Columbia Park when the Philadelphia Athletics were on the road. Sol White would play shortstop and manage the team. For their first season, the team recruited several star players including catcher Clarence Williams, second baseman Frank Grant, and pitcher John Nelson. The 1902 Philadelphia Giants compiled a win- loss-tie record of 81‚Äì43‚Äì2. Throughout the season the Giants issued challenges to the Cuban X-Giants to compete in a Negro league championship series, but the X-Giants declined. In October, their first season culminated with a two- game series against the American League champion Philadelphia Athletics. The Athletics won both games, 8‚Äì3 and 13‚Äì9.Hogan, pp. 93-97. In 1903, White acquired Harry Buckner, William Binga, Robert Footes, Bill Monroe and John W. Patterson. Attendance grew and in September the Giants again challenged the Cuban X-Giants for a championship series. This time the challenge was accepted and games were scheduled for New York, Philadelphia, and Harrisburg. The Cuban X-Giants beat Philadelphia behind outstanding pitching by Rube Foster.Hogan, p. 97; Holway, pp. 43-45.  Heyday (1904‚Äì1908)  The 1905 Philadelphia Giants The next season White recruited Foster, outfielder Pete Hill, and pitcher Danny McClellan for the Giants, and a dynasty took shape. With the Giants' growing popularity and to avoid working around the Philadelphia Athletics' schedule, they leased their own home stadium at Broad Street and Jackson Avenue in Philadelphia. A second \\"World's Colored Championship\\" was determined by a best-of-three series in September. Foster beat the Cuban X-Giants in both the first and the decisive third games for Philadelphia's first championship.Hogan, pp. 97-99; Holway, pp. 46-47. In 1905 the Giants won their second colored championship, beating the Brooklyn Royal Giants in three straight games. In 1906 the Giants joined a multiracial baseball league, the International League of Independent Professional Base Ball Clubs. In September they once again faced and defeated the Cuban X-Giants, thereby winning both the National Association championship and another \\"World's Colored Championship\\". Subsequently they played two games with the Philadelphia Athletics, losing both to outstanding pitching performances by Hall of Fame players Eddie Plank and Rube Waddell.Hogan, pp. 99‚Äì106; Holway, pp. 48‚Äì49, 52‚Äì54. In 1907, they joined the first organized black professional league of the twentieth century, the National Association of Colored Baseball Clubs of the United States and Cuba. Rube Foster, Pete Hill, and three other players left the Giants to join the Leland Giants in Chicago. With young John H. Lloyd taking over at shortstop, however, the Philadelphia Giants continued to field an excellent team and won their fourth consecutive eastern championship. In October they toured Cuba and went 10‚Äì12‚Äì1 against Habana and Almendares. In 1908 the first black championship series between the east and west was played, as the Leland Giants played the Philadelphia Giants in a \\"World Series.\\" The series ended with a 3‚Äì3 tie; it is not known why the deciding seventh game was not played. In 1909 Spottswood Poles joined the team and the Giants won another eastern championship.Hogan, pp. 115‚Äì117; Riley, pp. 625, 631; Holway, pp. 58, 62‚Äì63. For complete statistics of the 1907 Cuban tour, see  Split and decline  In 1909, White broke with Schlichter and left the Giants to take the reins of the Quaker Giants. In 1910, Lloyd also left and the Giants were no longer contenders for championships. Riley writes, \\"...after the end of the decade many of Philadelphia's remaining star players defected to other teams. The Giants' caliber of play dropped significantly as they rapidly became a minor team. Although a club continued on into the 1920s with the same name, that team cannot be equated with the original franchise.\\"Hogan, 117‚Äì120; Riley p. 625.  Demise  Lanctot says the team disbanded during the 1911 season, forced by player defections (citing the New York Age of August 3, evidently). The new Lincoln Giants of New York City had signed \\"several players, including Louis Santop and Dick Redding\\".

Jones has been rated the 75th Greatest Guitarist of all time by the Rolling Stone and placed ninth in Guitar Worlds Top 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists. With experience in special effects and set design in the Hollywood film industry, Jones is also the director of the majority of Tool's music videos. Biography =Early years and personal life= Jones was born in Park Ridge, Illinois, raised in Libertyville, Illinois. He was accepted into the Suzuki program, and continued to play violin through his freshman year in high school. As a child, he had an interest in animation, turning his ideas into three dimensional sculptures, which explains why Tool's music videos often had 3D-clay effects. He later began to play the double bass in an orchestra. In addition to playing classical music, Jones played bass guitar in the band Electric Sheep, with Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine playing guitar, until Jones moved to California (Morello soon followed). According to both of them, the band was quite unpopular at the time. Jones never received traditional guitar lessons, but instead learned by ear. On July 6, 2013, Jones married painter Korin Faught. They have two children. =Film work= Jones was offered a film scholarship but declined and chose to move to Los Angeles to study art and sculpture. His interest shifted to film, and he began to work as a sculptor and special effects designer, where he learned the stop motion camera techniques he would later apply in Tool's music videos, such as \\"Sober\\", \\"Prison Sex\\", \\"Stinkfist\\", \\"√Ünema\\", \\"Schism\\", \\"Parabola\\", and \\"Vicarious\\". He graduated in 1987. After graduation, he went to work at Rick Lazzarini's Character Shop. During the next couple of years, he worked the TV show Monsters. He designed and fabricated a Grim Reaper makeup and a zombie head on a spike (later used in Ghostbusters II) among others. After that, he went to Stan Winston's special effects workshop, where he worked on Predator 2, sculpting a unique-looking skull for the Predator's spaceship interior. Jones worked on several other films in Hollywood doing makeup and set design, including Jurassic Park, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Dances with Wolves, and Ghostbusters II. He did the \\"Freddy Krueger in the womb\\" makeup for A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child, as well as work for A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master. He also worked on commercials for salad dressing (never aired), Olympic Paints & Stains (Albert Einstein makeup), and Duracell (boxers and taxicabs). =Music career= Jones also toured with Jello Biafra/The Melvins band and contributed to their albums Never Breathe What You Can't See and Sieg Howdy!. Jones and Melvins guitarist/vocalist Buzz Osborne are close friends. Jones also appeared on the Melvins album Hostile Ambient Takeover, the Melvins/Lustmord collaboration Pigs of the Roman Empire and the Isis album Wavering Radiant. On Mr. Show, he appeared as the fictional guitarist of Puscifer along with bandmate Keenan, and can also be spotted in the audience seated at a table with Keenan in the series' first episode. On August 14, 2011, Jones performed the national anthem of the United States at the outset of WWE's SummerSlam (2011) wrestling event in Los Angeles. =Playing style= Adam Jones is known for not predominantly using any particular guitar playing technique, but rather combining many techniques such as \\"alternately utilizing power chords, scratchy noise, chiming arpeggios, off-beat rhythm patterns, and a quiet minimalism\\". On the 2019 release, Fear Inoculum, Jones used drop D tuning almost exclusively. On Lateralus and 10,000 Days, he made heavy use of triplets. Other techniques used to expand his band's sound repertoire require forms of instrumental experimentation and applications of non-instrumental experimentation as well, such as his use of an epilator as a plectrum on the √Ünima and Lateralus albums for example; continuing in this direction on the Tool song, \\"Jambi\\", Jones uses a talk box. In the song \\"Third Eye\\", he makes use of a pick slide for the opening. Live, Jones can be seen with a large pedalboard of effects, including a DOD FX-40B Equalizer (EQ) pedal, Boss BF-2 Flanger, Boss DD-3 Digital Delay, MXR Micro Amp, Dunlop BB535 and two Boss Master switch/power supply pedals among others. In a 1994 interview, he mentioned the band Helmet as an influence.http://toolshed.down.net/articles/index.php?action=view- article&id;=March_1994--Guitar_School.html =Visual art= Jones created the cover and inside liner art for many of tool's albums and also the re-release of Peach's Giving Birth to a Stone, on which Jones's fellow Tool member Justin Chancellor played bass. He helped the band Green Jell√ø with their stage personas & clothing designs. In 2007, he received the Grammy Award for Best Recording Package as art director for his work on 10,000 Days. Jones came up with the makeup the actors wore on the videos for \\"Schism\\" and \\"Parabol/Parabola\\". In his spare time, Jones shoots photography that is used for the visuals at live Tool concerts. The blending of photos and art appear on many large monitors in concert venues as well as a background for the band. The images are set in order to appear with specific songs on the set list. Jones draws his own comics, an artistic ability he developed as a young child. An X-Files/30 Days of Night crossover in 2010 was co-written by Jones and 30 Days creator Steve Niles with artwork by Tom Mandrake.

Bain Correctional Center (VCBC), also known as the Vernon C. Bain Maritime Facility and under the nickname \\"The Boat\\", is an 800-bed jail barge used to hold inmates for the New York City Department of Corrections. The barge is anchored off the Bronx's southern shore, across from Rikers Island, near Hunts Point. It was built for $161 million at Avondale Shipyard in Louisiana, along the Mississippi River near New Orleans, and brought to New York in 1992 to reduce overcrowding in the island's land-bound buildings for a lower price. Nicknamed \\"The Boat\\" by prison staff and inmates, it is designed to handle inmates from medium- to maximum-security in 16 dormitories and 100 cells. Currently the only barge in use, the Vernon C. Bain Center is the third prison barge that the New York Department of Corrections has used. In its history, the prison has served traditional inmates, juvenile inmates and is currently used as a holding and temporary processing center. The added security of the prison being on water has prevented at least four attempted escapes. The barge is named in memorial for warden Vernon C. Bain, who died in an automobile accident. In 2014, the prison barge was named the world's largest prison barge in operation by the Guinness World Records. History = Planning = Vernon C. Bain barge as seen from kayaks on the East River. In the late 1980s, the New York City Department of Correction experienced overcrowding issues in its prison complexes. The idea of temporarily alleviating the issues of a growing inmate population and dwindling space by outfitting prison ships was conceived under the administration of then Mayor Edward I. Koch. Their solution was to develop usable prison space with maritime cells and avoid complaints about building jails in densely populated neighborhoods. At the time, the prisons at nearby Rikers Island held 22,000 inmates, and with this number increasing consistently, were nearing capacity. In 1988, the Bibby Resolution and her sister ship Bibby Venture were bought by the New York City Department of Correction to serve as the first two prison ships. Both ships were previously used as British troop carriers before being re-purposed into prison ships. The Bibby Venture was docked off Manhattan's Greenwich Village, while the Bibby Resolution was located off the Lower East Side of Manhattan. They were decommissioned in 1992. In 1994 both ships were sold, leaving the Bain Correctional Center and two converted Staten Island ferries, the Wildstein and Kean, docked at Rikers Island to be used when overcrowding became an issue. = Construction = The construction of the Vernon C. Bain Center prison barge began in 1989 at Avondale Shipyard by Avondale Industries and was supposed to be finished in 1990 at the price of $125.7 million. Due to unanticipated construction problems including issues with the ventilation system, the finished barge was delivered 18 months late and $35 million over budget. The barge was originally slated to be docked at the Brooklyn Army Terminal or the mayor's mansion. The site ultimately chosen, at Hunts Point, was selected after protests arose over the other proposed sites. On January 26, 1992, the recently outfitted prison barge was brought through Long Island Sound by the tugboat, Michael Turecamo, after an 1,800 nautical mile trip. The new barge was named for well-liked and respected warden Vernon C. Bain, who had died in an automobile accident. One of the first captains of the barge under the Department of Corrections had previously been employed by the same tugboat company and had earlier captained the tugboat that hauled the barge to its current location. The new crew of the prison barge, who were placed in accordance with Coast Guard regulations, worked on the empty barge to learn the vessel operations, including the electrical and fire fighting systems. The barge officially opened for use and began accepting inmates later in 1992. = Operation = The blue and white barge as seen from the East River with the outdoor recreation area to the left and the gym in the center From the time the barge was constructed, there has been controversy about its cost. The final price was more than $35 million over budget, which attracted negative attention. The assistant correction commissioner, John H. Shanahan, claimed the price difference was because the Department of Corrections \\"never designed this kind of passenger vessel before and unfortunately there was a mistake in the original contract.\\" William Booth, the chairman of the Board of Corrections, said at the time that the prison barge would be the last barge the Department of Corrections would build because the process was too expensive and too uncertain. The Board of Corrections is an independent body that monitors city-owned prisons. Furthermore, by the time the Bain Center opened, the inmate population of New York City's jail system had started to decline. The prison barge was temporarily closed in August 1995 due to less crowded city jails, caused by a decline in arrests and inmate transfers. In late 1996, the prison was slated for reopening due to the rise in arrests from a campaign targeting drugs and drug dealers. The six-month campaign expected more than seven thousand additional arrests than usual, but the ship was not reopened until 1998 when it was used by the Department of Juvenile Justice. The Bain Center is currently used as a processing facility for inmates in the Department of Corrections system. There are three other processing facilities that each handle specific boroughs. In early 2016, New York City government officials began looking into ways to possibly shutter Rikers Island and transfer prisoners to other locations. One plan is to situate a 2,000-bed jail in the parking lot for the Bain Center. Another similar plan includes closing the barge jail. In 2018 the city released plans to phase out Rikers Island over ten years and replace it with borough-based jails. The Bain Center is included in the plan to close Rikers Island, which the New York City Council voted to approve in October 2019. Under the bill, both facilities would have to close by 2026. Facilities The by flatbed barge has 14 dormitories and 100 cells for inmates. For recreation, there is a full-size gym with basketball court, weight lifting rooms, and an outdoor recreation facility on the roof. There are three worship chapels, a modern medical facility, and a library open to inmate use. The 47,326-ton facility is on the water, and when it opened, 3 or more maritime crews were maintained under Coast Guard regulations. According to John Klumpp, the barge's first captain, in 2002 \\"the Coast Guard, after years of monitoring the prison barge, finally accepted the reality that that it was, de facto, a jail and not a boat.\\" The prison barge is located in Hunts Point in the South Bronx, about from SUNY Maritime College at Throggs Neck. The Hunts Point Cooperative Market is located nearby. At the time of the barge's opening, the area was difficult to access via public transportation.  Operations  As of 2019, the barge employed 317 workers and had an annual operating cost of $24 million. The barge's rate of \\"use-of-force by corrections officers\\" was the third-lowest among the city's corrections facilities. =Juvenile detention= A surge in the need for juvenile detention space caused the New York City Department of Juvenile Justice to lease space at the Bain Correction Center in 1998. At the time, there were over five thousand juveniles aged thirteen to eighteen years old in secure detention in New York. The barge had been unused since August 1995 but had been maintained and was ready to house inmates again. The center was used to solve the space problem and to assist in the closure of Spofford Juvenile Center. The temporary space was used for juvenile inmate processing and temporary housing for inmates prior to transfer. The underage inmates were moved out of the Bain Center and back into the Spofford facility in 1999. In January 2000, the Department of Juvenile Justice, after completing renovations to other buildings, moved out of the center. Escapes Aerial photo of Rikers Island, seen from the North. Bain Correctional Center is seen in the bottom left corner as the docked blue and white ship. The first time a prisoner tried to escape from the Bain was in 1993, when a 38-year-old prisoner was able to escape while he was supposed to be cleaning ice from the parking lot in front of the boat. The guard who was responsible for the inmate was suspended without pay due to the incident. Prior to 2002, an inmate tried to escape from the prison's recreation area by climbing the 30-foot fence equipped with razor wire. The guards' uniform boots prevented them from climbing the fence in pursuit, so they threw basketballs at the inmate to stop his escape, but he was able to successfully climb over it. He dove into the East River, where he was promptly picked up and returned by a police watercraft that was dispatched to the scene. Another escape occurred in February 2004 when the girlfriend of an inmate gave him a handcuff key. The inmate was handcuffed by one wrist to another inmate, but he was able to, without any prison employee noticing, remove the cuffs and free himself. The inmate was able to cling to the undercarriage of a prisoner transport bus to ride away from the facility. He let go of the bus in the South Bronx and walked away, but was apprehended nearly a month later. Six officers and a captain were given administrative leave due to the incident. The corrections commissioner said the escape was caused by a combination of the inmate's quick thinking and the officers' sloppy work. In early 2013, an inmate charged with petty larceny successfully slipped out of his handcuffs as he arrived at the Bain Center.

It includes the castles of Beaumaris and Harlech and the castles and town walls of Caernarfon and Conwy. UNESCO considers the sites to be the \\"finest examples of late 13th century and early 14th century military architecture in Europe\\". The fortifications were built by Edward I after his invasion of North Wales in 1282. Edward defeated the local Welsh princes in a major campaign and set about permanently colonising the area. He created new fortified towns, protected by castles, in which English immigrants could settle and administer the territories. The project was hugely expensive and stretched royal resources to the limit. Fresh Welsh revolts followed in 1294 under the leadership of Madog ap Llywelyn. Conwy and Harlech were kept supplied by sea and held out against the attack, but Caernarfon, still only partially completed, was stormed. In the aftermath, Edward reinvigorated the building programme and ordered the commencement of work at Beaumaris. Edward's wars in Scotland began to consume royal funding, however, and work soon slowed once again. Building work on all the fortifications had ceased by 1330, without Caernarfon and Beaumaris having been fully completed. The fortifications played an important part in the conflicts in North Wales over the coming centuries. They were involved in the Glynd≈µr Rising of the early 15th century and the Wars of the Roses in the late 15th century. Despite declining in military significance following the succession of the Tudor dynasty to the throne in 1485, they were pressed back into service during the English Civil War in the 17th century. In the aftermath of the conflict, Parliament ordered the slighting, or deliberate destruction, of parts of Conwy and Harlech, but the threat of a pro-Royalist invasion from Scotland ensured that Caernarfon and Beaumaris remained intact. By the end of the 17th century, however, the castles were ruinous. They became popular with visiting artists during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and visitor numbers increased as access to the region improved during the Victorian period. The British state invested heavily in the castles and town walls during the 20th century, restoring many of their medieval features. In 1986 the sites were collectively declared to be a World Heritage Site, as outstanding examples of fortifications and military architecture built in the 13th century, and are now operated as tourist attractions by the Welsh heritage agency Cadw. For much of the 20th century, the castles and walls were considered primarily from a military perspective. Their use of concentric defences, barbicans and substantial gatehouses led D. J. Cathcart King to describe them as the \\"zenith of English castle-building\\", and Sidney Toy to assess them as \\"some of the most powerful castles of any age or country\\".; In the late 20th and 21st centuries, historians such as Michael Prestwich and Abigail Wheatley also highlighted the sites' roles as palaces and symbols of royal power. The location of castles such as Caernarfon and Conwy were chosen for their political significance as well as military functions, being built on top of sites belonging to the Welsh princes. The castles incorporated luxury apartments and gardens, with the intention of supporting large royal courts in splendour. Caernarfon's castle and town walls incorporated expensive stonework, probably intended to evoke images of Arthurian or Roman imperial power in order to bolster Edward's personal prestige. The precise role of the royal architect James of St George in the construction projects, and the influence of his native County of Savoy on the designs, also continues to be debated by academics. However the primary sources do indicate he played a key role, describing him as ‚ÄúMagistro Jacobo de sancto Georgio, Magistro operacionum Regis in Wallia‚Äù or ‚ÄúMaster James of Saint George, Master of the King‚Äôs Works in Wales.‚ÄùTNA 372/131/26 History =13th‚Äì14th centuries= Background Portrait in Westminster Abbey, thought to be of Edward I The Edwardian castles and town walls in Gwynedd were built as a consequence of the wars fought for the control of Wales in the late 13th century. The kings of England and the Welsh princes had vied for control of the region since the 1070s, with Norman and English nobles and settlers slowly expanding their territories over several centuries.; In the 1260s, however, the Welsh leader Llywelyn ap Gruffudd exploited a civil war between Henry III and rebel barons in England to become the dominant power, and was formally recognised as the prince of Wales under the Treaty of Montgomery. Edward I became the king of England in 1272. Edward had extensive experience of warfare and sieges, having fought in Wales in 1257, led the six-month siege of Kenilworth Castle in 1266 and joined the crusade to North Africa in 1270. He had seen numerous European fortifications, including the planned walled town and castle design at Aigues- Mortes. On assuming the throne, one of Edward's first actions was to renovate and extend the royal fortress of the Tower of London. Edward was also responsible for building a sequence of planned, usually walled, towns called bastides across Gascony as part of his attempt to strengthen his authority in the region. Edward also authorised new planned towns to be built across England. Meanwhile, relations between Edward and Llywelyn rapidly collapsed, leading to Edward invading North Wales in 1276 in an attempt to break Llywelyn's hold on power. During the war Edward built several major castles in order to better control the region and act as bases for campaigning. Edward was successful, and the Treaty of Aberconwy in 1277 reaffirmed English dominance, dividing up most of Llwelyn's lands amongst his brothers and Edward. War of 1282‚Äì83 Reconstruction of Conwy Castle and town walls at the end of the 13th century Edward and his allies amongst the Welsh princes soon began to quarrel, and in early 1282 rebellion broke out, led by Llywelyn's brother, Dafydd ap Gruffydd. Edward responded to the revolt by mobilising a royal army of 8,000 foot soldiers and 750 cavalry, which he marched north to Rhuddlan, while in South and mid-Wales Marcher Lord forces advanced from Carmarthen and Montgomery.; Edward then mounted a naval invasion of the Isle of Anglesey and formed a temporary bridge to cross over onto the mainland, taking the war into the Welsh heartlands of Snowdonia. Llywelyn was killed that December, and in early 1283 Dafydd was captured and executed. Rather than repeating the devolved arrangements of previous treaties, Edward chose to permanently colonise North Wales instead. The remaining royal family of Llywelyn and Dafydd was crushed and their lands divided amongst major English nobles. The governance of Wales was reformed, and the arrangements set out in the Statute of Rhuddlan, enacted on 3 March 1284. Wales was divided into counties and shires, emulating how England was governed, with three new shires created in the north-west: Caernarfon, Merioneth and Anglesey. As part of this scheme, in 1283 Edward ordered the construction of new castles and walled towns across the occupied territories, in part to encourage substantial migration to the region from England.; Amongst these were the future World Heritage sites of Caernarfon Castle and its walled town, overlooking the River Seiont; Conwy Castle and its walled town, controlling a crossing point over the River Conwy; and Harlech Castle, protecting a sea port and newly established English town. Plans were probably made to establish a castle and walled settlement near the strategically important town of Llanfaes on Anglesey ‚Äì the future Beaumaris ‚Äì but were postponed due to the costs of the other projects. The new towns were important administrative centres for the new English governmental structures: Caernarfon and Harlech were the centres of new shires, and Conwy responsible for a new county. The castles were key military centres, but were also designed to function as royal palaces, capable of supporting the king and queen's households in secure comfort. Several of the projects also carried special symbolic importance.; Conwy was deliberately sited on the top of Aberconwy Abbey, the traditional burial place of the Welsh princes; the abbey was relocated eight miles inland. The native Welsh rulers had prized the former Roman site at Caernarfon for its imperial symbolism, and parts of the fortifications of the Welsh princes were seized and symbolically reused to build Edward's new castle there.; The site of Harlech Castle was associated with the legend of Branwen, a Welsh princess. Reconstruction of Caernarfon Castle and town walls at the end of the 13th century Edward employed trusted architects and engineers to run the projects, most prominently the Savoyard Master James of St George, but also Edward's close friend Otto de Grandson, the soldier Sir John de Bonvillars and the master mason John Francis. The English had built castles in the wake of the 1272 conflict, usually larger and more expensive than those of the local Welsh rulers, but the new fortifications were on a still grander scale. Carpenters, ditch diggers and stonemasons were gathered by local sheriffs from across England and mustered at Chester and Bristol, before being sent on to North Wales in the spring, returning home each winter.; The number of workers involved was so great that it placed a significant strain on England's national labour force. The costs were huge: Caernarfon's castle and walls cost ¬£15,500, Conwy's castle and walls came to around ¬£15,000 and Harlech Castle cost ¬£8,190 to construct.; ; ; The walled towns were planned out in a regular fashion, drawing both on the experience of equivalent bastides in France and on various English planned settlements. Their new residents were English migrants, with the local Welsh banned from living inside the walls. The towns had varying levels of success. Measured in terms of burgages, town properties rented from the Crown by citizens, Conwy had 99 around 1295, and Caernarfon had 57 in 1298. Harlech lagged badly behind in terms of growth, and the town had only 24 and a half burgages in 1305. The castles were entrusted by Edward to constables, charged to defend them and, in some cases, also empowered to defend the town walls as well. Permanent garrisons of soldiers were established, 40 at Caernarfon, 30 at Conwy and 36 at Harlech, equipped with crossbows and armour.; The castles and towns were all ports and could be supplied by sea if necessary, an important strategic advantage as Edward's navy had near total dominance around the Welsh coastline. The castles were each equipped with a rear or postern gate that would allow them to resupplied directly by sea even if the town had fallen. Rebellion of 1294‚Äì95 Reconstruction of Harlech Castle in the early 14th century, seen from the sea Edwards's fortifications were tested in 1294 when Madog ap Llywelyn rebelled against English rule, the first major insurrection since the conquest. The Welsh appear to have risen up over the introduction of taxation, and Madog had considerable popular support. By the end of the year, Edward had returned to Wales with a large army and marched west from Chester, reaching his castle at Conwy by Christmas. Here he was trapped and besieged until January 1295, supplied only by sea, before forces arrived to relieve him in February.; Harlech was also besieged but was saved from defeat by the arrival of supplies by sea from Ireland.; Caernarfon, however, was still only partially completed and was stormed by Welsh forces and the castle and town set alight. In Anglesey, Welsh forces killed the royal sheriff. In the spring Edward pressed home his counterattack with a force of 35,000 soldiers, putting down the uprising and killing Madog. In the aftermath of the rebellion, Edward ordered work to recommence on repairing and completing Caernarfon. Once Anglesey was reoccupied he also began to progress the delayed plans to fortify the area. The chosen site was called Beaumaris and was about from the Welsh town of Llanfaes. The decision was therefore taken to move the Welsh population some south-west, where a settlement by the name of Newborough was created for them. The deportation of the local Welsh opened the way for the construction of an English town, protected by a substantial castle. A furious programme of building work commenced on the site under the direction of James of St George, the workforce sheltering in temporary huts in the centre of the half-built fortification. The project was very expensive, frequently falling into arrears, and by 1300 had cost around ¬£11,000. Despite the absence of town walls, the surrounding settlement grew quickly and by 1305 it had 132 and a quarter burgages paying rent to the Crown. By 1300 only Harlech and Conwy had been properly completed: Caernarfon's town walls were finished, but much of the castle was still incomplete and at Beaumaris Castle the inner walls was only half their intended height, with gaps in the outer walls.; ; By 1304 the total building programme in Wales had come to at least ¬£80,000, almost six times Edward's annual income.; Edward had meanwhile become embroiled in a long-running sequence of wars in Scotland which began to consume his attention and financial resources, and as a result further work on the Welsh castles slowed to a crawl.; In 1306 Edward became concerned about a possible Scottish invasion of North Wales, spurring fresh construction work, but money remained much more limited than before. By 1330 all new work had finally ceased, and Caernarfon and Beaumaris were never fully completed.; Decline The North Gate in Caernarfon's town walls Maintaining the castles proved challenging, and they rapidly fell into disrepair. The money given to the castle constables to enable them to maintain and garrison the castles had not been generous to start with, but the sums provided declined considerably during the 14th century. The constable of Conwy Castle had been provided with ¬£190 a year in 1284, but this fell away to ¬£40 a year by the 1390s; Harlech's funding fell similarly from ¬£100 a year to only ¬£20 by 1391. By 1321 a survey reported that Conwy was poorly equipped, with limited stores and suffering from leaking roofs and rotten timbers, and in the 1330s, Edward III was advised that none of the castles were in fit state to host the royal court should he visit the region. A 1343 survey showed that Beaumaris needed extensive work, with several of the towers in a ruinous conditions. Repairs and renovations were sometimes carried out. When Edward II was threatened in South Gwynedd by the Mortimer Marcher Lord family, he ordered his sheriff, Sir Gruffudd Llywd, to extend the defences leading up to the gatehouse with additional towers. Edward, the Black Prince carried out extensive work at Caernarfon after he took over control of the fortification in 1343. At the end of the 14th century, Conwy Castle was involved in the downfall of Richard II. Richard returned from Ireland in August 1399 and took shelter in the castle from the forces of his rival, Henry Bolingbroke. Henry Percy, Bolingbroke's emissary, went into the castle to conduct negotiations with the king. Henry Percy took an oath in the castle chapel to protect the king if he agreed to leave the castle, but when Richard left he was promptly taken prisoner, and was taken away to die later in captivity at Pontefract Castle. =15th‚Äì17th centuries= Glynd≈µr Rising and Wars of the Roses John Speed recorded the future World Heritage sites in a sequence of famous 1610 maps, such as this one showing the castle and the adjacent walled town of Beaumaris. Tensions between the Welsh and the English persisted and spilled over in 1400 with the outbreak of the Glynd≈µr Rising. At the start of the conflict, Harlech's garrison was badly equipped, and Conwy had fallen into disrepair.; ; Conwy Castle was taken at the start of the conflict by two Welsh brothers, who took control of the fortress in a sneak attack, enabling Welsh rebels to attack and capture the rest of the walled town. Caernarfon was besieged in 1401, and that November the Battle of Tuthill took place nearby between Caernarfon's defenders and the besieging force. In 1403 and 1404, Caernarfon was besieged again by Welsh troops with support from French forces, but withstood the attacks. Beaumaris fared less well. It was placed under siege and captured by the rebels in 1403, only being retaken by royal forces in 1405. Harlech was attacked and taken at the end of 1404, becoming Glynd≈µr's military headquarters until English forces under the command of the future Henry V retook the castle in a siege over the winter of 1408‚Äì09.; ; By 1415 the uprising had been completely crushed, but the performance of the great castles and town walls is assessed by historian Michael Prestwich to have been \\"no more than partially successful\\". Later in the century, a series of civil wars known as the Wars of the Roses broke out between the rival factions of the House of Lancaster and York. After the Battle of Northampton in 1460, Harlech formed a refuge for Queen Margaret of Anjou, and between 1461‚Äì68 it was held by her Lancastrian supporters, under the command of Dafydd ap Ieuan, against the Yorkist Edward IV. Thanks to its natural defences and the supply route by sea, Harlech held out and eventually became the last major stronghold still under Lancasterian control. It finally fell after a month's siege, the events credited with inspiring the song Men of Harlech.; The ascension of the Tudor dynasty to the English throne in 1485 marked the end of the Wars of the Roses and heralded a change in the way Wales was administered. The Tudors were Welsh in origin, and their rule eased hostilities between the Welsh and English. As a result, the Edwardian castles became less important. They were neglected, and in 1538 it was reported that many castles in Wales were \\"moche ruynous and ferre in decaye for lakke of tymely reparations\\". Harlech appears not to have been repaired following the 1468 siege, and became completely dilapidated. Conwy was restored by Henry VIII in the 1520s and 1530s, but soon fell into disrepair once again, and was sold off by the Crown in 1627. Complaints about the poor state of Beaumaris mounted, and by 1609 the castle was classed as \\"utterlie decayed\\". Caernarfon Castle's walls were intact, but buildings inside were rotten and falling down. In 1610 the cartographer John Speed produced a famous sequence of pictorial maps of the towns of North Wales, including their castles and town defences, which have become iconic images of the sites at the turn of the 17th century. English Civil War and aftermath Harlech's gatehouse, slighted by Parliament after the English Civil War The English Civil War broke out in 1642 between the Royalist supporters of Charles I and the supporters of Parliament. The fortifications in North Wales were held by supporters of the king and in some cases became strategically important as part of the communications route between royal forces operating in England and supplies and reinforcements in Ireland. The castles and towns' defences were repaired at considerable expense and brought back into service, garrisoned by local Royalists.; ; ; Parliament gained the upper hand in England, however, and by 1646 its armies were able to intervene in North Wales. Caernarfon, Beaumaris and Conwy were taken that year.; ; Harlech ‚Äì the last fortress to hold out for the king ‚Äì surrendered in March 1647, marking the end of the first phase of the civil war. In the aftermath of the war, Parliament ordered the slighting of castles across the country, deliberately destroying or damaging the structures to prevent them being used in any subsequent Royalist uprisings.. North Wales proved to be a special case, as there were concerns that Charles II might lead a Presbyterian uprising in Scotland and mount a sea-borne attack on the region. Conwy, Caernarfon and Beaumaris were initially garrisoned by Parliament to defend against such an attack. Conwy was later partially slighted in 1655, but Caernarfon and Beaumaris escaped entirely. Harlech, less of a potential Scottish target, was rendered unusable by Parliament, but was not totally demolished.; In 1660 Charles II was restored to the throne and ownership of the castles changed once again. Beaumaris was restored to the control of the Bulkeley family, traditionally the constables of the castle, who promptly stripped the castle of any remaining materials, including the roofs, and Conwy was returned to the Conway family, who stripped down the castle for lead and timber, reducing it to a ruin as well.; Charles' new government regarded Caernarfon's castle and town walls as a security risk and ordered them to be destroyed, but this order was never carried out, possibly because of the costs involved in doing so. =18th‚Äì21st centuries= Picturesque attractions J. M. W. Turner's picturesque representation of Caernarfon Castle The sites began to pass into varied private ownership. Lord Thomas Bulkeley bought Beaumaris from the Crown in 1807, incorporating it into the park that surrounded his local residence.; Conwy Castle was leased by the descendants of the Conways to the Holland family. In the late 18th and 19th centuries, the ruined castles started to be considered picturesque and sublime, attracting visitors and artists from across a wide area. The fashion was encouraged by the events of the Napoleonic Wars at the turn of the 19th century, which made it difficult for British artists to visit the continent, leading many to travel to North Wales instead. These artists included John Cotman, Henry Gastineau, Thomas Girtin, Moses Griffith, Julius Ibbetson, Paul Sandby, J. M. W. Turner and John Varley.; The sites became heavily overgrown with ivy and other vegetation. In the 1830s the stonework of Caenarfon Castle began to collapse, and the Crown employed Anthony Salvin to conduct emergency repairs. Transport infrastructure to the region began to improve throughout the 19th century, adding to the flow of visitors to the sites, including the future Queen Victoria in 1832.; Academic research into the sites, particularly Caernarfon and Conwy, began to occur in the middle of the 19th century. Local and central government interest began to increase. In 1865 Conwy Castle passed to the civic leadership of Conwy town who began restoration work on the ruins, including the reconstruction of the slighted Bakehouse tower. From the 1870s onwards, the government funded repairs to Caernarfon Castle. The deputy-constable, Llewellyn Turner, oversaw the work, controversially restoring and rebuilding the castle, rather than simply conserving the existing stonework. Despite the protests of local residents, the moat to the north of the castle was cleared of post-medieval buildings that were considered to spoil the view. State restoration Conwy Castle, flanked by three 19th- and 20th-century bridges In the early 20th century the central British state began to reacquire control of the sites. Caernarfon had never left the direct control of the Crown, but Harlech was transferred to the control of the Office of Works in 1914, Beaumaris followed in 1925 and Conwy was finally leased to the Ministry of Works in 1953.; ; The state invested heavily in conservation of the sites. The 1920s saw large-scale conservation programmes at both Beaumaris and Harlech, stripping back the vegetation, digging out the moat and repairing the stonework, but otherwise leaving the sites intact and avoiding outright restoration.; Major work was undertaken at Conwy in the 1950s and 1960s, including the clearing away of newer buildings encroaching on the 13th-century walls. Academic research increased at the turn of the 20th century, and as the Ministry of Works took control of the sites, government spending on these investigations began. Historians such as Sidney Toy and Charles Peers published work on the sites, and research continued under Arnold Taylor, who joined the Office of Works as an assistant inspector in 1935. Major academic reports were published in the 1950s, adding to the sites' reputation. Taylor was also instrumental in the successful opposition to road projects proposed in the 1970s which would have had a substantial impact on the appearance of the Conwy site. In the late 20th century, detailed reconstructions of the castles were painted by historical artists including Terry Ball, John Banbury and Ivan Lapper. In 1984 Cadw was formed as the historic environment service of the Welsh Government and took over the management of the four sites, operating them as tourist attractions. In 2007, over 530,000 visits were made to the sites. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the castles and town walls played a more prominent part in debates surrounding Welsh identity. The use of Caernarfon in the investiture of the Prince of Wales in 1911 and 1969, for example, was challenged by Welsh nationalists such as Alun Ffred Jones. Cadw expanded the interpretation provided at the sites to give more emphasis to the impact of the creation of the castles on the native Welsh, and the role of the Welsh princes in the events leading up to the 1282 invasion itself. Creation of the World Heritage site In 1986 sites were collectively declared a UNESCO World Heritage site, titled the Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd. UNESCO considered the castles and town walls to be the \\"finest examples of late 13th century and early 14th century military architecture in Europe\\". UNESCO also cited the importance of their links to Edward I and James of St George, their scale and advanced military architecture, and their unusually good condition and historical documentation. The sites require ongoing maintenance, and as an example of this it cost ¬£239,500 between 2002‚Äì03 to maintain the historical parts of the properties. \\"Buffer zones\\" have been established around the sites, aimed to protect the views and setting from inappropriate development or harm. The sites are protected by a mixture of UK Scheduled Monument, Listed Building and conservation area legislation. Architecture =Interpretation= Military architecture Beaumaris Castle seen from the air, showing its concentric defences The Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd incorporated a range of military features developed during the late 13th century. As a consequence, for much of the 20th century, historians regarded these sites as the evolutionary pinnacle of scientific military architecture. D. J. Cathcart King described them as the \\"zenith of English castle-building\\", and Sidney Toy considered them to be \\"some of the most powerful castles of any age or country\\". The sites included concentric defences, in which inner castle walls were completely enclosed within outer defences, with the height and angles calculated to allow both rings of walls to fire on external attackers, as seen at Harlech and Beaumaris.; Narrow sites such as Conwy were instead built on tall rock formations, making any attack difficult. Arrowslits and barbicans were incorporated into the defences, with multiple firing platforms built into the walls to allow the massed use of archers. These were further defended in some cases by gatehouses with characteristic twin towers, which replaced the older keeps as a stronghold for defence.; Despite these strengths, the castles and town walls are now recognised to have also had military flaws. The castles were much larger than they needed to be in order to protect against Welsh attack, but the sheer scale of them meant that the Crown could not afford to maintain or garrison them properly. The fortifications were in some regards simply too big, and as historian Michael Prestwich notes, smaller projects might actually have been more effective. Rather than the sites being scientifically designed, historian Richard Morris suggested that \\"the impression is firmly given of an elite group of men-of-war, long-standing comrades in arms of the king, indulging in an orgy of military architectural expression on an almost unlimited budget\\". cited Palatial architecture and symbolism Byzantine or Roman imagery to bolster Edward's legitimacy Architectural research in the late 20th and early 21st centuries focused less on the military aspects of the fortifications, however, and more on their roles as luxurious palaces and symbols of royal power. Each of the castles was designed to be suitable to support the royal court, should it visit. In the late 13th century, this meant having several sets of private chambers, discreet service facilities and security arrangements, producing, in effect, a royal palace in miniature. Some of these survive largely intact; Conwy, for example, has what historian Jeremy Ashbee considers to be the \\"best preserved suite of medieval private royal chambers in England and Wales\\", including a private garden for the use of the queen. When built, the castles would have been more colourful than today, in keeping with the fashions of the 13th century. At Conwy, for example, the walls were white-washed with a lime render, and the putlog holes in the walls may have been used to display painted shields called targes from the walls. The castles made a clear, imperial statement about Edward's intentions to rule North Wales on a permanent basis. As already noted, they were typically located on sites that had been associated with the former Welsh princes.;; Caernarfon, in particular, stands out for its use of banded, coloured stone in the walls, statues of eagles and its polygonal, rather than round, towers. There has been extensive academic debate over the interpretation of these features. Historian Arnold Taylor argued that the design of the castle was a representation of the Walls of Constantinople. The conscious use of imagery from the Byzantine Roman Empire was therefore an assertion of authority by Edward I. Recent work by historian Abigail Wheatley suggests that the design of Caernarfon was indeed an assertion of Edward's authority, but that it drew on imagery from Roman sites in Britain with the intent of creating an allusion of Arthurian legitimacy for the king. Savoy influence The Edwardian sites have strong architectural links to castles and town walls built in the kingdom of Savoy in North Italy during the same period. The resemblance between the two sets of buildings was first noted by historian Arnold Taylor in the 1950s. Similarities include the semi-circular door arches, window styles, corbelled towers, the positioning of putlog holes, tall circular towers and crenellations with pinnacles found in Edward's works in North Wales; in Savoy these can be seen in constructions such as the defences of Saillon, La B√¢tiaz and Chillon Castles. Many of these similarities have been considered to be the result of the influence of the Savoy architect Master James of St George, employed by Edward I, and who brought other Savoyard architects with him to North Wales. Early 21st-century research, however, suggested that Master James' role, and Savoyard influence more generally, may have been overstated. The stonework of the sites in North Wales is of much higher quality than that in North Italy, and key features ‚Äì such as the gatehouses ‚Äì are not seen in Savoyard. Research indicates that Master James also appears to have had a stronger project management function, rather than an architectural design role, in the development of the sites. Furthermore, in some cases the relevant Savoy structures were built only after James had left the region, and would never have been seen by the architect. The similarity in architectural details may, therefore, be the result of the wider role played by Savoy craftsmen and engineers on the projects, rather than that of a single individual. =The sites= Beaumaris Castle The moated north-west walls of Beaumaris' outer ward Beaumaris Castle was built at around sea-level and was constructed from local Anglesey stone.; . The castle design formed an inner and an outer ward, surrounded in turn by a moat, now partially filled. The main entrance to the castle was the \\"Gate next the Sea\\", next to the castle's tidal dock that allowed it to be supplied directly by sea. The dock was protected by a wall later named the Gunners Walk and a firing platform that may have housed a trebuchet siege engine during the medieval period. The outer ward consisted of an eight-sided curtain wall with twelve turrets; one gateway led out to the Gate next the Sea, and the other, the Llanfaes Gate, led out to the north side of the castle. The walls of the inner ward were more substantial than those of the outer ward, with huge towers and two large gatehouses. The inner ward was intended to hold the accommodation and other domestic buildings of the castle, with ranges of buildings stretching along the west and east sides of the ward; some of the remains of the fireplaces for these buildings can still be seen in the stonework. Historian Arnold Taylor described Beaumaris as Britain's \\"most perfect example of symmetrical concentric planning\\", and for many years the castle was regarded as the pinnacle of military engineering during Edward I's reign.; ; The castle is considered by UNESCO to be a \\"unique artistic achievement\\" for the way in which is combines \\"characteristic 13th century double-wall structures with a central plan\\" and for the beauty of its \\"proportions and masonry\\". Harlech Castle Harlech Castle Harlech Castle rests upon the spur of rock called the Harlech Dome; the land falls away sharply on the north and west, and a ditch cut into the rock protects the remaining approaches to the castle. The castle has a concentric design, with one line of defences enclosed by another, forming an inner and outer ward; the outer wall was originally somewhat taller than today. Harlech is built from local grey-green sandstone, with large, regular blocks used for the towers and irregular material, possibly taken from the ditch, used for the walls. The main entrance to the castle would have involved crossing a stone bridge between the two easterly ditch bridge towers and the main gatehouse; little remains of the bridge towers today and a timber entrance way to the gatehouse replaces the bridge. A water gate overlooks a protected stairway of 127 steps that runs down to the foot of the cliffs. The gatehouse has two massive \\"D-shaped\\" defensive towers flanking the entrance.; The passage into the castle was guarded by three portcullises and at least two heavy doors. The gatehouse has two upper floors, broken up into various rooms. Each floor has three large windows overlooking the inner ward; the second floor has two additional grand windows on the sides of the gatehouse. The gatehouse was fitted with fireplaces and would originally have had prominent chimneys. The inner ward is guarded by four large circular towers which at various times housed a dungeon and an artillery workshop. Several ranges of buildings were built around the inner ward, including a chapel, kitchen, service buildings, a granary and a great hall. The battlements may originally have been built with triple finials in a similar fashion to Conwy, although little remains of these in the modern era. Caernarfon Castle and town walls Caernarfon Castle is divided into an upper and lower ward. The lower ward contained royal accommodation, while the upper consisted of service facilities and the accommodation for the garrison. These are surrounded by a curtain wall, defended by polygonal towers. Defensive firing galleries were built along the southern side of the castle. There are two main entrances, the King's Gate, leading from the town, and the Queen's Gate, allowing more direct access to the castle. All that remains of the buildings contained within the castle are the foundations. If Caernarfon been completed as intended, it would have been able to contain a royal household of several hundred people. In the opinion of military historian Allen Brown, Caernarfon was \\"one of the most formidable concentrations of fire-power to be found in the Middle Ages\\". Caernarfon's town walls present an unbroken, long circuit around the town, enclosing .; Taylor, p. 41; Lilley, p. 106. They are mostly built from the same carboniferous limestone used at the castle. The eight towers along the wall are mostly \\"gap-backed\\", lacking walls on the inside of the towers, and originally included removable wooden bridges to allow sections of the walls to be sealed off from attackers. The two original entrances to the town were through the West and East Gates. The West Gate faced onto the harbour, and was also known as the Golden Gate, named after the principal gateway in the city of Constantinople. Conwy Castle and town walls Conwy Castle hugs a rocky coastal ridge of grey sandstone and limestone, and much of the stone from the castle is largely taken from the ridge itself, probably when the site was first cleared.; The castle has a rectangular plan and is divided into an inner and outer ward, with four large towers on each side.; The main entrance to the castle is through the western barbican, an exterior defence in front of the main gate. The barbican features the earliest surviving stone machicolations in Britain. A postern gate originally led down to the river where a small dock was built, allowing key visitors to enter the castle in private and for the fortress to be resupplied by boat. Conwy's outer ward was originally crowded with administrative and service buildings. The inner ward was separated from the outer by a wall, a drawbridge and a gate, protected by a ditch cut into the rock. Inside, it contained the chambers for the royal household, their immediate staff and service facilities. On the east side of the inner ward is another barbican, enclosing the castle garden. The Conwy town walls form a largely unbroken, long triangular circuit around the town, enclosing .; They are mostly built from the same local sand- and limestone used at the castle, but with additional rhyolite stone used along the upper parts of the eastern walls. When first built, the walls were possibly whitewashed.; The 21 surviving towers are mostly \\"gap-backed\\", lacking walls on the inside of the towers, and originally included removable wooden bridges to allow sections of the walls to be sealed off from attackers.; The tops of the walls feature an unusual design that uses a sequence of corbels to provide a flat, relatively wide wall-walk.; A unique set of twelve medieval latrines is built into the southern town walls, first constructed for the use of royal staff working in adjacent buildings in the 13th century.; See also *Castles in Great Britain and Ireland *List of castles in Wales *List of town walls in England and Wales *Beaumaris town walls *Archaeology of Wales References =Notes= =References= =Bibliography=            Category:Buildings and structures completed in the 13th century Category:World Heritage Sites in Wales Category:Castles in Gwynedd Category:Edward I of England ","title":"Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd"},{"id":"7695076","text":"Kirov class may refer to: * , Project 1144 Orlan missile-armed cruisers built for the Soviet Navy in 1980 and serving now in the Russian Navy; * , Project 26 cruisers that were built for the Soviet Navy in 1939‚Äì1944, served in World War II and were decommissioned by 1974.

Some guardhouses also function as jails. Modern guardhouses In 21st century commercial, industrial, institutional, governmental, or residential facilities, Guardhouses are generally placed at the entrance as checkpoints for securing, monitoring and maintaining access control into the secured facility. In the case of small to mid-sized facilities, generally, the entire physical security envelope is controlled from the Guardhouse. One of the general orders of a sentry in the United States Navy and Marine corps is to \\"Repeat all calls more distant from the guardhouse than my own.\\" Guardhouses thus serve as central communications hubs for outlying sentry posts, being where the Corporal of the Guard is stationed. When sentries are relieved by their replacements, the sentry stationed at the Guardhouse, designated \\"No. 1\\", is conventionally relieved first.

His published works are \\"Molecular Mechanics\\" (Cambridge, 1866); \\"The Love of Religious Perfection\\", originally in Italian, in the style of \\"The Imitation of Christ\\" (published in English, Dublin, 1863); articles in \\"The Catholic World\\", XVII-XXI (1873‚Äì75), the best printed account of his philosophy; two articles in the \\"Am. Cath. Q. Rev.\\", II (1877); and \\"A Discussion with an Infidel\\", being a review of B√ºchner's \\"Force and Matter\\" (New York, London, and Leamington, 1901). His elementary works on mathematics, all published in San Francisco, are \\"Algebra\\" (1890), \\"Geometry\\" (1895), \\"Analytical Geometry\\" (1887), \\"Plane and Spherical Trigonometry\\" (1886), and \\"Infinitesimal Calculus\\" (1889). Father Bayma took the Venerable Bede for his model, and often referred to the old Breviary Lesson, which used to be read in England on St. Bede's day. It ran: \\"Bede [and Bayma too] was handsome of stature, grave of gait, rich and sonorous of voice, eloquent of speech, noble of countenance, a blend of affability and severity. He was affable to the godly and devout, formidable to the proud and negligent. He was always reading, always writing, always teaching, always praying.\\" To posterity he must be known by his \\"Molecular Mechanics\\", a metaphysical and mathematical work treating of the constitution of matter. With Roger Joseph Boscovich, Bayma reduces all matter to unextended points - centres of force acting in the inverse square of the distance - thus acting upon one another, but of course not touching, for Bayma abhorred continuous matter and upheld actio in distans. These points were bound up into molecules, and molecules into bodies. Boscovich made his points, or elements, attractive at molar distances, repulsive at molecular. Bayma divides elements into attractive and repulsive, the former always attracting, the latter always repelling; the attractive elements preponderating in the nucleus of the molecule, the repulsive in the envelope. The work drew attention at Cambridge, and at Trinity College, Dublin. The author was advised to test his theories by ten years of experiments in chemistry and electricity. This did not occur in reality due to his death.

In this paradigm, participants study a list of items on each trial, and then are prompted to recall the items in any order (hence the name \\"free\\" recall). Items are usually presented one at a time for a short duration, and can be any of a number of nameable materials, although traditionally, words from a larger set are chosen. The recall period typically lasts a few minutes, and can involve spoken or written recall. The standard paradigm involves the recall period starting immediately after the final list item; this can be referred to as immediate free recall (IFR) to distinguish it from delayed free recall (DFR). In delayed free recall, a short distraction period is interpolated between the final list item and the start of the recall period. Both immediate free recall and delayed free recall have been used to test certain effects that appear during recall tests, such as the primacy effect and recency effect. Methodology used in measuring performance One of the basic measures of performance in the free recall paradigm is simply the number of words recalled from a list, which varies with a number of factors, including the list length, the type of material studied, and any task used to process the words (e.g., a simple judgement). When one examines the probability of recall by the position of the item in the list (its serial position), one finds that the initial and terminal items in the list are better remembered than those in the middle (also known as the primacy and recency items, respectively). Primacy effects generally come from the idea that greater attention is devoted to items that appear at the beginning of presentation lists. MurdockMurdock, Bennet B. (1962). \\"The serial position effect of free recall\\". Journal of Experimental Psychology 64 (5): 482‚Äì488. presents a classic study of serial position effects in free recall. In his experiment, Murdock used six groups of 103 participants. Each group was given different combinations of list lengths and presentation rates. Three of the groups were shown lists of ten, fifteen, and twenty words with a presentation rate of two seconds per word. The other three groups were shown lists of twenty, thirty, and forty words with a one-second presentation rate for each word. There were 80 lists in total that included randomly selected common English words. After the presentation of each list, subjects were asked to recall as many words as possible in any order. Results from the experiment showed that all groups expressed both primacy effects and recency effects. Recency effects were exhibited regardless of the length of the list, and it was strongest for the words in the last eight serial positions. The primacy effect extended over the first four serial positions. Another evidence of the recency effect is found in the way that participants initiate recall of a list: they most often start with terminal (recent) list items (an early description of the recency effect in the probability of first recall can be found in Hogan, 1975). Recency effects come from the notion that terminal list items tend to be better recalled than other items. This particular effect has generated much controversy and experimentation due to the speculation about why items that are rehearsed less should be so well remembered. A standard explanation for these effects is that they represent output from primary memory, or the short- term memory buffer system.Greene, Robert L. (1986). \\"Sources of recency effects in free recall\\". Psychological Bulletin 99 (2): 221‚Äì28. Recency effects show how well subjects can remember the last items relative to how well they remember the other items. Glenberg's theory can be used to determine the magnitude of the recency effect, depending on how effective the retrieval cues are for the last item relative to the other items. Several types of experiments can be done to test the recency effect for free recall. One experiment that is commonly used is the distractor-recall paradigm, as done by Rundus (1980). Another study that exhibits the recency effect during free recall is when subjects learn several different lists followed by recall tests, and then a final unexpected recall test at the end of the experiment where they are required to recall as many items as possible from all of the lists. Results show that participants tend to recall items from the more recent lists. Serial recall paradigm Studies have also been done to address the best method for recalling lists of unrelated words. In contrast to free recall, another type of study is known as the serial recall paradigm, where participants are asked to recall the presented items in their correct order rather than the order that comes to mind at the time of testing, randomly. Experiments have shown that in comparison to free recall, the serial recall learning curve increases linearly with the number of trials. The purpose of a study by Bruner, Miller, and Zimmerman (1955) was to determine if this learning difference is a result of the order in which the participant sees the items, or if it is instead dependent on the order in which the participant is told to recall the items. The study involved three different conditions: serial recall, free recall with items to be recalled randomized before each trial, and free recall with the order of the items kept constant. The experiment tested nine college students on 18 series of words. In addition to the linear serial recall learning curve, it was found that more words are forgotten when recall is free than when it is serial. This study also supported the notion that the difference between the types of recall depends on the order in which the learner must recall the items, and not on the order in which the items are presented.Waugh, Nancy C. (1961). \\"Free versus serial recall\\". Journal of Experimental Psychology 62 (5): 496‚Äì502. Beyond examining the relative probability of particular items being recalled, one can examine the order in which items are retrieved during the recall period. When a participant successfully recalls an item from a set of studied items, there is a marked tendency for the next item recalled to come from neighboring positions in the study set, with an advantage for items that followed the recalled item over items that preceded it. This effect, known as the contiguity effect, was first characterized by Michael J. Kahana Kahana, Michael J. (1996). \\"Associative retrieval processes in free recall\\". Memory & Cognition 24: 103‚Äì9., and has been shown to be robust across many free recall experiments.Healey, M. K., Long, N. M., & Kahana, M. J. (2019). Contiguity in episodic memory. Psychonomic bulletin & review, 26(3), 699-720. Subjective organization Classic studies of free recall often focused on the multi-trial free recall paradigm, in which the same set of items appear on successive trials (although usually the order of the items is scrambled across trials). In this version of the paradigm, researchers would focus on how many trials it took to learn a certain proportion of the items. Tulving (1968) describes the phenomenon of subjective organization, in which words that are recalled successively during the first recall period also tend to be recalled successively during later recall periods. In addition to subjective organization, these multi-trial free recall paradigms are also used to analyze the effects of practice on recall tasks. Improvement in recall of items over multiple trials has been termed the learning-to-learn effect (LTL). To explore the results of practice on item recall, two experiments have been done to compare effects on free recall and ordered recall. The first experiment consisted of multiple presentations of words, and required the subjects to recall the lists by either ordered or free recall. The second experiment had multiple trials, where each trial consisted of the presentation of words followed by a recall test. Participants were given five trials for each of the lists. Results of the experiments showed that in order to produce the learning-to-learn effect in free recall, participants should be given multiple trials rather than multiple presentations.Dallet, Kent M. (1963). \\"Practice effects in free and ordered recall\\". Journal of Experimental Psychology 66 (1): 65‚Äì71 Understanding of neurological processes Free recall studies have given yield to new understanding of neurological processes. In particular, the Dynamic Tagging Theory makes use of statistical data taken from such experiments in formulating a phenomenological explanation of short- term memory. George A. Miller wrote a widely known paper describing the limitations of memory and the power of categories to improve recall, especially in short-term memory. He popularized the short term memory limitation by calling it \\"The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two\\".

It is a major constituent of the plant Ammi visnaga, also known as Bishop's Weed. Once purified, khellin exists as colorless, odorless, bitter-tasting needle-shaped crystals and is classified as a gamma- pyrone, a furanochromone derivative. In the early 20th century, researchers searched for khellin analogs with lower toxicity and better efficacy. A number of drugs were discovered through this research, such as amiodarone and cromolyn sodium, which are used in current medical practice. Efloxate is also mentioned as analog. Background Khellin is found in Egypt, the Middle East, and areas surrounding the Mediterranean. It is a major constituent of the plant Ammi Visnaga, existing between 0.3 and 1.2% in the leaves and seeds. Bishop's Weed is a name given to several species of plants; however, only Ammi Visnaga contains khellin. Khellin is rarely found in its pure form; instead it is found in Ammi Visnaga or \\"Khella\\" extract. As a result, many healing properties have been attributed to Khellin that are actually due to other constituents in the extract. Ammi Visnaga preparations are commercially available and very common; however, the amount of Khellin and other ingredients varies greatly between brands and even batches of the same brand. The extract is commonly found as a tea or in a pill form. Medical use Therapeutic use is often not recommended, as the risks often outweigh the benefits. Regardless of this recommendation, Ammi Visnaga is still often used in the Middle East, Egypt, and surrounding areas. Unwanted side effects include dizziness, reversible cholestatic jaundice, pseudoallergic reaction, and elevated levels of liver enzymes (transaminases and gamma- glutamyltransferase). =Vitiligo= Vitiligo is a disease which causes loss of pigmentation in portions of skin. When khellin is applied topically in combination with UVA light, it is able to stimulate melanocytes (cells that produce melanin) in hair follicles for successful treatment of vitiligo. One such method is blister roof transplantation; in which, blisters are formed on an unaffected area and are then grafted onto a vitiligo affected area. When khellin is applied topically and treated with UV light, pigmentation returns to treated areas. When taken systemically, khellin induces elevated liver enzyme levels and broad photosensitivity; however, topical application reduces these side effects. Psoralens are commonly used for vitiligo treatment, but have higher phototoxic and DNA mutagenic effects. While Khellin treatment in conjunction with UV therapy is successful, accelerated photoaging and increased risk of skin cancer is another concern. =Kidney stones= When ammi visnaga extract is taken daily, as a tea or as a pill, calcium oxalate kidney stone formation is inhibited, making it a good treatment for hyperoxaluria (a condition in which there is excessive oxalate excretion in the urine, causing kidney stones). Khellin was thought to slow or prevent calcium oxalate nucleation, preventing stones from forming. However, studies have shown that khellin is not the active ingredient in Ammi Visnaga extract. Upon studying calcium oxalate nucleation, ammi visnaga extract as a whole was shown to prolong nucleation time as well as change stone conformation, while khellin alone had no effect. Khellin has also been used to treat renal colic, which is due mostly to schistosomiasis infections and stone formation. The plant mixture had diuretic properties that were seen to relieve renal colic by relaxing the ureter and acting as a diuretic. =Other= Intramuscular injections of khellin can also be used to treat asthma. Khellin acts as a bronchodilator; however, the common side effects including nausea present difficulties. Khellin has been used to relieve the pain associated with angina pectoris by acting as a selective coronary vasodilator. This can be done either orally or intramuscularly; however nausea is a major side effect regardless of how the medication is taken.

Much of the building is late 10th or early 11th century, making it the most significant surviving Anglo-Saxon building in the county. It is located near the centre of Roman Verulamium to the west of the modern city. History and architecture According to the 13th-century chronicler Matthew Paris, in AD 948 Abbot Wulsin (or Ulsinus) of St Alban's Abbey founded a church on each of the three main roads into the town of St Albans, namely St Michael's, St Peter's and St Stephen's, to serve pilgrims coming to venerate the Abbey's shrine of Saint Alban. In fact Wulsin may have been Abbot in about 860‚Äì880, and the earliest parts of the present building are at least a century later. Nevertheless, the church is certainly from the late Anglo-Saxon era and there may have been an earlier building on the present site. In the late 10th or early 11th century a stone church was built on a simple plan consisting of a chancel and nave. The building includes much Roman material salvaged from the surrounding ruins of Verulamium, including Roman brick used in the splays of the nave windows. Early in the 12th century a north aisle and then a south aisle were added, linked with the nave by arcades of plain round-headed arches cut in the latter's north and south walls, leaving sections of Saxon wall as piers. The arcades do not match: the earlier north arcade has three bays spaced irregularly; the later south arcade was built with four bays. The round-headed Norman window at the east end of the north aisle may also be 12th-century. In the 13th century a clerestory with six Early English lancet windows on each side was added to the nave to increase the amount of natural light, much of which had been lost when the aisles were added. Another Early English lancet window from this period survives in the north wall of the chancel. The south aisle proved to be unstable and was underbuilt in an attempt to stabilise it. At a later date, it is not known in which century, the south aisle was demolished. Slightly later in the 13th century the south chapel was added, and the easternmost arch of the south aisle became the entrance to the chapel. Three of the chapel's windows are round-headed 13th-century late Norman ones: two in the east wall and one in the south wall. The chapel is taller than the nave, so that on the south side of the clerestory the more easterly windows now look into the chapel instead of outside. The 13th century may also be the period when the church was given a west tower. In about 1340 the chancel and north aisle were rebuilt and the chancel arch was enlarged. The Decorated east window, an ogee- headed south window and matching tomb recess in the chancel, and one of the windows in the north aisle, all date from this time. In the 15th century three of the single lancets on the north side of the clerestory were replaced with two-light square-headed windows, two large windows were inserted in the south wall of the south chapel and one in the south wall of the chancel. Also 15th century are the piscinas in the chancel and south chapel, and the octagonal font. The 13th-century clerestory was given a new roof on stone corbels late in the 15th century. Also in the 15th century, a wooden tympanum was inserted in the 14th-century chancel arch and a Doom was painted on it, spreading over the upper part of the east wall of the nave. A rood screen was added to the chancel arch in the same period. It has since been removed, but stone stairs to it survive on the south side of the arch next to the south chapel. The tower is believed to have been remodelled in the late 15th or early 16th century. In its final form it had paired bell-openings, an embattled parapet and a polygonal stair-turret that was taller than the tower. A late Perpendicular west window of three lights was inserted in the west wall of the nave, probably early in the 16th century. In 1539 St Alban's Abbey was suppressed in the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The Abbey had the right to hold three fairs in St Albans, one of which was on the Nativity of St John the Baptist on 24 June. After the Dissolution, this fair was discontinued and replaced with one at Michaelmas on 29 September, possibly in reference to St Michael's church. St Michael's present wooden pulpit, tester and altar table are late 16th or early 17th century. Early in the 17th century the east wall of the south chapel may have been rebuilt. Between its two lancet windows is a circular one that may date from this time. The present roof of the south chapel may also be 17th century. Monument to Francis Bacon (died 1626) in the chancel St Michael's most significant 17th-century feature is the monument to Francis Bacon, Viscount St Alban, who died in 1626. It is in a round-arched recess inserted for the purpose in the north wall of the chancel. The monument is a life-sized sculpture of Bacon seated in a relaxed pose in an armchair. The name of the sculptor is unknown, but it may have been Nicholas Stone. A copy of this statue, sculpted by Henry Weekes,Trinity College Chapel - statues. Retrieved 27 May 2016. was commissioned by William Whewell (Master of Trinity College, Cambridge between 1841 and 1866) and erected in the college chapel in 1845 to honour one of the college's most illustrious alumni. A west gallery was inserted in the nave, apparently late in the 17th century. Box pews were also added: it is not known when, but they were installed in numerous parish churches in the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1866 the church was restored under the direction of George Gilbert Scott. He had the box pews and west gallery removed and added the Gothic Revival south porch, which uses one of the 12th-century arches of the former south aisle. In 1896 or 1898 Edmund Beckett (1st Baron Grimthorpe) had the west end of the church remodelled to his own designs and at his own expense. He had the west tower demolished, which is how evidence of the old tower's possible 13th-century origins were discovered under its late Perpendicular external fabric. He replaced it with a northwest tower in a \\"fanciful\\" Gothic Revival interpretation of Early English Gothic. Beckett had the nave extended slightly westwards, demolishing its old west wall and late Perpendicular west window. He also had a vestry added on the site of the south aisle. In one of the Victorian-era restorations the 15th-century tympanum was taken down and the rest of the Doom painting was obliterated. The architect John C. Rogers directed further restoration work in 1934‚Äì35 and designed a second vestry that was added on the north side of the chancel in 1938. Rogers also wrote a book, The Parish Church of St. Michael, St. Albans ‚Äì a Short Illustrated History, which was published in 1965, reprinted in 1973 and revised in 1982. Monuments As well as the sculpture of Francis Bacon (see above), St Michael's has some notable monumental brasses. In the south chapel is a 14th- century brass to John Pecock and his wife. There is a brass from 1380 that originally depicted a civilian and his wife with a floriated cross between them. The figure of the wife has been lost and only part of the cross survives. A brass at the east end of the nave shows a knight in armour of about 1400. There is also a brass inscription in memory of Henry Gape (died 1558) and his wife. Bells St Michael's tower has a ring of eight bells. Samuel Knight, who had foundries at Reading and London, cast the third, fourth, fifth and sixth bells in 1739. John Taylor & Co of Loughborough cast the seventh and tenor bells for Beckett's new northwest tower in 1897, which was also the year of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. Gillett & Johnston of Croydon cast the treble and second bells in 1953, the year of Elizabeth II's coronation. The name of the nearest pub, The Six Bells, is therefore an historical anachronism. Organ In 1872, Henry Jones built a pipe organ for St Michael‚Äôs Church. In 1950, Mander Organs under N. P. Mander built a new organ for St Michael's. In 1981 this was replaced with a new organ built by Peter Collins,National Pipe Organ Register N07958. Retrieved 19 August 2014. though some pipes from the previous organ were retained and revoiced. A pair of oak organ cases from the 1950 organ were retained: they flank Grimthorpe's west window. The current organ is in good condition and is used regularly.

It is located on the hilltop called O S√≠tio, overlooking Nazar√©, in Portugal, and was founded in the 14th century.  Legend  According to the Legend of Nazar√© the sheriff (alcaide) of Porto de M√≥s, Dom Fuas Roupinho, maybe a templar, was chasing on horseback a deer up a hilltop on a misty September morning in 1182 (later it was said that it was the devil, in the disguise of a deer). When the deer jumped over the edge of the hilltop into the void, his fiery horse was about to follow. Then the knight invoked the intervention of the Madonna, who made the horse turn away through a supernatural effort and saved the life of the knight. Subsequently, a chapel A Ermida da Memoria, was built very near this spot, over a grotto where stood a small statue of a Black Madonna, brought from Nazareth. Near the chapel one can see the imprint of the horseshoe in the rock.  Overview  = Construction = The church was founded in the 14th century on the occasion of the arrival of King Ferdinand on a pilgrimage to Our Lady of Nazar√©. The King not only ordered to do works in the Ermida da Memoria, but also decided to construct a new and improved place of cult, since the Hermitage did not have capacity to receive higher number of devotees of the Lady. There were done some royal modifications on the temple, as Dom Jo√£o I ordered some wooden porches. Dom Jo√£o II remodeled the temple plan with enlarging it and building a new main chapel. King Manuel I replaced the wooden porches with some that remain up to the present day. The Church underwent various reformulations, especially in the main chapel. In the reign of Philip II, the portico was renovated and a new staircase was built. At the request of the Administrative Board, King Afonso VI ordered to do some renovation in Sanctuary. Changes were made in the structure of the temple, as the arch of the main chapel was enlarged and a new transept was added. The work was finished in 1691 and a Latin cross, similar to the current one was set in the church. In 1717 temple's front was renovated, and a new access to the belfry was constructed, which has two towers now. When the transept was built, the rector Father Ant√≥nio Caria commissioned a Dutch company to add tile panels for the decoration of this new space. Before the end of 1708 Father Caria received the drawings and plans of the tiles for approval by the Administrative Board of the Royal House. In October 1709, the 6,568 tiles by Dutch ceramist Williem Van der Kl√∂et, with biblical episodes of Joseph and David and two scenes from Jonah's story, arrived at Sitio. = Interior design = The single nave in the shape of Latin cross is covered with a wooden painted ceiling. There is a painting on canvas at the entrance of the nave on the left, illustrating the legend of the appearance of Our Lady of Nazareth to D. Fuas Roupinho. The high altar is made of gold-toned altarpiece with marbled and Solomonic columns of the late 17th century. There is a small window on the Throne illustrating image of Nursing Madonna with the Child on her lap. The figures are crowned by diadems of 18th century, presented to the church by D. Jo√£o VI. The sacred image is wrapped with a green cloak decorated with gold gifted to the Virgin by D.Jo√£o V. The figures are crowned by diadems of 18th century, presented to the church by D. Jo√£o VI. The sacred image is wrapped with a green cloak decorated with gold gifted by King John V to the Virgin. The main chapel is separated from the body of the church with an arcade made from pau-santo and a few pillars decorated with mosaic Italian marble of 19th century. The corridors of the Sacristy were covered with blue and white tiles by the Portuguese master Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Bernardes in 1714. One of the panels illustrates the \\"Assumption of the Virgin\\", with symbols of Marian iconography. The remaining tiles in the corridors of the Sacristy were decorated by the master Manuel Borges. Semicircular steps lead to a Baroque portal under two square bell towers. The facade has gallery-like extensions. The profusely decorated gilded apse shows the small statue of Nossa Senhora da Nazar√© in a lit niche above the main altar, flanked by twisted columns. Above the crossing of the single nave with the transept is a cupola and a lantern. They are all vaulted by a gilt coffer ceiling.  Religious festival  On 8 September of each year a romaria (religious festival) draws many tourists and pilgrims with the processions, bullfights and folk dancing.

The party was created in 1903 to counter what was perceived to be the evils of imperialism and to instill a pan-Canadian nationalist spirit in the Francophone population. The League opposed political dependence on either Britain or the United States, supporting instead Canadian autonomy within the British Empire. In the 1908 Quebec election the Ligue won three seats in the Quebec Legislative Assembly; Bourassa won in two seats (Montreal Division #2 and Saint-Hyacinthe) and chose to sit for the latter, and Armand Lavergne was elected in Montmagny.

Originally named Cantonment Jesup, the fort operated from 1822 until 1846. After the abandonment of the fort in 1846, the United States federal government continued to own the abandoned fort site until the privatization of the site in 1869.Frontier Army Road Terminus Bills and Resolutions, House of Representatives, 41st Congress, 1st Session, Read twice, referred to the Committee on the Public Lands, and ordered to be printed. Mr. Julian, on leave, introduced the following bill: A Bill Declaring the lands constituting the Fort Jessup military reservation in the State of Louisiana subject to homestead entry and settlement. History The Neutral Strip was created after the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, from which arose a disagreement about the location of the border between the American and Spanish territories. In order to avoid a war, the two countries agreed that the land in contention would remain neutral and free of armed forces from either side. This region stretched from Sabine River to Arroyo Hondo and encompassed the land that now makes up modern Sabine Parish, Louisiana. The Neutral Strip remained devoid of government and law enforcement until the Adams‚ÄìOn√≠s Treaty of 1819 finally set the border at the Sabine River. =Zachary Taylor= Colonel (later General) Zachary Taylor‚Äîfuture President of the United States‚Äîestablished Cantonment Jesup in 1822 after Fort Seldon, a temporary headquarters for General Edmund Pendleton Gaines, was too far from the conflict zone of the Sabine River. Taylor quickly subdued the former Neutral Strip, gaining experience and popularity. The surgeon at the cantonment recorded meteorological observations. His forces, known as the Army of Observation, remained in the fort and monitored the Texas territory as it passed from Spanish to Mexican control, and finally broke away as an independent republic. In 1845, General Taylor commanded the US Army of Observation's excursion into Texas and ignited the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. He would eventually gain popularity from his victories that would propel his political career to the Presidency of the United States of America. =Closure= The United States won the war and gained control of Texas, rendering Fort Jesup unnecessary. Officially evacuated in 1846, the fort thereafter deteriorated. The federal government privatized it in 1869. =State Park= By the 1930s, the only remaining building at Fort Jesup was the kitchen of Enlisted Barracks 4. Residents of the nearby town of Many, Louisiana raised money to restore the building and turned the area into a park. The site was acquired by the Louisiana Office of State Parks in 1956, and in 1961, the fort was designated a National Historic Landmark. and Since then, the kitchen has been restored and decorated with historically accurate furniture. An officer's quarters building has been reconstructed, and now serves as a museum.Fort Jesup--Cane River National Heritage Area: A National Register of Historic Places Travel Itinerary - National Park Service The fort site is located on Louisiana Highway 6, seven miles (11 km) northeast of Many.

Air twist cordial glass c. 1750 A cordial is any invigorating and stimulating preparation that is intended for a medicinal purpose. The term derives from an obsolete usage. Various concoctions were formerly created that were believed to be beneficial to one's health, especially for the heart (cor in Latin). Some cordials, with their flecks of gold leaf and bright yellow hue, took their name from the \\"cordial vertues\\" of the rays of the sun, which some alchemists thought they contained. History Most cordials were of European origin, first produced in Italian apothecaries during the Renaissance, where the art of distilling was refined during the 15th and 16th centuries. It is from this origin that cordials are frequently referred to in French as Liqueurs d'ltalie, it is also from this that we have liqueurs. From the Renaissance onwards, cordials were usually based on alcohol in which certain herbs, spices or other ingredients were allowed to steep. The first cordials arrived in England in the late 15th century and were called distilled cordial waters. These were strictly used as alcoholic medicines, prescribed in small doses to invigorate and revitalise the heart, body and spirit as well as cure diseases. By the 18th century cordials were being imbibed for their intoxicating effects and medicinal virtues, and were fast becoming recreational drinks, eventually evolving into liqueurs. Though cordials originated on the continent, a number of British \\"sweet drams\\" achieved popularity in Europe. Uses Cordials were used to renew the natural heat, recreate and revive the spirits, and free the whole body from the malignity of diseases. Many cordials were also considered aphrodisiacs, a view which encouraged their consumption in a social as opposed to a medical context. Other early varieties of alcoholic cordials were flavoured with spices and herbal ingredients which were thought to settle the stomach after excessive eating. These cordials were called Surfeit Waters, which were specifically created for treating overindulgence. Precious ingredients like gold, pearls and coral were sometimes added. These were believed to revive the spirit and to preclude disease. In fiction Lucy Pevensie, a pivotal character in C. S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia, was, as Queen Lucy in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, gifted a bottle of magical cordial by Father Christmas along with her dagger, prior to the Battle of Berunia. The cordial was said to be made from the juice of Fire-Flowers that grew in the mountains of the sun, with a single drop curing almost any illness or injury, bringing people back from the brink of death in some cases. The use of the word \\"cordial\\" by the author was archaic even at the time. Popular cordials * Rosa Solis or Rosolio, probably originating in Renaissance Turin was derived from the carnivorous sundew plant. It was believed to not only invigorate the heart, but to be an aphrodisiac as well; according to the 17th century medical writer William Salmon, sundew \\"stirs up lust\\". * Royal Usquebaugh was a spicy concoction containing flecks of gold leaf thought to capture the sun's golden radiance. It was usually flavoured with aniseed, liquorice and saffron and sweetened with fruit sugar extracted from figs and raisins by maceration. The name derives from the Irish uisce beatha, which is literally the Gaelic translation of Latin aqua vitae, 'the water of life'). The word whisky is also derived from the Irish uisce beatha, but this was not the same as the cordial consumed in 17th and 18th century England and France, and bore no resemblance to the spirit we now call whisky. *Escubac d'Angleterre, a more down-market relative of Royal Usquebaugh without the flecks of gold leaf, but was nevertheless a popular drink. * Vespetr√≤, another popular liqueur of Italy (speciality of the town of Canzo), flavoured with anise, angelica and lemon.

Horn was born in Sittard, where he was a friend of entertainer Toon Hermans. The family moved to Amsterdam in 1928. Horn became a clerk with the textile firm Lehmann & Co, and became an amateur referee, after his playing career was ended by a knee injury. Second World War Horn came to prominence as a referee after the Second World War. During the War Horn fought with the Dutch Resistance and had been awarded a black belt in judo. Horn was suspended from refereeing by a Royal Dutch Football Association on orders of the annexed Dutch Government on account of being Jewish, in 1941. His brother, Edgar Horn, was murdered in a concentration camp. Major matches Horn was placed in charge of the famous 1953 England‚ÄìHungary match at Wembley Stadium and is one of only four men to have refereed two European Champions' Cup finals, beginning with the 1957 final in the competition's second year. In the 1962 final against Benfica, Real Madrid player Ferenc Pusk√°s was seen to throw something into the crowd. Ken Jones, an English journalist, later asked Horn why he had not cautioned Pusk√°s. Horn replied: \\"What you don't know is that I threw my whistle at Pusk√°s,\\" Horn said. \\"It hit him in the ear.\\" (It was the whistle that Pusk√°s had thrown into the crowd). The next September Horn refereed the playoff of the 1962 Copa Libertadores Finals after the original two-legged tie ended in a draw. Toward the end of his career Horn was appointed to referee the Leeds United v Valencia match in the Inter Cities Fairs Cup on 2 February 1966. Jack Charlton, after being struck by a Valencian player, struck out and a free-for-all ensued, only to be broken up by the police. Horn lead both sides off the pitch, expelling Charlton and Vidagany in the tunnel. Of this game, Jack Charlton said: \\"One of the greatest storms in European football burst about the heads of Leeds United when they played Valencia. I was in the centre of the row ‚Äì three players, including myself, were ordered off; both teams were also summoned from the field for a spell to allow heated tempers to cool\\" Horn claimed: 'Money was the cause of the trouble. You could almost smell it on the pitch.' Don Revie, said: 'If this is European football I think we are better out of it'.\\" He refereed his last match Ajax v Bulgaria on 31 August 1966. Personal life Horn became a firm friend of Abraham Klein later in life. He died in Amstelveen, the Netherlands, aged 79.

The partitioning was planned in several agreements made by the Allied Powers early in the course of World War I,Paul C. Helmeich, From Paris to S√®vres: The Partition of the Ottoman Empire at the Peace Conference of 1919‚Äì1920 (Ohio University Press, 1974) notably the Sykes-Picot Agreement, after the Ottoman Empire had joined the Ottoman‚ÄìGerman Alliance.Fromkin, A Peace to End All Peace (1989), pp. 49‚Äì50. The huge conglomeration of territories and peoples that formerly comprised the Ottoman Empire was divided into several new states.Roderic H. Davison; Review \\"From Paris to S√®vres: The Partition of the Ottoman Empire at the Peace Conference of 1919‚Äì1920\\" by Paul C. Helmreich in Slavic Review, Vol. 34, No. 1 (Mar. 1975), pp. 186‚Äì187 The Ottoman Empire had been the leading Islamic state in geopolitical, cultural and ideological terms. The partitioning of the Ottoman Empire after the war led to the domination of the Middle East by Western powers such as Britain and France, and saw the creation of the modern Arab world and the Republic of Turkey. Resistance to the influence of these powers came from the Turkish National Movement but did not become widespread in the other post-Ottoman states until the period of rapid decolonisation after World War II. The sometimes-violent creation of protectorates in Iraq and Palestine, and the proposed division of Syria along communal lines, is thought to have been a part of the larger strategy of ensuring tension in the Middle East, thus necessitating the role of Western colonial powers (at that time Britain, France and Italy) as peace brokers and arms suppliers. American think tanks refer to this strategy as \\"Syriana\\" or Pax Syriana The League of Nations mandate granted the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon, the British Mandate for Mesopotamia (later Iraq) and the British Mandate for Palestine, later divided into Mandatory Palestine and the Emirate of Transjordan (1921‚Äì1946). The Ottoman Empire's possessions in the Arabian Peninsula became the Kingdom of Hejaz, which the Sultanate of Nejd (today Saudi Arabia) was allowed to annex, and the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen. The Empire's possessions on the western shores of the Persian Gulf were variously annexed by Saudi Arabia (al-Ahsa and Qatif), or remained British protectorates (Kuwait, Bahrain, and Qatar) and became the Arab States of the Persian Gulf. After the Ottoman government collapsed completely, its representatives signed the Treaty of S√®vres in 1920, which would have partitioned almost all of the territory of present-day Turkey among France, the United Kingdom, Greece and Italy. The Turkish War of Independence forced the Western European powers to return to the negotiating table before the treaty could be ratified. The Western Europeans and the Grand National Assembly of Turkey signed and ratified the new Treaty of Lausanne in 1923, superseding the Treaty of S√®vres and agreeing on most of the territorial issues. One unresolved issue, the dispute between the Kingdom of Iraq and the Republic of Turkey over the former province of Mosul, was later negotiated under the auspices of the League of Nations in 1926. The British and French partitioned Greater Syria between them in the Sykes‚ÄìPicot Agreement. Other secret agreements were concluded with Italy and Russia.P. Helmreich, From Paris to S√®vres (Ohio State University Press, 1974) The Balfour Declaration encouraged the international Zionist movement to push for a Jewish homeland in Palestine. While a part of the Triple Entente, Russia also had wartime agreements preventing it from participating in the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire after the Russian Revolution. The Treaty of S√®vres formally acknowledged the new League of Nations mandates in the region, the independence of Yemen, and British sovereignty over Cyprus.  Background  The Western powers had long believed that they would eventually become dominant in the area claimed by the weak central government of the Ottoman Empire. Britain anticipated a need to secure the area because of its strategic position on the route to Colonial India, and perceived itself as locked in a struggle with Russia for imperial influence known as The Great Game.Fromkin, A Peace to End All Peace (1989), pp. 26‚Äì28. These powers disagreed over their contradictory post-war aims and made several dual and triple agreements.Herbert Henry Asquith (1923). The Genesis of the War. p. 82  French Mandates  Syria and Lebanon became a French protectorate (thinly disguised as a League of Nations Mandate).Fromkin, A Peace to End All Peace (1989), pp. 436‚Äì437. French control was met immediately with armed resistance, and, in order to combat Arab nationalism, France divided the Mandate area into Lebanon and four sub-states.Quilliam, Syria and the New World Order (1999), p. 33. \\"In order to inhibit Arab nationalism from developing potency and challenging their administration, the French authorities operated an imperial policy of divide and rule. The dismemberment of 'Historical Syria' into artificial statelets signified a policy that sought to thwart the appeal of Arab nationalism. As the region is full of ethnic, religious, and linguistic minorities, the dismemberment followed a logical pattern that generated structural problems for the future. Mount Lebanon was detached from Syria with the surrounding Muslim environs of Sidon, Tripoli, and Beqa'. The remaining territory was subdivided into four mini-states: Aleppo, Damascus, Latakia, and Jabal al-Druze, thus disrupting the coherence of Arab nationalism within Bilad al-Sham.\\" = Mandate of Syria = = Mandate of Lebanon = Greater Lebanon was the name of a territory created by France. It was the precursor of modern Lebanon. It existed between 1 September 1920 and 23 May 1926. France carved its territory from the Levantine land mass (mandated by the League of Nations) in order to create a \\"safe haven\\" for the Maronite Christian population. Maronites gained self-rule and secured their position in the independent Lebanon in 1943. French intervention on behalf of the Maronites had begun with the capitulations of the Ottoman Empire, agreements made during the 16th to the 19th centuries. In 1866, when Youssef Bey Karam led a Maronite uprising in Mount Lebanon, a French-led naval force arrived to help, making threats against the governor, Dawood Pasha, at the Sultan's Porte and later removing Karam to safety.  British Mandates  The British were awarded three mandated territories, with one of Sharif Hussein's sons, Faisal, installed as King of Iraq and Transjordan providing a throne for another of Hussein's sons, Abdullah. Mandatory Palestine was placed under direct British administration, and the Jewish population was allowed to increase, initially under British protection. Most of the Arabian peninsula fell to another British ally, Ibn Saud, who created the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932. = Mandate for Mesopotamia = Mosul was allocated to France under the 1916 Sykes-Picot Agreement and was subsequently given to Britain under the 1918 Clemenceau‚ÄìLloyd George Agreement. Great Britain and Turkey disputed control of the former Ottoman province of Mosul in the 1920s. Under the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne Mosul fell under the British Mandate of Mesopotamia, but the new Turkish republic claimed the province as part of its historic heartland. A three-person League of Nations committee went to the region in 1924 to study the case and in 1925 recommended the region remain connected to Iraq, and that the UK should hold the mandate for another 25 years, to assure the autonomous rights of the Kurdish population. Turkey rejected this decision. Nonetheless, Britain, Iraq and Turkey made a treaty on 5 June 1926, that mostly followed the decision of the League Council. Mosul stayed under British Mandate of Mesopotamia until Iraq was granted independence in 1932 by the urging of King Faisal, though the British retained military bases and transit rights for their forces in the country. = Mandate for Palestine = Battle of Jerusalem During the Great War, Britain produced three contrasting, but feasibly compatible, statements regarding their ambitions for Palestine. Britain had supported, through British intelligence officer T. E. Lawrence (aka: Lawrence of Arabia), the establishment of a united Arab state covering a large area of the Arab Middle East in exchange for Arab support of the British during the war. The Balfour Declaration of 1917 encouraged Jewish ambitions for a national home. Lastly, the British promised via the Hussein‚ÄìMcMahon Correspondence that the Hashemite family would have lordship over most land in the region in return for their support in the Great Arab Revolt. The Arab Revolt, which was in part orchestrated by Lawrence, resulted in British forces under General Edmund Allenby defeating the Ottoman forces in 1917 in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign and occupying Palestine and Syria. The land was administered by the British for the remainder of the war. The United Kingdom was granted control of Palestine by the Versailles Peace Conference which established the League of Nations in 1919. Herbert Samuel, a former Postmaster General in the British cabinet who was instrumental in drafting the Balfour Declaration, was appointed the first High Commissioner in Palestine. In 1920 at the San Remo conference, in Italy, the League of Nations mandate over Palestine was assigned to Britain. In 1923 Britain transferred a part of the Golan Heights to the French Mandate of Syria, in exchange for the Metula region. Independence movements When the Ottomans departed, the Arabs proclaimed an independent state in Damascus, but were too weak, militarily and economically, to resist the European powers for long, and Britain and France soon re-established control. During the 1920s and 1930s Iraq, Syria and Egypt moved towards independence, although the British and French did not formally depart the region until after World War II. But in Palestine, the conflicting forces of Arab nationalism and Zionism created a situation which the British could neither resolve nor extricate themselves from. The rise to power of Nazism in Germany created a new urgency in the Zionist quest to create a Jewish state in Palestine, leading to the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. =Arabian Peninsula= On the Arabian Peninsula, the Arabs were able to establish a number of independent states. In 1916 Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca, established the Kingdom of Hejaz, while the Emirate of Riyadh was transformed into the Sultanate of Nejd. In 1926 the Kingdom of Nejd and Hejaz was formed, which in 1932 became the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen became independent in 1918, while the Arab States of the Persian Gulf became de facto British protectorates, with some internal autonomy. = Anatolia = The Russians, British, Italians, French, Greeks, Assyrians and Armenians all made claims to Anatolia, based on a collection of wartime promises, military actions, secret agreements, and treaties. According to the Treaty of S√®vres, all but the Assyrians would have had their wishes honored. Armenia was to be given a significant portion of the east, known as Wilsonian Armenia, extending as far down as the Lake Van area and as far west as Mush, Greece was to be given Smyrna and the area around it (and likely would have gained Constantinople and all of Thrace, which was administered as internationally controlled and demilitarized territory), Italy was to be given control over the south-central and western coast of Anatolia around Antalya, France to be given the area of Cilicia, and Britain to be given all the area south of Armenia. The Treaty of Lausanne, by contrast, forfeited all arrangements and territorial annexations. = Russia = In March 1915, Foreign Minister of the Russian Empire, Sergey Sazonov, told British and French Ambassadors George Buchanan and Maurice Pal√©ologue that a lasting postwar settlement demanded Russian possession of \\"the city of Constantinople, the western shore of the Bosporus, Sea of Marmara, and Dardanelles, as well as southern Thrace up to the Enos-Midia line\\", and \\"a part of the Asiatic coast between the Bosporus, the Sakarya River, and a point to be determined on the shore of the Bay of ƒ∞zmit.\\"Armenia on the Road to Independence, 1967, p. 59 The Constantinople Agreement was made public by the Russian newspaper Izvestiya in November 1917, to gain the support of the Armenian public for the Russian revolution.Richard G. Hovannisian, The Republic of Armenia However, the said revolution effectively ended Russian plans. = United Kingdom = The British seeking control over the straits of Marmara led to the Occupation of Constantinople, with French assistance, from 13 November 1918 to 23 September 1923. After the Turkish War of Independence and the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne, the troops left the city. = Italy = Under the 1917 Agreement of Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne between France, Italy, and the United Kingdom, Italy was to receive all southwestern Anatolia except the Adana region, including ƒ∞zmir. However, in 1919 the Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos obtained the permission of the Paris Peace Conference to occupy ƒ∞zmir, overriding the provisions of the agreement. = France = Under the secret Sykes‚ÄìPicot Agreement of 1916, the French obtained Hatay, Lebanon and Syria and expressed a desire for part of South-Eastern Anatolia. The 1917 Agreement of St. Jean-de-Maurienne between France, Italy and the United Kingdom allotted France the Adana region. The French army, along with the British, occupied parts of Anatolia from 1919 to 1921 in the Franco-Turkish War, including coal mines, railways, the Black Sea ports of Zonguldak, Karadeniz Ereƒüli and Constantinople, Uzunk√∂pr√º in Eastern Thrace and the region of Cilicia. France eventually withdrew from all these areas, after the Armistice of Mudanya, the Treaty of Ankara and the Treaty of Lausanne. = Greece = Greek proposal to Paris Peace Conference Greece according to the Treaty of S√®vres The western Allies, particularly British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, promised Greece territorial gains at the expense of the Ottoman Empire if Greece entered the war on the Allied side. The promised territories included eastern Thrace, the islands of Imbros (G√∂k√ßeada) and Tenedos (Bozcaada), and parts of western Anatolia around the city of ƒ∞zmir. In May 1917, after the exile of Constantine I of Greece, Greek prime minister Eleuth√©rios Veniz√©los returned to Athens and allied with the Entente. Greek military forces (though divided between supporters of the monarchy and supporters of Veniz√©los) began to take part in military operations against the Bulgarian army on the border. That same year, ƒ∞zmir was promised to Italy under the Agreement of Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne between France, Italy and the United Kingdom. At the 1918 Paris Peace Conference, based on the wartime promises, Veniz√©los lobbied hard for an expanded Hellas (the Megali Idea) that would include the small Greek speaking community in far Southern Albania, the Orthodox Greek speaking community in Thrace (including Constantinople) and the Orthodox community in Asia Minor. In 1919, despite Italian opposition, he obtained the permission of the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 for Greece to occupy ƒ∞zmir. = South West Caucasian Republic = The South West Caucasian Republic was an entity established on Russian territory in 1918, after the withdrawal of Ottoman troops to the pre-World War I border as a result of the Armistice of Mudros. It had a nominally independent provisional government headed by Fakhr al-Din Pirioghlu and based in Kars. After fighting broke out between it and both Georgia and Armenia, British High Commissioner Admiral Somerset Arthur Gough-Calthorpe occupied Kars on 19 April 1919, abolishing its parliament and arresting 30 members of its government. He placed Kars province under Armenian rule. = Armenia = the Wilsonian Armenia according to the Treaty of S√®vres In the later years of World War I, the Armenians in Russia established a provisional government in the south-west of the Russian Empire. Military conflicts between the Turks and Armenians both during and after the war eventually determined the borders of the state of Armenia.  Administration for Western Armenia  In April 1915, Russia supported the establishment of the Armenian provisional government under Russian-Armenian Governor Aram Manukian, leader of the resistance in the Defense of Van. The Armenian national liberation movement hoped that Armenia could be liberated from the Ottoman regime in exchange for helping the Russian army. However, the Tsarist regime had a secret wartime agreement with the other members of the Triple Entente about the eventual fate of several Anatolian territories, named the Sykes‚ÄìPicot Agreement. These plans were made public by the Armenian revolutionaries in 1917 to gain the support of the Armenian public.Richard G. Hovannisian, The Republic of Armenia In the meantime, the provisional government was becoming more stable as more Armenians were moving into its territory. In 1917, 150,000 Armenians relocated to the provinces of Erzurum, Bitlis, Mu≈ü and Van.Richard G. Hovannisian, The Armenian People from Ancient to Modern Times: Foreign Dominion to Statehood: The Fifteenth... And Armen Garo (known as Karekin Pastirmaciyan) and other Armenian leaders asked for the Armenian regulars in the European theatre to be transferred to the Caucasian front. The Russian revolution left the front in eastern Turkey in a state of flux. In December 1917, a truce was signed by representatives of the Ottoman Empire and the Transcaucasian Commissariat. However, the Ottoman Empire began to reinforce its Third Army on the eastern front. Fighting began in mid- February 1918. Armenians, under heavy pressure from the Ottoman army and Kurdish irregulars, were forced to withdraw from Erzincan to Erzurum and then to Kars, eventually evacuating even Kars on 25 April. As a response to the Ottoman advances, the Transcaucasian Commissariat evolved into the short-lived Transcaucasian Federation; its disintegration resulted in Armenians forming the Democratic Republic of Armenia on 30 May 1918. The Treaty of Batum, signed on 4 June, reduced the Armenian republic to an area of only 11,000 km2. Wilsonian Armenia At the Paris Peace Conference, 1919, the Armenian Diaspora and the Armenian Revolutionary Federation argued that Historical Armenia, the region which had remained outside the control of the Ottoman Empire from 1915 to 1918, should be part of the Democratic Republic of Armenia. Arguing from the principles in Woodrow Wilson's \\"Fourteen Points\\" speech, the Armenian Diaspora argued Armenia had \\"the ability to control the region\\", based on the Armenian control established after the Russian Revolution. The Armenians also argued that the dominant population of the region was becoming more Armenian as Turkish inhabitants were moving to the western provinces. Boghos Nubar, the president of the Armenian National Delegation, added: \\"In the Caucasus, where, without mentioning the 150,000 Armenians in the Imperial Russian Army, more than 40,000 of their volunteers contributed to the liberation of a portion of the Armenian vilayets, and where, under the command of their leaders, Antranik and Nazerbekoff, they, alone among the peoples of the Caucasus, offered resistance to the Turkish armies, from the beginning of the Bolshevist withdrawal right up to the signing of an armistice.\\"letter to French Foreign Office ‚Äì 3 December 1918 President Wilson accepted the Armenian arguments for drawing the frontier and wrote: \\"The world expects of them (the Armenians), that they give every encouragement and help within their power to those Turkish refugees who may desire to return to their former homes in the districts of Trebizond, Erzerum, Van and Bitlis remembering that these peoples, too, have suffered greatly.\\"President Wilson's Acceptance letter for drawing the frontier given to the Paris Peace Conference, Washington, 22 November 1920. The conference agreed with his suggestion that the Democratic Republic of Armenia should expand into present-day eastern Turkey. = Georgia = After the fall of the Russian Empire, Georgia became an independent republic and sought to maintain control of Batumi as well as Ardahan, Artvin, and Oltu, the areas with Muslim Georgian elements, which had been acquired by Russia from the Ottomans in 1878. The Ottoman forces occupied the disputed territories by June 1918, forcing Georgia to sign the Treaty of Batum. After the demise of the Ottoman power, Georgia regained Ardahan and Artvin from local Muslim militias in 1919 and Batum from the British administration of that maritime city in 1920. It claimed but never attempted to control Oltu, which was also contested by Armenia. Soviet Russia and Turkey launched a near-simultaneous attack on Georgia in February‚ÄìMarch 1921, leading to new territorial rearrangements finalized in the Treaty of Kars, by which Batumi remained within the borders of now-Soviet Georgia, while Ardahan and Artvin were recognized as parts of Turkey. = Republic of Turkey = Between 1918 and 1923, Turkish resistance movements led by Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk forced the Greeks and Armenians out of Anatolia, while the Italians never established a presence. The Turkish revolutionaries also suppressed Kurdish attempts to become independent in the 1920s. After the Turkish resistance gained control over Anatolia, there was no hope of meeting the conditions of the Treaty of S√®vres. Before joining the Soviet Union, the Democratic Republic of Armenia signed the Treaty of Alexandropol, on 3 December 1920, agreeing to the current border between the two countries, though the Armenian government had already collapsed due to a concurrent Soviet invasion on 2 December. Afterwards Armenia became an integral part of the Soviet Union. This border was ratified again with the Treaty of Moscow (1921), in which the Bolsheviks ceded the already Turkish- occupied provinces of Kars, Iƒüdƒ±r, Ardahan, and Artvin to Turkey in exchange for the Adjara region with its capital city of Batumi. Turkey and the newly formed Soviet Union, along with the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic and Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, ratified the Treaty of Kars on 11 September 1922, establishing the north-eastern border of Turkey and bringing peace to the region, despite none of them being internationally recognized at the time. Finally, the Treaty of Lausanne, signed in 1923, formally ended all hostilities and led to the creation of the modern Turkish republic.

They are commonly known as blue Pierrots or simply Pierrots. The latter name is often used for the closely related genus Castalius. The delimitation of Castalius versus Tarucus is not yet fully resolved, with some species, such as the dark Pierrot (T. ananda), having been moved between the two genera repeatedly. It may even be that they are eventually regarded as synonymous, and in that case the older name Castalius would supersede Tarucus by the Principle of Priority. Several species formerly in Tarucus were moved to Leptotes, another closely related lineage (though not quite as close as Castalius). The caterpillars of this genus typically feed on Zizyphus and are attended by ants. Species The genus can be divided in two distinct groups. These are generally separated geographically, but some taxa (such as the black-spotted Pierrot, T. balkanicus nigra), though assigned to one group, occur in the range of the other.

History The station's original owner was Sam Phillips, who founded Memphis' Sun Records in the 1950s, and is credited with discovering Elvis Presley. The station was originally WLVS-FM (named in honor of Elvis Presley) and had offered a Rock music format when it signed on in 1978, when it was at 94.3. That was until 1979, when it flipped to country. It flipped to Beautiful music as WEZI in 1983, but would drop the format by the end of the decade for oldies as WODZ, and by 1992, they would switch frequencies to 94.1. In February 1993, they would go Country as WOGY with the branding of \\"Froggy 94,\\" and they would continue in that direction into the new millennium.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1993/RR-1993-02-12.pdf However, after Entercom bought the station in 2000, change was in the air at 94.1. While it was rumored that the station would flip from country by the holidays, the format remained into the new year. On January 24, 2001, at 10:05 a.m., \\"Froggy\\" signed off with \\"All the Good Ones Are Gone\\" by Pam Tillis, and 94.1 began stunting with the sound of a ticking clock. At 2:35 p.m., after a few delays, they flipped to Modern AC as \\"94.1 The Buzz\\", with the callsign soon changed to WMBZ. The first song on \\"The Buzz\\" was \\"Even Flow\\" by Pearl Jam. Froggy 94.1 Becomes the Buzz While at the outset the change did attract a lot of listener attention, the effect was not as long-lived as Entercom would hope. While The Buzz did manage to sound the death knell for then-WKSL and spark minor format tweaks at then-rival WMC- FM, overall it was not enough. Despite later adding Kidd Kraddick for morning drive, The Buzz began a slide in 2004 that would last the remainder of the format's tenure. On October 27, 2006, at 5 p.m., the station began stunting with a robotic countdown to 10 a.m. on the following Monday, October 30 (as well as airing occasional non-sequiturs in between numbers). At the time promised, 94.1 flipped to Rhythmic AC as WSNA, \\"Snap! 94.1, The Rhythm Of Memphis\\", with the first song on \\"Snap!\\" being \\"Let's Get It Started\\" by The Black Eyed Peas.http://www.bizjournals.com/memphis/stories/2006/10/30/daily10.htmlhttp://www.radiodiscussions.com/showthread.php?486270-What- s-the-Buzz-about-The-Buzz 94.1 The Buzz Becomes Snap! 94.1 On October 17, 2008, at 2 p.m., after playing \\"Bye Bye Bye\\" by 'N Sync, WSNA flipped to classic hits as \\"Classic Hits 94.1 KQK\\".

The number of species and definition of species limits in North American ciscoes is a matter of debate. Accordingly, Coregonus artedi may refer either in a narrow sense to one of the several types of cisco found e.g. in the Great Lakes, or in a broad sense to the complex of all ciscoes in continental North American lakes, Coregonus artedi sensu lato.  Coregonus artedi, narrow sense  Narrowly defined, Coregonus artedi is known variously with the common names cisco, northern cisco, lake herring, chub or tullibee and its Anishinaabe name Odoonibiinh. It is a pelagic fish occurring in the midwater zone of cold water lakes in North America. In the northern and western parts of its range it is also found in large rivers. This species occasionally grows as large as 40 cm and 2.3 kg (five pounds), but is more commonly 28 to 38 cm long and 170 to 907 grams (six ounces to two pounds) in weight. It is slender-bodied and silvery with pinkish iridescence on its sides. Diet is predominantly zooplankton and insect larvae, although fish eggs and larvae, including those of their own species are also documented. Small fish, including some minnow species, are also known to be consumed at times. Northern cisco are preyed upon by a wide variety of predatory species, and have a particularly important place in the diet of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush). It is also a common food of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), northern pike (Esox lucius), burbot (Lota lota), yellow perch, (Perca flavescens) and walleye (Sander vitreum) where the species overlap ranges. The abundance of northern cisco in the North American Great Lakes is much reduced from the levels of the 19th Century. Once abundant in all five lakes, it is now common only in Lake Superior. The Lake Huron population has been increasing recently, perhaps as a consequence of low alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) abundance. Limited numbers have also reappeared in Lake Michigan's lower Green Bay. Numbers in Lakes Erie and Ontario remain far below historical levels. The reduced abundance is believed to result from the cumulative effects of several factors, including the expansion of non- native species such as alewife, rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) and sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus). These species prey on and compete with various life stages of northern cisco. It is unclear what effect the annual stocking of several million non-native Pacific salmon in the Great Lakes has had on northern cisco. Additionally, substantial environmental degradation in some parts of the range has undoubtedly contributed to the stresses on northern cisco populations. The populations are therefore believed to be more vulnerable to the effects of exploitation than previously, even at levels of harvest lower than what was once sustainable. The cisco is also very sensitive to changes in temperature and levels of dissolved oxygen. Northern cisco are fished commercially and for sport. In the early years of the fishery, herring provided some of the largest catches from the Great Lakes and, when salted down or smoked for preservation, provisioned much of the surrounding territory. Northern cisco roe is also valued on the international market.  The Coregonus artedi species complex  The northern cisco or lake herring discussed above is one of several closely related North American species or forms of cisco. The group is the subject of considerable debate about the taxonomic independence and relationships of the different forms, and it has been credibly argued that they all comprise merely one highly variable larger species that also includes the ecologically and morphologically separable fishes, including the following at least (some of which may be extinct): * Coregonus alpenae ‚Äî longjaw cisco (extinct) * Coregonus artedi sensu stricto ‚Äî cisco, northern cisco or lake herring * Coregonus johannae ‚Äî deepwater cisco (extinct) * Coregonus hoyi ‚Äî bloater * Coregonus kiyi ‚Äî kiyi * Coregonus nigripinnis ‚Äî blackfin cisco (extinct) * Coregonus reighardi ‚Äî shortnose cisco (possibly extinct) * Coregonus zenithicus ‚Äî shortjaw cisco * Coregonus hubbsi ‚Äî Ives Lake cisco (possibly extinct)Coregonus hubbsi . Michigan Natural Features Inventory. 2007. Rare Species Explorer, Michigan State University, accessed August 14, 2012 Collectively, these fishes are often referred to as a species complex, the Coregonus artedi complex, or as Coregonus artedi sensu lato (broad sense).  Fishing  Commercial Fishing Commercial fishing for northern cisco in Lake Superior and the Northern Channel of Lake Huron is a very important economical source for communities in the Great Lakes region. Commercial fishing for northern cisco began in the 1800s. Initially, in Lake Ontario, northern cisco were destroyed because they were thought of as a nuisance. However, there is evidence of a turnaround in the perception of northern cisco by 1833, where northern cisco were targeted and thought of as better eating than the related lake whitefish.Kerr, S. J. 2010. Fish and Fisheries Management in Ontario: A Chronology of Events. Biodiversity Branch. Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources. Peterborough, Ontario. 80 p. + appendices. In Ontario, the yield of northern cisco was 328 tonnes in 2018. This number is substantially lower than previous years dating back to 2012, all of which numbered over 350 tonnes. This decline was due to a reduction of quotas for commercial fisheries in hopes to combat a possible population decline.\\"Fisheries Statistics - Ontario Commercial Fisheries\\". www.ocfa.ca. Retrieved 2020-03-04. While northern cisco does play an important role in the diet of many people still, its primary utility from commercial sources is for its roe.

Klein admitted that he tried, unsuccessfully, to end the game on time but no one heard him whistle so he kept the glamour tie going: \\"Not many people know, but when I blew for time the players didn't hear the whistle and as it was such a great game I let it continue for a few minutes.\\"Extending a match : Klein's comments, article, Sky Sports.com website. 1974 World Cup Klein did not attend the 1974 World Cup Finals in West Germany due to the terrorist atrocity visited upon Israeli athletes at the Summer Olympic Games held in Munich in 1972. Being an Israeli referee it was thought that he could be targeted by terrorist organisations. 1978 World Cup Klein was selected for the 1978 World Cup where he was given the Argentina v Italy match in Group A in Buenos Aires. In Klein's game Italy won with a Roberto Bettega goal but before half-time Klein denied Argentina a penalty kick. Klein said of the incident: \\"I analyzed all the players, which helped me to determine my tactics during the game. For example: towards the end of the first half, one of the Argentines went down in the penalty box and of course 80,000 people were whistling, screaming and crying for a penalty. I had learned from the previous games that I needed to be really close to the Argentinian players who caused the trouble. I am not telling you their names.\\" Brian Glanville wrote of the incident: \\"There was nothing more impressive in this World Cup than the way he stood between his linesmen at half-time in the Argentina - Italy game, scorning the banshee whistling of the incensed crowd.\\" Klein said: \\"At half- time, as I walked into the tunnel, I was booed at by 80,000 people. In the second half, as the players were called from the dressing-rooms, my tactic was not to walk onto the pitch before the players. I knew the crowd would remember what had happened at the end of the first half, and they would definitely welcome me with whistling and yelling, which is not a good feeling for a referee. So I waited until the Argentines came out of the tunnel and I entered the pitch with them, towards the applause.\\" Argentina v. Italy , 1978 World Cup: Ajax-USA.com website. The referee in the final was Sergio Gonella, the Italian. Klein's appointment, though supported originally by FIFA was disputed by the Argentinians, reputedly, because of the political links between the Netherlands and Israel. But as Klein said, later: \\"When I'm on the pitch, only two things are important to me: being fair to both teams and making my decisions bravely. I think all referees are fair, but not all of them are brave, probably. At the 1978 World Cup, I was leading Germany vs Austria. Well, to a Jew Germans and Austrians are the same.

It was founded in 1939 as a nonprofit organization, and is the largest musical copyright administration society in Japan. Overview JASRAC's main business activity is to act as trustee of copyright rights such as recording and performing rights for songwriters, lyricists, and music publishers. It manages licensing to music users, collects license fees, and distributes the same to the rights holders. It also supervises copyright infringements and prosecutes infringers. Because JASRAC is a foundation, it is subject to the subject to the rules non-profit management. Head office located in Uehara, Shibuya,Tokyo. The headquarters is located in Shibuya, Tokyo, in a building owned by the Masao Koga Music Cultural Memorial Foundation. It has 22 branches in major cities of Japan. JASRAC was established in 1939 with the predecessor Great Japan Music Association, and is the oldest copyright management company in Japan. History =Plage Whirlwind= In 1899 Japan joined the Berne Convention where the Copyright law was enforced. However, there was no concept on how to pay royalties for recorded songs for each live performance. In 1931, ), a German teacher at the imperial First High School under the old system, established a copyright management organization called \\"Plage Institution\\" in Tokyo, and argued that it mainly acquired the agency right for Japan from a European copyright management organization and began requesting music usage fees to all businesses using music, such as broadcasting stations and orchestras. As the license fees requests of Plage were at the time extralegal and their enforcement included pressurizing, the use of compositions outside Japan became actually difficult. Even NHK was due to a deadlock in the negotiations with the Prague Institution for over one year not able to broadcast foreign music pieces. Plage also began to urge Japanese artists to let the Prague Institute act as agent of their copyright management. Though he was also considered to pursue not monetary goals but the proper management of copyrights, he wasn't able to bridge the gap to the music users, and the acquisition of agency rights from Japanese authors caused further uproar. These incidents were called the \\"Plage Whirlwind\\" and triggered concentration management of copyright in Japan. =Establishment of the Copyright Brokerage Business Act= In order to develop the situation, in 1939 the copyright brokerage act () was enacted providing that only holders of permission from the Ministry of Home Affairs (Japan) can undertake copyright brokerage business, and the predecessor of JASRAC (Japanese Society for Rights of Authors, Composers and Publishers), the Great Japanese Music Copyright Association, was established and started operation in 1940. Plage was excluded from copyright management work, received a fine for violating this law, and left Japan in 1941. The Agency for Cultural Affairs granted permission of brokerage business to four organizations, including the Great Japan Music Association, and other organizations. They didn't allow other entry, and the mediation of music copyright became the monopoly business of the Great Japan Music Association. Video-sharing site In 2006, JASRAC took legal action by requesting that nearly 30,000 videos featuring songs or clips that violated the copyrights of Sony Music Entertainment Japan, Avex Japan, Pony Canyon, JVC Victor, Warner Japan, Toy's Factory, and Universal Japan be removed from YouTube. Trial and criticism In April 2008, FTC (Fair Trade Commission) officials raided the society's Tokyo headquarters on suspicion of violating Japan's Anti-Monopoly Law. In February 2009, the FTC ruled that the system prevents other companies from entering the copyright-fee collection and management business. In February 2009, a cease-and-desist order was issued by the Japanese Fair Trade Commission (FTC) for allegedly breaking the Anti- monopoly Law, demanding that the society end its blanket-fee system. Under that system, radio and TV stations are allowed unlimited use of JASRAC-managed music copyrights for a flat fee of 1.5% of their annual broadcasting revenue. The order was withdrawn, however, in June 2012. On 1 November 2013, in response to a petition by rival e-License Inc., the Tokyo High Court declared that JASRAC's fee levying system impeded competition within the industry and made it extremely difficult for other organizations to enter the market. In February 2017, JASRAC sparked a controversy that they announced they would start collecting copyright fees off of music schools.. In response to this, many schools, including Yamaha Music Foundation across Japan filed a petition, arguing that it would lead to increased tuition.

Canvas prints are used as the final output in an art piece, or as a way to reproduce other forms of art. Printing methods Reproductions of original artwork have been printed on canvas for many decades using offset printing. Since the 1990s, canvas print has been also been associated with either dye sublimation or inkjet print processes (often referred to as repligraph or gicl√©e\\"What's In a Name: The True Story of Gicl√©e\\" By Harald Johnson respectively). The canvas print material is generally cotton or plastic based poly canvas, often used for the reproduction of photographic images. Digital printers capable of producing canvas prints range from small consumer printers owned by the artist or photographer themselves up to large format printing service printers capable of printing onto canvas rolls measuring or more. Digital files of artwork, paintings, photograph, or drawings may be sent directly to printing companies or Internet based printing services. Stretcher mounted One of the display methods is to trimmed the canvas to size then glued, or staple it to traditional stretcher bars, or a wooden panel and displayed it in a frame, or frame-less in a gallery wrap. The stretchers are usually constructed from solid pine and underpinned for added strength. A print that is designed to continue round the edges of a stretcher frame once gallery-wrapped is referred to as full-bleed. Uses for prints Canvas prints are used as final output for fine art pieces or for reproduction of other types of two dimensional art (drawings, paintings photograph, etc.). Canvas prints are often used as a cheaper alternative to framed artwork as there is no glazing required and the stretcher is not usually visible, so do not need to be varnished, or treated.

The genus consists of 12 species, which are native to Central and South America, as well as parts of the Caribbean. Description These bats grow to an average length of 5 to 10 cm, and a weight of 10 to 85 g. The fur is colored brown or gray on the top; the bottom side is brighter. In a few species, the faces have four light-colored stripes. The patagium, the skin between the legs, is very small, and they lack a tail ‚Äì a general characteristic of the fruit bats. The ears are acuminated and like many other leaf-nosed bats the nose bears a small, sharp leaf which is used for echolocation. Geographical distribution and habitat Neotropical fruit bats are found in an area that reaches from the north of Mexico and the Bahamas, to northern Argentina, the Caribbean islands included. They live in different natural habitats and can be found in both forests and grasslands. Diet, reproduction and social behaviour Like most bats, Neotropical fruit bats are nocturnal. They sleep in caves, houses, or other hideouts. Some species use large leaves to form \\"tents\\", which provide shelter from the weather and hide them from predators. Most species live in large groups. Artibeus jamaicensis ‚Äì the best studied species ‚Äì forms groups, consisting of one to three males, three to 14 females, and the shared offspring. The diet of these bats mainly consists of fruit, but they eat pollen and insects too. Little is known about the reproduction of many species. A. jamaicensis has a gestation period of usually 112 to 120 days that can be extended up to 180 days due to dormancy. The offspring usually consists of one young, which is weaned after two months and becomes sexually mature at an age of eight to twelve months. Captured bats can live up to ten years. Taxonomy The genus of the Neotropical fruit bats is divided into two sub-genera (Artibeus and Koopmania. Genus Artibeus - Neotropical fruit bats *Subgenus Artibeus **Large fruit-eating bat, Artibeus amplus lives in Colombia, Venezuela, and Guyana. **Fringed fruit-eating bat, Artibeus fimbriatus has its habitat in southern Brazil, in Paraguay and in the North of Argentina. **Fraternal fruit-eating bat, Artibeus fraterculus is only known in Ecuador and Peru. **Hairy fruit-eating bat, Artibeus hirsutus lives in western Mexico. **Honduran fruit-eating bat, Artibeus inopinatus is located in Middle America (El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Honduras). This poorly known species is considered data deficient by the IUCN. **Jamaican fruit bat, Artibeus jamaicensis is the best explored species. It is spread from the Bahamas and northern Mexico, through Central America to northwestern Peru. Populations east of the Andes in South America are now usually regarded a separate species, A. planirostris. **Great fruit-eating bat, Artibeus lituratus is spread from southern Mexico to northern Argentina. **Dark fruit- eating bat, Artibeus obscurus lives exclusively in the Amazon Basin. **Flat- faced fruit-eating bat, Artibeus planirostris is found in most of tropical South America east of the Andes.

She writes frequently on Palestinian issues in newspapers and magazines, including The Guardian, The Nation and Journal of Palestine Studies. She is a fellow and lecturer at the Institute of Arab & Islamic studies at University of Exeter. Early life Dr. Ghada Karmi Karmi was born in Jerusalem to a Muslim family. Her father, Hasan Sa'id Karmi was Palestinian while her mother was Syrian. In her 2002 autobiography, In Search of Fatima: A Palestinian Story, she describes growing up in the Jerusalem neighbourhood of Katamon, with its mixture of Palestinian Christians and Muslims. Among the family friends and neighbors was Khalil al-Sakakini and his family. Her family fled Jerusalem in 1948, and their family villa was seized by Israel. In 1983 the New York Times bought it and installed its correspondents on a second story structure built onto the Karmi villa. The Karmi family received no compensation for the confiscation.Philip Weiss, 'Ghada Karmi visits the ‚ÄòNew York Times‚Äô reporter in her former house in Jerusalem,' Mondoweiss 1 December 2015. The family eventually settled in the predominantly Jewish neighbourhood of Golders Green, in London, England, where her father, Hasan, worked for the BBC Arabic service. She studied and became a doctor of medicine, graduating from the University of Bristol in 1964. Initially Karmi practised as a physician, specialising in the health and social conditions of ethnic minorities, migrants and asylum seekers. Since 1972 she has been politically active for the Palestinian cause and gained a doctorate in the history of Arabic medicine from London University. In 1998, she visited her childhood home in Katamon for the first time since 1948. She is an associate fellow at the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London, and a visiting professor at London Metropolitan University. She is also vice-chair of the Council for Arab-British Understanding (CAABU) She delivered the Edward Said Memorial lecture at the University of Adelaide, Australia in October, 2007 Academic work In 2012, Karmi, an honorary research fellow at the University of Exeter‚Äôs Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies, was accused of using the unconfirmed quotation \\"The bride is beautiful, but she is married to another man\\" in her book Married to Another Man and in her other academic and popular writing.\\"The bride is beautiful, but she is married to another man\\": Historical Fabrication and an Anti-Zionist Myth\\", Shai Afsai, Shofar, Vol. 30, No. 3 ‚ô¶ 2012, pp. 35-61 Statements on Israel In an interview with Executive Intelligence Review (reprinted in Middle East Policy Journal), Karmi stated that: > \\"There is actually nothing ‚Äî repeat, nothing ‚Äî positive about the existence > of Israel, as far as the Arabs are concerned.

At the Palestinian Return Conference held in January 2011, Karmi referred to the creation of Israel as involving the \\"dispossession and theft of a whole country\\" and that \\"The only way to reverse that is on the basis of rights and justice; that is the right of return of the refugees and the dispossessed and the exiles back to their homeland.\\" She was then quoted as stating: > \\"If that were to happen we know very well that that would be the end of a > Jewish state in our region\\".Ghada Karmi calls for ‚Äúthe end of a Jewish state > in our region‚Äù by Richard Millett, The Jewish Chronicle, January 16, 2011. At a protest as part of the Global March to Jerusalem held in front of the Israeli Embassy in London on March 30, 2012, Karmi stated ‚ÄúIsrael is finished‚Äù and that ‚ÄúToday, we are here together because we know, we understand what Israel is doing to Jerusalem,‚Äù further stating that Jerusalem ‚Äúdoes not belong to Jewish Israelis or to Jews.

Originally released as a single in 1994, it became the group's biggest hit. In April 1996, it peaked at number eighteen in the United Kingdom. Song information Appearing on the band's third album, Be a Girl, the song was also included on their next album, Bagsy Me, due to the success of the re-released single and the song's appearance on the soundtrack of Baz Luhrmann's film Romeo + Juliet. For the second UK single release, the song's title acquired an ampersand. The B-side, \\"Blister in the Sun\\", is a cover of a song by the Violent Femmes. Usage in other media The song was used in the British soap opera Coronation Streets climax to one of its biggest ever plots, in which serial killer Richard Hillman drove into a canal with his family in the car; the song was used again in 2007 when David Platt did the same thing, but with only him in the car. Baz Luhrmann also included the song in the soundtrack for Romeo + Juliet in 1996. In 2013, the song featured in a sketch for the tenth episode of the eighth series of Russell Howard's Good News. In 2000, it was featured in a Pantene advert. In 2005, the song was featured in a Close-Up advertisement in the Philippines. In May 2014, the song featured in an advert for Pets at Home.

De-industrialization is a process of social and economic change caused by the removal or reduction of industrial capacity or activity in a country or region, especially of heavy industry or manufacturing industry. There are different interpretations of what de- industrialization is. Many associate de-industrialization of the United States with the mass closing of automaker plants in the now so-called \\"Rust Belt\\" between 1980 and 1990.Robert Forrant (2008) Metal Fatigue. The US Federal Reserve raised interest and exchange rates beginning in 1979, and continuing until 1984, which automatically caused import prices to fall. Japan was rapidly expanding productivity during this time, and this decimated the US machine tool sector. A second wave of de-industrialization occurred between 2001 and 2009, culminating in the automaker bailout of GM and Chrysler. Research has pointed to investment in patents rather than in new capital equipment as a contributing factor.Kerwin Kofi Charles et al (2018)The Transformation of Manufacturing and the Decline in US Employment in U.S. Employment‚àó, National Bureau of Economic Research At a more fundamental level, Cairncross and Lever offer four possible definitions of deindustrialization: # A straightforward long-term decline in the output of manufactured goods or in employment in the manufacturing sector. # A shift from manufacturing to the service sectors, so that manufacturing has a lower share of total employment. Such a shift may occur even if manufacturing employment is growing in absolute terms # That manufactured goods comprise a declining share of external trade, so that there is a progressive failure to achieve a sufficient surplus of exports over imports to maintain an economy in external balance # A continuing state of balance of trade deficit (as described in the third definition above) that accumulates to the extent that a country or region is unable to pay for necessary imports to sustain further production of goods, thus initiating a further downward spiral of economic decline. Explanations Theories that predict or explain de-industrialization have a long intellectual lineage. Rowthorn argues that Marx's theory of declining (industrial) profit may be regarded as one of the earliest. This theory argues that technological innovation enables more efficient means of production, resulting in increased physical productivity, i.e., a greater output of use value per unit of capital invested. In parallel, however, technological innovations replace people with machinery, and the organic composition of capital increases. Assuming only labor can produce new additional value, this greater physical output embodies a smaller value and surplus value. The average rate of industrial profit therefore declines in the longer term. Rowthorn and Wells distinguish between de-industrialization explanations that see it as a positive process of, for example, maturity of the economy, and those that associate de- industrialization with negative factors like bad economic performance. They suggest de-industrialization may be both an effect and a cause of poor economic performance. Pitelis and Antonakis suggest that, to the extent that manufacturing is characterized by higher productivity, this leads, all other things being equal, to a reduction in relative cost of manufacturing products, thus a reduction in the relative share of manufacturing (provided manufacturing and services are characterized by relatively inelastic demand). Moreover, to the extent that manufacturing firms downsize through, e.g., outsourcing, contracting out, etc., this reduces manufacturing share without negatively influencing the economy. Indeed, it potentially has positive effects, provided such actions increase firm productivity and performance. George Reisman identified inflation as a contributor to de-industrialization. In his analysis, the process of fiat money inflation distorts the economic calculations necessary to operate capital-intensive manufacturing enterprises, and makes the investments necessary for sustaining the operations of such enterprises unprofitable. Institutional arrangements have also contributed to de-industrialization such as economic restructuring. With breakthroughs in transportation, communication and information technology, a globalized economy that encouraged foreign direct investment, capital mobility and labor migration, and new economic theory's emphasis on specialized factor endowments, manufacturing moved to lower-cost sites and in its place service sector and financial agglomerations concentrated in urban areas. The term de- industrialization crisis has been used to describe the decline of labor- intensive industry in a number of countries and the flight of jobs away from cities. One example is labor-intensive manufacturing. After free-trade agreements were instituted with less developed nations in the 1980s and 1990s, labor-intensive manufacturers relocated production facilities to third world countries with much lower wages and lower standards. In addition, technological inventions that required less manual labor, such as industrial robots, eliminated many manufacturing jobs.

The tradition began in 1913 and continues to this day. History The city‚Äôs Christmas tree tradition began in 1913. One tree that went on display, a Colorado Blue Spruce, had been a housewarming gift 30 years earlier for a couple who had moved into their new home. Another tree donated had been planted to honor a son who was killed in a car crash. The son‚Äôs ashes were mixed in the dirt used to plant the tree. In 2008, the chosen tree broke and arrived at the lighting ceremony in two pieces.Watch out for that Christmas tree Journal Sentinel, 2009 For the 100th anniversary celebration in 2013, the Christmas tree was a 40-foot Colorado Blue Spruce donated by the Loving Shepherd Lutheran Church and School. Selecting the official Christmas Tree Today, residents within the City of Milwaukee are asked to nominate a Christmas tree for the holidays. The shortlisted trees are then judged for their size, shape, uniformity, density, and color. The ideal tree must be between 30 and 40 feet tall and accessible for harvest with a crane.City Seeks Candidates for 2012 City/County Christmas Tree The donors of the chosen tree flip the switch in the Christmas tree lighting ceremony. Activities / Preactivities The Christmas tree lighting ceremony usually starts at 5:15PM and is held at Red Arrow Park. In 2011, guest performers included American Idol finalist and Milwaukee native Naima Adedapo, while John McGivern, a local comedian, served as master of ceremonies.City/County tree lighting set for Thursday at Red Arrow Park Today's TMJ 4, 2011 In 2013, for the event's 100th Anniversary, pre-activities began at 4:30PM with music provided by the Lincoln Center of the Arts Ambassador Choir, the Salvation Army Brass Ensemble, and the Milwaukee Repertory Theater's A Christmas Carol cast. Special guests included characters from Milwaukee Ballet's Nutcracker and the Milwaukee Children's Choir. Refreshments for the celebration were provided by Starbucks.Annual City/County Christmas tree has been lit for the season Fox 6 Milwaukee, 2014 Naming controversy Like many other city- endorsed Christmas tree lightings, the tree lighting in Milwaukee was labeled \\"holiday\\" rather than \\"Christmas\\" in 1995 so as not to \\"offend non- Christians\\".Milwaukee Madness: The Holiday Tree vs. The Christmas Tree Isabella Carini, 2006 In 2004 and 2005 many cities reversed their decision and re-labeled the tree as \\"Christmas\\" rather than the generic \\"holiday\\".

Comics in Spain are usually called historietas or c√≥mics, with tebeos primarily denoting the magazines containing the medium. Tebeo is a phonetic adaptation of TBO, a long-running (1917‚Äì1983) Spanish comic book magazine, and sounds like \\"te veo\\" (\\"I see you\\"). Two publishing houses ‚Äî Editorial Bruguera and Editorial Valenciana ‚Äî dominated the Spanish comics market for most of its history. Spanish artists have traditionally worked in other markets reaching great success, either in the American (e.g., Eisner Award winners Sergio Aragon√©s, Salvador Larroca, Gabriel Hern√°ndez Walta, Marcos Mart√≠n or David Aja), the British (e.g., Carlos Ezquerra, co-creator of Judge Dredd) or the Franco-Belgian one (e.g., first Fauve d'Or winner Julio Ribera or Blacksad authors Juan D√≠az Canales and Juanjo Guarnido).  History  = Origins = Domingu√≠n (1915) It has been stated that the 13th century Cantigas de Santa Mar√≠a could be considered as the first Spanish \\"comic\\", although comics made their official debut around 1857 at the Spanish colonies. Among the first comic magazines in peninsular Spain were the satirical La Flaca (1869-1876) or El Mundo C√≥mico (1873). After them, TBO was specially influential in popularizing the medium.Mart√≠n (01/1968), pp. 9 a 10. One of the magazine's recurring features was Los grandes inventos del TBO (\\"the great inventions of TBO\\") which depicted humorous Rube Goldberg-like machines. Other important early humorous comic magazines were Pulgarcito (1921‚Äì1986) and Lily (the latter for girls). = Golden age despite censorship (1940-1975) = After the Spanish Civil War the Franco regime imposed strict censorship in all media, and comics were no exception. As part of this ban, superhero comics were forbidden by the Francoist regime; as a result, comic heroes were based on historical fiction (influenced by Foster's Prince Valiant). In 1944 the medieval hero El Guerrero del Antifaz (\\"the masked warrior\\") was created by Manuel Gago and published by Editorial Valenciana. Another popular medieval hero, Capit√°n Trueno, was created in 1956 by V√≠ctor Mora and Miguel Ambrosio Zaragoza. Despite Franco's controls, the 1940s and 1950s are considered a golden age of Spanish comics, and many titles were at the height of their popularity.Porcel (2002), 69-70. During this period, Editorial Bruguera created a recognizable style of humor comics with a mixture of comedy of manners and slapstick (influenced by Franco-Belgian authors such as Franquin) starring chronic losers. Among the popular characters of this era were Cifr√©'s El rep√≥rter Tribulete, Escobar's Carpanta and Zipi y Zape, and V√°zquez's Las hermanas Gilda. Editorial Bruguera also published adventure comics such as Capit√°n Trueno and Silver Roy. In 1958 Ib√°√±ez's Mortadelo y Filem√≥n was first published, a series that soon became the most popular comic media in Spain, together with some of his other creations (e.g., 13. Rue del Percebe). Editorial Valenciana published adventures comics such as Roberto Alc√°zar y Pedr√≠n (debuting in 1940), Miguel Quesada's La Pandilla de los Siete and El Guerrero del Antifaz. Editorial Valenciana's humor series were not as slapstick, with more absurd and harmless comedy; they featured synthetic drawing and, in academic terms, were more finished, with an \\"abundance of backgrounds, change of perspective, depth of field\\" and some statism.Porcel (2002), 308-311. In the 1960s Spanish comics had to adapt to changing times and more restrictive censorship. Editorial Bruguera was the leader of juvenile comics during those years, with authors such as Fresnos, Jan, Joan March, Nicol√°s, Jaume Ribera, and Jaume Rovira. In 1969 the magazine Gran Pulgarcito serialized the first long strip (44 pages) of Mortadelo y Filem√≥n. Adults read horror comics such as Dossier Negro (1968), Vampus (1971) or Rufus (1973), or satirical comics such as El Papus (1973). Humor comics of the 1970s became more absurdist, with characters such as Sir Tim O'Theo (1970) or Superl√≥pez (1975). One of the authors who adapted well to this more surreal style was V√°zquez with his strip Anacleto, agente secreto. = Post-Franco era (1975-1980s) = After the death of Franco in 1975, there was an increased interest in adult comics, with magazines such as Totem, El Jueves, 1984, and El V√≠bora, and works such as Paracuellos by Carlos Gim√©nez. However, successful humor comics continued to appear at children- oriented media, such as Goomer (1988). In 1989 the annual comic book convention of Barcelona was inaugurated. = Hard times (1990s-2000s) = Market saturation became evident in 1983 with the closure of the magazines of Ediciones Metropol. Things during this era were complicated by a crisis that increased the price of paper,Be√°, Josep Mar√≠a in an interview in \\"Entrecomics\\" at 10/06/08 located here. as well as the rise of video games. Editorial Bruguera filed for bankruptcy on 7 June 1982. In 1986 it was acquired by Grupo Z and transformed into Ediciones B. In the 1990s most adult comic magazines (Cairo, Zona 84, Cimoc) ceased publishing. El V√≠bora closed in 2005. The most notable survivor of that era was El Jueves. Mortadelo and all Ediciones B comic magazines disappeared in 1996. Mortadelo y Filem√≥n and Superl√≥pez are still published directly in album format. = Present = Among the notable Spanish webcomics are ¬°Eh, t√≠o!, El joven Lovecraft, El Listo and ¬°Universo!. Since 2007, a National Comic Award which revitalized the medium was established by the Spanish Ministry of Culture.

Complete Streets allow for safe travel by those walking, cycling, driving automobiles, riding public transportation, or delivering goods. The term is often used by transportation advocates, urban planners, traffic and highway engineers, public health practitioners, and community members in the United States and Canada. Complete Streets are promoted as offering improved safety, health, economic, and environmental outcomes. Complete Streets emphasize the importance of safe access for all users, not just automobiles. Related concepts include living streets, Woonerf, and home zones. History After World War II, many communities in the United States were designed to facilitate easy and fast access to destinations via automobile. In rural and suburban communities, people often rely on the automobile as their sole means of transportation and even in areas with public transportation and safe places to walk and bicycle, they live in a state of automobile dependence wherein automobiles are the central focus of transportation, infrastructure and land use policies to the extent that other modes of transportation, such as walking, cycling and mass transit, have become impractical.Newman, P. and J. Kenworthy. Sustainability and Cities: Overcoming Automobile Dependence. Washington, DC: Island Press. 1999. Oregon enacted the first Complete Streets-like policy in the United States in 1971, requiring that new or rebuilt roads accommodate bicycles and pedestrians, and also calling on state and local governments to fund pedestrian and bicycle facilities in the public right-of-way.Oregon Department of Transportation. \\"Bike Bill and Use of Highway Funds\\". Page updated February 4, 2007, accessed April 12, 2011. Since then, 16 additional state legislatures have adopted Complete Streets laws. In 2003, Barbara McCann, who would later become the Executive Director of the National Complete Streets Coalition, coordinated a search for a replacement for the term \\"routine accommodation.\\" The term \\"complete streets\\" was suggested by David Goldberg, the communications director for Smart Growth America, and it was adopted by a coalition of advocacy groups to refer both to a comprehensive approach to street design and to the coalition itself. The National Complete Streets Coalition was founded in 2005 by a coalition of advocacy and trade groups, including AARP, the American Planning Association and the American Society of Landscape Architects. The American Public Transportation Association, Blue Cross Blue Shield Minnesota, the National Association of Realtors, and the Institute of Transportation Engineers are examples of other current Coalition Steering Committee members. Federal complete streets legislation was proposed in 2008 and 2009, but failed to become law.\\"H.R. 1443: Complete Streets Act of 2009\\", \\"Govtrack.us\\", accessed March 10, 2011.\\"S. 584: Complete Streets Act of 2009\\", \\"Govtrack.us\\", accessed March 10, 2011.Library of Congress, \\"Bill Summary & Status\\", Thomas. Accessed April 15, 2011. In 2010, the U.S. Department of Transportation issued a policy statement on bicycle and pedestrian accommodation, declaring its support for their inclusion in federal-aid transportation projects and encouraging community organizations, public transportation agencies, and state and local governments to adopt similar policies.\\"Policy Statement on Bicycle and Pedestrian Accommodation\\", \\"U.S. Department of Transportation\\", March 11, 2010, accessed April 15, 2011. By early 2013, more than 490 jurisdictions in United States had adopted a Complete Streets policy, including twenty-seven states, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Some of these jurisdictions passed legislation enacting their policies into law, while others chose to implemented their policies by executive order or internal policy. Still more jurisdictions have passed non-binding resolutions in support of Complete Streets, or created transportation plans that incorporate Complete Streets principles.Smart Growth America, Complete Streets Policy Analysis, 2012 Design elements Four traffic lanes were changed into two traffic lanes plus bike lanes and left-turn lanes. New road distribution in Davis (CA). Now pedestrian and cyclists have better safety conditions. The specific design elements of Complete Streets vary, based on context and project goals, but they may include: *Pedestrian infrastructure such as sidewalks; traditional and raised crosswalks; median crossing islands; Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 compliant facilities including audible cues for people with low vision, pushbuttons reachable by people in wheelchairs, and curb cuts; and curb extensions. *Traffic calming measures to lower speeds of automobiles and define the edges of automobile travel lanes, including a road diet, center medians, shorter curb corner radii, elimination of free-flow right-turn lanes, angled, face-out parking, street trees, planter strips and ground cover. *Bicycle accommodations, such as protected or dedicated bicycle lanes, neighborhood greenways, wide paved shoulders, and bicycle parking. *Public transit accommodations, such as bus rapid transit, bus pullouts, transit signal priority, bus shelters, and dedicated bus lanes.National Complete Streets Coalition, \\"Complete streets FAQ\\" , 2010, accessed April 11, 2011.Laplante, John and McCann, Barbara. \\"We Can Get There From Here\\". ITE Journal, May 2008. Such elements have been used successfully in projects across the United States as shown in the following examples: * In Orlando, Florida, a road diet was employed to reduce Edgewater Drive from 4 lanes to 3 with bike lanes and streetscape beautifications. The change reduced crashes 35 percent and increased bicycling and walking 23 and 30 percent respectively. The change also helped spur economic development and was claimed to enhance the neighborhood's sense of place. *In Charlotte, North Carolina, a redesign on East Boulevard completed in three phases converted a 4 lanes into 3 lanes and improved left-turn access for vehicles. *In New York City, transit improvements through Select Bus Service included off-board fare payment to speed boarding times and dedicated lanes for buses. As a result, bus speeds increased 20 percent and total number of bus riders increased 10 percent. In addition, Fordham Road's locally based businesses saw a 71 percent increase in retail sales, compared to 23 percent borough-wide.New York City Department of Transportation (2012). Measuring the Street: New Metrics for 21st Century Streets *Marin County, California added bike lanes to the busy Alameda del Prado roadway. As a result, the area saw a 366 percent increase in weekday bicyclists and 540 percent increase in weekend bicyclists.Federal Highway Administration (2012) Report to the U.S. Congress on the Outcomes of the Nonmotorized Transportation Pilot Program SAFETEA-LU Section 1807 Complete Streets policies normally allow for three kinds of exceptions to roadway projects roadways: freeways or other roads where non-motorized transportation is banned by law; roadways where the cost of accommodation would be too disproportionate to the need or expected use; and roadways where lack of present and future need is shown to make accommodation unnecessary.\\"Policy Elements\\" , \\"National Complete Streets Coalition\\", accessed February 16, 2011. Benefits Proponents of Complete Streets policies believe that they improve safety, lower transportation costs, provide transportation alternatives, encourage health through walking and biking, stimulate local economies, create a sense of place, improve social interaction, and generally improve adjacent property values. Opponents may consider automobile-only infrastructure to be a better use of public funds, or consider efforts to encourage other forms of transportation to be coercive.O'Toole, Randal \\"Secretary of Behavior Modification\\", \\"Cato@Liberty\\", May 29, 2009, accessed April 15, 2011 Individual projects and policies have sometimes faced specific local opposition, typically based on concerns over traffic flow and automobile access.Goodman, J.

A diagram showing a guide to complete streets in Los Angeles with emphasis on bicyclist safety =Safety= Complete streets policies are meant in part to improve safety, and various studies suggest that Complete Streets principles have done so. A Federal Highway Administration safety review found that designing the street with pedestrians in mind‚Äîsidewalks, raised medians, turning access controls, better bus stop placement, better lighting, traffic calming measures, and treatments for disabled travelers‚Äîall improve pedestrian, bicyclist and motorist safety.B.J. Campbell, Charles V. Zegeer, Herman H. Huang, and Michael J. Cynecki. A Review of Pedestrian Safety Research in the United States and Abroad. Jan. 2004, Federal Highway Administration, Publication number FHWA-RD-03-042 Rates of pedestrian injuries and fatalities decrease 88% when sidewalks are added, 69% hybrid beacon signals are added, and 39% when medians are added.FHWA, An Analysis of Factors Contributing to \\"Walking Along Roadway\\" Crashes: Research Study and Guidelines for Sidewalks and Walkways.Report No. FHWA-RD-01-101, FHWA, Washington D.C., 2001. The University of Oregon published a before and after study of 25 complete street projects and found significant automobile speed crash reductions for projects throughout the country. =Health= A variety of reports and organizations have suggested that complete streets policies could improve public health by promoting walking and bicycling. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend adoption of a Complete Streets policy as a strategy to prevent obesity. A report of the National Conference of State Legislatures named Complete Streets policies as the most effective policy avenue for encouraging bicycling and walking.Teach Robbins, L., Morandi, L. Promoting Walking and Biking: the Legislative Role. NCSL, December 2002. access: www.activelivingleadership.org/pdf_file/Promoting_Walking_and_biking.pdf One study found that 43% of people with safe places to walk within 10 minutes of home met recommended physical activity levels, while just 27% of those without safe places to walk were active enough.Powell, K.E., Martin, L., & Chowdhury, P.P. Places to walk: convenience and regular physical activity. American Journal of Public Health, 93, (2003): 1519-1521. The Institute of Medicine recommends fighting childhood obesity by changing ordinances to encourage construction of sidewalks, bikeways, and other places for physical activity.Koplan, J.P., Liverman, C.T., & Kraak, V.I. (Eds.). Committee on Prevention of Obesity in Children and Youth. (2004). Preventing childhood obesity: Health in the balance. Washington, DC: Institute of Medicine. Retrieved December 7, 2004 from http://books.nap.edu/catalog/11015.html A report of the National Conference of State Legislators found that complete streets policies are the most effective policy avenue for encouraging bicycling and walking. Over one third of regular public transit users meet the minimum daily requirement for physical activity.Besser, L. M. and A. L. Dannenberg (2005). Walking to public transit steps to help meet physical activity recommendations. American Journal of Preventive Medicine 29(4): 273-280. =Economic= Proponents of Complete Streets believe that as communities become safer, more attractive, and provide more transportation choices, local economies thrive and land values rise. Successful Complete Streets implementation has helped some communities stimulate local economies. A revitalization project in Lancaster, CA helped create 50 new businesses and over 800 new jobs. After a 2007 Complete Streets redesign in parts of New York City, there was a nearly 50% increase in retail sales on 9th Avenue in Manhattan and a nearly 50% decrease in commercial vacancies in Union Square. Transit and bicycle/pedestrian projects create more construction jobs than traditional roadway jobs: Complete Streets projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 created more jobs than projects on road repair and new construction. Under the stimulus, transit projects created nearly twice the job hours for every $1 billion than highway projects.Smart Growth America (2011) Recent Lessons form the Stimulus: Transportation Funding and Job Creation Pedestrian and bicycle projects create between 1.8 and 3.8 more jobs than auto-only projects.Garrett-Peltier, Heidi. Pedestrian and Bicycle Infrastructure: A National Study of Employment Impacts. Political Economy Research Institute at University of Massachusetts Amherst. June 2011 This job creation, however, is not a free lunch since it requires greater government expenditure. =Environment= Complete Streets can also have a positive effect on the environment. By providing safe options for people to walk and bike, Complete Streets can lead to fewer people driving in their cars, resulting in lowered automobile emissions. The 2009 National Household Travel Survey found that 39% of all trips in metropolitan areas are three miles or less and 17% of all trips are one mile or less.National Household Travel Survey, 2009 Most of these trips can easily be made on foot or bicycle and Complete Streets provide the infrastructure to allow people to safely do so. Traveling by foot or bike are zero-emission means of travel. Communities with strong Complete Streets policies and implementation, including Boulder, Colorado, see a reduction in their emissions. Over the last several years, fewer people in Boulder drove alone and bicycle and transit trips increased. As a result, the city cut annual carbon dioxide emissions by half a million pounds. =Benefits in policy= In addition to benefits provided by infrastructural elements of Complete Streets, the development of Complete Streets policy encourages facilitation of community inclusiveness and educational opportunities as well as establishes a context sensitive approach in design and implementation of transportation improvements. At a total of 899 currently enacted Complete Streets policy documents within U.S, states and territories, the 82 Complete Streets policies passed and enacted in communities in 2015 have been analyzed by the National Complete Streets Coalition in collaboration with Smart Growth America under a policy grading- rubric consisting of comprehensive elements. In this analysis the Coalition found that community outreach and context sensitivity were important characteristics included throughout the documented examples and were weighted considerably in determining the efficiency and effectiveness of examined policies. Complete Streets implementation is complementary in making sure transportation projects fit within their context in that implementation goals provided within policy align with context sensitive solutions such as instructing municipalities to include public meetings, maintained communication with stake-holders, and street transportation use classification. Additionally, community outreach that is promoted and achieved through educational opportunities of Complete Streets principles helps establish community social connectivity and encourages participation in active transportation modes. In 2003, the Partnership for Active Communities established a five-year plan to bring together multidisciplinary organizations with the goal of moving toward Complete Streets and improving transportation facilities in the Sacramento, California area. Inter-organizational partnerships and a comprehensive communication plan within the effort lead to awareness of safety issues associated active transportation methods along under-designed infrastructure. Educational opportunities within the project helped solidify connectivity among community members and organizations while working to remedy transportation issues with influence in policy changes.  Counterarguments  Some have claimed that transportation engineers in the US have become too focused on separating cyclists from pedestrians and motorists. This may limit cyclists‚Äô perceptions of where it is acceptable to cycle. It can also compel people to ride on a bike path even if they prefer to ride in traffic. In his 1970s book, Effective Cycling, John Forester advocated for what became known as vehicular cycling.

Morrison previously played with Camp Freddy and fronted the hard rock act Circus Diablo. He has also been a member of The Cult, Stimulator, Doheny and Into a Circle. Morrison co-hosted Indie 103.1's Camp Freddy Radio with Dave Navarro until the radio show's retirement in 2008. Early life and career Close-up image of Billy Morrison earlier in his career Morrison was born in the UK and is an only child. Early in his career, he was a member of the indie rock band Into a Circle. Consistent abuse of drugs led to a period of inactivity until he recovered and formed Stimulator in 1995. The band signed a recording contract with Geffen Records and recorded an album, but the company never released it. In 2008, Morrison released the album under his own name, stating \\"When I read about Tunecore, and when the business started to lend itself to home releases ‚Äì the indie, DIY approach ‚Äì I wanted to finally release it. All the hard copies sold out, and it still does good business on iTunes. I would call that a success.\\" = The Cult (2001) = In 2001, at the request of Billy Duffy, Morrison joined The Cult as the band's bass player. Although he primarily plays rhythm guitar, he enjoyed the idea of playing bass for such a seminal rock band. He toured with The Cult for more than a year, which included playing shows in the UK and Japan and touring with Aerosmith in the U.S. During a subsequent period of inactivity for The Cult, Morrison joined forces with Pitchshifter frontman J.S. Clayden and formed Doheny. However, no material from Doheny was released commercially. In 2009, Morrison talked about the experience in an interview. \\"We wrote some songs together, had a laugh and put a lineup together, but I think Doheny suffered from being over-rehearsed and under-funded. We played every note perfectly and had no money to get out on the road and get out of L.A. That was it. But some great songs came out of those years. We should release them.\\" = Camp Freddy (2002) = In 2002, Morrison joined forces with Dave Navarro, Matt Sorum, Donovan Leitch and Scott Ford to form Camp Freddy. In addition to his performances with the band, Morrison hosted a radio show, Camp Freddy Radio, on Los Angeles-based Indie 103.1 for three years with Navarro and Leitch. Morrison began acting in 2005 and delivered his first on-screen performance in the independent movie Tripping Forward as drug dealer Sweaty Steve. Since then, he has made other independent films, including Evilution, Basement Jack and K-11 (directed by Jules Stewart). He has described the acting process as \\"something I would love to do more of\\", and he continues to develop TV and film projects. = Circus Diablo (2006) = In 2006, Morrison formed Circus Diablo with fellow The Cult guitarist Billy Duffy and former Fuel frontman Brett Scallions on bass guitar. The lineup was completed by former The Almighty front man Ricky Warwick and Slunt drummer Charles Ruggiero. The band subsequently added former Korn guitarist Rob Patterson and singer-songwriter Patrick Cornell to its lineup. The band's first album released in July 2007, and the first single, \\"Loaded\\", reached number 29 on the Active Rock Chart.

History  The State House's existence is book-ended by two dramatic changes in the state of Illinois' passenger rail service. The State House made its first run on October 1, 1973, the same day that two French-built Turboliner trainsets replaced the conventional Abraham Lincoln and Prairie State on the Chicago--St. Louis corridor. This third round-trip was intended as a Chicago--Springfield route and received funding from the Illinois Department of Transportation. Amtrak decided to continue the train to St. Louis (at its own expense) via Carlinville and Alton because of the difficulty in turning the train in Springfield. Over its 33-year history the State House stopped in Joliet, Pontiac, Lincoln, Springfield, Carlinville, Alton and St. Louis. Service to Bloomington ended on June 10, 1990, when operations moved to a new station up the tracks in Normal. Service to Dwight began October 26, 1986 and Summit on October 25, 1987.

He inherited the bulk of his family's property and, after the War of 1812, purchased and acquired land through marriage around what is now the Kensington Market neighborhood of Toronto. At the end of his life, he held in York and was one of the wealthiest landowners in Canada West. He married four times and fathered thirteen children; he wed Esther Borden Lippincott (daughter of Richard Lippincott) in 1806, Maria Taylor in 1828, Elizabeth Eleanor Caldwell in 1835, and Mary Priscilla Coates in 1850. In 1815, he built an estate named Belle Vue (including an orchard and farm) on the south side of Russell Creek, which followed the style of Georgian architecture. The property on which he built his new home, lot 17 and the eastern portion of lot 18 ran north from present day Queen Street West to Bloor Street, and west from Lippincott Street to Augusta Avenue. Belle Vue (where the Kiever Synagogue now stands across from Denison Square) stood at the head of a mile-long carriage path, which is now Denison Avenue. He served with the British militia in the War of 1812 and, from 1822 to 1837, organized and financed a voluntary cavalry troop, which he commanded during the Rebellions of 1837. The troop later became the Governor General's Horse Guards. In 1846, he was given command of the 4th Battalion of the Toronto militia, a post he held until his death at Toronto in 1853.

Using the Serious Sam series as a test bed for indie development and relations, Devolver worked with developer Vlambeer to release Serious Sam: The Random Encounter in October 2011. Since then, Devolver has gone on to release Hotline Miami with developer Dennaton Games, selling over 2,000,000 copies on Steam (software) alone as of October, 2016. Devolver Digital Films At SXSW 2013, Devolver announced that they would be extending the brand to digital film distribution.

He earned 71 caps and scored 7 goals for the Germany national football team from 1932 to 1942,http://eu-football.info/_player.php?id=9309 and played in two World Cups: 1934 and 1938. Janes was a member of the Breslau Eleven that beat Denmark 8:0 in Breslau in 1937 and went on to win 10 out 11 games played during that year. The DFB list him in the top 20 best German footballers of all time. Career One of the best full backs of his era, Paul Janes established a record for most German caps which wasn‚Äôt broken until 1970. Janes started out as a right half back, but during the 1934 World Cup he debuted as right back and stayed at that position for some 4 seasons before moving back into a sweeper role. He was injured during the 1936 Olympics and thus was spared of the embarrassing defeat of Germany by Norway. During the latter half of the 1930s, Germany possessed one of the strongest full back pairings in European football with Paul Janes on the right and Reinhold M√ºnzenberg on the left side. Vittorio Pozzo, the coach of World Champions Italy, nominated Janes for a 1937 continental selection, but Janes could not participate due to an injury. One of Janes‚Äô best assets was his powerful yet accurate shooting ability, which gave him the nickname \\"World Champion of Precision\\". His trademark were hard shots from all possible angles, his seven goals for Germany all came from either freekicks (4) or penalties (3). He was also a very calm player who kept his cool even in nerve-wrecking situations. Sepp Herberger said about Janes‚Äô characteristics: \\"He rarely was caught off- guard on the pitch, as he had the ability to anticipate what the opponent was planning and he interpreted defensive play always as the first step in building up the next attack.\\"Bitter, J√ºrgen. Deutschlands Fu√üball Nationalspieler, Sportverlag, 1997, p. 219. Despite his calmness and overall cleverness, Janes was renowned for an extravaganza that he had imported from South America: He was the first German footballer to specialize in the acrobatic bicycle kick. During World War II, Janes served in the Kriegsmarine and was able to continue playing, including spells as a wartime guest player with Wilhelmshaven 05 and Fortuna Gl√ºckstadtHamburger Anzeiger, August 19, 1943 \\\\- both from towns with Kriegsmarine ports - as well as Hamburger SV where he played his last league match in November 1944.Pruess/Irle: Tore, Punkte, Spieler. Die komplette HSV-Statistik, G√∂ttingen 2008, p. 82 He captained Germany 31 times. Despite his age of 38, Janes almost would have had a comeback for Germany in the first international game after World War II in 1950, but he broke his foot shortly before and thus had to finish his career for good. Janes was known to be a silent man who didn‚Äôt divulge in too much talking. In 1934, he was asked about what it was like playing in the World Cup in Italy, his response was: \\"Warm\\". His home team was Fortuna D√ºsseldorf, where he worked as trainer after the war. He also coached Eintracht Trier. During his playing career D√ºsseldorf dominated the (topflight) district division through the late 1920s and 1930s, winning the Western German football championship in 1931, the German football championship in 1933 and a German Vice-Championship in 1936. The club also appeared in the final of the Tschammerpokal, predecessor of today's German Cup, in 1937. The Paul-Janes- Stadion in D√ºsseldorf-Flingern is one of the grounds of Fortuna D√ºsseldorf (1930‚Äì1972 and 2002‚Äì2005), named after their famous player. In his 1978 book \\"Fussball\\", Helmut Sch√∂n characterised Janes as follows: \\"A man who could fight but also able to play technically brilliant. He was gifted with a simply phenomenal spin kick; he scored countless goals with freekicks from 30 or 40 meters with his glass-hard shot.\\" References External links *International career *Leverkusen who's who Category:1912 births Category:1987 deaths Category:People from Leverkusen Category:German footballers Category:1934 FIFA World Cup players Category:1938 FIFA World Cup players Category:Germany international footballers Category:Eintracht Frankfurt players Category:Fortuna D√ºsseldorf players Category:German football managers Category:Fortuna D√ºsseldorf managers Category:Association football fullbacks Category:Association football sweepers Category:Footballers from North Rhine- Westphalia ","title":"Paul Janes"},{"id":"7696048","text":"Ballet folklorico Jalisco Ballet Folklorico en Aztlan (BFA) is a Chicano dance company focusing on Mexican folklore, and blending traditional dance with contemporary movements.

Similar claims were made that when returning to Berdychiv the Bolsheviks threw out the sick and wounded from the hospital \\"disregarding the lives and honor of the medical personnel\\" and that in general the Soviet advance into Ukraine was characterized by mass killing of civilians and the burning of entire villages, especially by Budyonny's cossacks, designed to terrorise the Ukrainian population.

Isaac Babel, a war correspondent embedded with the Red Army, in his 1920 diary wrote down many first-hand accounts of atrocities committed by both sides against Jews (Most of them were retreating Red Army in Ukrainian Front).Isaac Babel, 1920 Diary, Yale, 2002, On 5 April 1919 in Pinsk, a Polish officer, after hearing reports that Jewish inhabitants of the city were preparing to riot, panicked and ordered the execution of thirty-five Jews (Pinsk massacre).Joanna Beata Michlic, Poland's Threatening Other: The Image of the Jew from 1880 to the Present, University of Nebraska Press, 2006, Google Print, p.118 Similar hostilities, resulting in fewer casualties, took place in other towns. In Lida soldiers stopped several elderly Jews and cut off their beards with sabres and knives. During the pillage of Lida, Jewish homes were looted and 30 Jews were killed. Violence against Jews caused a major uproar and condemnation in the Polish Parliament. Ignacy Daszy≈Ñski, leader of the Polish Socialist Party called all soldiers that committed acts of violence against the Jewish population \\"hooligans in uniform\\". However, Minister of War General J√≥zef Le≈õniewski, in his written reply to the speaker of Parliament, defended anti- Jewish violence by Polish units in Lida, referring to Jews as a Communist- minded community and stating that the Polish Army had the right to kill their adversaries. The ordeal of Jewish victims at the hands of the Poles could not be equated with the massacres committed by Denikin's troops.Howard M. Sachar. (2007). Dreamland: Europeans and Jews in the Aftermath of the Great War, Random House LLC: page 25. \\"The number of Jews actually slain at the hand of Poles did not exceed 400 or 500‚Ä¶ an expatriate force of American Poles doubled the number of casualties suffered by Jews\\" However, reports of these incidents caused the United States to send a commission led by Henry Morgenthau, Sr. and Sir Stuart M. Samuel to investigate. According to the findings of this Anglo- American Investigating Commission, a total of about 300 Jews lost their lives in all incidents involving Poles. The commission also found that the Polish military and civil authorities did their best to prevent such incidents and their recurrence in the future. The Morgenthau report stated that some forms of discrimination against Jews was of political rather than anti-Semitic nature and specifically avoided use of the term \\"pogrom,\\" noting that the term was used to apply to a wide range of excesses, and had no specific definition.Andrzej Kapiszewski, Controversial Reports on the Situation of the Jews in Poland in the Aftermath of World War Studia Judaica 7: 2004 nr 2(14) s. 257‚Äì304 (pdf) Sociologist Tadeusz Piotrowski noted that the Morgenthau Report admitted that the word \\"pogrom\\" was inapplicable to the conditions existing within a war zone. Richard C. Lukas argues that in some places, Jews had made themselves vulnerable by collaborating with Poland's Lithuanian and Soviet enemies. Property destruction Both sides in the conflict raised complaints about property destruction in diplomatic notes addressed to the Entente. One note raised by the Soviet side stated that during the Soviet advance the retreating Poles engaged in \\"vengeful vandalism\\", as in Borisov where the Poles, following their retreat, shelled the city with artillery from the opposite bank of the Berezina River \\"killing hundreds of people and leaving thousands without shelter.\\" Another joint diplomatic note issued by Soviet Ukraine and Soviet Russia to the Entente blamed the Poles for heavily damaging Kiev, including its civilian infrastructure and art, such as St Volodymyr's Cathedral, a charge the Poles denied, admitting only to the destruction of the Kiev bridges, in order to slow down the Red Army. That particular note seems to be based on a telegram by Leon Trotsky, who later admitted that the information he received on St Volodymyr's Cathedral was incorrect.Postal Telegram No. 2886-a, footnote 1.

Tadeusz Krzakoski (Krzysztof Kowalewski), the director of a failing state-owned company, is married with problems. His mistress, the daughter of a Communist party bigwig, says she's pregnant and Tadeusz knows he'll have to marry her to save his reputation and his job. But divorce is never simple and Bareja's screwball comedies are never boring. What Will You Do shares many themes in common with Bareja's other comedies, especially Teddy Bear, with an emphasis on the sheer absurdity of life under Communism. The plot is too convoluted to be believed, but the director makes screamingly funny scenes from watching hapless citizens of Warsaw using a glass in a cafeteria that's been chained to the table so it won't be stolen or waiting in line for days to buy furniture.

Plot summary The story begins as the narrator, one of two survivors stranded in the belly of a whale, explains to his companion how their lives were interwoven. The narrator details how, when he was three, his widowed mother was charmed by and took in a man ‚Äî then an eighteen-year-old \\"rake and...roustabout\\" ‚Äî charming at first but later revealed as a gambler and womanizer. The rake then disappeared, leaving the narrator's mother to die of tuberculosis in penury after their home was seized to pay off the debts the man left behind. On her deathbed, she instructs the boy to avenge her death, telling him: > Find him, bind him, tie him to a pole and break his fingers to splinters. > Drag him to a hole until he wakes up, naked, clawing at the ceiling of his > grave. Fifteen years later, having found work cleaning a priory, the narrator hears of a cruel whaler captain who matches the rake's description; he joins a privateer ship to hunt him down. After 20 months at sea, the privateer crew spots the whaling ship, but a giant whale attacks both ships before they are able to board. Everyone is killed except the narrator and the rake. The narrator then tells the man who ruined his mother's life that it must have been by \\"providence\\" that only they survived, and cautions him to listen closely to \\"the last words [he] will hear\\". Though the lyrics end here, the musical theme representing the mother's instructions is repeated several times in escalating tempo, implying the culmination of the narrator's pyrrhic victory. Performance history \\"The Mariner's Revenge Song\\" has been one of the Decemberists' most popular at live performances. It had been played at virtually every live show as an encore since its release until the 2006 tour. At this point, the band swore off playing it at nearly all of the shows, saying that they were giving it a break for a while. When played live, the song utilizes a characteristic variety of instruments, with Chris Funk on mandolin, Nate Query on stand-up bass and bowed bass, Colin Meloy on vocals and guitar, John Moen on floor tom, and Jenny Conlee on accordion. The band usually brings out a large whale prop, encouraging the audience to \\"scream like you're being swallowed by a whale\\" during the part of the song when the whale attacks the ships. On March 21, during their \\"Twilight in the Fearful Forest Tour 2007\\" at The Landmark Lowes Theater in Jersey City, New Jersey, the song was \\"revived\\" and brought back from retirement as the last song played in the regular set. Colin Meloy said that they were playing it for all the people who never experienced the song live. The band continued to play it throughout the tour, and has continued to play it regularly. Recording The band has stated that the song was recorded in one take around a single microphone. The various band members stepped towards the mic and back to control the audio level of their instrument. Drummer Rachel Blumberg had to stand much farther away because of the relative loudness of the drums. The song, and most of the album, was recorded between August‚ÄìSeptember 2004 at an old church in the Decemberists' home town (Prescott Church, Portland).

In 1117, Fulk and Guy subscribed the privilege in which Manasses founded a monastery dedicated to Saint Leonard in the suburbs of Gu√Ænes.

They are generally found in Asia (Indomalayan realm). Collectors have found the red-bodied swallowtails difficult to kill. Pinching the thorax, a method which kills most butterflies, is withstood and apparently only stuns the butterfly temporarily. Life history The eggs are simple. The larvae resemble those of other Troidini. Fleshy spine-like tubercles, often with red tips, line the caterpillars' backs, and their bodies are dark red to brown and velvety black or shades of grey with a pattern of black lines. They feed on species of Aristolochia and Thottea. Chrysalids are camouflaged to look like a dead leaf or twig. They are attached by a girdle and an anal pad. Adults are nectar feeding. Many species of red-bodied swallowtails show aposematism, and serve as models for Batesian mimicry. The biology of Pachliopta hector and Pachliopta aristolochiae are well studied.

The bog contains a large variety of plants, including insect eating plants, tamarack trees, stands of blueberry bushes, and floating mats of sphagnum moss. Pinhook Bog is about , a quarter of which is a floating mat of sphagnum peat moss. A \\"moat\\" separates the bog from the uplands. Geology The bog is a glacial kettle. At the end of the Wisconsin Glacial epoch about 14,000 to 15,000 years ago, a large chunk of ice remained buried at this location as the ice retreated northward. When the ice melted, the clay soil sealed the basins.Indiana Dunes Education, National Park Service, Porter, Indiana, 2006 Precipitation and runoff from higher ground around the bog are the only water sources. There is no stream or groundwater inflow or outflow. Evaporation from the open water and plants is the only loss of moisture. A bog differs from swamps, marshes, and ponds because of this limited exchange of water. The water in the bog is stagnant, acidic, and nutrient-poor.1997, Bud Polk Plants Part of the floating mat of vegatation. The outstanding feature of Pinhook Bog is the tree-covered mat of sphagnum moss. Sphagnum moss is a stringy, delicate moss of a light-green color. The mat floats on top of the water and can become thick, yet it can have a pocket only a few inches thick in the middle. As the mat thickens, larger and larger plants take root and grow. Under the mat a peat bed develops. The acidic water slows the decay of the sphagnum moss and other plants. With time, the peat may fill the bog from the mat to the bottom. As the moisture becomes less acidic, typical land plants take root and the bog disappears. Orchids: *Pink lady's slipper, stemless lady's-slipper, or moccasin flower (Cypripedium acaule) is pink, deep rose, to white color flower. It is the only lady's slipper with no stem leaves. The plant can grow high. *Yellow fringed orchid, yellow-fringed orchis, or orange-fringed orchid (Platanthera ciliaris) is a fairly tall orchid with a flower cluster that can be tall and the entire plant about tall. The flowers can be yellow to orange. *Rose pogonia or snake mouth orchid (Pogonia ophioglossoides) is a small pink orchid found in the bog near the end of the boardwalk. The orchid is about tall and the flower about long.

It usually goes unnoticed by rangers and visitors because its leaves are so small and instead is recognized by its flower. *Hidden-fruited bladderwort (Utricularia geminiscapa) is a small aquatic carnivorous plant that possesses bladder-shaped traps that feed on small aquatic insects. Poison sumac is prevalent in the bog area, particularly around the outer edge, the '\\"moat\\". It is recognized by its compound leaves of seven to thirteen leaflets. The leaflets have smooth edges and are pointed.Daniel, pg 119 Tamarack or American larch is an unusual tree for northwest Indiana. It is a conifer, but not an evergreen.

From the parking lot off Wozniak Road, a leisurely trail of about 1/2 mile leads you through the woods to the entrance to the bog, which is gated and locked during non-tour hours. Within the bog, you can walk along a plastic boardwalk which is about 1/4 mile long. You are not allowed to step on the bog as it damages the fragile ecosystem. Make sure to pay close attention to the carnivorous plants on the bog surface near the entrance - some are quite small and delicate and can be easy to miss.

It is named for Dr. Henry Chandler Cowles who did his pioneering work in ecology and ecological succession here. His work brought international attention to the area which led to efforts to preserve the Indiana Dunes. It was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1965. It contains bog, fen, marsh, wet meadow, swamp, and pond habitats. Preservation Dr Cowles had been writing papers on plant succession for several years based on research he did in the area before he was part of the 1913 International Phytogeographical Excursion which brought other international scientists to the site. Dorothy Buell founded the Save the Dunes Council which led to the purchase of the wetland complex.Smith, S. & Mark, S. (2009). The Historical Roots of the Nature Conservancy in the Northwest Indiana/Chicagoland Region: From Science to Preservation. The South Shore Journal, 3. Smith, S. & Mark, S. (2006). Alice Gray, Dorothy Buell, and Naomi Svihla: Preservationists of Ogden Dunes. The South Shore Journal, 1. Location The wetland is located west of Mineral Springs Road. The general area is accessible by the Cowles Bog Trail of Indiana Dunes National Park. Parking is available at the trailhead, just before the guardhouse to Dune Acres. The trail does not lead into the bog, which is nearly inaccessible due to the nature of the plant life surrounding it. Dr. Cowles work included the bog and the marshlands to the south of the trail and the dune slopes to the north of the trail. Cowles Bog is drained by the West Branch Tributary of Dunes Creek to Lake Michigan. Soils Cowles Bog is considered a wetland complex, rather than a 'true' bog such as Pinhook Bog, also a part of the Indiana Dunes National Park. The main body of the bog is composed of muck created from marsh plants and the woody plants that have encroached into the area. Surrounding the bog proper is an area covered with a thin layer of leaf litter over a thin layer of topsoil. The area is moderately acidic. Wet depressions exist which reveal a substratum of Maumee soils, a loamy fine sand. These loamy sands extend southward through the marsh area. To the north the dunes consist of Plainfield fine sand, which is heavily oxidized. Vegetation The bog is a wetland woods. In the 1960s, there was still a noticeable open bog. This has effectively closed. The woods is dominated by Red maple and Yellow birch. There are tamarack, Paper birch, and White pine, which together only reach numbers equal to the Red maple and Yellow birch separately. Immature trees exist in all the lower layers of the woods with the Red maple and Yellow birch still dominating. The Shrub layer is along the bog's edge and fills the center area of the bog. Dominant here are spicebush and poison sumac. The predominance of poison sumac makes access to the bog very difficult. Additionally, there are quantities of witch hazel, red osier, grape and blackberry. At ground level, the herb layer includes columbine, boneset, jewel weed, nettle, twinberry, May apple, hispid greenbrier, meadow rue, narrow-leaved cattail and grape. Orchids are becoming increasingly more common as restoration work has been going on putting orchids back in their natural habitat. Purple pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea), while once common, has been poached from the area and no longer occurs. Wildlife The wetland complex primarily supports insect and bird life. Beavers have been known to inhabit the surrounding wetlands in 1988. White Tail Deer are present also. Restoration Since the early 1900s, when Dr. Cowles studied the 'bog', the land has been changing. The once diverse sedge meadow had been replaced by a monoculture of hybrid cattails. The National Park Service has identified that the changes which have caused this include: changes in seasonal water levels, water chemistry, changes in plant density, and changes in the soil and the seed banks. These changes have been the result of changes in the surrounding area, including the construction or roads and of drainage ditches. In 2009, the national lakeshore received a 3-year grant to begin the restoration of the wetlands.The Singing Sands; Vol. 30, NO. 2, Fall 2009; National Park Service, Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore; Porter, Indiana Cowles Bog Trail The trail takes you along the northern edge of 'Cowles Bog'. The trail consist of three loops beginning at the Cowles Bog Trailhead parking area.Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore; Cowles Bog Trail, National Park Service Lake Michigan can be reached on this trail in only by using the most direct route. *The southern loop is long around the bog, with a return trip of about along Mineral Springs Road. *The middle loop is and takes you into the dunes ridges and interdunal wetlands. It requires that you use the southern loop to get to and from it. *The northern loop is connected to the middle loop and is long, crossing the foredunes and reaching Lake Michigan.

He was a pupil of Jacob Sefardi (the Spaniard), who instructed him in the Kabbala. Moses studied medicine and philosophy; the latter, he regarded as a divine science which teaches the same doctrines as the Cabala, using a different language and different terms to designate the same objects. He extolled Aristotle as a sage, applying to him the Talmudic sentence, \\"A wise man is better than a prophet,\\" and he censured his contemporaries for keeping aloof from the divine teachings of philosophy. He believed in the efficacy of amulets and cameos, and declared that he was able to combine the names of God for magical purposes, so that he was generally considered a sorcerer. He stated that by means of fasting, ablution, and invocation of the names of God and of the angels prophetic dreams could be induced. He also stated that the prophet Elijah had appeared to him and appointed him as Messiah. In this role he addressed a circular letter to all the rabbis, asserting that he was able to solve all perplexities, and asking them to send all doubtful questions to him. In this letter (printed by Dukes in Orient, Lit. 1850, p. 825) Botarel refers to himself as a well-known and prominent rabbi, a saint, and the most pious of the pious. Many believed in his miracles, including the philosopher Hasdai Crescas. Botarel was one of those who attended the disputation at Tortosa (1413‚Äì1414), and he is said to have written a polemic against Geronimo de Santa Fe. In 1409, at the request of the Christian scholar Maestro Juan, Botarel composed a commentary on the Sefer Yezirah. In the preface, he excuses himself for having revealed the divine mysteries of this work to Maestro Juan by quoting the saying of the sages that a non-Jew who studies the Torah is equal to a high priest. In his commentary, he quotes earlier cabalistic works, including some ascribed to the old authorities, such as the amora Rav Ashi. Botarel's commentary on the Sefer Ye·∫ìirah was printed at Mantua in 1562, with the text and with other commentaries; it was republished at Zolkiev, 1745; Grodno, 1806; and Wilna, 1820. This Moses Botarel is not Moses ben Leon Botarel, who lived at Constantinople in the 16th century and wrote the En Mishpat, containing predictions and being a free paraphrase of a Latin work of Michael Nostradamus.

After a competition between the Boeing X-32 and the Lockheed Martin X-35, a final design was chosen based on the X-35. This is the F-35 Lightning II, which will replace various tactical aircraft, including the US F-16, A-10, F/A-18A-D, AV-8B and British Harrier GR7, GR9s, and Tornado GR4. The projected average annual cost of this program is $12.5 billion with an estimated program life-cycle cost of $1.1 trillion.

The CALF was a DARPA program to develop a STOVL strike fighter (SSF) for the United States Marine Corps and replacement for the F-16 Fighting Falcon. The United States Air Force passed over the F-16 Agile Falcon in the late 1980s, essentially an enlarged F-16, and continued to mull other designs. In 1992, the Marine Corps and Air Force agreed to jointly develop the Common Affordable Lightweight Fighter, also known as Advanced Short Takeoff and Vertical Landing (ASTOVL).

The JAST program office was established on 27 January 1994 to develop aircraft, weapons, and sensor technology with the aim of replacing several disparate US and UK aircraft with a single family of aircraft; the majority of those produced would replace F-16s.

They proposed an aircraft powered by a reheated turbofan that could be reconfigured (in the STOVL mode) into a direct lift engine with a pair of thrust-vectoring nozzles located near the aircraft centre-of-gravity. This led to the F119-PW-614S which powered the X-32B JSF demonstrator. Two contracts to develop prototypes were awarded on November 16, 1996, one each to Lockheed Martin and Boeing. Each firm would produce two aircraft to demonstrate conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL), carrier takeoff and landing (CV version), and short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL). McDonnell Douglas' bid was rejected in part due to the complexity of its design. Lockheed Martin and Boeing were each given $750 million to develop their concept demonstrators and the definition of the Preferred Weapon System Concept (PWSC). The aim of this funding limit was to prevent one or both contractors from bankrupting themselves in an effort to win such an important contract. Also in 1996, the UK Ministry of Defence launched the Future Carrier Borne Aircraft project. This program sought a replacement for the Sea Harrier (and later the Harrier GR7); the Joint Strike Fighter was selected in January 2001. During concept definition, two Lockheed Martin airplanes were flight-tested: the X-35A (which was later converted into the X-35B), and the larger-winged X-35C.Joint Strike Fighter official site ‚Äì History page Arguably the most persuasive demonstration of the X-35's capability was the final qualifying Joint Strike Fighter flight trials, in which the X-35B STOVL aircraft took off in less than 500 feet (150 m), went supersonic, and landed vertically ‚Äì a feat that Boeing's entry was unable to achieve.PBS: Nova transcript \\"X-planes\\" = Outcome = The contract for System Development and Demonstration (SDD) was awarded on 26 October 2001 to Lockheed Martin,Bolkcom, Christopher.

One of the main reasons for this choice appears to have been the method of achieving STOVL flight, with the Department of Defense judging that the higher performance lift fan system was worth the extra risk. When near to the ground, the Boeing X-32 suffered from the problem of hot air from the exhaust circulating back to the main engine, which caused the thrust to weaken and the engine to overheat. The United States Department of Defense officials and William Bach, the UK Minister of Defence Procurement, said the X-35 consistently outperformed the X-32, although both met or exceeded requirements. The development of the JSF was jointly funded by the United States, United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands, Canada, Turkey, Australia, Norway and Denmark. In July 2019 United States removed Turkey from the Joint Strike Fighter program, following the country's acquisition of the Russian S-400 missile system. Turkey had planned to buy 100 F-35 Lightning II jets. (BBC) Lockheed Martin's X-35 would become the basis of the F-35 Lightning II, currently in production. On April 6, 2009 US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates announced that the US would buy a total of 2,443 JSFs.Gates, Dominic, \\"Aerospace Giant 'Hit Harder' Than Peers\\", Seattle Times, April 7, 2009, p. 1. Program issues =Alleged Chinese espionage= In April 2009, the Wall Street Journal reported that computer spies, allegedly Chinese but acknowledged to be from uncertain sources, had penetrated the database and acquired terabytes of secret information about the fighter, possibly compromising its future effectiveness. The state-run Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) later incorporated the stolen data into China‚Äôs Chengdu J-20 and Shenyang FC-31 fighters. =Cost overruns= On February 1, 2010, Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates announced that, due to delays and other problems with the JSF development program, he was removing Major General David R. Heinz from command of the program and would withhold $614 million in bonuses from Lockheed Martin.Whitlock, Craig, \\"Gates To Major General: You're Fired\\", Washington Post, February 2, 2010, p. 4. On February 16, 2010, Deputy Defense Secretary Bill Lynn announced that the program will be delayed one year.Reed, John, \\"Pentagon Official Confirms 1-Year Delay For JSF\\", DefenseNews.com, February 16, 2010. According to some estimates, overruns could increase the program's total costs to $388 billion, a 50% increase from the initial price tag.Shachtman, Noah. \\"The Air Force Needs a Serious Upgrade\\" , The Brookings Institution, 15 July 2010. Many of the program's financial and technical complications result from the Marine version of the JSF, capable of vertical take-offs and landings. On 11 March 2010, United States Senate Committee on Armed Services investigated the progress of the JSF program in a meeting with Pentagon officials, emphasizing cost due to the risk of a Nunn-McCurdy process.JSF faces US Senate grilling, australianaviation.com.au 12 March 2010. According to the Government Accountability Office, F-35A cost has risen from $50m in 2002, via $69m in 2007 to $74m in 2010, all measured in 2002 dollars. Canada reviewed their commitment to the project in December 2012, due to the cost overruns. The decision was made following a report by auditing firm KPMG that showed that Canada‚Äôs purchase would cost C$45bn over 42 years. Rona Ambrose, Canada‚Äôs public works minister said: ‚ÄúWe have hit the reset button and are taking the time to do a complete assessment of all available aircraft.‚Äù Defence Minister Peter MacKay announced Canada‚Äôs plan to buy the F-35 in 2010 saying that the purchase price was $9 billion, but did not provide operating cost estimates. During an election campaign in 2011, the Conservatives declared that the total cost over 20 years would be $16 billion. =Performance concerns= Concerns about the F-35's performance have resulted partially from reports of simulations by RAND Corporation in which three regiments of Chinese Sukhoi Su-27 fighters defeat six F-22s by denying tanker refueling.Trimble, Stephen. \\"US defence policy ‚Äì and F-35 ‚Äì under attack.\\" Flight International, Reed Business Information, 15 October 2008. As a result of these media reports, then Australian defence minister Joel Fitzgibbon requested a formal briefing from the Australian Department of Defence on the simulation. This briefing stated that the reports of the simulation were inaccurate and that it did not compare the F-35's performance against that of other aircraft.\\"Fighter criticism 'unfair' and 'misrepresented'.\\" ABC News, 25 September 2008.

The genus was originally treated as a subgenus from the genus Marmosa rather than having their own classification. This was changed in 1989 by Gardner and Crieghton, who officially separated the group and made them their own genus. The mix-up between to genera Marmosa and Marmosops was common due to the similar appearances including size and other external features. However, the two groups differ significantly in their integument and in the arrangement of their skull and dentition. Voss, R.S., Tarifa, T., and E. Yensen. 2004. An Introduction to Marmosops (Marsupialia: Didelphidae), with the Description of a New Species from Bolivia and Notes on the Taxonomy and Distribution of Other Bolivian Forms. American Museum of Natural History. 3466:2-34. The dentition is similar in morphology between the two groups, with the exception of the deciduous lower third premolar varying from one genus to the next. The similarity between the two continues to cause the genus Marmosops to be frequently misidentified due to the lack of knowledge regarding the species along with the overlooked traits that help separate them from other opossums. The Marmosops are also commonly confused with the genus Gracilinanus, but this is quickly ruled out by a large number of differing characteristics. These differences include the arrangement of their digits, caudal (anatomical term) scales, and the central hair on the scales changing from a three hairs per follicle to many more. This causes the hair of the Gracilinanus to be thicker and has also found to be heavily pigmented. The last group commonly confused with Marmosops is known as the genus Thylamys. These animals have a contrasting dorsal body pelage and the taxa are actually quite different. Taxonomy The genus Marmosops includes the following species: * M. bishopi (Bishop's slender opossum') * M. cracens (Narrow-headed slender opossum) * M. creightoni (Creighton's slender opossum) * M. dorothea (Dorothy's slender opossum) * M. fuscatus (Dusky slender opossum) * M. handleyi (Handley's slender opossum) * M. impavidus (Tschudi's slender opossum) * M. incanus (Gray slender opossum) * M. invictus (Panama slender opossum) * M. juninensis (Junin slender opossum) * M. neblina (Neblina slender opossum) * M. noctivagus (White-bellied slender opossum) * M. ocellatus (Spectacled slender opossum) * M. parvidens (Delicate slender opossum) * M. paulensis (Brazilian slender opossum) * M. pinheiroi (Pinheiro's slender opossum) General traits The Marmosops tend to be nocturnal, small marsupials and have been found to live on the ground. Many females of the M. paulensis species are known to be extremely territorial with a strong defense of their food, especially while in the presence of their young.Leiner, N.O. and W.R. Silva. 2009. Territoriality in females of the slender opossum (Marmosops paulensis) in the Atlantic forest of Brazil. Journal of Tropic Ecology. 25:671-675. The genus Marmosops is frequently misidentified and lumped into groups containing other species.Diaz-N, J.F. 2012. New Records of Marmosops noctivagus (Tschudi, 1845) (Didelphimorpia: Didelphidae) and first record of Marmosops bishop (Pine, 1981) for Colombia. Check List: Journal of Species lists and Distribution. 8:805-809. As of today, Marmosops are currently recognized as a distinct taxon with 36 taxa: 14 valid species and 22 subspecies. The species within the genus differ slightly, but not enough to be classified as separate genera. Some of the species are also nicknamed by appearance, with the M. paulensis known as the slender opossum, the M. noctivagus recognized as the largest species and the M. bishopi the smallest of the genus.Hice, C.L. 2003. The non-volant mammals of the estacion biologica allpahuayo: Assessment of the natural history and community ecology of a proposed reserve. Texas Tech University. 69-75. Habitat The main habitat for the Marmosops is found between the Neotropical humid forests ranging from Panama to the South of Brazil and sometimes in Bolivia as well. The Marmosops prefer to live on the grounds of forests, staying away from high branches of trees. They often hide in the dense understory with high plant coverage surrounding them. They are highly influenced by rain and predation, with migration occurring more often during certain seasons.Leiner, N.O., Dickman, C.R., and W.R. Silva. 2010. Multiscale habitat selection by slender opossums (Marmosops spp.) in the Atlantic forest of Brazil. Journal of Mammalogy. 91:561-565. The genus is never found to live up in a canopy (biology) or in the trees, but instead typically prefer more accessible habitats where it is easier to hide. There is not much known regarding the habitat of the genus due to their migration patterns and unique preferences. Diet The diet of Marmosops includes, but is not limited to fruit, arthropods, flowers and small vertebrates.Leiner, N.O. and W.R. Silva. 2007. Effects of resource availability on the use of space by the mouse opossum Marmosops paulensis (Didelphidae) in a montane Atlantic forest area in southeastern Brazil. Acta Theriologica. 52:197-204 They also will eat insects, arachnids, and gastropods depending on the species and time of the year. Their diet seems to change with the seasons, with more diversity in food preference shown in the drier seasons. Each species has a slightly different diet depending on their habitat and what is available in that area.Leiner, N.O. and W.R. Silva. 2007. Seasonal Variation in the diet of Brazilian slender opossum (Marmosops paulensis) in a montane atlantic forest area, southeastern Brazil. Journal of Mammalogy. 88:158-164. Reproduction Most of the Marmosops carry their offspring in utero and feed them through the process of lactation. There is a high reproduction rate in the months of September through March for M. paulensis, with more mating occurring when there is a larger food supply. For this species, death occurred after every mating event was completed. This ensured that there was no more than one mating event for each animal that reproduced.N.O. Leiner, E.Z.F. Setz, and W.R. Silva. 2008. Semelparity and factors affecting the reproductive activity of the Brazilian slender opossum (Marmosops paulensis) in southeastern Brazil. Journal of Mammalogy. 89:153-158. Successful breeding depends on the presence of females, and many may have multiple mating partners in order to produce more offspring if they do not die after one event. The M. paulensis species have higher breeding rates when the length of day is longer and there is more fruit available to eat. Semelparity also was found to occur in this species, but is hypothesized to occur only due to phylogenic constraints. It seems as though there is synchrony of the females for the species due to swollen nipples around the time of breeding. The M. incanus have also been found to exhibit semelparity with a distinct breeding season between the months of October through December. For the breeding season, it is more beneficial for the females to be larger in order to produce larger litters, yielding higher breeding success over the smaller sized females. When looking at milk production and food supply for the genus, there was a strong correlation found between the two as well. In times where there was more food, there was more milk produced by the females. As far as the males, they seem to generally disappear after the mating event while the females remain in the area until their young are done weaning. This pattern leads to the generations being replaced every breeding season due to mortality of the adults. Overall, there is not much known about the reproductive patterns of the other species due to the little knowledge collected on the genus as a whole. There is a lack of pouch. Species- specific information The Marmosops noctivagus species have been involved in a big debate on which Genus they belong to. One study found them located in Columbia, which was previously an unknown location as far as Marmosops are concerned. They were identified by the chestnut brown hair on their back and white hair on their ventral side along with black facial features. They also have long tails with two different colors. The M. noctivagus also has a skull with a long nose and cranial openings between the squamosal and parietal bones. This is present in some of the animals and absent in others. The cranial openings under the squamosal bones, also known as fenestra (anatomy), are small and rounded. The dental arrangement for the species consists of large canine teeth but lack accessory cusps, correlating with the age and sex of the animal. These teeth are significantly smaller in the females. The Marmosops bishopi are another species of the genus Marmosops found in the western Brazilian Amazon rainforest and other areas of Peru and Bolivia. Marmosops incanus are another species in the genus that have a mask made of black fur around their eyes. Some other distinguishing characteristics include the third digit being longer than the second and the fourth along with an extremely long tail. They do not have a fenestra on the maxilla, but the fenestra cochlea is exposed The Marmosops creightoni is a species that is medium in size with a coat that is almost completely dark with no clear distinction between the dorsal and ventral sides. This is the only species of the genus without the white markings on the underside. The chin fur is white and continues down to the throat along with a black mask around the eyes. The skull consists of small orbits with long nasal bones and the infraorbital foramen is very large. This species has a fenestra between the maxilla and palatine bone, which are both long and narrow on each side. The palatine fenestra are rather small in size. The M. handleyi is one last species with very little known about it. However, rather recently there has been new information uncovered. The species is characterized by its woody dorsal fur, gray ventral fur and a rounded palatine fenestra. They are intermediately sized compared to the rest of the genus and have dark black facial masks. They were found to lack throat glands as well. They have white or light gray ears and the females are unique due to the odd rusty-red color of their mammary area with seven nipples located on the abdominal region.Diaz-N., J.F., Gomez‚ÄôLaverde, M. and C.S.

Closing Declining student enrollment in the San Mateo Union High School District prompted the school board to consider closing a school in the fall of 1980. The final choice came down to Burlingame High School or Crestmoor. In the vote, the board decided to close Crestmoor despite Crestmoor's having a larger enrollment than Burlingame and being a newer facility with lower operating and maintenance costs than several district schools. The 1,500-student facility was closed in 1980, relieving the school district of construction debt. Some of the buildings were later used for a continuation high school, Peninsula High School (San Bruno). The San Mateo Union High School District board decided that sale of the campus would help alleviate a major financial shortfall.

Biography  Born in Elizabeth, New Jersey on July 31, 1954, Justice Hoens graduated in 1972 from Columbia High School in Maplewood and was inducted into the school's hall of fame in 2010.Hall of Fame , Columbia High School. Accessed November 12, 2018. She holds a B.A. in government from the College of William and Mary, graduating with high honors, and a J.D. from Georgetown University Law Center. While at Georgetown, she served on the Georgetown Law Journal, first as a member of the staff and then as the editor of the journal‚Äôs annual volume devoted to developments in criminal procedure in the federal circuit courts.  Career  Upon graduation, she served as a law clerk to Judge John Joseph Gibbons during his service on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit before embarking on a career in private practice. After her clerkship, Justice Hoens worked in private practice, first at Dewey Ballantine and with the Law Office of Russel H. Beatie, Jr. in New York. She moved to New Jersey to practice with Pitney, Harden and later with Lum, Hoens, Conant Danzis & Kleinberg, where her father, Charles H. Hoens Jr., was a founding partner. Justice Hoens was appointed to the Superior Court in 1994 by Governor Christine Todd Whitman, and reappointed by Governor Donald DiFrancesco in 2001. She was elevated to the Appellate Division in August, 2002 by Chief Justice Deborah T. Poritz. In 2006 she was appointed to fill the anticipated vacancy on the Supreme Court left by the elevation of then-Associate Justice James R. Zazzali to replace Poritz as Chief Justice. On August 12, 2013, Governor Chris Christie announced that he would not renominate Justice Helen Hoens for lifetime appointment to the state's Supreme Court. She is the second Justice of the Supreme Court to be denied tenure in more than 66 years since the adoption of the 1947 State Constitution. Her non-reappointment is a result of the impasse between Republican Governor Chris Christie and the Democratic State Senate over the Supreme Court appointments. Christie said he wished to spare Hoens a Senate hearing in which she would be denied reappointment.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-08-12/christie-won-t- renominate-n-j-supreme-court-justice-hoens-1-.html Hoens is identified as a Republican, as is Gov.

Description There are a few distinct morphological characteristics that distinguish Gonyosoma from Elaphe. In scutellation there are 2-3 supralabials that contact the eye, with typically two in G. oxycephalum, and three in G. jansenii. The supralabial at the posterior of the eye is highly arched around the back of the eye. The loreal scale is thin and elongate, and appears stretched between the preocular and the nasal. Other diagnostic features is an elongate left rudimentary lung (70‚Äì141 mm), and a distinct hemipenes structure.Schulz, Klaus-Dieter. 1996. A Monograph of the Colubrid Snakes of the Genus Elaphe Fitzinger. Havlickuv Brod, Czech Republic: Koeltz Scientific Books. 439 pp. . Behavior These snakes have the ability to laterally compress and inflate the first third of their bodies when threatened. The inflated region is typically recoiled into an S, which is elevated above the horizontal forming a typical striking position. The inflation of the body exposes the black and white diagonal bands of the interstitial skin, which is particularly distinct in G. oxycephalum (Schulz 1996). In combination these adaptations impose a most ominous threat! Species The following six species are recognized as being valid.\\"Gonyosoma \\".

It launched from Nagashima, Japan on November 10, 1981, and landed in Mendocino National Forest in California 84 hours and 31 minutes later, travelling a record . The four-man crew consisted of Albuquerque balloonists Ben Abruzzo, Larry Newman, and Ron Clark, and thrill-seeking restaurateur Rocky Aoki, who helped fund the flight. The helium-filled Double Eagle V spent four days crossing the Pacific before the balloon, weighed down by ice and buffeted by a storm, crash-landed in northern California, ending the nearly 6,000-mile flight. No one was hurt. Abruzzo and Newman had previously been two of the pilots of Double Eagle II, which in 1978 became the first balloon to cross the Atlantic. Double Eagle V failed to attract the same degree of media attention as the earlier flight, in part because it was overshadowed by the concurrent Space Shuttle mission STS-2.

As a result of this relationship, he was twice ordinary consul, an unusual and prestigious honor: first in 99, with Aulus Cornelius Palma Frontonianus as his colleague; and again in 107 as the colleague of Lucius Licinius Sura, who was himself consul for the third time.  Career  Senecio's origins are unknown. He has been identified as the subject of an inscription where the name of the subject is lost, which provides us his cursus honorum.C. P. Jones, \\"Sura and Senecio\\", Journal of Roman Studies, 60 (1970), pp. 98-104 The earliest office recorded on this inscription was quattuorviri viarum curandarum, one of the four boards that comprised the vigintiviri; membership in one of these was a required first step toward a gaining entry into the Roman Senate. His next recorded office was as quaestor of the public province of Achaea; upon completion of this traditional Republican magistracy he would be enrolled in the Senate.Richard Talbert, The Senate of Imperial Rome (Princeton: University Press, 1984), p. 16 The inscription omits all mention of a term of service as military tribune; John D. Grainger speculates that Senecio may have served with Legio XXI Rapax, which was destroyed by the Iazyges in 92.Grainger, Nerva and the Roman Succession Crisis of AD 96-99 (London: Routledge, 2004), p. 121 He was the emperor's candidate for plebeian tribune and praetor, a clear honor; that the emperor's name is not provided suggests he was Domitian, who suffered damnatio memoriae after his death. After achieving the rank of praetor, Senecio was commissioned legatus or commander of Legio I Minervia. He was then governor of Gallia Belgica for the term 96 to 98.Werner Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten der senatorischen Statthalter von 69/70 bis 138/139\\", Chiron, 12 (1982), pp. 328-330 It was while governor that Senecio provided early support to Trajan. Senecio became consul ordinarius in 99. During the Dacian Wars, he held the governorship of Moesia Superior.Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten\\", pp. 336-340 Afterwards he earned a second consulate in 107 as well as a statue at state expense.  Personal details  Senecio was a member of literary circles. Pliny the Younger addressed two letters to a \\"Senecio\\" who is commonly identified with him. The first, beginning with \\"This year has produced a healthy crop of poets\\", is on the health of contemporary Roman literature.Epistulae I.13 The second is a request for a commission as military tribune on behalf of the relative of Pliny's friend Calvisius Rufus.Epistulae IV.4 Plutarch also dedicated several of his Parallel Lives (Theseus 1, Demosthenes 1, Brutus 1) as well some of the individual Moralia (Quaestiones conviviales and Quomodo quis suos in virtute sentiat profectus) to Senecio. These include reminiscences about Plutarch's and Senecio's conversations at Athens, Patras and Rome, as well as at Plutarch's home in Boeotia, where Senecio attended the wedding of Plutarch‚Äôs son.Anthony R.

Lawson at Sai Wan War Cemetery John Kelburne Lawson (27 December 1886 ‚Äì 19 December 1941) was a Canadian military officer who served as commander of the West Brigade during the Battle of Hong Kong. A brigadier, he was the most senior officer to be killed in action during the battle, and the highest-ranking Canadian soldier killed in action in the Second World War.  Early career  Lawson was born in Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire. He emigrated to Edmonton in 1914 where he worked as a clerk for the Hudson's Bay Company. He enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF) upon the outbreak of the First World War. He joined the 9th Battalion, CEF, and variously worked at the 1st Canadian Motor Machine Gun Brigade and at Corps Headquarters. Although he is often incorrectly attributed a Military Cross for actions at the Battle of Passchendaele or the Battle of the Somme, he was twice mentioned in despatches and received the French Croix de guerre. Lawson joined as a private in 1914 and rose to the rank of warrant officer first class before commissioning. He held the rank of captain at the end of the war. Lawson joined the Permanent Active Militia during the interwar years. He held various positions in Calgary, Kingston, Toronto, and Ottawa. He completed staff college in Quetta in 1923‚Äì1924, and was posted to the War Office in London, England, in 1930. When the Second World War broke out, he was Director of Military Training in Ottawa. He was given command of the Royal Rifles of Canada, The Winnipeg Grenadiers, and the other Canadian support units which arrived in Hong Kong on 16 November 1941 to reinforce the British garrison ahead of the Battle of Hong Kong (8‚Äì25 December 1941). Battle of Hong Kong After the forces defending Kowloon were withdrawn to the island of Hong Kong on 11 December 1941, General Christopher Maltby organized the defence of the island into two brigades, west and east. Lawson was placed in charge of the west brigade, which included the Winnipeg Grenadiers, the Royal Scots, the Punjab Regiment (India) and the Canadian Signallers. The Japanese landed on Hong Kong Island on 18 December 1941 with the intent to split the defenders in two. After fierce fighting, Japanese forces surrounded Lawson's headquarters at around 10 a.m. on 19 December. Lawson radioed his commanders that he was \\"going outside to fight it out\\" and left his pillbox with a pistol in each hand. He was killed in the ensuing fight. When the Japanese arrived and found his body, they gave him a military burial nearby in Wong Nai Chong Gap out of respect for his courage. A chaplain was allowed to remove Lawson's silver identification disc bracelet and held on to it through four years as a Japanese prisoner of war before returning it to Lawson's family in Canada. Meanwhile, Hong Kong was relieved only on 16 September 1945, more than a month after the Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Lawson was reburied at the Sai Wan War Cemetery after the war. The original headstone was destroyed and a memorial plate was erected by the Canadian government at the site in 2005. Personal life Lawson was married to Augusta Hawkesworth Wilson in 1930 and had two sons, Arthur John (b. 1934) and Michael Ivan (b. 1936). His family donated his medals to the Royal Canadian Military Institute.

He was a government minister in Burma (now Myanmar) soon after independence; he was also a scholar, historian and linguist. His wife, Mi Mi Khaing, was also a scholar and writer. Biography Sao Saimong and his wife, Mi Mi Khaing. Sao Saimong was the first son of the fourth wife, Nang Daeng, of Saopha Kawng Kiao Intaleng (who had succeeded as ruler of Kengtung in 1895). Early in his life, Sao Saimong was sent to Bangkok to become a novice monk at the Wat Thepsirin in Bangkok, since it was his father's hope that he would eventually become the chief abbot of Kengtung. In the 1920s Sao Konkaeu Intaleng attended a durbar in India, and realized that all of his sons should be given a western education to be successful, so Sao Saimong was called back from Bangkok and sent to the Shan Chiefs' School in Taunggyi, a school founded by the British administration to train the sons of ruling families. From there, he went on to attend Rangoon University, and then on to the University of London. Returning to Burma in 1940 during the start of the Second World War, he was soon swept into war to serve with the British army. He was evacuated to India, and returned to Burma soon after the war. Several of his elder brothers were boys and Sao Saimong had not expected to rule Kengtung. But he did so briefly on his return from India, since the heir apparent, his nephew, Sao Sai Long, had not yet finished his studies in Australia. In 1947, after the Shan principalities agreed to become part of the Union of Burma, Sao Saimong had an administrative career in independent Burma and was Chief Education Officer for Shan and Kayah States. He was instrumental in the design of the revised script for Shan. Like most of the other former rulers of the Shan States, Sao Saimong was imprisoned when General Ne Win took power in 1962. After six years in prison he was released in 1968. After his release, he settled in Taunggyi, and in 1969 he was ordained as a monk in one of the Kengtung monasteries. In his scholarly career he was invited to Cornell University, the University of Michigan and Wolfson College, Cambridge. At Cambridge University Library, in 1982 and 1983, he worked with Wilfrid Lockwood and Andrew Dalby on the Scott Collection, formed by J. G. Scott, British administrator in the Shan States, whose activities he had already chronicled in his 1969 publication The Shan States and the British Annexation. Although it is neither compulsory nor customary in Myanmar to take a surname, the family chose the surname MangrƒÅi after the medieval king Mangrai of Chiangmai (northern Thailand), traditional founder of Kengtung, from whom they trace their descent; this surname therefore appears on Sao Saimong's later publications.

Other plants found at the site include mezereon, twayblade, pyramidal orchid, ploughman's spikenard (Inula conyza), and Southern adderstongue. The discovery of a population of Military Orchids at this site occurred in 1955. Prior to this the species had never been recorded in East Anglia, having previously been recorded only in Southeast England. The population then was at least 500 plants, with over 100 flowering spikes; by 1958 the population had reached 2,854 plants, with about 10% flowering, a population level and flowering proportion that were maintained throughout the 1960s. By 1971 however, only 252 plants were present, due to scrubbing over, as a result of the erection of the protective fence. Scrub clearance and removal of some surrounding trees allowed the population to recover, and subsequent counts include 1,115 plants in 1990 and \\"too many to count\\" (Harrap and Harrap 2005) in 2000, when 748 plants were recorded flowering. Genetic analysis of the orchids at Rex Graham has shown that they are distinct from those at the other two English sites, and represent an independent colonisation from Europe.

The information is one of the oldest common law pleadings (first appearing around the 13th century), and is nearly as old as the better- known indictment, with which it has always coexisted. Available via HeinOnline. Orfield cites Holdsworth as the source of this information. Available via HeinOnline. Although the information has been abolished in England and Wales and Northern Ireland, it is still used in Canada, the United States (at both the federal level and in some states) and various other common law jurisdictions. Canada =Criminal charges= In Canada, charges under the Criminal Code are either by summary process, or by indictment. Both types of charges begin with an information, except in the rare situation of a direct indictment by the Attorney General. The form of an information is prescribed by the Criminal Code.Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, Form 2. Informations are to be drafted using Form 2 for both indictable mattersCriminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 506. and summary matters.Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 788. An information must be sworn by the informant, who is normally a peace officer. The informant then must lay the information before a justice of the peace. The information must contain an allegation that an offence has been committed, within the territorial jurisdiction of the justice of the peace.Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 504. The justice of the peace then is required to review the information and determine if process should issue under the Criminal Code for the arrest of the individual.Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 507. If the matter is a summary matter, the information is then laid before the court with jurisdiction to hear the charges, usually the Provincial Court, and the matter will proceed directly to trial. In indictable matters, the information is laid before a judge of the Provincial Court for the purposes of a preliminary inquiry, which is a hearing to determine if the Crown prosecutor has demonstrated that there is evidence to support the charges in the information. If the preliminary inquiry judge rules that the Crown prosecutor has satisfied this standard, the Court commits the accused to stand trial. The Crown prosecutor then files an indictment, which is the formal charge to begin the trial, normally in the superior trial court. The indictment is based on the charges originally set out in the information. The Crown is entitled to add additional charges which were supported by the evidence led in the preliminary inquiry, even if those charges were not in the information. However, if the preliminary inquiry judge declined to commit the accused on a charge set out in the information, the Crown cannot include that charge in the indictment.R v Tapaquon, [1993 4 SCR 535.] The matter then proceeds to trial on the indictment. =Information to obtain a search warrant= The term \\"information\\" is also used for other purposes in the Criminal Code, such as applications to obtain a search warrant. A peace officer who is seeking a search warrant must file a sworn information before a justice of the peace, outlining the reasons in support of a search warrant. The justice of the peace then reviews the information to obtain, and decides whether the information supports the issuance of a search warrant. United Kingdom =England and Wales= A criminal information was a proceeding in the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court brought at the suit of the Crown without a previous indictment.Halsbury's Statutes, Fourth Edition, One of the reprints, Volume 12(1), page 360, notes to section 6 of the Criminal Law Act 1967 Criminal informations other than those filed ex officio by the Attorney-General were abolished by section 12 of the Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1938. Any power to bring proceedings for an offence by criminal information in the High Court was abolished by section 6(6) of the Criminal Law Act 1967. The last occasion on which there was an ex officio information by a law officer was in 1911.The Seventh Report of the Criminal Law Revision Committee (Cmnd 2659), paragraph 63 =Northern Ireland= Any power to bring proceedings for an offence by criminal information in the High Court was abolished by section 6(6) of the Criminal Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1967. United States Because the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution expressly creates a constitutional right to be indicted by a grand jury, the information is used in federal criminal procedure only when a defendant voluntarily pleads guilty (often as part of a plea bargain) and waives the right to an indictment. However, the Fifth Amendment right to a grand jury indictment does not apply against the state governments because the grand jury provision has not been incorporated against the states by the Fourteenth Amendment. Thus, the information has always been the dominant charging document in the western states, where extremely dispersed population distribution during the American frontier era made it difficult to select and convene petit juries to hold trials. In that era, convening even larger grand juries just to indict criminals was seen as an unnecessary extravagance. In western states, district attorneys are authorized by statute to charge criminal suspects by filing informations. The defendant is then entitled to challenge the information at a preliminary hearing, during which the prosecution must establish to the judge's satisfaction that probable cause exists to bind over the defendant until trial. The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of this procedure in Hurtado v. California (1886). The grand jury is still available in the states where informations are used, but it is usually used only for issuing indictments for certain types of crimes or for certain types of anti-corruption investigations.

Life Herman de Coninck was born in Mechelen, Belgium, where his parents ran a Catholic bookshop. He attended the Sint-Rombouts College in Mechelen where he contributed to the school newspaper. Determined to become a writer, he studied Germanic philology at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven. While in Leuven he wrote for the University paper Universitas. Graduating in 1966, he took up teaching in Berchem while he lived in Heverlee, near Leuven. In 1967 he fulfilled his compulsory civilian duty in the Belgian army. In 1970 he left teaching to become an editor of the weekly magazine HUMO, a post he held until 1983. During this period he regularly delivered interviews together with Piet Piryns. These interviews were collected and published as Woe is Woe in de Nedderlens in 1972. Tired of interviews, he became editor-in-chief of the magazine Nieuw Wereldtijdschrift in 1983. Under his direction, NWT combined journalism and literature. Since De Coninck was less of a businessman than a writer, the magazine was not a commercial success. Herman de Coninck Plaque in Lisbon. Reads, \\"Fairy Tale. Once upon a time there was a man who was always just.\\" While on his way to a literary colloquium with several other Flemish and Dutch poets and writers (amongst them Hugo Claus, Anna Enquist and Gerrit Komrij), Herman de Coninck collapsed in the streets of Lisbon, Portugal on May 22, 1997. He died there at the age of 53 from a heart failure. A year later, his widow Kristien Hemmerechts wrote a very personal and biographical monologue entitled Taal Zonder Mij (1998). Work Wall poem of De Coninck in The Hague (2019) As a poet, De Coninck aimed to produce poetry for the masses. His first volume, De Lenige Liefde, appeared in 1969, becoming the best-selling volume of 20th- century Flemish poetry and winning literary prizes such as the \\"Yang-prijs\\" (1969) and the \\"Prijs van de Provincie Antwerpen\\" (1971). The collection has a relativating tone, and not seldom the poems have an ironic undertone. The death of de Coninck's first wife, An Somers, in a car accident in 1971 began a difficult period in his life. The loss of his wife deeply influenced his second volume of poetry, Zolang er sneeuw ligt(1975). The collection won both the \\"Dirk Martensprijs van de Stad Aalst\\" (1976) and the \\"Prijs van de Vlaamse Provincie√´n\\" (1978). Later collections, such as Met een Klank van Hobo (1980) and De Hectaren van het Geheugen (1985) show a shift to a more romantic topos in his poetry. He also published the collections \\"Enkelvoud\\" (1991), \\"Schoolslag\\" (1994) and \\"Vingerafdrukken\\" (1997). His essays on poetry were collected and published as Over de troost van pessimisme (1983), De flaptekstlezer (1992) and Intimiteit onder de melkweg (1994). De Coninck was also a prolific letter-writer, keeping the letters he received and making copies of all the letters he sent. His estate contained 15,000 letters.

Structured analysis and design techniques are fundamental tools of systems analysis. They developed from classical systems analysis of the 1960s and 1970s.Edward Yourdon (1986). Managing the Structured Techniques: Strategies for Software Development in the 1990s. Yourdon Press. p.35.  Objectives of structured analysis  Structured analysis became popular in the 1980s and is still in use today. Structured analysis consists of interpreting the system concept (or real world situations) into data and control terminology represented by data flow diagrams. The flow of data and control from bubble to the data store to bubble can be difficult to track and the number of bubbles can increase. One approach is to first define events from the outside world that require the system to react, then assign a bubble to that event. Bubbles that need to interact are then connected until the system is defined. Bubbles are usually grouped into higher level bubbles to decrease complexity. Data dictionaries are needed to describe the data and command flows, and a process specification is needed to capture the transaction/transformation information.FAA (2000). FAA System Safety Handbook, Appendix D. December 30, 2000. SA and SD are displayed with structure charts, data flow diagrams and data model diagrams, of which there were many variations, including those developed by Tom DeMarco, Ken Orr, Larry Constantine, Vaughn Frick, Ed Yourdon, Steven Ward, Peter Chen, and others. These techniques were combined in various published system development methodologies, including structured systems analysis and design method, profitable information by design (PRIDE), Nastec structured analysis & design, SDM/70 and the Spectrum structured system development methodology.  History  Structured analysis is part of a series of structured methods that represent a collection of analysis, design, and programming techniques that were developed in response to the problems facing the software world from the 1960s to the 1980s. In this timeframe most commercial programming was done in Cobol and Fortran, then C and BASIC. There was little guidance on \\"good\\" design and programming techniques, and there were no standard techniques for documenting requirements and designs. Systems were getting larger and more complex, and the information system development became harder and harder to do so.\\"Dave Levitt (2000). \\"Introduction to Structured Analysis and Design.\\" at faculty.inverhills.edu/dlevitt. Retrieved 21 Sep 2008. No longer online 2017. As a way to help manage large and complex software, the following structured methods emerged since the end of the 1960s: * Structured programming in circa 1967 with Edsger Dijkstra - \\"Go To Statement Considered Harmful\\" * Niklaus Wirth Stepwise design in 1971 * Nassi‚ÄìShneiderman diagram in 1972 * Warnier/Orr diagram in 1974 - \\"Logical Construction of Programs\\" * HIPO in 1974 - IBM Hierarchy input-process-output (though this should really be output-input-process) * Structured design around 1975 with Larry Constantine, Ed Yourdon and Wayne Stevens. * Jackson structured programming in circa 1975 developed by Michael A.

According to Hay (1999) \\"information engineering was a logical extension of the structured techniques that were developed during the 1970s. Structured programming led to structured design, which in turn led to structured systems analysis. These techniques were characterized by their use of diagrams: structure charts for structured design, and data flow diagrams for structured analysis, both to aid in communication between users and developers, and to improve the analyst's and the designer's discipline. During the 1980s, tools began to appear which both automated the drawing of the diagrams, and kept track of the things drawn in a data dictionary\\".David C. Hay (1999) Achieving buzzword compliance in Object orientation Essential Strategies, Inc. After the example of computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM), the use of these tools was named computer-aided software engineering (CASE).  Structured analysis topics  = Single abstraction mechanism = Structured analysis example.DoD Architecture Framework Working Group (2003). DoDAF 1.5 Volume 2, 15 August 2003. Structured analysis typically creates a hierarchy employing a single abstraction mechanism. The structured analysis method can employ IDEF (see figure), is process driven, and starts with a purpose and a viewpoint. This method identifies the overall function and iteratively divides functions into smaller functions, preserving inputs, outputs, controls, and mechanisms necessary to optimize processes. Also known as a functional decomposition approach, it focuses on cohesion within functions and coupling between functions leading to structured data. The functional decomposition of the structured method describes the process without delineating system behavior and dictates system structure in the form of required functions. The method identifies inputs and outputs as related to the activities. One reason for the popularity of structured analysis is its intuitive ability to communicate high-level processes and concepts, whether in single system or enterprise levels. Discovering how objects might support functions for commercially prevalent object-oriented development is unclear. In contrast to IDEF, the UML is interface driven with multiple abstraction mechanisms useful in describing service-oriented architectures (SOAs). = Approach = Structured analysis views a system from the perspective of the data flowing through it. The function of the system is described by processes that transform the data flows. Structured analysis takes advantage of information hiding through successive decomposition (or top down) analysis. This allows attention to be focused on pertinent details and avoids confusion from looking at irrelevant details. As the level of detail increases, the breadth of information is reduced. The result of structured analysis is a set of related graphical diagrams, process descriptions, and data definitions. They describe the transformations that need to take place and the data required to meet a system's functional requirements. Alan Hecht and Andy Simmons (1986) Integrating Automated Structured Analysis and Design with Ada Programming Support Environments NASA 1986. The structured analyse approach develops perspectives on both process objects and data objects. De Marco's approachTom DeMarco (1978). Structured Analysis and System Specification. Yourdon Press, New York, 1978. consists of the following objects (see figure): * Context diagram * Data flow diagram * Process specifications * Data dictionary Hereby the data flow diagrams (DFDs) are directed graphs. The arcs represent data, and the nodes (circles or bubbles) represent processes that transform the data. A process can be further decomposed to a more detailed DFD which shows the subprocesses and data flows within it. The subprocesses can in turn be decomposed further with another set of DFDs until their functions can be easily understood. Functional primitives are processes which do not need to be decomposed further. Functional primitives are described by a process specification (or mini-spec). The process specification can consist of pseudo- code, flowcharts, or structured English. The DFDs model the structure of the system as a network of interconnected processes composed of functional primitives. The data dictionary is a set of entries (definitions) of data flows, data elements, files, and databases. The data dictionary entries are partitioned in a top-down manner. They can be referenced in other data dictionary entries and in data flow diagrams. = Context diagram = Example of a system context diagram.NDE Project Management (NPOESS) Data Exploitation web site. 2008. Context diagrams are diagrams that represent the actors outside a system that could interact with that system. This diagram is the highest level view of a system, similar to block diagram, showing a, possibly software-based, system as a whole and its inputs and outputs from/to external factors. This type of diagram according to Kossiakoff (2003) usually \\"pictures the system at the center, with no details of its interior structure, surrounded by all its interacting systems, environment and activities. The objective of a system context diagram is to focus attention on external factors and events that should be considered in developing a complete set of system requirements and constraints\\".Alexander Kossiakoff, William N. Sweet (2003). Systems Engineering: Principles and Practices p. 413. System context diagrams are related to data flow diagram, and show the interactions between a system and other actors which the system is designed to face. System context diagrams can be helpful in understanding the context in which the system will be part of software engineering. = Data dictionary = Entity relationship diagram, essential for the design of database tables, extracts, and metadata. A data dictionary or database dictionary is a file that defines the basic organization of a database.Data Integration Glossary , U.S. Department of Transportation, August 2001. A database dictionary contains a list of all files in the database, the number of records in each file, and the names and types of each data field. Most database management systems keep the data dictionary hidden from users to prevent them from accidentally destroying its contents. Data dictionaries do not contain any actual data from the database, only bookkeeping information for managing it. Without a data dictionary, however, a database management system cannot access data from the database. Database users and application developers can benefit from an authoritative data dictionary document that catalogs the organization, contents, and conventions of one or more databases.TechTarget, SearchSOA, What is a data dictionary? This typically includes the names and descriptions of various tables and fields in each database, plus additional details, like the type and length of each data element. There is no universal standard as to the level of detail in such a document, but it is primarily a distillation of metadata about database structure, not the data itself. A data dictionary document also may include further information describing how data elements are encoded. One of the advantages of well-designed data dictionary documentation is that it helps to establish consistency throughout a complex database, or across a large collection of federated databases.AHIMA Practice Brief, Guidelines for Developing a Data Dictionary, Journal of AHIMA 77, no.2 (February 2006): 64A-D. = Data flow diagrams = Data flow diagram example.John Azzolini (2000). Introduction to Systems Engineering Practices. July 2000. A data flow diagram (DFD) is a graphical representation of the \\"flow\\" of data through an information system. It differs from the system flowchart as it shows the flow of data through processes instead of computer hardware. Data flow diagrams were invented by Larry Constantine, developer of structured design, based on Martin and Estrin's \\"data flow graph\\" model of computation.W. Stevens, G. Myers, L. Constantine, \\"Structured Design\\", IBM Systems Journal, 13 (2), 115-139, 1974. It is common practice to draw a system context diagram first which shows the interaction between the system and outside entities. The DFD is designed to show how a system is divided into smaller portions and to highlight the flow of data between those parts. This context-level data flow diagram is then \\"exploded\\" to show more detail of the system being modeled. Data flow diagrams (DFDs) are one of the three essential perspectives of structured systems analysis and design method (SSADM). The sponsor of a project and the end users will need to be briefed and consulted throughout all stages of a system's evolution. With a data flow diagram, users are able to visualize how the system will operate, what the system will accomplish, and how the system will be implemented. The old system's data flow diagrams can be drawn up and compared with the new system's data flow diagrams to draw comparisons to implement a more efficient system. Data flow diagrams can be used to provide the end user with a physical idea of where the data they input ultimately has an effect upon the structure of the whole system from order to dispatch to recook. How any system is developed can be determined through a data flow diagram. = Structure chart = A configuration system structure chart. A structure chart (SC) is a chart that shows the breakdown of the configuration system to the lowest manageable levels.\\"Configuration Management\\" In: IRS Resources Part 2. Information Technology Chapter 27. Configuration Management. Accessed 14 Nov 2008. This chart is used in structured programming to arrange the program modules in a tree structure. Each module is represented by a box which contains the name of the modules. The tree structure visualizes the relationships between the modules.James Martin, Carma L. McClure (1988). Structured Techniques: The Basis for Case. Prentice Hall. p.56. Structure charts are used in structured analysis to specify the high-level design, or architecture, of a computer program. As a design tool, they aid the programmer in dividing and conquering a large software problem, that is, recursively breaking a problem down into parts that are small enough to be understood by a human brain. The process is called top- down design, or functional decomposition. Programmers use a structure chart to build a program in a manner similar to how an architect uses a blueprint to build a house. In the design stage, the chart is drawn and used as a way for the client and the various software designers to communicate. During the actual building of the program (implementation), the chart is continually referred to as the master-plan.David Wolber \\"Structure Charts : Supplementary Notes Structure Charts and Bottom-up Implementation: Java Version. = Structured design = Structured design (SD) is concerned with the development of modules and the synthesis of these modules in a so-called \\"module hierarchy\\". In order to design optimal module structure and interfaces two principles are crucial: * Cohesion which is \\"concerned with the grouping of functionally related processes into a particular module\\", and * Coupling relates to \\"the flow of information or parameters passed between modules. Optimal coupling reduces the interfaces of modules and the resulting complexity of the software\\". Structured design was developed by Larry Constantine in the late 1960s, then refined and published with collaborators in the 1970s; see Larry Constantine: structured design for details. has proposed his own approach which consists of three main objects : * structure charts * module specifications * data dictionary. The structure chart aims to show \\"the module hierarchy or calling sequence relationship of modules. There is a module specification for each module shown on the structure chart. The module specifications can be composed of pseudo-code or a program design language. The data dictionary is like that of structured analysis. At this stage in the software development lifecycle, after analysis and design have been performed, it is possible to automatically generate data type declarations\\",Belkhouche, B., and J.E. Urban.

Criticisms  Problems with data flow diagrams have included the following: # Choosing bubbles appropriately # Partitioning bubbles in a meaningful and mutually agreed upon manner, # Documentation size needed to understand the Data Flows, # Data flow diagrams are strongly functional in nature and thus subject to frequent change # Though \\"data\\" flow is emphasized, \\"data\\" modeling is not, so there is little understanding the subject matter of the system # Customers have difficulty following how the concept is mapped into data flows and bubbles # Designers must shift the DFD organization into an implementable format  See also  * Event partitioning * Flow-based programming * HIPO * Jackson structured programming * Prosa Structured Analysis Tool * Soft systems methodology  References   Further reading   Tom DeMarco (1978).

She was the eldest child of Henry Augustus Webb (1880‚Äì1926) and Rose Jeannette Keysor. She had a younger brother, Henry Richard Webb, also an actor, and two elder identical twin half-brothers, Leslie and Gordon Durlacher, from her mother's first marriage to Samuel Durlacher. She was the niece of Leonard Keysor, the first Jewish serviceman to win the Victoria Cross in the First World War. A half-brother was the actor George Webb. Career  Born in Willesden, Middlesex, England, she is best known for her appearances as a stooge for Benny Hill in his long-running Thames Television series. At under five feet tall, with a booming voice and dyed flame-red hair, she was often cast as a blowsey mother-in-law or Cockney type character. Following her separation from her husband, she lived with Al Jeffery \\"Jeffie\\", an accomplished banjo player, whom she adored. She was called \\"Podge\\" by Jeffie and was proud that she still had all her own teeth. She signed her letters: \\"Dame Rita Webb\\" and refused to be on the TV show This is Your Life .Who's On TV (ITV Books, 1980) She and her brother were exceptionally close and they talked every night on the telephone until her death. In the 1960s she made a number of television appearances with Billy Cotton and alongside Arthur Haynes. Her many other television credits include several appearances in Spike Milligan's Q series, Dixon of Dock Green, Till Death Us Do Part, Sykes, Up Pompeii! with Frankie Howerd, The Wednesday Play and Steptoe and Son. In the Space: 1999 episode \\"The Taybor\\" she appeared as a deliberately-unattractive form assumed by the shapeshifter Maya. She also appeared in supporting roles in many films, including To Sir, with Love (1967), The Magic Christian (1969), Alfred Hitchcock's Frenzy (1972), Confessions of a Pop Performer (1975), and Come Play with Me (1977). In 1968 she appeared, in a cameo role as a wrestling referee in the Dave Clark television production Hold On, It's the Dave Clark Five. Rita Webb died in 1981, aged 77, from cancer. Her funeral was held at West London Crematorium and a memorial service took place at St. Paul's Church, Covent Garden, known as The Actors‚Äô Church. She was survived by Jeffie, her brother Henry, and Henry's three children.

The notches allowed efficient sorting and selecting of specific cards matching multiple desired criteria, from a larger number of cards in a paper-based database of information. In the mid-20th century they were sold under names such as Cope-Chat cards, E-Z Sort cards, McBee Keysort, and Indecks cards. Overview Edge-notched card used as a library card. Edges not notched here. A notched card showing two levels of notching. Hand tool for notching cards. Edge-notched cards are a manual data storage and manipulation technology used for specialized data storage and cataloging applications through much of the 20th century. An early instance of something like this methodology appeared in 1904. While there were many variants, by the mid-20th century a popular version consisted of paperboard cards with holes punched at regular intervals along all four edges, a short distance in from the edges. The center of the card might be blank space for information to be written, or contain a pre-printed form, or contain a microform image in the case of edge-notched aperture cards. To record data, the paper stock between a hole and the nearest edge was removed by a special notching tool. The holes were assigned a meaning dependent upon a particular application. For example, one hole might record the answer to a yes/no question on a survey, with the presence of a notch meaning \\"yes\\". More-complex data was encoded using a variety of schemes, often using a superimposed code which allows more distinct categories to be coded than the number of holes available. To allow a visual check that all cards in a deck were oriented the same way, one corner of each card was beveled, much like Hollerith punched cards. Edge-notched cards, however, were not intended to be read by machines such as IBM card sorters. Instead, they were manipulated by passing one or more slim needles through selected holes in a group of cards. As the needles were lifted, the cards that were notched in the hole positions where the needles were inserted would be left behind as rest of the deck was lifted by the needles. Using two or more needles produced a logical and function. Combining the cards from two different selections produced a logical or. Quite complex manipulations, including sorting were possible using these techniques. Applications Before the widespread use of computers, some public libraries used a system of small edge-notched cards in paper pockets in the back of library books to keep track of them. An example of an edge-notched library card. Edge-notched cards were used for course scheduling in some high schools and colleges during the same era. Notched cards were used in the preparation of The Last Whole Earth Catalog in the 1970s. Needle cards Needle cards (another term for edge-notched cards) are index cards with text, written by hand or typewriter, that have a line of prepunched holes along one or more sides. By cutting or punching away (notching out) the paper between a hole and the edge of the card, the card is associated with a category. By putting long knitting needles through certain holes in a deck of such cards, lifting and shaking gently, cards that belong to a combination of categories can be selected. This tool is less useful for data sets larger than 10,000 records. Affectionately referred to as \\"The Knitting Needle Computer\\", these database- like systems were popular sometime in the 1960s and 1970s. Science teachers may still use these as a teaching tool for relational databases. Indexed card systems can be made with index cards and a hole punch.

The partisan embodiment of the movement was the Parti patriote, which held many seats in the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada (the elected lower house of the Lower Canadian parliament ). The movement was at once a liberal and republican reaction against colonial control of the government of Lower Canada, and a more general nationalistic reaction against British presence and domination over what had previously been an exclusively French territory.D. G. Creighton, The Struggle for Financial Control in Lower Canada It was inspired by the American Revolution, the decolonization of the Americas, as well as the political philosophy of classical liberalism and republicanism. Among its leading figures were Fran√ßois Blanchet, Pierre-Stanislas B√©dard, John Neilson, Jean-Thomas Taschereau, James Stuart, Louis Bourdages, Denis-Benjamin Viger, Daniel Tracey, Edmund Bailey O'Callaghan, Andrew Stuart, Wolfred Nelson, Robert Nelson, Thomas Storrow Brown, Fran√ßois Jalbert and Louis-Joseph Papineau. Its ideals were conveyed through the newspapers the Montreal Vindicator, Le Canadien, and La Minerve. The movement demanded democratic reforms, such as an elected Legislative Council, as opposed to the contemporary council whose members were appointed for life by the British Crown.Elinor Kyte, Redcoats and Patriotes, The Rebellions in Lower Canada. Canadian War Museum publication, 1985, p. 6. The Parti patriote also sought to place control of the colony's budget in the hands of the elected assembly, thus supporting Lower Canada's position as semi-autonomous within the Empire.Kyte, p. 6. In 1834, Louis-Joseph Papineau drafted the Ninety-Two Resolutions to United Kingdom to obtain these and other aims. The Resolutions were in great part denied by the Russell Resolutions, which resulted in a radicalization of the Patriotes and their moving closer to demands of outright independence and a Lower Canada republic. Many of its followers ended up taking part in an armed insurrection known as the Lower Canada Rebellion, which was put down by the British army and its volunteer militia.

It was founded in 666 AD by Saint Erkenwald who was the first abbot, and from 675 AD the Bishop of London. At the same time he founded the abbey at Chertsey, Erkenwald founded Barking Abbey on the Thames east of London, where his sister Saint Ethelburga was the first abbess. Most of north- west Surrey was granted to the abbey by King Frithuwald of Surrey. Dark Age saints buried here include Saint Beocca, a Dark Ages Catholic Saint from Anglo-Saxon England buried here around 870 AD, and ninth century Saint Edor of Chertsey. In the 9th century it was sacked by the Danes and refounded from Abingdon Abbey by King Edgar of England in 964. In the eleventh century the monks engineered the Abbey River as an offshoot of the River Thames to supply power to the abbey's watermill. In late medieval times, the Abbey became famous as the burial place of King Henry VI (whose body was later transferred to St George's Chapel, Windsor). The abbey was dissolved by the commissioners of King Henry VIII in 1537, but the community moved to Bisham. Remnants The site was given to Sir William Fitzwilliam and now only slight traces remain amongst later buildings, although the abbey is remembered in many local names (for example: Abbey River, Monk's Walk, Abbey Fields). Some very fine medieval tiles from the abbey, some depicting the legend of Tristan and Iseult, may be seen in the British Museum.Richard and Saladin; Combat Series; Chertsey tiles, British Museum page From the ruins of the abbey, individual letter tiles dating to the second half of the 13th century were recovered. They were assembled to form religious inscription texts on the floor and can be considered a forerunner of movable type printing. One of the Abbey's bells, cast by a Wokingham foundry circa 1380 and weighing just over half a ton, is still in use as the 5th of the ring of eight at St Peter's church, Chertsey, and is one of the oldest bells in current use in Surrey. A medieval stained glass panel with the abbey's coat of arms is displayed in the Burrell Collection near Glasgow, and the two crossed keys (of Saint Peter) from the arms are also in the official Banner of Arms of Surrey County Council. Some illuminated manuscripts from the abbey survive in various collections. The Chertsey Breviary, c. 1300, is in the Bodleian Library in Oxford (Bodley ). Chertsey Abbey is mentioned in William Shakespeare's Richard III, Act I, Scene 2, Line 27, where Lady Anne says, \\"Come now towards Chertsey with your holy load\\", referring to the body of Henry VI. The Worshipful Company of Haberdashers holds the advowson of St Peter's, Chertsey, nowadays. Later history of the site After Sir William Fitzwilliam, Chertsey Abbey was owned by Dr John Hammond (c. 1555‚Äì1617), physician to the royal household under James I, who purchased the site of Chertsey Abbey in Surrey in 1602. Dr Hammond's son, Lt.Col. Thomas Hammond of Cromwell's New Model Army, was named as a Commissioner at the High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I, and despite attending no fewer than fourteen of its sittings, he did not sign the death warrant. In the mid-19th century the site of the abbey was excavated under the supervision of the architect and archaeologist Samuel Angell, who published an account of the investigations, accompanied by a ground plan of the abbey church, in 1862.

Her experience with getting other work published in other fanzines (covering, for example, Doctor Who and Blake's 7) made her realise that she could create her own publication devoted to Strontium Dog. After 14 issues, over 8 years, she handed over the reins to members of the FutureQuake Press (FQP) team. Creators Dogbreath contributors during Dr Bob‚Äôs editorship who have gone on to be art and script droids for 2000 AD itself include Rufus Dayglo and Al Ewing. Scott Montgomery has written a few articles for the Judge Dredd Megazine and works for The Dandy. Issues Issue 1 of Dogbreath came out in 1997. It contained some pre-written fanfics by Dr Bob, Allan J. Sim, and specially written fanfic by Gary Loveridge, plus a specially written chronology of the Strontium Dog universe by Dr Bob.

Even though a layman, he possessed the ecclesiastical fief of Velines in Dordogne; because of it he was called the Archpriest of V√©lines (Archipr√™tre de Velines). He was deprived of his benefice by the archbishop of Bordeaux because he was mixing \\"with brigands and men of base extraction\\". Battle of Poitiers(1356) in Froissart Chronicle. The Archpriest quickly made a name in the world of mercenaries specializing in scaling castle walls. His meteoric rise, despite his noble status, astonished his contemporaries. In the early 1350s, Arnaud commanded a band of 80 men in South-West France, and was known for his skill at taking walled cities and castles by escalade (ladders). He was equally known for repeatedly crossing line between military service and banditry. In 1356, he was wounded and captured after fighting in the forces of the Count of Alen√ßon at the Battle of Poitiers.Sumption (1999), p.360 After his release he married a rich widow. In 1357 Arnaud was elected commander of the \\"Great Company\\", a loose collection of companies of freebooters of various nationalities. While most ordinary companies numbered no more than a few hundred men, the shifting membership brought at its height made up an army of about 2700 men. Marriage In 1357, Arnaud de Cervole married Jeanne de Gra√ßay, and after Arnaud she married Enguerran of Eudin In 1358, Arnaud and his troops travelled to Avignon where Pope Innocent VI gave him 20,000 gold florins to distribute among his companions in exchange for giving up all the castles his men had occupied in the papal territories.

They then plundered Burgundy. They crossed the Rhone on July 13, 1357. Battle of Brignais Battle of Brigniais.In 1362, he was hired by the French king John II to deal with English brigands, dispatching him with a small royal army led by the Comte de Tancarville and the Comte de la Marche. This army was defeated at the Battle of Brignais, where Arnaud was captured. Here the troops raised by the king were routed due to the betrayal of the Archpriest.Froissart's Chronicles Failed crusade and death In 1365, the Duke of Burgundy offered to lead a major crusade against the Turks in Hungary (to take out the companies of the kingdom of France). The crusade had the support of Pope Urban V who wanted to get rid of Tard-Venus companies operating in the Rhone Valley, but never happened.Fran√ßoise Autrand, Charles V, Fayard 1994, p. 501 Although the Archpriest did set about collecting mercenaries together, the project progressed slowly and many had dispersed again by the end of the year. A fresh attempt was made in 1366 but supply problems caused discontent. On 25 May 1366, Arnaud de Cervole was murdered by his own men,Sumption (1999), pp523-4,532-3 as his army camped near Macon, before passing the Sa√¥ne.

A watercolored woodcut from the Liszt Collection The Liszt Collection contains over one million, generally nineteenth-century engravings and images. The Liszt Collection is an international project to preserve a portrayal of history through contemporary engravings, articles and books. The Liszt Collection mainly covers Europe and the United States as well as other locations in the rest of the world, such as Canada, Australia, certain African countries, and South America and Asia. The main areas of interest covered by the collection are history, society, art and culture. These areas are covered by showing geographical locations (towns, villages, counties and countries) as well as by showing various aspects of life in the nineteenth century. Ranging from topics such as politics, fashion in nineteenth-century France and social activities in the nineteenth-century German village to topics such as science, hiking in Switzerland, transport and coaches and trains crossing the country side. In the mid-nineteenth-century wood engraving was used extensively for the speed and ease with which wood engravings could be produced. Engravings could be made within days of the event shown on the engraving. At this time very few (mainly American) painters could make a living selling their canvases and many turned to engraving to earn a living. Artists of the Liszt Collection‚Äôs engravings go from J. B. Allan,W. H. Bartlett and Thomas Bewick to R. Zogbaum. The Liszt Lexicon The Liszt Collection offers an exceptional contribution to our world heritage. To open the content, consisting of images with captions and keywords and related articles, the collection will be made available on a wiki platform.

Austrian Hungarian monarchy The birth certificate that saved Gizella Schwarz from the concentration camps¬π The Liszt collection‚Äôs roots lay in the Austria Hungary Empire where Gizella Schwarz (1877‚Äì1962), started to collect some ‚ÄòLiszt‚Äô prints. These were portraits of Franz Liszt and woodcuts of the places where he lived and worked. However, her interest quickly broadened and Gizella bought prints of a great variety of subjects. Amongst many others these include butterflies and flowers, engravings of Budapest and Hungary, but also London, Paris and New York. On 15 October 1877, K√°roly Schwarz and Maria Habetler got a daughter, which they named Gizella. The baby was born in K√∂rmend, Hungary, where Gizella spent her childhood. K√°roly Schwarz owned the well known Schwarz Coffee House and here it was that the young Gizella met many interesting people. K√∂rmend being a frequented stop for travellers on their way from Hungary to Austria. Gizella loved music and literature and spent her whole life reading. As family history has it, around 1880 in Budapest she even, as a little girl, met Franz Liszt, the famous nineteenth- century composer. In 1939 she asked her birth certificate¬π from the Catholic Church in K√∂rmend and by obtaining this certificate she saved herself from the concentration camps. The birth certificate is shown on the right and proves the validity of her origins being Roman Catholic. It is signed by the Vicar of K√∂rmend which verifies the genuinity of the information. This is proven by his signature and stamp under the sentence: \\"That the certificate is in compliance with the original birth register of the Roman Catholic Church, and that I further strengthen this proof with my signature and official stamp.\\" As it can be seen a red satisfactory tick has later been added, presumably by a German officer, to certify that her origins were indeed 'lawful'. In 1957, Gizella was portrayed by Janos Szikra¬≤, at the age of 80, 4 years before her death. Over the past hundred years the Liszt collection was gradually expanded and now houses over one million nineteenth-century engravings, prints and images and over two million articles. Gizella used this suitcase to keep her first prints in The Liszt Collection and image libraries For The Liszt Collection, a diversity of image libraries like, FotoLibra, Alamy, Album Archivo Fotogr√°fico , Cultural Heritage Online/museum-images.com, Heritage Image Partnership Picture Library, TopFoto < http://www.topfoto.co.uk/> etc. offer a way of getting its collection online.

The United Way Movement is a federated network of local United Way offices serving more than 5,000 communities across Canada, each registered as its own non- profit organization and governed by an independent volunteer-led local Board of Directors. Each United Way works locally to raise funds and invest in improving lives in its community.About Us In French, both in Quebec and across Canada, the organization is known as Centraide. The organization often uses the United Way and Centraide names together, recognizing the bilingual nature of the country‚Äôs culture and people. United Way Centraide Canada is the national office and has a distinct role to provide leadership, guidance and support to local United Ways across the country. Together, local United Ways and United Way Centraide Canada form the United Way Movement. Due to donors' generous support, United Ways and Centraides invest every year in local communities across Canada. The over 80 United Way and Centraide offices operating across Canada offer or support more than 6,000 programs supporting those in need, and engage over one million donors, staff and volunteers who work to change lives in local communities. United Way Centraide's work focuses on three key strategies that create opportunities for everyone in our communities: moving people from poverty to possibility, helping kids be all they can be, and building strong and healthy communities. Community Impact Mission The Mission of United Way of Canada is: \\"To improve lives and build community by engaging individuals and mobilizing collective action.\\"United Way Centraide Canada: 2016 Annual Report Adopted in 2003, this mission represents a shift in the organization's focus of umbrella fundraising to community impact. United Way Centraide Canada regards community impact as the achievement of positive long-term changes to the quality of life in local communities which is brought about by addressing the root causes of social problems, as well as their symptoms. The National Office The National Office, which was founded in 1939, is located in Ottawa, Ontario. As the national organization, United Way Centraide Canada represents local United Ways and Centraides within Canada's voluntary sector, internationally and provides services such as leadership training and education opportunities. The national organization convenes local United Ways and Centraides on a biennial basis at its annual conference, for the purposes of professional development training, the sharing of best practices and learning from leading thinkers. History A broadside published in the 1930s by the Federation for Community Service in Toronto, showing how donations are distributed to member agencies The United Way Centraide movement began in 1917, when charities in Montreal and Toronto started community collectives inspired by similar activities in the United States. In particular, various clergy in Denver were trying to raise money individually to support their community, but started working together in 1887 when they realized that they could have a greater impact if they worked together to raise and distribute funds. This approach began to be adopted in Canada during the turmoil of the First World War period. Other collectives were initiated in other parts of the country over time, under a variety of names (including Red Feather (or Plume Rouge in French), Community Chest, F√©d√©ration des oeuvres de charit√© and the United Appeal). It was not until the 1970s that these organizations took the name of United Way and Centraide (in 1973 and 1975 respectively).

It was written and directed by Peter Brook and produced by Lewis M. Allen. The film was in production for much of 1961, though the film did not premiere until 1963, and was not released in the United Kingdom until 1964. Golding himself supported the film. When Kenneth Tynan was a script editor for Ealing Studios he commissioned a script of Lord of the Flies from Nigel Kneale, but Ealing Studios closed in 1959 before it could be produced. The novel was adapted into a movie for a second time in 1990; the 1963 film is generally considered more faithful to the novel than the 1990 adaptation. Plot A group of schoolboys are evacuated from England following the outbreak of an unidentified war. Their aircraft is shot down by briefly-glimpsed fighter planes and ditches near a remote island. The main character, Ralph, is seen walking through a tropical forest. He meets an intelligent and chubby boy with glasses, who reveals his school nickname was Piggy, but asks that Ralph not repeat that. The two go to the beach where they find a conch shell, which Ralph blows to rally the other survivors. As they emerge from the jungle, it becomes clear that no adults have escaped the crash. Singing is then heard and a small column of school choir boys, wearing dark cloaks and hats and led by a boy named Jack Merridew, walk towards Ralph and Piggy. The boys decide to appoint a chief. The vote goes to Ralph, not Jack. Initially, Ralph is able to steer the boys (all of whom are aged between about six and fourteen) towards a reasonably civilised and co-operative society. They meet in regular assemblies during which the conch is passed around, signifying which boy may speak. The choir boys make wooden spears, creating the appearance that they are warriors within the group. Crucially, Jack has a knife, capable of killing an animal. The boys build shelters and start a signal fire using Piggy's spectacles. With no rescue in sight, the increasingly authoritarian and violence-prone Jack starts hunting and eventually finds a pig. Meanwhile, the fire, for which he and his \\"hunters\\" are responsible, goes out, losing the boys' chance of being spotted from a passing aeroplane. Piggy chastises Jack, and Jack strikes him in retaliation, knocking his glasses off, and breaking one lens. Ralph is furious with Jack. Soon some of the boys begin to talk of a beast that comes from the water. Jack, obsessed with this imagined threat, leaves the group to start a new tribe, one without rules, where the boys play and hunt all day. Soon, more follow until only a few, including Piggy, are left with Ralph. Events reach a crisis when a boy named Simon finds a sow's head impaled on a stick, left by Jack as an offering to the Beast. He becomes hypnotised by the head, which has flies swarming all around it. Simon goes to what he believes to be the nest of the Beast and finds a dead pilot under a hanging parachute. Simon runs to Jack's camp to tell them the truth, only to be killed in the darkness by the frenzied boys who mistake him for the Beast. Piggy defends the group's actions with a series of rationalisations and denials. The hunters raid the old group's camp and steal Piggy's glasses. Ralph goes to talk to the new group using the still-present power of the conch to get their attention. However, when Piggy takes the conch, they are not silent (as their rules require) but instead jeer. Roger, the cruel torturer and executioner of the tribe, pushes a boulder off a cliff which falls on Piggy, killing him and crushing the conch. Ralph hides in the jungle. Jack and his hunters set fires to smoke him out, and Ralph staggers across the smoke-covered island. Stumbling onto the beach, Ralph falls at the feet of a naval officer who stares in shock at the painted and spear-carrying savages that the boys have become, before turning to his accompanying landing party. One of the youngest boys tries to tell the officer his name, but cannot remember it. The last scene shows Ralph sobbing as flames spread across the island.

The realisation of this is seen as being the cause of Ralph's distress in the closing shots.Robert Wallace, Life Magazine 25 October 1963 Charles Silver, Curator in the Department of Film at MoMA, wrote that the film is \\"about anarchy and how that thin veneer we wear of what we refer to as ‚Äúcivilization‚Äù is threatened by the attractive clarion call of bestiality and its accompanying hatred\\". Production =Filming= The parents of those chosen are reported to have been provided copies of the novel, from which a commentary had been physically removed; those pages included describing the culmination of the hunt of a wild sow as an \\"≈ídipal wedding night\\". Brook noted that \\"time was short; we were lent the children by unexpectedly eager parents just for the duration of the summer holidays\\". The film was shot entirely in Puerto Rico at Aguadilla, El Yunque and on the island of Vieques. The boys in the cast were all non-professional, had mostly not read the book, and actual scripting was minimal; scenes were filmed by explaining them to the boys, who then acted them out, with some of the dialogue improvised. Life magazine journalist Robert Wallace visited them there and observed one of them amusing himself by feeding live lizards into the blades of a rotating fan. Wallace commented: \\"One could almost hear William Golding, 4,000 miles away in England, chuckling into his beard.\\" The 60 hours of film from the 1961 shoot was edited down to 4 hours, according to editor Gerald Feil. This was further edited down to a 100-minute feature that was shown at the 1963 Cannes Film Festival (9 to 22 May), but the cuts necessitated that new audio transitions and some dialog changes be dubbed into the film more than a year after shooting. The voice of James Aubrey, who played Ralph, had dropped three octaves and was electronically manipulated to better approximate his earlier voice, but it is still significantly different. Tom Chapin, who played Jack, had lost his English accent and another boy's voice was used to dub his parts. The U.S. distributor insisted the film be further edited to 90 minutes, so one fire scene and scenes developing the character of Ralph were cut. In 1996, Peter Brook organised a reunion for the cast members for a documentary film called Time Flies. Brook was \\"curious to know what the years had done to his cast, and what effect the isolated months of filming had had on their lives\\". Although none seemed damaged by their time working on the film, Simon Surtees, one of a pair of twin brothers who played Sam and Eric, \\"put his finger unerringly on the ethical dilemma. The problem is that most of us are not trained artists, so I now believe Peter runs the risk of abandoning us to our fate, just as he did in 1961, when he plucked us from our schools and our homes, put us on the island, then cast us back to live our lives as if nothing would ever change.\\" Tom Gaman, who played Simon in Brook's film, remembered that \\"although I didn't think much about it at the time, in hindsight my death scene scares me. It was night, the spears--those wooden stakes--were quite real. We were excited, brandishing flaming sticks around a bonfire on the beach in a real storm. I really did emerge from the bushes into the center of a raging crowd, screamed in terror, was stabbed by boys with sharpened sticks, and staggered to the water\\". Song The song, heard throughout the film, of the boys singing is Kyrie Eleison which, translated from Greek, means \\"Lord, have mercy\\". It is an expression used in a prayer of the Christian liturgy. Reception =Critical response= The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 91% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 22 reviews, with an average rating of 8.19/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 67 out of 100 based on 9 critic reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". PopMatters journalist J.C. Ma√ßek III wrote \\"The true surprise in Lord of the Flies is how little these child actors actually feel like 'child actors'. With few exceptions, the acting rarely seems to be forced or flat. This practiced, well-honed craft aids Brook‚Äôs vision of a fly on the wall approach that pulls the viewer into each scene.\\" Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times that \\"the picture made from it by the writer-director Peter Brook is a curiously flat and fragmentary visualization of the original. It is loosely and jerkily constructed, in its first and middle phases, at least, and it has a strangely perfunctory, almost listless flow of narrative in most of its scenes\\". =Accolades= Peter Brook was nominated for the Golden Palm at the 1963 Cannes Film Festival. The film was named one of the Top Ten Films of the year in 1963 by the National Board of Review. Home media The Criterion Collection released it on DVD and Blu- ray Disc in America and Canada.

This film is an extension of the book of the same name by Jack Shaheen, which also analyzes how Hollywood corrupts or manipulates the image of Arabs. The documentary analyzes 1,000 films that have Arab and Muslim characters, produced between 1896 to 2000, out of which great majority, 936 titles, were negative in their portrayal, arguing that the slander of Arabs in American filmmaking has existed since the early days of the silent cinema and is present in the biggest Hollywood blockbusters today. Jack Shaheen analyzes a long series of \\"demeaning\\" images of Arabs through his presentation of various scenes from different American movies which he has studied. He argues that this image is characterized by showing Arabs either as bandits or as a savage, nomadic race, or shows Arab women as shallow belly dancers serving evil, na√Øve, and greedy Arab sheiks. Most important is the image of the rifle in the hands of Arab \\"terrorists\\". The film then attempts to explain the motivations behind these stereotypes about Arabs, and their development at key points in American history, as well as why it is so important today. The film showed for the first time in Washington on 8 June 2007 and then in Los Angeles in the 20 June 2007. The run time of the film is 50 minutes, with Arabic and English subtitles. Soon afterward, the film was shown successively in more than a dozen of international film festivals between 2006 and 2009 The film's estimated budget is $100,000. Synopsis Shaheen speaks at the beginning of the documentary about the extent to which Arabs face slander and manipulation in Hollywood, commenting that he has formulated that view of his after having seen over a thousand films produced, in the past and in the present. He also talks about how bleak the views are, those of which are borne by the Western civilization (and he refers to it as our civilization), admittedly confessing how the views directly attack the Arabs' humanity. Furthermore, he mentions how the same image took shape in several patterns to feed the same substance that is continuously demonizing the Arabs, thus. The image had to repeat over and over and was depicted in scenes in several films that heavily abuse the Arabs' behaviors and morals. All through the documentary, Shaheen's statements are illustrated by clips from the films he describes. Shaheen reviews some of the images about Arabs he perceives as distorted, and argues this causes a process of feeding/poisoning the minds of the younger generations with these infected ideas about Arabs that characterizes them with such heinous and harmful descriptions as in the Disney motion picture, Aladdin. Shaheen also turns it around: what must viewers from the Arab world think of America and Americans when they keep seeing these images in American films? Shaheen also argues that the image of the Arab woman is distorted and does not represent her. Arab women in films are either bellydancers or faceless, anonymous shapes in black robes. More recently Arab women are also portrayed as terrorists. The truth is, they are just like all other women in the world: talented, intelligent, and equal in all areas and fields. Shaheen then argues that politics have a big role in affecting Hollywood's image about Arabs, and moreover, both Hollywood and politics feed and empower the other. He stresses that filmmakers openly acknowledge this interaction between Hollywood and American politics by citing Jack Valenti, longtime president of the Motion Picture Association of America: \\"Washington and Hollywood spring from the same DNA\\". Political and economic events like the crisis of high oil prices in the United States as a result of the Arabs refusal of exporting it to The States, the revolution in Iran (a non-Arab country) as well as Al-Qaeda activities, the events of 11 September and others, all exported a bad, faded image about Arabs to every American home... It is a truly a very distorted picture. Both the book and the film to reveal the American film scene history, where they exposed a blatant pattern of profiling to stereotype the Arabs and they also showed the similarity of this stereotype with the racist, anti-Semitic caricature and cartoon art throughout history. Alleging a political agenda, he says out of 1,000 films that have Arab and Muslim characters (from the year 1896 to 2000), 12 were positive depictions, 52 were neutral portrayals of Arabs, and 936 were negative. Although the negative imagery of Arabs and the Arab world in the film is a hundred years old, Shaheen also voices optimism about the future. Showing some examples of films that portray Arabs as ordinary people, he expects the negative images to change, due to the works of a new generation of filmmakers, who see things differently. =Arabs stereotypes reportedly found in movies= # The bad Arab character that is always evil and portrayed as a \\"terrorist\\" causing explosions, shootings, stabbings, offenses and attacks. # The shallow or silly Arab character that is always naive, pursuing only fun, lust, and extravagance. # The Bedouin Arab character, that is remotely far from civilization and science and is often accompanied by \\"tent\\" and \\"camel\\" images. # The arrogant Arab character that is very nervous, repressive of women, and the farthest possible from emotions or romance. =Films which reportedly depict these stereotypes include= *Invitation to the Dance - 1956 *Exodus - 1960 *Harum Scarum - 1965 *Cast a Giant Shadow - 1966 *Network - 1976 *The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington - 1977 *Black Sunday - 1977 *Chapter Two - 1979 *Raiders of the Lost Ark - 1981 *Rollover - 1981 *Never Say Never Again - 1983 *Sahara - 1983 *Cannonball Run II - 1984 *Protocol ‚Äì 1984 *Back to the Future ‚Äì 1985 *Young Sherlock Holmes - 1985 *The Jewel of the Nile - 1985 *Hell Squad - 1985 *The Delta Force ‚Äì 1986 *Iron Eagle ‚Äì 1986 *Death Before Dishonor - 1987 *Wanted: Dead or Alive - 1987 *The Taking of Flight 847: The Uli Derickson Story ‚Äì 1988 *Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade - 1989 *The Bonfire of the Vanities ‚Äì 1990 *Navy SEALs ‚Äì 1990 *Patriot Games - 1992 *Aladdin - 1992 *Son of the Pink Panther - 1993 *Bloodfist VI: Ground Zero ‚Äì 1994 *True Lies ‚Äì 1994 *Father of the Bride Part II - 1995 *Executive Decision - 1996 *Ernest in the Army - 1998 *The Siege - 1998 *The Mummy - 1999 *Rules of Engagement ‚Äì 2000 *Gladiator - 2000 *Black Hawk Down - 2002 *24 - TV series *Sleeper Cell - TV series *Homeland - TV series =Films which reportedly depict a positive image include= *Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves ‚Äì 1991 *A Perfect Murder - 1998 *Hideous Kinky - 1998 *The 13th Warrior ‚Äì 1999 *Three Kings ‚Äì 1999 *Kingdom of Heaven ‚Äì 2005 Cast Filmmaker information *Narrator: Jack Shaheen *Director: Sut Jhally *Producer: Jeremy Earp *Post-Production Supervisor: Andrew Killoy *Editors: Sut Jhally, Andrew Killoy, Mary Patierno *Additional Editing: Jeremy Smith *Sound Engineering: Peter Acker, Armadillo Audio Group *Media Research & Collection: Kenyon King, Bathsheba Ratzkoff *Subtitling: Jason Young *Arabic Translation: Huda Yehia, The Translation Center at the University of Massachusetts *Graphic Designer: Shannon McKenna *Additional Motion Graphics: Janet Brockelhurst *Production Assistant: Jason Young *DVD Authoring: Andrew Killoy, Jeremy Smith *Additional Footage Provided by: Mary Patierno, The Newsmarket.

The other end is apparently floating freely through spacetime, and matter and radiation can pass through the Rift, allowing extraterrestrial and extratemporal artifacts, and occasionally life-forms, to \\"wash up\\" in Cardiff.Torchwood Institute: The Rift , URL accessed 2006-10-30 It is described as \\"Unpredictable and elusive, it‚Äôs a gateway for alien creatures, alien weapons, all manner of alien technology and time anomalies to enter our world\\" and the \\"flotsam and jetsam of the universe since the dawn of time.\\"Torchwood Institute: What is the Rift? URL accessed 2006-10-31 The Rift has been featured in episodes of Doctor Who and is central to the spin-off series Torchwood, which concerns a branch of the Torchwood Institute created to monitor activity around the Rift. The Rift acts as a plot generator, providing a wide and potentially unlimited array of possible plots for the series, much like the Hellmouth in Buffy the Vampire Slayer and the Bajoran wormhole in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Appearances in the Doctor Who universe =Doctor Who= Boom Town\\" ‚Äî The extrapolator and the TARDIS begin to rip open the Rift The Rift first appears in the Doctor Who episode \\"The Unquiet Dead\\". This episode takes place in 1869, when the Gelth, gaseous humanoid organisms, pass through the Rift into a funeral parlour, where they are able to ‚Äúpossess‚Äù the corpses. It is established that the Rift releases radiation, prolonged exposure to which can grant psychic powers to people, including Gwyneth, a servant in the parlour. The Doctor speaks with the Gelth via Gwyneth in a s√©ance, where they claim to be few in number following the Time War, and ask for the Rift to be widened, allowing the remaining Gelth to live in the corpses. However, after the Doctor discovers that the Gelth are in fact far more populous than first claimed, and intend to slaughter the human race to provide themselves with inhabitable corpses, Gwyneth sacrifices herself by causing a gas explosion, which seals the Rift and apparently kills the Gelth. The episode \\"Boom Town\\", set in modern-day Cardiff, revisits the Rift. The Rift now runs through Roald Dahl Plass, and emits radiation which the TARDIS can harness for use as fuel. However, a member of the Slitheen crime family, Blon Fel-Fotch Pasameer-Day Slitheen, disguised as a woman named Margaret Blaine, becomes the elected Mayor of Cardiff and plans to build a defective nuclear power station on the Rift, which would then cause a nuclear meltdown. The resulting energy shockwave would destroy the planet, but allow Blaine to escape on a tribophysical waveform macro-kinetic extrapolator, described as a \\"pandimensional surfboard\\". The Doctor, Rose, Mickey Smith and Jack Harkness manage to foil her plan, but the extrapolator latches onto the TARDIS and causes the Rift to split open, which causes earth tremors across Roald Dahl Plass. The Rift is finally sealed by the TARDIS. The Tenth Doctor and Martha Jones briefly revisit the Rift in \\"Utopia\\" to refuel, treating it as a \\"pitstop\\". The Doctor revisits Cardiff to drop off Jack Harkness in \\"Last of the Time Lords\\". In \\"The Stolen Earth\\", the Torchwood Three team and supercomputer \\"Mr Smith\\" use the energy of the Rift to send a signal to the Doctor through the Medusa Cascade. Later, in \\"Journey's End\\" the Doctor uses the Rift - after Mr Smith has interfaced with the TARDIS to allow it to lock on properly - as a towrope to literally ‚Äùtow‚Äù the Earth back to its proper location in time after it was stolen by the Daleks. =Torchwood= Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang\\" ‚Äî the Rift before Captain John emerges. The Rift features regularly in Torchwood, with almost every episode involving material or life- forms which have passed through the Rift. The Torchwood Institute website suggests that Torchwood Three was formed in Cardiff as soon as the Torchwood Institute became aware of the Rift's presence.Torchwood Institute: Rift report , URL accessed 2006-10-30 Torchwood Three has also been described as merely a \\"monitoring station\\" for the rift.Torchwood Institute: Ianto Online Counselling session , URL accessed 2006-11-08 The website lists among the items found in the Rift \\"3 new Weevil clusters... [7] items of unknown provenance... 2 weapons... 2 EBEs\\". However, the Rift appears to be one-way; craft sent through the Rift have been unable to either return or to send back a signal. In \\"Out of Time\\", the Rift facilitates the misplacement of people on board a plane from 1953 to the show's present day. In the episode's conclusion, a temporal immigrant, feeling it will take her home or somewhere new, ventures back into the sky, with her ultimate fate left unclear. In \\"Captain Jack Harkness\\", the Rift is responsible for sending Jack and Tosh back to 1941. In the present day, Owen uses a \\"Rift machine\\" designed by Toshiko to open the rift and bring them back (this episode shows the Rift's event horizon properly for this first time). The consequences of Owen's actions resonate in the next episode, the first series finale \\"End of Days\\". By opening the Rift, he has allowed more \\"flotsam and jetsam\\" to come through, including a Roman soldier, a group of mediaeval plague sufferers, and even a large UFO. As Jack puts it, opening the Rift has caused the cracks in time to widen on a global scale. The time travelling Bilis Manger shows Gwen a vision of the death of her boyfriend Rhys, convincing her to open the Rift even wider to reverse the damage that has already been done. When this happens, the entity known as Abaddon rises from \\"beneath the Rift\\". Jack sacrifices himself to destroy Abaddon, and the Rift immediately closes. The team (including Jack, who has come back from the dead again thanks to his past experiences) still retains the memory of what happened, but some of the actual events have been reverted (such as Rhys returning to life), and Owen spearheads a minor clean- up mission.Torchwood Institute: Clean-up Operation A year later in \\"Exit Wounds\\", Jack's brother Gray has Captain John Hart widen the rift again to unleash chaos across Cardiff, unleashing monsters such as Hoix, Weevils and cowled ghouls from distant times and places. As a Time Agent, Captain John can use his wrist-strap vortex manipulator to travel to Cardiff through the Rift. In \\"Adrift\\", it is revealed that as well as depositing creatures and items in Cardiff, the Rift also takes people, depositing them anywhere in space or time. Gwen discovers that this is the cause of a drastic increase in the amount of missing people in the Cardiff area. The Rift, in an effort to right itself, often returns people again. However, they have often seen such graphic images that they develop mental illnesses. At the start of Torchwood: Children of Earth (2009), the Hub is destroyed and Torchwood relocate to London as fugitives. Torchwood itself is later destroyed by the end of the serial. Fans were left asking the fate of, among other things, the Rift. The subsequent 2011 series of Torchwood relocates primarily to the United States. When asked in an interview with SFX magazine, Davies stated \\"I like to think that when [subsequent Doctor Who executive producer] Steven Moffat so thoughtfully closed all those cracks in the universe, the Rift in Cardiff closed up at the same time. I used to wonder what the hell happened to that Rift and now it's all solved. When I watched those cracks seal up I was like, 'Oh, thank you.'\\" This refers to the events of the 2010 Doctor Who episode \\"The Big Bang\\", which was written by Steven Moffat. However, Torchwood media in 2011 since provided a direct explanation for the Rift. In the radio drama \\"The House of the Dead\\", Jack visits a haunted location where the Rift allows ghosts, including the deceased Ianto Jones, to enter into the living world. To close the Rift forever and seal an ancient evil on the other side of it, Jack creates a device designed to seal the Rift. The device will also provide Jack an end to his cycle of resurrections. However, Ianto's spirit tricks Jack into leaving, and detonates the device himself, closing the Rift \\"forever\\" and with it the barrier between the living and the dead. Other media In the Torchwood novel Border Princes by Dan Abnett, it is revealed that several other planets border permanent points where the Rift has anchored. One such planet has a similar organization to Torchwood entitled The First Senior, whose title for the Rift translates as The Stumble, The Misstep or The Border. When The First Senior heard of Torchwood, they inserted a Principal, a spy who could observe how they handle the Rift, purely for research into how other \\"Rift guardians\\" operate. Like all Doctor Who and Torchwood spin-off media, its place in canon is unclear. Attributes and effects The Rift has facilitated an underground Weevil infestation and allows for alien technology to wash up in Cardiff, which are sometimes acquired by Torchwood Three. Creatures have been known to pass presumably through time because of the Rift, including a pterodactyl. It can be used as a source of power for the TARDIS, perhaps replacing the Eye of Harmony. The landing of the TARDIS near the fountain in Roald Dahl Plass resulted in the ship's \\"perception properties\\" being welded to the Rift, creating a \\"perception filter\\" that prevents anyone outside that spot from noticing anything inside. In 19th-century Cardiff, Gwyneth developed telepathic powers as a result of lifelong exposure to the Rift. \\"Out of Time\\" suggests that the Rift can act as an unpredictable window through time in certain weather conditions. Much as the Rift deposits all things alien in Cardiff, it also takes; as a result of this Cardiff has an unusually high missing persons rate owing to humans scattered throughout space and time by the Rift. The destruction of a hospital in Cardiff caused the psychic energy of all the lives spent and lost there, in conjunction with the Rift, to cause 1918 and 2008 to begin to overlap in \\"To the Last Man\\". In April 1913, \\"preshocks\\" of the Rift's opening in \\"End of Days\\" manifested as ground tremors.Rift Memo, 1913 Before the dawn of time, as with the Beast, Biblical demon Abaddon had been sealed away in Earth, using the Rift as a means for his imprisonment. This suggests that it happened \\"before the universe's creation\\" as with the Beast, and that the Beast's captors, the \\"Disciples of Light\\" may have had a hand in the formation of the Rift as they did with the gravity field in \\"The Impossible Planet\\". The Rift is not dependent on Abaddon, however; in fact, Jack warns that it will be more violent than ever following his release. Similar anomalies In \\"Boom Town\\", the Ninth Doctor refers to the Rift in the plural, indicating that there are others elsewhere. In series 3 episode \\"The Sound of Drums\\" (2007), the Master (John Simm) also refers to the Doctor sealing the rift at the heart of the Medusa Cascade, deep in space. The Daleks later planned to make use of this rift in spreading their Reality Bomb (\\"Journey's End\\", 2008). When explaining the prevalence of foresight abilities in Pompeii, the Doctor explains Mount Vesuvius temporarily opened a Rift in time and space, which accounts for this, in the episode \\"The Fires of Pompeii\\" (2008). In the series 6 episode \\"The Doctor's Wife\\" (2011), the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith) travels through a time rift to a location \\"outside\\" the universe. He comments that his TARDIS should refuel by virtue of being exposed, as with the Cardiff rift, to temporal energies. Similar phenomena are encountered in other stories. For example, in Image of the Fendahl (1977), the Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker) encounters a \\"time fissure\\" in Fetch Borough in the West Country of England. Another \\"time fissure\\" located in the village of Foxgrove, Hertfordshire appears in The Temptation of Sarah Jane Smith (2008), a The Sarah Jane Adventures serial in which Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen) returns a time-displaced boy from 1951 through this fissure, and is tempted to use it meet her parents who died in her infancy. A \\"scar in time and space\\" in San Francisco featured in the 1999 Eighth Doctor novel Unnatural History by Jonathan Blum and Kate Orman. It was also created by the TARDIS malfunctioning (this time as seen at the end of the eighth Doctor's only television adventure) and also had the consequence of creating a hole in time which was a magnet to strange phenomena, including timeslips and creatures which appeared magical. In the Torchwood comic story \\"Shrouded\\" by Gareth David-Lloyd, John Hart reveals that he moved to Mexico to buy and sell alien artefacts because a \\"small rift\\" is located near the Gulf, which he uses as his \\"tube to work\\". Reception The Rift plot device has attracted some critical commentary. In Under Torch Wood, a one-off Torchwood parody for The Register (a dialogue in the style of Welsh poet Dylan Thomas' radio play Under Milk Wood), columnist Verity Stob derides the device as lazy writing on the part of Davies and his writing team, and comments on its large indebtedness to the Hellmouth from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Gwen asks \\"What is the Rift?\\"; the narrative voice describes it as \\"a kind of hellmouth that is sucking on a transcendental, transdimensional gobstopper. It is a double-egg MacGuffin served with large fries. It is . . .\\" an easy way for lazy writers to generate indulgence-straining plots, without ever troubling to think up anything new, or plausible, or to know or look up any science.\\" See also *Anomaly (Primeval) *Bajoran wormhole (Star Trek) *Boom tube *Nexus (Charmed) *Portkey *Stargate (Stargate) *Time portal References External links *More information on the Rift Category:Cardiff in fiction Category:Doctor Who locations Category:Torchwood Category:Wormholes in fiction ","title":"Cardiff Rift"},{"id":"7696827","text":"Sengiley () is a town and the administrative center of Sengileyevsky District in Ulyanovsk Oblast, Russia, located on the right bank of Kuybyshev Reservoir, south of Ulyanovsk, the administrative center of the oblast.

In 1780, it was chartered as the town of Sengiley; named for its position on the river then of the same name (now the Sengileyka, a tributary of the Volga), which comes from Erzya words syang, meaning tributary and lei, meaning river.–ï. –ú. –ü–æ—Å–ø–µ–ª–æ–≤. \\"–ì–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –Ω–∞–∑–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –º–∏—Ä–∞\\". –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞, 1998, p. 379.

The second edition is part one of a three-part series, entitled Firebird: A Trilogy. The protagonist is Lady Firebird Angelo, a wastling of the Naetai royal family. Wastlings are younger offspring of noble houses who are doomed to geis, or honorable suicide, so as not to upset the succession of their older siblings (and their children) to political power. Firebird disagrees with the actions of her government, but is compelled by honor to support it. Plot summary =First edition= Firebird is the third daughter of the Queen of Naetai and a military pilot. Because she is a wastling, an unwanted heir to the throne, she is considered expendable. Leading her tagwing fighter group of wastlings on a suicide mission as part of a venture to capture a Federate world outpost, she is captured by Federate colonel Brennen Caldwell, a telepathic intelligence officer seeking to capture an enemy fighter for interrogation. She attempts honorable suicide by poison for her failure, but Caldwell thwarts her medically. Under telepathic duress, her military and political knowledge is used by Caldwell to save the Federate outpost. Firebird begins to see the dishonorable tactics of her mother's government for what they are. Caldwell, in addition to being the most powerful Ehretan telepath of his generation, is the most senior telepath in a government that mistrusts them for their abilities. In addition to the government's mistrust of his people, Caldwell is questioned by his own people for his deep connection with Firebird. In her, he sensed a strong possibility of connaturality, a deep personality congruity that is essential for telepaths to have a successful relationship in marriage. Among his people there is a strong belief that, as the strongest telepath among them he should not marry outside his people, diluting the genes that allow their telepathy. Caldwell rejects his people's attitudes towards non Ehretans and continues his growing friendship with his prisoner, offering life and a future to one who believed herself as good as dead. Following Netaia's failure on Veroh, the queen is forced to honorable suicide and Firebird's sister Carradee ascends the throne. Caldwell is assigned to Naetai as the Federate representative and brings Firebird with him. While Carradee favors a conciliatory posture with the Federacy, their other sister, Phoena, secretly plots the overthrow of Federate occupation along with members of the nobility, by secretly building an ecological weapon of great power. After several political and military dangers are overcome by Caldwell and Firebird, they ignore his orders and carry out a special ops mission to destroy Phoena's research lab. Once all is settled, Firebird and Caldwell accept their relationship (over the continued objection of his people) and become engaged. =Second edition= Firebird is a military pilot assigned to a risky venture to capture a Federate world outpost. Because she is a wastling, she is considered expendable. Leading her tagwing fighter group, she is captured by Federate colonel Brennen Caldwell, a telepath who senses something special about her. She attempts honorable suicide by poison for her failure, but Caldwell thwarts her medically. Under duress, her military knowledge is used by Caldwell to save the Federate outpost. Firebird begins to see the dishonorable tactics of her people for what they are. Caldwell, in addition to being the most powerful Ehretan telepath of his generation, is also heir to religious prophecies among his people, and the most senior telepath in a government that mistrusts them for their abilities. Caldwell is promoted to general for his victory in the Veroh battle, as well as his diplomacy with the captured Firebird. In her, he sensed a strong possibility of connaturality, a deep personality congruity that is essential for telepaths to be married. As he has strong convictions against marrying outside his faith, and being barred from proselytizing, much of the book revolves around Caldwell trying to bridge the gap to Firebird by demonstrating the goodness of his spirit to her, offering life and hope to one who believed herself as good as dead. Following Netaia's failure on Veroh, Firebird's sister Carradee ascends the throne after their mother commits suicide, a tradition within the royal family. She favors a conciliatory posture with the Federacy. Their other sister, Phoena, secretly plots the overthrow of Federate occupation along with members of the nobility, by secretly building an ecological weapon of great power. After several political and military dangers are overcome by Caldwell and Firebird, they ignore his orders and carry out a special ops mission to destroy Phoena's research lab. During the climactic battle, when Caldwell has been incapacitated and his telepathic powers are not available, Firebird casts her faith to the Great Speaker who sang the universe into existence, and strengthened by this, overcomes great odds to successfully neutralize the weapon. The religious differences thus settled, the story ends with Caldwell proposing pair bonding (marriage) to Firebird.

It is a type of drum that uses a single large drumhead in order to create a loud, resonant sound when struck. The head can be tuned as loose as possible to avoid any sense of pitch in the sound, or tensioned more tightly to produce timpani-like tones. Gong drum in recordings Gong bass drums were first produced by Tama in the late 1970s, and have since been used by artists such as Peter Criss of KISS, Billy Cobham, Neil Peart of Rush, Stewart Copeland of The Police, Tim Alexander of Primus, Mike Portnoy of Dream Theater, Simon Phillips of Toto, David Silveria of KoRn, Aaron Gillespie of Under√∏ath, Dominic Howard of Muse, Zac Farro of Paramore, Budgie of Siouxsie and the Banshees. Pearl's similar suspended bass drums have been used by Chris Slade formerly of AC/DC, Todd Sucherman of Styx, and Joey Jordison of Slipknot.

During the Russian Revolution of 1917, he was involved in the Georgian independence movement. From 1919 to 1921, he served as a Minister of Education and then as a Defense Minister in the government of Noe Zhordania, a Menshevik leader of the Democratic Republic of Georgia. After the Soviet invasion of Georgia in 1921, he did not follow his fellow ministers into emigration and chose to stay in Georgia. Despite an amnesty granted by the newly established Bolshevik regime, he was arrested in May 1921, and deported to Suzdal where he composed his historical essay ‚ÄúThoughts on Georgia‚Äù (‚Äú·É§·Éò·É•·É†·Éî·Éë·Éò ·É°·Éê·É•·Éê·É†·Éó·Éï·Éî·Éö·Éù·Éñ·Éî‚Äù, 1922-1924). In 1925, he was moved to Kursk, where he was involved in educational activities and edited a local newspaper. In 1928, the Soviet authorities allowed him to return to Georgia and even consulted him on local affairs. Lordkipanidze, however, started to overtly criticize the forcible collectivization and the creation of the highly unpopular Transcaucasian SFSR in which the Georgian SSR was merged with Armenian SSR and Azerbaijan SSR. As a result, he was rearrested and redeported from Georgia. In 1929, he congratulated Joseph Stalin whose jubilee was pompously celebrated throughout the Soviet Union. The letter sent to the Soviet leader also contained harsh criticism of Stalin's policies, and hence he was rearrested and exiled to Siberia. During the 1937 Great Purges, he was summoned by Lavrenti Beria to Tbilisi to be interrogated as a \\"politically unreliable person\\". During the examination, he was subjected to extensive tortures and died on his 56th birthday on September 2, 1937. Lordkipanidze's family learned of his death only in the late 1950s, but the place of his burial remains unknown to this day. References *Zarkua, G.

Indeed, Harper moved away from the multilateral and internationalist policies of the Liberal Party, and reduced Canada's emphasis on the United Nations, peacekeeping, conflict resolution, and multilateralism. Harper's foreign policy has been described as \\"ideological\\", incoherent\\" and \\"diaspora-driven\\". Harper sought to strengthen cooperation with the United States, particularly in their War on terror. As part of this policy, his government continued and expanded Canada's participation in the US-led War in Afghanistan. Harper also led Canada in the Libyan civil war and the Syrian civil war. In parallel, Harper showed relentless support for Israel throughout his whole premiership. General aspects Commentators generally agree that Stephen Haper's foreign policy differed largely from his predecessors, some calling it a \\"Break\\" or a \\"Revolution\\". The switch essentially ended Canada's posture as a country encouraging peacekeeping, conflict resolution, multilateralism, and the post-war world order. There are, however, few defining aspects of Harper's foreign policy, outside of an increased interest in international trade and relentless support of Israel. This led University of Ottawa professor Roland Paris to reject the claim that Harper's foreign policy is ideological, and instead to argue it is instead \\"incoherent\\". Even at the 2013 Manning Conference, there was a consensus among foreign policy panelists that \\"the government, and the broader conservative movement from which it springs, don‚Äôt so much have a foreign policy as a vague foreign-policy vision, dressed up with a mish-mash of policy ideas.\\" According to Toronto Star commentator Eugene Lang, Harper's foreign policy had been \\"all war, no diplomacy\\". He points to the fact during Harper's premiership, \\"the Canadian Armed Forces have had their most active period in living memory\\". Indeed, Harper had increased Canadian presence in Afghanistan and took part in conflicts in Lybia and Syria. Lang argues that Harper overused the military and underused diplomatic channels to achieve Canada's goal of promoting peace. According to Andrew Nikiforuk of The Tyee, Harper's foreign policy should be analyzed as a tool used to shore up votes from different immigrant community groups within Canada which can swing elections in certain districts. Nikiforuk points to Harper's denunciation of human rights abuses in Sri Lanka as a way to win the support of Toronto's Tamil community. He also notes that Harper's support for Israel \\"through fire and water\\", as he told the Knesset, helped him win the support of the majority of Canadian Jews in the 2011 federal election. This was a community that reliably voted for the Liberal Party in previous elections. Nikiforuk concluded that Haper had a \\"Diaspora-driven foreign policy\\".  Relations with the United States  Stephen Harper and George W. Bush hold a joint press conference at the White House on July 6, 2006 Relations with the United States are always a central issue in Canada, and the period prior to Harper's premiership was criticized by Kim Richard Nossal for \\"the lamentably awkward and embarrassingly public handling of the continental relationship.\\" She blames Canadian politicians for \\"firing off verbal pot‚Äêshots at American expense ‚Äì a temptation to which they have succumbed even when they have been perfectly aware that their doing so can serve no useful Canadian purpose, much less exert a constructive influence on American behaviour.\\" In contrast, during the 2006 election campaign, Harper promised to improve relations with United States, blaming the previous Liberal government of damaging the relationship due to inappropriate comments made towards the George W. Bush administration. However, shortly after being congratulated by George W. Bush for his victory, Harper rebuked U.S. Ambassador to Canada David Wilkins for criticizing the Conservatives' plans to assert Canada's sovereignty over the Arctic Ocean waters through an increased presence by the Canadian Forces. =U.S. Ambassador= On February 16, 2006, Harper named former Progressive Conservative Party Cabinet Minister Michael Wilson as Governor General Micha√´lle Jean's appointee to the post of Canada's Ambassador to the United States, replacing Liberal appointee Frank McKenna. Wilson stated in his first press conference as Ambassador that \\"Softwood lumber is clearly at the top of the heap, the top priority.\\" =First meeting with U.S. President Bush= Harper's first meeting with the U.S. President occurred on March 30, 2006; and while little was achieved in the way of solid agreements, the trip was described in the media as signaling a trend of closer relations between the two nations. Harper told the press that he used \\"colourful language not suitable for public television\\" when pressing President Bush privately over his opposition to a U.S. law that will require Canadian citizens to show their passport when crossing the border into the United States. Bush reported that Harper was \\"a very open, straightforward fella.... If he's got a problem, he's willing to express it in a way that's clear for all to understand, and that's the way I like to deal with people.\\" The two would later meet in July at the White House. =Softwood lumber dispute= On April 27, 2006, Harper announced in Parliament that the government had reached a seven-year agreement with the United States in the nations' long-standing feud over softwood lumber. Trade Minister David Emerson had vowed since its post-election defection from the Liberals to the Tories to deal with the issue as soon as possible while Ambassador Wilson mentioned it as its first priority. The three major softwood-producing provinces‚ÄîBritish Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec‚Äîaccepted the compromise. Leader of the Opposition Bill Graham and NDP leader Jack Layton did not, criticizing the deal for not requiring the U.S. to pay back all $5 billion it had collected in tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber. On September 12, 2006, the Canadian and U.S. governments officially signed the deal in Ottawa ending the dispute. Still, it was subject for a confidence vote in the House of Commons during the fall session. The deal would likely have passed with the support of the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois. On September 19, the House voted in favor of the deal 172 to 116 in first reading which eliminated its final hurdle until its official realization However, Canada has not fully complied to all conditions of the deal before October 1, 2006, the deadline date for both countries to comply. =NORAD= In 2006, following a debate and vote in the House of Commons, the Harper government renewed the NORAD (North American Aerospace Defense Command, initially created in 1957) agreement with the United States, making it permanent and adding maritime defense to the agreement, which previously covered only air defense. The additional coverage was a response to the increasing threat of mass terror attacks, and scenarios that included maritime dimensions. The NDP, which traditionally takes a pacifist position and has historically been opposed to Canadian participation in NORAD, was highly critical of the agreement, arguing that the arrangement will reduce Canadian sovereignty over the country's internal waters. =Anti-ballistic missile defense= Previously, the federal government under PM Brian Mulroney decided against participation in the U.S. led anti-missile defense system which was designed to intercept foreign missiles armed with nuclear weapons. This program, known as the Strategic Defense Initiative, was started by President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. As part of the effort to improve cooperation with the US, Harper reopened the issue, and agreed to a free-vote on the participation of Canada. =Arctic lands and waters= Harper declared in early 2006 that the Arctic waters that are located between the Canadian islands of the Nunavut and Northwest territories belongs to Canada. However, U.S. officials, including newly named U.S. Ambassador to Canada David Wilkins, said that those waters were in neutral territory. During the summer of 2006, Harper went to the Arctic region in Alert, Nunavut to defend the country's northern sovereignty not only for the neutral territory issue but also due to the greater attention given by foreign countries in regards of the land's wide variety of resources. In addition, the government planned to continue funding new military ships and additional personnel to patrol and defend the northern waters. In 2008, he added that Canada should extend its jurisdictional reach to up from the current On August 10, 2007, Harper announced that a new Army training centre will be built in Resolute Bay as well as an increase of military personnel while a new military port will be built in Nanisvik. In addition, Harper announced $720 million for the construction of a new icebreaker that will be named after former Prime Minister John Diefenbaker and will be in operation in 2017. U.S. President George W. Bush, Mexico's President Vicente Fox and Canada's Prime Minister Stephen Harper, right, stand in front of the Chichen-Itza archaeological ruins Thursday, March 30, 2006. =Passport and border security= Pe√±a Nieto, and U.S. President Barack Obama, 2014 In 2007, the United States government adopted the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative as part of the anti-terror measures adopted after the 9/11 al-Qaeda terror attacks. This law went into effect in 2009, and required all Canadian and American citizens to use a valid passport in order to enter the United States by land or water, supplementing the earlier requirement for air-travelers. Canada's Ambassador to the U.S. Michael Wilson expressed concerns that the accelerated implementation could cause problems for businesses and travelers. (Wilson previously said in an interview on CTV's Question Period in July 2006 that the economy would not be greatly affected by the new measure, but the Federation of Canadian Municipalities continued to express concern.) Several provincial premiers including Ontario's Dalton McGuinty, New Brunswick's Shawn Graham and Manitoba's Gary Doer lobbied U.S. contacts in order to propose alternatives to the passport, such as dedicated digital identify documents. As a result of the new US policy, the demand for passports grew rapidly, creating a backlog which caused lengthy delays. The government then adopted measures to speed up the process. In 2006, the Harper government announced several enhanced border security measures, including a plan to equip security personnel with weapons in order to be able to act effectively against suspects, including those carrying firearms, near the border (on either side). The guards had requested the weapons in a previous negotiation. The Harper government budgeted over $C100 million for additional staff to patrol borders, including 400 new officers. =Maher Arar= On January 26, 2007, the government announced a compensation worth $11.5 million to Syrian-Canadian Maher Arar due to an error from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The RCMP was blamed for giving misleading information to U.S. officials and suspected him as a possible terrorist threat and a member of the Islamic terrorist group Al-Qaeda. He was arrested in New York in 2002 and later deported to Syria where he was tortured in a Syrian jail. The government also gave official apologies. Public Safety Minister Stockwell Day criticized the U.S. authorities for not removing Arar on a terrorist watch list based on information from the CIA. U.S. Ambassador to Canada David Wilkins replied that Canada must not dictate to the United States on who is not allowed in the country. =First meeting with Barack Obama= Harper with US President Barack Obama on February 19, 2009 Harper met for the first time, newly sworn US President Barack Obama on February 19, 2009, at the Parliament. During the short meeting, the war in Afghanistan, the struggling economy, fears of protectionism and the environment were the main topics discussed. The Americans did not ask Canada to extend the mission in Afghanistan beyond 2011. Both leaders agreed that the two countries should adopt a shared approach on the ongoing global economic slowdown, as well as tackling the global warming. A \\"clean-energy dialogue\\" was also created and Harper told Obama that the plan would commit: \\" senior officials from both countries to collaborate on the development of clean energy science and technologies that will reduce greenhouse gases and combat climate change\\". War in Afghanistan =Deployment in Afghanistan= The Canadian government has participated in the war against terrorism since the September 11 attacks in the United States. Later that year, the government deployed troops in Afghanistan to combat the Taliban regime, which was ousted by the coalition forces. Canadian troops have remained in the area to assure security and peace, as Taliban insurgencies were frequent in the following months. So far, 133 Canadian soldiers and a diplomat (as of December 25, 2009) have been killed in Afghanistan, with most of the fatalities occurring in 2006 and 2007 as Taliban attacks have become more frequent and more violent. Since the Conservative government was elected in 2006, several of the key members of the Cabinet, including Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Foreign Affairs Minister Peter MacKay, Minister of National Defence Gordon O'Connor and Minister of International Co-operation Josee Verner have visited the region in support of the troops or for rebuilding projects. Defence Chief of Staff Rick Hillier also visited the troops in Afghanistan in December 2006. On a two-day visit in Afghanistan in early January 2007, MacKay mentioned that there was an optimistic future in the country despite the Taliban resistance and violence. He mentioned that Canada and its military is heavily contributing to the redevelopment and reconstruction of the area and that several major projects and programs are currently underway including infrastructures and micro-credit programs. He also announced funding for both aid worker groups and for developing security in Afghanistan, including developing the police force. He added another $200 million in aid on February 26, 2007, for the reconstruction. In October 2007, Maxime Bernier and Bev Oda, who were named respectively the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation during the summer of 2007, pledged an additional $25 million in food aid for the Afghan people in the areas affected by the Taliban militant presence. =Mission extension= In early 2006, the Conservative government proposed a motion to extend the Canadian military mission in Afghanistan by two years. In May 2006, the House of Commons passed a motion, after a six-hour debate, to extend the mission until 2009 by a slim 149-145 majority. On April 24, 2007, a Liberal motion to withdraw troops by 2009 was defeated 150‚Äì134, by the Conservatives and the NDP. The NDP wanted an immediate withdrawal of the troops. Former Defence Minister Gordon O'Connor stated that troops may be needed until 2010. Peter MacKay, who've in a cabinet shuffle replaced O'Connor following heavy criticism of the latter's handling on the mission, stated that the government is willing to continue the mission until Canada \\"finish the job\\" without exactly mentioning a specific date on the end of the mission although later mentioned that the decision must be made by April 2008. On October 12, 2007, Harper announced an independent committee that to review Canada's role in Afghanistan. The committee was headed by former Liberal Cabinet Minister John Manley and recommendations by the panel will be giving at a later date. Other members of the Committee includes former CBC journalist and anchor Pamela Wallin, the former CEO and president of the Canadian National Railway and Bombardier, Paul Tellier, former Conservative Minister Jake Epp and former chief of staff for Brian Mulroney and ambassador to the United States, Derek Burney. The Prime Minister mentioned four possible options to be examined by the committee, including focusing on the reconstruction effort, withdrawing the troops in 2009, ensuring enough training for the Afghan police and military for a possible withdrawal in 2009 or displace the area of operation to another region outside of Kandahar. The panel later suggested in a 90-page document that an extension to the mission is necessary but with an emphasis on diplomacy, training and reconstruction with the deployment of 1 000 new soldiers specializing in training the Afghan police and army forces. During the Throne Speech on October 16, 2007, the government made word that they want to extend the mission until 2011 after finishing the training of Afghan military and police officers in which it mentions that it would be impossible to conclude by 2009 although a vote would be proposed on the issue. While the Throne Speech passed, General Rick Hillier mentioned that the mission could take another 10 years at least before training and re-building the Afghan army, thus 6 years further than the new proposed deadline for the end of the mission. A confidence mention is scheduled for Spring 2008. Meanwhile, Defense Minister Peter MacKay told at a NATO summit in Lithuania in February 2008 that more NATO members should contribute to the Afghan Mission. =Flag policy= The Harper government, with the support of veterans groups such as the Royal Canadian Legion, re-instituted a policy of lowering the national flag at military installations such as Department of National Defence headquarters only, drawing some criticism that the government was showing a lack of respect for the soldiers. Previously, the flag was lowered at the Peace Tower of Parliament Hill. =Harper's speeches on Afghanistan= In a televised speech on September 11, 2006, five years after the attacks in New York City and Washington D.C., Harper linked the events of that day with the current mission in Afghanistan, and encouraged continued support for Canada's military efforts against the Taliban. During another speech this time at the United Nations Assembly in New York on September 21, he asked the organization for help and mentioned that the crisis \\"is a test of the world body's relevance\\" and being the UN's most important test and mission for it. =Opposition= The Canadian public is divided in opinion on regards to the necessity of the mission. A survey in late October 2006 showed that a slight majority of Canadians approved of the mission despite an increase of casualties from Canadian troops over the previous few months. However, the number of casualties increased rapidly in 2006 and 2007, the percentage of Canadians opposed increased significantly. The province with the strongest opposition was Quebec. A June 2007 Journal de Montr√©al poll conducted after the first Quebec casualties in the mission showed that nearly 70 percent of its population were opposed to the mission, while it was 53 percent in a March poll. The Quebec City area that includes CFB Valcartier, at which are based most of the Quebec troops assigned for the mission, had the strongest support for the mission, but were also in majority opposed. Among the opposition parties, the New Democratic Party has asked on multiple occasions that the government withdraw the troops, but was the only party that was fully against the project. The Bloc Qu√©b√©cois had previously asked about an emergency debate in the House of the Commons which was refused by the Conservatives. On December 12, 2006, the Bloc's Deputy Leader Michel Gauthier told the media that the party had even considered introducing a confidence motion on the mission that could topple the government. The Liberal Party and its newly elected leader St√©phane Dion mentioned that they would not topple the government on that issue. In 2007, the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois pressured the government to officially end the mission by 2009 and in September threatened to vote against the Throne Speech if the government did end the mission in that year as the House of Commons voted. Harper replied that the government would not comply with the Bloc's demand (along with four others) and pressured the Liberals on the issue, who are more in favor for the conclusion of the mission in 2009, while the NDP kept their same position as the year before. However, Dion, in the midst of a turmoil inside his party following poor results in the September by-elections in Quebec and stagnant support across the country, said that the Liberals would listen to the Throne Speech before deciding on whether or not they will defeat the government. Harper said that it was up to the opposition to defeat the government and force new elections just under 2 years after the 2006 elections. The mission received support from the United States and the Bush administration. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, in a meeting with Peter MacKay praised the efforts of the Canadian troops, notably their courage and sacrifice. In addition, NATO had also asked the country to extend its mission beyond 2009. =Military spending= Harper had promised that he would increase the size of the naval fleet as well as increasing the overall number of soldiers. In the 2006 budget, the Canadian Forces received an additional $5.3 billion over five years. Defense Minister Gordon O'Connor had later requested additional funding of 15 billion dollars to acquire fleets of helicopters and aircraft, such as the Boeing Chinook helicopter, the Boeing C-17 Globemaster plane, and the Lockheed Martin C-130 Hercules aircraft. He later announced that new Leopard 2 Tanks would be added to the fleet replacing the older Leopard C2 vehicles by the summer of 2007. Most of the equipment would provide operational support for the soldiers currently serving in Afghanistan. This new equipment would be in addition to new Sikorsky H-92 helicopters requested by the previous government's defense minister Bill Graham. The Royal Canadian Navy has been especially stretched, with the 2013 incident leaving Canada with no air defense or command and control in the entire Pacific Ocean. While under the previous Liberal government the time needed to purchase equipment had dropped to only 89 months, under Harper this delay has grown to 199 months. This was partially due to the year after year defense spending cuts. =Detainees abuse claims= In April and May 2006, when concerns surfaced over the fate of individuals detained in Afghanistan by Canadian soldiers and given into Afghan custody, Defence Minister Gordon O'Connor claimed that the Red Cross or Red Crescent would supervise the handover and treatment of detainees and notify Canada if any problem occurred. This was later denied by the International Committee of the Red Cross, after which O'Connor apologised for misleading the House. On April 23, 2007, The Globe and Mail reported that 30 Afghan detainees had been tortured after handover to Afghan authorities. The government responded that they will investigate over the matter but mentioned that Canadian soldiers were treating them properly. However, opposition members called for O'Connor's resignation.  Middle East Policies  In parallel to realigning Canada's relationship to the United States, which critics of the Liberal governments argued had become tainted by a counter-productive hostility that ignored basic shared democratic principles, the Harper government reexamined policy in the Middle East in general, and regarding Israel in particular. The so-called \\"Arabists\\" in the Department of Foreign Affairs lost influence, and many left, including Ambassador Michael Bell. In addition, the concepts of \\"even-handedness\\" and \\"balance\\" were seen as lacking a core moral foundation and commitment to democracy that had long been central to Canada's foreign policy. In part, this change was reflected in the effort to restore traditional Canadian support for the reestablishment of the traditional Jewish nation-state of Israel, the only transparent democracy in the Middle East. The Harper governments emphasized their commitment to supporting Israel's right to self-defence. =Israeli- Palestinian negotiations= Following the collapse of the Oslo peace efforts in 2000/1, and the wave of Palestinian mass terror and Israeli responses, the Liberal government had become increasingly identified with European sympathy for Palestinians and criticism of Israel, in strong contrast to the US and the George W. Bush administration, which blamed Arafat and ended contact with him. Referring to Canada's self-described role as a \\"middle power\\" which was \\"trusted\\" for being fair-minded and even-handed, the government under Paul Martin sought to play a role as a mediator, but with no positive impact. In the process, Canada lost the trust of the Israeli government, which objected to what it viewed as a moral failure of Europe as well as Canada, in the wake of mass terror and suicide bombing that took over 1000 Israeli lives, with many more injured. This relationship was further damaged by Canada's leading role in sponsoring and funding the 2001 UN Durban anti-racism conference, which was used as a platform by Palestinians and others for antisemitism and attacks seeking to isolate Israel internationally as an \\"apartheid state\\". The Harper government reversed many of these positions, re-establishing traditional Canadian support for Israel as a beleaguered democracy. In United Nations votes related to Israel, the Palestinians, and related issues, which almost always went against Israel, reflecting the large bloc of votes from the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), Canada generally joined the US, Israel, Australia and a few other countries in principled opposition. PM Harper also announced that Canada would not participate in the Durban Review Conference, and that, in contrast to the antisemitic NGO Forum that took place in the initial conference in 2001, no Canadian taxpayer funds would be spent in support of this event, which was again expected to be exploited by radical groups for anti-Israel campaigning. In a joint statement, ministers Bernier and Kenney noted that the original 2001 Durban conference \\"degenerated into open and divisive expressions of intolerance and antisemitism that undermined the principles of the United Nations and the very goals the conference sought to achieve.\\" Although they \\"hoped that the preparatory process for the 2009 Durban Review Conference would remedy the mistakes of the past\\", the evidence showed that \\"the process was too flawed to make the conference worthwhile.\\" Similarly, Harper declared that \\"Canada will not lend its name and reputation to an international conference that promotes ... scapegoating the Jewish people.\\" He added that Canada \\"will participate in any international conference that combats racism. We will not, however, lend Canada‚Äôs good name to those, such as Durban II, that promote it.\\" When evidence surfaced that the framework known as Rights and Democracy, which was funded by government budgets, had defied this policy, an investigation was undertaken, and in 2012, the organization was shut down. Canada was the first to take this principled position and was later joined by the US under President Obama, Australia, Italy, Germany and other democratic governments, thereby enhancing the Harper government's leadership role on these issues. In December 2008, the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations presented Stephen Harper, and his government with its inaugural International Leadership Award. Malcolm Hoenlein, the executive vice-chairman of the organization, stated that the award was given to express the group's appreciation for Canada's \\"courageous stand\\" including regarding the Durban Review conference. He also praised Canada's \\"support for Israel and [its] efforts at the U.N. against incitement and ... the delegitimization [of Israel], where they have taken a role in the forefront.\\"Presidents Conference to honor Harper , Jewish Telegraph Agency (JTA), December 4, 2008. On other aspects of the conflict between Palestinians and Israel, the Harper government followed a policy based on realism, in contrast to the idealism of previous governments. In 2006, the Conservatives responded to the successes of the Hamas terror group in 2006 legislative elections by reducing funds. (Hamas is categorized as a terrorist organization by Canadian authorities.) Foreign Minister MacKay did meet with Palestinians in the West Bank but not with any members of Hamas, as Canadian diplomats are not allowed to negotiate with terrorist groups. In January 2007, on a two-day mission in the Middle East, Foreign Affairs Minister MacKay met Israel Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and with Palestinians. According to media reports, the talks covered a number of issues, including the Israeli security barrier constructed following numerous Palestinian mass terror attacks. MacKay stated that it was justified due to security reasons, and could be removed if peace efforts succeeded. In 2012, Canada joined the nations (including the US) that opposed the campaign to avoid peace negotiations and promote unilateral recognition of Palestinian statehood at the United Nations. = Israel-Lebanon conflict = At the outset of the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict, which began with the Hezbollah terror group's attack across the international border, Harper defended publicly Israel's \\"right to defend itself,\\" and described the Israeli response as \\"measured\\". Harper stated that Hezbollah and Hamas's release of Israeli prisoners (Hezbollah held the bodies of two dead Israeli soldiers who were killed in the initial attack) would bring an end to the conflict. On July 17, 2006, Harper noted that the situation had deteriorated since his initial comments, but that it was difficult for Israel to fight \\"non-governmental forces\\" embedded in the civilian population. Harper reiterated his earlier support for Israel and called on both sides to show restraint and minimize civilian casualties. The Canadian government made arrangements to evacuate about 30,000 Canadians, mainly of Lebanese descent, from Lebanon after hostilities broke out. The response was criticized as slow and inefficient. Foreign Affairs Minister Peter MacKay had defended the response mentioning that the capacity of the ships were limited. Foreign Affairs Minister Peter MacKay joined Harper in reiterating support for Israel's position and urging restraint while calling for a ceasefire. Speaking of the situation in both Lebanon and Gaza on July 18, Harper told reporters, \\"We all want to encourage not just a ceasefire, but a resolution. And a resolution will only be achieved when everyone gets to the table and everyone admits... recognition of each other,\\" referring to the refusal of Hezbollah and Hamas to recognize Israel's right to exist. Harper laid the blame for the civilian deaths on both sides at the feet of Hezbollah. \\"Hezbollah's objective is violence,\\" Harper asserted, \\"Hezbollah believes that through violence it can create, it can bring about the destruction of Israel. Violence will not bring about the destruction of Israel... and inevitably the result of the violence will be the deaths primarily of innocent people.\\". In August 2006, Peterborough MP Dean Del Mastro announced a visit to Lebanon with the National Council on Canada-Arab Relations, along with members of the Opposition parties. However, shortly before his departure, Del Mastro canceled his trip citing security reasons. Other international issues =Darfur Conflict= Canada has also participated in the failed peace efforts in the Darfur region of Sudan where a bitter conflict since 2003 has killed nearly a quarter- million people. The Conservative government announced on March 1, 2007, an additional funding of $48 million in order to assist the African Unionpeacekeeping efforts as well as giving the population affected by the conflict access to urgent needs. Since 2003, more than $190 million were pledged by Canada, as well as shipping humanitarian goods to the Darfur region. While announcing the funding, MacKay had also expressed concerns in regards to the civil rights violation record of the country and had requested a ceasefire. On September 28, 2006, during a speech at the summit of the Francophonie, Harper called on the United Nations to take a bigger role on the conflict in order to help the \\"desperate\\". =Policy regarding foreign capital punishment= In November 2007, Canada's minority Conservative government reversed a longstanding policy of automatically requesting clemency for Canadian citizens sentenced to capital punishment. The ongoing case of Alberta-born Ronald Allen Smith, who has been on death row in the United States since 1982 after being convicted of murdering two people and who continues to seek calls for clemency from the Canadian government, prompted Canadian Public Safety Minister Stockwell Day to announce the change in policy. Day has stated that each situation should be handled on a case-by-case basis. Smith's case resulted in a sharp divide between the Liberals and the Conservatives, with the Liberals passing a motion declaring that the government \\"should stand consistently against the death penalty, as a matter of principle, both in Canada and around the world\\". However, an overwhelming majority of Conservatives supported the change in policy. In a 2011 interview given to Canadian media, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper affirmed his private support for capital punishment by saying, \\"I personally think there are times where capital punishment is appropriate.\\"Tasha Kheiriddin: Tori Stafford case shows why Canada needs the death penalty Accessed March 2012: \\"Prior to the 2011 election, when asked about the subject in an interview by the CBC‚Äôs Peter Mansbridge, Prime Minister Stephen Harper said, 'I personally think there are times where capital punishment is appropriate.'\\" \\"So how do Canadians feel about the death penalty? Shortly after the Prime Minister‚Äôs interview, Abacus Data published a study finding that 66% of Canadians support the death penalty \\"in certain circumstances.\\" =North Korea= In 2006, the Conservative government joined the US and many other countries in condemning the nuclear tests conducted by the North Korean regime of Kim Jong-Il, in blatant defiance of the 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Peter MacKay also strongly supported the imposition of sanctions by the United Nations Security Council such as trade restrictions on goods and arms as well as trade embargoes. Prior to the nuclear test, MacKay also condemned a North Korean missile test in July 2006, and called the country a major threat for the stability of the East Asian region. Harper stated that, \\"the fact that (North Korea) is prepared to arm itself and prepared to threaten to use such armaments... is something that we should be gravely concerned about\\" During the APEC summit, Canada sent a diplomat to focus on the North Korean nuclear threat. =AIDS= The City of Toronto hosted an international summit on AIDS, a worldwide issue which also affects Canada. Health Minister Tony Clement represented the government; Stephen Harper didn't attend the summit due to issues surrounding the Canadian Arctic region. This drew heavy criticism from organizers. Immediately after the conference, Clement didn't announce any further Canadian funding or measures for fighting the disease, \\"because it was becoming difficult to have a rational discussion.\\" However, he did add that the country had significantly increased its financial support. On World AIDS Day, December 1, 2006, Canada had announced a 250-million dollar pledge over a two-year period for the fight against AIDS and promised a 10-year 450 million dollar funding to African countries. Stephen Lewis a UN Special Envoy had requested funding of 30 billion dollars by the G8 countries including Canada by 2010 On February 20, 2007, Harper, along with Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, announced a total of $139 million in new funding for the Canadian HIV Vaccine Initiative. The federal government will contribute $111 million while the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will commit an additional $28 million. =Relations with China= As the economic level of the People's Republic of China progressed rapidly during the 1990s, the Canadian government concluded several economic and partnership deals with the country. However, when the Conservative government took power in 2006, relations between the two had changed most notably due on the question of human rights in the People's Republic of China in which the Conservative government had criticized its records. Meanwhile, President Hu Jintao criticized Canada for making the Dalai-Lama an honorary citizen and to make several meetings with him. The monk made his latest visit in October 2007 where he met with Harper, the first time a Canadian Prime Minister meet with the spiritual leader. Secretary of State and MP Jason Kenney denied that the meeting will cause harm to trade relations between the two countries despite threats from the Chinese governments due to the meeting in which the Chinese Foreign Ministry called it \\"gross interference in China's affairs\\". In addition, Hu also criticized the government about its accusations over China's human rights record and denied any kind of abuse of it in his country. Before the APEC summit in November 2006, the issue of human rights was a hot topic on Harper's agenda. He discussed the issue in Vietnam with Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung where there have been also criticism on the country's respect of rights. At the APEC summit in Hanoi, Vietnam, Harper met with Hu, after tensions between the two countries nearly called off a scheduled meeting between the two leaders. There were no official reports of discussions on the issue of human rights, but Harper had urged that the relations between the two countries needs to be built. In January 2007, while on a business trip to the People's Republic of China, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty, had vowed to improve relations between the two countries and also promised to discuss firmly the issue of human rights. Trade Minister David Emerson also announced a \\"China strategy\\" in which there will be funding (which will be announced in the 2007 budget) for developing this strategy. Following a period of violence and unrest in Tibet in March 2008, the Prime Minister as well as MP Pierre Poilievre has called again the country respect human rights and show \\"restraint\\" in the Tibet uprising. The government did not discuss the possibility of a Canadian boycott of the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics. Harper cited that it would be premature to discuss that possibility and added that Canada would send high-ranking representatives to opening ceremonies while monitoring the situation in China before the Games. In 2008, former prime minister Jean Chr√©tien had criticized Harper for missing opening ceremonies for the 2008 Beijing Olympics; in response, Dmitri Soudas, a spokesperson for Mr. Harper, called the remarks hypocritical, pointing out that Chr√©tien \\"attended one of six Olympic opening ceremonies during his 13 years as Prime Minister. In 2009, Harper visited China. During the visit Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao publicly scolded Harper for not visiting earlier, pointing out that \\"this is the first meeting between the Chinese premier and a Canadian prime minister in almost five years\\"; Harper in response said that, \\"it's almost been five years since we had yourself or President Hu in our country.\\" =Kosovo Independence= On March 18, 2008, Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Maxime Bernier issued a statement that recognized the Independence of Kosovo, which became a separated country from Serbia in February 2008. The Serbian Embassador filled a protest against Canada's decision to recognize the newly sovereign nation. The Serbian Ambassador to Canada, Dusan Batakovic cited that it might renew the independence movement in Quebec. Harper rejected the Kosovo and Quebec comparison, and replied that the Kosovo situation was unique because \\"The situation that evolved there was a situation of war (and) terrible suffering by the Kosovars.\\" Harper also noted that Kosovo's independence had already been widely recognized by at least 30 countries, including most members of NATO alliance. =Bid for seat on the UN security council= On October 12, 2010, a vote was held for temporary seats on the UN Security Council for a two-year term beginning on 1 January 2011. Canada contested for one of two seats against Portugal and Germany. Germany won a seat in the first round. Canada's vote declined significantly in the second round and it withdrew from contention giving the seat to Portugal. It was the first time in the history of the UN that Canada has sought a seat and lost. The opposition Liberal and New Democratic parties blamed Harper's foreign policy, particularly as it relates to the environment, for the loss. =Office of Religious Freedom= Harper at Gurudwara Khalsa Diwan in Vancouver with Narendra Modi in 2015 The establishment of the Office of Religious Freedom to protect freedom of religion internationally was announced during Harper's 2011 election campaign. On February 19, 2013, the office was officially opened and Harper announced that academic Andrew P.W. Bennett would be its first ambassador. =2014 Ukraine-Crimea crisis= The crisis brought on by the fall of Viktor Yanukovich, President of the republic of the Ukraine until 22 February 2014, saw the secession of Crimea during the week of 16 March become a significant factor in Canadian politics. For example, the House of Commons voted unanimously on a 3 March motion by Ted Opitz, with cross-party support provided by Peggy Nash and Ralph Goodale,Cross party support was important to this motion; Opitz (CPC), Nash (NDP) and Goodale (Lib) were all senior Parliamentarians. to censure Russia as follows: > That this House strongly condemn Russia's provocative military intervention > in Ukraine; call upon Russia to withdraw its forces and respect the > territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine, as per the commitments in > the 1994 Budapest Declaration and under international law; reaffirm the > legitimacy of the Government of Ukraine and Ukraine's territorial integrity; > support the Government's decision to recall Canada's ambassador in Moscow > for consultations and to suspend the Government's engagement in preparation > for the G-8 Summit; encourage the Government to work with like-minded > partners, including through multilateral forums, to de-escalate the current > situation; affirm the Ukrainian people's right of self-determination, free > from intervention; and stand with the Ukrainian people as they pursue a free > and democratic future. In addition, the Ukrainian flag was flown atop Parliament on 4 March. After the Crimean secession, Harper was the first Western leader to visit the new Ukrainian government of Arseniy Yatsenyuk the weekend of 22 March, and led the rest of the G8 partners at an ad-hoc meeting in Brussels on 24 March to suspend Russian membership, partially, said Harper because Russia had violated the Budapest Agreement > on the basis of an explicit Russian guarantee of (Ukrainian) territorial > integrity. By breaching that guarantee, President Putin has provided a > rationale for those elsewhere who needed little more than that already > furnished by pride or grievance to arm themselves to the teeth. Harper also announced he would restart free-trade talks with Ukraine, a show of support for the country's new leadership. Ukrainian-Canadians make up roughly 3.3% of the population of Canada. Russia was quick to respond through Parliamentary channels as there could no longer be discussion through diplomats, and on 24 March, Alexander Romanovich, deputy chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the Duma, stated that \\"We will never give up Crimea. Crimea is Russia.\\" Romanovich, who saw the influence of the Ukrainian- Canadian community, said Canadian actions in response to the Crimea crisis were unnecessarily provocative, and that Russia would match each round of sanctions with new measures of its own, as they had just sanctioned 13 Canadian Parliamentarians, government officials and the head of the Ukrainian- Canadian Congress the previous day. \\"Our relations with Canada are not just unconstructive, they‚Äôre poor. Canada stopped military relations with Russia, and so one or two people who were over there teaching got sent home. It‚Äôs ridiculous. These sanctions are a way of waging war without weapons. To use sanctions is to be belligerent.\\" Harper's visit to Europe the week of 23 March cemented his reputation as the leading hawk among G7 nations and the most zealous ally of a new Ukraine government considered wholly illegitimate by Putin. In Berlin on 27 March Harper said that \\"Notwithstanding all of our efforts to make Mr. Putin a partner, he has not desired to be a partner. He has desired to be a rival.\\" Angela Merkel was more conciliatory and was > quite relaxed ‚Äì let‚Äôs put it that way. We‚Äôre trying through talks and also > through announcing what we‚Äôre going to do, we‚Äôre trying to win the other > side over to pursue a course where it is allowed [for] Ukraine to take its > own sovereign political decisions. It is not as if all of these decisions > need to be against Russia but that Ukraine is in position to make its own > decisions: For example, free and fair elections, elect a president ‚Ä¶ and to > pursue trade and economic links with all of those partners they wish to > have. This is a very simple demand and a very clear demand. Harper said he believes that Russians, and in particular the younger generation of Russians, share the values of the West and want to be partners. He said the view of most Western powers is that they will some day have \\"common interests and the projection of common values on the international scene.\\" On 20 March, the Ukrainian government called for all guns to be turned in. French Ambassador Alain Remy said that this was a central requirement for the European Union to begin disbursing financial aid. Ukrainian Prime Minister pro-tem Arseniy Yatseniuk suggested that gun owners might join the National Guard. Dmitri Yarosh, the Right Sector leader said that \\"It‚Äôs not normal to ask people to hand in their weapons in the situation we have now.\\" Canadians have had their own debate over the federal gun registry, which had been cancelled by the Harper government a few years earlier. High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton stressed the need to \\"hand over any unauthorised arms to the authorities immediately,\\" in the wake of a protest on 26 March at the parliament building, to pressure lawmakers to sack the newly appointed Interior Minister Arsen Avakov because the Right Sector group believes that Avakov is personally responsible for ordering what they call a political assassination of one of their leader, Aleksandr Muzychko, who was killed in a special operation in a city of Rovno the previous evening. On 28 April, the Harper government announced further economic sanctions on nine additional Russians and two Russian banks amid escalating tensions over Ukraine. Travel bans are also being imposed on the nine individuals. This was done in concert with the US, which imposed escalating sanctions of its own, including export licence applications for any high-technology items that could contribute to Russian military capabilities. The US Commerce and State Departments revoked any existing export licences that meet these conditions.G+M: \\"Canada, U.S. launch new Russian sanctions over Ukraine crisis\\" 28 Apr 2014 Tit-for-tat economic sanctions had begun in March 2014. On 30 April, a frigate was sent to the Baltic sea, in support of NATO allies there. The combined involvement on this day of the Canadian Armed Forces stood at the frigate , and in Romania six CF-18 fighter jets, one C-17 heavy lift plane, one Airbus troop transporter, one Airbus airborne refueler, and an estimated 250 military personnel, as well as three military personnel on the ground in the Ukraine as part of the ill-fated OSCE mission, while the German press reported the next Sunday that CIA and FBI personnel were in Kiev to advise the Ukrainians on their security structure.AFP: \\"CIA, FBI agents 'advising Ukraine government': report\\" 4 May 2014 RCAF Lieutenant-General Yvan Blondin was in charge of the mission. An expert in conflict studies at the University of Ottawa, Professor Philippe Lagasse, remarked that the opposition parties in Parliament had been silent on the gradual deployment to the area of military forces, and was perplexed at the lack of a take-note debate: \\"I‚Äôm a little baffled by the fact that this is occurring and the opposition seems to have no real inclination to debate the issue.\\" On 4 May, the Harper government extended the sanctions regime to 16 more Russian \\"entities\\", while the same weekend saw more than 50 people killed in Odessa and Donetsk. Odessa is approximately 100 km from the frontier with Romania, site of the Royal Canadian Air Force mission. Sergei Lavrov warned of \\"fratricidal conflict\\", while Putin was \\"extremely concerned\\" about phone calls asking for help. On 19 June, Defence Minister Rob Nicholson stated, in reply to a Parliamentary question, that, over the previous two weeks, Canadian fighter jets had been scrambled twice to ward off Russian bombers. A Russian spokesman in Ottawa, Andrey Grebenshchikov bemoaned the state of communications between the two nations, which occurred when the Harper government unilaterally ceased all contact between them. This occurred in light of the revelations of a similar incident over California.

Swedenborg almost exclusively wrote in Latin, but his work did have a significant influence on others for centuries to come.Gustafson, pp.110-112Algulin, pp.47-51 In the 18th century, Latin accelerated its decline in favor of the national language. One of the first proponents of producing material for a general public was the botanist Carl Linnaeus (1700-1772). Later key figures included the poet Johan Henrik Kellgren and the songwriter and performer Carl Michael Bellman.  Bellman  Carl Michael Bellman (1740-1795) is one of few Swedish 18th century characters who has never lost the appreciation of common people. He was born in Stockholm and lived there for most of his life. Education did not turn out well; instead he became interested in pleasurable activities. He made himself a reputation as a cheerful poet and singer-songwriter.Algulin, pp.54-61 Bellman's two principal works are Fredman's Epistles (\\"Fredmans epistlar\\") in 1790 and Fredman's Songs (\\"Fredmans s√•nger\\") in 1791, each comprising some 80 songs. A striking theme is the freedom with which his main characters display themselves: they drink anywhere at any time, and make love anywhere at any time. All the same, death is always lurking around the corner.Algulin, pp.54-61  Notes and references  * Algulin, Ingemar, A History of Swedish Literature, published by the Swedish Institute, 1989. * Tigerstedt, E.N., Svensk litteraturhistoria (Tryckindustri AB, Solna, 1971) Category:Swedish literature Category:18th- century literature ","title":"Swedish enlightenment literature"},{"id":"7697074","text":"Sutton is an area of St Helens, Merseyside, and Ward of the metropolitan borough of the same name. The population of the ward taken at the 2011 census was 12,003. Historically within Lancashire, it is one of the four townships along with Eccleston, Parr and Windle that formed the municipal borough of St Helens in 1868. History St Theresa of the Child Jesus church in Sutton Manor The old Township of Sutton included: Sutton Village, Ditch Hillock, Peasley Cross, Marshalls Cross, Clockface, Sutton Manor and Sherdley and totalled 3,752 acres. The exact derivation of Sutton is uncertain. It is thought the township took its name from 'Sudtun', old English for southern enclosure or south town and was likely to have been the southern portion of a Saxon thegn's estate. Before the Conquest of 1066 AD, Sutton was held by King Edward the Confessor and located within the Royal Forest of West Derby. This extended from Burtonwood to Crosby and in the 12th and 13th centuries, Sutton became part of the Barony of Widnes. Along with fourteen other townships including Windle, Parr and Eccleston, it became part of the large ecclesiastical parish of Prescot and its rich seams of coal, which were first discovered in Sutton Heath around 1540, transformed it from an area of moorland and forest into an area of mining. Transport There are two railway stations in the area. St Helens Junction, and Lea Green both operate services to Liverpool and Manchester. Sutton Manor Colliery Sutton Manor was one of the largest pits in the Lancashire Coalfield, the deepest of the two shafts going over into the earth. They were filled in shortly after closure using large diameter limestone, around 30,000 tons from Holme Park Quarry in Carnforth then capped with three-metre thick reinforced concrete plugs over the two shafts, with venting pipes for methane. Landmarks A tall sculpture, called Dream, is now sited at Sutton. People and culture The popular St Helens Show or St Helens Festival as it had been rebranded on its final years, took place in Sutton each July at Sherdley Park, adjacent to The Sutton Academy. The three-day St Helens Centenary Festival was held in the park in 1968. It marked a hundred years since the town became a borough and was then the largest event ever held in St Helens. The festival went so well that it was decided to hold a similar event each year. This was called the St Helens Show and was renowned as the largest free show in Europe. From 2007 to 2010 it was reinvented as the two-day St Helens Festival before being axed by St Helens Council.

The Red O-Letter-Logo of the Opera Browser  Currently supported features  This section describes the features currently available in Opera. = Snapshot tool = In Opera 49, developers added a snapshot tool with editing features. = VR player = Opera is the first web browser to provide support for 360-degree videos to be played directly into virtual reality headsets. = Page zooming = Opera offers full page zooming.Zooming in Opera Instead of just making the text bigger, this feature expands all page elements, including text, images, videos, and other content such as Adobe Flash, Java and Scalable Vector Graphics to be increased or decreased in size (25% to 500%). Extensions may also be used to do this and to enable high contrast coloured fonts. Full page zooming prevents inconsistencies that occur when regular text enlargement forces the content to be bigger than its container. Zooming can be done using multi-touch pinching gestures on supported platforms. = Task Manager = Since Opera is based on Chromium, the Chromium-Browsing-Task Manager, as known from Google Chrome, is also a part of Operas Feature Range. This is not part of the legacy features of Opera 12.17. = Download manager = Opera allows the user to pause, resume or restart the transfer of files. It also keeps the history of downloaded files and allows opening them or the folder where the file has been downloaded to from within the browser.Download manager in Opera When a download starts a pop-up and a button will appear at the top right part of the interface to show the progress. = Image loading setting = Opera offers the option to load a page without images, or to use only images already in the web cache.Images management in Opera This might be useful if a user is connected on dial up via modem or on a slow wireless/cellular connection that may charge for the amounts of data downloaded. = Mouse gestures = Since: Opera 5.10, released April, 2001. Users have the option of accessing common browsing functions with combinations of mouse movements. Mouse gestures work by holding the right mouse button, moving the mouse a certain direction, then releasing the button. This option is similar to using keyboard shortcuts, as it saves time because users do not have to navigate to graphical buttons using the mouse pointer (thereby avoiding usability problems relating to Fitts' Law). Some of the default mouse gestures include: * Back - right-clicking anywhere and dragging the mouse towards the left. * Forward - right-clicking anywhere and dragging the mouse towards the right. * New tab - right-click and dragging down. * Close tab - right-click and making an L-shape movement (drag down, then right). * Zooming - holding down the CTRL key and scrolling the mouse wheel. Scrolling up enlarges the page by 10% increments, and vice versa. * Flip back and forward A.K.A Rocker gestures - hold the right-click mouse button and click left, and vice versa. = Pop-up blocking = Opera lets the user control whether web sites can open pop up windows. By default Opera blocks all unrequested pop-ups and the behavior may be set on a per-site basis. Windows that have been blocked may be later opened at the user's discretion. = Search engines = Since: Opera 4, released June 28, 2000. Opera provides quick access to a variety of search engines and commerce sites, via the use of search plugins. The user can type the search string in the address field and it will display search suggestions for supported websites. Many search plugins are included with the browser, but they can also be user- defined or installed from external sources. Since Opera 9, a user can right- click a search field on a website and select the \\"create search\\" option to add it as a custom search engine. Additionally, with this function a user is able to translate a paragraph or look for the meaning of a word directly for example. The user can select the desired search engine via a list or by using keywords in the address field. Example: Opera has a pre-set keyword for using the Google search engine: \\"g\\". Therefore, if a user types \\"g wikipedia\\" directly into the address field, Opera performs a Google search for \\"wikipedia\\". Other keywords are included, including \\"b\\" for Bing, \\"y\\" for Yahoo! Search, and \\"w\\" for Wikipedia. Users can also customize their own keywords. = Speed Dial = Since: Opera 9.2, released April 11, 2007. A Screenshot of the Speed Dial Page on Mac OS Opera 9.20 introduced \\"Speed Dial Browsing\\". When a new tab is opened, the blank page is replaced with a page with slots which the user can set to contain webpage bookmarks. This feature is based on the speed dial browsing previously introduced in Opera Mini. New versions of Opera's Speed Dial improved the feature by allowing an unlimited number of speed dial entries, Speed Dial extensions, introducing groups, real- time search of entries, added support to user-defined backgrounds and different resolution display layouts (e.g. widescreen). Users are able to save all the tabs in a window as a Speed Dial group, manage the saved links, and open them all later if wished. = Opera Turbo = When the Opera Turbo mode is enabled, Opera compresses requested web pages (but not HTTPS secure pages) by up to 80%, depending upon content, before sending it to the user. This process reduces the total amount of data sent and is particularly useful with slower Internet connections, making pages load faster, or when there are restrictions or costs dependent upon the amount of data transferred. This technique is also used in Opera Mini for mobile telephones. Around April 2019, Opera removed this functionality in its desktop browsers and it's no longer supported on desktop. The fate of it on its mobile browsers is uncertain. = Tabbed browsing = Since: Opera 4, released June 28, 2000.Opera: Opera version history. Opera Software. Accessed September 7, 2009 Opera supports tabbed browsing. This means multiple web pages can be opened within the same application window. The tabs can be managed in a tab bar (opening, closing, rearranging, etc.). The user is given options to perform actions such as cloning a tab with its complete history or pinning it. Notably, the part of the tab which displays a page's favicon is used as the indicator of the page loading progress. Also, open tabs can be previewed by hovering your mouse above the tab. This can be disabled through the settings menu. = Private browsing = Opera 10.50 introduced a privacy mode, which allows users to surf the web without leaving traces of the browsing session in that special window. = Recently closed pages access = Since: Opera 7, released January 28, 2003. Opera allows the user to retrieve all of the tabs or windows closed earlier in the current session from a list. Closed tabs can be recovered in the reverse sequence in which they were closed, by default this is achieved via the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Shift + T. Users can also access recently closed tabs from other devices synced to their Opera account, including tablets and phones. = Extensions = Since: Opera 11, released December 16, 2010. Starting with version 11, extensions are supported in Opera. Extensions allow adding functionality to Opera easily and currently share most APIs with the Chromium extension model. Developers can easily create extensions using open standards (HTML5, CSS, JavaScript) and specific extensions can be created to function as Speed Dial items. = Password manager = Every page with a password form gives the user the option of storing the password for later use. To speed up the use of the website, when a user re-visits these pages, the username and password fields will be already filled in. = Safer address field = Opera applies domain highlighting, hides the complexity of long web addresses by hiding the query strings and instead of displaying the protocol it displays a badge you can click to see a security assessment for any particular page being visited, including information about available SSL or TLS certificates. This tool is directly tied to NetCraft and Phishtank (citation needed for the latest version), thereby serving as a phishing filter as well as real-time fraud protection. = Standards support = See the History of the Opera web browser article to learn about the progression of standards support in Opera. = Standalone installation = Since Opera 11, the installer gives you the option to install the browser as a \\"Standalone Installation (USB)\\" which doesn't make any modifications to the system it's executed on.  Legacy featuresOpera: Neu, Sch√∂n, √úBerfl√ºssig - German PageOperas Changes: Chromium Striked and Changed everythingOpera 15 Launched: First ImpressionsOpera 12 Security Update  The Legacy Opera logo before Opera's codebase switched to Chromium and layout engine to Blink This section describes the notable features that have been available in older versions of the web browser. Many of these features were removed when Opera switched from its legacy layout engine, Presto, to the Chromium-based Blink engine. Presto was introduced in Opera 7, in 2003, and was used until Opera 12.18, in 2016. = TooltipsLegacy Opera Feature: Tooltips l = Tooltips were small information boxes. These boxes displayed some additional relevant information. Some features of them were: * Displayed the filesize and the progress of the page that was loading * Hovering your mouse cursor above buttons on the address bar would provide you some information about the button's purpose inside of a small box. For some buttons, it would also display a combination of keystrokes, that you'd have to press to execute the same action. You could disable the tooltips. = BB-Code-Keystrokes = You were able to make text be bold, italic and _underlined_ by adding [B][I][U]-Tags around the selected text. If no text was selected, the text would appear where the mouse was. = Usability and accessibility = Opera was designed to run well even on low-end and small computers, and with a commitment to computer accessibility for users who may have visual or mobility impairments. It is possible to control all main functions of the browser using only the keyboard, and the default keyboard shortcuts can be modified. Opera also supports the use of access keys to allow a computer user to immediately jump to a specific part of a web page via the keyboard. Opera was also one of the first browsers to support mouse gestures,Building a better computer mouse, Evan Hansen, October, 2002, retrieved on October 30, 2005 allowing patterns of mouse movement to trigger browser actions, such as \\"back\\" or \\"refresh\\". = Bookmarks = In Opera 15, the classic bookmark functionality was supplanted by an improved Speed Dial and the introduction of the Stash feature. Many users did not find this to be adequate, and bookmarks returned in a later version = Fit to width = A \\"Fit to width\\" feature that relies on technology similar to Opera Mini's Small Screen Rendering (SSR), allowing websites to fit within a smaller screen resolution without the need for horizontal scrolling. = Content blocker = Content Blocking can be used to block any content on a page, including images, plug-ins (like Flash), videos, scripts, styles, and other resources. To block content, a user must right click on the page, and click \\"Block Content\\". It's then possible to simply select the elements you wish to block. Users can also control how much they want to block expand using URL's with wildcards and such. Opera stores its content blocking URL list in a file called urlfilter.ini. Several internet sites provide a regularly updated urlfilter.ini already loaded with the web's most common advertisements so users can block ads using the built-in feature. The users are able to sync the content blocker list using Opera Link. = BitTorrent = The ability to transfer files via a built-in BitTorrent client was introduced in Opera 9, released June 20, 2006. = Hotclick = Since: Opera 6, released December 18, 2001 Hotclick refers to double-clicking any word in a page and having it to open the context menu instantly, which in Opera includes commands for searching the selected text in search engines and built-in translation, encyclopedia and dictionary services. In addition to this, the Hotclick menu also gives access to the 'copy', 'copy to note' (Opera 7 and later), and 'Send by email' functions. = Mouse gestures = Opera used to offer some mouse gestures that are no longer available in the latest version as of now, for example: * Scroll through tabs - hold right mouse button and roll wheel to cycle through the open tabs. * Clone tab - right-click, drag down then up = Panels = Some tools relating to browsing and email functions are organized within Opera Panels. Users can add additional tools by downloading or creating their own. Examples of tools installed by default: * Bookmarks - lists all the bookmark folders and the bookmarks they contain. * Mail - serves as access point for email accounts, folders, labels and news feeds. * Contacts - email address book. * History - provides a log of all pages accessed. * Links - list of links available in the current page. * Notes - displays all the notes folders and the notes they contain, it allows the user to edit pure text notes. * Info - displays page-specific information, including its MIME type, local cache, size, security information, and encoding. * Windows - provides management for all the tabs and windows open. * Transfers - simplified view of the download manager. = Full text history search = Since: Opera 9.5, released June 12, 2008 Words typed in the address field perform full-text search in the browser history. This allows a user to find a page previously accessed by searching by part of the text of its content. = Sessions = Since: Opera 4, released June 28, 2000 Discontinued: Opera 32, released in September 2015 Opera used to allow the user to save all the open tabs and windows as a session. This set of pages could then be reopened later as they were previously organized or inserted into the current window. Opera could then also be set up to start with one of the saved sessions. A saved session includes the history of each tab and the settings each one had, such as scrolling position, images on/off, etc. Since version 32 this can only be achieved with a combination of Speed Dial and Bookmarks, which is clumsy, or more elegantly by installing a session manager extension. = Tabbed browsing features = The tabbed browsing features that have been available in the older versions. * MDI: tabs can be resized, moved, tiled, and cascaded like normal application windows in the operating system. * Tab-stacking - Since version 11.0, dragging one tab over another allows you to create a group of tabs. * Option to have the tab bar displayed on one of the sides of the window or at the bottom. - set to return in an upcoming version. = Opera Mail = In addition to the web browser, the other main component in the desktop versions of the Opera suite is the Opera Mail e-mail client. Opera Mail supports regular POP and SMTP mail as well as IMAP. It also has an Address book. Opera Mail also features a newsreader and a newsfeed reader for RSS and Atom, as well as an IRC client for online chat. (RSS Reader/News Client now available is moden opera) = Opera Link = Since: Opera 9.50, released June 12, 2008. Opera Link allowed users to synchronise their bookmarks, Speed Dial, notes, personal bar, custom search engines, typed history and the content blocker list across multiple computers and mobile devices (such as a copy of Opera Mini running on a mobile phone). Furthermore, the bookmarks, notes, and Speed dial can be accessed through a web interface at https://web.archive.org/web/20140402163944/https://link.opera.com/loginfront/. Opera Link servers have been discontinued on December 14, 2015, after leaving only a month to users to backup their bookmarks one by one. User's data synchronization support is confirmed to return in an upcoming release, but users on Symbian, J2ME and BlackBerry will not have access to it. = Customization = Users have the option of defining the appearance and functionality of every item on the UI with the exception of the minimize, maximize/restore, and exit buttons. Personal preferences for toolbars buttons and menus can be arranged with drag and drop, while access to .ini files allows one to create, define, or redefine buttons, menus tools and functions.  Skins  Opera supports customized user interface skins, allowing users to change the style and size of toolbars, buttons and menus. A drag and drop functionality allows the user to easily place links and buttons on toolbars. The user is able to install custom skins, ranging from color changes to OS mimics. Opera allows the user to use animated GIF images in custom skins.  Toolbars  Opera provides toolbars that display different menus and buttons. For example, the \\"start\\" toolbar is a drop down toolbar which can be enabled to provide access to history and bookmarks when the user focuses the address field. Additionally a \\"view\\" toolbar includes multiple shortcuts to control the page exhibition and a find in page tool, a \\"navigation\\" toolbar can show commands to navigate through webpages, etc.  User JavaScript  Since: Opera 8, released April 19, 2005. Opera supports User JavaScript extensions. Those scripts execute when pages are loaded and are used to enhance site functionality. UserJS.org was the unofficial central repository for Opera User JavaScripts, but it's currently inactive. Userscripts.org lists scripts designed for the Greasemonkey Firefox extension, but many of them also work with Opera. Users may find useful user scripts shared at Opera's Community forums. As of the latest version, extensions can make up for the need for UserJS. = Widgets = Opera Widgets are small standalone applications sitting on the desktop that use the browser's rendering engine. Widgets were phased out starting with Opera 12. = Privacy and security = Opera can be configured to use proxy servers. It has a built-in cookie editor and web cache viewer. Also, the password manager integrated into the browser let users set a master password to protect against unauthorized tampering or access to stored passwords in the password manager. Users have full control over data supplied to the W3C Geolocation API. = Private Tabs = Introduced in Opera 10.50, users could open a private browsing session in a tab in the current window, instead of a separate window. Private Tabs would not record browsing history, use the web cache, or stored passwords, and forget any information accessed in the Tab when it is closed. This feature was replaced by Private Windows in Opera 15. = Developer tools = In version 9.5, in 2008, Opera introduced Dragonfly, a debugging tool similar to Firebug and developer tools found in other browsers, that allows debugging of the HTML DOM, JavaScript, CSS, and more. A user can set breakpoints and watches, alter scripts on-the-fly, execute statements in the current environment from a console, and audit page resources and local storage. Opera Dragonfly also allows debugging from a personal computer a webpage opened on a handheld or other device. Dragonfly is written using standard web technology and the Scope protocol, and source is available under the Apache License 2.0. Opera Dragonfly is compatible with Opera products using Presto 2.1 and later. The first stable version of Opera Dragonfly was released on 5 May 2011. = Compatibility = Common compatibility problems are caused by websites not following standards or using methods for detecting the browser being used. To cope with outdated detection methods or poorly built websites, Opera enables users to change the information that is sent to websites to identify what kind of browser is being used‚Äîknown as the user-agent. In previous years, Opera came preconfigured to partially \\"cloak\\" itself as Internet Explorer, but still included the word \\"Opera\\" in the user-agent information allowing the browser to be counted in web browser statistics. As websites modernized themselves and Opera 9 became more compatible with IE code, Opera began to use its own identification by default. Later versions of Opera offered a limited method of cloaking allowing selection from a pre-defined range of options including Mozilla and Internet Explorer. If needed, Opera can mask completely as Internet Explorer or Mozilla, leaving out the reference to Opera in the UA string and JavaScript objects. Some sites test only for objects that are not present in Opera. The version 8 of Opera introduced a further provision for dealing with faulty coding, by providing a set of scripts in BrowserJS that rewrites known broken pages as they are being opened. The closely related UserJS (similar to Mozilla's Greasemonkey), allows users to run their own code at various times in the processing of a page. These techniques have allowed many popular but incompatible sites to be used fully with Opera. Opera periodically updates itself with the latest version of BrowserJS and override_downloaded.ini files to keep more sites working correctly in the browser, respectively, they serve to patch websites which would otherwise have issues to run on Opera and to cloak the UA string by default for some website domains. = Other Features = * Save Browsing history forever until manual deletion. (Chromium-Based browsers do erase old history automatically) * Show page loading progress in the address bar (Size; Percentage; Number of loaded and total elements)  References  Opera Category:Opera Software Category:Web browsers Category:Computer accessibility ","title":"Features of the Opera web browser"},{"id":"7697076","text":"Kataysk () is a town and the administrative center of Kataysky District in Kurgan Oblast, Russia, located on the Iset River northwest of Kurgan, the administrative center of the oblast.

It is Ottawa's oldest active movie theatre, operating since 1932. It operates as an independent repertory cinema. The theatre's programming includes independent, second-run and classic films. It is noted for its double features and for frequent screenings of cult films such as The Rocky Horror Picture Show and The Room. Description Interior of Mayfair Theatre The Mayfair is a surviving atmospheric cinema of the Spanish Revival form, the second theatre house of this kind to be constructed in Ottawa. Interior features include four faux-balconies, two of which feature clay-tile canopies. Other significant features include stained-glass windows, a proscenium arch, a painted ceiling, decorative plastering and wrought ironwork. The Mayfair has retained the theatre clock used since its inception, a unit which features blue illuminated numbering. History =1932 to 1970s= Fred Robertson, a retailer from Almonte, was the Mayfair's original owner. The Mayfair opened on 5 December 1932 with its showings of The Blue Danube. Adult admission prices were 15 cents for matinees, 25 cents for evening performances, with each child admitted for ten and 15 cents respectively. After The Blue Danube completed a three-day run, the Mayfair presented its first double bill with Bring 'Em Back Alive and X Marks the Spot. At the outset, the theatre's sound system was supplied by Northern Electric while Montreal-based Canadian Theatre Supply provided the projection and stage equipment. For the first half century of its existence, the cinema remained under Robertson family ownership. The theatre later operated as a second-run cinema for numerous years. In the late 1970s the Mayfair concentrated on pornographic films, a phase which lasted less than two years. =1980s= In October 1981, the Mayfair adopted a repertory format and in the following month Keith Davidson became theatre manager. The Mayfair became known for its economical double features which were introduced in June 1982 for five days each week, excluding Sundays and Mondays when Chinese- language films would be presented. The Mayfair's ownership then consisted of several investors, most of whom were Ottawa-based. The Mayfair cancelled a planned showing of Videodrome in April 1983 when police threatened the theatre with obscenity charges. A handful of citizens, including Maude Barlow, objected to the violent content of the film which was approved by the Ontario Board of Censors and was previously shown without incident in Nepean, Ontario. Director Michael Rubbo rented the theatre for three days in early 1986 to conduct a \\"four-waller\\" promotion for his film The Peanut Butter Solution which had fared poorly in the English Canadian market. In 1986, major renovations resulted in new concession stand and box office spaces, while 492 wider seats replaced the original set of approximately 600 seats. In 1988, the Mayfair's regular admission price was $5, or $3.50 for those with theatre memberships which were available for $5 per year, or $3 per year for students. During that time, membership numbered more than 5000. =1990s= Double features became available on all days as of 1 April 1990 as the Chinese- language films were discontinued. Sunday afternoon double features were also introduced at that time. Regular prices for the double features were $5.50, or $4 for those who obtained a $6 annual membership. Featured films were predominantly hit American productions with a minority of classic and international films. Tom Bergin became manager in the early 1990s when Davidson left to pursue other interests. =2000s= In August 2008, local media indicated that the theatre would close effective 30 November 2008, the date at which the theatre would terminate its membership program. The City of Ottawa declared the theatre building as a heritage site under the Ontario Heritage Act on 8 October 2008, a designation which prohibits outright demolition of the building. Public and community concern over the closure of the Mayfair and interest in its heritage value resulted in the formation of the Friends of the Mayfair Theatre, a loosely organized community group that claimed several hundred members. In November 2008, a new partnership consisting of filmmakers Lee Demarbre and Ian Driscoll, projectionist and film conservator Paul Gordon and film scholar John Yemen announced that they had signed a ten-year lease with owner Stephen Ng. The new owners renovated the facility with new seating, some couches in the balcony, a digital video projection system, a new 16mm projector, a Dolby Digital sound system for the 35mm projectors, and a long play tower system. Seating capacity was reduced from 492 to 343. The Mayfair reopened on 2 January 2009 with the film Metropolis accompanied by short subjects from local filmmakers. The theatre's reopening was accompanied with a renewed emphasis on its repertory role. During this relaunch month, thirteen Ottawa premieres were presented while double bills were now limited to Tuesday nights and occasionally other nights. Midnight screenings on Friday and Saturday nights were also introduced. In July 2009 two of the founding members of the new partnership, John Yemen and Paul Gordon left the group to pursue other projects. John Yemen was the individual who sent the city a proposal for heritage designation in the summer of 2008. The makeup of the partnership is now Lee Demarbre (programmer), Ian Driscoll, and Josh Stafford. =2010s= Currently, the Mayfair's programming includes cult films, family matinees, independent films, Ottawa premieres, local films, festivals, and late night presentations. It also became the main venue for the Ottawa International Writers Festival in spring of 2010, hosting readings and lectures. The theatre also reports continued success with its annual Halloween screenings of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. =Mayfair Orleans= The Mayfair opened a three-screen cinema in Orleans on 2 December 2011. It was situated at the former Empire Six theatre facility. This location presented similar programming as the original Mayfair location, with some emphasis on family-oriented films. The Mayfair Orleans location closed on 13 February 2013 when its lease was cancelled due to arrears in rent.

He was the eldest son of Eustace Grenier and Emelota. He succeeded his father as Lord of Sidon while Walter succeeded in Caesarea. His mother married Hugh II of Le Puiset, a cousin of Queen Melisende, whose relationship with the queen was suspected of being \\"too familiar\\". For reasons unknown, William of Tyre refers to him as Eustace II. He mentions him in 1124, 1126, and 1154. He appears, however, as Gerard in several acts of the kingdom dated between 1147 and 1165. Some historians have been led to suggest that Eustace had more than two sons. He last appears witnessing a charter of 15 March 1165, but his son does not appear until 4 February 1171. The rulership of Sidon is not recorded between these years, during which Gerard must have died. It is impossible that Eustace II and Gerard should be two successive lords of Sidon. Gerard disputed a fief with one of his vassals and tried to repossess it, but Amalric I of Jerusalem intervened to reverse the situation in the vassal's favour. Gerard often played the pirate at sea and led several raiding expeditions against both Moslem and Christian fleets. By his wife Agnes, sister of William II of Bures, Prince of Galilee, he had two sons: *Reginald (c. 1133-1202), who succeeded him in Sidon, and was described in the Lignages d'Outremer as \\"extremely ugly but very intelligent\\". *Walter (named as Eustace in the Lignages d'Outremer), b. 1137, described as \\"not at all clever, and handsome\\".

Swedish Romantic literature denotes Swedish literature between 1809 and 1830.These years are given by Tigerstedt, 1971 In Europe, the period from circa 1805-1840 is known as Romanticism. It was also strongly featured in Sweden, based on German influences. During this relatively short period, there were so many great Swedish poets, that the era is referred to as the Golden Age of Swedish poetry.Algulin, pp.67-68Gustafson, pp.143-148 The period started around 1810 when several periodicals were published that contested the literature of the 18th century. An important society was the Gothic Society (1811), and their periodical Iduna, a romanticised retrospect to Gothicismus. One significant reason was that several poets for the first time worked towards a common direction. Four of the main romantic poets that made significant contributions to the movements were: the professor of history Erik Gustaf Geijer, the loner Erik Johan Stagnelius, professor of Greek language Esaias Tegn√©r and professor of aesthetics and philosophy P.D.A. Atterbom.Gustafson, p.146 Geijer (1783‚Äì1847) was one of the earliest and most prominent members of the neo- gothicist Gothic Society. As a professor he published two cultural-historical works: \\"Svea rikes h√§vder\\" and \\"Svenska folkets historia\\", where he gave support to the idea of the Viking Age being a cultural height that was suppressed during the Middle Ages.Algulin, pp.83-86Gustafson, pp.156-164 Stagnelius (1793-1823) spent his short adult years living as an outsider in Stockholm. Many of his poems deal with the beauty in nature, encompassing the loneliness of the soul, and it is both for his beauty and his mysticism that Stagnelius's works were to attain recognition.Algulin, pp.77-81 The fame of Atterbom (1790-1855) comes from his flower poetry: Lycksalighetens √∂ (\\"Island of Bliss\\"), 1824‚Äì1827, and a collection of poetry called Blommorna.Gustafson, pp.151-155 Esaias Tegn√©r (1782-1846) has been described as the first modern Swedish man, in the sense that very much is known about both his life and his person, and that he left an extensive correspondence. His great success lies on Frithiof's Saga (1820‚Äì1825), a romanticized version of the Icelandic sagas but in a modern dress. The work was translated into several languages, put to music in Sweden, where it had status of a national epos until the realism of the 1880s obsoleted it.Algulin, pp.70-74 Image:Per Daniel Amadeus Atterbom portr√§tterad 1831 av Johan Gustaf Sandberg.jpgAtterbom, 1831 Image:Erik Gustaf Geijer.jpgGeijer Image:Erik Johan Stagnelius, color.jpgStagnelius, posthumous medallion  Early liberalism  Fredrika Bremer (1801-1865) was the first writer of realism novel, in the spirit of Jane Austen, and her most important contribution is that she introduced the novel in Swedish on a large scale. Her most important novel was her last: Hertha, in 1856. Hertha is not so much a novel as it is a political debate of women's rights. Viktor Rydberg (1828-1895) was a key figure in the Swedish culture between 1855 and the modern breakthrough in 1879. In the spirit of Dickens, Rydberg wrote adventurous novels and stories that in reality were dealing with the poor and exposed people of society. Several works tried to define a world where Christianity became integrated with humanistic ideals of ancient Greece. Rydberg was also noted for groundbreaking historical and theological works.Algulin, pp.95-98 When Sweden lost Finland in 1809, Finnish literature moved in its own direction. For the remainder of the 19th century however, it was still the educated Swedish speaking minority in Finland that authored most of Finland's literature. A key figure was the Swedish speaking Johan Ludvig Runeberg (1804-1877), was established himself as Finlands national poet, a distinction he has kept into modern times. His most important work was The Tales of Ensign St√•l (1848-1860), an epic poem about the Finnish War (1808‚Äì1809), the first verse of which became Finland's national anthem.Algulin, pp.103-108 After Runeberg, it was to be Zacharius Topelius (1818-1898) to take the role of national Finnish author. Although he wrote both novels and poetry, his most important contributions were children's books, with L√§sning f√∂r barn (Reading for Children, 1865-1896).Algulin, pp.107-108 image:Carl Jonas Love Almqvist (ca 1835) av Carl Peter Mazer.jpgAlmqvist, circa 1835 Image:Viktor Rydberg 1876.jpgRydberg, 1876 image:Fredrika Bremer 1849.jpgFredrika Bremer, 1849  Notes and references  * Algulin, Ingemar, A History of Swedish Literature, published by the Swedish Institute, 1989. * Gustafson, Alrik A History of Swedish Literature (2 volumes), 1961. * Tigerstedt, E.N., Svensk litteraturhistoria (Tryckindustri AB, Solna, 1971) Category:Swedish literature Category:Romanticism ","title":"Swedish Romantic literature"},{"id":"7697137","text":"Derek Tracey (born 6 April 1971 in Dublin) is a retired League of Ireland association footballer who spent his entire 17 season senior career playing for Shamrock Rovers.

It is located in the George Washington National Forest in Nelson County, Virginia, off of Virginia State Route 56. The name of the falls is thought to have come from William Crabtree, who settled in this part of Virginia in 1777. L.A. Snead, former US Assistant Fuel Administrator (WWI), environmentalist and notable Nelsonian, spearheaded negotiations to secure land surrounding Crabtree Falls after it was almost developed as a resort area in the late 1960s. Using personal and Congressional funds, the land deals were completed and the deeds transferred by LA Snead on June 3, 1968, to the National Forest System. This assured benefit for future generations of this magnificent Nelson County treasure. Aerial view The set of waterfalls is often credited with being high, but topographic maps show the total drop to be closer to .U.S. Geological Survey Massies Mill 7.5-minute quadrangle Crabtree Falls is a series of cascading waterfalls, with five major cascades, the tallest of which drops about , and several smaller cascades, all over a total distance of approximately horizontally. The cascade with a drop also gives Crabtree Falls the title of tallest vertical drop in a waterfall east of the Mississippi River. However, the title of tallest free-fall vertical drop goes to Fall Creek Falls in Tennessee's Fall Creek Falls State Park. There is a trail to the waterfall maintained by the United States Forest Service called the Crabtree Falls Trail. Twenty-nine people have fallen to their deaths from leaving the trail to climb too close to the waterfalls. Recent deaths occurred April 2013, June 2015, and most recently, August 29, 2015.

Adams. In 1880 he was living at 236 West 38th Street in Manhattan and he listed himself as a \\"segar dealer\\". He was named by the Lexow Committee, and was replaced by Peter H. Matthews when he retired. The anonymous testifier at the Lexow Committee in 1894 said: \\"[the principal policy backers in this city are] Al Adams. 'Jake' Shipsey, Cornelius B.

Biography The son of the architect, Edward Durell Stone, he graduated from The Hill School,https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407E0DD153AF937A25754C0A96F9C8B63 and then went on to Yale, where he received a degree in Architectural Design. Later he served three years as a pilot in the U.S. Air Force. This allowed him to see the world and the \\"natural beauty of the land\\", which played a role in his decision to pursue landscape architecture. He received his master's degree of Landscape Architecture from the Graduate School of Design at Harvard University. Stone began his career in 1959. Initially, he practiced under another Fort Lauderdale architect, but soon became self-employed and founded EDSA. The firm began to prosper while collaborating on projects with Stone's father. Stone's career continued after getting its boost in 1960 when he created his firm, Edward Durell Stone Jr. and Associates or EDSA. In 1991, it was unanimous opinion among interviewed principals of large and small firms that Stone's firm was among the top five.(Landscape Architecture, 60). Stone's work and career greatly impacted tourism and community-living in the United States, especially in Florida, as well as in the Caribbean and Europe.(Gillette, 75) In Landscape Architecture Magazine, Jane Brown Gillette reports that Stone realized what he wanted to do at age seventeen while attending a dinner dance at the Everglades Club in Palm Beach, Florida. Here the scenery within the building's courtyard affected him in such a way that would eventually have an effect on many landscapes throughout Florida and the Caribbean and on the profession of landscape architecture through his work. Stone was elected a Fellow of the American Society of Landscape Architects, and he received the 1994 ASLA Medal. The medal \\"is the highest honor the American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA) may bestow upon a landscape architect whose lifetime achievements and contributions to the profession have had a unique and lasting impact on the welfare of the public and the environment.\\" Stone served three consecutive four-year terms on the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, appointed by Presidents Nixon, Ford, and Carter, and he served as a consultant to the Committee for a More Beautiful Capital in Washington, D.C., and to the Governor's Conference on Environmental Quality in the State of Florida.Thomas E. Luebke, ed., Civic Art: A Centennial History of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, 2013): Appendix B, p. 555. At EDSA, Stone continued to play a role in directing the charettes that begin most projects, and he participated in design reviews (Gillete, 77). Gillette says EDSA specializes in recreation- based communities and resorts, both national and international. The firm also does work in urban and campus design, in places of entertainment and attraction, and in environment and ecotourism. Some of EDSA's main projects include Disney World's West Side, Euro Disneyland, Riverwalk in Fort Lauderdale, the Fort Lauderdale Beach Revitalization, El Conquistador Resort and Country Club, and Hyatt Regency Aruba Resort and Casino. Stone and his firm have become recognized for their expertise in planning and design for resort and community development. The projects in Fort Lauderdale, voted best city of its size in 1994, have helped make the city a tourist destination (Gillette, 91). In designing these places, Stone says they try to create \\"an idealized place, what the environment would be if everything were right in the world.\\"(Gillette, 78) References External links * EDSA website * Bracken Lecture Series - Department of Landscape Architecture: Penn State * ASLA.org * Disney World's West Side * Gillette, Jane Brown. 1997. \\"Team Leader\\".

His name (erroneously spelled Albadi, Albalidi, Alrabi, and Altabi) is ascertained from his chief work, Shebile Emunah, wherein a poem is found in which every line begins with a letter of his name, and there it reads \\"Aldabi.\\"  Biography  In the preface to his book occurs the expression, \\"of the exiles of Jerusalem.\\" This, together with Aldabi's statement that he was exiled from his country (Andalusia), caused Graetz to assume that Meir ibn Aldabi was banished to Jerusalem. Graetz failed to take into account Aldabi's words, \\"He [God] led me into a waste land,\\" which he would not have used in reference to Jerusalem. Aldabi belonged to the class of popular writers who, possessing extensive theological and scientific knowledge, commented upon the assertions of their predecessors with a clear understanding, expressing here and there their own opinions, and presenting some subjects from the standpoint of the Kabbala. Aldabi was also one of those Talmudists whose conception of religion was wholly spiritual and who revered the Cabala: he can not, however, be called a true cabalist. In 1360 he wrote Shebile Emunah (The Paths of Faith), an exhaustive treatise on philosophical, scientific, and theological subjects. To judge from the many editions that appeared from time to time, it was for centuries a favorite book with the educated.  Shebile Emunah  Shebile Emunah (Shevilei Emunah) is divided into ten chapters, which treat respectively of: # The existence of God, His attributes, His immateriality, unity, and immutability, which is not affected by prayer or even by miracles ‚Äì introducing in each case a cabalistic discussion of the names of the Deity. # The creation of the world, which does not necessitate any change in God or any plurality in His nature; an explanation of the Biblical account being given, followed by a dissertation on the seven climates or zones of the earth as then conceived, the spheres, the stars, the sun and moon and their eclipses, and on meteorology. # Human embryology and the generative functions. # Human anatomy, physiology, and pathology. # Rules for health and long life. # The soul and its functions. # The exaltation of the soul, which, through the fulfilment of the Law, becomes one with the Creator ‚Äì the chapter being devoted chiefly to an explanation of the ethical value of the Mosaic commandments. # Explanatory notes on the truth of the Law and of oral tradition, elucidating some of the Haggadot on the same lines as Solomon ben Adret. # Reward and punishment, paradise and hell, immortality of the soul and its transmigration in man. # The redemption of Israel, the resurrection, and the world to come after resurrection; a general r√©sum√© of the book, followed by a poem. Steinschneider (Hebr. Uebers. pp. 9‚Äì27) has shown Aldabi's Shebile Emunah to be a compilation from various older sources, chiefly from Gerson ben Solomon of Arles's encyclopedic work, Sha'ar ha-Shamayim, of the 13th century. From Gerson's work the chapter on the members of the human body (¬ß2, chap. iii) is taken, and in part verbally. So are Aldabi's \\"Ten Questions on the Soul\\" (¬ß6), interspersed with passages borrowed literally from Joseph ibn Zaddik and Hillel ben Samuel, only a modified form of the \\"Ten Discussions on the Soul,\\" which Gerson himself adapted from a book on the soul, probably written by Ibn Gabirol.

After the split within the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, to which he was a member, Jugheli sided with the Bolsheviks, but later defected to the Menshevik faction and became an influential member. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, he organized the Red Guard detachment which was later renamed into the People's Guard of Georgia. On November 29, 1917, he successfully commanded a famous raid on the Tiflis military arsenal guarded by the pro-Bolshevik Russian soldiers. In May 1918, he was reluctant to support the proclamation of Georgia's independence, but still retained his post.

A dam was also built about a mile up river which fed a redwood penstock that supplied high pressure water to the power plant. Once power was brought to the area, the power plant was shut down, and soon afterward local miners began dismantling the penstock to use the redwood. In 1926 William Whore used the wood to build three cabins. Two of those remain today, but the third burned in 1949. There was also extensive drag line dredging done in the river, just west of the old power plant site. Huge piles of giant boulders remain in arc shaped piles on the south side of the river.

Lycan (; born September 26, 1945) is an American philosopher and Professor Emeritus at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he was formerly the William Rand Kenan, Jr. Distinguished Professor. Since 2011, Lycan is also Distinguished Visiting Professor of Philosophy at the University of Connecticut, where he continues to teach. Education and career William Lycan received his B.A. from Amherst College in 1966, where he also worked as a teaching assistant in the Music department. His honors thesis was on \\"Noam Chomsky's Investigation of Syntax.\\" He went on to attend graduate school at the University of Chicago, where he received an M.A. in 1967 and a Ph.D. in 1970. His doctoral dissertation was on \\"Persons, Criteria, and Materialism.\\" Lycan taught for twelve years at Ohio State University, before joining the faculty at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill in 1982, where he is now emeritus. He won the Class of 2001 Outstanding Faculty Award (in 2001) and a Distinguished Teaching Award for Post-Baccalaureate Instruction in 2002. In 2013, he was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities.  Philosophical work  His principal interests include philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, philosophy of linguistics, epistemology, and metaphysics. The author of eight books and over 150 articles (and over 20 reviews) Lycan is an advocate of the version of functionalism, known as homuncular functionalism. Lycan is an unapologetic realist and physicalist about almost everything ‚Äì mental states (intentionality and consciousness), epistemic justification, linguistic meaning, perception (especially color and smell), moral properties, aesthetic properties, and more. This philosophical tapestry is held together by several common threads, which among others include: the view that persons are complex systems composed of sub-personal systems, sub-sub-personal systems, etc., all the way down to sub-atomic functions; the view that natural teleology is ubiquitous, that there exists a non-ideal but nonetheless discernible evolved fit between human capacities and the environment; and the view that meaning in natural language manifests a logical form that at its core is truth-functional. These (and other) common threads are prominent in Lycan's theories of mind. Mental states are type-identical to functional states instantiated in sub- or sub-sub- personal systems, where the function of any such state is determined by its natural teleology. This is Lycan's Homuncular Functionalism. The appeal to teleology dissolves problems with earlier functionalist theories, especially those concerning consciousness. A correct theory of consciousness, on Lycan's view, comprises multiple parts corresponding to the multiple phenomena to which the term ‚Äòconsciousness‚Äô is applied. Thus, Lycan defends a higher-order, inner sense theory of awareness, according to which attention mechanisms have the function of monitoring and integrating lower level psychological processes; a pronominal theory of subjectivity, according to which the subjective or perspectival nature of conscious states is a product of the utterly unique semantic role of introspective mental concepts (e.g., ‚ÄòI‚Äô); a representational theory of qualia, according to which sensory qualities are the intentional objects of sensory representations; and more. (Consciousness 1987; Consciousness and Experience 1996.) These same threads are prominent in Lycan's account of knowledge, including his account of belief acquisition and epistemic justification. To acquire a new belief is to acquire a new real, internal representation instantiated in one's functional architecture. And a new belief is justified if it, better than its competitors, increases the explanatory coherence of the person's entire belief set. This is Lycan's explanationist theory of justification. Canons of epistemic value used to identify degrees of explanatory coherence are themselves justified by appeal to natural teleology. (Judgement and Justification 1988.) In defense of his view, Lycan critically assesses major competitors (especially reliabilism) and other views (e.g., epistemic minimalism). Meaning in natural language (Logical Form in Natural Language 1984), including the meaning of indicative conditionals (Real Conditionals 2001), is explained by Lycan in truth- theoretic terms. Here, too, the requisite psycho-linguistic machinery coheres with Lycan's Homuncular Functionalism and, more generally, with the above common threads. Along with Robert Adams, Lycan considers David Kellogg Lewis's notion of possible worlds to be metaphysically extravagant and suggests in its place an actualist interpretation of possible worlds as consistent, maximally complete sets of descriptions or propositions about the world, so that a \\"possible world\\" is conceived of as a complete description (i.e. a maximally consistent set of propositions) of a way the world could be ‚Äì rather than a world which is that way.

The M1943 (also called the MT-13) was one of the heaviest mortar used by Soviet troops in World War II. Around 535 of these weapons were fielded with Soviet forces during the war. It was replaced in Soviet service after World War II by the M-160 mortar of the same caliber. Description Originally a simple scaling-up of the 120 mm M1938 mortar, it soon became apparent that drop-loading a 40 kg bomb into a 3 meter high tube would be too difficult for any man to do. It was redesigned into a breech loading weapon, and contains a substantial recoil system to soak up the massive shock of firing a 160 mm bomb and prevent the baseplate from burying itself too deeply. The barrel sits in a cradle which is attached to a baseplate and tripod. To load the weapon, the barrel is hinged forward which exposes the rear end of the tube. The bomb is then loaded, retained in place by a catch, and the barrel is swung back into the cradle, which in effect closes the breech. Because of the weight of the mortar, it is equipped with wheels and is designed to be towed by a motor-driven vehicle. Tactical organization The Soviet Army deployed the 160-mm mortar in brigades of 32 mortars each. The brigades were composed of four battalions of eight mortars each. Such brigades were part of the artillery divisions formed from 1944 onward (see Divisions of the Soviet Union 1917-1945).

A Nisei, he wrote the 1975 novel All I Asking for Is My Body, which is considered a classic novel of the experiences of Japanese Americans in Hawaii before and during World War II. Biography Murayama was born in Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii to Japanese immigrant parents from Kyushu. When he was about 12, his family moved to a sugarcane plantation camp at Pu'ukoli'i. (This was a company town of several hundred workers and their families that no longer exists.) Murayama's experiences there provided the material for his novels. After graduating from high school in Lahaina in 1941, he attended the University of Hawai ªi. He served in the Territorial Guard after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, but was abruptly discharged with other Japanese Americans. He soon after volunteered with Military Intelligence. As a native speaker of Japanese, he was sent to Taiwan as a translator to help facilitate the surrender and repatriation of Japanese troops there. He returned to Hawaii in 1946 and completed his B.A. in English and philosophy at the University of Hawai'i that year. He then attended Columbia University under the G.I. Bill, earning a master's degree in Chinese and Japanese in 1950. After completing his postgraduate work at Columbia, Murayama moved to Washington, D.C., where he worked at the Armed Forces Medical Library from 1952 to 1956, before moving to San Francisco. While still at Columbia, he completed the first draft of his first novel, All I Asking for Is My Body. A story (\\"I'll Crack Your Head Kotsun\\") that became the first chapter of the novel was published in the Arizona Quarterly in 1959. It was reprinted in 1968 in The Spell of Hawaii, an Hawaii literary anthology. All I Asking for was not particularly well received when it was first published in 1975, but it won the American Book Award of the Before Columbus Foundation in 1980, and when it was reissued by the University of Hawai ªi in 1988 it received critical acclaim. Murayama received the Hawai'i Award for Literature in 1991. It has remained in print ever since, and has become a cult classic. The novel, including the title, is written in modified Pidgin and is considered dialectically authentic while still readable by non-Pidgin readers.Choice magazine review blurb, from University of Hawai'i Press edition His second novel, Five Years on a Rock (1994) is a prequel to the first novel; it covers the years 1914 to 1935, while All I Asking for goes from 1935 to 1943. Both novels relate the experiences of the family of Oyama Isao and his wife Ito Sawa, immigrants to Hawaii from Japan, and their many children, including sons Toshio and Kiyoshi. Much of the dialog is in the creole used by the Japanese-Hawaiians of the author's acquaintance. The novels seem to be fictionalized autobiography. The chronologically earlier novel is told from the point of view of Ito Sawa, and the later one from that of her son Kiyoshi. A third novel in the series, Plantation Boy, was published in 1998. Toshio (now going by the Americanized name of Steve) is the narrator. Like the first two novels, it was published by the University of Hawai ªi Press. A fourth novel, Dying in a Strange Land, was published by the University of Hawai ªi Press in 2008. The character Toshio is based largely on Milton Murayama's brother, Edwin Murayama. His life story of a plantation-boxer-turned-architect forms the basis of \\"All I Asking For Is My Body\\" and \\"Plantation Boy.\\" Murayama died in July 2016 at the age of 93. All I Asking for Is My Body All I Asking for Is My Body, Murayama's most famous novel, illustrates the plight of a poor Japanese American family living in Hawaii during the cusp of World War II. The novel is divided into three parts, which follow the narrator Kiyo as he grows up in the sugarcane plantations in Hawaii. In the first section, \\"I'll Crack Your Head Kotsun\\", Kiyo befriends an older boy whose mother is a prostitute for the camps; Kiyo is confused by his parents' resistance to their friendship. In the second section, \\"The Substitute\\", Kiyo explores the various spiritual belief systems of the people around him. In the third and longest section, \\"All I Asking for Is My Body\\", Kiyo's oldest brother, Tosh (Toshio), clashes with their parents when they expect him to fulfill his \\"filial duty\\" to repay the family's debt and when they refuse to allow Tosh and Kiyo to enroll in high school. Tosh claims that the money was stolen by his grandfather and that therefore it is not up to him to repay it; moreover, he argues that filial duty must be earned and that the parents haven't earned it. Tosh, and then later Kiyo, pick up boxing and are quite good at it, even to the point where Tosh is offered to box professionally. However, the importance of family and filial piety are illustrated by Tosh turning down a boxing career in order to help his parents. Still, Tosh goes along, giving the parents a combination of his and his wife's earnings. Kiyo, observing these problems, realizes he must resist being subservient. He eventually joins the Army, with the three-part goal of getting away from home, proving his loyalty to the United States, and using his salary to help his family. The novel ends with Kiyo winning enough money in a barracks gambling match to help Tosh pay off the debt. Works =Novels= *All I Asking for Is My Body. Honolulu: 1975.

This film boasts tap dance routines and a complicated, if not unique, interpretation of the main character by Gregory Hines, who also served as an executive producer. Bojangles was produced by Darrick Productions and MGM Television for the Showtime premium cable network.  Background  In 1916, Robinson was a successful vaudeville performer and considered the finest tap dancer of his generation. At the peak of his career, he was the highest paid Black entertainer, but for all the joy he gave others, his life was anything but happy, there was a great deal of tragedy in himself. He died broke and penniless. When the American Civil War was still a living memory, segregation in public facilities was the rule, rather than the exception, and all sorts of strange and arbitrary regulations were aimed at keeping people of color in a separate and inferior position. On the vaudeville circuits there was what was known as the \\"two-colored rule\\"‚Äîno solo performances for black entertainers; at least two had to be on the stage. But Robinson started in the black-face productions and shocked people when he worked as a solo act. He also starred on Broadway and was a headliner in Canada, which did not have the same issues with racism as America, and while roles for black actors in Hollywood were severely limited at the time, Robinson managed to become a recognized screen star, headlining the musical Stormy Weather and appearing in a significant number of films with child star Shirley Temple. Robinson was a great subject for a movie biography. He loved his native New York City and gained notoriety for his generosity, performing at more of 3000 benefits, but was also a compulsive gambler and a womanizer. Hines, one of the greatest tap dancer of his generation, displays his fascination with the history of the art, but instead of creating a glorified image of the man and his work, he shows a different side of the entertainer. Some of the best scenes of Bojangles are the dance numbers, including a memorable duplication by Hines of a filmed dance by Robinson using an up-and-down set of stairs in which Hines' step dance is repeated with the film of Robinson's, side by side. An effective supporting cast helps to keep the energy levels from flagging. Kimberly Elise is charming as Robinson's wife of 27 years, and Peter Riegert adds dimension to Marty Forkins, Robinson's loyal agent who gave up other clients‚Äìthe Marx Brothers, Will Rogers‚Äîto focus on building Robinson's career. Bojangles also features Savion Glover and Maria Ricossa. All of these characters speak directly to the camera/audience at one point or another, a device that also helps vary the mostly straight-line storyline. Furthermore, the film allows the opportunity for the audience to examine the difficulties of black entertainers back then against similar difficulties today. Synopsis Starting with Robinson's funeral, including what looks like archival footage of the event, the film then plays out the biography in a straightforward manner as a flashback, both in color and black-and-white.

Background The operation was launched to open the road from Gardez to Khost that had been blocked by Mujahideen forces and a local tribe for several months, in order to deliver supplies to the population and Afghan government troops in the besieged city on the Afghan‚ÄìPakistani border. The offensive was carried out by the 108th Motor Rifle Division and 201st Motor Rifle Division of the Soviet 40th Army, the 103rd Guards Airborne Division, the 345th Airborne Regiment and the 56th Airborne Brigade, and several Spetsnaz units. The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan provided troops from its 8th, 11th, 12th, 14th and 25th infantry divisions and from the 15th Tank Brigade. The DRA forces were commanded by Major-General Shahnawaz Tanai.Urban, p.231 The ground offensive began after weeks of failed negotiations with the Jadran tribe and Mujahideen commander Jalaluddin Haqqani, who had numerous bases in the region and hoped that Khost would eventually fall into their hands which would allow them to proclaim the first territorial stronghold in Afghanistan independent of the pro-Kremlin regime in Kabul. Special units of the 40th Army conducted a massive propaganda campaign using radio broadcasts and distributing thousands of leaflets, calling on the Jadran tribe to retreat and the local population to leave the area. Operation The initial phase of the operation began on the 19 November with an offensive carried out principally by Afghan troops, in order to clear the plains around Gardez, before moving into mountainous areas. By 28 November, they had cleared Ghalgai, Dara, and Saruti Kandau at the base of the Shabak Khel valley, while a flanking force made its way into the Kanai valley. On 30 November, a force of 900 Afghan commandos were airlifted into Shabak Khel valley. Heavy fighting also broke out in the neighbouring Kanai valley, where DRA troops advanced slowly but surely, building defensive outposts as they went, and suffering from punishing Mujahideen counter-attacks, that inflicted heavy losses.Urban, p.232 =Capture of the Satukandav Pass= The Satukandav Pass, 30 km east of Gardez, was the main passage between Kabul and Khost. Here the Mujahideen placed their main blocking position, concentrating their forces and digging in anti-aircraft guns and other heavy weapons. To defend the approaches of the Satukandav, the Mujahideen deployed ten BM-12 multiple rocket launchers, and placed ZGU-1ZGU-1 is the \\"mountain\\" version of the ZPU-1. anti-aircraft guns on every height. They had a plentiful supply of DShK machine guns, 75 and 82 mm recoilless rifles, and RPG-7 anti-tank rocket launchers. They also mined the opening of the pass to a depth of three kilometers, boasting that their position was impregnable.Grau, p.60 Following the failure of the negotiations, an attack was launched on the 28 November. In order to discover the enemy positions, Soviet Colonel General Boris Gromov ordered that dummy paratroopers be dropped near the pass. When the Mujahideen opened fire, Soviet reconnaissance aircraft were able to pinpoint their positions and direct airstrikes against them. This was followed by a four-hour artillery barrage. The first ground attack was carried out on the 29 November by a motorised rifle regiment. The attack quickly bogged down under heavy fire and Mujahideen counter-attacks, and the Soviet force withdrew after suffering severe casualties.Grau p.63 On Gromov's orders, a new attack was launched on the 1 December this time with an Airborne Battalion and a battalion of Afghan Army commandos. These units succeeded in capturing the high ground above the pass. The Mujahideen, threatened with encirclement, beat a hasty retreat, abandoning most of their heavy weapons and equipment.Grau p.64. =Relief of Khost= The Soviet forces then launched several airborne attacks, though they were limited in this by the Mujahideen use of Stinger missiles. In a night attack, an airborne brigade was flown in by helicopters to capture Mirujan, at the southern end of the mountains on the Gardez-Khost road. Simultaneously, another brigade was airlifted into Khost and staged a breakout to rejoin the main force. The Mujahideen, having lost control of the pass, realised that a conventional defence would only entail more losses for them, and they withdrew their main units from the path of the Soviet offensive. Beforehand, they laid mines on the road, and maintained a constant long-range fire with 107 mm rockets. They also sprang ambushes on Soviet units that ventured too far from the main force. In one such ambush, 24 Soviet paratroopers were killed.Isby, p.47 Despite this, the Soviet armoured columns made a slow but regular progress, entering Khost on the 30 December. Soviet and DRA outposts were maintained to keep the Gardez-Khost road open, but were withdrawn at the end of January. Aftermath Operation Magistral was a success for the Soviet army, but occurred too late in the war to have any lasting effect. When the main Soviet force had withdrawn, Mujahideen groups cut off Khost once again, as they had done since 1981. In April 1988, by signing the Geneva Accords the Soviet Union became committed to withdrawing its forces from Afghanistan. =Cultural depictions= Some of the events of the operation were used for the plot of the film The 9th Company.

The protagonist is Lady Firebird Angelo, once a \\"wastling\\" of a Netaian royal family and now a Federate citizen. Plot summary Firebird and new husband Brennen Caldwell being attacked in the middle of the night by someone with telepathic powers, thus of Ehretan heritage. Firebird continues her study of Netaian political simulations, hoping to stave off societal collapse of her dysfunctional homeworld. She also studies her new religion and telepathy, having accidentally discovered that the Angelo bloodline carried Ehretan genes (and hence Ehretan powers) A second successful turn, during labor, nearly kills her as well. As this uncontrolled ability threatens any telepath that might be near her, she is quarantined--even from her newborn sons. Meanwhile, Phoena Angelo continues to chafe while Netaia is under Federate occupation, and her latest scheme involves asking the Shuhr for assistance. However, they mentally dominate her and reduce her to an unwitting pawn, using her as a source for exploring the lost Ehretan gene sequences, as well as pillaging the material wealth of Netaia. Phoena's foppish husband, Tel Tellai, humbles himself by asking Caldwell's assistance in rescuing her, despite the impossible odds. Ongoing diplomatic and military developments force the issue of Phoena's rescue, but Caldwell finally accepts the mission only after a divine vision. Using new technology to amplify his mental abilities, he sets out to infiltrate the Shuhr homeworld of Three Zed in a rescue attempt. He finds Phoena, but is captured. She is tortured to death while the Shuhr enjoyed her psychic screams of pain, at last realizing she'd been played for the fool, and only Brennen is there to mourn her death. The Shuhr leaders extract DNA samples from him for their cloning efforts, and try to force secrets from him. To thwart them, Caldwell gives himself amnesia blocks. Tel, exposed to non-Netaian ideas for the first time, begins to doubt Phoena's character and motives, though he remains fiercely devoted to her. He also comes to a healthy respect for Caldwell, and the Sentinels and Federacy in general. When Ellet Kinsman, a Sentinel officer and Firebird's romantic rival for Caldwell's affections, shows her how she can pursue and rescue Brennen, Firebird (also after divine guidance) seizes the chance, and takes the matured Tel as her copilot. On Netaia, Queen Carradee's rule and reforms are seen as ineffectual and even harmful to the ruling class, who force her to abdicate after her chambers are bombed, almost resulting in the death of Prince Consort Daithi Drake-Angelo. Carradee and Daithi are welcomed to Hesed House, the Sentinel retreat, and Daithi is given better medical care than is available on Netaia. As he begins to recover, the two of them also begin to see the Federacy, especially the gentle faith of the Sentinels, in a new light. Firebird and Tel are discovered, but she is allowed to free Caldwell before they are both captured again. Tel remains in the shuttle, and is mentally incapacitated by the monitoring Shuhr. Caldwell is a wreck, having faced physical and psychic torture for days, and his self-imposed amnesia has progressed to the point where he cannot even remember who Firebird is. Firebird manages to turn again, allowing Caldwell to jumpstart his powers temporarily, overcome their attackers, and escape with Tel's help. The Federacy discovers the Shuhr were developing their own psi-amplification and fusion technologies, which would have allowed them to dominate every world in that arm of the galaxy.

Many colleges and universities worldwide apply both health promotion and health care as processes to achieve key performance indicators in college health. The variety of healthcare services provided by any one institution range from first aid stations employing a single nurse to large, accredited, multi- specialty ambulatory healthcare clinics with hundreds of employees. These services, programs and policies require a multidisciplinary team, the healthcare services alone include physicians, physician assistants, administrators, nurses, nurse practitioners, mental health professionals, health educators, athletic trainers, dietitians and nutritionists, and pharmacists. Some of the healthcare services extend to include massage therapists and other holistic health care professionals. While currently changing, the vast majority of college health services are set up as cost centers or service units rather than as parts of academic departments or health care delivery enterprises. To continually achieve college health, many institutions engage in both the process of healthcare and the process of health promotion. The advancement of student health through educational, political, regulatory and organizational supports is referred to as Health Promotion in Higher Education. As the current era of public health, health promotion goes beyond bio-behavioral influences using a settings approach, with the settings including: school health, institution/community health, and work sites. The American College Health Association is one national body in The States that provides measurable guidelines for enhancing the quality of services, programs and policies. Another national body in the field of college health is the National Collegiate EMS Foundation (NCEMSF), which is dedicated to the promotion and support of emergency medical services on college and university campuses. Other national and international associations include National Association of Student Personnel Administrators (NASPA) and National Intramural-Recreational Sports Association (NIRSA). Ever increasing levels of college health often requires comprehensive environmental management, the coordination of resources, and institutional accountability for addressing the negative health impacts from alcohol use disorder and other substance abuse, mental illnesses such as depression and general anxiety disorders, sexual assault and discrimination among others. The creation of innovative strategies to address the behavioral determinants of health among post-secondary students continues to pose challenges for institutions worldwide.  Common health concerns of College and University students  = Distress = A common college health key performance indicator relates to levels and the management of stress. Distress is the a negative result from the body's adaptation to change. A post-secondary education contains both distress and eustress. Many institutions of higher education have a reputation for being high-stress environments. Throughout college or university, students often experience increased academic-related expectations, as well as a heightened level of overall responsibility that can adversely affects a student's wellbeing. Likewise, students in post-secondary are often expected to balance social, financial, personal and professional responsibilities, while maintaining a strong academic performance. As a result, students in post-secondary often experience an increase in their overall stress level, compounded by a decreased perception of their own quality of life. With stress being a common aspect of students‚Äô academic experiences, the correlation between stress and compromised quality of life has become an area of increasing concern in post- secondary. In recent studies, stress has been shown to contribute to the formation of maladaptive coping strategies in post-secondary students, which can subsequently increase one's risk for developing adverse health complications throughout college or university, including depression. Additionally, factors such as physical and mental exhaustion, along with decreased sleep performance as a result of stress at university or college can be a major detriment to a student's perceived life satisfaction.  Academic  Post-secondary students experience stress from a variety of sources in their daily life, including academics. In a 2017 American College Health Association report, 47.5% of post-secondary students claimed that they considered their academic stress to be 'traumatic or very difficult to handle.‚Äô Disturbed sleep patterns, social problems, and homesickness are all major factors that can increase a student's perceived level of stress, including academic stress. Academic competition is another major source of stress in post-secondary students' lives. High levels of colleague competitiveness has been reported to have a positive correlation with depression and anxiety in post-secondary students. Furthermore, while competition in academic environments can often be a perceived as a strong motivator to students, overall evidence suggests that it can also contribute to unhealthy levels of stress in an individual. Learning how to develop effective strategies to manage personal stress in an academic setting can therefore help protect one against the risk of developing health complications in post-secondary. Yoga, breathing-techniques, and mindfulness interventions are all practices that have been proven to reduce stress among college students. Specifically, cortisol in students who engage in cognitive- and behavioral-based techniques has been proven to decrease post-intervention. Furthermore, studies suggest exercise and physical activity may have a protective effect against stress in post-secondary students.  Personal  Intra-personal distresses, including perceived concerns relating to body- image and self-esteem, are common in adolescence. Furthermore, unhealthy body- image has been associated with a number of negative health complications, notably depression and disordered eating behaviors. Post-secondary institutions have therefore become widely recognized as ideal grounds for implementing evidence-based health interventions that provide students the opportunity to manage and improve their overall self-image. Financial stress is also a major burden on students‚Äô health and wellbeing, as the academic term employs the expenditure of one's financial resources ‚Äúwithout guarantees of a satisfactory return.\\" In a 2019 report by The College Board on \\"Trends in College Pricing,\\" the average tuition for full-time students attending a four- year-long post-secondary institution in the 2019‚Äì2020 academic year was about $12,700. With the costs of post-secondary education growing significantly over the last decade, many students are choosing to take out student loans to support their education. As a significant source of stress, student debt and financial instability have been linked to poorer general health outcomes and higher rates of depressive symptoms in young adults. Personal debt has also been associated with increased drug and alcohol use.  Adverse effects on health  The increasing rate of perceived stress in post-secondary has highlighted the need for mental health and counselling services throughout university and college campuses. According to the American Psychological Association (APA), there was a 30% rise in students seeking psychological healthcare services on American campuses between the 2009-2010 and 2014‚Äì2015 academic year, with 61% of these students seeking counselling for anxiety, 49% seeking counselling for depression, 45% seeking counselling for stress, and 28% seeking counselling for concerns regarding academic performance. = Mental illness = Late adolescents and early adulthood is a window of onset for many psycho-social-behavioral illnesses. Therefore, mental health disorders are often first diagnosed in college students. Attending college can be a stressful time for many students. In addition to coping with academic pressure, some students have to deal with the stressful tasks of separation and individuation from their family of origin while some may have to attend to numerous work and family responsibilities. In a survey of 14,000 college students from 8 different countries, researchers found that approximately 35% of students had an undiagnosed mental health illness. An estimated 75% of all lifetime mental disorders are developed by the age of 24. Most college-age individuals with psychiatric disorders did not seek treatment in the previous year, regardless of their educational status. Common mental health problems among college students include anxiety disorders, depression, ADHD, sleep disorders, and suicide.  Depression  Major Depressive Disorder affects more than 16.1 million Americans over the age of 18 in a given year. Mental health issues can hinder student success in college. However, oftentimes college students experiencing depression have not been diagnosed. Demographically, upperclassmen, college students, and those living off campus are considered more likely to be depressed. Common concerns that lead to depression among college students include pressure to perform well academically, worries about success, and thoughts about post-graduation plans. The American College Health Association has been established for students with depression to provide resources, programs, and guidelines and promote mental health services.  Anxiety disorders  College students can experience significant stress and anxiety from having to balance a multitude of responsibilities such as managing rigorous coursework, participating in extracurricular activities, maintaining relationships, working, and managing finances. Anxiety or excessive worry can cause significant impairment in general functioning. Symptoms of general anxiety disorder include restlessness, difficulty concentrating, irritability, fatigue and sleep disturbances. In a 2018 survey, American College Health Association reported that 63.4% of college students experienced overwhelming anxiety and 22.1% were diagnosed or professionally treated within the last 12 months. Students may also experience social anxiety disorder which is characterized by significant anxiety or fear of judgment or embarrassment in social situations such as meeting or conversing with new people, public speaking, and attending parties or social gatherings. Students that have experienced significant traumatic events such as sexual assault may develop post-traumatic stress disorder. In 2015, Association of American Universities conducted a survey on sexual assault misconduct in colleges. 11.7% of students reported to have experienced nonconsensual penetration or sexual touch by physical force or incapacitation while in college.  Sleep disorders  Sleep is important for a person's physical and mental wellbeing, and the average college student is typically not getting the recommended amount of sleep. Not only are parents not around anymore to enforce bedtime but there are also a plethora of classes, parties, extracurriculars, and other events that cause each day to look different from the next. Due to the varying schedules, it is difficult for a college student to establish a routine for sleep, and can increase their risk of developing a sleeping disorder. Poorer sleep quality has been associated with increased reports of externalizing, such as rule-breaking behaviors and physical aggression. A sleeping disorder is a disorder that causes a person to have an abnormal sleep pattern. It can progress into other health problems if not treated. Student sleep habits tend to worsen over time and even time-limited experience of sleep problems may have significant implications for the onset of mental health problems. Some common sleep disorders are insomnia, sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome, and narcolepsy. Some of these conditions can be due to underlying health problems such as depression, anxiety, and panic disorders. Common symptoms include excessive daytime sleepiness, having trouble falling asleep, waking up in the middle of the night and having trouble falling or staying asleep.  ADHD  ADHD is prevalent in around 2-8% of students in the United States, and 25% of students with disabilities. Several studies state higher incidence of alcohol and substance use in students with ADHD. Of note, students with ADHD who took stimulant medications were found to have more problematic drinking habits than those who did not take stimulant medications. There is a wide prevalence of prescription stimulant misuse among college campuses in the United States. The use of stimulants are increasing in students without ADHD, primarily for cognitive and academic improvements. There are numerous misconceptions that entice students to use Adderall as \\"performance enhancers\\", however scientific evidence illustrates a negative association between stimulant use and academic performance. There are potentially negative health effects that unprescribed stimulants may cause, such as elevated blood pressure, paranoia, serious cardiovascular adverse effects and sudden death which are warranted with a black box warning on amphetamine medications.  Eating disorders  Eating disorders are psychological conditions characterized by abnormal and hazardous eating habits. There exist several types, the most common being anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder. Anorexia nervosa occurs when individuals consider themselves as overweight despite being concerningly underweight. Individuals will monitor their weight by restricting consumption of calories and certain foods, and develop an obsession with their body image. Bulimia nervosa is characterized by reoccurring binge-eating episodes following by radical compensatory behaviours including fasting, self- induced vomiting, abuse of laxatives and diuretics, and/or excessive physical exercise. Similar to bulimia nervosa, individuals with binge-eating disorder will consume large portions of food in a short amount of time, but will not engage in compensatory behaviours. Although eating disorders affect individuals of all genders, ethnicities and races, many studies show a disproportionately increased risk among post-secondary students, with majority indicating a higher prevalence rate compared to the general population. This trend can be attributed to the unique challenges faced by college students as they attempt to navigate through and adapt to post-secondary life. Such difficulties include increased stressors and pressure, a lack of academic, social and/or financial structure, and fear of gaining excessive weight, which can exacerbate underlying mental health issues or, in some cases, create new ones. Many students entering post-secondary institutions will already be experimenting with safe dieting methods; however, 35% will progress to pathological dieting, and of those, 20-25% develop partial- or full-syndrome eating disorders. Cases of partial-eating disorders may become spontaneously remised, while a subset transition into a full disorder. According to a report by the National Eating Disorders Association, eating disorders typically occur between the ages of 18‚Äì21, with 10-20% and 4-10% of American college women and men being affected, respectively. Students experiencing symptoms of eating disorders are also more likely to experience psychiatric comorbidity. Members of certain groups within college are more likely to report and experience symptoms of eating disorders, including athletes and transgender students. The National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associating Disorders states that 16% of American transgender students reported having an eating disorder. Another report published by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse found that 35% of female and 10% of male athletes were at risk for anorexia nervosa, while 58% of female and 38% of male athletes were at risk for bulimia nervosa. = Effective interventions = Given that eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of all mental illnesses, early detection, prevention and treatment is of utmost importance when discussing effective recovery. Research shows that receipt of treatment for eating disorders is globally very low, creating a gap wherein individuals in need of care are not receiving proper treatment. Several studies investigating eating disorder prevalence on college campuses in the United States found that less than 20% of students who screened positive for an eating disorder received treatment for their diagnosis. Another study found that 30-70% of North American students seeking treatment for an eating disorder receive medical intervention for a perceived weight problem as opposed to a mental health problem. This is not ideal, as early detection and subsequent management significantly increases the chances of full recovery. It has been found that seeking help is disincentivized when students are not aware of the options available. Therefore, post-secondary institutions have a responsibility to reach out to students, provide tailored feedback on potential symptoms, aid in creating suggestions for future goals, and facilitate the recovery process. Post-secondary campuses in North America already provide accessibility to some programs that are both feasible to deliver and facilitate comprehensive screening. The Healthy Body Image Program is an online platform intended to screen and deliver tailored interventions to students on campuses. The program labels students as low- or high-risk, or identifies those with a possible clinical/subclinical eating disorder. It subsequently offers suitable evidence-based online interventions or a referral to a specialized physician in order to address risks and clinical status. Educational campaigns intended to deliver factual knowledge regarding eating disorders and helpful resources have proven to be most successful when targeting students. Although many colleges in the United States offer annual or bi-annual education programs, very few do so on a monthly or weekly basis, which can impact students‚Äô ability to access proper services. Efficacy of treatments are also reported when there is an emphasis on holistic health and interactive components. Increasing media literacy, specifically concerning distorted media representation of body image, and promoting body satisfaction can improve management skills and encourage positive relationship building. Interventions that aid students in recognizing risk factors, such as sociocultural pressure for certain body types, body dissatisfaction, poor self esteem, and challenges with weight management deliver improvements in regards to body satisfaction. Additionally, interventions that promote weight control through healthy dietary techniques, utilize persuasion principles (e.g. foot-in-the-door method), and include motivational enhancement exercises have been reported to improve weight gain and functional impairment. = Treatment gaps = Early treatment could reduce the persistence of these disorders, and their associated functional impairment, loss of productivity and increased health care costs. Important aspects of treatment to consider when treating college students with mental health problems are outlined, such as the importance of including parents in the treatment, communicating with other providers, and employing of technology to increase adherence. It is concluded that, by becoming familiar with the unique problems characteristic of the developmental stage and environment college students are in, practitioners will be able to better serve them. Lack of identification or acknowledgement (denial) of mental health symptoms and/or lack of or inadequate treatment are common problems among college students and may contribute to the persistence of mental health problems in this population. Although there are a number of helpful online and in-person detection services offered by post-secondary institutions, there is still a significant gap in regards to treatment of eating disorders on campuses. The National Eating Disorder Association found that therapeutic and counseling services were reported to be of highest importance; however, availability is scarce among staff who are specifically trained in counseling and nutritional services. Furthermore, there exists a lack of detection and treatment options to match the unique needs of sexual minority students, racial minority students, and college athletes, who appear to be at higher risk for eating disorders or related behaviours. As such, it is imperative for personnel to be properly trained in order to provide culturally and socially tailored help. = Alcohol and other drug use = The most common college health key performance indicator relates to levels and the management of alcohol and other drug (AOD) misuse and abuse. Substance abuse has been shown to peak in early adulthood. In college and university students, substance use is predicted by many factors including sensation seeking behavioural tendencies, perceived use of substances by peers, biological markers, and habits prior to post-secondary education. In North America, alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco are the most frequently used and misused substances.  Alcohol  Alcohol is the most heavily-consumed substance globally, accounting for 4.6% of the global burden of disease with young adults disproportionately affected. According to the 2018 National College Health Assessment (NCHA) administered to college and university students in North America, 60.6% of males and 62.5% of females reported consuming alcohol within the last 30 days. Student perceptions about the frequency of alcohol use by their peers proved to be higher than reality, with NCHA results indicating that students perceived 93.2% of their peers to have consumed alcohol within 30 days. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism suggests that around 1,400 college students between the ages of 18-24 die annually as a result of alcohol consumption, and around half a million students sustain injuries under the influence of alcohol. Many post-secondary institutions have introduced harm reduction programs with the goal of reducing problematic alcohol consumption habits among students. As of 2010, 98% of colleges in the United States used programming in order to reduce the risk of student drinking. In 2002, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism's Task Force on College Drinking published a set of recommendations for colleges and universities to reduce dangerous drinking behaviours. These guidelines included both individual-level and population-level strategies, including restricting alcohol consumption on campus, campaigns addressing social norms, and targeted educational initiatives. However, research suggests that these recommendations are not followed properly in American colleges, and updated approaches may be required. Some emerging strategies focus on the role of social media in propagating alcohol culture on post-secondary campuses. It has been found that increased marketing of alcoholic products is positively correlated with consumption by youth, a problem which has been exacerbated in recent years through the growing popularity of social media advertisements.  Tobacco  Tobacco can be consumed in a variety of forms with popular options for post-secondary students including cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and waterpipes. Tobacco consumption rates in post-secondary students vary dependent on the geographical location and gender of student. In North America, the National College Health Assessment (NCHA) for spring 2019 reported that 6.4% of students used cigarettes within the last 30 days, 12.6% used e-cigarettes, and 2.1% used water pipes (also known as shisha or hookah). In each category, use of tobacco products by men was more frequent. North American college students vastly overestimate the use of tobacco products by their peers, with cigarette use estimated at 70.2%, e-cigarettes estimated at 83.1%, and water pipes estimated at 58.2%. Initially, e-cigarettes (also known as 'vapes') were viewed as a safer alternative to cigarettes, but are known to have expanded the tobacco market due to their appeal to youth. College students have been found to underestimate the dangers and addictiveness of e-cigarettes as compared to conventional cigarettes. While e-cigarettes contain lower levels of carcinogens than cigarettes, they still expose the user to ultrafine particles and other toxins that can increase risk of chronic disease. Many post-secondary institutions in North America implement anti- smoking programs, exemplified by around 2000 smoke-free college sites in the United States and at least 65 in Canada. Many of these programs are expanded to all tobacco products, and aim to reduce student exposure to second-hand smoke, discourage use of tobacco products, and eliminate litter created by cigarette butts.  Cannabis  Marijuana is one of the most widely used drugs among young adults. According to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, 22% of college students and young adults report consuming marijuana within the past month. Data has shown that the proportion of young individuals who perceive marijuana as dangerous is decreasing, which may hinder prevention efforts, such as those against the emerging and popular administration route of vaping. Frequent use of marijuana by young people may be associated with poor health outcomes.  Additional drugs include  Other substances used by post-secondary students vary by geographic location, gender, socioeconomic status, and other factors. Substances used by college students include prescription opioids, amphetamines and other stimulants, hallucinogens, and sedatives. Opioids are a class of drugs that can relax the body and relieve pain. In the United States, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) reported that misuse of prescription opioids has dropped from 5.4% of college students in 2013 to 2.7% in 2018. Examples of prescription opioids include hydrocodone (Vicodin¬Æ), codeine, oxycodone (OxyContin¬Æ, Percocet¬Æ), and fentanyl. Misuse of opioids has resulted in the opioid epidemic affecting primarily North American countries. Amphetamine and Dextroamphetamine (Adderall) is a medication used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Adderall falls under the drug class called stimulants. Over 2.5 million Americans are prescribed Adderall, and roughly 50% of college students that were prescribed this drug have been asked by their peers if they can buy some. Adderall is linked to aggression, restlessness, increased blood pressure and heart rate, paranoia, psychosis, seizures, heart attack, and stroke. Adderall is known to only improve the cognitive processing in those who have conditions such as ADHD; for individuals with no cognitive condition, the drug should have no effect and taking this drug can result in negative effects. Other prescription stimulant drugs include Concerta¬Æ and Ritalin¬Æ, which are both brand names for methylphenidate hydrochloride. Non-prescription stimulant drugs include cocaine and methamphetamine (commonly known as meth). The NIDA has reported that 11.4% of young adults aged 18‚Äì25 have used cocaine in their lifetime. Hallucinogens alter one's perceptions of reality as well as their thoughts and emotions. This class of drugs include psilocybin (commonly known as magic mushrooms or shrooms), D-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), salvia, and ketamine. The NIDA reports that over two hundred thousand Americans over the age of 12 reported use of LSD within the past month. Sedative drugs, such as benzodiazepines, are often used to relieve anxiety or induce sleep. This class of drugs includes diazepam (Valium¬Æ), lorazepam (Ativan), and Alprazolam (Xanax). A 2001 study of college students from 119 American 4-year college programs found that 7.8% of students had tried benzodiazepines in their lifetime. = Sexual health =  Sexually transmitted infections  College health key performance indicator relating to levels harm from sexual activity are common. Although anyone engaging in sexual activity can contract a sexually transmitted infection (STI), adolescents are particularly susceptible and account for increased prevalence rates compared to the general population. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that youth aged 15‚Äì24 account for the highest incidence of combined total cases of gonorrhea, chlamydia and syphilis in 2015. This age group made up 65% of chlamydia cases, and 53% of gonorrhea cases. Additionally, a study found that 15% of respondents in a sample of 2000 current and former American college students report never using a condom, and 4% only do so when their partner asks. Given college students fall within the age range of 15‚Äì24, and are more inclined to engage in casual sexual encounters without proper protection, post-secondary institutions hold a responsibility to ensure adequate STI screening and education prevention. One study investigated the prevalence of chlamydia among college students in the United States, and found that routine screening is not available, or easily accessible, at most post-secondary institutions.  Common services, programs and policies included in advancing the health and wellbeing of College and University students  = Psychological counseling and other mental healthcare services = Post-secondary institutions are faced with the challenge of attempting to prevent, identify and treat mental illnesses among college students. Some challenges arise from fragmented services, reactive responses, piecemeal funding and high resource needs, among other potential factors. A report by the Ontario College Health Association found that college students were more than twice as likely to report mental illness symptoms and elevated stress levels than non-college students. This growing demand for on- campus resources may be related to increased numbers of nontraditional students, such as students with disabilities. As a result, smaller institutions, which tend to have fewer mental health professionals and greater budgetary constraints, may experience enhanced resource strain and greater challenges in addressing the mental health concerns of their students. However, when looking at these services, culture needs to be taken into account, since traditionally under represented students are less likely to seek psychological counseling as opposed to their classmates. The interventions used by many of these American universities, use a more western approach to service delivery which tends to inadequately address the mental health concerns of the culturally diverse communities that make up these universities. While the goal of post-secondary institutions is not necessarily to provide psychiatric interventions, an increasing number of academic institutions strive towards establishing guidelines and developing on-campus mental healthcare services. Although elements of screening, identification, and treatment services exist across post-secondary institutions, the accessibility of and available resources is variable. The student counselling centre is most commonly identified as responsible for mental health care and support, with electronic self-referrals via online counselling centre websites becoming increasingly common. Moreover, the use of internet-based technology typically involves cognitive behavioural therapy, one of the most commonly employed mediums targeting depression and anxiety among the student population. Associated with significant positive outcomes, this intervention appears to be promising for students in university settings. Some campuses are working towards establishing meaningful connection with Aboriginal, international and LGBT students to increase social and mental health support among vulnerable student populations. For instance, E-health interventions linking traditionally under represented students with culturally connected providers is a potential service that academic institutions could consider implementing. Many counseling centers are reorienting towards prevention and providing opportunities for personal skills development that are unique and separate from traditional methods of talk therapies. The efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions in the college setting has been a recent topic of exploration. A randomized control trial examined the efficacy of an Internet-based mindfulness training program (iMIND) and an Internet-based cognitive-behavioral training program (iCBT) in promoting mental health outcomes among Hong-Kong college students. Each 8-week long program consisted of eight 30- to 45-minute sessions involving didactic readings, experiential learning (e.g. guided meditation) and daily life applications (e.g. developing self-awareness). Both programs showed potential in improving mental well- being, psychological distress and life satisfaction from pre- to post- assessment. = Physical activity, recreation, nutrition and other health- related campus services = College represents a key period to engage and influence numerous health behaviors among young adults, including promoting physical activity. Regular physical activity has been recognized as fundamental to the improvement of both physical and psychological functioning. Promoting physical activity among college and university students can provide an opportunity to encourage long-term active habits. Approximately half or more of university students in the United States, Canada, and China were categorized as insufficiently active. Seminars and counselor-led workshops dealing with recommendations and strategies to maintaining an active lifestyle appear to be effective means of preserving or enhancing healthy behaviours during the transition into university life. Studies have also suggested that information about the benefits of physical activity could have a greater effect on college students‚Äô general health, mental health, and happiness when positively framed. NIRSA comprises and supports leaders in collegiate recreation The college years are a potential period for nutrition-related interventions, as eating behaviours among college students may carry over to later life. Healthy or poor nutritional habits among college students may stem from the interplay of several components, including personal, sociocultural and economic factors. Low-intake of fruits and vegetables among students may result from relatively low amounts of these foods in traditional dishes and unfamiliarity with reading and comprehending food labels. In addition to these sociocultural and educational barriers, other factors such as such as the cost of living and food availability at college are cited as hurdles even for motivated students. On the other hand, factors such as individual knowledge and awareness as well as parental support are cited as having a positive influence in promoting healthy eating among students. A variety of social change campaigns have been explored as options to promote healthy eating in the college setting. Ensuring easy availability of fruits and vegetables on- campus through farmers' markets or the cafeteria consistently providing healthier alternatives are potential strategies. Utilizing promotional point- of-purchase messages in the cafeteria is another method that may encourage students to make healthier choices. National Association of College and University Food Services (NACUFS) can be significant partners in achieving key performance indicators in college health.

It is usually written by a screenwriter who hopes to have the script optioned and eventually purchased by a producer, production company, or studio. Spec scripts which have gone on to win Academy Awards include Thelma & Louise (sold by Callie Khouri to MGM for US$500,000 in 1990), Good Will Hunting (sold by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck to Miramax Films for US$675,000 in 1994) and American Beauty (sold by Alan Ball to DreamWorks SKG for US$250,000 in 1998), which all won Best Original Screenplay. A spec script reads differently from a shooting script or a production script in that there is more focus on the story itself while focus on camera movements and other directing aspects should be rarely, if ever, used. Camera directions and technical directions are often added in the later drafts. The sole purpose of a spec script, also known as the selling script, is to showcase a screenwriter's talent at telling a story through action and dialogue. Spec scripts are often written by unknown screenwriters looking to prove their storytelling ability and make a name for themselves in the film industry. History In 1933, Preston Sturges is believed to have sold the first spec script in Hollywood history. Fox bought The Power and the Glory for US$17,500 plus back-end revenue. The movie did poorly at the box office. However, in 2014 the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. Spec scripts have not always held as much cachet in the business as they do now. Ernest Lehman describes how his original script for North by Northwest was unusual at that point in his career: In the late 1960s, William Goldman sold his spec script Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid to Warner Bros. for US$400,000 in a studio bidding war. The script went on to win the Academy Award for Best Screenplay. This event precipitated a rise in screenwriters writing on spec. Attracting producers If the writer of a spec script has an agent, the agent will identify a number of prospective buyers who may range from small independent producers to executives working in the major studios, and attempt to build up \\"heat\\" under the script. The script may be sent out simultaneously to all the prospective buyers in the hope of attracting a bidding war. If the script sells, the writer may receive a payment of anything from a few tens of thousands of dollars to several million. The script may then be developed even further until it is \\"greenlit\\" ‚Äì meaning it goes into production. If not, the script is sometimes dead in the water because it is now in the databases of the studios and development executives, and has been marked as having been \\"passed\\" on. There is the chance, however, a film that has not been greenlit could make The Black List ‚Äì \\"a list of the ten best unproduced specs.\\" If a spec script is not picked up, but the writing is good, the screenwriter may be offered a writing assignment. This could be a \\"development deal\\" ‚Äì where a studio or producer asks a screenwriter to write another original script or adapt an idea or book into a screenplay. Outside of the traditional route of finding an agent, there are a number of competitions that a screenwriter can enter, such as the Nicholl Fellowship or Final Draft's Big Break Contest, among others. Another way a screenwriter could attract a producer is by paying a small fee and posting their screenplay on an \\"online posting.\\" When using this service, a screenwriter posts their screenplay and after receiving feedback, if the screenplay is good, it will be posted to the service's main web site.

Prichard-Jones Sir John Prichard-Jones, 1st Baronet (31 May 1841 ‚Äì 17 October 1917) was a self-made Welsh business man of the Victorian and Edwardian era. His main business was the London West End department store Dickins & Jones. For most of his life, his name was John Jones. In 1917, a few years after being created a baronet, and a few months before his death, he changed his surname by deed poll to Prichard-Jones. Life Born to a Welsh- speaking family at Tyn-Coed, a small farm near Newborough, Anglesey.University of Wales Bangor Prichard-Jones Institute Papers - ref: GB 0222 BMSS PJI His parents were Richard Jones, farmer, and Jane Jones, formerly Owen. He was aged one month on the 1841 census when he is recorded with father and mother Richard and Jane, aged 35 and 30, and siblings Elinor, Richard, William and Owen, aged 15, 9, 6 and 4. At the age of fourteen Jones was apprenticed to a draper in Caernarfon and afterwards moved to Pwllheli, then to Bangor and eventually, when he was nineteen, to London. In 1872 he entered the firm of Dickins, Smith & Stevens in Regent Street. There he was successively promoted to buyer, manager, director, chairman of the board and finally to partner, when the name of the store was changed to Dickins & Jones. He was also involved in the management of other businesses and was prominent in movements for the promotion of workers' welfare, as well as supporting profit-sharing schemes for his employees. He was Treasurer of the Welsh National Museum and a member of the Council of the North Wales University College at Bangor, of which he was a generous benefactor, becoming Vice-President of the College Council in 1909. The University of Wales awarded him an honorary doctorate. Jones maintained lifelong links with his native county, where he had a home, Bron Menai, Dwyran. He was made High Sheriff of Anglesey for 1905, and in 1910 a Deputy Lieutenant of Anglesey and a Baronet, for his services to education and the community. As well as his house in Wales, Jones had a country house at Elstree, in Hertfordshire called Maes yr H√¢v. In 1911 he married secondly Marie, the younger daughter of Charles Read, and with her had two sons. He died at his London home in 1917, the result of an accident. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his elder son, also called John Prichard-Jones, then aged four.  The Prichard Jones Institute  The Prichard Jones Institute, opened in 1905at Newborough, Anglesey, may be described as a community centre for the people of Newborough. It consisted of a library, facilities for exhibitions, meetings and lectures. Also on the site were cottages which were made available to local elderly people, subject to certain criteria, who would also be paid a pension from a fund established by Sir John Prichard-Jones. The fund was financed through monies gained from a property in London, but unfortunately the property was destroyed through bombing during World War II. Without this fund the building has fallen into disrepair and requires renovation.BBC - History - REGIONAL RUNNER-UP: The Prichard Jones Institute, Newborough, Anglesey In 2006 the Pritchard Jones Institute was one of the buildings nominated for the BBC television show Restoration.

Tajbeg Palace was guarded by Afghan National Army. In the ensuing battle, Afghan armed forces suffered major losses. 30 Afghan palace guards and over 300 army guards were killed while 150 were captured. Amin's 11-year-old son died from shrapnel wounds. A total of 1,700 Afghan soldiers surrendered to Soviet troops and were taken as prisoners. The Soviets installed Babrak Karmal as Amin's successor. Several other government buildings were seized during the operation, including the Ministry of Interior building, the Internal Security (KHAD) building, and the General Staff building (Darul Aman Palace). Alpha Group veterans call this operation one of the most successful in the group's history. Declassified Russian documents show that the Soviet leadership believed that Amin had secret contacts with the US embassy and was probably a US agent.John K. Cooley (2002) Unholy Wars. Pluto Press. p. 8. However, this assumption was later proven to be false. Background The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan was initially led by Nur Muhammad Taraki, who was pro- Soviet Union, which resulted in cordial Afghan‚ÄìSoviet relations. In September 1979, Taraki was deposed by Hafizullah Amin, due to intra-party strife. After this event and the suspicious death of Taraki (an apparent assassination by Amin's orders), Afghan‚ÄìSoviet relations started to deteriorate; by December the Soviet leadership had established an alliance with Babrak Karmal. The Soviet Union declared its plan to intervene in Afghanistan on 12 December 1979, and the Soviet leadership initiated Operation Storm-333 (the first phase of the intervention) on 27 December 1979. Soviet forces Storm-333 was part of a bigger operation, Baikal-79, aimed at taking control over approximately 20 key strongholds in and around Kabul, which included major military headquarters, communication centers and jails.Dmitri Volin (25 December 2019) –£—á–∞—Å—Ç–Ω–∏–∫ —à—Ç—É—Ä–º–∞ –¥–≤–æ—Ä—Ü–∞ –ê–º–∏–Ω–∞: –º—ã —à–ª–∏ –ø–æ–¥ –ø—Ä—è–º–æ–π –∞–≤—Ç–æ–º–∞—Ç–Ω—ã–π –æ–≥–æ–Ω—å. tass.ru.

This motorized rifle battalion had been formed in the USSR earlier in 1979 at the specific request of the Afghan leader to guard his residence as he could not rely on Afghan troops. These support troops were not issued armor or helmets, but one of them recalls that a magazine tucked inside his clothes protected him from an SMG bullet. Palace assault and death of Amin Photograph taken by a Soviet official of the Tajbeg Palace following the operation The raid on the Tajbeg Palace, where General Secretary Amin was in residence with his family at the suggestion of his KGB security advisers, took place around 7 p.m. on 27 December 1979. The Tajbeg Palace was guarded by Afghan National Army. During the attack, Amin still believed the Soviet Union was on his side, and told his adjutant, \\"The Soviets will help us\\". The adjutant replied that it was the Soviets who were attacking them; Amin initially replied that this was a lie. Only after he tried but failed to contact the Chief of the General Staff, he muttered, \\"I guessed it. It's all true.\\" He was captured alive by Grom troops, but semi-conscious, suffering convulsions due to interrupted medical treatment of the poisoning. The exact details of his later death have never been confirmed by any eye witness. The official announcement of his death on Kabul Radio, as reported by the New York Times on 27 December 1979, was \\"Amin had been sentenced to death at a revolutionary trial for crimes against the state and that sentence had been carried out\\". One story at the time was Amin was killed by Sayed Mohammad Gulabzoy, a previous Minister of Communication until ousted by Amin, who was present with two other previous ministers during the assault to give credence it was an Afghan-controlled operation. Gulabzoy and Watanjar, the previous Minister for Defense, later confirmed his death. This story of his death after a summary trial is supported by the fate of Amin supporters who a 'Revolutionary Troika' arrested and sentenced to death, were executed on the spot with a bullet in the back of the neck. Amin's son was fatally wounded and died shortly after. Amin's daughter was wounded, but survived. 348 other Afghans, including 30 of Amin's most personal guards from Palace and Leader's guards, also died in the fighting, and part of the palace went up in flames. 150 of the 180 Palace and Leader's guards, who were regular troops, surrendered when they realized the attacking troops were from the USSR, not from an Afghan unit.. A total of 1,700 Afghan soldiers surrender to Soviet troops and they were taken as prisoners. The whole operation took about 40 minutes. Soviet losses During the assault on the Tajbeg 5 officers of the KGB special forces, 7 troops from the \\"Muslim Battalion\\", and 2 paratroopers were killed. The commander of the KGB contingent, Col. Boyarinov, was killed. All the surviving participants in the KGB troops in the operation were wounded. Also, Soviet army doctor Colonel V.P. Kuznechenkov who was treating General Secretary Amin was killed by friendly fire in the palace, and was posthumously awarded the Order of the Red Banner.Peter Tomsen (9 June 2011). Wars of Afghanistan (1st ed.). PublicAffairs. p. 174. . Memoirs of the participants According to Oleg Balashov, who was second in command of the assault group, the group was led by two elite units of Alpha and Vympel (15‚Äì20 each). The Alpha group targeted Amin, and the Vympel group had the task of collecting factual evidence that Amin was collaborating with the United States. Both groups were brought to Afghanistan secretly and blended with Muslim Battalions to make an impression that the operation was carried out by local units, whereas in reality nearly all work was done by Alpha and Vympel. Before the operation, Balashov surveyed the area under the guise of a bodyguard of a Soviet diplomat. His unit knew that they were going to a death zone and felt uncomfortable about it ‚Äì about 80% of them were wounded shortly after they left their vehicles, yet they continued the assault. As Balashov expected, Amin's troops targeted the first and last vehicle in the convoy of six. He placed his team of five men in the front BMP and, when the BMP got immobilized by fire from Amin's troops, ordered them to abandon the BMP and run to the palace. All five were quickly wounded by intensive fire from the guards, but were saved by bulletproof vests and helmets.Interview with Colonel Oleg Balashov.

It takes inspiration from mid-twentieth century designs such as Rockwell. The face is unique for combining the geometric structure of twentieth-century European slab-serifs but imbuing the face with a domestic, less strident tone of voice. Balls were added to the upper terminals on letters such as C and G to increase its charm. Italics are true italic designs, with flourishes influenced by calligraphy, an unusual feature for geometric slab serif designs. As with many Hoefler & Frere-Jones designs, it was released in a wide range of weights from hairline to bold, reflecting its design goal as a typeface for complex magazines.

The style refers to traditional building designs characterised by widely projecting roofs and facades richly decorated with wooden balconies and carved ornaments. It spread over Germany, Austria-Hungary and Scandinavia during the Belle √âpoque era. History Villa Fridheim in Kr√∏dsherad, Norway Swiss chalet style originated in the Romantic era of the late 18th- and early 19th-century, when the ideas of the English landscape garden inspired parks and residences in Germany, such as the Dessau- W√∂rlitz Garden Realm. It became highly appreciated on the continent by noble landowners who were impressed by the \\"simple life\\" of people living in the mountains. The chalet style soon spread over the German Mittelgebirge landscapes such as the Harz mountains or the Dresden area and the adjacent North Bohemian region. As a \\"modern\\" building style, it also influenced the resort architecture along the Baltic seaside, like in Binz or Heringsdorf. Around 1900, design elements were used in the construction of numerous bourgeois family homes as well as by notable architects like Heinrich von Ferstel to build larger mansions and hotels. The style was further popularized by the first waves of tourism of rich people from the North and West of Europe and became popular in other parts of Europe and North America, notably in the architecture of Norway, Iceland and the Netherlands and in the country house architecture of Sweden and Cincinnati (Ohio, USA), in the late 19th and early 20th century. English examples of the chalet style include the Boathouse at Belton House, Lincolnshire, by Anthony Salvin and the Swiss Cottage at Osbourne House, on the Isle of Wight, constructed for Queen Victoria's children. Characteristics The style is characterized by: * gabled roofs with wide eaves * exposed construction beams, including large brackets * decorative carving and mouldings * balconies * large windows * weatherboarding, usually painted, often in bright colors Gallery File:ER- Burgberg-old-villa.jpgVilla in Erlangen File:Villa Eschebach Wei√üer Hirsch Dresden.JPGVilla Eschebach in Dresden File:Kviknes hotel.jpgKviknes Hotel in Balestrand, Norway, planned by Franz Wilhelm Schiertz in 1894 File:Valkenburg- Neerhem 68 (1).JPGHotel Rooding in Valkenburg (1892), designed by Pierre Cuypers File:Edwin J.

He wrestled primarily in Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW), where he won every major championship and was the first inductee into the CZW Hall of Fame in 2004. He was formerly the CZW Commissioner/Talent Coordinator. Career =1999-2002= Along with Nick Gage, Justice Pain, and Ric Blade, Lobo was trained by John Zandig at the CZW Wrestling School and graduated first in the class.CZWHookup : The history of CZW He became one of the main wrestlers in CZW along with other graduates from the school. In February 1999, Lobo became the second Iron Man Champion. He held the title until June when he lost it to Justice Pain. These two continued wrestling each other and competed in the first ever Cage of Death match at the first Cage of Death show. Lobo won the match and regained the title. He would lose this title to Wifebeater, but regain it one more time the following year. Lobo also challenged for the CZW Heavyweight Championship. He feuded with Zandig for the title and finally beat him in July 2000. He held the title until Cage of Death II. At that show, Lobo successfully defended the championship against Zandig in the Cage of Death match. Directly following this match, Justice Pain came out and fought Lobo in another Cage of Death match. In the match, Lobo was thrown from the top of the cage to the ground through a table covered in barbed wire. Justice Pain went on to win the match and the title. After losing the title, Lobo continued feuding with Zandig. This time, the feud was for ownership of CZW. On February 9, 2002, Lobo defeated Zandig to become the new owner of CZW. He held this position until Cage of Death IV when Zandig defeated him to regain his position as CZW's owner =2003-present= He took some time off from CZW following the Cage of Death match. While he was gone, a new group called the Hi-V tried to take over CZW, with Zandig as their main target. Zandig was planning to face the Hi-V at Cage of Death V, but the stable outnumbered his team 6 to 4. At Night of Infamy II, Lobo made a shocking return to help Zandig and join his team just in time for Cage of Death. Their team was successful. In February 2004, Lobo became the first inductee to the CZW Hall of Fame. After this, Lobo remained inactive for the following two years. At Cage of Death 7, Zandig, who had turned on the fans, wanted to run CZW the way they used to. He called out Lobo, who was backstage for the event, and they joined each other along with Justice Pain and Nick Gage. They would later call themselves the Forefathers of CZW.

Often a variant of anti-ship missile designs an anti-submarine systems typically use a jet or rocket engine, to deliver: an explosive warhead aimed directly at a submarine; a depth charge, or; a homing torpedo that is carried from a launch ship, or other platform, to the vicinity of a target. Ikara, an Australian-designed missile used by several navies between the 1960s and 1990s; a rocket-parachute delivery system carried an acoustic torpedo up to 10 nautical miles (19 km) after launch. A variant re-designed in the UK and used by the Royal Navy could deliver a nuclear depth charge. The Malafon, used by the French Navy between 1966 and 1997, used a rocket-assisted glider to carry a torpedo up to 8 nautical miles (13 km) after launch. History Depth charges were the earliest weapons designed for use by ships against submerged submarines. These explosives were initially dropped as the ship moved over the presumed location of a submarine. Before World War II, shipboard sonar was unable to maintain contact with a submarine at close range. Various mortar-type projectors, including Hedgehog and Squid, were devised during World War II to allow a ship to maintain sonar contact while lobbing explosive charges toward the submarine.Hughes, Terry, and Costello, John The Battle of the Atlantic (1977) Dial Press pp.307-308 During the Cold War, missiles were developed to provide greater range with reduced recoil. Some missiles and rockets, such as Hong Sang Eo carry homing torpedoes to provide terminal guidance for the warhead.Albrecht, Gerhard Weyer's Warships of the World (1969) United States Naval Institute p.385 The advantage of an anti-submarine missile is the attack stand-off range. The Swedish Bofors 375mm m/50 Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) rockets, in the past commonly used by Sweden, France, Japan and Germany for instance, can travel as far as 3600m depending on the rocket used.https://www.forecastinternational.com/archive/disp_old_pdf.cfm?ARC_ID=1714 The USSR developed its own anti-submarine rockets in the RBU series and these are still in use in Russia and in countries using Russian designed ships. Today anti-submarine rockets have been phased out in most western navies, replaced by the Homing ASW Torpedo.

This species inhabits areas with poor visibility, soft bottoms, and large tides, with immature sharks ranging into fresh and brackish water. It is similar to other river sharks in having a stocky grey body with a high back, tiny eyes, and broad fins. It measures up to long. Northern river sharks are likely piscivorous. This species is viviparous, with females bearing litters of 9 young possibly every other year before the wet season. Very rare and facing threats from commercial and recreational fishing, and perhaps also habitat degradation, this species has been assessed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Taxonomy The first known specimens of the northern river shark, two newborn males from Papua New Guinea, were discovered by New Zealand ichthyologist Jack Garrick, after whom the species was eventually named. This shark was referred to as \\"Glyphis sp. C\\" until 2008, when it was formally described by Leonard Compagno, William White, and Peter R. Last in a Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation paper. The type specimen is a female long, collected from the East Alligator River, Kakadu National Park, Northern Territory. (ISBN corrected) (invalid, listed in publication). Distribution and habitat The northern river shark has been reported from King Sound, the Ord River, and Doctors Creek near Derby, Western Australia, the Adelaide and Alligator Rivers in Australia's Northern Territory, and the Daru region and possibly the Fly River in Papua New Guinea. It inhabits large rivers, estuaries, and coastal bays, all of which are characterized by high turbidity, silty or muddy bottoms, and large tides. Young and juvenile sharks are found in fresh, brackish, and salt water (salinity ranging from 2 to 36 ppt), whereas adults have only been found in marine environments. Description Like other members of its genus, the northern river shark has a stocky body with a high back. The head is wide and flattened, with a broadly rounded snout and minute eyes equipped with nictitating membranes. Each nostril is divided into a very large incurrent opening and a small excurrent opening by a triangular skin flap. The sizable mouth is broadly arched, with short furrows at the corners. Thirty-one to 34 tooth rows are in the upper jaw and 30-35 tooth rows are in the lower jaw; the upper teeth are upright and triangular with serrated edges, while the lower teeth are narrower and straight to slightly curved. In the largest individuals, the first few lower teeth from the jaw median are spear- shaped with serrations near the tip. The pectoral fins are large and broad, with gently backward-curving margins and pointed tips. The pelvic fins are triangular with nearly straight trailing margins. The first dorsal fin is long-based and triangular, with the apex almost forming a right angle; the second dorsal fin is some two-thirds as high as the first. The origin of the first dorsal fin lies over the pectoral fin insertions, while that of second dorsal fin lies over the pelvic fin rear tips. No ridge exists between the dorsal fins. The anal fin is smaller than the second dorsal fin and has a strong notch in the rear margin. The caudal fin has a strong lower lobe and a long, narrow upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip. The dermal denticles are small, oval, and overlapping, bearing three horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. This shark is steel-gray above and white below; the color transition is sharp, located well below the eye, and becomes jagged on the sides of the trunk. The anal and caudal fins become dusky or black towards the trailing margins and tips. The maximum known length is . This species differs from the speartooth shark (G. glyphis) in several morphological and meristic characters, including having fewer vertebrae (137-151 versus 213-222) and a lower, jagged gray-white color boundary. Biology and ecology With its slender teeth, small eyes, and high density of ampullae of Lorenzini, the northern river shark seems to be adapted for hunting fish in conditions of poor visibility. In Doctors Creek, sharks may move to and from favored feeding areas with the tide.Thorburn, D.C., D.L. Morgan, A.J. Rowland and H.S. Gill. (February 2004). The northern river shark (Glyphis sp. C) in Western Australia . Report to the National Heritage Trust, Murdoch University. Retrieved on 10 January 2010. Like other requiem sharks, this species is viviparous, with the developing embryos forming a placental connection to their mother after exhausting their supply of yolk. Females give birth around October, before the start of the wet season, on possibly a biennial cycle. One female examined contained nine fetuses. The young are born at under long; males mature between lengths of , while females mature between lengths of . Human interactions The northern river shark appears to be extremely rare, though more subpopulations may remain to be discovered in Australia and Papua New Guinea. Based on present information, no more than 250 mature individuals are estimated to exist in the wild, with no more than 50 in any particular subpopulation. This species is caught legally and illegally by commercial fisheries using longlines and gillnets, as well as by recreational fishers; habitat degradation may pose a further threat to its survival. Because of its low natural abundance, limited distribution, stringent habitat requirements, and susceptibility to various human-caused threats, the IUCN has assessed the northern river shark as critically endangered. It has also been listed as endangered on the 1999 Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, and on the 2000 Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act. Kakadu National Park may be an important protected area for this species. No regulations restrict the capture of this species in Papua New Guinea.

Dedicated on September 30, 1943 and completed late in October 1943, it was originally a multi-denominational chapel shared by Catholic, Protestant and Jewish congregations.Church History , United Church, Chapel on the Hill website, accessed March 5, 2010  Architectural design  The building design is a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 700-series U.S. Army chapel.Chapel on the Hill in Jackson Square ‚Äì the original Townsite, Oak Ridge Convention and Visitors' Bureau It is a frame building built on a three-bay rectangular plan with a steepled bell tower and a gable entry porch. It was one of three Army chapels built using the same design in Oak Ridge during World War II. One of the other two chapels, the West Chapel in the city's West Village area, was later torn down, but the East Chapel in the East Village is still in use.  History  The U.S. Army built the chapel to house religious activities, as one of numerous community facilities in the \\"townsite\\" area of Oak Ridge. The building was dedicated on September 30, 1943, in a ceremony that included prayers and talks by a Jewish rabbi, a Catholic priest, an Episcopal priest, a Baptist minister, and the minister who was serving the United Church congregation that eventually came to own the chapel.Charles W. Johnson and Charles O. Jackson (1981), City Behind a Fence: Oak Ridge, Tennessee, 1942-1946. The University of Tennessee Press. Pages 127-129. Its name, \\"The Chapel on the Hill,\\" comes from a reference in a prayer by the Knoxville Baptist minister who participated in the dedication. The United Church congregation that is housed in the Chapel on the Hill traces its history to July 18, 1943, when some 25 to 30 Christians of diverse denominational backgrounds gathered for Sunday worship in Oak Ridge's main cafeteria. Subsequently, several members of the group made plans to establish an interdenominational Protestant church, led by laypersons, to include all denominations. A Presbyterian minister working in Knoxville was engaged to conduct weekly services, and about 150 people representing 13 Protestant denominations became charter members of \\"the United Church\\". Governing boards of laypersons elected to lead the new congregation took up their duties on October 24, 1943.Pre-1980 Historical Compilation , United Church, Chapel on the Hill website, accessed March 5, 2010 When the Chapel-on-the-Hill was completed that same month, the United Church and the local Roman Catholic Church were given control of the building, as the only two churches then officially operating in the Manhattan Project community. During the war, when Oak Ridge's Manhattan Project facilities were operating around the clock, the chapel building was also in use nearly 24 hours a day as a venue for worship services, weddings, and other occasions for local workers of various Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish religious backgrounds. At the peak of wartime activity in Oak Ridge, when the population exceeded 70,000, the United Church employed four ministers and conducted worship services in the Chapel on the Hill, East Village Chapel, and the Jefferson Theater, as well as Sunday school classes in several local schools and a trailer camp. By 1951, the United Church Chapel-on-the-Hill consolidated as a single interdenominational congregation, making its home in the Chapel on the Hill building. The United Church congregation purchased the chapel and of land from the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission on May 11, 1955 for a price of $17,116. An adjoining educational building was added in 1956-1957. The facility continues to operate as a nondenominational Protestant church under lay leadership, employing ministers with backgrounds in mainstream Protestant denominations.Don Goodwin, \\"The United Church\\" (1980) and \\"A Unique and Lonely Path\\" (2007) , United Church, Chapel on the Hill website, accessed March 5, 2010 Since 2007 it has been affiliated with the Center for Progressive Christianity.The 8 Points of Progressive Christianity , United Church, Chapel on the Hill website, accessed March 5, 2010 The church's motto is \\"Where People from All Denominations Meet in Their Differences, but Are One in Their Search for God.\\" The Chapel-on-the- Hill was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993 as a contributing property in the Oak Ridge Historic District.

Open data is the idea that some data should be freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish, without restrictions from copyright, patents or other mechanisms of control. The goals of the open-source data movement are similar to those of other \\"open(-source)\\" movements such as open-source software, hardware, open content, open education, open educational resources, open government, open knowledge, open access, open science, and the open web. Paradoxically, the growth of the open data movement is paralleled by a rise in intellectual property rights. The philosophy behind open data has been long established (for example in the Mertonian tradition of science), but the term \\"open data\\" itself is recent, gaining popularity with the rise of the Internet and World Wide Web and, especially, with the launch of open-data government initiatives such as Data.gov, Data.gov.uk and Data.gov.in. Open data can also be linked data; when it is, it is linked open data. One of the most important forms of open data is open government data (OGD), which is a form of open data created by ruling government institutions. Open government data's importance is borne from it being a part of citizens' everyday lives, down to the most routine/mundane tasks that are seemingly far removed from government.  Overview  The concept of open data is not new, but a formalized definition is relatively new. Conceptually, open data as a phenomenon denotes that governmental data should be available to anyone with a possibility of redistribution in any form without any copyright restriction. One more definition is the Open Definition which can be summarized in the statement that \\"A piece of data is open if anyone is free to use, reuse, and redistribute it ‚Äì subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and/or share-alike.\\"See Open Definition home page and the full Open Definition Other definitions, including the Open Data Institute's \\"Open data is data that anyone can access, use or share\\", have an accessible short version of the definition but refer to the formal definition. Open data may include non- textual material such as maps, genomes, connectomes, chemical compounds, mathematical and scientific formulae, medical data, and practice, bioscience and biodiversity. Problems often arise because these are commercially valuable or can be aggregated into works of value. Access to, or re-use of, the data is controlled by organisations, both public and private. Control may be through access restrictions, licenses, copyright, patents and charges for access or re-use. Advocates of open data argue that these restrictions are against the common good and that these data should be made available without restriction or fee. In addition, it is important that the data are re-usable without requiring further permission, though the types of re-use (such as the creation of derivative works) may be controlled by a license. A typical depiction of the need for open data: Creators of data often do not consider the need to state the conditions of ownership, licensing and re-use; instead presuming that not asserting copyright puts the data into the public domain. For example, many scientists do not regard the published data arising from their work to be theirs to control and consider the act of publication in a journal to be an implicit release of data into the commons. However, the lack of a license makes it difficult to determine the status of a data set and may restrict the use of data offered in an \\"Open\\" spirit. Because of this uncertainty it is also possible for public or private organizations to aggregate said data, protect it with copyright and then resell it. The issue of indigenous knowledge (IK) poses a great challenge in terms of capturing, storage and distribution. Many societies in third-world countries lack the technicality processes of managing the IK. At his presentation at the XML 2005 conference, Connolly displayed these two quotations regarding open data: * \\"I want my data back.\\" (Jon Bosak circa 1997) * \\"I've long believed that customers of any application own the data they enter into it.\\" (This quote refers to Veen's own heart-rate data.) Major sources The State of Open Data, a 2019 book from African Minds Open data can come from any source. This section lists some of the fields that publish (or at least discuss publishing) a large amount of open data. =In science= The concept of open access to scientific data was institutionally established with the formation of the World Data Center system, in preparation for the International Geophysical Year of 1957‚Äì1958. The International Council of Scientific Unions (now the International Council for Science) oversees several World Data Centres with the mandate to minimize the risk of data loss and to maximize data accessibility. While the open-science-data movement long predates the Internet, the availability of fast, ubiquitous networking has significantly changed the context of Open science data, since publishing or obtaining data has become much less expensive and time-consuming. The Human Genome Project was a major initiative that exemplified the power of open data. It was built upon the so-called Bermuda Principles, stipulating that: \\"All human genomic sequence information ... should be freely available and in the public domain in order to encourage research and development and to maximize its benefit to society'.Human Genome Project, 1996. Summary of Principles Agreed Upon at the First International Strategy Meeting on Human Genome Sequencing (Bermuda, 25‚Äì28 February 1996) More recent initiatives such as the Structural Genomics Consortium have illustrated that the open data approach can also be used productively within the context of industrial R&D.; In 2004, the Science Ministers of all nations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which includes most developed countries of the world, signed a declaration which essentially states that all publicly funded archive data should be made publicly available.OECD Declaration on Open Access to publicly funded data Following a request and an intense discussion with data- producing institutions in member states, the OECD published in 2007 the OECD Principles and Guidelines for Access to Research Data from Public Funding as a soft-law recommendation.OECD Principles and Guidelines for Access to Research Data from Public Funding Examples of open data in science: * The Dataverse Network Project ‚Äì archival repository software promoting data sharing, persistent data citation, and reproducible researchDataverse Network Project * data.uni-muenster.de ‚Äì Open data about scientific artifacts from the University of Muenster, Germany. Launched in 2011. * linkedscience.org/data ‚Äì Open scientific datasets encoded as Linked Data. Launched in 2011. * systemanaturae.org ‚Äì Open scientific datasets related to wildlife classified by animal species. Launched in 2015.www.systemanaturae.org =In government= There are a range of different arguments for government open data. For example, some advocates contend that making government information available to the public as machine readable open data can facilitate government transparency, accountability and public participation. \\"Open data can be a powerful force for public accountability‚Äîit can make existing information easier to analyze, process, and combine than ever before, allowing a new level of public scrutiny.\\" Governments that enable public viewing of data can help citizens engage within the governmental sectors and \\"add value to that data.\\" Some make the case that opening up official information can support technological innovation and economic growth by enabling third parties to develop new kinds of digital applications and services. Several national governments have created websites to distribute a portion of the data they collect. It is a concept for a collaborative project in the municipal Government to create and organize culture for Open Data or Open government data. Additionally, other levels of government have established open data websites. There are many government entities pursuing Open Data in Canada. Data.gov lists the sites of a total of 40 US states and 46 US cities and counties with websites to provide open data; e.g. the state of Maryland, the state of California, US and New York City. At the international level, the United Nations has an open data website that publishes statistical data from member states and UN agencies, and the World Bank published a range of statistical data relating to developing countries. The European Commission has created two portals for the European Union: the EU Open Data Portal which gives access to open data from the EU institutions, agencies and other bodies and the PublicData portal that provides datasets from local, regional and national public bodies across Europe. In October 2015, the Open Government Partnership launched the International Open Data Charter, a set of principles and best practices for the release of governmental open data formally adopted by seventeen governments of countries, states and cities during the OGP Global Summit in Mexico. =In non-profit organizations= Many non-profit organizations offer more or less open access to their data, as long it does not undermine their users', members' or third party's privacy rights. In comparison to for-profit corporations, they do not seek to monetize their data. OpenNWT launched a website offering open data of elections. CIAT offers open data to anybody, who is willing to conduct big data analytics in order to enhance the benefit of international agricultural research. DBLP, which is owned by a non-profit organization Dagstuhl, offers its database of scientific publications from computer science as open data. Non-profit hospitality exchange services offer trustworthy teams of scientists access to their anonymized data for publication of insights to the benefit of humanity. Before becoming a for-profit corporation in 2011, Couchsurfing offered 4 research teams access to its social networking data. In 2015, non-profit hospitality exchange services Bewelcome and Warm Showers provided their data for public research. Arguments for and against The debate on open data is still evolving. The best open government applications seek to empower citizens, to help small businesses, or to create value in some other positive, constructive way. Opening government data is only a way-point on the road to improving education, improving government, and building tools to solve other real world problems. While many arguments have been made categorically, the following discussion of arguments for and against open data highlights that these arguments often depend highly on the type of data and its potential uses. Arguments made on behalf of open data include the following: * \\"Data belongs to the human race\\". Typical examples are genomes, data on organisms, medical science, environmental data following the Aarhus Convention * Public money was used to fund the work and so it should be universally available. * It was created by or at a government institution (this is common in US National Laboratories and government agencies) * Facts cannot legally be copyrighted. * Sponsors of research do not get full value unless the resulting data are freely available. * Restrictions on data re-use create an anticommons. * Data are required for the smooth process of running communal human activities and are an important enabler of socio-economic development (health care, education, economic productivity, etc.).\\"Big Data for Development: From Information- to Knowledge Societies\\", Martin Hilbert (2013), SSRN Scholarly Paper No. ID 2205145. Rochester, NY: Social Science Research Network; https://ssrn.com/abstract=2205145 * In scientific research, the rate of discovery is accelerated by better access to data.How to Make the Dream Come True argues in one research area (Astronomy) that access to open data increases the rate of scientific discovery. * Making data open helps combat \\"data rot\\" and ensure that scientific research data are preserved over time. * Statistical literacy benefits from open data. Instructors can use locally relevant data sets to teach statistical concepts to their students. It is generally held that factual data cannot be copyrighted.Towards a Science Commons includes an overview of the basis of openness in science data. However, publishers frequently add copyright statements (often forbidding re- use) to scientific data accompanying publications. It may be unclear whether the factual data embedded in full text are part of the copyright. While the human abstraction of facts from paper publications is normally accepted as legal there is often an implied restriction on the machine extraction by robots. Unlike open access, where groups of publishers have stated their concerns, open data is normally challenged by individual institutions. Their arguments have been discussed less in public discourse and there are fewer quotes to rely on at this time. Arguments against making all data available as open data include the following: * Government funding may not be used to duplicate or challenge the activities of the private sector (e.g. PubChem). * Governments have to be accountable for the efficient use of taxpayer's money: If public funds are used to aggregate the data and if the data will bring commercial (private) benefits to only a small number of users, the users should reimburse governments for the cost of providing the data. * Open data may lead to exploitation of, and rapid publication of results based on, data pertaining to developing countries by rich and well-equipped research institutes, without any further involvement and/or benefit to local communities (helicopter research); similarly to the historical open access to tropical forests that has led to the disappropriation (\\"Global Pillage\\") of plant genetic resources from developing countries.Low, A., 2001. The Third Revolution: Plant Genetic Resources in Developing Countries and China: Global Village or Global Pillage. Int'l. Trade & Bus. L. Ann. 323 * The revenue earned by publishing data can be used to cover the costs of generating and/or disseminating the data, so that the dissemination can continue indefinitely. * The revenue earned by publishing data permits non-profit organisations to fund other activities (e.g. learned society publishing supports the society). * The government gives specific legitimacy for certain organisations to recover costs (NIST in US, Ordnance Survey in UK). * Privacy concerns may require that access to data is limited to specific users or to sub-sets of the data. * Collecting, 'cleaning', managing and disseminating data are typically labour- and/or cost-intensive processes ‚Äì whoever provides these services should receive fair remuneration for providing those services. * Sponsors do not get full value unless their data is used appropriately ‚Äì sometimes this requires quality management, dissemination and branding efforts that can best be achieved by charging fees to users. * Often, targeted end-users cannot use the data without additional processing (analysis, apps etc.) ‚Äì if anyone has access to the data, none may have an incentive to invest in the processing required to make data useful (typical examples include biological, medical, and environmental data). * There is no control to the secondary use (aggregation) of open data. Relation to other open activities The goals of the Open Data movement are similar to those of other \\"Open\\" movements. * Open access is concerned with making scholarly publications freely available on the internet. In some cases, these articles include open datasets as well. * Open content is concerned with making resources aimed at a human audience (such as prose, photos, or videos) freely available. * Open knowledge. Open Knowledge International argues for openness in a range of issues including, but not limited to, those of open data. It covers (a) scientific, historical, geographic or otherwise (b) Content such as music, films, books (c) Government and other administrative information. Open data is included within the scope of the Open Knowledge Definition, which is alluded to in Science Commons' Protocol for Implementing Open Access Data. * Open notebook science refers to the application of the Open Data concept to as much of the scientific process as possible, including failed experiments and raw experimental data.http://drexel-coas-elearning.blogspot.com/2006/09/open-notebook- science.html creation of term * Open-source software is concerned with the open-source licenses under which computer programs can be distributed and is not normally concerned primarily with data. * Open educational resources are freely accessible, openly licensed documents and media that are useful for teaching, learning, and assessing as well as for research purposes. * Open research/open science/open science data (linked open science) means an approach to open and interconnect scientific assets like data, methods and tools with linked data techniques to enable transparent, reproducible and transdisciplinary research. Funders' mandates Several funding bodies which mandate Open Access also mandate Open Data. A good expression of requirements (truncated in places) is given by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR):SPARC-OpenData@arl.org Mailing List Archive * to deposit bioinformatics, atomic and molecular coordinate data, experimental data into the appropriate public database immediately upon publication of research results. * to retain original data sets for a minimum of five years after the grant. This applies to all data, whether published or not. Other bodies active in promoting the deposition of data as well as full text include the Wellcome Trust. An academic paper published in 2013 advocated that Horizon 2020 (the science funding mechanism of the EU) should mandate that funded projects hand in their databases as \\"deliverables\\" at the end of the project, so that they can be checked for third party usability then shared.Galsworthy, M.J. & McKee, M. (2013). Europe's \\"Horizon 2020\\" science funding programme: How is it shaping up? Journal of Health Services Research and Policy. doi: 10.1177/1355819613476017 Non-open data Several mechanisms restrict access to or reuse of data (and several reasons for doing this are given above). They include: * making data available for a charge. * compilation in databases or websites to which only registered members or customers can have access. * use of a proprietary or closed technology or encryption which creates a barrier for access. * copyright forbidding (or obfuscating) re-use of the data, including the use of \\"no derivatives\\" requirements. * patent forbidding re-use of the data (for example the 3-dimensional coordinates of some experimental protein structures have been patented). * restriction of robots to websites, with preference to certain search engines. * aggregating factual data into \\"databases\\" which may be covered by \\"database rights\\" or \\"database directives\\" (e.g. Directive on the legal protection of databases). * time-limited access to resources such as e-journals (which on traditional print were available to the purchaser indefinitely). * \\"webstacles\\", or the provision of single data points as opposed to tabular queries or bulk downloads of data sets. * political, commercial or legal pressure on the activity of organisations providing Open Data (for example the American Chemical Society lobbied the US Congress to limit funding to the National Institutes of Health for its Open PubChem data).

Born in Mogadouro, he emigrated to Niassa Province, Portuguese Mozambique during the 1950s, where he established himself as a professional hunter. Roxo later fought in the Mozambican War of Independence against nationalist guerrillas. After Mozambican independence he served as a foreign volunteer in 32 Battalion, a Portuguese-speaking unit of the South African Army. Early life Daniel Roxo was born in Mogadouro, Tr√°s-os- Montes, on 1 February 1933. As a young man he immigrated to Niassa Province in 1951, where he settled as a professional hunter and safari guide. When the Mozambican War of Independence broke out in 1964 Roxo formed his African trackers, servants, and European acquaintances into a private militia, hunting FRELIMO combatants for government bounties. Disillusioned by Portugal's promise to hand Mozambique to Samora Machel's incoming government, Roxo supported an abortive coup d'√©tat by anti-FRELIMO forces in Louren√ßo Marques on September 7, 1974. He went into exile in South Africa the following November, joining the South African Defence Force. After completing Special Forces selection, Danny was seconded to Bravo Group (later 32 Battalion). South African military career =Operation Savannah= Roxo was awarded the Honoris Crux for bravery during Operation Savannah for an action during the Battle of Bridge 14 at , an engagement during which he single-handedly killed eleven enemy soldiers. Bridge 14 was situated on the Nhia River, en route from Cela to Quibala. South African mechanized contingents deploying to the south had routed a unit of the People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola (FAPLA) some time prior, and the retreating Angolans had demolished the existing structure. However, since Colonel Jan Breytenbach could not ascertain this from his forward positions, he ordered Roxo to conduct a more thorough reconnaissance. Roxo arrived at the river with four Eland-90 armoured cars; his patrol came under heavy mortar fire from an opposite bank and two of the vehicles withdrew, leaving Roxo's platoon to retire on foot. Having scouted the bridge alone and determined it was no longer intact, he inadvertently walked into an FAPLA ambush, but he managed to dispatch his attackers. Two escaped South African prisoners later claimed that aside from the Angolan casualties, four Cuban troops were reported killed in the encounter. =Death= During a patrol near the Okavango river, his personnel carrier struck a landmine and overturned, killing one man and crushing Roxo beneath it. The rest of the vehicle's crew tried to lift it free, but it was too heavy. Breytenbach wrote: :\\"Roxo, in keeping with his dauntless character, decided to make the best of things, lighting a cigarette and smoking it calmly until it was finished, then he died - still pinned beneath the Wolf. He had not complained once, nor uttered a single groan or moan, although the pain must have been excruciating.\\" See also * Battle of Bridge 14 * 32 Battalion (South Africa) References External links * *Battle of Bridge 14 *Danny Roxo stories and dedications Category:1933 births Category:1976 deaths Category:People from Mogadouro Category:Portuguese military personnel Category:South African Army personnel Category:Landmine victims Category:South African people of Portuguese descent Category:Recipients of the Cruz de Guerra Category:Portuguese emigrants to Mozambique Category:Mozambican emigrants to South Africa Category:South African military personnel of the Border War Category:South African military personnel killed in action Category:Portuguese emigrants to South Africa ","title":"Danny Roxo"},{"id":"7697781","text":"James Sprunt Community College is a community college in Kenansville, North Carolina.

A crime is punished with incarceration for a determined number of days, or with fines. As incarceration is a financial punishment, in the effect of preventing work, a day-fine represents one day incarcerated and without salary. It is argued to be just, because if both high-income and low-income population are punished with the same jail time, they should also be punished with a proportionally similar income loss. An analogy may be drawn with income tax, which is also proportional to the income, even progressively. Jurisdictions employing the day-fine include Denmark (), Estonia (), Finland (), France (), Germany (), Romania (), Sweden (), Switzerland, and Macao. By country =Denmark= Violations of the Danish Penal Code may be punishable by up to 60 day-fines, when the severity of a crime does not call for a custodial sentence. Fines issued under other laws (e.g. the traffic code) are not day-fines and do not ordinarily scale. Exceptions include fines for driving under the influence or without a valid license, which (although not technically day-fines) scale with income. Fines that do not scale may still be reduced by half (to a minimum of DKK 500) for offenders who are under 18 or whose gross annual income does not exceed DKK 171,795 (as of 2020). =Finland= Both police and the Finnish Border Guard can make a formal demand for fining a person or order a petty fine. In Finland, the day-fine system is used for most crimes that are punishable by way of a fine. The system has been in use since 1921.Law 130/1921 Most minor infractions are punished with a fixed petty fine (rikesakko, ordningsbot) such as minor traffic and water traffic violations, littering, and breaches of public peace.Criminal Code (Rikoslaki 39/1889) Chapter 2a, 9 ¬ß] Retrieved 9-27-2007 A petty fine is summarily ordered by the police officer if the suspect does not contest his guilt, but the person punished may contest the fine in a district court.Laki rikesakkomenettelyst√§, 6¬ß and 12 ¬ß. Retrieved 9-27-2007 Finnish prosecutors have considerable judicial power in deciding fines. Here, prosecutors are arriving at a court of law. Most infractions are punishable with a day-fine. For crimes warranting no more than six months in prison, the fine may be summarily ordered by the prosecutor if the suspect does not want the court to handle the case. The process of ordering a day fine is started by a police officer who makes a formal demand for the suspect to be fined. The suspect has one week to contest the demand. If the suspect does not contest the demand, the prosecutor may order a fine which may not be higher than demanded by the police officer. If the suspect contests the demand, the case may be taken to the district court if the prosecutor considers the suspect guilty. If the prosecutor considers the case to merit a term in prison or a higher fine, the case is always taken to the court.Laki rangaistusm√§√§r√§ysmenettelyst√§ (692/1992) Retrieved 9-27-2007 If the prosecution or the injured party do not demand a higher punishment than a fine, the district court has a quorum with a single member.Oikeudenk√§ymiskaari (4/1734), Chapter 2, 6 ¬ß.

A Finnish fine consists of a minimum of 1 day-fine, up to a maximum of 120 day-fines. If several crimes are punished together, 240 day- fines may be sentenced. The fines may not be sentenced together with a prison sentence, unless the prison sentence is probational. The minimum amount of a day-fine is 6 euros. Usually, the day-fine is one half of daily disposable income. The daily disposable income is considered to be one 60th part of the person's monthly mean income during the year, after taxes, social security payments and a basic living allowance of ‚Ç¨255 per month have been deducted. In addition, every person for whose upkeep the fined person is responsible decreases the amount of daily fine by ‚Ç¨3. The income of the person is calculated on the basis of the latest taxation data.Rikoslaki (39/1889), Chapter 2a. Retrieved 27-9-2007 Asetus p√§iv√§sakon raham√§√§r√§st√§, 2-3¬ß. Retrieved 27-9-2007.

The police can, however, access the taxation data of Finnish citizens and permanent residents via a real-time datalink, so the chance of lying successfully is minor. There is no maximum day-fine, which may lead to considerably high fines for high-income persons. For example, in 2001, a Finnish businessman with a yearly income of 10 million euros, received a relatively mild punishment of six day-fines, amounting ‚Ç¨26,000, for driving though a red traffic light.Nokian Ala-Pietil√§n 208000 markan sakot voivat viel√§ nousta Iltasanomat 11-9-2001.

Retrieved 6.3.2009. As speeding is punished with a petty fine if the offender is exceeding the speed limit by up to 20 km/h, but with a day-fine if exceeding the limit by 21 km/h or more, the monetary amount of the fine can increase from ‚Ç¨115 to over ‚Ç¨100,000 although the actual change in speed is less than 1 km/h. This has given rise to some criticism, most vividly expressed by a Finnish member of parliament, avid motorist Klaus Bremer and other MPs of right-wing parties.T√§ysistunnon p√∂yt√§kirja PTK 73/2000 vp (The minutes of the plenary session of Finnish parliament, PTK 73/2000 vp.)

Three day-fines will be converted to one day of imprisonment, ignoring the remainder for any amount of day-fines not divisible by three, and the length of the sentence must be between 4 and 60 days. This \\"conversion punishment\\" (, ) is only ever applied to court-ordered fines, not those issued by police. =India= Day fines are a concept to which little thought has been given in India. Undeniably, prisons are overcrowded and disproportionately represent religious minorities and socio-economically vulnerable castes and tribal groups. It is however unclear how much of this is due to fines. The IPC provides some safeguards on imposing fines such as monetary caps on fines for some offences and stringent limits for imprisonment for non-payment of fines. Where no upper monetary caps are specified, the IPC does not give courts discretion to impose fines which are ‚Äúunlimited‚Äù but not ‚Äúexcessive‚Äù. While specific fine amounts would require to be done away with in the text of the IPC, several underlying actions would need to be done before pressing day fines into service. =Macau= Article 45 of the Penal Code (, Portuguese: ) specifies that a criminal fine (, Portuguese: ) shall normally be at least 10 days and at most 360 days. One day-fine costs at least 50 Macanese patacas and at most 10,000 patacas.

She served in the Hellenic Royal Navy from 1912 to 1946.  Construction as ARA Santa Fe  Four sister ships, , Ierax, and , had originally been ordered as the San Luis class by Argentina from the English shipyard Cammell Laird in Birkenhead. The second was completed as Santa Fe. They were purchased in 1912 by Greece, ready for delivery, each for the sum of ¬£148,000, when the Balkan Wars seemed likely. Ierax was accepted by Captain Ath. Miaoulis, RHN in Palermo, Sicily where she arrived manned by a foreign crew. Service history During the Balkan Wars, the Royal Hellenic Navy purchased only the minimum amount of ammunition, 3,000 rounds of torpedoes. Torpedoes were not available for this class of ship, and for this reason these ships were initially named 'scouts' rather than 'destroyers'. On 21 October 1912, under the command of Commander A. Vratsanos, RHN, Ierax was part of the Greek flotilla that captured the island of Psara from the Ottomans. During World War I, Greece belatedly entered the war on the side of the Triple Entente and, due to Greece's neutrality the four Aetos-class ships were seized by the Allies in October 1916, taken over by the French in November, and served in the French Navy from 1917-18. By 1918, they were back on escort duty under Greek colors, mainly in the Aegean Sea. Ierax participated in the evacuation of Greeks from Russia during the Russian Civil War in 1918, and saw action in the Greco- Turkish War (1919-1922) in the Sea of Marmara and the Aegean Sea. After the war, Ierax was refurbished from 1925‚Äì1927. She also participated in the Second World War, after surviving the German invasion of April 1941, Ierax was based in Alexandria, Egypt. In April 1944, a wave of mutiny swept through some of the Hellenic Royal Navy, with seamen agitating in favor of the pro-Communist guerrillas, ELAS, who were fighting a campaign in Greece against the occupying Nazis. Ierax was one of the ships whose crew mutinied and the mutiny was put down in the early morning hours of 22 April 1944.Vice Admiral G.

These battles saw some of the most violent fighting of the whole war. During the nine campaigns launched, coordinated Soviet assaults would regularly drive out the Mujahideen from the valley but they would return as soon as the Soviets left. A strategic objective The Panjshir Valley lies 70 km north of Kabul, in the Hindu Kush mountains close to the Salang Pass, which connects Kabul to the northern areas of Afghanistan and further on to Uzbekistan, then part of the Soviet Union. In June 1979, an insurrection led by Ahmed Shah Massoud expelled all government forces, and the valley became a guerrilla stronghold. From the Panjshir, Mujahideen groups frequently carried out ambushes against Soviet convoys bringing supplies to the 40th Army stationed in Afghanistan. The Salang Pass became a dangerous area, and Soviet truck drivers were even awarded decorations for having successfully crossed it. The pressure on the logistic system determined the Soviet command to try and dislodge the rebels. Soviet Strategy Soviet offensives into the Panjshir Valley had three main tactical features. There was (1) the concentration of air assets, including extensive aerial bombardment of a target area followed by (2) the landing of helicopter forces to stop the withdrawal of enemy forces and engage the enemy from unexpected directions and (3) a drive by of mechanized forces into areas of guerrilla support in conjunction with the helicopter landing parties. It was these kinds of tactics that caused so much destruction in the civilian populations in these regions. By forcing the mass migration of civilians from the Panjshir Valley and destroying all crops and livestock, the Soviets hoped to deprive Ahmad Shah Massoud of resources to sustain his full-time fighters. Shortcomings of Soviet Strategy This tactic had some success as in order to rebuild his organization Massoud was forced to sign a cease fire treaty in January 1983 that would last for one year. The bottom line though was that these victories were temporary. There were serious issues with this tactic of large punitive offensives that contributed to the stalemate that characterized the war. Mujahideen forces would often learn of coming offensives in advance from their compatriots in the DRA army. Not only could civilians and guerrillas move safely out of the way of the majority of the bombs but guerrillas could also plan ambushes, lay mines, and move weapons caches. Once armored personnel carriers and helicopters came the guerrillas would retreat into the side valleys and carry out small ambushes rather than openly confront the Soviets. Timeline =Panjshir I ‚Äì III= The Panjshir valley. The first Soviet operation in Panjshir took place in April 1980, just four months after the arrival of Soviet forces in Afghanistan. It involved three Soviet battalions, of which one was the fourth battalion of the 56th Guards Air Assault Brigade led by Captain Leonid Khabarov, and 1000 men of the Afghan army and security forces. The overall commander of the operation was General Pechevoy. The Mujahideen numbered only 1,000 according to Soviet intelligence or no more than 200 according to Afghan sources. They were armed only with antiquated rifles and had not constructed any defensive works but laid mines on the only road. The advance proceeded up the valley, capturing Bazarak after a fight and overrunning Massoud's headquarters in Pasishah-Mardan where various documents were found. Khabarov was injured in the fighting, taking a bullet to the forearm. The rebels deliberately let the Soviet/DRA force into the valley and ambushed them as they withdrew. During the four-day operation, the Soviets claimed to have inflicted heavy casualties on the rebels but the Mujahideen newspaper \\"Call of Jihad\\" put their losses at four killed. The first operation had installed a garrison of Afghan troops in a fort in the town of Rokha, but they quickly came under siege by the Mujahideen and suffered constant losses from harassing fire. Beginning on August 28, a new offensive, dubbed Panjshir I, was carried out by Afghan and Soviet troops. It included for the first time a heliborne landing by air assault troops. As before the Mujahideen did not oppose the offensive frontally but harassed and ambushed the Soviets and DRA troops as they passed. The operation lasted 21 days. The Mujahideen admitted to 25 killed in their own ranks but claimed to have inflicted 500 casualties on their opponents and shot down several helicopters. Despite the operation, rebel pressure on Rokha including the use of captured artillery pieces did not let up. On November 8, a convoy of government trucks escorted by Soviet armoured vehicles reached the besieged post. Dismounted Soviet and DRA troops engaged the Mujahideen on the heights around the town in an effort to break the siege. One of Massoud's subcommanders was killed and the surrounding villages suffered heavily from indiscriminate bombing by Soviet aircraft, but the siege continued. The final operation of 1980 began on December 12. Heavy airstrikes hit the valley causing the death of 100 civilians and 15 Mujahideen. The fort at Rokha was finally evacuated on December 27, and the operation ended two days later, leaving the valley mostly under rebel control. =Panjshir IV ‚Äì September 6, 1981= By this time, Massoud had mustered enough men to openly resist the Soviet assault. During this offensive, to avoid losing vehicles to land mines, the Soviets sent their sapper units to clear the way in front of the main force. This tactic proved costly, and the attack force penetrated only 25 km into the valley before retiring, after having suffered 100 casualties. =Panjshir V ‚Äì May 16, 1982= Abandoned Soviet-era T-62 in the Panjshir valley. By 1982 Massoud had built up his forces to 3,000 men, and other Mujahideen from neighbouring areas could come to his aid The approaches to the valley were strengthened with defensive positions established on dominant heights and near narrow passages. Hollowed-out caves were used as supply depots and shelters. The first major offensive was carried out by a force of 12,000 Afghan and Soviet soldiers under the command of General Norat Ter- Grigoryants with 320 armoured vehicles, 155 artillery pieces, and supported by 104 helicopters and 26 airplanes. The Soviet units involved were the 108th Motor Rifle Division, 201st Motor Rifle Division, the 103rd Guards Airborne Division, who each contributed one regiment, the 66th Separate Motor Rifle Brigade, elements of the 860th Separate Motor-Rifle Regiment, the 191st Separate Motor-Rifle Regiment and the 345th Independent Guards Airborne Regiment. The plan for the operation was prepared in secret by a small number of 40th Army officers. In order to deceive the Mujahideen a diversionary attack up the Ghorband valley was planned. This was presented as the real attack to the Afghan Army staff, which included Mujahideen sympathizers, and who then leaked the plan to the resistance. The main assault began on the night of May 16, after an intense aviation and artillery bombardment. While motorized rifle battalions, preceded by reconnaissance units, attacked the dominating features at the entrance of the valley, airborne units were airlifted by helicopter behind the main Mujahideen defenses. In all, 4,200 troops were airlifted into the valley to capture strategic points, right up to the Pakistani border, in an effort to cut the Mujahideen supply lines. In some areas the fighting was intense: when a Soviet paratrooper regiment landed east of Rukha, it was quickly encircled and suffered significant losses. The beleaguered paratroopers were saved only by the arrival of a motorised rifle battalion led by Major Aushev, who forced his way through the Mujahideen defenses, consisting of well-located strong points, and captured Rukha. For his actions, Aushev was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. Massoud, who expected an attack similar to the previous ones, had disposed his defenses close to the entrance of the valley, and was thus unable to prevent the Soviets from gaining footholds in the Panjshir. They established three main bases at Rukha, Bazarak and Anava. Most of the Mujahideen had survived the attack and Massoud divided them into small, mobile groups that fought the Soviets all down the valley. During this offensive, the Soviets managed to occupy a large part of the Panjshir and scored some successes against Massoud's organization, such as the capture of a list of the names of 600 of his agents in Kabul. However, most of the rebels had escaped capture, and this was not the decisive victory the Soviets had been hoping for. Also, their heavily fortified bases only gave them control over the valley floor, while the surrounding heights were still held by the Mujahideen. For this reason they decided to launch a sixth offensive. =Panjshir VI ‚Äì August ‚Äì September, 1982= The sixth offensive consisted of a series of sweeps conducted by motorized units and by airborne Spetsnaz units, launched from their bases in the Panjshir, to find and destroy the Mujahideen hideouts. It was accompanied by a heavy aerial bombardment of villages suspected of harbouring rebel groups, notably carried out by Tu-16 bombers flying from inside the Soviet Union. Airborne Troops carried out search and destroy missions, encircling Massoud's mobile units and destroying some of them. However, as a rule attrition among the Mujahideen was low, and the brunt of the attacks fell on the civilian population, who suffered heavily, many of them preferring to flee the valley. Despite bitter fighting, the Soviets were unable to eradicate the Mujahideen, and the battle soon developed into a stalemate. During the 5th and 6th offensives the Soviets suffered up to 3,000 casualties, and 1,000 Afghan Army soldiers defected to the Mujahideen. Once the height of the offensive had passed, many areas captured by the Soviet forces were handed over to Afghan army units, who suffered from low morale and high desertion rates. They were the targets for Massoud's counterattacks. In a series of surprise attacks, several government outposts fell to the rebels. The first was the Afghan Army outpost at Saricha, which the Mujahideen captured along with 80 prisoners and 8 tanks, despite having to cross a minefield. The government post at Birjaman fell soon after, and the Mujahideen were able to recapture some areas in this way. These operations, along with the continued harassment of Soviet garrisons and resupply convoys, proved that the Mujahideen were far from defeated, and convinced the Soviets that they must negotiate a truce with Massoud. In January 1983, for the first time a ceasefire was concluded between the Soviets and the Mujahideen, lasting 6 months, and later extended. Negotiated by Massoud in person with a colonel of the GRU, Anatoly Tkachev, the agreement stipulated that Soviet troops should evacuate the Panjshir, except for a small garrison at Anava, whose access was controlled by the Mujahideen. The area covered by the ceasefire included the Panjshir valley, but not the Salang pass, where fighting continued. Massoud took advantage of the truce to extend his influence over areas that had until then been held by hostile factions loyal to Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-islami party, like in Andarab District. More peacefully, he took control of the Khost-Fereng sector, and some areas in southern Takhar Province, while establishing contacts with other guerrilla groups in Baghlan Province, and persuading them to adopt his military organisation. He also ordered the strengthening of defenses in five subsidiary valleys as well as in the Panjshir, permitting a defense in depth, and withdrew his headquarters to Shira Mandara, in Takhar province, in anticipation of a renewed assault. =Panjshir VII ‚Äì April 19 to September 1984= In February 1984, Konstantin Chernenko replaced Yuri Andropov as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. While Andropov had supported the ceasefire, Chernenko, a disciple of Brezhnev, believed that the guerrillas should be rooted out through military action, an opinion which he shared with Babrak Karmal, president of the DRA. As a result a new offensive was planned, which, in Karmal's words, should be decisive and merciless, and in order to destroy the Panjshir valley bases, all those living there should be killed. It was the largest offensive in the region to date. However, some Soviets, who were supporters of Andropov, disagreed with this policy, and they gave Massoud advance warning of the attack. Through this channel, and thanks to his agents in the DRA government, Massoud had a precise idea of the Soviet plans, and he was able to counter them. To avoid civilian casualties, all 30,000 inhabitants of the Panjshir (from a population of 100,000 before the war) were evacuated to safe areas. Only ambush parties were left to delay the Soviet advance. All the roads, villages and helicopter landing zones were heavily mined. All these preparations were carried out in secret, and a token activity was maintained near the Soviet base at Anava, to deceive the Soviets into believing that a conventional defense was being prepared. 11,000 Soviet and 2,600 Afghan soldiers, under Marshal of the Soviet Union Sergei Sokolov participated in the offensive, supported by 200 airplanes and 190 helicopters. On April 22, after a two-day bombardment of the region by Tu-16, Tu-22M and Su-24 bombers, they advanced rapidly into the Panjshir. Several battalion strength forces were placed at key passes leading out of the Panjshir Valley while at the same time large helicopter troop landings were made in tributary valleys connected to the Panjshir. By blocking the Mujahideen's withdrawal routes and securing the high ground, the Soviets forced them higher into the mountains then they had previously ventured and scattered their strength as they attempted to avoid being trapped by the helicopter landings. Once the strength of Massoud's forces were dealt such a deadly blow, rather than withdrawing from the valley as they had previously done they began setting up a system of forts and posts throughout the main valley while relinquishing control of the side valleys. These tactics proved more effective at rooting out insurgents and breaking up their fighting forces during the offensive but had limited long term success. The forts and outposts along the Panjshir Valley were unable to protect roads and convoys as well as they had hoped and these installations proved attractive targets for the Mujahideen to harass. Much of the valley was occupied, but the Soviets paid a heavy price; many soldiers were killed by mines and in ambushes. During one battle, on April 30 in the Hazara Valley, the 1st Battalion of the 682nd Motor Rifle Regiment was decimated: the losses of Soviet troops were estimated at 60 killed. For the Soviets, the operation was partly successful ‚Äì some of the infrastructure of the Mujahideen, created in the time of the truce in 1982‚Äì1983, was destroyed. Babrak Karmal completed a propaganda visit to the Panjshir, which for some time had become a safe zone. However, it quickly became apparent that most of Massoud's forces had escaped the onslaught, and were still able to carry out their harassment tactics. Eventually, in September, the Soviet-DRA forces once again evacuated the Panjshir Valley, leaving occupying forces only in the lower Panjshir. Yousaf and Adkin reported in 1992 that the Soviet forces involved included the 180th Motor Rifle Regiment, battalions of the 66th Motor Rifle Brigade and 191st Motor Rifle Regiment, a regiment of the 103rd Guards Airborne Division, a battalion of the 345th Independent Guards Airborne Regiment, accompanied by Afghan forces including the 8th Division, the 20th Division, and the 37th Commando Brigade. It seems likely that the reference to the '180th Motor Rifle Regiment' refers to the 682nd Motor Rifle Regiment of the 108th Motor Rifle Division, based in Kabul. =Panjshir VIII ‚Äì September 1984= The 8th offensive was a follow-up to the 7th, involving mostly airborne forces. =Panjshir IX ‚Äì 16 June 1985= The 9th offensive was carried out in reprisal for the destruction of the DRA garrison at Peshgur, during which Massoud's mobile groups took 500 prisoners including 126 officers and killed a brigadier of the Afghan Army. The prisoners had been marched into the mountains, where the Mujahideen claimed they were killed by a Soviet aerial bombardment, a claim others dubbed suspicious. Initiated hours after the raid, the Soviet counter-attack installed a new garrison in Peshgur, and pursued the retreating Mujahideen. The group escorting the captured Afghan officers was caught in the open by Soviet helicopters, and in the ensuing fight most of the prisoners were killed, with both sides projecting on each other the responsibility for the incident. Aftermath In 1986, Mikhail Gorbachev announced his intention of withdrawing the Soviet contingent from Afghanistan. From then on the Soviets were mostly concerned with avoiding losses in the Panjshir sector, and they observed a tacit ceasefire: unprovoked shooting by Soviet troops was forbidden, and the Mujahideen refrained from attacking Soviet bases. Despite provocations ordered by Najibullah's government to draw the Soviets into further fighting, the situation generally remained calm, enabling Massoud to carry out his \\"strategic offensive\\", capturing much of Baghlan and Takhar provinces. The last Soviet and Afghan troops present in the lower Panjshir were finally evacuated in June 1988.

Each episode was about 20 minutes long. During the opening credits of \\"Through the Dragon's Eye\\" a book with the same title opened at a specific \\"Chapter\\" (for example, Chapter 1: The Dragon from Pelamar). Chapter 1: The Dragon from Pelamar Three children (Jenny, Scott and Amanda) pass through a mural they have been painting and find themselves in the magical land of Pelamar. There, Gorwen the dragon tells them that the \\"life source\\" of Pelamar, the Veetacore has exploded. He then asks for their help to re-build it. They then travel to the Veetacore House and meet the Veetacore Keepers, Boris, Morris and Doris. The episode ends with Amanda finding out that three Veetons are missing. The Dragon From Pelamar was aired in the UK on 19 September 1989. Chapter 2: Flight to Widge Gorwen the Dragon believes that the missing Veetons must have fallen beyond the mountains of Pelamar into the strange land of Widge. Amanda, Scott, Boris, Rodey and Gorwen set off to find the lost Veetons and the quest begins. Jenny stays behind with the other two Veetacore Keepers, Doris and Morris to help them read a book on how to put the Veetacore back together again. Boris and Amanda crash land into a \\"high fade zone\\" of Widge and have to leave quickly because Rodey (a giant talking mouse) shrinks. When the air gets too thin for Boris and Gorwen to fly through the search party land at Border Camp in Widge. The Widgets (the native inhabitants of Widge ‚Äì small squirrel-like animals) let them stay for the night. In the morning, they help Scott and Rodey as to which road they should take (Rodey could speak \\"Widgen\\" ‚Äì the language of Widge). Chapter 3: The First Veeton With the Widgets as their guides, the search party set off through the Woods of Widge. Jenny tries to contact Gorwen on a videophone to ask whether Boris took a \\"veetarod\\" with him (a long, thin instrument the Keepers use to locate Veetons with). Scott starts to suspect that the Widgets are not all that they seem, when Boris falls into a quagmire, which could have been avoided if Boris could have read the sign saying \\"Danger! Quagmire!\\". Rodey the mouse goes off in a huff, and the others leave him to catch up with them. The veetarod (which Boris had taken with him) works and leads the party to a huge tree (unfortunately the door into the tree is locked). Chapter 4: Word Magic The Widgets have hidden the first Veeton inside a huge book tree. Boris and Amanda manage to unlock it and enter it in search of the Veeton, while Scott and the dragon Gorwen search for Rodey, who is still missing. Boris and Amanda follow some signs to the library. Inside Boris solves a clue, and finds the first Veeton. The kindly Book Tree lets Boris take some books with him for when he can read. They find the way out and try contacting Doris with the news, however Doris never replies. The credits roll up on Doris with a huge look of shock and absolute terror on her face. Word Magic was aired on 10 October 1989 Chapter 5: Clues in the Snow With the help of the veetarod, Scott and Gorwen find Boris, Amanda and the first Veeton in a gravel pit (the exit of the Book Tree). Then it starts to snow. Scott finds a \\"snowflake clue\\", which tells them to go to Ash Rock. They set out through the snow, however almost as soon as they set off, the Widgets corner them and engage them in a snowball fight. After the fight, which everyone enjoys, Scott, Boris and Gorwen find that the Widgets have taken the Veeton and Boris' rucksack, and that they have kidnapped Amanda. Gorwen sets off to find them, while Boris and Scott continue to Ash Rock. Meanwhile, at the Veetacore House, we find out why Doris is not replying to Boris' message. Charn, the Evil One, an exiled Pelamot, has returned to try to take over Pelamar. Boris can only see the back of Doris' head in his videophone, and therefore thinks Doris is simply being rude when she cuts him off. At the Veetacore House, Charn reveals his plan. When the Veetacore is mended, he will chant a spell, which must be chanted as the last Veeton is fitted, with malevolent words rather than the kind and hopeful ones at the back of the book. Jenny at first stands up to Charn, refusing to mend the Veetacore for his purposes, but he scares her into obedience by melting Frug, Morris' pet caterpillar, with his magic hands; if he points at something and keeps his hand on it, a jet of green light shoots out of his hand and melts the object he is pointing at. He threatens to melt Morris as well, but Jenny decides it would be safer to help him after all. Doris tries to contact Boris as discreetly as possible, but Charn sees her at the last minute, and melts her.Clues in the Snow was aired on 24 October 1989 Chapter 6: Jenny's Scarf Amanda chases the Widget who stole Boris' rucksack (with the Veeton in it). She rescues it and in doing so, finds Rodey, but they find themselves lost in the snow. Boris and Scott find another clue at Ash Rock. They leave a sign for Amanda and Gorwen to follow. The veetarod then leads them up to the top of a mountain. When they are about halfway up, some rocks hit Boris on the head. One of the rocks is not a rock at all, it is a Veeton. Gorwen catches up with Amanda and Rodey and they continue up to the top of the mountain, where they treat Boris' head and contact Jenny again. At the Veetacore House, Jenny persuades Charn to let Morris knit her a scarf. She continues to read the book for Charn, who cannot read, and re-builds the Veetacore. When the search party contact Jenny, she holds up Morris' scarf. On the scarf are the words \\"HELP! CHARN!\\" Gorwen decides to return to Pelamar alone, with the two Veetons. He leaves Rodey, Amanda, Boris and Scott to find the last Veeton by themselves. Jenny's Scarf was aired on 31 October 1989 Chapter 7: The Waterfall of Words > \\"No-one can face Charn and live. Only Gorwen has a chance... \\" During the night, the search party pitch a tent and spend the night at the top of the mountains. During the night, two troublesome Widgets sneak into the tent and steal Boris' map of Widge. They rip the map up, leaving Boris, Amanda, Scott and Rodey alone with no \\"map, no time and no words to help\\" them. Suddenly, a waterfall of words appears gushing down the mountainside, giving them a clue as what to do next. Meanwhile, Gorwen makes his way back through Widge by night. He appears outside the Veetacore House, where he is seen by Jenny and Charn. Morris goes out the back door of the house to try and tell Gorwen. The Waterfalls of Words was aired on 7 November 1989 Chapter 8: The Great Battle Gorwen returns to the Veetacore House, where Charn is waiting for him. Morris tries to warn him, but is zapped by Charn. There is a great battle and Charn is eventually beaten forever; Charn had already been beaten once by Gorwen and as a result was banished from Pelamar. After the battle, Gorwen knows he still has time to save Morris, Doris, Frug and the rest of Morris' pets that Charn had melted, even though he, himself is becoming weaker and weaker. Doris then sends a message to Scott, Rodey, Amanda and Boris: Charn beaten but Gorwen fading. Hurry! Then Rodey finds a tunnel through the mountains. The Great Battle was aired on 14 November 1989 Chapter 9: Danger on High Rodey rescues the veetarod, which had fallen down a deep chasm in the tunnel. The veetarod leads them up to the top of the mountain. Then Boris realises that the Widgets had taken his bat. Amanda persuades Boris to swap some of the books that the Book Tree had given him for the bat. The Widgets agree. At the Veetacore House, the Veetacore is still unfinished. Frug meanwhile has become a very large cocoon and Gorwen has faded so much he is almost invisible. Jenny tries contacting Boris to tell him to hurry up. Scott and Amanda spot the last Veeton balanced on a tree that has fallen over, wedged between two cliffs. Danger on High was aired on 21 November 1989 Chapter 10: The Final Page Scott, with the help of the Widgets, manages to rescue the last Veeton. Boris, Amanda and Scott then start the long trek down to the bottom of the mountain after thanking and waving to the Widgets who make a banner for them out of a picnic cloth, which says \\"Goodbye! Good Luck!\\"'. Meanwhile, Doris and Morris fit the penultimate piece of the Veetacore and wait for the others to return with the last Veeton. Boris, Amanda and Scott continue through the Woods of Widge until they reach Border Camp. Boris pulls out his magical flying bat and flies home to Pelamar with Scott and Amanda clasping onto the bat with him. At the Veetacore House, Doris, Morris and Jenny gather round a cracked wall and measure the distance. They are convinced that it is getting bigger. A short while later, after Boris is shown encouraging his bat to go faster, Jenny measures the crack again, while Doris and Morris are asleep with Frug. Gorwen has almost vanished now; he is so pale. The search party crash-land in Pelamar, miles away from the Veetacore House. To get to the house, Boris makes his cricket bat into a skateboard. They burst into the Veetacore House, on top of Doris, who had just declared that she did not believe that they were coming. They take out the Veeton and look for which way up it is supposed to go. Jenny looks in the book, which tells the Keepers how to fix the Veetacore, however she finds that Frug had eaten the last page. Just then Frug erupts from his cocoon, revealing the last four words of the missing sentence in the book on each of his four wings. The Veetacore Keepers and the children work out what the sentence is and the last Veeton is placed, by Morris, Doris and Boris, into the Veetacore, while chanting the spell. The Veetacore glows and hums causing Gorwen to come back, Rodey to return to his normal size and the rest of Pelamar to fill with life again. With their mission complete, the children return to their own world - only a short time after they left it. They all find a miniature veeton in their pockets as a gift from Pelamar - proving their adventure really did happen.

Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ50 is a superzoom bridge digital camera by Panasonic. The camera is known for its high-quality optics and effective optical image stabilization system.  Features  Many professional reviews commended it for its excellent pictures at ISO 100. However, it has a reputation for excessively \\"smeary\\" noise reduction at higher ISO settings, which can be ameliorated by using the RAW capture mode. It uses proprietary lithium-ion batteries. No storage is built into the camera; an MMC, SD, or SDHC memory card is required. High-speed SD cards up to 2 GB and SDHC cards up to 32GB are supported. The camera has many SLR-like handling features ‚Äî dual control wheels for aperture and shutter speed, manual focus (focus-by-wire), zoom rings and a flash hot shoe. It is among the largest non-SLR cameras, and is positioned at the high end of the bridge-camera market. Zooming while recording movies is supported since the zoom is manual. The camera also includes an \\"extended optical zoom\\" system providing greater optical zoom ability when shooting at lower resolutions, giving up to 19.3√ó zoom at 3MP. While Panasonic's camera models with motorized zoom generally implement extended zoom at the end of the optical zoom range as a transition from using the full sensor to just a central crop, the FZ50 does this transition in parallel with the optical zoom, making the mechanically linked zoom appear more sensitive. Compared to cropping in postprocessing, this can be useful for metering and framing. Apertures from 2.8 to 11 are supported, though the largest apertures are not available at high zoom levels (3.7 at full zoom). Shutter speeds range from 60 s to 1/2000 s, although shutter speeds faster than 1/1000 s are not available at the widest apertures. Multiple auto-focus (AF) modes are available. The AF- macro setting is available for all camera modes. Macro photography is not outstanding (5 cm minimum focal range at 1√ó zoom), and the tele-macro capability on the lower-end Panasonic FZ models (the ability to focus down to 1 m at 420 mm) is not present; the FZ50 can only focus down to 2 m at 420 mm. However, the FZ50 is commonly used to record high-magnification macro images with an inexpensive conversion lens; the most commonly used lens for this purpose is the 8-diopter Raynox 250. The FZ50 has a screw mount to accept 55 mm filters, and is compatible with a wide variety of Panasonic-branded and third-party lens converters that can provide greater wide-angle, telephoto and close-up capabilities. The FZ50 can record in a RAW format that is supported by Adobe Camera Raw and the free UFRaw plugin for GIMP and many other third- party programs; the camera comes with a special version of Silkypix for conversion. RAW files are recorded in around three seconds with fast SD cards, which is one of the best results among non-digital single-lens reflex cameras; however, there is no RAW buffer as on many digital SLR's. Unlike its predecessors, the FZ50 does not support TIFF format. The zoom and focus mechanism is internal: the lens does not physically extend beyond the camera housing when focusing and zooming. Startup is under one second, as the lens does not need to be extended.  History  The predecessor Lumix DMC-FZ30 was a major upgrade of the FZ20 both internally and externally. The FZ50 differs relatively little from the FZ30. The main differences are: * Higher resolution 10.1-megapixel CCD * Venus Engine III processor (with its characteristic unusual noise reduction algorithm) * 2.0-inch flip-out 207k high resolution LCD (FZ30 has 235k) * TTL Flash hot-shoe  See also  * Panasonic Lumix DMC- FZ30  External links  *Product info from Panasonic. *Review at Digital Camera Resource Page (refer to for greater detail regarding model differences.)

He was the younger son, and youngest child, of Shane Leslie (a first cousin of Sir Winston Churchill), and his wife Marjorie (n√©e Ide). He invented the multi- track mixing desk. Biography During his lifetime he served as a Spitfire pilot in the RAF during World War II, became one of the first pioneers of electronic music, and co-wrote one of the first books on UFOs, Flying Saucers Have Landed (1953),Flying Saucers Have Landed (1957 edition) with writer and UFO contactee George Adamski. Leslie is probably most famous for punching theatre critic Bernard Levin in front of eleven million viewers during an edition of the live satirical TV show That Was The Week That Was in 1962.Levin's obit., The GuardianBBCi Ostensibly this was to protect the honour of his then-wife, Agnes Bernelle, in response to Levin's critical review of her show, Savagery and Delight. Bernelle stated in her biography, The Fun Palace, that the show was poorly received due to Leslie's custom-built loudspeakers being moved below the stage, and that he had failed to check the situation, missing the show for a social appointment. As a consequence no one behind the front two rows heard a word she sang. She claimed he probably punched Levin more out of embarrassment than loyalty. Levin's obituaries described Leslie only as an expert on UFOs.

He also wrote a series of satirical books ranging from The Jesus File, dealing with the crucifixion of Christ as recorded through the paper-work and internal correspondences of the Roman Garrison, to How Britain Won The Space Race, which he co-wrote with celebrated amateur astronomer Patrick Moore. Screenwriting/directing career Desmond Leslie was briefly a screenwriter/director for film and television. * My Hands Are Clay (1947) * Stranger At My Door (1950) * Stranger from Venus (1954) * Them And The Thing (1960) During financial difficulties during the production of Stranger At My Door, Leslie opted to compose the music for the film himself. Some stated the music was the best part of the film. In the early 1950s he designed the world's first effective multi-track sound mixing desk which he had built by Rupert Neve. It can still be seen in his family home Castle Leslie, Monaghan, where it has been an object of reverence for visitors such as Mick Jagger and Paul McCartney. Electronic music career During the late 1950s, he began nurturing his interest in contemporary music. In his small home studio, he experimented with the sounds of musique concr√®te. In January 1960, Leslie pressed a single acetate called Music of the Future. All Leslie recordings were later licensed to Joseph Weinburger, and Leslie's recordings were pressed onto a short series of 78rpm library discs, occasionally being put to use in science and mystery based programing, such as early Doctor Who episodes. He used a great number of tape sources to create his pieces; some sources he mentions in his liner notes are motor horns, humming tops and bells.Leslie, Desmond: Music Of The Future. Audio CD, Trunk Records (2005). Liner notes by Desmond Leslie and Jonny Trunk. In 2005, Jonny Trunk's British record label, Trunk Records, re-released Desmond's 1960 acetate, never before released commercially. The sounds on this release were mastered from the original acetate. The recordings are believed to have been made between 1955 and 1959, and included are Desmond's original sleevenotes, containing information pertaining to each selection. Marriages and children His first wife was Agnes Elizabeth Bernauer (Agnes Bernelle) on 18 August 1945. That marriage ended in divorce. The couple had two sons and one daughter: * Sir Shaun Rudolf Christopher Leslie, 5th Bt (b. 4 June 1947), married Charlotte Bing; no offspring. He inherited the Leslie Baronetcy, of Glaslough, County Monaghan, that his uncle, John Leslie, held until his death in 2016. * Christopher Mark Leslie (b. 7 December 1952), married Cliona Manahan and had two children, Leah Leslie and Luke Leslie. * Antonia Kelvey Oriel Leslie (b. 1963), married Colm Nolan, and raised one daughter, Lola Leslie. He remarried, to Jennifer Helen Strong, in 1970; they had two daughters: * Samantha Helen Leslie (b. 1966) * Camilla Patricia Leslie (b. 29 March 1969) Last years and death During the 1990s he devoted his time to restoring the aging family home of Castle Leslie which eventually opened to the public. He later relocated to Nice, France. Emphysema claimed his life in Antibes in 2001, aged 79.

In 2010, Israel became the chair of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme. , cut diamonds constituted 23.2% of Israel's total exports and they were the country's biggest export product, amounting to 12% of the world's production. History =Pre-state beginnings= What was to become the Israeli diamond industry began in 1937, eleven years before the State of Israel was established, when the first diamond polishing plant was opened in Petah Tikva by refugee experts from the Netherlands.The Early 1900s by Shira Ami In 1938 the 15% import duty on imported rough stones was removed. By 1944 the industry employed 3,300 workers in 33 factories, with ¬£P 1,320,000 capital investment, entirely Jewish. The value of exports was over ¬£P 3,200,000 mainly to the United States, Canada, and India; it was the largest value of any single commodity exported from Mandatory Palestine that year.'A survey of Palestine'. Vol 1. Originally published 1946-47. . Page 445. Diamond polishing factory, Netanya,1945 Between 1944 and 1948 the industry suffered from the increasing lawlessness and in February 1948 closed down completely.The Scotsman, March 8th 1948: 'Clare Hollingworth, Jerusalem, by Air Mail : One of the biggest casualties of the Palestine civil war occurred last month in a veil of obscurity. The entire Jewish-owned diamond polishing industry of Palestine, which had grown during the war to be the second largest in the world after that of Holland, was closed down. It is considered unlikely that the industry, which in 1946 exported ¬£5,501,000 worth of cut diamonds, mostly to the United States, will reopen again on anything like its former scale. Four official reasons are given for ‚Äòsuspending work‚Äô. The first is that 2500 workers in 34 diamond-cutting plants walked out as a result of ‚Äòhold-ups by dissident underground organisations.‚Äô Secondly, Mr O. Ben-Ami, president of the Diamond Manufacturing Association, states that ¬£200,000 of diamonds have been stolen since 1944. The third reason is that insurance companies, after raising diamond insurance rates for Palestine to 12 per cent. recently declined cover altogether. Fourthly, the Palestine Post Office no longer accepts registered mail. The fate of the diamond industry illustrates the twin dangers which threaten the whole of the new industrial system which the Zionists have built up rapidly in Palestine in recent years, and on which many Zionist economists based their hopes for the livelihood of a future Jewish state. The dangers are the dislocation caused by the guerrilla struggle waged by Jewish extremists, which has now developed into an economically paralysing civil war, and the post-war revival of international trade at competitive prices, which has revealed the shaky basis of wartime expansion of Zionist industry.' =First years of the State of Israel= After a state was declared, the consumer economy was shifted to a war economy. This came at the height of a diamond crisis, as many war-torn economies were struggling to re-establish. During the first fifteen years of Israel's existence, diamonds and Jaffa oranges were the new state's main export products.Meirav Arlosoroff, When Ben-Gurion Saved Israel‚Äôs Economy at Any Price, Haaretz, 23 March 2018 After reaching its lowest point in the wake of the 1948 closedown, the industry has continued to grow, producing a world leader in the diamond industry. Current state In the beginning of the 21st century, Israel is one of the world's three major centers for polished diamonds, alongside Belgium and India. Israel's net polished diamond exports slid 22.8% in 2012 as polished diamond exports fell to $5.56 billion from $7.2 billion in 2011. Net exports of rough diamonds dropped 20.1% to $2.8 billion and net exports of polished diamonds slipped 24.9 percent to $4.3 billion, while net rough diamond imports dropped 12.9 percent to $3.8 billion. The United States is the largest market accounting for 36% of overall export market for polished diamonds while Hong Kong remains at second with 28 percent and Belgium at 8% coming in third.Jewellery Business - Israel‚Äôs 2012 polished diamond exports declineIsrael 2012 diamond exports fall, may rebound if no more crises  Reuters\\\\- Israel's Polished Diamond Exports -22% in 2012 In 2007, when diamonds still constituted almost 24% of Israel's total exports,Minerals Yearbook, 2008, V. 3, Area Reports, International, Africa and the Middle East - page 48.1 The mineral Industry of Israel: \\"Israel's total exports amounted to $45.9 billion in 2007, of which diamonds accounted for 23.9%\\" 12% of world diamonds (by their value) were polished in the country.Minerals Yearbook, 2008, V. 3, Area Reports, International, Africa and the Middle East // USGS - page 48.1 The mineral Industry of Israel: \\"In 2007 ..

Israel's government funds a non-profit industry body, the Israel Diamond Institute, to represent organisations and institutions involved in Israel's diamond industry. Industry principles The Israeli diamond industry guarantees all diamonds are 100% naturally made and participates in the Kimberley Process, a certification scheme whose goal is to ensure no blood diamonds enter the marketplace. Some human rights campaigners, however, say the Kimberley Process defines conflict diamonds too narrowly, only relating to uncut stones, enabling Israel's diamond-cutting industry to avoid attention.HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGNERS SAY KIMBERLEY PROCESS MUST SUSPEND ISRAEL AND BAN ISRAELI DIAMONDS EXPORTS The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign, among others, has called for diamonds processed in Israel to be considered conflict diamonds.Israel's blood diamonds (BDS, March 31, 2010)SOUTH AFRICA: Avocados, Diamonds at Core of Anti-Israel Trade Campaign (IPS, Jan 26 2007)South African Officials Must Reject Israeli Blood Diamonds and Secure Jobs in Diamond Beneficiation (IPSC, June 3, 2013) See also *Economy of Israel *Moshe Schnitzer, key player in the international diamond trade, from 1967-1993 President of the Israel Diamond Exchange References Category:Economy of Israel ","title":"Diamond industry in Israel"},{"id":"7698269","text":"Marion Junior/Senior High School is a high school in Marion, Wisconsin that serves students in grades 7 through 12. It has an enrollment of approximately 200 students. The school colors are blue and gold and the mascot is a Mustang. Marion School District The school district comprises territory along the boundary of Shawano and Waupaca counties, and includes the communities of Caroline, Leopolis, and the Town of Pella. At one time, Caroline had its own elementary school, however, because of small enrollment it was sold to the local American Legion group. Students from Caroline have attended Marion's elementary school since the early 1980s. Although Marion has had several high school and elementary buildings in its history, the main building has usually been on School Street in downtown Marion. The elementary school and the high school were at one time in the same building. A fire in 1985 caused high school classes to be moved to the elementary school, while elementary classes were moved to various locations around Marion, such as churches, while a new high school, connected to the old gymnasium, was built on School Street. The separate elementary building for K-6 is located five blocks north of the junior-senior high school, just off Main Street. A field house was added to the elementary school in 1998, where many events are now held. Extracurricular activities Marion High School has extracurricular programs, such as music, FFA, FCCLA, forensics, and other academic groups. Every year, students represent the school at state and national levels in FFA, as well as at state competitions in music and forensics. =Athletics= Marion High School participates in the Central Wisconsin Conference - small division, or CWC-Small, in the following sports: cross country, football, volleyball, basketball, baseball, softball, golf, and track and field. Local churches and groups also sponsor summer baseball and softball teams and tournaments. Wrestling Although Marion High School discontinued its wrestling program because of declining participation, the school had its first state champion in 1997. In February 2015, Marion approved a wrestling co-op with the neighboring city o Clintonville. Track and field A Marion High School pole vaulter took first at the state meet in 1995.http://www.wisconsintrackandfield.com/listsrecords/boystopPV.html Wisconsin High School Track and Field records Cross country The cross country program was discontinued for many years because of declining involvement, however, it experienced a resurgence in the late 1990s. This was followed by the boys' team finishing seventh at the state meet in 1997. Softball The softball team won the WIAA State Class C tournament in 1985, 1986, 1988, 1990, 1991, and 1992. Baseball The baseball team captured its first WIAA State Championship in 2009. Ken Frailing of the Chicago White Sox and Chicago Cubs is a Marion High School graduate. Golf With the building of Marion's first community golf course, Perry's Landing, a golf team was started. The golf season is in the spring and allows boys and girls to play. Basketball The girls' basketball team lost to Iola in the regional playoffs in 2000. It won the CWC-10 Conference championship in 2014. The boys' basketball team, in both the 2010-11 and 2011-12 seasons, lost in the sectional finals, capping 21-win seasons. The 2011-12 team's sectional loss was to Sam Dekker and the Sheboygan Lutheran Crusaders. Sam went on to star for the Wisconsin Badgers and the Houston Rockets. The boys' basketball team also won the Wisconsin State Championship in the 1950s, coached by Leslie C. Ansorge. On that team was Ned Wulk, who would eventually become the all-time leader in career wins as head basketball coach at Arizona State University. Dick Bennett, former basketball coach at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìGreen Bay, University of Wisconsin‚ÄìStevens Point, University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, and Washington State University, began his basketball coaching career at Marion High School. Football Marion had no varsity football victories from the 1999 season finale until 2004. Marion won two games that year. Beginning in the 2009 season, the football team combined with Tigerton High School. The co-op team is known as the Marion- Tigerton Thundercatz. The co-op was created because of declining participation for both schools.

He was chosen as one of the Dalai Lama's debate examiners during the annual Prayer Festival in 1959. Geshe Sopa went in exile in India following the 1959 Tibetan uprising. In 1962, he was awarded the degree of Lharampa Geshe. At the request of Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama, he moved to the USA with three other monks (Sharpa Tulku, Khamlung Tulku and Lama Kunga) that same year to learn English and to study American culture. In 1967, Sopa was invited by Richard Robinson to join the faculty of the pioneer Buddhist Studies Program at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. Sopa was the first Tibetan to be tenured at an American university. Holding various positions through the years, when he retired in 1997, he became Emeritus Professor in the Department of South Asian Studies. During that time, Sopa trained many of the first generation of respected Buddhist scholars and translators in the USA, including Jeffrey Hopkins, Jos√© Cabez√≥n, John Makransky, Edward W.

Brennan Catholic High School was originally named Corpus Christi High School (meaning \\"the Body of Christ\\") and was founded in 1953. It was the first Catholic co-educational secondary school in Windsor. In 1965, Corpus Christi High School was expanded and renamed F.J. Brennan Catholic High School in honour of Monsignor Francis J. Brennan, a Windsor priest prominent in the Catholic educational system in Ontario. Starting in the Winter 2002 semester and ending in the Fall 2003 semester, a major renovation was completed on the school, displacing students between three separate campuses. Two were former elementary schools while the third campus was the remaining accessible part of the school. The expansion included a glass walled weight room, a new chapel, new flooring, offices, halls, lockers, and a new cafeteria. In Fall 2003, a 50th anniversary celebration/reunion was held in the newly renovated school where past decades of students attended. Certain hallways carried a theme to honor a decade (1950's, 1960's, 1970's, 1980's. 1990's and 2000's) where memorabilia was displayed. Each year, F.J. Brennan Catholic High School and St. Joseph's Catholic High School take part in the annual Father Zakoor Cup hockey game, where this past year 2019, the F.J. Brennan Cardinals beat the St. Joseph Lasers. The current record of the Zakoor Cup series is 15-5-3 in favour of Brennan. Cardinals player in 2014.

The house bought in 1615 by William Berkeley, eldest son of Rowland Berkeley (1548-1611) of Spetchley, was owned and lived in by the Berkeley family for nearly 350 years, but the manor is over one thousand years old. This family descended from the Berkeleys of Berkeley Castle Gloucestershire, and Eadnoth. Cotheridge Court is now a private residence of sub-divided flats. History =Before the Domesday Survey= In 963 Oswald, Bishop of Worcester, granted land called 'Coddanhrycce' to thegn Aelfric for three successive generations, being limited to male heirs. =Domesday Book= In the Domesday Book a timber- framed court is mentioned. The existing house dates back to the 16th century, and perhaps even further back. It is built upon the site of the original dwelling mentioned in the Domesday Book. =17th century= Prior to 1615, the manor was held by a succession of various owners. In 1615 it was sold to William Berkeley (1582-1658) of Cowleigh, eldest son of Rowland Berkeley (1548-1611) of Worcester and Spetchley, a wealthy Worcester clothier who originated from Hereford. The house then was a large, two-storey timber-framed dwelling with a third floor of gabled attics having carved bargeboards. The house contained a small, panelled room known as the 'sots hole' where drunks were held in order to sleep off their drunkenness. This room probably dates back to pre-15th century and before, when the house was a Court House. William, Sheriff of Worcestershire in 1617 was succeeded by his son, Sir Rowland Berkeley (1613‚Äì1696). Sir Rowland's only son, Thomas, died unmarried, on 25 October 1669, in Greece. He was on a diplomatic mission to Turkey, travelling with His Excellency Sir Daniel Harvey from King Charles II to Sultan Mahomethan, Emperor of the Turks. The two men were travelling from Constantinople towards Thessalonica when Thomas fell ill. He was 30 years old and his remains were buried amongst Christians. Having no other sons, Cotheridge Court passed to Sir Rowland's eldest daughter Elizabeth. She married in 1681 Henry Green who adopted the surname Berkeley. Their eldest son became the next Rowland Berkeley of Cotheridge who died in 1731. =18th century= In 1770 the entrance front to the house, as well as the south front were cased with brick and the old windows were replaced with large, sash windows. The old, gabled attics were concealed behind a wall of brick; and sham, glazed windows were added to the new, brick front giving the appearance of a third floor without attics. The north wing of the house, as well as part of the back were not modernized, and remained as timber and plaster. In 1764 another Rowland Berkeley (1732‚Äì1805) became Sheriff of Worcestershire and from May to September 1774 was Member of Parliament for Droitwich. Ha-ha In the mid- or late 18th century a ha-ha was installed where the gardens met with the pastureland. This was to provide the house with a clean view of the grazing cattle and the breath-taking, prominent Malvern Hills in the far distance. =19th century= Rowland Berkeley (1732‚Äì1805), was succeeded by his brother the Rev. Henry Rowland Berkeley, D.C.L., Fellow of New College, Oxford, who also died childless in 1832. Eventually it passed to William Berkeley Esquire who died in 1869 and the manor passed to his eldest son the Rev. William Comyns Berkeley. His son Rowland, eldest brother to Herbert Bowyer Berkeley inherited the manor. At about the mid-part of the century a delicate, ornamental stone balustrade was added to the top of the brick facing, above the sham, glazed windows.

Early life Langrishe was born John Sewell Folds Jr. in Dublin, Ireland on September 24, 1825. His father ran a print shop and Folds learned how to set type at a young age. A fire at his father's printing plant forced the family into bankruptcy and they immigrated to the United States. Landing in Boston on September 19, 1845, Folds sought to make his living in America as an actor.Lauterbach (2016) pp. 9‚Äì11 He made his way to New York City and worked for Horace Greeley as a reporter and typesetter for the New York Tribune. Because of Greeley's dislike of the theater, Folds adopted the Langrishe stage name, taking the surname from that of a judge and policeman that he knew in Ireland. Acting Langrishe was known to appear on stage at least once in his native Ireland, but made his New York acting debut on December 8, 1845 at the Chatham Theater in a play called The Irish Attorney as a character named Pierce O'Hara. In 1847 he left New York City to become a full-time actor, comedian and magician. Two years later in 1849 he married fellow actor Jeannette Allen in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, both performed in J.H. Howell's Theatre company in Erie, Pennsylvania. By 1850 Langrishe was performing with his own troupe known as \\"Langrishe and Company\\" throughout New York, Ohio and southeastern Canada.Lauterbach (2016) pp.14-18 Langrishe and Company travelled westward in 1851, crossing Lake Michigan to play in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Performances followed in Chicago, Illinois and Kansas City, Missouri; his troupe continued to draw favorable reviews in the Midwest as late as 1859 until the troupe began running out of money due to salaries and extensive wardrobes. Arriving in Central City, Colorado in 1860, Langrishe and Company performed to sold-out shows in mining towns as opposed to established cities. After close to a decade of performing in Colorado, the Langrishes made their way to Helena, Montana in 1870 where they built the Langrishe Opera House. The post-Civil War years showed a marked change in theatrical tastes of the West. Dramas were forsaken for minstrel shows and burlesque. Langrishe began to lose his fortune and modified his shows to suit the tastes of his audience. The company took to the road after the Langrishe Opera House burned down in 1874. Deadwood Langrishe arrived with his wife Jeannette and their Company in Deadwood, South Dakota on July 15, 1876 and their first performance was held at The Bella Union. Langrishe along with treasurer and troupe manager Jonas Hellawell, leased the McDaniels Theatre July 22, 1876 from Cheyenne, Wyoming theatre manager James McDaniels, who constructed the first theatre in Deadwood.Agnew(2011) pp.99‚Äì101 The Langrishe Theatre's first production was \\"Trodden Down\\" on July 29, 1876. The Langrishe Theatre provided facilities for the Jack McCall murder trial, the man accused in the death of Wild Bill Hickok, the first marriage to be performed in Deadwood August 26, 1876, George Morgan to L. McKelvey by Judge Kuykendall, and as a meeting place for the fraternal order, the Independent Order of Odd Fellows.Mitchell(2010) p.202 General George Crook and his officers would attend a performance at the Langrishe Theatre September 23, 1876 while visiting Deadwood.Mitchell(2010) p.126 Langrishe was an integral player in shaping Deadwood's early history as he participated in civic endeavors such as Fourth of July event planning and fund raising for health charities. The Langrishe Company's benefit performance October 14, 1876 donated receipts totaling over $73 to Deadwood's hospital kitty. Calamity Jane would appear at the Langrishe Theatre in 1876 along with noted attractions such as Jenny Lind Burlesque. Legitimate Deadwood actors and actresses, Fanny B. Price, Augusta Chambers, Belle Gilbert, Jim Gilbert, Frank Perkins, Jimmy J.M. Martin, W. J. Gross, Viola Porter, J.P. Clark and Emma Whittle performed nightly to packed houses while other forms of Deadwood entertainment and amusement drew equally large variety audiences at the Gem and Bella Union Theatres where Negro Minstrels, Clog Dancers, Acrobats, Child Contortionists, Double Trapeze, Brass Bands and Serio-comic Song and Character Sketch Artists Charles Vincent and Georgie Morrell Vincent were at the top of the bill. Langrishe leased and remodeled the Tremont House in Deadwood May 1879 and built new opera houses in the nearby mining towns of Central City and Lead, two and ten miles up Deadwood Gulch. On Langrishe Theatre opening night May 9, 1878, choice seats sold for $25 and theatre goers were tempted to sample strawberries and ice cream after the performance.Lauterbach (2016) pp.150-151 The Langrishe Theatre building would be rented to Impresario Johnny Rogers and The Metropolitan Company where legitimate theatre continued to be a successful choice of entertainment for an evolving Deadwood audience. The Old Langrishe Theatre building would continue to serve as a theatre and as a church for Congregationalist services until its final demise in the Big Deadwood Fire of September 26, 1879. Return to Colorado Many Deadwood miners and businessmen relocated to Leadville, Colorado in January 1879 to follow the promise of the new rush and the next big strike. Jack Langrishe and Company would once again take the stage with fellow Deadwood manager Billy Nuttall's Bella Union Theatre Company who opened the new Leadville Grand Central Theatre. Al Swearengen and the Gem Theater troupe visited Leadville February 1879, but chose to return to Deadwood. The Langrishe Troupe continued to perform to audiences in Deadwood, Central, Lead and to the soldiers at Ft. Meade through the summer of 1879. The Jack Langrishe Company's final performance to a Deadwood audience would be \\"Our American Cousin\\" August 15, 1879 performed by troupe artists The Gilberts. Jack and Jeannette Langrishe opened November 23, 1879 at the Tabor Opera House operated by Colorado Silver Baron Horace Austin Warner Tabor and Baby Doe Tabor, Leadville, Colorado. Popular Langrishe actor Jimmy Martin would join with fellow Gem and Bella Union Theatre artists Flora Belle and Fannie Garretson to open at Leadville's McDaniels Theatre May 1880.Lauterbach (2016) pp.158 Idaho Langrishe retired from the stage in 1885 and moved to Idaho where he served as a Justice of the Peace and occasional playwright in Coeur d'Alene.Agnew(2011) p.131 In 1890 he was elected to the State Senate as a republican in the first State Legislature of Idaho and served on committees which chose the state's flag, state seal and two senators for the US Senate.

Completed in 1839, the house is a distinctive example of transitional Greek Revival and Italianate architecture, and is nationally significant for the extremely well-preserved drawings on its interior walls. The site was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark on January 16, 2009. The house serves as the Davison Arts Center of Wesleyan University.  Relationship to its surroundings  This stately mansion faces east toward the Connecticut River from the west side of High Street opposite the intersection of Court Street. It is set back from the street atop a rise. A high iron fence borders the property along High Street. This house makes an important contribution to the elegance and high style which characterized High Street as the preferred residential area in nineteenth-century Middletown.  Significance  The Alsop house was built in 1838‚Äì1839 by Richard Alsop IV for his twice-widowed mother, Mrs. Maria (Alsop) Dana. The short-lived architectural firm formed by Landra Beach Platt and Francis Benne, who worked together in New Haven under the tutelage of Sidney Mason Stone, is believed responsible for the design. They may have been inspired by Ithiel Town's own house in New Haven. There are similarities between the two structures and Town was formerly credited with design of the Alsop House. (Stone's possible contributions have yet to be explored.) The well-known Middletown builders, Barzillai Sage and Isaac W. Baldwin, performed the masonry and carpentry work, respectively. The house remained in the hands of Alsop family until it was acquired in 1948 by Wesleyan University. This house is significant architecturally for its transitional Greek-Tuscan Italianate appearance. The cubical, two-story, central block with overhanging eaves is flanked by colonnaded -story wings. A swag-and-tassel design decorates the frieze of the central block, which also displays a veranda supported by delicate ironwork and surmounted by an intricate balustrade. A rear colonnaded wing, which originally housed servant's quarters and service facility, has been enclosed. At the west end of this wing are attached an art gallery of recent construction and the art library, originally the stable. The interior of the Alsop house is noted for its decorative wall paintings. The stair hall displays trompe l'oeil painting of figures in niches, while the parlors, dining room and morning-room feature oil-on-plaster paintings. The parlor paintings are classically derived and some subjects are Raphaelesque in origin. In the morning room, the formal classicism of the parlors is replaced by scenes derived from the \\"rural\\" Italian tradition of wall decoration. Local birds and insects are featured in these scenes. The dining room displays a painted frieze. The paintings are believed to have been executed by German or Italian immigrant artisans. Possible contributors include the noted Italian artist Nicola Monachesi. According to family documentation, the paintings were executed between 1839 and 1860. The main rooms of the house are furnished with period antiques and provide a suitable atmosphere in which to display the wall painting. In its carefully restored condition, the Alsop house remains a monument to the skill of its designers, while serving Wesleyan University and the community as an art center.

Ettore Annunziata, developed by Zono and published by Sega for the Sega Saturn in 1996. The soundtrack to Mr. Bones was composed and performed by Ronnie Montrose, with cutscenes and art assets done by Angel Studios. Story DaGoulian, a mad philosopher who believes that one can only \\"ensure the survival of good by making evil thrive\\", sets out to purify the world with evil. By playing a special set of drums powered by science and alchemy, he is able to tap into a primal power which he calls \\"skeletal magnetism\\" (or \\"skeletism\\") and summon the dead from their graves as his skeletal soldiers. One inmate of the cemetery, however, is pure of heart and is thus resurrected not with red (evil) skeletism, but with blue (good) skeletism. Because of this, he retains his free will. This fact is quickly noticed by DaGoulian, and he orders his newly created army to destroy this rebel, who calls himself simply \\"Mr. Bones.\\" Mr. Bones soon becomes determined to stop DaGoulian's plan. He must find a way to counteract the evil of red skeletism before DaGoulian's minions catch up to him. Gameplay One of Mr. Bones' most distinctive qualities is in it having very few levels which share the same style of gameplay; with only a few exceptions, almost every level looks and feels different from the rest. Some levels simply change the camera perspective, while others offer up their own distinct genre. The most common thread running throughout the game is that of an action/platform game with slight gameplay and viewing angle variations per level, but at times the styles diverge far more drastically, ranging from a music/rhythm game to a Breakout-style game to a game of memorization. Once a level has been beaten, the player can return directly to that level from the main menu any time they choose. In lieu of a normal health bar, Mr. Bones has a supply of skeletism. When his skeletism level drops, he gradually loses body parts, being reduced to just a skull and spine at his lowest levels. His lost body parts remain in play and can be reattached, though unless Mr. Bones regains skeletism the reattachment will be fragile and even landing from a significant height will cause the parts to fall off again. The game's physics also take Mr. Bones' state of completion into account; for example, if he has lost both legs he will crawl with his arms, and cannot run or jump. In most levels, Mr. Bones can shoot a beam from his hand which destroys enemies and restores his skeletism level. He can also restore skeletism by collecting blue items. Development The cinematics were designed and directed by Allen Battino, who also performed the role of Mr. Bones via motion capture. A playable demo of Mr. Bones was exhibited at the May 1996 Electronic Entertainment Expo. The music was composed by musician Ronnie Montrose. This was part of a larger trend of established musicians in the late 1990s who composed music for video games, with other examples being Ian McDonald composing for Wachenr√∂der and Stewart Copeland composing music for Spyro the Dragon. Reception Mr. Bones polarized reviewers, who sharply disagreed on whether the gameplay was bizarre and extraordinarily original, or mundane \\"hop n bop\\" platforming. GameSpots Tom Ham gave it a modest score but a relentlessly positive review, applauding the unique stage designs, varying perspectives, titular character, beautiful and eerie visual design, and blues- rock soundtrack. He summarized the game as \\"a cool, musically interactive, multi-level scroller that's surprisingly fun to play.\\" The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly were also enthralled, with Dan Hsu summarizing, \\"Mr. Bones is completely unique - you can tell that some true geniuses worked on this project.\\" Most of them commented that the different gameplay types in the many levels are consistently ingenious and fun, though Sushi-X said the gameplay is weak, and that it is the humorous and audio-visually stunning full-motion video cutscenes which make the game enjoyable. In contrast, Scary Larry of GamePro completely panned the game, citing \\"unfinished graphics\\", unfairly difficult enemy AI, and \\"insipid hop-n-bop gameplay.\\" He said the music is a positive point, but the spoken word background in \\"Glass Shards\\" is annoying. A Next Generation critic commented that the concept of the game is refreshingly unusual but that most of the levels use \\"fairly average\\" side- scrolling gameplay which does not live up to the originality of the concept. He still concluded the game to be moderately appealing due to its humor and especially its massive length. Lee Nutter of the British Sega Saturn Magazine said that, due in part to its much delayed PAL conversion, Mr. Bones was outdated by the time of its release in the UK. He contended that the different gameplay types just make the game feel like a generic platformer with a lot of out-of-place mini-games. However, his main criticism was that the game is too distinctively American.

Birth and childhood Mary Ann Gilbert was the daughter of Thomas Gilbert, who was a grocer in Lewes, Sussex. When he died in 1782, he left (by her own account) his widow and daughter almost penniless. After her mother's death in 1807, she frequently stayed with her uncle Charles at Eastbourne. Marriage On 18 April 1808, she married Davies Giddy, a Cornish landowner, who had served as High Sheriff of the Duchy.THE ARCHIVE OF THE DAVIES-GILBERT FAMILY OF EASTBOURNE, EAST SUSSEX, AND TRELISSICK, CORNWALL is held by East Sussex Record Office and consists of 2236 files. Its online catalogue entry provides much information about the family, under the heading \\"Administrative History. He was an M.P. for Cornish constituencies from 1806 to 1832. Among his roles in Parliament was as Chairman of the Board of Agriculture. Mary Ann Gilbert was passionately concerned about low agricultural productivity and the plight of the rural poor. Davies was more interested in how the Parish Rate for the support of unemployed might be reduced. Davies Giddy was also a professional applied mathematician and became a Fellow of the Royal Society, and, for an unhappy period, its President.ODNB, Todd (1967) Beyond the blaze. In 1814, Mary Ann Gilbert's uncle, Charles Gilbert, died. In his will, he left her much property in Sussex, or to a future husband, if he changed his name to \\"Gilbert\\". In December 1817 Davies Giddy took his wife's surname, \\"Gilbert\\", to perpetuate it. In January 1818, the names of their children were also changed. Agronomic experiment Sharing her husband's interest, Mary Ann Gilbert managed some successful practical agronomical experiments at Beachy Head in feeding the poor, or rather, teaching them to feed themselves using land no one else wanted, for a fair rent. She presented the statistical results of these works to her husband's political, scientific and \\"County\\" contacts. She was also a prominent member of the Labourer's Friend Society (later the Society for Improving the Condition of the Labouring Classes The Society for Improving the Condition of the Labouring Classes was established in 1844 with the Prince Consort as its President; Henry Roberts, its Honorary Architect, was a pioneer in the improvement of working-class housing.). Among those who advised her were Richard Whately, Anglican Archbishop of Dublin and his brother, the Vicar of Cookham in Berkshire, Edwin Chadwick and William Gill, of Chacewater, Cornwall. Topographic illustrations Her illustrations appear in Thomas Bond's Topographical and historical sketches of the boroughs of East and West Looe, in the county of Cornwall (1823).

Founded in 1947, it is a national academic centre of excellence, serving the legal community and universities across the United Kingdom and the world through legal scholarship, facilities, and its comparative law library. The mission of the Institute is to be \\"the focal point of legal research for the United Kingdom and the countries of the British Commonwealth.\\" Since 1976, the Institute‚Äôs home has been Charles Clore House, located in the heart of Bloomsbury, at 17 Russell Square. History The Institute of Advanced Legal Studies was established in 1947 in response to recommendations made in 1932 by Lord Atkin that the United Kingdom needed an institution \\"which would be a headquarters for academic research and would promote the advancement of knowledge of the law in the most general terms.\\" On 11 June 1948, the Institute was officially opened by the Lord Chancellor, William Jowitt, 1st Earl Jowitt. The first director was Professor Sir David Hughes Parry, a distinguished Professor of English Law at the London School of Economics and for many years Vice- Chancellor of the University of London. The Librarian, K. Howard Drake also acted as administrative secretary for the Institute. Charles Clore House at 17 Russell Square, London, the present home of the Institute of Advanced Legal Studies Housed at 25 Russell Square, the Institute occupied all floors of the building, the ground and first floors reserved for the library with rooms on the second and third converted into offices or study/seminar rooms. The library held 11,000 books in its first year, a substantial number donated by Dr. Charles Huberich. An internal telephone system connected all the rooms with a hand book lift installed to move books from floor to floor. By 1949, the Institute was running out of space and were given permission to extend into the basement and ground floor 26 Russell Square. Here it remained until 1976 when the Institute moved into No. 17 Russell Square, part of the newly built Charles Clore House designed by Sir Denys Lasdun. At the official opening on 1 April 1976, the then Chancellor of the University of London, Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, overstayed and her official schedule had to be abandoned. In 1994, the IALS became a member of the School of Advanced Study. The Institute is also home to the British Institute of International and Comparative Law. A five-year refurbishment of Charles Clore House is currently underway, the first phase of which was completed in September 2012, incorporating a larger caf√© and improved lecture facilities on the ground floor. Library =Collections= The Institute of Advanced Legal Studies at the Senate House History Day, 2019. The IALS library holds a collection of over 300,000 legal texts, complemented by over 3,000 current serial titles, reports, and legislative materials. It has been described as the \\"jewel in the Institute‚Äôs crown\\", and is a repository library for legal texts published in the United Kingdom. The library covers five floors of Charles Clore House with the library entrance on the fourth floor. The library catalogue forms part of a shared catalogue with its fellow School of Advanced Study institutes and that of Senate House Library. The Institute library is considered one of the world‚Äôs leading comparative research libraries, holding significant material not otherwise available in the United Kingdom. Jurisdictions covered include countries in, North America, Latin America, Europe (including the European Union) and the Commonwealth. The library is particularly strong in Public International Law. It has a large collection of United States Federal resources and holdings of State primary resources, focused on California, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Louisiana. Postgraduate law students of the University of London colleges, including University College London, London School of Economics and Political Science, King's College London, and Queen Mary, University of London rely exclusively on the Institute's research holdings for coursework. =Projects= Since the late 1990s, IALS has participated in collaborative and standalone digital projects resulting in a number of searchable databases publicly available via the website. These include FLAG (Foreign Law Guides), FIT (Flare Index to Treaties), and Eagle-I, which builds upon the original Jisc funded Intute: Law project (formerly SOSIG Law). =Collaborations= The IALS library has partnered with other libraries and organisations in promotions and projects to highlight legal research. The library concentrates on printed and digital resources, often as lead developer for web-based initiatives. Ongoing collaborations with the British Library and BAILII have led to increased web presence for legal research, with IALS hosting BAILII and supporting its role in providing free access to full text British and Irish legal materials. The Concordat with the British Library is a collaboration to map existing holdings in foreign legal materials in both libraries and collate information to form a national collection of foreign official gazettes. Recently the library became a charter member of LLCM- Digital, a US-based consortium of libraries dedicated to the preservation of legal documentation for dissemination via a searchable online database. Research The Institute actively promotes research by its own academic staff and students in conjunction with its role as a national legal research centre. Research centres at the Institute contribute to legal research via externally funded projects or study, with the Sir William Dale Centre, and Woolf Chair of Legal Education at the fore. Areas of research conducted by the Institute include legislative drafting, human rights, international financial regulation, and transnational taxation law. Notable recent works by Institute faculty includes Thornton's Legislative Drafting, Fifth Edition, by Professor Helen Xanthaki, and Foundations and Future of Financial Regulation and European Comparative Company Law by Professor Mads Andenas. Through its association with the School of Advanced Study, the Institute offers a number of fellowships for legal research to both national and international legal academics and practitioners. Fellows give lectures in their field of expertise during their tenure. Postgraduate Programmes There are over 70 Ph.D./M.Phil. students studying at the Institute of Advanced Legal Studies, in addition to postgraduate law students registered for LL.M. and M.A. degrees. Currently, the Institute offers three programmes of study: LL.M. in Advanced Legislative Studies, LL.M. in International Corporate Governance, Financial Regulation, and Economic Law, as well as the LL.M. in legal translation (Jointly with the Institute of Modern Language Research). The LL.M. in Advanced Legislative Studies, which the institute claims is \\"prized by governments around the world as the flagship degree in the subject,\\" trains lawyers from across the common law world in the art of statutory drafting, law reform, and the legislative process. The programme emphasizes a \\"blend of academic and practitioner concerns in [an] area of critical constitutional importance.\\" During the summer term, short courses are available on a variety of relevant topics. Courses include the Sir William Dale Centre Course in Legislative Drafting and the Certificate in International Commercial Arbitration.

Towns The Greater Lowell area as defined as the Lowell Metropolitan area consists of the towns of Billerica, Chelmsford, Dracut, Dunstable, Groton, Lowell, Pepperell, Tewksbury, Tyngsborough, and Westford. The town of Pelham, New Hampshire may also be included in Greater Lowell. The New England city and town area Division Lowell-Billerica-Chelmsford contains some towns that can be considered part of Greater Lowell, Ashby, Ayer, Billerica, Chelmsford, Dracut, Groton, Littleton, Lowell, Shirley, Tewksbury, Townsend, Tyngsborough, Westford, and Harvard in Massachusetts and Pelham in New Hampshire. Demographics The towns of Greater Lowell in Massachusetts have a combined population of 299,550 based on the 2010 census. Including the town of Pelham, Greater Lowell has 312,447 inhabitants. Culture and Education The city of Lowell is a cultural and institutional center for the region. It is home to the Tsongas Center at UMass Lowell and the Lowell National Historical Park, which preserves the region's legacy as an early textile manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution. The University of Massachusetts Lowell and a campus of Middlesex Community College are located in the city as well, as are Lowell General Hospital and Saints Medical Center, the regional hospitals. Greater Lowell Technical High School serves many of the towns in the region. Lowell is home to the Superior and District Court for Northern Middlesex County and is technically a county seat, although Massachusetts counties are largely historical in function. Culturally, many residents of Greater Lowell have deep roots in the city itself, tend to be more blue collar, and speak with an urban Boston accent. Greater Lowell is split politically while the region as a whole is more likely to vote for a conservative candidate than other parts of the state whereas the city of Lowell is more likely to vote liberally.http://www.massinc.org/index.php?id=610http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2006/06/04/the_state_im_in/ Economy Unemployment rate of Greater Lowell (blue) compared to that of Massachusetts (red) from 1990 through 2011. Note that the data for Massachusetts is seasonally adjusted, while that for Greater Lowell is not; that is why the former line is smoother than the latter. Employment by sector in Greater Lowell in 2010 The economy of Greater Lowell is closely tied to that of Greater Boston. Outside of the services, health, and retail sectors, major employers are in high technology and defense, with a still-shrinking manufacturing sector. Suburban sprawl and serious economic hardships have reduced the role Lowell plays in its suburbs over the decades. The entire region is often considered a component of the much larger Greater Boston area, as Lowell is only 25 miles from downtown Boston. Suburban office parks, shopping malls, and the severe decline of heavy industry in New England have pulled the economic focus away from the once great industrial and commercial base in Lowell itself. Additionally, the population of Lowell is at 1900 levels despite large growth among the suburban population.

Archaeologists at Gwynedd Archaeological Trust consider it to have been a royal home and have established an exhibition in the Pritchard- Jones Institute in the village on their findings supporting this theory. Excavations reveal that the enclosure had a hall, accommodation and storage barns, originally built in stone and wood. The buildings may have occupied an area as much as . A fierce sandstorm in the winter of 1332 buried the site and much of the surrounding area, which may have caused the decline in activity during the 14th century revealed by the archaeological investigation. When Henry Rowlands was writing in the early 18th century, the sands had uncovered parts of the walls, but no significant remains were visible, though he comments that local people were aware of the location and nature of the remains, a site sometimes known as 'llys' or 'cae'r llys' ('the field of the court' in English). From 1992 it was excavated by the Gwynedd Archaeological Trust and was opened to the public for the first time in 1995. What remains is the outlines of the walls, around only a quarter of which are exposed, including the main surrounding wall and foundations and lower walls of three large buildings, possibly the hall, a chamber and storage barns. Many artifacts were recovered from the site, including pottery and silverware indicating use by people of a high social status, as well as lead fishing weights. It is the only royal court of Gwynedd whose site has so far been excavated. Reconstruction at St Fagans A reconstruction of the Great Hall of Llys Rhosyr was built as part of the redevelopment of St Fagan's National History Museum, Cardiff, using a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund awarded in 2012. It was proposed that the building, with its walls, would be able to accommodate groups overnight on completion. The hall and the nearby chamber were modelled on the two most thoroughly excavated buildings on the original site. Reconstruction of Llys Llewelyn at St Fagan's The building was opened to the public in October 2018 and the first group of visitors to spend the night were children and teachers from Ysgol Santes Dwynwen School in Newborough, Anglesey, in May 2019.

In 1999 it merged with Hoechst AG to form Aventis. As of 2015, the pharmaceutical operations of Rh√¥ne-Poulenc are part of Sanofi and the chemicals divisions are part of Solvay group and Bayer Crop Science. History The company was founded in 1928 through the merger of Soci√©t√© des usines chimiques du Rh√¥ne (Society of Rh√¥ne Chemical Factories) from Lyon and Poulenc Fr√®res (Poulenc Brothers) from Paris founded by √âtienne Poulenc, a 19th-century Parisian apothecary and brought to prominence by his second and third sons √âmile, father of composer Francis Poulenc, and Camille Poulenc (1864‚Äì1942). In 1950, the company synthesized chlorpromazine which it sold to Smith, Kline & French (today part of GlaxoSmithKline) who marketed the drug as Thorazine. In 1990, it merged with the pharmaceutical company Rorer to form Rh√¥ne-Poulenc Rorer.Rh√¥ne Poulenc In January 1999, Rh√¥ne-Poulenc merged with Hoechst AG to form Aventis. In 2004, Aventis went on to merge with Sanofi- Synth√©labo forming Sanofi-Aventis, the third largest pharmaceutical company in the world. In 2011, Sanofi-Aventis decided to drop the Aventis suffix and change its name to Sanofi. In 1997, its chemicals division was spun off into a separate company named Rhodia and was later acquired by the Solvay group in 2011. The agricultural chemicals division of Rh√¥ne-Poulenc, known as Aventis CropScience after the merger with Hoechst, was sold to the German chemical and pharmaceutical company Bayer in 2002. In 1997 Rh√¥ne-Poulenc came to play a central part in what is claimed to be the worst environmental accident in Sweden's history. Rh√¥ne-Poulenc supplied Rhoca-Gil for the building of the Hallands√•s tunnel. The chemical leaked into the artesian water, causing great damage to cattle, surrounding nature and workers at the construction site. Rh√¥ne-Poulenc was criticised for not pointing out the risks of using the sealant, which contained acrylamide and is considered to be carcinogenic. Criminal charges were brought against the company and In June 2001, the managing director of the former Rh√¥ne-Poulenc Sweden was found guilty of breaching the Chemical Products Act, and was to pay 60 day-fines at SEK650 for a total of SEK60 000.M√•rald (2007), p. 111-117 - See also printed sources Rh√¥ne-Poulenc originally funded the Rh√¥ne-Poulenc Prizes, now known as the Royal Society Prizes for Science Books.

This approach to growth management is unique among states. The act (Chapter 36.70A RCW) was adopted by the Legislature in 1990. The GMA was adopted because the Washington State Legislature found that uncoordinated and unplanned growth posed a threat to the environment, sustainable economic development and the quality of life in Washington. Rather than centralize planning and decision-making at the state level, the GMA focuses on local control. The GMA establishes state goals, sets deadlines for compliance, offers direction on how to prepare local comprehensive plans and regulations and sets forth requirements for early and continuous public participation. Within the framework provided by the mandates of the Act, local governments have many choices regarding the specific content of comprehensive plans and implementing development regulations. The Growth Management Hearings Board hears and determines allegations that a government agency has not complied with the GMA or the related Shoreline Management Act (SMA, Chapter 90.58 RCW). A 1991 law amended the GMA to create three regional boards, but a 2010 law consolidated them into one. SMA jurisdiction was added in 1996. The board's administrative rules of practice and procedure are found in the Washington Administrative Code (Title 242-02 WAC).

It was released on May 30, 2005 by Massacre Records. It was generally well-received both popularly and critically; for instance, it was voted to be in the top 20 albums of 2005 by the users of the Metal Storm webzine. Background After its re-formation in 2001, Timeless Miracle, then known as Trapped, was composed of only two members, Mikael Holst and Fredrik Nilsson, who considered the band to be merely a hobby, but decided to record three demos in 2002‚Äì2004 using a drum machine. In 2004, the band was approached by a record label with an offer of a contract. In 2005, after the line-up was completed by the drummer Jaime Salazar and the guitarist Sten M√∂ller, Timeless Miracle began recording their d√©but album, mainly composed of tracks that first appeared on the demos. Music Into the Enchanted Chamber is a melodies-driven album with prominent keyboards, influenced by the classical and folk music. The lyrics, dealing with the supernatural themes, are greatly inspired by the old horror movies, such as The Wolf Man and Curse of the Devil, as well as by the medieval Nordic folklore and create a dark atmosphere, in contrast to the much more joyous-sounding music. The songs with the strong folkloric influences include \\"Witches of Black Magic\\", which is inspired by the legends of Blockula and \\"Return of the Werewolf\\", featuring Little Red Riding Hood. The title track explores the theme of a religious cult, which drives its followers to mass suicide. The ballad \\"Memories\\" is the only track not to appear on the demos, having been written long prior.

The shootings sparked protests in European and American press and turned world's attention to the treatment of minorities in the Hungarian part of Austria-Hungary. Outline of the events =Pretext= On the initiative of Andrej Hlinka, the Slovak parish priest of nearby Ru≈æomberok (R√≥zsahegy) and a native of ƒåernov√°, people of the city decided to raise money for the construction of a new church. The locals raised 80,000 crowns, and the collections received minor donations from Slovak Americans as well. The construction started in April 1907 and by the autumn, the church was ready for consecration.http://www.cernova.sk/sublinks/cernovska_masakra1.html The locals wanted the church to be consecrated by Hlinka, however, he was at the time suspended by bishop S√°ndor P√°rvy and sentenced to two years of imprisonment due to his pro-Slovak agitation during the election campaign of 1906 and the subsequent conviction of incitement. The people of ƒåernov√° thus demanded the consecration to be postponed until Hlinka would be able to perform the ceremony. The bishopric denied their request and two Hungarian speaking priests were appointed in his stead: first, Canon Anton Kurimsky, and after his refusal, Dean Martin Pazurik of Likavka. The ceremony was to take place on 27 October 1907. The official procession arrived at the village accompanied by a squad of 15 gendarmes. It was protested against by the locals, who attempted to block its way to the church to prevent Pazurik from consecrating. The demonstration was peaceful in nature although some accounts report stone-throwing at a member of the gendarme escort. In panic the gendarme leader sergeant J√°n Ladiczky, an ethnic Slovak,Slota √∫jabb kirohan√°sa: tov√°bb s√©rtegeti a magyarokat ordered his squad to open fire into the crowd without prior warning killing 15 of the protesting villagers, seriously wounding 12 and lightly injuring 40.http://www.cernova.sk/sublinks/cernovska_masakra3.html The majority of the members of the Hungarian gendarmes involved in the shooting were of Slovak origin (five persons from the total seven), and they performed the shootings not because of any ethnic reason, but they were obligated to do so according to the rules of their service.Roman Holec szerint egyes politikusok r√©gi m√≠toszokat pr√≥b√°lnak √∫jra√©leszteni Interview with Roman Holec, historian Consequences Hlinka's appeal against his 1906 verdict was rejected, thus, on 30 November 1907 Hlinka started to serve his jail term in the Csillagb√∂rt√∂n (Star Prison), Szeged. On the other hand, Hlinka appealed with success his suspension to the Holy See, so it was cancelled on 8 April 1909. When Hlinka left the prison, Bishop P√°rvy appointed him again to his Ru≈æomberok parish, and Hlinka consecrated the church in ƒåernov√° with P√°rvy's consent. The tragedy sparked protests in the European and US press and it turned the world's attention to the attitude to the minorities in Hungary. Today's Slovak politicians ‚Äî especially the members of the Slovak National Party interpret the event as \\"Hungarian gendarmes shooting at innocent Slovaks\\". With many of their claims regarding the events, the Slovak National Party continues to perpetuate a \\"false myth of ƒåernov√°\\".Egy elfelejtett sort≈±z nyom√°ban A sz√≥viv≈ë Rafael Rafaj al√°√≠r√°s√°val ell√°tott dokumentum annak ellen√©re √°polja tov√°bb csernova hamis m√≠tosz√°t, hogy egy √©vtizede m√°r komoly, a legend√°kkal, t√©vhitekkel lesz√°mol√≥ monogr√°fia sz√≥l az esetr≈ël egy szlov√°k t√∂rt√©n√©sz, Roman Holec toll√°b√≥l. Some Slovak sources claim that the gendarmes were ethnic Hungarian. even though there was a very small number of ethnic Hungarians in the region where the gendarmes were recruited. According to Slovak historian Roman Holec, professor at Comenius University in Bratislava, the majority of the gendarmes were Slovaks from Lipt√≥ county. (According to the official 1910 census, over 90% of the population were ethnic Slovaks in that county.) They were nevertheless honored for the deed, because they were in the service of Hungarian state. Both the rioters and the gendarmes can be held responsible for the massacre. The rioters were violent from lack of fear of getting shot (i.e. that the sergeant would refrain from giving an order of fire or use blanks). The gendarmes were shooting in all directions instead of aiming for feet or into the air (most victims died due to their head and chest injuries).

Despite its title, there was no previous \\"Power Punch\\" game. Storyline Mark \\"Tough Guy\\" Tyler is the undefeated heavyweight champion of the world, with an Olympic gold medal and a 33-0 (30 KO) record to his claim. After knocking out another opponent with ease, Tyler and his manager taunt the world by saying that nobody can stop him.

Gameplay The game includes a scoring system based on punch percentages as well as knockdowns. Rounds are only one minute long. Development Originally, the game was to feature real life heavyweight boxer Mike Tyson as its protagonist and was titled Mike Tyson's Intergalactic Power Punch. A prototype featuring Mike Tyson was leaked in 2009. However, Beam Software changed the protagonist's name, possibly due to Tyson's mounting legal troubles.

Gravity then acts on the liquid pulling it down in the cavity forming a semicircle. As the sensor is rotated the liquid remains in this semicircular pattern covering a different area of the etched plate. This change in area results in a change in the capacitance. The change in capacitance is then electronically converted into an output signal that is linear with respect to the input angle.

Marsden's house on Lincoln's Inn Fields, close to the Royal College of Surgeons William Marsden (August 1796 ‚Äì 16 January 1867) was an English surgeon whose main achievements are the founding of two presently well-known hospitals, the Royal Free Hospital (in 1828) and the Royal Marsden Hospital (in 1851). Marsden was born in Sheffield, Yorkshire, the youngest of eight children. When he left school he was apprenticed to a wholesale druggist in Sheffield. In 1816, he moved to London where he took up an apprenticeship to a surgeon-apothecary before setting up on his own. At the end of 1824 he enrolled as a student of surgery at St Bartholomew's Hospital under the famous surgeon and lecturer John Abernethy (1764‚Äì1831). In April 1827 Marsden passed his MRCS examination to qualify as a full surgeon. He became an MD in 1838. After discovering the difficulties the poor had in obtaining medical treatment, Marsden sought to establish a free hospital in London for which \\"poverty and sickness are the only passports\\".Statement originating in the 1830s that was added to the cover of the Royal Free Hospital's annual reports from 1889. (Royal Free Archive Centre, Royal Free Hospital Annual Reports) In 1828 he set up a small dispensary at 16 Greville Street, Hatton Garden, Holborn, which was named the London General Institution for the Gratuitous Cure of Malignant Diseases. This was later constituted as the Royal Free Hospital, and moved to the Gray's Inn Road in the 1840s. A few years later, Marsden turned his attention to cancer sufferers and, in 1851, set up another small establishment in Cannon Row, Westminster. This grew into the Brompton Cancer Hospital (now the Royal Marsden Hospital, Fulham Road site). Marsden married Ann Bishop, known as Betsy-Ann, in 1820. They had four children, three sons and a daughter, but only one of them, Alexander Edwin Marsden, a surgeon (1832‚Äì1902), survived into adulthood. Betsy-Ann died of cancer in 1846 and Marsden married his second wife, Elizabeth Abbott. William Marsden died at a hotel in Richmond, Surrey, in 1867.England & Wales, National Probate Calendar (Index of Wills and Administrations), 1858-1966, 1973-1995 He is buried in West Norwood Cemetery, South London .

Completed in 1874, it is one of the city's finest examples of Gothic Revival architecture. Its nearby former rectory, also known as the Bishop Acheson House, is one of its finest Colonial Revival houses. The two buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Church =Relationship to surroundings= This Gothic church at 381 Main Street faces east from the west side of Main Street on the central block between Court and Washington streets. it is set back from the street with a lawn in front. Its substantial appearance, emphasized by the sombre tones of the heavy brownstone construction, contrasts greatly with the flat facades and brightly decorated storefronts on Main Street. =Significance= A more distant and perhaps earlier view (note the smaller trees) of the church than the postcard above, although this postcard was also sent in 1910 The Episcopal Church in Middletown had its beginnings as early as 1724. Unlike many Colonial Anglican churches, it was firmly committed to the patriot cause during the American Revolution. This is the third meeting house of the parish, which was formally established as Christ Church in 1750. Several of its ministers have become bishops, including Abraham Jarvis, John Williams, and Edward Campion Acheson, father of Dean Acheson.ourhistory The church was built in 1870-1874. Henry Dudley was the architect and the firm of McConochie, Moor and Mylechreest was the prime contractor. Constructed of local brownstone, this church displays a symmetrically arranged facade with a buttressed bell tower at the southeast corner. A large rose tracery window is the dominant decorative feature of this facade, which also displays arched and lancet windows. The tower lacks a spire but features narrow arched windows which emphasize its verticality, and echo the fenestration of the facades. The interior displays elaborate tracery trusses support on cast iron posts. The present altar and reredos were added around 1892 and were designed by Charles Haight of New York. In the two decades following the American Civil War, a number of institutional buildings were constructed in the Gothic Revival style in Middletown. The design of this church is representative of that pattern. =Current use and condition= The church continues to be used as a church and is in good condition. The restoration of most of the stained glass windows was completed in 2011. Its current missional curate is the Rev. Mary Russell Barnett and missional priest in charge is the Rev. Mary Anne Osborn. Rectory 144 Broad Street, Middletown, Connecticut (2012) The former rectory at 144 Broad Street, also known as the Bishop Acheson House, is now St. Luke's Housing for the Elderly. It is of the Colonial Revival style and was built in 1902-1903. The builder and architect are not known. =Relationship to surroundings= This large house is set back from the street on a large, well landscaped lot. The street is primarily residential with mid to late 19th century houses. Nearby are two small commercial buildings and the Gothic Revival Russell Library. =Significance= This house, built in 1902, was the third rectory of the Holy Trinity Church. The Reverend Edward Campion Acheson, the eighteenth rector of the church, was the first occupant. His son, Dean Acheson, served as Secretary of State under President Harry S. Truman. Upon the Reverend Mr. Acheson's resignation from the pulpit in 1915 he became the sixth Bishop of Connecticut. the house no longer serves as a rectory for Holy Trinity Church. It is now residential apartments for the elderly, known as St. Luke's. This large house is an excellent example of the Georgian Revival style, with well executed details: six column entrance portico with balustrade; Palladian window; and modillioned cornice. =Current use and condition= The building has been converted into an elderly residential apartments run by St. Luke's.

Set in the future, the two romantic leads in this version are androids who fall in love despite a taboo against their kind having such relationships. The special aired in the United States on CBS on April 14, 1979. The special is also known as Runaway Robots! Romie-0 and Julie-8. Plot In the future, two rival robotics firms are hard at work trying to create the next major leap in robotics. Both tout their wares at the latest robotics convention. The Mega Stellar Company has released their Romie-0 model of robot, while Super Solar Cybernetics has released Julie-8. However, unforeseen by their creators, Romie-0 and Julie-8 begin to fall in love, harboring feelings for the other. After the convention, Romie-0 comes to Julie-8, and admits that due to their company's rivalry, they most likely cannot be together. The two decide to run away in order to keep from being broken up. Unsure where to go, they come across a rather shifty individual named Gizmo, who agrees to help them find a safe haven. Meanwhile, both of the two robots' creators (Mr. Thunderbottom and Ms. Passbinder) find that their creations are gone. At first they blame the other for stealing their creation, but then agree to work in tandem to find their robots when it turns out that neither one knows what has become of them. Unknown to the two creators, Gizmo has transported Romie-0 and Julie-8 to a planet of junk named Trash-0-Lot, where the two come face-to-face with an enormous Junk Monster named Sparepartski. The monster has Romie-0 transported to the other side of the planet, but imprisons Julie-8 for his own purposes. Gizmo appears to her shortly afterward, and suggests that she offer to marry the Junk Monster in exchange for Romie-0's freedom off the planet. Julie-8 decides to try this offer, and Sparepartski accepts, much to the girl's displeasure. While happy for Romie-0's release, Julie-8 is saddened over her fate, and removes a necessary circuit, causing her to 'die.' In the meantime Sparepartski has found Thunderbottom and Passbinder's ship nearby, and taken them prisoner as well. Unknown to Julie-8, Romie-0 has managed to escape from the other side of the planet, and has made his way to her chambers. Upon finding her with her circuit removed, Romie-0 reinstalls it, and the two attempt to escape. Along their way out, they encounter their creators trussed up, and set about freeing them. However, their escape does not go unnoticed, and Sparepartski soon starts to chase them across the junkscape. The two robot lovers carry their creators in hopes to get them to safety, but end up locking up when they run into a 'rust storm.' The immobilization of the two robots causes their creators to carry them out of harm's way. The rust storm also claims Sparepartski, who it is then revealed was a giant scrap concoction created and operated by Gizmo. Gizmo reveals his love for machines, and after seeing Julie-8 at the robotics convention, wanted to make her his bride. Romie-0 and Julie-8 then convince Gizmo that with the amount of trash on the planet, he could very well fashion his own sweetheart. Meanwhile, Mr. Thunderbottom and Ms. Passbinder (who have fallen in love with each other) have reconciled their differences, deciding to unite their robotics houses in a merger, much to the delight of Romie-0 and Julie-8.

Mary Ruwart credits the Tannehill's book with winning her over to anarcho-capitalism. Doug Casey was also converted to anarcho-capitalism after reading the book at the behest of Jarret Wollstein. According to the Ludwig von Mises Institute, it was written just following a period of intense study of the writings of both Ayn Rand and Murray Rothbard. It was the first significant anarcho-capitalist work to hit the libertarian movement, coming into print a year before Rothbard's Power and Market although Rothbard's book had been written earlier. Like Rothbard's Man, Economy, and State, The Market For Liberty opposes statutory law and advocates natural law as the basis for society; however, unlike Man, Economy, and State, which explains what sort of libertarian legal code the market would create in an anarcho-capitalist society, The Market for Liberty points out that society would not be lawless in the absence of the state.Brown, Susan Love, The Free Market as Salvation from Government: The Anarcho-Capitalist View, Meanings of the Market: The Free Market in Western Culture, edited by James G. Carrier, Berg/Oxford, 1997, p. 113. Conversely, The Market for Liberty spends a great deal of time outlining how different businesses and organizational structures would interact in a laissez-faire society and how these interactions would create checks which would ultimately keep the tendency for crime low. In keeping with radical free-market principles, the book is skeptical about the potential for violent anarcho- capitalist revolution to bring about good outcomes. Summary =Part I ‚Äì The Great Conflict= Chapter 1, If We Don't Know Where We're Going..., notes the growing dissatisfaction among youth, the many problems society faces, and the need for a clear goal rather than just an adversary (e.g. the state). It claims that the authors are not advocating any type of utopia that depends on the infallibility of man in order to function. It contends that if the present system is brought crashing down without valid ideas having been disseminated about how society can function without governmental rule, people will demand a strong leader, and a Hitler will rise to answer their plea. Chapter 2, Man and Society, argues that the nature of man is such that he must think and produce in order to live; and that in order to reach his full potential, he must have the right not only to do these things but to enjoy the rewards of his productive actions. It defines a laissez-faire society as one that \\"does not institutionalize the initiation of force and in which there are means for dealing with aggression justly when it does occur.\\" It notes that only the possessor of a right can alienate himself from that right. If one does $100 of damage to a taxicab, for instance, then he alienates himself from his right to that $100. The cabbie then has a moral right to use force to collect it. Chapter 3, The Self-Regulating Market, states that state interference causes the buyer, the seller, or both in a transaction to lose and that only a voluntary trade can be a completely satisfactory trade. It notes that markets clear; that taxation is economic hemophilia; regulation amounts to slow strangulation; that market monopolies can only attain and maintain monopoly status through excellence and low prices; and that without freedom of the market, no other freedom is meaningful. It criticizes the government for red tape which denies entrepreneurs opportunities to rise out of poverty. Chapter 4, Government ‚Äì An Unnecessary Evil, states that government is a coercive monopoly; that democratic governments decide issues largely on the basis of pressure from special interest groups; and that the notion of \\"a government of laws, not of men\\" is meaningless because laws must be written and enforced by men, and therefore a government of laws is a government of men. It argues that the eternal vigilance which is held to be the price of liberty is a constant non-productive expenditure of energy, and that is it grossly unreasonable to expect men to keep expending their energy in such a way out of unselfish idealism. It also argues that because of the danger of one interest group using the government to impose laws favoring itself or crippling its opponents, people are constantly in fear of different interest groups. Thus, blacks fear suppression by whites; whites worry about blacks gaining too much power; and any number of other groups, such as labor and management, urbanites and suburbanites, etc., are pitted against each other. Government is identified as a cause of strife. The checks and balances of government are also recognized as a source of waste that is no substitute for external checks such as competition. This chapter identifies many tools by which the government convinces people that government is necessary, such as state schools that brainwash the young into accepting pro-State ideas, investing government with tradition and pomp and identifying it with \\"our way of life.\\" It also blames people for having a fear of self-responsibility. =Part II ‚Äì A Laissez-Faire Society= Chapter 5, A Free and Healthy Economy, begins by noting the difficulties people have in picturing a society radically different from their own. It concludes that poverty would be better addressed by a laissez-faire society for many reasons, including the fact that unemployment is caused by the government, that untaxed businesses would have more profits to reinvest in productivity-enhancing technology, that private charities are more efficient than government, that parents would be more likely to avoid having excess children in the absence of social safety nets, etc. It argues that a plethora of choices in education would emerge in a free market. It also notes that the focus of media in a laissez-faire society would shift from covering government to covering business and individuals and that abuses would be checked by reporters looking for stories on aggression or fraud. The chapter argues that the quality of health care could be more efficiently kept at an adequate level through reputation, standards instituted by insurance companies, etc. It also discusses how currency could be provided without government. Chapter 6, Property ‚Äì The Great Problem Solver, argues that most social problems could be solved through an increase in the amount and type of property owned. It claims that taxation is theft and that regulation by initiated force is slavery. It argues that it should be possible to claim ownership over the ocean floor, the surface of other planets, corridors of airspace, radio wavelengths, and so on, by being the first to occupy them or otherwise clearly stake out territory. It also argues that all public property should be privatized in order to reduce crime and pollution. Chapter 7, Arbitration of Disputes, argues that governmental arbiters are not necessary, since a man who agrees to the settlement of disputes by a third party and then breaks the contract would suffer harm to his reputation and be ostracized, thus solving the problem of noncompliance. It notes that the government's judges will tend to be biased in favor of government, since that is the entity from which they receive their salaries and power. It promotes the concept of insurance companies as a substitute for government as the institution used to pursue claims; in the event a person were defrauded, they could file a claim with their insurance company, and the insurer would obtain the right of subrogation. Insurers who, themselves, committed abuses would suffer loss of reputation and be at a competitive disadvantage to more reputable insurers. Chapter 8, Protection of Life and Property, asserts that a person has the right to defend his life against aggression; and that he therefore has the right to defend his possessions as well, since they are the results of his investment of parts of his life and are, thus, extensions of that life. It notes, \\"Pacifism encourages every thug to continue his violent ways, even though the pacifist may devoutly wish he wouldn't (wishes don't create reality). Pacifistic behavior teaches the aggressor that crime does pay and encourages him to more and bigger aggressions. Such sanctioning of injustices is immoral, and because it is immoral, it is also impractical.\\" It argues that self-defense is a personal responsibility, which one can fulfill by hiring an agent to protect him, such as a private defense agency. It distinguishes initiated force from retaliatory force, noting that the former is not a market phenomenon because it acts to destroy the market; but the latter is a market phenomenon because it restrains aggressors who would destroy it and/or exacts reparations from them. It notes that government creates a social environment which breeds crime through its prohibitions on gambling, prostitution, drugs, and so on. It argues that the main role of police is to protect the government, rather than the citizens. It contrasts the police with private defense agencies, which would focus on preventing aggression and whose officers would lack immunity for any offenses they might commit. It also notes that insurance companies might sell policies covering the insured against loss resulting from any type of coercion and that these insurers could bring unruly defense agencies to their knees through ostracism and boycotts. Yet, at the same time, the insurers would seek to avoid taking such action without cause, since it could be costly and result in boycotts against the insurer itself. Chapter 9, Dealing with Coercion, argues that punishment in the form of eye for an eye vengeance does nothing to compensate the victim, and therefore opposes justice. It argues that an aggressor should repay the victim for his loss and for all expenses occasioned by the aggression, such as the cost of apprehending the offender. It further states that when an offender could not pay the restitution for a crime in his lifetime, the additional expenses could be paid by the insurance company. Chapter 10, Rectification of Injustice, notes that some criminals of a particularly untrustworthy nature might need to work off their debt in workhouses. To insure against refusal to work, the reparations payments would be deducted from each pay before room and board costs, and those who refused to work would not eat or would have only a minimal diet. A variety of degrees of confinement would exist. The argument that the rich would buy crime is refuted by the argument that even a wealthy man could be killed in self-defense if he attempted a violent act and that he would risk his reputation as well. Chapter 11, Warring Defense Agencies and Organized Crime, asserts the falsity of the assumption that government is necessary to prevent the initiation of force by arguing that government, as a coercive monopoly, must initiate force in order to survive. It notes several factors that would make a private defense agency avoid aggression. It would put itself at risk of retaliation and would lead its customers to fear that, in the event of a falling-out, it would turn its aggressive force against them. Moreover, insurers would consider the company to be a poor risk. Its employees would also be liable for any damages they caused, which would cause problems between the companies and its employees if it ordered unjustified attacks. It also speculates that a mafia-style agency would be unlikely to survive since there would be no black market to support it. The chapter argues that a tyrant would have more difficulty rising to power under a system of competing private defense agencies than under a governmental system, because customers oppressed by their company could simply switch to another company and obtain protection from the tyrant. Chapter 12, Legislation and Objective Law, argues that free men, acting in a free market, would manage their affairs in accordance with natural law. It calls statutory law a clumsy, anachronistic, and unjust hindrance. It also argues that government judges have no market signals to guide their decisions, in contrast to free-market arbiters, who have profit and loss as a built-in correction mechanism. Chapter 13, Foreign Aggression, notes that governments obtain the resources used for defense from the people, and those same resources can be used by private defense agencies to protect the people from aggression. It argues that governments aggravate or threaten other governments to the point of armed conflict and then coerce their citizens into protecting them. It notes that the ability of aggression insurers to pay claims would be enhanced by the limited damage resulting from the fact that foreign aggressors would need to use conventional warfare in wars of conquest to avoid destroying the property and slaves they seek to gain. It notes that in a laissez-faire society, there would be no government that could surrender to the enemy; defenders would fight as long as they perceived it was in their best interest. Chapter 14, The Abolition of War, argues that government, not business, is responsible for the formation of the military‚Äìindustrial complex. It notes that the burden of supporting wars falls heavily on business, since taxes are taken out of the pocket of the consumer. Moreover, businesses are a society's producers, and it is a society's producers who pay the bills. Business also suffers from wars because of the disruption of trade and the ruin and poverty that result. Government, however, gains from wars because it is left with more power, more money, and more territory. War also helps unite the people behind the government in the face of a \\"common enemy.\\" The authors conclude that all that is needed to abolish war is to abolish government. =Part III ‚Äì How Do We Get There?= Chapter 15, From Government to Laissez Faire, argues that first and foremost, the economy should be provided with media of exchange to replace the dollar. It states that possession of public property should be taken by individuals who, simply by clearly marking their claims, become the rightful owners. It argues against disposing of public property at auction, since bureaucrats would figure out ways to divert the proceeds into their own pockets, and the system would be biased toward the rich, many of whom obtained their wealth through political pull. The process of auctioning off the property would also prolong the politicians' power. Chapter 16, The Force Which Shapes the World, argues that it is immoral to destroy the private property or life of an individual who has not aggressed against one. It argues that violent revolution is not only destructive, but actually strengthens the government. It also notes that a revolution's leaders could then become the next rulers. Because of the people's desire for a leader to get them out of chaos, the chapter opines that a violent revolution would pave the way for a new Hitler. This chapter calls for people to share ideas related to freedom, which can eventually lead to widespread non-cooperation with government.

Their significance in Hispanic popular culture comes from being perceived as an archetype of this type of band at the time. Parch√≠s' original five members were Constantino Fern√°ndez Fern√°ndez (the red pawn), Yolanda Ventura Rom√°n (the yellow pawn), Oscar Ferrer Ca√±adas (the blue pawn), Gemma Prat Termens (the green pawn), and David Mu√±oz Forcada (the rolling die, which is singular for dice). After several line-up changes, the group disbanded in 1982 with various members continuing successful careers in the world of entertainment. The group's name is a reference to the board game, Parcheesi (translated as Parch√≠s in Spanish), where each player represents a different colored pawn (red, yellow, blue, and green). In the same way, each member of the group dressed in one of these four colors with the fifth member representing the dice. History Parch√≠s was created in 1979, after executives from the Belter Records company placed a newspaper ad in Barcelona, asking children to attend auditions to form a musical group. At first, Belter Records intended to employ the group members during summers only; the company's executives figured out that would be the best season of the year for Parch√≠s albums and concerts to sell. Parch√≠s was neither a boy or girl band. Eventually, the band expanded to have six members at the same time. Gemma Pratts Tremens, David Mu√±oz Forcada, Oscar Ferrer Ca√±adas, Constantino Fern√°ndez Fern√°ndez (better known as Tino), and Yolanda Ventura (daughter of the well-known trumpet player, Rudy Ventura) were the first five kids to be chosen as members of Parch√≠s. Tino was the heartthrob of the group; Gemma was the shy one; Yolanda was every boy's crush; Frank, who joined in 1981 after Oscar left, was the extroverted redhead; and David, a blonde-haired boy, was the best dancer and the life of the party. Parch√≠s' first single, \\"En La Armada\\", was a Spanish version of the Village People's disco hit, \\"In the Navy\\". \\"En La Armada\\" became a major hit in Spain, giving way for a number of important music composers to start working with Parch√≠s. \\"En La Armada\\" was followed by what was arguably the group's biggest hit, \\"Durante la Espera de Parch√≠s\\" (\\"During Parch√≠s' Wait\\"). This song became a number one hit in Argentina. Later on, the group also became successful in Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador and other American countries. Personal problems forced Oscar Ferrer Ca≈àadas out of the band in 1981. He was substituted by Francisco D√≠az Terez, known by fans simply as \\"Frank\\". Brothers Miguel √Ångel G√≥mez Cambronero (born in Germany) and Jes√∫s G√≥mez Cambronero joined the band after Tino and David left the group in 1983. Losing Tino proved lethal to the group, however. With Menudo reaching unprecedented (for a Hispanic children's music group) success levels in Latin America as well as in Spain, and other Latin American groups like Los Chamos and Los Chicos also providing Parch√≠s with the competition, and with Ferrer Ca√±adas' considerable number of fans going, Parch√≠s began to wane. In Spain and Argentina in particular, however, the group remained popular enough to release a 1983 movie, Parch√≠s Entra en Acci√≥n (translated as Parch√≠s Gets Into Action in English), alongside Alberto Fern√°ndez de Rosa. In 1985, Parch√≠s broke up. The group had recorded a number of albums that were successful in Spain and Latin America. More than a decade later, the group would reunite for one television show engagement. On February 10, 2008, Parch√≠s made an appearance on the Mexican television show \\"Muevete\\" It was the first time in 25 years that they were all together on the same stage. They were introduced and sang the song \\"Parch√≠s\\" with everyone in attendance. Tino spoke of a comeback and wanting to sing again. They were interviewed for about one hour and spoke about their romances and adventures during their tour. They announced plans to tour again and come out with a new album. In the opening sequence, they all stood on a colored circle and the curtains came up, but there was a problem with Gemma's circled curtain that didn't come up in time, but she continued to sing. This was the highest viewed program in Mexico for the year so far. = Members = * Constantino \\"Tino\\" Fern√°ndez Fern√°ndez (Born March 25, 1967, in Barcelona, Spain; Member from 1979 to 1983), the red pawn, lead vocalist, and leader of the group. He began a solo career after his time in the group, releasing three albums with little success. He later worked for Artel. During this time, he lost his left arm in a car accident in Murcia. He is currently working as a radio sports commentator in Barcelona and is married with no children. * Yolanda Ventura (Born October 21, 1968, in Barcelona, Spain; Member from 1979 to 1985), the yellow pawn, and daughter of Spanish musician Rudy Ventura. After Parch√≠s, Yolanda began acting in television shows in Spain, before relocating to Mexico where she works exclusively for Televisa. She had a son with her first husband, actor Alejandro Aragon, and is now in a relationship with Odiseo Bichir, another actor. * Gemma Prat Termens (Born October 22, 1968, in Barcelona, Spain; member from 1979 to 1985), the green pawn. She went on to run a kindergarten in Barcelona. She is now working as a clerk and is married with a daughter. * David Mu√±oz Forcada (Born March 23, 1970, in Barcelona, Spain; member from 1979 to 1984), the white die, and the group's dancer. After Parch√≠s, he went to Scotland to study economics and currently works for an advertisement company. He is married and lives in the United States. * √ìscar Ferrer Ca√±adas (Born November 20, 1971, in Barcelona, Spain; member from 1979 to 1981), the blue pawn, and the first band member to leave. He subsequently graduated with a degree in journalism and political science, and now works as a marketing manager in a communication group. He is married. * Francisco \\"Frank\\" D√≠az Terez (Born August 6, 1971, in Barcelona, Spain; member from 1981 to 1985), Oscar's replacement as the blue pawn. Frank already had experience as an advertising model before joining the group. He formed a rock band after leaving Parch√≠s, and is now an entrepreneur, with a wife and daughter. * Jes√∫s \\"Chus\\" G√≥mez Cambronero (Born May 14, 1969, in Madrid, Spain; member from 1983 to 1985), the red pawn, and Tino's replacement as the group's leader. After Parch√≠s, he formed a band called Plat√≥n with his brother Michel. * Miguel \\"Michel\\" √Ångel G√≥mez Cambronero (Born September 8, 1966, in Hamburg, Germany; member from 1984 to 1985), the white die, David's replacement, and the last new member to join. After Parch√≠s, he and his brother Chus formed the group Plat√≥n in 1992.

It features a level advancement system, allowing character attributes to be upgraded as players progress through the game. The setting is very similar to that of Dungeons & Dragons and other medieval fantasy worlds, with familiar monsters such as Orcs, Gnolls, Harpies, Wyverns, Cyclopes, and Minotaurs. The music in this game was composed by Yoko Shimomura. The game was ported to the Super NES and released in 1994. An emulated version of the game was released as part of Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 2 and Capcom Classics Collection: Reloaded. In September 13, 2018, Capcom announced a new compilation called Capcom Beat 'Em Up Bundle with The King of Dragons being one of the seven titles included and released digitally for PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows on September 18, 2018. Gameplay A wizard fighting the Orc King boss in the first level of the game. The game has 16 levels, though many are quite short. King of Dragons features a role-playing video game-like level advancement system. Points scored for killing monsters and picking up gold count towards experience, and the character gains levels at regular intervals. With each level, the character's health bar increases, other attributes such as range improve, and the character also becomes invulnerable for a few seconds. Along the way, different weapon and armor upgrades for each character may also be picked up. King of Dragons features a simple control system that consists of a single attack button, and a jump button. By pressing both buttons, the character unleashes a magical attack that strikes all enemies in screen (its strength varies according to the character used) at the expense of losing energy. The fighter, cleric and dwarf can also use their shield to block certain attacks by tilting the joystick back right before the impact. This is one of the many Capcom games to feature the yashichi power-up item. There are three such power-ups hidden throughout the game, each giving the player an extra continue. The five playable heroes each have their own traits and fighting skills in the game. The Fighter is very good with melee attacks and defense but lacks magical ability. The Dwarf is able to dodge and block attacks, is the most agile character that has decent melee attacks albeit the shortest range and little magic ability. The Elf has good agility and great range with archery but is not physically strong. The Cleric has great defense, decent magic (with the ability to heal his comrades) and melee attacks but bad agility. The Wizard has poor defense but very good magical attacks and quick melee attacks. Ports The game was ported to the Super NES in 1994. This port reduces the number of simultaneous players down to two. The sprites' size were also reduced moderately. It is also possible to assign the magic attack and shield defense to different buttons. The arcade version is part of Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 2, which was released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox in November 2006. This was also in Capcom Classics Collection: Reloaded for the PlayStation Portable.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed The King of Dragons on their October 1, 1991 issue as being the most-successful table arcade unit of the year, outperforming titles such as Street Fighter II: The World Warrior.

History NYAB on its old location at Beebee Island =Establishment 1876-1900= New York Air Brake was established on July 1, 1890 acquiring all of the property and business of Eames Vacuum Brake Company. Eames Vacuume Brake Company had previously been in existence since 1876 manufacturing vacuum brakes. The new company erected ten new buildings on Beebee Island and nearby shores just in time for a booming brake market driven by an 1893 law mandating standardized brakes for all railroad cars. =Expansion and a new plant 1900-1914= In 1902, NYAB bought the Poole Farm in Watertown, NY, and began its move to its present location. The new Works were planned as a model industrial enterprise, providing housing, work, and recreation for 1,000 employees on the grounds. The workers, however, decided that they did not want to live next door to their workplace and the plan was scrapped. In 1903, the new foundry became the first part of the new plant to begin operations. During this period NYAB's main competition was Westinghouse Air Brake Company, which lead the market in locomotive braking sales. Despite Westinghouse's lead, American railroads preferred to have two brake suppliers. James Hill, builder of the Great Northern Railway, and the New York Central Railroad were especially supportive of New York Air Brake's technology. In 1912, NYAB and Westinghouse agreed to share the market, along with research and development. NYAB's 25 percent share of the brake market soared to $3 million per year by 1914. =World War I and The Depression 1915-1940= 155mm shells, one of the many items produced during the WWI period In 1915, NYAB shifted focus of their current manufacturing of vacuum brakes to efforts toward the First World War. Sales grew from $4.7 million in 1915 to $24 million in 1916. By 1918, the company employed 7,000 who were involved in defense manufacturing, including the production of horse-drawn cannons. After World War I, it was decided that a new braking system needed to be developed to provide braking power for the ever growing freight train industry. Engineers at New York Air Brake contributed to the development of what came to be known as the \\"AB\\" brake. During the mid-1930s, at the same time the \\"AB\\" brake was being widely implemented, the pneumatic and electro-pneumatic braking equipment for modern, high-speed locomotives and passenger trains were engineered and produced at the Watertown facilities. A dramatic drop in sales following the end of World War I led New York Air Brake to seek new markets. In 1919, the company built and marketed a \\"Three-Point Truck;\\" an \\"enormous affair, the four wheels alone weighing nearly one ton. The machine had a wheelbase, and an overall length of . It weighed about 8,100 pounds and had a carrying capacity of from three to six tons...\\" It was not a success. In 1925, new management announced another try at the auto industry with the introduction of the Gerlinger hydraulic lumber carrier; an engine, and a cab set high atop a lumber rack. The project faded quickly. thumbNew York Air Brake gauges to control a Rotair Valve Westinghouse Air brake Westinghouse and New York Air Brake began development of a replacement for the venerable \\"K Brake\\" in 1929. The Great Depression slowed, but did not stop, development of the new brake and, in April 1932, New York Air Brake began construction of a 200-car test track, the largest in the world. In 1934, the Association of American Railroads (AAR) voted to adopt the new composite AB brake. Despite the Depression, the company maintained employment for 300 workers, many on a part-time basis. =World War II 1940-1945= In 1945, New York Air Brake again returned to aiding the United States' war effort in World War II. Up until the end of the war, NYAB became a producer of tank hulls for the Sherman tank, anti-aircraft shells, automatic pilots for aircraft, breech mechanisms for guns, hydraulic pumps for fighter aircraft, and other military hardware and had over 5,000 employees contributing to the war effort in the war-torn Europe by the end of 1944. By the end of the Second World War, New York Air Brake had expanded its product line to include hydraulic aircraft pumps. In 1949, the company furthered its market reach with the purchase of the Hydraulic Equipment Company Dudco Products Company. As a result, sales leapt from $18 million in 1950 to more than $45 million in 1957. =General Signal & mass transit 1967-1988= On June 15, 1967, NYAB merged with General Signal Corporation. In 1980, Congress passed the Staggers Act, which deregulated the railroad industry. As a result of the ending of tax breaks for railroad car ownership, new car and brake orders plummeted from 96,000 in 1979 to 5,800 in 1983. In November 1982, the company put into effect a series of workforce cutbacks that enabled NYAB to survive this difficult time. Meantime, in 1972 New York Air Brake's lobbying in Albany, NY landed a trial run with the New York City transit system. The company was allowed to equip one eight car R44 train numbers 368-379, with one spare four car set of brakes each, making it a total of 12 cars equipped with same.. One trouble-free year later, New York Air Brake signed a $25 million contract to provide brake systems and controls for New York transit's entire fleet of 754 R46 subway cars, the beginning of over a decade of providing brakes to commuter lines. By 1990, New York Air Brake had furnished $100 million worth of equipment for more than half of New York City's R62A's, R68's and R110A/R110B subway cars before NYAB's Transit Division was established as the Knorr Brake Company and moved to Westminster, Maryland. = Knorr-Bremse and the modern era 1991-Present = On January 2, 1991, Knorr-Bremse acquired New York Air Brake's rail braking business from General Signal, however, they did not purchase Stratopower, or Dynapower. Knorr-Bremse is a maker of braking systems for rail and truck vehicles. By the end of 1993, NYAB stopped manufacturing the Westinghouse brake in favor of Knorr-Bremse's improved DB-60 air brake featuring poppet valve technology. Consolidation of operations into one building, tax abatements, and state funding kept the company in Watertown. Since its acquisition, NYAB has modernized under Knorr-Bremse creating the most technologically advanced rail brake manufacturing facility in North America. At the end of 2009, NYAB operations included Train Dynamic Systems (TDS) in Irving, Texas, Knorr Brake Limited in Kingston, Ontario, a brake shoe manufacturer, a brake hose manufacturer, and two Service Centers in Little Rock, Arkansas and Riverside (Kansas City) Missouri.

He attended Baltimore Polytechnic Institute (Poly), where he was class president his senior year. He was the captain of Poly's 1926 lacrosse team and played on the football and basketball teams as well. At the age of 18, he performed at the playoffs for the 1928 Olympic games. Turnbull attended Johns Hopkins University, where he played on the 1932 team. He graduated from Hopkins with a bachelor's degree in engineering after only three years. Turnbull was named an All-American each of his 3 years on the Johns Hopkins Blue Jays men's lacrosse team and is widely regarded as one of the best to ever play the game. At Hopkins, Turnbull also played football and helped establish an ice hockey team. He was captain of the U.S. lacrosse team during the 1932 Summer Olympics and remained active in sports as a member of the Mount Washington Lacrosse Club. Four years later, he was a member of the U.S. field hockey team at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, during which he met Adolf Hitler. Turnbull enlisted in the Maryland National Guard as an aviation cadet and was commissioned as a second lieutenant on June 24, 1940. He was mobilized along with the rest of the Maryland National Guard in February 1941, just prior to the U.S. entry into World War II. During the war he quickly rose in rank, and by 1944 he was a lieutenant colonel.

It calls itself \\"Viet Radio\\" and simulcasts its programming with KGOW (1560 AM) in Houston. Owned by Hammond Broadcasting Group, LLC, the KNGO transmitter is located off of South Saint Augustine Road in Dallas. History The station signed on as KGKO in 1952, which played a mixture of pop music and jazz.Broadcasting Yearbook 1967 page B-156 In 1958, KGKO changed its call sign to KBOX, adopting a Top 40 format to compete with Gordon McLendon's top-rated KLIF (1190 AM). The KBOX call sign was chosen because the station was owned by John F. Box. Future WABC disc jockey Dan Ingram was an early voice on KBOX. Within a year, the station, known variously as \\"Wonderful K-Box in Dallas,\\" \\"Big Top Radio\\" and \\"Tiger Radio,\\" had rocketed from the bottom of the ratings to a near-tie with KLIF, and remained highly rated through the coming decade. K-Box was the only radio station covering President John F. Kennedy's motorcade live when he was assassinated on November 22, 1963. (Although KLIF was widely acclaimed for its later coverage of the President's death and the ensuing events, it was not broadcasting live from the motorcade route.) KBOX put an FM station on the air at 100.3 MHz on Christmas Day 1965. KBOX-FM mostly simulcast KBOX. It later aired a beautiful music format as KMEZ-FM and today is KJKK. Group One Broadcasting of Texas acquired KBOX from Balaban Broadcasting in 1967 for $2 million. KBOX had never been able to defeat KLIF in the Top 40 arena, so on January 24, 1967, KBOX flipped to a country music format. The first song played on the new country KBOX was \\"I've Got a Tiger By the Tail\\" by Buck Owens (a nod to the station's former \\"Tiger Radio\\" moniker). KPCN (730 AM) was the first country station in the area, having started in 1962, but it broadcast only during daytime hours. KBOX quickly became the ratings leader for country music in Dallas. In its first ratings book, it moved from a 10.0 share Q3 1966 to a 12.1 share in Q1 1967. KBOX had six years of solid ratings, posting a high of 14.4 in the Q3 1967 book. In 1972, WBAP also flipped to country music, stealing listeners from KBOX. In 1973, the Arbitron markets for Dallas and Fort Worth were combined into one book, to reflect the merging of the two cities into one metropolitan area as the \\"Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex\\". KBOX, broadcasting at 5,000 watts by day and 500 watts at night, was hurt by this redefinition. It was heard well in Dallas but the signal faded before it could reach Fort Worth. KBOX did not even appear in the new ratings book. WBAP, with its clear channel 50,000 watt signal, became the undisputed country winner at that point. In April 1974, Group One applied for a nighttime power increase from 500 watts to 1,000 watts and a move of the transmitter site to 32 52 15 N 96 42 54 W. The Federal Communications Commission approved it in February 1975. This gave KBOX a better signal, although still not approaching that of WBAP. By 1980, FM radio was growing in dominance and the ability of KBOX to compete with a music format was waning. On November 14, 1982, the KBOX call letters were dropped by Group One. KBOX became KMEZ and switched from its country format to a simulcast of the easy listening format of sister station KMEZ-FM. In 1989, KMEZ-AM broke away from the FM station to adopt a business news/talk format as KDBN. This was followed in 1991 by the satellite-fed \\"Stardust\\" adult standards service from the Unistar Radio Network as KCMZ. Marcos A. Rodriguez purchased the station and changed the format to Spanish-language Banda music with call sign KMRT (1993‚Äì1998). Rodriguez picked the call sign to connote the retailer K-Mart and imply good value for advertisers. KMRT was the first radio station in America to air the Banda format all the time. It operated with an automated Audio Server delivery system. Eventually, the call sign changed to KDXX (1998‚Äì2002), and KHCK (1998‚Äì2005), a simulcast of Tejano KHCK-FM \\"Kick FM\\" until the FM changed format to Cumbia music as KFZO and the AM continued as a stand-alone Tejano station for a few months. The KNIT call letters and a southern gospel format were adopted in March 2005, when it was briefly owned by Salem Communications.ESPN Deportes 1480 logo used from 2008-2009 In June 2007, the station joined the Spanish language sports network ESPN Deportes Radio, and it was the first ESPN Deportes station to be managed and operated by ESPN.http://www.hispanicbusiness.com/news/newsbyid.asp?id=69117 1540 KZMP picked up the ESPN Deportes format on June 1, 2009, almost two years after the format was first aired in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. The Deportes format was dropped by 1480 in August 2009. On February 17, 2012, the call letters became KBXD. KBXD, along with co-owned stations Florida stations WFLL, WFTL, and WMEN, were purchased out of bankruptcy by Mark Jorgenson's ACM JCE IV B LLC in a transaction that was consummated on August 6, 2015, at a purchase price of $5.5 million. A proposed sale to Chris Muse for $1.5 million on May 13, 2016, plus a $13,000 payment to break the station's tower lease, was terminated without closing.Station Sales Week of 5/13 - RadioInsight (published May 13, 2016) The transmitting site was acquired from Salem Radio Properties. KBXD switched its format to South Asian pop music. In April 2017 the station suspended all programming and started running a continuous advertisement asking the listener \\"If you are interested in renting this radio station call John Hammond at...\\" By June 2017, the station was playing Hispanic music with station breaks in Spanish. Effective August 11, 2017, ACM sold KBXD to Hammond Broadcasting Group, LLC for $600,000. The call letters were changed to KNGO on May 7, 2019. At that time, it switched to Vietnamese programming, mostly simulcast with KGOW in Houston.

He was the great-grandfather of Israel ben Petahiah Isserlein, who quotes him in his commentary on Rashi to the Pentateuch, section \\"Waye·∏•i.\\" Israel was the author of Haggahot Asheri, notes on Rabbeinu Asher's Talmudic compendium, printed with the text. Gr√§tz identifies Israel of Krems with the Israel whom Emperor Rupert appointed, by a decree of May 3, 1407, chief rabbi of all the German communities (\\"Hochmeister √ºber alle Rabbinen\\"), giving him a certificate declaring him to be a great Talmudic scholar and a good man. But as Israel's functions included the civil control of the Jews, and especially the collection of the taxes, the German rabbis opposed his appointment. Some of them even threatened him with excommunication in case he did not resign. The emperor, upon hearing of this, confirmed Israel's appointment as chief rabbi by a second decree (November 23, 1407), imposing a fine of twenty gold marks on any one refusing to submit to him. But the edicts had little effect, and the office of the chief rabbi became obsolete soon after its creation.
