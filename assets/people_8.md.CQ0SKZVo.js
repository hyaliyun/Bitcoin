It is marked by the twin settlements of Al Ain and Al-Buraimi on the UAE-Omani border.  Etymology and geography  Falaj at Al Ain Oasis, one of a number found in this region Al-Ain is main settlement in the Eastern Region of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, located on the country's eastern border with Oman, where the adjacent town of Al-Buraimi is located. The region is located to the west of the Western Hajar Mountains and the Gulf of Oman, and in the vicinity of the Rub' al-Khali Desert. On the coast of the Arabian or Persian Gulf lies Jumayra in the Emirate of Dubai, which was probably part of this region. The word 'Tawam' means 'twins', and it reportedly refers to a pair of alfaj (water channels) in the Buraimi region, as identified from the works of people like Salil ibn Raziq in the 19th century, Al-Tabari and Al-Muqaddasi in the 10th century, and consequently people in the 21st century like Timothy Power, an archaeologist and assistant-professor based in Abu Dhabi who helped to found the Buraimi Oasis Landscape Archaeology Project. That said, the region is composed of oases which depended on aflaj for irrigation, such as those of Al- Ain and Qattarah in Al-Ain, and Hamasa in Al-Buraimi.  History and prehistory  Archaeological remains dating to the Bronze Age and beyond, like at Al-Rumailah, Hili and Jebel Hafeet, have been found in this region. In ancient times, the region was reportedly used by Arabs as a place of gathering, and like Dibba, it was taxed by Al-Julanda, who were clients of the Sasanians, who reported to the Persian marzban (military governor), who was based at Al-Rustaq in what is now Oman. Like Dibba and present-day Ras Al Khaimah, the region witnessed events relevant to the history of Islam during the Rashidun, Umayyad and Abbasid eras. Around the Islamic Golden Age in the Middle Ages, the region, with its capital at 'Tawam', was an important sphere of influence for Arabs. Ceramics and other materials found here were believed to have been imported from Mesopotamia, India and China. At this time, Sohar, located to the east of this region, was of such prominence as a trading port on the coast of the Gulf of Oman that it was considered to be the \\"Dubai or Singapore of its day\\". A mosque, considered to be the oldest in the country, was found in the vicinity of the Sheikh Khalifa Mosque in Al-Ain by Dr Walid Al Tikriti, besides a falaj, a group of houses, and a village dating to the 9th or 10th century. Being strategically located near the Western Hajar, the area was an important stop for people and caravans traveling between the mountains and other parts of Arabia, such as Al-Hasa. Not only was the area, being rich in date palms, important for trade, but it was also used by certain people for smuggling slaves, women or children, years before the foundation of the UAE.

Localisation  The mosque is located in the \\"Houmet Al Hisar\\" (literally the quarter of the embargo in Arabic), also known as \\"Haret el Sonnaa\\" or the quarter of the workers according to Mahmoud Megdiche. This residential quarter is located in the south-western part of the Medina. It is limited on the south by the main Kasbah's square, on the west by Borj El Ksar street, on the north by Amilcar Street and on the east side by Sidi Abbes street. The neighborhood where the mosque is located is considered one of the most important districts of the medina as it is the closest to the kasbah, which gave it an important economic role. Moreover, most artisans of the medina have been living there for decades.  History  Unfortunately, the history of this monument is not well documented. According to an inscription found at the southern facade of his minaret, it was restored during the reign of the Hafsid prince Abu Omar Othman (1485-1488), proof of its existence in the 15th century. The only second trace on its history is found in the list of religious monuments set by students of the military school of Bardo in 1857. During the 20th century, the Sidi Elyes mosque underwent 3 renovation interventions in 1960, 1969 and 1985. During the works of 1969, columns were brought back from the Zied Palace to strengthen the structure of the mosque. According to popular culture, the name Sidi Elyes comes from the name of a Turkish commander who was buried inside the mosque. But there is no archeological proof of this theory.  Architecture  The mosque consists of a prayer room, a room for the imam and a minaret at the south-eastern corner. It is surrounded by three patios on the east, north and south sides. The main entrance is on the east side that opens onto Sidi Abb√®s Street. It is distinguished by its typical Ottoman style. The door is 3 meters long and 2.5 meters wide. It gives access to the east side patio that runs the full width of the mosque (30 meters). The minaret represents the oldest part of the mosque. It has a square shape with 3 meters at each side and about 14 meters high. It consists of two parts: the base of 10.5 meters, and a hexagonal part of 2.8 meters surmounted by a dome.

They accused the company of dumping mercury in inhabited areas instead of dealing with it as per international norms. \\\\- via Ban.org. Hindustan Unilever admitted its guilt in 2010. Subsequently, Malghan wrote a letter to IIM students urging them to dis-invite Hindustan Unilever during campus placement, which created controversy. =Elitism= Malghan has claimed that social diversity at a workplace can improve accountability and transparency. He accused India's premier business schools of becoming elitist, and not having adequate representation from the underprivileged strata of society. He demanded drastic changes in human resources policies at top management institutes, stating that these institutes have been misusing their autonomy for self aggrandizement. He protested against the extra income paid to IIM professors for official work such as conducting admission interviews. He made several RTI queries to obtain the pay details of top IIM officials. IIM Bangalore issued a censure order to him, directing him to retract his e-mails sent to students. Malghan retracted his statement under protest.

The structure can be considered as methane with all hydrogen atoms replaced by cyanide groups. It was first made by Erwin Mayer in 1969. Properties Tetracyanomethane is a solid at room temperature. It decomposes over 160 ¬∞C without melting, and although it can be in a dilute vapour, no liquid form is known. The molecules of tetracyanomethane have a tetrahedral symmetry (3m or Td). The molecule has C-C distance of 1.484 √Ö and C-N distance of 1.161 √Ö in the gas form. In the solid the C‚â°N bond shortens to 1.147 √Ö. The C-C bond has a force constant of 4.86√ó105 dyn/cm which is slightly greater than the C-Cl bond in carbon tetrachloride, but a fair bit weaker than in the tricyanomethanide ion. At pressures over 7 GPa tetracyanomethane starts to polymerize to form a disorganised covalent network solid. At higher pressure the colour yellows and darkens to black. Over 20 GPa the polymerization is total. The bulk modulus K0 = 4.4 and its derivative K0' = 18. Production Tetracyanomethane can be made by reacting cyanogen chloride with silver tricyanomethanide. :ClCN + AgC(CN)3 ‚Üí C(CN)4 \\\\+ AgCl Reactions In an acid solution in water tetracyanomethane is hydrolysed to yield tricyanomethanide and ammonium ions along with carbon dioxide.

The shaft, illegally excavated, was deep and had a diameter of . To carry out a rescue, it was necessary to drill a parallel conduit of a greater diameter, in an operation in which more than 300 people intervened, plus numerous heavy machinery. The operation received international media coverage. After several setbacks during drilling, on 26 January at 1:25am, Rosell√≥'s body was found between two layers of earth. Disappearance Rosell√≥ disappeared on January 13, 2019 playing while his parents, Jos√© and Vicky, were having a picnic on their cousin's boyfriend's property in Total√°n, Spain. Vicki was in the midst of calling the burger restaurant where she worked to inform them she wouldn't be going in that day. Jose was preparing food and collecting wood when Rosell√≥ ran off. He fell into a 107-metre-deep shaft with a diameter of 25 to 30 cm. The shaft had been drilled in December 2018 by an entrepreneur searching for ground water, without the permission of the authorities. It was not secured afterwards, though the owner said he had covered the hole with rocks. Jose heard him cry and when he reached down not realizing the depth of the hole, sand fell and he no longer heard him cry. Hikers close by heard their screams and quickly called for help. At 1:57 p.m. on January 13, through a call to the emergency center in M√°laga, a woman warned that a young child had fallen through a small hole, in diameter. The ground of the well Rosell√≥ fell in is very unstable and experts determined that any operation had to be done with great care to avoid landslides. A device and a plan to rescue him was set in motion, moving a machine, drilling piles of 75 tons, together with other heavy machinery, to the site to reduce the terrain to excavate a parallel shaft and, once the level where he was believed to be, to excavate a horizontal tunnel by miners of the Central Salvage Brigade Mining of Asturias, specialists in underground rescues. It was necessary to build a special capsule so that the miners could move to the place. Attempted rescue The works of preparation to initiate the rescue were carried out without any inconvenience, but later a series of setbacks arose that extended the work, besides the anguish of relatives and rescuers. Initial attempts to reach Rosell√≥ were unsuccessful due to the shaft being blocked at a depth of . This was discovered when a camera was lowered into the shaft. Rescuers only managed to remove about of rubble before deciding to pursue alternative rescue plans. Construction of the vertical shaft took several days due to the rocky nature of the earth. On January 24, 2019, the vertical shaft was completed and rescuers started excavating the horizontal gallery. Explosives were used as a last resort as rescuers could not break through the rocks using conventional tools. First, the excavation of the parallel tunnel was slower than had been thought at the beginning, since the terrain turned out to be harder than expected and the use of the machines had to be managed in order not to damage them. With the tunnel already built, the second difficulty arose with the jacketing. The pipes that were planned to be introduced inside the well, to ensure this, did not fit, due to discontinuities in the walls of the gallery. This circumstance forced the rescue teams to drill the tunnel again to widen it. The Spanish authorities received offers from dozens of international companies to collaborate in the search, including the Swedish geolocation firm Stockholm Precision Tools AB, which participated in the rescue of the 33 miners trapped for 69 days in the north of Chile in 2010. The rescue operation was carried out in a few days, an engineering task that, usually, would be extended for months. The dimensions of the work were reflected in some figures offered by the government delegate in Andalusia, when he assured that more than 40,000 tons of dirt had been moved and a height equivalent to that of the Giralda in Seville was being excavated. The inventor of the rescue capsule of the Chilean miners offered his help in this rescue. =Recovery= On January 26 at 1:25am local time, rescuers located Rosello's body in the well. Autopsy revealed that he suffered a \\"severe head trauma\\" from the 71-metre fall and presumably died instantly. =Search and rescue team= The Mining Rescue Brigade, which traveled from Asturias, made available to the rescue eight of its best elite miners. The elite brigade has received several awards and distinctions for their work, such as the Gold Medal for Merit in Work (1972), the Silver Medal of the Principality of Asturias (1990) and Silver Medal of the Red Cross (2005). =Uncertainties= One of the biggest questions about the rescue in the well of Total√°n is the origin of the ground plug that hindered access to Rosell√≥. Experts understand that this ground plug comes from the sides of the well and was dragged by his body during his fall, so it could be a landslide. Another theory is that, as it is an abandoned well, it is normal for the lateral walls to fall. Specialists say that it is understandable that the humidity, due to the effects of the rain, will wear away the walls and lose consistency, causing the sand or the surrounding earth to detach inside the pit. Nobody could explain, of the 300 people who worked in Rosell√≥'s rescue, how the plug of dirt was so compact. A series of questions arose that the experts tried to answer. They say that it is unlikely that the plug was formed by the dirt dragged by his fall, given that the type of perforation is supposed to be clean, with no remains of sand or dirt. Another question is how quickly the plug has been compacted, assuring the experts that if it were dry sand, as it seemed to be, it would have taken weeks to form, and in this case it did in the first 24 hours. Even so, one of the certainties that exist is that from where the plug is to the bottom of the well there is a distance of . Legal consequences The High Court of Justice of Andalusia decided to open a lawsuit after a report of the Civil Guard, investigating the circumstances which led to the accident. Independent of the rescue in the interior of the well, the Civil Guard began an investigation to reconstruct the facts, as happens in any other disappearance. A court in M√°laga opened proceedings in the courtroom known as the Julen Case. The Ninth Court of Instruction of M√°laga opened proceedings to know the exact circumstances in which Rosell√≥ fell on the well. The proceedings were initiated after an attestation made by the Civil Guard after taking the parents' declaration of the minor, the owner of the land and the person who dug the well in mid-December of the previous year. Media treatment The accident and subsequent recovery of Rosell√≥ received extensive media coverage by Spanish and foreign media. Referring to coverage on television networks, the event was addressed in both news programs and morning and afternoon magazines that recorded audience records. El programa de Ana Rosa de Telecinco expanded its regular schedule and made special programs. Also S√°lvame, another Spanish program, covered the events of the final hours of the rescue. Media coverage generated various criticisms from other journalists who described it as a \\"media circus\\" and in social networks, accusing various media outlets of encouraging morbidity and sensationalism. The Andalusian Audiovisual Council announced that it would study the media coverage of the case due to a possible violation of the rights of the minor's relatives. =Hoax= On 24 January, the Civil Guard, through its official Twitter account, was forced to deny a hoax that went viral and circulated through social networks, especially WhatsApp, claiming that there was an alternative theory about what happened that the Civil Guard would be investigating and that it had forbidden journalists to bring it to light.

It transpires that the works for the well did not have permission from the Council of Andaluc√≠a and his father, Jose, appears before the media to say that he and his wife, Vicki, keep hope alive. * On 17 January, the rescue teams decided to suspend the construction of a horizontal tunnel due to landslides and hardness of the terrain. The level of the hill was reduced by and the construction of two vertical tunnels was then decided. * On 18 January, the heavy machinery drilled to open a vertical tunnel parallel to the well and they run into a slate rock mass at 18 meters depth, which again complicates the rescue work. * On 23 January, the rescue team reduces the diameter of the pipe intended for vertical drilling. * On 25 January, the miners advance in the final search in the well. The rescue team excavates almost of the that they had to drill to reach the bottom and have to make up to four microblasts to break hard rock (quartzite). * On January 26 at 1:25am, the rescue teams accessed the point of the well where Rosell√≥ was sought and located his body between two layers of earth.

From April 2006 to May 2010 he planned and executed Project 'Sagar Parikrama' which involved constructing a sailboat in India and then sailing it around the world. He was the hundred and ninetieth person to complete the journey solo. Sagar Parikrama The voyage was the first of the Indian Navy's project Sagar Parikrama, initiated by late Vice-Admiral Manohar Prahlad Awati (Retd). Capt. Donde started his circumnavigation from Mumbai on 19 August 2009 and finished on 19 May 2010. During the nine-month-long circumnavigation he stopped at four ports and was at sea for 157 days. Donde volunteered to undertake the project for the Indian Navy in 2006. Over the next four years he built a boat with an Indian boat-builder, trained himself and sailed solo around the world with four stops en route. The vessel INSV Mhadei The boat used in his circumnavigation as part of the Sagar Parikrama project was the Indian Navy Sailing Vessel INSV Mhadei, custom built by the Indian Navy. The 56-foot Van de Stadt 'Tonga' design sloop was built as a wood core epoxy construction by Mr Ratnakar Dandekar at his boat yard Aquarius Shipyard Pvt Ltd on Divar island in Goa by Ratnakar Dandekar. The boat was handed over to the Indian Navy on 12 February 2009 and named after the river Mhadei, the original name of the Mandovi River in Goa. Solo circumnavigation The requirements to qualify for solo circumnavigation include: *Starting and finishing in the same Port *Not passing through any Canals or Straits that would necessitate outside assistance or motoring *Crossing all meridians at least once *Crossing the Equator at least twice *Traversing at least 21,600 NM *Rounding the three great capes viz Cape Leeuwin, Cape Horn and Cape of Good Hope Donde recounts his story in his book, The First Indian: Story of the First Indian Solo Circumnavigation Under Sail. He left Mumbai from the Naval Dockyard on 19 August 2009 at 16:30 after being flagged off by Chief of Naval Staff, Admiral Sureesh Mehta. He crossed, from West to East, the Indian, Pacific, Southern and Atlantic Oceans, covering over 23,000 nautical miles, rounding Cape Leeuwin in Australia, Cape Horn in South America and Cape of Good Hope in Africa. The journey took 273 days and was completed on 19 May 2010. On 22 May 2010, he was given a ceremonial welcome in Mumbai by the then Vice President of India, Mohd Hamid Ansari. Ansari stated, \\"Donde has shown that skill, determination and courage can achieve what is considered to be immensely difficult, if not impossible.\\". Dilip Donde became the first Indian to complete such a journey. Mentor Dilip Donde with the Navika Sagar Parikrama Team Dilip Donde mentored Lt Cdr Abhilash Tomy and headed the shore support team to plan and execute Sagar Parikrama 2, the first solo nonstop circumnavigation by an Indian. He subsequently trained several young naval officers, most recently the all women naval officers team that completed Navika Sagar Parikrama.

The character was introduced as the eldest daughter of Phil Archer and Jill Archer in 1958. Shula has been portrayed by Liverpudlian actress Judy Bennett since 1971. As of 2019, Bennett has played the role for 48 years, making her one of the longest-serving soap opera actors in the world. A devout Christian with a heavy involvement in the Ambridge church and its Parish Council, Shula has been featured in some of the show's most controversial and high-profile storylines including the death of her first husband Mark, an affair with the village doctor, and struggles to having children which ultimately led to a successful IVF treatment. The Archers official website describes Shula as being a \\"pillar of the church\\" whose \\"first love was horses\\" and has a \\"sometimes troubled heart\\". Bennett has been married to co-star Charles Collingwood, who plays Brian Aldridge, since 1975.  Creation and casting  = Characterisation = Before assuming the role of Shula, Judy Bennett was forging a career playing children in some of BBC Radio's most successful children's shows. Her husband, Charles Collingwood, says when the call went out for the casting of 12-year-old Shula Archer, a fellow cast member cried: \\"Judy Bennett - she's so talented - I hate her!\\". While playing the role, Judy would also play the roles of her younger siblings Kenton and Elizabeth, as well as her nephew Adam Macy, until his voice broke. = Marriage to Charles Collingwood = Bennett and Collingwood began working on children's shows together in the early 1970s and became a \\"proper couple\\" in 1974. He credits her for gaining his role the following year as Brian Aldridge. \\"We very seldom work together on The Archers,\\" Bennett says. \\"We're rarely in the same episodes, so often we're ships that pass in the night. I'll go up to Pebble Mill for a morning recording and he'll go up in the afternoon. We don't talk about The Archers that much, because it's only for one week a month and we do other things the rest of the time. But I like having him in the cast, it's the companionship\\".  Development  = Early years = Shula Archer was born into the show on 8 August 1958. Phil and Jill named their children 'Shula' and 'Kenton' by throwing alphabet blocks into the air. Shula would complete her A levels with the hopes of becoming an event rider in 1973. Three years later, Shula realised she would never have the successful riding career she wanted, and decided to backpack across Europe. The official The Archers website said Shula had \\"plenty of boyfriends\\" upon her return, including Neil Carter and Nigel Pargetter. But it was Simon Parker, editor of the Borchester Echo, who won her heart. Everything was going swimmingly until Simon published a photo of Shula on horseback headlined \\"Hunting on the Dole\\". She later lost her virginity to him in a cornfield. In 1978, Shula was dumped by Simon Parker and fled for London, where she found work and began dating her father's former farming student, Nick Wearing. The couple left for an overland hippy backpacking trip. But the holiday did not go to plan, with Nick going onto Australia and Shula landing a job in Bangkok. But she returned to Ambridge after her passport and money was stolen. = Engagement to Mark Hebden = Flighty Shula finally won the acceptance of her parents when she began dating lawyer Mark Hebden (Richard Derrington). The union was going over well until Mark took a swipe at the Borchester bench, labelling Shula's father, Phil Archer, and other magistrates as \\"amateurs\\". Nonetheless, Shula accepted his marriage proposal. Tragedy struck later in 1980 when her grandmother Doris Archer (Gwen Berryman) died peacefully in Glebe Cottage. Shula found Doris, and then made her way over to St Stephen's to tell her Aunt Christine Barford her mother had just died. Doris left Glebe Cottage to Shula in her will, and the 22-year-old began preparing for her impending nuptials. Stressed by the upcoming wedding, Shula found comfort in flirting with another journalist, Robin Catchpole. She remained faithful, but called the wedding off with only six-week to go. Mark moved on with his life, allowing David Archer's ex-girlfriend Jackie Woodstock, to move into his cottage. A livid Shula, angry at the thought of another woman sharing the home she'd planned to set up with Mark, began dating hippie Ben Warner. She dumped him when he was convicted of burglary. In 1983, Mark become engaged to upper-crust Sarah Locke. Shula began dating Nigel Pargetter, a door-to-door swimming pool salesman. Shula would soon break up with Nigel, as Mark would also break off his engagement and move to Hong Kong. But her heart was still with him, and she flew to Hong Kong in 1985. Mark returned with her, and the pair were married in September. Shula would later become manager of The Estate, while Mark took a job at a Birmingham law firm. In 1989, Shula persuaded Mark to invest almost ¬£50,000 in her brother Kenton's antique business. The financial outlay put stress on the marriage, amplified by the fact the couple could not conceive. Shula was eventually diagnosed with endometriosis. She then decided to give up having a baby due to the strain on the marriage. Her sister Elizabeth's abortion in 1992 would be to Shula's horror, given her ordeal in attempting to bear children. = Mark's death = In 1994, Mark was driving home when an out-of- control driver overtook him on a bend, and as he swerved to avoid Caroline Bone's horse, slammed into a tree and was killed instantly. His death was made even more tragic with the news Shula was finally pregnant. Shula organised with the local cricket club to commemorate his death annually with the Single Wicket Competition, with the winner awarded the Mark Hebden Trophy. The next year, Shula reignited her relationship with Simon. While dating Shula, Simon Pemberton was involved with Harriet, an old flame. Before Caroline could tell Shula, Guy died of a heart attack. When Shula defended Simon's actions over the funeral, Caroline spilled the beans. Shula confronted Simon, who lashed out at her. Although the relationship was over, she remained managing the Estate office. Simon hit his then girlfriend Debbie Aldridge (Tamsin Greig), who Shula urged to report to the police. = Marriage to Alistair Lloyd = Shula's began dating the local vet, Alistair Lloyd. All was well until her son Daniel developed juvenile arthritis. Being supported by Dr Richard Locke, Shula started an affair with him. But when she couldn't abandon her beloved Ambridge, Richard departed, making an enemy for Shula of his partner Usha Gupta. Betrayed Alistair nonetheless declared his continuing love on a walk up Lakey Hill. He and Shula were married on Christmas Eve. In 2001, Shula bought Christine's equestrian business. = Alistair's gambling addiction = Alistair developed a gambling addiction in 2003 after joining Nigel and Kenton's poker nights. At the height of the problem, Shula's credit card declined at the supermarket and by February he was in ¬£8,000 worth of gambling debt. Shula discovered he'd been taking money from their joint account to fund his addiction, and borrowed money from David. Scouring gambling addiction websites for answers, Shula got Alistair back on track by being more \\"spontaneous\\" and taking walks and bike rides. They are renovated the house. But the couple would be rocked again when Alistair lost the Brookfield dairy factory contract and began gambling again, this time racking up a total debt of ¬£100,000 ‚Äì ¬£40,000 on credit cards and ¬£60,000 to Matt Crawford. The couple remortgaged the business to pay off the debts and Alistair started attending Gamblers Anonymous meetings. = Divorce and later years = Shula began feeling unhappy in her marriage in 2018 and began undergoing counselling and taking meditation classes to try and repair their union. Exhausting all options, Shula and Alistair then opted to divorce. Alistair returned to gambling, although admitting it was \\"a few quid\\" on the horses.

History  Mendeleev's monument State regulation of weights and measures in Russia was patchy and piecemeal until 29 April 1797, when Tsar Paul I issued a standardization edict aimed primarily at reducing fraud. Institutions for implementing this law followed, with a division overseeing standardisation being added to St Petersburg's Department of City Management, for example, on 19 September 1798. On 11 January 1798, a further law stipulated that State Councillor Gaskonii would supervise the production of official weights at the Aleksandrovskii factory, and these would be the only official measures in the realm. In practice, however, application of these laws was inconsistent.Michael D. Gordin, 'Measure of all the Russias: Metrology and Governance in the Russian Empire', Kritika: Explorations in Russian and Eurasian History, New Series, 4.4 (Fall 2003), 783‚Äì815 (pp. 788‚Äì93). In 1835 (around the same time as the UK's Weights and Measures Act of 1824 and France's 1837 consolidation of its switch to metric), Tsar Nicholas I enacted a new push to standardise weights and measures. The Commission of Exemplary Weights and Measures had been formed in 1827, superseded in 1832‚Äì33 by the Commission for the Introduction of the Unitarity of Russian Weights and Measures. On 4 June 1842, an ancillary protocol to the 1835 act required that copies of the standards set in 1835 be distributed throughout the empire, and to achieve this, the Depot of Exemplary Measures and Weights was founded in Saint Petersburg and placed under the control of the Learned Storekeeper ‚Äì the first person to hold this role was Adolph Kupfer. This standardisation correlated with the introduction of major railway building, and legal reform, making it part of a wider imperial, ideological programme. Kupfer's successor was V. S. Glukhov. It was originally located in the building of the Peter and Paul Fortress in St. Petersburg.Michael D. Gordin, 'Measure of all the Russias: Metrology and Governance in the Russian Empire', Kritika: Explorations in Russian and Eurasian History, New Series, 4.4 (Fall 2003), 783‚Äì815 (pp. 793‚Äì800). In 1892, Dmitri Mendeleev was appointed third scientific custodian of the Depot, a post which he occupied until his death in 1907. On his initiative, in 1893 the organization was transformed into The Chief Bureau of Weights and Measures (the Main Chamber of Weights and Measures). The main goals of the new institution were to unify the many different weights and measures used in the diverse Russian Empire, achieve their regulation in trade and industry, and orchestrate the eventual conversion to the metric system. The introduction of the metric system into Russia for optional use in 1899 and then completely in 1918, is intimately bound with the work of D. I. Mendeleev as director of the Bureau. The Bureau began publishing a scholarly journal, Vremennik Glavnoi Palaty mer i vesov in 1894. Years later, the Research Institute of Metrology and Standardization was established on its basis. In memory of Mendeleev's contribution to the development of metrology, a monument to Mendeleev and his periodic table of elements were placed on the territory of the institute.  Current state  D. I. Mendeleev Institute for Metrology in St. Petersburg in 2013 The Institute is one of the largest world centers of fundamental and applied metrology, the main center of state primary standards of Russia. There are 54 (out of 165) state primary standards (GGE), corresponding to the eight measurement areas of the International Bureau for Weights and Measures (BIPM). Of the seven core units of the International System of Units SI, four are represented at the institute: meter, kilogram, ampere, and kelvin. VNIIM represents the Russian Federation in international metrology organizations and advisory committees of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures. The scientists of the institute head four of the twelve technical committees of the COOMET regional metrology organization. The Institute is a center for training and retraining of metrologists. There is a council for the defense of dissertations for the degrees of candidate of science and doctor of science, postgraduate study is offered.  Metrological museum of Gosstandart of Russia Located in the institute's old building, the museum possesses unique monuments of the history of metrology: Russian and foreign reference measures, balances, measuring instruments, rare archive documents and photos, books of the 18‚Äì20th centuries. The first collections of the museum were formed in 1830 when the system of measures was being developed on a scientific basis in Russia. Now a significant part of the museum exhibits is related to the activities of Mendeleev.

The character first appeared in 1951. The role was played by a variety of actresses, until Angela Piper joined the cast in June 1963. As of 2019, Piper has been on the show for 56 years, making her the fourth longest- running cast member on the show. Jennifer is the daughter of Jack Archer (Denis Falwell) and Peggy Woolley (June Spencer) and the mother of Adam Macy (Andrew Wincott), Debbie Aldridge (Tamsin Greig), Kate Aldridge (Perdita Avery) and Alice Carter (Hollie Chapman). Jennifer has featured in some of the show's most high-profile and controversial storylines, mainly involving her family or her relationship with husband Brian Aldridge (Charles Collingwood). Throughout her almost six-decades on the programme, Jennifer has experienced what some consider the usual ups-and-downs of soap opera characters. During her teenage years in Ambridge, she had a dalliance with the local cowman and later the birth of their son out of wedlock, a divorce, her marriage to wealthy landowner Brian Aldridge, coping with his numerous affairs, the loss of her Home Farm farmstead and many financial woes. Newspaper, The Derbyshire Life, has called Piper one of the \\"most recognisable and distinctive voices in Britain\\", while Piper herself calls Jennifer \\"capable, caring, family- oriented, well-groomed and more intelligent than many are prepared to admit\\". The character's widespread popularity also lead Piper to write Jennifer Aldridge's Cookbook, selling more than 40,000 copies.  Creation and casting  = Characterisation = Various child actors played the role of Jennifer Archer from the show's inception right through to the early 1960s. Angela Piper was aged in her mid-20s when the chance arose to join The Archers in 1963. The actress who was playing the role of Jennifer was leaving to join British medical soap opera Emergency ‚Äì Ward 10. Piper was offered the role, after some years working in Repertory Theatre. \\"It was then on an amazing level, The Archers. The characters were an intrinsic part of everyone‚Äôs home. And there they were, which was really exciting,\\" Piper said in a 2013 interview with the BBC. Piper recalls receiving notes from the directors to make the character more \\"couldn't care less\\" and \\"a bit of a tearaway\\" in those early years.  Character development and impact  = Early years = Jennifer was born on 7 January 1945 to Peggy Perkins and Jack Archer. Despite having a small role in the series through the 1950s, it wasn't until the early 1960s that the \\"rebellious\\" Jennifer moved to the front burner of the show. At 16, Jennifer worried her mother by returning from a ski trip early with a boyfriend called Max. Her father Jack bought a moped to travel home in while she was at teacher training college in Walsall. Her Aunt Laura then appointed a chauffeur, young Roger Patillo. Jennifer began dating him, only to discover his real surname was 'Travers-Macy'. The next year, Jennifer qualified as a teacher and began work at Hollerton Primary School and achieved some success as a writer. = Illegitimate child controversy = Jennifer has evolved from \\"rebellious\\" teenager to a loving member of the Ambridge community over her time on the programme. In 1966, Jennifer abandoned plans to become a teacher and a writer and slept with the local cowman, Paddy Redman, which led to the birth of her son Adam, out of wedlock. Piper recalled the \\"fabulous\\" storyline enabled Jennifer to be the \\"representative of a rebellious generation\\". Shortly before Christmas Day in 1966, Jennifer tells her sister Lilian she is pregnant. At the time, Jennifer turns to Jill Archer (Patricia Greene), who urges her to come clean to her parents. Her grandmother, Doris Archer (Gwen Berryman) tells Jennifer she must immediately marry Paddy upon finding out, and her alcoholic father Jack threatens to throw her out of home. \\"One of my press cuttings says: Jennifer expects ‚Äì by kind permission of the Director General‚Äô.,\\" Piper recalled in a BBC interview. A banner was also held over Waterloo Bridge at the time with the line 'Doris Archer is a prude' scrawled on it. The shockwaves to the birth were so great on the show, the character departed temporarily, but returned - with baby in tow - to face the town. \\"I got a letter written on lined notepaper from an elderly brother and sister living together in Plaistow (in London‚Äôs East End),\\" Piper recalled. \\"They said they were very upset that I (Jennifer) might be thrown out of my home, Peggy being as she is, so they said they would take me in. I thought ‚Äòhow sweet‚Äô and ignored it. But then I got another letter saying the brother had redecorated their front bedroom ready for me to come with the baby. And I thought ‚Äòha ha‚Äô and ignored that one. And then I got a third letter, some time later, saying ‚Äòmy brother has been sitting at Paddington station waiting for the trains coming in from Hollerton Junction.\\" In 2016, The Guardian journalist Susannah Clapp named the storyline of the \\"10 best Archers storylines\\", saying \\"Jennifer once had the waywardness of her daughter Kate, and the romantic spirit of her youngest, Alice\\". = Marriage to Brian Aldridge = In 1974, Jennifer moved in with her aunt, Christine Barford, after separating from Roger after he became a travelling salesman. Fresh from the divorce to her first husband, Roger Travers-Macy, Jennifer met the Sherborne-educated Brian Aldridge at a dinner party hosted by Carol Tregorran. Not long after, the couple wed on 29 May 1976 . The official Archers website says this began \\"Jennifer's ascendance to the social pinnacle of Ambridge\\" and developed the character into \\"the elegant, capable pillar of the community\\". \\"She suddenly latched on to someone who had a fair amount of money,\\" Piper says. \\"I don‚Äôt think it was knowingly done but she assumed the position of a wealthy farmer‚Äôs wife and she‚Äôs grown into that\\". In an interview, Charles Collingwood said Brian was worth \\"millions\\" upon his introduction into the show in 1975 . Jennifer moved into Home Farm and continued to work part-time at Grey Gables. In 1978, Jennifer and Jill opened the Two Jays craft studio within a converted barn at Home Farm. But it was short-lived, closing within months of opening. = Affairs of the heart and the \\"mind\\" = Jennifer was working on a collaborated history of Ambridge with antique expert John Tregorran when the pair had an \\"affair of the mind\\". He wanted it to go further, but Jennifer let him down gently. Jennifer and Brian's marriage would be rocked in 1985, when Brian's affair with Caroline Sterling (Sara Coward) is discovered and Alice Aldridge is the result of the fling. \\"There had been the Caroline Bone thing, and the Mandy Beesborough thing. Up to a point I think she‚Äôs felt quite flattered that her husband can still pull these younger, good looking, stylish women. And of course, she‚Äôs had her moments in the past,\\" Piper says. = Brian's affair with Siobhan Hathaway = Out of all of Brian's affairs, his dalliance with Siobhan Hathaway (Caroline Lennon) was one of the show's most high-profile storylines. Church leaders and newspaper columnists debated the fling, which saw Brian starts up an illicit affair with Hathaway, a much-younger married doctor's wife between 2001-2002. The episodes leading up to Brian's admission to Jennifer were heard by 4.75 million listeners, and more than 6000 people sent emails to the BBC over the so-called \\"hayseed porn\\". Brian and Siobhan's son, Ruairi, was born in 2002, and brought back to The Archers in 2007 upon the death of Siobhan from cancer. Jennifer, deciding to forgive Brian, took pity on his son and welcomed him into her home. \\"Seeing him when Jennifer went out to Ireland. That was the point where she decided she had to take Ruairi on. Even though he was her husband‚Äôs lovechild,\\" Piper says. = Departure from Home Farm = After 40 years of living at Home Farm, Jennifer and Brian were forced to sell the farm house in 2018 to cover the financial fallout from the toxic contamination that leaked from his land. The couple downsized, much to Jennifer's dismay, and moved into Willow Cottage in 2019. The Aldridges got off on the wrong foot with neighbour Kirsty Miller, first by a loud birthday party and then Jennifer accidentally cutting her phone line while trimming a bush. Brian got his court papers in January 2019 and told his wife he would plead 'not guilty' to the charges, and would fight any hefty fine he was handed.

He was a professor at the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). He served as President of the CAS Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter from 1983 to 1987, and was elected an academician of the CAS in 1993. He was awarded the Ho Leung Ho Lee Prize in Technological Sciences in 1999 for his contributions to crystallography, solid-state physics, and materials science. Biography Liang was born in Fuzhou, Fujian, Republic of China, on 28 April 1931, the son of a power plant worker at the Fuzhou Electric Company. He was able to receive an education thanks to a scholarship offered by his father's employer. He entered Fuzhou University in 1951, and two years later transferred to Xiamen University, graduating with a bachelor's degree in physical chemistry in July 1955. He joined the Communist Party of China in June 1954. After studying Russian for a year, in September 1956 he was sent by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) to study in the Soviet Union at the A. A. Baikov Institute of Metallurgy and Material Science of the USSR Academy of Sciences, where he earned an associate doctor degree (equivalent to a Ph.D.) in February 1960. He returned to China in February 1960 and became an assistant professor (researcher) at the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. He was promoted to associate professor in March 1978 and professor in February 1983. From March 1984 to June 1987 he served as President of the Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter in his hometown Fuzhou. He returned to the Institute of Physics afterwards and was elected an academician of the CAS in November 1993. On 19 January 2019, Liang died in Beijing at the age of 87.  Scientific contributions  Liang made important contributions to crystallography, solid-state physics, and materials science. He designed an instrument for measuring the temperature in the instantaneous process of nuclear tests. He discovered that it is barium borate (BBO), not barium-sodium borate as previously thought, that produces the second-harmonic generation (SHG) effect. His discovery paved the way for the successful growth of BBO single crystals. He also made discoveries in technetium- and thallium-based superconductors. Liang published over 280 scientific papers and two monographs. His works have been highly cited. He served as an editor for multiple scientific journals and trained more than 40 doctoral students and eight postdoctoral researchers. He won multiple national scientific prizes including the State Natural Science Award and the State Science and Technology Progress Award. In 1999, he was awarded the Ho Leung Ho Lee Prize in Technological Sciences.

Biology Spiroplasma poulsonii is a maternally transmitted symbiont, meaning it is primarily inherited through the female germ line. This involves the co-option of the fly yolk proteins, which allow the symbiont to enter the developing ovary. In the fly hemolymph, S. poulsonii feeds on lipids as its primary food source. Male-killing The Drosophila melanogaster S. poulsonii strain MSRO kills D. melanogaster eggs fertilized by Y-bearing sperm. Montenegro,H et al. Male‚Äêkilling Spiroplasma naturally infecting Drosophila melanogaster (2005) https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2583.2005.00558.x} This mode of reproductive manipulation benefits the symbiont as the female fly has a greater reproductive output than males. Thus, by increasing the number of daughters the fly mother produces, the symbiont increases its ability to spread through the increased reproductive output of female flies. Male-killing requires the presence of a functional dosage compensation process in its fly host.Veneti, Z et al. A functional dosage compensation complex required for male killing in Drosophila (2005) 10.1126/science.1107182 The genetic basis of this male- killing was discovered in 2018, and the gene named \\"SpAID\\" for \\"Spiroplasma poulsonii AndrocIDin,\\" in line with previous studies that referred to the then-unknown factor as the S. poulsonii androcidin. SpAID takes advantage of host dosage compensation machinery causing DNA damage to the male X chromosome, leading to a failure of the male X chromosome to organize and model its chromatin structure. The discovery of SpAID solved a mystery dating back to the 1950s of how the bacteria targeted male-specific cells. In an interview with the Global Health Institute, Dr. Toshiyuki Harumoto said: \\"To our knowledge, Spaid is the first bacterial effector protein identified to date that affects host cellular machinery in a sex-specific manner...‚Äù Defensive symbiosis A dissected mushroom-feeding Drosophila infected with Howardula nematodes The S. poulsonii strain of Drosophila neotestacea can defend its host from attack by nematodes and parasitic wasps. This defence is important enough that S. poulsonii has spread westward across North America due to the selective pressure imposed by the sterilizing nematode parasite Howardula aoronymphium. The mechanism through which S. poulsonii protects flies from nematodes and parasitic wasps relies on the presence of toxins called ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs), similar to sarcin or ricin. These toxins depurinate a conserved adenine site in eukaryotic 28s ribosomal RNA called the Sarcin-Ricin loop by cleaving the N-glycosidic bond between the rRNA backbone and the adenine, leaving a signature of RIP attack in nematode and wasp RNA. Spiroplasma poulsonii likely avoids damaging its host fly by carrying parasite-specific complements of RIP toxins encoded on bacterial plasmids. This allows genes for RIP toxins to readily move between species by horizontal gene transfer, as D. neotestacea Spiroplasma RIPs are shared by Spiroplasma of other mushroom-feeding flies, such as Megaselia nigra. The S. poulsonii strain of Drosophila melanogaster can also attack parasitoid wasps, but its impact on survival of the host fly itself is variable, and dependent on wasp species and strain.Jones, J.E. & Hurst, G.D.D.

He served with the Royal Fusiliers in the Burma expedition of 1886‚Äì87 and in the Second Boer War of 1899‚Äì1902. During the latter campaign he served on the general staff as an aide-de-camp and then brigade major. McMahon was seriously wounded in action and was subsequently mentioned in dispatches and awarded the Distinguished Service Order. Once recovered he served as Deputy Assistant Adjutant General towards the end of the war. McMahon was appointed chief instructor of the army's School of Musketry in 1905 and sought to improve the infantry's rate of fire. His request for additional machine guns to be allocated to each battalion was rebuffed and he instead worked on increasing the rate of fire from the riflemen. He implemented rapid-fire training on the Lee‚ÄìEnfield rifle with each soldier being expected to achieve 15 aimed shots within a minute. This later proved very effective during the opening stages of the First World War. McMahon was promoted to brigadier- general in the first months of the war and was due to take over command of the 10th Infantry Brigade shortly before he was killed by shell fire.  Early life and career  Norman Reginald McMahon was born on 24 January 1866 and was the youngest son of General Sir Thomas Westropp McMahon, 3rd Baronet. McMahon attended Eton College and the Royal Military College Sandhurst from which he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment) on 23 May 1885. He served on the Burma expedition of 1886‚Äì87 and was appointed adjutant on 28 February 1890. He relinquished his appointment after two years and was promoted to captain on 27 November 1896. McMahon served during the Second Boer War and on 9 October 1899 was seconded to the general staff for service as an aide-de-camp (ADC) to an infantry major-general. He was present at the 11 October Relief of Ladysmith and the 15 December Battle of Colenso. McMahon held the position of ADC until appointed as brigade major of the 6th Infantry Brigade on 29 April 1900. He served in operations in the Orange River Colony and was seriously wounded in action during operations in the Tugela Heights. He was mentioned in dispatches for his service by General Redvers Buller on 30 March 1900. McMahon was invalided due to his injury and as a result his appointment as brigade major ended on 6 May 1900. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order on 29 November 1900 and was promoted to the rank of major on 28 November 1901. McMahon returned to service later in the war and held the appointment of Deputy Assistant Adjutant General from February to June 1902.  School of musketry  McMahon was appointed to the staff again in June 1905 when he was appointed chief instructor at the army's School of Musketry in Hythe, Kent. As chief instructor in 1907 he foresaw the future of warfare and recommended that each infantry battalion be allocated 6 machine guns. This recommendation was rejected and he instead instituted reforms of rifle training. Under McMahon all infantrymen were required to be able to fire 15 aimed shots in a minute, a practice that was enshrined in the Musketry Regulations of 1909. This became known as the \\"mad minute\\" and proved highly effective during the August 1914 Battle of Mons. it is said that German soldiers coming up against such rapid fire presumed that they were facing a battery of machine guns. McMahon relinquished his appointment as chief instructor on 9 June 1909 and thereafter served at the army headquarters until January 1910. He passed the staff officer's course at the Staff College, Camberley in December 1910 and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel on 3 May 1911.  First World War  After the outbreak of the First World War McMahon served with the Royal Fusiliers on the Western Front and was mentioned in dispatches on 8 October 1914 by Field Marshal John French for his actions during the First Battle of the Aisne. On 23 October he was appointed a 1st grade staff officer and on 5 November was promoted to the temporary rank of brigadier-general. It was intended that he command the 10th Infantry Brigade. At the request of General Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien McMahon was retained in command of a battalion of the Royal Fusiliers until a suitable replacement could be found. A replacement was found and McMahon was to take command of his brigade on 12 November. On 11 November 1914 his battalion was fighting in the First Battle of Ypres. They were holding a position east of Hooge and just south of the main Ypres-Menin road. After a period of heavy shelling an attack by the 15th Battalion of the German Imperial Guard drove back McMahon's men, though a counter assault in conjunction with men of the Royal Scots Fusiliers and the Royal Sussex Regiment recovered the position. McMahon was rallying a group of recently arrived battalion support staff when he was hit in the leg. Whilst kneeling to attend to his injury a shell burst nearby, killing him. McMahon has no known grave and is commemorated on the Ploegsteert Memorial to the Missing in Belgium. He was mentioned in dispatches again by French after his death on 14 January 1915 for service during the Battle of Armenti√®res. At the time of his death he was a member of the British Numismatic Society.

She was the daughter of ≈ûehzade Mehmed Seyfeddin, son of Sultan Abdulaziz. Early life Gevheri Sultan was born on 30 November 1904 in √áamlƒ±ca Palace. Her father was ≈ûehzade Mehmed Seyfeddin, and her mother was Nervaliter Hanƒ±m. She was the third child, and only daughter born to her father and the second child of her mother. She had a twin brother, ≈ûehzade Ahmed Tevhid. She also had an elder full brother, ≈ûehzade Mahmud ≈ûevket, one year older than her. She was the granddaughter of Sultan Abdulaziz and Gevheri Kadƒ±n. Gevheri used to attend her father's musical lessons during her childhood, she took tanbur and kemence lessons from Tanb√ªri Cemil Bey. Exile and marriage At the exile of the imperial family in March 1924, Gevheri and her family moved to Nice, France, where they settled in a villa at Cimiez, her father died in 1927. After her father's death, her family was scattered here and there. She was still living there and was striving to make ends meet. Abdulmejid II, her uncle who was also living in Nice, brought her to his home when he heard of her financial difficulties with the intention of marrying her. Gevheri lived with her uncle's family for a few years, then became engaged to the son of a minor raja from India, but a short time before her wedding it was discovered that she was having an affair with someone else, so the engagement was canceled. Her uncle was so angry that he send her to stay with her mother, who barely had anything to live on. In 1930, she married Prince Ahmed of Egypt, and moved to Cairo, Egypt. She was widowed at his death in 1948. As musician Gevheri Sultan learned to play several instruments from her father. Among these were the oud (a lyre), the tanbur (a guitar-like instrument), and the lavta (an ancient lute). She played the tanbur, kemen√ße, ud, lavta and piano. She composed vocal and instrumental pieces in various makams. Though she did not continue her studies of Turkish music until her return to her country, she became very skilled on the tanbur in later life. Her work is preserved in recordings made by Turkish radio and TV. Her father Mehmed Seyfeddin was known as great composer after Selim III. He was a great composer. He used to play piano, fiddle, drums and composed them with a good tune. Her half-brother Mehmed Abdulaziz, and brothers ≈ûehzade Mahmud ≈ûevket and ≈ûehzade Ahmed Tevhid were master drummers. Later years and death The grave of Gevheri Sultan in Mahmud II Mausoleum In 1952, Gevheri returned to Istanbul after the revocation of the law of exile for princesses.

The character was introduced in February 1973 by producer Tony Shryane and has gone from a na√Øve teenager to a pillar of the local community. He has remained on the show for 46 years, making Hewlett one of the longest- serving soap opera actors in the world. Neil is the husband of Susan Carter, and father to Emma Grundy and Christopher Carter. He is also the grandfather of George and Keira Grundy. He has been involved in many storylines, mainly centred around his job as a pig farmer and his family, including being elected to the parish council and the imprisonment of his wife Susan in 1993 for harbouring her criminal brother, Clive. Hewlett says the character has many \\"laudable qualities which make him a decent person to know\\" while the official Archers website describes him as \\"down-to-earth\\" and \\"unpretentious\\".  Creation and casting  = Characterisation = Brian Hewlett was starring in a stage performance in 1966 with Bob Arnold, who played Tom Forrest on The Archers. Bob made a casting suggestion years later to the show's producer, Tony Shryane, about enlisting Brian for the role. Shryane told Hewlett after his first recording that \\"we might write Neil in for a few episodes\\". \\"Neil came in as a teenager, an apprentice at Brookfield Farm,\\" Hewlett says. \\"I was older but I was playing the role of teenagers in radio at the time. Tony said I could pick any Midlands accent I liked, so it really was open.\\" Hewlett remembers the character being \\"nervous\\" about being around animals, and how Neil made some \\"ghastly errors\\" on his first day on the job.  Development  = Arrival in Ambridge = Hewlett recalls how the character first, under the guidance of Dan Archer, was shown the ropes on the field. In one broadcast, Neil \\"ploughed up a field of wheat thinking it was grass\\" and left the farm gate open. \\"He had his troubles,\\" Hewlett recalls. \\"He had a fair number of girlfriends and even a drugs problem. It wasn‚Äôt that he was taking drugs ‚Äì they were planted on him. So he went through a sticky period. He wasn‚Äôt ever a tearaway, though. He was always fairly well behaved, or tried to be.\\" The storyline involved Neil's then-girlfriend, Sandy Miller, planting cannabis on him. Neil was sentenced to community service, and Phil Archer gave him another chance after Neil failed his farm proficiency test. In 1976, he dated Shula Archer briefly, but she dumped him for newspaper journalist Simon Parker. = Leptospirosis = Early on in his time in Ambridge, Neil suffered from Leptospirosis, a disease contracted through rats. Hewlett recalls Neil was in hospital and \\"very close to losing his life\\". \\"Like all good dramas, we carried it through to the point ‚Äìis he going to live, is he going to die? I lived ‚Äì thank you (laughs), so that was quite interesting to play.\\" = Courting Susan Horrobin = A young Susan Horrobin won a pig as a prize and sought out Neil for advice on how to care for it. When the pig, named Pinky, escaped and Neil helped rescue him much to Susan's delight. Hewlett says this was the start of a \\"tentative relationship\\" between the pair. \\" I think she was quite keen on Neil, so she made a big play for him. Up until then, dear old Jethro was trying to get Neil interested in his daughter Clarrie,\\" Hewlett says. The pair wed after a trip to London in 1985, and Susan later gave birth to a daughter, Emma. = Susan's imprisonment = In 1993, Susan was sentenced to six-months behind bars for perverting the course of justice when she harboured her criminal brother, Clive. During this time, Neil was a food rep and while Susan was in prison, he felt the temptation of a lonely farmer's wife. \\"There was a great temptation there, with Neil feeling down and lonely at the time. But he managed to keep his sanity,\\" Hewlett recalls.

He had a military background,Matthew Worley, Oswald Mosley and the New Party (Palgrave Macmillan, 2010) serving in a Scottish regiment from 1914 to 1918. British Union of Fascists Diston had been involved with the Independent Labour Party (ILP), becoming a treasurer of its London and Southern Counties Division.N. Copsey, 'Opposition to the new party: an incipient anti-fascism or a defence against 'Mosleyitis'?' (2009) in Contemporary British History 23 (4) Later, however, he became involved with Oswald Mosley's New Party, running in the 1931 general election as the party's prospective parliamentary candidate for Wandsworth Central. He received 424 votes (a 1.6% share). That same year, he wrote literature for the New Party, including The Sleeping Sickness of the Labour Party (1931) and, with Robert Forgan (one of the organisers of the January Club), The New Party and the ILP (1931) (written as an appeal to ILP members).Robert Benewick, Political Violence & Public Order: A Study of British Fascism (Allen Lane, 1969) He was also part of Mosley's British Union of Fascists (BUF),P. M. Coupland, 'Left- Wing Fascism' in Theory and Practice' in N. Copsey and D. Renton (eds), British Fascism, the Labour Movement and the State (Palgrave Macmillan, 2005) holding 'a high position in the Publicity Department'.Ellen Wilkinson and Edward Conze, Why Fascism? (London: Selwyn and Blount, c. 1934) Churchill's ghostwriter In 1934, Churchill already had a number of newspaper and magazine writing commitments ‚Äì Collier's, the News of the World, the Daily Mail ‚Äì to which was added a regular column in the Sunday Dispatch.David Lough, No More Champagne: Churchill and his Money (London: Head of Zeus, 2015) The editor of the newspaper, William Blackwood, wanted rights to Churchill's older material, which would be reworked by one of the Dispatch journalists, Adam Marshall Diston. Churchill was to produce one new piece out of every four published by the paper. Later in the year, due to increased demands on him, Churchill asked William Blackwood to prepare an outline for his next column, to which Blackwood responded with a complete article, ghostwritten by Diston, which went to print without the need for changes. Blackwood told Churchill that Diston was a 'splendid journalist' and recommended him to be Churchill's full-time ghostwriter, should Churchill be interested in one. Churchill took Diston into employment two weeks later, which was 'the start of a partnership that would flourish for the rest of the decade'. As Churchill's employee, Diston started on Churchill's remaining Collier's articles for the year, being paid ¬£15 from the ¬£350 commission Churchill received for each article. By the end of the following year (1935), Diston had already prepared most of Churchill's 'The Great Men I Have Known' series for the News of the World in Britain and Collier's in the USA, due to appear from January 1936. Sir Emsley Carr, the British newspaper's chairman, enjoyed them so much he immediately signed up Churchill for a series in 1937. William Chenery, however, demanded changes to the articles on 'Rockefeller' and 'Charles Chaplin' for Collier's because he considered them 'written in a form better calculated to meet the requirements of English than American mass magazines'. In November 1937 Churchill sent eight articles to the News of the World for serial publication the following year ‚Äì these, too, were largely written by Diston. In a letter accompanying the articles, Churchill hinted to Colonel Percy Davies, the newspaper's general manager, that he wanted to secure a new contract for 1938, which he received. Churchill had little input on a number of articles ghostwritten by Diston.Frederick Woods, Artillery of Words: The Writings of Sir Winston Churchill (London: Leo Copper, 1992) When reworking older pieces, Diston would add original material: for example, when reworking an article on French, in the manuscript's first three pages only one paragraph was from Churchill's original article. Diston made insertions like this at his own discretion, informing Churchill after completing the writing. Indeed, a number of Churchill's articles were written in their entirety by Diston.Martin Gilbert, Winston S. Churchill: The Prophet of Truth, 1922‚Äì1939 (Rosetta Books, 2015) Churchill would also give guidelines to Diston on what to include in articles and leave Diston to produce the piece. In one letter to Diston dated 10 October 1937, Churchill wrote: \\"I hope you find my notes on the amusement article a help. Do not let them cramp your style or feel any obligation to use them.\\" Churchill liked Diston's writing: in a letter dated 26 October 1935 from Violet Pearman, Churchill's chief secretary, Pearman informs Diston: > 'I am asked by Mr Churchill to send you herewith the article on Lloyd > George. Mr Churchill says that this is the one he likes the least, as the > fitting in of the reviews does not hang at all well with your own material. > Would you therefore please put in much more of your own composition, as it > is so good'. Also in 1937, Churchill was commissioned to write an article for the American magazine Liberty on the so-called Jewish problem.Michael J Cohen, Britain's Moment in Palestine: Retrospect and Perspectives, 1917‚Äì1948 (Routledge, 2014) Diston probably ghostwrote the article for Churchill, for which Churchill paid him in full. Churchill made some handwritten marks on the draft and the article was sent for typing without correction. The article repeated the popular idea that Jews brought antisemitism on themselves by remaining distanced and separate from the rest of society,Tom Heyden, 'The 10 greatest controversies of Winston Churchill's career' (25/01/15) on BBC News and it repeated offensive stereotypes of Shylock and his \\"pound of flesh\\", Jewish usurers, and \\"Hebrew bloodsuckers\\". In part, the article, entitled 'How the Jews can Combat Persecution', said: > The Jew in England is a representative of his race. Every Jewish money- > lender recalls Shylock and the idea of the Jews as usurers. And you cannot > reasonably expect a struggling clerk or shopkeeper, paying forty or fifty > per cent interest on borrowed money to a \\"Hebrew bloodsucker\\" to reflect > that, throughout long centuries, almost every other way of life was closed > to the Jewish people; or that there are native English moneylenders who > insist, just as implacably, upon their \\"pound of flesh\\". In the end the article was not published, despite Churchill's repeated efforts to sell it. Collier's, to whom Churchill was already contracted to write for, objected to one of Churchill's article potentially appearing in Liberty, a rival US publication, so it was withdrawn from its original outlet. Following this, Churchill tried to have the article published in the British Strand Magazine, but it had already recently run a similar article by former Prime Minister David Lloyd George and declined.Chris Hastings, 'Churchill kept ghettoes warning under wraps' (11/03/07) in The Daily Telegraph According to Richard Toye, based on this string of events, 'Churchill was entirely happy to put the article out in his own name and thus take responsibility for the views it expressed'.Richard Toye, letter to the editor (17/03/07) in The Times In 1940 Charles Eade, Sunday Dispatch editor, who was republishing some of Churchill's older journalism, came across the article and approached Churchill on 7 March about publishing it, saying, 'I see no reason why Mr Churchill should not agree to [the article being printed in the Sunday Dispatch], but the question of Jews is a rather provocative one, and I thought I should ask his permission before going ahead with this particular contribution'. Churchill declined the offer, his office writing to the newspaper that it would be 'inadvisable to publish the article 'How the Jews can combat Persecution' at the present time'.Richard Toye, Lloyd George and Churchill: Rivals for Greatness (London: Pan Books, 2007) References Category:1893 births Category:1956 deaths Category:Antisemitism in the United Kingdom Category:English journalists Category:English political journalists Category:Journalists from London Category:English male journalists Category:Ghostwriters Category:British fascists ","title":"Adam Marshall Diston"},{"id":"59720655","text":"Asaccus gardneri is a species of lizard in the family Phyllodactylidae.

Ali Ahmad Khan Luynab (1883‚Äì1929) was an Afghan politician from the Barakzai tribe, and was for a few weeks a possibly self-proclaimed emir in eastern Afghanistan in January and February 1929. Born in 1883 in Mashhad, Iran, he played a leading role in negotiating the controversial Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919 which ended the Third Anglo-Afghan War, and later rallied the Khogyani and Shinwari to quell the Khost rebellion. He also served as high commissioner of the Eastern and Southern provinces. During the Afghan civil war of 1928‚Äì29, Ali was ordered to quell a Shinwari revolt, which he duly ended in December 1928. Later, after Inayatullah Khan surrendered control of Kabul to HabibullƒÅh KalakƒÅni on 17 January 1929, he created a rival government centered on Jalalabad. However, Ali's reign would prove short-lived: Malik Qays of the Khugyani tribe, who had initially allied himself with Ali, defected to Kalakani, captured Ali and brought Ali to Kalakani in exchange for 17,000 rupees and the rank of lieutenant general, ending Ali's reign on 9 February. Ali later managed to escape from imprisonment and sought refuge in Kandahar with his sons Ghulam and Nur. On 3 June or 31 May 1929, Kandahar fell to forces loyal to HabibullƒÅh KalakƒÅni, and the former emir was found in the home of a Hazarah. His son Nur was killed on the spot, while Ali himself was arrested and sent to Kabul along with Abd al-Shakur Khan (The Chief of Justice), Sad al-Din Khan (Abd al-Shakur Khan's son), Abd al-Wasi, and a Mufti.

Three years later at the age of 18, he became a stone-cutter. Between two marriages, Gordon had five children. Gordon and his family were actively involved in Barre's Scottish community. He first ran for mayor in 1912 and nearly won, except the city's Central Labor Union endorsed James Mutch, who was an independent and member of the influential Granite Cutters' International Association. Both Mutch and Gordon lost and Board of Trade chairman Lucius Thurston was elected mayor. Gordon was eventually elected mayor in 1916 alongside one other fellow Socialist. However, a conservative majority was elected to the Board of Alderman; Gordon's employer was elected chair of the board. After one term in office, in his policies were highly contested, Gordon retired from politics. Fellow Socialist Fred W. Suitor lost his bid to replace Gordon. Like other stone-cutters, Gordon suffered from ill-health and died of tuberculosis at the age of 56 at a Lynn, Massachusetts sanitarium. In 1929, Suitor won the mayorship and became the second Socialist mayor of the city.

As the \\"Centaur from the North\\" he was considered a threat to property and order on both sides of the border, feared, and revered, as a modern Robin Hood. In Mariano Azuela's novel The Underdogs, anti-federal soldiers talk about him as an archetype of an anti-authoritarian bandit: \\"Villa, indomitable lord of the sierra, the eternal victim of all governments... Villa tracked, hunted down like a wild beast... Villa the reincarnation of the old legend; Villa as Providence, the bandit, that passes through the world armed with the blazing torch of an ideal: to rob the rich and give to the poor. It was the poor who built up and imposed a legend about him which Time itself was to increase and embellish as a shining example from generation to generation.\\" However, a little later, one character distrusts the rumors: \\"Anastasio Monta√±√©z questioned the speaker more particularly. It was not long before he realized that all this high praise was hearsay and that not a single man in Natera's army had ever laid eyes on Villa.\\" Whatever the reality behind the legends, even after his defeat Villa remained a powerful character still lurking in the Mexican mind. In 1950 Octavio Paz wrote, in his morose but thoughtful book on the Mexican soul The Labyrinth of Solitude, \\"The brutality and uncouthness of many of the revolutionary leaders has not prevented them from becoming popular myths. Villa still gallops through the north, in songs and ballads; Zapata dies at every popular fair... It is the Revolution, the magical word, the word that is going to change everything, that is going to bring us immense delight and a quick death.\\" Pancho Villa remains a controversial figure in the United States. USA Today reported, \\"A terrorist in 1916, a tourist attraction in 2011. ... On Jan. 8, 1916, 18 U.S. businessmen were massacred by Villa's men in a train robbery in northern Mexico. It was not the first or last of Villa's atrocities; he personally shot a priest who begged for clemency for his villagers, as well as a woman who blamed him for her husband's death.\\" In films, video, and television Villa appeared as himself in the films Life of Villa (1912), Barbarous Mexico (1913), With General Pancho Villa in Mexico (1913), The Life of General Villa (1914) and Following the Flag in Mexico (1916). Films based on Pancho Villa have appeared since the early years of the Revolution and have continued to be made into the twenty-first century. Hollywood's role in the shaping of the image of Villa, the Mexican Revolution, and U.S. public opinion has been the subject of a scholarly study.Margarita de Orellana, Filming Pancho Villa: How Hollywood Shaped the Mexican Revolution: North American Cinema and Mexico, 1911‚Äì1917.

While the NPK factory units are spread in three cities (Bontang, Semarang, and Surabaya), including the production of organic fertilizer (called zeorganic) which is spread in five regions (Demak, Banyuwangi, Parepare, Badung, and East Lombok). Assets in 2016 reached Rp29,390 trillion.  History  = Establsihment and early history = In 1977, an offshore fertilizer project was started on two ships owned by Pertamina, the largest Indonesian oil producer, which later became the beginning of the establishment of PT Pupuk Kalimantan Timur. The success of the project finally began the establishment of a factory covering an area of 493 ha (hectares) which was once a very dense forest area on the hillsides of the forests of East Kalimantan. Precisely on December 7, 1977, PKT was officially established. The main raw material for the plant in Bontang is natural gas which is piped from Muara Badak, about 60 km from the factory location. Initially the Pupuk Kaltim project was managed by Pertamina with floating fertilizer factory facilities or a factory on board. Because of some technical considerations according to Presidential Decree No.43 of 1975 the project location was transferred to land, and through Presidential Decree 39 of 1976 the management was handed over from Pertamina to the Ministry of Industry. In 1979 the construction of the Kaltim-1 plant began and the commercial operation period was first started in 1987. The Kaltim-2 plant was built in early 1982 and completed 3 months ahead of the stipulated schedule and succeeded in achieving commercial operations faster than East Kalimantan. -1, namely in 1984. The Kaltim-1 plant and Kaltim-2 factory were inaugurated by President Soeharto on October 28, 1984. The Kaltim-3 plant was built in 1986 and was inaugurated on April 4, 1989. In addition, a unit for making urea formaldehyde (UFC-85) with a capacity of 13,000 tons per year was built to improve the quality of urea fertilizer produced. = Development since 1990 = On November 20, 1996 an IV urea unit (POPKA) was built which aims to increase added value for residual Ammonia (Ammonia excess) and CO2 gas which is wasted into the atmosphere to produce granular urea products. The factory with a projected production capacity of 570,000 tons per year was completed on April 12, 1999. The investment value for the construction of the POPKA factory was USD 44 million and Rp 139 billion. The Kaltim 4 factory was built in 1999 with a projected capacity of 570,000 tons of urea granule and 330,000 tons of ammonia per year. Construction of the urea plant was completed in mid-2002, while the ammonia plant was completed in early 2003. In 2007, Pupuk Kaltim made the NPK factory fuse blending in Bontang to produce NPK with phosphates imported from Morocco. The Kaltim 5 plant, which is planned to have a capacity of 1.2 million tons of urea per year, will soon be realized by the Kaltim-5 Factory PKT which will replace the existence of the Kaltim-1 factory unit which is likely to be closed because it is old and inefficient. To support Kaltim-5 operations, Pupuk Kaltim will also build an ammonia plant with a capacity of around 600,000 tons per year. At present Pupuk Kaltim has five Urea fertilizer plants with a total capacity of 2.98 million tons of urea per year and four Ammonia plants with a total capacity of 1.85 million tons of Ammonia per year. While NPK fertilizer production is as much as 350,000 tons per year with factories in three cities, namely: Bontang, Semarang and Surabaya. Aerial of Pupuk Kaltim Complex  Products  The products produced by Pupuk Kaltim are as follows: * Urea : A compound that is soluble in water, CO (NH3) 2, with most of it is nitrogen content which is the main component of urine of mammals and other organisms such as fungi, as the end result of protein metabolism. Urea fertilizer is produced and prepared in bulk and granules. * Ammonia : A chemical compound formed from two gases, nitrogen and hydrogen with NH3 chemical formula. Ammonia is used as a raw material in urea production. * NPK Pelangi: : NPK Pelangi is a new product intended to improve the welfare of farmers. This fertilizer has advantages such as increasing yield of more than 40%, easily stocked and directly seeped, the stem is stronger and resistant to fall, suitable for all types of plants, the soil becomes more fertile, nutrient available complete and balanced, made of quality materials, and safe for environment. NPK Pelangi is divided into 4, including: NPK Pelangi MAXI, NPK Pelangi UNGGUL, NPK Pelangi PRIMA, and NPK Pelangi SUPER. * Zeorganik: : Organic fertilizers from Pupuk Kaltim contain components of C-organic ingredients that function to increase soil fertility, also contain non-organic minerals that function to increase Cation Exchange Capacity (kTk) of land, so as to increase the efficiency of non-organic fertilizer use while reducing the rate of evaporation of water from the soil.  Units of Production  = Units = * Kaltim 1 : Production capacity: ammonia: 595,000 tons / year, urea: 700,000 tons / year * Kaltim 2 : Production capacity: ammonia: 595,000 tons / year, urea: 570,000 tons / year * Kaltim 3 : Production capacity: ammonia: 330,000 tons / year, urea: 570,000 tons / year * Kaltim 4 : Production capacity: ammonia: 330,000 tons / year, urea: 570,000 tons / year * Kaltim 1A (POPKA and ex KPA) : Production Capacity: ammonia: 660,000 tons / year, urea: 570,000 tons / year * Kaltim 5 (under project) : Production Capacity: ammonia: 850,000 tons / year, urea: 1,150,000 tons / year * NPK : Production capacity: 350,000 tons / year * Organic fertilizer = Total production = Ammonia: 2,510,000 tons / year Urea: 2,980,000 tons / year NPK: 350,000 tons / year  Accreditations, Awards and Certifications  = Awards = Some of the national awards Pupuk Kaltim received in 1999 were: * 1994 - Highest Ammonia Production MW Kellog Process License in the World for the Kaltim-2 ammonia factory from MW Kellog Company. * 1995 - Top Score on Stream Day for the production of the Kaltim-3 ammonia factory, from Haldor Topsoe. * 1996 - The Highest Safety Sword of Honor for Occupational Health and Safety from the British Safety Council. * 1997 - National Sports Award from the Vice President of the Republic of Indonesia, for the success in sports coaching on Sports Day on September 9, 1997. * 1997 - Primaniyarta Award from the President of the Republic of Indonesia for the company's success in export realization, on September 25, 1997. * 1999 - Satyalancana Pembangunan (Award of Loyalty Symbol for Development) from the President of the Republic of Indonesia, on August 17, 1999 * 1999 - Award from the Governor of East Kalimantan for the success in realizing the Out-of-School Education Program, on July 22, 1999. * 1999 - Award from the Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture for the success in fostering traditional batik weaving on 31 July 1999 * 1999 - Award from the President of the Republic of Indonesia for the success of coaching in the field of Community Education on International Literacy Day, 2 September 1999. * 2002 - The Best BUMN on Community Development Program Award for the community development program from BUMN Review. * 2002 - Yasa Ayodhya Adinugraha as a PMDN company with high achievement by the Investment Coordinating Board. * 2004 - Gold Flag for Occupational Health and Safety Management System during 2003 for large industrial classes from the Ministry of Manpower received on 12 January 2004. = Accreditations = Pupuk Kaltim has also received several international awards as follows: * The National Testing Association Authority (NATA) of Australia, which was awarded to the Center for Factory Equipment Industry owned by Pupuk Kaltim.

The victims were identified as grocery store owner Mohammad Khalil, his wife Nabila, their 13-year-old daughter Areeba and their friend who was driving the car, Zeeshan Javed. Their son Umair Khalil sustained bullet wounds while his sister Muniba's hand also sustained gunshot-related injuries and Hadia, their younger sister remained unhurt. The police first claimed that they were kidnappers who were kidnapping the children, they told the story to people at a petrol pump where they left the children of the victims. After video of the Khalil's son surfaced where he claimed that the deceased in the encounter were his parents, the story took a turn and the CTD changed its stance, declaring only the driver named Zeeshan as terrorist affiliated with ISIS. According to initial press releases, CTD claimed that on intelligence report an anti-terrorism operation was conducted. During this raid, four people were killed by their own collaborators and three terrorists managed to flee. However, eyewitness reports and statements of survivors negated the version of CTD.  Surviving children‚Äôs stance  Surviving children stance was the reason of highlighting this brutal incident on social media. Khalil's son Umair Khalil, said the incident took place when they were on their way to attend the wedding ceremony of his uncle Rizwan in Burewala. He said they were travelling from Tariqabad (Kot Lakhpat) area of Lahore, to Burewala (Sahiwal) when the police opened fire on their vehicle. My father had asked the law-enforcers to check their vehicle and told them that there were no weapons. However, the police did not pay any heed and opened fire, killing his parents on-the-spot. He further added ‚Äú ‚ÄúWe survived the firing. We were taken to a petrol station and left there‚Äù Umair said that the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) officials first got all four siblings out of the car and then again put their elder sister Areeba, 13 years, inside the car and opened fire.  Government and the Counter Terrorism Department's stance  = Victims were abductors = Preliminary news surfaced on the news channels after the incident that police recovered three children from the abductors. News channel reported that in an encounter against suspected kidnappers, law enforcers killed two women among four persons allegedly in a ‚Äògun battle‚Äô to recover children. However, this botched cover-up was exposed after the viral video of Umair Kahlil, slain couple's son, began talking to reporters in hospital. Khalil said in the video that his father pleaded before them to take their money and not to shoot them but they started firing. = Victims were terrorists = Fawad Chaudhry, the federal information minister, while commenting over the Counter Terrorism Department's action in Sahiwal asserted that all those killed were terrorist and they apparently used the family as human shield. Later, a Joint Investigation report declared three victims as innocent. Basharat Raja described the killings as \\"collateral damage\\". = Victims opened fire on police = The Counter Terrorism Department, in a statement detailing its version of Saturday's alleged encounter in Sahiwal that left four people, including two women, dead, claimed that the ‚Äúterrorist‚Äù driving the car shot at the police when intercepted. Some witnesses quoted widely by TV channels corroborated the assertion that there had been no firing from those travelling in the ill-fated car. One witness said the elite police forced the vehicle to stop and fired at the car occupants from a close range, which was later confirmed in autopsy reports. = Police recovered explosives from victims = Punjab Law Minister, Basharat Raja, claimed that two suicide jackets, eight hand grenades, two pistols and bullets were recovered from the car Eyewitnesses, however, disputed the claim and said the people in the car did not fire at officials, nor were any explosives recovered from the vehicle. = Zeeshan is the only terrorist = Provincial Minister for Information and Culture, Fayyaz-ul-Hassan Chohan, on Tuesday said that the preliminary report submitted by the Joint Investigation Team on the Sahiwal incident has transpired that deceased Khalil and his family were innocent, whereas Zeeshan belonged to a terrorist group. However, Zeeshan's brother Ehtisham claimed that he worked in the Dolphin Force and that authorities certainly had done background checks when he joined the force. He said that there was not a single FIR registered against his brother in the country.  Human rights issues  = Killing of parents in front of their children = Children rights activists lodged protests and said the killing of a couple and their 13-year-old daughter in front of their minor children would have a deep psychological impact on the survivors and it had destroyed their childhood. The children would never forget violence initiated by law enforcement agencies and remain in trauma for the whole life. = Killing of a minor girl in front of her younger siblings = There is 13 year girl was also killed in this incident. 13-year-old Areeba was shot four times as per the postmortem report, which indicated that brutality of the law enforcing forces, = Threats to family = The counsel of family of Sahiwal incident victims on Monday called for providing security to his clients in the wake of alleged threats from some officials of Counter Terrorism Department.  First information report issue  The First Information Report (FIR) of the Sahiwal incident, lodged by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) raised several questions. The law experts started arguing that the anti-terrorism department has cunningly saved its high-profile officers by citing the name of a sub-inspector as an in-charge of the Sahiwal operation, in the FIR of the case.  Postmortem report  Areeba, 13, was shot six times, and had her ribs broken by the impact of the bullets. She also shot in both sides of the chest. Nabeela was shot four times, including one time in the head. Khalil was shot 11 times, including one shot to his head. The driver Zeeshan was shot 13 times, including one shot to the head. The headshot had shattered his skull. Medical report also stated that a wound on the hand six-year-old Muniba, which officials earlier claimed was caused by glass shard from the window of the car, was in fact a gunshot wound. The bullet tore through her hand.  Judicial Inquiry  The Lahore High Court on 14 February 2019 ordered judicial inquiry into Sahiwal incident. The orders were given by Chief Justice Sardar Shamim.  Domestic reaction  = Public reaction = Soon after news of the incident broke, protests erupted in Lahore. During the protest, Ferozepur road was blocked and Metro Bus service suspended. This protest was ended after FIR was lodged against killers of the family. Later on several protests and strikes observed throughout Punjab against this incident and protesters demanded justice for deceased. Protestors also slammed ministers for their inhuman behavior towards incident.  Shehri Tahaffuz march  On 10 February, a large number of people protested against the killings under the Shehri Tahafuz March (Citizen Protection March) at Lahore. The victim families also attended this march and termed CTD as \\"Killer force\\" and demanded accountability of the killers. = Pakistan Peoples Party = Qamar Zaman Kaira, rejected the joint investigation team (JIT), formed by the government, demanding formation of a judicial commission to probe the Sahiwal killings. Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari criticized the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf-led government for the Sahiwal killings and said ‚ÄúSahiwal incident is a message for citizens in Naya Pakistan that they should not go outside their homes with families,‚Äù Khursheed Shah demanded the Prime Minister Imran Khan to tender an apology to the nation over Sahiwal encounter killings. = Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz = Rana Sanaullah said, ‚ÄúThe JIT drama is a joke with the nation and we completely reject this drama of the government.‚Äù Leader of the Opposition in National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif called for the resignation of Prime Minister Imran Khan and Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar in the aftermath of Sahiwal incident. Leader of Opposition in the Punjab Assembly Hamza Shehbaz Sharif called for holding a judicial inquiry into the tragic incident of Sahiwal.

It has one concrete runway and one spare ground. Circle of flights - LR, Nkr = 500 m. Call sign (approach) - Quartet. Military transport aviation (5th Aviation Group of the 6955th Avb) is deployed on aircraft Il-76 and the 325th Aircraft Repair Plant. The airport has its own aviation museum.  History  The history of the airfield begins in 1938 with the Taganrog military school of pilots. Since 1948, the Higher Officer Flight Tactical Courses began work, based on the Taganrog-Central airfield, training assault air regiment (aircraft Il-10, MiG-15bis). In 1960, the Second Central Flight Tactical Officer Enhancement Courses (II TsLTKUOS) were disbanded, and the 963rd Aviation Regiment of the EYVAUL was redeployed to the Taganrog-Tsentralny airfield of the Krasnodar Territory. The regiment was stationed here until its disbandment in November 1994. In April‚ÄìMay 1992, from Ganja, Azerbaijan the base was transferred to Taganrog The 708th Military Transport Aviation Regiment. In 1995, the 192nd Guards Kerch Red Banner Military Transport Aviation Regiment, which was stationed in the Trans-Baikal region, was liquidated. Ukurey, the garrison Ared (Ukyurey - 2); the honorary titles of the disbanded regiment crossed the 708th VTAP. At present, the 708th transport regiment has been reorganized into the 5th aviation group of the 6955th Guards Minsk Aviation Base of the 1st category, without changing the place of deployment. 325th Aviation Repair Plant (military unit 23213) dates back to the 14th mobile repair shops established in 1941. The plant has been located in Taganrog since 1948 and up to the present, the main task is to repair transport aircraft of the type An-12, An-72 and units for Il-76, Tu-142, Su-25, Su-27, helicopters Mi-8 and Mi-24. At the beginning of the 90s of the last century, a base for the liquidation of front-line aviation equipment was formed at the plant ‚Äî about 300 fighters and fighter-bombers were cut into metal. On the basis of the decision of the Military Council of the 61st Supreme Command of the Supreme Command (Military Aviation Administration) (Minutes No. 8 of August 31, 2002), by the order of the Commander of the 61st Supreme Soviet of the Supreme Command (VTA) of September 9, 2002 No. 236 to the Il-76MD reg. No. RA-76740 of the 708th Guards Kerch Red Banner Military Transport Aviation Regiment was given the honorary title Taganrog.  Museum  In 1995, the commander of the base for the liquidation of the AT, Colonel A. Kornienko, and the chief engineer of the base, Lieutenant Colonel V. Stoyanov, turned to the commander of the 4th Air Army, General Mikhailov VS with the proposal to save one aircraft of each type to create a museum of aviation technology. By the directive of the commander of the 4th IA of April 23, 1995, 4 aircraft of different types planned for cutting were allowed to leave as exhibits of the future aviation museum. On the former training ground of the 963rd ALM, a room for the museum was built and a site for outdoor exhibits prepared. From the disbanded Martsevskaya school of junior aviation specialists (military unit 06749), an L-39 aircraft was towed to the museum, and an L-29 aircraft from the Morozovsk garrison. In Yeisk passed on the metal Yak-38. Lt. Col. V. Stoyanov, begging a trailer from the head of the Taganrog garrison, went to Yeisk for a future exhibit, but colleagues from the Yeisk recycling base agreed to donate the Yak fuselage only for the equal amount of non-ferrous metal scrap. From the airfield TANTK them. G.M.Beryeva the An-2 plane was flown to the museum, on which the legendary aviator, Hero of the Soviet Union flew V. Grizodubova. Unfortunately, due to bureaucratic obstacles and simply human dishonesty, it was not possible to save the glad potential exhibits of the museum. In particular, it was not possible to agree with the leadership of TANTK on the preservation of a unique experimental aircraft VVA-14 design R. L. Bartini, which was simply cut into colored matter. The same fate befell another unique sample - the cabin of a supersonic bomber T-4 structures P.O. Sukhoi. Currently (2017), the museum has 12 aircraft (Yak-38, L-29, L-39, Mi-2, An-2T, MiG-19S, MiG-21bis, MiG-23MLD, MiG-25BM, Be -12P, Su-17UM, Su-17M3). as well as the nose of the Tu-145M, 10 types of engines, including training-cutting D-30KP, AL-21F-300, AI-25, training samples of aviation equipment and aircraft, equipment kits for the pilot. The museum exhibits a collection of more than 250 aviation miniatures, a library of technical and aviation literature, and a video library.

Researchers can choose to have their reviews prospectively registered with PROSPERO. The database is produced by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination at the University of York in England, and it is funded by the National Institute for Health Research. Registration of systematic reviews in the database has been supported by PLoS Medicine, BioMed Central, the EQUATOR Network, and BMJ editor-in-chief Fiona Godlee, among others. History After the PRISMA statement was published in 2010, the University of York responded to its recommendation for prospective systematic review registration by beginning development of an online database of systematic reviews. The resulting PROSPERO database was launched in February 2011 by Frederick Curzon, 7th Earl Howe. It was also launched at a Vancouver, Canada meeting organized by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research that month. By October 2011, the database included 200 records of systematic reviews that were being conducted at the time. In October 2013, the Cochrane Collaboration began automatically including protocols of its systematic reviews in PROSPERO. By October 10, 2017, the number of registered reviews in the database had increased to 26,535. Responses In 2017, concern was raised that some protocols in PROSPERO could be \\"zombie reviews\\" for which the protocol had been registered, but its record in the database had not been updated to indicate that it had been completed. Andrade et al. showed that only 7% of all reviews registered in PROSPERO from 2011 to 2015 had since been marked as \\"completed\\". These authors suggested that many of these reviews were either abandoned, meaning they had not been completed or published, or, if they had been completed, had not had their PROSPERO record updated to reflect this. Sideri et al. (2018) showed that orthodontics-related systematic reviews that were registered in PROSPERO were of higher methodological quality, on average, than those that were not.

Biography Paul was born on August 21, 1842 to Heinrich Friedrich Simon Unterberger and Marie Rudolph. His father, the son of the carriage master from Riga, was one of the founders of the veterinary business in Russia, for which he received a noble title. His family were Austrian Protestants from Salzburg which moved to Prussia during the early-18th Century. His grandfather Simon Thomas Unterberger moved to Riga during the early-19th Century. After the Russian Revolutions, most members of the family, including Paul, all moved back to their German homeland. In 1849, together with his father, Paul moved to Dorpat, where his father and uncle were appointed professors of the University of Dorpat. He graduated from the classical gymnasium. In 1860 he entered the Nikolaev Engineering School, which he graduated from in 1862 as a second lieutenant. In 1868 he graduated from the Nikolaev Academy of Engineering in the first category in the rank of staff captain. After graduating from the Academy, he was sent on a business trip to Europe, then left at the Academy for teaching and research work. In the years 1870‚Äì1871, Paul Simon Unterberger, in the rank of captain, was seconded to Turkestan to take part in a military campaign. After a business trip, he lost interest in his academic career and went to serve in Eastern Siberia. In 1875‚Äì1877, in the rank of lieutenant colonel, he served in Irkutsk as a staff officer for special assignments under the district engineering department of the East Siberian Military District. He was engaged in construction work in the underdeveloped areas of the Far East. He conducted a large research work, studying the military geography of the territories included in the East Siberian governorship. During the uprising in Mongolia, he was seconded to Urga for the construction of fortifications in the Russian embassy. Then, overcoming difficulties, he proceeded for research purposes (as a specialist in military geography) through Mongolia and the Gobi Desert, visited Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Japan. One of the goals of the trip was to hire 134 workers in China for construction in the Khabarovka post area. Under the terms of the contract, workers were hired for 2 years.Military engineer Pavel Unterberger. Historical essay. Nina Dubinina. ‚Äì Russian literary magazine \\"Far East\\" ‚Ññ 2. 2007.

In 1879, he again visited Vladivostok and completed the development of a plan for the deployment of defensive structures around him and the drafting of their projects. On October 1, 1888, Unterberger was appointed military governor of the Primorskaya Oblast and the appointed leader of the Ussuri Cossack Host. On August 30, 1889, a fortress flag was raised on the fortifications of Vladivostok in connection with obtaining the status of a fortress of the 2nd rank. The role of Vladivostok increased, and in August 1890, the seat of the military governor of the Primorsky region and the regional administration was transferred from Khabarovsk to Vladivostok.

He was a member of 29 charitable societies, in which he regularly paid considerable contributions. A demonstration took place in his governorship in Sormovo, and Peter Zalomov was arrested. The severity of the measures against the revolutionaries intensified the efforts of the Social Revolutionaries, who, led by Boris Savinkov, were preparing an attempt on the Nizhny Novgorod governor.

In 2014, the then directors Vijayaraghavan and Manavazhagan proposed setting up a cultural center with permanent exhibition to recreate the history of Tamils unraveled by decades of research, and the government approved it in September the same year. The center was opened to the public in a new building in March 2016. Infrastructure The center has a theatre, which films short eight-to-nine- minute documentaries showcasing photographs, dramatic recreations, videos, film clippings and pictures of sculptures/murals from temples. The museum is entirely based on Tamil literature. It exhibits paintings on Sangam literature, wood and cement reproductions of artefacts found in various parts of the state, photographs of collections in various other museums, replicas of weapons and implements, and replicas of ancient towns and temples. There are also dioramic representations that speak about how kings observed the rules of war, treated subjects rendering justice, and ensured fair-play and compassion to all creatures. The exhibits are arranged in five galleries, namely, the \\"Tholkappiar Arangam\\" displaying art forms; the \\"Thiruvalluvar Arangam\\" with exhibits of metalcraft/agriculture, education, medicine and weapons; the \\"Kapilar Arangam\\" with a collection of home tools/grinders and exhibits on temples and gods; the \\"Avvaiyar Arangam\\" with lifelike depictions of well- known events in the life of ancient kings; and the \\"Ilango Adigal gallery\\" with exhibits on shipbuilding and sail-weaving, for which ancient Tamils were well known.

RCA/BMG added three new studio tracks and changed the cover art when releasing the album in the rest of the world in 1995, renaming it The Very Best Live; stylized on the cover with \\"The Very Best\\" in a smaller font between Alan Parsons and Live. The live performances on the album are all songs from his years with The Alan Parsons Project. Project regulars Ian Bairnson, Andrew Powell, Stuart Elliott and Richard Cottle anchor the band with Parsons, Gary Howard (Freudiana) and ex-Manfred Mann's Earth Band vocalist Chris Thompson (Try Anything Once) providing vocals for the live tracks. The album is notable for instrumental track \\"Luciferama\\" (a blending of \\"Lucifer\\" and \\"Mammagamma\\"); \\"When\\", another Parsons songwriting contribution by Bairnson, sung by Thompson; \\"Take the Money and Run\\", the second songwriting and first lead vocal contribution to a Parsons album by Elliott; and Thompson's first non-demo studio recording of his co-composition \\"You're The Voice\\", a song first recorded and released by John Farnham in 1986.  Reception  Despite rating the album 2.5 stars out of 5 for AllMusic, reviewer Mike DeGagne praised \\"When\\" for \\"being the catchiest of the trio\\" of the new songs, as well as the \\"explosiveness\\" of the live performances, especially on \\"Prime Time\\" and \\"Standing on Higher Ground\\", \\"which both sound livelier than the album versions\\". He further praised the \\"fresh and crisp\\" sound throughout, and concluded, \\"The stellar execution of the songs played live on this album proves that the group - which remained shy of the spotlight - should have toured more frequently.\\" Mark Jenkins, reviewing the album for The Washington Post prior to a joint Parsons concert with Kansas, had equal criticism of his keyboard-oriented rock as \\"rather prim and a bit stiff; it betrays little of the spontaneity of live performance,\\" yet praise for its being \\"less bombastic than much British art-rock\\" as well as \\"a cunning balance between mainstream and snob appeal.\\" Jennings concluded that \\"slick, tame adult-rock may be out of vogue, but \\"Live\\" shows that its melodic quotient is undiminished.\\"  Track listing (EU edition)  All songs written by Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson. 1\\\\.

History and design  The butterfly house was built by the Municipality of Sel√ßuklu next to the Sel√ßuklu Flower Garden (Sel√ßuklu √ái√ßek Bah√ßesi) and the Adventure Tower (Macera Kulesi) inside the Butterfly Valley Park (Kelebekler Vadisi Parkƒ±), one of the biggest urban parks in Sel√ßuklu. It was opened on 4 July 2015. The London-based multinational architecture and engineering company Arup provided architectural design for the construction of the butterfly house. The building, which is designed in the form of a butterfly and covered with a glass roof, won the prestigious Turkish Best Architectural Design award in the Public Buildings category of 2018 Sign of the City. It covers including walking areas of .  Environmental aspects  It is the first butterfly sanctuary in the country, and has a butterfly flight area of . It is kept at a constant temperature of and 80% humidity all year long in a city with a cold semi-arid climate. The environment provides habitat for more than 20,000 tropical plants of more than 150 species and thousands of tropical butterflies from rainforest habitats belonging to up to 45 species. All the life cycle of the butterflies from the caterpillar larva, to pupa and finally to adult stage can be observed. A team consisting of a tropical plant expert and six horticulturists deals with the cultivation of the tropical vegetation in the greenhouse, which satisfy the vital needs of the butterflies. For the care of the plants, natural or traditional methods are applied to control harmful organisms since the use of pesticides is a threat to the butterflies. Other staff of biologists and veterinary physicians work for the care and protection of the butterfly house. The facility also features a Butterfly Museum, an Insect Museum and a Nature Education Class. The butterfly house also hosts scientific activities for students on fungi, birds, insects, and upon special request on reptiles and other interesting creatures.  Status  The butterfly house is open to the public from 9:00 to 17:00 local time, but is closed on Mondays. It is served by city bus line #47. The butterfly house attracts an average of about 350,000 tourists a year. As of early November 2018, the number of visitors had exceeded 1.5 million since its opening.

Retrieved January 20th, 2019. = Research on multiprincipal and common agency settings= One key idea in Martimort's research is the possibility of a common agent who contracts with multiple principals that each control one agent's activity. Martimort shows that in such a setting, the revelation principle fails to hold and only a weaker version - the equivalence principle - holds, with the results critically depending on the complementarity or substitutability of activities across principals.Martimort, D. (1992). Multi-principaux avec anti-selection. Annales d'Economie et de Statistique, pp. 1-37. Martimort then applied multiprincipal incentive theory to supply chains, using it to explain why manufacturers' choice of common or exclusive retailers depends on the complementarity or substitutability of their brands,Martimort, D. (1996). Exclusive dealing, common agency, and multiprincipals incentive theory. RAND Journal of Economics, pp. 1-31. and government, where it is used to describe the shared control of entities by regulatory bodies as a set of competing contracts.Martimort, D. (1996). The multiprincipial nature of government. European Economic Review, 40(3-5), pp. 673-685. Applying multi-principals and competing contracts to financial markets, Martimort, Bruno Biais and Jean-Charles Rochet develop a model that yields outcomes similar to those under imperfect competition, which however disappear as more competitors enter the market.Biais, B., Martimort, D., Rochet, J.C. (2000). Competing mechanisms in a common value environment. Econometrica, 68(4), pp. 799-837. Finally, in two studies with Lars Stole, Martimort shows that all common agency equilibria can be characterized by an extension of the taxation principle - the \\"delegation principle\\" -Martimort, D., Stole, L. (2002). The revelation and delegation principles in common agency games. Econometrica, 70(4), pp. 1659-1673. and how those equilibria are affected by direct externalities between principals under nonlinear price competition. Martimort, D., Stole, L. (2003). Contractual externalities and common agency equilibria. B.E. Journal of Theoretical Economics, 3(1). = Research on collusion= Another fertile area of Martimort's research is collusion, which he extensively explored with Jean-Jacques Laffont. Among else, they show under which conditions a principal can offer agents who collude under asymmetric information implementable collusion-proof contracts and how these contracts depend on their (non-)anonymity.Laffont, J.-J., Martimort, D. (1997). Collusion under asymmetric information. Econometrica, 65(4), pp. 875-911. They also show how the problem of collusion between agents in centralized organizations critically depends on the presence of limits to agents' communication, which creates a conflict between agents' participation and coalition incentive constraints,Laffont, J.-J., Martimort, D. (1998). Collusion and delegation. RAND Journal of Economics, 29(2), pp. 280-305. that \\"the separation of powers in regulation may act as a commitment against the threat of regulatory capture\\",Laffont, J.-J., Martimort, D. (1999). Separation of regulators against collusive behavior. RAND Journal of Economics, 30(2), pp. 232-262. and how principals can design collusion-proof mechanisms when agents' valuations are correlated.Laffont, J.-J., Martimort, D. (2000). Mechanism design with collusion and correlation. Econometrica, 68(2), pp. 309-342. Together with Antoine Faure-Grimaud, they also explore how the value of supervision with soft information depends on the tendency of supervisees and supervisors to collunder under asymmetric information, with centralized and decentralized settings resulting in the same outcome.Faure-Grimaud, A., Laffont, J.J., Martimort, D. (2003). Collusion, delegation and supervision with soft information. Review of Economic Studies, 70(2), 70(2), pp. 253-279. Finally, Martimort and Denis Gromb study how to design optimal incentive contracts for experts in different collusion environments, with important implications for the organization of delegated expertise.Gromb, D., Martimort, D. (2007). Collusion and the organization of delegated expertise. Journal of Economic Theory, 137(1), pp. 271-299. = Research on regulatory agencies= In his research on regulatory institutions, Martimort argues that they create a framework for the repeated interactions between an interest group and a regulatory agency, and may mitigate the risk of regulatory capture depending on their time preferences, information and transaction costs.Martimort, D. (1999). The life cycle of regulatory agencies: Dynamic capture and transaction costs. Review of Economic Studies, 66(4), pp. 929-947. These general principles were then applied to the analysis of regulatory institutions in Latin America (with Antonio Estache).Estache, A., Martimort, D. (2000). Transaction costs, politics, regulatory institutions, and regulatory outcomes. Regulatory Policy in Latin America: Post-Privatization Realities, pp. 49-82. = Research on public-private partnerships= A more recent area in Martimort's research is the theory of public-private partnerships (PPPs). Together with Jerome Pouyet, Martimort analyzes whether the construction of public service infrastructure and the management of that infrastructure should be bundled or not, arguing that PPPs may be advantageous if there is a positive externality, the private benefits from asset ownership are not too large, and the risk of regulatory capture is limited.Martimort, D., Pouyet, J. (2008). To build or not to build: Normative and positive theories of public- private partnerships. International Journal of Industrial Organization, 26(2), pp. 393-411. In subsequent research with Elisabeth Iossa, Martimort further extends the analysis of benefits and costs of public-private partnerships by allowing for asymmetric information, moral hazard, and renegotiations as well as private or public financing.Iossa, E., Martimort, D. (2012). Risk allocation and the costs and benefits of public-private partnerships. RAND Journal of Economics, 43(3), pp. 442-474.Iossa, E., Martimort, D. (2015).

Plot Rasmus' sister Britta and her classmate Joachim are in love. Britta finds an album in which Joachim lists his ex- girlfriends (Magareta, Yvonne, Ulla & Brit) along with a photo. She explains that she would find it terrible if her photo was put into Joachim's album. At the afternoon, Britta, Joachim, Rasmus and Pontus want to attend the show of the sword swallower Alfredo. Rasmus and Pontus don't have enough money to pay for the show. Therefore, they ask Alfredo to let them in for half of the price. Alfredo rejects rudely. Rasmus and Pontus secretly sneak into the show, are discovered by Alfredo and thrown out. A while later, Ernst visits Alfredo. Ernst has just been released from prison. The antique dealer Paul has told Ernst where he can find the country's largest silver collection: It is at the house of Joachim's family. Ernst wants to steal it along with Alfredo. When Britta and Joachim go to rehearsal for their band, one of Joachim's friends tries to kiss Britta. Britta immediately pushes him away, but Joachim believes that Britta is the one to blame. Britta and Joachim argue and end their relationship. Britta is afraid that Joachim puts her photo into the album of his ex-girlfriends. Britta tells her brother Rasmus about it. Rasmus promises to get the photo. Rasmus and his friend Pontus want to break into Joachim's house and steal the photo. The same night that Alfredo and Ernst want to steal the silver collection. Rasmus and Pontus find the photo in Joachim's wallet and take it with them. When they leave the house, they see Ernst and Alfredo who are trying to escape with the stolen property. Rasmus and Pontus follow the criminals. A short time later they are discovered and locked up along with Rasmus' dog. Ernst quickly realizes how important the dog is to Rasmus. He threatens to kill the dog if Rasmus and Pontus tell the police about what they have seen. The criminals lock the dog up and want to return it to the boys on Thursday morning. Then the boys are allowed to leave. Soon, Rasmus and Pontus find the stolen goods and exchange them with worthless objects. On Thursday morning Rasmus and Pontus ask about their dog. The criminals tell the boys about an abandoned house where the dog is supposed to be. There the criminals lock Rasmus and Pontus in. The two boys can escape. Finally, they find the dog. They tell Rasmus' father, who is a police officer, about the thieves. The criminals want to offer their stolen goods to the antique dealer Paul, but discover that the stolen goods were exchanged by Rasmus and Pontus. The thieves go back to Rasmus and Pontus. Rasmus and Pontus are back in the room, where there were locked up in. They tell the criminals they will show them the stolen goods. They lead the criminals into a dark house where the stolen goods are. The house turns out to be the police station and the criminals are received by the police. Rasmus, Pontus and Britta go to the summer party. But Britta is sad. She misses Joachim. At the party, Rasmus secretly puts the photo that Joachim had into Britta's hand. Britta thinks Joachim had given it to her. On the back of the photo she reads: ‚ÄûShe is the only one‚Äú. Britta is deeply moved and asks if that is true. Joachim wonders why Britta did not know that. Britta and Joachim kiss each other. Rasmus and Pontus watch the couple. They say that hopefully they will never be like that. Cast * Eskil Dalenius: Rasmus Persson * Sven Almgren: Pontus * Pia Skoglund: Patricia 'Britta' Persson * Torsten Wahlund: Joakim von Rencken * Stig J√§rrel: Alfredo * Elof Ahrle: Patrick Persson * Stig Olin: Ernst  Background  The screenplay for Rasmus, Pontus och Toker was Astrid Lindgren's first stand- alone screenplay. At first Astrid Lindgren wrote the script for an audio play series. The script was later used and rewritten for the film. The book titled Rasmus, Pontus och Toker was first released after publication of the film. On December 12, 1956 Rasmus, Pontus och Toker premiered in Stockholm. The film was shot in Mariefred and the AB Sandrew-Atelj√©erna Studios in Stockholm. Rasmus Persson is played by the same actor, that portrays Rasmus Rasmusson in Bill Bergson and the White Rose Rescue or Rasmus Oskarsson in Luffaren och Rasmus but these are both not the same characters. This is a completely independent film. Reception =Critical response= The Lexikon des internationalen Films says the movie is ‚Äûwell-made entertainment for children, with few flaws‚Äú.

He served in the Duke of Edinburgh's (Wiltshire Regiment) for much of his career and was mentioned in dispatches for his service in the Second Boer War. In 1909 he served on the general staff as a gymnastics instructor, during which time he made an appearance for the British Army cricket team. Henslow served with the Wiltshire Regiment in the First World War and received the Military Cross. After the war he joined the newly formed Army Physical Training Staff and rose to become inspector of physical training in 1928. Henslow retired in 1932 but returned to service during the first part of the Second World War.  Early life  Henslow was born at Mere, Wiltshire on 19 March 1879 and joined the British Army as a second lieutenant in the 3rd (militia) Battalion of the Duke of Edinburgh's (Wiltshire Regiment) on 27 October 1897. He attended Worcester College at the University of Oxford before joining the regular army in the Wiltshire Regiment on 20 May 1899. He received promotion to lieutenant on 14 May 1900. He served with the regiment in the Second Boer War and was mentioned in dispatches by Lord Kitchener on 29 July 1902. He was promoted to captain in 1905 and seconded to the general staff on 15 April 1909 as a gymnastics instructor, a role he held until 15 April 1913. Henslow made his sole first- class cricket appearance for the British Army cricket team in 1912 against the Royal Navy at Lord's, bowling 42 balls and taking one wicket, that of Gerald Harrison. He debuted in minor counties cricket for Wiltshire in July 1914, an association he would maintain until 1923. First World War  Henslow served in the First World War. He was with the 2nd Battalion of the Wiltshire Regiment in Gibraltar in August 1914 when it was recalled to England to join the 21st Brigade. Henslow was awarded the Military Cross on 5 May 1919. He had been promoted to the temporary rank of major on 24 February 1919 when he was appointed assistant inspector of physical training. Later that year he was confirmed in the substantive rank of major, backdated to 1 September 1915.  Inter-war and Second World War service  On 1 April 1922 he was appointed as a commandant (class AA) of the Army School of Physical Training at Aldershot. Henslow was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire on 5 June 1926, when he was a lieutenant-colonel and commanding officer of the school. He was promoted to the rank of colonel on 8 June 1926. Henslow was appointed inspector of physical training on 1 January 1928. In 1930 he was responsible for relocating the Army Physical Training Staff's headquarters from Aldershot to the War Office in London, which allowed for closer collaboration with the Director of Military Training. He also arranged for a staff officer to be allocated to the HQ to allow for closer relations with the General Staff. Henslow retired on 1 January 1932. During the 1930s he advocated the Brotherhood Movement, an organisation that used exercise and religion to educate British youth, as a democratic alternative to the British Union of Fascists. Henslow was recalled for service on 7 June 1939 before retiring for the last time on 30 May 1942. He died at Salisbury, Wiltshire on 12 March 1947. The Henslow Room at the Army School of Physical Training, which is now a cardiovascular fitness suite, is named after him.

Noah Berlatsky from The Verge mentioned in a positive review of the first two episodes of the series, that \\"Technology in Osmosis doesn't create a dystopia or a utopia in itself. It's just a tool, and different people project different dreams and fears onto it, for better and worse\\" and that this \\"level of nuance and awareness makes Osmosis start out thoughtful and refreshing.\\" Greg Wheeler from The Review Geek recommended the first season in their review of the series by stating that \\"Osmosis is a really thrilling sci-fi trip, one asking some big questions around love and relationships while delivering a well written story full of twists and turns along the way.\\" Devin Townsend from The Breeze complimented the first season in his review by adding that the series is \\"thought-provoking and edges on the air of irony. It relies on the audience's knowledge of the challenging world of dating and how cynical the human race is becoming with their choice of an \\"other half\\".\\" In a positive review of the series, Jon O'Brien from i-D wrote that, \\"Osmosis delivers a more optimistic proclamation. Humankind and machines can in fact live in relative harmony, and without the fear of murderous robot dogs, head-exploding video games or hashtag-powered genocides. And should disaster strike, it's more likely to be us pesky humans to blame.\\" Emma Stefansky from Thrillist praised the series, stating that \\"Osmosis joins the ranks of shows like the German time-travel thriller Dark, the Danish zombie eco-pocalypse The Rain, and the South Korean medieval drama Kingdom, creating a subgenre within Netflix of remarkably good foreign-language genre television\\" and further adding that it \\"is the kind of show you can just sit and absorb.\\" Laurie Clarke of Techworld gave the series a positive recommendation saying that its \\"handling of a technologically entwined future is much more subtle than the at-times hamfisted approach of Black Mirror and it breathes some much-needed humanity back into tech-centric fictions.\\" References External links Category:2010s French television series Category:2010s LGBT-related drama television series Category:2010s science fiction television series Category:2019 French television series debuts Category:2019 French television series endings Category:Dystopian television series Category:Espionage television series Category:French drama television series Category:French-language Netflix original programming Category:French LGBT-related television shows Category:French science fiction television series Category:Hard science fiction Category:LGBT-related web series Category:Malware in fiction Category:Nanotechnology in fiction Category:Serial drama television series Category:Television series about artificial intelligence Category:Television series set in the future Category:Television series set in the 21st century Category:Television shows set in Paris ","title":"Osmosis (TV series)"},{"id":"59722685","text":"The Racing Club Abidjan (RC Abidjan or RCA) is an Ivorian football club based in Abidjan.

Rosenblum's music has been recorded on such labels as Mode Records, New World Records, Albany Records, Capstone Records, Opus One Records, New Focus Recordings, and the Composers Recordings Inc. label, and has been published by Edition Peters, of Leipzig, London, and New York. Early life Rosenblum was born in Flushing, Queens and began playing the saxophone at age eight. He attended the High School of Music and Art (\\"Music & Art\\") as an instrumentalist, where his interest turned to free jazz. At Music & Art, he met jazz performers Anthony Coleman and David Krakauer, and performed with them from 1970-73 at venues throughout New York City. In college, Rosenblum studied music composition at Boston's New England Conservatory of Music (\\"NEC\\") (B.M. 1977, M.M. 1979) and Princeton University (MFA 1981, PhD 1992) with composers Milton Babbitt, Donald Martino, Paul Lansky, Jaki Byard, and Malcolm Peyton, while also working privately with composer Burr Van Nostrand. During and after his time at NEC and Princeton, Rosenblum's work was also closely associated with composers Lee Hyla, Ezra Sims, Dean Drummond and Eric Moe. Career Rosenblum joined the Department of Music of the University of Pittsburgh in 1991, where he has been a Professor of Music Composition and Theory, Chair of the Department of Music, and codirector of both the \\"Music on the Edge\\" new music series as well as the biannual \\"Beyond: Microtonal Music Festival\\" (copresented by the Andy Warhol Museum). Among the awards he has received in over four decades as a composer include a Guggenheim Fellowship, a National Endowment for the Arts Music Fellowship Grant, two Fromm Foundation Commissions, a Barlow Endowment Commission, several MacDowell Colony and Yaddo Residency Fellowships, and multiple \\"Featured Composer\\" and \\"Composer in Residence\\" honors at music festivals and colleges in the United States and Asia. Music The Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians has described Rosenblum as \\"a leading voice in American microtonal music [who] attempts a synthesis of elements from classical, jazz, rock and world music in his work\\". New York's WQXR-FM has cited \\"Rosenblum's customary 21-note-per-octave microtonal scale, combining the 12 notes of the piano with [the] intervals that fall somewhere between the keys\\", while The New York Times has called Rosenblum a composer who \\"mix[es] surreal microtonal scales [and] seductive melodies\\". A 2018 review in Stereophile Magazine described Rosenblum as a composer who \\"blends percussion, acoustic instruments, electronics, voice, and microtonal elements in visceral, moving ways.\\" Many of Rosenblum‚Äôs compositions have employed a similar \\"integration of diverse compositional elements\\". Rosenblum himself has cited his \\"long-standing love for Javanese music... and the music of LaMonte Young\\" as central influences on his work.

Plot Rasmus lives in an orphanage. He wants to be adopted by loving parents. But soon he realizes that only girls are adopted. So one day he decides to escape from the orphanage to find the parents on his own. Shortly after his escape, he meets the tramp Oskar. He joins Oskar on his trip around the country. Oskar earns money by playing the accordion and singing for other people. One day Oskar and Rasmus are singing in front of a house where a robbery is taking place. The old woman who lives alone in the house is forced to pretend that everything is normal. Oscar and Rasmus realize that something strange is going on. Rasmus sees someone hiding behind the curtain. He also believes the old woman is terribly scared and asks Oscar to find out why. The two observe how some criminals are stealing a valuable necklace. After the robbery, the old woman is seriously ill and can not testify. The doctor suspects that she may die. Only the maid Anna-Stina testifies. She pretends to be a victim of the robbery. However, she and two of her accomplices are responsible for the robbery. She also explains that a tramp robbed the old lady along with a little boy. Therefore, Oscar and Rasmus are suspected of having something to do with the robbery. Rasmus and Oskar don't know about the allegations and sing in front of the two accomplices of the maid. Rasmus immediately recognizes the shoes of one of the accomplices. He had seen it flashing up behind the curtain. Rasmus also recognizes the other criminal. He suggests that he and Oskar could go to the police, but Oskar says that nobody would believe a tramp and a homeless child. Besides, they would need proof. Soon, the robbers hide their stolen goods in the house where Rasmus and Oskar spend the night. Rasmus and Oskar are discovered by the robbers, but Oskar can hide the stolen goods from the robbers. Then Oskar and Rasmus go to another village to sing there. A while later Oskar and Rasmus are arrested, because the police suspects, they are the criminals who robbed the old lady. Rasmus and Oskar tell who the real criminals are. However, the police does not believe them. Rasmus escapes. He is captured by the criminals who want him to tell them where the stolen goods are. However, only Oskar knows where the stolen goods are. The robbers want to free Oskar from prison so that he can not tell the police too much about them and tell them the hiding place. Oskar pretends to join the plan but wants to outsmart the criminals. He shows the criminals the hiding place while he is secretly followed by a few policemen. The police finally recognizes who is responsible for the robbery. Oskar and Rasmus give them the stolen goods. While the criminals are arrested, Rasmus and Oskar leave. They go to a house. As it turns out, it is the house of Oskar. He lives there with his wife, but has left his home to live as a tramp. Oskar and his wife want to adopt Rasmus. Rasmus finally has a home.

The script was later used and rewritten for the film. The book titled Rasmus p√• luffen was first released after publication of the film. On December 3, 1955 Rasmus, Pontus och Toker premiered in Stockholm. Rasmus Oskarsson is played by the same actor, that portrays Rasmus Rasmusson in Bill Bergson and the White Rose Rescue or Rasmus Persson in Rasmus, Pontus och Toker but these are both not the same characters. This is a completely independent film. Reception =Critical response= The Lexikon des internationalen Films says the film is an ‚Äûeducationally clever children's film based on the book by Astrid Lindgren.‚Äú. Lova Hagerfors from the Swedish Film Institute believes that the film is told honestly and with great warmth. It was easy to empathize with the fate of Rasmus. The film is surprisingly timeless and still suitable for children today. OnealRedux from moviebreak.de praises the cheeky dialogues and good characters. The film has a ‚Äûflair for the 50s‚Äú and reveals itself ‚Äûas a great Feel-Good-Movie‚Äú.

The Van Duzer Corridor AVA lies entirely within the established Willamette Valley AVA and covers approximately 59,871 acres. When the petition was submitted there were 17 (now 18) commercially-producing vineyards covering a total of approximately 1,000 acres, as well as 6 wineries (now 9), within the AVA. The distinguishing features of the Van Duzer Corridor AVA are its topography, climate, and soils. alt= Topography Topography is characterized by low elevations and gently rolling hills. The low elevations allow cool breezes to flow relatively unimpeded from the Pacific Ocean, through the Oregon Coast Range, forming a wind corridor gap known as the Van Duzer corridor. The western end of the Van Duzer Corridor wind gap is narrow and squeezed by high elevations to the north and south, leaving little room for viticulture. However, the eastern end of the Van Duzer Corridor wind gap, where the Van Duzer Corridor AVA is located, features the same low elevations and rolling hills as the western portion, with the distinction of having a wider area suitable for vineyards. Within the Van Duzer Corridor AVA, the elevation does not impede the eastward-flowing marine air, allowing higher wind speeds to flow through. In contrast, the surrounding regions all have higher elevations. Climate Climate is characterized by consistent high wind speeds and low cumulative growing degree-day (GDD) accumulations. The consistently high winds in the AVA contribute to thicker grape skins, and raise the levels of phenolic compounds in the fruit. In contrast, the wind speeds to the north and south southeast of the AVA are slower. The Van Duzer Corridor has lower GDD accumulations than surrounding regions to the north and southeast, indicating that its temperatures are generally cooler. The cooler temperatures ripen the fruit slowly, creating a longer hang time than for the same grape varietal grown in a region with higher GDD accumulations. The longer hang time contributes to a reduced acidity level. Soils Soils are primarily uplifted marine sedimentary loams and silts with alluvial overlay, as well as some uplifted basalt. The soils are typically shallow, well-drained, and have a bedrock of siltstone. The high silt and clay levels in the soils balance the overall pH level of the soil by buffering against a sudden increase or decrease in soil pH. The buffering effect is beneficial to vineyards because it boosts the ability of the soils to maintain a stable pH level. In contrast, the soils immediately outside the northern and western boundaries contain soils from different soil series. Farther north and west, the soils contain higher concentrations of basalt and other volcanic materials. In contrast, east of the Van Duzer Corridor AVA, within the Eola-Amity Hills AVA the soils contain larger amounts of volcanic material than the AVA. Additionally, south of the AVA, the soils contain large concentrations of Ice Age loess, which is not found in the Van Duzer Corridor AVA.

It is native to shallow water in the northeastern Pacific Ocean from the Gulf of Alaska to Baja California. Taxonomy This seaweed was first described in 1889 by the Swedish botanist Frans Reinhold Kjellman as Laminaria dentigera, the type location being Bering Island, where it was said to be fairly abundant, scattered across the sublittoral zone. In a revision of the genus Laminaria by C.E.Lane, C.Mayes, Druehl and G.W.Saunders in 2005, the species was transferred to the genus Saccharina, becoming Saccharina dentigera. Description Saccharina dentigera is a large brown seaweed growing to a length of . The thallus is dark brown, thick and leathery, often appearing palmate because of being split into broad lobes to within of its base. Younger thalli are entire with ovate blades. The thallus is supported on a robust, semi-rigid stipe, which has mucilage ducts on its surface near the upper end. The stipe is attached to a rock surface by a branched holdfast up to high. Each holfast only bears one thallus, but new blades sometimes start to grow before the old ones are shed. Distribution and habitat The species is found in the northeastern Pacific Ocean, its range extending from the western Gulf of Alaska to the Bering Sea and the Aleutian Islands off the coast of Alaska, and southwards to Ensenada, Baja California. It occurs on rocky substrates in the lower intertidal zone and the shallow subtidal zone. Ecology Saccharina dentigera is one of the most abundant kelps in the southern Kodiak Islands, and is the dominant seaweed at most sites in the shallow subtidal zone. The kelp forests provide shelter and substrate for many species of marine organisms. In May, it is found at these sites with reproductive structures. The limpet Lottia instabilis is a specialist feeder on S. dentigera to the extent that it is essentially a parasite of the kelp.

It grows up to 1.5 metre high, (up to 3 metres according to VicFlora). It grows in heath in damp places, often near waterfalls and gullies, along the coast and adjacent ranges.Fairley, A. & Moore, P. (2010) Field Guide to the Native Plants of the Sydney Region, page 276. Allen and Unwin. Description Baeckea linifolia is an erect shrub with branches having drooping tips. The leaves are linear and widely spaced, linear (more or less terete) and growing close to the stem. They are 5 to 15 mm long, acute at the end and having a tapering base. The solitary, axillary, flowers are white and up to 5 mm across on pedicels (stems) which are 1.5‚Äì2 mm long. The calyx lobes are triangular. The petals are ovate and 1.5 to 2.5 mm long. There are 8 to 15 stamens, none of which is opposite the petals on curved filaments. The flat-topped ovary has two cells. The fruit is cup-like and the seeds are angular. In Victoria it flowers mainly from December to March. (In the Sydney region, Fairley and Moore have it flowering mainly in January and February.) In Victoria it is found in low swampy heaths from Cann River eastward and northward. Victorian plants typically have smaller, more rigid leaves in comparison with plants found in New South Wales and Queensland, and were previously included in Baeckea linifolia var. brevifolia F.Muell. ex Benth. Taxonomy and naming Baeckea linifolia was first formally described in 1807 by Edward Rudge and the description was published in Transactions of the Linnean Society of London fom a specimen collected \\"near Port Jackson\\". The specific epithet (linifolia) is derived from the Latin words linum (\\"flax\\") and folium (\\"leaf\\"), giving a compound Latin adjective which describes the plant as having leaves like those of a flax plant (long and narrow).Backer, C.A.

When alive, he had a notorious reputation for both his handling of the Fitzsimmons vs. Sharkey fight and his role in the O.K. Corral gunfight. This only began to change after his death when the extremely flattering biography Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal was published in 1931. It became a bestseller and created his reputation as a fearless lawman. Since then, Earp has been the subject of numerous films, television shows, biographies, and works of fiction which have increased both his fame and his notoriety. Long after his death, he has many devoted detractors and admirers. His modern-day reputation is that of the Old West's toughest and deadliest gunman of his day. When a post office was established in 1930 in the unincorporated settlement of Drennan, near the site of some of his mining claims, it was renamed Earp, California in his honor. In 2002, a plaque was erected at the site of the Earp's cottage in Vidal, California, noting that the cottage was the only home they owned in the time they were married.  Ship Wyatt Earp  Arctic explorer Lincoln Ellsworth became fascinated with the Earp legend. Ellsworth completed four expeditions to Antarctica between 1933 and 1939, using a former Norwegian herring boat as his aircraft transporter and base that he named Wyatt Earp after his hero. Ellsworth befriended Earp's widow, Josephine Earp. After Wyatt's death, she wrote him that she was sending him Wyatt's handgun, a shotgun, pipe, and wedding ring. She said she was sending him a .41-caliber Colt revolver, which she said Wyatt referred to affectionately as his \\"baby pony.\\" However, Ellsworth actually received a .45-caliber Colt revolver with a 7 ¬Ω\\" barrel. Its serial number indicates it was originally shipped from the Colt factory on January 30, 1883. The shotgun was a 16 gauge double-barreled hunting shotgun and case belonging to Wyatt. Ellsworth's widow Mary Louise Ellsworth donated the wedding ring and pistol to the Arizona Historical Society in 1988.  Property auction  = John Gilchriese collection = John Gilchriese, an amateur historian and long- time collector of Earp memorabilia, interviewed John H. Flood Jr., Wyatt Earp's secretary, several times before his death in 1959. Gilchriese operated a Wyatt Earp Museum from 1966 to 1973 at Fifth and Toughnut Streets in Tombstone. His collection included Earp's original diagrams of the gunfights in Tombstone and Iron Springs, along with photos, original letters, invoices, checks, and hundreds of related items. In 2004, when his health deteriorated, he sold his collection at auction. The drawings of the OK Corral shoot out were later resold.Preview Gallery Johns' Western Gallery June 12, 2004 = Signature = In February, 2010, the earliest known example of Wyatt Earp's signature, found on a February, 1870 Lamar, Missouri subpoena, sold at auction for $14,937.50. = Personal weapons = Colt .45 single-action revolver like that owned by Wyatt Earp. On April 17, 2014, the family of deceased Earp amateur historian Glenn Boyer put much of his Earp collection and many artifacts up for auction. Among the 32 boxes of documentation, files, pictures and memorabilia for sale was a Colt .45 caliber said by Earp descendants to have been owned by Wyatt Earp. Also included in the auction was a Winchester lever-action shotgun belonging to Wyatt Earp. Earp was known to carry a .45 caliber revolver, as he did on the night of the Fitzimmons-Sharkey fight in 1896. Historians have credible evidence that Wyatt used a .44 caliber 1869 American model Smith & Wesson during the gunfight at the O.K. Corral. This weapon was given by Earp to John Flood, who left it to Earp historian John D. Gilchriese. Descendants of Wyatt Earp's cousins assert that Earp carried the revolver featured in the auction and while in Tombstone, although the grips, barrel, and cylinder have been replaced. Only the frame is original, and its serial number has been filed off. However, X-ray testing showed an original serial number, 5686, which matches a batch of revolvers purchased by the U.S. Army in 1874. The history of the items is controversial, because they belonged to Boyer. John Boessenecker, a respected author of numerous articles on the American Old West and a collector of American Old West guns and memorabilia, said that it would be \\"impossible to separate the authenticity of the auction items from Boyer's own troubled history.\\" This is particularly true, because the provenance of the weapons is based on letters written by or given to Boyer. The authenticity of the revolver displayed at the auction is attested to by a typewritten letter dictated by Bill Miller to his daughter LaVonne Griffin. Miller was married to Estelle Edwards, the daughter of Adelia Earp Edwards, Wyatt's sister. Before his death, Boyer completed a sworn affidavit attesting that the Colt .45 belonged to Earp. The affidavit is included with the revolver, along with other expert findings. Critics challenge the authenticity of the letter because Boyer signed an affidavit in 1994 and stated again in 1999, long after Bill Miller's death, that he did not have any documentation from Miller.

Despite Boyer's affidavit, he said the missing serial number is a \\"kiss of death.\\" He says, \\"No serious collector will want that.\\" The Wyatt revolver from Boyer's estate was expected to fetch from $100,000 and $150,000. On the day of the auction, more than 6,400 online bidders and over 400 collectors from 49 countries took part in the auction. The revolver attributed to Wyatt Earp was sold to John Anderson, a founder of Isagenix International in Chandler, Arizona, for $225,000. The Winchester lever-action shotgun also said to be Wyatt Earp's sold for $50,000, below the high value estimate of $125,000. During the Earp Vendetta Ride Earp borrowed a short, 22-inch, 10 gauge, double barrel percussion shotgun from Fred Dodge. He used it to kill Curly Bill Brocius. Dodge used the shotgun throughout his 40-year career and the gun was also registered to U.S. Marshal Heck Thomas. It passed through several owners. It was last sold in February, 2020, for $375,000.00. = Gunfight sketch = John H. Flood Jr., Wyatt Earp's secretary, who he regarded like a son, drew a sketch of the gunfight at the O.K. Corral in 1926 under Wyatt's supervision. The drawing placed participants and selected witnesses on Fremont Street in Tombstone, and Earp annotated it with lines indicating how the participants moved during the 30-second shootout. It was sold at auction by Alexander Autographs in early October 2010, for $380,000.  Earp legend in film and television  Earp was depicted in only one movie while he was alive. He later became the prototypical model for a western lawman. His character has been portrayed directly and indirectly in dozens of movies and television shows. = Wild Bill Hickok (1923) = Earp's good friend William Hart produced and wrote the seven-reel epic Wild Bill Hickok released by Paramount in 1923. It was the first movie to depict Wyatt Earp and the only movie that included his character before he died in 1929. Hart played \\"Wild Bill\\" and Bert Lindley played Earp. The role of Earp's character in the movie was very small. He appears at the back of a crowd scene when Hickok meets some gentlemen on the city street. Bert Lindley is not listed on some descriptions of the movie and this portrayal of Earp is often overlooked, as in the biography Inventing Wyatt Earp: His Life & Many Legends. Earp served as a technical adviser on the film. In the film, Hickok calls on his friends Earp, Calamity Jane, Bat Masterson, Doc Holliday, Charlie Bassett, Luke Short and Bill Tilghman to help clean up a wild cowtown. Promotional copy for the film prominently mentioned Earp: \\"Back in the days when the West was young and wild, \\"Wild Bill\\" fought and loved and adventured with such famous frontiersmen as Bat Masterson and Wyatt Earp.\\" Earp was described in the promotional copy as \\"Deputy Sheriff to Bat Masterson of Dodge City, known as one of the three greatest gun-men that ever lived, along with Bat Masterson and \\"Wild Bill\\" Hickok\\". In reality, Earp was a virtually unknown assistant marshal in Dodge City when Wild Bill Hickok was murdered in 1876. After his death in 1929, Earp's character did not appear in a movie until the famous gunfight was depicted for the first time in the 1932 film Law and Order, although the Wyatt Earp character is named Frame 'Saint' Johnson (Walter Huston). Since then, about 40 other movies have included his character. With the emergence of television in the 1950s, producers spun out a large number of Western-oriented shows. At the height of their popularity in 1959, there were more than two dozen \\"cowboy\\" programs on each week. At least six of them were connected in some extent to Wyatt Earp: The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp, Bat Masterson, Tombstone Territory, Broken Arrow, Johnny Ringo, and Gunsmoke. = Depiction of Old West lawmen = Wyatt Earp both directly and indirectly influenced the way movies depict lawmen in the American Old West. While living in Los Angeles, Earp met several well-known and soon-to-be famous actors on the sets of various movies. He became good friends with Western actors William S. Hart, and Tom Mix. Stuart Lake's book Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal was the basis for how Earp has been depicted as a fearless Western hero in a large number of films and books. The book was first adapted into a movie for Frontier Marshal in 1934. Josephine Earp successfully pressured the producers to remove Wyatt's name from the film, and the protagonist was renamed \\"Michael Wyatt\\". The film was made again in 1939. Josephine sued 20th Century Fox for $50,000, but with the provision that Wyatt's name be removed from the title, and after she received $5,000, the movie was released as Frontier Marshal starring Randolph Scott playing Wyatt Earp. Sol M. Wurtzel produced both films. Lake wrote another book about Wyatt Earp titled My Darling Clementine in 1946 that director John Ford developed into the movie of the same name, which further boosted Wyatt's reputation. The book later inspired a number of stories, movies and television programs about outlaws and lawmen in Dodge City and Tombstone. Lake wrote a number of screenplays for these movies and twelve scripts for the 1955‚Äì61 television series The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp starring Hugh O'Brian as Earp. The popular movie Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, released in 1957, starring Burt Lancaster as Earp, cemented his place in Western history as a hero lawman. The movie also altered the public's perception of cowboys, who in Earp's time and locale were outlaws, but in the movies were reinvented as good guys, assisting the lawmen in their fight against the outlaws. Director John Ford said that when he was a prop boy in the early days of silent pictures, Earp would visit pals on the sets he knew from his Tombstone days. \\"I used to give him a chair and a cup of coffee, and he told me about the fight at the O.K. Corral. So in My Darling Clementine, we did it exactly the way it had been.\\" When Ford was working on his last silent feature Hangman's House in 1928, which included the first credited screen appearances by John Wayne, Earp used to visit the set. John Wayne later told Hugh O'Brian that he based his Western lawman walk, talk and persona to his acquaintance with Wyatt Earp, who was good friends with Mix. \\"I knew him ... I often thought of Wyatt Earp when I played a film character. There's a guy that actually did what I'm trying to do.\\" Wyatt Earp's character has been the central figure in 10 films and featured in many more. Among the best-known actors who have portrayed him are Randolph Scott, Guy Madison, Henry Fonda, Joel McCrea, Burt Lancaster, James Garner, Jimmy Stewart, Hugh O'Brian, Kurt Russell, Kevin Costner and Val Kilmer. = Notable films featuring Earp = * Wild Bill Hickok (1923) ‚Äì Bert Lindley portrays Wyatt Earp. * Frontier Marshal (1934) ‚Äì Notable as the first film adaptation of Stuart N.

President of Burkina Faso Roch Marc Christian Kabor√© announced that he intends to form a new government; on 21 January, he began the process of appointing a new government by naming Christophe Joseph Marie Dabir√© as the new Prime Minister, but his cabinet remains vacant. In the days leading up to the resignation of the government, the country faced a number of attacks from militant terrorist groups, and opposition members of government had previously called for the prime minister and defense ministries to step down, citing an inability to address terrorist attacks. Background The resignations were announced on television by President Kabor√©, but his announcement did not state any reasons for why his government resigned. Northern provinces of the country, particularly ones bordering Mali and Niger, have been in a state of emergency since 31 December, following a rise in jihadist attacks. In the week preceding these resignations, Burkina Faso's government extended the state of emergency for an additional six months in regions where terror attacks were reoccurring. According to the ACLED, at least 200 militant attacks were suspected throughout the country ‚Äì including southern and western provinces ‚Äì from 1 January 2018 to 12 January 2019. It is estimated that violence in the northern provinces has displaced at least 54,000 people since 2016. At least 60 attacks were confirmed by the ACLED to have happened in the country's eastern provinces since February 2018. =Attacks on the French Embassy and Burkinab√© Army headquarters= In the capital city Ouagadougou on Friday, 2 March 2018, jihadists initiated a coordinated attack against France's embassy to Burkina Faso as well as the Burkina Faso army headquarters. Eight were killed and more than 80 wounded. Burkina Faso security forces later killed all eight militants involved. French authorities were alerted once gunfire began, and French citizens in the area were told to stay inside. Windows were shattered at the Burkinab√© Army headquarters and heavy smoke could be seen from the army chief of staff's office in Ouagadougou, with explosions being reported around the area. The United Nations condemned the attacks and United Nations Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres requested that the nations of the world work to \\"promote national reconciliation and create the conditions for sustainable peace and development\\" in Burkina Faso. French President Emmanuel Macron spoke with the Burkinab√© President to express his condolences. =Kidnapping and murder of Canadian nationals= Days before the government resigned, it was confirmed by officials that a Canadian geologist, Kirk Woodman, was abducted and killed at a mine exploration camp in the country's northern provinces near the border with Mali. He was the second Canadian national to be killed in the country within a span of weeks. The Foreign Ministry of Canada condemned the attacks and stated that it will work with the government of Burkina Faso to pursue those responsible, and the Foreign Ministry of Burkina Faso stated that it will open an investigation. The Security Ministry of Burkina Faso believes that Islamist militants from outside of the country are responsible. Other Canadian nationals in Burkina Faso, including Edith Blais and her Italian partner Luca Tacchetto, have been known to be missing since December. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stated that to the best of his knowledge, Blais is still alive, and that Canadian authorities are working to gain information about her disappearance in Burkina Faso. In response to these abductions, Canada has issued travel warnings for Burkina Faso, warning of banditry and kidnappings. The United States issued a similar warning the same day, advising against travel to Burkina Faso's northern and eastern provinces. In the interests of public safety, Burkina Faso's government imposed a curfew in Orodara from 19 to 23 January, citing severe threats of terrorism and kidnappings. Announcement of resignation On the afternoon of 19 January, Prime Minister Paul Kaba Thieba submitted to the President his resignation, as well as the resignation of his cabinet. President Kabor√© reportedly \\"accepted the resignation\\" and expressed \\"all his gratitude to Prime Minister Paul Kaba Thieba and all its ministers for their commitment to the service of the nation\\". In the months leading up to the resignation, opposition ministers have requested the resignation of the Prime Minister, as well as the resignation of those in charge of the security and defense of the country. The President announced that he intends to form a new government in the near future, but his televised announcement of the resignations did not include an explanation for why his government resigned. On Monday, 21 January, President Kabor√© begun forming a new government by naming Christophe Joseph Marie Dabir√©, once a health minister under former President Blaise Compaore, as the country's Prime Minister. The new government has not yet been named, and the cabinet remains vacant as of 21 January. Dabir√© had also represented Burkina Faso at the West African Economic and Monetary Union. He was appointed by presidential decree. Secretary-General St√©phane Sanou announced the appointment via television.

Biography After undergraduate study at the University of Washington in Seattle, Paul Beeson studied medicine at McGill University Medical School, where he received his MD in 1933. After two years as an intern at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School, he joined his father's and elder brother's practice in Wooster, Ohio. In 1937 he became a research fellow at Manhattan's Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research. There he worked for two years in the laboratory of Oswald Avery. In 1939 he relocated to Harvard Medical School's teaching affiliate Peter Brent Brigham Hospital to work under Soma Weiss. At Atlanta's Emory University School of Medicine Beeson became in 1942 an assistant professor and in 1946 a full professor and chair of medicine. From 1952 to 1965 he was chair of medicine at the Yale School of Medicine. As successor to Leslie John Witts, Beeson was from 1965 to 1974 the Nuffield Professor of Clinical Medicine at the University of Oxford. He gave the Bradshaw Lecture in 1968. When he left Oxford he donated all the money from his Oxford pension for the upkeep of William Osler's old house at 13 Norham Gardens. The house became the warden's lodge of Green College. Beeson persuaded Cecil Howard Green, founder of Texas Instruments, to endow the first one million British pounds to establish the college. (In 2007 Green College and Templeton College were merged to form Green Templeton College, Oxford.) In 1974 Beeson became the VA distinguished professor of medicine at Seattle's University of Washington Medical School, retiring in 1981 as emeritus professor. Beeson and Petersdorf published a clinical study of patients with persistent fevers of unknown cause ‚Äì they suggested guidelines for diagnosing the causes. In 1981 the Yale School of Medicine established the Paul B. Beeson professorship in internal medicine. From 1950 to 1954 he was editor for Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine (London, McGraw-Hill). From 1959 to 1982 he was a co-editor for the Cecil-Loeb Textbook of Medicine (Philadelphia/London, Saunders). He published The Eosinophil (Philadelphia/London, Saunders) in 1977. For The Oxford Companion to Medicine (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1986), he was a co-editor with Sir Ronald Bodley Scott and then with Lord Walton after Bodley Scott's death. William Hollingsworth's Taking Care: The Legacy of Soma Weiss, Eugene Stead and Paul Beeson (1995) and Richard Rapport's Physician: The Life of Paul Beeson (2001) explain the importance of Beeson's career.

Barbro's dearest birthday wish is to get a dog, but it's too expensive for the family. However, Barbro has a secret: she has a twin sister called Ylva-Li. Ylva-Li lives in a secret land called Salikon, under the rose bushes in the garden, where she is queen. Ylva- Li and Barbro experiences many adventures. In addition, Barbro has everything she could wish for: two dogs, a cat, horses, food that she likes, unforgettable experiences, etc. Furthermore, Ylva-Li loves Barbro more than anything else and calls her her most beloved sister. The day before her birthday, Barbro visits Ylva-Li. The girls make a trip to the most beautiful valley in the world. The sisters have to pass the dark forest of fear, where the evil ones live. When they arrive at the most beautiful valley in the world, Ylva-Li and Barbro enjoy a wonderful day there. However, Ylva-Li has to deliver some bad news to her twin sister. If the roses in front of the entrance to Salikon have withered, it means that Ylva-Li is dead. Desperately, Barbro runs home. Even her mother can not comfort Barbro. When Barbro gets up on her birthday, she gets a puppy. Her parents had just pretended that they could not afford the dog to surprise Barbro. When Barbro goes out into the garden, she discovers that the roses have withered in front of the entrance of Salikon. The entrance to Salikon no longer exists. Barbro is sad, but is happily greeted by her puppy dog Ruff, who cheers her up. Barbro and Ruff go for a walk together.

A broadcast in Germany and a DVD release in Sweden and Germany followed. Reception =Critical response= Anna Zamolska from KinderundJugendmedien.de believes, that Allrak√§raste syster is \\"a wistful, serious fairy tale\\". It stands out \\"from other fairy-tale film adaptations by its serious and sad atmosphere\\" and takes up \\"some of the most beautiful allegories from Lindgren's books\\". She also praises the acting performance of the two leading actresses and the music. The symbolic content of the story is comparable to that of the Brothers Lionheart, as a similar type of love between siblings is shown here. With \\"it's fairy-tale happenings in our everyday world\\" it seems like a \\"Kafkaesque short story for children\\".

She was of British, American and Hawaiian descent. Life She was born on February 1, 1840, in Honolulu, Hawaii, the first-born child and daughter of Abram Henry Fayerweather (1812‚Äì1850) and Mary Kekahimoku Kolimoalani Beckley (1820‚Äì1850). Her family was considered to be of the ali ªi (noble) class. She was the maternal granddaughter of British Captain George Charles Beckley and Ahia, a distant relation of the reigning House of Kamehameha and descendant of the 15th-century King Lƒ´loa. Her two sisters were Mary Jane Fayerweather Davison Montano (1840‚Äì1918), who married American pharmacist Benoni Richmond Davison and Colombian photographer Andreas Avelino Montano, and Hannah Fayerweather Bell (1843‚Äì1870), who married Thomas Kamukamu Bell. A brother named William Malulani Fayerweather (1841‚Äì1843) died young. On May 28, 1857, she married Chinese millionaire merchant Chun Afong. The wedding ceremony was officiated by American Protestant missionary Reverend Lowell Smith. This marriage connected Afong to the reigning Kamehameha family and the ruling Hawaiian elite class. In 1874, her husband supported the political aspirations of KalƒÅkaua (who shared a wet nurse with Julia and was considered a foster brother). Afong quietly gave financial support to KalƒÅkaua in the election of 1874 against Queen Emma (the widow of Kamehameha IV). After the king's election, he appointed Afong to his Privy Council of State. The family business in Hawaii steadily grew with investments in retail, shipping, opium sales, and sugar and coffee plantations. After the death of Afong's eldest son Chun Alung in 1889, he sold or reorganized most of his business holdings in Hawaii and invested in the Douglas Steamship Company in Hong Kong. He named Samuel Mills Damon as administrator of an estate left in Hawaii to support Julia and their many children. Afong never returned to Hawaii and died in Hong Kong in 1906. Julia Afong died in Honolulu, at the age of 79, on February 14, 1919. She was buried at the Oahu Cemetery next to her son Jimmie. Children Toney Afong Julia and Afong had sixteen children.

Legacy An elderly Julia Fayerweather Afong In 1909, Julia and Afong's life was fictionalized in the short magazine story, ‚ÄúChun Ah Chun‚Äù, by American novelist Jack London. It was later published his 1912 book The House of Pride: And Other Tales of Hawaii. London's highly embellished story of Afong depicts him as a \\"crafty coolie\\" who spites the white capitalist establishment through his own business success. He also entices white men with money to marry his racially-mixed daughters across the color- line. Julia was portrayed as \\"Stella Allendale, herself a subject of the brown-skinned king, though more of Anglo-Saxon blood ran in her veins than of Polynesian\\". In 1961, his great-grandson Eaton \\"Bob\\" Magoon Jr. wrote the book, music and lyrics to 13 Daughters, a short-lived Broadway musical. Don Ameche played the eponymous Chun while Monica Boyar portrayed his wife Emmaloa (based on Julia). The site of the Afong family's Waikƒ´kƒ´ villa, where royalty and dignitaries were entertained, was sold in 1904 to the United States Army Corps of Engineers for the construction of Battery Randolph and Battery Dudley, built to defend Honolulu Harbor from foreign attacks.

Along with his political analysis and measured response series, Brewis has been producing long-form media reviews and video essays on a number of topics, such as television, film, internet culture and video games. Mermaids charity stream From 18 to 21 January 2019, Brewis continually streamed an attempt to complete Donkey Kong 64 to raise money for British transgender charity organization Mermaids, which he completed in 57 hours and 48 minutes. The charity had been designated funding by the British National Lottery, but the funding was withheld and put under review after criticism by Irish comedy writer Graham Linehan and others. This inspired Brewis to livestream in support of the charity. The livestream featured many notable guests, including U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez; whistleblower Chelsea Manning; actress Mara Wilson; journalists Paris Lees and Owen Jones; Adam Ruins Everything creator Adam Conover; author Chuck Tingle; Matt Christman and Virgil Texas of the Chapo Trap House podcast; Donkey Kong 64 composer Grant Kirkhope; game designers Rebecca Heineman, Josh Sawyer, John Romero and Scott Benson; YouTubers Natalie Wynn, Lindsay Ellis, Oliver Thorn and Jim Sterling; as well as the CEO of Mermaids, Susie Green.

The livestream began with a goal of , but it passed that goal and several subsequent funding targets quickly. In the first 24 hours, the livestream raised over $100,000. In total, over $347,000 () was raised for the charity through the livestream, with over 659,000 people watching the stream. The livestream garnered attention and praise. It was described by The Guardian as \\"an antidote to the worst of gaming culture\\" and praised in a motion lodged in the Scottish Parliament by Patrick Harvie. In July 2019, the LGBT magazine Attitude recognized the livestream by honoring Brewis with an Attitude Pride Award. The Mermaids charity Twitter account also thanked Brewis for the livestream. Reception Brewis has been praised by critics for his YouTube channel's format and commentary. His video analysis of the Ctrl+Alt+Del comic \\"Loss\\" has received critical acclaim: it was selected by Polygon as one of the ten best video essays of 2018 and was nominated three times in the Sight & Sound collection of 2018's most outstanding videographic criticism, with British film critic and filmmaker Charlie Lyne stating: \\"The reliably great H.

He was a prominent personality of the Lebanese and Arab left. Initially a Nasserist nationalist, he later turned to Marxism and became the leader of the Communist Action Organization in Lebanon (OACL). As the head of OACL, he played key roles in the building of alliances during the Lebanese Civil War. Youth Muhsin Ibrahim was born in Ansar in southern Lebanon in 1935.L'Orient Le Jour.

ŸÖÿ≠ÿ≥ŸÜ ÿ•ÿ®ÿ±ÿßŸáŸäŸÖ He took part in the first conference of the Arab Nationalist Movement in Amman on December 25, 1956, and was elected to the leadership of the organization. In 1964, Ibrahim took part in meeting with Nasser, as the Arab Nationalist Movement tried to convince him to support the Dhofar Rebellion. In early 1966, Ibrahim travelled to Taiz along with George Habbash and Hani al-Hindi, as an delegation of the Arab Nationalist Movement seeking to convince the Yemeni National Liberation Front to merge with the Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen. Split in the Arab Nationalist Movement During 1962‚Äì1965 a factional conflict surged within the Arab Nationalist Movement. Ibrahim was part of a tendency a within the Arab Nationalist Movement, including Nayef Hawatmeh, Mohammed Kishli, Bilal al- Hasan and Abdel Fattah Ismail, that became increasing inspired by the Cuban, Chinese and Vietnamese revolutions and began to gear towards Marxism. The radical group, to which Ibrahim belonged, stressed that national and social struggles should not be separated from each other. In 1966 the group around Ibrahim began publishing articles in Al-Hurriya, the organ of the Arab Nationalist Movement, that were critical of the government of the United Arab Republic. Ibrahim was the editor of Al-Hurriya. However, until 1967 the tendency of Ibrahim remained committed to Nasserism. The defeat of Egypt in the 1967 Six-Day War aggravated the divisions within the Arab Nationalist Movement, with the tendency of Ibrahim, Hawatmeh and Ismail moving from nationalism to Marxism-Leninism. In 1968 Ibrahim founded the Organization of Lebanese Socialists, which in 1970 merged with the group Socialist Lebanon to form the Communist Action Organization in Lebanon (OACL). In 1975 Ibrahim was named general secretary of OACL (hitherto the organization had a collective leadership), a post he was to occupy until his death. Civil War and Resistance With the outbreak of the Lebanese Civil War in 1975, Ibrahim emerged as a key leader of the Lebanese National Movement (a coalition of leftist and nationalist movements, aligned with the Palestinian forces) along with Kamal Jumblatt and George Hawi.

She was uncharacteristically bold beyond her age, gender, and the restraints of the late Victorian era in which she grew up. During her life and now through her legacy, she is considered an authority on the legendary Lost Horse Mine also referred to as the Lost Padre Mine. Parents and family Her father, William Blackburn Rose (1833 - 1892), was born in Jefferson, Ohio. Her mother, Anna Rebecca Fink (1849 - 1936), was born in Hanover, Prussia, Germany and immigrated to the USA in 1864.United States Census, 1910, Anna R Rose household, Soledad, Los Angeles, California, United States; citing enumeration district ED 351, sheet 18A, family, NARA microfilm publication T624 (Washington D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, 1982), roll 87; FHL microfilm 1,374,100. Annie's father was a divorcee (Fannie Vost) and her mother a widower (Henry Christian Woest). Annie's parents married in Bakersfield on 17 July 1876. Their first son, Robert Fink Rose, was born in Bakersfield on 29 March 1879 and died on 24 August 1885 at age 6. Their next child was William Louis Rose (aka \\"Billy\\") born on 12 December 1880 in Bakersfield. Three years later Annie Lydia Rose who was born in San Francisco on 27 December 1883. Annie had a half brother, Heinrich (Henry) Edward Woest (aka \\"Eddie\\") born on 9 April 1872 in Manhattan, New York City. Eddie was from his mother's previous marriage to Henry Christian Woest born in Hanover, Prussia, Germany. Rose Station In 1852, Annie's father William Blackburn Rose moved from Jefferson, Ohio, to the new State of California where he worked for a time on the historic San Emigdio Ranch. What was originally a vaquero camp on the Sebastian Indian Reservation between 1853 and 1875 known as Rancho Canoa (trough) became a stage stop or way station that was established 1858. The route from Bakersfield to Los Angeles via Fort Tejon was 150 miles and took 32.5 hours according to the Butterfield Stage schedule. In 1875, William B. Rose built an adobe stage station at this site as a water and rest stop for stagecoaches on the old Los Angeles-Bakersfield run.California Historical Landmark No. 300 Rose Station was a stockmen's headquarters, post office, and polling place. It was also a trading post and a center for social activities in the Tejon area.Bakersfield Californian, 17 November 1941 It continued operation until 1942.Described in a poem titled Rose's Station by Annie Rose Briggs dated 1941 Early Residence In 1868, Jos√© Juan Lopez built a five-room adobe dwelling to serve as a stopover for herders moving cattle and sheep over the San Joaquin-Los Angeles trail. It was located at what later became the fork of the old Ridge Route and the new US highway 99 near Castaic. Annie's father bought the property and Annie Rose lived there as a child for five years.Ghosts Walk Castaic's Trails, Independent Press Telegram, 6 March 1960 (Long Beach, CA.) In 1886, William Blackburn Rose also homesteaded in Charley Canyon near present-day Castaic.History of the Santa Clarita Valley by Jerry Reynolds Annie Rose attended the Castaic School from 1889 to 1895 riding to and from school on horseback despite her young age.Described in a poem by Annie Rose Briggs dated 17 February 1940 Annie's half-brother Heinrich (Henry) Edward Woest (aka \\"Eddie\\"), a commercial bee keeper, homesteaded 160 acres acquired under the 1862 Homestead Act with a patent granted on 30 August 1904. The ranch was located in the northeast quarter of section 22 of township 7 North, range 17 West, San Bernardino Meridian. At first it was called the Cienega Ranch which later became the Kelly Ranch and eventually the Knapp Ranch in 1962. This was another base of operations for Annie during her lifetime and provided access to her mining claims.Accession number CA2380‚Äî.116, Bureau of Land Management, Land Office Records, 1904 Marriage Annie Lydia Rose married Franklin Adrian Briggs on 9 November 1931. Her husband was born in North Dakota on 22 November 1899 and was 16 years younger than his wife. He was described as tall, thin, frail, and had a cavity in the middle of his chest. Treasure Story 1916 Annie introduced her remarkable story in a newspaper article in April 1916. She describes meeting a Dr. Bragg in the mountains in 1901 to whom she gave assistance. She would have been 16 or 17 years old at the time. Bragg told her about a lost gold mine from the 1840s known as the \\"Lost Horse Mine\\". Years later on his death bed, Bragg \\"drew forth the withered parchment (map) and bestowed it as a token of appreciation.\\" (Bragg died on 29 March 1915 aged 96). The story goes on to say that in 1911, the young Annie Rose \\"relocated the mine and filed two claims, 600 by 1000 feet in area. For two years she did the assessment work, and then lack of capital and her mother's illness forced her to stop. Last year she resumed the work and now has a good title\\". Annie Rose claimed: \\"The mine from 1842 to 1848 produced $3,000,000 in gold. Then it was closed by order of the Church and the Indians sworn to secrecy, for California lost it sovereignty and became part of the nation.\\"Oakland Tribune, 16 April 1916, page 54 Backstory A Native American (Soxo) who worked at the Lost Horse Mine in the mid 1840s made a deal with Dr. B. F. Bragg to show him the location of the Lost Padre Mine in exchange for thoroughbred horses. \\"The mine had been, according to the story, located in 1840 by an Indian and worked by the mission fathers, who in three years, according to the legend, took out a cool million in gold. But one day the tunnel caved in, burying fifteen Indians, and the rest refused to go back. So the padres filled up the tunnel and concealed the entrance to the mine, which remained lost until the doctor made the deal with the Indian 24 years later. The property was relocated and it is declared Dr. Bragg and his associates took out $750,000 in two years. But death again followed the footsteps of the miners, for an Irish foreman went amuck, killed four men and flung their bodies into the shaft. Dr. Bragg escaped, but the mine was somehow lost again. Just before his death Dr. Bragg told Miss Annie L. Rose, now owner of the property, where the mine could be located.\\"Covina Argus, 7 October 1927, page 10 1920s In 1922, the Los Angeles Times newspaper quoted Miss Annie L. Rose as saying she had found the Lost Padre Mine for which she had been searching for 12 years. She said she intended to reopen the mine with a group of investors.Los Angeles Times, 11 June 1922 In 1927, it was reported: \\"Miss Rose interested certain persons of means some two years ago and about $33,000 was expended in cross-cutting with tunnels in an effort to locate the old tunnel. The work suddenly was abandoned.\\" This is a reference to a partnership with King Gillette, the son of Gillette of razor-blade fame. The son, King Gaines Gillette, had become obsessed with finding old Spanish mines and became active in the Bear Canyon area around 1922. It is not clear if his renowned father was a partner in this venture. Prior to this, they had partnered in a joint mining venture in the Rough and Ready district west of Grass Valley through their company, the California Mining Co. King Gillette hired workers to dig a tunnel that became known as the Gillette Mine although it did not follow a mineralized seam. Gillette's workers tunneled for over a quarter of a mile along the east side of the canyon. They were trying to intersect an old \\"Spanish\\" shaft or hidden vault. The popular film star, Tom Mix (1880 - 1940), became involved with prospecting efforts in the same area. Mix was the star of hundreds of early Western movies between 1909 and 1935, mostly in the silent film era. He was dubbed the King of the Cowboys during the 1920s. There is a story that in 1932 King Gillette hired a seer for $100 a day. After 4 days of hiking around the canyon, the mystic shuddered in the middle of a creek bed, and shouted \\"It's here; the gold is right under us 17 feet down!\\" Gillette grabbed a shovel and started digging furiously. The mystic then told Gillette, \\"Stop. It won't do any good. The spirits of four Indians are guarding the treasure, and they'll move it as soon as you get close.\\" Not long after Gillette had abandoned his project, Annie Rose started working with a new partner: \\"B.

Miller of Pomona got in touch with her and formed the Lost Horse Leasing Syndicate, which leased the properly and began to hunt for the mine.\\"Oakland Tribune, 16 October 1927, page 36 The Los Angeles Times newspaper reported that Annie held 27 mining claims in the north-west corner of the Angeles National Forest. Her half-brother, Henry E. Woest (aka \\"Eddie\\"), and her attorney, Gilbert A. McElroy, had an \\"interest\\" in some of these claims.Los Angeles Times, 18 September 1930 1930s In 1930, Annie Rose Briggs was back in the news again and said to be still searching for the lost mine. She had found two skeletons, and in a follow up investigation sheriff's deputies had located two more skeletons. \\"Remains of the other two men, whose ghosts, legend in the district has it, have stalked the canyon since they were slain there in 1878, were discovered last Saturday by Miss Annie L. Rose, who has devoted twenty years of her life in search for the Lost Padre. Yesterday's success in finding the skulls and several bones of the two other victims bears out the stories that have been current in the mountain fastness for half a century of the quadruple murder and the resultant loss to miners of the location of the tunnel from which came $800,000 in nearly pure gold quartz during two years and $93,000 in one strike on the last day it was worked, the day of the murders.\\" \\"Everything went along fine until a man known as \\"Bronco Charlie\\" Riley - the bad man of the district - came over from his cabin and saw the golden wealth fairly pouring from the bore. Because he was known as a dangerous man Dr. Bragg let Riley act as superintendent over the Indian and the three Mexicans. He thought by letting Riley in on some of the gold he would not attempt to rob the workings. But on the day the $93,000 was known to have been rained the Indian and three Mexicans disappeared. The story of the mine, the murders, and the vast riches close at hand persisted with Miss Rose, never for an instant doubting its authenticity.\\"Oakland Tribune, 28 September 1930 on page 83 \\"It was Doc Benjamin Franklin Bragg, an associate of \\"Lucky\\" Baldwin of racehorse fame, who revealed to Miss Rose in 1915, before he died, the mine's approximate location. Doc had gained riches in the mine but died a pauper, and was afraid to go back. Miss Rose filed claims on the territory an set to work. Two days ago, digging near the site of an old Indian camping ground, she found the skulls.\\"Oakland Tribune, 19 September 1930,page 32 \\"Bragg was skeptical but he also was a gambler. And when he went out to the canyon he took with him three Mexican helpers, one of them a boy. He soon found the mine and a little later the Indian chief anxious to see that the sacred entrance was undisturbed, erected his wigwam half a mile away from Bragg's operations. The mine prospered beyond Bragg's dreams. In two years he accumulated more than $800,000 in gold...fearing his \\"find\\" would become public, did not file a claim. His Mexican assistants were sworn to secrecy - and this they were glad to keep because they were making so much money. Only at night did they dare take out the gold from the mine. Everything went well - and then the villain came into the picture. He was Broncho Charlie Reilly, a cattle rustler, braggart and one who was quick on the draw. He wandered one day into the Lost Padre diggings and announced he was on the payroll with all the assurance of an Al Capone. Reilly was determined to have the entire mine for himself. He saw days when in which the yield was about $75,000 worth of gold. So one day, when the day's total reached a high of $95,000, Broncho Charlie, with a flourish of revolvers, demanded the money and the mine. Doc Bragg, realizing he meant business, seized the gold, leaped on his horse and fled.\\"Hamilton Evening Journal, 27 December 1930, page 17 \\"Rose said the superintendent, Bronco Charlie Riley, was afraid that the old Indian's death had put a curse on the mine, so he started landslides that obliterated the diggings. He eventually was shot to death after drunkenly boasting in Newhall he had killed the four. Bragg came down with tuberculosis and never could find anyone who believed his story of the mine.\\"Antelope Valley Press, 27 May 2009, page C8 Prospector and miner Annie Rose Briggs was also an active prospector and miner together with her husband, Franklin Adrian Briggs, and with various partners, helpers and employees over the years. As a teenager, David Wasdahl had worked with Annie and her husband during the winter of 1939/1940. In a letter he sent to the Ridge Route Communities Museum & Historical Society in Frazier Park CA in August 2007, David recalls: \\"When I was there with Annie and Adrian we weren't looking for an old mine shaft, instead we were blasting away into a mountain side, pursuing a new mineral outcropping.\\" Contract On 16 April 1951, at age 67, Annie Rose Briggs entered into a mining contract with several partners to re-open the historic Lost Horse Mine. The document lists the names of 9 partners in the contract, including Annie Rose Briggs (1883 - 1972), her husband, Franklin A. Briggs (1899 - 1972), and her brother, William L. Rose aka \\"Billy\\" (1880 - 1953). Also named in the contract were Jack R. Kill, Palmer C. Ashley, Alfred L. Little, and Howard Clark. The document read in part: \\"That it is believed to be the reopening of the first of the old tunnels of the Lost Padre Mine. It is our belief that there is Gold stored in this tunnel and abandoned there before 1846.\\" In this same year (1951), Annie Rose Briggs engaged the services of a bulldozer driver named Glenn McKinney. Using a bulldozer, McKinney cut a road into Bear Canyon from the old Ridge Route and in so doing managed to get a D9 Caterpillar into the canyon. Using it as a prospecting tool, McKinney attempted to uncover the lost mine under Annie's direction.correspondence with Glenn McKinney's daughter, Kathy Baxter, May 2017. Writings Annie Rose Briggs was a prolific writer and described many aspects of her life in the form of well-written poetry and prose. From her writings that were dated, her works appear to have been written in the latter part of her life after 1940 (after age 55). At least 34 examples of her writings (mostly poems) have survived. Most of the stories in her writings are about lost mines and hidden treasure in her area of focus in the north-west corner of the Angeles National Forest. An unredacted compendium of her poetry is expected to be published shortly. Entrepreneur The enigmatic Annie Rose Briggs was an energetic mining promoter and, as such, was very influential in attracting potential investors in mining and recovery enterprises. Annie made her living by selling mining leases and setting up investment partnerships. These enterprises were spiced with engaging stories of lost mines and buried treasure. Authority \\"The blue-eyed, gray-haired pioneer has become an authority on Castaic history, not only because of her lifelong residence in the area, but because of personal interest in searching out early-day lore, especially that dealing with a certain, almost legendary, gold mine of fabulous value.\\" The California Mining Journal in May 1963 attested to the mine's richness: \\"This monster gold bearing vein was 60% gold.\\" Howard Clark summed up by saying: \\"Much convincing evidence exists to indicate that the Padre is American mining's richest sleeper\\".The Lost Padre Mine by Howard D. Clark: The California Mining Journal - May 1963 (page 18) Howard D. Clark, was a well-known author of books on the subject of lost mines in the 1940s. Life-long search Annie lived and breathed gold mining and recovery for her entire adult life and was clearly very passionate about her endeavors. \\"Sometimes a lost mine is eventually found. Only last year the Lost Padre, also known as the Lost Horse, was rediscovered by Annie L. Rose, who had looked for it since early in the century.\\"Los Angeles Times, 24 September 1933, page 86 Despite repeated claims in newspaper articles since 1915 of her locating the lost mine, there is no evidence that Annie Rose Briggs ever found any such mine. Death Annie Rose Briggs passed away at age 88 in January 1972. She was considered a legend in her own lifetime. Legacy Annie Rose Briggs is considered an authority on two historic lost mines, the Lost Horse Mine and the Dr. B. F. Bragg Mine. She spent most of her adult life searching for these legendary mines, although unsuccessfully. Validity The validity of Annie Rose Briggs' stories is thrown into question because there is no corroboration of her claims from any other independent source. This whole saga comes from Annie Rose and Annie Rose alone. While considerable detail is known about the life of Dr. Benjamin Franklin Bragg (1819 - 1915), there is nothing to indicate Bragg was ever involved in a gold mining enterprise in Bear Canyon. And there is no mention in the newspapers of the day of four mine workers being murdered in that area in 1878. Moreover, there is nothing to show the alleged outlaw, Bronco Charlie Riley, was a real person. There was an outlaw with a similar name active in the San Bernardino area in the mid-1890s. However, his last name was Williams and not Riley and he was a Black man and not a white Irishman.Los Angeles Herald, 9 July 1894, page 3Los Angeles Herald, 15 July 1895, page 2 It appears that Annie Rose Briggs was a mining promoter extraordinaire and a teller of tall tales. Presumably grist for her promotional mill.

He is known for the strong sense of humor and irony that appears in his candid and spontaneous photos of everyday life. He teaches workshops around the world and his photography has been exhibited in the United States, Europe, and Asia. His series titled Unposed has been published in two books.  Life and work  Semetko was born near Detroit, Michigan and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Speech from Northwestern University in Evanston, IL. He holds a master's degree in consciousness studies from the University of Philosophical Research in Los Angeles. At 16 he was a page in the United States House of Representatives. For much of his adult life Semetko was a professional comedic actor and writer, and he still performs occasionally. In 2000, he had a corporate performing job that took him to England, Ireland, Japan and China. He purchased his first camera for the trip and after seeing a photo he took outside Shanghai of two women in a dugout canoe it occurred to him that he could use photography as a different medium to tell stories. He has stated he views his photography as an extension of his acting and writing. Semetko was inspired by the work of Magnum Photos photographers Henri Cartier-Bresson and Elliott Erwitt, saying, \\"In a perfect world, I would try to get the emotion from an Erwitt image and the composition of a Cartier-Bresson photograph.\\" = Unposed = Semetko's first book, Unposed, was published by teNeues in 2010 and contained photographs taken from 2000 to 2010. Elliott Erwitt wrote the foreword for the book, excerpted below: > Good photographs are tough enough to shoot. Really funny ones are even > harder. Good and funny photographs observed in nature not arranged or > manipulated but simply observed in real time with amazing consistency, > constitute a minor miracle now presented in Mr. Semetko's book...In my book > he is the essential photographer. That is, the one who sees what others > could not have seen. In 2014 Semetko was selected as one of ten photographers to be a part of Leica's 10√ó10 exhibition. This inaugural show celebrated Leica's 100 year anniversary at their new headquarters and museum in Wetzlar, Germany. Leica paired each photographer with their \\"artistic father,\\" coupling Semetko with Erwitt. In an article that year celebrating the history of Leica cameras, Esquire magazine called Semetko \\"a noble torchbearer\\" to the long legacy of professional photographers using Leicas, beginning with Cartier-Bresson.

Education  Allen studied the Natural Sciences Tripos at the University of Cambridge, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) and Master of Science (MSci) degrees in 1999. She was an undergraduate student at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. She moved to America for further postgraduate study, earning another master's degree (MS) in chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania. She returned to Cambridge for her doctoral studies, earning a PhD in 2003 for research supervised by Jean-Pierre Hansen on theoretical chemistry and computational simulations of water permeation of nanopores. Career and research Allen joined AMOLF as a Marie Curie Fellow, working on models of switching events between metastable states, which are rare. She was part of the group who developed Forward Flux Sampling, which simulates rare equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems and allows the calculation of rate constants. She joined the University of Edinburgh as a Royal Society of Edinburgh (RSE) Research Fellow in 2006. Allen is interested in organisms such as bacteria grow in complicated environments. She was awarded a Royal Society University Research Fellowship in 2009, studying the non-equilibrium interactions of microbes with their environments. She joined the Royal Society of Edinburgh (RSE) Young Academy of Scotland in 2012 and was promoted to Reader in 2013. She has studied how microbes are involved with the sulphur cycle, which releases significant amounts of carbon as microbes consume hydrogen from organic matter. She analyses microbial ecology and nutrient cycles using Winogradsky columns, developing models that predict long-term microbial dynamics and chemical composition. She studies how microbial populations develop on different surfaces, identifying what factors influence the structure. Bacterial colonies self-assemble on soft gel surfaces, and Allen has modelled how they compete for space. Allen uses algorithms to study the metabolic pathways of sugars. She delivered the 2017 SCI: where science meets business Sir Eric Rideal Lecture. Her work has been supported by the United States Army Research Laboratory. Allen delivered her inaugural lecture in 2018, discussing how physicists can contribute to antimicrobial resistance. Her research into antimicrobial resistance considers how antibiotic drugs interact with the physiology of a cell. She has also looked at how microbes evolve in drug gradients; finding that drug resistance is accelerated by the presence of a gradient. This occurs because bacteria enter the gradient in waves, with each more resistant than the one that proceeded it. Resistant mutant bacteria at the edges of the population wave exist at low density and do not compete with nearby cells. Allen published a statistical physics guide to bacterial growth in 2018. =Awards and honours= In 2005 Allen was awarded the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) Meldola Medal and Prize. She was awarded a Royal Society University Research Fellowship (URF) in 2009.  Personal life  Allen is married with one daughter.

It was not released as a single but reached number 34 on the Billboard Magazine Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. It is a lengthy song, with a released version of almost nine minutes, but earlier versions were more than twice as long. It has been characterized as a document of moral rot in urban regions of the United States in the late 1980s. Lyrics and music AllMusic critic Matthew Greenwald interpreted the song as a critique of America under Ronald Reagan. \\"Crime in the City\\" was written on a sailboat in 1988 on the same day Young wrote \\"Ordinary People\\" and \\"Days That Used to Be.\\" It is a lengthy song whose released version has five verses and is almost nine minutes long. Earlier versions of the song, entitled \\"Sixty to Zero,\\" which Young performed in concert with the Bluenotes in 1988 were even longer, going on as long as 11 verses and 20 minutes. Young would play both acoustic and electric versions of the earlier version, though the final released version was heavily acoustic. According to David Downing the lyrics describe \\"selfishness, stupidity and sensless violence.\\" Allmusic critic Matthew Greenwald interprets it as \\"illustrating society's lost and found in the late-Reagan administration America of the late '80s.\\" Rolling Stone Magazine contributor Andy Greene describes it as \\"a frantic screed about people slowly losing their minds in a wild city.\\" The editors of Rolling Stone described it as a companion to the bookend song on Freedom, \\"Rockin' in the Free World,\\" stating that it \\"surveys Eighties moral rot.\\" Music journalist Paul Williams interpreted \\"Crime in the City\\" to be a \\"demand that we stop ignoring and denying the reality all around us,\\" also noting that it shares this theme with \\"Rockin' in the Free World.\\" The first verse describes a bank robbery, and also introduced themes of sensationalist media and inability to receive comfort from family. The third verse describes a cop who is driven to corruption by the violence of the criminals and the ineptitude of his superiors and who now takes bribes from 10 year olds. He ends the verse stating that \\"There's still crime in the city/But it's good to be free.\\" In between, the second verse describes a cynical record producer who, dissatisfied with the song he is recording, orders a hungry songwriter and a cheeseburger. The 4th verse describes a boy dealing with his parents' divorce. Music critics Johnny Rogan and Nigel Williamson see this verse as being personal to Young, whose parents divorced in 1959. Williamson hears the raw emotion of Young's wounds from that divorce in the lines \\"Sometimes I talk to Daddy on the telephone/When he says that he loves me I know that he does/But I wish I could see him, I wish I knew where he was.\\" Music lecturer Ken Bielen suggests that the boy in this verse, who admits to sometimes being good but sometimes being bad, may be the same one who bribed the cop in the prior verse, and that Young is implying that the boy's broken home is responsible for his actions. In the 5th verse, Young sings that \\"I keep getting younger/My life's been funny that way,\\" which Williamson sees as a play on the lyrics from Bob Dylan's \\"My Back Pages,\\" in which Dylan sings \\"I was so much older then/I'm younger than that now.\\" Rogan notes that despite that, the line \\"Wish I never got old\\" nonetheless ends the song on a \\"wistful note.\\" But in between, Young described a former fireman who when growing up \\"sassed\\" authority figures such as his parents, teachers and preachers, and now is serving a life sentence in prison for an unspecified crime. Bielen suggests that as with previous verses, the fireman's predicament is the result of growing up in the city. A deleted verse described the killing of the Dakota people. Among the verses deleted from the final song were one describing the genocide of the Sioux and Dakota people and another about a prison warden and guard shooting deer in an empty prison yard. \\"Crime in the City\\" uses a chord structure that resembles that of Dylan's \\"All Along the Watchtower.\\" The song goes through multiple musical styles, including some \\"jazzy touches.\\" It begins with a Spanish guitar. Steve Lawrence plays a tenor saxophone part to take the song from the verse about the record producer to the verse about the corrupt cop. Bielen describes this sax part as being like the soundtrack of a film noir. Bielen describes the horn part as being \\"spare,\\" stating that it adds an \\"ominous character\\" to the song. Reception In a 2016 Rolling Stone Magazine readers poll, \\"Unknown Legend\\" ranked as Young's 6th-best post-1970s song. In 2014, the editors of Rolling Stone ranked \\"Crime in the City\\" as Neil Young's 82nd greatest song of all time. It reached number 34 on the Billboard Magazine Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Greenwald described it as the \\"centerpiece\\" of Freedom and one of Young's \\"most accomplished works.\\" Rolling Stone critic David Fricke described it as \\"a chilling litany of cynicism and resignation set to a skeletal, almost jazzy gallop and laced with Ben Keith‚Äôs icy steel guitar and the earthy mooing of the Bluenotes‚Äô brass.\\" Musician Hawksley Workman identified \\"Crime in the City\\" as the Neil Young song which influenced him the most, particularly the 2nd verse with its \\"almost somewhat untoward depiction of a scene in the studio with drugs and booze and cigarettes.\\" Workman recalled listening to the song as a youngster wanting to enter the music business and thinking \\"this feels dirty, and I like it, you know?\\" Downing feels the original longer version had more \\"drive\\" than the officially released version. Neil Young's biographer Jimmy McDonough similarly felt that the song worked best in its electric version, which was played faster, and that the final released version omitted some of the song's best verses. Live versions A live version of \\"Crime in the City\\" was released on the 1991 live album Weld. As of 2016 Young had not played the song live in concert since 2003. Both electric and acoustic versions of the original \\"Sixty to Zero\\" are available on bootleg CDs. A seven-minute electric version from a 1988 Jones Beach concert was included on Bluenote Caf√©, released as part of the Neil Young Archives series in 2015. Pitchfork contributor Tyler Wilcox called this performance \\"angry and invigorating as Young got in the 1980s.\\" McDonough felt that the electric Jones Beach performance was the most intense performance of the song he had heard.

The collection of twenty-eight British paintings in the Museo del Prado is one of only two significant collections of British art in Spain - the other is the Museo L√°zaro Galdiano, a private collection influenced by the personal taste of Paula Florido, the wife of its founder Jos√© L√°zaro Galdiano. There is little British art in the former Spanish royal collection due to the English and Scottish Reformations and the ensuing tensions between Spain, England and Scotland. The works entered the collection through both purchase and donation, two in the 1880s and the rest mostly in the 20th century other than two at the end of the 19th century. The twenty-eight works do not include works by continental artists active in England such as Hans Holbein the Younger, John de Critz, Peter Lely, Godfrey Kneller, Daniel Mytens, Simon Dubois and Antony van Dyck, which are classified elsewhere in the Prado collection. Most of the twenty-eight works are portraits produced between 1750 and 1850. Four are by David Roberts, three by Thomas Lawrence and two each by Thomas Gainsborough, John Hoppner, Joshua Reynolds, George Romney and Martin Archer Shee. The remaining eleven artists are represented by a single work each.

It is a subsidiary of South Africa based Promasidor Holdings. The firm's major brands include Cowbell milk, Loya milk, Sunvita cereal, Onga seasoning and Top Tea beverages. The firm introduced the sale of powdered milk in sachets which was later followed by competitors. The firm is a leading producer of milk in Nigeria.(August 2017). Drinking Milk Products in Nigeria. Euromonitor International Sector Capsules.  History  Promasidor Nigeria Limited began operations in Nigeria in March 1993 under the business name of Wonder Foods. Cowbell milk was the first product introduced to the country and it was initially sold at a size similar to the market leader, Peak milk. However, sales generated by the firm's 400 gram powdered milk was not encouraging. To compete with the other milk brands, the firm imported larger packages of milk which are then sold to wholesalers who then scoop the milk from the larger package into smaller polythene bags for resale. This sales and distribution method did get some traction. Thereafter, Cowbell decided to import smaller sachets of milk to target middle and low income earners. This selling strategy increased the firm's revenue. Thereafter, the firm diversified into other sectors such as chocolate drinks, tea and seasonings. In 2010, it recorded an annual turnover of $300 million. In 2003, the firm changed its business name from Wonder Foods to Promasidor to promote uniformity across the group.This Day. (February 5, 2003 Wednesday). Nigeria; Wonder Foods Changes Name to Promasidor. Africa News. Retrieved from Nexis Uni.  Brands  = Powdered milk and cocoa beverages = The first product introduced to the market by Promasidor then trading under Wonder Foods is Cowbell milk which now stands at its flagship product. It was followed by Loya milk introduced to the market in 2004 and then re-packaged in 2010 and lastly, Miksi. Cowbell is the main revenue driver for Promasidor in the powdered milk market sector, in June 2010, the brand held close to 24% share in market volume, tripling the volume of the Miksi. The firm also produces cocoa beverages: Cowbell chocolate milk and Miksi chocolate. These brands compete with Nestle's Milo and Cadbury's Bournvita. Cowbell chocolate was introduced to the market in 2000 and in 2011, it was among the top three cocoa beverage drinks in the country. = Seasoning = In 2004, the firm introduced Onga powdered seasoning produced in four variations of crayfish, chicken, stew and classic. It was the first powdered seasoning produced in Nigeria. In 2010, the firm launched Onga seasoning cubes. = Tea = The firm introduced Top Tea with round tea bags in April 1998.  Marketing  In the early years of trading in Nigeria Promasidor used direct marketing strategies, it encouraged its marketing team to wear company uniforms and to reach out to retailers selling from kiosk at residential quarters or beside streets. Flyers were given to the kiosk owners to paste and sales teams were encouraged to develop relationships with the retailers. The company also promoted targeted adverts to young kids who may have not developed brand loyalty to the older bands. To develop new markets for bulkier purchases, the firm went to bakeries, confectioneries and yogurt manufacturers. The firm also has a history of sponsoring education and youth events such as a yearly math competition began in late 1990s. It also sponsors a yearly mathematics quiz show, Cowbellpedia.

His father was well known as a merchant, economist, and Tory politician and had purchased the Glemham estate shortly before his death in 1691.

Contents Stormhaven is a setting for Mercenaries, Spies and Private Eyes that draws heavily upon pulp fiction of the 1930s and 1940s, including references to Walter B. Gibson's The Shadow, and Lester Dent's Doc Savage. The titular Stormhaven is an estate on Savage Island on Lake Champlain in Vermont owned by Kenneth Allard, president of Allard Technologies, and guarded by high-tech security. Allard's invited visitors include notable people in the field of technology, celebrities, and eccentrics with ties to the Allard clan. The supplement comes in a folder that contains an 8-page booklet of maps, and a 56-page book of scenarios and character descriptions. Reception In the March-April 1984 edition of Space Gamer (Issue No. 68), Aaron Allston gave Stormhaven a thumbs up, saying, \\"I'd recommend you buy Stormhaven if you run MSPE or Espionage!, and would especially recommend it to aficionados of the hero pulps. Gamemasters of other contemporary RPGs, such as James Bond and Top Secret, should give it a look- through. It's fun.\\" In the February 1985 edition of Dragon, Arlen Walker praised the high production values, as well as artwork. Walker also liked the separate book for maps, which meant gamemasters did not have to flip back and forth between scenario description and map. Walker also complimented the character descriptions: \\"The major characters in this book are all completely fleshed out. They come equipped not only with complete descriptions and statistics, but each also has a reason for being on the island and a personality which will guide the character‚Äôs interaction with the player characters.\\" Although Walker found this a very strong supplement for the MSPE system, he also thought the material could and should be easily be adapted to other modern roleplaying systems. He concluded by giving a strong recommendation: \\"Stormhaven gets my vote not only as the best of 1983 but also as one of the half-dozen best of all time. If you role-play in the modern era, regardless of the system, this one‚Äôs a must!\\" Awards Stormhaven was awarded the Charles S. Roberts Award for \\"Best Roleplaying Adventure of 1983\\".

It established provisions for the restoration of the Monarchy of Spain (after being abolished by the Second Spanish Republic in 1931), appointed Francisco Franco as the Head of State of Spain for life, and provided that his successor would be proposed by Franco himself with the title of King or Regent of the Kingdom, but that would have to be approved by the Cortes Espa√±olas. The draft of the Law was sent by the Franco III Government to the Cortes on 28 March 1947. It had a short elaboration process and was approved by the Cortes in its session of 7 June 1947 and submitted to a referendum on 6 July 1947, coming into force on 27 July 1947.  Legal content  The fundamental and key objects of the Law were: :1. Constituting Spain as the Kingdom and as a Catholic state (Article 1: \\"Spain, as a political unit, is a Catholic, social and representative State that, according to its tradition, is declared a Kingdom\\"). :2. Converting the position of Head of State in a position for life in the person of Franco (Article 2: \\"The Head of State corresponds to the Leader of Spain and the Crusade, Generalissimo of the Armies, Don Francisco Franco Bahamonde\\"). :3. Creating the Council of the Realm (Article 4). :4. Establishing the prerogative of the Head of State to propose to the Cortes, at any time, the person who should be called to succeed him, as a King or Regent and its possible revocation. (Article 6: \\"At any time the Head of State may propose to the Cortes the person he considers to be called to succeed him, as a King or Regent, with the conditions required by this Law, and may, likewise, submit to the approval of the former the revocation of the one proposed, even if it had already been accepted by the Cortes\\"). :5. Defining and enumerating for the first time the body of the Fundamental Laws of the Realm that became a substitute for Rigid Constitution, whose repeal demanded the agreement of the Cortes and the confirmation by a referendum (Article 10).  The position of Infante Juan  Infante Juan (pictured in 1946). = The Manifesto of Lausanne = On 19 March 1945, Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona (son of the King Alfonso XIII and legitimate heir to the throne) published the (in Lausanne, Switzerland) in which he harshly criticized the Francoist dictatorship and offered the Spanish people the possibility of restoring a monarchy whose character was poorly defined. In fact, he presented the constitutional monarchy as a moderate alternative to the regime, rejecting the Franco regime inspired by German and Italian totalitarian systems that have failed. He promised, in case of return to the monarchy, the approval of a new constitution, the recognition of human rights, the guarantee of public liberties, the establishment of a democratic legislative assembly, the recognition of the diversity, the amnesty of political prisoners and a fairer distribution of wealth. It is for this reason that Franco hesitated to designate Infante Juan as a possible successor. On 31 March 1947, the then undersecretary of the Presidency Luis Carrero Blanco, envoy of Francisco Franco and editor of the Law of Succession, informed Infante Juan that with the approval of the Law of Succession it would be Franco who would appoint the monarch of the kingdom \\"when he considers it convenient\\". He also told Infante Juan that he could be \\"King of Spain, but of Spain of the Movimiento Nacional, which is Catholic, anti-communist and anti- liberal\\". = The Manifesto of Estoril = On 7 April 1947, Infante Juan published the Manifesto of Estoril (in Estoril, Portugal) in which he denounced the illegality of the Law of Succession, because it was proposed to alter the nature of the monarchy without consulting the heir to the throne.  Referendum  On 6 July 1947 a referendum was held on the Law, in which, according to the official results, the electorate was composed of 16,187,992 voters. Of them, 14,454,426 voted, of which 12,628,983 (89.86% of the voters) voted affirmatively and 643,501 negatively.  Consequences  Francisco Franco (pictured in 1964). From 18 July 1947, by virtue of the Law of Succession, Franco would act as the Head of State of the newly proclaimed Kingdom of Spain, whose throne was vacant and thus would have to remain so at least until the occurrence of what was later called the \\"succession event\\", a euphemism for the death of the dictator. On 25 August 1948, Franco arranged a meeting with Infante Juan, on his holiday yacht ', in the Bay of Biscay. There they agreed that Infante Juan's ten-year-old son, Juan Carlos, born and residing in Rome, Italy would change his residence and complete his education in Spain, along with his brother Alfonso, under the promise of \\"that the monarchist newspaper ABC could inform freely and that the restrictions of monarchist activities would be lifted\\". On 9 November 1948 Juan Carlos was received by Franco at his residence in the Royal Palace of El Pardo, where he informed him that his education would be in charge of a group of professors with firm loyalty to the Movimiento Nacional. As revealed by the documents declassified by the United States Department of State, due to an accident that occurred on 24 December 1961, during a hunt in the forests of El Pardo, Franco begun to consider the election of his succession. As report from the Greek royal court to the US ambassador in Greece indicates: \\"following a hunting accident\\" we are informed that \\"it is in planning to present the question of the royal succession before the Cortes in February. He has not divulged whether he will recommend the Count of Barcelona or his son, Juan Carlos\\"; conforming to what was indicated by the Spanish ambassador Luca de Tena. Juan Carlos as Prince of Spain (pictured in 1971). Finally, on 22 July 1969, Franco designated Juan Carlos (skipping the natural order of succession that corresponded to his father Infante Juan under the law of succession according to which it would be Franco who would name the monarch of the kingdom) as his successor to the Headship of the State, with the title of \\"Prince of Spain\\".Ley 62/1969 Bolet√≠n Oficial del Estado (BOE) He is proclaimed by the Cortes as Franco's successor on the same day, when Juan Carlos took an oath of \\"fidelity to the principles of the National Movement and other Fundamental Laws of the Realm\\".  Aftermath  During the dictatorship, as the Prince of Spain, Juan Carlos acted briefly (from 19 July to 2 September 1974) as the Head of State due to the fragile health of Franco because of Parkinson's disease. Franco died on 20 November 1975, and Juan Carlos was proclaimed head of state and crowned as King of Spain on 22 November 1975 at the Palacio de las Cortes, with the regnal name Juan Carlos I, skipping the natural succession order (which corresponded to his father Infante Juan). As a result, the political reforms transformed the Francoist apparatus into a democratic system whose political form of government is the parliamentary monarchy, with a head of state that is subordinated to the constitution and where its acts have to be endorsed (the King reigns but does not govern), and a parliament elected by the people with which the legislative power rests. It would not be until 14 May 1977 when Infante Juan officially renounced all his dynastic rights (which had been denied by the Law of Succession created by Franco) in favor of his son. The Law of Succession was repealed on 29 December 1978, more than a year and a half after the renouncement of Infante Juan.

In 1959 she got her first job at a newspaper, working for six weeks at the Kalamazoo Gazette. Through personal contacts she then moved to The Kansas City Star where she became education editor until leaving in 1962. She pursued her master's degree at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, with results which put her as third best in the class, and subsequently took up a job as a staff writer at The Washington Post. She considers her ten years at the post as an unhappy period of her life, eventually leaving in 1973. After resigning Beasley finished her PhD in American Civilization from George Washington University, entitled 'The First Women Washington Correspondents', supervised by Letitia Woods Brown. Beasley joined the teaching staff at the University of Maryland back in 1974, and was promoted to assistant professor in 1975. Beasley described herself as the 'token woman' of the faculty, and indeed was not joined on the tenure-track by any other women at the department until about a decade later. She was a founding member of the American Journalism Historians Association (AJHA), and elected their president in 1989 for one year. They awarded her the Sidney Kobre Award for Lifetime Achievement in Journalism History in 1997, the highest honour the society bestows. She was also president of the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication (AEJMC), who awarded Beasley with the 2008 Eleanor Blum Distinguished Service to Research Award. Beasley has also undertaken teaching posts at Jinan University, China as part of a Fulbright Program grant.  Research  Beasley has written about the history of women in journalism and the public spotlight, including with reference to First Ladies of the United States. She has been interviewed by Book TV about her publications on these topics. She was consulted and interviewed about the role of female war correspondents as well as 'Women Pages' in newspapers for the documentary No Place For A Woman about women reporting on WW2. Her book Taking Their Place: Documentary History of Women and Journalism 2nd Edition (co-written with Sheila Gibbons) was awarded a Textbook Excellence Award in 2004 by the Text and Academic Authors Association. She is a scholar of Eleanor Roosevelt, and wrote Eleanor Roosevelt and the Media (1987), Eleanor Roosevelt: Transformative First Lady (2010) and co-edited The Eleanor Roosevelt Encyclopedia (2000). The latter was selected as a top reference book of 2001 by the reviewers Booklist.

It is located at a distance of circa 70 million light years from Earth, which, given its apparent dimensions, means that NGC 7531 is about 95,000 light years across. It was discovered by John Herschel on September 2, 1836.  Characteristics  The inner region of NGC 7531 is characterised by a high surface brightness ring. The ring is a place of active star formation and a number of star clusters and HII regions have been identified in it. The star formation rate of the inner ring is estimated to be 0.41 ¬± 0.12 per year based on H-alpha emission. A weak bar is observed in the near infrared inside the ring, along with dust lanes. Yet, the motions at the inner ring are predominately circular. The inner ring may lie at the location of the inner Lindblad resonance. The galaxy has two patchy spiral arms that are relatively well defined but are of low surface brightness. HII regions have also been observed at the spiral arms of the galaxy, where there is also active star formation, which is more intense at the southwest region. A supermassive black hole is believed to lie in the centre of the galaxy whose mass is estimated to be 3-48 million (107.07¬±0.61) , based on the spiral arm pitch angle. The galaxy is seen with an inclination of 66¬∞. One supernova has been observed in NGC 7531, SN 2012dj. It was a type Ib/c supernova with a peak magnitude of 15.3.List of Supernovae IAU Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams. Retrieved 29 December 2015.  Nearby galaxies  In long exposure photographic plates of the galaxy, a large low surface brightness region structure was observed 2.6 arcminutes west from the nucleus of the galaxy, that has more than half the apparent diameter of NGC 7531. It has been identified as a stellar cloud that may be a dwarf satellite of the galaxy or a shell created by the tidal disruption of NGC 7531. NGC 7531 is a member of the NGC 7582 galaxy group. Other members of the group include NGC 7552, NGC 7582, NGC 7590, and NGC 7599, which are also known as the Grus Quartet, NGC 7496, NGC 7632, and IC 5325. This group, along with the group centred around IC 1459 form the Grus cloud, a region of elevated galaxy density. The Grus cloud, along with the nearby Pavo-Indus cloud, lies between the Local Supercluster and Pavo-Indus Supercluster.

Family and early life Sen was born in Calcutta to an Indian father and English mother. His grandfather was the philosopher and social reformer Keshab Chandra Sen; and his aunt was Suniti Devi, the Maharani of Cooch Behar. At an early age, he moved with his mother, brother and sister to England. He was educated at Rossall School in Fleetwood, Lancashire, where he joined its unit of the Officers' Training Corps. First World War Sen applied for a commission in the Royal Flying Corps in November 1916, but his application was rejected as he was under age. After a period working in a bank, and having now turned 18, he made a second attempt in early 1917. This time he was successful, and he was awarded a temporary honorary commission in the RFC as a second lieutenant, with effect from 24 April 1917. He was ordered to report to the No. 1 School of Military Aeronautics at Reading from the same date. After two months at Reading, followed by 25 hours of elementary flying training and 35 hours in front line aircraft, Sen was posted to the Western Front. He was assigned to No. 70 Squadron RFC, based at Poperinge in West Flanders, Belgium and equipped with the Sopwith Camel. On 7 August 1917, he was appointed a Flying Officer in the RFC with the temporary rank of second lieutenant. A month later, on 14 September, while taking part in an offensive patrol, Sen experienced engine failure and dropped behind the rest of his patrol. As he stated later in a deposition for the War Office, \\"...in attempting to catch up [with the remainder of the patrol, I] was lost in a cloud. Coming out [I] was attacked by 4 enemy machines. Both [fuel] tanks [were] hit & [I] crashed outside Menin. Unwounded.\\" He was interned in Holzminden prisoner-of-war camp for the remainder of the war. He was a participant in the attempted mass escape from the camp on 23/24 July 1918, but was in the escape tunnel when it partially collapsed, resulting in the abandonment of the enterprise. He was eventually repatriated to the UK on 14 December 1918. Postwar years Following his repatriation, Sen was promoted lieutenant on 17 April 1919, and was transferred to the unemployed list of the RAF on 23 May. He returned to India and joined the Indian Imperial Police as an assistant superintendent (junior scale, on probation) with effect from 20 September 1921. By 1925, he was serving in eastern Bengal in the Comilla District (now in Bangladesh). Sen and his brother subsequently relocated to Rangoon, Burma, where they found work. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Sen re-enlisted in the RAF, but was unable to find a means to leave Burma. He tried to walk out of the country, and is believed to have died in the attempt.

Since then, Brenda calls the woman, who took care of her, ‚Äûgrandmother‚Äú. Brenda and her grandma are happy to have each other. Together, they go to the market to sell the candies that Brenda's grandma makes. Furthermore, Brenda befriends with the boy Adrian, who also has a table in the market. On the way home, Brenda admires a doll in the shop window. However, her grandmother tells her that she can not buy the doll now because it is too expensive. At the evening, Brenda's grandmother tells a story of an angel, carrying two candles and a book. Brenda wonders how that is possible, if the angel has only two hands. One day, Brenda's grandmother breaks her leg. She can no longer take care of Brenda. Now Brenda starts to take care of her grandma. She keeps the flat clean and sells the candies on the market. As a Christmas present, Brenda receives the doll she had admired in the shop window. Her grandmother is grateful that Brenda is such a sweet and good child.

It was later released on Swedish and German DVDs. The film was also translated into English and was shown with English subtitles at several film festivals, like the Zl√≠n Film Festival. Reception =Critical response= Anna Zamolska from KinderundJugendmedien.de believes, that the film looks like a beautiful picture book made from Ilon Wikland-illustrations and old photographs. Furthermore, the film had been made very child-friendly. Thus, the film is made with only a few cuts and takes time for ordinary, everyday operations. The close-up of Brenda would give the children the opportunity to empathize with Brenda. In addition, Mathilda Lindgren offers an impressive representation of Brenda. She is convincing from the first scene of the film and acts as naturally in front of the camera as if it was not there. That makes the film still worth seeing today.

It was one of the first works to enter the collection of the Scottish National Gallery in Edinburgh after its bequest in 1859 by the heirs of Thomas Graham. Description One of Gainsboroughs finest portraits, it has become an icon of the Scottish National Gallery. It is one of three works the artist completed of Mary Graham.

She is the author of two novels, An Isolated Incident (2014) and Unmarriageable (2019). The latter is a retelling of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice set in Pakistan in 2000 and 2001. Early life and education Kamal was born in Karachi, Pakistan and attended an English-medium school. She subsequently lived in England and Saudi Arabia, and then attended St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland as an undergraduate, studying philosophy. Writing Kamal published her first novel, An Isolated Incident, in 2014. It is set in Kashmir, the United States, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Reviewing the book for Dawn, Fareeha Rafique wrote, \\"Kamal‚Äôs beautiful use of language is what carries her story.\\" An Isolated Incident was a finalist for the 2016 Townsend Prize for Fiction from The Chattahoochee Review and the Georgia Center for the Book. = Unmarriageable = Kamal's second novel, Unmarriageable, was published January 22, 2019. The retelling of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice features Pakistani English teacher (and Austen fan) Alys Binat and her four sisters, a formerly high- society family that has fallen on comparatively hard times owing to family betrayal. Their mother is anxious to see her daughters married, particularly Alys and Jena (the two eldest), but the task is a challenge as the family has lost most of its money and former social standing. Set in Pakistan in 2000 and 2001, the Binat sisters traverse a diverse Pakistani social and cultural scene as their mother attempts to encourage opportunities to encounter suitors. Jena meets a kind and wealthy man, Fahad Bingla‚Äîaffectionately called \\"Bungles\\"‚Äîbut Bungles' best friend Valentine Darsee and protagonist Alys take a quick dislike to one another, which, along with the intervention of Bungles' snobbish sisters, prevents the pair's budding relationship from moving forward. Jena is heartbroken. Yet, partly through Mrs. Binat's persistence in promoting her daughters' social engagements, the families' social circles keep intersecting and Darsee eventually finds that he has fallen in love with Alys, who shares his love of books as well as a cosmopolitan outlook born of childhoods partly lived abroad. He abruptly proposes marriage, which she rejects, both because of an early insult she overheard him make toward both her appearance and her intelligence, and because his cousin Jeorgeullah Wickaam has recounted to Alys how Darsee cruelly cut Wickaam, an orphan, out of the family will. Desperate to regain Alys's trust, Darsee writes her a letter apologizing for his role in keeping Bungles from Jena as well as confiding the true reason for Wickaam's disinheritance: Wickaam had fathered, then abandoned, numerous children out of wedlock with servant women, and, ultimately with Darsee's sister. Family money allows his sister to travel to Europe to seek an abortion, but the lower-income women he had previously fathered children with did not have this option, nor any support from Wickaam in raising their children, so Darsee and family elect to spend Wickaam's inheritance establishing a school for disadvantaged students that his children could also attend. Darsee comes to the rescue again when it is Alys's party- girl youngest sister, Lady, whose reputation is in trouble: she too runs away with Wickaam, who demands to be paid $100,000 to marry her and restore the Binat sisters' good name. The family has no way to afford the ransom, but Darsee pays it secretly, attending the small wedding ceremony himself to make certain Wickaam would go through with the marriage rather than abscond with the money and abandon Lady as he had the mothers of his children. Alys and Darsee each tell Jena and Bungles they have seriously misjudged the situation and Bungles immediately proposes to Jena. Alys begins to warm to Darsee, particularly after learning he was the one to rescue her youngest sister, and when he proposes again, she accepts.

Darren Soto (D-FL) and Mario D√≠az-Balart (R-FL). It aims to extend temporary protected status to Venezuelan nationals in light of the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis and the crisis in Venezuela in general. The bill was introduced to the House as H.R. 549 on January 15, 2019.  Introduction  Announcing the bill, Washington D.C. said it was a bill introduced because of \\"egregious human rights abuses\\" and \\"an economic, humanitarian, and security crisis\\" in Venezuela. D.C. said that this has caused many Venezuelans to become refugees in foreign countries, and that whilst corruption remains in Venezuela these people should be protected. Soto and D√≠az-Balart each gave statements, both alluding to suffering under Nicol√°s Maduro's presidency, described by Soto as \\"tyrannical\\". Soto said that \\"TPS [is] a way to help protect our brothers and sisters escaping Maduro's terror\\"; D√≠az-Balart said that \\"[w]e must not force Venezuelans who have sought safety in the United States to return to such dangerous conditions\\". A similar bill had been introduced to the Senate of the 115th Congress as S. 3759 in December 2018, which invoked Section 244 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. This bill also aimed to strengthen migration routes in South America to help people immediately trying to exit Venezuela to a neighboring country. United States President Donald Trump did not support this bill, and had been trying to end TPS for months at the time. The bill was re-introduced to the Senate as S. 636 on February 28, 2019. Despite this, Soto, speaking in January 2019, said he believed that the developing conditions in Venezuela had reached a point that Trump may be likely to support his new bill, saying that \\"[i]f there is a country that might get TPS approved by the White House, it would be Venezuela\\". He also suggested Trump may favor the bill because it would be a further sanction against the Maduro administration. D√≠az-Balart said that the bill is \\"in lockstep with [the White House's] \\"aggressive\\" stance against the government of [Maduro]\\".  Proposed protection level  Venezuela TPS Act of 2019 Under the bill, the protection status of Venezuelans in the United States would be quite high. They would not face deportation, be granted work authorization, as well as be able to travel abroad without the threat of not being allowed to return. The bill would automatically apply to all Venezuelans who have been continuously present in the United States at the time of enactment of the law, and would have an 18-month period for others to apply starting on the day it was signed into law. Soto's office believes it will give protection to around 200,000 Venezuelans.  Responses  The Trump Administration said that they would not give TPS to Venezuelans, even though the Americas advocate to Amnesty International, Charanya Krishnaswami, said that Venezuela exemplified what the TPS system was designed for. Multiple people, including Senators in a joint letter, called Trump a hypocrite because of the announcement. Geoff Ramsey from the Washington Office on Latin America said that the wrong message is being sent to Venezuela and Latin America in trying to encourage US support, because refusing TPS whilst decrying the humanitarian situation shows that the \\"administration's concern for Venezuelans ends the instant they leave their country\\". Political commentators believe that introducing the bill will give Trump support in his 2020 re- election campaign from the Venezuelan and Cuban population in the battleground state of Florida. Voting history On July 25, 2019, the bill passed in the House of Representatives. All Democrat members voted in favor, and were joined by 39 Republican members. The Miami Herald had originally suggested it would need the support of 55 House Republicans, but that this number could be reasonably higher or lower depending on how many members were present. A fast- track vote on the Senate bill was introduced five days later, just before the summer recess, in order to quickly align with the House by bypassing procedure, which can be achieved with votes of unanimous consent. However, such votes fail if only one member opposes; Utah Republican Mike Lee opposed the bill and so it will have to be voted on in full after the recess. Three votes were held in the House for the bill: to pass with amendments via suspension of rules and majority vote on July 23rd, which failed 268-145; to add amendments on July 25th, which failed 215-217 shortly before the third vote; to pass the text as submitted on July 25th, which passed 272-158. On September 25, 2019, Florida Republican Senator Rick Scott proposed an amendment to the Temporary protected status designation through an amendment to the 2019 Venezuela Act; he offered to push the bill through the Senate immediately in exchange for holding regular reviews of countries awarded TPS, an overhaul of the renewable nature of the system.

'Azm served as the president of the Ottoman Party for Administrative Decentralization and was a key figure in the intellectual formation of Arabism. Rafiq was born in 1865 in Damascus, Ottoman Empire to the 'Azm family, one of the city's mostly politically and socially influential families. He received an education in French and Arabic in Damascus and Istanbul. As a young man, 'Azm became involved in a group of reformist ulama who believed in restoration of the empire's 1876 constitution. During the reign of Abdul Hamid II 'Azm joined the Young Turks. He later joined the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), an underground organization that advocated for liberal reforms. In 1894 Ottoman authorities began cracking down on constitutionalists and their organizations, including the CUP; in the same year 'Azm fled to Cairo, Egypt. In Egypt, 'Azm met Rashid Rida; together, the two founded the Ottoman Consultation Society (Jam'iyyat al-Shura al-'Uthmaniyya), a diverse, Ottoman focused society that pushed back against Turkish nationalism. 'Azm served as editor of the Arabic-language portion of the OCS's publications and its treasurer. Following the 1908 Young Turk Revolution the society was disbanded; 'Azm visited Istanbul and joined the Ottoman Party for Administrative Decentralization. As part of the Ottoman Party for Administrative Decentralization, Rafiq al- øAzm along with his cousin Haqqi al-Azm opposed proposals to exclude non-Arabs and non-Muslims from the party, pushing for the affirmative inclusion of Jews, Druzes, and Christians in order to best reflect the makeup of Syria. Rafiq, as president, closely associated the party with another opposition party, the Party of Liberty and Union headed by Sadiq Bey, which shared the goal of granting the Arab states increased autonomy. In April 1913, 'Azm on behalf of his party, accepted an invitation to the Arab Congress of 1913, to which he sent two delegates. Rafiq al Azm died on 4 July 1925.

History  After the Chinatown fire of 1900, 37 Japanese businessmen formed the Emergency Japanese Association to help Japanese immigrants who became homeless because of the fire. The organization was soon renamed the Honolulu Japan Merchants Association (Honolulu Nipponjin Shonin Doshikai). Once all of the Japanese immigrants were rehoused and claims were filed with the Hawaiian government, the group changed their focus to issues of trade between Hawaii and Japan that affected issei business owners. In 1908 the organization changed its name again to the Honolulu Japanese Chamber of Commerce, and from 1916 onward they worked out of an office above the Yokohama Specie Bank branch in Honolulu. In 1939, the Honolulu Japanese Chamber of Commerce merged with the Japanese Merchants Association (Chuo Rengo) and the Honolulu Japanese Contractors Association, and changed its name to the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry. During World War II, many Chamber members were arrested and interned either in Hawaii or on the mainland. Since many members were missing, the Chamber's activities were put on hold until 1947, when the organization reactivated. In 1960, the Chamber built an office in Moiliili. It included a cultural hall and tea house. In 1968, the organization became an associate member of the Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii. During the 1980s there was a movement to create a cultural center to preserve Japanese American history in Hawaii.

The poem was first published during 1942 in Hearst Magazine and later in other collections, including the 1948 anthology The Lost Son and Other Poems. The poem takes place sometime during the poet's childhood and features a boy who loves his father, but is afraid of him. The boy is waltzing with his father, who is drunk and described as having battered knuckles and dirty palms. ‚ÄúMy Papa‚Äôs Waltz‚Äù deals with themes of family, relationships, confliction, fear, and love. Like other pieces written by Roethke, ‚ÄúMy Papa‚Äôs Waltz‚Äù draws from the poet's relationship with his father. ‚ÄúMy Papa‚Äôs Waltz‚Äù is considered to be one of Roethke's best works. It fits into the wider context of Roethke's work due to the role the father plays in the narrative. The last line of the poem, ‚ÄúStill clinging to your shirt,‚Äù indicates that the waltz and events that transpired had happened before and would happen again, reinforcing that the boy loves his father, despite the way he is treated.  Background and origin  Roethke began writing poetry while in high school, and began his attempt at approaching poetry more seriously while in graduate school at the University of Michigan. Years before the publication of \\"My Papa's Waltz,\\" Roethke began suffering from manic depression and was hospitalized in 1935. Roethke continued to struggle with his bipolar disorder for the entirety of his career. Roethke is believed to have begun \\"My Papa's Waltz\\" in 1941. The poem was first published in Hearst Magazine in 1942.  Theme and tone  Since its publication critics have provided varying interpretations of \\"My Papa's Waltz.\\" Most critics note that the poem is a tug of war between love and fear. Karl Malkoff asserts that the musical meter of \\"My Papa's Waltz\\" conveys the boy's combined admiration and fear and the father's affection and violence. David Mills describes \\"My Papa's Waltz\\" as a \\"lovely rough tenderness\\" that is meant to make readers feel \\"uncomfortable,\\" and implies that its central theme is the characteristics and dynamic between the father and son, saying, that because his father died when Roethke was still a young man, the poem offers more sentiment in the line: \\"But I hung on like death.\\" The Theodore Roethke Collection at the University of Washington holds two of Roethke's original holographs of \\"My Papa's Waltz,\\" entitled \\"MS-A\\" and \\"MS-B,\\" which John McKenna feels prove that tone was a poetic device to which Roethke paid close attention. It can be found that Roethke changed the gender of the child from a girl to a boy and the word \\"unscrew\\" to \\"unfrown\\" in the revised \\"MS-B\\" version of the poem. McKenna notes that the first change was most likely made so that Roethke could maintain the scary feel that was initially intended in the poem by making the parent and child the same gender while keeping a loving tone throughout the dance. McKenna suggests that Roethke's revision of \\"unscrew\\" could be due to an unwanted sexual undertone regarding the mother, whereas its focus is structured around the father's imposing ruggedness. \\"MS-B\\" also changed the line \\"My forehead scraped a buckle\\" to \\"My right ear scraped a buckle.\\" This was done in order to add a sense of informality to the dance; with the boy's head facing away from the father, the poem reads as more of a spur of the moment imperfect dance between a child and a parent. The tone then switches from positive to negative with revisions made in the fourth stanza, changing the words \\"kept\\" to \\"beat\\" and \\"hand\\" to \\"palm.\\" Both of these revisions allow for a change in tone in regard to painting the father as an assertively dominant figure over the boy. It is in these subtle shifts between positive and negative tones that Roethke is swaying readers back and forth, much like a waltzing rhythm. Through these revisions, Roethke balances negative and positive themes within the waltz taking place and, with this, McKenna argues that there isn't a correct way to read \\"My Papa's Waltz,\\" as no family relationship is easy, and all are \\"seldom one-dimensional.\\" Ronald Jannsen states that the poem ends with the tender scene of a father waltzing his son off to bed, which he states contributes further to the poem's balance. This scene could be interpreted in one of two ways: either a heartfelt ending after and arguably negative climax or that the intense violence will be carried over into the bedroom with an implied sexual connotation, especially considering the implication that the father is drunk. Neither endings to Roethke's tale is confirmed; however, both serve two different interpretive tones. The challenge of determining the overall tone and what is actually happening derives from the sense of amusement and merriment that comes with Roethke's word choice, the feelings most associate with dancing, and that the poem reads as though the dance is a consensual act of roughhousing that many fathers and sons do. Some critics have argued that the violence displayed in the poem is psychological rather than physical, given that in his adulthood, Roethke recites an event that remains unclear as to whether he was abused or not.  Rhythm and metre  \\"My Papa's Waltz\\" is made up of an iambic rising rhythm, with stressed and unstressed beats that match the three-beat rhythm of a waltz. The poem has been described as a dance itself and, beneath its surface, the poem's rhythmical elements guide the narrative in its balance between positive and negative thematic interpretations. Discussing Roethke's prose, Carolyn Kizer states that Roethke set himself a certain expectation of which he was determined to replicate the tone and set the scene of the dance with his father as a child for his readers, and in order to do so he had to implement each poetic device regarding word choice and form. His goal with writing \\"My Papa's Waltz\\" was to show what was going on and recapture the feelings that were lived through, not just by simply writing about it. An extra unstressed syllable on the word \\"dizzy\\" is the first instance in which the rhythm has been disrupted in a hypermetric line, throwing it off balance, like the boy during the waltz. This same effect happens with the words \\"slid from\\" when the pans slide from the kitchen shelf in the second stanza. This line begins with a trochee, changing the rhythm from rising to falling. In an analysis addressing the rhythm of Roethke's works, Sandford Pinsker suggests that the \\"metric formality\\" of \\"My Papa's Waltz\\" takes the disorganized rhythms of a tensely emotional experience and cushions it with a sense of cheerful tones, ultimately serving up a satiric wit in its four stanzas. Roethke's word choice, syntax, and the other elements used to create the rhythm in \\"My Papa's Waltz\\" are considered to be the devices that make up the experience of the waltz itself. These devices include the poem's slightly fabricated prosody that allows readers to connect with boy on a personal level as he dances with his father into the kitchen under frightening and loving circumstances.  Critical reception  Some critics believe that Roethke's struggle with his mental health allowed for him to have a profound outlook on reality, in which he sought to find his place in the world and was granted a \\"mythical insight\\" through the highs and lows of his episodic depression. With this insight, it's said that in his writing Roethke implements the most basic elements of one having lived through divine maturity: \\"outward journey,\\" \\"inward growth,\\" and a \\"loving relationship.\\" As with other works in his collected poetry, \\"My Papa's Waltz\\" is Roethke taking himself back into another phase of his life to confront that which he couldn't in the past. Most critics today recognize the poet's attempt at a tonal balance between fear and delight, and its implement of a rocking rhythm in its metre and rhyme-scheme. Critics have noted Roethke's use of a joyfully frolicsome rhythm regarding a poem centered on a child's waltz. \\"Romped\\" and \\"dizzy\\" are two words used in the poem that most associate with childlike behavior, and it's because of Roethke's diction and word choice that, for years, his readership have overlooked an overarching theme surrounding the poem. Comparing the consistency of the two dominant tones, John Ciardi argues that \\"My Papa's Waltz\\" is a \\"poem of terror\\" because of the boy's unresponsive unease and the fact that during a supposed good-natured dance he is hurt by his father. His interpretation suggests that the boy's dizzying and the pans sliding off of the kitchen shelf suggests that the waltz described is not a pleasant one, where traditionally the word \\"romp\\" would imply a reaction from glee. Ciardi considers the mother's frown, the belt buckle scraping the boy's ear and the boy being struck by his fathers rough hands, and says that the two are romping, yet, until the boy is \\"dumped into bed\\" he must \\"cling like death.\\" Some have urged that the ideas expressed in the poem are a proclamation of animosity towards the poet's father, while other critics have suggested there is an ironic uncertainty, for Roethke's apprehension spawns from feelings of love and hatred clashing with one another throughout his youth and time with his father. Because of the ongoing debate between those who view the thematic elements of \\"My Papa's Waltz\\" in a positive light and those who deem it a traumatic memory, the poem has been both praised and denigrated by critics. George Wolff has compared \\"My Papa's Waltz\\" to other works by Roethke, such as \\"Dolor\\" and \\"The Geranium,\\" saying that these, and poems included in \\"Meditations of an Old Woman,\\" \\"In a Dark Time,\\" and \\"The North American Sequence,\\" are \\"his best and most representative work[s].\\"  Remedial usage  In analytical psychology, \\"My Papa's Waltz\\" and other pieces published in The Lost Son and Other Poems are used as a means of psychotherapy to treat those suffering from alcohol dependence. W. D. Snodgrass claims that Roethke's poems exemplify that human reason and motive are hidden under human emotion in youth and into adulthood, stating that \\"My Papa's Waltz\\" allows its reader to approach and reflect on their own personal memories that they've lived through during youth in a manner that remains true to the structure and diction of the Roethke's poem.

The company employs roughly 35,000 people in two semiconductor factories in South Korea. In the decades following Samsung's entrance into semiconductor fabrication, many of its workers developed serious illnesses, including leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple sclerosis (MS). Beginning in 2007, the families of the impacted workers, with the help of a variety of domestic and international organizations, organized and mobilized against Samsung in the form of various protests and legal challenges. This organized opposition lasted for over a decade and largely concluded upon the signing of a binding settlement agreement between Samsung and the relevant opposition leader. Additionally, Samsung issued a public apology and acceptance responsibility for causing an increased risk of serious illness in its semiconductor factories.  Background  Samsung first entered the semiconductor fabrication business in 1974 by acquiring Korea Semiconductors. By 1993, Samsung was the world's largest producer of memory chips and it has retained that title ever since. Samsung's Giheung facility, which began operations in 1984, is currently the largest semiconductor fabrication facility in all of South Korea and employs a workforce of over 20,000 people. The semiconductor fabrication process necessitates the use of a variety of chemicals and carcinogenic substances. At various points in the process, workers are required to dip components in chemical baths, utilize X-ray radiation, and engage in various other production techniques that expose them to potentially harmful chemicals. In the 1980s and 1990s, the semiconductor industry was subject a variety of criticisms for creating potential health hazards in their fabrication facilities. A number of Samsung's US-based competitors were found to have statistically greater serious illness incidence rates among their semiconductor workforces, which led to increased monitoring, safety standards, and protection for semiconductor workers in the US and many other countries. Samsung, however, has historically declined to release the relevant health data and information on the environment in its semiconductor plants. This decision has been facilitated by the South Korean government's regulations protecting trade secrets that have allowed the company to withhold relevant information, such as the types of chemicals used in semiconductor production, despite numerous attempts to have it made public. Studies and reports released decades after Samsung's entry into semiconductor fabrication showed that the company has a long history of questionable health and safety practices. It was discovered that Samsung semiconductor workers' exposure to radiation was significantly beyond the acceptable levels recognized by US regulators. Moreover, it was found that Samsung neglected to actually check the chemical composition of substances used in its semiconductor fabrication process, and that the company failed to conduct exposure assessments for 71% of chemicals utilized in production. Other investigations suggested the company continued to use harmful substances even after stating it would no longer use them. For example, internal documents showed that Samsung was using TCE, a known toxic substance, as recently as 2010 despite the company publicly stating it had not been a part of the fabrication process since 1995. As such, there have a great deal of cases of serious illness being developed in Samsung's manufacturing workforce over the decades after it first entered the semiconductor market. However, prior to the organization of an opposition movement, no court in South Korea had ordered Samsung to pay compensation for causing illness in any of its workers.  Death of Hwang Yu-mi and beginnings of opposition movement  On March 6, 2007, Hwang Yu-mi, a 22-year old woman working Samsung's Giheung semiconductor plant, died from leukemia. She began working at Samsung in 2003 as an operator on one of the assembly lines. She initially worked on the diffusion process, which involves exposure to carcinogenic substances like benzene and TCE, and later began working on the \\"wet etching\\" process, which involves repeatedly dipping components in chemical baths. In October of 2005 she began complaining about fits of dizziness and nausea, so the factory's infirmary physicians sent her to the hospital where she was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia. She began chemotherapy treatment and after additional treatment her cancer went into remission in the summer of 2006. Despite this, Yu-mi relapsed in January of 2007 and died three months later. = Hwang Sang- ki = Yu-mi's father, Hwang Sang-ki, was a taxi driver with little education living in Sokcho. After the onset of his daughter's illness, Sang-ki learned that Yu-mi's roommate had recently died from a condition similar to that of his daughter's, leading him to believe there could be a connection between Yu- mi's work and her illness. Sang-ki subsequently informed Samsung of his intent to file a worker's compensation claim in early 2007 in an attempt to receive help with his daughter's increasing medical expenses, but was met with resistance by Samsung. According to Sang-ki, in a meeting with a group of the company's relevant managers he was met with hostility and complete denial of any link between Samsung and his daughter's condition. Soon after his daughter's death, Sang-ki was informed by Samsung that he and his family would receive no compensation. Despite this, Sang-ki firmly believed there was a connection between the working conditions at Samsung's semiconductor plant and the death of his daughter, so he began his own efforts to investigate and prove his theory. In June of 2007, Sang-ki filed a compensation claim with the Korean Workers Compensation and Welfare Service (KCOMWEL). This was the first such claim for a semiconductor worker ever filed with KCOMWEL. In an attempt to build support for his claim, Sang-ki contacted a variety of parties he thought could potentially have some sort of information on the conditions of Yu-mi's workplace and whether other workers at the Giheung factory had developed illnesses, but was often denied access to information and was unsuccessful in gathering useful information. It was during this process that Sang-ki was introduced to a labor activist and attorney named Lee Jong-ran, who was aware of miscarriages in semiconductor workers at Samsung. Together, Sang-ki and Jong-ran were able to procure funds from a number of interested groups to form an organization dedicated to investigating and fighting the lack of compensation and public information on Samsung's role in the illnesses of its semiconductor workers. Around the same time, Sang-ki began protesting outside Samsung facilities with an enlarged picture of his daughter while distributing pamphlets and asking any people with relevant information to speak out. Eventually, people began coming forward and an increasingly large group of impacted families began organizing demonstrations. = Banolim/SHARPS = The organization created by Hwang Sang-ki and Lee Jong-ran was called Banolim, translated as Supporters for Health and Rights of People in Semiconductor Industry (SHARPS). In addition to promoting and supporting a strategy of non-violent demonstration, Banolim helped families follow Sang- ki's example of filing compensation claims with KCOMWEL and funded their legal challenges. In an effort to demonstrate the prevalence of situations similar to that of Hwang Sang-ki and his family, SHARPS also began a project of collecting and publicizing information on current and former Samsung workers who had contracted serious illnesses. Banolim worked with both domestic and international groups to compile as much data as possible on the incidence of serious diseases in semiconductor workers in order to disseminate accurate information and statistics that the group feels should be incorporated into the public debate. In the years since its creation, Banolim has thus far been able to document 320 cases of work-related diseases reported by Samsung's semiconductor workers and 118 deaths.  Legal victories of the opposition  In 2009, Sang-ki's compensation claim, along with those of a number of other Banolim-supported families, was rejected by KCOMWEL. The agency claimed that it was unable to establish a link between Samsung and the incidence of illness in the workers, although it did not publicize the raw data used in its statistical analyses. In response, Sang-ki filed an appeal of the agency's decision in the South Korean courts and the appeal was merged with that of other families of impacted Samsung workers whose claims were similarly denied by KCOMWEL. KCOMWEL's defense against the appeal was funded not only by the Samsung but by government as well. Soon after the appeal was filed, there was a leak of internal documents from Samsung that contained a non-public list of chemicals utilized in tasks like those assigned to Hwang Yu-mi. There was also a report released by Seoul University on the Giheung plant that claimed Samsung used a variety of dangerous chemicals without informing its employees, failed to properly remove toxic gases, and failed to maintain detection systems allowing for numerous malfunctions during gas leaks. = First appeal ruling (2011) = In 2011, the South Korean courts overturned KCOMWEL's decision and ruled in favor of Sang-ki's and another families claim for compensation, although it rejected the claims of a few other families. The court ordered a government compensation fund, which was paid into by South Korean corporations including Samsung, to pay the families that won. This marked a very significant moment for Banolim and the opposition movement, as a government court had formally stated that Samsung played a role in the illnesses developed by many of its semiconductor workers. The victory of Hwang Sang-ki prompted dozens of other families to file claims with KCOMWEL with the help of Banolim.  Responses by Samsung and Banolim  In response to the reversal of KCOMWEL's decision by the courts, Samsung hired the consulting firm Environ to examine the conditions of its semiconductor fabrication facilities. The report given to Samsung by Environ asserted there was no link between the company and its workers maladies, and Samsung refused to take responsibility despite the court's ruling. There was also no public apology to the families from Samsung following the ruling. Following their legal victory, Banolim and its supporters focused on urging KCOMWEL not to further appeal the court's decision, thus delaying the restitution process even further. From July 5th to July 7th, protesters conducted a sit-in in the KCOMWEL office building in an effort to pressure the agency into not appealing. After meeting with the Chair of KCOMWEL, the protesters disbanded in order to wait for a decision. On July 12th, it was made public that KCOMWEL had decided to appeal the decision of the court. Following the news, protesters resumed their sit-in both outside and inside the KCOMWEL offices to try to force a withdrawal of the appeal, as well as public release of the Environ report and the raw data used. Hwang Sang-ki was one of the leaders of the protest. = KCOMWEL appeal ruling and Samsung apology (2014) = Despite KCOMWEL's appeal, the South Korean courts upheld the ruling to reverse the original KCOMWEL decision denying compensation. Soon after the ruling was handed down Samsung publicly apologized and promised to provide compensation (separate from KCOMWEL funds) to its workers and surviving families of those who developed serious illnesses. However, Samsung also made clear that it does not acknowledge any claims linking the company's semiconductor production processes to serious illnesses as legitimate. Samsung also stated that it would no longer involve itself in the lawsuits between KCOMWEL and the families of its workers and that it would provide families of impacted workers with the necessary documents to file for compensation going forward. Following the ruling, Samsung set up a compensation fund of 100 billion won (~$88 billion USD) and invited Banolim to participate in negotiations over how to administer the funds.  Representation in popular culture  The movement initiated by Hwang Sang-ki and Banolim against Samsung garnered significant public attention in the years following its initiation. In 2010, South Korea's largest TV station, KBS, nationally televised a report of the protests and opposition led by Sang- ki and Banolim. This prompted an increase not only in public attention but in the number of claims filed with KCOMWEL. Public attention greatly increased after the success of Sang-ki's appeal of the KCOMWEL decision. For example, soon after the decision a documentary about the conditions in Samsung's semiconductor facilities and the stories of Hwang Sang-ki, as well as other families, began production. Titled The Empire of Shame, the documentary was shown at film festivals in South Korea, as well as other countries. = Another Promise (2014) = Another film also began production after the successful appeal in 2011. Also released in 2014, Another Promise is a fictional movie entirely based on Hwang Sang-ki's struggle against Samsung. The movie focuses on Hang Sang-gu, a taxi driver opposing a corporation called \\"Jinsung\\" after the death of his daughter, Han Yoon-mi. Illustrating the popular support for Hwang Sang-ki's efforts, the movie was the first in South Korean history to be produced using only crowdfunded money. Over 7,000 people and roughly a hundred small firms contributed approximately 1.3 billion won towards the production of the movie. The film's initial title was \\"Another Family,\\" which is a reference to one of Samsung's previous slogans, but it was later changed by the filmmaker.  Sit-in at Samsung HQ (2015-2018)  In October of 2015, protesters led and organized by Hwang Sang-ki and Banolim initiated a non-violent sit-in protest beneath Samsung's headquarters in Seoul. Protest tactics included dressing in the protective clothing worn by workers in semiconductor plants and displaying pictures of Samsung semiconductor workers who had died after developing serious illnesses. The protesters also conducted public memorials and candlelight rallies in order to attract further attention. Also present during the protests was a papier mach√© figure of Hwang Yu-mi, making reference to the origins of this instance of organized opposition against Samsung. The catalyst for the sit-in was the breakdown of talks between Samsung and Banolim over the administration of the compensation fund set up by Samsung after its 2014 apology. Despite hearing the conditions of Banolim and the impacted families, Samsung ultimately imposed a compensation framework that, at least in Banolim's opinion, was not acceptable to the families of its workers. Banolim asserted that Samsung was placing too many restrictions on qualifying for compensation and unfairly imposing a December of 2015 deadline for applying to receive compensation. The group also felt that 100 billion won was not enough to compensate all the impacted families and that Samsung needed to officially accept responsibility for contributing to the incidence illnesses in workers at its semiconductor facilities. Lacking a response from Samsung, the sit-in went on for over 1,000 days and garnered a great deal of attention. Throughout the sit-in, Banolim conducted nightly \\"talk rallies,\\" during which invited speakers informed the protesters about a variety of relevant topics. The protesters also created a shrine to the Samsung workers who died after working in semiconductor fabrication. Roughly ten months into the sit-in, the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and Hazardous Materials publicly questioned the South Korean government for withholding relevant information from the families of Samsung workers and spoke out against Samsung's treatment of its workers in semiconductor plants. Soon after, the Associated Press released a detailed investigative report on the conditions faced by workers in Samsung's semiconductor facilities and the help that Samsung has received from the South Korean government to cover up any potentially harmful information. On the 600th day of the protest, the Secretary-General of the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) visited the protest site to support their cause and raised the issue in a meeting with President Moon Jae the following day. A few months later, the ITUC published a report titled \\"Samsung - Modern Tech, Medieval Conditions\\" as a part of its \\"End Corporate Greed\\" campaign. On the 776th day of the sit-in, which coincided with the ten-year anniversary of the creation of Banolim, a widely covered press conference was held with Banolim and activists from more than 100 other groups during which they once again called for Samsung to take responsibility and fairly compensate the workers' families. In July of 2018, 1,000 protesters joined together and formed a ring around the Samsung HQ to commemorate the 1,000th day of the sit-in protest. Less than a month after this, Samsung contacted Banolim to reinitiate compensation discussions and the company agreed to enter into binding mediation. Shortly after this, the sit-in protest disbanded after 1,023 days.  Agreement between Samsung and protesters (2018)  In October of 2018, the binding mediation process yielded a signed agreement between Samsung and Banolim. A signing ceremony was held between Hwang Sang-ki, as a representative of Banolim, and Samsung executives to publicize the settlement. The President and CEO of Samsung Device Solutions issued a public apology in which he conceded that Samsung had not properly protected its workers against health risks and that the company had not responded to the issues in a timely enough manner. Under the agreement, Samsung committed to pay 150 million won to each of its current and former workers upon the condition that they are found to have illnesses due to work-related exposure to dangerous substances. The agreement also extends to contractors employed by Samsung and those who suffered miscarriages. All current and former employees and contractors that have worked in Samsung's semiconductor fabrication facilities since 1984 are eligible to apply for compensation under the agreement and Samsung has committed to compensating all the impacted parties by 2028. In response to the apology, Hwang Sang-ki stated, \\"No apology would be enough given the deception and humiliation we experienced from Samsung over the past 11 years, the pain of losing loved ones,\\" but indicated he was pleased at the successful effort to procure adequate compensation. Hwang Sang-ki and Banolim have also stated there still remains the lack of publicized information about the substances Samsung utilized in its semiconductor plants.

Early life Moore was born in Ossining in Westchester County on September 18, 1843. He was the son of Benjamin Moore (1818‚Äì1886) and Mary Elizabeth (n√©e Sing) Moore (1820‚Äì1895). His younger siblings were brother Casimir de Rham Moore, and sister Katherine T. Moore. His father was the eldest son of Catharine (n√©e Taylor) Moore and Clement Clarke Moore, today known as the author of the Christmas poem \\"A Visit from St. Nicholas\\". His paternal grandfather was the son of Bishop Benjamin Moore, the head of the Episcopal Diocese of New York and President of Columbia University. His paternal grandmother was a descendant of the Van Cortlandt family. His aunt Margaret Moore, and after her death, his aunt, Mary Clarke Moore, were married to John Doughty Ogden of the Ogden family. His father's first cousin, Nathaniel Fish Moore, also served as president of Columbia University from 1842 to 1849. Career The Moore Mansion in the family's Chelsea estate, painted by Moore aunt, Mary Clarke (n√©e Moore) Ogden, in 1855. During the Civil War, Moore was a major in the Union Army. Following the War, he was a cotton broker until he received his share of his grandfather's estate in 1901, at which point he moved to Paris with his family. =Chelsea estate= Moore inherited his grandfather's estate, named Chelsea, located on the west side of the island of Manhattan above Houston Street, which was mostly open countryside before the 1820s. It had been owned by his grandfather's maternal grandfather, Maj. Thomas Clarke, a retired British veteran of the French and Indian War (the North American front of the Seven Years' War). Clarke named his house for the Royal Hospital Chelsea in London that served war veterans. His grandfather inherited the property from his mother, Charity Clarke Moore in 1813. In 1883, the elder Moore was offered $40,000 for the Chelsea farm. He seriously considered selling, but decided to keep the property and its value grew exponentially as the area developed. The estate was later passed down to his father, Benjamin Moore, and then to Moore and his family upon his father's death. The contemporary Manhattan neighborhood is known as Chelsea after his estate. =Society life= In 1892, Moore and his wife were both included in Ward McAllister's \\"Four Hundred\\", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in The New York Times. Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom. Mrs. Moore was \\"the first society woman to ride a bicycle in Newport.\\" Personal life In 1879, Moore was married to Laura Martha Williams (1856‚Äì1919). Laura was the daughter of William S. Williams of New York City and Mrs. Martha Church Williams, of Philadelphia. In New York, they lived at 57 East 54th Street, and in Paris, they lived at 82 Avenue Monceau. Together, Clement and Laura were the parents of: * Mary Elizabeth Moore (1879‚Äì1883), who died young. * Clement Clark Moore (1881‚Äì1883), who died young. * William Scoville Moore (1882‚Äì1944), a real estate dealer and an organizer with President Franklin D. Roosevelt of the Warm Springs Foundation in Georgia and who married Edith Pulitzer (1886‚Äì1975), daughter of Joseph Pulitzer, in 1911. * Barrington Moore Sr. (1883‚Äì1966), a forester who was married to Muriel Hennen Morris, the daughter of Frances Isabel Morris (then wife of Lewis Cass Ledyard) and Thurlow Weed Barnes, in 1910. * Benjamin Moore (1886‚Äì1938), who married Alexandra Emery (1894‚Äì1983), sister of Lela, Audrey, Thomas, and John Emery, in 1920. After his death in 1938, she remarried to Robert McKay. A month after his wife suffered a stroke of paralysis, Moore died of pneumonia at the Hotel Belmont in New York City on December 15, 1910. After a funeral held at St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church, he was buried at Dale Cemetery in Ossining. His wife, who later lived at 960 Park Avenue in New York City, died in Saratoga Springs, New York in 1919. =Descendants= Through his son William, he was the grandfather of four boys, Adrian P.

An early design for the present church was by Bernardo Vittone. History and Description The church was meant to physically replace the smaller church of Santissimo Salvatore, which was a chapel annexed to the castle in the city center. However, because the Count of the town denied them the use of the former site, a new lot was acquired. The original design was by Michela di Agli√®, and construction began in 1749. Originally conceived as a church with a central area with an imposing cupola, staircase entry, and triangular bell-tower, the design had to be modified to accommodate a limited budget, since some of the funds were transferred to the refurbishment of San Martino, and building was delayed by legal difficulties. In 1760, the obstacles to construction were overcome, when the older parish church was threatened with material collapse. A new design was elicited from the architect Bernardo Vittone, but construction was started posthumously in 1773, since Vittone had died in 1770. Funds remained tight, and Vittone's design was never quite completed, trimming the prominent dome. The church was finally inaugurated in December 1793, although revolutionary events delayed consecration until 1825. In 1935, the church was in need of restoration due to water infiltration from the roof, leading to an attempt to construct a dome, as originally planned. The facade and interiors were also restored, with work completed in 1937. Work on the facade continued until 1940.[http://www.borgomasino.net/cms/la-parrocchiale-del-santissimo- salvatoreEntry cited in the Comune Tourist entry.

It was founded in 1934, and operates on the basis of Christian principles, with respect for all faiths. History Though they had facilitated recreational activities for children on the shores of Fern Lake since 1931, Vernon and Maggie Hilliard officially founded Camp Fern in 1934 with the addition of residential cabins built from logs sourced from the surrounding area. A five-week, all-girls session began each summer, followed by a five-week, all-boys session. The original activities offered, including English horseback riding, swimming, canoeing, riflery, archery, arts & crafts and educational programs on the natural ecosystem of the Piney Woods of East Texas, all remain. Through the years, more have been added - including water skiing, tennis, boxing, fencing, drama and a ropes course. Additionally, Camp Fern seeks to provide unique cultural experiences - such as the 2015 visit from the Bolshoi Ballet from Moscow, Russia. Since the beginning, a focal point of camp life at Fern has been tribal competition - in which all campers join one of two tribes (Bena or Owaisso at girls' camp, Caddo or Tejas at boys' camp) that are pitted against each other in a variety of contests throughout the session. On the last night of camp, the result of the session- long competition is announced by revealing that year's \\"feather\\" - painted in the winning tribe's color - on a wooden plaque that resembles a Native American headdress. In 1985, Camp Fern reduced the length of the all-girls and all-boys sessions to four weeks apiece, and added a two-week co-ed session for younger children. Tribal competition is also a part of the co-ed experience, though the rivalry between its two tribes (Cherokee and Apache) is not as intense. Today, Camp Fern is owned and operated by the third and fourth generations of the founding family. For the past ten years, it has received the Safety First designation from the Markel Insurance Company. In 2008, the remake of Friday the 13th was partially filmed at Fern.

Activism On November 18, 2018, Sepideh Qolian, who had previously worked with several publications as a citizen journalist, was reporting on a labor protest organized by the Workers Union of Haft Tappeh Sugarcane Agro Industrial Company (Persian: ÿ¥ÿ±⁄©ÿ™ ŸÜ€åÿ¥⁄©ÿ± ŸáŸÅÿ™‚Äåÿ™ŸæŸá), when she was arrested by the Iranian security forces. Union spokesman Esmail Bakhshi and a dozen other trade unionists were also arrested during the protest. All of those arrested, except Qolian and Bakhshi, were released within days. Qolian and Bakhshi were held without charge or legal representation for 30 days and were eventually released on bail. Torture On November 29, 2018, while Qolian and Bakhshi were still detained, The Vahed Syndicate, a trade union representing over 17,000 transit workers, revealed in a statement that Esmail Bakhshi had been briefly hospitalized due to torture he had suffered while in government custody. Immediately upon release, Qolian confirmed that both she and Bakhshi had been subjected to torture by the security forces. Following their release on bail, Bakhshi and Qolian gave Amnesty International an account of the torture they suffered while in custody of police and ministry of intelligence officials in the cities of Shush and Ahvaz. They told Amnesty that they had been beaten, slammed against walls, shoved to the ground, humiliated with flogging, and threatened with sexual assault and murder. Qolian stated that during her daily interrogation sessions, which started around 10am and lasted until the early hours of the following morning, intelligence officials repeatedly subjected her to sexual insults such as \\"whore‚Äù, accused her of having sexual relationships with workers, and threatened to make sure that her family would receive information that would make them murder Sepideh for \\"honor\\". This revelation led to immense public backlash, especially on Iranian social media. In response to public outrage various Iranian state organizations issued denials of Qolian's accusations and characterized her and Bakhshi as instruments of foreign interest. On January 19, 2019 the Iranian state television broadcast what it claimed to be a documentary showing that Qolian, Bakhshi, and other activists have connections to the Trump administration, communist groups and other Iranians in diaspora who pursue overthrowing of the Iranian regime. The broadcast, recorded during their detention, contained videos of a visibly distraught Qolian and Bakhshi confessing to their crimes against the state. Qolian responded on Twitter that this broadcast is by itself further proof of torture. Farzaneh Zilabi, Bakhshi's attorney, described the broadcast of statements obtained from her client under duress as a violation of the law. ‚ÄúBroadcasting of this documentary is unjustifiable and unacceptable. Now that the confidential information in this fake case have been made public through a deceptive, selective and unfair documentary, Mr. Bakhshi demands a public and transparent trial.‚Äù According to Zilabi, the broadcast was a violation of Article 96 of Iran's Criminal Procedures Regulations, which prohibits and criminalizes to reveal the identity and images of suspects before conviction.

According to Amnesty International, the timing of their arrest strongly suggests it is an attempt to silence and punish them for speaking out about the abuse they suffered in custody. In a phone interview, Qolian's father told a reporter: \\"At 7 in the morning, 12 male and 2 female officers violently raided my home, broke my son's teeth, assaulted me and my wife, and told us they'd kill our daughter.\\" Abolfazl Ghadyani, A former veteran Islamic revolutionary turned dissident, singled out Ali Khamenei as the main culprit behind all wrongdoings and injustices against Bakhshi and Qolian.

Description  Sprucetop grama is a small drought tolerant bunchgrass that grows to around tall in the wild. Under ideal conditions the plant can grow up to tall and exhibit turfgrass characteristics. Flowers are spikate, notable for their bright orange anthers, and are sent up in July through August. Seeds are set and spread September through October, although Sprucetop can also be propagated through rootstock. Flowers grow on racemes containing 3 to 7 spikes. Each spike bears between 7 and 13 perfect spikelets. Leaves are mostly basal with short sheathes and are mildly furrowed. Roots are strong and fibrous, but lack a central taproot.  Distribution  Sprucetop grama is found chiefly in northern Mexico and in the desert foothills of southern Arizona. Field research showed that sprucetop preferred shallow slopes with acidic clay soils. Sprucetop was usually found growing among other drought tolerant prairie grasses, such as Bouteloua hirsuta and Hilaria belangeri. It represents an important forage crop for cattle grazing.

It is a woolly, spreading shrub with its leaves arranged in four rows and off-white, bell-like flowers with dark purple streaks. Description Pityrodia lanuginosa is a spreading shrub which grows to a height of about and has branches densely covered with woolly hairs. The leaves are narrow egg-shaped to lance-shaped, usually long, wide, mostly smooth on the upper surface and have prominent veins on the lower surface. The flowers are arranged singly in upper leaf axils with leaf-like bracts and leafy, narrow lance-shaped bracteoles long at their base. The sepals are joined for about half their length to form a bell-shaped tube with five lance-shaped, slightly hairy lobes long. The five petals are off-white, long and joined to form a bell-shaped tube with five lobes on the end. The two upper lobes have dark purple streaks and are about long and the lower middle lobe is larger than the others. The petal tube and lobes are mostly glabrous apart from a dense hairy ring below the stamens. The four stamens extend beyond the end of the tube, the lower pair slightly longer than the other one. Flowering occurs mainly from January to June and is followed by an oval- shaped, hairy, fruit long and about wide. Taxonomy and naming Pityrodia lanuginosa was first formally described in 1979 by Ahmad Abid Munir from a specimen collected near El Sharana in Arnhem Land. The description was published in Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Gardens. Distribution This pityrodia occurs in Arnhem Land including in the Kakadu National Park and Nitmiluk National Park. Conservation Pityrodia lanuginosa is classified as \\"least concern\\" under the Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 2000.

As a terminal degree, it prepares the holder for administrative, research, academic or professional positions in the criminal justice field at both public and private institutions. History The Doctor of Criminal Justice was first identified as a type of research doctorate by the National Science Foundation in its 1996 Survey of Earned Doctorates . With no respondents, the credential disappeared from subsequent surveys. The Doctor of Criminal Justice degree finally materialized in 2017. There are currently three regionally accredited Doctor of Criminal Justice degree programs in the United States. The first in the United States was approved for launch in 2017 at the California University of Pennsylvania, accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education In 2018, Saint Leo University launched the second available Doctor of Criminal Justice program, accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Finally, Northcentral University also launched a Doctor of Criminal Justice program in 2018, accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. As a relatively new type of doctorate, specific requirements for the Doctor of Criminal Justice vary. For example, the California University of Pennsylvania's Doctor of Criminal Justice can be completed with an accelerated two years of coursework (42 credits beyond master's or Juris Doctor) with an extensive written professional dissertation, defense, and comprehensive exam.. Saint Leo University's Doctor of Criminal Justice program takes three and a half years to complete, and also includes a written dissertation and defense, bringing the first two D.C.J. degrees closer to the notion of research-based degrees. Comparisons of the D.C.J. with other related doctorates in the United States Comparison to Ph.D. Compared to a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D) in Criminal Justice/Criminology which is focused on theoretical research, the D.C.J. is primarily a professional, applied degree for practitioners in the criminal justice field. In this sense, it is comparable to other research- based professional doctorates, such as the Doctor of Education (Ed.D), Doctor of Business Administration (D.B.A.), and Doctor of Psychology (Psy.D.) degrees. In theory, the two degrees are expected to constitute overlapping but distinct categories, where the D.C.J. is a degree that prepares criminal justice practitioners who can solve problems using existing knowledge, and the PhD is the more theoretical of the two as a traditional social science research degree that prepares students for careers as scholars and academics, often from a particular disciplinary perspective. Comparison to D.Crim. and Crim.D. Another related degree identified by the National Science Foundation in 1996 is the Doctor of Criminology (D.Crim.). The D.Crim. designation has not historically been used in the United States, and its use is not well- established elsewhere. For example, there is evidence to suggest that the D.Crim. term is sometimes used interchangeably with the Ph.D. In practice, it is more likely that a theoretical D.Crim. or Crim.D. naming convention could be used interchangeably with the D.C.J than the Ph.D. The fields of criminology and criminal justice overlap heavily . Applying knowledge from the field of criminology in a practical context generally happens within the field of criminal justice. Therefore, D.C.J and Crim.D. degrees, in theory, would be functionally identical.

Although mostly known for comedic roles, he was also an accomplished dramatic actor. P√µldroos' career ended at age thirty-seven when he died unexpectedly. Early life and education Dan P√µldroos was born in Tallinn. He was an only child from his parents' marriage, though he had a half-sibling and a step-sibling. His grandfather's brother was actor, writer, and director Priit P√µldroos. As a hobby at age fifteen, he began performing with the local literary theatre Varius. He attended schools in Tallinn, graduating as a carpenter and cabinet- maker from the Tallinn 12th Vocational Secondary School in 1988 and the same year he enrolled in the Performing Arts Department of the Tallinn State Conservatory (now, the Estonian Academy of Music and Theatre), studying under instruction of theatre and film director Kalju Komissarov, and graduating in 1992. Among his graduating classmates were: Merle Palmiste, Kristel Leesmend, Andres Raag, Kaili N√§rep, Jaanus Rohumaa, √úllar Saarem√§e, Ivo Uukkivi, Sten Zupping, and Garmen Tabor. Career =Theatre= While still attending the Tallinn Conservatory, in 1991 he began an engagement at the Ugala theatre in Viljandi. After a year with the Ugala, he began an engagement at the Estonian Drama Theatre in Tallinn that lasted from 1992 until 1999. Among his more memorable stage roles include those in works by such authors and playwrights as: Henrik Ibsen, Truman Capote, Andrus Kivir√§hk, Ray Cooney, Eduard Vilde, Brian O'Nolan, Tony Kushner, Moli√®re, and Gustaf Fr√∂ding. In 1999, P√µldroos left the theatre and briefly worked as a teacher at a primary school in N√µmme. =Film= In 1992, Dan P√µldroos appeared in his first feature-length film as the character Filip in the Lembit Ulfsak-directed family-comedy Lammas all paremas nurgas. In 1994, he played the role of G√ºnter in the Jaan Kolberg- directed biographical drama film J√ºri Rumm about the 19th-century Estonian folk hero, itinerant thief and robber Rummu J√ºri. In 2006, he appeared as the character Leif in the Katrin Laur-directed family-comedy film Ruudi. P√µldroos' last film appearance was a role in the Andres Maimik and Rain Tolk-directed comedy Jan Uusp√µld l√§heb Tartusse, which Estonian actor and singer Jan Uusp√µld as a down-on-his-luck caricature of himself trying to hitchhike from Tallinn to Tartu to perform in a role at the Vanemuine theatre. =Television= P√µldroos began his television career as an actor in a minor role in an episode of the Swedish television drama mini-series Fallet Paragon in 1994. The following year he was cast in the EVTV (now, TV3) television drama series V.E.R.I.; in which he would appear as a cast member on the series until 1997. In 1996, he appeared in the role of Anatoli in two episodes of the Finnish crime-drama television mini-series Sergein totuus. In 1999, he co-hosted the Kanal 2 game show TV-Oksjon with former Tallinn Conservatory classmate Merle Palmiste. In 2001, he was cast in a starring role in the short-lived television action series Kodumaa parim poeg ehk eriagent 1188. P√µldroos' most popular television roles are, arguably, those in the several Mart Juur and Andrus Kivir√§hk-penned Kanal 2 comedy series alongside friend Jan Uusp√µld and an ensemble of other comedic actors. In 1998, he joined the cast of Wigla show, staying with the series until it ended in 2000. From 2001 until 2003, he appeared in the series Wremja, and in 2006 appeared in the series follow-up Sipelga 14. All three series shared common themes and the multiple characters ‚Äì performed by just several actors ‚Äì were often outrageously grotesque and bizarre. P√µldroos' characters included Uuno Nisu/Nisu Unn, an alcoholic World War II veteran who fought for Germany and burned Adolf Hitler's corpse in 1945; Maali, a sadistic mother-in-law; Aiku, a teenage rullnokk (an Estonian hoodlum, akin to a chav); Eints, a comedian; Feeliks Raudjalg/Lieutenant colonel Ivanov, a lecher who pretends to be crippled and an Estonian freedom fighter who, in reality, was a spy for the KGB; and Inspektor Valdek Kukeke, a corrupt and incompetent policeman, among others. In 2007, P√µldroos joined the cast of the comedy-parody series T√§na √ïhtul Leo P√µld, which caused a measure of controversy, as the series lampooned the early-1980s Eesti Televisioon (ETV) children's television series K√µige suurem s√µber; depicting some of the central characters from that series in adult-themed scenarios. Several episodes were filmed, but the series was not broadcast, due to objections from the public, Eesti Rahvusringh√§√§ling (Estonian Public Broadcasting) copyright violation claims, and P√µldroos' death. Personal life and death Dan P√µldroos was married to clothing designer Ketlin Bachmann-P√µldroos. The couple had one daughter, Aleksandra, born in November 2006. On 5 May 2007, P√µldroos died in his sleep of natural causes at the family's home in Tallinn at age 37. He had struggled with alcoholism during his adult life. In 2011, author and theatre critic Pille-Riin Purje penned a biography of P√µldroos titled Aitab naljast! Legend Dan P√µldroosist, published by Fookus Meedia in Tallinn.

Early life Isabelle \\"Belle\\" was born on May 29, 1857 at the family mansion at 100 Fifth Avenue in New York City. She was one of three children born to Frederick Charles Gebhard (1825‚Äì1865) and Catherine \\"Kate\\" (n√©e Davis) Gebhard (1829‚Äì1870), who had married in 1850. Her father joined the family firm in 1845, by which time they had expanded their mercantile business and developed interests in banking and rail-road stocks. By 1865, her father had died, and by 1870, her mother had died, leaving the children orphaned and to be raised by their uncle. The uncle was William Henry Gebhard. Her brother, Frederick Gebhard was known for his relationship with Lillie Langtry, a society beauty previously known for her affair with Edward, Prince of Wales. Another brother, Henry Gebhard Jr. died in 1871, aged 10, of scarlet fever. Gebhard's paternal grandfather had came from Holland to New York in 1800. He worked as an agent for a Dutch company, eventually starting a business importing gin. Between 1830 and 1832, he adopted three children (all siblings), whose surnames were changed by legal enactment from Bruce to Gebhard.. =Inheritance= Her maternal grandfather, Thomas E. Davis, was a wealthy New York property developer who made provisions in his will for Isabelle and her brother to receive incomes from his estate until they were 30, at which time the title of the investment would be transferred to them. In 1893, her brother took legal action on behalf of himself and her to enforce this clause. Their grandfather's estate included properties in New York City. They were each entitled to 1/24th part of this estate plus a part of their aunt Nora's share due to her death in 1874. Her brother Frederick found himself in reduced circumstances, eventually starting an unsuccessful venture selling fine wines, and needed to borrow money from Isabel. She eventually took court action against him to recover the money (over $65,000). Society life Isabelle and her brother inherited wealth, and the family mansion, from the estates of their parents and their grandfather. They were well connected in New York society, being related to many of the old and wealthy American families including Vanderbilt, Stuyvesant, Livingston, Remsen, Neilson, Hunter, Delafleld, Lawrence, Wells and Leverich. Her granduncle was Father John Power, Vicar General of New York; another uncle was John F. A.

In the film, actor Michael Caine tells a woman that she reminds him of a love poem on page 112 of a book of poetry written by e e cummings. If an entire work is to be judged, this principle assumes that page 112 is an index of quality since the beginning and the end of the work are subjected to a greater amount of attention by authors and editors, whereas page 112 is the ventre mou or soft belly.

With the assistance of Anders' Army, approximately 110,000 Polish evacuees left the Soviet Union to Persia and 18,000 of those refugees were sent to East Africa. Once the Polish refugees arrived in Mombasa, many were sent to the nearby British territories of Rhodesia, Tanzania and Uganda. The refugees who stayed in Kenya were sent to settlement camps in Makindu, Manira, Nairobi, Nyali and Rongai. The refugees would remain in Kenya until 1949 when many were resettled to Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. In 1945, Poland regained its independence after the war. On 12 December 1963, Kenya obtained its independence from the United Kingdom and on 13 December 1963, Poland recognized and established diplomatic relations with Kenya.Diplomatic relations between Poland and Kenya (in Polish) In 1964, Poland opened a resident embassy in Nairobi.

Development Since the 1920s the Regia Aeronautica evaluated the opportunity to equip some of its units with support aircraft. To overcome the difficulties of use in the presence of heavy seas, launch structures were installed, real and proper, on which was appropriately fixed the aircraft that was brought at a speed sufficient to allow take-off. After using various seaplanes designed for civil use such as Macchi M.18, or more specific Piaggio P.6 and CANT 25, in 1933 the Ministry of Aeronautics on behalf of the Regia Marina, issued a specification for the supply of a new two-seater aircraft to be used in the roles of reconnaissance and hunting, and able to replace the previous designs and characterized mainly from a single- engine configuration. The performances required by the specifications concerned the maximum speed at low altitude, set at at least , the stall speed, equal to , a rise time that at full load allowed the achievement of a quota equal to in 26 minutes, an autonomy at cruising speed of 6 h 30 min and a range of action of . The Z.504 flew on September 1, 1934, but lost out to the IMAM Ro.43 for the production contract. The Z.504 was later owned by the brothers Callisto and Alberto Cosulich, where it was presumably used as a training aircraft. Design The Z.504 was designed by Filippo Zappata, the successor to Raffaele Conflenti, chief designer at CANT. The aircraft was characterized by a biplane veiling, the only model of Zappata to use it, and by a central hull configuration with an aerodynamically well-groomed profile.
