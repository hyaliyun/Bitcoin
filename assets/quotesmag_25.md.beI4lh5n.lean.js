It is a tail-less variant of the Barbu d'Anvers, and is otherwise similar to it in every respect. The same colour varieties are accepted for the Barbu de Grubbe as for the Barbu d'Anvers. History In about 1904 a tail-less Barbu d'Anvers was born to the breeder Robert Pauwels, creator of the Barbu d'Everberg breed, at his breeding farm in the municipality of Kortenberg, between Brussels and Louvain. By careful cross- breeding he created a good number of such tail-less birds, which were seen at many exhibitions up to the time of the First World War. The name Barbu de Grubbe was given to the breed. After the War they were not again seen for several decades. In 2012 a total of 170 breeding Barbu de Grubbe birds were counted in Belgium. The breed is rare, and is considered to be \\"in danger\\"; the conservation status of many other Belgian bantam breeds is classed as \\"critical\\". The Barbu de Grubbe is regularly seen at poultry exhibitions in the Netherlands, and has since 2008 been recognised in Germany. In the United kingdom it is classed among the true bantams. Characteristics The Barbu de Grubbe is identical in all respects to the Barbu d'Anvers, except that the tail and coccygeal bone are absent.

Garber's companies are estimated to have the highest number of medallions in both Long Island City and Chicago, earning Garber the nickname of \\"Taxi King\\". Garber's cab companies have been involved in several scandals including the illegal use of salvaged police cars in the Chicago fleet and overcharging cab drivers in New York for leasing a medallion. In 2009, Garber founded the International Polo Club of Colts Neck near his residence in Colts Neck, New Jersey. Early life Simon Garber was born in 1966 in Odessa, Ukraine. In 1978, Garber immigrated with his parents to New Jersey where his father was a sheet-metal worker and his mother was a nurse. Garber reports that he initially had difficulty with bullying in school, until he joined a group of Lubavitchers who paid for him to attend a Jewish day school and helped him get a summer job at a Jewish camp. Career Garber started driving taxi cabs in New York City at the age of 18 to help pay for college, eventually owning two cabs. Soon he was buying and selling New York medallions (city-regulated individual permits to operate a cab) for a profit.Kathy Bergen. \\"Hard driver at the top of city's heated taxi market\\", 10 May 2004.

Retrieved 20 August 2014. In 1992, Garber became friends with Russian politician Vladimir Slutsker while on vacation in Monaco. Through Slutsker, Garber was introduced to several Russian high-ranking officials. Three years later, Slutsker convinced Garber to start the company Moscow Taxi with Garber's brother-in-law Eduard Sheinen. Using his political ties, Garber's business eventually grew to over 2,500 vehicles before a weak Russian economy forced the company to downsize the fleet. While in Russia in 2001, Garber became friends with Patrick Daley, the son of long-time Chicago mayor Richard M. Daley. City officials tightly regulate all aspects of medallions ownership, granting permission to purchase medallions on an individual basis. Within a year of meeting Patrick, Garber quickly acquired over 300 Chicago taxi medallions. Garber also hired Mayor Daley's former chief of staff Gery Chico as a City Hall lobbyist. In 2003, Garber used this political capital to start the Chicago Carriage Cab Company and was granted permission to operate the taxi business in Chicago. Within six years, the Chicago Carriage Cab Company had amassed over 800 medallions, making it the largest taxi company in the city. Michael Cohen and Garber were associates together with large interests in taxi companies in the United States. Interests Garber enjoys playing polo and has a training area on his 10-acre estate in Colts Neck, New Jersey. In 2009, Garber founded the International Polo Club of Colts Neck, which is located in New Jersey. Garber's polo teams are sponsored by his taxi companies, and compete in events worldwide. Controversy =Illegal use of salvage vehicles as taxis= In 2010 city officials in Chicago investigated claims that some of the taxis in the city had been previously categorized as salvage vehicles (typically an insurance designation meaning the vehicles were damaged enough that it would cost more to fix the vehicle than the intrinsic worth of vehicle). Chicago law prohibits operating any vehicle as a taxi that was once deemed a salvage title. Chicago investigators found over 340 vehicles, of which 183 vehicles belonged to Garber's Chicago Carriage Cab Company. Garber had bought salvaged police cars, cleaned the titles of the salvage designation, and then illegally added the vehicles to his fleet. City officials fined Garber and his business associates up to $50,000 per vehicle for a total of $9 million. Garber's 183 salvage vehicles represented approximately 20% of his entire fleet. The prosecutors also estimated that many of the cars had been in service for up to 4 years prior to the investigation. Additionally, the Chicago Sun-Times newspaper investigated 100 of Garber's taxis from other fleets not associated with Chicago and found that 23 had previously been designated as salvage titles. The newspaper stated that it was unknown whether those vehicles were still in circulation. More details of the salvage scheme (and further implication of Garber's involvement) became available through the 2014 trial of one of Garber's business partners, Alexsandr Igolnikov, who was convicted of conspiracy as well as interstate transportation and possession of false automobile titles. Igolnikov was responsible for purchasing the salvage vehicles, repairing them, and then working through corrupt auto brokers to obtain clean titles from Indiana or Illinois. Once the new titles were secured, the salvaged vehicles were painted maroon and entered into Garber's taxi fleet as well as other fleets co-owned by Garber and Igolnikov. Igolnikov would repair and paint the vehicles in a garage owned by Garber.Tim Novak. \\"Ex-top cab official arrested in vehicle title laundering case\\", Chicago Sun Times, 29 September 2014. Retrieved 1 October 2014. =Improper charging of taxi operators= On August 12, 2014, the Attorney General along with the Taxi and Limousine Commission for the state of New York announced that Garber's Yellow Cab SLS Jet Management Corp. had agreed to pay approximately $1.6 million in restitution and fines for overcharging cab drivers that leased vehicles from Garber. The taxi drivers who leased through Garber were required to pre-pay to lease the taxi, but did not provide a way for this to be done. If the taxi driver did not pre-pay, the driver was assessed a \\"late fee\\" at the time of payment, effectively ensuring that a late fee was included on every lease agreement. A few drivers reported that when they contacted the company for an explanation of the late fees, they were told that the fee was for leasing a hybrid fuel car, which is illegal in the state of New York. The Attorney General estimated that Garber's practice had overcharged approximately 2,000 taxi drivers. As part of the settlement, Garber agreed to pay approximately $1.4 million in restitution to the taxi drivers and $200,000 in fines and fees.Bruce Golding. \\"Taxi company to pay more than $1.6M for ripping off cabbies\\", NY Post, 12 August 2014. Retrieved 20 August 2014. =Employment of taxi drivers with a history of repeated vehicle citations= In 2012 the Chicago Tribune found that Garber's Chicago Carriage Cab Company had repeatedly employed cab drivers with a history of repeated moving vehicle violations. One such driver, Rida Lemghari, had been given 46 citations, of which he was found liable in 33 cases. Five of these citations occurred over a three-month time period, during which Lemghari was driving for Garber's company. Additionally, from 2006 to 2008, Lemghari collected 14 total citations while driving in Garber's taxis. Lobbying by the taxi industry enabled the inclusion of language in a repeat-offender law that allowed officials to voluntarily not enforce the law on a case-by-case basis. Unenforced regulation of repeat offenders allowed Garber to continue to employ these drivers, and when the investigation was announced, Garber did not face any sanctions.Joe Mahr, Cynthia Dizikes and Jason Meisner. \\"New law will hold companies accountable for repeat-offender cabdrivers\\", Chicago Tribune, 16 February 2012.

The company's initial products were launched in the United States in 2012. The company has products designed to emulate chicken, beef, and pork sausage. History The company was founded as a California-based startup called Savage River Inc. by Ethan Brown in 2009. Brown initially contacted two University of Missouri professors, Fu-hung Hsieh and Harold Huff, who had already been refining their meatless protein for years. The duo spent nearly a decade in the University lab working different temperatures and pressures to get their mixture of soybean and pea proteins ‚Äúas close to the look and feel of real chicken as possible.‚Äù It took them another five years to come up with a recipe for Beyond Meat‚Äôs first product, ‚ÄúChicken-Free Strips,‚Äù which the company released to limited locations in 2012. The company has received venture funding from GreatPoint Ventures, Kleiner Perkins, Obvious Corporation, Bill Gates, Biz Stone, the Humane Society and Tyson Foods. The company began selling its plant-based chicken products in Whole Foods supermarkets across the US in April 2013. In 2014, it developed a simulated beef product. The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals named Beyond Meat as its company of the year for 2013.In 2014 Beyond Meat expanded its presence from 1,500 to 6,000 stores across the US. Tyson Foods purchased a 5% stake in Beyond Meat in October 2016. It sold its 6.5% stake and exited the investment in April 2019, ahead of the company's initial public offering. In June 2018, Beyond Meat opened its second production facility in Columbia, Missouri, resulting in a three-fold increase of the company's manufacturing space. The company claimed to have 27,000 different points of distribution for their products in the United States and was rolling out their products to fifty international markets, partnering with Tesco in the UK and Tim Hortons and A&W; in Canada. The same month, they opened a 26,000-square foot R&D; lab in El Segundo, California housing nearly 100 employees. In March 2019, a civil suit was filed against Beyond Meat by its former business partner, Don Lee Farms, Beyond Meat's products after Beyond Meat switched to using different suppliers and shared details of the manufacturing process with them. Don Lee Farms alleged breach of contract, and further alleged that they had expressed \\"significant concerns\\" about food safety protocols at Beyond Meat's facility.Beyond Meat Sued by Former Partner Don Lee Farms, Specialty Food News 03/11/2019, accessed April 25, 2019 In July 2019, Dunkin' Donuts announced that they would begin selling breakfast sandwiches using the Meatless Sausage product in Manhattan, with plans for national distribution beginning on November 6, 2019. As of July 2019, Beyond Meat had a market value of US$11.7 billion, following a value of $3.8 billion on the day of its initial public offering, May 2, 2019. Beyond Meat trades on the United States NASDAQ exchange under the symbol BYND. In 2020, Beyond Meat launched an e-commerce site to sell products directly to consumers. It is announced that the company will open a production facility in Shanghai. Products =Chicken Strips= The company's first product launched in 2012 was designed to emulate chicken and sold frozen. The product was licenced from Harold Huff and Fu-Hung Hsieh at the University of Missouri. They were made from \\"soy powder, gluten-free flour, carrot fiber and other ingredients\\" which were mixed and fed into a food extrusion machine that cooks the mixture while forcing it through a specially designed mechanism that uses steam, pressure, and cold water to form the product's chicken-like texture. The product was praised by some celebrities, but journalists who tasted it said the \\"likeness to real chicken was tolerable, at best\\" and it was discontinued in 2019. =Beyond Burger= A Beyond Burger The company announced in 2014 that it had begun development of a new product to emulate beef burgers, which was released in February 2015. The burgers are made from pea protein isolates, rice protein, mung bean protein, canola oil, coconut oil, potato starch, apple extract, sunflower lecithin, and pomegranate powder. Beef products that \\"bleed\\" are achieved by using red beet juice. The products are certified as not containing genetically modified ingredients. The number of ingredients and processes involved in producing the products means that they are classified as ultra-processed foods in the NOVA food classification scheme. their products cost more than twice that of meat. One burger patty contains of food energy, twenty grams of protein, twenty grams of fat (of which five grams is saturated fat) and one gram of salt. The protein and fat content are similar to a beef patty of a similar weight, but the salt content is \\"much higher\\". Nutrition of the burger varies according to the restaurant chain in which it is served. =Beyond Sausage= In December 2017, the company announced a vegan alternative to pork sausage called \\"Beyond Sausage\\". The three varieties of \\"sausage\\" were called Bratwurst, Hot Italian, and Sweet Italian. = Sustainability = In September 2018, Beyond Meat received a Champions of the Earth award from the United Nations. This sought to recognize the company‚Äôs sustainability efforts beyond the product such as swapping plastic packaging trays to compostable tray for use in their Beyond Sausage.

It will replace 2,400-seat War Memorial Auditorium in the Greensboro Coliseum Complex; the auditorium was torn down in October 2014. The Community Foundation of Greater Greensboro raised $35 million privately, to be paid over ten years. The city of Greensboro is paying $30 million. Construction was delayed a year so the foundation could get a $25 million bank loan to guarantee its contribution. The Greensboro Symphony and Guilford College's Bryan Series are expected to use the facility. The facility will also host Broadway productions and concerts. The facility is named for Steven Tanger, CEO of Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, who pledged $7.5 million toward the project in 2013. After working for a year, a task force recommended a state of the art center in February 2013. Groundbreaking was held April 26, 2017 and the first work took place July 13. History In 2000, Greensboro arts groups wanted a new performance facility or changes to existing facilities which were inadequate. War Memorial Auditorium, with 2,400 seats, was too large for some events but had a small stage and orchestra pit as well as poor acoustics; Coliseum Managing Director Matt Brown had plans for $5 million in improvements but no funding. The Carolina Theatre downtown had only 1,100 seats. A preliminary study recommended a performing arts center with 1,700 to 2,000 seats, and a smaller 500-seat facility. The study also said the city had enough events for both existing and new facilities. Arts leaders wanted a more detailed study. A 2001 downtown master plan estimated the cost of a new performing arts center at between $35 and $45 million. A feasibility study was done in 2004. 2006 and 2008 bond referendums to renovate were unsuccessful. In 2008, Brown said events were being lost to the Durham Performing Arts Center and that Greensboro was entitled to a facility of equal quality. Until that happened, the auditorium could be repaired as needed, but that would not be enough. In January 2012, Brown asked the city council to consider a $36 million performing arts center to replace the auditorium, paid for with $25 million in bonds and $11 million in accommodations tax revenues. A Greensboro Performing Arts Center Task Force began meeting in February. At their first meeting, Interim City Manager Denise Turner Roth said a downtown location, which the city council wanted, would cost up to $15 million more, with $10 million of that amount coming from donations. In June 2012, the task force recommended a 3000-seat $60 million facility downtown. In 2013, Greensboro attorney Kathy Manning agreed to serve as chair to seek private funds for the performing arts center. Originally, the city-owned former YMCA site was to be used but it was not enough. Land was purchased at North Elm and Lindsay Streets and Summit Avenue at a cost of $11.5 million. During the closing ceremony for War Memorial Auditorium on September 4, 2014, Brown showed what the planned veterans' memorial would look like. Names of veterans shown on plaques at the auditorium would eventually go in the new memorial near the Tanger Center. Because the Tanger Center is expected to lose money in its early years, a new premium parking lot at the Coliseum Complex will be used to help with operating expenses. Expected revenue from the lot is nearly $400,000 a year. A second, 250-space lot at the Tanger Center is expected to provide $675,000 per year. On July 29, 2015, the city revealed the cost of the center would be $58 million, $8 million over the original estimate, and not including $11.5 million for the land. This was after cuts had been made, and more cuts were expected. On December 8, 2015, the city council approved a plan to raise $11 million more for the center, after it became clear the original budget was already exceeded by more than $10 million. The Chamber of Commerce building would be replaced by VIP parking expected to provide $1.6 million. Private donors would be asked for $3.5 million more. Ticket service fees would be $1 more, and $1 less of the existing $3 service fee would go to arts groups, with each raising a projected $3.75 million over 25 years. Also, $4.4 million of the costs would be eliminated if possible. The city would also have to authorize $9,617,858 in bonds. At a January 27, 2016 news conference, H3 Hardy Collaboration Architecture showed designs for the exterior and lobby. The facade will be limestone and glass. The lobby will include art to be paid for by a donation. On February 17, 2016, Phillips Foundation announced a $1.5 million grant; this is in addition to a $3.5 million grant in May 2013, for which the 8000-square-foot lobby will be named Phillips Hall. Phillips Foundation will also provide art for the lobby. Brown and others announced on December 16, 2016 that the $38.5 million fund-raising goal had been met and that $300,000 of the additional $3 million had been raised. Construction was expected to start in May 2017 and will be complete in early 2020. The 111,000-square-foot building will face Abe Brenner Place and occupy part of a 5.5-acre lot also bordered by North Elm and East Lindsay Streets and Summit Avenue. The 3000 seats will be white oak with red upholstery, and divided into lower orchestra, upper orchestra and balcony. A Founders Room will be available for events. The site will also have 329 VIP parking spaces. As of March 8, 2017, the opening date of early 2019 was uncertain. Potential donors had been saying for several months that delays would result in their waiting to give their money. Steven Tanger and North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper attended the groundbreaking April 26, 2017. At the time, Brown predicted a June 2019 opening. D.H. Griffin won the bidding for Phase I, which started July 13, 2017. On December 19, 2017, the Greensboro city council awarded a $57.9 million contract to Barnhill Contracting Company of Raleigh, North Carolina. Work could start in January 2018, but this meant a completion date of January 2020. The project's total cost was $84.7 million, plus $5 million in financing costs. The Tanger Center would be collateral for $48 million in limited obligation bonds. A web site is now available and includes what is described as a Real Time Camera permitting viewers to watch construction progress. As of May 2019, completion is expected January 28, 2020 and the total cost is $90 million, $5 million of that related to bond financing. On March 13, 2020, it was announced that the center's opening would be delayed further due to statewide bans of gatherings consisting of more than 100 people due to the COVID-19 pandemic, effectively postponing multiple opening events.

Layout and ride experience thumb Typhoon is a relatively compact roller coaster with a base of by with a maximum height of almost , which has been cited as being particularly small for a roller coaster with the number of inversions that Typhoon has. The Typhoon has four inversions: a vertical loop, double heartline roll and an additional single heartline roll. Typhoon has single cars which can each carry eight passengers (two rows of four people). Incidents There have been a number of publicized incidents involving riders becoming stuck on Typhoon. One incident occurred in May 2011 when four children and two teenagers were stuck on the coaster. The riders were eventually rescued and none were injured in the incident. In June 2013, eight riders were evacuated after another incident and were forced to use an emergency staircase to exit. Additional incidents occurred in both June and July 2014. In the June 2014 incident, the coaster was stuck on the top of the lift hill and riders were forced to evacuate using the emergency stair. In the July 2014 incident, the coaster was stuck near the end of the ride. Neither case resulted in any injuries.

In 1964, she entered the service of German Archaeological Institute, Berlin. Biography The daughter of the civil engineer Herbert Meischner and his wife Lilly, she was born in 1935 in what was then the Free City of Danzig. After fleeing Danzig in January 1945 in the wake of World War II, she attended the Droste-H√ºlshoff High School in Berlin- Zehlendorf, where she passed her A-levels in 1954. At the Free University of Berlin, she studied classical philology, classical archeology, ancient history and completed studies of Greek and Latin. She spent the academic year 1958/59 at the University of Athens and Greece. The next year was dedicated to the study of Greek and Roman ancient collections of the major museums in order to prepare her dissertation on \\"The Female Portrait in the Severan Period\\". Her academic advisor, Friedrich Wilhelm Goethert, was instrumental in getting her a post as an assistant with Friedrich Matz, the Younger, in Sarkophag-Corpus, Marburg, as well as in assisting with her first publication \\"A second type of portrait of the Empress Crispina\\". After completing her doctorate in 1964, she joined the civil service at the German Archaeological Institute, Berlin, from which she retired after 35 years of service in 2000. During this time she also continued her studies of late antique portraiture, which culminated in a brief monograph entitled \\"Portraits of Late Antiquity\\" (bnb-Verlag Bremen, 2001). A revised and expanded edition in German and English is currently being prepared. In 1988 she was invited by the Archaeological Institute in Warsaw for a lecture and a visit to Danzig. In 1998, she lectured in M√©rida on the great Missorium of Theodosius I where she credited it to Theodosius II. She toured the great museums in the U.S. several times. Tunisian mosaics inspired her to study the Greek and Roman sports. The origin of the palm award, for example, can be seen in the wand of the paidotribe in the palaestra. The wands were switches and palm fronds. The latter then served as an unofficial trophy. The black-figure and red-figure vases evidence this practice. In the great Panhellenic Games of the prize remained the wreath. The palm trophy in the imperial period was abstracted to the shape of a golden palm trunk, the so- called 'Preiszylinder' for successful racehorses. With the New Testament Pauline epistles the symbol of the victor's palm keeps its validity even today. Jutta Meischner was given responsibility for the publication of the wall paintings of the Late Roman Hypogeum in Constanta, Romania. In Copenhagen, she was able to assign the, up to then, much earlier dated statues of Sette Sale to the Valentinian epoch, based on the design of the eyes. In 1999 she received permission to study and publicize Greek and Roman sculptures from the Hatay Archaeology Museum in Antakya, Turkey. Through the Attic garland sarcophagi was shown the Attic origin of Berlin's early imperial Caffarelli-sarcophagus from Rome. Together with Erg√ºn Laflƒ± from Izmir she again showed her commitment to southern Turkey with the presentation of antique sculptures in Cilicia. Related materials found on a trip to Israel in the Rockefeller Museum, Jerusalem, were added to the above publication. During 2005-2008, she conducted extensive research on Late archaic sculpture, that resulted in pinning down subtle but highly important and meaningful distinctive features in the transitional period of late Archaic and early Classical sculpture. A detailed study of a black marble head (whose typological affinity on the basis of two relatively well preserved surviving coins, one in the Biblioth√®que nationale, Paris, and the other in the Berlin M√ºnz-Cabinet) points to the Apollo Philesios by Canachus in Didyma, dating from the early 5th Century BC. This study will be of major import for identifying the above major features in rendering the physiognomic, facial and portrayal details. These appear to have been largely overlooked in previous field research and studies on the art of Greek sculpture and the sudden stylistic change from the late Archaic and Severe periods to early the Classical. She is now on the advisory board of Adem's Clay, a design firm in Berlin. Published works 61: Meischner, J. und Laflƒ± E. Eine fr√ºhklassische Stele aus Samsun/Amisos.

The rear wing, a timber framed structure, is the oldest part of the building and dates from the early 17th century. History Formerly a residential house, what is now the Green Dragon was built in the early 17th Century, with the front range rebuilt in the early 19th Century and a side extension following in the 1980s. Much of the interior of the pub still contains the original timber frame, whilst the frontage is red brick, and the roof red tile. The tap room was built in 1838, whilst much of the rest of the pub has remained unchanged since the 19th century. Among the Green Dragon's past clientele are two infamous figures, Nazi politician Joachim von Ribbentrop and Soviet spy Guy Burgess. Von Ribbentrop was a regular at the Green Dragon during the 1930s when he stayed at his weekend house in nearby Latimer during his time as the German Ambassador to the United Kingdom. Due to his involvement in the Nazi regime, von Ribbentrop would be sentenced to death as a result of the Nuremberg Trials. As a result of Hermann G√∂ring committing suicide, von Ribbentrop became the first of those sentenced to be executed; he was hanged on 16 October 1946. Burgess meanwhile often visited the Green Dragon when he stayed in Flaunden with his boyfriend, Peter Pollock, who lived in the Sharlowes farmhouse not far from the pub. Burgess would defect to the Soviet Union in May 1951, however, he is reported to have met with fellow Cambridge Five member Donald MacLean in the Tap Room of the Green Dragon the day prior to their defection. The Green Dragon has been under the custodianship of many landlords over the years and with one family in particular, the Burgess' for three generations from 1932-2018. Present Day The Green Dragon is listed on the Campaign for Real Ale's National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors register, and is the only pub in Hertfordshire to be listed as having an \\"interior of national importance\\". This is due in large part to the snug being made up of two or more high backed settles, of which there are only a handful left in the country. The pub prides itself on being a \\"focal point for traditional rural pursuits\\" and during the game season its \\"Tap Room\\" is visited by shooters following a day of sport. The Green Dragon is currently undergoing an extensive restoration and refurbishment and will re-open with new restaurants and event facilities.

Adapted from the original cloud computing paradigm and introduced into the realm of computer-aided product development, Cloud-Based Design and Manufacturing is gaining significant momentum and attention from both academia and industry. Cloud- based design and manufacturing includes two aspects: cloud-based design and cloud-based manufacturing. Another related concept is cloud manufacturing that is more general and popular.L.

(Ed): Cloud-Based Design and Manufacturing: A Service-Oriented Product Development Paradigm for the 21st Century, Springer, London, UK, pp. 1‚Äì24. Cloud-Based Design (CBD) refers to a networked design model that leverages cloud computing, service- oriented architecture (SOA), Web 2.0 (e.g., social network sites), and semantic web technologies to support cloud-based engineering design services in distributed and collaborative environments.Wu, D., Schaefer, D., & Rosen, D.W. (2013). Cloud-Based Design and Manufacturing Systems: A Social Network Analysis. International Conference on Engineering Design (ICED13), Seoul, Korea. Cloud-Based Manufacturing (CBM) refers to a networked manufacturing model that exploits on-demand access to a shared collection of diversified and distributed manufacturing resources to form temporary, reconfigurable production lines which enhance efficiency, reduce product lifecycle costs, and allow for optimal resource allocation in response to variable-demand customer generated tasking.Wu, D., Greer, M.J., Rosen, D.W., & Schaefer, D. (2013). Cloud Manufacturing: Drivers, Current Status, and Future Trends. Proceedings of the ASME 2013 International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC13), Paper Number: MSEC2013-1106, Madison, Wisconsin, U.S. The enabling technologies for Cloud-Based Design and Manufacturing include cloud computing, Web 2.0, Internet of Things (IoT), and service-oriented architecture (SOA).  History  The term cloud-based design and manufacturing (CBDM) was initially coined by Dazhong Wu, David Rosen, and Dirk Schaefer at Georgia Tech in 2012 for the purpose of articulating a new paradigm for digital manufacturing and design innovation in distributed and collaborative settings. The main objective of CBDM is to further reduce time and cost associated with maintaining information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructures for design and manufacturing, enhancing digital manufacturing and design innovation in distributed and collaborative environments, and adapting to rapidly changing market demands.Wu, D., Thames, J.L., Rosen, D.W., & Schaefer, D.

She is particularly known for her work helping citizens affected by forced evictions in Baku, on whose behalf she organized several small protests. In July 2014, the Azerbaijani authorities jailed Yunus under allegations of fraud and tax evasion, which are charges widely regarded as dubious. After being sentenced to 8.5 years in jail on 13 August 2015, Leyla Yunus was released on grounds of her deteriorating health on 9 December 2015, with a court converting her sentence into a suspended one. Public career Yunus is a historian by training and wrote her dissertation on \\"English- Russian Rivalry on the Caspian Sea and Azerbaijan in the First Part of the 18th Century\\". In the last years of the Soviet Union, Yunus was active in pro- reform circles. In 1988, she founded the \\"Popular Front of Azerbaijan in Support of Perestroika\\", together with a small group of moderate intellectuals. Early on, this Popular Front of Azerbaijan was deliberately modeled on the example of the Popular Front of Estonia. By January 1990, Yunus together with Zardusht Alizadeh formed the Social Democratic Party, with the aim of establishing a moderate political voice. In April 1990, Yunus published an essay \\"The Responsibilities of a Politician\\", arguing for a democratic middle course and rejecting both extreme nationalism and the violent repressions of the Soviet regime. During the hostilities in the Nagorno- Karabakh conflict in 1992-1993, Yunus served as the Vice-Minister of Defence and Chief of the Information Analytical Centre of Ministry of Defence. Subsequently, Yunus has worked with civil society activists in both Azerbaijan and Armenia to call for peace. She and her husband Arif, a historian, are known for actively pursuing reconciliation with Armenia. In 1998, she participated in the European Consultation of the International Fellowship of Reconciliation's Women Peacemakers Program (WPP), together with an Armenian counterpart, on active nonviolence. In 1995, she became the Director of the Institute of Peace and Democracy. In 2009, Yunus was tried for libel after she stated that there was police misconduct in a recent kidnapping trial, alleging that police had been involved in further trafficking the two young girls involved. Interior Minister Ramil Usubov filed suit against her, stating that she had \\"caused danger to police power\\". He demanded 100,000 manat in damages. Human Rights Watch protested the trial, stating that \\"a judgment against Yunus would set a terrible precedent for freedom of expression in Azerbaijan\\", while other international groups described the case as \\"one more example of the Azerbaijani government cracking down on free expression\\". In 2011, after a number of failed appeals to authorities regarding police behavior during evictions, Yunus stated her intention to appeal the evictions to the European Court of Human Rights. Authorities bulldozed Yunus' Baku office with only a few minutes' warning on 11 August 2011, the same day an article appeared in the New York Times in which she criticized forced evictions. She was in Norway on the day of the demolition. European Union representatives \\"deplored\\" the demolition, calling her organization \\"a regular partner of the international community\\". Azerbaijani Member of Parliament Khadi Musa Redzhabli denied that the bulldozing had been connected with Yunus' human rights work. Fifty-two human rights organisations from 14 countries, including Index on Censorship and the Rafto Foundation, sent a joint letter of concern to the Azerbaijani authorities condemning the demolition. In 2014, together with Rasul Jafarov, Leyla Yunus has led a Working Group, which worked on compiling a list of political prisoners in Azerbaijan. In early August 2014 both of them have been arrested, and their names are the last ones on the list - final outcome of their work - which has been published by the Norwegian Helsinki Committee. Prosecution and international outcry On 28 April 2014, Yunus and her husband Arif were detained at the Heydar Aliyev International Airport on their way to Doha, Qatar and charged with fraud and tax evasion. She and her husband Arif were jailed.name=RFEarrest As Yunus is diabetic, her situation in jail has been described as precarious amid reports that Azerbaijani authorities have refused to provide medical assistance to her. Prohibited from communicating with her husband directly, she has written an open letter which has been translated and published on various websites, and in which she has stated that \\"We [...] never would have predicted that the 21st century would bring the repression of the 1930s.\\" The detention of Leyla and Arif Yunus, as well as Rasul Jafarov, has largely been regarded as another step in the state crackdown on civil society in Azerbaijan. These actions of the authorities have been harshly condemned by many prominent international human rights organizations, among them Amnesty International (which calls the Yunus \\"prisoners of conscience\\" and has called on the authorities to release them immediately), Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, United States Mission to the OSCE, Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, Nobel Women's Initiative, Reporters Without Borders, Human Rights Watch and others. Human Rights Watch called for the suspension of Azerbaijan's membership from an Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) because of \\"Azerbaijan government‚Äôs offensive against human rights defenders and non-governmental organizations\\". On 13 August 2015 Leyla Yunus was sentenced to 8.5 years in jail, her husband, Arif, was sentenced to 7 years in jail on charges of fraud and tax evasion. The couple also faced treason charges (for allegedly spying for Armenia) in a separate case, which was never heard. Western governments and human rights groups expressed concern over their prosecution. Human Rights Watch denounced their case as a show trial, and Amnesty International described the couple as prisoners of conscience. Leyla Yunus was released on health grounds on 9 December 2015, after her husband Arif Yunus had previously been released, also on health grounds, in November 2015. Her sentence was converted into a suspended one. She thus has not been cleared of the charges. Leyla and Arif Yunus were allowed by Azerbaijani government to travel to the Netherlands for health treatment in April 2016, where they remained to reside in. Awards =Nominations= In October 2014, Leyla Yunus was among the three finalists for the Sakharov Prize. The nomination had been supported by a number of prominent activists, including the last generation of Soviet dissidents and friends of late Andrei Sakharov. In announcing the Sakharov award, the European Parliament also stated that it had \\"decided to send a delegation with representatives from all political groups to Azerbaijan to meet and support Leyla Yunus in her fight for democracy and freedom in her country.\\" Leyla Yunus has also been nominated for the Human Rights Tulip award. =Awarded= In October 2014, The Norwegian Helsinki Committee awarded Leyla Yunus - together with Rasul Jafarov, Anar Mammadli and Intiqam Aliyev - The Andrei Sakharov Freedom Award. Leyla Yunus received the Polish Prize of S√©rgio Vieira de Mello in October 2014, for her personal achievement in the fight for human rights.

She founded the Everyday Sexism Project website in April 2012. Her first book, Everyday Sexism, was published in 2014. Early life Bates was born on 27 August 1986 in Oxford to a mother who taught French and a physician father, and grew up in Hackney and Taunton, and has an older sister and a younger brother. Her parents divorced when Bates was in her twenties. She read English literature at St John's College, Cambridge, and graduated from the University of Cambridge in 2007. Bates remained in Cambridge for two and a half years as a researcher for the psychologist Susan Quilliam who was working on an updated edition of The Joy of Sex. Everyday Sexism project Bates then worked as an actress and a nanny, a period in which she has said she experienced sexism at auditions and found the young girls she was caring for were already preoccupied with their body image. The Everyday Sexism project website was founded in 2012. Bates told the Financial Times journalist Lucy Kellaway in 2014 about \\"having a guy in a car slow down and say, 'You walk down here every Wednesday and Thursday at about 12, don't you?'\\" Bates recalled asking herself afterwards: \\"Is it my fault?\\" During an interview for The Daily Telegraph in April 2014, Bates said: \\"All feminism means to me is that everyone should be treated equally regardless of their sex. We have to get past judging women on their looks and then using that to derive some sort of idea about their agenda.\\" \\"A man can be a father, a doctor, a politician, a lawyer, without his sex being an issue or being commented on\\", Bates told Anna Klassen of The Daily Beast website. \\"One of the nicest surprises has been the compassionate responses from men\\", she wrote in The Guardian. \\"It's not about men against women, but people against prejudice.\\" Around the third anniversary of the website, in April 2015, Everyday Sexism had reached 100,000 entries. She has faced abuse online. \\"People talk about specific serial killers they admire and who they would like to emulate\\", she told Lucy Kellaway, \\"and about the different weapons that they fantasise about using on you and in what order. It is quite twisted stuff.\\" A contributor to other publications as well as The Guardian, Bates' first book Everyday Sexism was published by the London subsidiary of Simon & Schuster in 2014. She is contracted to write two further books for Simon & Schuster. She is a contributor to the New York‚Äìbased, Women Under Siege Project.

The building is on the Old Market (Oude Markt); around are the streets called Branderijstraat and Lepelstraat. The original Roman Catholic church of the city, it has belonged to the Dutch Reformed Church since 1572, which became the Protestant Church in the Netherlands in 2004. The church is pseudo-basilican in style; the aisles are almost as wide as the nave, the three aisles each have their own vault and the nave rises above the aisles, although a clerestory is missing.  History  After the 1911 fire. The church was built between 1308 and 1328. From this period dates the lower brick section of the tower . The Gothic spire was replaced by a wooden crown similar to the current one in 1501. The carillon in the tower is the fourth bells and dates from 1951 . In 1911 a large fire broke out in which the church heavily damaged. The fire caused steeple to come crashing down and landed on the rest of the church building. A large part of the church has been lost, including the church's organs. The northern transept was formerly designated for use by the English church. This section was screened by means of a wall. The old door is still visible in the Branderijstraat next to the presbytery. The English moved to the new English church on the site of the current city hall on Paulkrugerstraat in 1914.  Interior  In the church, a number of tombstones lie in the side alcoves. Once there were 466 graves in the church but after the fire of 1911 only a small number were put back for decoration. There is in the one epitaph, eight gravestones, including that of Cornelis Lampsins, and a single tomb, in the shape of a needle, for Daniel Octavus Barwell, a passenger of the shipwrecked Woestduin. In this church is Admiral Michiel de Ruyter was baptized and married. In 1957 a stained-glass window was dedicated to him in the church.  Organs  In the church are three organs: the principal Flentrop organ (1968), the Slooff chamber organ (1971), and the Klop positive organ. The Flentrop organ is the successor to the Van Dam organ, purchased in 1916 following the fire of 1911. However, during the Second World War it was badly damaged. Before the fire in 1911 there was also an organ by Van Os (1769). The first organ was by Ramault, purchased in 1690.

It merged with West Somerset to form Somerset West and Taunton on 1 April 2019. Its council was based in Taunton. The district was formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, by a merger of the Municipal Borough of Taunton, Wellington Urban District, Taunton Rural District, and Wellington Rural District. Taunton Deane was granted borough status in 1975, enabling the mayoralty of Taunton to be continued, when other districts did not have mayors. The district was given the name of an alternate form of the Taunton Deane Hundred. A scheduled monument is a nationally important archaeological site or monument which is given legal protection by being placed on a list (or \\"schedule\\") by the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport; English Heritage takes the leading role in identifying such sites. The legislation governing this is the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. The term \\"monument\\" can apply to the whole range of archaeological sites, and they are not always visible above ground. Such sites have to have been deliberately constructed by human activity. They range from prehistoric standing stones and burial sites, through Roman remains and Medieval structures such as castles and monasteries, to later structures such as industrial sites and buildings constructed for the World Wars or the Cold War. There are 33 scheduled monuments in Taunton Deane. Many of them are Neolithic through to the Bronze and Iron Ages such as bowl barrows, cairns along with hill forts such as Norton Camp. Castle Neroche was an Iron Age hill fort which was reused as a Norman motte-and-bailey castle. Burrow Mump shows evidence of Roman use but is better known as a Norman motte-and-bailey castle, and later church. It was presented, in 1946, by Major Alexander Gould Barrett, to the National Trust to serve as a memorial to the 11,281 Somerset men who lost their lives during the first and second world wars. The Medieval period is represented by several churchyard crosses. The defensive walls and part of Taunton Castle, which has Anglo-Saxon origins and was expanded during the Medieval and Tudor eras, is included. More recent sites include Poundisford Park, Buckland Priory, Bradford Bridge and a duck decoy from the 17th century. Some of the sites such as Balt Moor Wall are of uncertain date; however the most recent are air traffic control buildings, pillboxes and fighter pens from RAF Culmhead, situated at Churchstanton on the Blackdown Hills.

Specifically, this gene is expressed primarily in liver and pancreas and the encoded protein is most active on glycolate, a two-carbon substrate. Glycolate oxidase oxidizes glycolic acid to glyoxylate, and can also oxidize glyoxylate into oxalate. These reactions are central to the toxicity of ethylene glycol poisoning.

The castle is listed as a Protected Structure by Cork County Council. History The castle was completed by 1465 by Cormac L√°idir M√≥r (or More), chief of the McCarthy clan and builder of Blarney Castle and Carrignamuck Tower House, in a marshy area over an old fort possibly dating to the Bronze Age. The overall structure was built facing north (towards the River Bride), with the main five-story tower house on the western side and the bawn on the eastern side towards the friary. The remains of a three-story tower anchor the southeast corner of the bawn. Text from the 1840s state that the bawn was enclosed with two square towers, however any physical evidence of a second tower on the bawn is lost to the undergrowth. In the mid-19th century a cutting of the now disused Cork and Macroom Railway line was built through the moat of the castle on the northern side.

In August 2013, he was kidnapped in Aleppo, Syria, and held captive by militants from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS). On September 2, 2014, ISIS released a beheading video, showing one of its members beheading Sotloff. Following Sotloff's beheading, U.S. President Barack Obama stated that the United States would take action to \\"degrade and destroy\\" ISIS. President Obama also signed an Executive Order dated June 24, 2015, in the presence of the Sotloff family and other hostage families, overhauling how the U.S. handles U.S. hostages held abroad by groups such as ISIS. The capture and beheading of Steven Sotloff, and of fellow journalist James Foley a month prior, initiated broad public awareness of ISIL/ISIS after the beheadings were shown on the Internet and then on international television. Sotloff's legacy is, in part, that he broke the Benghazi story to CNN, that there was no protest, and that he foresaw the massive Syrian Refugee Crisis as he reported on the everyday people's suffering in Syria, thus earning him the reputation as \\"The Voice for the Voiceless.\\"  Early life and education  Steven Sotloff was the son of Arthur and Shirley Sotloff of Pinecrest, Florida,Neighborhood Reacts To Apparent Murder Of Local Journalist Steven Sotloff CBS September 2, 2014 11:59 PM a suburb of Miami, and a grandson of The Holocaust survivors, who inspired him to be \\"a voice for the voiceless.\\" He was the brother of Lauren Sotloff.

His career began during the Arab Spring. Sotloff had worked for the news magazine Time, as well as The Christian Science Monitor, The National Interest, Media Line, World Affairs, and Foreign Policy, and had appeared on CNN and Fox News. His work took him to Syria a number of times, as well as Egypt, Turkey, Libya, and Bahrain. Sotloff was the reporter that broke the Benghazi story, affirming to CNN that there was no protest that caused the killings and destruction, as U.S. media had initially reported. His greatly detailed story was hailed as \\"an excellent piece of journalism\\" by CNN's Suzanne Malveaux. In 2012 he reported in Time magazine about Al-Qaeda fighters and commanders from Libya flocking to Syria and shipping Libyan captured arms and ammunition on its way to join the fight to topple Bashar al-Assad's regime.Steven Sotloff‚Äôs Reporting for TIME (Time magazine website, September 3, 2014Libya's flawed attempt to soak up a flood of weaponry September 30, 2012 (Time website) He was also one of a team of reporters who returned to the compound in Benghazi where the US ambassador and three other Americans had been killed on the night of 9/11 that year.

According to Ann Marlowe, who worked with Sotloff in Libya, \\"he lived in Yemen for years, spoke good Arabic, deeply loved (the) Islamic world\\". Sotloff's journalistic work in Syria interviewing the everyday people suffering, which led to the massive Syrian Refugee Crisis, is in large part what earned him the title of \\"The Voice for the Voiceless\\" by Time, The Telegraph, and NBC News. He was described by those who knew him as a gentle man who \\"was driven to report on the humanitarian dimensions of the conflicts in the Middle East, humbly referring to himself as a \\"stand-up philosopher from Miami\\". Janine Di Giovanni, the Middle East editor of Newsweek, told CNN, \\"He was concerned that he had been on some kind of a list, and this had been around the time that ISIS had been showing up and taking over checkpoints that had been manned before by the rebels. And he thought he had angered some of the rebels, he didn't know which ones, by taking footage of a hospital in Aleppo that had been bombed, and he had been very concerned about this.\\"  Kidnapping and beheading  On July 15, 2013, he arrived in Israel for his former roommate Benny Scholder's wedding and wanted to spend a couple of weeks there.Life and Death of Steven Sotloff, Part 1 Retrieved on 25 Jan 2018 Before his kidnapping he was in Kilis - a town at the border of Turkey and Syria.

His family and government agencies worked privately to gain his release for a year. Sotloff, his family, friends, and previous employers such as The Jerusalem Post went to great lengths to keep his Jewish background and Israeli citizenship a secret from his ISIL captors after Sotloff was shown in the beheading video of James Foley. It is unknown if those attempts had any effect, since the information was online for the duration of his captivity. Following Sotloff's death in September, ISIS published 11 rules that pertained to journalists \\"who wish to continue working in the governorate.\\" The first rule stated that all journalists must swear their allegiance as subjects of the Islamic State. On August 19, 2014, the terrorist organization The Islamic State (IS) released a video titled \\"A Message to America,\\" which showed the beheading of fellow journalist James Foley. At the end of the video, ISIS threatened President of the United States Barack Obama, telling him that \\"his next move\\" would decide the fate of Sotloff. Only days after this threat was released, the U.S. stepped up airstrikes against IS, firing 14 missiles at various ISIS Humvees near the Mosul Dam. Shortly after the release of the video, a petition was started on Whitehouse.gov, which called for President Obama to save Sotloff's life. The petition attracted thousands of signatures within days. On August 27, 2014, Sotloff's mother released a short video asking Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to release her son. Fellow journalists, including Sotloff's friend Oren Kessler, worked intensively for his release. On September 2, 2014, the SITE Intelligence Group discovered the video of Sotloff's killing, titled \\"A Second Message to America\\" and released by Al-Furqan Media Productions, on what they called \\"a file-sharing site\\" and released it to their subscribers.  Tributes  After Sotloff's beheading, tributes flooded in to his family from all over the world, including from The Vatican and Pope Francis, Prime Minister of Israel's Benyamin Netanyahu, President Barack Obama, U.S. senators Bill Nelson and Marco Rubio and the Consul General of Israel to Florida and Puerto Rico. He was memorialized by the U.S. Congress in The Congressional Record. The Architect of the Capitol gave his family a flag that was flown over the U.S. Capitol. The New York Times set up a Legacy Guest Book in Sotloff's honor that would remain open permanently. Grammy Award winner Dave Matthews and his Dave Matthews Band planted 120 trees in Israel in Sotloff's memory, and Matthews personally dedicated his song \\"Mercy\\" to Sotloff.  Awards  Sotloff won numerous awards and honors both during his life and posthumously: * The ADL Daniel Pearl Award (1963‚Äì2002) - given to journalists who have or had a commitment to build cultural bridges and promote understanding. The ADL Daniel Pearl Award recognizes those who, like Daniel Pearl, have attempted to understand developments on the ground and the perceptions of those who are living through the region's seismic changes. Despite the inherent risks of [his] chosen profession, [he] remained tirelessly committed to \\"finding the humanity behind the headlines\\" in Syria and Iraq. * The Radio Television Digital News Foundation (RTDNF)'s Citation of Courage Award - given for the first time ever when presented to Steven Sotloff and James Foley, in recognition of distinguished service to journalism and the extraordinary courage to face danger in search of the truth ... [making] the ultimate sacrifice in pursuit of free and unfettered journalism in the war- torn Syrian region. * The American Society of Journalists and Authors (ASJA)'s Conscience-in-Media Award - for commitment to the highest principles of journalism at notable personable cost, \\"The Conscience in Media award recognizes journalists who knowingly have endured great personal costs while pursuing the highest tenets of their profession.\\" * The Foundation for Defense of Democracies Tribute - FDD's scholars, one of whom was Steven, \\"believe that no one should be denied basic human rights including freedom of religion, speech and assembly; that no one should be discriminated against on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin; that free and democratic nations have a right to defend themselves and an obligation to defend one another; and that terrorism ‚Äì unlawful and premeditated violence against civilians to instill fear and coerce governments or societies ‚Äì is always wrong and should never be condoned.\\" * The Southeastern Association of Journalists's Turkey's Special Prize of the Jury - given for their traditional \\"Year's Successful Journalists.\\" * The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), Florida Heroes Award - awarded by CNN's Larry King, given for Sotloff's \\"demonstration of tremendous courage, compassion, and determination in confronting hate and intolerance.\\"  Memorials  The Steven Sotloff Art Memorial, created by American artist Tracy Ellyn, first opened publicly just days after President Obama toasted to the memory of the slain journalist at the White House Correspondents Dinner of 2015, and just one day after Sotloff's birthday. It currently overlooks the Atlantic Ocean at Greenspoon Marder Law Foundation in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where viewers can face the Middle East in his memory, as his remains were never returned. Another original of the same memorial is placed at Temple Beth Am in Miami, Florida, where he and his family were and continue to be members. The memorial, filled with metaphor and symbolism, contains in its layers some excerpts from the letter that Sotloff smuggled out to his family while held in captivity, when he realized he may not make it out alive. Some of those words are: \\"Do what makes you happy. Be where you are happy. Love and respect each other. Don't fight over nonsense. Hug each other every day. Eat dinner together. Live your life to the fullest and pray to be happy. Stay positive and patient. Everyone has two lives; the 2nd one begins when you realize you have only one.\\" Another memorial, the Steven Sotloff Memorial Garden, spearheaded by Mayor Cindy Lerner of Pinecrest, Florida, is a public place of reflection where Sotloff's family and the public can go and pay their respects to their son. They chose the site in the village of Pinecrest because they had taken Steven to the site as a child when it was Parrot Jungle. The Miami Foundation and Home Depot were involved in its creation.  Foundation  After Sotloff's passing, the Steven Joel Sotloff Memorial 2LIVES Foundation was created. It is named after his most compelling line in the letter he smuggled out to his family during captivity, \\"Everyone has two lives; the 2nd one begins when you realize you have only one.\\" Its vision is to equip journalists with the knowledge and tools they need to tell the important stories of the world in the safest possible way, honoring freedom of speech and freedom of the press, ending impunity, and bringing them home safely under all circumstances. The 2LIVES Foundation has thus far signed on with United Nations/UNESCO, Columbia University School of Journalism, Reuters, Associated Press and others who spearheaded the first ever Global Safety Principles and Practices for journalists in New York on September 30, 2015. The final draft was signed at UNESCO Paris headquarters on February 5, 2016. The group announced unprecedented initiatives to share security information, provide subsidized safety training to freelancers, end impunity, and more. Other media organizations that signed on include CNN, ABC News, CBS News, NBC News, and finally 300+ more. The foundation also worked tirelessly with the U.S. government and senior officials in Washington, D.C. to push for changes to its hostage laws. On June 24, 2015, President Obama signed an Executive Order, in the presence of the Sotloffs and other hostage families, for a broad overhaul regarding how it handles U.S. hostages held abroad by groups such as ISIS. The foundation provides both endowed and individual scholarships for journalism students around the world who have the passion and desire to pursue a career in journalism. To date, scholarships have already been set up in Steven's name at Kimball Union Academy in New Hampshire, University of Central Florida, .and University of Miami The 2LIVES Foundation has partnered with The Media Line, creating its new Press-and- Policy Student Program, to build a scholarship fund that will allow outstanding journalism students from universities around the world to learn and develop their skills, in Steven's name, through on-going participation with a working newsroom and veteran journalists stationed in the region of the world that captivates the interest of news readers worldwide as it did Steven Sotloff. Lawsuit On April 20, 2016, it was announced that the family of Steven Sotloff were seeking $90 million in damages from Syria in U.S. court. The family claims the Assad government provided support for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant which was responsible for his murder.

He is known for his paintings of women at ease in richly decorated interiors or in flower-filled gardens. Early years Francis Coates Jones was born in 1857 in Baltimore, Maryland, into a wealthy family. He attended a Quaker school in Baltimore until he was fourteen. His elder brother was the landscape painter Hugh Bolton Jones (1848‚Äì1927). Europe In 1876 the Jones brothers visited Europe, where Francis became interested in becoming an artist. In London the two brothers stayed with Edwin Austin Abbey (1852‚Äì1911). Jones then spent nearly a year in Pont-Aven, Brittany, where there was a colony of American artists. He made friends there with Thomas Hovenden (1840‚Äì1895). In the fall of 1877 Jones moved to Paris. He taught himself drawing, then was admitted to the antique class of Henri Lehmann at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. In 1878 the two brothers traveled to Spain and Morocco. They met their parents and sister, and made a tour of Europe. Jones returned to Paris and enrolled in the Acad√©mie Julian. There he studied under William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825‚Äì1905) and Jules Joseph Lefebvre (1836‚Äì1911). He made sketching tours in Italy, Switzerland and France. Jones continued to study in France until 1881 apart from a trip to Baltimore in the summer of 1879 and a period in the winter of 1879‚Äì80 when he painted a military panorama in London. He returned to New York in 1881 and shared a studio in the Sherwood Studio Building with his brother. In 1882 he was elected to the Society of American Artists. He then returned to Paris. New York Jones finally moved back to the United States and settled in New York City in 1884, where his work as a figure painter was quickly recognized. Although he did not have to work for a living, he taught portraiture at the Art Students League of New York. He also obtained commissions for illustrations from Scribner's Monthly and The Century Magazine. In October 1893 Scribner's published a set of his views of historic houses in Washington. From 1895 Jones painted murals. In the summers he would make painting expeditions to the Berkshires at South Egremont, Massachusetts. By the 1890s Jones had a solid reputation and began to take a leading role in the art world of New York. Jones taught at the National Academy of Design for over thirty years. For twenty two years he was treasurer of the National Academy of Design. From 1917 to 1930 Jones was a trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Around 1907 Jones, his brother and their invalid sister Louise moved into an expensively furnished studio and home at 33 West Sixty-seventh Street in Manhattan. In 1929 Jones experienced a stroke that left him acutely paralyzed. He died in 1932. Work In his early work Jones depicted genre scenes in richly decorated interiors. His technique was precise, academic and detailed. He was always interested in costumes and decorations. He became attracted to themes of classical antiquity, and started to paint subjects in classical costumes surrounded by decorative objects from that era. His later work showed the influence of impressionism. These more loosely executed works after 1910 often showed women at ease in outdoor as well as indoor settings. At the 1885 annual show of the National Academy of Design Jones's picture Exchanging Confidences won the Thomas B. Clarke Prize for best figure composition. Jones also won prizes from the Saint Louis Exposition and the Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition of 1915. His works is exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Wichita Art Museum. The Art Institute of Chicago also holds his work.

The park includes two large tile murals proposed by Paul Whitehill, produced by Images In Tile USAImages In Tile USA Official Website and designed by artists Chris AuckermanChris Auckerman Official Website and Jon White. The park also features a bifurcated red sports car that anyone on pilgrimage can slide up beside and have a quickie photograph taken. Close to the intersection of 7th Street and Main, the mural covers the south side of Pearl Brothers, the iconic green hardware store of downtown Joplin. Near that same intersection, US Route 66 once shifted west and headed into Kansas.  History  During the 1960s and 1970s, urban renewal was demolishing one historical building after another in the downtown district of Joplin, but there were some benefits of the renewal. In 1970, city planners wedged a small park called \\"Mall Park\\" between some of the major 7th street buildings. The park connected a large back-alley parking lot to the downtown district, shifting the focus from wheel traffic to foot traffic and making the high-rise merchandising stores more accessible to any who parked off of the main drag. Over time, the intricate brickwork of this park began to deteriorate and work was required to breathe new life into once heavily trafficked public space. Paul Whitehill proposed the idea to create a Route 66 mural for Joplin to Chris Auckerman and Jon White of Images in Tile USA's art department. After much thought and planning, vision became art. Local sponsors assembled and helped them design the lower mural for tourists and visitors as a memorable photo opportunity, one that captures Joplin's place on Route 66. Europeans make the trek across Route 66 every year and even more for the festivals ‚Äì 15,000 visitors from 25 states and 14 countries came to Joplin, Missouri, Springfield, Missouri, and other towns along the route simply for the Route 66 International Festival. These are the kinds of visitors the city claims to be attracting. Other photo opportunities like the mural park have cropped up in the wake of the growing trend. This trend may have come about through the 2006 release of the animated film Cars which tossed a spotlight upon the country-wide effort to both save and restore local U.S. Route 66 main street businesses in any town that was bypassed and forgotten during the interstate system shift. Though big enough in population to withstand the effects of I-44 interstate pulling business both south and east of the city's historic hub, Joplin was affected in a parallel manner to the tiny mining and tourist towns that once peppered the landscape of Route 66 ‚Äì primarily through the surge of national chains like Walmart and McDonald's that neutered the reach of mom-and-pop shops. Through renewed interest in the Mother Road, international media coverage of the 2011 Joplin tornado, and its ongoing underground art revival, Joplin's downtown got its groove back. All of the downtown murals track this progress. After years of planning, the city dedicated Route 66 Mural Park during the first Third Thursday of the 2013 season. Once they had affixed the murals to Pearl Brothers, they dedicated them at the international Route 66 festival during the seventh season of Joplin's Third Thursday art walk. The public park had been neglected for twenty years. The site features a large mockup of a 45 record cut into the walkway, the center of which swaps out to accommodate the divergent spirits of various special events. A concrete slab nearby has been retrofitted into an all-weather map of the four states, with an emphasis on Missouri, Kansas, and Oklahoma. They marked the entrance by a retaining wall with a clean-cut emboss reading \\"Route 66 Joplin, Missouri.\\" A string of Route 66 tile murals will span the winding path from up in Chicago all the way down to Santa Monica, but Joplin received the first in the series.http://www.fourstateshomepage.com/story/d/story/live-at-route-66-mural- park-part-1/23088/Kk7G3wUQVkmXw8IFoHSawA KSN Interview with Patrick Tuttlehttp://route66news.com/2013/03/11/more-about-the-joplin-murals/  References   Category:Parks in Missouri Category:U.S. Route 66 in Missouri Category:2013 establishments in Missouri ","title":"Route 66 Park"},{"id":"43613145","text":"Robert Thomas \\"Trigger Tom\\" Jenkins (August 16, 1923 ‚Äì November 23, 2001) was an American football halfback at University of Alabama and the United States Naval Academy.

It was the tenth edition of the bowl game. After trailing for most of the game, with just over a minute to play, Georgia Tech's Willie Clay returned a punt 63 yards to the Stanford 31. Quarterback Shawn Jones scored on a one-yard touchdown plunge with 14 seconds remaining and the Yellow Jackets completed a 2-point conversion to take an 18‚Äì17 victory. Teams =Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets= After being named national champion by the Coaches' Poll in the previous season, Georgia Tech was coming off an uneven season, and a disappointing loss to rival Georgia. The team was led by its defense, including linebacker Marco Coleman, defensive back Willie Clay (who also returned punts), and lineman Coleman Rudolph. =Stanford Cardinal= Stanford started the season 1‚Äì3 before recovering to win the last seven games of the season, including a Big Game win over rival and #6 ranked California. The Cardinal offense was led by \\"Touchdown\\" Tommy Vardell, who had rushed for 1,084 yards and 20 touchdowns during the season, and quarterback Steve Stenstrom, who led the Pac-10 in passing. Game summary Stanford took the opening kickoff and drove 48 yards on six plays, with Vardell scoring from six yards out. The Yellow Jackets answered with a touchdown drive of their own, 60 yards in 10 plays, tying the game on a two- yard pass from quarterback Shawn Jones to Michael Smith. Georgia Tech got on the board again as time expired in the first quarter with a 24-yard Scott Sisson field goal. In the second quarter, the Cardinal tied the game on a 38-yard Aaron Mills field goal, and then took the lead on another Vardell run, this one for two yards. In addition to the two touchdowns, Vardell rushed for 104 yards on the day and was named Stanford's MVP of the game. Stanford held the lead through the third quarter, but the Yellow Jackets had a huge scoring opportunity when Cardinal punter Paul Stonehouse fumbled a low snap at the Stanford 18 yard line. Georgia Tech drove to the Stanford one-yard line, but Rodney Williams fumbled, and Stanford linebacker Tom Williams recovered the ball to keep Stanford's lead into the final quarter. As time ran down in the fourth quarter, Stanford still had a 7-point lead but was forced to punt with 1:41 left. Georgia Tech's Clay fielded the punt at his own six-yard line and made the play of the game: he returned the punt 63 yards to the Stanford 31. From there, the Yellow Jackets drove to the Stanford goal line and scored on a one-yard rush from Jones (who was named Georgia Tech's game MVP) to make the score 17‚Äì16 with 14 seconds left in the game. Instead of opting for a tie, Tech head coach Bobby Ross called for the two-point conversion and sent Jimy Lincoln over the right end to give Georgia Tech the victory. =Scoring= First quarter *Stanford - Tommy Vardell 6-yard run (Aaron Mills kick) *Georgia Tech - Michael Smith 2-yard pass from Shawn Jones (Scott Sisson kick) *Georgia Tech - Sisson 24-yard field goal Second quarter *Stanford - Mills 38-yard field goal *Stanford - Vardell 2-yard run (Mills kick) Third quarter *No scoring.

Stanford hired Bill Walsh to replace Green the next season, and primarily on the strength of Green's recruits, including quarterback Stenstrom, won the Blockbuster Bowl and ended the season with a #9 ranking. Stenstrom would play five NFL seasons; Vardell was picked ninth in the 1992 NFL Draft by the Cleveland Browns and played eight NFL seasons. Georgia Tech hired Bill Lewis as its next coach; he was fired in his third season after failing to have a winning record in all three seasons.

Accidental inhalation of hydrocarbon fuels can occur during fire breathing, fire eating, or other fire performance, and may lead to pneumonitis. Symptoms can vary significantly among individuals, ranging from asymptomatic to a severe, life-threatening disease. Onset usually occurs within hours, though symptoms may not appear for several days. Lipoid pneumonia is a rare condition, but is an occupational hazard of fire performers. Signs and symptoms Fire breather‚Äôs pneumonia usually presents with certain non- specific symptoms, and may vary significantly among individuals. The most common symptoms include: *Cough *Dyspnea (shortness of breath) *Chest pain *Fever *Weakness *Hemoptysis (coughing up blood) Acute pneumonitis typically begins asymptomatic, with a worsening of symptoms over the course of hours or days. Following aspiration of fuel, there is often a period of latency from 8‚Äì24 hours before the symptoms occur. Patients may not recall a specific instance of aspiration. Severe cases may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Causes Fire breather‚Äôs pneumonia is caused by the entrance of hydrocarbon fuels into the bronchial tree, usually due to accidental aspiration or inhalation during a fire performance show. Fire breathing, or fire blowing, is the act of creating a plume of fire by blowing a mouthful of fuel in a fine mist (atomization) over a source of ignition. Fire eating, or fire swallowing, is the act of putting a flaming object into the mouth and extinguishing it. In both disciplines, the performer holds their breath until the air is clear of vapors, so as to not inhale the hazardous fumes. However, improper technique or an accident can lead to ingestion, inhalation, or aspiration of fine droplets or vapors. Fire breathing and fire eating are separate acts, but the terms are sometimes erroneously used interchangeably in the literature. Fuel ingestion can also occur due to siphoning by mouth of fuel products. Once inhaled, these fuels induce an inflammatory reaction in lung tissue. They are not metabolized by tissue enzymes, but undergo emulsification and become engulfed by macrophages which, with time, may disintegrate and release oily substances surrounded by fibrous tissue and giant cells. =Fuels= Fire breathing is typically performed with a high flash point fuel, such as lamp oil (liquid paraffin), while fire eating is performed with low flash point fuels, such as white gas or naphtha. Highly purified fuels are preferred by fire performers due to their minimized toxicity, but other, more dangerous fuels may sometimes be used, such as ethanol, isopropanol, kerosene, gasoline, or charcoal lighter fluid. All fuels run the risk of causing pneumonitis if inhaled, however longer chain oils are more persistent than smaller molecules. Alcohols and volatile naphthas are likely to be absorbed or expelled from the body by evaporation and respiration. Diagnosis Exogenous lipid pneumonia is rare in the general population, but occupational accidents may not be uncommon in fire performers. Diagnosis is usually made on the basis of history of exposure to hydrocarbon fuels, symptoms, and radiological findings. The radiological findings are nonspecific, and the disease presents with variable patterns and distribution. For this reason, lipoid pneumonia may mimic many other diseases, and the diagnosis is often delayed. Chest X-rays taken shortly after the accident may or may not be abnormal, but typically over time show infiltrates in the lower lobes of the lungs. High-resolution CT will frequently demonstrate abnormalities, including opacities, pleural effusion, consolidation, or pulmonary nodules. Histopathology of lung biopsy or bronchoalveolar lavage may indicate lipid-laden macrophages. Laboratory results may show highly elevated inflammatory markers. Treatment The course of treatment of fire breather's pneumonia remains controversial. Administration of bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and prophylactic antibiotics to prevent secondary infection is a common course of treatment. Some studies suggest that steroids may improve outcomes in severely affected individuals, yet these data are only based on a limited number of patients. The use of gastric decontamination to prevent subsequent pulmonary injury from hydrocarbon ingestion is controversial. It may have potential benefit in large (> 30 cc), intentional ingestion of compounds with systemic toxicity. Prognosis after peak symptoms is typically good, with most patients making a full recovery in weeks to months.

It is being built by the Airports Authority of India (AAI) over an area of 320 hectares. The project entails construction of a new 2300 metre runway, a terminal building measuring 5100 square metres to handle 200 passengers during peak hour, Air Traffic Control Tower and Technical block and Fire station with provisions for commercial activities such as a hotel, convention centre. The apron will measure 115 metres by 106 metres, suitable for parking two Airbus A321 aircraft. Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for the project on 9 February 2019. History In 2007, the State Government had chosen Banderdeva, 25 km from Itanagar, as a suitable location for the project. The then Home Minister, Shivraj Patil, laid the foundation stone on 20 February 2007 for the project. However, the technical committee of the AAI rejected the site and recommended Holongi as an alternative site for the project in 2011. AAI had recommended Holongi on grounds of operational safety, lower costs of construction and ease of future expansion. The Holongi site lay on flat ground, had better usability in poor weather and offered scope for easy construction and expansion. The Banderdeva site, on the other hand, was surrounded by hilly terrain and permitted operation of aircraft from only one direction. The cost of construction was estimated at Rs. 980 crore for Banderdeva, as against Rs. 650 crore for the Holongi site. The differences between AAI and the state government caused a dispute that resulted in the project getting delayed. The Prime Minister‚Äôs Office (PMO) eventually stepped in to put an end to the dispute in July 2012 and the Holongi site was finalised. Features * The Hollongi airport will hold strategic relevance for the country, and will also have various sustainability features. A green belt along the approach road which will act as a noise barrier, is also planned for the airport project. A technology for harvesting rainwater will be utilized at the airport, along with energy-efficient equipment.https://www.financialexpress.com/infrastructure/airlines- aviation/fly-to-itanagar-soon-aai-awards-construction-work-for-hollongi- greenfield-airport-in-arunachal-pradesh/1863051/ *The airport will have a single 2,300 metre runway oriented east-west in the first phase, to serve Narrow-body aircraft and can be extended to 2,800 metres to land Wide-body aircraft.

In addition they are important in protecting cells from death caused by damage or inflammation.  Family members  There are seven types of Reg genes present in the mouse mainly located on chromosome 6 but only five (REG1A, REG1B, REG3A, REG3G, and REG4) have been shown to be present in the human on chromosome 2.  Function  Reg proteins are involved in the growth and differentiation of cells from various organs under normal and disease conditions. These proteins function as acute phase reactants, lectins, antiapoptotic factors or growth factors for pancreatic Œ≤-cells, neural cells and epithelial cells in the digestive system. These C-type lectins contain a single carbohydrate recognition domain and once secreted, these soluble proteins act in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner to exert their effects on their cognate receptors, where they may stimulate an anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, or regenerative response depending on the tissue type. Cytokines such as IL-22 are major regulators of the expression of Reg proteins.  Clinical significance  Reg family members such as REG1A and REG1B are associated with various diseases such as diabetes and gastrointestinal cancer. Reg expression has been associated with islet regeneration in pancreas that may be important for islet transplantation and for diabetes therapy and for cancer studies. The mouse Reg1, Reg2, and Reg3Œ¥, expressed by Œ≤-cells and acinar cells respectively, have been shown to be linked with pancreatic Œ≤-cell regeneration in the mouse by activating cyclin D1 and promoting Œ≤-cell cycle progression. Reg2 is substantially up-regulated in the pancreatic islets, particularly in the Œ≤-cells following mycobacterial adjuvant treatment. This is related to the induction of Th17 cells by adjuvant treatment and these cells produce Interleukin-22 (IL-22). Pancreatic islets express high levels of IL-22 receptor and IL-22 has been shown to induce islet beta cell regeneration.

An additional population of Afshar tribes-people is located in the Kuchan area in Razavi Khorasan Province of Iran and city of Kerman. Carpets in the Afshar style are known for their stylized floral geometric designs, tribal artistry, and a characteristic palette of rust and blue color tones. History Since the Safavid period, the Turkic tribal group Afshar migrated from their origins in Central Asia to settle in Iranian Azerbaijan, Azerbaijan republic, and Eastern Turkey.MacDonald, Brian W. (1997). Tribal Rugs: Treasures of the Black Tent. Woodbridge, Suffolk, England: Antique Collectors' Club. pp. 115-116. This background has led to the inclusion of regional influences on Afshar weaving, resulting in a distinctive aesthetic that incorporates elements of several village and nomadic Persian rug styles, as well as Southern Persian design influences.MacDonald, Brian W. pp. 116-117. Caucasian rug influences are also strongly felt.Aschenbrenner, Erich. (1981). Oriental Rugs, Volume 2: Persian. Woodbridge, Suffolk, England: Antique Collectors' Club. p. 215. Design Afshar bag Antique Afshar rugs from the 19th century are characterized by their quality of craftsmanship and wool. Colors are saturated: deep indigo, carnelian, saffron and ochre tones predominate. While complex repeating all- over designs are prevalent, Afshar weavers also drew upon Southern Persian carpet imagery, with boteh motifs, shrub and occasionally \\"Tree of Life\\" compositions also encountered.

These include colour cosmetics, like foundation and mascara, skincare such as moisturisers and cleansers, haircare such as shampoos, conditioners and hair colours, and toiletries such as bubble bath and soap. The manufacturing industry is dominated by a small number of multinational corporations that originated in the early 20th century, but the distribution and sale of cosmetics is spread among a wide range of different businesses. The largest cosmetic companies are Johnson & Johnson, L'Oreal Paris,Gillette, Neutrogena, Nivea and Chanel, Inc. The market volume of the cosmetics industry in Europe and the United States is about EUR ‚Ç¨70b per year, according to a 2005 publication.G√ºnther Schneider, Sven Gohla, J√∂rg Schreiber, Waltraud Kaden, Uwe Sch√∂nrock, Hartmut Schmidt-Lewerk√ºhne, Annegret Kuschel, Xenia Petsitis, Wolfgang Pape, Hellmut Ippen and Walter Diembeck \\"Skin Cosmetics\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. The worldwide cosmetics and perfume industry currently generates an estimated annual turnover of US$170 billion (according to Eurostaf ‚Äì May 2007). Europe is the leading market, representing approximately ‚Ç¨63 billion.  By region  = United States = Within the United States, the state of California has the largest concentration of beauty establishments in America at 25.5%, followed by New Jersey at 8.1% of American beauty establishments. Since 2016, the number of cosmetic stores rises between 3 and 4% each year and employment in this division is rising each year 13-16%.(NAICS 44612): Cosmetics & Beauty Supplies Stores.‚Äù United States Remediation Services Industry Report, Jan. 2019, pp. 1‚Äì196. EBSCOhost, search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db;=bth&AN;=134174715&site;=eds- live&scope;=site. California has the largest concentration due to social media marketing from celebrities and ‚Äòbeauty gurus‚Äô. For example, Kylie Jenner's company Kylie Cosmetics, is valued at $800 million and sold an estimated $330 million worth of makeup in 2017. YouTube and social media influencers Jeffree Star (Jeffree Star Cosmetics), and Michelle Phan (Ipsy), and pop-star Rihanna with her Fenty Beauty line of cosmetics, have also contributed to California's rising popularity in the beauty industry. Because the US dollar is so valuable to other countries around the world, it has become extremely expensive for most countries to import American beauty products and to export their own products to America. However, there are a few countries with beauty products that are in popular demand in America due to their quality and value including France, Canada, Italy, and the United Kingdom. As of 2018, ‚ÄúThese four countries account for 45.2% of all industry imports as domestic consumers demand luxury products‚Äù. South Korean and Japanese skincare products which are designed to be more gentle and innovative, are also becoming more popularized in the United States due to their quality and affordability. The U.S has held the same regulation over this industry since 1938 under the FD&C; Act, which has gained additional amendments over time.Salvador, Amparo, and Alberto Chisvert. Analysis of Cosmetic Products. Elsevier, 2017. EBSCOhost, search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db;=cat06111a&AN;=unm.EBC5149982&site;=eds- live&scope;=site. = Canada = Canada is a big influencer in the American beauty industry due to its proximity to the United States and because it falls under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This agreement ‚Äúeliminates most tariffs on products traded between Canada, Mexico, and the United States,\\" and allows Canada to trade superfluously. Canada accounts for an estimated 13.6% of imports and 19.9% of cosmetic exports in 2018. Because Mexico also benefits from the NAFTA trade agreement, they represent another top cosmetic importer and exporter for lower-priced beauty products which are manufactured in mass and sold in large drug store chains in America. =France= Cosmetic sales in France reached ‚Ç¨6.5 billion in 2006, according to FIPAR (F√©d√©ration des Industries de la Parfumerie ‚Äì the French federation for the perfume industry). France is another country in which the cosmetic industry plays an important role, both nationally and internationally. Most products with a label, \\"Made in France\\" are valued on the international market. According to data from 2008, the cosmetic industry has grown constantly in France for 40 consecutive years. Famous cosmetic brands produced in France include Vichy, Yves Saint Laurent, Yves Rocher, Bioderma and L'Oreal. L'Oreal is known for its mass production of hair and makeup products which are produced in mass and sold in drug stores in America as well as internationally. L'Oreal has gained popularity especially due to its app Makeup Genius which allows users to try on makeup using their phone camera in addition to working with Los Angeles-based NYX Cosmetics and Estee Lauder's MAC Cosmetics, L'Oreal is one of the leading cosmetic brands in the United States. According to the company's latest financial report of 2017, North America accounted for 13.6% of the company's global cosmetic sales. Life Pharmacy at Westfield Albany on the North Shore of Auckland, New Zealand =Germany= In Germany, the cosmetic industry generated ‚Ç¨12.6 billion of retail sales in 2008, which, at the time, made the German cosmetic industry the third largest in the world after Japan and the United States. It has been shown that Germany's cosmetic industry grew nearly 5 percent in one year, from 2007 to 2008. German exports in this industry reached ‚Ç¨5.8 billion in 2008, whereas imports of cosmetics totaled ‚Ç¨3 billion. Germany gains most of its imported cosmetics from France, Switzerland, the United States and Italy. =Italy= The Italian cosmetic industry is also an important player in the European cosmetic market. Although not as large as in other European countries, the cosmetic industry in Italy was estimated to reach ‚Ç¨9 billion in 2007. The Italian cosmetic industry is however dominated by hair and body products and not makeup as in many other European countries. In Italy, hair and body products make up approximately 30% of the cosmetic market. Makeup and facial care, however, are the most common cosmetic products exported to the United States. = Belarus = The Belarusian cosmetics market consists of Belarusian companies. There are more than 20 cosmetic companies in Belarus - Belita, Vitex, Lux Visage, Mastige, Modum, Rekish Cosmetics. The volume of the cosmetic market is more than 300 million euros per year = Asia = The cosmetic industry in Asia is mainly dominated by regional cosmetic brands. Shiseido Co. LTD, A popular cosmetic brand based in Japan, has 82.1% of its sales in Asia. No other Western company in the top 10 match these kinds of regional sales. Furthermore, geographic dispersion of sales by Asian cosmetic companies in Asia accounted for 92.42% of sales, while geographic dispersion of assets of Asian cosmetic companies in Asia was 87.05%. Western cosmetic companies often have failed to gain footholds in various countries. For example, in Japan, many advertisement campaigns that find success in the West, such as celebrity appearances and references to science, did not sway a sample group of respondents to purchase the foreign brands. However, despite the lack of Western cosmetic presence, the growing trend of ‚Äúfair skin‚Äù, or whiting one's skin, can expose consumers skin to harmful chemicals when using ‚Äúfairness creams‚Äù. Due to recent significant economic growth in many Asian markets, regulation pertaining to chemicals in cosmetic products has been lacking. SK-II, a cosmetic product owned by P&G;, was found to contain banned heavy metals in China in 2006. Another study found that women who had recently moved to Vancouver, Canada from East and South Asia had higher levels of lead in their blood than South and East Asian immigrants who had been living in Canada for longer. One of sources of lead was determined to be some facial powders marketed various regions of Asia. Fashion designer collaboration Due to the popularity of cosmetics, especially fragrances and perfumes, many designers who are not necessarily involved in the cosmetic industry came up with different perfumes carrying their names. Moreover, some actors and singers have their own perfume line (such as Celine Dion). Designer perfumes are, like any other designer products, the most expensive in the industry as the consumer pays not only for the product but also for the brand. . Marketing The cosmetic industry worldwide seems to be continuously developing, now more than ever with the advent of the Internet companies. Many famous companies sell their cosmetic products online also, in countries in which they do not have representatives. Research on the email marketing of cosmetics to consumers suggests they are goal-oriented with email content that is seen as useful, motivating recipients to visit a store to test the cosmetics or talk to sales representatives. Useful content included special sales offerings and new product information rather than information about makeup trends.  Colorism  Many companies advertise white or light skin as not only a cosmetic change, but a lifestyle change. White beauty implies a lifestyle of ‚Äúsophistication, beauty, power, and wealth.‚Äù Mass advertising and marketing from the US and Europe, as well as multiple mass media forms are used to reach other cultures to influence their purchasing habits. Many of the skin lightening products sold usually have celebrity endorsements, further increasing sales and the desire for lighter skin. These products can cause serious damage to skin and pose a health risk to the consumer. In a study done by S. S. Agrawal and Pallavi Sharma on eleven skin lightening products sold in India, it was found that ‚Äúmercury was detected in all the samples of the skin lightening creams in the range of 0.14‚Äì0.36 ppm.‚Äù This study also observed that none of the brands tested include mercury as an ingredient on the packaging, which may mislead consumers regarding health risks. In a report by the World Health Organization, it was stated that ‚Äúskin whitening products can cause leukemia, liver and kidney cancer and could also result in severe skin conditions.‚Äù Though these health risks exist, women of color in many parts of the world are purchasing skin lightening creams. Choma and Prusaczyk's survey of women of color in the US and India ‚Äúshow[s] that chronic surveillance of skin tone predicts skin tone dissatisfaction and skin bleaching.‚Äù Some companies in the cosmetic industry have capitalized off of the cultural pressure and standards for having lighter skin. This study concluded that ‚Äúskin bleaching is not merely a physical or aesthetic change, but one with potentially wide-ranging implications on psychological well-being and, more broadly, the perpetuation of racist ideologies and beauty standards.‚Äù Palm oil Palm oil is found in lipstick, and shampoo. Palm oil is connected to the destruction of forests and habitats of endangered species, including orangutans, tigers, elephants, and rhinosProducts containing palm oilHow the world got hooked on palm oil  Animal Testing  Animal testing has been a large controversy in the cosmetic industry. Animal tests performed include the Draize eye irritancy test, where test chemicals are applied to rabbits‚Äô eyes and left on for several days, and toxicity tests such as LD50, where a substance's toxicity is tested by determining the concentration at which it will kill 50% of the test animals. Due to public outcry as well as financial and temporal considerations, animal testing in cosmetics has steadily been decreasing over time and replaced with non-animal tests. One of these non- animal tests is the Environmental Protection Agency‚Äôs ToxCast which has a similar accuracy compared to animal tests but achieves results with fewer economic costs and less time. An EU ban of marketing cosmetic products which have been tested on animals became effective in 2013. There are a few exceptions to this law. Animal testing data for cosmetics can be used if the data for the ingredient used in the cosmetic originated from testing for non- cosmetic products. Secondly, if a country outside of the EU requires animal testing and the cosmetic product was tested in that country, the ban also does not apply. Cosmetic tests on animals are still legal in several countries, such as the US, Japan, Russia, and China. There are a number of cosmetics companies that claim they are ‚Äúcruelty-free,‚Äù such as Bath & Body Works, Aveda, ELF, and Milani, but some argue that because the label of ‚Äúcruelty- free‚Äù both lacks regulation and standardized third-party certification, it has little real weight. Brands that claim to be cruelty free often advertize this with a logo of a rabbit on their products.

The film holds a 33/100 score at Metacritic, and a 20% score at Rotten Tomatoes. The Los Angeles Times commented: \\"Despite its true-events pedigree, Kidnapping Mr. Heineken is woefully captive to B-movie crime saga tropes.\\" Variety: \\"About as appealing as day-old beer littered with cigarette butts, the abysmal caper drama Kidnapping Mr. Heineken is one of those international co-productions produced for all the right tax-credit reasons and none of the right artistic ones.\\" Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter: \\"By the time the relatively brief but seemingly interminable proceedings reach their conclusion, viewers may feel like they've been held hostage themselves.\\" Conversely, Rex Reed of The New York Observer gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, and commented: \\"Anthony Hopkins plays the king of the hops, and he is excellent.

The first manor house built on this site was constructed in the 15th century. Having been owned by the Walpole family since the 18th century, it is now the seat of Robert Walpole, 10th Baron Walpole. The house is only open to the public by appointment. The Gardens however are open in the summer on Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays.  Etymology  The name Mannington devolved from the Anglo-Saxon language and has the meaning of the enclosure (tun or ton) owned by the people (ing or ingus) of Manna‚Äôs.  History  Mannington is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. In the great Survey it is under the name Manctura. Before 1066 the manor had been held by Godwin but at the time of the survey it was held by the King and the Norman nobelman William de Warenne. There stood on the site an ancient house which in 1291, after many changes came into the possession of Maude Turrell who was the daughter and heiress of Walter Turrell of Mannington and Itteringham. She married a man called Walter Hewell who also had an alias of Dennell. By her own right Maude was lord of the manor and when she married her second husband, Henry Lumner (also spelt Lumnor), The Lumnor family Henry, took possession of the house and manor in 1401 and held it in right of his late wife, the heiress of Maude Dennell. Henry died shortly after and the land and possessions passed to his son and heir William Lumner. He in turn left it to his son also William Lumnor. It was this William Lumner who decided to rebuild Mannington Hall, the house that stands today, he was the brother of Margaret Paston and a trusted friend of the Paston family. In a letter to John Paston dated 1460, Lumnor invited his friend Paston to visit his new house if he was in the area. In the same letter Lumnor asks Paston to supply him with Oak from the Paston estate to use on his new house at Mannington. In Nikolaus Pevsner‚Äôs Buildings of England, North-east Norfolk and Norwich, he claims that a licence to crenellate was obtained by Lumnor in 1451. However this is incorrect, Mannington was never built under such a licence. Lumnor had set several small guns on his battlements which he had constructed from stone and black knapped flint. Inside the house on the wooden wall covering or wainscot he installed his family coat of arms of Lumner impaling Monivaux. The construction of the house was completed by 1460 and William Lumnor died around 1491. After being in the possession of several generations the Lumnor family, they sold the house and estate to the Potts family in 1585. The Potts family Prior to their purchase of the estate the Potts family had been established in Mannington for many generations. Records show that in the year 1274 a man from Manningham called William Potts was sued by a William Tirrell for encroaching and appropriating to himself the fee of a certain highway extending from Mannington to the river Cam. When the hall came into the possession of John Potts he was a student in Lincoln's Inn and who became a lawyer of eminence and reputation. He was married to Anne Dogge daughter of John Dodge.John Burke, John Bernard Burke A genealogical and heraldic history of the extinct and dormant baronetcies He died in 1600 and is buried in the parish church of Saint Mary (Now in Ruins). John Potts son was also called John and was elected Member of Parliament for Norfolk in the Long Parliament.History of Parliament Online - Potts, Sir John He was knightedKnights of England by King Charles I and was created a baronet by letters dated on 14 August 1641. Despite being honoured by the King he was a staunch Parliamentarian. He became a great friend of Oliver Cromwell. Cromwell visited Potts on numerous occasions whilst staying at the nearby Irmingland Hall, Oulton, the home of Lt General Charles Fleetwood. Even though he supported the Parliamentarian side during the Civil war he was eventually excluded from Parliament under Pride's Purge in 1648. Potts returned to Parliament in 1660 when he was elected MP for Great Yarmouth in the Convention Parliament. During the 1720s the Potts family‚Äôs fortunes were ruined following the share collapse of the South Sea Company known as the South Sea Bubble. The Potts carried on living at Mannington hall until 1736 when the wife of Sir John Potts (who had died in 1731) died in February 1736. They had no children and due to the financial difficulties, the manor and township with the patronage was sold. It was all purchased for the sum of ¬£20,000 by Horatio Walpole who owned the adjoining estate of Wolterton Hall. The Walpole family Horatio Walpole was the younger brother of Robert Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford, who was a British statesman who is generally regarded as the first Prime Minister of Great Britain. Like his brother, Horatio was also a politician and diplomat, and spend time at the Hague and had also been the Ambassador of France in Paris between 1724 and 1730. When Horatio purchased Mannington from the Potts he was in the process of building himself a new house at Wolterton and has been suggested that the acquiring of the nearby estate of Mannington was to extend the Wolterton estate in to Mannington an to use the hall as a Dower house or possibly a farmhouse. Evidently it was the very low importance that Horatio placed on the hall and its lack of re- development that allowed to go virtually unaltered from the time of the Potts ownership. Manninghton eventually became the main home to the Walpoles when Horatio‚Äôs great great grandson Horatio Walpole, 4th Earl of Orford inherited the two estates in 1858. Horatio the fourth had an interest in antiquity and in gothic architecture and he also thought that Mannington would make a better family home than the grand and formal house at Wolterton. He moved to Mannington and began to make improvements and alteration immediately. During this period of renovation the house was elaborated with architectural features from other Walpole owned properties. The house and estate was passed on to Robert Horace Walpole who was the 5th and last Earl of Orford and he lived at Mannington from 1895 until 1905 when he moved back to Wolterton Hall. Walpole let the house to the consulting dental surgeon Sir Charles Tomes, and a Fellow of the Royal Society. During the First World War, Tomes was the chairman of the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital. He also published a book in 1916 called Mannington Hall and its owners which he wrote with the help of Robert Walpole. Barons Walpole of Walpole In 1931 the estates of Wolterton and Mannington were left to Robert Walpole the 9th Baron Walpole of Walpole (who was related to Robert Horace Walpole the fifth through the 1st Earl Orford). He chose to live at Wolterton Hall, so in 1969 his son Robert took up residence in Mannington Hall. Robert Horatio Walpole became the 10th Baron Walpole on the death of his father in 1989 and is still in residence.  Description  The hall is surrounded on all sides by a moat and in plan is oblong in shape with dimensions of by At the southern end of the house there are two polygonal angled towers with the south west tower being larger than the other. The smaller tower on the south east corner contains a staircase linking the three storeys of the hall. The main entrance to the hall is on the west elevation. This main door is reached by the use of a wood pedestrian drawbridge with a wrought Iron Balustrade either side. The west elevation features a variety of sized mullioned windows with cusped tops. On the south elevation of the hall there are large mullioned windows. The eastern elevation incorporates the main body of the hall via a link building projecting west which according to Pevsner was the kitchen. Link to this projection and running north there is a range of two storey brick and flint domestic and utility buildings with a set of four gable fronted dormer with mullioned windows. The north elevation faces a courtyard which is accessed via a Grade II listed bridge. The courtyard is bordered to the east by the rear of the two storey domestic block. To the west of the courtyard is a Grade II listed wall and a lower flint wall to the north. The main body of the hall is built using alternating courses of knapped flint and iron-stained flint with ashlar dressings. Many of the window mullions and revels are carved from the local carrstone which is found in the north west of Norfolk. The exterior walls of the hall are topped with crenulations or Battlements at the roofline. The roof is covered with Norfolk pantiles and has various chimneys which were added in the mid-19th century of which some have been salvaged from other Walpole properties. On 20 February 1952 Mannington Hall was designated a Grade 1 listed building and it has English Heritage List entry number 1001009.  Public access  Mannington Hall estate is open every day of the year for the public to use the country walks around the estate at no cost although there is a charge for the car park. The gardens are open on a Sunday between 12 pm and 5 pm on Sundays between may and September. In June, July and August the gardens are also open on Thursday and Fridays between 11 am and 5 pm. The house is only open to the public by pre-arranged appointments and to special interest groups and on special events.

Bill Apter's 1Wrestling.com has called Curly Moe one of the \\"silliest characters\\" in pro wrestling history. Professional wrestling career Zalesky trained under Johnny Rodz at \\"The World's Famous\\" Gleason's Gym in Brooklyn. Initially wrestling under the name Diesel, Zalesky's trainer changed his ring name several times, including Curly Man Don, before settling on Diesel Don in late 1989. An agile \\"big man\\", Zalesky could perform dropkicks and a double leg enzuigiri despite weighing over 500 lbs. He trained with fellow students such as Big Sweet William, Kid Krush, and Mondo Kleen while at the facility. He was also the first-ever opponent of Tommy Dreamer, a future Extreme Championship Wrestling star, who debuted on October 28, 1989. Zalesky made his pro wrestling debut the following year in International World Class Championship Wrestling. He was brought in by the Savoldi family as a \\"family friendly\\" character younger wrestling fans could relate to. His \\"gimmick\\" or in-ring persona was based on Curly Howard of The Three Stooges. He not only bore a strong resemblance to Howard but skillfully mimicked his mannerisms both in and outside the ring. His finisher was called the Soitenly Splash and celebrated victories by performing the Curly Shuffle in the center of the ring.Napolitano, George. Championship Wrestling: Masters of Mayhem. Bdd Promotional Book Co, 1991. (pg. 81) The promotion went so far as to claim he was the real-life nephew of Curly and Moe Howard attracting some attention from the media. Zalesky was largely used as a comedy act, who antagonized \\"Boston Bad Boy\\" Tony Rumble and other IWCCW \\"heels\\" with his zany antics, rather than as a serious competitor. In 1991, Zalesky was ranked #445 of the 500 best singles wrestlers in the country by Pro Wrestling Illustrated; he was also interviewed by PWI senior editor Bill Apter on PWI Conference. Post- retirement Weighing in at around 600 lbs. during his career, Zalesky retired due to health problems shortly after IWCCW folded. Following his retirement, Zalesky began teaching ESL (English as a Second Language) to adults in Newark, New Jersey; however, his weight continued to increase over the years. In 2005, his weight reached around 730 lbs. and Zalesky underwent a gastric bypass surgery, resulting in a significant weight loss of 340 lbs. In December 2006, after false reports of his death had circulated the internet, Zalesky issued a public statement to editor Bill Apter regarding his life following his retirement and appeared on 1Wrestling.com. The previous month, he had apparently left a message on the online forums of KayfabeMemories.com to dispel the internet rumors. 1Wrestling.com later included Zalesky's \\"Curly Moe\\" gimmick as one of the \\"silliest characters in wrestling\\" for a special April Fools' Day column in 2010.

After coming in contact with Zadeh's fuzzy logic, in 1968 Moisil also introduced an infinitely-many- valued logic variant and its corresponding LMŒ∏ algebras.Georgescu, G., Iourgulescu, A., Rudeanu, S.: \\"Grigore C. Moisil (1906‚Äì1973) and his School in Algebraic Logic.\\" International Journal of Computers, Communications & Control 1, 81‚Äì99 (2006) Although the ≈Åukasiewicz implication cannot be defined in a LMn algebra for n ‚â• 5, the Heyting implication can be, i.e. LMn algebras are Heyting algebras; as a result, Moisil logics can also be developed (from a purely logical standpoint) in the framework of Brower‚Äôs intuitionistic logic., Theorem 3.6  Definition  A LMn algebra is a De Morgan algebra (a notion also introduced by Moisil) with n-1 additional unary, \\"modal\\" operations: abla_1, \\\\ldots, abla_{n-1}, i.e. an algebra of signature (A, \\\\vee, \\\\wedge, eg, abla_{j \\\\in J}, 0, 1) where J = { 1, 2, ... n-1 }. (Some sources denote the additional operators as abla^n_{j \\\\in J} to emphasize that they depend on the order n of the algebra.Cignoli, R., ‚ÄúThe algebras of Lukasiewicz many-valued logic - A historical overview,‚Äù in S. Aguzzoli et al.(Eds.), Algebraic and Proof-theoretic Aspects of Non-classical Logics, LNAI 4460, Springer, 2007, 69-83. ) The additional unary operators ‚àáj must satisfy the following axioms for all x, y ‚àà A and j, k ‚àà J: # abla_j(x \\\\vee y) = ( abla_j\\\\; x) \\\\vee ( abla_j\\\\; y) # abla_j\\\\;x \\\\vee eg abla_j\\\\;x = 1 # abla_j ( abla_k\\\\;x) = abla_k\\\\;x # abla_j eg x = eg abla_{n-j}\\\\;x # abla_1\\\\;x\\\\leq abla_2\\\\;x\\\\cdots\\\\leq abla_{n-1}\\\\;x # if abla_j\\\\;x = abla_j\\\\;y for all j ‚àà J, then x = y. (The adjective \\"modal\\" is related to the [ultimately failed] program of Tarksi and ≈Åukasiewicz to axiomatize modal logic using many-valued logic.)  Elementary properties  The duals of some of the above axioms follow as properties: * abla_j(x \\\\wedge y) = ( abla_j\\\\; x) \\\\wedge ( abla_j\\\\; y) * abla_j\\\\;x \\\\wedge eg abla_j\\\\;x = 0 Additionally: abla_j\\\\;0 =0 and abla_j\\\\;1 =1. In other words, the unary \\"modal\\" operations abla_j are lattice endomorphisms.  Examples  LM2 algebras are the Boolean algebras. The canonical ≈Åukasiewicz algebra \\\\mathcal{L}_n that Moisil had in mind were over the set L_n = } with negation eg x = 1-x conjunction x \\\\wedge y = \\\\min\\\\\\\\{x, y \\\\\\\\} and disjunction x \\\\vee y = \\\\max\\\\\\\\{x, y \\\\\\\\} and the unary \\"modal\\" operators: : abla_j\\\\left(\\\\frac{i}{n-1}\\\\right)= \\\\; \\\\begin{cases} 0 & \\\\mbox{if } i+j < n \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & \\\\mbox{if } i+j \\\\geq n \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{cases} \\\\quad i \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\} \\\\cup J,\\\\; j \\\\in J. If B is a Boolean algebra, then the algebra over the set B[2] ‚âù {(x, y) ‚àà B√óB  x ‚â§ y} with the lattice operations defined pointwise and with ¬¨(x, y) ‚âù (¬¨y, ¬¨x), and with the unary \\"modal\\" operators ‚àá2(x, y) ‚âù (y, y) and ‚àá1(x, y) = ¬¨‚àá2¬¨(x, y) = (x, x) [derived by axiom 4] is a three-valued ≈Åukasiewicz algebra.  Representation  Moisil proved that every LMn algebra can be embedded in a direct product (of copies) of the canonical \\\\mathcal{L}_n algebra. As a corollary, every LMn algebra is a subdirect product of subalgebras of \\\\mathcal{L}_n. The Heyting implication can be defined as: :x \\\\Rightarrow y\\\\; \\\\overset{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\;y \\\\vee \\\\bigwedge_{j\\\\in J}( eg abla_j\\\\;x) \\\\vee ( abla_j\\\\;y) Antonio Monteiro showed that for every monadic Boolean algebra one can construct a trivalent ≈Åukasiewicz algebra (by taking certain equivalence classes) and that any trivalent ≈Åukasiewicz algebra is isomorphic to a ≈Åukasiewicz algebra thus derived from a monadic Boolean algebra.Monteiro, Ant√≥nio \\"Sur les alg√®bres de Heyting sym√©triques.\\" Portugaliae mathematica 39.1‚Äì4 (1980): 1‚Äì237. Chapter 7. pp. 204-206 Cignoli summarizes the importance of this result as: \\"Since it was shown by Halmos that monadic Boolean algebras are the algebraic counterpart of classical first order monadic calculus, Monteiro considered that the representation of three- valued ≈Åukasiewicz algebras into monadic Boolean algebras gives a proof of the consistency of ≈Åukasiewicz three-valued logic relative to classical logic.\\"  References   Further reading  Boicescu, V., Filipoiu, A., Georgescu, G., Rudeanu, S.: ≈Åukasiewicz-Moisil Algebras.

Announced in 2007, the project aimed to develop a UAV prototype scheduled for flight in 2017, followed by a single- seater flying car whose commercialization could occur the decade after. The Xplorair is a personal air vehicle (PAV). The term \\"flying car\\" is often used by authors referring to the Xplorair project. While it is true that the vehicle has the same rough size as an automobile and is intended to be flown in the future above cities by anyone with a driver's license (thanks to a fully automated, SATS-like flight mode), it has no wheels and won't be driven on roads as a roadable aircraft like the Terrafugia TF-X. Another project of VTOL flying car that doesn't need roads is the Moller M400 Skycar. But unlike the Xplorair, the Moller skycar has rotating ducted fans powered by Wankel engines.  Xplorair PX200  The PX200 (Personal Xplorair 200 km/h) is the single-seater Xplorair model currently in development. A scale model of the Xplorair PX200 was exhibited at Paris Air Show 2013. A radio-controlled flying full-scale model, including a seat but still unmanned, was scheduled for take- off at Paris Air Show 2017. The first manned prototype should be ready before 2020, then certified and brought to market before 2030 at a public price between $60,000 and $120,000. Two-seater and four-seater models are also planned. Main characteristics of the Xplorair PX200: * Dimensions: * Dry weight: * Cruise speed: * Maximum speed: * Cruise altitude: * Range: * Fuel economy: * Use of biofuel from algaculture. Other fuels could be used, like kerosene, methane, hydrogen. * Use of eco-friendly materials, in particular natural fiber (bamboo, linen‚Ä¶)  Early developments  In 2002, French aerospace engineer Michel Aguilar, then 52 years old, retired from DGA to work as a full-time independent contractor on his Xplorair project, a VTOL aircraft where the common rotating airfoils (like propellers, rotors or ducted fans) are replaced by a new type of small jet engine directly fitted within wing's body, the thermoreactor. The aircraft would rely a lot on the CoandƒÉ effect for vertical take-off, increased lift and reduced drag. A four-seater scale model was presented at Paris Air Show 2007. The year after, Aguilar founded the nonprofit organization Xplorair in order to gain expertise from specialized engineering consulting firms.  Thermoreactor jet engine In 2011, Michel Aguilar's thermoreactor project received $2 million over three years in a subsidy from the Government of France through the Defense procurement agency DGA and the DGCIS of the Ministry of the Industry, under their RAPID award scheme supporting innovative technological projects of small and medium enterprises. A consortium gathering Turbomeca, COMAT Aerospace and the Institut Pprime has been formed to evaluate the thermoreactor jet engine and develop the technology. The thermoreactor is a small jet engine, ramjet- pulsejet hybrid. It uses a combustion at constant volume (isochoric) under the Humphrey cycle, whose thermal efficiency is greater (about 20%) than combustion at constant pressure (isobaric) of the Brayton cycle classically used in turbomachinery. The combustion chamber is fed through a control valve and an inlet pipe by compressed air from a rotary vane pump aside in the fuselage, which extracts ambient air and moderately compresses it into a storage tank. The thermoreactor has a square cross section and very compact dimensions (). Thermoreactors are small enough to be fitted within wing's body as an array next to each other. Each thermoreactor develops a thrust of 170 newtons. The Xplorair PX200 includes 20 thermoreactors: 7 in each front wing, and 6 in aircraft tail. During take-off and landing, the 20 thermoreactors work together, providing 3,400 newtons of thrust. The cruise altitude of is reached in 4 minutes for of fuel burnt. Only one thermoreactor at each front wing's tip would then be needed to maintain a cruise speed of . The simultaneous activation of all thermoreactors during flight is still possible and would bring the speed to , at the cost of a poorer fuel efficiency.  CoandƒÉ effect and further developments  In 2008 the project is first supported by Dassault Syst√®mes with the Passion for Innovation Program, EADS Innovation Works (the R&D; department of Airbus) and MBDA. The project evolves in a single-seater aircraft with inverted V-tail nicknamed the Colibri because it would perform a vertical angled take-off like a hummingbird. The exhaust gas temperature (EGT) of the thermoreactor using the Humphrey cycle being lower than in the conventional Brayton cycle by hundreds of degrees, the exhaust airflow out of the propelling nozzles at the trailing edge of the front wings can be directed onto the upper surface of the rear wings. The speedier airflow and the resulting CoandƒÉ effect around the curvature allow a higher lift coefficient and a smaller wingspan. This technique is quite similar to the blown wing used notably on the Breguet 941, Boeing YC-14 and Antonov An-72. Xplorair is also supported since 2013 by Altran Technologies and Sogeti who develop the aerostructure and the avionics of the aircraft, now called the Xplorair PX200 (Personal Xplorair 200 km/h). Since the previous studies, aerodynamics evolved again with an upward V-tail and the use of the CoandƒÉ effect onto the upper surface of rear biplane tiltwings. During take- off or landing, these rear tiltwings rotate 90¬∞ and the leading edge of the lower rear wing connects to the trailing edge of the front wing, directly onto jet nozzles. The exhaust gas follows the curved surface due to the CoandƒÉ effect, and the slipstream is diverted downcast, providing powered lift for VTOL operation. To avoid noise pollution, Sogeti also develops acoustic reflection techniques by shear rate modulation on jet. Reduction of about 15 dB, i.e. 30 times less sound power, is expected. The CoandƒÉ effect is also used on the Xplorair to reduce form drag. While cruising, compressed air is injected as a radial jet at nose and leading edges, orthogonally to the ambient airflow, then covers the whole wetted area. This reduces the form drag, and could even make it negative with enough jet speed. This technique has been tested for the first time in 1918 by French physicist Constantin Chilowsky on shells, then various authors took over the idea to improve projectiles, including Henri CoandƒÉ for his own research on aerodynamics. This is why Aguilar refers to the \\"Chilowsky effect\\" rather than \\"CoandƒÉ effect\\" for this drag reduction scheme. This technique applied in air is similar to the submarine supercavitation technique used in some torpedoes like the VA-111 Shkval. The PX200 aerostructure also allows for wing-in-ground-effect (WIG). The Xplorair could cruise at low altitude above seawater or special highways that would be built for such personal air vehicles, in order to reduce the lift-induced drag and thus improve the fuel efficiency. In June 2014, Aguilar founds the private limited liability corporate entity ACG Aviation to develop the concept further.

It is intended to replace the existing late-1950s to early-1960s Interstate 30 (I-30) bridge, which has reached its end of life. It was partially designed by Santiago Calatrava, and is part of the Trinity River Project and the Horseshoe Project. It was named for Margaret McDermott, an area philanthropist. History Margaret McDermott Bridge during construction in 2016 As part of the Trinity River Project and Horseshoe Project, the Margaret McDermott Bridge was one of three new Santiago Calatrava-designed bridges planned to cross the Trinity River. However, plans for the McDermott Bridge were scaled back, and plans for a third bridge along I-35E were scrapped, due to budget issues. On December 12, 2005, construction of the Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge began, and it opened on March 29, 2012. The Margaret McDermott Bridge was planned to replace the existing I-30 bridge over the Trinity River. It was originally scheduled to begin construction in 2011 and be completed by 2014. However, in late 2011 funding for the bridge was moved to come from within the Project Pegasus initiative, with construction contracts awarded in mid-2012. The new plan featured \\"toned-down\\" elements of its original arch design, although Calatrava was still scheduled to perform the design work. After delays, construction on the bridge began in 2012, costing over $200 million. Specifically, the arched pedestrian and bicycle bridges cost $115 million, while the actual freeway bridge was paid for by the state and cost an additional $120 million. The main concrete part of the bridge, which carries I-30 traffic, opened in 2013. The steel suspension arches on both sides of the bridge, which also house the pedestrian and bicycle paths, are separate from the concrete part. In April 2014, footings for the arches were constructed, while steel fabrication took place at Tampa Steel Erecting Company's plant in Florida. The general contractor, American Bridge, expected steel components to arrive on site in Dallas during the fall of 2014. The steel arches were completed in 2017, and the entire bridge was planned to open by the end of the year. Despite the concrete part of the bridge being open to I-30 traffic, the arched pedestrian and bicycle bridges are still closed, due to concerns with cables that connect the arch to the base of the bridges, and their resistance to heavy winds. When they vibrate from these winds, this has resulted in multiple incidents where the stress from the vibrations caused several cable anchor rods to fail. Furthermore, the stress has also caused the bridges to crack significantly and resulted in multiple occasions in which rods were cracked and twisted, with the small diameter of the rods resulting on putting more stress on them. The lack of testing and the multiple issues plaguing the bridges led to a large dispute; Calatrava blamed the contractor for a lack of testing and using the wrong parts, and state transportation officials blamed Calatrava and the city of Dallas. Due to that, coupled with the need to add additional painting and lighting, there is currently no set date for the arched bridges to open to pedestrian and bicycle traffic. In April 2019, the Dallas City Council approved a repair expected to cost over $7 million and take over three years. The arched pedestrian bridge has resulted in a dispute between the City, TxDOT, and now the engineering firm responsible for the dangerous final product. So far, there are not reports that cables have struck vehicles. Architecture The bridge consists of a conventional concrete pier-and-beam concrete part which has a main span. The concrete part carries 10 main lanes of I-30 traffic with one reversible high-occupancy vehicle lane and four frontage road lanes. The decorative steel arches are both tall, and house paths for bicycle and pedestrian facilities.

It hangs in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum of Boston, Massachusetts. The oil-on-canvas painting measures . Description The title of the painting refers to the mythological story of the abduction of Europa by Zeus (Jupiter to the Romans), Titian is unequivocal about the fact that this is a scene of rape (abduction): Europa is sprawled helplessly on her back, her clothes in disarray.Stephen J. Campbell, \\"Europa,\\" in Eye of the Beholder, edited by Alan Chong et al. (Boston: ISGM and Beacon Press, 2003): 103‚Äì107. In the myth, the god assumed the form of a bull and enticed Europa to climb onto his back. Once there, the bull rode into the sea and carried her to Crete, where he revealed his real identity. Europa became the first Queen of Crete, and had three children with Zeus. The painting depicts Europa on the back of the bull, just off the shore of her homeland. Although the act of sexual violence is not depicted in the painting, it is implied through Europa's open- legged posture and her expression of fear as she is dragged off by Zeus. Yael Even has theorized that Titian could have created this painting not due to any particular attachment to the subject, but in order to assert his abilities as a painter. Even further states that this artwork‚Äôs primary purpose was to show everyone that Titian had eclipsed his master, Bellini, and also to establish that painting was superior to sculpture. Provenance The painting was one of the \\"poesie\\" painted by Titian for Philip II of Spain. With Diana and Callisto and Diana and Actaeon, both now shared by London and Edinburgh, it was one of three Titian poesies given by Philip V of Spain to the French ambassador, the Duke of Gramont, who in turn presented them to Philippe II, Duke of Orl√©ans, Regent of France from 1715‚Äì1723.Brigstocke, Hugh; Italian and Spanish Paintings in the National Gallery of Scotland, p. 183, 2nd Edn, 1993, National Galleries of Scotland, For most of the 18th century it was in the Orleans Collection in Paris.

The film stars Katie Holmes, James Badge Dale, Callan Mulvey and Stephen Bishop. The film was released on November 14, 2014, by Entertainment One Films. Plot Miss Mary Meadows is a young woman who works as a substitute first-grade elementary school teacher who enjoys taking long walks in her suburban neighborhood, wearing traditional clothing and tap-dancing shoes. Unknown to everyone, she is a secret vigilante who kills local thugs who accost her or when she witnesses them committing crimes. She always carries a small semi-automatic pistol in her purse and speaks in a childlike, innocent manner. She lives by herself in a small house and talks occasionally with her mother over the telephone about what she did during the day. Investigating the vigilante killings is a local sheriff. He soon meets and develops an attraction to Miss Meadows due to her old-fashioned clothing and style of speech. When he begins to suspect that the woman he finds himself drawn to may be the suspect he is looking for, the sheriff is torn between whether to arrest or protect her. When Miss Meadows meets an ex-convict named Skylar, who she learns served time for molesting young children, she begins to fear for her young students' safety. When Miss Meadows approaches and threatens to kill Skylar if he continues hanging around the school or around her kids, he begins stalking her. It is eventually revealed that all of the telephone conversations that Miss Meadows has been having with her mother over the course of the film are imaginary. As a young girl, Mary Meadows witnessed her mother's murder in a drive-by shooting outside a local church after attending the wedding of a family friend. This traumatic incident left Miss Meadows so emotionally scarred that she entered a fantasy world in which she imagined that her mother was still alive, then began to go after and kill criminals whom she viewed as a threat to society. The various criminals that Miss Meadows kills on-screen include a trucker who tries to abduct her at gunpoint in the opening scene, a young man who committed a mass shooting at a local diner, and the town's Catholic priest whom Miss Meadows finds sexually molesting a young boy. When Miss Meadows learns that she is pregnant after a sexual encounter with the sheriff, she decides to accept his proposal of marriage. On the day of the wedding, Skylar kidnaps Heather, one of Miss Meadows's students, from her house, forcing Miss Meadows to go to Skylar's house (wearing her wedding dress) to try to stop him, only to end up a captive herself. When she manages to free Heather and struggle with Skylar over her gun, the sheriff, passing by after leaving the church, sees Heather running from Skylar's house as she shouts for help. Meanwhile, Skylar takes Miss Meadows' gun from her purse, aims it at her and asks, \\"Do you really think you can save the world? Well, try saving your self first!\\" Just then, the sheriff arrives and fatally shoots Skylar in the head. Seeing Miss Meadows' gun still clutched in Skylar's hand, he notes \\"it has his prints now\\". He and Miss Meadows proceed back to the church. One year later, Miss Meadows and the Sheriff are married; she still wears her tap shoes and he has taken up the accordion. Now parents to a baby daughter, they are content to be peculiar together. As Miss Meadows prepares to go out before dinner, the sheriff tells her \\"be careful\\"; she replies \\"I always am\\", leaves the house, and does one final little tap dance on the sidewalk. Cast Production Principal photography and production began on August 6, 2013, in Cleveland, Ohio. Release The film premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 21, 2014. The film was released on November 14, 2014, by Entertainment One Films. Reception Miss Meadows received negative reviews from critics.

He is the father of Star-Lord. Publication history Emperor Jason of Spartax first appeared in Marvel Preview #11 and was created by Chris Claremont and John Byrne. Emperor Jason was the father of the Star-Lord character who had been introduced in Marvel Preview #4. In 2000, a character named Prince Jason of Spartax is introduced in Inhumans Vol. 3 #2. He was originally meant to be the same Marvel Preview #11 Jason, but from earlier in time. After 2004 when Peter Quill was introduced into the Earth-616 continuity, the problems that were caused by Quill's presence in the then present-day Marvel Universe were never officially explained by Marvel Comics. In 2013, King J'son of Spartax was introduced in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 #0.1. As reimagined by writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Steve McNiven, this character is definitively identified as being the father of the Star-Lord who existed in the present-day Marvel Universe of Earth-616. Due to the continuity issues that this revised origin story caused, Marvel Comics decided that there were two versions of Star-Lord and that the events of Marvel Preview #11 and other appearances of the \\"classic\\" Star-Lord were to be officially designated as occurring in Earth-791. Fictional character biography When J'son's ship crash lands on Earth, he is taken in by Meredith Quill. The two form a relationship while J'son makes repairs to his ship. Eventually, J'son is forced to leave to return home and fight in a war. He leaves, not knowing Meredith is pregnant with Peter Quill.Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3 #0.1 (Feb. 2013). Marvel Comics. Years later, J'son is revealed to be the King of the Spartax planetary system. J'son joined other members of the Galactic Council to declare the Earth off-limits to extraterrestrial interaction. Once his son defended Earth from a Badoon attack, J'son sent Spartoi soldiers to capture him and his team called the Guardians of the Galaxy. However, the Guardians managed to escape and flee.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 #1. Marvel Comics. In an attempt to finally get rid of the Guardians and make his son join him, all of the Guardians were separately dealt with by the Spartoi and its allies. However, they didn't count with the Guardians' ally Captain Marvel, who saved Peter Quill from J'son and the Spartoi Empire. As he was escaping, Quill discredited J'son to the whole empire revealing him as a heartless murderer. The entire Spartoi Empire rebelled against J'son, who was forced to flee.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 #16. Marvel Comics. With no longer an empire or fortune as seen in The Black Vortex storyline, J'son became the villain known as Mister Knife and started building a criminal empire. He put a bounty on his son, and also assembled the Slaughter Squad to recover the Black Vortex.Legendary Star-Lord #5. Marvel Comics. Because of the price put on his head, Star-Lord began raiding Mister Knife's crime syndicate, unaware that he was dealing with his own father. After the Slaughter Squad managed to finally capture Star-Lord while he was on a date with Kitty Pryde, Mister Knife revealed his identity to his son.Legendary Star-Lord #6. Marvel Comics. After Peter escaped with the help of Kitty Pryde, who traveled all the way from Earth to save him, J'son was tracked down to a planet where Thanos' son Thane is and convinced him to join his cause.Legendary Star-Lord #8. Marvel Comics. After Star-Lord and Kitty Pryde decided to steal the Black Vortex from J'son with the sole purpose to annoy him, Mister Knife sent the Slaughter Lords to hunt them down and recover the Vortex. After numerous failed attempts to recover the Vortex, Mister Knife managed to get his hands on it. As part of a deal with Thane, he submitted to the Black Vortex and used his cosmically enhanced power to encase the entirety of Spartax in his amber construct. The trapped Spartax was later traded to the Brood by Mister Knife, in exchange for taking advantage of their expansion and acquiring one planet for every ten worlds they conquered ever since.Legendary Star-Lord #10. Marvel Comics. At a moment when Captain Marvel retrieved the Black Vortex, she was cornered by Thane and J'son, who demanded she give them the Vortex back. When Thane tried to use his powers to encase Carol in amber, she used the Black Vortex as a shield and deflected the attack towards J'son.Captain Marvel Vol. 8 #14. Marvel Comics. J'son remained encased in the amber construct floating through Spartax's orbit, until he was found by the Collector, who was too late to recover the Vortex, but settled for adding J'son to his collection.Guardians of the Galaxy & X-Men: Black Vortex Omega #1.

Other versions =Earth-791= Jason first appears in Marvel Preview #11, but after Peter Quill's introduction to Earth-616 in 2004, this issue and other appearances of \\"classic\\" Star-Lord have been officially designated as occurring in Earth-791 due to continuity issues. In this issue, Star-Lord meets his father and learns of his past. Years earlier, Jason was summoned by his father when war broke out between the Spartoi and the Ariguans. On his way back home, he was forced to crash land on Earth, where he fell in love with a human woman named Meredith Quill. The two began a year-long relationship before Jason was forced to leave to wage war for Spartax. Wishing to shield Meredith from the pain of his departure, Jason erased her memories of him. Meredith would later go on to give birth to his son Peter Quill. Jason would eventually go on take his father's place as emperor. After telling Star-Lord this story, Jason offered him a place as heir to the throne. Peter refused, and in his stead Jason adopted Kip Holm as future heir.Marvel Preview #11. Marvel Comics. =Inhumans Vol. 3= Jason is from the Spartoi Empire where the Spartoi are a sister race to the Shi'ar, separating from their cousins millions of years ago. He was the only son of the previous Emperor Eson, and therefore was Prince and sole heir to the throne. Rejecting his idealism, the ruling Council of Ministers prevented J'son from taking the throne. The future emperor would be educated, as per Spartax tradition, by being brought up on dozens of the Empire's planets working many professions, including servant, miner, poet, soldier and pilot - excelling in the latter two.Inhumans Vol. 3 #3. Marvel Comics. When Ronan the Accuser of the Kree Empire forced the Inhuman Royal Family to attempt to assassinate the Empress Lilandra, ruler of the neighboring Shi'ar Empire during a wedding ceremony that would symbolically unite the Shi'ar and Spartoi, J'son (who had been seen with the Inhumans) was accused of being part of the plot. For this, he was banished and deemed unworthy of the throne.Inhumans Vol. 3 #4. Marvel Comics. While the events of Inhumans Vol. 3 take place in Earth-616, this incarnation of Jason causes continuity issues with the J'son introduced in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. For this reason, it is assumed that these are two difference characters, although no official explanation has been given for these continuity issues. In other media J'son first appears in the Guardians of the Galaxy episode \\"Don't Stop Believing\\", voiced by Jonathan Frakes. He is the Emperor of Spartax and the father of Peter Quill by Meredith Quill as well as being the father of Captain Victoria. In addition, he is a secret ally of Thanos. The episode \\"Black Vortex\\" Pt. 1 featured a version of J'son called J. Jonah J'son (also voiced by Jonathan Frakes and a spoof of J. Jonah Jameson) who is the boss of Arthur Douglas at the time when the Guardians of the Galaxy entered the Black Vortex mirror. In Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Ego the Living Planet is the father of the Marvel Cinematic Universe version of Star- Lord rather than J'son. Director and writer James Gunn explained why he made the change: \\"I just don't like the character [J'son] very much\\", he said. \\"I also thought it was too much like a Star Wars thing because of the royalty and all of that\\".

Not much is known about Barra's life except through his works. He was born in Metz, but left for Italy in 1608. In Naples he was very successful, especially for his cityscapes. He primarily painted scenes featuring decrepit ruins or near-barren buildings in a nearly- surrealist, apparently post-apocalyptic landscape. Until the mid-twentieth century Barra's works were believed to be by one \\"Mons√π Desiderio\\". However the works formerly attributed to Desiderio have since been identified as the work of at least three artists: Barra, Fran√ßois de Nom√©, who was also from Metz, and a third, as yet unnamed painter. The similarities in both themes and style, and the fact that there were occasions where Barra and de Nom√© collaborated, have made attributions challenging.

A major institution in the early Islamic states, the barid was not only responsible for the overland delivery of official correspondence throughout the empire, but it additionally functioned as a domestic intelligence agency, which informed the caliphs on events in the provinces and the activities of government officials.  Etymology  The etymology of the Arabic word barid has been described by historian Richard N. Frye as \\"unclear\\". A Babylonian origin has been suggested by late-19th-century scholars who offered the following disputed explanation: berƒ´d = Babyl. buridu (for the older *(p)burƒÅdu) = 'courier' and 'fast horse'. It has also been proposed that, since the barid institution appears to have been adopted from the courier systems previously maintained by both the Byzantines and Persian Sassanids, the word barid could be derived from the Late Latin veredus (\\"post horse\\") or the Persian buridah dum (\\"having a docked tail,\\" in reference to the postal mounts).  History  The Muslim barid was apparently based upon the courier organizations of their predecessors, the Byzantines and Sassanids. Postal systems had been present in the Middle East throughout Antiquity, with several pre-Islamic states having operated their own services. A local tradition of obliging the population living next to roads to carry the luggage of passing soldiers and officials, or of having the entire population contribute pack animals to the state as in Ptolemaic Egypt, has been documented since at least the time of the Achaemenid Empire and had been enforced by Roman legislation in the 4th century. The barid operated from Umayyad times, with credit for its development being given to the first Umayyad caliph Mu'awiyah ibn Abi Sufyan (r. 661‚Äì680). Mu'awiyah's successor Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan (r. 685‚Äì705) strengthened the organization, making additional improvements to it after the end of the Second Fitna. The Umayyads created a diwan or government department to manage the system and a separate budget was allocated for its costs. Following the Abbasid Revolution in 750, the barid was further strengthened by the new dynasty and became one of the most important institutions in the government. The second Abbasid caliph al-Mansur (r. 754‚Äì775) placed particular importance on the service and utilized it as an intelligence tool with which he could monitor affairs throughout the empire. Under his successors, oversight of the barid was often entrusted to a prominent official or close associate of the caliph, such as the Barmakid Ja'far ibn Yahya or Itakh al- Turki. After the political fragmentation of the Abbasid Caliphate in the ninth and tenth centuries, the central diwan al-barid was overseen by the Buyids (945‚Äì1055), but the organization seems to have declined during this period. The service was eventually abolished by the Seljuq sultan Alp Arslan (r. 1063‚Äì1072), who considered its capacity for intelligence-gathering to have been diminished. Some other Muslim states, such as the Samanids of Transoxiana, maintained their own barid systems at various times, and in the thirteenth century a new barid was created in Egypt and the Levant by the Mamluk sultan Baybars (r. 1260‚Äì1277).  Functions  = Correspondence and travel = The routes of the barid in Yemen, according to Ibn Khurradadhbih; each dot represents a postal station. The barid provided the caliphs with the ability to communicate with their officials in the various regions under their authority. Its messengers were capable of delivering missives throughout the empire with great efficiency, with reported travel speeds as fast as almost a hundred miles per day. The barid was not a mail service, and did not normally carry private letters sent by individuals; rather it usually only carried correspondence, such as official reports and decrees, between government agents. To facilitate the swift delivery of its messages, the barid maintained an extensive network of relay stations, which housed fresh mounts, lodging and other resources for its couriers. The average distance between each barid station was, at least in theory, two to four farsakhs (six to twelve miles); according to the 9th-century geographer Ibn Khurradadhbih, there were a total of 930 stations throughout the empire. This relay network was flexible and temporary postal stations could be set up as needed; during military campaigns, for example, new barid stations would be established so that a line of communication could be maintained with the advancing army. Besides carrying correspondence, the barid was sometimes used to transport certain agents of the state, providing a form of fast travel for governors and other officials posted to the provinces. The Abbasid caliph al-Hadi (r. 785‚Äì786), for example, used the barid service to make the journey from Jurjan to the capital Baghdad after he had received news of his father's death. Use of barid resources was tightly controlled, however, and special authorization was required for other government agents to use their mounts or provisions. = Surveillance = In addition to its role in as a courier service, the barid operated as an intelligence network within the Islamic state. The postmasters (ashab al- barid) of each district effectively doubled as informants for the central government, and regularly submitted reports to the capital of the state of their respective localities. Any events of significance, such as local trial proceedings, fluctuations in prices of essential commodities, or even unusual weather activity, would be written about and sent to the director of the central diwan, who would summarize the information and present it to the caliph. Besides the affairs of the provinces in general, barid agents also monitored the conduct of other government officials. Postmasters were to look out for any instances of misconduct or incompetence and inform the caliph of any such behavior. They also reported on the acts and decrees of the local governor and judge, as well as the balance of the treasury. This information enabled the caliph to stay apprised of the performance of his agents, and to dismiss any who had become corrupt or rebellious.

The installation was north of Kansas City, Kansas. Used as a pre-war Naval Air Station, the United States Army Air Forces leased the municipal airfield and built an Air Force Plant and modification center for North American B-25 Mitchell medium bomber production. Military use of the site continued as late as 1957 by the Strategic Air Command's 3903rd Radar Bomb Scoring Group for bombing practice. Background The airfield was first used in 1921 for an air meet and became the 1925 Sweeney Airport and the 1928 Fairfax Airport. A naval reserve air base was established at Fairfax Field in 1935; a Navy squadron and a Marine squadron were established on July 12. (see also \\"U.S. Army and Air Force Wings Over Kansas,\\" Kansas Historical Quarterly, v. 25, no. 2, (Summer, 1959), pp. 138-141) In 1937 Fairfax acted as an \\"army reserve base\\" with Douglas O-46 observation planes, and by 1938 the airport had four runways, including one long. (cited by Freeman) Fairfax's \\"U.S. Naval Reserve aviation base\\", had a 30-day pre-flight training course in 1940. Navy Elimination Air Base The \\"Marine Air Flight Program\\" established by 1 September 1940 at Fairfax's \\"Navy Elimination Air Base\\" (E-base) used \\"a physical and mental examination‚Ä¶ten hours of dual instruction‚Ä¶check rides and a fifteen-minute solo flight\\" for screening candidates to become Naval Aviation Cadets. A Fairfax \\"naval flying cadet‚Ä¶ crashed into the Missouri river two miles northwest of the Fairfax air base\\" [sic] on 16 June 1942, Fairfax's naval aviation training moved in July to the new United States Naval Aviation Reserve Base at Olathe about 20 miles away. Fairfax still had \\"Barracks U.S. Navy\\" in 1946. 1944 B-25 Mitchell assembly line in Air Force Plant NC: In 1953, the facility was the Buick- Oldsmobile-Pontiac Assembly Plant adjacent to Fairfax Field and unveiled the assembly line for F-84F Thunderflash fighters (General Motors produced 599 F-84Fs at Fairfax.) WWII B-25 production, training, and modifications Survey work for Air Force Plant NC had begun in December 1940, and the city of Kansas City, Kansas, purchased the airport in February 1941. (cited by Freeman and Macais) The USAAF leased the Fairfax Airport from the city and the Works Projects Administration sponsored expansion of the four civilian runways. The government purchased a alfalfa field Macias p. 247 for the plant and for right-of-way to the airfield. B-25 production began in December 1941, and Fairfax's first B-25D was accepted in February 1942. The Fairfax Modification Center was a dual hangar built May‚ÄìOctober 1942 along the south taxiway for altering the new B-25s (a west extension and several outbuildings were added.) The 76th AAF Technical Training Detachment activated on 4 February 1943 (designated 5 October) and administered a 6 week hydraulics course for AAF mechanics under the direction of the Aircraft Accessories Corporation. About 300 students were admitted before the school was closed in October as a duplicate of a Chanute Field course. The 81st AAF Technical Training Detachment activated 22 February 1943 and designated, effective 30 August, to supervise apprentice crew chiefs at the Modification Center. January AAF policy was for each mechanic selected as a crew chief to be assigned an aircraft as it left the factory, review its modifications at the center, and deploy with it to the field unit. B-25 modifications only took a week until the B-25G gunship modifications for Pacific War anti-shipping missions, which took 2‚Äì3 months. Peak enrollment was 296 mechanics on 27 June, and the apprenticeship program was abandoned (the detachment inactivated on 31 October 1943.) WWII ferrying Air Transport Command moved the 2d Ferrying Squadron of the 5th Ferrying Group from Dallas Love Field to Fairfax on April 15, 1943, and the squadron ferried out 157 B-25s during May Of 1,881 deliveries in 1943 by the Ground Ferrying Squadron all but 129 were B-25s, but at the end of that year Fairfax pilots began ferrying Martin B-26 Marauders from the Omaha modification center and Consolidated B-24 Liberators from a St. Paul facility. From May-Sep 1944 a detachment of Women Airforce Service Pilots was at Fairfax. The 33d Ferrying Group was designated on 1 April 1944 from the 2d Ferrying Squadron, which had been separated from the 5th Group on 1 January 1944 (393 officers and 578 enlisted men at the end of 1944). Womens Air Service Pilots were organized at Fairfax on 1 May 1944, and from Fairfax the 33d delivered 6,202 aircraft to CONUS bases and 251 abroad. On 22 September 1944 the 33d Ferrying Group began daily scheduled Military Air Transport (MAT) flights with military cargo/passengers to Minneapolis and Omaha (2 more daily flights were later added.) In October 1944, the modification center became an adjunct to the final assembly line. On 9 November 1944 the 33d Group furnished plane and crew to fly Senator Harry S. Truman from Fairfax to Washington for ceremonies following his election as Vice-President, and in early 1945 the 33d controlled ten operating locations.. During the Fairfax transition to P-80 production, the 33d Ferrying Group was discontinued. WWII air freight On 2 March 1945, Military Air Transport moved an air freight terminal to Fairfax from Kansas City, Missouri, and had 362 personnel in June, the largest operating location in the division. For ferrying, Fairfax became an operating location of Rosecrans Army Airfield on 15 April 1945 with its pilots traveling to Fairfax for sorties. In 1945, 1,044 military transports used the field in July (e.g., President Truman for visits to Independence, Missouri). Plans for B-29 and F-80 aircraft production at Fairfax were never implemented, and B-25J production was terminated on August 15, 1945, after a total of 2,290 B-25Ds (152 Navy PBJ-1D variants) and 4,318 B-25Js had been built by the plant. The federal Reconstruction Finance Corporation set up a depot in the Fairfax district to liquidate war surplus not sent to depots or elsewhere for government use (reusable materials like aluminum and steel were reclaimed.) Seventy-two incomplete but flyable B-25Js were sold to the public. A USAAF C-47 crashed on September 15, 1945 on take off into the north bank of the Missouri River's curve, killing all 24 aboard. The Air Transport Command operating location at Fairfax was discontinued by 6 December 1945 (9 C-47s and 80 pilots/co-pilots transferred west to Topeka Army Airfield which had been chosen for a central MAT flight facility by November 1945.) The 4101st Army Air Force Base Unit (Reserve Training) was activated at Fairfax on 12 July 1946 (redesignated 2472d AF Reserve Training Center on 28 August 1948) and at the beginning of USAF planning, Fairfax activated the Reserve's 564th Bombardment Squadron on 6 January 1947 which sent 127 pilots to 1948 summer camp. ;Kansas City Bomb Plot Fairfax in 1945 had an early 2AF Radar Bomb Scoring (RBS) sitecompare with New Orleans Radar Bomb Scoring Site and Dallas Bomb Plots which used an SCR-584 radar for evaluating bomber training The Kansas City RBS unit became a detachment of Colorado Springs's 206 AAFBU in July 1945, and in 1954 was Det 5 of the 10th RBSS. The detachment scored Convair B-36 Peacemaker runs during 1953, the 1955 SAC Bombing and Navigation Competition, and the 1957 \\"Operation Longshot\\". (page 1 section of article) The Kansas City aiming point for the 1957 operation was \\"the base of the northeast corner of the Columbian Steel Tank Company\\" at the corner of 12th/Liberty streets. in the West Bottoms. In 1959, SAC's simulated bomb runs on Kansas City were scored using a longer range radar at Missouri's Joplin Radar Bomb Scoring Site (10RBSS Det 2) to the south which had moved from Oklahoma's Hollis Radar Bomb Scoring Site in July. In October 1948, 37 Air Force Reserve planes at Fairfax flew 1,844 hours and in 1949, the 564th was replaced by the 442d Troop Carrier Wing (activated 27 June). Despite a 1948 plan for Fairfax to \\"be withdrawn from surplus\\", in \\"October 1949 the U.S. Air Force terminated its lease on Fairfax Airport, and the city of Kansas City, Kansas, regained control of the facility\\". On May 22, 1950, Fairfax's 2472d AF Reserve Training Center and 442d Troop Carrier Wing moved to Naval Air Technical Training Center Olathe. Fairfax Municipal Airport Fairfax's 4610th Air Base Squadron temporarily evacuated Fairfax Municipal Airport due to a fire during the Great Flood of 1951 and on 1 October 1952, the squadron \\"opened\\" the nearby Grandview Air Force Base in Missouri (Grandview's beneficial occupancy began 2 years later.) In 1952 the squadron was renamed the 4676th Air Defense Group which began flying F-86 Sabres from Fairfax at the end of 1953. In 1953, an F-94 crashed on attempting a return, killing the pilot and radar operator. From 18 December 1953 ‚Äì 1 March 1954, the 326th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron was assigned to Fairfax, and an F-84 crashed near the city's business district killing the pilot and three residents. On September 1, 1954, Air Defense Command (ADC) was placed under Continental Air Defense Command and all Fairfax ADC units moved nearby to the new Grandview Air Force Base near Kansas City, Missouri.

Portrait by Vincenzo Camuccini Hans Christian Andersen (1846) August Grahl (26 May 1791, G√∂hren-Lebbin - 13 June 1868, Dresden) was a German portrait painter and miniaturist.  Life  He was the son of the Court Jeweler to the Hohenzollerns. From 1811 to 1813, he studied at the Berlin University of the Arts. He quit school to join the Black Hussars of Ludwig Adolf Wilhelm von L√ºtzow and fight in the War of Liberation. He retired with a commission.Biography @ Grahl Family Website, translated from \\"A German Lexicon of Artists\\". His first success came in 1816, with a portrait of King Friedrich Wilhelm III. In 1817/18, he took a trip to Italy, visiting Rome, Florence, Venice and Bologna. Following his wife's death in 1821, after only two years of marriage, he began travelling more extensively, ending in Rome where he lived until 1830 at the Palazzo Caffarelli. It was there that he met his second wife, the daughter of a wealthy banker from K√∂nigsberg. He spent 1831 in England, where he painted a portrait of Queen Adelaide that was later made into an engraving by Samuel William Reynolds. In 1832, he returned to Germany to get married and moved to Dresden in 1835, remaining there except for a brief period from 1853 to 1855, when he returned to Rome to attend to his son- in-law, the painter Alfred Rethel, who was suffering from a severe episode of depression. He is probably best known for his portrait of Hans Christian Andersen, which is on display at the Andersen Museum in Odense. Another familiar work is his portrait of Gabriele von B√ºlow, Wilhelm von Humboldt's daughter. He was also a significant art collector, possessing a large selection of Italian paintings and lithographs. Virtually all of his miniatures are still privately owned. His granddaughter was artist, Else Sohn- Rethel. References  Further reading  * \\"August Grahl\\" In: Thieme- Becker, Allgemeines Lexikon der Bildenden K√ºnstler von der Antike bis zur Gegenwart.

Its leader and other members of the group were smugglers from the city and its surrounding before the Syrian Civil War. The group retained exclusive control of the Bab al-Salam border crossing. History Fighters of the Northern Storm Brigade during the Turkish military operation in Afrin, February 2018 Founded in 2011, the Northern Storm Brigade took part in the rebel conquest of Azaz and the Siege of Menagh Air Base. It accepted the Supreme Military Council's authority in late 2012. The group's former leader Ammar Ibrahim Dadikhi was severely wounded in the middle of January 2013, during the siege of Menagh Air Base, which resulted in him losing one of his legs and eventually his life. He was succeeded by the group's former political leader, Samir Amouri. Two senior commanders (Hadi Salo and Samir Akkash) were also killed in this period, while other members of the group defected to Islamic rebel formations. US Senator John McCain met with fighters from the group on May 27, 2013.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact- checker/wp/2014/09/18/four-pinocchios-for-rand-pauls-claim-that-mccain-met- with-the-islamic-state/ Tensions rose between the group and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in mid-September 2013, after a dispute over a German doctor working in Azaz, ISIL claimed the doctor was a spy and was photographing ISIL's headquarters in Azaz, ISIL also claimed the Northern Storm Brigade was assisting the German doctor in his espionage activities and helped him escape from ISIL killing two ISIL members in the process. The hospital in Azaz released a statement denying the doctor was a spy, and that he was actually photographing sick patients being treated in the hospital. The hospital's statement also claimed that ISIL gunmen went into the hospital demanding the hospital's staff hand him over. Following this incident ISIL fought the Northern Storm Brigade and other groups in the area eventually taking over the city of Azaz. Following the clashes the Tawhid Brigade mediated a cease-fire between ISIL and the Northern Storm Brigade, where ISIL agreed to withdraw from the Northern Storm Brigade's headquarters and both sides were to release prisoners. The Northern Storm Brigade claimed ISIL had not held up its end of the agreement, along with another local group known as Ahrar Azaz. The next day ISIL claimed that the Northern Storm Brigade helped Pro-Assad forces escape from the Menagh airbase and that the group was collaborating with Blackwater and the CIA, ISIL also referenced the group's meeting with John McCain as evidence. Later ISIL issued a statement demanding that the Northern Storm Brigade turn in their arms and join ISIL, as repentance in the Azaz region, otherwise ISIL liquidate the group.http://www.aymennjawad.org/13884/analyzing-events-in-azaz By 02 October 2013 ISIL declared the deadline was over and began attacking the Northern Storm Brigade, ISIL claimed that after the fighting Northern Storm Brigade members fled to Kurdish held areas. After the fighting the Aleppo Sharia Committee, which the Tawhid Brigades is affiliated with that attempted to mediate a cease-fire between ISIL and the Northern Storm Brigade, declared the Northern Storm Brigade was a criminal group and was not allowed to carry arms. Samir Amouri reportedly fled to Turkey and was replaced by the current leader, Mahmoud Naddom. Under his rule, the group began to develop relationships and begin coordinating with other rebels. During this period they were based in the Turkish city of Kilis. On 2 March 2014 the Northern Storm Brigade announced that they would join the Islamic Front under the leadership of the al-Tawhid Brigade. Military capabilities As of early 2015 Northern Storm had around 500 fighters, including several Kurds. The group's headquarters were located at a military base to the north of Azaz. It lacked heavy weaponry and vehicles, which had led to criticism of the group's abilities as a fighting force.  Criminal activities  The Northern Storm Brigade has been accused of kidnapping and smuggling, and was responsible for the kidnapping of eleven Lebanese men in 2012. Nine of them were released on 19 October 2013.

His exact date of death is not known. Not much is known about Besser's life except through his works. He was probably born in Aachen, Cologne and left in 1537 because of religious persecution, and found refuge in the Electoral Palatinate. He became a citizen of the city of Speyer. In 1546 he was appointed official court painter for Frederick II, Elector Palatine. After the death of Frederick in 1556, Besser continued as court painter to Otto Henry, Elector Palatine. Besser was primarily a portrait painter. Before these portraits were detectable through documentation, attributions of his works were originally assigned to either Master of Pfalz or Master of Margrave. These names were given to the painter because of the frequent representation of the Palatinate princes. Besser demonstrated none of the leading visual style of the Renaissance in Germany. His cool portraits with their motionless poses and rigid facial expressions show a distant contemplation, which seems to follow a sober objectivity of Dutch painting of the period of the Reformation.

After studying law in Ohio, Voss came to Chicago, Illinois to edit a newspaper. He later established a law practice there. In 1862, he was named colonel of the 12th Illinois Cavalry, leading the brigade until 1864. After the war, Voss re-opened his practice and served one term in the Illinois House of Representatives. Early life and education Voss was born in Rahden, Prussia on April 16, 1821. Voss married in Germany but he and his wife had no children. Early in his adulthood, he immigrated to the United States. He settled in Lancaster, Ohio, where he was admitted to the bar. Career Voss moved to Chicago, Illinois in 1848 to take a position as the editor of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung, a German-language newspaper. The next year, Hermann Kriege assumed the editorship and Voss opened a law practice. He became involved with the Chicago German Off Battalion, a citizen soldier group that was attached to the 60th Regiment, Illinois State Militia. Voss was elected Chicago City Attorney in 1852 and was re-elected the next year. In 1854, Voss was named an adjutant of the newly formed Washington Independent Regiment. Voss was still serving in this role upon the outbreak of the Civil War. On September 4, 1861, Voss was named major of the 6th Regiment Illinois Volunteer Cavalry. On February 1, 1862, he assisted in the creation of the 12th Illinois Cavalry, closing his law firm so that he could focus on the regiment. It was then deployed to Virginia as part of the Peninsula Campaign. The regiment was attached to VIII Corps and was present for the disastrous Battle of Harpers Ferry. Voss took two thousand cavalry to the enemy lines, creating an opening to let the regiment retreat. They regrouped in Greencastle, Pennsylvania and were attached to Army of the Potomac in time for the Battle of Antietam. The regiment also witnessed the Battle of Gettysburg and Stoneman's 1863 Raid. In early 1864, Colonel Voss was forced to resign due to poor health. Later life and death Voss recuperated over the next couple of years on his farm in Will County, Illinois. In 1869, he returned to Chicago to re-establish his law practice. In 1876, he was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives as a Democrat, where he served one two-year term. On December 1, 1880, he was named a master of chancery of the Circuit Court of Cook County. Voss died at his home following a stroke he suffered in his office earlier in the day on March 23, 1888. He was buried in Waldheim Cemetery. President Grover Cleveland signed a bill appropriating a grant to Voss' widow over the loss of a trunk during the war.

Although operated by North American Aviation, the plant was built and owned by the United States government.Irving Brinton Holley Jr., United States Army in World War II, Special Studies: Buying Aircraft: Materiel Procurement for the Army Air Forces (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1989), 294‚Äì301 (cited by Macias p. 246) Background North American Aviation's president had inspected the field by December 1940 when the US government approved construction of a Kansas City production plant to produce B-25 Mitchell bombers for the USAAF and PBJ-1D bombers for the US Navy. Survey work began in December, the city of Kansas City, Kansas, purchased the airport in February, (cited by Freeman and Macais) and the plant's groundbreaking was on 8 March 1941. Contract W535 AC 19341 for the initial production of 1,200 B-25D (NA-87) bombers was approved on June 28, 1941;http://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_bombers/b25_7.html production began in December 1941. B-25 production Fairfax's first B-25D was accepted by the USAAF in February 1942 (the first production block was B-25D-1). North American provided parts for the first 100 Fairfax B-25Ds from AFP #09 in Inglewood, California, and the company had a test flight office at Fairfax. A USAAF Modification Center was built at Fairfax Field from May‚ÄìOctober 1942 for altering the plant's B-25s. The plant's \\"high bay\\" expansion was completed for a 1942 North American contract (never implemented) to build 200 Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers at Fairfax alongside B-25 Mitchell. The expansion began in July 1942 on the east side of the bomber plant and added of floor space with twice the height of the existing final assembly bay (completed in March 1943). After several outbuildings were added to the modification center, in October 1944 it became an adjunct to the final assembly line. Employment peaked at 24,329 in October 1943, and the first Fairfax B-25J was accepted in December 1943 (555 B-25Js were in the first production block: B-25J-1-NC.) D model production ended in March 1944 with block 35 (B-25D-35-NA) and after North American's California plant ended B-25 production on July 7, 1944; Fairfax was the sole source for B-25 Mitchells and set a January 1945 record with AAF acceptance of 315 Fairfax aircraft. Planning for Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star jet fighter production included a visit in February 1945 by two Lockheed representatives, and in April Lockheed shipped a P-80 to the bomber plant for study. Work began on building jigs for P-80 production, space was cleared for P-80 production in the high bay, and the B-25 assembly line was shortened. B-25J production - which was scheduled to continue through December 1945 - was terminated on August 15, the day after V-J day. Fairfax had built 2,290 B-25Ds (152 Navy PBJ-1D variants) and 4,318 B-25Js of the ~11,000 produced. The federal Reconstruction Finance Corporation set up a depot in the Fairfax district to liquidate war surplus not sent to depots or elsewhere for government use (reusable materials like aluminum and steel were reclaimed.) Seventy-two incomplete but flyable B-25Js were sold to the public.

The roller coaster is a Gerstlauer Euro-Fighter model coaster which was opened to the public on 14 May 2009. At 97 degrees, Falcon has a steeper-than-vertical drop, and the steepest drop of any roller coaster in the Netherlands. History Soon after it opened in 1935, Duinrell had the Netherlands' first artificial ski slope. This ski slope was ultimately removed for the installation of Falcon in 2009. The municipality of Wassenaar had often had disputes with Duinrell in regards to noise levels created by the amusement park. This was true again with the proposed construction of a new coaster. The new coaster was given the code name \\"Rick's Delight\\"‚Äîwhich was a reference to Duinrell's mascot, Rick the Frog. The park was awarded when a permit from the municipality of Wassenaar over the objections of some residents and after a lengthy court battle. Noise and traffic studies were conducted and showed that the new coaster would not adversely influence these environmental factors in the area surrounding the park (results were just under the 45 decibel benchmark). A Duinrell spokesperson also stated that measures were being taken to further mitigate the noise from the park. On 14 May 2009, Mayor Hoekema van Wassenaar and the director of Duinrell, Philip van Zuylen van Nijvelt opened the ride to the public. Objections from the community, however, had delayed the coaster opening 2 years later than had originally been planned. Layout Falcon has a track length of , a height of , and achieves a maximum speed of . The coaster has three inversions: a vertical loop, a cutback and a heartline roll. The coaster layout for Falcon is particularly close to two other Euro-Fighter (model 320+) roller coasters: Rage at Adventure Island amusement park and Untamed at Canobie Lake Park.

History  = Eligibility and criteria = The Ollin Yoliztli Prize was open to all Spanish language writers of literature. The recognition was for collective works rather than any single work and was structured to be presented in any of the four literary genres: poetry, novels, essays, and drama. Oll√≠n yoliztli, means \\"life movement\\" or \\"life force\\" in N√°huatl. The prize each year was presented by the President of Mexico, Jos√© L√≥pez Portillo. His sister, Margarita L√≥pez Portillo (es) (2014‚Äì2006), was a prolific novelist and his wife, Carmen Romano, was an exponent of fine arts and humanities. = Founding sponsor = The President's wife established the prize to promote Spanish literature and its important authors ‚Äî and to strengthen cultural links among Spanish speaking countries. She was instrumental in launching several large-scale cultural programs, which led to the founding of The National Fund for Social Activities (Spanish: Fondo Nacional para Actividades Sociales), commonly known by its acronym, FONAPAS. She prevailed in initiatives to make fine arts more accessible, particularly for low-income and young people. Her initiatives included erecting new fine arts venues and establishing professional orchestras. One such venue in Mexico City, which opened in 1979, bears the named Centro Cultural Ollin Yoliztli and is home to several cultural organizations, including the Mexico City Philharmonic Orchestra, founded in 1978. While many cultural initiatives of Portillo and his wife endure today, the economic, diplomatic, and cultural wisdom of their efforts was not without criticism. In particular, critics viewed their cultural initiatives as wasteful and part of a larger scheme of building personal projects with public money. Control of a wide range of projects was assigned to family members and close associates. Portillo's presidency ended in November 1982. But criticism was amplified toward the end of his term, starting in February 1982, after a sharp devaluation of the peso and ensuing economic crisis. The succession- continuity of the Ollin Yolilztli Prize ended when Portillo's presidential term ended. = Juries and award ceremonies = The juries for the Ollin Yoliztli Prize were formed under the auspices of the Festival Internacional Cervantino in Guanajuato, Mexico. When establishment of the prize was announced on November 10, 1979, by Hector Vasconcelos (es), Director of the Cervantes Festival, the jury had been selected. Their appointments were for life. The jury was composed of six major critics and writers. # Jos√© Luis Mart√≠nez Rodr√≠guez, from Mexico, was a journalist from Mexico City and director of Fondo de Cultura Econ√≥mica # Ram√≥n Xirau, from Mexico, is a poet and a member of National College of Mexico # Juan Marichal, from Spain, was a professor of Spanish literature at Harvard # D√°maso Alonso, from Spain, was president of the Royal Spanish Academy in Madrid # Emir Rodr√≠guez Monegal, from Uruguay, was a professor of Spanish literature at Yale # Enrique Anderson Imbert, from Argentina, was Professor Emeritus of Spanish literature at Harvard The festival dates back years, to 1953, but was formalized years ago, in 1972. The festival is one of the most important artistic and cultural events in Mexico and Latin America. Its host city, Guanajuato, is west of Mexico City. * In 1981, the jury, according to Vasconcelos (es), reached its decision unanimously in favor of the Argentine poet during the first meeting of the jurists, Monday morning, May 11, 1981. * The award ceremony took place in early June. The President of Mexico, Jos√© L√≥pez Portillo, presented the award at his official residence, Los Pinos. Attendees included the Emilio Casinello Auban, Ambassador of Spain in Mexico from 1982 to 1985. The award to Jorge Guillen and the presence of the Ambassador had diplomatic overtones because five years earlier, in 1977, Mexico had reestablished diplomatic relations with Spain following the end of Francoist Spain in 1975. The lower prize amount was mostly the result of a sharp devaluation of the peso in February 1982 and subsequent economic crisis.

Initially she was to be named Sentinel, but this was changed following the loss of the Scorpion in the Bangka Strait in February 1942.Cocker, pp. 101 She served in the Royal Navy during the Second World War, mostly in the Arctic Ocean, and fought in the Battle of North Cape. She was sold to the Netherlands in 1945 and scrapped in 1963. War time service =Home Fleet and convoy escort= Scorpion joined the 23rd Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow on 11 May 1943 and was deployed on patrol in the Northwestern Approaches. On 20 October she joined an escort group of nine destroyers, a Norwegian corvette and two minesweepers which sailed to the Kola Inlet as part of Operation FR, tasked to bring back merchant ships that had been waiting in Russian ports over the summer while the Arctic Convoys were suspended.Woodman, pp. 342. Covered by dense fog, convoy RA54A arrived safely in Loch Ewe on 14 November, while the destroyer flotilla turned around to escort Convoy JW 54B to Archangel.Woodman, pp. 343. She returned to Scapa Flow, but was out again on 10 December to screen the battleship and cruiser which had been ordered to sea to cover Convoy JW 55A. The Kriegsmarine did not emerge and so she sailed with the battleship all the way through to the Kola Inlet, an unusual and risky move that surprised the Russians.Woodman, pp. 353. =Battle of the North Cape= Scorpion covered Duke of York as she returned west to refuel in Akureyri in Iceland on 21 December 1943. The Home Fleet left Iceland on 23 December to cover Convoy RA 55A and Convoy JW 55A, alerted of German intentions to intercept one of the convoys by Ultra intelligence.Woodman, pp. 355. On 26 December the , escorted by five destroyers, attempted to attack the ships of Convoy JW 55A, but were driven away by Admiral Burnett's three light cruisers and then cut off by Admiral Fraser's force. During the action Duke of York hit Scharnhorsts starboard boiler room with a 14 inch shell, slowing her briefly to as she attempted to evade the British fleet.Woodman, pp. 370. This provided the destroyers with an opportunity to attack with torpedoes. Closing from astern, and fired star-shells, blinding the Germans to the approach of Scorpion and the Norwegian on the starboard side of the battleship.Woodman, pp. 371. The two destroyers launched 16 torpedoes, scoring one hit, and driving Scharnhorst into firing range of Saumarez and Savage, which scored two more hits. This crippled the German ship and allowed the slower Duke of York to catch up and sink her. After the battle Scorpion picked up 30 survivors and sailed on to the Kola Inlet, arriving there on 27 December. She returned to Scapa Flow with the rest of the fleet on New Year's Eve.Woodman, pp. 374. =Operation Neptune= In March 1944 Scorpion was assigned to the \\"Ocean Escort\\" force for Convoy JW 58, one of the largest Arctic convoys of the war. All ships arrived safely and Scorpion returned with Convoy RA 58. Scorpion was then assigned to Force S, alongside several other S-class destroyers, part of the fleet for the Normandy landings. During May she took part in preparatory exercises before sailing to Spithead early in June. She crossed the channel on 5 June and took up position off Ouistreham to bombard targets in support of Allied landing forces in the Queen Sector of Sword Beach.Ford, pp. 51. On 7 June she was assigned to patrol the Eastern Task Force area following the loss of her sister ship, the Norwegian to German T-boats. On 9 June she was detached with Scourge to reinforce the O-class destroyer flotilla against the threat posed by the German heavy destroyers from Brest. She spent the rest of June, July and August on patrol in the English Channel protecting convoys from E-boats. =Arctic Convoys= Scorpion returned to escorting the Arctic convoys in September 1944, screening the battleship in support of Convoy JW 60 and then Convoy RA 60.Woodman, pp. 405. In October she was diverted to support Operation Lycidas, screening two escort carriers, and , as they carried out aerial minelaying around the Norwegian coast. In November, sailing with Savage, she carried Norwegian troops to the Kola Inlet (Operation Freeman), their role being to join Red Army as it pushed the Germans away from Murmansk back into Norway, lending authority to the Norwegian Government in exile.Woodman, pp. 413. She then joined the escort for Convoy RA 60A on 11 November. Later in the month she supported two more operations with escort carriers off the Norwegian coast near Karm√∏y on 20 November (Operation Handfast) and then near Mosj√∏en on 27 November. She escorted Convoy JW 63 over the New Year period, her anti-aircraft gunners accidentally shooting at (and missing) two Wildcats which had been launched to intercept a German aircraft.Woodman, pp. 418. She escorted four more Arctic convoys early in 1945, RA 63 in January, RA 64 in February, and JW 65 and RA 65 in March. She was also deployed to support three more operations in the North Sea in February, Operations Selenium, Shred and Groundsheet. She continued in service with the Home Fleet until VJ Day in August 1945 when she was placed in reserve. Post war In October 1945 Scorpion was sold to the Dutch Navy and renamed Kortenaer, serving as a destroyer until 1957 when she was converted to a fast frigate. She was broken up in 1963.

Stanton visited the grave of Lafayette and uttered the famous phrase \\"Lafayette, we are here.\\" After the war, a U.S. flag was permanently placed at the grave site. Every year, on Independence Day, the flag is replaced in a joint French-American ceremony. The flag remained even during the German occupation of Paris during World War II. *In 1943, on visiting Corsica, General George S. Patton commented on how the Free French forces had liberated the birthplace of Napoleon, and promised that the Americans would liberate the birthplace of Lafayette. *In 1958, the Order of Lafayette was established by U.S. Representative Hamilton Fish III, a World War I veteran, to promote Franco-American friendship and to honor Americans who fought in France.

The film follows the story of John West who is admitted to a psychiatric ward suffering from trauma-induced amnesia after he was found half naked running down a motorway and covered in blood. He has no memory of who he is. All he can recall is a detailed knowledge of sophisticated weaponry and military techniques that indicates a background in terrorism. When two armed soldiers guarding his room are murdered and Dr Liz Santer Samira Mohamed Ali, the psychiatrist assigned to his case, is abducted at gunpoint, a desperate hunt begins for a dangerous killer. Liz attempts to help her capture recover his memory despite all the warnings of what she might find. Is Liz in the hands of a homicidal terrorist or an innocent pawn? Her life depends on the right answer. Cast * Cengiz Dervis as John West: A man who is found covered in blood with no memory of who he is, but appears to have knowledge that only a special forces soldier or a terrorist would have. He is immediately taken into custody in order to find out the truth of his identity. * Samira Mohamed Ali as Dr Liz Santer: A Psychiatrist who is mourning the loss of her husband but is soon caught up in solving the mystery of her latest patient. * Dan Richardson - Captain Challoner * Victor Ptak - Colonel Hedingham * Huw Richards - Sergeant Price * Phillip Embrey - Major Simmonds * Chris Hurley - Inspector Barnes * Ernest Vernon - Dr Dave Watson * Louise Fellows - Bonnie McKenna * Claire Richards - Duty Houseman Production In 2014, it was announced that Author Catrin Collier (Katherine John) was working with Tanabi, a Welsh production company, to adapt the novel for the big screen in a deal negotiated with Marjacq Scripts Ltd. Filming commenced on the project in August 2014 and will run through to October and will be released in early 2017. It is said to be the first in a series of films that Catrin Collier and Tanabi Films will work on over the next few years. The film is being filmed on location in London, Swansea and Brecon where the films main narrative takes place. Recent film school graduate Shannon Walsh was initially lined up to direct before being replaced by producer Euros Jones-Evans. Novel The novel, By Any Name, written by Katherine John, was released in early 2006 and was well received by critics and as well as fans of John herself. Much like the film, the book follows the story of Dr Elizabeth Santer who is desperately trying to help the man known as John West rediscover his memory despite warnings that West might be dangerous and is suspected of Terrorist activities.

There are currently four books planned within the series, which is based on The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's cocker spaniel, Lupo. Biography Aby King was born in London, to Lynda and Tom King. She was raised in Wimbledon Village with her half sister Louise and brother Oliver. She came up with the idea for the Lupo series whilst walking her dog Lilly around Kensington Palace. She is married to Malte Richter and they share their home with two cocker spaniel dogs called Lilly and Maggy. Aby has had what you might describe as a ‚Äòportfolio‚Äô career. She has been an actress, a model, a TV presenter, a PA and a businesswoman ‚Äì but always wanted to be a writer. At school she was inspired by Enid Blyton's The Magic Faraway Tree and scribbled fantasy and adventure stories. In 1991, when Abigail was 14, her mother died of leukemia. The following year, her half-sister, the model and actress Louise Ashby, was seriously injured in a car crash in Los Angeles. The story of her long and painful recovery is told in her 2001 book The Magic of the Mask. In 2008 Aby's then fianc√© Mark Sebire (property developer) committed suicide. Like Louise and her mother, Abigail has a background in the expressive arts. Aged 18, she wrote, produced and directed A Simple Girl for the BBC Short Film Festival. She then went on to find work as a model and actress. A keen amateur chef, she appeared as a contestant on Hell's Kitchen in 2005. She has featured in a number of television commercials, most notably Vodafone with David Beckham, Waitrose with Heston Blumenthal, The Bill and NSPCC (charity).

The Yarmouth Runic Stone, also known as the Fletcher Stone, is a slab of quartzite that first came to the attention of the public in the early 19th century.Brown Balfor. Runic Stone 1898 The stone appears to have an inscription carved into it, which some investigators, notably Henry Phillips, Jr., have interpreted as Norse runes. This has led to speculation that the Yarmouth, Nova Scotia area, in Canada, was visited by Viking explorers sometime around 1000 C.E. Many other theories have been put forward, including the possibility of a hoax or the inscription being a product of natural forces. The stone is currently on display at the Yarmouth County Museum. Description The Yarmouth Runic Stone is made of quartzite, measures 31\\" x 20\\" x 13\\" (79 cm x 51 cm x 33 cm), and weighs about 400 lbs. (180 kg).Harry Piers, \\"Remarks on the Fletcher and Related Stones of Yarmouth, N.S.\\", Collections of the Nova Scotia Historical Society, Vol. XVII, Halifax, NS, 1913, p 53 It has a purported runic inscription carved near the top of one naturally smooth face; the stone does not appear to have been dressed in any way. The inscribed characters are between 1\\" and 1 1/2\\" (25mm - 40mm) high. There are small amounts of modern green paint on its lower surface from an earlier display stand, and someone has written the date \\"1007\\" in modern ink marker to the left of the inscription. History of the stone The Salt Pond at the northwest end of Yarmouth harbour. The stone was discovered in the now- wooded land on the left foreground.Dr. Richard Fletcher, a retired surgeon of the British Army, settled in Yarmouth in 1809, on a lot of land at the northwest tip of the harbour. This was near the Salt Pond, part of which had been dyked off in 1799 to create a salt marsh.Rev. J.R. Campbell, A History of the County of Yarmouth Nova Scotia, orig. pub. Saint John, NB, 1876, reprinted Mika Studio, Belleville, ON, 1972, p 5 In 1812 he revealed his discovery of the stone, found on a point of land near the water. Fletcher died in 1819, but the stone remained on display on his property for some sixty years until it was moved into the town itself. Shortly thereafter the provincial Inspector of Mines, Dr. Henry S. Poole, attempted to have it moved to the Provincial Museum in Halifax, but it was not shipped due to a clerical error. It next came into the possession of Samuel N. Ryerson of Yarmouth, before passing to the Yarmouth Public Library in the early 20th century, and then to the Yarmouth County Museum.Piers, p 53Moses H. Nickerson, \\"A Short Note on the Yarmouth 'Runic Stone'\\", Collections of the Nova Scotia Historical Society, Vol. XVII, Halifax, NS, 1913, p 52 Interpretations Closeup of the apparent inscription. The stone remained a curiosity for the next 70 years after its discovery. In 1865, Sir Daniel Wilson referred to it briefly in his Prehistoric Man. It became much more widely known in 1884, when Henry Phillips, Jr., corresponding secretary of the Numismatic and Antiquarian Society of Philadelphia, published a paper claiming that the inscription is runic, and went so far as to translate it as \\"Hako's son addressed the men.\\" Phillips identified Hako as one of the men of Thorfinn Karlsefni's expedition of ca. 1007 C.E., based on the Gr≈ìnlendinga saga and the Eir√≠ks saga rau√∞a. In his 1889 history of Yarmouth, George S. Brown accepted and supported Phillips' theory.George S. Brown, Yarmouth, N.S., A Sequel to Campbell's History, Boston, 1889, pp 17 - 24 Another Norse translation came in 1934 from a student of runeology, Olaf Strandwold, who claimed that the stone was inscribed by command of Lief Erikson, in honour of his father, and states that \\"Lief to Eric raises (this monument)\\". These interpretations took root in Yarmouth and in much of North America, long before it was proven that the Norse had actually reached the continent, with the discovery of the settlement at L'Anse aux Meadows in 1960. The first refutation of the stone as a Norse artifact came from Wilson. In his 1890 monograph \\"The Vinland of the Northmen\\", published in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada, he deals with the stone at considerable length, and states that the supposed inscription does not agree with runic ones. The second came from Yarmouth's own Kenneth G. T. Webster, who failed to identify Yarmouth with the description of the places visited during Karlsefni's voyage, and in 1892, after reviewing the various claims made, that it was a Native, a Phoenician, a Norse, or a French inscription, came to the somewhat unwilling conclusion that it was made by the later English, either for amusement or for fraudulent purposes, \\"for it was not made without hands.\\"Piers, pp 53 - 54 In the 1890s, local amateur historian Moses H. Nickerson began a study of the stone and of the various runic futharks. He eventually sent a print of the stone and its marks, via an intermediary, to Prof. Magnus Olsen in Kristiania (now Oslo), Norway, and received the following reply: > The marks on this \\"copy\\" are not runes; and as Mr. Nickerson, in his > enclosed note points out, they have very little likeness to runes. They > strike me as being a freak of nature, and would therefore advise that the > \\"Runic(?) Stone\\" be examined by a geologist.Nickerson, p 51 - 52 Interest in and belief in the authenticity of the stone grew however to the point where in the late 1930s plans for a national park were being considered. It is during this period that the president of the local historical society and the \\"Yarmouth Leif Erikson Memorial Society\\", the Reverend Gordon Lewis, wrote that Erikson had not only visited and left the stone but had also built a village, exploring the area for at least 12 years. It is also suggested, although not fully proven, that \\"Lewis believed in the stone so passionately that he took the bold step of ‚Äúimproving‚Äù it. The recalcitrant markings were allegedly ‚Äúclarified‚Äù under his ministrations with hammer and chisel, transforming the faint tracings described in the nineteenth century into the much more emphatic text of the twentieth. (Herein lies one possible explanation for the striking difference between pre- and post-1930s images of the artifact.)\\" In 1943 an official provincial guidebook, Historic Nova Scotia, described it as authentic. But then a Nova Scotia born professor of archaeology, A. D. Fraser, said that it showed saw marks and might have been an old quarry block, and that the carvings were much poorer than runes that had examined and that he could \\"not see anything here that is more runic than Roman or Cypriote or of any other system that one might name.\\" Strandwold, who had translated it in 1934, turned out to have no credentials and no knowledge of Old Norse. All mention of the stone was removed from \\"Historic Nova Scotia\\". Despite all this in 1947 the local museum ordered more copies of Standwold's pamphlet on the stone, and others claiming expertise continued to pronounce it genuine. New interpretations were brought forward - Hungarian, Welsh, Mayan, and in 1993 the local paper ran an editorial titled \\"The 'runic stone' - why don't we just say it was left by aliens?\\" The Yarmouth County Museum lists a number of other theories on a placard near the stone.All the following interpretations are taken from this placard. The museum prefers to remain neutral on all theories about the stone. =Japanese= In his 1896 article \\"Ancient Literature of America\\", John Campbell claimed that the inscription is in Old Japanese and reads \\"wabi deka Kuturade bushi goku\\" - \\"Katurade, the eminent warrior, has died in peace\\". Campbell maintains that identical writing is found in Siberia, Mongolia, and Japan, and spread to Nova Scotia via the Choctaw, the Maskoki, or the Chicasa peoples of North America, whose languages, he feels, are simply forms of Japanese. =Basque= Dr. Barry Fell, an invertebrate zoologist at Harvard, theorized in 1976 that the inscription could be in early Basque, reading \\"Basque people have subdued this land\\". Fell feels that stones of this nature were set up along the coast to inform other travelers that a territory had already been claimed. =Early Greek= Elbert E. Esmiol claimed in 1974 that the inscription is in one of the royal Mycenaean alphabets, and reads as follows: It has been pointed out by other researchers that such a complicated message could not possibly be communicated using so few symbols. Other stones Sketches of the Yarmouth Runic Stone (top) and the so-called Bay View Stone, which is currently missing. Other stones with apparent inscriptions have also been reported in the Yarmouth area. Sometime between 1895 and 1898 a stone was discovered at Bay View Park, a tourist resort directly across the harbour from the town of Yarmouth, in Overton, within 1 km of the original site of the Fletcher Stone. The Bay View stone has a similar flat surface of similar size and shape; its composition is unknown. Its supposed inscription is almost identical to that of the Fletcher Stone, with a few additional markings on a second line. The existence of this stone would seem to refute the idea that the markings on the Fletcher Stone are a freak of nature. The stone was referred to in Robert R. McLeod's 1903 book, Markland or Nova Scotia, pp 154 ‚Äì 55.Piers, pp 54 - 56 In 1912, while the grounds of Bay View Park were being put in order, the stone was thoughtlessly placed in a new stone wall by workmen. Shortly afterwards the proprietor, Mr. Drew, said he would be glad to have it taken out at any time for examination.Piers, p 54 However, in the century since then its location has been lost and is currently unknown. In February, 1880, a letter from T.B. Flint of Yarmouth was read before the Numismatic and Antiquarian Society of Philadelphia, in which he stated that on an island near the mouth of the Tusket River there are also two very large stones with inscriptions similar to those on the Fletcher Stone. Flint wrote that \\"the spot was very difficult of access by land, but not by water, although it is not in any frequented route.\\" These are believed to the same stones referred to by R.B. Brown in a letter published in the Proceedings of the Nova Scotian Institute of Science, vol. VIII, pp xxxvi - xxxviii, in 1892.Piers, pp 55 - 56 The exact location of these stones is currently unknown. According to notes on file at the Yarmouth County Museum, yet another inscribed stone was incorporated into a stone wall on the former Burrill property in Yarmouth, near the southeast corner of Starrs Road and Pleasant Street. In local culture The main entrance to the former Yarmouth Consolidated Memorial High School The Runic Stone, and the presumed connection it made between Yarmouth and the medieval Norse, influenced popular culture in the community from the late 19th century until the present day. * A tourist resort built in Cape Forchu in the late 1800s was named the Markland Hotel. * The sports teams of Yarmouth Consolidated Memorial High School (est. 1951) are called the Vikings. * The sports teams of Burridge Campus, Nova Scotia Community College have Marvel Comics' Thor as a mascot. * A 1970s local rock and roll cover band went by the name of The Runic Stones. * During the early 1970s the Yarmouth Town and County Tourist Association promoted Route 304, from Milton to Cape Forchu, as Lief Eriksen Drive. This secondary highway runs past the site of the discovery of the stone.John C. Kernick and Robert B. Blauveldt, Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, tourist guidebook, Yarmouth, NS, 1974, p 5 * At present, a walking trail near the Cape Forchu lighthouse is named the Lief Erikson Trail, with signage linking the site with the stone and the possible presence of the Norse. * Also at present, the Markland Viking Project is doing re-enacting of the Norse lifestyle in locations around Yarmouth.http://www.thevanguard.ca/News/2014-11-26/article-3952310/Wanted- Viking-performers-for-2015/1 * In Sept. 2011, during the celebrations of the 250th anniversary of the founding of Yarmouth Township, an international symposium on the Runic Stone was hosted by the Yarmouth County Museum. * While his theory is not connected to the stone, in 2000, Swedish archaeologist Mats Larsson of Lund University put forward a claim that Chegoggin, just outside Yarmouth and very close to the site of the stone, is his prime candidate for the location of Erikson's Vinland. Having explored up and down the coasts of Atlantic Canada, Larsson believes that Chegoggin best fits the description of Vinland as given in the sagas.Kevin Cox, \\"Uncovered: the 'real' Vinland\\", The Globe and Mail, Toronto, ON, June 10, 2000, p A9 References Category:Yarmouth, Nova Scotia ","title":"Yarmouth Runic Stone"},{"id":"43615423","text":"Jungle Queen may refer to: * Tarzan's Peril, a 1951 film often shown under its alternate title Jungle Queen * Jungle Queen (1991 film), an Indian film starring Satish Shah * Jungle Queen (2001 film), a Pakistani film * Jungle Queen (serial), a 1945 Universal movie serial * \\"Jungle Queen\\", a 1982 song by Robert Sacchi * 'Jungle Queen', a cultivar of the Malaysian plant Alpinia purpurata * Butterflies in the genus Stichophthalma See also *Queen of the Jungle ","title":"Jungle Queen"},{"id":"43615431","text":"Now ‚Äî The Peace is a film produced and directed in 1945 by Stuart Legg for the National Film Board of Canada series The World in Action, with unaccredited narration by Lorne Greene. Over its nearly 21-minute running time, circumstances during the immediate postwar period following the Second World War, leading to the formation of the United Nations are discussed.Chapnick 2005, p. 179.  Synopsis  After the First World War, the League of Nations was created, but despite the efforts of leaders such as Woodrow Wilson, the organization failed to ensure world peace. The concept of collective security against attack was thought to be the means to stop wars. The constant conflicts of the 1930s with Japanese aggression in China, Italian invasion of Ethiopia and the beginning of the Spanish Civil War showed how ineffective the League had become. During the Second World War, in an attempt to reinvigorate efforts directed to prevent future wars, the \\"five great powers\\" met in August and September 1944, at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference, Dumbarton Oaks, Washington, D.C.. The deliberations led to the creation of a new international organization devoted to world peace, the United Nations. One of the aspects of the blueprint that is proposed is for nations to share their abundance of resources for mutual benefit. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) is created as an international relief agency to help nations in need during the immediate postwar era.

Through its exhibition, education, and community development programs, WIFF builds audiences for Canadian content and talent, provides training opportunities for emerging filmmakers, and promotes the creative economy of Windsor and Southwestern Ontario. When the festival first took place, it received 1,000 people and screened 20 films over 2 days. Marking its growth, in 2009 the festival screened 25 films and sold 1500 tickets. In 2011 it was attended by 8,000 people. By the time of the 9th festival in 2013, the festival screened 65 films over a 6-day period, with an attendance by 14,000 people under the guidance of executive director Vincent Georgie, who replaced the retiring Peter Coady. In 2016, the festival sold over 20 000 tickets, and was the 2nd- largest volunteer-run film festival in Canada.  Goal  In establishing its priorities, WIFF identified a number of goals and objectives to stimulate and solidify its position as an important and recognized film festival: * To grow a successful and well-organized annual film festival and monthly screening series and to showcase local, regional and national talent including actors, writers, directors, producers and prominent industry professionals. * To build audiences for Canadian and international films and to encourage an awareness and appreciation of the diversity of talent working in the feature film and documentary sector. * To provide unique opportunities for our audience to develop a deeper understanding and appreciation of the art of film, both Canadian and international, through encounters with artists and professionals connected to the film industry. * To establish partnerships with local schools and organizations to foster a sense of entitlement and belonging in our community and to increase youth and student access to fine Canadian and international film. * To increase the networking and training opportunities for local, regional, Aboriginal and visible minority writers, directors and producers. * To encourage tourism and business development opportunities in the local community and to promote Windsor and Essex County as a thriving and vibrant cultural destination.  History  The Windsor International Film Festival was founded in 2005 to raise awareness and appreciation of the art of the moving image by bringing films to Windsor which otherwise would not be seen. Since that time, the festival has grown and expanded from a 3-day festival of 16 films, 21 screenings and 2,705 tickets sold in 2005 to 6 days, showing 65 films, 104 screenings, and approximately 14,000 tickets sold in 2013. WIFF programs (which include a year-round monthly screening series) contribute to the economic and social revitalization of Windsor by bringing audiences to see films at the Capitol Theatre and to patronize restaurants and bars in the downtown core. WIFF returned to the Palace's old address at 300 Ouellette, holding panel discussions in The Windsor Star's News Cafe. In November 2014, WIFF celebrated its 10th anniversary by adding three days and dozens more movies. It increased from six to nine days, from Saturday, Nov. 1 to Sunday, Nov. 9. Festivals and Events Ontario has consistently named WIFF one of the top 100 festivals in Ontario. In the months leading up to the Festival, a 'Maverick Filmmaker Series' has been showcasing famous directors, with two films back-to-back being screened each month at the Capitol Theater. Familiar names include Martin Scorsese, David Lean, Agnieszka Holland, Sergio Leone, and Japanese director Akira Kurosawa. On September 20, WIFF honoured Canadian film director Norman Jewison with a Lifetime Achievement Award. WIFF had also asked for input from the public to choose their favourite 10 films from the past 9 years of the Festival. Choosing from a list of 20, those 10 chosen will be screened once again at the upcoming Festival this November. Said Vincent Georgie, \\"This is not just an opinion poll. The public's vote is a collective endorsement of WIFF's rich cinematic history.\\" The titles will be announced in September.  Community involvement  WIFF programs contribute to the economic and social revitalization of Windsor by bringing audiences to see films at the Capitol Theatre and to patronize restaurants and bars in the downtown core. As a cultural, not-for-profit organization, WIFF celebrates Canadian and international films and filmmakers through its exhibition, education, and community development programs. Its unique mandate to provide training opportunities for the local film scene sets it apart from other film festivals. Programs like 48-hour FlickFest, WIFF 'Local', and the Short Film Program convey the grit, passion, and determination of making films, but they also provide invaluable experience for emerging local filmmakers. WIFF has long been strongly associated with the University of Windsor's Odette School of Business and the St. Clair College Alumni Association. Other sponsors have included The Windsor Star, Telefilm Canada, Willistead Manor, PepsiCo, The Windsor Family Credit Union, National Bank, Kelcom, The City Grill, South Detroit, Club Riverside, Windsor Laser Eye Institute, Windsor Symphony Orchestra, and many more.

It was established on September 1, 2015, becoming Canada's 45th national park. This area was chosen to represent the Western High Arctic natural region, one of 39 such regions identified by Parks Canada. This region encompasses most of the high Arctic Archipelago (the Queen Elizabeth Islands and the Grinnell Peninsula on Devon Island, but not Ellesmere Island or Axel Heiberg Island). The park also protects important Peary caribou habitat. It is north of the existing Polar Bear Pass National Wildlife Area. History Archaeological studies in the Bathurst Island area indicate occasional human use over the past 4500 years by prehistoric as well as historic Dorset and Thule Inuit. Human presence fluctuated with changes in climate, ice cover and the corresponding availability of wildlife for subsistence. Human use was primarily in the southern and eastern part of Bathurst Island, rather than within the proposed park area itself. The area was explored by British naval expeditions during the mid-nineteenth century, primarily those associated with the search for the lost Franklin expedition. Several cairns remain on the north coast. Exploration of the area continued sporadically, including scientific and commercial studies beginning during the 1960s. The community of Resolute, located on Cornwallis Island to the southeast of the park, was established in 1953. Inuit from the community use the land and waters of the Bathurst Island area to hunt and fish. A park feasibility study was initiated in 1994. The work included a Mineral and Energy Resources Assessment. This report was released in 1999 and the overall park feasibility study was concluded in 2000. The lands on northern Bathurst Island were first withdrawn for the purpose of establishing a national park in 1996. In 2009 Parks Canada entered into negotiations with the communities most closely connected to the proposed park with respect to establishing an Inuit Impact and Benefit Agreement (IIBA) for the establishment of the park. In 2015, the federal government introduced a bill to create the park, which received approval on June 24. The law specified that it would come into force on either the day of approval or on September 1, 2015‚Äîwhichever came latest. With approval given in June, the park was legally created on September 1. The proposed name of the park was \\"Tuktusiuqvialuk National Park\\". The Qausuittuq name was selected through a contest in the local area. Qausuittuq National Park was open to the public and received its first visitors in 2016. Geology and climate The park geology is composed primarily of sedimentary rocks such as limestone, sandstone and dolomite. The area was glaciated in the past as evidenced by landforms such as eskers, moraines and beach terraces. The area is generally rolling hills. Bathurst Island has a cold dry climate. The cool central Arctic climate pushes almost unimpeded into the low-lying islands of the northwest and north-central sector of the Queen Elizabeth islands; reaching to Bathurst Island. Mean temperatures range from -35 ¬∞C in January to 5 ¬∞C in July. Annual precipitation is less than 130 mm. Flora and fauna Peary caribou The severe climate limits soil and nutrient development, which in turn limits vegetation. This region has low vascular plant diversity and is dominated by herbaceous species. Plants include purple saxifrage, dwarf willow, sedges, grasses, lichens and mosses. Terrestrial wildlife species adapted to this environment include Peary caribou, muskoxen, wolves, Arctic foxes and bird species such as snowy owls, snow geese, king eiders, jaegers as well as various gulls and shorebirds. Marine species in the area include ringed seals, bearded seals, polar bears, walruses, bowhead whales, beluga whales and narwhals.

Eurofighter is the only Gerstlauer Euro-Fighter model roller coaster that bears the name of the coaster model. At 97 degrees, the coaster is also the steepest roller coaster in Italy. History First drop on Eurofighter Built by Gerstlauer, the installation of Eurofighter was delayed several years because of conflict between Zoosafari Fasanolandia and the city of Fasano. The coaster was purchased in 2007 for a total of ‚Ç¨2,187,000, but when construction was about to begin, the local police intervened and blocked construction on 5 March 2007, claiming that there were issues with the building permits. Permits were eventually granted on 28 September 2009, and construction began on 15 December 2010. The coaster finally opened on 6 August 2011. The delay in the construction led the park owners to seek compensation for the revenue that they claimed was lost as a result of the delay in coaster installation. The park owners demanded ‚Ç¨3,000,000 from the city of Fasano, and threatened to remove the entire park and move its operations to Ravenna if its demands were not met. In addition, the park terminated more favorable admission rates for residents of Fasano. Layout Eurofighter has a similar layout to Rage, another Gerstlauer Euro-Fighter roller coaster at Adventure Island in Southend-On-Sea, Essex, UK, and has the steeper-than-vertical 97-degree drop characteristic of all Gerstlauer Euro-Fighters. The coaster is reported in some sources as having 2 inversions and in other sources as having 3 inversions. All sources describe the coaster as having a vertical loop and a roll (alternatively described as the often misidentified heartline roll or an inline twist), but some sources report that an overbanked curve in the coaster qualifies as an \\"inline loop\\".

Sittig spent most of his career editing papers directed at Chicago's German audiences. He was twice elected to the Illinois House of Representatives Biography Eugene Alexander Sittig was born in Lauban, Prussia on October 1, 1847. His parents immigrated to the United States with him when he was an infant. They first settled in Kenosha, Wisconsin, then moved to Dubuque, Iowa. Sittig attended public school, then apprenticed as a blacksmith in Chicago, Illinois. He returned to Dubuque at age 19 upon the death of his father to settle family affairs. He then returned to Chicago to work in the shoe business. Finding little success, he took a new job in the advertising department of the Chicagoer Volkszeitung, a paper owned by his former blacksmith mentor F. A. Jensch. Sittig had several successful years at the company before leaving to co-publish the weekly The Business Guide. He then worked with a series of German-centric publications, including the Freie Presse, the Handels-Zeitung, German American Miller, and Deutsche Industrie. Later in his life he edited the Brewer and Maltster, a brewing trade journal. In 1876, Sittig was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives as a Republican, serving a two-year term. In 1884, he was again elected to the house for another two-year term. During this second term, Sittig gained notoriety as the vote that broke a 102‚Äì102 stalemate in the house concerning the re-election of John A. Logan as a U.S. Senator. While in Dubuque tending to his family, Sittig married. They had two children: Jenny and William A., the latter of which frequently worked under his father.

The leaves, which are arranged on spaced whorls around the stem, have a distinctive curry-like smell.Moore, P 2005 ‚ÄúA Guide to Plants of Inland Australia‚Äù Reed New Holland, Sydney Description The viscid shrub typically grows to a height of but can reach up to and has a spreading a flat topped habit. The stems are covered with fine downy hairs and have long stipules. Like most species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. The phyllodes are arranged in whorls of 8 to 14 and are more or less flattened and straight or recurved towards apex. The phyllodes are in length and less than wide and also covered in fine downy hairs with a single obscure impressed nerve on upper the upper surface. It usually blooms between May and August producing yellow flowers. The spherical flower-heads contain 25 to 40 yellow coloured flowers. After flowering sticky and leathery seed pods form. The linear to curved pods are in length and wide and have nerve-like margins and contain transversely arranged seeds with a length of . Distribution It is found in arid parts of central Australia in Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland. In Western Australia it is found in the Pilbara and northern Goldfields regions where it is usually found along creeks and on rocky hills and gullies growing in stony or sandy soils often around ironstone. It has a disjunct distribution form the Hamersley Range in the Pilabara where it is quite common extending east and becoming scattered from east of the Rawlinson Range in Western Australia. It is then found in the Macdonnell Ranges and Musgrave Ranges in the Northern Territory and then further east to around Dajarra in Queensland. Taxonomy The species was first formally described by the botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in 1874 as part of the work Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae. It is commonly mistaken for Acacia perryi which has larger stipules and phyllodes. Cultivation The species is naturally found growing in stony and sandy soils, and has been brought into cultivation for arid area gardening. The shrub is drought tolerant and regenerates easily from seed.

He is known for the \\"Lee-Sugawara relation\\" and \\"A Field Theory of Currents\\" aka \\"Sugawara Construction\\" of the energy-momentum tensor. Early life Sugawara was born in 1938 as a son of a Zen Buddhist in Miyagi, Japan. He obtained his BSc in Physics (1961), MSc in Physics (1963), and PhD in Physics (1966), from the University of Tokyo. Academic career When Sugawara was still a graduate student at the University of Tokyo, he derived a relation for non-leptonic hyperon decay amplitudes called \\"Lee-Sugawara relation\\" while studying the symmetry of weak interactions. He received his doctorate from the University of Tokyo in 1966, and has held postdoctoral research positions at Cornell University, University of California, Berkeley, and University of Chicago. Upon his return to Japan in 1968, he became a research associate at Tokyo University of Education, and he joined the University of Tokyo as an assistant professor in 1971. \\"A Field Theory of Currents\\" is known as the \\"\\"Sugawara model,\\" a dynamical model of local currents, in which the energy momentum tensor was expressed as a product of currents,\\" which opened the door to the algebraic formulation of field theories. In 1975, he was promoted to a full professor at the National Laboratory for High Energy Physics (today known as High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK)), where he served as the Director General from 1989 to 2003. While serving as the Director General at KEK, he concurrently held positions (professor, councilor, Dean, and steering committee member) at various organizations such as the Graduate University for Advanced Studies (SOKENDAI), National Institute for Physiological Science (NIPS), National Institute of Polar Research (NIPR), National Institute for Fusion Science (NIFS), Okazaki National Research Institutes, and Institutes of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS). He also served as a Chair of the International Committee for Future Accelerators (ICFA) from 1999 to 2002. KEKB, also called a B-factory for its copious production of B-mesons, is a particle accelerator used in the Belle experiment to study CP violation. He contributed significantly to the B-factory project as the Director General of KEK (the Japanese National Laboratory for High Energy Physics). He also provided strong leadership in setting up the long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment connecting the proton synchrotron at KEK (the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization) and Super-Kamiokande (Super-Kamioka Neutrino Detection Experiment, abbreviated to Super-K or SK) in Kamioka, Gifu. He led the launch of J-PARC (Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex) that was jointly developed between KEK and JAEA (the Japan Atomic Energy Agency). After serving as the Director General of KEK for 14 years, he became a Professor Emeritus at KEK and a professor at University of Hawaii, Manoa, in 2003. Concurrently he also served on the Mombusho Council for Research, and for other science councils in Japan. In 2004, he held an Executive Director position at Sokendai Graduate University for Advanced Studies. He became a Director (Washington DC Office) of Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) in 2008. Since 2012, he has been serving Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) as a Distinguished Professor and also as a Special Advisor to the President.

Life  Edith Caroline Parnell was born in Gillingham, Kent, England, in 1870. Her father was Colonel Hon. Arthur Parnell (18411914) and her mother was Mary Anne Dunn. On 7 April 1891, Edith married Venerable William Farmiloe, then vicar of St Peter's in Great Windmill Street, Soho, London. She was living with her husband at 124 Ashley Gardens, opposite Westminster Cathedral in 1901 and was by then listed in the census as an \\"artist'\\". In 1905, Rev. Farmiloe and his wife moved to South Hackney where he became vicar of St. Augustine's overlooking Victoria Park. Farmiloe died on 26 March 1921 at Abbey House, Bury St Edmund's, Suffolk, aged 50, and is commemorated in a stained glass window memorial by Robert Anning Bell in St James's, Nayland. The text reads \\"Edith Caroline Farmiloe and her life-work among women and children are here commemorated by her husband...who shared in her work and found in her fellowship and example an inspiration for his ministry in London.\\"  Career  Between 1895 and 1909, Farmiloe wrote about and illustrated the lives of children living in her husband's parish in Soho, and later in South Hackney. Her sketches, from her observing children playing on the streets, were used in Events of the Season, which appeared first in Little Folks magazine in November 1895. Detailed bibliographical references to Farmiloe's work are taken from Mr. Beare's 2010 study. Farmiloe went on to illustrate many children's books including All the World Over (1898), with verses by Edward Verrall Lucas. This collaboration resulted from an association with the publisher Franklin Thomas Grant Richards (who traded as 'Grant Richards'), made in 1897 when she created endpaper designs for his first three 'Dumpy Books for Children'. In All the World Over Farmiloe originated the colour drawings, receiving a royalty of 10% for the first 1500 copies and 15% thereafter. The venture was a success and 2000 copies had sold by the end of 1898. Farmiloe both wrote and illustrated at least eight books herself. These included 'Chousers' and other stories (1898), Piccalilli (1900), Chapel Street Children (1900), Young George - his Life (1902) and Mr Biddle and the Dragon (1904). = Critical reception = The Standard described All the World Over (1898) as \\"a pretty volume, brightly illustrated, representing funny children in the costumes of many countries.\\" The Pall Mall Gazette called Rag, Tag, and Bobtail (1989) \\"one of the few books which deserve a place on the shelves of every (nursery) library.\\" In its review of Piccalilli (1900), the same newspaper wrote that Farmiloe \\"has an exact eye for the humour and pathos of the children of the street, and her drawings are amazingly true to life, fresh, piquant, and convincing.\\" A review in The Graphic described Chapel Street Children (1900) as \\"a book which will delight children of any age,\\" adding that Farmiloe is \\"second to none in her delineations of Cockney gutter imps.\\" All the World Over London (East) ‚Äì The Diamond Jubilee  Selected works  * All the World Over (1898) with verses by writer E.

Robots capable of juggling are designed and built both to increase and test understanding and theories of human movement, juggling, and robotics. Juggling robots may include sensors to guide arm/hand movement or may rely on physical methods such as tracks or funnels to guide prop movement. Since true juggling requires more props than hands, many robots described as capable of juggling are not. Bounce juggling A toss juggling robot that can do more than a two ball column has only recently been built. However, Claude Shannon built the first juggling robot, a 3-ball bounce juggler, from an Erector Set, in the 1970s. ( ) \\"Bounce juggling is easier to accomplish than is toss juggling because the balls are grabbed at the top of their trajectories, when they are moving the slowest,\\" and Shannon's machine tendency to correct throwing errors was through tracks on its hands. By 1992, Christopher G. Atkeson and Stefan K. Schaal of the Georgia Institute of Technology built a similar 5-ball bounce juggling robot. Decorated as and named W. C. Fields, Shannon's machine used grooved cups/tracks instead of sensors or feedback.. Shannon also devised a juggling theorem. In 1989 Martin B√ºhler and Daniel E. Koditschek produced a juggler with one rotating bar, moving one way then the other, that bounces two-props in a fountain of indefinite length. Toss juggling Sakaguchi et al. (1991) and Miyazaki (1993) produced a one-armed two-ball fountain juggler with a funnel-shaped hand.

The two main elements of GCE are 'global consciousness'; the moral or ethical aspect of global issues, and 'global competencies', or skills meant to enable learners to participate in changing and developing the world. The promotion of GCE was a response by governments and NGOs to the emergence of supranational institution, regional economic blocs, and the development of information and communications technologies. These have all resulted in the emergence of a more globally oriented and collaborative approach to education. GCE addresses themes such as peace and human rights, intercultural understanding, citizenship education, respect for diversity and tolerance, and inclusiveness. GCE provides the overall lens which views the role of education in the promotion of the rule of law (RoL). It draws upon experience from other education processes, including human rights education, peace education, education for sustainable development, education for international and intercultural understanding. GCE aims to empower learners to engage and assume active roles, both locally and globally, as proactive contributors to a more just, peaceful, tolerant, inclusive, secure and sustainable world. GCE aspires to be a transformative experience, to give learners the opportunities and competencies to realize their rights and obligations to promote a better world and future. GCE is built on a lifelong learning perspective. It is not only for children and youth but also for adults. It can be delivered in formal, non-formal and informal settings. For this reason, GCE is part and parcel of the Sustainable Development Goal 4 on Education (SDG4, Target 4.7). GCE is also a component of the single indicator for Target 12.8 in Sustainable Development Goal 12 for \\"responsible consumption and production\\".United Nations (2017) Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 6 July 2017, Work of the Statistical Commission pertaining to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (A/RES/71/313)  Definition and origins  The Global Citizenship Foundation defines Global citizenship education as \\"a transformative, lifelong pursuit that involves both curricular learning and practical experience to shape a mindset to care for humanity and the planet, and to equip individuals with global competence to undertake responsible actions aimed at forging more just, peaceful, secure, sustainable, tolerant and inclusive societies.\\" Global citizenship consists of voluntary practices oriented to human rights, social justice, and environmentalism at the local, regional, and global level. Unlike national citizenship, global citizenship does not denote any legal status or allegiance to an actual form of government. The emergence of regional economic blocs, supra-national political institutions such as the European Union, and the advancement of ICTs, has caused governments to try to prepare national populations to be competitive in the global jobs market. This has led to the introduction of global citizenship education programs at primary, secondary, and tertiary level, but also at independent NGOs, grass roots organizations, and other large scale educational organizations, such as the International Baccalaureate Organization and UNESCO. The most important features of global citizenship education are voluntary action that can extend from local to international collectives; the practice of cultural empathy; and a focus on active participation in social and political life at the local and global level. In the late 1990s, OXFAM UK designed a curriculum for global citizenship education which stressed \\"the 'active' role of global citizens\\".In this approach, individuals and groups both inside and outside the educational sector might take action that addresses human rights, trade, poverty, health, and environmental issues, for example. This is sometimes called the 'global consciousness' aspect of GCE. However, organizations such as UNESCO have also begun to emphasize 'global competencies', including science and technology into their GCE curricula, to \\"strengthen linkages between education and economic development\\".  Emergence and development  In the present era of globalization, the recognition of global interdependence on the part of the general public has led to a higher degree of interest in global citizenship in education. Though modern schooling may have been oriented to education suitable for the nation- state throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, in the 21st century, citizenship is understood in global terms, so that schooling might improve individual nations' global competitiveness. Many universities worldwide have responded to the need for a globally oriented education by sending their students to study abroad in increasing numbers, and some have announced that this will soon become a mandatory degree requirement. Many governments also now promote GCE for the cohesion of society. The large numbers of people migrating across national borders means that the diversity of ethnic, religious, and linguistic groups, \\"has raised [...] complex and difficult questions about citizenship, human rights, democracy, and education\\". In addition, global issues related to sustainability, such as the world's future energy arrangements, have also been incorporated into the domain of global citizenship education.  Competences  While GCE can take different forms, it has some common elements, which include fostering in learners the following competences:UNESCO. 2014. Global Citizenship Education. Preparing Learners for the Challenges of the 21st Century. Paris, UNESCO. * An attitude supported by an understanding of multiple levels of identity, and the potential for a collective identity that transcends individual cultural, religious, ethnic or other differences (such as a sense of belongingness to common humanity, and respect for diversity); * A deep knowledge of global issues and universal values such as justice, equality, dignity and respect (such as understanding of the process of globalization, interdependence/ interconnectedness, the global challenges which cannot be adequately or uniquely addressed by nation states, sustainability as the main concept of the future); * Cognitive skills to think critically, systemically and creatively, including adopting a multi- perspective approach that recognizes different dimensions, perspectives and angles of issues (such as reasoning and problem-solving skills supported by a multi-perspective approach); * Non-cognitive skills, including social skills such as empathy and conflict resolution, and communication skills and aptitudes for networking and interacting with people of different backgrounds, origins, cultures and perspectives (such as global empathy, sense of solidarity); and * Behavioural capacities to act collaboratively and responsibly to find global solutions to global challenges, and to strive for the collective good.  Pedagogy  Most educators agree that \\"global citizenship is a learned and nurtured behavior\\",Tarrant, 2010:442 and the most widely used classroom strategy for developing global skills is project-based learning. This pedagogical technique can be utilized in the case of almost any school subject, \\"[and] is the primary pedagogical strategy in the discourse of global competencies. Educators see it as an important method for developing the tools- technical and emotional- for success in the global society\\".Dill, 2013:14 With the aim of nurturing students' potential to be both learners and citizens, the project-based approach has been used successfully in community- based learning, for example.Melaville & Berg et al, 2006 Another important pedagogical feature of GCE is learning through communicative practices outside the classroom that \\"harness [‚Ä¶] the educational force of the wider culture\\".Catalano, 2013:3 If students are encouraged \\"to see themselves as political agents\\", educators assume they are more likely to acquire the knowledge, skills and abilities that enable them to become agents of change.Catalano, 2013 Another important element of the student-centered participatory nature of GCED, is that students, through their engagement with others via Social Network Services, create their own forms of global citizenship through dialogue, learning, and action.Bourn, 2009 This is an important element, for example, in the activities of grassroots organizations like 'GIN' (Global Issues Network), and Global Citizenship Foundation which involves students and teachers in projects that address global issues such as human rights, trade rules, and deforestation.Dill, 2013 Such student-driven, student-led projects combine both the 'global consciousness' and 'global competence' aspects of GCED. UNESCO developed a competency framework on GCE with key learning outcomes, learner attributes and learning objectives to help guide policymakers and curriculum developers in their efforts to develop national curricula that empower learners to assume active roles, both locally and globally. This competency framework is based on a vision of learning that covers three domains to create a well-rounded learning experience: Cognitive, Socio-Emotional and Behavioural. Although conceptually distinct, these three domains do not represent isolated learning processes; they often overlap, mutually reinforce and build upon each other, and can also occur in parallel. For example, socio-emotional learning (SEL) requires understanding existing challenges in the community (cognitive) and making informed decisions (behaviour). By delivering lessons using all three domains, teachers are more likely to develop the broad range of knowledge, attitudes, values and behaviours that are expected of GCE. This approach also makes it possible to address the four pillars of learning that are key to ensuring learners are equipped with the skills they need to face the world as active and engaged citizens: Learning to know, to do, to be and to live together. GCED domains of learning and expected learning outcomes GCE includes three domains of learning, cited below: * The cognitive domain includes thinking processes that involve the acquisition, organization and use of knowledge and information. * The socio-emotional domain includes the development of skills that facilitate learners‚Äô emotional welfare and successful interactions with others, including peers, teachers and family members and those in their community. * The behavioural domain includes the development of the ability to use learned materials or to implement material in new and concrete situations. GCE has three expected learning outcomes, including how: * Learners acquire knowledge and understanding of local, national and global issues and the interconnectedness and interdependency of different countries and populations. Learners develop skills for critical thinking and analysis. * Learners experience a sense of belonging to a common humanity, sharing values and responsibilities, based on human rights. Learners develop attitudes of empathy, solidarity and respect for differences and diversity. * Learners act effectively and responsibly at local, national and global levels for a more peaceful and sustainable world. Learners develop motivation and willingness to take necessary actions. ;'Global consciousness' and 'global competence' Organizations implementing GCE programs, such as UNESCO, now emphasize the importance of expanding both students' 'global consciousness' and 'global competence'. 'Global consciousness' represents the ethical or moral dimension of global citizenship, whereas 'global competence' \\"features a blend of the technical-rational and the dispositional or attitudinal\\".Dill, 2013:11 However, some view global consciousness and global competence as being closely related.Grudinski Hall, 2007 The OECD, for instance, focuses on global competencies called 'psychosocial resources', of which there are three main types: \\"using tools interactively (technology and language skills), interacting in heterogeneous groups (cooperation, empathy), and acting autonomously (realizing one's identity, conducting life plans, defending and asserting rights\\".Dill, 2013: 12-13  Key learner attributes  GCE identifies three learner attributes, which refer to the traits and qualities that global citizenship education aims to develop in learners and correspond to the key learning outcomes mentioned earlier. These are: informed and critically literate; socially connected and respectful of diversity; ethically responsible and engaged. The three learner attributes draw on a review of the literature and of citizenship education conceptual frameworks, a review of approaches and curricula, as well as technical consultations and recent work by UNESCO on global citizenship education. = Informed and critically literate = Learners develop their understanding of the world, global themes, governance structures and systems, including politics, history and economics; understand the rights and responsibilities of individuals and groups (for example, women‚Äôs and children‚Äôs rights, indigenous rights, corporate social responsibility); and, recognise the interconnectedness of local, national and global issues, structures and processes. Learners develop the skills of critical inquiry (for example, where to find information and how to analyse and use evidence), media literacy and an understanding of how information is mediated and communicated. They develop their ability to inquire into global themes and issues (for example, globalisation, interdependence, migration, peace and conflict, sustainable development) by planning investigations, analysing data and communicating their findings. A key issue is the way in which language is used and, more specifically, how critical literacy is affected by the dominance of the English language and how this influences non- English speakers‚Äô access to information. = Socially connected and respectful of diversity = Learners learn about their identities and how they are situated within multiple relationships (for example, family, friends, school, local community, country), as a basis for understanding the global dimension of citizenship. They develop an understanding of difference and diversity (for example, culture, language, gender, sexuality, religion), of how beliefs and values influence people‚Äôs views about those who are different, and of the reasons for, and impact of, inequality and discrimination. Learners also consider common factors that transcend difference, and develop the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes required for respecting difference and living with others. = Ethically responsible and engaged = Learners explore their own beliefs and values and those of others. They understand how beliefs and values inform social and political decision-making at local, national, regional and global levels, and the challenges for governance of contrasting and conflicting beliefs and values. Learners also develop their understanding of social justice issues in local, national, regional and global contexts and how these are interconnected. Ethical issues (for example, relating to climate change, consumerism, economic globalisation, fair trade, migration, poverty and wealth, sustainable development, terrorism, war) are also addressed. Learners are expected to reflect on ethical conflicts related to social and political responsibilities and the wider impact of their choices and decisions. Learners also develop the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes to care for others and the environment and to engage in civic action. These include compassion, empathy, collaboration, dialogue, social entrepreneurship and active participation. They learn about opportunities for engagement as citizens at local, national and global levels, and examples of individual and collective action taken by others to address global issues and social injustice.  Examples  = Council for Global Citizenship Education, India (and global) = Council for Global Citizenship Education ‚Äî part of the Global Citizenship Foundation, a non-profit organization based in India ‚Äî assists schools to adopt a participatory whole-school approach to global citizenship education through the GCED Innovative Schools Initiative. The initiative fosters continuous professional development (CPD) of educators; teacher-led contextualization, design, and development of GCED curriculum; engagement of children through the '100 Acts of Global Citizenship' School Challenge; and community through a Global Citizenship Festival at '100 Acts of Global Citizenship' participating schools. The Council for Global Citizenship Education initiative has also been implemented in 18 States of India and has a global presence through their GCED Ambassadors Program. = High Resolves, Australia = High Resolves is a secondary school educational initiative (implemented by the FYA, the only national, independent non-profit organisation for young people in Australia) consisting of a Global Citizenship Programme for Year 8 students and a Global Leadership Programme for Year 9 and 10 students. It aims to enable students to consider their personal role in developing their society as a global community through workshops, simulations, leadership skills training and hands-on action projects. = Developing the global dimension in the school curriculum, England = In England, the Department for Education and Skills produced Developing the global dimension in the school curriculum, a publication for head teachers, teachers, senior managers and those with responsibility for curriculum development. It aims to show how the global dimension can be integrated in the curriculum and across the school. It provides examples of how to integrate the global dimension from age 3 to age 16, outlining eight key concepts ‚Äì global citizenship, conflict resolution, diversity, human rights, interdependence, sustainable development, values and perceptions, and social justice. For example, it gives guidance for the promotion of personal, social and emotional development of the youngest learners through discussion of photographs of children from around the world, activities, stories, and discussion of different places children have visited. = Activate, South Africa = Activate is a network of young leaders in South Africa which aims to bring about change though creative solutions to problems in society. Youth from all backgrounds and provinces in the country participate in a two-year programme. In the first year, there are three residential training programmes, working on a particular task. In the second year, participants form action groups on specific tasks, taking their work into the public domain. In one example, an Activator describes how he works in his local community to discourage young people away from joining gangs and engaging in substance abuse. He draws on his own negative experiences with gangs and drugs, having served seven years in jail. On being interviewed, he states: ‚ÄúMy vision for South Africa is to see young people standing up and becoming role models... Be yourself, be real and pursue your dreams‚Äù. = Peace First, United States and Colombia = Peace First, a non-profit organisation based in the United States, has a programme in which youth volunteers work with children to design and implement community projects in a participatory way. The rationale is that children are natural creative thinkers and problem solvers. The programme focuses on developing social and emotional skills of self- awareness, empathy, inclusivity and relationships. It has also been implemented in rural areas of Colombia through a partnership between local governments and Colombian NGOs. Peace First has additionally developed a curriculum that can be used in schools. It addresses themes such as friendship, fairness, cooperation, con ict resolution and consequences of actions through experiential activities and cooperative games. For example, 1st graders learn about communicating their feelings, 3rd graders develop skills and awareness around communication and cooperation, 4th graders practice courage and taking a stand and 5th graders explore how to resolve and de-escalate conflicts. = Tokyo Global Engineering Corporation, Japan (and global) = Tokyo Global Engineering Corporation is an education-services organization that provides capstone education programs free of charge to engineering students and other stakeholders. These programs are intended to complement‚Äîbut not to replace‚Äîcoursework required by academic degree programs of study. The programs are educational opportunities, and students are not paid money for their participation. All correspondence among members is completed via e-mail, and all meetings are held via Skype, with English as the language of instruction and publication. Students and other stakeholders are never asked to travel or leave their geographic locations, and are encouraged to publish organizational documents in their personal, primary languages, when English is a secondary language.  Connection to Education for Sustainable Development (ESD)  GCE and ESD pursue the same vision: It is all about empowering learners of all ages to become proactive contributors to a more just, peaceful, tolerant, inclusive and sustainable world. Both GCED and ESD: * focus not only on the content and outcome of what is learned, but also on the process of how it is learned and in what type of environment it is learned. * emphasize action, change and transformation. * place importance on acquiring values and attitudes relevant to addressing global challenges. * foster skills for collaboration, communication and critical thinking. Both GCE and ESD help learners understand the interconnected world in which they live and the complexities of the global challenges faced.UNESCO. 2010. Teaching and Learning for a Sustainable Future: A multimedia teacher education programme. UNESCO, Paris. http://www.unesco.org/education/tlsf/mods/theme_d/mod22.html GCE and ESD help learners to develop their knowledge, skills, attitudes and values so that they can address these challenges responsibly and effectively now and in the future.UNESCO. Global Citizenship Education: Unesco‚Äôs approach. http://www.unesco.org/new/ leadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/ED/pdf/questions- answers-21jan-EN.pdf  Connection to Education for Justice  GCED provides the overall framework for education for justice or the approach to the rule of law (RoL). It aims to empower learners to engage and assume active roles, both locally and globally, as proactive contributors to a more just, peaceful, tolerant, inclusive, secure and sustainable world. The GCED expected learning outcomes are based on a vision of learning that covers three domains to create a well-rounded learning experience: cognitive, socio-emotional and behavioural. Although distinct, the three domains do not represent isolated learning processes; they often overlap, reinforce and build upon each other, and can also occur in parallel. For example, socio-emotional learning requires understanding existing challenges in the community (cognitive) and making informed decisions (behavioural). Teachers strive to develop learners‚Äô ability to use the knowledge they have, or have gained, to alter their behaviours and ‚Äòdo the right thing‚Äô in the appropriate circumstances. For example, learning how to take ethical decisions and speaking out against discrimination. Making this shift from ‚Äòknowing‚Äô to ‚Äòdoing‚Äô involves helping learners apply their knowledge to real-world situations.  Objections  Some fundamentalist critics believe GCE might undermine religious education and promote secular values.Schattle, 2008 Others are concerned that the pedagogical approach of most global citizenship education curricula are too often produced in particular Northern, Western contexts.Andreotti and de Souza, 2012:18 Some critics claim that GCE curricula promote values that are too individualistic. Dill,2013 for example, claims that \\"the majority of the world experiences social and communal life not in terms of isolated individuals, but as collective identities and traditions. For many of these groups, the dominant forms of global citizenship education and its moral order will be experienced as coercive and unjust',Dill, 2013:33 so 'global' citizenship curriculum should be seen as a local practice, \\"which diverse cultures will conceptualize and construct differently\\".Myers, 2006:13  See also  *Climate Change Education (CCE) *Climate-friendly school *Education 2030 Agenda *Futures of Education *UNESCO ASPnet  References   Sources    *  Bibliography   Bourn, D.

Deasy organized what was to be a 30,000-man walking protest from Cork to the Irish Parliament at D√°il √âireann in Dublin. This was followed by a 20-day sit-in protest and a six-month campaign of civil disobedience by farmers, culminating in the Irish Farmers' Association being officially recognized by the Irish Government. Recognition of the Farmers' Association was seen as a major step forward for social partnership in Ireland, and a consultative approach to economic participation. It attracted widespread media attention, coming at a time of general distrust towards groups advocating greater economic equality. Deasy was at times accused of being a Marxist, which may have thwarted his electoral chances in a mainly rural constituency. His role in the farmers' movement was considered to have damaged the political aspirations of Charlie Haughey.Charles Haughey#Minister for Agriculture: 1966 Farmers.27 Strike Deasy married Countess Sheila O'Kelly de Gallagh.

Marius van der Leeuw was partner of the firm Erven de Wed. J. van Nelle, wholesalers in coffee, tea and tobacco. Koos and his brothers Cees (Cornelis Hendrik van der Leeuw, 1890-1973) and Dick (Marius Adrianus Gabri√´l van der Leeuw, 1894-1936) were known in Rotterdam as ‚ÄúThe Dandys‚Äù due to their modern and luxurious lifestyle. Van der Leeuw died in a plane crash in Tanganyika, Africa, on August 23, 1934. He was single without children.  Education  After graduating in 1910, van der Leeuw left for Cologne to study at the School of Economics. He abandoned this study to opt for Law School at Leiden University. During his study years he founded the Dutch section of the English Practical Idealists Association (PIA), a youth movement aimed at initiating a paradigm shift of the spiritual mind amongst students. Other members in this organization included Adriaan Viruly and Kees Boeke. Because of his scientific aspirations it soon became clear that Van der Leeuw would not become his father‚Äôs successor as CEO at Van Nelle. In 1920 he received his PhD at Leiden University with a thesis titled Historical Idealist Politics.  Theosophy  J.J. van der Leeuw was a close friend of Jiddu Krishnamurti. Just like his brother Cees, he was closely involved with hosting the annual Order of the Star camps at the Eerde estate in Ommen. This property was owned by Philip baron van Pallandt and it was here that Krishnamurti had settled his Order of the Star in the East. In 1924 J.J. van der Leeuw went to Australia for occult training with C.W. Leadbeater, who was at that time guiding young people spiritually in Sydney. J.J. van der Leeuw became a priest in the Liberal Catholic Church and treasurer of the Manor, the villa owned by the Theosophical Society in Sydney. There he also founded the King Arthur‚Äôs School for boys. Back in the Netherlands van der Leeuw was elected as president of the Dutch Section of the Theosophical Society from 1930 until 1931. He was well known for his lecture Revelation or Realization, The Conflict in Theosophy which he held at the Federation of Theosophical Lodges in London on June 15, 1930, at the Dutch convention on June 21, 1930, and before the Congress of the European Federation on June 30, 1930. In this lecture he publicly defended Krishnamurti who had disbanded the Order of the Star in 1929.  Political Activities  In the early Thirties Van der Leeuw traveled the world to elaborate on his social-scientific and philosophical ideas. They were, to a large extent, dedicated to his wish to kick-start a new world order. He had become member of the London-based New Commonwealth, which was meant to be the protagonist of a new world authority to maintain international order and strive for world peace. Besides all this he was also dedicated to education. Interactions with Sigmund Freud Van der Leeuw lived in London, but during 1933 was a regular visitor of Sigmund Freud in Vienna, where he was being analyzed. At one point in his analysis, the poet H.D. had the hour after him, and wrote about her brief interactions with him in her essay of reminiscences of Freud. Freud called Van der Leeuw an ‚Äúeminent scholar‚Äù (Friedman 2002, p. 400). Death Van der Leeuw received his pilot‚Äôs license in 1933. In 1934 he was invited by The New Education Fellowship in South Africa to hold a lecture during their Johannesburg conference. Especially for this purpose Van der Leeuw bought a De Havilland Leopard Moth (GA-CCLX). During his return flight from this conference Van der Leeuw crashed into a mountain the republic of Tanganyika. His demise received a lot of attention by both the national and international press.

She is best known as drummer for the San Francisco-based band 4 Non Blondes from 1991 to 1994.  Musical career  =Early life and education= Dawn Richardson was born in Pasadena, California. At the age of 13, after a friend's idea to learn a new instrument intrigued her, she broke away from playing the trombone and picked up a set of drumsticks instead. Richardson began taking lessons from Jim Volpe, a drum teacher and \\"local rock guy\\" in Southern California. Richardson earned her undergraduate degree in music, concentrating in percussion, at California State University, Los Angeles. She has studied with the principal percussionist of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and with studio musicians such as Steve Houghton and Greg Goodall. =4 Non Blondes= Richardson joined the band 4 Non Blondes in 1991, after the band had achieved local popularity in the San Francisco area. At the time, 4 Non Blondes had just been signed to Interscope Records. Richardson met the band through mutual friends and was asked to audition for them after the departure of their original drummer, Wanda Day. Richardson was hired directly after her audition, and relocated from Hollywood to San Francisco. The group's 1992 debut album Bigger, Better, Faster, More! received Gold and Platinum status in the US, was the No. 1 album in eight countries, went Gold in 16 countries, and went Platinum in seven. In 1993, the band's single \\"What's Up?\\", a rock song written by lead singer Linda Perry, topped the charts, reaching No. 1 in twelve countries. However, after touring North America and Europe, the group disbanded in 1994 while in the middle of recording their second album. On May 11, 2014, Richardson and 4 Non Blondes reunited to perform at the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles, in a fundraiser to benefit the Los Angeles Gay & Lesbian Center. =Later career= In addition to 4 Non Blondes, Richardson has been a member of bands such as The Loud Family, The Martinis (featuring Joey Santiago of the Pixies), Bad Radio, Dolorata, and Kindness. With Joe Gore, she formed the instrumental duo Mental 99. She has performed, recorded, or toured with Tracy Chapman, Shana Morrison, Penelope Houston, Gus, Angel Corpus Christi, and The Paul & John. She is the author of six books, including most recently an instructional book with an accompanying video, Chart Topping Drum Fills (2014). Richardson plays music and teaches drum lessons in San Francisco.  Bibliography  Richardson has six book publications, all focused on teaching, mastering, and appreciating the art of drumming. * Building Blocks of Rock: Fundamental Patterns and Exercises for the Rock Drummer (1998) * Dawn Richardson's Fill Workbook: Short Fills and the Tools to Create Your Own (2005) * Block Rockin' Beats: Funky Rock, Hip-hop, Jungle, Drum 'n' Bass Grooves (2006) * Beginning Rock Drum Chart (2010) * Kid's Rock Drum Method (2011) * Chart-Topping Drum Fills: The 60s Through Today (2014) Richardson has also written articles and conducted interviews for magazines such as Drum! and Edge (Drum Workshop), the online magazine Percussion Sessions, and for the Pacific Drums web site.

The film premiered at the Jacksonville Film Festival for its hometown screening, and went on to tour regional film festivals around the country, including the PollyGrind Film Festival, where it won the Skate or Die Award, and the Sunscreen Film Festival, where it won Best Florida Film. The film was released theatrically on March 1, 2013. Plot The film focuses primarily on Jesse Sorensen, played by co-writer Jesse Gay, a washed-up professional skateboarding star now six years past his prime. After being dropped by his skate team and kicked off a friend's couch, Jesse moves in with his elderly grandmother only to discover his teenaged niece, Samantha (Corsica Wilson), crashing there as well. Having himself always led the wild lifestyle, Jesse becomes uncomfortable when Samantha opens up to him about dropping out of high school and partying. On a deeper level, Jesse confronts what he has spent his entire life avoiding - responsibility. The film simultaneously follows the rapid rise of Strazz (James Nguyen), the young skate star who took Jesse's spot on the DieNasty Skate Team, chronicling the dangers of fast fame and money, and the subsequent fall-out between Jesse and Strazz. Cast *Jesse Gay as Jesse Sorensen *Corsica Wilson as Samantha Sorensen *Erin Nicole Cline as Paige *James Nguyen as Strazz *Bryan Carson as Jesse's son Production =Short film= The feature-length film was based on a short film of the same name, which premiered at the 2009 Gen Art Film Festival for Emerging Talent. An experimental project that was shot on black and white 8mm film with no dialogue, the short film instead incorporated subtitles for the character's lines and interaction. It was only after the strong reaction the film received from the New York crowd that Barry and co- writer Gay decided to expand the idea into a feature-length film. =Filming= Barry and Gay began writing the feature together in 2009 and Barry quit his day job to begin pre-production shortly thereafter, but when he realized that he was only able to acquire half of the film's required budget through investors, Barry put the other half of the budget on his credit cards. Filming took place in Jacksonville, FL over February and March 2010, including at the legendary Kona Skatepark. The film was shot on multiple media, including the digital Canon EOS 7D, as well as motion picture film: on Super 8mm and Super 16mm film. Cody Mattox wrote at the time of the film's release, \\"When director Patrick Barry wanted to shoot his debut feature film, Veer!, on 16mm black & white film stock, production couldn‚Äôt afford that financial commitment; this limitation gave Barry the inspiration to break the film up into black & white film and color video portions. It is safe to say that this decision helps drive the narrative in an intriguing way, though I won‚Äôt spoil how...\\" Of the production, Barry said, \\"It was a tough, in-the-trenches experience, and there were some very difficult moments where I wasn‚Äôt sure if the film was going to get finished, but the cast and crew really kept the train moving. I drew strength from them towards the end of the production.\\" =Music= In an attempt to keep the film as local as possible, Barry and Gay only sourced local talent for music in the film. With the exception of composer Nathan Matthew David, of Los Angeles, all of the musical acts were based out of Jacksonville, Florida. The soundtrack included music by Crash the Satellites, After the Bomb Baby, Juicy Pony, Powerball, Christina Wagner, and Kevin Newberry. =Style= Barry played with many experimental techniques during shooting leading to what he felt was \\"disappointment\\" by audience members expecting a more traditional narrative structure.

In the middle of the 1924 season he transferred to Hawthorn Juniors and played in the losing Grand Final team in the Junior Competition. It was during this period that Pickford started being referred to as \\"Jack\\" (presumably derived from the Hollywood star of the time, Jack Pickford). Pickford rejoined Hawthorn as they entered in VFL competition in 1925. He played in their first ever VFL match and appeared consistently through their first four seasons in the League. He was selected as part of a League representative team in 1927. In 1929 Pickford transferred to VFA club Brighton where he played for three seasons. In 1932 he joined Melbourne and appeared in two games for them towards the end of the season. Pickford graduated from Swinburne Senior Technical College (now Swinburne University of Technology) as a civil engineer in 1938 and later worked for the Civil Aviation Authority. In 1969 he was awarded an Imperial Service Order for his work as First Assistant Director-General of Civil Aviation. He died while visiting Launceston in Tasmania in July 1971.

It was first broadcast on BBC One on 4 October 2014. The episode was written by Peter Harness and directed by Paul Wilmshurst. Set in 2049, the episode has the school teacher Clara (Jenna Coleman), student Courtney Woods (Ellis George), and astronaut Lundvik (Hermione Norris) facing a time-sensitive moral dilemma over whether to kill a giant creature under the Moon‚Äîwhich is an egg the creature has been slowly growing inside‚Äîor to let the creature hatch, the three of them being uncertain what will happen to the people on Earth. The episode received polarising reviews from television critics, though Coleman's performance and the climactic scene between Clara and the Doctor (Peter Capaldi) received universal praise. Whilst some critics acclaimed the episode and labelled it the best of the season, others criticised its scientific inaccuracy and thematic content. Plot The Twelfth Doctor takes Clara and her student Courtney on a trip to the Moon. They arrive in 2049 aboard a space shuttle filled with nuclear bombs on a crash course for the Moon. Captain Lundvik explains her crew is on a suicide mission to destroy the Moon; the Doctor deduces from the gravity that the Moon's mass has increased, causing massive high tides everywhere on Earth. They travel to a nearby mineral survey base, finding the miners dead, entombed in webbing. The Doctor notices from the miners' photographs that the Moon is starting to break apart. They are attacked by a spider-like creature that kills Lundvik's crew, but the disinfecting spray Courtney brought kills the creature. The Doctor finds the presence of amniotic fluid near a crevasse outside. Returning to the base, the Doctor asserts that the Moon is and always has been an egg containing a giant creature growing inside, ready to hatch, with the spider being one of thousands of bacteria under its surface. Lundvik becomes even more insistent to blow up the Moon, unsure of the nature of the creature that might hatch. The Doctor leaves Clara, Courtney, and Lundvik in the base to decide the creature's‚Äîand Earth's‚Äîfate. Lundvik primes a remote trigger for the nuclear bombs set on a timer. The three argue what to do and conclude by letting Earth's population decide. Clara pleads over broadcast channels for Earth to decide the fate of the creature by leaving their lights on to allow the creature to live, or turning off their lights if they should destroy it. They see the lights on Earth turn off over the next hour. At the last second, Clara changes her mind and stops the countdown. The Doctor arrives shortly afterwards, assures they have made the right choice, and evacuates them from the Moon as it starts to crumble. The winged creature inside the Moon hatches from its shell and flies off. It lays another egg that becomes a new moon. The Doctor reveals that the sudden interest in the Moon will reinvigorate Earth's space program. Clara angrily accosts the Doctor for forcing her to make a decision on the fate of humanity, while the Doctor asserts he cannot be allowed to make those choices himself. Clara tells the Doctor she does not want to see him again, and takes comfort with Danny in the present. =Continuity= The Doctor (Peter Capaldi) uses a yo-yo to test the Moon's gravity inside the shuttle. The Fourth Doctor used the same method to test gravity in the Nerva space station in The Ark in Space (1975).. According to executive producer Brian Minchin, Capaldi had requested the yo-yo to be similar to the one that Tom Baker had used before. The Doctor tells Clara that \\"Earth isn't my home\\", echoing the Fourth Doctor's statement in Pyramids of Mars (1975) that \\"The Earth isn't my home, Sarah. I'm a Time Lord. I walk in eternity.\\" In \\"The Fires of Pompeii\\" (2008), the Tenth Doctor says that as a Time Lord, he can see both fixed and mutable points in time. The Twelfth Doctor says the same thing here, but that there are \\"grey areas\\", points in time for which he cannot see the outcome.. The Doctor claims that Courtney will meet \\"this bloke called Blinovitch\\". This refers to the Blinovitch Limitation Effect, first mentioned in the Third Doctor story Day of the Daleks (1972). Production =Writing= The episode was originally written for Matt Smith's Eleventh Doctor. An early working title for the episode was \\"Return to Sarn\\", however, this was intended to be misleading. While briefing Harness on how to write the script, executive producer Steven Moffat told him to \\"Hinchcliffe the shit out of it for the first half\\", meaning, essentially, to make it frightening. This was in reference to Philip Hinchcliffe, who produced Doctor Who from 1974‚Äì1977, a period known as especially frightening during the classic series. Moffat called the script \\"intense and emotional\\". Harness has said that the episode will see a large change for the show. \\"I still don‚Äôt know how people will take it. I‚Äôm in this kind of limbo now waiting for people to see it, and I‚Äôve no idea, really I do not know how it is going to go down.\\" =Filming= Filming for the episode took place in Lanzarote, near the Volc√°n del Cuervo (Raven's Volcano) in Timanfaya National Park. The last episode to be filmed there was 1984's Fifth Doctor serial Planet of Fire. Filming took place on 12‚Äì13 May, while the park was closed to visitors, with locals reporting that ‚Äúthey‚Äôve erected a huge marquee, have trailers, toilets and a van.‚Äù Filming also took place at Aberavon Beach in Port Talbot on 21 May. =Casting= Tony Osoba previously appeared in the classic serials Destiny of the Daleks (1979) and Dragonfire (1987). Broadcast and reception The overnight viewing figures were estimated at 4.81 million. The episode was watched by a total of 6.91 million viewers.. On BBC America, 0.94 million viewers watched the original broadcast.. The episode received an AI score of 82. =Critical reception= \\"Kill the Moon\\" received polarising reviews. Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club labelled the episode an instant classic, and Simon Brew of Den of Geek called it one of the show's very best, while Ewan Spence of Forbes found it poorly written with weak characters and themes.. However, critics were unanimous in their acclaim for Jenna Coleman's performance and the final sequence in the TARDIS... Writing for The Daily Telegraph, Ben Lawrence noted that \\"'Kill the Moon' was an excellent example of Doctor Who reaching out to different generations, something it hasn't always done in recent weeks.\\" He felt Coleman was \\"terrific\\" and that Capaldi added further layers of complexity to his character. Lawrence stated that the guests were underdeveloped, but concluded that, \\"it lacked the clever-cleverness that has marred recent episodes and proved how good Doctor Who can be when it simply tells a story.\\" Dan Martin, writing for The Guardian, stated that \\"Clara's outburst was the next stage in what I have loved about this series most of all. More than ever before, they're playing out the reality of running off to fight aliens with a time- travelling space detective. And, guess what, this life is not all wine and roses.\\" Martin noted that Coleman has been terrific all series stating that \\"We no longer need to make note of just how good Jenna is this year; she‚Äôs already established herself in pantheon of all-time great companions.\\" Writing in The Independent, Neela Debnath praised Coleman's performance, articulating that she \\"impressed again with her fury as she held the Doctor to account. This is the grown up assistant the Time Lord needs to keep him in check\\" and ultimately closed her review by saying \\"'Kill the Moon' was an enclosed space adventure with all the claustrophobia that an episode like this demands [...] It was hardly the strongest episode of the series but it was no car crash either.\\".. Patrick Mulkern heavily praised the episode, awarding it a perfect 5/5 in Radio Times. He also praised Coleman's performance, stating that \\"Coleman expertly conveys Clara‚Äôs terrible dilemma ‚Äì and later her tearful fury at the Doctor‚Äôs behaviour\\". He described the episode's writing as \\"audacious, highly imaginative, and is well matched by Paul Wilmshurst‚Äôs supremely eerie, cinematic direction\\", and closed his review by noting \\"Portentous dialogue, sharp direction, urgent music and a powerhouse performance from Peter Capaldi make this one of the defining moments of the season\\". Despite mixed reviews for the episode as a whole, Jenna Coleman received universal acclaim for her performance. Brew affirmed that \\"Doctor Who hits top form with 'Kill the Moon'. And Jenna Coleman has never been better\\". He also praised Harness' script as \\"impressive\\" and said that Wilmshurst \\"fully understands that slowing things down and making little moments count is the key to crawling under people's skins\\". He closed his review by saying \\"The best Doctor Who episodes have something to say, get under your skin, and keep you pretty much gripped until the end credits roll. 'Kill the Moon' certainly did that, with us heading for a rewatch as soon as it was done. It has a good science fiction story underneath it, a strong dilemma, and real consequences\\". Wilkins also reacted very positively to the episode, awarding it an A score praising almost every aspect of the episode, but particularly the focus on character development. He said \\"'Kill the Moon' is the second time this season that Doctor Who has genuinely surprised me. That fact, above all else, is why tonight‚Äôs episode rates as an instant classic\\" and went on to praise the episode's final scene, saying that \\"Maybe the whole Moffat era is going to be defined by that final scene in the TARDIS, in which Clara delivers the most blistering rebuke we have ever seen any companion give the Doctor\\". He ended his review by claiming that \\"This season is already a return to form, but 'Kill the Moon' could help turn it into something truly special\\". For IGN, Matt Risley labeled the episode as \\"The best Capaldi Who yet\\" and awarded it a score of 9.3/10, deemed \\"Excellent\\". He praised almost every aspect of the episode, saying \\"Dramatic, thought-provoking, gorgeously shot, dryly hilarious and consistently compelling, 'Kill the Moon' was easily the best episode of the season so far, and we'd even put good money on it staying that way come the end of November\\". He also praised Coleman's performance as \\"explosive and mouth-gapingly compelling\\" and summarised the episode as \\"grown-up sci-fi at its best\\". In contrast, some reviewers criticised what they perceived to be plot elements alluding to the abortion debate and, moreover, how the issue was dealt with in the script. In a separate review for The Independent, Ellen E. Jones described the episode as \\"perhaps the weakest so far... The grey moon surface provided an uninspiring backdrop for what amounted to a galactic metaphor for the pro-choice debate\\".. Spence described the script as \\"leaden and heavy... the lack of consequences to [Clara's] decision left the episode with a hollow ring.\\" The review praised Capaldi's and Coleman's performances, but concluded that \\"'Kill the Moon' wasn't good drama, it delivered false controversy, and it did not respect the debate it was trying to start in the viewers at home.\\" For The Escapist, Elizabeth Harper gave the episode one and a half stars and felt it was \\"a mess of pseudoscience\\". She summarised that \\"This episode is a string of scenes that don't make a lot of sense, but are vaguely held together by virtue of the fact that they all happen on the same channel in the same one-hour period.\\" She added finally that \\"The last scene, however, is genuinely good.\\" Other reviews were also critical of the episode's lack of scientific accuracy, mainly about the Moon. Writing for Slate, Phil Plait remarked, \\"The science mistakes were so egregious and so obvious that they kept pulling me right out of the story. A lot of the mistakes were fixable with a simple Google search.\\". In his review for Doctor Who TV, Clint Hassell had a similar objection. While he praised both the actors' performances and the story's ability to \\"examine aspects of the human condition\\", he said the episode was \\"also terrible, presenting a version of science so incorrect that it almost creates a new genre ‚Äì 'not-so-science fiction'\\". Though part of the fun of the show is \\"obviously make-believe, sciencey-wiencey facts and jargon\\", he believed that, \\"When [The Doctor] states blatantly wrong science 'facts' because the writer couldn‚Äôt be bothered to think rationally, or consult a scientist, that makes the Doctor look like an idiot, and...ruins part of the believability of the show.\\".

See Robert Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", Cambridge University Press, 1990, pp. 194‚Äì195 and p. 318. by Erik Satie. They were written between August and November 1919. With the exception of the Premier Menuet (1920) they were his final works for solo piano, and are considered among his most significant achievements in the genre.Rollo H. Myers, \\"Erik Satie\\", Dover Publications, Inc., NY, 1968, p. 58. Originally published in 1948 by Denis Dobson Ltd., London.Patrick Gowers and Nigel Wilkins, \\"Erik Satie\\", \\"The New Grove: Twentieth-Century French Masters\\", Macmillan Publishers Limited, London, 1986, p. 142. Reprinted from \\"The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians\\", 1980 edition. The Nocturnes stand apart from Satie's piano music of the 1910s in their complete seriousness, lacking the zany titles, musical parody, and extramusical texts he typically featured in his scores of the time. In performance the set lasts about 13 minutes. Background Much had transpired in Satie's personal and professional lives in the two years since his previous keyboard piece, the Neoclassical spoof Sonatine bureaucratique (1917). There was the fallout from the scandalous premiere of his ballet Parade (1917),\\"Parade has separated me from a great many friends. This work is the cause of many misfortunes.\\" Erik Satie, letter to Henry Pruni√®res dated September 14, 1917. Quoted in Ornella Volta (ed.), \\"Satie Seen Through His Letters\\", Marion Boyars Publishers, London, 1989, p. 149. including Satie's conviction of criminal libel for sending insulting postcards to a critic, from which he narrowly escaped imprisonment; his bitter estrangement from longtime friend Claude Debussy, and Debussy's subsequent death; and completion of the work he believed represented the best of himself, the \\"symphonic drama\\" Socrate (1918). Ridiculed by the French press and dogged by chronic poverty, Satie fell into a depressed state that reached its nadir in August 1918, when he wrote to Valentine Hugo, \\"I shit on Art, it has 'cut me up' too often.\\" Letter to Valentine Hugo, August 23, 1918. Ornella Volta (ed.), \\"Erik Satie: Correspondance presque complete\\", Fayard, Paris, 2003. He then proceeded to break with the Nouveaux jeunes group of musicians he had recently founded, an act that set the stage for their eventual regrouping as Les Six. By the summer of 1919 his creative energies had revived, though his spirits remained hard- bitten and gloomy. \\"I have changed a lot during these last months\\", he mused to singer Paulette Darty. \\"I am becoming very serious...too serious, even.\\" Erik Satie, letter to Paulette Darty dated November 22, 1919, around the time he completed the 5th Nocturne. Quoted in Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 356. Such feelings may have steered him to the nocturne form itself - the province of Chopin,Satie greatly admired Chopin, referring to him as a \\"poet\\" and \\"prodigious creator\\" in his journalistic writings (e.g., his 1922 Vanity Fair article on Stravinsky). Rollo H. Myers, for one, found \\"Chopinesque\\" qualities in the 4th Nocturne (Myers, \\"Erik Satie\\", p. 92). Satie would also have known the Nocturnes of another Chopin fan, Debussy. evocative of the night and usually quiet and introspective - and affected the way the project developed. Composition Satie's notebooks reveal he initially intended to present the Nocturnes with the whimsical literary humor the Parisian public had come to expect from him. The first piece had the working title Faux Nocturne and was accompanied by one of those little stories he seemed to enjoy writing for the pianist's private amusement:Satie manuscript, BNF 9609 (2) pp. 2‚Äì6, Biblioth√®que nationale de France. See Robert Orledge, \\"Appendix: Chronological Catalogue of Satie's Compositions and Research Guide to the Manuscripts\\", published in Dr. Caroline Potter (ed.), \\"Erik Satie: Music, Art and Literature\\", Ashgate Publishing, LTD, 2013, pp. 243-324. > The night is silent > Melancholy is all-pervasive > The will-o'-the-wisp disturbs the peaceful landscape > What a bore! It's an old will-o'-the-wisp > Trust him to come > Let us resume our reverie, if you will Quoted in Olof H√∂jer's notes to \\"Erik > Satie: The Complete Piano Music, Vol. 6\\", Swedish Society Discofil, 1996. But he soon abandoned the text and satirical nomenclature, choosing instead to let the Nocturnes stand as pure music. He also wrote them using conventional bar lines, a practice he had largely eschewed in piano music for nearly 30 years before returning to it ‚Äì perhaps with a dash of irony ‚Äì in the Sonatine bureaucratique. On August 24, 1919, Satie informed Valentine Hugo: \\"I am coming to the end of my Third Nocturne. I am dedicating it to you. The three of them are not at all bad. The first serves as a prelude; the second is shorter and very tender ‚Äì very nocturnal; the third, yours, is a more rapid and dramatic nocturne, a little longer than the first. Between the three of them they form a whole with which I am very pleased ‚Äì though the first is the least good.\\"http://thefrogweb.wordpress.com/2010/04/18/satie1/ Quoted by Robert Orledge in \\"Erik Satie - Six Nocturnes - and a trio of Sevens\\", part of the article \\"Erik Satie: Autour des Nocturnes\\" posted on The Frogweb April 18, 2010. This assessment was premature. Satie was not satisfied with the second Nocturne until the following month, and he continued to tinker with No. 3 until October - by which time he was developing ideas for additional pieces in the series. Nos. 4 and 5 are dated October and November 1919, respectively. Publication and performance A 1920 advertisement for Satie's Nocturnes, including the projected No. 6 which Satie never completed or published. Printing of the Nocturnes was split between two of Satie's regular publishers. Rouart, Lerolle & Cie issued Nos. 1‚Äì3 in late 1919; Nos. 4 and 5 were brought out by the firm E. Demets in 1920. Demets also advertised a sixth Nocturne without a price,http://imslp.org/wiki/File:SIBLEY1802.20119.78d4-39087012833523score.pdf indicating it was a work in progress, but the piece would not appear in the composer's lifetime. Satie dedicated each of the completed five to a patron or proponent of his music: :1. Doux et calme (Soft and Quiet), for Marcelle Meyer :2. Simplement (Simply), for Andr√© SalomonAndr√© Salomon (1881-1944) was a French-Jewish pianist and teacher associated with Satie's music of the World War I era, including performances of the musique d'ameublement (\\"furniture music\\"). He perished in the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz during World War II. See http://data.bnf.fr/15731335/andre_salomon/ :3. Un peu mouvement√© (Somewhat Eventful), for Valentine Hugo :4. = 92 (untitled), for the Countess √âtienne de BeaumontEdith de Beaumont (1877-1952), wife of Count √âtienne de Beaumont, both of whom were among Satie's chief benefactors after World War I. :5. = 60 (untitled), for Madame Georges CocteauEug√©nie Cocteau (1855-1943), Jean Cocteau's mother. The Nocturne No. 1 was premiered by Jane Mortier at the Salle Pleyel in Paris on March 18, 1920; Nos. 1‚Äì3 were performed by Ricardo Vi√±es during an all-Satie concert at the Salle √ârard on June 7, 1920. The fourth Nocturne was not heard until January 4, 1923, when it was played by Jean Wiener at the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es. There is no clear indication of the debut for No. 5; Marcelle Meyer may have performed it in 1921.Orledge, Potter (ed.), \\"Erik Satie: Music, Art and Literature\\", pp. 243-324. Reception The Nocturnes caused no immediate stir, although at the Vi√±es performance Jean Cocteau and Les Six members Darius Milhaud and Louis Durey expressed their enthusiasm.Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 356. Given Satie's reputation as a musical humorist, the audience may have been unsure if it was having its leg pulled.This same concert saw the premiere of Socrate in its version for chamber orchestra, and its second public performance overall. It overshadowed the Nocturnes, though for reasons the composer found unwelcome. Satie was exasperated by critics who, refusing to take him seriously, imagined that Socrate was the driest musical \\"joke\\" he ever perpetrated. See Steven Moore Whiting, \\"Satie the Bohemian: From Cabaret to Concert Hall\\", Oxford University Press, 1999, pp. 557‚Äì559. But they have long been prized by Satie aficionados. John Cage championed them in the United States after World War II, and they inspired choreographer Merce Cunningham's ballet Nocturnes (1956), in which the dances were created using chance procedure.Merce Cunningham Trust website, page devoted to the Nocturnes ballet, http://www.mercecunningham.org. Rollo H. Myers, Satie's first biographer in English (1948), ranked the Nocturnes with a handful of Satie compositions that are \\"outstanding and cannot be ignored by any student of contemporary music.\\" He continued: \\"The Nocturnes are in a sense the natural corollary of Socrate, which preceded them by a year, and are conceived in the same gravely austere mood. The style is chastened, simplified, uncompromising in its rejection of any sensuous appeal, but the music is strangely impressive in its bleakness and almost inhuman detachment.\\"Myers, \\"Erik Satie\\", p. 92. The Nocturnes have never enjoyed the mainstream popularity of the Gymnop√©dies or other Satie piano works, and while they have been recorded by such artists as Aldo Ciccolini, Pascal Rog√© and Jean-Yves Thibaudet, they remain, according to John Keillor's AllMusic review, \\"among the undiscovered masterpieces of the twentieth century.\\"http://www.allmusic.com/composition/nocturnes-5-for-piano- mc0002361883 John Keillor Allmusic review.

Six decades later, musicologist Robert Orledge examined Satie's notebooks from the period and discovered a single full draft of a piano piece, missing only two bars of the left-hand part.Satie manuscript, BNF 9609 (2) pp. 15‚Äì18, Biblioth√®que nationale de France.

The objective of the game is to use a text prompt to prevent a man standing beside a closed door from defecating inappropriately. It was the first title released by the Lee brothers, receiving positive critical reception. Gameplay The game is \\"A Survival Horror Game\\" and is presented in a single room, and features a balding man standing beside a closed door in pajama bottoms and an undershirt. The main objective is to prevent the man from defecating in his pants, and use the toilet behind the door, using a text prompt to enter in commands; the game starts upon the player entering the word \\"play\\". Up to ten achievements may be awarded for players experimenting with different ways for the man to defecate, providing incentive for outcomes other than the main objective. Development Don't Shit Your Pants was the first title that the Lee brothers released on the internet, as well as the first release by their company, Decade Studios, before they changed the name to Cellar Door Games. Kenny Lee explained that he had only started developing games seriously around the time of its release, although he had toyed with the concept for a while. The two were the sole developers of the game upon its creation; after receiving \\"incredible feedback\\" on it, however, the team soon grew to several developers, with one of the other individuals working on sound and design for DSYP. Meanwhile, Kenny Lee was responsible for the game's programming and art. The game, programmed in Adobe Flash, was originally developed with just a text display, but Lee decided to make it \\"a Hugo['s] House of Horrors-type game\\" with primitive graphics as well as text. Elaborating on the art style of the game, Kenny Lee said he was inspired by adventure games produced in the Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) display standard. He encountered difficulty emulating the 16-color palette due to newer applications enforcing visual improvements, such as anti-aliasing and a widened color palette, by default; because of this, he had to use Deluxe Paint, an older graphics application, in order to force the limited palette and screen resolution. Lee also stated that he had no prior experience in visual arts. Regarding its premise, Lee explained that it came from an email that made him \\"laugh out [loud] at work.\\" The protagonist, intentionally left nameless, was not based on anyone in particular, but Lee based the design on Guybrush Threepwood from the Monkey Island series since he could not draw a completely original character design. Production of the game took about two weeks; Lee commented that production time could have been shorter, but he had no prior experience with ActionScript, and the game could only be worked on during evenings. Its title was the only one ever worked with; Lee said that, while they had reservations about not changing it, the team decided to keep it the same as \\"the vulgarity would get people to click it\\". He added that, despite the name, they wanted to \\"keep it as clean as possible\\", in particular minimizing the display of excrement. Release and reception The game was released onto the internet as freeware on February 16, 2009. DSYP was jokingly categorized as \\"survival horror\\" by co-developer Teddy Lee. It has since received popularity for its subject matter; Andrew Groen of The Penny Arcade Report called it the company's tour de force. Writing for Esquire, Ben Collins called it \\"best video game in existence\\" and \\"much more difficult than it sounds\\" while on the topic of an interview with Jennifer Lawrence on the Late Show with David Letterman. Owen Good of Kotaku opined that it had \\"surprisingly strong replay value\\" despite its premise. IndieGames.com placed it third of the \\"best freeware experimental games\\" of 2009. John Walker of Rock, Paper, Shotgun called it \\"the sort of immature 30 seconds of nonsense\\" that only his colleague Sam who referred him to the game could have found. Multiple reviewers for The A.V. Club wrote that it \\"will elicit laughs from anyone still capable of appreciating a quality shit joke\\" and dubbed it \\"a digital companion piece\\" to the book Everyone Poops. Discussing the game during a review of the company's later title, Rogue Legacy, Chris Kohler of Wired felt that DSYP seemed a \\"micro-sized game\\" at first, but found that \\"through cleverly encouraging repeated replays, it provides more entertainment than a game of its scope otherwise would.\\" References External links * Don't Shit Your Pants on Kongregate * Don't Shit Your Pants on Newgrounds Category:2000s interactive fiction Category:2009 video games Category:Browser games Category:Flash games Category:Freeware games Category:Indie video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in Canada Category:Works about feces ","title":"Don't Shit Your Pants"},{"id":"43616971","title":"Nantenaina Ramalalaharivololona"},{"id":"43617000","text":"\\"I'm a Freak\\" is a 2014 song by Enrique Iglesias featuring Pitbull Music * I'm a Freak, album by DJ Pierre 2003 =Songs= * \\"I'm a Freak\\", song by DJ Pierre 2003 * \\"I'm a Freak\\", song by Yelawolf 2010 * \\"I'm a Freak\\", song by Fukkk Offf from Love Me Hate Me Kiss Me Kill Me 2009 ","title":"I'm a Freak (disambiguation)"},{"id":"43617005","text":"The Parisian Macao () is a luxury hotel in Cotai, Macau, China owned by Las Vegas Sands, which has a half-scale Eiffel Tower as one its landmarks.

The federation was active between 1931 and 1937 and between 1944 and 1948. It organized a variant of activities in various sports, mostly in football, Boxing and Weightlifting. History Sporting events among the Arab populace of Ottoman Palestine started at the beginning of the 20th century. The first Arab football club, St. George School was established in 1908, and in 1911 a social athletic club, Circle Sportive (al-Muntada al- Riyadi) was established in Jerusalem's Old City, which organized several events, including a 1,800 meter street race in Jerusalem. After World War I, further clubs were established in Jerusalem, Jaffa, Gaza and Haifa, as well as in Arab villages throughout the country, numbering at about 20 around 1930 In 1928, the Palestine Football Federation was established. This governing body was initiated by the Jewish clubs, and later turned into the Israel Football Association. The dominance of the Jewish clubs in the PFA, and the disenfranchisement of the Arab clubs led the Arab clubs to establish its own organization. In March 1931 a national Arab-Palestinian football team was organized to meet a visiting team from American University of Beirut, and three months later, at a meeting held in Jaffa, the Arab Palestine Sports Federation was established. In the following years, and until the 1936 revolt, the APSF organized several football tournaments along with the Youth Congress Party, and in 1935 the federation organized a sports festival in Jaffa, in which more than 5,000 athletes competed in track and field events, sword fighting and horseback riding. The existence of the APSF encouraged sport activities among the Arab populace, and led to the establishment of several Arab football clubs. However, due to the revolt, the APSF ceased its activities in late 1937. After the dissolution of the APSF, Arab teams and athletes were forced to arrange activities by themselves. Some football clubs re-joined the Jewish-controlled PFA competitions. However, after a controversial decision which eliminated Shabab al-Arab from the 1942 Palestine Cup competition, Arab clubs once again quit the PFA. In December 1942 a football association was established in Jaffa, and a similar association was formed in Haifa in November 1943. In a meeting in September 1944 in Jaffa, the APSF was re-established. The reborn APSF was divided into six regions ‚Äì Jerusalem, Jaffa, Nablus, Gaza, Galilee and Haifa. By the start of 1945, the APSF had 25 member clubs. The federation arranged a national football league, and a national Arab-Palestinian football team, and tried to set competitions between the national team and nearby national teams. However, as the federation wasn't affiliated to FIFA, as the Jewish PFA was, such arrangements were proved difficult. In 1946, supported by the Lebanese Football Federation and the Egyptian Football Association, the APSF applied for membership in FIFA, however, the bid was rejected due to the existence of PFA, and the lack of willing to accept another member for the same territory. The federation also arranged track and field meets in 1946 and 1947, including a sports exhibition in Jaffa, where several events, including running events (sprints, middle-distance running and relay races), jumping events (long jump, triple jump, high jump and pole vault) and throwing events (shot put, javelin and discus). Cycling, weightlifting, wrestling and boxing events were also organized by the ASPF during these times. By 1948, the APSF membership had risen to 55 clubs, but as the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War progressed, and as the state of Israel was established on most of the territory of Mandatory Palestine, with the West Bank taken by Jordan and the Gaza Strip taken by Egypt, the APSF was disestablished. Palestine Premier League Under the APSF, a national football league was established in 1945. The competition was divided to six regional leagues, which included a top division and lower divisions. The divisions' champions played a play-off competition to set the champions. =League play-off winners= * 1945 Palestine Premier League: Islamic Sport Club Jaffa * 1946 Palestine Premier League: Shabab al-Arab Haifa * 1947 Palestine Premier League: Shabab al-Arab Haifa See also *Sport in Palestine *Football in Palestine References Category:Sports in Mandatory Palestine Category:Sports organizations established in 1931 Category:Organizations disestablished in 1937 Category:Sports organizations established in 1944 Category:Organizations disestablished in 1948 Category:1931 establishments in Mandatory Palestine Category:1944 establishments in Mandatory Palestine Category:Organizations based in Mandatory Palestine ","title":"Arab Palestine Sports Federation"},{"id":"43617263","text":"Alexander Robertson (1772-1841) was a Scottish-American artist.

Archibald and Alexander collaborated on works, like the engravings. With his brother, Archibald, Robertson came to the United States to teach art at the invitation of several wealthy individuals. Archibald arrived in 1791,Kevin J. Avery; Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.) (1 January 2002). American Drawings and Watercolors in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

It was one of the country's first art schools. Their students included John Vanderlyn, Francis Alexander, and, rare for the time, a woman miniaturist named Ann Hall. Alexander taught painting and drawing. The brothers taught art to amateur and professional students with a wide variety of mediums and subjects. Their methods were based upon those taught in European and British art schools at that time. Around 1800 Alexander drew an illustration of Mount Vernon in Virginia, home of George Washington. This work was engraved by Francis Jukes of London shortly thereafter. Mount Vernon Hand coloured engraving Alexander Robertson Mount Vernon, after Alexander Robertson, aquatint by Francis Jukes, circa 1800 Robertson opened his own art school in 1802. The Columbian Academy of Art was renamed the Academy of Painting, which continued to be managed by Archibald. Robertson exhibited at the American Academy of the Fine Arts (AAFA) in New York and was made director in 1816. Both of the Robertson brothers were active in the management of the AAFA. From 1817 to 1825 Alexander was the school's secretary. He was the curator from 1820 to 1835. In 1821 he became an honorary member of the Academy of Fine Arts in South Carolina. Robertson traveled along the Mohawk and Hudson rivers and captured the landscape and towns in a travel sketchbook of pen and ink drawings. According to Elizabeth Allen, \\"Robertson's stylized approach reveals a preconceived notion of what a landscape should look like, based upon his exposure to the topographical tradition of Great Britain. It was up to the next generations of American landscape artists to free themselves from the restraints of that tradition to produce drawings that were more spontaneous and more faithful to nature.\\"Elizabeth K.

Early life Tan graduated from CHIJ Saint Nicholas Girls' School and Hwa Chong Junior College. She later graduated from the Nanyang Technological University of Singapore as a civil engineer. Tan was the valedictorian of civil engineering in NTU. She also won the best speaker award in the Dorothy Cheung Debating championship in NTU. She was also trained in vocals and piano (ABRSM grade 8, distinction), and later in music education (Post graduate diploma, distinction; from NIE - National Institute of Education) to teach music. Tan also took contemporary vocal master classes at New York University in 2017. Music career Tan started composing in 2000. Her first composition \\"Dreams\\" won the First Prize in an NUS song writing competition. She has written more than 200 songs to date for corporate companies, wedding couples, government agencies and National day charity projects. She has also performed in more than 800 events. She then released two albums, Tan in Original Love Stories Volume 1 & 2, which compiled the songs she had written, back in 2006 and 2008 respectively. The albums primarily catered to her network of wedding, corporate clients and their friends. In April 2014, Tan was selected as the \\"Kindness Ambassador\\" for The Singapore Kindness Movement. She wrote and sang the theme song titled \\"Kindness is in Me\\" to promote kindness and a more loving and caring society. This song can also be found on YouTube. In August 2014, she continued to lend her creative talents to the community and charity by writing her 4th National Day Song \\"Moments of Love\\". This time she also wrote the script and directed the Music video. The three short stories in the music video depicts the different type of love that we experience in our lives. It serves as motivation to people who are suffering and sends a message that there are people out there who care for them. This video was also well-received and crossed more than 225,000 views within a month of release. The My Singapore Project ended on a high note on 12 August 2014 with a music concert for 3,500 people at The Star Performing Arts Centre with The President of Singapore Tony Tan Keng Yam as the Guest of Honour. This concert was once again presented by CapitaLand Hope Foundation. The project raised more than SGD$200,000 for the 64 charities under President's Challenge 2014. More than 300 students from different schools in Singapore also participated in this project.

As part of SG50 (Singapore's 50th golden jubilee celebrations), Tan wrote \\"Snow Flower\\" as a tribute to the country's 50 years of dreams, aspirations and resilience. The song was inspired by Lee Kuan Yew - Singapore's founding Prime Minister. Lee died on 23 March 2015 at age 92. The music, words and images are a metaphorical interpretation of how Singapore (akin to a fragile flower), survived and thrived in difficult and seeming impossible circumstances (akin to wintry snow). The official beneficiary of My Singapore 2015 is Beyond Social Services, whose mission is to curb delinquency among children and youths from less privileged backgrounds.

Due to its location and shape, it is one of the most recognizable features of the Ljubljana Basin and it is visited each year by thousands of hikers. In the 1970s, the Yugoslav People's Army closed the summit to the public and built a radio center there. Since 1991, the summit has been open again to visitors, and there is also a small mountain lodge. Name Mount Krim was attested in written sources in 1689 as Khorim and Korin, and in 1726 as Kurin. The name is derived from the present passive participle *kurim—ä 'smoking', referring to the clouds that often obscure the summit. History Although Mount Krim is a prominent feature against the Ljubljana Marsh, it did not play a significant role in the past. In 1817, geodesists set up a first-class trigonometric point, numbered 172, on the mountain, which was used as a benchmark coordinate for cadastral measures for Carniola, the Littoral, and Istria. Measurements were taken from 1817 to 1828, and this is commemorated by a bronze memorial plaque on the wall of the mountain lodge.\\"Spominsko obele≈æje geodetski toƒçki na Krimu.\\" 1994. Na≈°a komuna 32(18/19): 3. During the Second World War, Mount Krim and its surroundings served as a haven for Partisan units because of its challenging terrain and extensive forests. In 1942, Krvavice Partisan Hospital was established below Mount Krim, near the I≈°ka Gorge.Planina, France. 1963. Slovenija in njeni kraji. Ljubljana: Pre≈°ernova dru≈æba, p. 45Jakopiƒç, Albert, & Franc Benedik. 1978. Vodnik po partizanskih poteh. Ljubljana: Borec, p. 62. The development of broadcasting technology made Mount Krim of increasing interest due to its dominant location. In 1971, the Slovenian broadcaster RTV started building a transmitter on the mountain in order to provide television coverage to an area that could not be reached by the transmitters at Mount Krvavec and Ljubljana Castle. The Yugoslav military also took an interest in the location and started building its own facilities at the same time as RTV. The summit of Mount Krim was then closed to hikers and other members of the public, who could go no higher than Mount Krim≈°ƒçek (941 m), also known as Little Mount Krim ().Wester, Jos. 1929. \\"Po malih 'tisoƒçakih' v l. 1928.\\" Planinski vestnik 29(9): 202‚Äì206, p. 203. While it was used by the military, the mountain was an important radio point for the army, serving as a radio and radio-relay point that covered most of Slovenia and also maintained contact with similar points throughout Slovenia and the rest of Yugoslavia. The exterior of the military structure indicates that it was similar to that found at Guslica on Mount Risnjak. In 1991, during Slovenia's Ten-Day War of independence, Slovenian Territorial Defense units sought to force the staff at the facility to surrender, but without success. The structure continued to be used by the Yugoslav military until October 1991, when the Yugoslav People's Army withdrew from Slovenia. After 1991 the summit was again accessible to the public and the military structure is more or less abandoned. Next to it there is a small mountain lodge, which is visited by thousands of hikers every year. Geography In the winter, when the Ljubljana Basin contains much fog and low clouds, outings to Mount Krim are the nearest point offering sunshine. Mount Krim is also referred to as \\"Ljubljana's weatherman\\" () because a cloud obscuring the top of the mountain is said to portend bad weather for the surrounding region.Krim Mountain Lodge The summit offers a good view of the Ljubljana Marsh, the Karawanks, the Kamnik‚ÄìSavinja Alps, and part of the Julian Alps.

Excerpt from the cantata Quietatevi pensieri by Carlo Caproli Life =Early life and career= Carlo Caproli was born in Rome. His father (originally from Poli) was a seller of green vegetables (erbarolo).His father's occupation is recorded in the 1625 register of the parish of San Eustachio (Caluori 2001). He was recorded as Carlo del Violino in 1636, when he was engaged by the Barberini family for performances of Santa Teodora (with a text by Giulio RospigliosiBianconi & Murata 2001.). Caproli was considered to be a maestro di cappella beginning in 1638, and was in charge of the music for the festival of the patron saint of San Girolamo degli Schiavoni up to 1643. He was an organist under Giacomo Carissimi at the Collegio Germanico beginning in September 1643 and held the post until 1645. On 15 November 1644 he was appointed aiutante di camera under Cardinal Camillo Pamphili, but left that position in April 1647. He first appeared at San Luigi dei Francesi on 25 August 1652 as a violinist hired for the occasion. Caproli's wife was related to the Roman publisher . =Paris= In November 1653, Caproli and his wife went to Paris, where he was commissioned by Cardinal Mazarin to compose the opera Le nozze di Peleo e di Theti (music lost) with an Italian libretto by Mazarin and Francesco Buti. The premiere, which included ballet interm√®des with a French text by Isaac de Benserade and music by uncredited French composers, was given on 14 April 1654 at the Th√©√¢tre du Petit-Bourbon with decors by Giacomo Torelli. The 15-year-old King Louis XIV appeared in no fewer than six roles. The production received nine performances, the final two open to the public, and it was considered a great success, although this was primarily due to the French ballets in the intervals.Bjurstrom 1962, p. 128. For his efforts, Caproli was made ma√Ætre de la musique du cabinet du Roy, which suggests he may have directed the performances. =Later career in Rome= Caproli returned to Rome in 1655. He again directed the music for the festival of San Girolamo and, as one of the best violinists in the city, made numerous appearances, including at San Luigi dei Francesi, Santa Maria Maggiore, and Santa Maria del Popolo, where he played for the Vespers of 8 September. In 1665 he took up the post of guardiano of the instrumentalists at the Congregazione dei Musici di Roma (later the Accademia di Santa Cecilia). He composed numerous solo and ensemble cantatas, many with instruments, and several oratorios. Caproli died in Rome just before 20 December 1668, the day on which his will was opened.

It connects Homburg on the Mannheim‚ÄìSaarbr√ºcken railway (historically called the Pf√§lzische Ludwigsbahn‚Äî Palatine Ludwig Railway) and Neunkirchen on the Nahe Valley Railway (Nahetalbahn). Historically, the Homburg‚ÄìBexbach section was in Bavaria and was built as part of the Palatine Ludwig Railway. The Wellesweiler‚Äì Neunkirchen section was built as part of the Neunkirchen‚ÄìNeunkirchen-Heinitz railway, which served collieries in an area that was then part of Prussia. Route The Palatine Ludwig Railway divides into two branches in Homburg Hauptbahnhof. Originally, the route ran to Bexbach, where it connected to the Prussian colliery branch line to Neunkirchen, which was later connected to the Nahe Valley Railway. The modern route of the Palatine Ludwig Railway was built in 1866/7 from Homburg to St. Ingbert and extended to Saarbr√ºcken in 1879. History On 10 January 1838, a provisional company was formed to build the line from Rheinschanze (renamed Ludwigshafen in 1865) to Bexbach. On 30 March of that year, the company was formally established as the Bayerische Eisenbahngesellschaft der Pfalz-Rheinschanz-Bexbacher Bahn (Bavarian Railway Company of the Palatine-Rheinschanz‚ÄìBexbach Railway). In May 1844, the company was finally renamed as the Palatine Ludwig Railway Company. From the end of March 1845, the construction of the line was directed by Paul Camille von Denis, at that time one of the leading pioneers of Germany's railways. It served primarily as a means for transporting Saar coal from the Bexbach area for the Bavarian government to the port and trading centre of Rheinschanze. The line was named after the Bavarian King Ludwig I. In addition, it was agreed to connect Rheinschanze to the Bavarian Rhine district, by means of a branch from the line at Schifferstadt to Speyer. The section from Homburg to Bexbach, which was located on Bavarian territory, opened on 6 June 1849. Bexbach station is the oldest, still existing station in the Saarland. The Prussian section of the line from Neunkirchen to Wellesweiler was put into operation on 20 October 1850. In July 1856, the line was duplicated over its entire length between Ludwigshafen and Neunkirchen. After the First World War the Saar came under the administration of the League of Nations. So in 1920, this line came under the administration of the Saar Railway (Saareisenbahn). With the inclusion of the Saar region in the Germany in 1935, the line was taken over by Deutsche Reichsbahn. =Developments after the Second World War (1945)= After the Second World War, the line returned to its own administration, this time called the Railways of the Saarland (Eisenbahnen des Saarlandes, EdS). The EdS was incorporated in Deutsche Bundesbahn in 1957 with the inclusion of the Saarland in the Federal Republic of Germany.

The fort itself was occupied by various branches of the U.S. armed forces for most of the period between 1836 and 1945 and is now a part of the North Carolina Baptist Assembly, a Christian retreat, owned and operated by the Baptist State Convention of NC. It is accessible by the public to a limited extent per the conditions set forth by the Assembly‚Äôs Director. Geography Photo Map of Fort Caswell Historic District Sited on the eastern tip of Oak Island in Brunswick County, NC, the fort juts into the confluence of the Cape Fear River and the Atlantic Ocean. The district's boundaries also extend a little over 1/2 mile south into the Atlantic Ocean and east into the Cape Fear River in recognition of the fort's association with blockade runners during the Civil War and its role in hunting down German submarines during World War II. The rifle range site is located a little over two miles to the west-northwest of the fort in the Town of Caswell Beach. Typical of coastal southeastern North Carolina, the natural topography of the site is flat, roughly ten feet above sea level with a wide sandy beach along its southern boundary. Grass covers most of the area, with Yaupon Holly and Live Oaks trees liberally spread throughout the district.  History Original Entrance to Fort Caswell WW I Battery Caswell Fort Caswell Rifle Range Named after former governor Richard Caswell, the original pentagonal fortification of brick walls and large earthworks was completed in 1836 at a cost of $473,402. With over 61 gun emplacements, it guarded the mouth of the Cape Fear River in defense of Wilmington, then an important port 20 miles upriver and, at the time, the state's largest city. In 1861, it was seized twice by a group called the \\"Cape Fear Minutemen\\", who were subsequently ordered by Governor John Willis Ellis to return it to the keeper of the fort, the only man stationed there by the U.S. Army at the time. When the state finally seceded, the new Confederate Army made it, along with nearby Fort Fisher, one of the most elaborate defensive system in the world at that time. (Fort Fisher guarded the other inlet to the Cape Fear River). This system, along with swift blockade runners, kept Wilmington's port open longer than any other. No fewer than six plans were devised to capture the fort, but its imposing defenses and the Frying Pan Shoals just offshore deterred them; the Union Army then diverted its attention to Fort Fisher. After a massive Union assault captured Fort Fisher on January 15, 1865, orders came to spike Fort Caswell's guns, burn the barracks, and explode the magazines. On January 17, the magazines were ignited, exploding approximately 100,00 pounds of powder (reports at the time state that the blast could be heard as far as 100 miles away in Fayetteville). As a result of the explosion, one whole wall of the fort was destroyed. The loss of the Confederacy's last port was a major factor in Robert E. Lee's decision to surrender at Appomattox The U.S. Army built a full military reservation on the site in the 1890s, complete with coastal artillery batteries, but abandoned it after World War I. Most of the buildings currently extant as well as the sea wall were built during this period. The discontiguous Fort Caswell Rifle Range site is also a World War I addition. From 1937-1941, the fort was unsuccessfully converted into a resort, with the gun emplacements used as swimming pools (two artesian wells produced hot mineral water to fill the pools). In 1941, the Navy purchased the fort for use as an anti-submarine base during World War II. The Baptist State Convention of North Carolina bought the property in 1949 as surplus for $86,000.

Thomas Sedgwick Whalley Life Born at Cambridge, he was the third son of John Whalley, DD, master of Peterhouse, who married the only child of Francis Squire, canon and chancellor of Wells Cathedral; his mother died at Winscombe Court, Somerset, on 14 September 1803, aged 96. He was educated at St. John's College, Cambridge, graduating with a BA in 1767, and an MA in 1774, and about 1770 was ordained in the Church of England. In March 1772 Edmund Keene, bishop of Ely, presented Whalley to the rectory of Hagworthingham in the Lincolnshire fens, considered an unhealthy location; and made it a condition that he should never reside there. For over 50 years the duties were discharged by a curate. About 1825 Whalley built a parsonage-house for the benefice. He was appointed on 22 August 1777 to the prebendal stall of Combe (13) in Wells Cathedral, and retained it until 1826. About 1776 Whalley purchased the centre house in the Crescent at Bath and entertained there and at Langford Court. He associated with the set around Anna, Lady Miller at Bath Easton, and wrote verses for her. Frances Burney described him in her diary as \\"immensely tall, thin and handsome, but affected, delicate, and sentimentally pathetic\\". In the summer of 1783, for financial reasons, he and his wife broke up their establishments in England and went abroad. Langford Court, after being let for many years, was sold in 1804. Whalley spent the spring and winter for a long period in southern France, Italy, Switzerland, and Belgium. At Paris in 1783 his appearance drew from Marie-Antoinette the compliment of \\"Le bel Anglais\\". He often spent the summer at Mendip Lodge (Langford Cottage), on the Mendip hills, where the grounds had grottos and terrace walks. Sarah Siddons visited him there. Whalley was awarded a DD from the University of Edinburgh on 10 July 1808. Next winter he bought a house in Baker Street, London, and for some years lived there in great style. After the peace of 1814 he went abroad again. On his return in 1818 he purchased the centre house in Portland Place, Bath. In 1825 Whalley bought the lease of a house at Clifton, and in 1828 he left England, for the last time. A few weeks after his arrival at La Fl√®che in France he died there of old age, on 3 September 1828, and was buried in the consecrated ground of the Roman Catholic church, a sarcophagus of dark slate with Latin inscription marking the spot. He was a patron of painting; a picture of The Woodman, by Barker of Bath, was painted for him, and, at his request, Sir Thomas Lawrence made a crayon drawing of Cecilia Siddons, his god-daughter. Works Whalley kept journals of his continental experiences. Two volumes were edited in 1863 by Hill Wickham, rector of Horsington. They contain letters from Hester Piozzi, Sarah Siddons, and Anna Seward (lengthy). His other writings included: * Edwy and Edilda [anon.]; a poetic tale in five parts, 1779; republished in 1794, with six engravings by a \\"young lady\\" (the daughter of Lady Langham). * The Castle of Montval, a tragedy in five acts, 1781; 2nd edit., with a dedication to Mrs. Siddons, 1799; it was played at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in 1799. * The Fatal Kiss, a poem [anon.], 1781; in the style of Aphra Behn, according to the Monthly Review. * Verses addressed to Mrs. Siddons on her being engaged at Drury Lane Theatre, 1782. * Mont Blanc, a poem, 1788. * Poems and Translations, circa 1797. This was assigned to him in Literary Memoirs (1798). * Kenneth and Fenella, a legendary tale, 1809. Hannah More was a neighbour in the Mendips. Whalley supported her action over the school at Blagdon in an anonymous pamphlet, Animadversions on the Curate of Blagdon's Three Publications, 1802. Family Whalley married, on 6 January 1774, Elizabeth, only child of Edward Jones of Langford Court in Burrington parish, Somerset, and widow of John Withers Sherwood, with whom he obtained a large fortune. She died on 8 December 1801. In May 1803 he married a Miss Heathcote, a lady of property in Wiltshire; she died at Southbroom House, near Devizes, on 10 or 11 October 1807. In 1813 he married the widow of General Horneck (thought to be Charles Horneck who died at Bath on 8 April 1804). He discovered that she was heavily in debt, and they agreed to separate. She received from Whalley a settlement and a house in Catherine Place, Bath.

He also served as a Chief Vigilance Officer (CVO) at AIIMS, New Delhi from 2012 to 2014. Before that he served in the Government of Haryana from 2005 to 2012. Chaturvedi is a whistleblower of the Haryana Forestry scam case which took place under the regime of Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Kiran Chaudhary. Later on, he was a whistleblower in much bigger scams in the health sector during his tenure as Chief Vigilance Officer of AIIMS. He made a number of major decisions in management of the Corbett Tiger Reserve and undertook various Conservation research projects in the state of Uttarakhand.  Indian Forest Service in Haryana & Haryana Forestry Scam  Sanjiv Chaturvedi is a 1995 batch Electrical Engineer from Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology (NIT Prayagraj) and a 2002 batch Indian Forest Service (IFOS) officer from the Uttarakhand cadre. He served in Haryana Cadre from August 2005 to June 2012, at Kurukshetra, Fatehabad, Jhajjar and Hisar, where he brought to public attention many stances of corruption in mining, licensing, a herbal park, a fake plantation and instances of illicit felling and poaching in protected areas. These cases were collectively known as the Haryana Forestry Scam case, allegedly involving then Haryana Chief Minister Mr. Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Forest Minister Kiran Chaudhary and several other senior politicians and officers. = Kurukshetra = Chaturvedi's first posting was in Kurukshetra, where he registered an FIR against contractors on charges of large scale illicit tree felling and poaching of hog deer in the nearby Saraswati Wildlife Sanctuary. He was reprimanded by the Principal Secretary (Forests), and transferred to Fatehabad on 30 May 2007.In Haryana, you are punished if you fight corruption! The contractors were linked with the Hansi-Butana canal project, and were close to the Chief Minister. In his detailed report, he mentioned serious violations of the Wild Life Protection Act of 1972, Forest Conservation Act of 1980 and violation of various Supreme Court orders in under taking construction work inside a Wildlife Sanctuary, without taking statutory approvals. However, this action of Chaturvedi annoyed the ruling establishment. Later on, an NGO filed the case of these violations before the Supreme Court's Central Empowered Committee, which found all charges of violations as true and the Haryana Government had to deposit a fine of 1 crore rupees. = Fatehabad = In Fatehabad, Chaturvedi found that crores of rupees of public money were spent on a private land in the name of development of a Herbal Park. The land belonged to local Congress strongman Prahlad Singh Gillakhera, who later on became Chief Parliamentary Secretary of Forest after winning the MLA election. Gilakhera was reported to be very close to then Haryana Forest Minister Ms. Kiran Chawdhry, as per media reports. A letter of then PCCF, Haryana, to Chaturvedi in July 2007, noted that the Forest Minister was 'annoyed' because work on the Herbal Park was stopped. Very soon, on 3 August 2007, the Chief Minister of Haryana, Hooda, suspended Chaturvedi without specifying any reason. On 14 September 2007, the Government issued a charge-sheet to dismiss him from service. However, on 3 January 2008, the suspension order was revoked by the President of India Pratibha Patil, who also passed strictures against the Hooda Government. Even after this, the Hooda Government did not withdraw the charge-sheet against Chaturvedi; its forest minister Kiran Choudhry returned the file for further comments. The Hooda Government blocked his promotion by keeping the charge-sheet pending for more than three years.A clean slate for hounded officer Later, the Hooda Government had to pay him compensation and concede in writing that he had been framed wrongly in this case. Soon after his suspension, the matter of corruption in the Herbal Park establishment was brought before the Supreme Court by NGO Ekta Parishad. After that, the Haryana Government had to transfer management of this land to the Haryana Forest Department under section 38 of Indian Forest Act of 1927, through a notification in Year 2009. = Jhajjar = After his suspension order was revoked by the President in January 2008, Chaturvedi was assigned to a non-cadre post. After objections from the Central Administrative Tribunal, he was posted as a divisional forest officer (DFO) in Jhajjar, in January 2009. There, he exposed a fake plantation scam in February. Several crores of rupees of public money had been embezzled in this scam. The expos√© resulted in charge-sheets against 40 forest staffers and suspension of 10 staffers. Chaturvedi suspected that senior officers were involved in this multi-crore scam, and requested a vigilance probe. Subsequently, Chaturvedi started facing harassment in form of bogus cases. In year 2012, the Hooda Government issued a departmental charge-sheet to Chaturvedi regarding so-called negligence in maintenance of some plantation works about which he had exposed fake plantation scam. This departmental charge-sheet was finally quashed by the President of India in October 2013, terming it 'unsustainable' Later on, OSD of Haryana Chief Minister was found to be involved in this case, as per enquiry conducted by a two-member enquiry committee of the Central Government. = Hisar = In August 2009, the Haryana Chief Minister's Office abruptly transferred Chaturvedi to the Hisar (territorial) Division. In Hisar, Chaturvedi exposed yet another fake plantation scam. In January 2010, he sealed a plywood unit for corruption. In collusion with senior forest officers, this unit had paid just ‚Çπ26,000 (instead of ‚Çπ2,200,000) as license fee. In May 2010, when Chaturvedi went on official training in a foreign country for 18 days, the Chief Minister's Office declared his post vacant. Chaturvedi was left without a post for a month, after which he was made DFO (Production) in the same Division.Why Is Hooda Afraid of the CBI?  Harassment and presidential intervention  Chaturvedi reported facing severe harassment after exposing multiple scams. Several bogus criminal cases were filed against him, including theft of a Kachnar tree and abetment to suicide (see Sanjeev Tomar case below). During his tenure as an officer in Haryana, Chaturvedi was transferred 12 times in five years. Alleging that he was being harassed by the Haryana State Government, Chaturvedi requested for Central Government deputation in 2010. He complained of harassment to the President Pratibha Patil, who referred his case to the Cabinet Secretariat. Acting on the directions of the Cabinet Secretariat, the Ministry of Environment and Forests constituted a two-member panel to study the accusations, in 2010. The Ministry's in-house inquiry found merit in Chaturvedi's allegations, and referred the case to CBI, whose preliminary analysis found the allegations worthy of investigation. The Ministry then referred the case to Central Vigilance Commission (CVC), and recommended a CBI investigation. The Enquiry Committee Report indicted Chief Minister's Office, then Forest Minister and around half a dozen senior bureaucrats for their alleged involvement in the corruption cases exposed by Chaturvedi and his harassment.and then Zero grading was awarded and integrity was declared doubtful (without citing any specific misdemeanor at all). The Ministry also confirmed the harassment of Chaturvedi and recommended quashing of cases against him. Accordingly, the charge-sheet against him was quashed by the President on 19 January 2011. The President's order indicted the Haryana State government for harassing Chaturvedi by blocking his promotion and transferring him. This was based on the panel report which reprimanded minister Kiran Choudhry, the Chief Minister's Officer on Special Duty R. R. Beri as well as Prahalad Singh Gillakhera, Chief Parliamentary Secretary.Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda may face CBI heat over forest scams The Hooda Government rejected the Ministry's findings, and asked it to take a fresh look at the case. However, this demand was rejected by the Central Ministry of Environment & Forests. Subsequently, in March 2013, the Hooda Government constituted an inquiry committee against Chaturvedi, accusing him of inefficiency. The committee recommended penalizing Chaturvedi, including his termination from the service. In October 2013, the President of India Pranab Mukherjee quashed this charge-sheet, again passing strictures against Government of Haryana. After this, the Hooda Government tried to downgrade appraisal report of Chaturvedi, however, this order of Hooda Government was again reversed by President of India which restored his gradings as outstanding.President reverses Haryana decision on IFS officer‚Äôs ACR Overall between 2008 and 2014, the President of India passed four orders in support of Chaturvedi and quashing Hooda Government's orders. = Relieving From Haryana = In May 2012, Chaturvedi was selected by Central Government, to work as Deputy Secretary, in All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, under Union Health Ministry, on deputation basis. However, Hooda Government of Haryana, refused to relieve him, even after repeated requests of Health Ministry and Ministry of Environment and Forest of Central Government. Chaturvedi again approached Chandigarh Bench of Central Administrative Tribunal, in June 2012, which ordered that the post of Deputy Secretary, will not be filled by any other officer till final orders of Tribunal. A few days later, on 29 June 2012, Central Government directly relieved Chaturvedi, overruling objections of Hooda Government, on this issue, which was an unprecedented development, where Central Government had overruled a State Government, ordering direct relieving of an officer. Hooda Government was citing pendency of Rampal Tomar (see below) case to prevent relieving of Chaturvedi. = Supreme Court Case = In March 2012, Central Government, on the basis of report of CVC and CBI asked Haryana Government to issue notification for CBI investigation of the cases detected by the officer. \\"The matter was examined and the commission sought the opinion of the CBI on the same. The CBI has now confirmed that the issues raised by Sanjiv Chaturvedi are worthy of an independent probe. The CBI can take up the probe of such matters when notifications are issued u/ s 5& 6 of DSPE Act, 1946 by both the central and state governments\\" Lila Chandran, Deputy Secretary of Central Vigilance Commission. However, Haryana Government refused to issue notification for CBI investigation.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Centre-asks-Haryana-to- get-forestry-scam-probed-by-CBI/articleshow/12140420.cms After this Chaturvedi moved himself directly a writ petition before Supreme Court for CBI investigation which issued notices to Central Government, CBI and Haryana Government in November 2012. In October 2014 CBI in its affidavit before Supreme Court expressed its willingness and support for CBI investigation into the cases exposed by the officer.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Ready-to-probe-Haryana- forest-scams-CBI-to-SC/articleshow/44864240.cms Meanwhile, in April 2014 Haryana Government moved a writ petition before Punjab & Haryana High Court against Central Government demanding the quashing of orders of constitution of two member inquiry committee and all subsequent orders.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Haryana-whistleblower-case- Its-Congress-vs-Congress-in-court/articleshow/31816306.cms Both these cases are still sub-judice. In the hearing going on in the Supreme Court, of the corruption cases exposed by Chaturvedi, two Supreme Court judges have recused themselves, till now and hearing has entered into fifth year.https://thewire.in/126935/corruption-haryana-government-sanjiv- chaturvedi/ In February 2018, Punjab and Haryana High Court ordered a fine of Rs. 50,000/- on Sanjiv Chaturvedi, saying that he had not filed reply to ongoing writ petition. This order was set aside by Supreme Court bench headed by Chief Justice Deepak Misra on 19 February 2018. Central Government in a significant affidavit before Punjab and Haryana High Court in February 2018 said that even when All India Services officers are working in State Governments, all the disciplinary powers with respect to them lies in Central Government. In August 2019, Punjab and Haryana High Court passed an order, that the case filed by Government of Haryana challenging inquiry panel constituted by Central Government, was not maintainable before it in view of Article 131 of Constitution of India, under Article 131 of Constitution of India disputes between Central and State Governments can be heard only by Supreme Court, under its original jurisdiction. The court also noted that the case filed by Government of Haryana had similar issues as the one filed by Sanjiv Chaturvedi before Supreme Court in year 2012. This order came as a relief for Sanjiv Chaturvedi. Missing File from Chief Minister Office Another controversy broke out in June 2018 when an official in Secretariat of Forest Branch of Haryana Government lodged a police complaint against Chief Minister, for disappearance of file noting and important documents related to case of Chaturvedi, after the file was received back from Chief Minister Office. Haryana Government immediately transferred the Secretariat Official who had lodged complaint against Chief Minister. Meanwhile, Chaturvedi threatened to approach the High Court if action is not taken against the culprits responsible for disappearance of important documents from file. Later on it was also reported that despite opinion of Advocate General, for withdrawal of case against Chaturvedi in High Court, Haryana Government was contesting it for more than two years. = Sanjeev Tomar case = In December 2009, Sanjeev Tomar, a Haryana forest range officer, was found dead after initiation of anti-corruption proceedings against him by Sanjiv Chaturvedi. His father Rampal Singh Tomar initially told the police that Sanjeev had died due to other reasons. Later, he changed his statement and claimed that his son had committed suicide due to harassment by Chaturvedi and subsequent suspension. According to the Jhajjar Superintendent of Police, Chaturvedi had nothing to do with suicide of Tomar, who was disturbed due to corruption and dowry cases against him. Multiple special investigation teams (SIT) formed to probe the case gave a clean chit to Chaturvedi. According to the SIT reports, Sanjeev Tomar had committed suicide because of an anti-corruption inquiry against him and also because he was facing litigation from his wife; he had been living with another woman named Promila. In February 2015, the Punjab and Haryana High Court recommended formation of a new SIT to probe the allegations that Sanjeev Tomar had committed suicide due to harassment by Chaturvedi. This was based on a petition filed by the deceased's father, Rampal Singh Tomar. Chaturvedi moved in a review petition before the Court, challenging the orders to form an SIT. Chaturvedi's counsel had argued that the case had already been investigated by four different SITs and reviewed by senior police officers, who had found no evidence of harassment. He stated that constituting a fresh SIT would amount to hounding the officer who had exposed several scams. In April 2015, the Court accepted the petition, and recalled its earlier order. The Court also dismissed the writ petition of Rampal Singh. = Intelligence Bureau Report = The Intelligence Bureau (IB) had prepared a report on alleged threats and harassment to Chaturvedi. When the copy of this report was sought by him under RTI Act, intelligence bureau denied it on the ground that IB is an exempted organization under section 24 of RTI Act, 2005. However, somehow the gist of the report was disclosed in which contentions of Chaturvedi were found to be true. Subsequently, Central Information Commission in a very detailed order in April 2016 slammed Intelligence Bureau and citing four extra ordinary presidential orders passed in his favor, asked them to disclose the report to Chaturvedi.Give Sanjiv Chaturvedi copy of IB report, rules CIC This decision of CIC was challenged by Intelligence Bureau in June 2016 before Delhi High Court which had granted stay and issued notices to the officer. The hearing was concluded in May 2017 and final judgment was passed in August 2017, in which Delhi High Court upheld the orders of CIC and dismissed the writ petition of Intelligence Bureau, thereby paving way for the access of the officer to the confidential IB report. The Court held that under provisions of RTI Act issues of corruption and human right violation are not exempt from disclosure even for organizations like IB which are otherwise exempted from disclosure provisions of RTI Act.https://thewire.in/171687/whistleblower-ifs-officer-sanjiv-chaturvedi- report/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ib-files-on-graft-can-be- disclosed-under-rti-hc/articleshow/60240234.cms  AIIMS (Delhi) Scam whistle- blower case  On 29 June 2012, Chaturvedi was made the Deputy Secretary of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi. He was given the charge of Chief Vigilance Officer (CVO) at AIIMS. As a CVO, Chaturvedi took action in a very large number of cases which included action against a private chemist shop selling counterfeit medicines, financial irregularities in 3850 crore construction projects and particularly extension to head of engineering wing, corruption in recruitment, purchase of medical equipment, against the doctors who were making unauthorized foreign trips, in contracts to security companies, single bid tendering, corruption in computerization purchases, treatment of pet dog of officers at institute cases of subletting, pension fund scam and even sexual harassment. During his tenure, the police seized banned drugs worth 6 crores from a vehicle supplying drugs to an on-campus pharmacy owned by an Indian National Congress MLA. The then health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, signed two internal reports which rated Chaturvedi's work as a CVO as \\"outstanding\\". Chaturvedi initiated actions in around 200 corruption cases during his stint as AIIMS CVO; punishment was imposed in 78 cases, charge-sheet was issued in 87 cases and more than 20 cases were referred to CBI for criminal investigation. These cases included the ones against senior IAS officer Vineet Chawdhry, of Himachal Pradesh cadre, who had worked earlier as Deputy. Director (Administration) former Deputy Director (Administration) Shailesh Yadav, a senior IPS officer, many senior faculty members, former Registrar V.P. Gupta and former Chief Administrative Officer Attar Singh.Nadda ‚ÄòProtecting the Corrupt‚Äô, AIIMS Whistleblower Tells Tribunal Subsequently, on many investigations done by Chaturvedi, CBI registered cases and recommended action against Vineet Chawdhry. As per India Today investigative report of June 2017, J P Nadda, Union Health Minister was found to have hushed up investigation into what the report termed as 7000 crore scam, detailing CBI report and scathing reports of Parliamentary Committee. Opposition parties on basis of this investigative report and documents mentioned in the report, accusing Nadda of links with senior IAS officer Vineet Chawdhry who had earlier worked with Nadda in Himachal Pradesh. Similarly, in October 2015, CBI, on basis of enquiry done by Chaturvedi, found then AIIMS Director, Dr. M C Mishra, and certain other AIIMS officials including store officer guilty of involvement in corruption in purchase of medical items including disinfectants in trauma centre, on basis of wrong propriety certificate and recommended action against them to Health Ministry, as deemed fit. Again, in January 2018 CBI registered criminal case under sections of forgery and Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 against certain AIIMS officials for corruption in purchase in Surgery Department, to favour particular firms, on basis of enquiry report sent by Chaturvedi as CVO to CBI in May 2014. Earlier in September 2013, CBI had registered a criminal case on basis of enquiry done by Vigilance Cell of AIIMS, regarding large scale fake payments made in security wing of AIIMS and financial irregularities into security contract award to a private company. However, it was found later on that all the major corruption cases exposed and being investigated by Chaturvedi, involving senior IAS, IPS officers, AIIMS Director and senior AIIMS officials were being hushed up after his removal and taking over of Health Ministry by J P Nadda. In August 2014, Chaturvedi was relieved from the charge of CVO. On 16 August, he wrote a letter to the new health minister Harsh Vardhan of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), alleging that his removal from the CVO post was a result of campaign by corrupt officials. He was supported by AIIMS staff, who wrote a letter to the Prime Minister asking for his reinstatement. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) held protests in his support. The media and the AAP alleged that the BJP leader JP Nadda was acting against Chaturvedi on behalf of Vineet Chaudhary, an IAS officer from his own state, Himachal Pradesh. As a CVO, Chaturvedi had accused Chaudhary of bending rules to give tenure extension to an engineer supervising works worth 3,700 crores. Nadda had reportedly started the proposal for removal of Chaturvedi with a letter, on which 20 signatures were added within 24 hours. Chaturvedi had also accused two security contractor firms of serious violations, one of which was owned by the BJP Rajya Sabha MP RK Sinha. Harsh Vardhan stated that Chaturvedi had been removed because was not eligible for the CVO post, and the government had no malafide intention in the decision. However, media reports brought out documents showing that not only J. P. Nadda had repeatedly written letters for removal of Chaturvedi but had also demanded halt of all corruption cases investigated by Chaturvedi. Media reports also showed documents regarding meeting of Nadda with then Health minister Dr. Harshvardhan for pressing this demand. Reportedly Nadda wrote four letters between May 2013 to June 2014, for removal of Chaturvedi and while his earlier letters were not acted upon, prompt action was taken with change of Government.AIIMS whistle-blower removed at BJP leader Nadda's behestNadda wanted corruption inquiries to be put on hold Media reports also brought out records related to earlier attempts to remove Chaturvedi, in spite of fact that, Union Health Secretary as well as CVO of Health Ministry, in their report in May 2014, had termed his performance as 'exemplary' and integrity as 'absolute'. However, it was because of intervention of parliamentary Committee, which had taken prior commitment from Government regarding appointment of Chaturvedi as CVO, that he was saved. Prime Minister Office had also directed Cabinet Secretary for his protection, so that he should not be removed without matter being brought in Civil Services Board and Prime Minister office kept under information. After Chaturvedi's controversial removal, Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked Harsh Vardhan for a report on the case. In the resulting report, the Health Secretary Luv Verma argued that AIIMS did not have any independent post of CVO, and Chaturvedi had been given only additional charge as an \\"internal arrangement.\\" The newspapers DNA such as The Economic Times alleged that several facts about Chaturvedi's appointment and removal were concealed from the Prime Minister in this report and that he was given main charge of CVO as per AIIMS order dated 07.07.2012 and not the Additional Charge as claimed by Health Secretary in report sent to Prime Minister.Narendra Modi misled on AIIMS CVO Sanjiv Chaturvedi's removal? Subsequently, JP Nadda became the Health Minister in November 2014. Nadda's ministry attempted to re-write Chaturvedi's Appraisal Report, which had described his performance as outstanding. However, in June 2015, the Central Administrative Tribunal restrained Nadda from doing this.Tribunal Restrains Nadda From Rewriting Whistleblower Chaturvedi‚Äôs Appraisal In June 2015, Chaturvedi petitioned the Central Administrative Tribunal to grant him promotion to Director (selection grade), which he had been scheduled to receive in January, but which had been blocked due to his anti-corruption stance. Following a court order, Chaturvedi received his promotion with effect from 1 January. In August 2015, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare accused the Health Ministry of not taking any action against the corruption in AIIMS. It also criticized the replacement of the dedicated CVO post with a Ministry CVO.Health Ministry not serious about tackling corruption cases in AIIMS: House panel The same month, Chaturvedi stated that he was disappointed with the Modi government for not taking any action in these corruption cases.‚ÄòZero Tolerance For Honesty In This Govt‚Äô By December 2015, all the tasks assigned to Chaturvedi at AIIMS had been withdrawn without mentioning any specific reasons by the Central Government, although he was being paid the full salary. In July 2016, Chaturvedi filed an affidavit before the Delhi High Court, alleging that the Ministry had not taken any action against the accused in the pending AIIMS corruption cases exposed by him. Despite having been stripped of his duties during the 2015‚Äì2016 fiscal year, a move that he challenged in the Supreme Court, Chaturvedi received an \\"unsatisfactory\\" performance evaluation. = Support of AIIMS, faculty members, students and staff = After removal of Chaturvedi, AIIMS Faculty Members protested and launched a signature campaign to bring him back. Around 250 faculty members and researchers wrote to Prime Minister Modi to bring him back as CVO. They also demanded inquiry into his removal. Chaturvedi also got tremendous support from AIIMS Student Union and employees who similarly demanded his come back. = Public interest litigation = In February 2015, the Delhi High Court issued notices to the Central Government and then Union Health Minister, J.P Nadda in response to a PIL filed by Prashant Bhushan demanding CBI investigation into all pending corruption cases and removal of Chaturvedi as CVO. Delhi High Court has sought status report from CBI on the corruption cases exposed by Chaturvedi.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/File-status-report- on-AIIMS-related-graft-cases-HC-to-CBI/articleshow/54584712.cms The matter is still sub-judice before Delhi High Court. In major setback to Central Government, in April 2018, Delhi High Court issued notices to Central Government, seeking their reply on wrong closure of corruption cases by Health Ministry headed by Mr. Nadda while hearing this PIL.  Conflict with Central Vigilance Commissioner  As per reports published in Wire and other publications, Chaturvedi wrote to President of India in July 2017 for suspension and inquiry by a Supreme Court judge against Central Vigilance Commissioner, Mr. K.V Chaudhary, under powers given to President in Section 6 of CVC Act, 2003, citing a number of CBI reports which had recommended action against certain highly placed officials and faculty members of AIIMS, on corruption charges but which were closed by Chaudhary, over ruling CBI. Chaturvedi further alleged that apart from over ruling CBI investigation reports and their recommendations, CVC also did not take approval of competent disciplinary authority while closing these cases. In response to RTI Application of Chaturvedi, regarding action taken on his complaint to President against CVC, Department of Personnel and Training (DoP&T;) of Central Government, which is administrative department of CVC, intimated that at present there are no guidelines to deal with complaints against CVC and the same is being framed and complaint would be processed once guidelines are framed. This response of Central Government assumed significance in view of controversy related to CBI Director and his investigation by CVC. In January 2019, again the Central Government reiterated same stand that guidelines to handle the complaint, are being framed and complaint will be processed only after guidelines are framed. This stand of Central Government drew very sharp criticism from main opposition party which alleged that the Central Government is taking shelter behind technicalities to justify inaction against present CVC Mr. K.V Chauhdary.  Zero appraisal report  Sanjiv Chaturvedi was awarded effectively zero grading in his Annual Performance Report (APAR) in the financial year 2015-16 by Mr. J.P Nadda, Union Health Minister and his sub-ordinate officers. This was in the same year in which Chaturvedi was conferred prestigious Ramon Magsaysay Award. It was reported in media that all his previous Appraisal Reports were Outstanding and even Union Health Secretary had appreciated his performance as Exemplary in year 2014.http://indianexpress.com/article/india/centres-appraisal-rating-for- magsaysay-award-winning-civil-servant-zero-sanjiv-chaturvedi-4525448/ Prior to that, Central Government had already withdrawn all works from him, against which the officer had moved to Supreme Court, which had issued notices to Central Government in September 2016, admitting his appeal. In March 2017, Intelligence Bureau in its report termed Chaturvedi as a 'diligent officer'.http://indianexpress.com/article/india/punjab-centres-rating-for- magsaysay-award-winner-zero-ib-says-diligent-officer-4594621/ Within 4 months of this Zero rating, BJP Government of Uttarakhand again gave him Outstanding grading for financial year 2016-17.http://indianexpress.com/article/india/rated-zero-by-centre-forest- officer-outstanding-in-state-4692347/ When Chaturvedi moved to Uttarakhand High Court in June 2017, against this zero rating, bench led by Chief Justice K.M Joseph, instead of directly entertaining his writ petition, relegated the case to Tribunal.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/ifs-officer- sanjiv-chaturvedi-to-approach-cat-after-hc-relegates- petition/articleshow/59414073.cms This order of Uttarakhand High Court was criticized in legal fraternity as Uttarakhand High Court had entertained several other service matter cases directly before this case.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/hc-relegating- chaturvedis-plea-a-puzzling-decision-say- lawyers/articleshow/59429731.cmshttps://thewire.in/155444/sanjiv-chaturvedi- whistleblower-officer-plea-against-health-minister-jp-nadda/ Matter is now before Tribunal. In a major development Central Administrative Tribunal(CAT) bench of Nainital, rejected the plea of Cabinet Secretary for removal of his name from the case related to zero appraisal report of Chaturvedi. In August 2018, a division bench of Uttarakhand High Court led by Chief Justice termed the attitude of Central Government towards Chaturvedi as 'vindictive' & imposed a cost of Rupees Twenty Five Thousand while quashing orders of Chairman, CAT, New Delhi wherein he had stayed proceedings of Nainital Circuit Bench of CAT on a transfer application filed by Central Government for transfer of case from Nainital Bench to New Delhi Bench regarding zero appraisal case of the officer. In February 2019, in a big setback to the Central Government, Supreme Court of India upheld the judgment of Uttarakhand High Court and imposed a further cost of Rupees Twenty Five Thousand on AIIMS. The Supreme Court laid down an important law point in the case that judicial powers of Chairman of Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) are same as that of other members of the Tribunal and sitting singly, he cannot stay the proceedings of division bench of the Tribunal and therefore, orders of Chairman CAT were unsustainable and without jurisdiction. = Cost on central government and donation to PMNRF. = In June 2019, High Court of Uttarakhand issued notice to Union Health Secretary and Director, AIIMS on issue of non payment of cost of Rupees Twenty Five Thousand imposed by it in a case related to Appraisal Report of Chaturvedi in which High Court had imposed a cost of Rupees Twenty Five Thousand on Central Government and AIIMS, terming their attitude as 'vindictive' for officer. The Central Government, paid this amount to Chaturvedi in July 2019, after issue of contempt notice. However in August 2019, Chaturvedi donated this entire amount to Prime Minister National Relief Fund (PMNRF). In the letter written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chaturvedi expressed surprise as to how public funds can be used in vindictive litigation. He requested Prime Minister to create a special fund for help of honest officers, undergoing similar harassment to fund their legal expenses and to compensate them.  Recusal by judges  As per report published in reputed law web portal 'Livelaw' and some other credible publications, in April 2019, till this date, four judges of various courts have so far recused themselves from various cases of Chaturvedi. The Supreme Court judges Justice Ranjan Gogoi and Justice U.U Lalit, recused themselves from his case filed for investigation into Haryana Forestry Scam in which name of then Haryana Chief Minister had also figured, while a judge of Shimla Court, recused himself in April 2018, from a criminal defamation case filed against Chaturvedi by the then Chief Secretary of Himachal Pradesh, Mr. Vineet Chawdhary. In an order dated 29 March, in 2019, Chairman of Central Administrative Tribunal, Justice L. Narasimha Reddy, recused himself from all cases of Chaturvedi, citing \\"unfortunate developments\\" and terming it as \\"a rare case\\". Before that, he was issued contempt notice by High Court of Uttarakhand, for willful disobedience their order on a petition filed by Chaturvedi before High Court of Uttarakhand. This contempt proceeding was however, stayed by Supreme Court in March 2019.  Involvement of Prime Minister's office  On 10 January 2018, web magazine 'The Wire' broke out a story, citing RTI documents that the Prime Minister Narendra Modi had himself discussed the removal of Chaturvedi with the then Health Minister Dr. Harshvardhan, on 23 August 2014. RTI documents showed that on 23 August 2014, the then Union Health Secretary Mr. Luv Verma had written a letter to the Principle Secretary to Prime Minister, mentioning that Prime Minister had a telephonic conversation with Union Health Minister on that day and therefore, a report is being sent for perusal of Prime Minister. It was not clear as to what was the content of this conversation but after that, Chaturvedi was stripped off all the responsibilities and was awarded zero grading in Appraisal Report besides facing a number of litigations. After the telephonic conversation, Prime Minister Office sought comments/report from Health Ministry on the allegations of Chaturvedi but nothing followed. Earlier also in year 2013 Prime Minister Office had stepped in to resolve his case arising out of sharp differences between Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF) and Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT). In February, 2019, he again wrote to Prime Minister Modi, requesting him to disclose details of his telephonic conversation with then Union Health Minister Dr. Harshvardhan, after which, according to Chaturvedi his harassment and various litigation against him began.  Campaign against black money and corruption  In August 2017, Chaturvedi applied RTI Application to Prime Minister Office, on 16 points which included information on quantum of black money brought back from foreign countries. by Modi Government and the amount of such black money deposited into account of citizens. During 2014 parliamentary elections, it was a major electoral promise of Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) to bring back black money from foreign countries and deposit Rs. 15 Lacs into account of every citizen. Chaturvedi also sought information on corruption complaints against serving central ministers of Modi Government, copy of inquiry report and action taken on these corruption complaints by Prime Minister Modi. In addition, he had also sought information on various flagship schemes of Modi Government. Initially, the Prime Minister Office refused to give information on black money saying that it does not come under the definition of information and regarding corruption complaints against central ministers, PMO said that it was generic information. However, in a major setback to Modi Government Central Information Commission (CIC) in its order passed on 16 October 2018, rejected all these contentions of Prime Minister Office and directed them to provide these information to Chaturvedi within 15 days. However, in its response on 12 November, the Prime Minister Office said that though it had received complaints against various Union Ministers from time to time and which were duly examined also, however, to identify, examine and categorize each of these complaints, maybe \\"cumbersome exercise\\" and such an exercise will \\"disproportionately divert the resources of the office\\" and hence, citing Section 7 (9) of RTI Act, 2005, the details were denied to Chaturvedi. In the same, communication, Prime Minister Office also refused to divulge information about black money brought from abroad, saying that disclosure of this information would affect investigation of SIT into black money and hence, citing Section 8(1)(h) which provides exemption from disclosure of information when investigation is pending and Section 24 of RTI Act provides exemption to certain Intelligence Organizations from RTI Act, the information was denied to Chaturvedi. This denial by PMO particularly on issue of black money created huge uproar with even ally of ruling Bhartiya Janta Party namely, Shiv Sena criticizing the denial in an editorial written in their party's mouth piece 'Samna' saying that with this denial, mystery of black money has deepened further. In an Interview with website Rediff, he termed the fight against corruption as second freedom struggle. His struggle against corruption has been highlighted by various publications from time to time as a case study. In November 2018, Chaturvedi filed a complaint against Prime Minister Office before Central Information Commission under Section 18 of RTI Act for non compliance of its orders. The matter was heard by CIC in April 2019 and June 2019 and in order passed on June 18th, CIC noted the submissions and concluded that ground taken by Prime Minister Office were not correct as far as not supplying the information related to corruption complaints against Union Ministers was concerned. This was a very significant order from transparency watchdog which paved the way for disclosure of corruption complaints against Union Ministers. However, CIC agreed with contention of Prime Minister Office on the issue of denial of information regarding investigation on black money and said that disclosure of this information would impede investigation and hence the same cannot be given under Section 8(1)(h) of RTI Act. In July 2019 and then in September 2019, Single Bench and then Double Bench of Delhi High Court, dismissed the case filed by Chaturvedi, for getting information on complaints against corruption of Central Ministers and action taken by Prime Minister on these complaints, as well as quantum of black money brought from abroad. As per story published in 'Wire', in October 2019, reading of the word 'disposed' used by the Central Information Commission in its order, as 'dismissed' appeared to have saved the Prime Minister's Office. However, in January 2020, a Division Bench of Supreme Court, hearing Special Leave Petition filed by Chaturvedi, against orders of Delhi High Court, issued notices to Prime Minister Officer on these issues.  Criminal defamation case  A criminal defamation case was filed against Sanjiv Chaturvedi by Mr. Vineet Chawdhary, a senior IAS officer of 1982 batch of Himachal Pradesh cadre in April 2016 in a local court at Shimla it was regarding a confidential letter sent by Chaturvedi in August 2014 to then Chief Secretary of Himachal Pradesh in which Chaturvedi had sent a list of pending departmental and CBI cases/investigations against Vineet Chawdhary. Chawdhary had earlier served as Dy. Director (Administration) in AIIMS, New Delhi from year 2010 to 2012, during which many complaints/allegations were leveled against him regarding financial irregularities and abuse of power. After the lower court issued summons, Chaturvedi approached Shimla High Court for quashing of proceedings on the ground that the information of pending cases was sent by him as part of his duty as Chief Vigilance Officer (CVO) of AIIMS and hence, as per provisions of Section 197 of CrPC, Court could not have issued summons without sanction of prosecution from Central Government. He further claimed that all his investigations were validated by CBI and higher authorities and that Chaudhary had not obtained prior sanction before filing the case. However, Shimla High Court refused to intervene in order passed in April 2018. This order of High Court was challenged by Chaturvedi before Supreme Court, which in its order in May 2018, giving a big relief to Chaturvedi, quashed orders of Himachal Pradesh High Court, saying that it sans reason and asked it to re- hear the case and pass a reasoned order. In another strange development, in April 2018, the lower court judge hearing the case, recused himself from the case citing personal reasons.  Change to Uttarakhand cadre  In October 2012, Chaturvedi had applied for change of his cadre from Haryana to Uttarakhand on the grounds of ‚Äòextreme hardship‚Äô including frequent transfers, suspension and false cases. After the approvals of both the State Government, Ministry of Environment and Forest also recommended for a cadre change in July, 2014, to the Appointment Committee of Cabinet (ACC) headed by the Prime Minister. However, on 28 January 2015, ACC ordered to bring fresh NOC from both the State Governments. This order was challenged by the officer in Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), which first stayed and then quashed this order of ACC in May, 2015, CAT gave two months time to the ACC for passing order on Cadre Change. On 13 August 2015, the ACC led by the Prime Minister approved the Cadre Change of in compliance with Tribunal orders.  Invitation by Delhi Government  In 2015, the media reported that AAP was planning to appoint Chaturvedi as the chief of the Delhi anti-corruption bureau. On 17 February 2015, and again on 28 February 2015, Delhi's Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal wrote to Cabinet Minister of Environment & ForestsPrakash Javdekar, asking for deputation of Chaturvedi to Delhi, as an Officer on Special Duty. The Ministry of Environment and Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) directed the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to give its assent to Chaturvedi's deputation to the Delhi Government. In October 2015, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare also gave consent. Subsequently Government of Uttarakhand, parent cadre, after which courts directed Prime Minister led Appointments Committee of the Cabinet(ACC) to take a decision by 1 May 2016. However, in a very strange development, Government of Uttarakhand suddenly withdrew its consent in January 2016, allegedly under pressure from Central Government. This consent was restored again in February‚ÄìMarch 2016 by Government of Uttarakhand. After this development the court again directed ACC to decide the case expeditiously. However, in July 2016, the Prime Minister led ACC rejected this proposal on the ground that the officer had not completed requisite cooling off period between two deputations. In letter written to Prime Minister in same month Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had pointed out that as per rules, the criteria for a cooling off period is not applicable in case of appointment to personal staff. He also requested Prime Minister to allow this deputation in the interest of people of Delhi.http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/arvind-kejriwal- writes-to-pm-narendra-modi-pressing-for-sanjiv-chaturvedis-posting-as- osd-2907133  As conservator of forest in Uttarakhand  After completing his four-year tenure in AIIMS, New Delhi, Sanjiv Chaturvedi, joined his new cadre of Uttarakhand on 29.08.2016. There he got his due promotion as Conservator of Forest in November 2016.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/In- surprise-move-Ukhand-govt-promotes-whistle-blower-IFS-officer-Sanjiv- Chaturvedi/articleshow/55338528.cms However, the State Government was still confused on his posting and after a three month long wait, he was first ordered to be posted as Officer on Special Duty (OSD) to the Government of Uttarakhand to look after the environmental cases of the State Government in National Green Tribunal (NGT).http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/IFS-officer-Sanjiv- Chaturvedi-gets-Delhi-posting/articleshow/55625693.cms However, within 24 hours the State Government changed its stand and cancelled the Delhi posting order in a press conference called by Chief Minister, Mr. Harish Rawat himself. It was also alleged that this U-turn was under the pressure of Central Government, as similar U-turn was taken by Uttarakhand Government one year back in first giving him NOC for Delhi Deputation in November 2015 and then suddenly withdrawing it in January 2016. In this Press Conference he publicly announced that Chaturvedi would be given a posting of his choice within Uttarakhand. However, when Chaturvedi requested assignment for Anti- Corruption Wing in written, he was shunted to an irrelevant post of Conservator of Forest (Research) on 12 May 2016. This flip flop of the State Government, was criticized by political activist of the Uttarakhand alleging maltreatment of honest officers by the Government.

Champawat forest scam  In September 2017, Chaturvedi was ordered by Uttarakhand Government to inquire into various instances of irregularities into Champawat Forest Division. During his investigation Chaturvedi detected heavy illicit filling Chir pine trees and a multi crore resin scam where money earmarked for resin collection was diverted elsewhere. In the voluminous enquiry report consisting of around 2000 pages, he also pointed out various other irregularities and recommended suspension and vigilance enquiry against the divisional forest officer and his subordinate field staff. on the basis of his enquiry report State Government has initiated process to charge sheet them.

He was a son of Emperor Jing and a half-brother of Emperor Wu. Originally King of Runan, he was awarded the Kingdom of Jiangdu for his role in suppressing the Rebellion of the Seven States. Dong Zhongshu, the prominent Confucian scholar, served as his Prime Minister. Liu Fei's mausoleum has been excavated by archaeologists from the Nanjing Museum, who unearthed numerous artifacts, including 100,000 coins, dozens of chariots, and the only jade coffin to have survived intact in Chinese archaeology. Biography Liu Fei was one of the fourteen sons of Emperor Jing of Han (reigned 157‚Äì141 BCE). With the exception of crown prince Liu Che, who later ascended the throne as Emperor Wu, Emperor Jing created all his other sons kings with their own fiefdoms. Liu Fei was made the King of Runan, with its capital at Shangcai, in modern-day Henan province. His mother was Consort Cheng, a concubine of Emperor Jing, who also gave birth to Liu Yu, Prince of Lu, and Liu Duan, King of Jiaoxi. In 154 BCE, rulers of seven kingdoms, led by Liu Pi, the King of Wu, rebelled against the Han dynasty. Liu Fei, then a strong 15-year-old, volunteered to join the fight against the rebels. Emperor Jing awarded him the seal of the general, and let him lead an army to attack Wu, the main rebel kingdom. The rebellion was suppressed after a few months. The following year, Emperor Jing created the kingdom of Jiangdu in part of the former territory of Wu and made Liu Fei its king. Wu's capital Guangling (present-day Yangzhou, Jiangsu) became the capital of Jiangdu. In addition, he was awarded the banners of the Son of Heaven for his contribution in the suppression of the rebellion. In 129 BCE, during the reign of Emperor Wu, the Xiongnu nomadic empire attacked the Han. Liu Fei volunteered to join the counterattack against Xiongnu, but his request was denied by the emperor. According to the Han historian Sima Qian, Liu Fei built many palaces and towers, and his life \\"was marked by extreme arrogance and luxury\\". He valued physical prowess, and invited strong men to his court from everywhere. He also employed the influential Confucian scholar Dong Zhongshu as his Prime Minister. Death and aftermath Liu Fei died in 128 BCE, after 26 years of reign as King of Jiangdu. He was given the posthumous title King \\"Yi\\" (Êòì), meaning \\"willing to change\\". His son, crown prince Liu Jian, succeeded him as king. Liu Jian was said to lead a debauched life, once having an orgy with ten women above his father's tomb. He also took Lady Nao, his father's favoured concubine famed for her beauty, as his own consort. In 121 BCE, Liu Jian was involved in the plot of rebellion by Liu An, King of Huainan, and Liu Ci, King of Hengshan. After the plot was discovered, all three committed suicide, and their kingdoms were abolished. Jiangdu came under direct imperial rule and was reorganized as Guangling Commandery. Mausoleum Liu Fei's mausoleum has been located in present-day Xuyi County, Jiangsu province. Because it was threatened by quarrying, archaeologists from the Nanjing Museum performed a \\"rescue excavation\\" of the site from 2009 to 2011, and published the excavation report in 2014. The complex includes three major tombs, eleven subsidiary tombs, two horse-and-chariot pits, and two pits for weapons. It is surrounded by an enclosure wall, which was originally long on each side. Although the site has been looted in ancient times, archaeologists still unearthed more than ten thousand artifacts: gold, bronze vessels, weapons, a zither with jade pegs, lamps of various shapes, a silver basin inscribed with the name of the Kingdom of Jiangdu, and a kitchen with food. Other findings include a treasury holding more than 100,000 banliang coins, and dozens of model chariots and several life-sized ones. Liu Fei's coffins were damaged and his body was missing, but fragments of his jade burial suit were found. The most important find was from an adjacent tomb, labeled M2, which contained the only jade coffin known to have survived intact in China. One of the eleven attendant tombs contained items inscribed with the surname Nao (Ê∑ñ). Its occupant was probably related to Liu Fei's consort Lady Nao.

History  tado¬∞ was founded in 2011 by Johannes Schwarz, Christian Deilmann, and Valentin Sawadski. The company name is derived from the Japanese salutation \\"tadaima\\" (\\"I'm back home\\") and \\"okaeri\\" (\\"Welcome back\\"). The company's first product, tado¬∞ Heating, was launched in November 2012 in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, and in 2013 in the United Kingdom. In the beginning of 2014, tado¬∞ Cooling underwent a crowd-funding campaign on Kickstarter. In July 2014, tado¬∞ closed a ‚Ç¨10m ($13.6m) funding round from, among others, Target Partners and Shortcut Ventures. The company's second product, tado¬∞ Smart AC Control, for intelligent cooling was launched in Europe and the USA in June 2015. The launch event took place in New York City.  Products  Besides reducing energy consumption and increasing savings the thermostat also considers the residents' overall comfort. tado¬∞ detects the absence or presence of residents via smartphone and then adjusts the heating automatically. Weather forecasts and the heating properties of a home such as insulation are taken into account. One challenge for tado¬∞ is the heterogeneous heating landscape in Europe and the related integration and support of their respective control interfaces. Currently more than 5,000 different heating systems can be controlled by tado¬∞ Heating. In June 2015 tado¬∞ launched its second product, the Smart AC Control. It is not a thermostat. It turns any air conditioning unit into a smarter device. tado¬∞ Smart AC Control uses a smartphone's location to be able to determine whether the resident is at home and automatically turns the AC on or off. The air conditioner can also be manually operated via the Smart AC Control using the tado¬∞ App. In August 2017, tado¬∞ announced the integration of Google Assistant, allowing customers who both own a tado¬∞ system and a Google Assistant device to control their Tado system via voice commands.

It originally aired on February 17, 2011. The episode was written by Andrew Chambliss and directed by Marcos Siega. Plot Elena (Nina Dobrev) and Stefan (Paul Wesley) are still at the Gilbert's lake house where Elena reads Jonathan's new journal she and Stefan found in the secret room of the house. Stefan is still mad at her for her decision to sacrifice herself to save her family and friends. While reading, Elena finds out that Stefan attacked Jonathan and tried to kill him but Jonathan did not die because of the Gilbert ring. Stefan starts telling Elena about his life after he first turn into a vampire and how different he was than he is now. Damon (Ian Somerhalder) plans to kill Elijah (Daniel Gillies) with the dagger that John (David Anders) gave him and he informs Stefan about it but they both hide it from Elena. Damon is at the Grill with Alaric (Matt Davis) and Andie (Dawn Olivieri) when Elijah comes in with Jenna (Sara Canning). Damon gets the opportunity and invites Elijah and everyone for dinner at the Salvatore house. Before the dinner, Damon visits Katherine at the tomb to let her know that he is going to kill Elijah and asks her if it is possible to kill an Original. Katherine says that there is no way he can kill Elijah but seems to change her mind when Damon mentions he has a dagger and the ash from an old oak tree and she starts begging him not to kill Elijah otherwise she will stuck forever in the tomb since Elijah compelled her. She also offers to help them kill Klaus if Damon helps her get out of the tomb. Damon realizes from her reaction that the dagger can really kill an Original and leaves, leaving her behind. Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) and Bonnie (Kat Graham) hang out at the Grill and Jeremy tries to ask Bonnie to come for dinner after they kissed when Luka (Bryton James) shows up and asks what they did to him. Bonnie pretends that she does not understand what he is talking about and when he gets persistent, Jeremy asks him to leave. Bonnie tells Jeremy that she has to practice so she can get stronger and Jeremy tells her that he can help her and Bonnie agrees to meet him later at his house. Back at the lake house, Stefan keeps telling Elena about his first years as a vampire and how he met Lexi (Arielle Kebbel) who helped him become a better vampire. Elena keeps reading the journal and she finds out that Jonathan was trying to find a way to kill an Original. In the journal, there is a mention about the dagger and how it works and that it should be only used by a human, otherwise, if a vampire tries to kill another vampire with it, then both will die. Stefan realizes that John gave the dagger to Damon to use it because he wants to kill Damon as well and immediately tries to call Damon and warn him about it. At the same time in the Salvatore house, Damon is getting ready to kill Elijah when Alaric interrupts him since he got a phone call from Stefan who told him about the dagger. Alaric stops Damon's plan who wants to know why and Alaric tells him about the dagger, who is mad that he can not use it. As they all get ready for dessert, Alaric gets the opportunity and kills Elijah himself in front of everyone (except Jenna) and asks Damon to hide his body before Jenna sees it. Elena is upset because Stefan and Damon did not tell her what they were planning to do but Stefan tells her that she also did not tell them about her willing to sacrifice herself and tries to convince her to fight for her survival. He uses his story with Lexi and how Lexi helped him to come out of the darkness he was through love and fought for his survival. Later on, Elena continues reading the journal where it says that for the Original to remain dead, the dagger should not be removed. Stefan rushes to call Damon but when Damon goes to check on Elijah's body, the body is gone. Elijah is mad and goes to Jonas (Randy J. Goodwin) demanding to find where is Elena immediately. Bonnie gets to Jeremy's house to find out that Jeremy has prepared a romantic dinner for the two of them. She makes sure to him that she liked what happened between them but she prefers to talk to Elena first before anything more happens. Jeremy accepts what she says and Bonnie starts practicing her magic while Jeremy is there. Their session gets interrupted when Jonas breaks into the house and demands to know what they did to his son and what Luka has told them. Bonnie is forced to tell him and then Jonas leave but not before he takes Bonnie's powers. Elijah shows up at the lake house to take Elena but Elena tries to make the same deal she did with him before; that she will go with him if he promises to keep her family and friends safe. Elijah does not seem to agree and Elena threatens to kill herself and become a vampire, just like Katherine did, something the will make her useless for him. Elijah calls her bluff but Elena moves on and stabs herself in the stomach. Elijah freaks out, accepts the deal and asks her to let him heal her. When he gets close enough, Elena stabs him with the dagger and Elijah falls dead. Stefan gives Elena his blood to heal her and Damon is also there reminding to not remove the dagger from the body. Stefan and Damon take Elijah's body to the Salvatore cellar and Elena promises that she will fight for her survival but makes a deal with the brothers that they will not hide anything from her anymore and that from now on they will do whatever it takes to kill Klaus but they will do it her way. Damon and Stefan agree. In the meantime, Jenna asks Alaric about his dead wife but Alaric refuses to tell her anything more than he already did. Jenna realizes that John was right and that Alaric is not honest with her and she leaves mad. John, who heard the whole conversation, tells Alaric that he can fix this if he wants him to. Alaric declines his offer and gives him back the Gilbert ring, since it is what John wants from him, and tells him that he will need it more than him after trying to kill Damon. The episode ends with Damon finding Katherine in his room having a shower. He is shocked seeing her there but Katherine explains that when an Original dies then their compulsion wears off and that is how she was able to get out of the tomb and she knew that if she begged him not to kill Elijah Damon would do the exact opposite. Damon realizes that she tricked him but Katherine says that she is still there because she wants to help them kill Klaus.

Slava received a severe trauma to the skull as a child, and if he is hit in the head, he may die. Roma asks his father to become his coach, despite their difficult relationship, due to his alcoholism. In the ring, Roma and Slava win victories one after another, and become even in the final battle. Slava uses a stifling technique, forcing Roma to surrender.

Tarcondimotus at first supported Pompey in the civil war against Julius Caesar, but after Pompey's defeat and death, he was pardoned by Caesar and confirmed in his title and possessions. The name of Tarcondimotus' daughter is probably an indication that he received the Roman citizenship from Caesar as well. During the Liberators' civil war, he sided with Gaius Cassius Longinus, and after that with Mark Antony, whom he followed in the opening stages of the war against Octavian. Tarcondimotus was killed in a battle at sea in 31 BC, fighting under Gaius Sosius against Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa.

Philippine Airlines (PAL) was designated as the flag carrier and became the lone surviving airline, absorbing Air Manila and Filipinas Orient Airways. Subsidies from the government and income from better performing routes allowed PAL to service smaller airports. When the airline industry was opened to new players in 1995, PAL continued service to some missionary routes until 1999, shortly after it went into receivership. Today, missionary routes have been taken over by smaller regional carriers such as Sky Pasada and SkyJet, and to some extent by low-cost carriers. As these routes are no longer heavily subsidized, air fare is higher and at times compatible with business class seats in major air routes.

The Durand Stone is an artifact in Bahrain dating back to the Kassite period (1600 BC ‚Äî 1155 BC). Named after Captain Edward Law Durand who had first identified it, the stone is a 25‚Äì30 cm wide and 70‚Äì80 cm long black basalt sculpture in the shape of a prow of a boat or an animal's tongue, with a cuneiform inscription. Contents The inscription, in Old Babylonian cuneiform script, was translated by Henry Rawlinson to read: \\"The palace of Rimum, servant of (the god) Inzak, (and) man of (the tribe of) Agarum\\". Inzak, son of Enki, was a principal god of Bahrain, and the Durand Stone provides archaeological evidence for identifying these islands as 'the abode of the blessed' of Dilmun referred to by Sumerian literature. History Originally housed in the \\"holy of holies\\" of the Madrasseh-i Daood mosque (now destroyed) in Bilad Al Qadeem, it was spotted in 1878 by Captain Edward Law Durand (first-assistant resident to the Persian Gulf Residency), who tricked the mullahs into releasing it to him by telling them it was a fire-worshipper's stone and therefore unIslamic. The stone itself, a diorite, is believed to originate from Oman or southeastern Iran. The contents of the inscription helped archaeologists conclude that Bahrain was the location of the Dilmun civilization. Today According to the records of Charles Belgrave, the Durand Stone was destroyed during the Second World War. A replica of the Durand Stone lies in the Bahrain National Museum.

Life Born at Cholmeaton in Cheshire, he was the eldest son of Robert Werden, and his first wife, Jane Backham. He was called to the bar in 1660 at the Middle Temple, and on 16 November 1664 was admitted baron of the exchequer for Cheshire. Werden became secretary to the embassy in Spain and Portugal under the Earl of Sandwich, and at the end of 1669 was sent to Holland with official instructions to Sir William Temple to moderate his support for the Triple Alliance, which Charles II found untimely. In 1670 he went to Sweden as envoy extraordinary, but in 1672 he was again in Holland. On 28 November 1672 Werden was created a baronet. He was also secretary to James, Duke of York, and took a shorthand report of Titus Oates's's narrative before the House of Lords. On 11 February 1673 he was returned to Parliament for in Surrey, retaining his seat until the dissolution in January 1679. On 22 May 1683 he received the honorary degree of D.C.L. from the university of Oxford. At this period Werden employed John Ashton, the future Jacobite plotter. After the accession of James II Werden was again returned to Parliament for Reigate, on 27 March 1685, and on 2 April was appointed a commissioner of customs. On the dissolution of Parliament in July 1687 he did not seek re-election. On 1 October 1688 he was placed on the commission of the lieutenancy of London, but on the landing of William of Orange, like his father, he deserted the king; and in consequence was excluded by name from James's declaration of pardon in 1692. William continued him in the commission for the customs, but not for the lieutenancy of London. In August 1697 he was removed from the customs, but was replaced on the accession of Queen Anne. Werden was a Tory, and retired from office and public life in 1714 on the Hanoverian succession. He died on 29 October 1716, and was buried on 7 November in the church of St. Martin-in-the- Fields. Legacy Some of Werden's letters written while he was secretary of the Duke of York went to the British Museum (Stowe MSS.). Family Werden was twice married: first, to Lucy Osbourne, daughter of a doctor of divinity, and secondly to Mary (died 22 August 1683), daughter of William Osbourne of Kenniford in Devon. By his second wife he had an only son John, whose daughter Lucy married Charles Beauclerk, 2nd Duke of St Albans; on the death of Sir John Werden, 2nd Baronet, without male issue, on 13 February 1758, the Werden baronetcy became extinct, and his estates passed to George Beauclerk, 3rd Duke of St Albans.

It was Hisham who defended the doctrine of Imamate based on wisdom and logic; a topic he proved himself to be fully competent for. His debates on different religious matters are alive till present days. Biography The exact year of the birth of Hisham is not clear, but it is understood from several sources that he was born from Hakam in Kufa, the centre of Iraqi's Shiites, in the beginning of the second century of Hejri, and grew up in Waset. Afterwards he lived a few years in Baghdad where he was conducting business.Hesham ibn Hakam - by Ahmad Safai, pg.1O. He was interested in Islamic theology and in his youth he was a follower of Jahm bin Safwan, leader of the Jahmi Sect. Afterwards during some debates with Jafar al-Sadiq, he became one of his followers. Of his first visit to the seventh Shiite imam, he himself says that one day while selling fabric under a shaded tree, Musa al-Kadhim happened to ride by. \\"He turned his face to me and said, 'O Hisham, selling something in the shadows is similar to cheating, and cheating is unlawful in Islam.'\\" Debates It is said that Hisham was skillful in debates, and that he said: \\"By God, till this day when I am standing here, nobody has defeated me in religious discourses.\\" Jafar al-Sadiq used to praise him for his debates, in spite of the fact that the imam would advise his other companions not to engage in discussion, saying \\"Don't enter into a discussion, especially one about which you have no knowledge.\\" When a learned Syrian came to al-Sadiq to exchange views on various issues with him, the Imam made him discuss them with some of his disciples instead. Among these disciples were Hamran ibn A'yan, Aban ibn Taghlab, Zarareh, Taiyar, Hisham ibn Salem, and Hisham ibn Hakam. Then to show that not every kind of discussion is eligible he said \\"O Syrian brother, Hamran ibn A'yan came out victorious over you by distorting the facts and using clever speech and set forth his questions to you in a suitable and proper time; and you could not reply to him. Aban ibn Taghlab confused right and wrong to oust you from the combat of the debate and asked you questions to which you could not give the proper answers. But Zarareh defeated you with the help of analogy and allegory. Taiyar, another companion is just like that bird which sits sometimes and then rises up and you are just like that wingless bird which has no power to rise up after sitting down once. Hisham ibn Salem used to put questions again and again cleverly. But Hisham ibn Hakam entered the arena with reasoning and diction and argued with you by means of logical reasoning.\\" =On Imamate= Hisham wrote many books concerning the subject of the Imamate, and scholars of his time regarded him as the defender of the doctrine of \\"Imamate\\" and the \\"eye of the shiite\\" as he was a watchful protector of those who apposed imamat. It is said that once a Syrian came to the Imam and he made some of his disciples to discuss with him in turn. Finally, the Imam turned his face to the Syrian and said: \\"If you like, you could also discuss with this young man - Hisham.\\" The man addressed Hisham rudely and said, \\"O boy! If you have anything to say about the Imamate of your Imam, tell me?\\" Hisham, while shivering from anger said, \\"O sir, has your Lord created the human beings in vain and left them without any leader and guide?\\" The Syrian replied: \\"the Kind Creator is generous towards His servants and is not neglectful of them.\\" Hisham said, \\"If it is just as you say, then describe the conditions of their leadership and guidance.\\" The Syrian replied, \\"God has appointed His Hujjat (Guide) for the human beings, so that they might not dispute among themselves and not separate from each other. Rather they must love each other and come to friendly terms between themselves. The guide must explain the commandments of the Creator for them.\\" Hisham asked: \\"Who is that guide and leader?\\" The Syrian replied: \\"The Prophet of God.\\" Hisham said: \\"When the Prophet left this world, who became responsible for the guidance of these people?\\" The Syrian replied: \\"The Quran and the traditions of the Prophet.\\" Hisham said: \\"Today, it is a very long time since the death of the Prophet. Do you think the Book and the traditions alone can solve the disputes?\\" He replied: \\"Yes, of course, they are enough and sufficient.\\" Hisham said: \\"If it is just as you say, then why do you and I dispute and why have you travelled such a long way from Syria?...\\" =With the chief of the Kharajites= The chief of the Kharijites was a learned man. Before starting with the debate Hisham said to his opponent that he was ready for the debate but they should appoint a referee among themselves so that if the discussion \\"be lengthy and reach a place where there may occur some problems and complications and both of us may not accept the reality due to obstinacy‚Ä¶ so he may be able to make us return at the time of our deviation from the right path.\\" When the Khregite agreed Hisham asked \\"who should be this referee and a follower of which religion? Should he be one of my supporters or one of your friends? Or one who oppose both of our beliefs or be opposed to the Muslim community and Islam?\\" The Karegit said \\"You should select anyone whom you like, because you are a just man and I am satisfied with your selection.\\" \\"In my opinion,\\" said Hisham, \\"it is a difficult task because if that judge comes from among my supporters then you will not be safe from his party spirit; and if he comes from among your supporters then I may not be safe. On the contrary, if he is from among the opponents and against both of our beliefs, then none of us may be safe from the harm of his unjustified arbitration. Then it is advisable that one man from each side oversees our speech; and witnesses our discussion and debate and arbitrates according to justice and fairness,\\" recommended Hisham. When the Kharegit agreed Hisham turned his face towards Yahya who held this discussion and said: \\"O Vizier (minister), be a witness that I have disapproved of his reasoning and have condemned him and have made him helpless. He has nothing to say anymore and I also do not need to debate with him.\\" And when they asked him how he condemned the man while the discussion had not started yet, he said \\"Is it not true that in the beginning these Kharajites, were of the same opinion as we were concerning the matter of Imamate and the Wilayah of Ali until the problem of the arbitration occurred in the Battle of Siffin? They acted rudely‚Ä¶ and called him (Ali) an infidel because of the acceptance of the arbitration although they themselves compelled him to accept this matter. Now this learned man who is himself respectable and reliable among his followers, has accepted the arbitration and judgement of the two men without any compulsion and force - one of these two men is my follower who is an infidel according to his Khawarijite belief and the other is his own supporter. Both of them have different beliefs and are opposed to each other. Now if he is right in choosing the arbitration and has chosen the right path, then there is no cause for him to criticize Amirul Mu'mineen who is more worthy and wise...\\" Books Hisham wrote many books on Islamic issues. Mohsen Amili, refuting Jalaluddin Seuti who had said that the first writer of fundamental of Muslim laws was Shafi'i, mentions the names of some scholars to prove that Hisham is the first man who wrote books on the fundamentals of speculative theology. Hisham was also skilled in argumentation about the Creator, unity of God, attributes of His Glory, discussion on free will, and natural philosophy. In spite of these, however, he has not always been a favorable character. Some scholars blamed him for dualism and infidelity and writes that he believed in corporeality of God. Responding the accusation, 'Alamul Huda, a Shiite scholar writes: \\"this famous sentence 'God is corporeal but not like other corporal bodies' which Hisham has been accused of saying, has been interpreted in different ways.\\" Hisham was, he says, debating with Mu øtazila and he had to use their own phraseology. Al-Shahrastani, the writer of the book Al-Milal wa al-Nihal said a similar thing when he wrote that Hisham used this phrase during his debates with the group of Ghulat (extremists).

Cross platform gameplay is central to the digital version‚Äôs design and it is supported on PC, Mac, iOS, and Android. A physical version has also been released. Gameplay The game Shadow Era is currently played between two players. Each player has a Hero which starts with 26-30 health. Players win the game when they reduce the opponents health to 0. Heroes can lose life when they are dealt \\"damage\\" by being attacked with summoned allies, abilities and weapons. A Hero will also lose 1 health for each card they are unable to draw when their deck is empty. Shadow Era currently consists of 5 in-game sets: Call of the Crystals, Dark Prophecies, Shattered Fates, Lost Lands Part 1, and Campaigns. A player may only include cards in their deck that match the ‚ÄòFaction‚Äô and ‚ÄòClass‚Äô of the Hero they are using. Cards classed as ‚ÄòNeutral‚Äô can be used by any Hero. A deck must contain a minimum of 39 cards and 1 Hero. (Exclusions exist when playing the AI in the digital version). New game modes have also been unveiled, such as Rated matches, Unrated matches, and Meltdown. In Rated matches, you are paired up with another human player. The winner's rating and score increases. Unrated matches do not increase your rating, although you are allowed to make private matches with or without a password. Meltdown is a game mode where you pick four random booster packs, pick one of the Heroes that came in those packs, build a deck with the cards from the packs, and play a match using it. Class and Faction restrictions are removed for Meltdown. You are not allowed to keep the Hero or the cards used in Meltdown. Currencies within the game include Gold and Shadow Crystals. Gold can be collected from winning matches in Rated, ranking in the weekly Meltdown ladder, and selling cards to the in-game merchant. Shadow Crystals can be acquired by leveling up either your Hero level or your account level, and by purchasing from the in- game store for real money. Gold can be used to purchase new cards from the in- game merchant. Shadow Crystals can be used to purchase name changes, booster packs, class decks, as well as card sleeves and playmats. Shadow Crystals can be sent between players, but Gold cannot currently be shared with others. Resources Shadow Era uses a Resource system to cover the summoning cost of every card. Each turn, the player has an option to sacrifice a card to add to their Resource pool. Each card has a summoning cost at the top left, and this number represents how many cards must have been sacrificed total, called Resources, in order to summon that card into play. Resources refresh every turn, allowing players to accumulate Resources over the duration of the match. Heroes There are different types of Heroes as well. These include Warrior, Mage, Priest, Rogue, Hunter, Wulven, and Elemental. There are currently 32 Heroes in the digital game. Each player has the ability to buy different Heroes from the merchant screen in-game. Players are able to customize and alter their decks to fit their playing style. When you start the game, you will see a map, which will be related to the Lore of the Hero selected. On each map there are 10 available missions, with 1 (easy), 2 (medium), and 3 (hard) star difficulties. Current Human Faction Heroes: Boris Skullcrusher (Human Warrior), Amber Rain (Human Warrior), Tala Pureheart (Human Warrior), Nishaven (Human Mage), Eladwen Frostmire (Human Mage), Aramia (Human Mage), Loest, Savior of Layar (Human Mage), Victor Heartstriker (Human Hunter), Gwenneth Truesight (Human Hunter), Ythan Redthorn (Human Hunter), Lance Shadowstalker (Human Rogue), Serena Thoughtripper (Human Rogue), Garth Ravensoul (Human Rogue), Zhanna Mist (Human Priest), Jericho Spellbane (Human Priest), Threbin the Righteous (Human Priest) Current Shadow Faction Heroes: Ter Adun (Shadow Warrior), Logan Stonebreaker (Shadow Warrior), Vess Swifthands (Shadow Warrior), Rothem, King of Layar (Shadow Warrior), Gravebone (Shadow Mage), Majiya (Shadow Mage), Raikka Spellseeker (Shadow Mage), Banebow (Shadow Hunter), Baduruu (Shadow Hunter), Skervox (Shadow Hunter), Zaladar (Shadow Elemental), Elementalis (Shadow Elemental), Praxix (Shadow Elemental), Darkclaw (Shadow Wulven), Moonstalker (Shadow Wulven), Bloodfang (Shadow Wulven) Guilds Guilds are a growing and constantly evolving part of Shadow Era. Popular apps on the iOS App Store and the Android Google Play Store are used for communication between members, including Telegram and QQ. Guilds in Shadow Era are free to create, and tend to congregate on their chosen communications app. The guilds in Shadow Era are simply groups of players who wish to excel in the game and formed cooperative and competitive teams to do so. You will see guild members in-game marked by their guild tag in front of their player names.

Mahziar was a ninth-century scholar and companion of Muhammad al-Jawad, Ali al-Hadi, and Hasan al-Askari, the ninth, tenth, and eleventh of the Twelve Imams. Also, he was their agent in some areas particularly Ahvaz. Mahziar learned Islamic jurisprudence from these Shia Imams. Shia scholars accepted his religious narrates about the Fourteen Infallibles with complete confidence. Al-Ahvazi is noted for his writings, including a Kitab al-malahim [Book of Prophecies], as well as a Kitab al-qa'im.ÿ±ÿ¨ÿßŸÑ ÿßŸÑŸÜÿ¨ÿßÿ¥€åÿõ ŸÜÿ¨ÿßÿ¥€åÿå ÿßÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ÿ®ŸÜ ÿπŸÑ€åÿõ ŸÖÿ§ÿ≥ÿ≥Ÿá ÿßŸÑŸÜÿ¥ÿ± ÿßŸÑÿßÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÖ€å ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿßÿ®ÿπŸá ŸÑÿ¨ŸÖÿßÿπŸá ÿßŸÑŸÖÿØÿ±ÿ≥€åŸÜ ÿ®ŸÇŸÖÿå ŸÇŸÖÿå 1365ÿå ÿµÿµ 253-254 Mahziar was born in Hendijan but owing to the fact that Hendijan was Doraq (today known as Shadegan) city suburban he was known as Doraq resident. His father was Christian, but in his youth along with his father converted to Islam. Later he stayed in Ahvaz. The time of his death is unknown, but presumably he died during Hasan al-Askari'a era. There is holy shrine of Ali ibn Mahziar in Ahvaz. Ali al-Ridha, the eighth Shia Imam, entered Ahvaz on his way to Khorasan and stayed in the city, since Al-Ma'mun, Abbasid caliph, commanded to transfer Ali al-Ridha to Khorasan from Medina. A few days later, on Ali al-Ridha's accommodation, a mosque named Masjed Al-Redha was built which Ali ibn Mahziar's body buried in it according to his will.

Early life and Paris career Little is known about the early life of Bianca Mosca, but she was Italian by birth and a cousin of the fashion designer Elsa Schiaparelli, according to a 1932 article in The New Yorker, which describes her as: \\"the beautiful Bianca Mosca (Schiaparelli's cousin)\\". The New Yorker article notes that she had been among Schiaparelli's notable vendeuses (salespeople) in Paris. Mosca told a reporter in 1941 that she had spent eighteen years in Paris. Move to London In 1937 Mosca launched a business in London. She was also appointed head designer for the London branch of the House of Paquin and also worked for Worth. In 1939 she became head designer for the Jacqmar studio, and it was both as its representative and as Paquin London's that she joined the Incorporated Society of London Fashion Designers as a founder member in 1942. In her role with IncSoc and Jacqmar, she became involved with designing prototype utility clothing designs. With other IncSoc members, she became involved in creating film costumes to promote British couture. The 1949 romantic comedy Maytime in Mayfair is among her credits. Earlier, she created a wedding dress for Peggy Bryan for the 1945 horror film Dead of Night‚Äîthe slim-fitting bridal outfit made under the Bianca Mosca label was photographed by the Ministry of Information. Marriage In London, in 1942, Mosca married Claude Boisragon Crawford (born 1895), an India-born former British Army officer turned technician.The Catholic Who's Who\\", Francis Cowley Burnand, Burns & Oates., 1952, page 93 Eponymous label In 1946, Mosca opened her own couture house; this had financial backing from George Child Villiers, 9th Earl of Jersey, who would marry Mosca's niece Bianca Mottironi the following year. In early 1949, a review of her collection in the Australian press highlighted \\"semi-eveningwear\\"‚Äîsleeveless, floor length gowns in organza or brocade with full underskirts and coats designed on similar principles. At this stage, Mosca's notable clients included the Duchess of Kent. One of her co-designers was Walter Meggison, who went on to a successful career as a fashion designer in his native Australia in the 1950s.\\"Wearside\\", Sunderland Daily Echo and Shipping Gazette, 18 August 1954, page 2 Mosca continued to work to promote British fashion. She and Victor Stiebel‚Äîwho succeeded her at Jacqmar‚Äîshowed a series of suits in London in 1949 using British woollens and worsteds in a bid to attract overseas buyers. Mosca was closely involved with Sekers fabrics in Whitehaven, using its silks in her collections and working with some of its innovative fabrics. In 1949, she donated a dress to the collection of Doris Langley Moore, later to establish the Fashion Museum, Bath. The dress was permanently pleated and made of nylon fabric ‚Äì as such, it became the first British couture dress in the collection to feature a synthetic silk. Mosca designed a showstopping black brocaded silk evening gown for Margot Fonteyn, worn by the prima ballerina at a reception in New York after her opening performance of Sleeping Beauty in 1949. Fonteyn was photographed by Cecil Beaton for British Vogue in this dress. By December 1949 Mosca's eponymous label was failing and the receivers were called in‚Äîthis during a post-war slump in sales of British couture, due to a dwindling home market and overseas buyers' preference for Paris fashions. Claude Crawford, Mosca's husband, told the newspaper reporting the story that the company intended to continue trading under the Bianca Mosca name and was still taking orders. Death and legacy Having fallen ill with \\"a rare form of asthma\\" in 1949, the same year that she underwent what was described as \\"a serious operation\\",\\"Manchester's Diary\\", Manchester Evening News, 16 December 1949, page 3 Mosca died at Paris's H√¥pital Necker in June 1950. Her obituary notice in The Sydney Morning Herald notes that she had recently opened an office in Paris to promote British fabrics in France. A short tribute in The Times noted: \\"Fashion was her m√©tier, and she epitomized the chic that she dispensed\\". In October 1951, it was announced in The Yorkshire Post that a trust fund would be established by friends of Bianca Mosca in order to award a fashion design scholarship in her name. In 1954, the Council of the Royal Society of Arts took over the administration of the Bianca Mosca Memorial Trust, introducing two new bursaries for designers in the field of fashion, shoes, millinery or jewellery and announcing that the awards jury would include Edward Molyneux and Audrey Withers.

Early life He was born in Aiguillon, Lot-et-Garonne 14 May 1874. Sabatt√©'s parents separated in 1880 and he moved with his mother to Bordeaux. Having studied at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, in 1893 he began working there in the studio of Gustave Moreau. At his first exhibition at the Paris Salon, a portrait of his grandmother was purchased by the state. Artistic career and recognition In 1900 he won the Grand Prix de Rome for his painting Un Spartiate et l'Ilote. From 1926 he taught painting, first at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Lille until 1929, then at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. His student Louise Cottin won a second prize of Rome in 1934. Also in 1929, he founded the bimonthly magazine Art. He entered the Academy of Fine Arts of the Institute of France in 1935 (painting section, chair 5). Viewed as an academic painter, who was heavily influenced by his religion, which has been described as bordering on mystical. He remained heavily influenced by his tutor Moreau, retaining a very realistic style of painting, only briefly experimenting with Impressionism. He is credited, amongst other Paris artists, as fostering a new generation of modern women artists. There is a street in his native Aiguillon named in his honour. Military career During World War 1 Fernand Sabatt√© received the Croix de guerre and became a Chevalier (Knight) in the Legion of Honour. He was decorated for his services, while serving as an army officer, responsible for salvaging art works and sculptures from bombed-out towns in Northern France from 1916-1918, while simultaneously painting scenes of ruined churches and civic buildings, and can therefore be classed as a war artist. He held the rank and title of ‚ÄòChef de la section du front du Nord du service de protection et d‚Äô√©vacuation des monuments et oeuvres d‚Äôart‚Äô. Today an extensive series of photographs featuring Sabatt√© shows the damaged buildings which his unit surveyed, today held at the M√©diath√®que de l‚ÄôArchitecture et du Patrimoine, Paris. It is not known exactly when Sabatt√© enlisted with the French army, although a patriotic postcard sent to fellow ex alumni of the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, now serving in the French army, is dated 1915. We know that he was appointed head of his unit, the Protection et d‚Äô√©vacuation des monuments et oeuvres d‚Äôart in October 1916.  Salvaging damaged church artefacts in the Zone Rouge  The journal Le Bulletin de la vie artistique published in 1920, provides a concise history of his unit. It states that after the cataclysmic Battle of Verdun in 1916, the French government took proactive steps to evacuate art from the zone rouge, as well as salvage wrecked buildings, particularly churches, destroyed by artillery under the authorisation of L‚Äôadministration des Beaux Arts. In October 1916 this unit was officially instituted with its orders to salvage artefacts and bring them to rear area depots, where rudimentary conservation work could be carried out. Divided into three sectors ‚Äì Central (Argonne and Somme), East (Argonne and Swiss), and North (Somme and Belgium) ‚Äì this third section was headed-up by Fernand Sabatt√©. Four depots were set up under his command; Chateau Martainville (Rouen), Chateau d‚ÄôEu (Dieppe), AbbevilleUn d√©p√¥t temporaire de protection des ≈ìuvres et objets d‚Äôart du Front nord, sous le commandement du lieutenant Sabatt√©, est install√© dans l‚Äôancien couvent des fr√®res Eudistes. and Arras. The following description of his salvaging work is extracted from the Bulletin de la Commission d√©partementale des monuments historiques du Pas- de-Calais, 1920 and provides this connection. > Il convient surtout de nommer le lieutenant du g√©nie Sabatt√©, chef du > service des monuments et objets d'art de la zone des arm√©es. Pendant la > guerre, ce brave officier fit preuve d'un z√®le et d'un courage au-dessus de > tout √©loge. Admirablement second√© par une √©quipe de soldats, sp√©cialis√©s > dans ce service, il proc√©da au sauvetage de nos oeuvres d'art jusque sous le > feu de l'ennemi, au milieu des obus et des incendies. Et le Mus√©e vraiment > remarquable, install√© par lui √† Arras, dans un vaste hangar, autrefois salle > de gymnastique, t√©moigne du succ√®s de son intervention. En 1919, il n'a > cess√© de parcourir les villages d√©vast√©s, fouillant les d√©combres des > √©glises ; chaque jour son mus√©e s'enrichissait de quelque statue, pierre > tombale, cloche ou b√©nitier, rescap√© au milieu des ruines. > It is worth mentioning Lieutenant of (Administrative) Engineering, Sabatt√©, > Chief of the Monuments and Arts Service in the war zone. During the war this > brave officer proved his zeal, courage and above all (deserves our) praise. > Admirably assisted by a team of soldiers who specialised in this service, he > proceeded to rescue our artworks even under enemy attack, (even) in the > midst of shells and fires. And the truly remarkable Museum, established by > him in Arras, in a large store, formerly a gymnasium, demonstrates the > success of his intervention. In 1919, he continued to visit the devastated > towns, searching the rubble of churches; and so every day the museum was > enriched by some statue, stone tombstone, bell or font, survivors from the > ruins.  German frightfulness and apportioning war guilt  The bombardment of Arras, and the destruction of its medieval belfry, caused consternation in France and was utilised for propaganda purposes as an example of German Frightfulness or Schrecklichkeit. Approximately a dozen French and Belgian towns received bombardment by German artillery during World War One, including the Cathedral of Rheims, Library of Leuven, Soissons, Ypres, Mauberge and Arras, and these towns were referred to in contemporary press reports as the martyred towns (or Les villages d√©truits). The identity of Sabatt√© in this unit is established in a photograph listing his name during a ministerial visitVisit by the Ministre en charge des Beaux Arts au Service du Front Nord (Abbeville depot, July 1919). In the centre, Louis Lafferre, ministre de l‚ÄôInstruction publique (Cl√©menceau government) (November 1917 - January 1920), on the right, prefect for the Somme, Alfred Morain.

Sabatt√©'s work continued into 1919. From photographs held at the M√©diath√®que de l‚ÄôArchitecture et du Patrimoine, it can be seen that his unit in Arras utilised German Prisoners of War, and this project is an outcome of the French government's determination to publicise German war guilt and to give evidence to its reparation payments.  Painting war ruins  In 1916 he painted Int√©rieur de la cath√©drale d‚ÄôArras en ruines, en 1916 (Collection Mus√©e d‚ÄôOrsay, Paris). In this painting he wrote an inscription at the lower right hand corner of the canvas, that his painting session was \\"interrupted by the explosion of an artillery shell of huge calibre, 20th May 1916\\".La Cathredrale d'Arras pendant la guerre. Tableau interrompu par la chute d'un obus de gros calibre le 26 mai 1916. In the archive collection of the Monuments Historiques, the database lists 23 photographs taken by Sabatt√© of Arras, showing war damaged buildings, so it is highly likely that he worked from photographs in order to produce the painting, the Arras Belfry (Belfroi) held in the National Gallery of Ireland, from his salvage warehouse in the town. Sabatt√© died after being struck by a German truck in Chamigny October 22, 1940.

The film was remade in Kannada as Raj Vishnu starring Sharan in the lead role and released on 2017. Plot Rajini Murugan (Sivakarthikeyan) is an unemployed youth from Madurai who spends his days roaming around with his best friend Thotathree (Soori) and supplying food to his grandfather Ayyankalai (Rajkiran), a highly respected gentleman who has large properties of land. Ayyankalai wants to divide all his properties among his children and grandchildren, but except Rajini Murugan and his father Malligarajan (G. Gnanasambandam), who is the headmaster of the local school, the rest of the family is settled abroad and never visit Madurai. Meanwhile, following the advice of an astrologer (who claimed that Rajini Murugan will get married and be rich within three months), Rajini Murugan starts wooing his childhood sweetheart Karthika Devi (Keerthy Suresh). Karthika's father Neelakandan (Achyuth Kumar), an ardent fan of Rajinikanth, was the best friend of Malligarajan and had given Rajini Murugan his name when he was born, but fell out with Malligarajan and his family due to a misunderstanding involving Rajini Murugan and Karthika when they were children. Since then, Rajini Murugan and Karthika are not on speaking terms, and Neelakandan forbids any sort of contact between the two. Nevertheless, Rajini Murugan opens a tea stall outside Karthika's house to stay close to her and follows her day and night. The stall is later destroyed by a customer who pulls down the shop in the process of taking a banana. Later, he and Thothathree start a real estate company. A gangster \\"Ezhrai\\" Mookan (Samuthirakani), whose only work is to extort 100,000 from businessmen, tries to swindle the same amount from Rajini Murugan, but fails and ends up paying 100,000 to him. Ayyankalai, who is fed up with Rajini Murugan's antics, decides to immediately divide his properties so that Rajini Murugan can benefit from his share of the property. He fakes his death, which forces his children and grandchildren to come to Madurai. Mookan claims that he too is a grandson of Ayyankalai (through the son of Ayyankalai's first wife) and starts demanding his share of the property. This leads to confrontation between Rajini Murugan and Mookan and their feud is soon brought before the panchayat. The panchayat declares the verdict in favour of Ayyankalai and Rajini Murugan. Mookan, accepting defeat, receives 100,000 from Rajini Murugan as compensation. It is then revealed that Mookan staged the whole drama to get back his 100,000 from Rajini Murugan. Meanwhile, Karthika accepts Rajini Murugan's love and Neelakandan also begins to approve their relationship. In the end, Ayyankalai reveals that he does have a grandson through his first wife's son. The grandson is revealed to be none other than Bosepandi(Sivakarthikeyan) from Varuthapadatha Valibar Sangam. Bosepandi refuses to accept his share of his grandfather's property, advising him and his family not to sell the property and instead convert it into a 5-star hotel and hand it over to Rajini Murugan. Ayyankalai and Rajini Murugan agree with him. Cast * Sivakarthikeyan in a dual role as: **M.

Initially, the film slated to release on 17 July 2015, coinciding with the Ramzan weekend. However, the release was postponed to avoid clash with Dhanush-starrer Maari, and was later scheduled to release on 17 September 2015, coinciding with Vinayagar Chathurthi. However, the financial disputes between the producers and distributors, led to postpone the release of the film on 1 October 2015, which was later delayed due to the release of Vijay-starrer Puli. The plans to release the film on 21 October 2015, during the Dusshera festival was also failed. Finally, the makers announced that the film will release on 4 December 2015. The makers went on with the film's promotion in November 2015, however, the release was pushed further, due to the 2015 South Indian Floods. Later, the film was scheduled to release on 14 January 2016, coinciding with the Pongal weekend, and also clashing with other releases Gethu, Kathakali and Thaarai Thappattai.  Financial issues  During the production of Kamal Hassan's Uttama Villain (2015), the producers suffered losses as the Suriya- starrer Anjaan (2014), which was produced and directed by Lingusamy, bombed at the box office. Hence, in order to overcome the losses, Lingusamy desperately sold both Uttama Villain and Rajinimurugan, to Eros International. Lingusamy, also borrowed money from local distributors, to release the former. But, the release of Uttama Villain was unexpectedly stalled, due to the disputes between financiers and producers, which led to a loss of , and also the film's poor performance, abetting the problem, the payment owed by Eros International, was ballooned to , and insisted Lingusamy, to pay the remaining balance amount of crore to Eros. Since, Lingusamy doesn't have a huge amount to settle Eros, the film faced a delayed release, says the sources.

While the 1890s police station (which was actually the city's gaol for most of its existence) was deliberately modelled in a Queen Anne style uncommon in New Zealand but designed to imitate London's New Scotland Yard (now the Norman Shaw Buildings), the Law Courts are in decorative but stern Victorian Gothic style similar to the buildings of Dunedin's University of Otago Registry Building.McGill, D., & Sheehan, G., (1997) Landmarks: Notable historic buildings of New Zealand.

The main entrance to the court sits at the foot of a short tower which is decorated with an un-blindfolded statue of Justice in Italian white marble.

London, Bookmarks: 58 In 1897, the League created Sankt-Peterburgskiy Rabochiy Listok (, Saint Petersburg Workers' Paper). It only published two numbers, on February and on September. By the end of the 1890s the League was transporting its illegal literature through Finland and Stockholm. Transportation was organised by Hjalmar Branting, a Swedish Social-Democrat, Carder, a Norwegian Social-Democrat, and A. Weidel, a Swedish worker who settled in Finland for that purpose. But Garder's arrest in 1900 disrupted the arrangement and the route via Finland. A route running from Stockholm to √Öbo and across the Russian frontier was restarted in 1901. The group's organization contributed to the founding of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party in 1898. Lenin went on to become the leader of the Bolshevik faction of the party, while Martov became leader of the Menshevik faction, after the 2nd Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party in 1903. Alexander Malchenko abandoned revolutionary politics after returning from exile in 1900. He was later arrested in 1929 as a counter-revolutionary and shot in 1930. Afterwards his image was airbrushed out of an 1897 photo of the seven leaders of the League until his posthumous rehabilitation in 1958. With Lenin imprisoned, the League (and Rabocheye Delo) fell under the control of the Economists (Marxists who wanted the workers to stick to economic demands only, with no political demands) through their paper Rabochaya Mysl (, Workers' Thought), published 1897‚Äì1902. In the autumn of 1900, the League merged with the St. Petersburg Workers' Organisation.

Biography Billy Oskay was born and raised in Kingston, New York, where he first learned to play the violin at the age seven. In 1970, he began studying under Eugen Prokop at the International Academy of Music in Palma de Mallorca, Spain, and in 1971 earned his master's degree in music from Indiana's Ball State University. Oskay went on to head the music department at Oregon's Mt. Angel College, and later joined the swing combo Everything's Jake. In 1983, he met Irish guitarist M√≠che√°l √ì Domhnaill who was an influential figure in the Irish traditional music scene of the late 1970s and early 1980s, having performed for seven years with The Bothy Band and several years collaborating with the master fiddler Kevin Burke. Oskay and √ì Domhnaill began to collaborate on a new and innovative music that integrated traditional Irish, jazz, and classical chamber music. They composed and recorded some songs in Oskay's Portland, Oregon home and were pleased with the unique understated sound they had created, which had a \\"rough but fresh quality that engendered a serene atmosphere\\". √ì Domhnaill secured a contract with William Ackerman at Windham Hill Records, and the tracks he and Oskay had recorded in Portland were mixed and released in 1984 under the title Nightnoise. In 1987, Oskay and √ì Domhnaill were joined by M√≠che√°l's sister, Irish pianist and vocalist Tr√≠ona N√≠ Dhomhnaill, and Irish-American flutist Brian Dunning to found the musical group Nightnoise. Together they toured the world and recorded three additional albums: Something of Time (1987), At the End of the Evening (1988), and The Parting Tide (1990). During this time, Oskay emerged as a prolific session musician, appearing on projects by harp guitarist John Doan, bluegrass guitarist Dan Crary, and others. Oskay also produced numerous albums at his Oskay Recording studio in Portland. In 1992, Oskay left Nightnoise to focus on record production. In 1993, he purchased 26 acres of land in Corbett, Oregon, where he built the Big Red Studio from 1997 to 2000. The studio's centerpiece was a 1979 Trident TSM console, once owned by Jose Feliciano. For the past fifteen years, Oskay has produced numerous musical artists at his Big Red Studio in Corbett, including Drum Hat Buddha (2001) by Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer, Blu di Genova (2003) by Beppe Gambetta, and Renaissance of the Steel- String Guitar (2004) by Dan Crary. He still performs violin occasionally with Seattle-based singer-songwriter Jim Page.

The Kharkov socialists refused to come thinking the move premature. There were 6 sessions, with no minutes taken because of the need for secrecy; only resolutions were recorded. The major issues discussed by the delegates were merging all social democratic groups into one party and selecting the party's name.

The Central Committee elected by Congress printed the Manifesto and the resolutions of the Congress, but five of the nine delegates were arrested by the Okhrana within a month. The first Congress failed to unite the Russian Social Democracy, neither through the proposed Statutes nor the Programme. A wave of police repression followed, which prevented the party from functioning as a cohesive body for several years and ushered in a period of internal schisms and dissension. Three of the delegates weren't arrested, but only because Zubatov thought they would lead him to other members.THE CAMBRIDGE HISTORY OF RUSSIA, Volume II - Imperial Russia, 1689-1917 page 645 It was not until 1903 that the 2nd Congress of the RSDLP was held abroad and adopted the party's Charter and Programme.

Its common names include mustard aphid and turnip aphid. It is found in most temperate and tropical areas of the world and feeds only on cruciferous plants. The insects are almost exclusively female and are very prolific, with wingless females producing around one hundred young during a lifespan of a few weeks. Description The wingless female is pale green or whitish green with two rows of dark bands on the thorax and abdomen which unite into a single band near the tip of the abdomen. The antennae are dark, the legs are pale with dark joints and the cornicles are pale with dark tips. The body is faintly dusted with a white powder. It is between in length. The winged female is a similar size and has a black head and thorax and a pale green abdomen with black bands near the tip and black patches on the sides. The antennae and legs are dark, and the cornicles are black at the base and yellowish towards the tips. Wingless males have occasionally been seen; these are smaller than the females and olive-green to brownish in colour. Distribution and habitat Originally a European species, the turnip aphid is now found in most parts of the world in tropical and temperate locations. Host plants include cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, kale, kohlrabi, radish and turnip, as well as shepherd's purse, wild mustard and other cruciferous weeds. Life cycle The turnip aphid is almost entirely viviparous, although eggs have occasionally been seen. It is extremely prolific and in warm places such as Texas, a maximum of thirty-five generations per year have been recorded. The wingless females produce up to six offspring per day over a period of twenty to forty days, a total of eighty to one hundred young. Winged females are able to disperse to other plants, but produce fewer offspring. Ecology This aphid is found on older leaves of brassica plants and on the roots. It is one of several species of aphid to feed on brassicas; the cabbage aphid (Brevicoryne brassicae) feeds only on these plants, while the green peach aphid is found on many crops and plants including brassicas. The cabbage aphid can be distinguished by its waxy coating and its dense colonies on young growth, while the green peach aphid is dispersed around the brassica plant, occurring mainly on the older leaves of its host. The species can be a vector of at least ten plant viruses including cabbage black ringspot virus, radish mosaic virus, cauliflower mosaic virus and turnip mosaic virus.

SPB requires no state machine or other substantive changes to IS-IS, and simply requires a new Network Layer Protocol Identifier (NLPID) and set of TLVs. SPB allows for shortest-path forwarding in an Ethernet mesh network context utilizing multiple equal cost paths. This permits SPB to support large Layer 2 topologies, with faster convergence, and vastly improved use of the mesh topology. Combined with this is single point provisioning for logical connectivity membership. IS-IS is therefore augmented with a small number of TLVs and sub-TLVs, and supports two Ethernet encapsulating data paths, 802.1ad Provider Bridges (PB) and 802.1ah Provider Backbone Bridges (PBB). SPB is designed to run in parallel with other network layer protocols such as IPv4 and IPv6. Standards mandate that the failure of two nodes to establish an SPB adjacency will not have collateral impact, such as the rejection of an adjacency for other network layer protocols (e.g. OSPF).  Protocol Extensions  The IS-IS extensions defined in RFC 6329 to deliver standardized support for 802.1aq SPB are: * IS-IS Hello (IIH) Protocol Extensions * Node Information Extensions * Adjacency Information Extensions * Service Information Extensions = IS-IS Hello (IIH) Protocol Extensions = 802.1aq has been designed to operate in parallel with other network layer protocols such as IPv4 and IPv6; therefore, failure of two nodes to establish an SPB adjacency will not cause network layer protocols to also reject an adjacency. 802.1aq has been assigned the Network Layer Protocol ID (NLPID) value 0xC1, as per RFC 6328, and is used by SPB Bridges to indicate their ability to form adjacencies and operate as part of a 802.1aq domain. 802.1aq frames flow on adjacencies that advertise this NLPID in both directions, and nodes regard an adjacency that has not advertised in both directions as non- existent (infinite link metric). 802.1aq augments the normal IIH PDU with three new TLVs, which like all other SPB TLVs, travel within Multi-Topology TLVs, therefore allowing multiple logical instances of SPB within a single IS- IS protocol instance. SPB can use many VIDs, agreeing on which VIDs are used for which purposes. The IIH PDUs carry a digest of all the used VIDs, referred to as the Multiple Spanning Tree Configuration TLV which uses a common and compact encoding reused from 802.1Q. For the purposes of loop prevention SPB neighbors may also support a mechanism to verify that the contents of their topology databases are synchronized. Exchanging digests of SPB topology information, using the optional SPB-Digest sub-TLV, allows nodes to compare information and take specific action where a mismatch in topology is indicated. Finally, SPB needs to know which Shortest Path Tree (SPT) sets are being used by which VIDs, and this is carried in the Base VLAN Identifiers TLV. = Node Information Extensions = All SPB nodal information extensions travel within a new Multi-Topology (MT) capability TLV. There can be one or many MT-Capability TLVs present, depending on the amount of information that needs to be carried. The SPB Instance sub-TLV gives the Shortest Path Source ID (SPSourceID) for this node/topology instance. This used in the formation of Multicast Destination Addresses (DAs) for frames originating from this node/instance. There are multiple ECT algorithms defined for SPB; however, for the future, additional algorithms may be defined, including but not limited to ECMP- or hash-based behaviors and (*,G) Multicast trees. These algorithms will use this optional TLV to define new algorithm parametric data. For tie- breaking parameters, there are two broad classes of algorithm, one that uses nodal data to break ties and one that uses link data to break ties. The SPB Instance Opaque Equal cost Tree Algorithm TLV is used to associate opaque tie- breaking data with a node. = Adjacency Information Extensions = The SPB Link Metric sub-TLV occurs within the Multi-Topology Intermediate System Neighbor TLV or within the Extended IS Reachability TLV. Where this sub-TLV is not present for an IS-IS adjacency, then that adjacency will not carry SPB traffic for the given topology instance. There are multiple ECT algorithms defined for SPB; however, for the future, additional algorithms may be defined; similarly the SPB Adjacency Opaque Equal Cost Tree Algorithm TLV also occurs within the Multi-Topology Intermediate System TLV or the Extended IS Reachability TLV. = Service Information Extensions = The SPBM' Service Identifier and Unicast Address TLV is used to introduce service group membership on the originating node and/or to advertise an additional B-MAC Unicast Address present on, or reachable by the node. The SPBV' MAC Address TLV is the IS-IS sub-TLV used for advertisement of Group MAC Addresses in SPBV mode.

Another reservoir, the new Erinle Dam, lies higher up the river. Water from the two dams supplies Osogbo, the state capital. There are significant health issues with the untreated and treated water. Name In the Yoruba tradition, Erinle was a great hunter who became an orisha. He is said to have conducted the first Olobu of Ilobu to the site of the town of Ilobu, and to have protected the people of the town from Fulani invasions. He is usually described as a hunter but sometimes as a herbalist or a farmer. It is said that one day he sank into the earth near Ilobu and became a river. He is known all over Yor√πb√°land. The cult of Erinle is found in towns throughout the former Oyo Empire. His shrines contain smooth, round stones from the Erinle River. The name may be derived from erin (elephant) and il·∫π (earth), or from erin and ile (house). Course The Erinle River rises just south of Offa. It and the Oba River which rises about north of Ogbomosho, are the main tributaries of the Osun River. The Erinle River has residential, commercial and industrial areas on both sides, which as of 2012 released untreated waste into the river. It was also polluted by excess fertilizers and pesticides from farmland. The old and new dams on the river supply water to Osogbo, the state capital, which also uses boreholes and wells to obtain water.

Process network synthesis uses a bipartite graph method P-graphP-graph method and employs combinatorial rules to find all feasible network solutions (maximum structure) and links raw materials to desired products related to the given problem. With a branch and bound optimisation routine and by defining the target value an optimum structure can be generated that optimises a chosen target function. Process Network Synthesis was originally developed to solve chemical process engineering processes. Target value as well as the structure can be changed depending on the field of application. Thus many more fields of application followed. Applications At Pannon University software the tools PNS Editor and PNS Studio were programmed to generate maximum structure of processes. This software includes the p-graph method and MSG, SSG and ABB branch and bound algorithms to detect optimum structures within the maximum available process flows. PNS is used in different applications where it can be used to find optimum process structures like: * Process engineering: Chemical process designs and the Synthesis of chemical processes is applied in different case studies. * Optimum energy technology networks for regional and urban energy systems: In case of regional and urban energy planning the financially most feasible solution for resource systems is selected as target value. With this setting material- and energy flows, energy demand and cost of technologies are considered and the optimum technology network can be found. Simultaneously the robustness of technologies due to price changes and limitations in resource availability can be identified. * Evacuation routes in buildings: The aim is to find optimal routes to evacuate buildings depending on specific side parameters. * Transportation routes: In this research area transportation routes with minimum cost and lowest environmental impact can be identified.

The range is named after a confederation of nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes, all of which claim to hail from Arab ancestors that arrived in the mountains in the eleventh century. Geography The Ouled Na√Øl mountain range is formed by parallel ridges rising between the level 850 m high terrain of the Hodna region of the Hautes Plaines in the north and the 600 m of the southern plain of the Dayas. It is located in the eastern zone of the Saharan Atlas, with the Amour Range in the western and the Zab Range at the eastern end. The range is formed by mountains created by folds of the early Tertiary which remained relatively undisturbed after formation but have been heavily eroded. Their altitude is relatively moderate, the highest point of the range, Djebel Lazrag (ÿ¨ÿ®ŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿ£ÿ≤ÿ±ŸÇ), not even reaching 1,500 m. However, towards the south the look of the highest ridges is quite spectacular, with jagged sandstone or limestone outcrops and almost vertical walls. The part facing the Sahara has a less encumbered terrain with smooth mountaintops separated by water gaps.G√©ographie de l'Afrique du Nord - L'Atlas Saharien The climate is dry in all the surrounding areas, but the rainfall is slightly better on the mountains. Therefore, cereal cultivation is possible in the heights, although with rather irregular results.√âtude de la situation m√©t√©orologique au Sahara en janvier 1958 Date palms are mostly absent throughout the range owing to the prevailing cold temperatures. They only grow in the few places at the feet of the Ouled Na√Øl mountains that are at an altitude below 600 m, such as near Bou Saada and the Oued Djedi. Human presence Two important towns are located in the immediate area of the range, Bou-Saada to the north at the feet of the mountains and Djelfa in the middle of the range at an elevation of 1,208 m. North of Djelfa town there is an imposing physical feature known as Rocher de Sel (English: Salt Rock) that was formed from the erosion of rock salts and marls by rain. To the west of the town Megalithic funerary structures are found. Neolithic art is widespread in different caves and walls throughout the range.Henri Lhote, F. de Villaret, Les gravures rupestres de l'Atlas saharien: monts des Ouled-Nail et r√©gion de Djelfa. 1984 The range is well known for the Ouled Na√Øl people living in its cold highlands. Djelfa is an important market centre for the Ouled Na√Øl who live in black-and-red striped tents and claim ancient Arab descent. These semi-nomadic or nomadic people have traditionally reared cattle in the mountain grasslands.A Different Perspective of Algeria The years of drought and years with prolonged, cold winters are hard times for the Ouled Nail; in 1944 and 1947 about 50% of their livestock died.

It was released on February 11, 1977, by Paramount Pictures. The film was based on Gardner's Broadway play, and has almost the same cast, with the main exception being that Charles Grodin is playing Martin rather than Richard Mulligan, though Grodin directed and produced the play. Plot School principal Martin Cramer and schoolteacher Sally are a married couple in their 30s who are stuck in a rut. Their Upper East Side apartment is mostly unfurnished five weeks after they moved from Orchard Street because Sally forgot the name of the moving company. Sally wants to bring a juvenile delinquent student of hers named Carlton in to live with them, but Martin reminds her that the boy stole from him the last time they took him in. Sally laments that Martin is no longer the idealistic person he once was. When Sally says it is time they have a child of their own, Martin tells her to go to sleep. A week later, Sally, who is pregnant, initiates divorce proceedings and then leaves to stay with a friend while she considers getting an abortion. Sally phones Gordon, a man she met in the park, and Gordon invites her to his apartment. After a pleasant conversation Gordon reveals he is married with children to a woman who will not give him a divorce and they decide they would be better off as friends. Meanwhile, Martin makes love to a neighbor, Nancy. Sally returns home to find that Carlton, who stole keys from the building's doorman Devlin, is stashing stolen goods in the apartment. He offers her the loot in exchange for a passing grade, but Sally offers instead to adopt Carlton if he goes straight. She learns of Martin's fling when she sees Nancy wearing Martin's sweatshirt. Martin returns to the Orchard Street apartment, where Sally eventually remembered sending their valuable antique furniture to, only to find that the current tenant sold the furniture for $40. Drinking a bottle of wine and reminiscing about his first date with Sally when the two broke into a closed Loew's movie theater, Martin breaks into the old theater again where a man named Perez tells him that the theater is now a church. Two police officers arrive to arrest Martin for breaking and entering, but Martin pulls a gun and flees. Sally visits her father Joe and asks him to accompany her to the abortion procedure, but he wants no part of it. After an impassioned speech from Sally about time being the real thief, Joe reveals that Sally was enrolled in school one year early and is 32, not 33 as she thought. He had been saving the \\"extra year\\" to give to her as a gift in his will, but decided that this was the day she needed it. Sally returns to the apartment and finds that her suitcase has been stolen and Devlin is dead. She convinces two neighbors to move his body to a lobby couch while she phones the police. Martin returns and suggests that the two consider their options. Sally begins to leave, but Martin fires his gun in the air three times and says they cannot break up until they decide who is at fault, then begs her to stay. The two kiss and decide to run off hand-in-hand from the sound of police sirens.

John Berry was fired as director five weeks into filming due to \\"mutual differences\\" with producer George Barrie. He was replaced by Gardner with Al Viola serving as standby director, but neither were given onscreen credit for directing.  Reception  Richard Eder of The New York Times wrote that the film \\"is like a windup toy whose movements are being forced by a jaded and impatient child. It has some good notions, some good jokes and some good performers. But, with rare interludes, it is wrenched and graceless.

Seed Magazine The World in Six Songs combines science and art to reveal how music shaped humanity across cultures and throughout history. This book leans more heavily on anthropology and evolutionary biology than did This Is Your Brain On Music, which skewed more toward findings in psychoacoustics and neuroscience. Levitin identifies six fundamental song functions or types (friendship, joy, comfort, religion, knowledge, and love) then shows how each in its own way has enabled the social bonding necessary for human culture and society to evolve. He shows, in effect, how these six song types function in our brains to preserve the emotional and literal history of our lives and species. Levitin illuminates, through songs, how music has been instrumental in the evolution of language, thought and culture. Musical examples ranging from Beethoven to The Beatles, Busta Rhymes to Bach, are used to support the book's propositions. Using cutting-edge scientific research from his music cognition lab at McGill University; his own experiences in the music business; and interviews with musicians such as Sting and David Byrne, as well as conductors, anthropologists, and evolutionary biologists.

Originally an Owenite, whose economic writings affected the views of Friedrich Engels, he moved to a position more in favour of capital. In later life he had a multiplicity of interests and undertook many social projects. Early life The son of James Watts, a ribbon weaver, he was born at Coventry, Warwickshire, on 24 March 1818. At five years of age he suffered partial paralysis of his left side, and could not take a manual job. After leaving elementary school, he became a member of the local Mechanics' Institution, where from age of 13 to 20 he acted as assistant secretary and librarian. He then went into trade, but adopted communist principles, and became a lecturer on Robert Owen's views. He visited many towns, and in Scotland attended lectures at the Andersonian University. In July 1841 Watts moved to Manchester. For three years he ran a boys' school in the Manchester Hall of Science, an Owenite foundation designed to hold 3000 people. He held public discussions in the district on Owen's system of society. It was at this period that Engels had contact with Watts as a lecturer. After Owen In 1844 Watts had come to the conclusion that Owen's ideal community was impracticable, and many of its adherents self-seeking; and he went into business again. On 18 July 1844 he obtained from the University of Giessen the degree of PhD In 1846 he was named by the Northern Star, the radical Chartist paper, as one of a small number of Owenites sympathetic to the aims of their movement, with George Holyoake and G. A. Fleming. In 1853 Watts was a promoter of the People's Provident Assurance Society, and went to London, returning in 1857 to be local manager in Manchester. This company was later known as the \\"European\\". By merging with unsound companies, it came to a disastrous end. Subsequently Watts wrote the first draft of a bill which was introduced into parliament and became the Life Assurance Act of 1870, which among other precautionary measures forbade the transfer or amalgamation of insurance companies without judicial authority. =Committee man= In 1845 Watts took part in a movement which led to the establishment of three public parks in Manchester and Salford. In 1847 he joined, and later was the leading advocate of, the Lancashire Public School Association, which became called the National Public School Association. It pushed for the provision of free, secular, and rate-supported schools, and had Samuel Lucas as chairman. He also joined the society for promoting the repeal of the \\"taxes on knowledge\\", and supported the efforts in parliament of Milner Gibson, Richard Cobden, and Ayrton, framing many questions, and collecting most of the specimen cases, brought up with the chancellor of the exchequer. In 1850 Watts persuaded Sir John Potter, then mayor of Manchester, to form a committee for the establishment of a free library under the provisions of Public Libraries Act 1850, which was then passing through parliament, insisting that it should he a free lending library. Watts acted as one of the secretaries of the committee that saw the Manchester Free Library opened by public subscription. The Education Aid Society of Manchester received support from him, as did also the educational section of the Social Science Congress of 1866. As a result of that conference a special committee was appointed, on whose behalf he prepared the draft of Henry Austin Bruce's education bill of 1868. He was a member of the Manchester school board from its constitution in 1870 to his death, and secretary to the Owens College extension committee, which raised funds for new building and endowment. Watts was closely associated with the co-operative movement. For a time he was a major contributor to the Co-operative News. His advice was often sought in trade disputes. Watts was also chairman of the councils of the Union of Lancashire and Cheshire Institutes, the Manchester Technical School, the Royal Botanical and Horticultural Society of Manchester, and the local provident dispensaries (which were founded on his suggestion, and with his support). He was secretary of the Manchester Reform Club, a governor of Manchester grammar school, and president of the Manchester Statistical Society, and sat on the committees of other public institutions. During the Lancashire Cotton Famine he sat as a member of the central relief committee. Death Watts died at Old Trafford, Manchester, on 7 February 1887, and was buried in the parish church of Bowdon, Cheshire. Works Watts published: *Facts and Fictions of Political Economists (1842), under the influence of Thomas Hodgskin, William Thompson, and John Francis Bray; considered an influence on the Umrisse zu einer Kritik der National√∂konomie (1844) of Engels, which argues similarly in Young Hegelian terms. The work was mentioned positively in The German Ideology. *The Facts of the Cotton Famine (1866); *The Catechism of Wages and Capital (1867). Also a large number of pamphlets, mainly on subjects such as trade-unions, strikes, co-operation, and education. He was a contributor to periodicals, and a newspaper correspondent, especially on educational and economic subjects. Family Watts married Catherine Shaw in October 1844, and left four children, three having died in his lifetime. His eldest son was W. H. S. Watts, district registrar in Manchester of the high court of justice. His daughter, Caroline Emma, married Thomas Edward Thorpe, chief government analyst.
