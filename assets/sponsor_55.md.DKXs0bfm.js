Water supply The first water supply systems which were built in Istanbul date back to the foundation of the city. Two of the greatest aqueducts built in the Roman period are the Mazulkemer Aqueduct and the Valens Aqueduct. These aqueducts were built in order to channel water from the Halkalƒ± area in the western edge of the city to the Beyazƒ±t district in the city center, which was known as the Forum Tauri in the Roman period. After reaching the city center, the water was later collected in the city's numerous cisterns, such as the famous Philoxenos (Binbirdirek) Cistern and the Basilica (Yerebatan) Cistern. Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent commissioned Mimar Sinan, his engineer and architect-in-chief, to improve the water needs of the city. Sinan constructed the Kƒ±rk√ße≈üme Water Supply System in 1555. In later years, with the aim of responding to the ever- increasing public demand, water from various springs was channeled to the public fountains by means of small supply lines; see German Fountain. Today, Istanbul has a chlorinated and filtered water supply and a sewage disposal system managed by the government agency ƒ∞SKƒ∞. There are also several private sector organizations distributing clean water. Electricity Electricity distribution services are covered by the state-owned TEK. The first electricity production plant in the city, Silahtaraƒüa Termik Santrali, was established in 1914 and continued to supply electricity until 1983. Post and telecommunications The Ottoman Ministry of Post and Telegraph was established in the city on October 23, 1840.PTT Chronology The first post office was the Postahane-i Amire near the courtyard of the New Mosque. In 1876 the first international mailing network between Istanbul and the lands beyond the vast Ottoman Empire‚Äîwhich, in that year, stretched from the borders with Austria-Hungary and Russia at north to the Ottoman provinces of Yemen and Sudan at south and Tunisia at west‚Äîwas established. In 1901 the first money transfers were made through the post offices and the first cargo services became operational. =Electric telegraph= Samuel Morse received his first ever patent for the telegraph in 1847, at the old Beylerbeyi Palace (the present Beylerbeyi Palace was built in 1861-1865 on the same location) in Istanbul, which was issued by Sultan Abd√ºlmecid I who personally tested the new invention.Istanbul City Guide: Beylerbeyi Palace Following this successful test, installation works of the first telegraph line between Istanbul and Edirne began on August 9, 1847.T√ºrk Telekom: History In 1855 the Telegraph Administration was established. =Telephone= In July 1881 the first telephone circuit in Istanbul was established between the Ministry of Post and Telegraph in Soƒüuk√ße≈üme and the Postahane-i Amire in Yenicami. On May 23, 1909, the first manual telephone exchange with a 50 line capacity was established in the B√ºy√ºk Postane (Grand Post Office) in Sirkeci. =Modern communications= The first automatic telex exchange was established in November 1973. Electronic Mail was put into service between Istanbul, Ankara, ƒ∞zmir and Adana on June 28, 1984. In November 1985 the first radio link system was put into service between Istanbul and Ankara. On October 23, 1986, mobile telephone and paging systems were put into service in Istanbul, Ankara and ƒ∞zmir. On March 4, 1987, the first ever video conference in Europe was realized in Istanbul. On February 23, 1994, GSM technology was established in the city. A nationwide Internet network and connection with the World Wide Web was established in 1996.

Background  The creative basis for the Etudes Transcendantales is Ferneyhough's mild mid-life crisis. He thought about death and what makes music more than just music of the moment, and thus the songs deal with such themes. As part of this, he wanted the ensemble to sound rather harsh. Starting from the standard modernist Pierrot ensemble, he replaced the clarinet exchanged for an oboe, the piano for a harpsichord, and removed the violin altogether. Including the voice, now all the parts are very different from each other and have strongly contrasting timbres, e.g., the pointillistic harpsichord with the smoother mezzo-soprano. Originally, Ferneyhough intended all the songs to be set to poems by the German poet Ernst Meister. However, he could not find enough suitable poems on death and permanence, and instead commissioned a poet friend, Alrun Moll, to write texts for the remaining songs.  Music  Like many other works by Ferneyhough and other New Complexity composers, Etudes Transcendantales is infamously difficult to perform and is extremely complicated. Pitch-wise, the notes are freely sampled from all 12 tones and the quarter tones in between. Rhythmically, Ferneyhough is known for his nested irregular tuplets, and there is no exception here. Almost each individual note also has its own unique dynamics and articulation, including extended techniques such as multiphonics on the oboe, glottal stops for the voice, and key-clicking for the flute. Throughout the nine songs, the process of composition transitions from a Serialist-type systematic approach in the first song to an intuitive and free approach by the last song. While Ferneyhough thought this system is important, the practical effects are not discernible to the listener, as his intuitive composition produces music like that produced by his automation methods First measure of movement 1 of Etudes Transcendantales, oboe part For example, for the oboe part in the first song, the rhythm is almost totally determined by a strict system, with five stages of complexity, each determined by another cycle of numbers: # dividing each measure into a number of notes # subdividing chunks of those notes into another layer # adding dots so that 4 notes fit where 3 did previously # tie some notes with each other and replace others with rests # replace two consecutive notes with a triplet in which one beat is a rest Each subsequent song has its own unique system (or intuitive development) for the creation of all aspects of the composition. Alternatively, if only to prove that the score is self-consistent, the rhythm can be deconstructed. The very first measure can be broken down in increasing complexity (note that the actual meter is in 2/10, but is really equivalent to a 2/8 measure at 5/4 the speed): 700px  References  * Toop, Richard (1991). \\"Brian Ferneyhough's Etudes Transcendantales: A Composer's Diary (Part 1)\\".

The character was portrayed by Ashley Hamilton in the 2013 Marvel Cinematic Universe film Iron Man 3. Fictional character biography =Jack Taggert= Jack Taggert worked on an experimental pilotable suit for Project: Firepower for Edwin Cord (a rival businessman of Tony Stark). The project was ostensibly designated by the U.S. Armed Forces, in conjunction with Senator Boynton, to serve as an ultimate deterrent against opponents of the United States. However, when Iron Man launched his \\"Armor Wars\\", attacking armored villains and even government agents without provocation, the Firepower program was modified with the specific goal of stopping Iron Man. While Taggert continued to train for the fight with Iron Man using a simulator rig, Boynton invited Tony Stark out to the first formal demonstration of the Firepower suit, believing that Iron Man would somehow find out from his \\"ex-employer\\", and hoping to lure the rogue Avenger into a trap. Stark chose to observe the tests from an SE helicopter, piloted by Jim Rhodes, thus allowing Stark to slip away as Iron Man and attack Firepower without his absence being noticed by Boynton or the military. The tests against tank and jet drones proved so devastating, however, that Rhodey suggested aborting; however, determined to destroy every last bit of Iron Man technology not under his control, Stark joined the fight. Iron Man found that the massive Firepower suit was able to withstand his attacks, and Firepower was even able to ambush Iron Man through a canyon wall. When Iron Man placed a Negator pack (the device he used to disable his armor technology) on Firepower, he was surprised to find out it didn't work - the government had studied the Negator pack that Iron Man had attempted to use on Stingray, and found a way to shield Firepower's circuits from the pack's effects. Badly damaged and wounded, Iron Man retreated to the helicopter, hoping to buy some time. However, Stark and Rhodey quickly realized that the military would consider them \\"acceptable losses\\" in stopping Iron Man, so just as Taggert was being ordered to target the chopper, Iron Man flew away. Taggert launched the \\"Terminax\\", a low-power nuclear missile, and completely destroyed the Iron Man armor, leaving its bloody bits to fall to the desert floor.Iron Man #230 Stark had faked Iron Man's death by sending out the \\"Silver Centurion\\" armor on autopilot, filled with the store of spare blood they had kept on board the chopper \\"just in case\\", so as to allow the world to believe that Iron Man was dead (Stark's injuries were blamed on the shockwave from the Terminax detonation). Stark was content to leave Iron Man dead, but it was during this time that Edwin Cord took advantage. He blackmailed Boynton and the military into allowing him to keep Firepower, threatening to reveal to the press one of Firepower's \\"true\\" purposes - riot control. Cord then used Firepower to threaten the Marsten Manufacturing group to turn down a Stark bid, to attack SE division Acutech, and to personally attack and threaten Tony Stark and his workers. Finally having had enough of Firepower, Stark locked himself inside his private laboratory to build a brand new set of armor, incorporating several improvements and new weapons, as well as the \\"classic\\" red-and-gold color scheme. Even as the new armor was completed, Firepower was attacking another Stark Enterprises-owned facility, so Stark quickly faced off against Firepower as the \\"new\\" Iron Man. Taggert, convinced that he could dispatch this new Iron Man as quickly as he did the \\"first\\", was stunned to find the Firepower armor outclassed by his opponent. Iron Man was able to defeat or neutralize all of Firepower's main weapons. In a desperate, last-ditch attempt to win, Taggert activated the Terminax to launch without a set target, hoping that Iron Man would be vaporized in the attempt to stop or redirect the missile. However, the launcher backpack that housed the missile had been damaged by Iron Man's pulse bolts, trapping the Terminax and threatening everybody in the vicinity. Taggert pleaded with Iron Man to free him from the armor, but Iron Man told him that if the armor was magnetically sealed, there was nothing he could do to free him. Iron Man used an electromagnetic pulse - a trick learned from Force - to disable the Firepower armor (and his own) for six minutes. This bought Iron Man enough time to find a way to shut down the nuke's timer once the armors' systems came back online. Upon reboot, the timer had nine seconds left; Iron Man successfully stopped it in eight. Taggert, now no longer fearing being blown up, told Iron Man that there would be others just like him that would be out to kill Iron Man just as he had and destroy Stark Enterprises, whereupon Iron Man ripped the Firepower armor apart, stunning Taggert into acquiescence. Taggert and Cord were taken into custody, while Stark decided that the world still needed an Iron Man.Iron Man #231 Taggert later resurfaces where he pilots a new Firepower armor given to him by Mandarin when he is recruited to help Iron Man's other enemies defeat Iron Man. =David Roberts= A second Firepower is a government official named David Roberts who was sent to bring down Atom-Smasher, an eco-terrorist who had sought to make illegal dumping grounds on a property owned by Stane International (used for government projects) and came to the attention of the media, prompting high-ranking government officials, fearing a scandal, to order Atom Smasher eliminated. Sleeker than the original, this Firepower actually has fewer weapons but seems to pack a harder punch with them. Firepower engaged Atom Smasher and was holding his own. Then, War Machine decided to end the fight with an EMP blast that rendered both inoperable until their systems rebooted. Since Firepower's auto reboots after 14 minutes while War Machine's rebooted in 6 minutes, Rhodes carried the suit out to the army detail outside of the Stane Facility and ordered them off the property.Iron Man #288 Powers and abilities Firepower‚Äôs armor provides him with a high degree of protection from energy and physical attacks. His strength, reflexes and endurance have all been enhanced by his armor and he can fly at sub-sonic speeds. The suit is also air conditioned to prevent discomfort for the operator. The Firepower armor contains a vast array of sensors and an impressive array of weapons including four back-mounted surface-to-air missiles (and additional missiles mounted on leg hardpoints), chest-mounted heat beam lasers, mini-grenades and arm-mounted concussive cannons. The armor can also fire a small tactical nuclear missile known as Terminax from a back- mounted launch tube. Described as a \\"two-ton tuxedo\\" by Jack Taggart, the suit was extremely large and its wearer had to be lifted into it with a special crane. Other versions In Ultimate Comics: Armor Wars, the Ultimate Universe version of Armor Wars, Firepower is the codename for a London Metropolitan Police riot squad in power armor based on Ultimate Iron Man's stolen technology. Iron Man intervenes when the Firepower armor is used against peaceful protesters, and with Justine Hammer's help provides the British Government with proof that the designs the Government purchased were stolen, leading to them being recalled. The Ultimate Firepower armor has a striking resemblance to the Mark VI MJOLNIR armor from the Halo series.Ultimate Comics: Armor Wars #3 In other media =Television= * Firepower appears in the Iron Man animated series two-part episode \\"Armor Wars\\", voiced by Efrem Zimbalist, Jr..

Born and raised in Sussex, South East England, his career in perfumery began in 1981 when he joined the French perfume house Guerlain, working there for 20 years before leaving to set up his own companies RDPR and then Roja Parfums. Early life Dove's interest in fragrance was sparked at an early age when his mother kissed him goodnight; as she lowered her head to kiss him, he was aware that her fragrance lingered in his room long after she had gone, keeping the image of her cocktail dress and the kiss alive. This interest developed whilst Dove grew up, as a teenager he spent his money purchasing small bottles of scent and was impressed that the tiny containers could contain such an overwhelming effect. Following his school days, Dove went up to University of Cambridge to study medicine. Whilst studying there he celebrated his 21st birthday with a visit to the Guerlain Boutique on the Champs-Elys√©es.It was then that he started working at Joshua Taylor‚Äôs, a Cambridge department store. He worked in the male fashion boutique of Taylor‚Äôs known as the Peacock. Following this, Dove dropped out of university to pursue a career in perfumery and with Guerlain. Time at Guerlain In Dove's enthusiasm for learning more following his trip to the Guerlain boutique, he frequently wrote to classic French perfumers requesting information and experience. Eventually, pestered but impressed by Dove's interest, Robert Guerlain offered him a position. In 1981 Dove was recruited into the Training and Public Relations Department where he began to consolidate a professional understanding for the industry. Dove remained with Guerlain for nearly 20 years; after a number of years he was given the position of Global Ambassador, the first non-Guerlain family member to be given the role. He was dubbed \\"Professeur de Parfum\\". RDPR Limited After two decades with Guerlain, Dove left the house to set up his own public relations firm RDPR Limited, with a head office based in his hometown of Brighton. The Roja Dove Haute Parfumerie In 2004 the Roja Dove Haute Parfumerie opened on the sixth floor of Harrods in conjunction with Urban Retreat. \\"Physically, it is going to be a sensual haven‚Ä¶ Silks and satins, lots of glass, mirror and crystal, as well as the black lacquer, give the salon the air of an exotic boudoir\\". Since it opened in 2004 the Haute Parfumerie has stocked scents from many famous and unfamiliar brands including Tom Ford, Caron, Lalique, Xerjoff, Dior, Atelier Flou, Clive Christian, and Grossmith. Dove received requests from customers to smell ‚ÄòRoja Dove‚Äô creations. Previously, in 2002, Dove joined names like Manolo Blahnik in donating prizes for the annual Terrence Higgins Trust fundraiser, the perfumer created a bespoke scent for the highest bidder contained within a Baccarat crystal presentation bottle. In 2005, Dove drew inspiration from this event and created a range of semi-bespoke fragrances for customers of the Haute Parfumerie to purchase; however these scents come without bottles, names, and with only enough liquid to make 50 of each. Other work Within the perfume industry itself, Dove has been actively involved with The Fragrance Foundation, The Jasmine Awards and The Cosmetics Perfumer Retailers Association. Dove has written for a range of titles including Vogue, The Times, Vanity Fair, and Wallpaper on subjects such as perfume, celebrity fragrances, classic favorites, or even the ‚ÄòSmells of London‚Äô. Dove has also given lectures and spoken at charity events for The Barbican, The Science Museum, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. In 2010 Dove worked closely with the Victoria and Albert Museum for their exhibition Diaghilev and the Golden Age of the Ballets Russes, which ran from 25 September 2010 to 9 January 2011, where he created an accompanying fragrance named ‚ÄòDiaghilev‚Äô and gave an evening lecture upon 1920s Parisian society and perfume. With regards to new initiatives, in 2007 Dove teamed up with BA Highlife Shop, the British Airways onboard retail publication for duty-free products, as their regular fragrance expert. Then in 2009 Dove began to work with World Duty Free to create an online resource to help the user discover their ideal scent; www.discoverfragrance.com (currently out of business). Shortly after Dove collaborated with The Macallan Scottish whiskey house where the perfumer created a new way of experiencing whiskey; using an odour profiling technique referred to now as The Macallan Aroma Box. =List of collaborations= *2005, Hardy Amies, Hardy Amies *2006, Kelly Hoppen Candle *2009, 6, Pierre de Velay *2009, 11, Pierre de Velay *2009, 23, Pierre de Velay *2010, Blessings, Belinda Brown *2010, M, Puredistance *2010, Buzz, The Sun *2010, Diaghilev, The Victoria and Albert Museum *2011, Four Seasons Amenities, Four Seasons Park Lane London Roja Parfums Following on from his bespoke fragrance experience Dove decided to present his own fragrance range.

In 2011, the existing Roja Dove line became Roja Perfumes. Simultaneously, following two years of research, the first Roja Parfums candle 'Neroli' was released. The same year Roja Parfums was introduced to the Black Hall Perfumery in Harrods, alongside fragrance houses such as Chanel.

Queen was raised in North Carolina, the son of an ATF agent. He served in the United States Army during the Vietnam War, before joining the police. He then moved to the United States Border Patrol, and subsequently the ATF. Early operations involved infiltrating the Aryan Nation and the Ku Klux Klan, two white supremacist organizations. In early 1998, as part of an operation to infiltrate motorcycle gangs, Queen joined the San Fernando Valley chapter of the Mongols as \\"Billy St. John\\", and was a member for 28 months. Despite his nickname, \\"Billy the Slow-Brain\\", he was successful within the ranks of bikers, even holding the position of secretary/treasurer, and then chapter vice-president. Based on the evidence he gathered while in these positions, a series of raids on May 19, 2000 by almost 700 lawmen in four states led to the arrest and indictment of 54 gang members (53 were convicted, one took the fall for a brother, and so the second party's charges were dropped). The ATF later described Queen's time undercover as \\"its most successful [biker gang] penetration.\\" Queen was awarded the Federal Bar Association's Medal of Honor for his successful involvement with the Mongols. After the trials of the gang members, Queen retired from the ATF, and wrote Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang. In 2003, while it was still only a draft, film rights to the book were sold to Icon, the Hollywood production company owned by Mel Gibson. The book became a bestseller upon its release in 2005. Queen was also heavily featured in a 2008 episode of Outlaw Bikers, a series of National Geographic documentaries about federal agents infiltrating biker gangs.

Joan became more popular in the early to mid-20th century, when it was ranked in the top 500 most popular names given to girls in the United States, but the name has again been displaced by Jane on the popularity charts in the 21st century.

It was built 1798-1802, and has seen a number of uses during the school's long history. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. Description and history Massachusetts Hall is located at the northern end of the Bowdoin Campus, just south of Bath Street and east of Memorial Hall, home to the Pickard Theatre. It is a three-story red-brick structure, with a hip roof and granite trim elements, and a 2-1/2 story ell extending to one side. The main block measures , and is five bays wide, with a central entrance flanked by pilasters and topped by a half-round transom and cornice. The building's third-floor windows are smaller, a typical Federal period feature. Bowdoin College was chartered in 1794, and its leadership authorized construction of its first building in 1798. Construction began that year, but was brought to a halt by a lack of funding. The college trustees sold off land elsewhere in Maine to fund its completion, and it was dedicated in 1802. At first, it housed both students and the family of the first president, Joseph McKeen. In 1803 the president's quarters (roughly the eastern half of the first two floors) were converted into laboratory and lecture spaces on the first floor, and student rooms on the second. This lecture space was used by Parker Cleaveland until 1859. In 1872-73 the interior underwent a major alteration, converting the upper two floors into a single large hall, which was used to house a museum of artifacts related to Cleaveland. In 1936-37 architect Felix A. Burton oversaw another major rehabilitation, which including restoration of the exterior to its original configuration, and the interior to its present state.

Early life and education Nathaniel Micklem was born at Cookham in Berkshire, the son of solicitor, Thomas Micklem and his first wife, Louisa Deane. He was educated at Mill Hill School and New College, Oxford where he took a first in Jurisprudence in 1877. In 1880 Micklem was the only student gaining a first in British Civil Law. While at Oxford he was president of the Union in 1878 and rowed or coxed for New College for two years. He also studied at University College, London gaining BA and LL.B (Exhibition) degrees before being elected a Fellow there in 1881.The Times, 20 March 1954 Law career Also in 1881, Micklem was called to the Bar at Lincoln's Inn.The Times, 30 June 1881 He obtained a large junior practice and took silk in early 1900 becoming Queen's Counsel as Victoria was still on the throne. He was one of only two men to be Queen's Counsel in two reigns as he was still living at the accession to the throne of Queen Elizabeth II in 1952 (the other being Viscount Cecil). He maintained his law practice until 1924 when he retired. He was a Bencher of Lincoln's Inn and acted as Treasurer there in 1930. He was also a member of the Bar Council. Politics Micklem was elected Member of Parliament for Watford, also known as Hertfordshire West, at the Liberal landslide election of 1906, the first time a non-Conservative had ever held the seat.The Times, 27 January 1910 At the previous general election in 1900 the Conservative candidate, Frederick Halsey had been unopposed but Micklem defeated Halsey by 7613 votes to 6136, a majority of 1476.The Times, 25 January 1906 However the Unionists regained the seat at the January 1910 general election winning by a majority of 1551. At this election the Unionists had dubbed Micklem a \\"Radical-Socialist\\" and despite Micklem claiming to be proud of the description it is likely it hurt him, especially in the strongly Unionist agricultural parts of the division. Micklem stood again at the December 1910 general election reducing the Tory majority but not sufficiently to re-take the seat.The Times, 9 December 1910 From 1924 he was a member of the Royal Commission on Lunacy and Mental Disorder and succeeded Hugh Macmillan, Baron Macmillan as chairman in 1930.

It was founded as part of the evangelizing mission of the Order of the Augustinians by the Province of Our Lady of Grace of Peru. History The School began operating on March 15, 1903, under the direction of Fr Ignacio Monasterio. Its first location was the Convent of Nuestra Se√±ora de Gracia, commonly known as \\"St. Augustine\\" on Ica Street in downtown Lima. The initial teaching staff consisted of 8 clergymen and the student population was fifty-two (52). The school ran a boarding school until 1920 with a capacity for about eighty (80) students. The school remained in its original location for 52 years until 1955; that year, authorized by R. M. (Education Ministry Decree) No. 1369 of February 16, 1955, the school was moved to its current campus located at the intersection of Avenida Javier Prado and Paseo de la Republica, in the San Isidro district. On December 21, 1958, the solemn blessing and opening of the college chapel took place. At the same time the section dedicated to the early grades was opened, this area is currently occupied by the 3rd and 4th grades of primary school. In 1959 the School Library was inaugurated. In 1969 the Great Coliseum, which seats some 3000 spectators, was opened. Pre-kinder was reinstated in 1985, under the name 'Initial Education'. In 1978, during the celebration of its Diamond Jubilee, the school was inducted in the Ministry of Education's Honor Registry. In 1992, the school went co-educational; it had been an all-male school until then. Co-ed education started with the earliest grade in 1993; the first co-ed class graduated in 2004. The school expansion has continued within the confines of the San Isidro campus, a brand new auditorium for 1148 spectators was opened on June 30, 2001, adding a new all- purpose venue to the city of Lima.

Main characters =Kenan Rockmore (Kenan Thompson)= Kenan is the oldest child of Roger Rockmore and Sheryl Rockmore. He is Kyra's older brother and Kel's best friend. Kenan is relatively intelligent, but he hardly does any schoolwork. Instead, he spends his time getting in trouble and plotting schemes (such as transforming the grocery store at which he works into a nightclub, trying to get a car, or telling everybody that Kel has extra- sensory perception). Despite being good-natured, he tends to use his intelligence to frequently annoy his parents and boss. A trait that Kenan shares with Kel is that when someone uttered a nonsense word, the duo would repeat the word confusingly. In one episode, Kenan said the word huckleberry. This prompted Kenan's boss Chris and Kel to repeat the word confusingly. Kel also taught their adopted chimpanzee from the local zoo to do the same thing. His catchphrase is \\"WHYYYYYY?!\\" and he usually yells it when Kel does something wrong or he will angrily say, \\"Kel!\\". He also passes out when something good or bad happens to him due to being overwhelmed. He is shown to be very physically strong, being able to break an iron handcuff, destroy a block of cement punching it, and even removing a steel bar off a concrete wall with his might. Kenan also has a habit of yelling from across the room. Age: 16 (Season 1), 17 (Season 2), 18 (Season 3) and 19 (Season 4) = Kel Kimble (Kel Mitchell)= Kel is the slightly dim-witted and clumsy best friend of Kenan Rockmore. In fact, his impulsive, usually lack of attention, na√Øvety and strange behavior, make Kel to be accident-prone, might being able to create the biggest disaster with the most ordinary things and actions. But despite this, Kel is actually highly intelligent as witnessed by his IQ test score, but this does not show in his everyday life. He loves orange soda (which he professes by talking in the third person: \\"Who loves orange soda? Kelllll loves orange soda. Is it true? Mm-hmm! I do, I do, I do-ooooh!\\") and never pays for the soda he drinks at Kenan's place of business, Rigby's. In the episode \\"Who Loves Orange Soda\\", it is revealed that his steady diet for orange soda have caused his insides to be \\"Bright Orange\\". Since Kel's parents (who have never appeared on the show, though mentioned several times) are rich, busy scientists, he often visits and stays in Kenan's home to keep him company. Kel also tries to avoid Kenan's little sister, Kyra, who has a crush on him, but later on in the series, Kel feels more comfortable around Kyra. Kel also manages to get on Kenan's dad's bad side with his clumsy behavior and is always forced to go home. He might resist following Kenan's schemes at first, but ultimately he is included anyway and Kel somehow usually ruins them, although there are a few episodes that end on a high note. Despite being clumsy, Kel is also an incredible painter, an excellent violinist, and a rapper and does very well in school (unlike Kenan). He is always wearing a hat during the course of the series. He is scared of pancakes, butterflies, brassieres, flying, Berlin and monkeys. His catchphrase is \\"AWWWW, HERE IT GOES!\\" which he says right before the start of the show, and right at the end of the show. At the end of the first part of a 2-part episode, Kel would say, \\"AWWW, TO BE CONTINUED...\\", as the words, \\"TO BE CONTINUED...\\", would appear on the screen. Age: 16 (Season 1), 17 (Season 2), 18 (Season 3) and 19 (Season 4) =Roger Rockmore (Ken Foree)= Roger is Kenan and Kyra's father. Roger is a very tall, stern and intimidating father with a big bald head, with a deep bass like voice. Although he is incredibly strict, he is mostly shown to be quite fair to his son. He works at O'Hare Airport as an air traffic controller, and is the only Rockmore who dislikes Kel. This is mostly due to the fact that Kel often makes a sarcastic remark about Roger's baldness and short-tempered attitude and tends to injure him and damage the Rockmore house during his visits. He usually tolerates Kel's presence, due to his friendship with Kenan, but he has been prone to get mad with Kel when he goes too far in his stupid actions. In the episode, Get the Kel Out of Here, Roger bans Kel for good from his house after Kel almost killed him, refusing to listen or forgive him (In the finale of the same episode, Kenan added that the only reason that Roger allows Kel to come back to his house is because he jumped out of the bedroom window after Kel, hit a tree with force, and forgot all that happened). Though he's a caring father, Roger has little to no patience with Kenan's schemes and punished his oldest child multiple times as a result of his troublemaking. In addition, Roger usually ends up having to pay for Kenan and Kel's mishaps, such as fixing the Crams' house or repairing the glass display at the jewelry store. He hates spending money and is also grumpy, especially with Kenan's schemes and Kel's accidents. He has also been shown to be a sore-loser because he nearly always wins games. =Sheryl Rockmore (Teal Marchande)= Sheryl is Kenan and Kyra's mother. Sheryl is kind and always seems to know what schemes Kenan and Kel are up to. She is also much more patient with Kel than her husband. Sheryl is much more of a listener than a punisher; she'd rather talk out problems with Kenan than punish him, though she has demonstrated her anger in several episodes. =Kyra Rockmore (Vanessa Baden)= Kyra is Kenan's younger sister. Kyra's biggest mission is telling on her brother Kenan, but she has devoted herself to Kel, having a major crush on him. Kel being aware of Kyra's crush on him, tries to get far away as possible from her. But this helps Kenan, so Kel convinces her to help them. For most of seasons three and four, Kyra did not appear, even in scenes showing the whole family; she did, however, appear in the series' finale TV movie. She often interrupts Kenan by saying \\"I was talking to Kel!\\". Age: 10 (Season 1), 10 (Season 2), 12 (Season 3), and 13 (Season 4) =Christopher \\"Chris\\" Potter (Dan Frischman)= Chris is Kenan's boss, friend and the owner of the local grocery store, Rigby's. He lives with his unseen mother, (or the other way around) and most of his personal life involves taking care of her as she is an extremely unhealthy woman with an unorthodox lifestyle (attending lumberjack school for example). Chris is usually Kenan and Kel's mentor and friend on the show, but sometimes he is annoyed by their antics and Kenan's schemes. Chris is dedicated to his store but becomes annoyed when Kel takes so many things (mostly orange soda) without paying. This once prompted Chris to put a chain lock on the orange soda cooler until Kel began paying for orange soda. But he only did that once and let Kel drink all the orange soda he wants like he always does. He also has frequent nightmares of being chased by a giant rabbit, as well as an irrational phobia of sandwiches. Chris is sometimes caught in the middle of some of Kenan's schemes and may sometimes get hurt. One of his catchphrases is \\"I have a radio in my car!\\" Chris usually uses nonsense words, and in earlier seasons, had a quirk of adding the \\"be\\" sound before certain words in his sentences, such as telling Kel, \\"You be- bruised my bananas!\\", usually leaving Kenan and Kel confused but the quirk was phased out as the series progressed. Chris had a mullet in the first few episodes of the series but kept a much shorter hairstyle for the rest of the series. Recurring characters =Sharla Morrison (Alexis Fields)= Sharla was introduced as a new employee at Rigby's at the start of season three. In the show, Chris hired her because he felt Kenan needed more help around the store. A recurring joke in episodes featuring her is her criticizing, mocking, insulting, or just plain annoying Kenan (and sometimes, but not always, Kel), who would do the same back at her. While there, Sharla started to develop a crush on Kenan, and he developed a crush on her. Her teacher, Miss Horn was portrayed by her real-life sister, Kim Fields. =Marc Cram (Biagio Messina)= Marc was introduced in season three as a new neighbor of Kenan. Kenan finds him annoying while Kel is buddies with him, much to Kenan's greater annoyance. After a few episodes, Kenan becomes friends with him once he got to know him. Marc is characterized as a stereotypical geek, He was an avid collector of watches, and excelled at spelling, at times during conversation never mentioning a word by its name, but spelling it out (one such line is, \\"It looks G-R-E-A-T!\\"). His name is also a palindrome. In stark contrast to his \\"geek\\" personality, he is not socially awkward, in fact everyone else seems to like Marc with the exception of the principal and many of the other teachers who, like Kenan, seem irritated by his cheerfulness. In addition Marc always calls Chris Mr. Potter. =Mrs. Quagmire (Doreen Weese)= Mrs. Ethyl Quagmire was introduced in season one as a British elderly customer at Rigby's. The character provided some light relief to the show during serious events, and has also \\"beaten up\\" Chris Potter on several occasions. In a season one episode Diamonds Are For Roger, Chris thought that Quagmire stole a tin of peanuts; following this, she \\"sucker-punched\\" him and called him a \\"Weasel\\". In the season two episode The Lottery, she entered the store hoping to purchase a lottery ticket, but Potter said the store was closing. She then held him against the door, again calling him a \\"Weasel\\". The character disappeared in season three after she moved to the UK in a city known as Birmingham (Small Heath), but she returned in season four. =Principal Dimly (Hersha Parady)= Principal Dimly was the principal at Kenan & Kel's high school. She appeared in three episodes, notably in seasons 2 and 3. The first episode she appeared in she called Kenan and his parents to her office to discuss his school work, not knowing that she was meeting with actors posing as his parents. The next episode she appeared in she caught Kel cutting class. In her third and final appearance, Kenan drew a funny picture of her which says \\"Principal Dimwit\\" which she gave Kenan a warning in an unseen scene after when Kel accidentally revealed it to her. =Dave (Tim Powell)= Dave was the surly delivery man at Rigbys. He appeared in several episodes, mainly in the first season. He was always seen wearing a uniform, and often responded with dry sarcastic barbs to any comment made by Chris. Minor characters =Brianna (Jill Burgess Noelsaint)= Brianna was a girl that Kenan had a crush on during season one. She first appeared in the episode Doing Things the Hemingway, where Kenan hung a banner declaring his love for her. She later appeared in Mo' Sweater Blues, where Kel accidentally ruined her special sweater while Kenan was on a date with her. =Miss Horn (Kim Fields)= Miss Horn was a substitute teacher and current principal at Kenan & Kel's high school. She appeared in 2 episodes, the first one being the season 2 episode The Crush, where Kel thought she had a crush on Kenan. She later reappeared in the Season 4 episode The Graduates as the principal of Capone High School, where she banned Kenan from the graduation ceremony after a senior prank went horribly wrong. Mostly she would give Kenan detention, but Kel opened his big mouth and the main reason why Kenan banned from graduation. Kenan and Kel ruined the graduation ceremony and banned from the school for good. She has a boyfriend named Kevin, who looks similar to Kenan (even Kel thinks so). Her student, Sharla was portrayed by her real-life sister, Alexis Fields. =Eric (Mystro Clark)= Eric is Kenan and Kyra's cousin, and Roger and Sheryl's nephew. He was first introduced in the season 4 episode, The Honeymoons Over, where Kenan went to his house to get some privacy from his parents. He later appeared in the episode Girl Watchers, where Kenan & Kel were supposed to pick up his girlfriend from the airport. However, they ended up picking up the wrong girl. =The Old Lady (Loretta Jean)= The Old Lady, who was never named, was a recurring customer at Rigby's, introduced in season 3 as a replacement for Doreen Weese's character Mrs. Quagmire. She would often come in and ask Kenan ridiculous questions such as \\"Excuse me young man, is it cold outside?\\" (when she had just come in from outside) or make him explain simple details about apples that were already displayed. Her catchphrase is \\"I (pronounced \\"ah\\") see!\\" She is also revealed to be Kel's secret admirer in one episode (after sending him several gifts such as a huge bottle of orange soda).

The measurement is most commonly used by design professionals, such as architectural color consultants, architects, environmental graphic designers and interior designers. LRVs are frequently reported on paint chips or paint samples. The values are used by lighting designers to determine the number and type of light fixtures needed to provide proper lighting for interior spaces. Guidance Designers of buildings must comply with the building codes applicable to the structure under consideration. Since 2004 guidance has existed on access to and use of buildings. The guidance is particularly concerned with provisions to assist the disabled, including those who are visually impaired. The guidance highlights the need for certain surfaces and features to contrast visually with their surroundings. Areas of particular interest are wall-to-ceiling and wall-to-floor junctions, exposed edges of sloping floors, seating and its surroundings, leading edges of doors, door opening furniture and door surfaces, sanitary fittings and grab bars. This is relevant to a wide range of non-residential buildings, such as hospitals, schools, hotels, and theatres. Codes of practice Color contrast may be determined by the formula [(B1 ‚àí B2) / B1] √ó 100, where B1 is the LRV of the lighter area, and B2 is the LRV of a darker area The British Standards Institute's guidance in the Regulations and in the relevant Codes of Practice, BS 8300:2009, is that adequate visual contrast is provided if the light reflectance values of the contrasting areas differ by at least thirty points.

Because of its architectural character and its importance in the life of the city and history of U.S. Route 66, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. (includes 14 photographs from 2001) History The National Bank of Rolla (1870s-1933) occupied the northwest corner of the first floor and the Edwin Long Hotel (1931-1970s) had the remainder of the building. The basement level served as the College Inn banquet hall, with a capacity of 350. The hotel had 75 guest rooms and the Edwin Long Coffee Shop for daily dining. The hotel was located adjacent to the historic U.S. Route 66, which ran directly through Rolla, MO on 8th Street. Daily room rates were $2.00 for a single bed and $3.00 for a double bed, with each room's having a tub shower and radiant heat. The Edwin Long Hotel operated from 1931 until the early 1970s, when the building was purchased by the Phelps County Bank for the headquarters of its banking operation. The hotel's business slowly declined after U.S. Route 66 (now I-44) was rerouted in the late 1950s from downtown to the northern outskirts of Rolla. The First National Bank of Rolla was liquidated in 1933 during the Great Depression. Rolla State Bank, which took over the bank space, occupied the northwest corner of the first floor of the building until 1963. Phelps County Bank then took over the entire building. It has continued to operate in the same location. Phelps County Bank restored the building's exterior in 2001. It occupies the entire building, using the first floor for the bank service lobby, the second floor for the loan department, third floor for bookkeeping, and fourth floor for executive offices. The bank uses the former banquet hall on the lower level for a large board room and meeting room for bank functions. The First National Bank building has served as a centerpiece for downtown commerce in Rolla, MO since the 1930s. With Phelps County Bank, the building is still a source of regional financial services. Over the years, many famous people stayed at the Edwin Long Hotel, including President Harry Truman, actress Marilyn Monroe, and actor Victor Mature. The hotel served as the premier facility for travelers using Route 66 or the Frisco Railroad from the 1930s through the early 1960s, when passenger railroad service stopped. Motels built on the rerouted Route 66 (I-44) during the 1950s and 1960s drew away travelers from downtown. References #Bradbury, John F. Rolla. The Old Town. 2002. #Clair V Mann Collection.

It is the fastest of the world‚Äôs 12,000 known ant species, clocking a blistering velocity of 855 millimetres per second (nearly 1 m/s or 3.6 km/h). It can travel a length 108 times its own body length per second, a feat topped only by two other creatures, the Australian tiger beetle and the California coastal mite. This is nearly the walking pace of a human being, and compared to its body size would correspond to a speed of about for a tall human runner. Largely due to the extreme high temperatures of their habitat, but also due to the threat of predators, the ants are active outside their nest for only about ten minutes per day. The twin pressures of predation and temperature restrict their above-ground activity to within a narrow temperature band between that at which predatory lizards cease activity and the ants' own upper threshold. The scene outside a Saharan silver ant nest The ants often traverse midday temperatures around to scavenge corpses of heat- stricken animals. To cope with such high temperatures, the ants have several unique adaptations. When traveling at full speed, they use only four of their six legs. This quadrupedal gait is achieved by raising the front pair of legs. Several other adaptations, including a very high stride frequency, make C. bombycina one of the fastest-walking animal species in relation to their body size. Keeping track of the position of the sun, the ants are able to navigate, always knowing the direct route back to their nest, thus can minimize their time spent in the heat. They produce heat shock proteins (HSPs), but unlike other animals, they do this not in direct response to heat. Instead, they do this before leaving the nest, so they do not suffer the initial damage when their body temperature rises quickly. These HSPs allow cellular functions to continue even at very high body temperatures. If they did not produce the proteins in anticipation of the extreme heat, they would die before the proteins could have their effect. A few scouts keep watch and alert the colony when ant lizards take shelter in their burrows. Then the whole colony, hundreds of ants, leaves to search for food, although they need to complete their work before the temperature reaches , a temperature capable of killing them. Saharan silver ants capturing desert beetle In the words of one researcher, the production of this protein \\"does not reflect an acute response to cellular injury or protein denaturation, but appears to be an adaptive response allowing the organism to perform work at elevated temperatures during temperature changes too abrupt to give the animal an opportunity to benefit from de novo HSP synthesis,\\" further \\"the few minutes duration of the foraging frenzy is too short for synthesis of these protective proteins after exposure to heat.\\" This and other adaptations led to the ant being called \\"one of the most heat-resistant animals known.\\" Its critical thermal maximum is . Silver ants are covered on the top and sides of their bodies with a coating of uniquely shaped hairs with triangular cross-sections that keep them cool in two ways. These hairs are highly reflective under visible and near-infrared light, i.e., in the region of maximal solar radiation (the ants run at a speed of up to and look like droplets of mercury on the desert surface). The hairs are also highly emissive in the midinfrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, where they serve as an antireflection layer that enhances the ants' ability to offload excess heat by thermal radiation, which is emitted from the hot body of the ants to the air. This passive cooling effect works under the full sun.

Former Republican National Committee chairman Haley Barbour defeated incumbent Democrat Ronnie Musgrove by a margin of 6.78%. As of 2018, the election remains the most expensive gubernatorial election in state history, with over $18 million having been spent between Barbour and Musgrove. An additional $5 million was spent by the Republican Governors Association, mostly on television advertising. Barbour's victory in the election made him only the second Republican governor of Mississippi since Reconstruction.

As neither candidate had obtained a majority in the election, Musgrove was chosen as governor by the Democratic controlled Mississippi House of Representatives. As governor, Musgrove had difficulties with the state's legislators. He vetoed the whole budget one year but was overridden by the legislature.

He had previously failed to be elected to the U.S. Senate for Mississippi in 1982, and in 1983 he travelled the state for several months to gauge support for his gubernatorial bid. =Results= General election =Campaign= Musgrove campaigned as an independent and conservative candidate, downplaying his membership in the Democratic Party and avoiding inviting any national figures to support him. He criticized Barbour for being a lobbyist for the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries. A key message of Musgrove's campaign was that Barbour's support for free trade would cost jobs in Mississippi. Barbour attacked Musgrove for his flawed leadership of the state, blaming him for the state of the economy of Mississippi. He was helped by the President, George Bush, who made three trips to the state to support Barbour. Several other leading Republican figures came to Mississippi to support Barbour including Dick Cheney, Jeb Bush and Rudy Giuliani. A poll in October 2003 showed Barbour having a narrow lead, with 50% saying they would vote for him as against 45% for Musgrove. However another poll at the beginning of November showed Musgrove with 42% against 41% for Barbour and both sides regarded turnout as key to the election. Exit polls showed that black voters made up a third of the vote and 94% of them backed Musgrove. However among white voters 77% backed Barbour and a quarter of voters who supported Musgrove in his first election in 1999 now backed Barbour. =Results= References External links * Mississippi Certified Election Results Gubernatorial 2003 Mississippi ","title":"2003 Mississippi gubernatorial election"},{"id":"17427489","text":"Vaishnavism of Manipur, an east Indian state, has extended history. While there are records in the Puranas as to account of the pre-historic forms of Vaishnavism or Bhagavatism in the area of present state, the modern history of Vaishnava practices in Manipur started with a king of the Shan kingdom of Pong gifting a murti of Vishnu chakra (the symbolic disc of Vishnu or Krishna) to Kyamaba, king of Manipur, so since the 1470s the kings of Manipur started worshiping Vishnu. Many brahmana priests from the west, main areas of India, came to Manipur and settled there. The account of the arrival of the members of brahmanas is found in the records of the book Bamon Khunthock. King Kyamba (1467‚Äì1523) built a Vishnu mandir in Vishnupur, a notable architectural monument. In 1704 King Charai Rongba was initiated into Vaishnava tradition and since then Vaishnavism became the state religion. This consolidated the cultural contact with India even further. King Gareeb Nivaz was ruling from 1709 to 1748 and he was initiated into Vaishnavism of Chaitanya tradition, by followers of Narottama Dasa Thakura, who worshiped Krishna as the supreme deity, Svayam bhagavan. He practiced this religion for nearly twenty years. Preachers and pilgrims used to arrive in large numbers and cultural contact with Assam was maintained.p.327 It is believed that the wave of devotion that turned the entire kingdom Krishna conscious took place during the reign of Gareeb Nivaz‚Äôs grandson Bhagyachandra. The Manipuri Vaishnavas do not worship Krishna alone, but Radha-Krishna.Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature - p. 4290, Amaresh Datta, Mohan Lal,1994 With the spread of Vaishnavism the worship of Krishna and Radha became the dominant form in the Manipur region. Every village there has a Thakur-ghat and a temple.p.183 King Bhagyachandra Bhagyachandra ascended the throne in 1759; however, in 1762 the Burmese invaded Manipur, and the king, with his queen and a few attendants, fled to the neighboring state, now known as Assam. The dispute over real identity of the king, called for a demonstration of supernatural powers, believed to be attributed to the king. It is believed that Bhagyachandra had a revelation from Lord Krishna in a dream; based on this revelation, he committed himself to making worship of Govinda the state religion on return to power in Manipur. It is believed that the deity of Govinda was to be made of the specific sacred tree and carefully planned Rasa-lila dances to be instituted in the country, which was regained with the help of the king of present-day Assam. On reinstating the throne, a Govindaji deity was installed and regularly worshiped; later a Radha deity was installed and worshiped next to it. Geographical isolation of Manipur According to some researchers the geographical isolation of Manipur seems to be the major factor to resist the immediate indigenous transformation from the sanamahism to any sect of Hinduism and Vaishnavism, and even Buddhism. On the other hand, the migration that continued no doubt was with its modification due to addition of new religious fold and practices.Rini Sinha, Guwahati. MONDAY, 10 DECEMBER 2007 A short history of the Bishnupriya Manipuri and their religio-cultural consciousness Impact of Gaudiya Vaishnavism The Bisnupriya Manipuri were initiated to the religion of Chaitanya during the middle of 18th century AD. But even before that time, they followed some other form of Vaishnavism as is known from the Khumal Purana. It seems that early form of Vaishnavism followed by Bishnupriya Manipuri had some relation with the Vaishnavism of Sri Sankardeva; and the religio-cultural affinities between the Assamese and the Bishnupriya Manipuries are due to that religious impact. Thus we may say that Manipuri were traditionally Vaisnavites but, there is a fact of conversion during the 18th century was only from Sankara school of thought to Chaitanya school of thought. With the adoption of Gaudiya Vaisnavism the life style of Bengali Vaishnava society of 18th century AD gained acceptance to this society as an integral part of Vaishnavic way of life. Rasa Lila and Nata Sankirtana became the important features of religious function. The impact of Chaitanya Vaishnavism was very deep in all sphere of the Bishnupriyas. In all rituals non-vegetarian foods is completely prohibited. It has no exception even in the case of disposal/ cremation of dead bodies. It can be conclusively said that the formation of Bishnupriya language and development of religious concept, culture, heritage etc. definitely took place in the soil of Manipur. Great majority of Bishnupriya Manipuri people fled away from Manipur and took refuge in Assam, Tripura, Sylhet (Bangladesh), and in Cachar during the 18 th and 19th century due to internal conflicts / turmoil and repeated Burmese attacks. During the mass exodus that the Bishnupriya manipuri carried their culture and heritage with them at their new settlements. Impact of other local traditions In Manipur, their culture being gulped by non-Bishnupriya Manipuri culture, in Cachar and Bangladesh it is by Islamic culture while in Assam by Assamese culture.

The state highway runs from MD 7 near Abingdon north to MD 23 in Norrisville. MD 136 is an L-shaped route that connects the communities of Creswell, Churchville, Dublin, and Whiteford in eastern Harford County with each other and with Norrisville in the county's northwestern corner. The state highway is connected to the cities of Aberdeen and Havre de Grace via its connection with MD 22. MD 136 is also linked to the county seat of Bel Air from the east through MD 22, from the northeast by U.S. Route 1 (US 1), from the north via MD 24, and from the northwest by MD 23. The state highway starts on the coastal plain near the Chesapeake Bay and crosses Harford County's two main tributaries of the Susquehanna River, Deer Creek and Broad Creek, while traversing a wide swath of the Piedmont. MD 136 is the second longest Maryland state highway entirely within one county after MD 235. The first section of MD 136 was constructed east from what is now MD 165 in Whiteford in the early 1920s. That highway was extended south to US 1 near Dublin in the mid-1920s. MD 136 was extended south to US 40 (now MD 7) in the early 1930s; the highway was also extended north from Whiteford to Graceton in the same period. The portion of MD 136 between MD 24 and MD 23 was originally MD 517, which was constructed in the mid-1930s. MD 136 was extended west over the gap between Graceton and MD 24 and assumed all of MD 517 to Norrisville in the mid-1950s. Route description MD 136 northbound south of Churchville MD 136 begins at an intersection with MD 7 (Philadelphia Road) east of Abingdon at the edge of Bush Declaration Natural Resources Management Area, just north of the confluence of Bynum Run and James Run to form the Bush River. The junction is near the site of the signing of the Bush Declaration, a 1775 resolution of Harford County citizens that supported the activities leading up to American Revolution. MD 136 heads north through farmland as two-lane undivided Calvary Road, which crosses over Interstate 95 (I-95, John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway) with no access. I-95 can be accessed via MD 543 (Fountain Green Road/Creswell Road), which MD 136 intersects in the village of Creswell. North of Creswell, MD 136 passes to the west of Stoney Demonstration Forest, crosses Broad Run adjacent to a quarry in the hamlet of Calvary, and passes close to the historic home Webster's Forest, which is accessed via Asbury Road. The state highway continues north to Churchville, where MD 136 intersects MD 22 (Churchville Road) next to the village's namesake, Churchville Presbyterian Church. A short distance east of the intersection, MD 22--which connects Bel Air and Aberdeen--intersects MD 155 (Level Road), which leads to Havre de Grace. View south from the north end of MD 136 at MD 23 in Norrisville MD 136 leaves Churchville as Priestford Road, which passes by the Churchville Test Area, an auxiliary unit of Aberdeen Proving Ground used to test Army vehicles. The state highway traverses Deer Creek at Priest Ford, which is the site of Priest Neal's Mass House and Mill Site, a historic church, and a junction with Harmony Church Road, which leads through the Lower Deer Creek Valley Historic District. MD 136 passes a loop of old alignment, Poplar Grove Road, before intersecting US 1 (Conowingo Road) at an acute angle in the hamlet of Poplar Grove. The state highway continues north as Whiteford Road, which passes another loop of old alignment, Dublin School Road, before meeting MD 440 (Dublin Road) in the village of Dublin. MD 136 heads northwest out of Dublin, crossing Broad Creek and intersecting Robinson Mill Road, which follows the creek eastward, changing to a gated, closed, private dirt road within the Broad Creek Memorial Scout Reservation in the vicinity of the Broad Creek Soapstone Quarries. The state highway intersects MD 646 (Prospect Road) in the hamlet of Prospect before approaching Whiteford. Whiteford and the neighboring village of Cardiff are part of the Whiteford-Cardiff Historic District, which preserve buildings from the 19th century when the area was a center of the slate industry. MD 136 expands to a four-lane undivided highway and intersects Old Pylesville Road, which serves as the main street of the villages, before intersecting MD 165 (Pylesville Road). MD 136 reduces to two lanes as it heads west from Whiteford toward the hamlet of Graceton, where the state highway intersects MD 624 (Graceton Road) within of the Pennsylvania state line. The state highway veers southwest and crosses Broad Run again before reaching Five Forks, where the state highway intersects Clermont Mill Road and MD 24 (Rocks Road). MD 136 heads west as Harkins Road, intersecting Fawn Grove Road in the hamlet of Harkins and traversing three tributaries of Deer Creek--Falling Branch, Big Branch, and Island Branch--before reaching its northern terminus at MD 23 (Norrisville Road) in Norrisville. History The first section of MD 136 to be constructed was Whiteford Road from Prospect to Whiteford by 1923. The remainder of Whiteford Road south to US 1 was constructed between 1924 and 1927. Priestford Road was built starting in 1930 from US 1. Both the Priestford Road and Calvary Road portions of MD 136 were completed in 1932, including a new bridge over Deer Creek at Priest Ford. In 1933, MD 136 achieved its original extent when the state highway was extended north from Whiteford to Graceton. The Harkins Road portion of MD 136 was originally designated MD 517. MD 517 was constructed as a modern highway from MD 24 at Five Forks west to Harkins in 1933. Harkins Road was extended west from Harkins in 1934 and 1935. MD 517 was completed west to MD 23 in Norrisville in 1936. MD 136 was relocated through Dublin in 1952 and 1953. The state highway reached its current extent in 1956 when the county highway between Graceton and Five Forks was transferred to state control; MD 136 was extended southwest to Five Forks then assumed all of MD 517 to its present northern terminus in Norrisville.

The station opened with the line on 15 March 1899 under the name Woodford and Hinton and served the adjacent villages of Woodford Halse to the east and Hinton to the west, both in Northamptonshire. The station was renamed Woodford Halse on 1 November 1948. History Royal Scot 6156 at Woodford Halse railway station The village of Woodford Halse became notable for the role it played as an important railway centre. Originally it had seemed destined not to have a railway at all, as the nearest stations were at Byfield (about two miles west), and Moreton Pinkney (three miles south-east), both on the East and West Junction Railway (later part of the Stratford-upon-Avon and Midland Junction Railway), opened in July 1873, and no other lines seemed likely to be built in such a thinly populated area. However, in the late 1890s the village found itself on a major trunk route, the Great Central Railway's London Extension. The station was a variation on the standard island platform design typical of the London Extension, here the less common \\"embankment\\" type reached from a roadway (Station Road), that passed beneath the line. It differed from the usual design in that since it served what was effectively a four-way junction, it was provided with a more extensive range of platform buildings and facilities beneath a longer awning. A 1911 Railway Clearing House map of railways in the vicinity of Woodford Halse (shown here as Woodford & Hinton) The station was situated near Woodford Halse North Curve Junction linking the GCR with the Stratford-upon-Avon and Midland Junction Railway (SMJ) route between Stratford-upon-Avon and Towcester, and a separate platform was provided on the west side for SMJ trains, a timber structure later replaced by a concrete slab construction although still referred to as the \\"wooden platform\\". Further south however was the more important Culworth Junction, divergence point for a stretch of line in length linking the GCR with the Great Western Railway at , enabling some extensive and varied cross-country workings to take place. =Motive Power Depot= Woodford Halse Locomotive Yard in 1953 To the north of the station, a major locomotive depot housing up to 30 locos with space to double that number, also wagon and sheet repair shops, plus extensive marshalling yards, were also sited at Woodford Halse (plans to construct carriage sheds there too were dropped). The originally intended location for these facilities was Brackley until local opposition forced a change in plans and the site moved to Woodford Halse. Much of this was located on top of a vast embankment covering some 35 acres (14.2 hectares), formed mainly from spoil taken from Catesby Tunnel a few miles to the north. The infant River Cherwell flowed (and still flows) beneath this embankment in a north-east to south-west direction in a culvert approx. 165 yards (150 metres) in length. Several roads containing 136 terraced dwellings to house the railway workers were built on the east side of the embankment, together with a street of shops. This gave a small previously rural village an industrial look that seemed alien to its surroundings. The Woodford-cum-Membris parish's population eventually peaked at just under 2,000, at which time Woodford Halse had its own cinema and railway workers' social club. =Closure= The GCR was, at times, a busy route and the depot and yards at Woodford Halse were a hive of activity, but not busy enough to ensure survival when the Beeching Axe closures of the 1960s took place. The Stratford & Midland Junction had already closed on 7 April 1952 although the Woodford North to West Curve which gave access to it had actually gone earlier, on 31 May 1948. On 5 April 1965 the marshalling yards closed, and on 5 September 1966, most of the GCR was closed completely, including all remaining lines converging on Woodford Halse. Bridges of the former Great Central main line at Woodford Halse, Northamptonshire All tracks and most railway buildings were later cleared leaving behind a wasteland (in 1971 one building withstood four attempts by the Royal Marines to blow it up - they only succeeded in removing its roof). The population fell sharply too, as many former railway workers and their families left the area, but new developments in later decades have increased it (the parish's population was 3,493 at the 2011 UK census, slightly up on the 2001 UK census figure of 3,456). Charwelton water tower which fed the troughs at the north end of the Woodford Halse railway station New Yard Woodford Halse is once again a quiet place, though visitors can still see evidence of its railway past. The twin bridges over Station Road can still be seen; below and between them is the bricked-up station entrance, but up on top everything has gone - the station site itself is now a temporary winter home for travelling showmen. To the north, where the depot and yards were sited, is now a tree plantation and the Great Central Way Industrial Estate, currently being enlarged to create the Manor Business Park. Further north still, one solitary railway structure survives amid fields: the water tower that served the Charwelton Watertroughs. Routes  Proposal  In August 2000, Chiltern Railways suggested reopening the former Great Central Main Line through Woodford Halse and to a parkway station in Leicestershire. This proposal is a \\"secondary aspiration\\" of Chiltern's franchise agreement. However, Chiltern stated in 2013 that the plan is \\"no longer active\\". Model A model of the station and the goods yards exists in the social club building near the site. The building itself was purchased by BR for use as a recreational building for railway workers. The models includes Woodford Halse station in 1930s condition, and a model of Byfield station is under construction.

The church was founded in 1856 by eight members including John T. Ball and Lewis A. Ragsdale, founders of the city of Meridian. The reverend at the time was William Curtis Emerson.First Presbyterian Church of Meridian Official Website: History From 1856 to 1867, the church met in the second floor of a store owned by one of the members. In 1867, the church had grown enough to construct a building on the corner of 25th Avenue and 7th Street in which to hold its services. After a fire on January 27, 1883, the building was destroyed; members of the church later rebuilt the structure using brick instead of wood. The church remained at its location on 25th Avenue and 7th Street until September 25, 1911, when it was sold to the city of Meridian. The city currently uses the building to house the Meridian Museum of Art. After selling the old building, the church bought a lot at the corner of 23rd Avenue and 10th Street. The building, designed by architect Penn Jeffries Krouse, was built in 1913 and dedicated on March 29, 1914. In 1951, an educational building addition used for Sunday School was completed under the leadership of pastor Dr. J. Kelly Unger. It was listed on the National Register in 1979. It was deemed more notable than other churches in Meridian for \\"its historical significance\\" and because it was designed by P.J. Krouse, \\"architect of most of Meridian's outstanding buildings from 1900-1920\\". and The sanctuary was renovated in 1982. In October 1996, the church bought an adjacent building which became the Administration & Education Building and is used for staff offices as well as both Adult Sunday School and committee meetings.

Life Wynne was the son of William Wynne, sergeant-at- law, and was baptized at St Clement Danes, London on 25 February 1734. He was admitted as a member of the Middle Temple in 1749 (being called to the bar in 1758). He matriculated at Jesus College, Oxford in 1753, but left the college without taking a degree. His wealth meant that he did not need to work actively as a lawyer. On his father's death in 1765, he inherited the estate of Little Chelsea in Kensington, London; he also owned the manor of Polsew at St Erme, near Truro in Cornwall. On his mother's death in 1779, he inherited property in Somerset. He owned a house in Essex Street, London, as well as property in Dudley and Wales. His inheritance also included his father's library, which contained the collections of Narcissus Luttrell. Wynne had a library of almost 2,800 volumes, including many books on English law and Roman law. In 1765, he published A Miscellany Containing Several Law Tracts, which included some of Wynne's own works and one of his father's works (Observations Touching the Antiquity and Dignity of the Degree of Serjeant at Law). His most important work was Eunomus, or, Dialogues Concerning the Law and Constitution of England (1768), an attempt to explain English legal principles and defend it against charges that it was only interesting to lawyers. It also attempt to refute criticism of cost and delay in the legal process. It reached its fifth edition in 1822, although it was overshadowed by William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England. Wynne, who never married, died of cancer of the mouth, at his house in Little Chelsea, London, on 27 December 1784. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, in the same grave as his parents. His property was divided between his sister and his brother, who was a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford. His library was auctioned after his death in a sale that lasted eleven days.

Overview  A view of Levent business district in Istanbul, 2013 Historically, Istanbul has been the center of the country's economic life because of its location as an international junction of land and sea trade routes. In 2012 the City of Istanbul had a GDP of $332.4 billion.PriceWaterhouseCoopers: U.K. Economic Outlook and Global City GDP Ranking 2005‚Äì2020 Full Report (PDF) In 2008, companies based in Istanbul made exports worth $41,397,000,000 and imports worth $69,883,000,000; which corresponded to 56.6% and 60.2% of Turkey's exports and imports, respectively, in that year.CNN T√ºrk: Dƒ±≈ü ticaretin lokomotifi ƒ∞stanbul (Istanbul is the locomotive of foreign trade) In 2006 Turkey's exports grew a further +16.1% while imports grew +17.6% because of a rising demand of energy resources and raw materials by the industrial manufacturers in the country.State Statistics Institute of the Republic of Turkey: Statistics of Foreign Trade (1923‚Äì2006) According to Forbes magazine, Istanbul had a total of 37 billionaires in 2013, ranking 5th in the world behind Moscow (84 billionaires), New York City (62 billionaires), Hong Kong (43 billionaires) and London (43 billionaires). Income distribution is not evenly distributed in Istanbul, such that 20% of the highest income group uses 64% of the resources and 20% of the lowest income group uses 4% of the resources (based on 1994 statistics). Bosphorus Bridge (1973) connecting Europe and Asia The change in Istanbul's living standards is a direct reflection of the nation's statistics as the 27.5% share of the total consumption in Turkey is performed by the population of Istanbul. In the late 1990s, the economy of Turkey, and Istanbul in particular, suffered several major depressions. The Asian financial crisis between July 1997 and the beginning of 1998, as well as the crisis in Russia between August 1998 and the middle of 1999 had negative effects in all areas of the economy, particularly on exports. Following this setback, a slow reorganization of the economy of Istanbul was observed in 1999. The major earthquake which was epicentered in nearby Kocaeli on 17 August 1999, triggered one of the largest economic shocks for the city. Apart from the capital and human losses caused by the disaster, a decrease in GDP of approximately two percent occurred. Despite these downturns, Istanbul's economy has strongly improved and recovered in following years. Istanbul was hit hard by the 2018 Turkish currency and debt crisis. As of August 2018, almost one-third of office space in Turkey's commercial capital of Istanbul lies vacant, and office rental prices across all segments have fallen sharply. Financial Sector Bankalar Caddesi, mentioned as Voyvoda Yolu in the 17th century Seyahatn√¢me of Evliya √áelebi, was Istanbul's financial centre during the Ottoman period. Completed in 1892, the Ottoman Central Bank headquarters is seen at left. Istanbul has always been the \\"financial capital\\" of Turkey, even after Ankara became the new political capital in 1923. The opening of specific markets in the city during the 1980s further strengthened this status. Inaugurated at the beginning of 1986, the Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE) is the sole securities market of Turkey, established to provide trading in equities, right coupons, Government bonds, Treasury bills, revenue sharing certificates, bonds issued by the Privatization Administration and corporate bonds, and to carry out overnight transactions. In 1993 the ISE decided on gold market liberalization, and in 1995 the Istanbul Gold Exchange was established, which ended the gold bullion imports monopoly of the Turkish Central Bank and transferred it to the private sector members of the gold exchange. Levent, Maslak and ≈ûi≈üli financial districts are home to the headquarters of Turkey's largest companies and banks, as well as the local headquarters of global giants of the financial sector such as Citibank, Merrill Lynch, J. P. Morgan, HSBC, ABN Amro, Fortis, ING Bank, BNP Paribas, Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale, Banca di Roma, UniCredit, WestLB, Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank, Milli Reas√ºrans, VHV Reas√ºrans and many others. Both Levent and Maslak have a constantly growing and changing dynamic skyline with several new skyscraper projects being proposed, approved and initiated every year. Industry Zorlu Center in Istanbul Istanbul is the \\"industrial center\\" of Turkey. It employs approximately 20% of Turkey's industrial labor and contributes 38% of Turkey's industrial workspace. In addition, the city generates 55% of Turkey's trade and 45% of the country's wholesale trade, and generates 21.2% of Turkey's gross national product. Istanbul contributes 40% of all taxes collected in Turkey and produces 27.5% of Turkey's national product. Many of Turkey's major manufacturing plants are located in the city. Istanbul and its surrounding province produce cotton, fruit, olive oil, silk, and tobacco. Food processing, textile production, oil products, rubber, metal ware, leather, chemicals, electronics, glass, machinery, paper and paper products, and alcoholic drinks are among the city's major industrial products. The city also has plants that assemble automobiles and trucks. Difficulties in the proximity of some of these varied business have been encountered in the past, such as the 2008 Istanbul fireworks explosion which was exacerbated by the close proximity of a paint factory. To give enhancement to the textile industry the Istanbul Exporters Union, and textiles and clothing (ITKIB) was created in 1986, by the Secretariat for Foreign Trade, to facilitate the expansion and streamlining of export of textiles from Istanbul. In fact, the Union comprises four independent union representatives that are included in the Board ITKIB: * Union of exporters of finished clothing; * Union of exporters of textiles and raw materials; * Union of exporters of leather and leather products; * Union of exporters of carpets Pharmaceutical industry started in 1952 with the establishment of \\"Eczacƒ±ba≈üƒ± Pharmaceuticals Factory\\" in Levent, Istanbul.Baytop T.

There are thousands of hotels and other tourist oriented industries in the city, catering to both vacationers and visiting professionals. In 2006 a total of 23,148,669 tourists visited Turkey, most of whom entered the country through the airports and seaports of Istanbul and Antalya.H√ºrriyet: 2006‚Äôda T√ºrkiye‚Äôye gelen turist ba≈üƒ±na harcama 728 dolara indi The total number of tourists who entered Turkey through Atat√ºrk International Airport and Sabiha G√∂k√ßen International Airport in Istanbul reached 5,346,658, rising from 4,849,353 in 2005.Sabah: Turist sayƒ±sƒ± genelde d√º≈üt√º ƒ∞stanbul'da arttƒ± This number increased to 10.5 Million in 2011 with the booming Turkish tourism. In 2011, Istanbul's two international airports handled more than 50 Million passengers. Istanbul is also one of the world's major conference destinations and is an increasingly popular choice for the world's leading international associations. Istanbul's conference appeal developed with three separate conference and exhibition areas: The \\"Conference Valley\\" (Istanbul Convention & Exhibition Center, Istanbul Hilton Convention & Exhibition Center, the Military Museum Cultural Center and the Cemal Re≈üit Rey Concert Hall); The Airport & Exhibition District (150,000 m2 (1.6 m sq ft) of exhibition space around the CNR International Expo Center); and the Business & Financial District (with many distributed centers). These cluster areas feature a combination of accommodations, meeting facilities, and exhibition space. They can be used individually, or collectively through transportation with the Istanbul metro, and are linked together for accommodating events with 10,000 or more participants.

Hjerleid school in Dovre. The roundpole fence is a wooden fence typical to the countryside in Sweden (in Swedish: g√§rdesg√•rd), Norway (in Norwegian: skigard), Finland (in Finnish: riukuaita, risuaita or pistoaita) and Estonia (in Estonian: roigasaed or teivasaed). It is normally made from unbarked and unsplit youngish trees, mostly spruce or juniper. Roundpole fences have traditionally been used as a means of fencing off animals rather than marking property boundaries. The fence construction generally consists of 3 or 4 parts: uprights put together in pairs, round poles laid horizontally or diagonally between the two uprights, and binding cord usually made from young saplings - and sometimes also diagonal bracing. The fence is usually 1.5‚Äì2 metres tall. The fencing can also incorporate specially made stiles and gates. The fence requires an abundance of wood, which was never a problem in Scandinavia, as the trees generally came from the owners' own forests in the process of thinning them out. The term ‚Ä≥roundpole fence\\" is somewhat misleading, as the rails between the pairs of uprights are usually split spruce logs. However, the upright poles are always round, young spruce trees with a diameter of 5 to 7 cm. For the diagonals, larger trees with a diameter up to 20 cm were split into four or eight rails of suitable dimensions. Very young saplings were used to bind the rails to the uprights, the idea being to utilize trees of different ages. In more recent times, rough sawn boards have also been used, preferably the outer boards of a log, with one curved side. The binding of saplings have also been replaced by steel wire. The oldest known roundpole fence dates back to the Iron Age. The oldest known archeological find of a roundpole fence in Sweden was uncovered in Leksand.

Canadian Forces Europe (CFE) consisted of two formations in West Germany, Canadian Forces Base Lahr, with the 4 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group (1957-1993), and No. 1 Air Division RCAF at Canadian Forces Base Baden-Soellingen, which later became 1 Canadian Air Group. Both formations closed in the early 1990s with the end of the Cold War.

This formation, which was formed primarily with Militia units, eventually moved to a permanent base at Soest in 1953. To begin with, it was intended to rotate brigades to Germany - 27 CIB was replaced by 1 Canadian Infantry Brigade Group in October 1953, which in turn was replaced by 2 Canadian Infantry Brigade Group in 1955, and then 4 Canadian Infantry Brigade Group in 1957. The arrival of 4 CIBG saw a significant reinforcement of the formation's capabilities; prior to this each brigade had only been equipped with a squadron of main battle tanks. The arrival of 4 CIBG saw a full armoured regiment equipped with Centurions and an independent brigade reconnaissance squadron with Ferrets. In 1959, when 4 CIBG's tour was due to end, a change was made in the reinforcement policy for West Germany. Instead of whole brigades rotating every two years, the decision was made to keep 4 CIBG and its associated brigade units in place, instead rotating the major combat elements to Germany every three years. The brigade was headquartered in Soest. Individual units were stationed both at Soest and other towns in North Rhine-Westphalia: *Soest - BHQ, 1 x infantry battalion, service units *Hemer - 1 x infantry battalion, artillery regiment *Werl - 1 x infantry battalion, engineer regiment, field ambulance *Iserlohn - armoured regiment In 1962, the brigade was reinforced with the addition of the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps helicopter recce troop, equipped with nine CH-112 Nomad helicopters. By the mid 1960s, 4 CIBG's manpower totalled 6,700 men; it featured three mechanised infantry battalions, a reconnaissance squadron equipped with both armoured vehicles and helicopters, artillery equipped with both fire support and tactical nuclear weapons, and an extensive logistic operation. The extent of the Canadian operation led to the British describing it as \\"a light division\\".Change of Command marks long period of service in Europe - Canadian Army The brigade was renamed 4 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group in May 1968. = Structure 1989 = * Canadian Forces Europe ** 1 Canadian Division (Forward), CFB Lahr *** 1st Canadian Division Headquarters and Signal Regiment, CFB Lahr *** 1st Canadian Division Intelligence Company, CFB Lahr *** 4 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group, CFB Lahr **** 4 CMBG Headquarters & Signal Squadron, CFB Lahr **** 8th Canadian Hussars (Princess Louise's), CFB Lahr (77x Leopard C1, 20x Lynx, 36x M113, 2x M577, 6x Bergepanzer) **** 1er Btn, Royal 22e R√©giment, CFB Lahr (2x M577, 65x M113, 11x Lynx, 18x M113 TUA with TOW, 24x M125 with a 81mm mortar) **** 3rd Btn, Royal Canadian Regiment, CFB Baden-S√∂llingen (2x M577, 65x M113, 11x Lynx, 18x M113 TUA with TOW, 24x M125 with a 81mm mortar) **** 1st Regiment, Royal Canadian Horse Artillery, CFB Lahr (2x M577, 26x M109A4, 46x M113, 24x M548) **** 4 Combat Engineer Regiment, CFB Lahr (14x M113, 2x M577, 6x M548, 9x Badger AEV, 6x Biber bridgelayer) **** 4 Service Battalion, CFB Lahr (4x M113, 2x Bergepanzer, 6x MTV-R) **** 4 Field Ambulance, CFB Lahr **** 4 Military Police Platoon, CFB Lahr *** 4 Air Defence Regiment, Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery **** Headquarters & Service Battery, 4 Air Defence Regiment, RCA (2x M 577, 2x M113) **** 127 Air Defence Battery (detached to 4 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group), CFB Lahr (12x ADATS, 15x Javelin, 5x M113) **** 128 Air Defence Battery (detached to 4 Wing), CFB Baden-S√∂llingen (4x ADATS, 8x 35mm Skyguard) **** 129 Air Defence Battery (detached to 3 Wing), CFB Lahr (4x ADATS, 8x 35mm Skyguard) **** 4 Air Defence Workshop In case of war 1 Canadian Division would have been reinforced by 5 Groupe-brigade m√©canis√© du Canada and 1,400 men from 1 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group would have been sent to bring 4 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group to full wartime strength. 1 Canadian Division would have been assigned to the Central Army Group Commander's tactical reserve, performing operations in support of either II (German) Corps or VII US Corps. Royal Canadian Air Force Sabre Mk 5 of No. 416 Squadron at Grostenquin, 1953 To meet NATO's air defence commitments during the Cold War, No. 1 Air Division RCAF was established in Europe in the early 1950s with four Royal Canadian Air Force bases in France and West Germany. These included RCAF Station Marville (No. 1 Wing) and RCAF Station Grostenquin (No. 2 Wing) in France and Royal Canadian Air Force Station Zweibr√ºcken (No. 3 Wing) and Royal Canadian Air Force Station Baden- Soellingen (No. 4 Wing) in West Germany. These wings consisted of three fighter squadrons each. RCAF Station Grostenquin was closed in 1964 and its units transferred to RCAF Station Marville. In 1967 Marville was closed after France's withdrawal from NATO's military command structure and the units transferred to new RCAF Station Lahr (later CFB Lahr, now Flughafen Lahr).

The town was named by the early settlers for a spring nearby where the Indians would skin and quarter (chop into four pieces) deer.The Baptist Church that bears the name \\"Skinquarter\\" was founded in 1778. The first building was close to the spring. The present church building is the third or fourth building to be occupied by the church but it has kept the name Skinquarter continuously. It was a stop on the Farmville and Powhatan Railroad from 1884 to 1905 and then on the Tidewater and Western Railroad from 1905 to 1917. In 1926, a few years after the railroad was sold, a gas station for automobiles and store, Skinquarter Market, was built here, near the site of the Railroad Station that was about 1/4 mile up what is now Skinquarter Road. In 1891 the train did not always stop but a railway post office, a mail car on the Farmville and Powhatan, dropped off and picked up mail using the Mail on- the-fly technique. This was a hook and pouch system that let the train drop off and pick up mail without slowing down.

There are approximately 3400 deepwater wells in the Gulf of Mexico with depths greater than 150 meters.http://www.boem.gov/Oil-and-Gas- Energy-Program/Mapping-and-Data/Index.aspx It has not been technologically and economically feasible for many years, but with rising oil prices, more companies are investing in this area. Major companies working in this sector include Halliburton, Diamond Offshore, TransOcean, Geoservices, and Schlumberger. The deepwater gas and oil market is back on the rise after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster, and total expenditure of around $35 billion per year and a total global CAPEX of $167 billion in the past four years.{http://www.douglas-westwood.com/shop/shop- infopage.php?longref=502~0#.Us6y_cRDuSo} Recent industry analysis by Visiongain has estimated that the total expenditure in the global deepwater infrastructure market would reach $145bn in 2011. : ‚ÄúNot all oil is accessible on land or in shallow water. You can find some oil deposits buried deep under the ocean floor.‚Äù ...Using sonic equipment, oil companies determine the drilling sites most likely to produce oil. Then they use a mobile offshore drilling unit (MODU) to dig the initial well. Some units are converted into production rigs, meaning they switch from drilling for oil to capturing oil once it's found. Most of the time, the oil company will replace the MODU with a more permanent oil production rig to capture oil.‚Äù ...The MODU's job is to drill down into the ocean's floor to find oil deposits. The part of the drill that extends below the deck and through the water is called the riser. The riser allows for drilling fluids to move between the floor and the rig. Engineers lower a drill string - a series of pipes designed to drill down to the oil deposit - through the riser.‚Äù : ‚ÄúThe expansion of deepwater drilling is happening despite accidents in offshore fields...‚Äù In the Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010, a large explosion occurred killing workers and spilling oil into the Gulf of Mexico while a BP oil rig was drilling in deep waters. : ‚Äú...Despite the risks, the deepwater drilling trend is spreading in the Mediterranean and off the coast of East Africa after a string of huge discoveries of natural gas.‚Äù : ‚ÄúThe reason for the resumption of such drilling, analysts say, is continuing high demand for energy worldwide.‚Äù History A Chinese ceramic model of a well with a water pulley system, excavated from a tomb of the Han Dynasty (202 BC - 220 AD) period Some of the earliest evidence of water wells are located in China. The Chinese discovered and made extensive use of deep drilled groundwater for drinking. The Chinese text The Book of Changes, originally a divination text of the Western Zhou dynasty (1046 -771 BC), contains an entry describing how the ancient Chinese maintained their wells and protected their sources of water. Archaeological evidence and old Chinese documents reveal that the prehistoric and ancient Chinese had the aptitude and skills for digging deep water wells for drinking water as early as 6000 to 7000 years ago. A well excavated at the Hemedu excavation site was believed to have been built during the Neolithic era. The well was cased by four rows of logs with a square frame attached to them at the top of the well. 60 additional tile wells southwest of Beijing are also believed to have been built around 600 BC for drinking and irrigation. Types of deepwater drilling facilities Drilling in deep waters can be performed by two main types of mobile deepwater drilling rigs: semi-submersible drilling rigs and drillships. Drilling can also be performed from a fixed-position installation such as a fixed platform, or a floating platform, such as a spar platform, a tension-leg platform, or a semi-submersible production platform. # Fixed Platform - A Fixed Platform consists of a tall, (usually) steel structure that supports a deck. Because the Fixed Platform is anchored to the sea floor, it is very costly to build. This type of platform can be installed in water depth up to . # Jack-Up Rig - Jack-up rigs are mobile units with a floating hull that can be moved around; once arrived to the desired location, the legs are lowered to the sea floor and locked into place. Then the platform is raised up out of the water. That makes this type of rig safer to work on, because weather and waves are not an issue. # Compliant Tower Platform - A compliant tower is a particular type of fixed platform. Both are anchored to the sea floor and both work places are above the water surface. However, the compliant tower is taller and narrower, and can operate up to 1 kilometer (3,000 feet) water depth. # Semi-Submersible Production Platform - This platform is buoyant, meaning the bulk of it is floating above the surface. However, the well head is typically located on the sea floor, so extra precautions must be made to prevent a leak. A contributing cause to the oil spill disaster of 2010 was a failure of the leak-preventing system. These rigs can operate anywhere from below the surface. # Tension-Leg Platform - The Tension-leg Platform consists of a floating structure, held in place by tendons that run down to the sea floor. These rigs drill smaller deposits in narrower areas, meaning this is a low-cost way to get a little oil, which attracts many companies. These rigs can drill anywhere from below the surface. # Subsea System - Subsea Systems are actually wellheads, which sit on the sea floor and extract oil straight from the ground. They use pipes to force the oil back up to the surface, and can siphon oil to nearby platform rigs, a ship overhead, a local production hub, or even a faraway onshore site. This makes the Subsea system very versatile and a popular choice for companies. # Spar Platform - Spar Platforms use a large cylinder to support the floating deck from the sea floor. On average, about 90% of the Spar Platform's structure is underwater. Most Spar Platforms are used up to depths of 1 kilometer (3,000 feet), but new technology can extend them to function up to below the surface. That makes it one of the deepest drilling rigs in use today.{http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/energy/stories/types-of-offshore-oil- rigs} 2010 Gulf Oil Spill Disaster On 20 April 2010, a BP deepwater oil rig (Deepwater Horizon) exploded, killing 11 and releasing 750,000 cubic meters (200 million gallons) of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. With those numbers, many scientists consider this disaster to be one of the worst environmental disasters in the history of the US.{http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/public_lands/energy/dirty_energy_development/oil_and_gas/gulf_oil_spill/} A large number of animal deaths have resulted from the release of the oil. A Center study estimates that over 82,000 birds; about 6,000 sea turtles; and nearly 26,000 marine mammals were killed from either the initial explosion or the oil spill.

Climate The climate is sub-humid and semi-arid, with irregular rainfall, and occasional long periods of drought. The average annual rainfall is 1,074 mm, with a highly concentrated seasonal regime and badly distributed, with 85% of the rain falling in themonths of November to March, while 2% of the rain falls from May to August. During this period, that may include the months of September and October, the deficiency in the soils is deep and the waters of the rivers drop to critical levels. The average annual temperature is 23 ¬∞C with little seasonal variation. It varies between 16 ¬∞C in winter and 30 ¬∞C in summer. In winter, due to the action of masses of polar air the temperature can reach 6 ¬∞C. The maximum temperature varies from 33 ¬∞C to 40 ¬∞C. In the summer there are high temperatures, especially in the months of December to February. The climate is hot and dry. The economy The main economic activities are cattle raising and the growing of grains. In 2006 there were 111,000 head of cattle. The main agricultural products were bananas (2,170 hectares), grapes, mangoes, and coconut. There were 308 transformation industries employing more than 2,700 people. There was a Dow Chemical facility producing cleaning products. Other industries produced furniture, soft drinks, perfumes, animal food, and clothing. Due to the poor soils sand is one of the most important natural resources, and is exported to all the state for use in civil construction. Clay is also abundant and is used in the manufacturing of bricks and tiles, as well as in pieces of local ceramic. Festivals Jana√∫ba is well known for its carnival festivities, known as \\"Janafolia\\". An event that attracts many visitors is the Agricultural Fair, which is now in its twentieth year. Health and education There were 2 hospitals with 101 beds, together with 7 health centers in the urban area and 3 in the rural zone. According to the official site of the city the educational level of the general population is low, especially the older rural inhabitants who can usually only write their own name. The city offers 7 courses to teach its citizens to read and write. In the school system there were 39 primary schools and 7 middle schools (2006). There were also 6 majors offered by private schools of higher education, including a major in agronomy.

Negotiations  =1850s to 1870s= During the 1850s, the United States (US) began to negotiate with the Anishinaabeg of North Dakota to get them to cede their land in exchange for payment and settlement on a reservation. Much earlier, probably during the mid or early 18th century, the Anishinaabeg had begun to migrate into the Great Plains of Canada and the United States from their historic territory around the Great Lakes, partly in response to encroachment by Europeans and Americans. By the time Canadian and United States immigrants made their first permanent settlements in the Pembina and Saulteaux lands on the plains, the Ojibwe territory had advanced to southeastern Alberta and much of present-day Montana. Little Shell was one of the Anishinaabe signatories of the 1863 Treaty of Old Crossing, which ceded Anishinaabe land in Minnesota and North Dakota. In 1864 he refused to negotiate with the United States further about ceding more land. For almost another 30 years, Little Shell refused to negotiate with the United States over land. Together the Anishinaabeg occupied an area of over . Much of that land was in North Dakota and South Dakota, but also included Pembina land in Montana, which may have reached all the way to the Rocky Mountains. =1880 to 1901= Around 1880, Little Shell moved his band from southern Canada to the Turtle Mountains of north-central North Dakota, where he protested encroachment by Americans and the government's lack of concern for Chippewa land title.Miller, David, et al. (2008). The History of the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation, Montana, 1800‚Äî2000, pp. 178-79. Poplar, Montana: Fort Peck Community College. Because of persistent food shortages, he and his band hunted buffalo as far as Montana and southern Saskatchewan during the late 1880s. When they returned to the Turtle Mountains in the early 1890s, they faced a series of events that led to the exile of Little Shell's and other Chippewa people from the Dakotas. In 1892 Little Shell met with American representatives and attempted to reach an agreement about ceding his people's remaining land. European-American immigrants did not wait for treaties but squatted on Native American lands in Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota. Little Shell attempted to sell his remaining lands for $1.00 per acre and be allowed to have at least of remaining lands in Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota set aside as a Reservation. The Americans offered to pay 10 cents an acre (which became known as the infamous \\"Ten-Cent Treaty\\") and refused to set aside the reservation. No agreement was reached. The United States agent brought in 32 other Chippewa leaders who signed the treaty. Little Shell's Montana lands started at the Missouri River on the Montana-North Dakota border, then followed the Yellowstone river to its beginning, and probably included the Big Belt Mountains and Little Belt Mountains, and may have reached to the Rocky Mountains near Augusta. Of course, the plains Anishinaabeg shared their Montana lands with the Assiniboine and probably the Gros Ventre, as well.

Education, 1890, by Louis Comfort Tiffany and Tiffany Studios Originally overlooking the main reading room of the then new university library when installed in 1890, the window's location is now identified as room 102 of Linsly-Chittenden Hall, on the High Street side of the building. It is accompanied by a bronze plaque which states that the window had been commissioned to commemorate the daughter of the donor, with the intent of illustrating the biblical quote, \\"Through wisdom is a house builded, and by understanding it is established, and by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches\\"., Misidentification In 1970, the Yale administration removed and crated the Tiffany window for storage in the Linsly-Chittenden basement for safekeeping, as part of a general strategy of securing vulnerable and valuable items on the Yale campus before the May Day protest on the New Haven Green that year. However, it was later discovered that the wrong windows had in fact been identified as the Tiffany window and removed and stored; it was the George Park Fisher Memorial Windows by Clayton and Bell, twelve large stained glass panels in the stairway to the library, each depicting a group of \\"men of letters\\" representing an epoch in literary history, which had been carefully packed for safekeeping in crates labelled \\"Tiffany\\" while the actual Tiffany window remained forgotten behind a dirty blackout curtain in a classroom on the other side of the building. The error was particularly striking in view of the Tiffany window having been widely identified as a single window, while the Clayton and Bell windows were twelve separate panels, which had to be individually removed and packed. Ironically, the failure to remove the correct window likely saved the Tiffany window for the university, as eleven of the twelve crates holding the other window but erroneously labeled as \\"Tiffany\\" vanished from the Linsly-Chittenden basement, either stolen or simply mislaid. In the meantime, the real Tiffany window has been cleaned and restored and is accompanied by a plaque identifying it.\\"A tale of two windows \\", Richard Conniff, Yale Alumni Magazine, Jan/Feb 2010\\"Through a glass, still darkly \\", Yale Alumni Magazine, Jan/Feb 2008 Details Image:Tiffany Education (left).JPGThe left section personifies Art, attended by personifications of Form, Color and Imagination.

The son of Solomon DesBrisay, and his wife, Mary Campbell, he was a descendant of Captain Th√©ophile de la Cour DesBrisay (1671‚Äì1761) whose Huguenot family fled religious persecution in France and settled in Dublin, Ireland before emigrating to Canada. Alexander DesBrisay was born in Bedeque, Prince Edward Island and educated at a public school. As an adult, he was a successful businessman in both the lumber and fishing industries. He married Janet Finnis with whom he had six sons and three daughters. A supporter of the Province of New Brunswick joining the proposed Canadian Confederation, in the February 21, 1865 New Brunswick general election, DesBrisay was voted into office as the Confederation Party representative for Restigouche County in an election won by an Anti-Confederation Party made up of a coalition of Conservatives and Reformers led by Albert J. Smith. DesBrisay was reelected in the 1866 New Brunswick general election won by his party. On August 16, 1867, Premier Andrew Wetmore appointed him to the Cabinet as a Minister without Portfolio. He held this appointment until May 25, 1870, when the Administration was re- organized under the leadership of the new Liberal-Conservative Party Premier, George E. King. He was returned to office again in the 1870 provincial election. That fall he resigned his seat in order to run in the November 25 Federal by-election for a seat in the House of Commons of Canada for the constituency of Restigouche to replace William Murray Caldwell who had died in office. Unsuccessful in his bid for federal office, DesBrisay returned to private business but died a few years later from smallpox at Dalhousie, New Brunswick. He is buried in the Presbyterian Church Cemetery in Bathurst.

At the onset of separation between the Greenland and Eurasian plates 55 million years ago, it formed part of the eastern margin of the Greenland Plate. Propagation of a new spreading center from the Reykjanes Ridge separated this microcontinent from the Greenland Plate. For a short period it formed a microplate, until the Aegir Ridge became inactive, after which it formed part of the Eurasian Plate. The island of Jan Mayen is a much younger feature, formed of volcanic rock, built up at the northernmost tip of the microcontinent. Extent The microcontinent extends about 500 km southwards from the Jan Mayen fracture zone. It is up to 160 km wide. The Jan Mayen Ridge separates the Norwegian Sea (the Norway Basin) from the Greenland Sea.C.Michael Hogan. 2011. Norwegian Sea. Eds. P.Saundry & C.J.Cleveland. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment (U.S.) Washington DC Identification The microcontinent was identified originally on the basis of being a bathymetric high, a positive free-air gravity anomaly and due to the lack of magnetic anomalies, all indicating that it consisted of continental crust. This interpretation has been confirmed using wide-angle seismic reflection and refraction data, coupled with standard normal incidence seismic reflection data. Make-up The microcontinent consists of the prominent bathymetric high, the Jan Mayen Ridge and several subsidiary ridges and intervening basins towards the south and west. Investigations using seismic reflection and refraction data have identified two passive margin sequences on the two sides of the microcontinent. Faults mapped on seismic reflection data are roughly N-S trending in the northern part becoming SW-NE trending to the south. The crustal thickness reaches a maximum of 16 km on the eastern side of the main ridge. History At the time of the initial break-up along the North Atlantic margin (Aegir Ridge in this area), the Jan Mayen Microcontinent formed part of the passive margin developed along the East Greenland margin. Towards the end of the Eocene period, at about the time marked by chron 17 (Middle to Late Eocene) a new spreading centre began to propagate northeastwards from the Reykjanes Ridge, forming the Kolbeinsey Ridge. During the period when both the Kolbeinsey and Aegir ridges were active, the microcontinent underwent a 30¬∞‚Äì50¬∞ anti-clockwise rotation. This was caused by the northeastward propagation of the Kolbeinsey Ridge, with simultaneous reduction in the rate of spreading at the southwestern end of the Aegir Ridge. An alternative but challenged model involves no rotation but the development of several short-lived fracture zones cutting through the microcontinent. With both ridges active the microcontinent was also temporarily a microplate. The Kolbeinsey Ridge reached the Jan Mayen Fracture Zone and therefore linked up to the Mohns Ridge, at about chron 6 (Late Oligocene to Early Miocene). At this time activity on the Aegir Ridge died away and the microcontinent became part of the Eurasian Plate. The northern end of the microcontinent was affected by renewed displacement on the Jan Mayen Fracture Zone. The volcanic island of Jan Mayen only formed in the Pleistocene, possibly related to a hotspot, known as the Jan Mayen hotspot, at the triple junction at the end of the Mohns Ridge. Economic resources The area around the microcontinent has recently become open for licensing for hydrocarbon exploration. Licenses in the southern part, known as the northern Dreki area, have been offered by the National Energy Authority for the Icelandic government and the northern area is being assessed for future petroleum activity by the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate.

Many of the legendary members of this mythical king's family became leading characters of mythical tales in their own right. Medieval Welsh tradition Uther Pendragon by W. H. Margetson (1914) In Welsh Arthurian pre-Galfridian tradition, that is from before the time of Geoffrey of Monmouth's 12th-century Historia Regum Britanniae (History of the Kings of Britain), Arthur was granted numerous relations and family members. Several early Welsh sources are usually taken as indicative of Uther Pendragon being known as Arthur's father before Geoffrey wrote, with Arthur also being granted a brother (Madog) and a nephew (Eliwlod) in these texts.T.

The Arthur of the Welsh (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1991), pp.33‚Äì71 at pp.53-4. Arthur also appears to have been assigned a sister in this material ‚Äì Gwalchmei is named as his sister-son (nephew) in Culhwch and Olwen, his mother being one Gwyar.R. Bromwich, Trioedd Ynys Prydein: the Welsh Triads (Cardiff: University of Wales, 1978), pp.372‚Äì3. Culhwch and Olwen, the Vita Iltuti and the Brut Dingestow combine to suggest that Arthur's own mother was named Eigyr.R. Bromwich and D. Simon Evans, Culhwch and Olwen. An Edition and Study of the Oldest Arthurian Tale (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1992), pp.44-5. The genealogies from the 13th-century Mostyn MS. 117 assert that Arthur is the son of Uthyr, the son of Custennin, the son of Cynfawr, the son of Tudwal, the son of Morfawr, the son of Eudaf, the son of Cadwr, the son of Cynan, the son of Caradoc, the son of Bran, the son of Ll≈∑r. Regarding Arthur's own family, his wife is consistently stated to be Gwenhwyfar, usually the daughter of King Ogrfan Gawr (variation: 'Gogrfan Gawr', \\"[G]Ogrfan the Giant\\") and sister to Gwenhwyfach, although Culhwch and Bonedd yr Arwyr do indicate that Arthur also had some sort of relationship with Eleirch daughter of Iaen, which produced a son named Kyduan (Cydfan).See T. Green, Concepts of Arthur (Stroud: Tempus, 2007), pp.151‚Äì5; R. Bromwich and D. Simon Evans, Culhwch and Olwen.

Kyduan was not the only child of Arthur according to Welsh Arthurian tradition ‚Äì he is also ascribed sons called Amr (Amhar),Historia Brittonum, 73 and also the romance Geraint and Enid, which mentions an \\"Amhar son of Arthur\\".

In addition to this immediate family, Arthur was said to have had a great variety of more distant relatives, including maternal aunts, uncles, cousins and a grandfather named Anlawd (or Amlawdd) Wledig (\\"Prince Anlawd\\"). The latter is the common link between many of these figures and Arthur: thus the relationship of first cousins that is implied or stated between Arthur, Culhwch, Illtud, and Goreu fab Custennin depends upon all of their mothers being daughters of this Anlawd, who appears to be ultimately a genealogical construct designed to allow such inter-relationships between characters to be postulated by medieval Welsh authors.R. Bromwich and D. Simon Evans, Culhwch and Olwen. An Edition and Study of the Oldest Arthurian Tale (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1992), pp.44-5 Arthur's maternal uncles in Culhwch and Olwen, including Llygatrud Emys, Gwrbothu Hen, Gweir Gwrhyt Ennwir and Gweir Baladir Hir, similarly appear to derive from this relationship.These maternal uncles are named at lines 251-2, 288-90: R. Bromwich and D. Simon Evans, Culhwch and Olwen. An Edition and Study of the Oldest Arthurian Tale (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1992). Other medieval literature Guinevere by W. H. Margetson (1914) Relatively few members of Arthur's family in the Welsh materials are carried over to the works of Geoffrey of Monmouth and chivalric romancers. His grandfather Anlawd Wledic and his maternal uncles, aunts and cousins do not appear there, and neither do any of his sons or his paternal relatives. Only the core family seem to have made the transition: his wife Gwenhwyfar (who became Guinevere), his father Uther, his mother (Igerna) and his sister-son Gwalchmei (Gawain). Gwalchmei's mother ‚Äì Arthur's sister ‚Äì failed to make the journey, Gwyar's place being taken by Anna, the wife of Loth, in Geoffrey's account, whilst Medraut (Mordred) is made into a second sister-son for Arthur (a status he does not have in the Welsh material).B. F. Roberts, \\"Geoffrey of Monmouth, Historia Regum Britanniae and Brut Y Brenhinedd\\" in R. Bromwich, A. O. H. Jarman and B. F. Roberts (edd.) The Arthur of the Welsh (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1991), pp.98‚Äì116 at pp.112‚Äì3. Morgan le Fay by W. H. Margetson (1914) In addition, new family members enter the Arthurian tradition from this point onwards. Uther is given a new family, including two brothers and a father,Geoffrey of Monmouth, Historia Regum Britanniae Book 8.1. while Arthur gains a sister or half-sister, Morgan, first named as his relative by Chr√©tien de Troyes in Yvain.Arthurian Romances trans. W. Kibler and C. W. Carroll (Harmondsworth, Penguin, 1991) A new son of Arthur, named Loholt, is introduced in Chr√©tien's Erec and Enide. Another significant new family-member is Arthur's other sister or half-sister initially known as Orcades (Morgause), the daughter of Gorlois and Igerna (Igraine) and mother of Gawain and Mordred in the romances (replacing Anna in this role). A third half-sister, Elaine, is also added at this time. Through the sisters, Arthur is given further nephews (Agravain, Gaheris and Gareth by Morgause, Galeschin by Elaine, and Yvain by Morgan), who all become Knights of the Round Table. Various works also mention or feature his nieces. There are furthermore various other more distant family members, such as the case of the historical Romano-British leader Ambrosius Aurelianus being turned into his uncle (Uther's brother) in Goeffrey's tradition deriving Arthur's lineage from the self-proclaimed Western Roman Emperor Constantine II of Britain, who in this version of the legend is presented as Arthur's grandfather. One important figure of no actual blood relation to Arthur is Ector, who in the stories of Arthur's incognito youth is often secretly his adoptive father following the death of Uther soon after his birth. Offspring Although Arthur is given sons in both early and late Arthurian tales, he is rarely granted significant further generations of descendants. This is at least partly because of the premature deaths of his sons, who in the later tradition usually (and prominently) include Mordred. In some cases, including in Le Morte d'Arthur, Guinevere's failure to produce a legitimate heir contributes to the fall of Arthur. Amr is the first to be mentioned in Arthurian literature, appearing in the 9th-century Historia Brittonum: \\"There is another wonder in the region which is called Ercing. A tomb is located there next to a spring which is called Licat Amr; and the name of the man who is buried in the tomb was called thus: Amr. He was the son of Arthur the soldier, and Arthur himself killed and buried him in that very place. And men come to measure the grave and find it sometimes six feet in length, sometimes nine, sometimes twelve, sometimes fifteen. At whatever length you might measure it at one time, a second time you will not find it to have the same length ‚Äì and I myself have put this to the test.\\"Historia Brittonum, 73. Why Arthur chose or was forced to kill his son is never made clear. The only other reference to Amr comes in the post-Galfridian Welsh romance Geraint, where \\"Amhar son of Arthur\\" is one of Arthur‚Äôs four chamberlains along with Bedwyr's son Amhren.T. Jones and G. Jones, The Mabinogion (London: Dent, 1949), p.231. Gwydre is similarly unlucky, being slaughtered by the giant boar Twrch Trwyth in Culhwch and Olwen, along with two of Arthur's maternal uncles - no other references to either Gwydre or Arthur's uncles survive.R. Bromwich and D. Simon Evans, Culhwch and Olwen. An Edition and Study of the Oldest Arthurian Tale (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1992), lines 1116‚Äì7 and note on Gwydre; T. Jones and G. Jones, The Mabinogion (London: Dent, 1949), pp.132, 134. Another son, known only from a possibly 15th-century Welsh text, is said to have died on the field of Camlann: :Sanddef [Bryd Angel] drive the crow :off the face of Duran [son of Arthur]. :Dearly and belovedly his mother raised him. ::Arthur [sang it]J. Rowland, Early Welsh Saga Poetry: a Study and Edition of the Englynion (Cambridge, 1990), pp.250-1. More is known of Arthur's son Llacheu. He is one of the \\"Three Well-Endowed Men of the Island of Britain\\", according to the Triad 4, and he fights alongside Cei in the early Arthurian poem Pa gur yv y porthaur?.R. Bromwich, Trioedd Ynys Prydein: the Welsh Triads (Cardiff: University of Wales, 1978), no. 4; P. Sims-Williams, \\"The Early Welsh Arthurian Poems\\" in R. Bromwich, A.O.H. Jarman and B.F. Roberts (edd.) The Arthur of the Welsh (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1991), pp.33‚Äì71 at p.43. Like his father is in Y Gododdin, Llacheu appears in the 12th-century and later Welsh poetry as a standard of heroic comparison and he also seems to have been similarly a figure of local topographic folklore too.O. J. Padel, Arthur in Medieval Welsh Literature (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 2000), pp.55‚Äì6, 99; P. Sims-Williams, \\"The Early Welsh Arthurian Poems\\" in R. Bromwich, A.O.H. Jarman and B.F. Roberts (edd.) The Arthur of the Welsh (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1991), pp.33‚Äì71 at p.4.4. Taken together, it is generally agreed that all these references indicate that Llacheu was a figure of considerable importance in the early Arthurian cycle.T. Green, Concepts of Arthur (Stroud: Tempus, 2007), pp.168-9. Nonetheless, Llacheu too dies, with the speaker in the pre-Galfridian poem Ymddiddan Gwayddno Garanhir ac Gwyn fab Nudd remembering that he had \\"been where Llacheu was slain / the son of Arthur, awful in songs / when ravens croaked over blood.\\"J.B. Coe and S. Young, The Celtic Sources for the Arthurian Legend (Llanerch, 1995), p.125. The romances' Loholt (Lohot) usually appears as a son by Guinevere in the works such as Lanzelet (as Ilinot/Elinot) and Perlesvaus, but in the Vulgate Cycle he is Arthur's illegitimate son by Lyzianor (Lionors).Arthurian Romances trans. W. Kibler and C. W. Carroll (Harmondsworth, Penguin, 1991); The High Book of the Grail: A translation of the thirteenth century romance of Perlesvaus trans. N. Bryant (Brewer, 1996); Lancelot-Grail: The Old French Arthurian Vulgate and Post-Vulgate in Translation trans. N. J. Lacy (New York: Garland, 1992-6), 5 vols. He is treacherously killed by Kay so that the latter can take credit for the defeat of the giant Logrin in Perlesvaus,The High Book of the Grail: A translation of the 13th-century romance of Perlesvaus trans. N. Bryant (Brewer, 1996). and dies from illness after his rescue from the Dolorous Prison by Lancelot in the Vulgate. Thomas Malory renamed him as Borre (Bohart, Boarte) le Cure Hardy, apparently conflating him with another character from the French texts. Medraut/Mordred is a major exception to this tradition of a childless death for Arthur's sons. Mordred, like Amr, is killed by Arthur ‚Äì at Camlann ‚Äì according to Geoffrey of Monmouth and the post- Galfridian tradition but, unlike the others, he is ascribed two sons, both of whom rose against Arthur's successor and cousin Constantine III with the help of the Saxons. However, in Geoffrey's Historia (when Arthur's killing of Mordred and Mordred's sons first appear), Mordred was not yet actually Arthur's son.Geoffrey of Monmouth, Historia Regum Britanniae Book 11.2-4. His relationship with Arthur was once more reinterpreted in the Vulgate Cycle, as he was made the result of an unwitting incest between Arthur and his sister.Lancelot-Grail: The Old French Arthurian Vulgate and Post-Vulgate in Translation trans. N. J. Lacy (New York: Garland, 1992-1996). This tale is preserved in the later romances, with the motif of Arthur knowing by Merlin that Mordred would grow up to kill him, and so by the time of Post-Vulgate Cycle Arthur has devised a plot, Herod-like, to kill all children born on the same day as Mordred in order to try to save himself from this fate.See A. Varin, \\"Mordred, King Arthur's Son\\" in Folklore 90 (1979), pp.167‚Äì77 on Mordred's birth, its origins and Arthur's reaction to his dream. The Post- Vulgate also features another of Arthur's illegitimate sons, who survives almost as long as Mordred. After Arthur forces himself on a daughter of a knight named Tanas, he orders the child to be named either Guenevere or Arthur the Less (Arthur le Petit). After growing up with a foster mother, the boy is knighted by Tristan and soon proves to be superior to even Percival and Gawain. However, he is publicly known only as the Unknown Knight as he agreed to keep his lineage secret as to not shame King Arthur with the story of his mother's rape. Loyal to his father, he fights in several wars against domestic and foreign enemies, and is one of Galahad's companions during the Grail Quest. After his father's death, he is defeated by Bleoberis in his vengeful duel to the death at the end of the cycle. His dying curse on the now heirless kingdom of Logres manifests eventually itself through the evil King Mark's invasion that destroys almost all remnants of King Arthur's rule.Arthur's Children in Le Petit Bruit and the Post-Vulgate Cycle by Ad Putter, University of Bristol. Later literature has expanded Arthur's family further. Rauf de Boun's 1309 Petit Brut lists Arthur's son Adeluf III as a king of Britain, also mentioning his other children Morgan the Black and Patrick the Red by an unnamed Fairy Queen. Richard Johnson's 16th-century romance Tom a Lincoln adds another illegitimate son, the eponymous Tom by the Fairy Queen named Caelia; through Tom, Arthur is also given grandsons, referred to as the Black Knight and the Faerie Knight. Several, usually post-medieval works, such as Henry Fielding's 18th-century play Tom Thumb, have occasionally given Arthur more daughters. Another such daughter is the eponymous heroine Melora (Mhel√≥ra) from the 16th-century Irish romance The Adventures of Orlando and Melora (Eachtra Mhel√≥ra agus Orlando), who dresses as a man and becomes known as the Knight of the Blue Surcoat in order to save her lover Orlando from Merlin's spell. In Walter Scott's 18th-century poem The Bridal of Triermain, Gyneth is Arthur's daughter from his romance with a half-djinn queen Guendolen, who is punished by Merlin for her vanity by being put to magic slumber for several centuries until she is found and awakened with a kiss. One of Arthur's daughters from earlier texts is Hilde mentioned in the 13th-century Icelandic √ûi√∞reks saga (Thidrekssaga), while the M√∂ttuls saga from around the same period features a son of Arthur by the name Aristes. Bloodline claims Supposed direct lineage from King Arthur has been professed by some English monarchs, especially the ones of Welsh descent. Among them were the 15th- century King Henry VII (through Cadwaladr ap Cadwallon), who even named his first-born son after Arthur, and the 16th-century Queen Elizabeth I. In Scotland, descent from King Arthur is included in the genealogies of both Clan Arthur and Clan Campbell in rival claims.https://www.scotsman.com/news/clans- touch-swords-battle-crown-arthur-their-own-2507451 References Bibliography *Bromwich, R.

The altar, centrally located in the sanctuary, is to be the focus of attention in the church.Edward McNamara, \\"Central Focus at Mass\\" At the beginning of the Roman Rite of Mass, the priest first of all reverences the altar with a kiss and only after that goes to the chair at which he presides over the Introductory Rites and the Liturgy of the Word. Except in Solemn Mass, a priest celebrating Tridentine Mass (use of the 1962 version of which is by the 7 July 2007 motu proprio Summorum Pontificum still authorized for use both privately and, under certain conditions, publicly) remains at the altar the whole time after saying the Prayers at the Foot of the Altar. The rite of dedication of a church includes that of the altar of the church and celebration of Mass on that altar is \\"the principal and the most ancient part of the whole rite\\" in accordance with the saying of the Fathers of the Church: \\"This altar should be an object of awe: by nature it is stone, but it is made holy when it receives the body of Christ. In Greek and some other languages used in the Byzantine Rite, the same word (Œ≤œâŒºœåœÇ in Greek) is used for an altar (in general) and for the area surrounding it; that is to say, the entire sanctuary. To refer unambiguously to the altar itself the terms \\"Holy Table\\" (Greek ·ºâŒ≥ŒØŒ± Œ§œÅŒ¨œÄŒµŒ∂Œ±) or \\"Throne\\" (chu Prest√≥l) are used.  Obligatory  The celebration of the Eucharist in a sacred place such as a church is to take place on an altar; however, outside a sacred place, it may take place on a suitable table, always with the use of a cloth, a corporal, a cross, and candles. Augustin Joseph Schulte says that Pope Sixtus II (257-259) was the first to prescribe that Mass should be celebrated on an altar, and that there are accounts according to which Saint Lucian of Antioch celebrated Mass on his breast whilst in prison (312), and Theodore, Bishop of Tyre on the hands of his deacons.Augustine Joseph Schulte, \\"Altar (in Liturgy)\\" in The Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1907)  Position  Altar of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere, as arranged in 1700. The altar is at the west end of the church. Historically, the priest, looking east, faced the altar and the people. Early Christians faced east at prayer, a practice witnessed to by Clement of Alexandria (c. 150 ‚Äì c. 215),Clement of Alexandria, Stromata, book 7, chapter 7 Tertullian (c. 160 ‚Äì c. 220),Tertuliano, Apologeticus, 16.9‚Äì10; translation and Origen (c. 185 ‚Äì 253).Origenis in Numeros homiliae, Homilia V, 1; translation Churches were generally built with an east-west axis. In the earliest churches in Rome the altar stood at the west end and the priest stood at the western side of the altar facing east and facing the people and the doors of the church. Examples are the Constantinian St. Peter's Basilica and the original Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls. In the East, early churches had the altar at the east end and the priest, facing east, stood at the western side of the altar, with his back to the people and the doors. This later became the common practice also in western Europe. It was adopted in Rome only in the 8th or 9th century.The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005 ), article \\"westward position\\" In the succeeding centuries the eastward position in prayer was abandoned, as to a large extent was also, especially in cities, choice of an east-west axis for church buildings, and the end, furthest from the main door, in which the altar stood, could be oriented towards any point of the compass, although by convention churches are always described as though the altar is at the east end, the terms liturgical east and west often being used. 1742 Rococo altar in Kirchheim am Ries, Germany. Priest and people on the same side of the altar, even if the altar is at the west end of the church. The churches that Christians built after the legalization of their religion in the Roman Empire were not modelled on pagan temples, which were not intended to accommodate large numbers of people. The model used was that of the public basilicas that served for meetings such as sessions of law courts. These were generally spacious, and the interior was divided by two or four rows of pillars, forming a central nave and side aisles. At the end was a raised platform, often situated in an apse, with seats for the magistrates. In basilica-style Christian churches the apse was reserved for the bishop and his clergy; the faithful occupied the centre and the side aisles, and between the clergy and people stood the altar.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, \\"Basilica\\" Originally a church had only one altar. Ignatius the Martyr, Cyprian, Irenaeus, and Jerome, speak of the altar in the singular. Later, side chapels were added and an altar placed in each. Gregory the Great sent relics for four altars to Palladius, Bishop of Saintes, France, who had placed in a church thirteen altars, four of which remained unconsecrated for want of relics. This is still the practice in the East, where concelebration never ceased to be practised. In the West, the introduction of the celebration by each priest individually gave rise to the need for several altars in some churches, particularly in monasteries. With the reintroduction of concelebration since the Second Vatican Council and the reintroduction of concelebration, there is no longer a need for a multiplicity of altars in the main body of a church. Hence, \\"in building new churches, it is preferable for a single altar to be erected, one that in the gathering of the faithful will signify the one Christ and the one Eucharist of the Church. In already existing churches, however, when the old altar is so positioned that it makes the people‚Äôs participation difficult but cannot be moved without damage to artistic value, another fixed altar, skillfully made and properly dedicated, should be erected and the sacred rites celebrated on it alone. In order that the attention of the faithful not be distracted from the new altar, the old altar should not be decorated in any special way.\\"  Material  The earliest altars for celebrating the Christian Eucharist were of wood and identical in form with ordinary house tables, as was doubtless used at the Last Supper. The only such ancient wooden table still preserved is in the Lateran Basilica, and fragments of another are preserved in the Santa Pudenziana church in Rome. A tradition that lacks convincing evidence says that Saint Peter celebrated the Eucharist on both.Maurice Hassett, \\"History of the Christian Altar\\" in The Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1907 Optatus of Mileve reproves the Donatists for breaking up and using for firewood the altars of the Catholic churches,Optatus of Milevis, De Schismate Donatistarum, book 6, I and Augustine of Hippo reports that Bishop Maximianus was beaten with the wood of the altar under which he had taken refuge. St. Helena (c. 250 ‚Äì c. 330) gave golden altars ornamented with precious stones to the original Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Pulcheria (398 or 399 ‚Äì 453), sister of Theodosius II, presented an altar of gold to the Basilica of Constantinople. Popes Sixtus III (432‚Äì440) and Hilary (461‚Äì468) presented several altars of silver to the churches of Rome. Gregory of Nyssa (c. 335 ‚Äì c. 395) speaks of the consecration of an altar made of stone (De Christi Baptismate). Since wood is subject to decay, the baser metals to corrosion, and the more precious metals were too expensive, stone became in course of time the ordinary material for an altar. The earliest decree of a council prescribing that an altar which is to be consecrated should be of stone is that of the provincial council of Epeaune (Pamiers), France, in 517. The present discipline of the Latin Church distinguishes between the \\"table\\" of an altar (the top) and the supports or base. The latter, provided it is dignified and solid, may be of any material. On the other hand, \\"in keeping with the Church‚Äôs traditional practice and with what the altar signifies, the table of a fixed altar should be of stone and indeed of natural stone\\", except where the episcopal conference authorizes the use of another material (such as wood) that is dignified, solid and well-crafted. \\"A movable altar may be constructed of any noble and solid material suited to liturgical use, according to the traditions and usages of the different regions.\\" In Eastern Christianity (including the Eastern Catholic Churches) the use of stone, wood or metal is permitted.  Form  The usage of celebrating the Eucharist on the tombs of martyrs is by the Liber Pontificalis ascribed, probably mistakenly, to Pope Felix I (269‚àí274). According to Johann Peter Kirsch the usage is likely to have preceded Pope Felix and to have concerned the celebration of Mass privately in the underground cemeteries known as the catacombs: the solemn celebration of the martyrs took place in the above-ground basilicas built over their place of burial.Johann Peter Kirsch, \\"Pope St. Felix I\\" in The Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1909) Within the catacomb crypts the Eucharist could be celebrated on a stone slab placed over the grave or sarcophagus of one or more martyrs within a space hollowed out of the tufa walls so as to form an arch-like niche. Both in the catacombs and in the above-ground churches the altar could also be a square or oblong block of stone resting on one or more columns (up to six) or on a masonry structure that enclosed the relics of martyrs. Instead of masonry, upright stone slabs could be used, thus forming, with the top slab, a stone chest containing the relics. This no doubt brought about both a change of form, from that of a simple table to that of a chest or tomb. Latin Church liturgy, before the reforms of the second half of the twentieth century, had complex rules about a distinction between a \\"fixed altar\\" and a \\"portable altar\\". The former term then meant an altar table (the top slab) with its supports, all of which had been consecrated as a single unit, while the latter term meant the (usually small) altar stone or any altar table consecrated separately from its supports.1917 Code of Canon Law, canon 1197 These rules no longer hold: today \\"an altar is said to be fixed if it is so constructed as to be attached to the floor and not removable; it is said to be movable if it can be displaced.\\" Usually an altar should be fixed and ritually dedicated, but a mere blessing is sufficient for a movable altar. In a church a fixed altar is desirable, but in other places set aside for sacred celebrations the altar may be movable.  Relics  The practice of celebrating the Eucharist over the graves of martyrs is probably the origin of the rule that demanded that every altar must contain the relics of martyrs. The General Instruction of the Roman Missal states that \\"the practice of the deposition of relics of Saints, even those not Martyrs, under the altar to be dedicated is fittingly retained. However, care should be taken to ensure the authenticity of such relics.\\" The Caeremoniale Episcoporum adds: \\"Such relics should be of a size sufficient for them to be recognized as parts of human bodies; hence excessively small relics of one or more saints must not be placed beneath the altar. The greatest care must be taken to determine whether the relics in question are authentic; it is better for an altar to be dedicated without relics than to have relics of doubtful authenticity placed beneath it. A reliquary must not be placed upon the altar or set into the table of the altar; it must be placed beneath the table of the altar, as the design of the altar permits.\\"Edward McNamara, \\"Liturgy: Relics in the Altar\\" Altar stone with sepulchrum at Sint-Niklaaskerk, Mesen, Belgium In earlier centuries minute portions of relics were inserted into the table of the altar and also into the altar stones that at that time were called movable altars. The cavity into which they were placed was called the sepulchrum (Latin for \\"tomb\\"). The relics could be of several saints, but two had to be martyrs until 1906, when the Congregation of Rites decided that it was sufficient to enclose relics of two canonized saints of whom one was a martyr. The relics were placed in a reliquary of lead, silver, or gold, large enough to contain also three grains of incense and a small attestation of consecration on a piece of parchment. In an altar stone, the relics were inserted directly, without a reliquary. There were precise rules also about where exactly in the altar the relics were to be placed and about the stone cover for the cavity.Augustin Joseph Schulte, \\"Altar Cavity\\" in The Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1907) In ancient churches in which the altar is built over the tomb of a saint or over the relics that have been placed there, a niche below the altar offered a view of the tomb or reliquary and allowed the faithful to touch it and to place in contact with it that would then be venerated as second-class relics. The best known example is the Niche of the Palliums in St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican. It is now approached by descending steps, since the present floor is considerably higher than that of the original basilica.The Confessio Other churches also have in front of the altar a similar semicircular hollow area, known as the confessio, even if the altar is not built over a holy tomb, as in the Lateran Basilica and the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore.Marcel Metzger, History of the Liturgy: The Major Stages (Liturgical Press 2016), p. 76William E. Addis, A Catholic Dictionary (Aeterna Press 1961)  Surroundings  Modern altar at Church of San Giovanni Battista, Mogno, 1996 \\"The sanctuary is the place where the altar stands, the Word of God is proclaimed, and the Priest, the Deacon, and the other ministers exercise their functions. It should be appropriately marked off from the body of the church either by its being somewhat elevated or by a particular structure and ornamentation. It should, moreover, be large enough to allow the Eucharist to be easily celebrated and seen.\\" Altar rails in Saint Teresa's Carmelite Church, Dublin The sanctuary or chancel or presbytery, as well as being elevated above the floor level of the rest of the church, is often, though less frequently than in the past, demarcated by altar rails (sometimes called a communion rail). In ancient churches such wooden or metal railings were called cancelli or, if of marble slabs, transennae. In Eastern Catholic Churches of Byzantine tradition, the sanctuary is usually cut off from the view of the congregation by an iconostasis, and in those whose tradition is that of Oriental Orthodoxy, such as the Armenian Catholic Church, a curtain may hide it from view at certain points of the liturgy. Even within an elevated sanctuary, the altar itself is often placed on a higher platform set off by one or more steps. The platform is known as the predella.Oxford Dictionaries The altar may also be marked with a surmounting ciborium, sometimes called a baldachin. As well as the altar, the sanctuary contains the credence table, the ambo and the seats for the clergy. = Steps = Saint Remigius Church, Simpelveld, Netherlands Christian altars were not at first placed on steps. Those in the catacombs stood on the pavement. The altars of churches in Rome were usually erected over the confessio or ŒºŒ±œÅœÑœçœÅŒπŒøŒΩ, the spot where the remains of a martyr were deposited. By the fourth century they were placed on one step above the floor of the sanctuary. Later, the number of steps was increased. It became the norm that the main altar of a church should be raised above the level of the sanctuary by three steps, while side altars had a single step. The papal altar in St Peter's Basilica in the Vatican is approached by seven steps.The Papal Altar & Baldacchino An odd number was always chosen. Since it was considered proper to use the right foot in taking a first step, this ensured that the priest, having ascended the first of the steps with his right foot would also enter the predella (the platform or footpace on which the altar stood) with his right foot. The same rule applied to pre-Christian temples, as indicated by Vitruvius in his De architectura: \\"The number of steps in front should always be odd, since, in that case, the right foot, which begins the ascent, will be that which first alights on the landing of the temple.\\"De architectura III, 4, 4 with link to the Latin text The Satyricon attributed to Petronius also mentions the custom of dextro pede (right foot first).Satyricon, 30 with link to the Latin text In late medieval and Tridentine times, elaborate rules were developed not only about the number of steps, but also about the material used, the height of each step, the breadth of the tread, the covering with carpets or rugs (both of which were to be removed from the stripping of the altars on Holy Thursday until just before the Mass on Holy Saturday morning, and the carpet alone at a Requiem Mass), and the colour and design of the carpet. On these matters articles by Augustin Joseph Schulte in the 1907 Catholic Encyclopedia may be consulted.\\"Altar Steps\\" and \\"Altar Carpets\\" in The Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1907) The present General Instruction of the Roman Missal makes no mention of altar steps or carpets. = Canopy = Ciborium over the altar of the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio in Milan. Note curtain rods. A canopy placed over an altar is called a ciborium (a word of which \\"civory\\" is a variant form) or baldachin.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, art. \\"Baldachin Gian Lorenzo Bernini's St. Peter's Baldachin is the most famous of these structures. Early extant ciboria in Ravenna and Rome usually consist of four columns topped by a pyramidal or gabled roof. On some, rods between the columns indicate that they were provided with curtains that could be closed at certain points of the liturgy, as is the custom in the Armenian and Coptic Rites. Some later churches without a ciborium hung a curtain on the wall behind the altar, with two curtain- bearing rods extending at the sides of the altar.Augustine Joseph Schulte, \\"Altar Curtain\\" in The Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1907) From at latest the 4th century, the altar was covered from the view of the congregation at points during Mass by altar curtains hanging from rods supported by a ciborium, riddel posts, or some other arrangement. This practice declined as the introduction of other structures that screened the altar, such as the iconostasis in the East and rood screen and pulpitum in the West, meant that the congregation could barely see the altar anyway. In early times, before the break-up of the Roman Empire exposed such objects to sacking and looting, the consecrated bread of the Eucharist (the reserved sacrament) was kept in a gold or silver dove, sometimes enclosed in a silver tower, suspended by fine chains from the ciborium that sheltered the altar.Mauro Piacenza, \\"The casing of the Eucharist\\" in 30DAYS, June 2005 Instead of a four-column ciborium a movable canopy (called a tester) was in some churches suspended from the ceiling above the altar or a fixed canopy attached to the wall was employed.Augustin Joseph Schulte, \\"Altar Canopy\\" in The Catholic Encyclopedia (1907) Use of some such canopy over every altar was decreed in documents of the Tridentine period, but the decrees were generally ignored even in that period.Peter Frederick Anson, Churches - Their Plan and Furnishing (Read Books 2013, reprint of work originally published in 1948) = Ledge = Altar of Newman University Church, Dublin, with an altar ledge occupying the only space between it and the wall In medieval churches the altar, no longer standing between priest and people, grew considerably in size. The bishop's seat was moved to one side and the elaborate altar was placed against, or at least close to, the wall of the apse. The Roman Missal of Pope Pius V, whose use was made generally obligatory throughout the Latin Church in 1570 laid down that, for Mass, a cross should be placed in the middle of the altar, flanked by at least two candlesticks with lit candles, and that the central altar card should be placed at the foot of the cross. It stated also that \\"nothing whatever unrelated to the sacrifice of the Mass and the adornment of the altar itself is to be placed on it\\".Rubricae generales Missalis, XX ‚Äì De Praeparatione Altaris, et Ornamentorum ejus Although the Roman Missal thus spoke of the cross and the candlesticks as on the altar, it became customary to add to the edge of altars one or more steps, slightly higher than the altar itself, on which to place the crucifix, candlesticks, flowers, reliquaries, and other ornaments. These adjuncts became common when, in the sixteenth century, church tabernacles were added to altars, requiring that most of the altars concerned be provided with these superstructures, which are known as altar ledges, degrees, gradini or superstructural steps. The front of these steps was sometimes painted and decorated. Thus the gradini of Brunelleschi's church of Santo Spirito, Florence displayed scenes from the Passion of Christ.Augustin Joseph Schulte, \\"Altar Ledge\\" in The Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1907) 21st-century altars are generally freestanding and have no superstructures. = Altarpiece = Gigantic reredos dwarfing the altar of St. Michael's Church, Munich During much of the second millennium, altars in western Europe, which for the most part were then placed close to a wall or attached to it. were often backed by a painting or sculpture that visually seemed to form a single unit with the altar. Late Gothic triptych over altar, Hallstatt, woodcut 1858 There has been no Church legislation on these artworks, which vary enormously in form. The terminology, too, is somewhat fluid.Colum Hourihane, The Grove Encyclopedia of Medieval Art and Architecture (Oxford University Press 2012), Volume 1, p. 44 The term \\"altarpiece\\" is applied very widely to them. A reredos is normally a quite large altarpiece placed on the ground between the altar and the wall and can include paintings or sculptures and may even hold stands for flowers and candlesticks. A retable is normally placed on the altar itself or on a stand behind it or may be attached to the wall. Such an artwork is sometimes called a dossal, a term often reserved instead for an ornamental cloth hanging behind the altar. A painting or a mosaic on the wall can serve the same purpose as a removable altarpiece. An altarpiece may be a single painting or a composition of several panels placed side by side. Especially in the latter case, a series of smaller-scale paintings may act as a kind of base for the main images. This base is called the predella (not to be confused with the same term when used of the platform on which the altar sits), and may illustrate episodes in the life of the saint whom the altar celebrates. Some altarpieces are known as winged altarpieces. In these the fixed central panel is flanked by two or more hinged panels, which can be moved to hide the central painting and the paintings on the side-panels themselves, leaving visible only the reverse of the side-panels, which are usually relatively plain. They can then be opened to display the images on feastdays. According to the number of panels, these are called triptychs (if of three panels) or polyptychs (if the panels are more than three).  Cloth coverings  For the celebration of Mass, the altar should be covered by at least one white altar cloth: \\"Out of reverence for the celebration of the memorial of the Lord and for the banquet in which the Body and Blood of the Lord are offered, there should be, on an altar where this is celebrated, at least one cloth, white in colour, whose shape, size, and decoration are in keeping with the altar's structure.\\" The pre-1969 regulations prescribed three white altar cloths, the topmost being long enough to reach the ground at both ends.1960 Code of Rubrics, 526; Pre-1962 Missale Romanum, Rubricae generales Missalis, XX ‚Äì De praeparatione Altaris et Ornamentorum ejus 19th and early 20th-century regulations required that the cloths be of linen or hemp and not of any other material, even if of equivalent or higher quality.Augustin Joseph Schulte, \\"Altar Cloths\\" in The Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1907) In addition, it was customary to place directly on the altar, beneath the three obligatory altar cloths, a cloth waxed on one side that was called the chrismale or cere cloth and that served to keep the altar cloths dry. When the altar is not used for a liturgical service, the altar cloths may be protected against being stained or soiled by placing over them an altar protector or altar cover made of cloth, baize or velvet large enough to hang down a little on all sides. This is known as the vesperale or stragulum.Augustin Joseph Schulte, \\"Altar Protector\\" in The Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1907) Altar with drapery antependium in the style of Catholic churches of the 19th and early 20th century When in the period immediately preceding the late twentieth century altars were generally built attached to or close to a wall, it became customary to cover with drapery the front of the altar, the only part visible to the congregation. This drapery was called the antependium or altar frontal, terms often applied also to sculptural or other ornamentation of the altar front itself. The elaborate rules then prevailing in the Latin Church in its regard are indicated in the article about it in the 1907 Catholic Encyclopedia. It covered the whole front of the altar, partial coverings being forbidden. It was obligatory unless the altar front was particularly artistic, and even in such cases it should be used on more solemn occasions. Its origin was thought to have derived from the curtains or veils of silk or other precious material hanging over the open space under the altar table to preserve the shrine of saints deposited there.Augustin Joseph Schulte, \\"Altar Frontal\\" in The Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1907) In the Middle Ages a similar function was performed by an \\"altar stole\\", an ornament in the shape of the ends of a stole attached to the front of the altar.Joseph Schulte, \\"Altar Stole\\" in The Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1907) In the 21st century the altar in a Catholic church is generally left visible.  Candles  Seven lighted candles at Mass celebrated by the diocesan bishop \\"On or next to the altar are to be placed candlesticks with lighted candles: at least two in any celebration, or even four or six, especially for a Sunday Mass or a Holyday of Obligation, or if the Diocesan Bishop celebrates, then seven candlesticks with lighted candles [...] The candles [...] may also be carried in the procession at the Entrance.\\" While only two lighted candles are now obligatory and may be placed beside the altar rather than on it, the pre-1969 rubrics (which did not envisage the candles being brought in the Entrance procession) required that they be on the altar itself (in practice, however, they were often placed on the altar shelf instead) and should be four at a Low Mass celebrated by a bishop, four or six at a Missa cantata, six at a Solemn Mass and seven at a Pontifical High Mass. In the last case, the seventh candle was not lit if the bishop was celebrating outside his own diocese. There were also rules, developed over centuries, about the material from which the candlesticks were to be made and about the relative heights of the candles. Candles appear not to have been placed on the altar before the twelfth century, but earlier writings speak of acolytes carrying candlesticks, which, however, they placed on the floor of the sanctuary or near the corners of the altar, as is still the custom in the Eastern Orthodox Church.Augustin Joseph Schulte, \\"Altar Candles\\" in The Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1907) Liturgical books of the same pre-1969 period speak of the placing of flowers (even good-quality artificial ones) in vases between the candlesticks on the altar.Augustin Joseph Schulte, \\"Altar Vase\\" in The Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1907) The present rule is: \\"During Advent the floral decoration of the altar should be marked by a moderation suited to the character of this time of year, without expressing in anticipation the full joy of the Nativity of the Lord. During Lent it is forbidden for the altar to be decorated with flowers. Exceptions, however, are Laetare Sunday (Fourth Sunday of Lent), Solemnities, and Feasts. Floral decoration should always show moderation and be arranged around the altar rather than on the altar table. For only what is required for the celebration of the Mass may be placed on the altar table\\".  Tabernacle sometimes placed on an altar  Tabernacles began to be placed on altars in the sixteenth century. The 1570 Roman Missal of Pope Pius V did not envisage placing the tabernacle on an altar: it laid down instead that the altar card containing some of the principal prayers of the Mass should rest against a cross placed midway on the altar (Rubricae generales Missalis, XX - De Praeparatione Altaris, et Ornamentorum eius). However, in 1614 Pope Paul V ordered the churches of his diocese of Rome to put the tabernacle on some altar. Whether on the main altar of the church or in a special chapel, the tabernacle became more and more large and ornate, to the extent of dominating the altar. The present rules are as follows: * In accordance with the structure of each church and legitimate local customs, the Most Blessed Sacrament should be reserved in a tabernacle in a part of the church that is truly noble, prominent, conspicuous, worthily decorated, and suitable for prayer. The tabernacle should usually be the only one, be irremovable, be made of solid and inviolable material that is not transparent, and be locked in such a way that the danger of profanation is prevented to the greatest extent possible. Moreover, it is appropriate that before it is put into liturgical use, the tabernacle be blessed according to the rite described in the Roman Ritual. * It is more appropriate as a sign that on an altar on which Mass is celebrated there not be a tabernacle in which the Most Holy Eucharist is reserved. Consequently, it is preferable that the tabernacle be located, according to the judgement of the Diocesan Bishop: ** either in the sanctuary, apart from the altar of celebration, in an appropriate form and place, not excluding its being positioned on an old altar no longer used for celebration; ** or even in some chapel suitable for the private adoration and prayer of the faithful and organically connected to the church and readily noticeable by the Christian faithful. * In accordance with traditional custom, near the tabernacle a special lamp, fueled by oil or wax, should shine permanently to indicate the presence of Christ and honour it.

The film also examines attitudes held by the British and Americans, toward the Japanese. It was written and produced by Laurence Rees and narrated by Samuel West. Synopsis In the First World War the Japanese fought on the same side as the British and captured German soldiers who were fighting in Asia. They were treated well, even, following an Imperial Order of 1882, 'as guests'. The question arises: \\"How could the Japanese behave with such kindness towards their prisoners in World War I and then, less than thirty years later, act with such cruelty?\\" Part One - Turning Against the West In the opening decades of the twentieth century Japan appeared enthusiastically to adopt western values, 'from dancing to democracy'. As far back as 1885 a Japanese academic had coined what became a popular slogan - Abandon Asia, go for the West. Crown Prince Hirohito had visited London in the early 1920s. \\"In the 1920s the Japanese were being taught that their emperor was more than just a mere human, he was a living god - it was in the interests of one group more than any other that the Emperor be perceived as an all- powerful living god - the armed forces.\\" Like the rest of the country, the Japanese monarchy was changing too - but not in a way that made it resemble Western royalty. In the 1920s the Japanese were being taught that their emperor, living in a park in central Tokyo, was more than just a mere human being - he was called a living god. Children were educated to think of the emperor as a god in the form of a human being. In Japan it was in the interests of one group more than any other that the emperor be perceived as an all powerful living god - the armed forces. Only ultimately accountable to their supreme commander Hirohito, as long as they acted in the name of their 'divine' emperor, elected Japanese politicians found it almost impossible to control them - and by the late 1920s many within the army thought that Japan should act decisively, and expand. Masatake Okumiya (Japanese Imperial Navy): \\"Japan's population was increasing - its natural resources could not sustain such an increase. Ideally we hoped to receive co-operation from other countries to solve the problem but, back then, the world was under the control of the west and a peaceful solution seemed impossible. We decided, as Britain, America and France had done in the past from time to time, to use force to solve the problem.\\" By the early 1930s western countries had colonized much of Asia. By the early 1930s western countries had colonized much of Asia..\\" photo: French soldiers in the Tonkin circa 1890 Britain - Hong Kong, Burma, Malaya; Holland - Dutch East Indies; U.S - Philippines; France - French Indochina. Japan, late on the scene, only had under its control, Taiwan, a few islands in the Pacific, and Korea. In 1931, the Japanese army launched an attack on Manchuria. At the League of Nations in Geneva the Japanese actions were condemned. Japan left the League accusing the Western powers of hypocrisy. In Japan, in face of growing economic depression and a sense of the West's double standards, the call was to expand even further and conquer more territory within Asia. By 1937 the Japanese army was five times what it had been around 1900. Many in the military thought that in an army that had grown so much, to maintain discipline, it was necessary to make the training of recruits more brutal. If the soldiers made the smallest mistake they were beaten, with fists or bamboo sticks. Recruits were instructed also to hit each other. And the Japanese military did not just want to mould their own soldiers but the general population too. Japanese who adopted western values were ridiculed, women who rejected a tradition of subservience were attacked. Many ordinary Japanese, as well as politicians and businesspeople, now supported the drive toward a bigger empire on the Asian mainland, and the minority who openly opposed military expansion risked assassination. Seven prominent Japanese, including two Prime Ministers, were murdered by army officers during the 1930s. Seeking to create a giant colony the Imperial army moved in 1937 into eastern China. The Chinese were not worthy of the land according to the dominant ideology; they were called bugs, animals, below-human. Yoshio Tsuchiya, (Japanese Secret Military Police):\\" The Chinese were inferior - didn't belong to the human race. That was the way we looked at it.\\" In December 1937 the Japanese Army reached the then capital of China, Nanking. (Film taken by John Magee is shown). Men were set on fire, women beaten, bayoneted, raped. After Nanking atrocities followed in the Chinese countryside - the Chinese used for bayonet practice. Yoshio Tsuchiya (imprisoned 1950-56 for war crimes): \\" The first time you still have a conscience and feel bad, but if you are honoured and given merit and praised, that will be the driving power for the second time - after the second time I didn't feel anything.\\" A soldier is asked why he felt no guilt or shame raping and killing women. He replies : \\" Because I was fighting for the emperor. He was a god; in the name of the emperor we could do whatever we wanted against the Chinese.\\" Meanwhile the god-emperor of Japan spent most of his time secluded behind the walls of his palace. Even today opinion is divided among historians as to the extent the emperor knew of the barbaric crimes his soldiers were committing in China. \\" What is certain is that no evidence has surfaced that he ever attempted to hold his soldiers to account for their vicious conduct in China\\" Rees's film concludes. Representative examples are then given of pre-Pearl Harbor attitudes towards the Japanese amongst the British and Americans. Sir Robert Brooke-Popham, overall Commander in Chief of the British in the Far East is quoted, and Gene La Rocque (USS Macdonough (DD-351) :\\" Our concept of the Japanese prior to Pearl Harbor was that they were a weak, not very sophisticated people..so foreign to us ..just of small stature, not a very friendly but also not a very intelligent group of people - obviously, of course, we were wrong.\\" Robert Brooke-Popham (at left) writing in January 1941 - \\" I had a good view across the barbed wire of various sub-human specimens which I was informed were Japanese soldiers. If these represent the average of the Japanese army I cannot believe they would form an intelligent fighting force.\\" But there was another western nation which did value the Japanese - Nazi Germany. Indeed, Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan wanted to form an alliance. A formal treaty of alliance was signed between Germany, Japan and Italy on 27 September 1940. Japan used the moment to move into northern Indo- China. This had been a French colony but the Germans had just overrun France so for the Japanese it was ripe for the picking. Japan wanted to create a greater East Asia co-prosperity sphere. The slogan was Asia for the Asians - in essence the locals were swapping one colonial master for another. In Washington the American government, nervous about Japanese colonial intentions, announced that fuel sales to Japan would be suspended if Japan did not reconsider her aggressive actions. With no fuel resources of its own Japan believed it could now either give up its imperial ambitions, or fight the Americans. They attacked Pearl Harbor and, moments after, attacked Hong Kong. As the Japanese advanced into Hong Kong the Chinese inhabitants of the city became a particular target. Rees's film interviews too a British nurse who tells of how, on 25 December 1941, the day of the British surrender, - nurses at the makeshift hospital at the Hong Kong Jockey Club were raped. By the spring of 1942 - Singapore (above), Burma, Malaya, and the Philippines were under Japanese control. By the spring of 1942, Singapore, Burma, Malaya, and the Philippines all fell to the Japanese. Japanese newsreel and commentary :\\" 60,000 prisoners were lined up along the road so that they could have the honour of seeing the great commander Yamashita. The prisoners consisted of soldiers from Britain, Malaya, Australia, India, a parade of mongrel troops.\\" About 350000 POWs eventually fell into Japanese hands in south-east Asia. More than one in four died in captivity. Part Two ‚Äì Death before Surrender Writer-producer Laurence Rees looks at the Kamikaze phenomenon - \\" What could be more impossible to understand?\\" [yet] he says, \\"one of the most extraordinary things which making the series has done is this - I think I understand now why some of them did it, down to a meeting with a kamikaze pilot, he actually volunteered to become a pilot - he explained the dreadful social pressure that he and his family were living under - if he didn't go to volunteer he knew his family would be ostracised, shunned, - from his point of view it was a sensible, sane thing to do.\\" When U.S. Marines tried to re-take Japanese-held islands like Tarawa in 1943, the ferocious way in which the Japanese were prepared to fight to the death did not make the Americans respect them more. To many Americans, their refusal to surrender, like their attack on Pearl Harbor and their mistreatment of prisoners, became another sign they were a dishonourable foe. Michael Witowich: \\"I thought they were very cruel, sadistic, and they wanted to die for their emperor and we had to go on and help them die for their emperor.\\" (The film soundtrack plays an excerpt from We're gonna have to slap, the dirty little jap, recorded New York, 18 February 1942). Gene La Rocque (USS MacDonough): \\"We had been taught that the Japanese were sub-human when we got into the attack, but of course we had no love for Hitler, or the Nazis - but we also had many people in America of German descent, Italian - it was an entirely different view we had of the Italians, of the Germans, than we had of the Japanese.\\" Rees's documentary shows a photo published in the war in Life ‚Äì the girlfriend of an American sailor next to a souvenir from him ‚Äì the skull of a Japanese signed by her boyfriend's comrades. Japanese soldiers fighting the Australians in New Guinea committed cannibalism. Japanese forces were sent to New Guinea in 1942 but without sufficient preparation ‚Äì they were simply abandoned. In late 1943, forbidden to surrender and cut off from their supplies, they began to starve ‚Äì some resorted to cannibalism of their own and enemy dead. According to Professor Yuki Tanaka: \\"The cannibalism was organised group practice, rather than individually practised.\\" A Japanese major-general wrote an order prohibiting the eating of human flesh but this meant flesh \\"excluding enemy flesh\\". The first signs that large numbers of civilians as well as soldiers might be prepared to die for their emperor rather than surrender came in 1944, south of the home islands of Japan, on the island of Saipan. Japanese propaganda about Saipan emphasised the nobility of dying in the struggle against the British and Americans. With the capture of islands like Tinian and Saipan, heavy bombers were now in easier range of targets on the home islands of Japan and the Allies now launched the biggest aerial bombardment the world had ever seen - more than 160000 tonnes of bombs were dropped on Japan in an effort to make the Japanese accept unconditional surrender. With the capture of islands like Saipan, heavy bombers were now in easier range of targets on the home islands of Japan - the Allies now launched the biggest aerial bombardment the world had ever seen. On 10 March 1945 Tokyo was fire bombed. Over 300 Boeing B-29 bombers dropped incendiaries which caused a fire storm. About 100,000 died. Despite the destruction in Tokyo opinion was still divided in the Japanese government in the months that followed about what should be done. Accepting unconditional surrender might, some feared, mean the elimination of the institution of the emperor itself. Hirohito and his military leaders believed that, in order to negotiate a more advantageous peace, Japan needed to win one big victory - and the Kamikaze would provide the means. Sporadic isolated kamikaze attacks had occurred in 1944 - now in the spring of 1945 kamikazes were to sortie en masse for the first time. A student from Tokashiki Island: \\"I didn't think that they were wasting their lives, I believed they were sacrificing their lives for their country. The Japanese people belonged to the emperor - we were his children.\\" The testimony of a pilot suggests that not all kamikaze volunteered as freely as the propaganda sometimes suggested. Kenichiro Oonuki: \\" All the fighter pilots, about 150 of us at the training base, were called in - a senior officer told us they were recruiting people for a special mission. They said, 'If you go on this mission, you won't come back alive.' Everyone thought this was ridiculous and nobody really was ready to go. We wanted to answer, 'No, I don't want to go'..But later on we thought, 'Wait, if we want to say no, can we really say it, can we say no to this officer?..We told each other that we should calm down and think about the consequences..if people rejected the offer they might be shunned and sent to the most severe battlefront in the south and would meet certain death anyway - then when their family was informed of this, how would they feel? They would be ostracised from the community...so nobody wanted to volunteer but everybody did..\\" The biggest kamikaze assault of the war was on the British and American fleets during the battle for Okinawa in the spring of 1945. The biggest Kamikaze assault of the war was on the British and American fleets during the battle for Okinawa in the spring of 1945 The British warships with their armoured decks did not suffer as much under kamikaze attacks as the Americans. In March 1945 as the kamikaze flew around them, the Americans landed on the small island of Tokishiki. As on Saipan, the civilians were told by the Japanese army that the Americans would rape and murder them and encouraged them to adopt kamikaze tactics. To some they gave two hand grenades ‚Äì one to throw at the Americans, the other to blow themselves up with. Shigeaki Kingjou, a student in 1945, looking back in the year 2000: \\"I think we were dreadfully manipulated - as I got older, my soul started to suffer. 55 years since the end of the war and I still suffer today.\\" By the spring of 1945, the Japanese empire had been pulled apart. Now the Imperial Japanese Army ordered a heroic stand to be made on Okinawa, less than from Tokyo. Okinawa - but on 1 April 1945 when 50000 American troops came ashore they found their arrival virtually unopposed. The Americans expected the Japanese to defend the beaches on Okinawa but on 1 April 1945 when 50000 American troops came ashore they found their arrival virtually unopposed. But more than 80000 Japanese troops were dug into the fabric of the island interior, some in concrete pill boxes underneath the trees. In Okinawa, as the Americans pushed to the south of the island there were many civilian suicides, some thousand at Cape Kyan. Once more the Japanese military played a crucial role in encouraging the civilian population to kill themselves ‚Äì on nearby islands where there were no Japanese soldiers there were no mass suicides. Around 8000 American troops, 60000 Japanese soldiers, and 150000 Japanese civilians died on Okinawa.

Compare: This interaction is made up of three parts: the customer journey, the brand touchpoints the customer interacts with, and the environments the customer experiences (including digital environment) during their experience. A good customer experience means that the individual's experience during all points of contact matches the individual's expectations. Gartner asserts the importance of managing the customer's experience. Customer experience implies customer involvement at different levels ‚Äì such as rational, emotional, sensorial, physical, and spiritual. Customers respond diversely to direct and indirect contact with a company. Direct contact usually occurs when the purchase or use is initiated by the customer. Indirect contact often involves advertising, news reports, unplanned encounters with sales representatives, word-of-mouth recommendations or criticisms. Customer experience encompasses every aspect of a company‚Äôs offering‚Äîthe quality of customer care, but also advertising, packaging, product and service features, ease of use, and reliability. Creating direct relationships in the place where customers buy, use and receive services by a business intended for customers such as instore or face to face contact with the customer which could be seen through interacting with the customer through the retail staff. We then have indirect relationships which can take the form of unexpected interactions through a company's product representative, certain services or brands and positive recommendations ‚Äì or it could even take the form of \\"criticism, advertising, news, reports\\" and many more along that line.

Some companies are known to segment the customer experience into interactions through the web and social media, while others define human interaction such as over-the-phone customer service or face-to-face retail service as the customer experience. According to Forrester Research (via Fast Company), the six disciplines for great customer experience are strategy, customer understanding, design, measurement, governance and culture. A company's ability to deliver an experience that sets it apart in the eyes of its customers will increase the amount of consumer spending with the company and inspire loyalty to its brand. According to Jessica Sebor, \\"loyalty is now driven primarily by a company's interaction with its customers and how well it delivers on their wants and needs.\\" Wharton's Professor of Marketing Barbara E. Kahn has established an evolutional approach to customer experience as the third of four stages of any company in terms of its customer centricity maturity. These progressive phases are: # Product orientation: Companies just manufacture goods and offer them the best way possible. # Market orientation: Some consideration on customer needs and segmentation arises, developing different marketing mix bundles for each one. # Customer experience: Adding to the other two factors some recognition of the importance of providing an emotionally positive experience to customers. # Authenticity: This is the top maturity stage of companies. Products and service emerge from real soul of brand and connect naturally and on long term sustainable basis with clients and other stakeholders. In today's competitive climate, more than just low prices and innovative products are required to survive in retail business. Customer experience involves every point of contact you have with a customer and the interactions with the products or service of the business. Customer experience has emerged as a vital strategy for all retail businesses that are facing competition. According to Holbrook & Hirschman studies(1982) customer experience can be defined as a whole event that a customer comes into contact with when interacting with a certain business. This experience often affects the emotions of the customer. The whole experience occurs when the interaction takes place through the stimulation of goods and services consumed. The type experience seen through a marketing perspective is put forward by Pine & Gilmore (1999) which they state that an experience can be unique which may mean different individuals will not have the same level experience that may not be memorable to the person therefore it won't be remembered over a period of time. Certain types of experiences may involve different aspects of the individual person such as emotional, physical, intellectual or even spiritual. Customer experience is the stimulation a company creates for the senses of the consumers, this means that the companies and that particular brand can control the stimuli that they have given to the consumers senses which the companies can then control the consumers reaction resulting from the stimulation process, giving more acquisition of the customer experience as expected by company. Kotler et al. 2013, (p. 283) say that customer experience is about, \\"Adding value for customers buying products and services through customer participation and connection, by managing all aspects of the encounter\\". The encounter includes touchpoints. Businesses can create and modify touchpoints so that they are suited to their consumers which changes/enhances the customers' experience. Creating an experience for the customer can lead to greater brand loyalty and brand recognition in the form of logos, colour, smell, touch, taste, etc.Kotler, P., Burton, S., Deans, K., Brown, L., & Armstrong, G.

Retrieved March 29, 2016, from http://www.warc.com Development There are many elements in the shopping experience associated with a customer's experience. Customer service, a brand's ethical ideals and the shopping environment are examples of factors that effect a customer's experience. Understanding and effectively developing a positive customer experience has become a staple within businesses and brands to combat growing competition (Andajani, 2015). Many consumers are well informed, they are able to easily compare two similar products or services together. Therefore, consumers are looking for experiences that can fulfil their intentions(Ali, 2015). A brand that can provide this gains a competitive advantage over their competition. A study by Ali (2015) found that developing a positive behavioural culture created a greater competitive advantage in the long term. He looked at the customer experience at resort hotels and discovered that providing the best hotel service was not sufficient. To optimise a customer's experience, management must also consider peace of mind and relaxation, recognition and escapism, involvement, and hedonics. The overall customer experience must be considered. The development of a positive customer experience is important as it increases the chances of a customer to make continued purchases and develops brand loyalty (Kim & Yu, 2016). Brand loyalty can turn customers into advocates, resulting in a long term relationship between both parties (Ren, Wang & Lin, 2016). This promotes word-of-mouth and turns the customer into a touchpoint for the brand. Potential customers can develop opinions through another's experiences. Males and females both respond differently to brands and therefore, will experience the same brand differently. Males respond effectively to relational, behavioural and cognitive experiences whereas females respond greater to behavioural, cognitive and effective experiences in relation to branded apps. If female consumers are the target market, an app advert focused on the emotion of the product will provide an effective customer experience (Kim & Yu, 2016). Today, retail stores tend to exist in shopping areas such as malls or shopping districts. Very few operate in areas alone (Tynan, McKechnie & Hartly, 2014). Customer experience is not limited to the purchase alone. It includes all activities that may influence a customer's experience with a brand (Andajani, 2015). Therefore, a shopping centre's reputation that a store is located in will effect a brands customer experience. This is an example of the shopping environment effecting a customer's experience. A study by Hart, Stachow and Cadogan (2013) found that a consumer's opinion of a town centre can affect the opinion of the retail stores operating within both negatively and positively. They shared an example of a town centre's management team developing synergy between the surrounding location and the retail stores. A location bound with historical richness could provide an opportunity for the town centre and local businesses to connect at deeper level with their customers. They suggested that town centre management and retail outlets should work cooperatively to develop an effective customer experience. This will result in all stores benefiting from customer retention and loyalty. Another effective way to develop a positive customer experience is by actively engaging a customer with an activity. Human and physical components of an experience are very important (Ren, Wang & Lin, 201 6). Customers are able to recall active, hands-on experiences much more effectively and accurately than passive activities. Participants within a study were able to recount previous luxury driving experiences due to its high involvement. However, this can also have a negative effect on the customer's experience. Just as active, hands-on experiences can greatly develop value creation, it can also greatly facilitate value destruction (Tynan, McKechnie & Hartly, 2014). This is related to a customer's satisfaction of their experience. By understanding what causes satisfaction or dissatisfaction of a customer's experience, management can appropriately implement changes within their approach (Ren, Wang & Lin, 2016). A study on the customer experience in budget hotels revealed interesting results. Customer satisfaction was largely influenced by tangible and sensory dimensions. This included cleanliness, shower comfortability and room temperature, just to name a few. As budget hotels are cheap, customers expected the basic elements to be satisfactory and the luxury elements to be non-existent. If these dimensions did not reach an appropriate standard, satisfaction would decline, resulting in a negative experience (Ren, Wang & Lin, 20 16). Management Customer experience management (CEM or CXM) is the process that companies use to oversee and track all interactions with a customer during their relationship. This involves the strategy of building around the needs of individual customers. According to Jeananne Rae, companies are realizing that \\"building great consumer experiences is a complex enterprise, involving strategy, integration of technology, orchestrating business models, brand management and CEO commitment.\\" According to Bernd Schmitt, \\"the term 'Customer Experience Management' represents the discipline, methodology and/or process used to comprehensively manage a customer's cross- channel exposure, interaction and transaction with a company, product, brand or service.\\" Harvard Business Review blogger Adam Richardson says that a company must define and understand all dimensions of the customer experience in order to have long-term success. Richardson, A. (2010, 10 28). Understanding the customer experience. Retrieved from Harvard Business Review Blog Network: http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2010/10/understanding_customer_experie.html Although 80% of businesses state that they offer a \\"great customer experience,\\" according to author James Allen, this contrasts with the 8% of customers expressing satisfaction with their experience. Allen asserts that for companies to meet the demands of providing an exceptional customer experience, they must be able to execute the \\"Three Ds\\": # designing the correct incentive for the correctly identified consumer, offered in an enticing environment # delivery: a company's ability to focus the entire team across various functions to deliver the proposed experience # development ultimately determines a company's success, with an emphasis on developing consistency in executionAllen, James, R., Frederick F, H., & Barney. (2005, 11 07). The Three \\"D\\"'s of Customer Service. Retrieved from Harvard Business School: http://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/5075.html CEM has been recognized as the future of the customer service and sales industry. Companies are using this approach to anticipate customer needs and adopt the mindset of the customer. CEM depicts a business strategy designed to manage the customer experience and gives benefits to both retailers and customers. CEM can be monitored through surveys, targeted studies, observational studies, or \\"voice of customer\\" research. It captures the instant response of the customer to its encounters with the brand or company. Customer surveys, customer contact data, internal operations process and quality data, and employee input are all sources of \\"voice of customer\\" data that can be used to quantify the cost of inaction on customer experience issues. The aim of CEM is to optimize the customer experience through gaining the loyalty of the current customers in a multi- channel environment and ensure they are completely satisfied. Its also to create advocates of their current customers with potential customers as a word of mouth form of marketing. However, common efforts at improving CEM can have the opposite effect. Utilizing surroundings includes using visuals, displays and interactivity to connect with customers and create an experience (Kotler, et al. 2013, p. 283). CEM can be related to customer journey mapping, a concept pioneered by Ron Zemke and Chip Bell. Customer journey mapping is a design tool used to track customers' movements through different touchpoints with the business in question. It maps out the first encounters people may have with the brand and shows the different route people can take through the different channels or marketing (e.g. online, television, magazine, newspaper). Integrated marketing communications (IMC) is also being used to manage the customer experience; IMC is about sending a consistent message amongst all platforms; these platforms include: Advertising, personal selling, public relations, direct marketing, and sales promotion (Kotler et al. 2013, p. 495).Service Design Tools. (n.d.). Customer Journey Map. Retrieved March 29, 2016, from www.servicedesigntools.org/tools/8West Virginia University. (2015). Integrated Marketing Communications. Retrieved March 29, 2016, from http://imc.wvu.edu/about/what_is_imc CEM holds great importance in terms of research and showing that academia is not as applicable and usable as the practice behind it. Typically, to make the best use of CEM and ensure its accuracy, the customer journey must be viewed from the actual perspective of customers, not the business or organization. It needs to be noted that there isn't a specific set of rules or steps to follow as companies (in their various industries) will have different strategies. Therefore, development into the conceptual and theoretical aspects are needed, based from customers‚Äô perspective on the brand experience. This can be seen through different scholarly research. The reasoning behind the interest in CEM increasing so significantly is because businesses are looking for competitive differentiation. Businesses want to be more profitable and see this as a means to do so. Hence why businesses want to offer a better experience to their customers and want to manage this process efficiently. In order to gain success as a business customers need to be understood. In order to fully utilise the models used in practice, academic research that is conducted can assist the practical aspect. This along with recognising past customer experiences can help manage future experiences. A good indicator of customer satisfaction is the Net Promoter Score (NPS). This indicates out of a score of ten if a customer would recommend a business to other people. With scores of nine and ten these people are called protractors and will recommend other to the given product but on the other end of the spectrum are detractors, those who give the score zero to six. Subtracting the detractors from the protractors gives the calculation of advocacy. Those businesses with higher scores are likely to be more successful and give a better customer experience. Not all aspects of CEM can be controlled by the business (e.g. other people and the influence they have). Besides, there is not much substantial information to support CEM claims in terms of academic research. =Managing the communication= The classical linear communication model includes having one sender or source sending out a message that goes through the media (television, magazines) then to the receiver. The classical linear model is a form of mass marketing which targets a large number of people where only a few may be customers; this is a form non-personal communication (Dahlen, et al. 2010, p. 39). The adjusted model shows the source sending a message either to the media or directly to an opinion leader/s and/or opinion former (Model, actress, credible source, trusted figure in society, YouTuber/reviewer), which send a decoded message to the receiver (Dahlen et al. 2010, p. 39). The adjusted model is a form of interpersonal communication where feedback is almost instantaneous with receiving the message. The adjusted model means that there are many more platforms of marketing with the use of social media, which connects people with more touchpoints. Marketers use digital experience to enhance the customer experience (Dahlen et al. 2010, p. 40). Enhancing digital experiences influences changes to the CEM, the customer journey map and IMC. The adjusted model allows marketers to communicate a message designed specifically for the 'followers' of the particular opinion leader or opinion former, sending a personalised message and creating a digital experience.Dahlen, M., Lange, F., & Smith, T. (2010). Marketing communications: A brand narrative approach. West Sussex, uk: John Wiley & Sons. =Persuasion techniques= Persuasion techniques are used when trying to send a message in order for an experience to take place. Marcom Projects (2007) came up with five mind shapers to show how humans view things. The five mind shapers of persuasion include: #Frames ‚Äì only showing what they want you to see (a paid ad post) #Setting and context ‚Äì the surrounding objects of items for sale #Filters ‚Äì previous beliefs that shape thoughts after an interaction #Social influence ‚Äì how behaviours of others impact us #Belief (placebo effect) ‚Äì the expectation Mind shapers can be seen through the use of the adjusted communication model, it allows the source/sender to create a perception for the receiver (Dahlen, Lange, & Smith, 2010, p. 39). Mind shapers can take two routes for persuasion: #Central route, this route requires a thought process to occur, the content of the message is important. People think thoroughly about their reaction/reply. This can be seen in the purchase of homes, Internet providers, insurance companies. #Peripheral route, does not require very much thought, the brain makes the connection. Marketers use recognisable cues like logos, colours and sounds. This type of marketing is used when the decision is about something simple like choosing a drink, food (Petty & Cacioppo, 1981). Marketers can use human thought processes and target these to create greater experiences, they can do so by either maker the process more simple and creating interactive steps to help the process (Campbell & Kirmani, 2000).Marcom Projects. (2007). Persuasion in everyday life [Video file]. Retrieved from https://aut.kanopystreaming.com/video/persuasion-everyday-life  Customer relationship management  According to Das (2007), customer relationship management (CRM) is the \\"establishment, development, maintenance and optimization of long-term mutually valuable relationships between consumers and organizations\\". The official definition of CRM by the Customer Relationship Management Research Center is \\"a strategy used to learn more about the customers need and behaviours in order to develop stronger relationships with them\\". The purpose of this strategy is to change the approach to customers and improving the experience for the consumer by making the supplier more aware of their buying habits and frequencies. The D4 Company Analysis is an audit tool that considers the four aspects of strategy, people, technology and processes in the design of a CRM strategy. The analysis includes four main steps. # \\"Define the existing customer relationship management processes within the company. # Determine the perceptions of how the company manages their customer relationships, both internally and externally. # Design the ideal customer relationship management solutions relative to the company or industry. # Deliver a strategy for the implementation of the recommendations based on the findings\\". Digital customer journey In the classical marketing model, marketing is deemed to a funnel: at the beginning of the process (in the \\"awareness\\" stage) there are many branches competing for the attention of the customer, and this number is reduced through the different purchasing stages. Marketing is an action of \\"pushing\\" the brand through few touch points (for example through TV ads). Since the rise of the World Wide Web and smartphone applications, there are many more touch points from new content serving platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube etc.), individual online presences (such as websites, forums, blogs, etc.) and dedicated smartphone applications. As a result, this process has become a type of \\"journey\\": # The number of brands does not decrease during the process of evaluating and purchasing a product. # Brands not taken into account in the \\"awareness\\" stage may be added during the evaluation or even purchase stage # Following the post-purchase stage, there is a return to the first step in the process, thus feeding the brand awareness. In relation to customers and the channels which are associated with sales, these are multichannel in nature. Due to the growth and importance of social media and digital advancement, these aspects need to be understood by businesses to be successful in this era of customer journeys. With tools such as Facebook and Twitter having such prominence, there is a constant stream of data that needs to be analysed to understand this journey. Business flexibility and responsiveness is vital in the ever-changing digital customer environment, as customers are constantly connected to businesses and their products. Customers are now instant product experts due to various digital outlets and form their own opinions on how and where to consume products and services. Businesses use customer values and create a plan to gain a competitive advantage. Businesses use the knowledge of customers to guide the customer journey to their products and services. Due to the shift in customer experience, in 2014 Wolny & Charoensuksai highlight three behaviours that show how decisions can be made in this digital journey. The Zero Moment of truth is the first interaction a customer has in connection with a service or product. This moment affects the consumer's choice to explore a product further or not at all. These moments can occur on any digital device. Showrooming highlights how a consumer will view a product in a physical store but then decide to exit the store empty handed and buy online instead. This consumer decision may be due to the ability to compare multiple prices online. On the opposing end of the spectrum is webrooming. Consumers will research about a product online in regards to quality and price but then decide to purchase in store. These three channels need to be understood by businesses because customers expect businesses to be readily available to cater to their specific customer needs and purchasing behaviours. Customer journey mapping The customer journey mapping approach for service design was first introduced by OxfordSM (at the time called Oxford Corporate Consultants) in 1998, in support of Eurostar to establish and implement their corporate mission and brand proposition. OxfordSM went on to use the approach widely, including with the UK Government, through which the guidance on the technique was publicly published. It has subsequently become one of the most widely used tools for service design and have been utilized as a tool for visualizing intangible services.Brown, T. Change By Design June 30, 2016Expanded Customer Journey Map: Interaction Mapping Framework Based on Scenario June 30, 2016 A customer journey map shows the story of the customer's experience. It not only identifies key interactions that the customer has with the organization, but it also brings user's feelings, motivations and questions for each of the touchpoints. Finally, a customer journey map has the objective of teaching organizations more about their customers. To map a customer journey is important to consider the company's customers (buyer persona), the customer journey's time frame, channels (telephone, email, in-app messages, social media, forums, recommendations), first actions (problem acknowledgement) and last actions (recommendations or subscription renewal, f.i.). Customer Journey Maps are good storytelling conduits ‚Äì they communicate to the brand the journey, along with the emotional quotient, that customer experiences at every stage of the buyer journey. Customer journey maps take into account people's mental models (how things should behave), the flow of interactions and possible touch points. They may combine user profiles, scenarios, and user flows; and reflect the thought patterns, processes, considerations, paths, and experiences that people go through in their daily lives.Customer Journey ‚Äì a method to investigate user experience June 30, 2016 = Benefits = Mapping the customer journey helps organisations understand how prospects and customers use the various channels and touchpoints, how the organisation's is perceived and how the organisation would like its customers and prospects' experiences to be. By understanding the latter, it is possible to design an optimal experience that meets the expectations of major customer groups, achieves competitive advantage and supports attainment of desired customer experience objectives.  Retail environment  Retail environment factors include social features, design, and ambience. This can result in enhanced pleasure while shopping, thus positive customer experience and more likely chances of the customer revisiting the store in the future. The same retail environment may produce varied outcomes and emotions, depending on what the consumer is looking for. For example, a crowded retail environment may be exciting for a consumer seeking entertainment, but create an impression of inattentive customer service and frustration to a consumer who may need help looking for a specific product to meet an immediate need. Environmental stimuli such as lighting and music, can influence a consumer's decision to stay longer in the store, therefore increasing the chances of purchasing. For example, a retail store may have dim lights and soothing music which may lead a consumer to experience the store as relaxing and calming. Today's consumers are consistently connected through the development of technological innovation in the retail environment. This has led to the increased use of digital-led experiences in their purchase journey both in-store and online that inspire and influence the sales process. For example, Rebecca Minkoff has installed smart mirrors in their fitting rooms that allows the customers to browse for products that may complement what they are trying on. These mirrors also hold an extra feature, a self-checkout system where the customer places the item on an RFID-powered table, this the sends the products to an iPad that is then used to checkout. External and internal variables in a retail environment can also affect a consumer's decision to visit the store. External variables include window displays such as posters and signage, or product exposure that can be seen by the consumer from outside of the store. Internal variables include flooring, decoration and design. These attributes of a retail environment can either encourage or discourage a consumer from approaching the store. Sales experience Sales experience is a subset of the customer experience. Whereas customer experience encompasses the sum of all interactions between an organization and a customer over the entire relationship, sales experience is focused exclusively on the interactions that take place during the sales process and up to the point that a customer decides to buy. Customer experience tends to be owned by the Marketing function B-to-B CMOs: It's Time to Own the Customer Experience, Sheryl Pattek. September 02, 2015. AdAge. \\"43% of CMOs told us that they owned customer experience in their organization\\" within an organization and therefore has little control or focus on what happens before a customer decides to buy. Sales experience is concerned with the buyer journey up to and including the point that the buyer makes a purchase decision. Sales is a very important touch-point for overall customer experience as this is where the most human interaction takes place.

The division has been involved in combating terrorists in Southern Mindanao. History =World War II= 1st Philippine Division Emblem 1941‚Äì42 (probably as early as 1936) 1st Regular Division, Philippine Army during the Japanese Invasion The establishment of the 1st Regular Division, Philippine Army was on May 5, 1936 to April 9, 1942 and stationed at Camp Murphy (now Camp Aguinaldo) in Quezon City, Rizal (now Metro Manila). The unit engaged in military operations in the Battle of Bataan from January 1, ‚Äì 9 April 09, 1942 supporting the USAFFE military forces led by General Douglas MacArthur against the Imperial Japanese troops led by General Masaharu Homma. When the Battle of Bataan began in January 1942, the local troops of the PCA 1st Regular Division led by Brigadier General Mateo C. Capinpin (1938‚Äì1941) and Brigadier General Fidel V. Segundo (1941‚Äì1942) was sent to Bataan to augment the USAFFE forces against the Japanese. The battle lasted until April 1942. Before the fall of Bataan, Filipino troops and officers of the 1st Regular Division fought side by side with the USAFFE in Bataan, attacking Japanese troops along the Layac Line, Porac-Guagua Line, Abucay-Mauban Line, Battle of Trail 2, the Battle of the Pockets and the Battle of the Points before the invasion at Mount Samat on April 3, 1942. After the Battle of Bataan on 9 April 1942, the local forces under the PCA 1st Regular Division surrendered to the Japanese Imperial troops. The now infamous Death March commenced the following day with more than 78,000 Filipino and American POWs from Mariveles, Bataan to San Fernando, Pampanga and by train to Camp O'Donnell in Capas, Tarlac. After the Fall of Bataan on 1942 by the surrendering troopers of the 1st Regular Division by the Japanese hands in Bataan. The 1st Infantry (TABAK) Division traces its beginning from the first regular Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army during the commonwealth period. It was activated on 18 January 1936 with Brigadier General Guillermo B. Francisco as its first Commanding General, initially it was filled up by regular troops from the Philippine Constabulary. It was strengthened in 1941 when World War II loomed in the Pacific region. =Post-World War II= The Division was formally reactivated just in time for the PA's final offensives in the Central Luzon region against the HMB on March 1, 1956. The Division's BCTs served under the United Nations Command during the Korean War, and the reconstituted division trained AFP elements which composed the PHILCAG sent to Vietnam. It also played a vital role in the anti-insurgency campaign, in the Central Luzon and Cagayan Valley in the 1960s. It was first deployed in Sulu, Basilan and Tawi-Tawi during the outbreak of the Southern Philippines Secessionist Group in 1973. At present, it continues to operate in Western Mindanao. The 1st Infantry Division, Philippine Army also known as Tabak Division, after years on various areas in the county, opened its present headquarters on 4 December 1989 at stationed in Camp Major Cesar L Sang-an in Barangay Pulacan, Labangan, Zamboanga Del Sur after its stint in Jolo, Sulu. It was redeployed in mainland Zamboanga Peninsula and Lanao Provinces (ZAMPELAN) to combat the Communist and Islamic rebel fighters and to counter terrorism in Mindanao, Basilan, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi (BASULTA) and started the ongoing Islamic and Communist insurgencies in Mindanao in Southern Philippines on 1969 to date against the Communist rebels of the New People's Army (NPA) and the Islamic rebels and bandits of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG). The Headquarters of the 1st Infantry (TABAK) Division is located on a 422.81 hectare military reservation surrounding Barangay Upper Pulacan, in Labangan, Zamboanga del Sur. This reservation was taken over by the Division from Army Reserve Command (ARESCOM) on 16 August 1987. From being rugged and mountainous, it was slowly developed into a sprawling and thriving military camp with the help of the 545th Engineer Battalion, 52nd Engineering Brigade, Philippine Army. On 4 May 1991, the Camp was named in honor of Major Cesar L.

Capinpin, the 1st Regular Division of the Philippine Army completely gave its manpower in late August to help fill in the beginning ranks of the Army's ten Reserve Divisions, which were just being mobilized and manned. From September through late November, the 1st Regular Division was, for all practical purposes, de-activated. But its few personnel who remained‚Äîand the American and Philippine area commanders who oversaw the emergency reorganizations‚Äîwere ready to implement careful plans to reassemble enough personnel to re-activate the 1st Division quickly, and then begin filling back in its ranks. When Japanese hostilities broke out on 8 Dec 1941, the 1st Regular Division was only at cadre strength (just its commissioned and senior non-commissioned officers). Within ten days, 18 Dec 1941, it was re-activated and inducted back into the force tabulations of BGen. George M. Parker's South Luzon Force. Its new commanding general, the tough and brilliant West Pointer, BGen. Fidel V. Segundo (PA), set his hand to the task of continuing to bring the Division's units back up to as full a strength possible, all the while fighting a difficult staged retreat from South Luzon into the Bataan peninsula.

It opened for passenger services on 15 March 1899 and for goods services in April. The station, originally named \\"Helmdon\\", opened with the line on 15 March 1899. From the station the line ran northwards on an embankment before crossing the valley on the nine-arch Helmdon Viaduct over the River Tove. Helmdon was the nearest station for Sulgrave Manor, which had been the home of George Washington's ancestors in the 16th and 17th centuries. In the 1920s the house was restored and opened as a museum, and in this connection the LNER renamed Helmdon station \\"Helmdon for Sulgrave\\" in 1928. British Railways closed the station to passengers on 4 March 1963 and to goods on 2 November 1964. In 1966 BR closed the line and the station was demolished.

Parallelizing row-by-row processing is much more complex than serial processing, which is another reason to make use of non-procedural SQL wherever possible. Database vendors typically handle parallel processing without requiring special handling by application developers. Parallel processing can be orders of magnitude faster than serial processing.  Constraints  In this article, the following constraints apply: * The term \\"cursor\\" includes all cursor-like behavior. For example, using a loop in a shell script that loops across single-row SQL queries or the output of multi-row SQL queries is cursor-like behavior and does not achieve the goal of true set-based processing within the database. * All set-based SQL must be ANSI SQL. A number of vendors provide some extremely powerful proprietary extensions. The goal is to avoid such extensions in favor of ANSI SQL. * The solution must be generalizable. In one or more examples below, specific values may be used for demonstration purposes, but any solution must scale to any number feasible within the power of the database software and machine resources.  Example: Insert rows based on a count in the table itself  The table below represents types of marbles. The four text columns represent four marble characteristics. Each characteristic has two values for a total of 16 types of marbles. The \\"quantity\\" column represents how many marbles of that type we have. The task is to create a second table holding one row for each marble of that type. Thus, the target table would have the four text columns, and a total of 40 + 20 + 20 + 10 + ... + 10 + 5 = 270 rows. Source table: QUANTITY TEXTURE APPEARANCE SHAPE COLOR ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----- 40 smooth shiny round blue 20 smooth shiny warped blue 20 smooth dull round blue 10 smooth dull warped blue 20 rough shiny round blue 10 rough shiny warped blue 10 rough dull round blue 5 rough dull warped blue 40 rough dull warped red 20 rough dull round red 20 rough shiny warped red 10 rough shiny round red 20 smooth dull warped red 10 smooth dull round red 10 smooth shiny warped red 5 smooth shiny round red Table to generate: TEXTURE APPEARANCE SHAPE COLOR ---------- ---------- ---------- ----- smooth shiny round blue -- 1 smooth shiny round blue -- 2 ... -- and so on smooth shiny round blue -- 40 smooth shiny warped blue -- 1 smooth shiny warped blue -- 2 ... -- and so on smooth shiny warped blue -- 20 ... -- and so on smooth shiny round red -- 1 smooth shiny round red -- 2 smooth shiny round red -- 3 smooth shiny round red -- 4 smooth shiny round red -- 5 = Solution in cursor form = Generating the target table with a cursor is fairly simple. declare cursor c is select * from marbles_seed; begin for r in c loop for i in 1..r.quantity loop insert into marbles values ( r.texture, r.appearance, r.shape, r.color_actual ); end loop; end loop; end; = Solution in SQL without looping = Solving the problem in SQL without looping involves a bit more code and requires a bit more creative thought than the nested loop approach of cursors.  Number table  The solution requires an intermediate table. The table has one column of type NUMBER that has the values 0 to whatever number of rows is needed. For this discussion, we'll limit it to one million rows. The code is as follows: Setup: create table numbers_seed ( n number(1) ); create table numbers ( n number(7)); insert into numbers_seed values ( 0 ); insert into numbers_seed values ( 1 ); insert into numbers_seed values ( 2 ); insert into numbers_seed values ( 3 ); insert into numbers_seed values ( 4 ); insert into numbers_seed values ( 5 ); insert into numbers_seed values ( 6 ); insert into numbers_seed values ( 7 ); insert into numbers_seed values ( 8 ); insert into numbers_seed values ( 9 ); insert into numbers select n6.n * 100000 + n5.n * 10000 + n4.n * 1000 + n3.n * 100 + n2.n * 10 + n1.n * 1 n from numbers_seed n1, numbers_seed n2, numbers_seed n3, numbers_seed n4, numbers_seed n5, numbers_seed n6 The numbers table can be created in parallel.  Solution core  Assume the marble type table above is named marbles_seed and the target table is named marbles. The code that generates the needed 270 rows is: insert into marbles (m.texture, m.appearance, m.shape, m.color_actual) select m.texture, m.appearance, m.shape, m.color_actual from marbles_seed m, numbers n where m.quantity > n.n The database can process this insert in parallel without the programmer's involvement.

He combined an encyclopaedic knowledge of Irish manuscripts and Gaelic culture in demolishing many specious theories and suppositions concerning Irish history. O'Conor was a protagonist for Catholic civil rights in eighteenth century Ireland. He worked relentlessly for the mitigation and repeal of the Penal Laws, and was a co-founder of the first Catholic Committee in 1757, along with his friend Dr. John Curry and Mr. Wyse of Waterford. In 1788 he became a member of the Royal Irish Academy. His collection of manuscripts and manuscript copies, annotated with his copious notes and comments, made up the first part of the Annals of the Four Masters (originally the property of Fearghal √ì Gadhra) that were collected at the Stowe Library, and at that time many of them were the only copies known to exist. Early life Charles O'Conor was born in 1710, in County Sligo, to a cadet branch of the land-owning family of O'Conor Don and was sent for his education to Father Walter Skelton's school in Dublin. He grew up in an environment that celebrated Gaelic culture and heritage. He began collecting and studying ancient manuscripts at an early age. His marriage brought him financial stability so that he could devote himself to his writing, but he was widowed in 1750, within a year of his father's death. When his eldest son Denis married in 1760, he gave up the residence at Bellanagare to him and moved into a small cottage that he had built on the estate. He would devote the remainder of his life to the collection and study of Irish manuscripts, to the publication of dissertations, and especially to the cause of Irish and Catholic emancipation. In the 1749 census of the Diocese of Elphin, O'Conor was listed as having 4 servants in Bellanagare and 5 couples living on his land who also worked as servants.Simms JG; War and Politics in Ireland, 1649-1730. A&C; Black (1986) p.296. Professional life O'Conor was well known in Ireland from his youth, as a civil-tongued, but adamant advocate of Gaelic culture and history, who had suffered for his adherence to the Roman Catholic faith. He was profoundly knowledgeable about Irish culture and history. Samuel Johnson in 1775. He garnered fame outside Ireland through his Dissertations on the ancient history of Ireland (1753). Like all of his works, his account was everywhere consistent with the historical record. The book was generally well received, and when Samuel Johnson was made aware of it, he was moved to write a letter to O'Conor in 1755, complimenting the book, complimenting the Irish people, and urging O'Conor to write on the topic of Celtic languages.Life of Johnson: Including Boswell's Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides and Johnson's Diary of a Journey Into North Wales, James Boswell, pp. 372‚Äì3 Malvine, dying in the arms of Fingal, by Ary Scheffer. The book was less well received in some Scottish circles, where there existed a movement to write Celtic history based upon Scottish origins. When James Macpherson published a spurious story in 1761 that he had found an ancient Gaelic (and Scottish) cycle of poems by a certain \\"Ossian\\", among the critics who rejected it as false was O'Conor, as an inclusion (Remarks on Mr. Mac Pherson's translation of Fingal and Temora) in the 1766 rewrite of his 1753 work. While the issue was laid to public rest by others (notably Samuel Johnson), the issue was laid to intellectual rest by O'Conor in 1775, with the publication of his Dissertation on the origin and antiquities of the antient Scots. That the issue occurred provided O'Conor the opportunity to establish Ireland as the source of Gaelic culture in the minds of the non-Irish general public. An Irish manuscript from the Cathach of St. Columba. O'Conor's later life was that of the respected dean of Irish historians. He continued to write as he had always done, in favour of ideas that he himself favoured and were consistent with the historical record, and against any and all ideas that were inconsistent with the historical record, including those of other Irish historians. Such was his esteemed reputation that even those whom he challenged would include his challenges in the next edition of their own books. He would continue to collect, study, and annotate Irish manuscripts, and when he died, his collection became the first part of the Annals of the Four Masters at the Stowe Library. In 1883 these were returned to the Royal Irish Academy library.RICORSO Charles O‚ÄôConor (1710‚Äì91) In 1766 he was introduced by Edmund Burke to the Revd. Thomas Leland at Trinity College Dublin, and was using its library and meeting its Provost from 1767.Essay on Burke at Trinity by Louis Cullen: His unfinished History of Ireland, that Johnson had encouraged in 1777,Life of Johnson Volume III, James Boswell, pp. 73 was destroyed on his instructions at his death.RICORSO Charles O‚ÄôConor (1710‚Äì91) In his Tour in Ireland (1780) Arthur Young mentioned his visit to O'Conor: :At Clonells, near Castlerea, lives O‚ÄôConnor, the direct descendant of Roderick O‚ÄôConnor, who was king of Connaught six or seven hundred years ago; there is a monument of him in Roscommon Church, with his sceptre, etc. I was told as a certainty that this family were here long before the coming of the Milesians. Their possessions, formerly so great, are reduced to three or four hundred pounds a year, the family having fared in the revolutions of so many ages much worse than the O‚ÄôNiels and O‚ÄôBriens. The common people pay him the greatest respect, and send him presents of cattle, etc., upon various occasions. They consider him as the prince of a people involved in one common ruin. Legacy His legacy in modern history is succinct. Though the effort was promoted by many, it was largely through his effectiveness that Ireland received the recognition that it deserved as the font of Gaelic culture and the premier disseminator of literacy in ancient times. O'Conor also strove for the presentation of Celtic Christianity as something separate from early Roman Catholicism as a means of allaying Protestant British distrust of the Catholic Irish, a perspective that has survived into modern times. O'Conor's support for the first Catholic Committees from 1758 was copied nationwide, resulting in the successful, but slow, repeal of most of the Irish penal laws in 1774-1793. An account of his life, \\"Memoirs of the life and writings of the late Charles O'Conor of Belanagare\\", was written by his grandson, Charles O'Conor. Another grandson Matthew O'Conor, also became a historian and used papers collected by his grandfather to write \\"The History of Irish Catholics from the Settlement in 1691\\".

Located near present-day city of Jordan, the village was occupied by the Wahpeton during the early nineteenth century, and likely before. Burial mounds indicate that Paleo-Indians‚Äîpossible ancestors of the Dakota‚Äîlived at the site as early as 100 CE. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999 for having local significance in the theme of archaeology. The unmarked site is preserved within the Carver Rapids unit of the Minnesota Valley State Recreation Area. Cultural history During the fur-trade era (roughly 1750‚Äì1840), the size and location of Dakota encampments like the one at Inyan Ceyaka varied according to a yearly cycle. In fall, large groups dispersed to harvest maple sugar and hunt deer. In winter, smaller family groups established camps in wooded areas. Men hunted and trapped fur-bearing animals, while women retrieved food stores they had cached during the summer. As a summer planting village, Inyan Ceyaka was occupied from late spring until early fall. It may also have been occupied in winter. The population of the village fluctuated, but Euro-American observers estimated that over three hundred Wahpeton lived there. Women planted, tended, and harvested corn at Inyan Ceyaka. Women and children gathered berries and roots. Men contributed to the food supply by hunting and fishing. Villagers also constructed bark containers, placed them underground, and used them to store excess corn. Wahpeton women built and maintained the structures of the village. Since the Dakota built their largest wooden lodges at summer planting villages, it is likely that such lodges existed at Inyan Ceyaka. Designed for summer living, they provided shade and were well ventilated. Forty meters from the lodge area was a community dump where the villagers discarded plant and animal remains, ash, and other trash. An archaeological dig at the village site revealed an iron axe, an iron tomahawk, an arrow smoother made of sandstone, and a fish spear. Twenty-nine effigy mounds are located just south of the village site, although these predate the artifacts by several centuries. Documentary and archaeological research suggests that the village included a dance area‚Äîa smooth, dry semi-circle surrounded by a low earthen embankment. The Wahpeton would have kept the interior of the circle clear for dancers to perform while spectators stood outside the embankment. Mazomani (\\"Walking Iron\\"), a spokesman of the Wahpeton in the early nineteenth century, was a well-known leader of the Medicine Lodge. His leadership of the lodge, coupled with archaeological evidence, suggests that medicine dances were held at Inyan Ceyaka during the summer. Post-contact history The first known person of European descent to visit Inyan Ceyaka was Jean-Baptiste Faribault, though he may have been preceded by trader Archibald John Campbell. Faribault worked for the North West Company and began trading for furs at the village in 1802. He married a mixed-race Dakota woman and acted as a cultural middleman. Some historians believe he spent several summers at Inyan Ceyaka. From Faribault's arrival until 1851, the village hosted fur traders. The Wahpeton exchanged furs for trade goods like beads, blankets, awls, and knives. A trading post may have been constructed just north of the village. Whether a physical post existed or not, the fur trade had a dramatic effect on the Wahpeton economy. European trade goods became a part of everyday life, presenting alternatives to traditionally manufactured items. In the 1830s, the Wahpeton leaders Wanaksante (\\"Rebounding Iron\\") and Kinyan (\\"Red Eagle\\"), along with Mazomani, met with indian agent Lawrence Taliaferro. They expressed interest in practicing more intensive agriculture at the summer village site and asked for seeds, plows, and the construction of a corn mill. In 1843 missionaries Stephen and Mary Riggs visited the village and expressed their intention to establish a mission there. The Wahpeton leaders rejected their offer, not wanting any missionaries in the vicinity. In 1851, Wahpeton leaders from Inyan Ceyaka attended the treaty negotiations at Traverse des Sioux. Mazomani's son (Mazomani II) signed the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux that ceded the land on which the village site was located. In the summer of 1853, the inhabitants of the village moved to a Dakota reservation on the Minnesota River. The Dakota War of 1862 fragmented Dakota society, and Mazomani II was killed in the fighting. Many of the Wahpeton from Inyan Ceyaka were removed from the state or traveled west. In the 1880s some Wahpeton originally from the village began returning to Minnesota.

The concept is most relevant in the United Kingdom and the United States, where historically there was a distinction drawn between pure investment banks and commercial banks. In the US, this was a result of the Glass‚ÄìSteagall Act of 1933. In both countries, however, the regulatory barrier to the combination of investment banks and commercial banks has largely been removed, and a number of universal banks have emerged in both jurisdictions. However, at least until the global financial crisis of 2008, there remained a number of large, pure investment banks. In other countries, the concept is less relevant as there is no regulatory distinction between investment banks and commercial banks. Thus, banks of a very large size tend to operate as universal banks, while smaller firms specialised as commercial banks or as investment banks. This is especially true of countries with a European Continental banking tradition. Notable examples of such universal banks include BNP Paribas, Cr√©dit Agricole and Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale of France; Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, NatWest Group and Standard Chartered of the United Kingdom; Deutsche Bank of Germany; ING Bank of the Netherlands; Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo of the United States; RBC of Canada; and Credit Suisse and UBS of Switzerland. Examples of pure investment banks generally do not exist except in America, and include the Bank of New York Mellon, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley. Universal banking and private banking often coexist, but can exist independently. The provision of many services by universal banks can lead to long-term relationships between universal banks and firms.Fohlin, C. Finance Capitalism and Germany's Rise to Industrial Power. History Following the 1907 financial crisis, the U.S. Monetary Commission wanted to understand the major financial systems of the world. A treatise by Jakob Riesser, the director of a Berlin bank, argued that the German universal banking system possessed beneficial characteristics that allowed it to efficiently provide inexpensive capital to industry and promote growth. Alexander Gerschenkron also advanced the hypothesis that universal banking was critical to Germany's industrialization. More recently, Emory University economist Caroline Fohlin has questioned the validity of the Gerschenkron hypothesis.

Although the song originally did not have a name, it gained its current alias through association with the American Indian Movement. History The origins of the song itself are uncertain, and there are various theories attributing the song to various locations across North America and various points in history. For many tribes, the origins of the song have been legendized. A popular theory is that it developed from a simple song hummed by a child at Crow Fair. This is possible, because the vocables are not particularly complex, however the claim remains largely without any basis in fact. A more likely theory is that it was developed between two early members of the American Indian Movement. Edward Benton-Banai, from the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Ojibwe Indians, co-founded the movement in 1972, and is rumoured as the songwriter. The song could have been inspired by a traditional Ojibwe honoring song, known as the Airforce Song. Severt Young Bear, an Oglala Lakota from Porcupine, South Dakota, was also involved in AIM. As the lead singer of the Porcupine Singers, he made the song popular in the early 1970s. Although he admits he did not write it, collaboration between himself and Benton-Banai could have helped the song to develop. Although Severt does give credit to Drury Cook (A Mnicoujou Lakota and a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe) for possibly making the AIM song, which at time of selecting a song, other songs were brought to AIM leaders as possible songs, Porcupine Singers performed the song for AIM leaders and the song was accepted by the Leaders at that time as the AIM Song or Anthem (Severt quoted this in his book \\"Standing in the Light\\"). It may have been written as a victory song after the AIM protest in Gordon, Nebraska regarding the murder of Raymond Yellow Thunder resulted in criminal charges and the dismissal of the Chief of PoliceNative elders recount the history of the song Nathan Phillips sang, the AIM Song Several Ktunaxa Elders (Marianne Michel, Leo Williams, Wilfred Jacobs, and Joe Skookum) were tape recorded at a powwow in 1981 at the Lower Kootenay Band at Creston British Columbia and stated that the song people are using in association with AIM and the Constitutional Express Constitution Express in 1980 which went from Vancouver to Ottawa is a Ktunaxa warrior song. Two of the Elders stated, \\"It is very important to me\\". The Ktunaxa songs are almost all melodichttp://members.firstvoices.com/cgi- bin/WebObjects/FVLAT.woa/wa/Word?title=Someone+singing%2C+song+hymn%2C+tune%2C+melody.&archive;=Ktunaxa‚ü®=en&word;=ff9eb81c21391636 and most do not include the Ktunaxa language, which is in the same style as the \\"AIM Song\\". Association with AIM The song became popular around the time of the Wounded Knee incident in 1970s South Dakota. It was sung at protests and recorded on the news, and thus gained its connotations with the American Indian Movement. Because the song is pan-tribal, it was used by members of AIM, who belonged to various tribes and spoke different languages. As such the song is used to unite people with a common cause and to develop a feeling of morale or spirituality. At an AIM convention at Cass Lake, Minnesota, they discussed whether the song should be adopted as an official AIM song. Form The song comprises non-lexical vocables (abstract sounds rather than semantic words). This involves the heavy use of vowels and semi- vowels, as consonants would bias the song towards a particular tribe (whose language uses those consonants). The song is intended as an intertribal, therefore it is deliberately not language-specific. As is characteristic of many Native American songs, the song involves vocal harmony. The men are backed up by around twice the number of women. The female vocal line becomes particularly prominent in this repeated motif: 500px The song is usually accompanied with a steady beat on a traditional man‚Äôs drum. It has also been heard with the accompaniment of a water drum, which suggests the song originated amongst the Plains tribes. Uses An intertribal powwow.The song can be heard at protests and intertribal powwows. It has become particularly popular in the north-east. At powwows, the song is used to warm up and \\"open the drum\\". This could be in the form of a private prayer before a public performance. Many recordings have been made of the song, including one by Blackfire, a Navajo punk-rock band. This song was sung by Omaha leader Nathan Phillips at an Indigenous People's March in Washington DC in a viral video incident to defuse a tense situation between a group of 200 Catholic high school boys and a group of four Black Israelites on January 18, 2019.

Early life He was in Orange, Franklin County, Massachusetts, the son of Timothy Stow and Mary (Kendall) Stow. The family removed first to Warrensburg, and in 1802 to Bolton. In 1806, he moved to Sandy Hill, New York to study law with Roswell Weston, and made the acquaintance of fellow students Silas Wright, Zebulon R. Shipherd, and Esek Cowen, who were studying with Roger Skinner. When Cowen was admitted to the bar and commenced practice, Stow continued his studies at the office of Gansevoort and Cowen in Gansevoort's Mills, Saratoga County, New York. He was admitted to the bar in 1811, and practiced with Cowen in Northumberland, before later relocating to Elizabethtown. Military service Stow served in the War of 1812 as a member of two different units of the New York Militia, a company commanded by John Calkins of Elizabethtown, and a regiment commanded by Ransom Noble of Essex. He was a corporal in the company, and a sergeant major in the regiment. Stow remained in the militia after the war, and in 1819 he was appointed Judge Advocate of the 40th Brigade; later in 1819 he was appointed adjutant of the 37th Regiment. Early career Stow was active in politics and government, first as a Federalist, then as a Democratic- Republican, and later as a Democrat. He served as a justice of the peace beginning in 1813, was Elizabethtown's Postmaster, and also served terms as Essex County Treasurer. Temperance advocate In 1808, Stow was one of the founders of the Moreau and Northumberland Temperance Society, the first such society organized in New York State. In 1834, in an address delivered before a Temperance Society in Keeseville, he was \\"the first man to advocate legislation to prohibit all traffic in intoxicating liquor, as a beverage.\\" Newspaper articles in 1858 indicated that four members of the temperance society organized in Moreau and Northumberland were still alive, including Stow, and that he had advocated for temperance throughout his career. Later career Stow later moved to Keeseville, New York, and was District Attorney of Essex County from 1838 to 1844. In 1840, he was an unsuccessful Democratic candidate for the New York State Senate. In the 1840s, he also carried out court-related assignments as commissioner in bankruptcy, master in chancery, and examiner in chancery. In 1845, Stow moved to Troy, New York, where he continued to practice law. After the resignation of Levi S. Chatfield, he was appointed New York State Attorney General by Governor Horatio Seymour on December 8, 1853, to fill the vacancy until the end of the year. Death He died in Troy on June 25, 1866. Family Stow's first wife, Charlotte, died young. In 1831, Stow married Sophia Patrick of Windsor, Vermont. His daughter Evelina Charlotte Stow (1812‚Äì1839) married Sewall Sylvester Cutting (1813‚Äì1882) in 1836, and their only son was Gardner Stow Cutting (1838‚Äì1883).

K; 2nd revised edition (November 1994), The term is derived from the Latin vitreus, meaning glassy and transparent. Devitrification in glass art Devitrification occurs in glass art during the firing process of fused glass whereby the surface of the glass develops a whitish scum, crazing, or wrinkles instead of a smooth glossy shine, as the molecules in the glass change their structure into that of crystalline solids. While this condition is normally undesired, in glass art it is possible to use devitrification as a deliberate artistic technique. Causes of devitrification, commonly referred to as \\"devit\\", can include holding a high temperature for too long, which causes the nucleation of crystals. The presence of foreign residue such as dust on the surface of the glass or inside the kiln prior to firing can provide nucleation points where crystals can propagate easily. The chemical compositions of some types of glass can make them more vulnerable to devitrification than others, for example a high lime content can be factor in inducing this condition. In general opaque glass can devit easily as crystals are present in the glass to give its opaque appearance and thus the higher the chance it might devit. Techniques for avoiding devitrification include cleaning the glass surfaces of dust or unwanted residue, and allowing rapid cooling once the piece reaches the desired temperature, until the temperature approaches the annealing temperature. Devit spray can be purchased to apply to the surfaces of the glass pieces prior to firing which is supposed to help prevent devitrification, however there is disagreement over the long term effectiveness of this solution and whether it should be used as a substitute for proper firing techniques. Once devit has occurred, there are techniques that can be attempted to fix it, with varying degrees of success. One technique is to cover the surface with a sheet of clear glass and refiring. Since devitrification can change the COE somewhat, and devitrified glass tends to be somewhat harder to melt again, there is the possibility of this technique resulting in a less stable piece, however it has also been used effectively with full-fused pieces with no apparent problems. Applying devit spray and refiring can also be effective. Alternatively, sandblasting, acid bath, or polishing with a pumice stone or rotary brush can be used to remove the unwanted surface. Devitrification in geology In a general sense, any crystallization from a magma could be considered devitrification, but the term is most commonly used for the formation of spherulites in otherwise glassy rocks such as obsidian. The process of conversion of glass material to crystallized material is known as devitrification. Spherulites are evidence of this process. Perlite is due to hydration of glass causing expansion and not necessarily devitrification. Fiber glass Devitrification can occur in fiberglass (glass wool) batting or blown-in insulation where it can result in the product becoming a powder with substantially lower thermal insulation properties.

Dow Company discovered the technology for the doron plate in May 1943 because a shortage of metal during World War II had stimulated research into non- metallic forms of body armor.Military Handbook: Survivability, Aircraft, Nonnuclear, Airframe Volume 2. The Department of Defense (1983) The doron plate could not stop direct fire from bullets but was effective at stopping relatively slow moving flak and shrapnel. The plates were named after General G. F. Doriot who was chief of the Research and Development Branch, Office of the Quartermaster General of the Army during World War II.Armored Vest Fact Sheet. Office of the Quartermaster General.

Stronger and lighter materials such as Kevlar- based body armor eventually superseded the doron plate.

Few historical records of Arthur remain, and there are doubts that he ever existed, but he achieved a mythological stature that gave rise to a growing literature about his life and deeds. One recurrent aspect of Arthurian literature was the notion that he would one day return in the role of a messiah to save his people. Origins The possibility of Arthur's return is first mentioned by William of Malmesbury in 1125: \\"But Arthur's grave is nowhere seen, whence antiquity of fables still claims that he will return.\\"O. J. Padel, \\"The Nature of Arthur\\" in Cambrian Medieval Celtic Studies 27 (1994), pp.1-31 at p.10 In the \\"Miracles of St. Mary of Laon\\" (De Miraculis Sanctae Mariae Laudensis), written by a French cleric and chronicler named H√©riman of Tournai in c. 1145, but referring to events that occurred in 1113, mention is made of the Breton and Cornish belief that Arthur still lived.Berard, C. M. \\"King Arthur and the Canons of Laon\\", in \\"Arthuriana\\" 26.3 (2016), pp. 91‚Äì119.Coe, Jon and Young, Simon, Celtic Sources for the Arthurian Legend, Llanerch, 1995, pp. 44-47. As Constance Bullock- Davies demonstrated, various non-Welsh sources indicate that this belief in Arthur's eventual messianic return was extremely widespread amongst the Britons from the 12th century onwards. How much earlier than this it existed is still debated.William of Newburgh and others mocked the Britons for this: \\"most of the Britons are thought to be so dull that even now they are said to be awaiting the coming of Arthur.\\" C. Bullock-Davies, \\"Exspectare Arthurum, Arthur and the Messianic Hope\\" in Bulletin of the Board of Celtic Studies 29 (1980‚Äì82), pp.432‚Äì40; T. Green, Concepts of Arthur (Stroud: Tempus, 2007), pp.72-5; the Englynion y Beddau reference to the absence of a grave for Arthur suggests that he was considered unkilled and unkillable, but there is no indication that he was expected to return in this poem: A. O. Jarman (ed.), Llyfr Du Caerfyrddin (University of Wales Press, 1982), p. lix. Anoeth bit bed y arthur: the stanza can be found in poem 18.133-5. . It did, in fact, remain a powerful aspect of the Arthurian legend through the medieval period and beyond. So John Lydgate in his Fall of Princes (1431‚Äì38) notes the belief that Arthur \\"shall resorte as lord and sovereyne Out of fayrye and regne in Breteyne\\" and Philip II of Spain apparently swore, at the time of his marriage to Mary I of England in 1554, that he would resign the kingdom if Arthur should return.R. S. Loomis, \\"The Legend of Arthur‚Äôs Survival\\" in R. S. Loomis (ed.) Arthurian Literature in the Middle Ages (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1959), pp.64‚Äì71 at pp.64‚Äì5 Arthur being taken to Avalon in a 1912 illustration for Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem \\"Morte d'Arthur\\" A number of locations were suggested for where Arthur would actually return from. The earliest-recorded suggestion was Avalon. In his 12th-century Historia Regum Britanniae, Geoffrey of Monmouth asserted that Arthur \\"was mortally wounded\\" at Camlann but was then carried \\"to the Isle of Avallon (insulam Auallonis) to be cured of his wounds\\", with the implication that he would at some point be cured and return therefrom made explicit in Geoffrey's later Vita Merlini.Geoffrey of Monmouth, Historia Regum Britanniae Book 11.2; Geoffrey of Monmouth, Life of Merlin: Vita Merlini ed. and trans. B. Clarke (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1973) Another tradition held that Arthur was awaiting his return beneath some mountain or hill. First referenced by Gervase of Tilbury in his Otia Imperialia (c.1211), this was maintained in British folklore into the 19th century and R.S. Loomis and others have taken it as a tale of Arthur's residence in an underground (as opposed to an overseas) Otherworld.R. S. Loomis, \\"The Legend of Arthur‚Äôs Survival\\" in R. S. Loomis (ed.) Arthurian Literature in the Middle Ages (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1959), pp.64‚Äì71 at pp.68‚Äì71 Other less common concepts include the idea that Arthur was absent leading the Wild Hunt, or that he had been turned into a crow or raven.T. Green, Concepts of Arthur (Stroud: Tempus, 2007), pp.259, 261-2; T. Green, \\"The Historicity and Historicisation of Arthur\\", fn.22 from Arthurian Resources, retrieved on 14-03-2008 Influence =Medieval politics= The influence of Arthur's legend is not confined to novels, stories and films; the legend of Arthur's messianic return has often been politically influential. On the one hand it seems to have provided a means of rallying Welsh resistance to Anglo-Norman incursions in the 12th century and later. The Anglo-Norman text Description of England recounts of the Welsh that \\"openly they go about saying,... / that in the end they will have it all; / by means of Arthur, they will have it back... / They will call it Britain again.\\"O. J. Padel, \\"The Nature of Arthur\\" in Cambrian Medieval Celtic Studies 27 (1994), pp. 1-31 at p.11; C. Bullock-Davies, \\"Exspectare Arthurum, Arthur and the Messianic Hope\\" in Bulletin of the Board of Celtic Studies 29 (1980-82), pp.432-40 It may be that such references as this reflect a Welsh belief that Arthur ought to be associated with the \\"Mab Darogan\\" (\\"Son of Prophecy\\"), a messianic figure of the Welsh prophetic tradition who would repel the enemies of the Welsh and who was often identified with heroes such as Cadwaladr, Owain Lawgoch and Owain Glynd≈µr in Welsh prophetic verse.\\"The poetry of prophecy sang of revenge against the Saxons (Saeson) and of a national deliverer who would restore Welsh fortunes. The deliverer, the Son of Prophecy, was often named after mythical or historical heroes\\". From David Rees, The Son of Prophecy [:] Henry Tudor's Road to Bosworth (1985 ; new revised edition, Rhuthin, 1997), p. 12. ; see T. Green, Concepts of Arthur (Stroud: Tempus, 2007), p.74 for the observation that the link between Arthur and the expulsion of the English is only found in post-Galfridian texts, not pre-Galfridian. However, as Oliver Padel has noted, no example of a Welsh prophetic poetry telling of Arthur's return to expel the enemies of the Welsh from Britain has survived, which some have seen as troubling and a reason for caution: we must rely on non-Welsh texts (such as the above) for the notion that this was a widespread belief amongst the Welsh from the mid-12th century onwards, along with more debatable evidence such as Henry VII's attempts to associate himself with Arthur when taking the throne, discussed below.O. J. Padel, Arthur in Medieval Welsh Literature (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 2000), pp. 61-3; see Elissa P. Henken, National Redeemer: Owain Glynd≈µr in Welsh Tradition (University of Wales Press, 1996), pp. 47-53 et passim, on Owain Lawgoch and Owain Glynd≈µr, who do appear in the prophetic poetry of the medieval period, and the use of the name \\"Owain\\" for the Mab Darogan from the late 12th century onwards. . On the other hand, the notion of Arthur's eventual return to rule a united Britain was adopted by the Plantagenet kings to justify their rule.Richard I's nephew and heir was called Arthur. N. J. Higham, King Arthur, Myth-Making and History (London: Routledge, 2002), p.232 Once King Arthur had been safely pronounced dead, in an attempt to deflate Welsh dreams of a genuine Arthurian return, the Plantagenets were then able to make ever greater use of Arthur as a political cult to support their dynasty and its ambitions. So, Richard I used his status as the inheritor of Arthur's realm to shore up foreign alliances, giving a sword reputed to be Excalibur to Tancred of Sicily.E. M. R. Ditmas, \\"The Cult of Arthurian Relics\\" in Folklore 75.1 (1964), pp.19-33 at pp.26-7; N. J. Higham, King Arthur, Myth-Making and History (London: Routledge, 2002), p.232 Similarly, 'Round Tables' ‚Äì jousting and dancing in imitation of Arthur and his knights ‚Äì occurred at least eight times in England between 1242 and 1345, including one held by Edward I in 1284 to celebrate his conquest of Wales and consequent 're-unification' of Arthurian Britain.J. Vale, \\"Arthur in English Society\\" in W. R. J. Barron (ed.) The Arthur of the English (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1999), pp.185-196 at pp.186-7 The Galfridian claim that Arthur conquered Scotland was also used by Edward I to provide legitimacy to his claims of English suzerainty over that region.N. J. Higham, King Arthur, Myth-Making and History (London: Routledge, 2002), pp.232-3 =Post-medieval politics= The influence of King Arthur on the political machinations of England's kings was not confined to the medieval period: the Tudors also found it expedient to make use of Arthur. In 1485, Henry VII marched through Wales to take the English throne under the banner of the Arthurian Red Dragon, he commissioned genealogies to show his putative descent from Arthur, and named his first-born son Arthur.N. J. Higham, King Arthur, Myth-Making and History (London: Routledge, 2002), pp.234-5 Later, in the reigns of Henry VIII and Elizabeth, Arthur's career was influential once again, now in providing evidence for supposed historical rights and territories in legal cases that pursued the crown's interests.For example, D. Starkey, \\"King Arthur and King Henry\\" in Arthurian Literature XVI (1998), pp.171-96 Whilst the potential for such political usage ‚Äì wherein the reality of Geoffrey's Arthur and his wide- ranging conquests was accepted and proclaimed by English antiquarians and thus utilised by the crown ‚Äì naturally declined after the attacks on Geoffrey's Historia by Polydore Vergil and others,See J.P. Carley, \\"Polydore Vergil and John Leland on King Arthur: The Battle of the Books\\" in Interpretations 15 (1984), pp.86-100 Arthur has remained an occasionally politically potent figure through to the present era. In the 20th century, a comparison of John F. Kennedy and his White House with Arthur and Camelot, made by Kennedy's widow, helped consolidate Kennedy's posthumous reputation, with Kennedy even becoming associated with an Arthur-like messianic return in American folklore.A. Lupack and B. T. Lupack, King Arthur in America (Boydell and Brewer, 1999), pp.276-7; Z. Isola, \\"Defending the Domestic: Arthurian Tropes and the American Dream\\" in E. S. Sklar and D. L. Hoffman (edd.) King Arthur in Popular Culture (Jefferson: McFarland, 2002), pp.24-35 at p.29; B. A. Rosenberg, \\"Kennedy in Camelot: The Arthurian Legend in America\\" in Western Folklore 35.1 (1976), pp. 52-59 Modern adaptations This idea of Arthur's eventual return has proven attractive to a number of modern writers. John Masefield used the idea of Arthur sleeping under a hill as the central theme in his poem Midsummer Night (1928).J. Masefield, Midsummer Night and Other Tales in Verse (London: Heinemann, 1928); R. Barber, Arthur of Albion (London: Boydell, 1961), pp.169-76 has a good brief analysis of Masefield's work. C. S. Lewis also was inspired by this aspect of Arthur's legend in his novel That Hideous Strength (1945), in which King Arthur was said to be living in the land of Abhalljin on the planet Venus.C. S. Lewis, That Hideous Strength (London: Lane, 1945). The return of King Arthur has been especially prominent in the comics medium with examples from at least the 1940s. One of the better known uses of this motif is by Mike Barr and Brian Bolland, who have Arthur and his knights returning in the year 3000 to save the Earth from an alien invasion in the comic book series Camelot 3000 (1982‚Äì85).M. A. Torregrossa, \\"Once and Future Kings: The Return of King Arthur in the Comics,\\" in Adapting the Arthurian Legends for Children: Essays on Arthurian Juvenilia, ed. Barbara Tepa Lupack (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2004), pp. 243-262; A. Stewart, Camelot in Four Colors, retrieved 13-03-2008 Other examples include Stephen R. Lawhead's novel Avalon: The Return of King Arthur (1999), featuring a reincarnated Arthur who rises to restore the British monarchy as it is about to be abolished.Lawhead, Stephen R. Avalon: The Return of King Arthur. HarperTorch: New York, 1999. In Vinland Saga, a manga on the Viking invasion and rule of England, the character Askeladd, a Norwegian-Welsh half-blood, recounts the tale of his true king and ancestor, Lucius Artorius Castus and his glorious return from Avalon to save Britannia. Yukimura Makoto, Vinland Saga, 2005. In religion In various Neopagan and New Religious Movements King Arthurs messianic return and heavy religious aspect is focused upon. An example of this is in the religion of Semdaeism where he is believed to be the one true king and that he will return one day to rule over the world, including various gods and other deities. It can also be apparent in some sects of Wicca where king Arthur and other Arthurian figures are said to be sacred or even said to be gods.

Issued by cities and municipalities to all persons that have reached the age of majority and upon payment of a community tax, it is considered a primary form of identification in the Philippines alongside the driver's license and the passport, and is one of the closest, single documents the country has to a national system of identification. The Community Tax Certificate does not act as a residence certificate which is instead covered by the Barangay Certification/Barangay Clearance. History The history of the community tax certificate entails three incarnations dating back to Spanish colonial times. Introduced in a 19th-century reform of the tax system which followed the Revolt Against the Tribute of 1589 which scrapped the system of tribute, as well as subsequent tax reforms, the c√©dula was issued to all indios or natives between the ages of 18 and 60 upon payment of a residence tax of eight reales or its equivalent in goods, and was paid annually. This tax was later increased to fifteen reales. When the peso fuerte was introduced in 1854, the residence tax became one peso fuerte and seven reales. Residence Certificate is commonly mistaken as Community Tax Certificate. In reality, Residence Certificate is more commonly known as Brgy. Clearance. The c√©dula would play an important role in the Philippine Revolution, when Andr√©s Bonifacio and fellow members of the Katipunan tore up their c√©dulas in defiance of Spanish rule during a meeting in Balintawak (present-day Quezon City). This would be known as the Cry of Pugad Lawin and ignited the beginning of the Philippine Revolution. The residence tax, and in turn, the c√©dula, were abolished with the coming of American rule. No such tax would be imposed again until January 1, 1940, when Commonwealth Act No. 465 went into effect, mandating the imposition of a base residence tax of fifty centavos and an additional tax of one peso based on factors such as income and real estate holdings. The payment of this tax would merit the issue of a residence certificate. However, persons who are ineligible to pay the residence tax may be issued a certificate for twenty centavos. Corporations were also subject to the residence tax. Commonwealth Act No. 465 mandated that the High Commissioner and his staff, members and employees of the United States Armed Forces, visitors and consular staff were exempt from paying the residence tax, and as such are not given a residence certificate. Following Philippine independence, the same provisions were kept in effect. However, the changing socio-political climate necessitated the reform of certain provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 465. Significant amendments to the residence tax law were put into effect first in 1973, following the enactment of the Local Tax Code, with amendments on the allocation of the residence tax and on who are covered under it, as well as payment provisions. The same provisions from the Local Tax Code were later subsumed into the Local Government Code of 1991. However, following the pull- out of U.S. forces from the Philippines, community tax exemptions on United States military personnel were likewise abolished, and the residence tax and residence certificate were renamed into the current community tax and community tax certificate. Features A community tax certificate contains the following information: *Full name *Height (in centimetres) *Weight (in kilograms) *Tax identification number or TIN *Place and date of birth *Nationality *Civil status *Occupation or calling *Right-hand thumbprint *Signatures of the bearer and issuing officer Uses When used as a primary form of identification, community tax certificates are used when someone acknowledges a document before a notary public, takes an oath of office or is appointed to a government position, receives a license or permit from a government authority, pays government taxes or fees, receives money from a public fund, transacts official business (such as business registration) or receives salaries and wages. In certain instances, community tax certificates are used as a secondary form of identification, rather than a primary one. Instances where this is the case include applying for a passport. In other cases, such as voter registration and opening bank accounts, community tax certificates are not a valid form of identification. Disposition of proceeds During Spanish times, the fifteen-real residence tax was split between the national and local governments and the Roman Catholic Church. Ten reales proceeded to the national treasury, three reales to the Church and one real each to the local treasury and the diezmo predial (tithe). In the American period, the residence tax was split between the provincial and local government. One-fourth of all residence tax proceeds went to the general funds of the provinces, one-fourth to the general funds of the cities, municipalities, and municipal districts and two-fourths to the school fund of the cities, municipalities, and municipal districts. Currently, under the Local Government Code of the Philippines, revenues accrued from levying the community tax are split between city/municipal and barangay governments, with a small portion allotted to the national government to offset the cost of printing the community tax certificates. Community taxes collected by city or municipal governments proceed immediately to the city or municipal treasury, while taxes collected by barangay treasurers are allotted on a half-by-half basis, with fifty percent of the revenues allotted to the city or municipal treasury and the remaining fifty percent to the barangay treasury.

The 2007 St Helens Metropolitan Borough Council election took place on 3 May 2007 to elect members of St Helens Metropolitan Borough Council in Merseyside, England. One third of the council was up for election and the council stayed under no overall control. After the election, the composition of the council was *Labour 21 *Liberal Democrats 20 *Conservative 6 *Independent 1 Background After the last election in 2006, Labour were the largest party with 23 councillors, compared to 19 for the Liberal Democrats and 6 for the Conservatives. However following the election the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives reached an agreement to run the council together. In June 2006 2 Labour councillors, Bessie Griffin and Pat Robinson, left the party to sit as independent councillors, with Pat Robinson going on to join the Liberal Democrats early in 2007. This meant that before the 2007 election Labour had 21 seats, the Liberal Democrats had 19, the Conservatives 6, there was 1 independent and 1 seat was vacant, after the retirement of Liberal Democrat councillor Julie Jones. 17 seats were contested at the election, including 2 seats in Sutton, with both Labour and the Liberal Democrats defending 7, the Conservatives defended 2 seats, and 1 former Liberal Democrat seat was vacant. Key seats were expected before the election to be in Bold, Haydock, Town Centre and West Park wards. Candidates at the election included four from the British National Party, up from one in 2006, while a former Labour leader of the council in the 1980s, Brian Green, stood for the Community Action Party in Bold. Election result The Labour and Liberal Democrat parties both gained 2 seats from each other to leave the party balance on the council unchanged. Labour gained seats from the Liberal Democrats in Thatto Heath and West Park to leave Labour on 21 seats, with the winner in West Park, Marlene Quinn, being the sister of the Labour group leader Marie Rimmer. However the Liberal Democrats took seats in Haydock and Town Centre from Labour to leave them just one seat behind Labour with 20 councillors. Meanwhile, the Conservatives held the 2 seats they had been defending to remain with 6 seats and the only independent councillor was not defending their seat in 2007. Following the election the independent councillor Bessie Griffin joined the Liberal Democrats, which meant both the Labour and Liberal Democrat groups had 21 seats. The Liberal Democrats and Conservatives continued to run the council, after agreeing to renew their pact.

It is named for the city and commune of Clermont-Ferrand, the capital of Puy-de-D√¥me.  History  Although cattle of the Ferrandaise type had long been known in the northern part of the region of Auvergne (now part of Auvergne-Rh√¥ne-Alpes), the name \\"Ferrandaise\\" only came into use in the second half of the nineteenth century; before that, they were known as the race bigarr√©e, or roughly \\"the mottled breed\\". In the later part of the century the variability of the coat of the Ferrandaise was seen as a defect, and from 1899 the only permitted coat colour was pied red-and-white. A herdbook was established six years later, in 1905. The breed was mainly concentrated in two areas, around Clermont-Ferrand (for which it is named) and around Ambert, both in the d√©partement of Puy-de-D√¥me, but its range extended into the Loire and the Haute-Loire to the south and east, and into the Corr√®ze to the west. In the first quarter of the twentieth century the Ferrandaise numbered some 200 000 head. Numbers fell in the years following the Second World War, both because of the mechanisation of agriculture, which meant that there was decreased demand for draught cattle, and because of the official policy of reduction of the number of French minority breeds established in 1960 by Edmond Quittet, the . From around 1960 the Ferrandaise was cross-bred to some extent with Montb√©liarde and Salers cattle. By 1962 the population had fallen to 42 000, and fifteen years later, in 1977, fewer than 170 remained. In that year a breeders' association, the Association pour la Sauvegarde de la Race Bovine Ferrandaise, was formed, and with the help of the and the , a recovery project was launched. By 2001 numbers had increased to some 500 registered females, with frozen semen held from about 26 bulls. The Ferrandaise was listed by the FAO as \\"endangered- maintained\\" in 2007; in that year there were 1236 cows and about 50 bulls in 186 farms, with about 30 other bulls available for artificial insemination. In 2014 the total population was reported to be 1939.  Characteristics  The Ferrandaise is large, solid and robust. It is docile, long-lived, frugal and resistant, and calves easily. It is well adapted to rough and poor terrain, and in particular to the soil and climatic conditions of the mountains of its native area. The coat is normally red-and-white, or occasionally black-and- white. Three coat patterns are detailed in the breed standard: barr√©e, pied, with patches of white on a coloured ground; poudr√©e, white speckled with colour on the head and flanks; and bregni√©e, colour-sided. The muzzle and mucosa are pale, the horns lyre-shaped.  Use  The Ferrandaise was traditionally a triple-purpose breed, kept for its milk, for its meat, and for draught work. The milk was formerly much used in regional Auvergnois cheeses such as , Fourme d'Ambert, Fourme de Montbrison, and ‚Äì together with milk from Salers cows ‚Äì Saint-Nectaire. The Ferrandaise is now raised as a dual-purpose breed, for milk and meat. Milk production is around or per lactation, with 3.8% fat and 3.2% protein.

He was an Australian champion and Olympic medalist, who also competed for Great Britain at the 1962 World Championships. Club and state rowing Mackenzie was educated at The King's School in Sydney where he took up rowing. He matriculated in 1954. King's Herald newsletter His senior club rowing was from the Sydney Rowing Club. International representative rowing Mackenzie won a silver medal in single sculls at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne. He was reputed to have miscounted the distance, due to not realising the spacing of the buoys changed from 100 m to 50 m in the last 250 m of the race, and so stopped temporarily while still 100 metres from the finish. MacKenzie visited South Africa in 1958, and rowed on the Vaal River at Billabong, near Vereeniging. He took part in the SA Championships and won the double sculls event with his trainee, John Eden. At the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games he won a gold medal in single sculls and also set a Commonwealth Games record (7:20.1 mins), and he received a silver medal in double sculls with Mervyn Wood. He won the Diamond Challenge Sculls at Henley Royal Regatta six times, consecutively, from 1957 to 1962, and won the Silver Goblets partnering Chris Davidge in 1963, and the Double Sculls, also with Davidge, in 1959. He was also noted for his gamesmanship, including going out for practice sessions wearing a bowler hat Mackenzie took part in an event of the Henley Royal Regatta where he was way ahead of all other rowers when he stopped rowing and tried to adjust his cap. However, the reason was to give time to his opponents to catch up with him as it happened. Then he started rowing again and he easily managed to get away, be faster and end first. Although favoured to win the gold medal at the 1960 Olympic Games in Rome, he fell ill before the race and had to withdraw. After refusing to return to Australia from Europe for trials for the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games to be held in Perth, MacKenzie rowed for Great Britain at the 1st World Rowing Championships in Lucerne, finishing second to his great rival Vyacheslav Ivanov MacKenzie was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985.

As with his first novel it is a tragi- comedy with an unnamed narrator dealing with apparently simple but increasingly sinister situations. Plot introduction The narrator is spending a few weeks camping in the Lake District before setting out on a motorcycle trip to India. He agrees to help the campsite owner, Tom Parker by performing a simple chore, painting a gate. One thing inexorably leads to another and he finds himself drawn into a succession of disparate tasks, each more complex and time-consuming, and from which there appears to be no escape. Reception The Complete Review's assessment was that the story is \\"not entirely credible, but enjoyable and creepy\\", and noted that aggregated reviews from other publishers \\"enjoyed it, and some are very enthusiastic\\":. Carey Harrison in the San Francisco Chronicle commented, \\"It's not out of idle amusement that the sweetly fiendish author has named his book All Quiet on the Orient Express. This marriage of famous titles hides from view (yet points to) its dark, telling twin: Murder on the Western Front. Not since Kafka has an author lured his audience so innocently, so beguilingly, into hell.\\" Nanja Labi in Time wrote, \\"In this creepy, deadpan novel by a nominee for Britain's Booker Prize, nothing much happens‚Äîexcept that one man slowly, painlessly, surrenders his life\\". Brian Evenson compared it favourably with Mills's first novel: \\"The characters are similar, the style and tone are quite similar, and both make wry but dark commentary on the dilemma of working men. Yet one must acknowledge that the range of All Quiet on the Orient Express is larger; Mills develops the absurdity of this situation with more subtlety and precision\\".

History =2nd Regular Division, Philippine Commonwealth Army during World War II under the Japanese Invasion= 2nd Philippine Division Emblem 1941-42 (gold version) 2nd Philippine Division Emblem 1941-42 (blue version) The 2nd Regular Division, Philippine Commonwealth Army, was activated 6 January 1942, uniting the 4 existing Philippine Constabulary Regiments under one divisional command. Part of these troops were at Camp Murphy (now Camp Emilio Aguinaldo) in Quezon City and part at Fort William McKinley (now Fort Andres Bonifacio) in Taguig, Rizal (now part of Metro Manila). The Armed Forces reorganization acts passed in 1936 led to the decision to militarize Constabulary (Police) officers into organized fighting units. The Constabulary reverted to their original semi-military (\\"gendarme\\") structure in 1938. But the need for more armed Filipinos to aid in resisting the rise and possible threat of Japanese military operations in mid-1941 led to the re-establishment of formal military organization of the Constabulary forces. Therefore, the organization of four regiments finally got underway in the early Fall of 1941, and upon activation, each regiment was inducted into the tables of organization and orders of battle for the United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE). The 1st Philippine Constabulary Regiment dates from 15 Oct 1941; the 2nd Regiment from 17 Nov 1941; the 3rd Regiment from 12 Dec 1941; and the 4th Regiment from 29 Dec 1941. Most of the 1st Regiment and all of the 2nd had been guarding public utilities and other targets of potential sabotage in the Manila metro area. By 31 Dec 1941, the 3rd and newly formed 4th Regiments were on Bataan, or were en route. But after the withdrawal of American troops from Manila (to avoid a battle in the city) the 1st and 2nd Regiments also moved to Bataan. Here they were moved under the umbrella of the new 2nd Division (PC) (Philippine Constabulary) after its activation on 6 January 1942. The 2nd Division commander was BGen. (later MGen.) Guillermo B. Francisco. The 2nd Division was on Bataan from 6 Jan 1942 to the fall of the peninsula on 9 Apr 1942, aiding the Gen. Douglas MacArthur's USAFFE military forces, against the Imperial Japanese troops led by General Masaharu Homma during the Battle of Bataan in 1942. Throughout the main battle for the Bataan peninsula, from February to April 1942, Constabulary troops and officers fought side by side with other Philippine Commonwealth and American forces of the USAFFE, attacking and defending against Japanese troops. These battles include the Layac Line, Porac-Guagua Line, Abucay-Mauban Line, Battle of Trail 2, the Battle of the Pockets and the Battle of the Points, before the invasion at Mount Samat on 3 Apr 1942. On that date‚ÄîGood Friday‚ÄîMount Samat fell. On 9 April 1942, the starving defending Fil-American forces, including the 2nd Division, surrendered to the Imperial Japanese Army on Bataan. After the enemy forces organized the surrendered troops into one large group, all Filipinos and Americans began the long walk from Mariveles, Bataan to Camp O'Donnell in Capas, Tarlac. This was the start of the Bataan Death March. =2nd Infantry Division, Philippine Army during the Post-War Era= On 1 February 1970, the 2nd Infantry Brigade (Separate) was activated. Its first headquarters was in Camp Vicente Lim in Canlubang, Calamba City and later, was moved to Barangay Sampaloc, Tanay, Rizal. Camp Capinpin, the present camp, was named after Brigadier General Mateo M. Capinpin, the intrepid commander of the 21st Division, Philippine Army, USAFFE, who rose from the ranks during World War I. It is strategically situated 70 kilometers east of Manila at the foothills of the scenic Sierra Madre Mountains, at an elevation of 1,400 feet above sea level. On 19 March 1976, the 2nd Infantry Brigade was upgraded and reorganized as the 2nd Infantry Division, Philippine Army, at Camp Mateo Capinpin. Since the reorganization, twenty-five successive Commanders have already led the 2nd Infantry Division. This expansion from a brigade to a full division became necessary as brigade troops were assigned to combat the Communist rebels and local criminal element operations in Southern Luzon and beyond. These combat engagements were carried out over multiple regions and provinces, including the two regions of Calabarzon and Mimaropa, and the nine major provinces of Rizal, Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Quezon, Occidental Mindoro, Oriental Mindoro, Marinduque and Palawan. The ongoing Communist insurgencies in the Philippines began in 1969 with the Communist rebel fighters of the New People's Army (NPA), and worsened to include the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDF-P), and other local criminal elements. Battling these destructive elements, with both military and criminal aspects, hearkens back to the Constabulary roots of the 2nd Division. In August 2016, President Rodrigo Duterte pulled out the 68th and 74th Infantry Battalion from Southern Luzon and reassigned them to Basilan in order to aid against the Abu Sayyaf Group. The pullout of the 74th Infantry Battalion left the province of Marinduque without a regular military contingent, leaving only the Citizen Armed Force Geographical Unit of the 59th Infantry Battalion to secure the province. 2ID Seal The 2nd Infantry Division‚Äôs emblem inscribes the Command‚Äôs banner.

The older, original Baltimore County Courthouse (\\"Historic Courthouse\\") of 1854-1856 (and three additions that eventually formed an 'H' shape) houses many of the offices of the County government, including both the executive branch (county executive and their departments/agencies/boards/commissions, etc.) and the legislative branch (County Council). The County Courts Building (known as the \\"new\\" courthouse) lies to the west, separated by a plaza. Built in 1970-1971, it houses the civil, criminal, family and juvenile divisions of the Circuit Court of Maryland for Baltimore County, as well as the Baltimore County Sheriff's Office. The latter office protects the Courthouse and its judicial personnel, as well as having countywide law enforcement functions. Historic courthouses Maryland state historical marker placed outside the historic 1855-1856 facade of the Baltimore County Courthouse on Washington Avenue, in Towson, by the Baltimore County Historical Society, December 2009 The historic Baltimore County Courthouse is an edifice of limestone and marble, two stories in height and nine bays in length, surrounded by a modest park and square on the east (and north/south) sides; this is landscaped with a variety of flowers and shrubs and small trees, with winding paths and benches. Several small memorials and historical objects are displayed. The east original facade of 1855-1856 is of Greek Revival-styled architecture, with a portico/porte-coch√®re that has a pediment supported by fluted Doric columns. The structure is one hundred and twelve feet in length in front, by fifty-six feet in depth. A shallow A-frame roof of the main block is crowned with a centered, eight-windowed, pilastered, frame cupola bearing a domed copper roof. Originally constructed in 1854‚Äì55, at a cost then of thirty thousand dollars ($30,000), the building is one of the few H-plan buildings, public or private, remaining in the State. All of the original exterior treatments are preserved intact. The Towsontown Courthouse was begun in 1854. It replaced the earlier City/County Courthouses that had been shared since 1768 by both Baltimore Town (and later City) and the surrounding County. The first one was located in old \\"Courthouse Square\\", now in downtown. Construction began in the port town of Baltimore in 1768, a year after it was newly designated as the county seat. This had formerly been at old Joppa, a village near the mouth of the Gunpowder River at Chesapeake Bay along the mid-eastern boundaries of the County. Without the court functions, the village declined. Baltimore is located on the Northwest Branch of the Patapsco River and had been founded in 1730. This second City/County Courthouse was constructed in 1768 across the street from the old public square in downtown Baltimore. It is to the west at the northwestern corner facing East Lexington Street and North Calvert Street. For several years, it faced the empty square of the recently razed earlier colonial-era courthouse. This center city site was considered for the proposed first monument to honor George Washington, commanding General of the Continental Army in the American Revolutionary War and first President of the United States. The town lay a cornerstone for the new planned Washington column on \\"Independence Day\\", July 4, 1814, 15 years after the president's death and during the War of 1812. This was a few months before the massive military attack by British sea and land forces later that September, when they burned the Capitol in Washington, DC. Local home owners feared that the unusually tall column proposed might threaten their houses, and the proposed Washington memorial was moved north of the town to \\"Howard's Woods\\" on land donated by Col. John Eager Howard, to the west of his mansion on his estate of \\"Belvidere\\". It is now at the center of Baltimore's Washington Square. The old Courthouse Square had always been a gathering place for news, gossip and protests, along with mass meetings and assemblies of the citizenry. It became the site of a memorial for the soldiers and officers in the Battle of North Point with the British Army, which took place southeast of the city on the Patapsco Neck, as well as honoring those in the bombardment at Fort McHenry during the recent Battle of Baltimore. It was renamed as Battle Monument Square. The second courthouse was built during 1815 to 1822, and its east side faced this square. the east side of the second courthouse faced the new adjoining Across from the City/County Courthouse was the Battle Monument which replaced the previous first County and Town Courts, later known as the \\"Courthouse on Stilts\\" as the 1768 building was temporarily saved from razing when it became necessary to extend Calvert Street further north, so later in 1784, local town builder Leonard Harbaugh erected a new brick/stone foundation under the building resting on arches supporting the building and cut away ground around it enabling the street passage beneath, in the Square at the edge of the cliffs then overlooking the bend of the Jones Falls flowing south to the harbor. This first courthouse in the square, was razed around 1804-1805. It was also here on July 29, 1776, that the recently adopted Declaration of Independence proclaimed three weeks earlier by the Second Continental Congress at the old Pennsylvania State House (now renamed Independence Hall) in Philadelphia, was read to the townfolk along the Patapsco River The second courthouse of Georgian style was constructed on the southwest corner of then North Calvert and East Lexington streets, opposite the old \\"Courthouse Square\\" in which the Battle Monument was erected. The latter was designed by French architect Maximilian Godefroy, (1765-1838), to commemorate \\"Defenders' Day\\" (a city, county, and state official holiday) of the British attack on Baltimore. The \\"rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air\\" were lines of a poem, titled \\"The Defence of Fort McHenry\\", that soon appeared on printed broadsheets and handbills (from the offices of the Baltimore American) all around town and was soon published in the Baltimore Patriot. It was written by the noted poet and lawyer Francis Scott Key (1779‚Äì1843), of Frederick and Georgetown, who had witnessed the bombardment of Fort McHenry from the truce ship Minden anchored downriver on the Patapsco River (probably off Sparrows Point on the north side near the river entrance or the Royal Navy's invasion fleet's landing site at North Point). Key had been invited by officials and neighbors to try to negotiate the release of doctor William Beanes of Prince George's County, who had been captured by the British. Key's poem was set to music in a few days at a local well-known Baltimore theatre and neighboring tavern on Holliday Street. It quickly became known as the \\"Star-Spangled Banner\\" and in 1931 was designated by Congress as the National Anthem. After considerable discussion and agitation for several decades, going back as far as 1835, prompted by a fire of several arsons that year during the economic recession and panic begun with the \\"Baltimore bank riot\\" which damaged the downtown second Baltimore County/City Courthouse (then only 20 years old, at the southwest corner of North Calvert and East Lexington Streets). After more recent debates, and votes, with the adoption by statewide referendum of the new second Maryland Constitution of 1851, it contained the provisions for elevating the City of Baltimore to the status of an \\"independent city\\" on the same status of all of the other counties of the state and increasing its representation and number of votes/members in each chamber of the state legislature‚Äîin the House of Delegates and the State Senate in the General Assembly of Maryland. With the positive vote, the City of Baltimore (which had also functioned as the \\"county seat\\" of Baltimore County since 1767, an 84-year tenure) was separated and established as an \\"independent city\\" (with the status of one of the twenty-three counties of the State of Maryland) as of July 4, 1851. A subsequent series of votes and referendums by the citizens of the remaining reduced territory of new Baltimore County, voted to move the new county seat to what was then called then \\"Towsontown\\", as of February 13, 1854. Named for the Towson family of early colonial settlers, brothers William and Thomas Towson, who had moved to the area from Pennsylvania in the early 1750s. Their homestead was located near the current \\"traffic circle\\" at Joppa, York and Dulaney Valley Roads, and had begun farming at Sater's Hill, just to the northeast. Later, Thomas' son Ezekiel built a log tavern where the modern-day Towson Tavern and the old Towson Theatre building for movies (and currently Recher Theatre for rock music concerts). Ezekiel's tavern soon became a regular stopping place for travelers and farmers heading north out of the city or south with their crops towards Baltimore, beginning the small cross-roads community's place as a commercial place for doing business. Several hundred yards to the northwest at the current 617 York Road, is the wood-frame house of Solomon Schmuck (now a bridal boutique store), which is said by local historians to be Towson's oldest house. He married Catharine Towson, (1767‚Äì1834), one of hotelier Ezekiel's 12 children, (and granddaughter to Thomas), so uniting the Schmuck and Towson families. Ezekiel became an important leader in the County and in the local response to the American Revolution. Her carved tombstone, the last upright stone remaining in a small family plot, surrounded by several other unmarked relatives' graves, including the connected Shealey family, was recently surrounded in 2014 by the construction of the \\"Towson Square\\" shopping and entertainment development of four acres, costing $85 million, facing East Joppa Road. In addition, a later member of the family attained a nationally known military career who was General Nathan Towson, (1784‚Äì1854), veteran of the War of 1812, whose reputation made the small town famous in the early 19th century. The cornerstone of the new County Courthouse was laid with elaborate ceremonies and a procession, on October 19, 1854, in front of a \\"numerous assemblage\\" in what was still then known as \\"Towsontown\\". Coleman Yellott, (1821‚Äì1870), a local respected attorney delivered the official address and \\"oratory\\" for the occasion saying: > The ceremony which you had assembled to witness, has now been performed. The > Corner Stone of the building has been laid; and soon the edifice itself will > rise towards the Heavens, attracting, by the beauty of its proportions and > the simple grandeur of its walls, the admiring gaze of every traveler along > yonder highway. May it stand for ages, in sunshine and in storm, firm and > unshaken as the hill in which its foundations are planted; and may it ever > be pointed to as a temple of Justice!\\" Designed by noted local city architects of Dixon, Bilbirnie & Dixon and the famous firm of Baldwin & Pennington (composed of Ephraim Francis Baldwin (1896‚Äì1916) and Josias Pennington (1854‚Äì1929)). The building was completed in 1855 by the builder, William H. Allen, but the first session of the Court was held here on Monday, January 5, 1857 after a long battle about the land title for the site from Dr. Grafton M. Bosley who owned a large portion of the western side of the town, who had presented it to the county with a \\"right-of- way\\" to it from the Baltimore and York Turnpike, and was finally resolved from the nearby turnpike company in December 1856. On the succeeding May 15, 1857, the new courthouse and the jail (two blocks south) were declared finished and formally handed over to the county commissioners. Six years later, the building was the object of an arson attack. According to an article in The New York Times, on Saturday, August 14, 1861, the building was \\"fired by incendiary\\". The account goes on to say that the fire was contained to the records office and the rest of the building escaped damage. The building was enlarged in 1910, again in 1925, and a third time in 1958. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. County Courts Building Balto. County Courts Bldg., Bosley Avenue, Towson, Maryland (1970) The Baltimore County Courts Building is located on Bosley Avenue in Towson, Maryland. It faces the same public square as does the first, historic Baltimore County Courthouse. (The latter faces east). Sometimes referred to as the \\"New Courthouse\\" in the context of these two buildings, it was designed in the modernist style and constructed about 1970. It has white stone panels that match the older building. It houses the 17 judges of the Circuit Court of Maryland for Baltimore County, the Offices of the Baltimore County State's Attorney, juvenile and equity masters, four retired judges, and nearly 100 support personnel. Courtrooms, judges bailiffs, and staff for the District Courts of Maryland, dealing with lower-level legal matters, are located in several \\"district courthouses\\" in various sections of the County, to the east and the west.

In the case of a fault-related event it refers to the orientation of the fault plane that slipped and the slip vector and is also known as a fault-plane solution. Focal mechanisms are derived from a solution of the moment tensor for the earthquake, which itself is estimated by an analysis of observed seismic waveforms. The focal mechanism can be derived from observing the pattern of \\"first motions\\", that is, whether the first arriving P waves break up or down. This method was used before waveforms were recorded and analysed digitally and this method is still used for earthquakes too small for easy moment tensor solution. Focal mechanisms are now mainly derived using semi-automatic analysis of the recorded waveforms.Sipkin, S.A., 1994, Rapid determination of global moment-tensor solutions: Geophysical Research Letters, v. 21, p. 1667‚Äì1670. Moment tensor solutions thumb The moment tensor solution is typically displayed graphically using a so-called beachball diagram. The pattern of energy radiated during an earthquake with a single direction of motion on a single fault plane may be modelled as a double couple, which is described mathematically as a special case of a second order tensor (similar to those for stress and strain) known as the moment tensor. Earthquakes not caused by fault movement have quite different patterns of energy radiation. In the case of an underground nuclear explosion, for instance, the seismic moment tensor is isotropic and this difference allows such explosions to be easily discriminated from their seismic response. This is an important part of monitoring to discriminate between earthquakes and explosions for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. =Graphical representation (\\"beachball plot\\")= left The data for an earthquake is plotted using a lower-hemisphere stereographic projection. The azimuth and take-off angle are used to plot the position of an individual seismic record. The take-off angle is the angle from the vertical of a seismic ray as it emerges from the earthquake focus. These angles are calculated from a standard set of tables that describe the relationship between the take-off angle and the distance between the focus and the observing station. By convention, filled symbols are used to plot data from stations where the P-wave first motion recorded was up (a compressive wave), hollow symbols for down (a tensional wave), with dots for stations with arrivals too weak to get a sense of motion. If there are sufficient observations, one may draw two well-constrained orthogonal great circles that divide the compressive from the tensional observations and these are the nodal planes. Observations from stations with no clear first motion normally lie close to these planes. By convention the compressional quadrants are colour- filled and the tensional left white. The two nodal planes intersect at the N (neutral)-axis. The P and T axes are also often plotted; with the N axis these three directions respectively match the directions of the maximum, minimum and intermediate principal compressive stresses associated with the earthquake. The P-axis is plotted in the centre of the white segment, the T-axis in the centre of the colour-filled segment. USGS focal mechanism for the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake The fault plane responsible for the earthquake will be parallel to one of the nodal planes, the other being called the auxiliary plane. It is not possible to determine solely from a focal mechanism which of the nodal planes is in fact the fault plane. For this other geological or geophysical evidence is needed to remove the ambiguity. The slip vector, which is the direction of motion of one side of the fault relative to the other, lies within the fault plane, 90 deg from the N-axis. To give an example, in the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, the moment tensor solution gives two nodal planes, one dipping northeast at 6 degrees and one dipping southwest at 84 degrees. In this case the earthquake can be confidently associated with the plane dipping shallowly to the northeast, as this is the orientation of the subducting slab as defined by historical earthquake locations and plate tectonic models.

Earth and Planetary Science Letters, 263, 88‚Äì103. Fault plane solutions are useful for defining the style of faulting in seismogenic volumes at depth for which no surface expression of the fault plane exists, or where the fault trace is covered by an ocean. A most beautifully simple example of a successful test of the hypothesis of sea floor spreading was the demonstration that the sense of motion along oceanic transform faultsWilson, J.T. (1965). A new class of faults and their bearing on continental drift, Nature, 207, 343‚Äì347. is opposite to what would be expected in classical geologic interpretation of the offset oceanic ridges. This was done by constructing fault plane solutions of earthquakes in oceanic faults, which showed beach ball plots of strike slip nature (see figures), with one nodal plane parallel to the fault and the slip in the direction required by the idea of sea floor spreading from the ridges.Sykes, L.R. (1967). Mechanism of earthquakes and nature of faulting on the mid-oceanic ridges, Journal of Geophysical Research, 72, 5‚Äì27. Fault plane solutions also played the key role in the discovery that the deep earthquake zones in some subducting slabs are under compression, others are under tension.Isacks, B. & Molnar, P. (1971). Distribution of stresses in the descending lithosphere from a global survey of focal-mechanism solutions of mantle earthquakes, Reviews of Geophysics and Space Physics, 9, 103‚Äì174.Marius Vassiliou (1984). \\"Stresses in Subducting Slabs as Revealed by Earthquakes Analysed by Moment Tensor Inversion,\\" Earth Planet.

Completely surrounded by the Rif Dimashq Governorate, it consists only of the city of Damascus, the capital of Syria, and the suburb of Yarmouk Camp. The governorate's area is around 107 km2, encompassing the area of the city of Damascus and the Yarmouk Camp, while the population is around 1,711,000.  Geography  Damascus occupies a strategic location on a plateau which rises 680 m (2,230 ft) above sea level and about 80 km (50 mi) inland from the Mediterranean, sheltered by the Anti-Lebanon mountains, supplied with water by the Barada River. The Anti-Lebanon mountains which mark the border between Syria and Lebanon, bock precipitation from the Mediterranean sea, so that the region of Damascus is sometimes subject to droughts. However, in ancient times this was mitigated by the Barada River, which originates from mountain streams fed by melting snow. Damascus is surrounded by the Ghouta, an irrigated farmland where many vegetables, cereals, and fruits have been farmed since ancient times. The governorate occupies an area of 107 km2, 79 km2 of which is urban (77 in Damascus, 2 in Yarmouk Camp) while the rest is occupied by Mount Qasioun which overlooks the city.  Climate  Damascus has a cold desert climate (BWk) in K√∂ppen-Geiger system, due to the rain shadow effect of the Anti-Lebanon mountains and the prevailing ocean currents. Summers are dry and hot with less humidity. Winters are cool and somewhat rainy; snowfall is infrequent. Annual rainfall is around , occurring from October to May.

Danish film historian Morten Piil described Villaume's appeal as a combination of \\"warm mother figure, romantic heroine and innocent erotic dream girl.\\" Early life Astrid Villaume, the daughter of a pharmacist, was born 3 November 1923 in Aalestrup near Viborg, Denmark. While in her late teens, Villaume performed as an acrobat in Danish revues. She attended the drama school at the Odense Theater from 1939 to 1941, and made her debut on stage there in the play Under Krigen (English: In The War). She enjoyed success as a stage actress during the next six years, however she applied to return to the drama school at the Det Kongelige Teater (Royal Danish Theatre) in 1947. After an audition, she was accepted and attended classes another two years. When asked why she would want to attend drama school twice, Villaume said simply, \\"Because I thought I needed it.\\" Career She debuted at the Royal Danish Theatre in the role of Stine Isenkr√¶mmer in Barselsstuen and from July 1949 Villaume was permanently employed there. Over the years she performed a variety of roles including Mary Tyrone in Long Days Journey into Night, the title role in Anna Sophie Hedvig, Magdalone in Mascarade, and Linda Loman in Death of a Salesman. Villaume also enjoyed great popularity as a film actress. For her first leading role, as the beautiful baker's daughter in the 1950 film Susanne, Villaume was awarded the Bodil for Best Actress. Villaume went on to perform in 39 films as well as television and radio; one of her films, Qivitoq, was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film. She also provided the voices for the Danish language versions of Disney's Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan. Personal life Villaume married the businessman Carl Magnus von Staffeldt on 11 February 1947. Her husband died in 1959 while she was pregnant with their third child. Astrid Villaume died on 12 February 1995 at the age of 71. She was buried in the Frederiksberg Churchyard in Copenhagen.

The game was originally released for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in Japan in October 2009, and in North America and Europe in January 2010. The game was later released on the Wii U alongside its sequel, Bayonetta 2, releasing in September 2014 in Japan and worldwide the following month - the two games were later released worldwide on the Nintendo Switch in February 2018. An enhanced port for Windows was released in April 2017 with 4K support. A remastered version of Bayonetta as well as another PlatinumGames title, Vanquish, was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on February 18, 2020, as part of a compilation to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the game. Bayonetta takes place in Vigrid, a fictional city in Europe. The game stars the eponymous character, a witch who is capable of shapeshifting and using various firearms. She possesses magical attacks and she can use her hair to summon demons to dispatch her foes. The game features a rating system, which gives players a grade based on their performance, and a combat system that is similar to the Devil May Cry series. Development of the game was started in January 2007, with Hideki Kamiya being the game's director. According to Kamiya, the game was completely original, though he drew some inspirations from Scandinavian mythology and played Devil May Cry 4 for reference. The game's theme is \\"sexiness\\" and \\"partial nudity\\" and that the characters were designed to be \\"fashionable\\". Kamiya and artist Mari Shimazaki spent more than a year to create Bayonetta's design. Several demos were released for the game prior to its launch. Bayonetta was the third project released by PlatinumGames, which was founded by former Clover Studio employees. Upon release, the game received generally positive reviews. The game was praised for its combat, presentation and soundtrack, but drew criticism for its story and quick time events. Bayonetta was nominated for and won several end-of-the- year accolades, and had sold over a million units worldwide by 2010. An anime film adaptation of the game by Gonzo, titled Bayonetta: Bloody Fate, was released in Japan in November 2013. A third game, Bayonetta 3, is in development for the Switch. Gameplay alt=Screenshot of a woman with revealing attire in an outdoor setting. Above her is a dark, giant leg, composed of and attached to her hair and attacking a staff-wielding enemy to the left of her. Behind them is a fountain and various buildings. In each corner (except the bottom left) are game scores and indicators. Bayonetta is a single-player, third-person 3D action game. The player controls a witch named Bayonetta, is able to use melee and long ranged attacks and is able to select multiple weapons. By pressing a combination of buttons, they are able to use \\"Wicked Weave\\" attacks and they are also able to use \\"Torture Attacks\\" in which Bayonetta summons a variety of devices to deal strong damage to enemies. Such devices range from chainsaws to iron maidens. One ability Bayonetta has is \\"Witch Time\\", which activates when the player makes a well-timed dodge to an attack. This temporarily slows time to allow Bayonetta to inflict massive amounts of counter damage before the enemies can react. The player can double jump for extra height, perform evasive backflips, and destroy background objects and doors. Camera views can be rotated, enemy targets can be locked on, and weapons can be switched during play. With unlockable transformations, the player can make Bayonetta become a panther or one of various other living creatures to enhance her abilities. Lollipops can be used to heal her, replenish her magic, induce invincibility or increase her strength, although using these items, as well as dying, lowers the score for that chapter. By finding various component items, the player can combine them into new items. Many enemies and objects drop halos when destroyed, which the player can use to buy items, techniques and weapon upgrades. The player can use enemy weapons, either to directly attack or as props for movement. Bayonetta's strongest attacks allow her to summon parts of Madama Butterfly and other demons with her hair. During development, five difficulty modes were created: \\"Very Easy\\", \\"Easy\\", \\"Normal\\", \\"Hard\\", and \\"Non-Stop Infinite Climax\\". On Easy and Very Easy, a \\"Very Easy Automatic\\" mode is made available in which the game positions Bayonetta to perform attacks on enemies, and the player only needs to press one button to execute elaborate combos, unless they wish to perform their own choice of movements or attacks. Kamiya posted a video on the game's official website in which character designer Mari Shimazaki demonstrated the mode (which Kamiya \\"jokingly called 'Mommy Mode) in Bayonetta. He expected players to first complete the game in 10 to 12 hours, but believed that its rating system (similar to that of Viewtiful Joe, which he directed) and the pursuit of high scores provide replay value. The game has a fixed button configuration; Kamiya said that \\"there wasn't really a point to changing [it].\\" Plot =Setting and characters= Bayonetta takes place in Vigrid, a fictional city in Europe. The title character (voiced by Hellena Taylor) is a witch who shapeshifts and uses various firearms, along with magical attacks she performs with her hair by summoning demons to dispatch her foes. She awakens after a 500-year sleep and finds herself in an unfamiliar area with no memories of who or what she is. Over time, she begins to remember what caused her current predicament. 500 years before the incident that caused Bayonetta's memory loss, there were two factions preserving the balance between darkness and light in the world: the Umbra Witches, who are followers of darkness, and their counterparts, the Lumen Sages, who are followers of light. The factions shared two distinct treasures, the 'Eyes of the World' (separately named the 'Left Eye' and the 'Right Eye') which they used to oversee the just passage of time. Both factions mysteriously disappeared from Vigrid under unknown circumstances. Bayonetta has an ornate piece of jewelry which contains a small red gem, and believes this gem is the Left Eye of the World. While searching for the Right Eye, she occasionally receives flashbacks that make her remember what happened. A male character known as (voiced by Yuri Lowenthal) had met Bayonetta as a child. Other characters include Bayonetta's rival and fellow Umbra Witch (voiced by Grey DeLisle[), who wields four guns like Bayonetta; (voiced by Dave Fennoy), the owner of a bar called the Gates Of Hell where Bayonetta can buy various weapons and items; an informant named (voiced by Chick Vennera) who looks and sounds similar to actor Joe Pesci, and provides comic relief; a young girl named (voiced by Joy Jillian) whom Bayonetta meets early in the game; and the main antagonist (voiced by Grant Albrecht). The realms Bayonetta inhabits are the game's different settings, which borrow from Dante's Divine Comedy: Paradiso (heaven), which generally takes the form of a heavenly yellow or golden valley or palace and is the home of the \\"Angel\\" enemies she faces; Purgatorio (purgatory), a metarealm that functions as an \\"in between\\" for metaphysical beings and stands alongside yet outside of the plane humans exist on (all beings in and outside of Purgatorio take on a transparent, watery appearance); Inferno (hell), which is not visited in the game, but contains the infernal demons that Bayonetta summons in combat, using her hair as a conduit. =Story= Bayonetta, a witch who was revived twenty years ago from the bottom of a lake, has no memories of her past. Owning one-half of the \\"Eyes of the World,\\" Bayonetta leaves for Vigrid when the informant Enzo informs her of rumors that the other half is there. Afterward, Bayonetta confronts another Umbra Witch named Jeanne, who seemingly has ties to Bayonetta's past, and a young man named Luka, who blames Bayonetta for his father's death. Eventually, Bayonetta discovers that Jeanne is associated with the angels somehow, and fights her again. Afterwards, she meets a lost child named Cereza, who believes Bayonetta to be her mother, following her. Returning to the human world, Bayonetta continues her search for the Right Eye, journeying to an island named Isla del Sol with Luka and Cereza. There Bayonetta is confronted again by Jeanne, who explains Bayonetta was a child born from an Umbra Witch and a Lumen Sage, a forbidden union. Bayonetta defeats Jeanne, who reveals the reason Bayonetta possesses the Left Eye is because she has accepted her fate. She also reveals that Bayonetta used to be her friend, and her name is Cereza. Jeanne had sealed her away using the red gem, protecting her, to prevent the Left Eye from falling into the hands of the Lumen Sages. Jeanne then seemingly sacrifices herself to save Bayonetta, who then proceeds with Luka and Cereza to the top of the island's tower. At the top, Bayonetta meets Balder, the last of the Lumen Sages. Balder reveals he is Bayonetta's father, and plans to reunite the three universes by resurrecting Jubileus, the Creator. He also reveals that Bayonetta herself is the Left Eye, but for her to awaken it, she had to regain her memories. For that reason, he brought Cereza, who is Bayonetta as a child, from the past, to awaken her memories. Confronted by Luka, he throws him to his death, revealing he was the one behind the death of Luka's father, and further reveals that he had mind-controlled Jeanne to do his bidding. Bayonetta fights and seemingly kills Balder, and saves Luka. After returning Cereza to the past, Bayonetta returns to the present. However, her actions have caused her to awaken the Left Eye, and she collapses. Balder, who had survived the fight, transports himself and the unconscious Bayonetta towards the statue on top of the tower, beginning the resurrection of Jubileus. As the statue launches into space, Jeanne, who had survived, reappears, free from Balder's control. She ascends the launching statue on her motorcycle; reaching Bayonetta, she saves her, but Jubileus comes alive, consuming Balder. Bayonetta defeats Jubileus by summoning Queen Sheba, who punches the deity's soul into the sun. As Jubileus' physical body plummets towards Earth, Jeanne and Bayonetta destroy it. The epilogue, mirroring the start of the game, shows Jeanne and Bayonetta continuing to battle against the angels. Development Hideki Kamiya directed development of Bayonetta at PlatinumGames since January 2007,. \\"[1UP.com:] In June of this year, we trekked down to Osaka, Japan, to meet up with the latest incarnation of Hideki Kamiya's development group, PlatinumGames. ... [Hideki Kamiya]: It's been about a year and a half since we started.\\" and the game was \\"more-or-less complete\\" by October 21, 2009. The group developed for Microsoft's Xbox 360 game console, while Sega - with PlatinumGames' support - handed the task of porting the game to Sony's PlayStation 3 to Nex Entertainment. Kamiya had worked on previous games such as Devil May Cry, Viewtiful Joe, Resident Evil and its sequel, and as such, the game makes occasional references to these games, as well as other Clover Studio titles and various Sega franchises, such as a minigame inspired by Space Harrier. Though he \\"deliberately created Bayonetta from scratch\\" and has called its story \\"completely original\\", Kamiya has admitted using \\"some names from Scandinavian mythology\\" and playing \\"about half of\\" Devil May Cry 4 for research. Mari Shimazaki designed the game's characters to be \\"fashionable\\", with \\"subdued\\" features. She designed the titular character to fulfill Kamiya's request for a modern, female witch that wears glasses and wields four guns, and the two settled on her original concept for the character despite her work \\"over a year\\" on other concepts. Bayonetta emerged as a long-haired, black-clothed witch with a beehive hairdo (a modern representation of the traditional pointy hat) and glasses (which Kamiya pushed for, to \\"differentiate Bayonetta from other female characters\\" and to \\"give her a sense of mystery and intelligence\\"). Conversely, Shimazaki \\"didn't require a huge amount of effort\\" to design Bayonetta's short-haired, red-clothed rival Jeanne, who merely wears her glasses on her head above her eyes. She added plumes to Jeanne's handguns to add movement to the design, and thick makeup to Jeanne's face to \\"make [her] feel like something out of the 1960s\\". Though Shimazaki preferred Bayonetta, Jeanne turned out to be the more popular of the two witches among Kamiya and the development team. As a fan of folk music, Kamiya named Bayonetta's set of four handguns after the old English ballad \\"Scarborough Fair\\", and its individual guns Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme.. \\"1UP: What are the names of her weapons? HK: As a set, they're all Scarborough Fair. Parsley, Sage, Rosemary, Thyme...\\" Hiroshi Yamaguchi focused on composing music for the game that had a \\"nice up-tempo beat\\" and expressed femininity through female choirs, pianos, and other beautiful' instruments\\"‚Äîthough some tracks also use pure orchestra or folk instruments. Kenichiro Yoshimura transformed Shimazaki's Bayonetta design into a game model and used the digital sculpting tool ZBrush to create normal maps for its details. He worked with Shimazaki on the model's makeup, referred to foreign models with similar bodies, and said that he \\"really wanted to get Bayonetta's backside perfect\\" because he was into \\"that sort of thing...\\". The language spoken by the Angels and for all Infernal Summons is Enochian, a divine language described by John Dee and his colleague Edward Kelley. To Kamiya, the core theme of the game and its protagonist's attacks is \\"sexiness\\".. \\"So the whole, the theme of her attacks is 'sexiness.' ... I'm having fun with the team thinking, 'So what should we do with Bayonetta to make her look sexy?' And they're like, 'Oh, maybe this move might be good. This motion might be good.' So that's what we're thinking right now.\\" To fit the theme of \\"her femininity and sexuality\\", the developers made Bayonetta bleed rose petals instead of blood when hit, and used butterfly imagery as part of her moves and outfit. Her giant boot, fist, and monster attacks reveal some of her body‚Äîher hair is magically formed into clothes but must be stripped from her body to form these attacks - and when the player targets an enemy, red lips mark the enemy's chest; this led IGN to call the developing game a mix of \\"action and a great big helping of fan service\\". Promotion Penny Drake dressed as the character at E3 2009 At the 2009 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), Sega chose Penny Drake to model as Bayonetta after auditioning 100 women. (A higher quality version of the video is available on YouTube.) The company then joined men's lifestyle website Maxim.com to run a contest to find women who looked like Bayonetta. The grand prize winner, Andrea Bonaccorso, announced on November 23, 2009, received an Xbox 360, a 50-inch plasma television, and a copy of the 360 version of the game. Sega hired Japanese pop singer MiChi to perform \\"Something Missing\\", written for a Bayonetta commercial. The commercial, which has since been shown on the game's official Japanese website, touts the game as \\"\\" and features a model dressed as Bayonetta with a lollipop. In the U.S. and the UK, commercials have featured La Roux's \\"In for the Kill\\". Release and merchandise Demos of Bayonetta were released on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network in Japan on October 8, 2009, and internationally on December 3, 2009. The game was released on October 29, 2009, in Japan, and was later released in other regions in 2010: January 5 in North America, January 7 in Australia, and January 8 in Europe. An update for the PlayStation 3 version was released on January 28, allowing players to install the game on their hard drive, dramatically reducing load times. A 150-song, five-CD soundtrack for the game was scheduled for a November 4 release. Another soundtrack CD, Rodin's Selection, was created for inclusion with pre-ordered copies of the game. It comes packaged in a brown jacket styled as a menu from Rodin's bar \\"The Gates of Hell\\". Sega of Europe released an ‚àû Climax Edition of the game in the UK, France, Spain, and Australia, which included the game, the Rodin's Selection tracks packaged in a black-and-red jacket with the game logo, and an artbook. Pre-orders in Australia and \\"most European territories\\" included a replica of one of Bayonetta's \\"Scarborough Fair\\" guns. Bayonetta: Witch of Vigrid, a book with pictures of the title character and an \\"interview\\" with her, was released in Japan on October 22, 2009. By then, a Bayonetta theme had been made available for the Google Chrome browser. A song entitled \\"Reaping Beauty\\" by MC Lars and featuring Beefy, Random, Tina Root of Small Halo and SMP was included on the second re-release of Lars' album 21 Concepts (But a Hit Ain't One). The song is inspired by Bayonetta, and heavily references the title character and many of the game's aesthetic and gameplay elements. On April Fools' Day, April 1, 2017, Sega released 8-bit Bayonetta for free on Windows. While the game uses 8-bit era graphics and was simplified in gameplay, only allowing Bayonetta to jump and fire at a few enemies and considered part of the April Fools' Day pranks, players found several bits of pieces in the achievements that pointed to a countdown timer on Sega's website ending on April 11, 2017, as well as other data mining suggesting a possible port of the Bayonetta game to Windows. At the end of the timer, it was confirmed that Bayonetta was coming to Windows, supporting 4K graphics and other improvements from the original versions. A spokesperson for PlatinumGames said that they have become interested in porting more of their games to PC, though the decision to do so has been a choice of their respective publishers; Sega has been supportive of personal computer releases as of late. PlatinumGames's development efforts to port the game to the Wii U aided in the completion of the PC port. To celebrate the game's tenth anniversary, Sega announced a compilation for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The retail release includes a steelbook and Bayonetta, alongside another PlatinumGames title Vanquish, on a single disc, with support for 4K 60fps visuals for PlayStation 4 Pro and Xbox One X users. Both games can also be purchased digitally either individually or collectively at a discount price. The compilation was released on February 18, 2020. =Soundtrack= The Bayonetta Original Soundtrack was released in Japan on November 4, 2009. The album contains five discs with 150 tracks used in the game, composed by Hiroshi Yamaguchi, Masami Ueda, Rei Kondoh, Takayasu Sodeoka, Norihiko Hibino, Takahiro Izutani, Yoshitaka Suzuki, Erina Niwa, and Naoto Tanaka. It was also released on the North American iTunes Store on the same day, spanning five Volumes in total. The North American release of the soundtrack does not include any version of \\"Fly Me To The Moon\\". Helena Noguerra provided the main vocals for the theme of Bayonetta. =Bayonetta: Bloody Fate= An anime film based on the game, titled , was directed by Fuminori Kizaki and produced by Gonzo, with screenplay by Mitsutaka Hirota and character designs by Ai Yokoyama. The film was announced at Tokyo Game Show 2013 and released in ten Japanese theaters for two weeks on November 23, 2013. It was then released on Blu-ray Disc and DVD in Japan on January 24, 2014. A manga adaptation illustrated by Mizuki Sakakibara was published in two parts in Kodansha's Bessatsu Sh≈çnen Magazine on November 9, 2013 and December 9, 2013 respectively. Reception = Critical reception = Critics generally lauded the graphical presentation and the title character \\\\- Cam Shea of IGN Australia praised the developing game in March 2009 as \\"absolutely stunning- looking\\" and \\"a balls-out action game set amongst glorious European architecture\\", and called its titular witch their \\"new favourite videogame character ever\\" - they compared her to Devil May Cry protagonist Dante, commenting that she had his \\"playfulness and versatility\\", but with \\"some of the most visually inventive combat\\" they've seen. Similarly, GameSpy's Gerald Villoria praised the game in July that year as highly original to the point that it could end up like the poor-selling ≈åkami (another Kamiya-directed game) because \\"the premise, the characters, the action sequences\\" were different from anything he had ever played, and called its lead a \\"constantly moving\\", \\"remarkably multi-faceted\\" character \\"presented in an ultra-stylish way\\". The PS3 and Xbox 360 versions in general were also commented on \\\\- a few days before Bayonetta release, Japanese gaming publication Famitsu awarded the Xbox 360 version a perfect 40 out of 40. The PlayStation 3 version received a slightly lower rating, criticized for its lesser visual quality, frame rate and control problems compared to the Xbox 360 version. At the 2009 Tokyo Game Show, Daniel Feit of Wired News played both versions and felt that while the 360 version was \\"a little brighter and more colorful\\", the PS3 version's cutscenes resembled \\"watching a movie through a sepia filter\\". GameSpots video review lamented duller graphics and inconsistent frame rates for its PS3 port. 1UP's staff again played a PS3 version for 15 minutes on the weekend of August 31 that year, at PlatinumGames' \\"Feel Bayonetta\\" event. They said that it \\"was very blurry\\" compared to a 360 version displayed there, and that its frame rate \\"was all over the place\\", and as a result, it was \\"often hard to keep track of the action [in one scene]\\". Ryan Clements of IGN said that while the PS3 version was \\"still a fun game\\", it had \\"a lot of problems\\", mainly being \\"the excessive slowdown and loading\\". The gameplay and plot received general praise from critics \\\\- Matt Leone of 1UP.com said of the pre-release version of the game's PS3 port that when he discovered he could \\"hold down the final button in the string to continuously fire gunshots\\" he observed that it looked \\"incredibly cool when you kick someone and then keep your leg pointed at their face\\". Edge awarded the game a score of 10 out of 10, praising the game's combat system for both having depth and being able to be learnt easily. Edge singled out the upgrade from Normal to Hard difficulties as the point where the game transitions from \\"the great to the legendary\\", concluding that it was \\"difficult to recall another third-person actioner\\" that felt \\"so worth mastering\\". GamesRadar's Nathan Irvine also said that the game nailed \\"the epic scale of everything\\" that unfolded in front of the player and \\"manner in which it's delivered\\", believed it was better than God of War Collection, Devil May Cry 4, and Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2, and praised its \\"superb action\\" and humor. However, he said the only time its plot made sense was \\"right at the end\\", and complained about some of the game's \\"insanely frustrating\\" Quick Time Events (QTEs). (The review is for the 360 version, but GamesRadar uses the same score and text for the PS3 port .) Staff at GameSpot UK labelled the \\"Witch Time\\" mechanic a \\"cool move\\" and one of the two boss battles they fought were \\"pretty intense\\", and said that it was \\"easy to see the similarities\\" between the game and Devil May Cry. They also opined that \\"rampant violence and sexism\\" was common in the game. One comment in regards to the third person perspective was from IGN UK's Martin Robinson, who said that it was not \\"Devil May Cry, Ninja Gaiden or God of War\\" that served as the game's best point of reference but rather \\"Super Mario Galaxy\\" - he commented on how Bayonetta, like Galaxy, \\"loves to tinker with the player's sense of perspective\\". Daniel Feit found the game's commands easy to learn and perform, but criticized the camera for focusing \\"on her and the wall\\" instead of \\"the enemies cornering her\\" and felt that some of her \\"Wicked Weave\\" attacks could \\"also obscure the action\\". Clements labelled its voice work \\"a bit campy but still extremely enjoyable\\", but said the game's plot was \\"all over the place\\" and was not as well told as \\"game stories like Mass Effect and Uncharted\\". However, Gamearena felt that the gameplay would not appeal to many, commenting that Devil May Cry was seen by many to be \\"too campy and over-the-top\\" and Bayonetta made it look \\"monochrome\\". The game in general was praised by Eurogamer, who commented that the game exemplified \\"so much of what commentators claim has died in the Japanese game industry\\" and said that Bayonetta was a \\"blast of creative brilliance, both technically accomplished, strategically deep and infused with rare imagination\\". But the Associated Press review opined that the game \\"would have blown [them] away 15 years ago\\" and felt that Bayonetta did not give the player \\"anything to do except fight\\". Daan Koopman at Nintendo World Report, reviewing the Wii U version, rated the game an 8/10, stating that Bayonetta was \\"still a glorious action game\\" and that \\"time has not really changed that one bit\\". He also praised the addition of the Nintendo-themed costumes, for their humor and functions. IGN UK announced that Bayonetta was their pick for the 2010 Game of the Year (GOTY). The game was nominated for the Freedom Tower Award for Best Remake as part of the Bayonetta 1 and Bayonetta 2 Collection at the New York Game Awards. Bayonetta was one of twelve games to receive a 2009 Japan Game Awards \\"Future Division\\" award at the 2009 Tokyo Game Show. = Sales figures = Sinobi, a Japanese blog known for its early sales data, reported that Bayonetta sold 138,000 copies‚Äî93,000 for the PS3 and 45,000 for the 360‚Äîon its day of release in the country. Media Create reported the PS3 version sold 135,242 copies and was the top-selling game during its week of release there, while the 360 version sold 64,325 copies and charted at number seven. Phil Elliott of GamesIndustry.biz called the 360 version's lower sales figures \\"a very strong performance for the Microsoft platform, relative to installed base\\". The two releases fell to number eight and number 15 respectively the following week. By March 31, 2010, Bayonetta sold 1.35 million units worldwide. In a 2013 interview with Polygon, PlatinumGames' president Tatsuya Minami stated Bayonetta was their best-selling title but commented the sales did not beat their expectations. About a month after its release on Windows, Sega Europe's Vice President of Publishing John Clark said that the Windows version had sold more than 170,000 units, and that Sega was \\"really happy\\" on this performance. Sequels A sequel, Bayonetta 2, was announced in September 2012 as a Wii U title to be published by Nintendo. The game, released in Japan in September 2014 and in North America and Europe in December 2014, features a port of the original Bayonetta, which adds costumes based on Nintendo properties including Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Star Fox and Metroid, as well as touch screen controls and dual audio tracks. Another sequel, Bayonetta 3, was announced during The Game Awards 2017 in December as a Nintendo Switch title, alongside the announcement of Switch ports for the previous two games.

It is the owner of the Cardiff Arms Park site, however, it is also a major shareholder of Cardiff Rugby Football Club Ltd and therefore has a large influence over the rugby club's two sides. Cardiff Athletic Club was established in 1922, and has been the main body responsible for much of the premier amateur sporting activities in Cardiff. The Athletic Club has cricket, rugby union, field hockey, tennis and bowls sections. History 3rd Marquess of Bute. The Bute family had previously owned Cardiff Arms Park. In 1922 Cardiff Football Club, later renamed Cardiff Rugby Football Club, and Cardiff Cricket Club amalgamated to form the Cardiff Athletic Club. Before that in 1878, the two Clubs had been granted the use of Cardiff Arms Park at a peppercorn rate, by the 3rd Marquess of Bute, who owned the site at the time. The two clubs wanted to preserve their grounds, and so the cricket and rugby clubs joined forces, and created Cardiff Athletic Club. The Athletic Club purchased the site from the 4th Marquess of Bute, apart from a strip of land adjoining Westgate Street, for GB¬£30,000 on the understanding that the site should be preserved for recreational purposes only. By 1935, the 4th Marquis of Bute built a new block of flats on his land adjoining Westgate Street. There had been previous attempts to merge the clubs, in November 1892 and between 1902 and 1904, when the two clubs worked closely to fund a new pavilion to serve the needs of both clubs, but it was not until 1922 that the merger finally took place. Later the Cardiff Arms Park Company Limited was formed by Cardiff Athletic Club, Arms Park (Cardiff) Greyhound Racing Company Limited and the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU). By 1933 the Cardiff Athletic Club acquired a 99-year lease from the Cardiff Arms Park Company Limited on a rental of ¬£200 per annum. Since the 1930s, Cardiff Arms Park has changed considerably, with new facilities and amenities, but it was the building of the National Stadium which would see the greatest change for the Cardiff Athletic Club. After an agreement between Cardiff Athletic Club and the WRU, the freehold of the rugby ground was transferred solely to the WRU in July 1968. Work could then begin on the new National Stadium. Glamorgan County Cricket Club and the cricket and hockey sections of the Athletic Club moved to Sophia Gardens in 1967, and by 1995 the cricket section moved again to the Diamond Ground in Whitchurch, Cardiff., although the hockey section still play at the Sophia Gardens complex. This allowed the cricket ground to be demolished and a new rugby union stadium built on the same site for Cardiff RFC, who would move out of the old rugby ground, allowing the National Stadium to be built, for the sole use of the Wales national rugby union team. By 1999, the National Stadium had been replaced by the Millennium Stadium.  Present day  Cardiff Athletic Club has five sports sections; the rugby section (administered by Cardiff Blues Ltd, with Cardiff Athletic Club as its major shareholder), the cricket section (Cardiff Cricket Club), the (field) hockey section (Cardiff & Met Hockey Club including the Cardiff Athletic Ladies Hockey Club), the bowls section (Cardiff Athletic Bowls Club) and the tennis section (Lisvane (CAC) Tennis Club). Each section is represented on the Management Committee of the Club. The Athletic Club is one of the few multi- sport clubs in the United Kingdom. A former president of Cardiff Athletic Club was the ex-Welsh International rugby player Bleddyn Williams. It was announced on 19 September 2007, that the Cardiff Blues team were to move from Cardiff Arms Park for the 2009‚Äì2010 season, to a new stadium at Leckwith to become tenants of Cardiff City FC. The Cardiff Athletic Club management committee at the time had voted to support this. A decision by Cardiff Athletic Club on the future of Cardiff Arms Park could be made later. Cardiff Arms Park Male Choir The Arms Park has its own choir, called the Cardiff Arms Park Male Choir. It was formed in 1966 as the Cardiff Athletic Club Male Voice Choir, and today performs internationally with a schedule of concerts and tours. In 2000, the choir changed their name to become the Cardiff Arms Park Male Choir ().

Early life Cushing was born in Pawling in Dutchess County, New York in January 1812. He was the posthumous son of Milton Foster Cushing (1787‚Äì1811) and Frances \\"Fanny\\" ( Nicholas) Cushing (1788‚Äì1848) and grew up in Dover, New York. He graduated from Williams College in 1832. Career After studying law with David Woodcock, he was admitted to the bar in New York in 1835, and began practicing in Ithaca, New York. Shortly thereafter, he became law partners with former U.S. Representative Charles Humphrey, remaining so until Humphrey became clerk of the Supreme Court of New York in Albany. In 1843, he went into partnership with his brother-in-law, Benjamin G. Ferris, until he became Attorney General in 1855. =Political career= He was a Democratic member from Tompkins County of the New York State Assembly in the 75th New York State Legislature, serving from January 1 to December 31, 1852. He was New York State Attorney General from 1856 to 1857, elected on the American Party ticket. While he was Attorney General, he was the prosecutor in the trial of Emma Cunningham for the murder of Dr. Harvey Burdell, a prosperous dentist in New York City in 1857. The case is considered one of the most famous cases in the American Victorian-era. =Later career= Afterwards he removed to New York City and practiced law there in partnership with Daniel E. Sickles, a former U.S. Representative who served as the United States Minister to Spain after Cushing's death.Lawson, John Davison. American State Trials: A Collection of the Important and Interesting Criminal Trials which Have Taken Place in the United States, from the Beginning of Our Government to the Present Day, Vol. 5, Thomas Law Books, (1916); pgs, 90, 94. Sickles had gained notoriety in 1859, when he murdered his wife's lover, Philip Barton Key, son of Francis Scott Key, across the street from the White House. Personal life In 1836, he married Mary Woodcock (‚Äì1868), a daughter of Cushing's former law teacher, Democratic-Republican U.S. Representative from New York, David Woodcock. Mary's sister, Elizabeth Cornelia Woodcock, was married to Cushing's law partner, Benjamin G. Ferris. Together, Stephen and Mary were the parents of: * Ferris Cushing (1840‚Äì1869), who served in the U.S. Civil War. * Mary W. Cushing (1843‚Äì1911) * Charles Humphrey Cushing (1847‚Äì1917), who became a member of the Producers' Petroleum exchange. According to Cushing's Williams obituary, \\"there were few more popular orators in western New York, and as an after-dinner speaker he probably had no equal.

It was popularly known as the oldest bar in the city. The liquor license it amended was first issued in November 1912 (though property records show the building as being built in 1915, as a bakery) and operated nearly continuously since its opening, having been shut down briefly at times for run-ins with the law, such as when the upstairs, now a live music venue, was used as a speakeasy during Prohibition. Tobacco Road was located at 626 South Miami Avenue, on the south side of the Miami River, putting it in Miami's Brickell district, where it was classified as a classic dive bar, being popular among locals. Tobacco Road celebrated its 100th anniversary in November 2012. In 2012, the land on which Tobacco Road lies was purchased for $12.5 million. On October 26, 2014, Tobacco Road closed and was demolished by Thunder Demolition Inc. An estimated 4,000 people came on its last night. Sale and closure In April 2012, an unrelated developer, Carlos Mattos, purchased the large lot which includes Tobacco Road, though it was stated that Tobacco Road had a three-year lease and could remain open for at least that long before the lot is developed. In 2014, the owners announced that they were planning on selling the bar to its employees, regardless of whether or not demolition is imminent, and relocating to another building nearby. The bar closed on the morning of October 26 with plans to relocate to another building in the same block as well as a themed bar on a Norwegian Cruise Line ship.

Bellefonte Furnace was a hot blast iron furnace located in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania. Founded in 1888, it was the first hot blast, coke-fueled iron furnace to be built in Centre County, Pennsylvania. While its founders hoped to transform Centre County's iron industry with modern technology, the furnace struggled to operate at a profit and was out of operation from 1893 until 1899. Thereafter, it operated more or less continuously until 1910, and was demolished four years later. It should not be confused with the charcoal-fueled Bellefonte Furnace and Forge on Logan Branch, which was replaced by Valentine Furnace. Founding The Bellefonte Furnace Company was formed in April 1887 by a group of investors from Bellefonte, Hollidaysburg, and Philadelphia. Principal investors included John Reilly, railroad contractors Phil and Tom Collins, and their nephew, Tom Shoemaker. The Collins brothers had already constructed the Buffalo Run, Bellefonte and Bald Eagle Railroad from Bellefonte to Struble, opening up the iron ore deposits of the western Nittany Valley. Building a modern furnace to smelt the ore was a logical extension of their interests, since as yet all the furnaces in Centre County were charcoal-fueled cold blast furnaces. The new furnace company had ore rights at Blair Bank, near Stormstown, Red Bank, near Scotia, and Johnson Bank, near Struble, and shared rights with the McCoy & Linn iron company at Oreland, to the east of Struble. The BRB&BERR; built additional branches to reach these ore pits, extending the Red Bank Branch to Blair and Red Bank and the Oreland Branch to Oreland in 1887. Bellefonte Furnace itself was to be located on the former site of the town fairgrounds, a site on the northwest edge of town, just south of Buffalo Run. The furnace and associated buildings were built from brick and limestone quarried along the Oreland Branch. They were designed by Taws & Hartman, a Philadelphia engineering partnership that specialized in the construction of blast furnaces. The furnace complex included a stock house for storing raw materials, the furnace itself, tall, three stoves and an engine house for heating and pressurizing the hot blast, and a cast house where the molten iron could be formed into castings. The smokestack for the stoves, high, was the most prominent part of the complex. The BRB&BERR;, which ran along the north side of Buffalo Run here and had its shops immediately to the north of the furnace, laid a spur into the furnace complex, with several tracks for delivering supplies and receiving products. Ore was supplied by the furnace's own ore holdings and by other local miners and was shipped in over the BRB&BERR.; Limestone for ironmaking was quarried at a site nearby, just north of the BRB&BE; shops. Coke was obtained from the Connellsville region. With ample space on the site, slag was dumped in a heap between the furnace and Buffalo Run. When running at full capacity, the furnace could consume of limestone, of coke, and of ore per day and produce of iron. The furnace was first put into blast on January 31, 1888, in a ceremony attended by Bellefonte native and ex-governor Andrew Curtin. Two months later, Valentine Furnace, another hot blast iron furnace, had also gone into blast on the south side of Bellefonte. While Valentine Furnace was operated separately from Bellefonte Furnace, Shoemaker and the Collins brothers had engineered and built the Nittany Valley Railroad, which supplied ore to Valentine Furnace. With Bellefonte and Valentine Furnaces both in blast, the Beech Creek Railroad began to consider an extension to tap the furnace traffic from Bellefonte. However, all was not well with the iron firms. A statewide construction boom had led to a surplus of ironmaking capacity, depressing prices. Both furnaces were also suffering from a shortage of ore. The Nittany Valley hematite banks could not supply enough ore to run Bellefonte Furnace at more than 80% of capacity, a reduction in its economy of scale that made it unprofitable to run with the depression in iron prices. High freight rates discouraged buying ore from more distant local mines. On January 31, 1891, Bellefonte Furnace went out of blast for maintenance. A strike during the spring pushed up the price of coke, and the furnace remained idle. With Bellefonte Furnace cold, the BRB&BERR; lost two-thirds of its trade, and was thrown into bankruptcy in July. Reorganization The ensuing reorganization of the BRB&BERR; brought the railroad under separate management from the furnace. The bondholders did not choose to reinstate Reilly, who remained president of the furnace company. Reilly and the Collins brothers clashed with the railroad, now reorganized as the Bellefonte Central Railroad, over freight rates. The railroad would not ship ore for less than 30 cents per ton, which Phil Collins considered too high to operate the furnace profitably. Despite this dispute, Tom Shoemaker remained superintendent of both the railroad and the furnace company. The two companies were unable to come to terms until July 1892, when a meeting between Reilly and Frazer in Philadelphia persuaded the latter to grant the furnace a rate of 20 cents per ton from nearby banks and 25 cents for those further up the line. With this assurance, Reilly began to repair the furnace, rehire workers, and raise money for payroll. It went back into blast in April 1893. With the furnace starting back up, Shoemaker, who was also running a mining company at Graysdale, found himself overwhelmed with responsibilities and resigned from the railroad in May 1893 to devote his time to his other enterprises. However, shortly after his departure, the Panic of 1893 rattled American industry. In the financial shock that followed, Bellefonte Furnace once again found it impossible to make iron at a profit, and went out of blast again in July 1893. With Bellefonte Furnace out of blast and Valentine Furnace operating only sporadically, the Bellefonte Central began to remove some of the ore mine branches. The Oreland Branch had already been removed in 1892 to lay track into State College, the siding to Johnson Bank was removed in 1894, and the Red Bank Branch beyond Graysdale in 1896. The railroad considered buying the furnace, but found John Reilly's terms unsatisfactory. The Gephart era In a surprise announcement on May 5, 1899, J. Wesley Gephart, a prominent local businessman and sometime president of the Valentine Iron Company, announced that he had collected New York and Philadelphia capitalists to invest in and restart the furnace. Gephart assumed the presidency of the new Bellefonte Furnace Company, which owned the furnace and the ore leases at Mattern Bank and Red Bank. Furthermore, Gephart revealed that the company had bought the large ore deposits at Scotia from Carnegie Steel to augment the furnace's ore reserves. Gephart's Central Railroad of Pennsylvania was to build a trestle across Spring Creek to reach the plant. John Reilly was retained as vice president, and Tom Shoemaker was one of the directors. The furnace was relit on July 24, 1899, for the first time in six years. Because of the removal of the Red Bank Branch in 1896, Bellefonte Furnace initially began receiving ore via a roundabout route, shipping over the Scotia Branch and Fairbrook Branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad to Tyrone, and then north over the Bald Eagle Branch to Bellefonte. To shorten the route, the Bellefonte Central quickly laid a new Scotia Branch of from Graysdale to Scotia, where a narrow gauge line owned by the furnace company hauled ore from Red Bank to the Scotia washer. Ore from both pits was cleaned and shipped from Scotia, the first train leaving on October 31, 1899. The Bellefonte Central also rebuilt the Red Bank Branch from Graysdale to Mattern Bank, which opened August 11, 1899. Bridge over Spring Creek and the PRR on the Central Railroad's Furnace Branch. After a confrontation with the PRR's assistant superintendent for the Tyrone Division, Gephart's men began work on the Furnace Branch of the Central Railroad in May 1899. The bridge was completed and placed in service on July 17, 1899. With the new connection in place, Bellefonte Furnace could now ship pig iron either via the Bellefonte Central and the PRR or by the Central Railroad and the Beech Creek Railroad (part of the New York Central system), giving it leverage for better freight rates. It also gave the railroad easy access to a Gephart-owned lime quarry at Salona, on the Central Railroad. Ominously, however, the furnace shut down for repairs during summer 1900. As before, the effects of the shutdown rippled through the economy of Bellefonte, with workers at the ore pits and the lime quarry at Salona and railroad crews being furloughed. The furnace did, however, return to blast on schedule on September 27, 1900. Valentine, now Nittany Furnace, was also closed at the time, but Gephart and another group of investors bought this furnace as well in December. It would, however, be managed separately from Bellefonte Furnace. Gephart announced that Bellefonte Furnace would be run more steadily than Nittany, which would only be operated at peak periods. Despite Gephart's success in attracting investors, the iron markets remained weak, and Bellefonte Furnace closed down in June. Repairs were under way to bring it back into blast by September 1904. It was back in blast again by the end of October. Gephart's death the next year robbed his numerous enterprises of leadership, although it brought Bellefonte and Nittany Furnaces under a single management. They were still owned by different parties, and Bellefonte Furnace benefited somewhat from being tied to the Central Railroad of Pennsylvania. However, the Panic of 1907 proved to be the final blow for the iron industry in Bellefonte. Bellefonte Furnace went out of blast for the last time on December 21, 1910. For the time being, its most remunerative asset was its pile of furnace slag, which was used by Tom Shoemaker in the construction of a PRR railroad yard in Northumberland, Pennsylvania. In 1914, the furnace and its ore holdings were sold to the John Lowber Welsh estate, one of its bondholders. The furnace was demolished for scrap in 1915, and the ore pits were shut down and the company houses there dismantled. The Central Railroad of Pennsylvania was dealt a mortal blow by the loss of the furnace traffic. Under the presidency of Gephart's son, it struggled on for a few more years before abandonment in 1918. Legacy Bellefonte Furnace did not live up to the sanguine expectations of its original investors. Bellefonte, where iron furnaces had prospered since the 18th Century, appeared to enjoy all the advantages necessary for successful iron production: ample iron ore to be mined, limestone in abundance, easy access to coke from Connellsville and the Snow Shoe region by rail. Why, then, did the furnace struggle financially during its initial period of operation? Gephart thought the key lay in railroad rates, so he built the Central Railroad of Pennsylvania to break the PRR's monopoly on traffic from Bellefonte. Certainly Bellefonte Furnace was more successful under his leadership, shipping over the Central Railroad, then under the Collins brothers and Shoemaker, successful businessmen in other areas. However, by the end of the furnace's lifetime, other problems had become apparent. The pig iron market was already in decline by the time the furnace was built in 1888, with prices rarely rising above $22 per ton until World War I. But it was the rise of the integrated steel plant that really sealed the fate of Bellefonte's furnaces. As steel producers increasingly made their own iron and converted it to steel on site, the utility of merchant pig producers such as Bellefonte Furnace dwindled. Easily mined, high-grade Mesabi Range iron ore negated the advantage of the local deposits in the Nittany Valley; in fact, it was the availability of Mesabi ore that led Carnegie to sell the Scotia mines to Gephart. Gephart's prestige and ability to attract investors were able to keep Bellefonte and Nittany Furnace and the associated railroads and ore mines active. But this was an Indian summer of prosperity for Bellefonte. The lime industry, though increasingly important for the region, was unable to sustain the prosperity that iron had brought to Bellefonte, making it the county seat and the cradle of governors Curtin and Beaver. The closing of the iron furnaces represented but one step in the decline of Bellefonte and its replacement by State College as the principal community of Centre County.

At the end of the genocide in July 1994, Blewitt volunteered for the Ministry of Rehabilitation in Rwanda, working for eight months helping to bury the dead and to support the survivors. This formative experience inspired her to set up Survivors Fund on her return to the UK to ensure that survivors received aid, assistance and support, and that their voices would be heard by people around the world. Her work has meant that she has received numerous awards such as 'Woman of the year' and appointment as an OBE. Fields of work Survivors Fund activity is focused on the following areas: Healthcare Survivors still suffer from genocide related physical injuries, mental health illnesses and HIV and AIDS which require specialist care. Many survivors were infected with HIV and AIDS during the genocide, and still do not have access to antiretroviral treatment. There is also a need to for specialist doctors to assess the required surgery which is not available in Rwanda for those still suffering from untreated, but treatable, wounds incurred during the genocide. Education There are many young survivors who are orphans of genocide and head a family of their siblings. After genocide, many children in Rwanda found themselves suddenly assuming adult roles and responsibilities when they themselves needed parental care. Over 15,000 young survivors have no access to school, and efforts to support them have met several challenges. The more grown-up survivors are expected to be at school for more than 10 hours a day, but have younger children to take care of at home. They need food and clothing, scholastic materials and shelter. Although the Government of Rwanda set up a fund called FARG to facilitate orphans to study, the contribution is inadequate and many of this vulnerable group are unable to obtain support from FARG. Shelter 20,000 households of vulnerable survivors have no accommodation or a decent place to sleep, often having to live a transitory life, moving from place to place to seek shelter (Rwandan Ministry of Social Affairs, 2007). This results in high anxiety and hopelessness. Most of these families are very poor; left to deal with the consequences of genocide, and general ill health, with no support. Many of the needy have no skills to acquire jobs. Even those in employment cannot afford to build a house because building materials are too costly or they find it increasingly difficult to find the resources to build houses of their own, to buy or to rent. Without shelter security and rehabilitation becomes impossible. Justice Personal security for survivors in Rwanda is an ongoing concern, as many must live side-by-side with men who raped them and killed their families, as the perpetrators of the genocide are being released back into the community. The country no longer has the resource to continue to keep these men incarcerated, and so by admitting guilt at local gacaca (community- based) trials they are now free. The insecurity of survivors is fuelled by intimidation, harassment, death threats and killings by the release prisoners through gacaca. Memory Twenty years after genocide in Rwanda, the remains of many victims of genocide are still to be buried. Many of them still lie in trenches, abandoned latrines, churches, on the hills and many other places - some known, some yet to be discovered. Many of these locations are revealed by genocide suspects currently held in prisons that have confessed to involvement in the genocide (through gacaca). Alongside the burial programme, a programme is now being undertaken with the USC Shoah Foundation Institute to record the testimonies of survivors. Situation for survivors today Twenty years after the genocide, Rwanda has made significant progress in rebuilding internally, but the many scars remain fresh. The legacy of genocide touches almost every aspect of life for the survivors. In addition to recurring psychological trauma suffered by many from their experiences, survivors of the genocide face multiple difficulties. Many are impoverished and face complex health problems, such as HIV and AIDS, as a direct result of the violence perpetrated against them during the genocide. Survivors are still threatened with violence, attacked or killed by former perpetrators released through Gacaca, and for many a climate of fear persists. Rebuilding their lives alongside individuals responsible for murder and rape is a difficult reality faced by all survivors in Rwanda. There is an estimated 300,000 survivors in Rwanda, of which 120,000 are considered by the Rwandan Ministry of Affairs to be very vulnerable. Besides support given to survivors through SURF over the last 10 years, the only other sustainable and significant funding for survivors has come from the Rwandan Government, which dedicates 5% of its budget for educational and healthcare needs, through the Government Fund for Survivors. The support equates to an average of ¬£20 per person per year.

The territory functioned as a self-governing entity with Dominican soldiers as overseers until the eventual independence from Haiti. In February 1844 a group of Dominican independence fighters moved to restore their freedom from military-enforced Haitian rule in the Spanish-speaking two- thirds of the island. Called the La Trinitaria (\\"The Trinitarian\\"), this organization was composed of criollos, mulattoes, and blacks, and led by Juan Pablo Duarte, Francisco del Rosario S√°nchez and Mat√≠as Ram√≥n Mella. In the Dominican Republic Independence Day is celebrated as February 27, the day of revolt against Haitian occupation.Dominican Independence Day Background By the late 18th century, the island of Hispaniola had been divided into two European colonies: Saint-Domingue, in the west, governed by France; and Santo Domingo, governed by Spain, occupying the eastern two-thirds of Hispaniola. By the 1790s, large-scale rebellions erupted in the western portion of the island, spearheaded by men such as Toussaint Louverture and Jean-Jacques Dessalines which led to the eventual removal of the French and the independence of Haiti. Following the independence of Haiti, large portions of the remaining French population were executed. The eastern portion of the island was preparing itself for an eventual separation from Spain. =First unification under the French= During the second half of the eighteenth century, Saint-Domingue quickly developed into the most prosperous plantation colony of the New World. As a result of the sugar plantations of the French colony worked by African slaves; sugar had become an indispensable commodity in Europe. By contrast, Santo Domingo, the eastern side that had once been the headquarters of Spanish colonial power in the New World, had long fallen into decline. The economy was stalled, the land largely unexploited and used for subsistence agriculture and cattle ranching, and the population was much lower than in Saint-Domingue. The accounts by the Dominican essayist and politician Jos√© N√∫√±ez de C√°ceres cite the Spanish colony's population at around 80,000, mainly composed of criollos, mulattos, freedmen, and a few black slaves. Saint-Domingue, on the other hand, was nearing a million slaves. In the aftermath of the war between the new French Republic and Spain, the latter, by the Peace of Basel of 22 July 1795, ceded its two-thirds of the island to France in exchange for the evacuation of the province of Guipuzcoa occupied by the French since 1793. However, due to the near chaotic situation in Saint- Domingue resulting from uprisings by mulattos an freedmen since 1791, the expected armed opposition of the Spanish settlers of Santo Domingo who feared the abolition of slavery if the French were to take over, and the belief that British forces would seize Santo Domingo if the transfer was effected, the Committee of Public Safety decided to delay the occupation until such time as it had enough military and naval forces to take possession of the eastern part of the island. This was to occur in January 1801 when Toussaint Louverture, then still loyal to France, occupied Santo Domingo in the name of the French Republic.Yves Benot, \\"Comment Santo Domingo n'a pas √©t√© occup√© par la R√©publique fran√ßaise en 1795-1796\\", Annales historiques de la R√©volution fran√ßaise, 1998, No. 311, pp. 79‚Äì81. https://www.persee.fr/doc/ahrf_0003-4436_1998_num_311_1_2089 In 1804 the leader of the Haitian revolution, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, declared Haiti's independence. Independence did not come easily, given the fact that Haiti had been France's most profitable colony. Under Toussaint Louverture's government, slavery was abolished for the first time on the eastern portion of Hispaniola until the colony was ceded to France. While the French had lost their former colony of Saint-Domingue by 1804, the French commander of the former Spanish side had been able to repulse the attacks of Jean-Jacques Dessalines, but in 1808 the people revolted and the following year, with the help of a British squadron, ended French control of the city of Santo Domingo. Spanish rule was reestablished. However, this short period under which the whole of Hispaniola was de jure under French rule was to be the chief justification of the freed Haitians in their quest to reunite the island under their rule. =1805: Siege on the city Santo Domingo= In February 1805, Haitian forces, under Jean- Jacques Dessalines, invaded from the southern route in opposition of French- led approved slave raiding. Unable to overpower the Spanish-French defense, and intimidated by the arrival of a French fleet in support of Borgella in Santo Domingo, the army of Dessalines along with Henri Christophe raided through the interior Dominican towns Santiago and Moca, while Alexandre P√©tion invaded Azua. On his retreat from Santo Domingo, Dessalines arrived in Santiago on 12 April 1805. While in Santiago, Haitian forces set fire to the town, including churches and convents. The army killed approximately 400 inhabitants including some priests and took prisoners to Haiti. More people were killed on Dessalines orders in the French-held portions of the island, including the towns of Monte Plata, Cotu√≠ and La Vega and approximately 500 people of the northern town of Moca. The barrister Gaspar de Arredondo y Pichardo wrote, \\"40 [Dominican] children had their throats cut at the Moca's church, and the bodies found at the presbytery, which is the space that encircles the church's altar...\\"Gaspar de Arredondo y Pichardo, Memoria de mi salida de la isla de Santo Domingo el 28 de abril de 1805 (Memoirs of my leaving the island of Santo Domingo 28 April 1805) Survivors from the raids fled to western locations including Hig√ºey through Cotu√≠ as well as to other territories of the Spanish Antilles. =1806: Struggle to unite the South and North of Haiti= Dessalines was assassinated, an act which was instigated by his own generals Henri Christophe and Alexandre P√©tion. Afterward, both Christophe and P√©tion failed to agree to on who was going to be the next leader-for-life (a title created by Dessalines himself), so they went separate ways: Christophe took the North of Haiti (which he named \\"Kingdom of Haiti\\"), while P√©tion got for himself the South part of Haiti (the newly created \\"Republic of Haiti\\"); and immediately they started a series of wars to take over the other's side. The internal military conflicts lasted until 1820 when Haitian president Jean-Pierre Boyer finally unified both the South and North of Haiti. After this, Boyer aimed his sights on the struggling Spanish-side of the island. =1821: Independence from Spain= On 9 November 1821, the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo was toppled by a group led by Jos√© N√∫√±ez de C√°ceres, the colony's former administrator, and the rebels proclaimed independence from the Spanish crown on 1 December 1821. The new nation was known as Republic of Spanish Haiti (Spanish: Rep√∫blica del Hait√≠ Espa√±ol), as Haiti had been the indigenous name of the island. On 1 December 1821 a constitutive act was ordered to petition the union of Spanish Haiti with Gran Colombia. =Prelude to the unification= Mackau forcing Boyer to agree to pay 150 million francs to compensate French planters. A group of Dominican politicians and military officers favored uniting the newly independent nation with Haiti, as they sought for political stability under Haitian president Jean-Pierre Boyer, and were attracted to Haiti's perceived wealth and power at the time. A large faction based in the northern Cibao region were opposed to the union with Gran Colombia and also sided with Haiti. Boyer, on the other hand, had several objectives in the island that he proclaimed to be \\"one and indivisible\\": to maintain Haitian independence against potential French or Spanish attack or reconquest and to maintain the freedom of its former slaves. While appeasing the Dominican frontier officers, Jean-Pierre Boyer was already in negotiations with France to prevent an attack by fourteen French warships stationed near Port-au-Prince, the Haitian capital. The Dominicans were unaware that Boyer made a concession to the French, and agreed to pay France 150 million gold francs destined to compensated the former French slave owners. Thus, Haiti would essentially be forced into paying reparations for its freedom. Support of the unification found itself to be more popular amongst the mixed race and Black populations who believed that Boyers government would usher an era of social reform and the subsequent abolition of slavery. In contrast, the Creole population, however, found itself split on the idea of merging with the neighboring country. After deals with Bolivar fell through and receiving messages of economic and military support from Boyer, Caceres found himself more obliged to side with Creole Haiti. The idea had been gaining some traction among members of the military, and in 1821 Governor Sebasti√°n Kindel√°n y Oregon discovered that some of the Dominican military officers in Azua and Santo Domingo had already become part of the plan for unification with Haiti. A defining moment took place on November 15, 1821, when the leaders of several Dominican frontier towns, particularly Dajab√≥n and Montecristi, adopted the Haitian flag. The Dominican nationalists who were against the unification of the island were at a serious disadvantage if they were to maintain their nation's sovereignty. At the time, they had an untrained infantry force. The population was eight to ten times less than Haiti's, and the economy was stalled. Haiti, on the other hand, had formidable armed forces, both in skill and sheer size, which had been hardened in nearly ten years of repelling French Napoleonic soldiers, and British soldiers, along with the local colonialists, and military insurgents within the country. The racial massacres perpetrated in the later days of the French‚ÄìHaitian conflict only added to the determination of Haitians to never lose a battle. Unification After promising his full support to several Dominican frontier governors and securing their allegiance, Boyer ceremoniously marched into the country with 12,000 soldiers in February 1822, against a significantly smaller, untrained army serving some 70,000 Dominican souls (Haiti had a population around 600,000 people).https://www.diariolibre.com/especiales/dia- independencia/para-saber-mas-BJ9092399 On 9 February 1822, Boyer formally entered the capital city, Santo Domingo after its ephemeral independence. The island was thus united from \\"Cape Tiburon to Cape Samana in possession of one government.\\" Upon unification of both French-side (Hait√Ø) and Spanish-side (then Spanish Haiti) nations under the Haitian flag, Boyer divided the island into six departments, that were subdivided into arrondissements (administrative districts) and communes. The departments established in the west were, Nord, Ouest, Sud, and Artibonite, while the east was divided into Ozama and Cibao. This period led to large-scale land expropriations and failed efforts to force production of export crops, impose military services, restrict the use of the Spanish language, and suppress traditional customs. There was also a resurgence of the decades-old rivalries between the governing Haitian elite (mulattoes) and the masses of the black population, most notably throughout the western end. Occupation Map of the island of Haiti (1839) In order to raise funds for the huge indemnity of 150 million francs that Haiti agreed to pay the former French colonists, and which was subsequently lowered to 60 million francs, the Haitian government imposed heavy taxes on the Dominicans. Since Haiti was unable to adequately provision its army, the occupying forces largely survived by commandeering or confiscating food and supplies at gunpoint. Attempts to redistribute land conflicted with the system of communal land tenure (terrenos comuneros), which had arisen with the ranching economy, and some people resented being forced to grow cash crops under Boyer and Joseph Balthazar Inginac's Code Rural instituted in 1838 .Terrenos comuneros arose because of \\"scarce population, low value of the land, the absence of officials qualified to survey the lands, and the difficulty of dividing up the ranch in such a way that each would receive a share of the grasslands, forests, streams, palm groves, and small agricultural plots that, only when combined, made possible the exploitation of the ranch.\\" (Hoetink, The Dominican People: Notes for a Historical Sociology transl. Stephen Ault Pg. 83 (Johns Hopkins Press: Baltimore, 1982) In the rural and rugged mountainous areas, the Haitian administration was usually too inefficient to enforce its own laws. It was in the city of Santo Domingo that the effects of the occupation were most acutely felt, and it was there that the movement for independence originated. Dominican citizens also had more rights than the Haitians who were under Jean-Pierre Boyer's code rural, and often functioned as their own overseers. Haiti's constitution also forbade white elites from owning land, and the major landowning families were forcibly deprived of their properties. Many emigrated to Cuba, Puerto Rico (these two being Spanish possessions at the time) or Gran Colombia, usually with the encouragement of Haitian officials, who acquired their lands. The Haitians, who associated the Roman Catholic Church with the French slave-masters who had exploited them before independence, confiscated all church property, deported all foreign clergy, and severed the ties of the remaining clergy to the Vatican. Santo Domingo's university, the oldest in the Western Hemisphere, lacking both students and teachers had to close down, and thus the country suffered from a massive case of human capital flight. Although the occupation instated a constitution modeled after the United States Constitution throughout the island, and led to the abolition of slavery as an institution in what became known as the Dominican Republic, forms of slavery persisted in Haitian society. Several resolutions and written dispositions were expressly aimed at converting average Dominicans into second-class citizens as Boyer had done with the Haitian peasantry under the aforementioned Code Rural: restrictions of movement, prohibition to run for public office, night curfews, inability to travel in groups, banning of civilian organizations, and the indefinite closure of the state university (on the alleged grounds of its being a subversive organization) all led to the creation of movements advocating a forceful separation from Haiti with no compromises. =Resistance and Subsequent Independence= La Trinitaria meeting. In 1838 a group of educated nationalists, among them, Juan Pablo Duarte, Mat√≠as Ram√≥n Mella, and Francisco del Rosario S√°nchez founded a secret society called La Trinitaria to gain independence from Haiti. In 1843 they allied with a Haitian movement that overthrew Boyer in Haiti. After they revealed themselves as revolutionaries working for Dominican independence, the new Haitian president, Charles Rivi√®re-H√©rard, exiled or imprisoned the leading Trinitarios. At the same time, Buenaventura B√°ez, an Azua mahogany exporter and deputy in the Haitian National Assembly, was negotiating with the French Consul-General for the establishment of a French protectorate. In an uprising timed to preempt B√°ez, on February 27, 1844, the Trinitarios declared independence from Haiti, backed by Pedro Santana, a wealthy cattle-rancher from El Seibo who commanded a private army of peons who worked on his estates. This marked the beginning of the Dominican War of Independence. Aftermath and Dominican Independence (1844) Battle of Santiago After the struggles that were made by Dominican patriots to free the country from Haitian control, they had to withstand and fight against a series of incursions that served to consolidate their independence (1844‚Äì1856). Haitian soldiers would make incessant attacks to try to gain back control of the nation, but these efforts were to no avail, as the Dominicans would go on to win every battle. Haiti's military forces of 1805 were eroded over the next 50 years by the constant power struggles. What military was left devolved into a local repression force and served at the behest of a series of dictators and warlords well into the 20th century. In 1995, the democratically elected president Jean Bertrand Aristide disbanded the military forces, after he had been overthrown by them earlier in 1991. Local security was eventually handed over to United Nations' UNSTAMIH (French: MINUSTAH), from 2004 to 2017. In 2017, president Jovenel Mo√Øse proposed restoring the military forces that had been disbanded for over 22 years. Territorial disputes Neighboring towns and cities like Hincha (now Hinche), Juana M√©ndez (now Ouanaminthe), San Rafael de La Angostura (now Saint-Rapha√´l), San Miguel de la Atalaya (now Saint-Michel-de-l'Atalaye), Las Caobas (now Lascahobas), and Veladero (now Bellad√®re), among others, remained isolated with little communication with the Dominican capital whilst there were a growing Haitian influence as the gourde circulated and in addition to the Spanish language, Haitian Creole was also spoken; eventually becoming Haitian territories, however these cities would often be disputed between the two countries.

The Admiralty decided to set aside five old laid up hulks in different ports around the country, and use them as bases at which volunteers aged between 15 and 17 could spend a year being educated for future service in the navy. The plan called for an annual intake of 3,500 boys. They were to be trained in seamanship and gunnery, as well as traditional aspects of sea life. One of the hulks chosen to be converted into a school was the old 84-gun second-rate ship of the line . Despite initial objections that her layout made her unsuitable for the task, the decision went ahead. The second ship to be named HMS Ganges, and the first to be a training ship She put into Devonport on 5 May 1865 and underwent a refit. She took her first intake of 180 boys on 1 January 1866. They had been transferred from the training ship HMS Wellesley, then at Chatham. Wellesleys commander, Frederick H. Stevens also came with the boys and became Gangess commanding officer. Having been refitted to provide accommodation for 500 boys, Ganges was towed to Mylor by the paddle tug Gladiator. She arrived on 20 March 1866 and was anchored in the Carrick Roads. =Allegations of abuse= Memorial in Mylor churchyard commemorates the 53 boys who died whilst training on HMS 'Ganges' between 1866 and 1899. During Gangess time in Cornwall allegations of harsh and brutal treatment were reported to the Admiralty. One wardroom steward shot himself over the matter, and the reports aroused indignation in the local community. Captain Tremlett, the senior officer of training ships, was ordered to investigate the situation and reported that Commander Stevens 'had given punishments which were not laid down in the Training Regulations and had also prevented his ship's company from taking due leave.' Stevens and his first lieutenant were subsequently removed, and were replaced by Commander F. W. Wilson on 24 July 1866. By the end of 1866 there were 478 boys at the establishment. Ganges was occasionally sailed to Devonport to undergo refits. The establishment had become an important part of local life, as in 1870 a rumour began to circulate that Ganges would not return after one such refit. The mayor was pressured to contact the local Member of Parliament, and also to ask questions of a Government minister. The rumour was then disproved. By 1899 the declining number of boys joining Ganges led the Admiralty to decide to move her to a more populated area. Petitions were organised by the local councils, but were unable to sway the Admiralty. Ganges sailed from Mylor on 27 August 1899. She was refitted in Devonport, which involved her keel being scraped. The boys were quartered at and whilst this work was carried out. She then sailed to Sheerness in company with . She spent two months here before being towed to Harwich by the tug Alligator. She arrived on 11 November 1899. had arrived shortly before Ganges and served as a temporary hospital ship. Ganges at Harwich Ganges commenced her usual role at Harwich, with Caroline providing medical facilities whilst shore facilities were constructed in the town. Hospital facilities had been completed by 1902 and Caroline was refitted at Chatham to serve as an overflow training ship for Ganges, providing accommodation for another 60 boys. Despite these developments, it was decided to move Ganges again, this time to Shotley, in Suffolk. Work had already begun there on new Royal Naval Sick Quarters. Ganges left Harwich in 1903 for Shotley. ¬£20,000 had been set aside to build shore based accommodation, and a further ¬£80,000 had been earmarked to cover the future expansion of the facility. Ganges at Shotley New building works began in February 1904, and the old arrived. She had already spent time as a depot ship for various establishments. She had been named HMS Boscawen in March 1904 whilst at Portland and now arrived to provide further facilities for Ganges. The completion of shore works in 1905 led to the establishment of RNTE Shotley on 4 October. The facility included the buildings onshore and the ships offshore, which were HMS Ganges, HMS Caroline and HMS Boscawen II. The focus of the establishment now moved to shore based activities, and the capstan, bitts and figureheads were moved from the ships onto the shore. In November the establishment received the ex , which had been renamed HMS Boscawen III. =1906 changes= , left; HMS Caroline, centre foreground; , right, circa. 1906 1906 was a period of considerable changes for the establishment. On 21 June HMS Ganges was renamed HMS Tenedos III in preparation for her reassignment to become part of the Boy Artificers Establishment at Chatham. She left the establishment on 5 July. Also on 21 June HMS Boscawen (the old HMS Minotaur) was renamed HMS Ganges as her replacement. The establishment was further swelled by the merging of the pupils of the establishments of , and . HMS Boscawen II (the former HMS Agincourt) was renamed HMS Ganges II. =Later developments= In 1907 the -high mast of the old steam corvette was erected. It would become a major landmark. The old HMS Minotaur had been HMS Ganges since 1906, but was renamed HMS Ganges II on 25 April 1908. HMS Caroline was renamed HMS Ganges that month as her replacement. In 1909 the Signal School was established and three signal masts were erected. In 1910 the old HMS Agincourt had been removed to become a coal hulk, leaving only the old HMS Minotaur as Ganges II. By 1912 Ganges II was being used as an overflow ship as the number of boys in the establishment increased, and she was duly moved closer inshore. A floating dock was also moored nearby for the use of destroyers and submarines. In September 1913 HMS Ganges (the former HMS Caroline) was renamed HMS Powerful III and left the establishment. HMS Ganges II (the former HMS Minotaur) was renamed HMS Ganges. She became the base ship of the establishment during the First World War. On 8 October 1913 HMS Ganges II became an independent command and was based at RNTE Shotley. =First World War= From 1914 to 1918, HMS Ganges was commanded by Commodore (later Rear- Admiral) G. C. Cayley. In 1916 the establishment was bombed by a German Zeppelin. Rationing measures nearly produced a mutiny in 1917 but dispersed peacefully. Other wartime activities included the establishment of a trawler base at Ganges II, and the completion of of anti-submarine nets by boys and staff. In 1918 the base suffered outbreaks of spanish flu and diphtheria. Armistice Day was celebrated by a display of mast manning. =Post war developments= By October 1919 briefly became the depot ship for the base. Also that year HMS Ganges, the former HMS Minotaur was renamed HMS Ganges II, and so joined RNTE Shotley in sharing the name. On 3 August 1921 the became the establishment's tender. By now so many boys were attending the base that they had to be sent to training battleships to finish their training. These included the Portsmouth-based , and . HMS Ganges II (the old HMS Minotaur) was towed away in 1922 by the Dutch tug Swartezee and was broken up. Since only active ships bore names at this time, the name HMS Ganges temporarily ceased to exist, but the training establishment at RNTE Shotley continued. HMS Tring was paid off into reserve on 20 October 1925 as an economy measure. It was decided by 1927 that RNTE Shotley would be renamed after the original training ship and she was recommissioned as HMS Ganges that year. In 1930 Edward, Prince of Wales visited the establishment. A number of administrative reforms were also carried out this year, including the establishment of eight internal divisions named after famous admirals. Main entrance to HMS Ganges =Ganges in the Second World War= The outbreak of the Second World War led to the decision to close HMS Ganges as a boys' training centre. Training finished on 16 May 1940 and operations were moved to . HMS Ganges continued in service, being used as a centre for 'Hostilities Only New Entry Training'. A new overspill centre was commissioned at Highnam Court, near Gloucester on 28 April 1941, and it was defined as a tender to HMS Ganges. Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent paid a visit to HMS Ganges on 1 October 1941, and on 31 January 1942 operations at Highnam Court were transferred to . Another royal visit came on 12 October when Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester inspected the establishment. Eventually by the end of the war 60,968 ratings had passed through Ganges. =Postwar and closure= Ganges reopened as a boys' training establishment in October 1945. The establishment soon regained its former size and importance, continuing to expand its facilities. A number of VIP visits took place, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh visited in 1956, First Lord of the Admiralty Lord Carrington visited in 1960 and Queen Elizabeth II in 1961. In 1968 the s and were attached to Ganges. In 1975 Ganges was opened to the public for the first time, with Admiral of the Fleet Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma the guest of honour. It was decided by the Admiralty to close HMS Ganges, which was done on 6 June 1976. The white ensign was lowered for the last time on 28 October and the establishment's training duties were transferred to . Following closure of HMS Ganges the married quarter estate was used by Royal Air Force (RAF) personnel from nearby RAF facilities. In 1999 a large section of the former non-commissioned officer quarters were acquired by The Welbeck Estate Group.

Established in 1659, it was originally named \\"North Burying Ground\\", and was the city's second cemetery. History Several headstones from the 18th and 19th century in the cemetery. The cemetery was founded on February 20, 1659, when the town bought land on Copp's Hill from John Baker and Daniel Turell to start the \\"North Burying Ground\\". Now named \\"Copp's Hill Burying Ground\\" (although often referred to as \\"Copp's Hill Burial Ground\\"), it is the second oldest cemetery in Boston (second only to the King's Chapel Burying Ground founded in 1630). It contains more than 1200 marked graves, including the remains of various notable Bostonians from the colonial era into the 1850s. The first extension was made on January 7, 1708 when the town bought additional land from Judge Samuel Sewall and his wife Hannah. The land was part of a pasture which Mrs. Sewall had inherited from her father, John Hull, master of the mint. A still-legible headstone in Copp's Hill Burying Ground. Benjamin Weld and his wife Nabby sold the second extension to the town for $10,000 on December 18, 1809 soon after they had bought it from Jonathan Merry, who had used it as pasture. Ten years later, Charles Wells, later mayor of Boston, bought a small parcel of land from John Bishop of Medford and used this as a cemetery that was later merged with the adjacent North Burying Ground. Because of this complicated history, it is no longer possible to discern the original boundaries of the cemetery. On the Snow Hill Street side are the many unmarked graves of the African Americans who lived in the \\"New Guinea\\" community at the foot of the hill. In addition to the graves there are 272 tombs, most of which bear inscriptions that are still legible. By 1840 the cemetery had fallen into near disuse but the town continued to maintain the site intermittently. By 1878 it was badly neglected. The cemetery was not an official stop on the Freedom Trail when it was created in 1951 but it has since been added and is much-frequented by tourists and photographers. The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.

The line currently runs from the Old Court Metro Subway Station in Pikesville, Maryland to the Patapsco Light Rail Stop, and serves Randallstown, Windsor Mill, Woodlawn, Catonsville, Arbutus, Halethorpe, and Lansdowne, and the campuses of UMBC and CCBC Catonsville (formerly Catonsville Community College). History Route 77 was one of the first cross-county bus lines in Baltimore County, Maryland. It started operating in 1974 as an experimental service, originating from the central business district of Pikesville, and terminating at UMBC.http://www.btco.net/Routes/route7.htm Prior to its introduction, most of the route of Route 77 was not served by any bus lines. For a brief period in 1966, a shuttle service identified as Route 35 operated between UMBC and Catonsville Community College.http://www.btco.net/Routes/Obscure.html#35 Streetcar followed by bus service operated in the Halethorpe area. Route 20 operated between Security Square and Westview Malls along a different route, and a branch of Route 44 served Rutherford Business Park (and continued to until 2005). At that time, service was provided on weekdays only, with rush hour service operating only once every 40 minutes and midday service provided every 50 minutes. The line, which was designed to provide service for the students of UMBC and Catonsville Community College, and had its schedule coordinated to the classes of these two institutions, did not provide service out of Pikesville before 6:30 AM or UMBC before 7:30 AM. Within the decades that followed, the line performed above expectations, drawing riders from far beyond the college crowd, and proving that a cross-county (suburb-to-suburb) bus route could succeed in the Baltimore area. In 1987, in conjunction with the opening of the Old Court Metro Subway Station, and the extension of Route M-2 to this location, the station also became the new northern terminus for Route 77. Some trips operated along the old route to Pikesville during a period of time when Old Court Station was closed at night. This portion was discontinued in 2005.Owings Mills Times In 1995, selected trips were extended south of UMBC to the Patapsco Light Rail Stop through the Halethorpe area, providing improved connections. The frequency was also slightly improved. In 1997, Saturday service was added. At first, it operated only between Old Court and Security Square Mall, but it was later extended to UMBC. Sunday service was added in 2001. In 2005, as part of the Greater Baltimore Bus Initiative, all trips were extended to the Patapsco Light Rail Stop, and the route was slightly changed to replace a portion of Route 31, which was merged into other routes.http://www.courant.com/news/traffic/bal- te.md.buses09jun09,0,4331322.story Midday and Saturday service was increased to one bus every 30 minutes.

Overview In 1867 Alfred Russel Wallace made predictions supporting Darwin's surmise. In January 1862 while researching insect pollination of orchids, Charles Darwin received a package of orchids from the distinguished horticulturist James Bateman, and in a follow up letter with a second package Bateman's son Robert confirmed the names of the specimens, including Angraecum sesquipedale from Madagascar. Darwin was surprised at the defining characteristic of this species: the \\"astonishing length\\" of the whip-like green spur forming the nectary of each flower, and remarked to Joseph Hooker \\"I have just received such a Box full from Mr Bateman with the astounding Angr√¶cum sesquipedalia with a nectary a foot long‚Äî Good Heavens what insect can suck it\\"[?] The spur of the flower is from its tip to the tip of the flower's lip. The name \\"sesquipedale\\" is Latin for \\"one and a half feet,\\" referring to the spur length. From his observations and experiments with pushing a probe into the spur of the flower, Darwin surmised in his 1862 book Fertilisation of Orchids that there must be a pollinator moth with a proboscis long enough to reach the nectar at the end of the spur. In its attempt to get the nectar at the end of the spur the moth would get pollen rubbed off on its head. The next orchid it visited would then be pollinated in the same manner. In 1867 Alfred Russel Wallace published an article in which he supported Darwin's hypothesis, remarking that the African sphinx moth Xanthopan morganii (then known as Macrosila morganii) had a proboscis almost long enough to reach the bottom of the spur. In a footnote to this article Wallace wrote \\"That such a moth exists in Madagascar may be safely predicted; and naturalists who visit that island should search for it with as much confidence as astronomers searched for the planet Neptune,--and they will be equally successful!\\" Subsequently, the sphingid experts Walter Rothschild and Karl Jordan received one male and one female specimen of Xanthopan morganii (commonly called Morgan's sphinx moth) with an especially long proboscis, collected on Madagascar by Charles Oberth√ºr and Paul Mabille. Since Wallace predicted that the mystery pollinator would turn out to be a sphinx moth, rather than simply a large moth as Darwin had suggested, the Madagascan form was named subspecies praedicta by Walter Rothschild & Karl Jordan, in honour of Wallace's (not Darwin's) prediction. Darwin's earlier, but less specific, prediction was not even mentioned by them. The Madagascan subspecies is known as Wallace's sphinx moth and it differs from the African form by having a pink, rather than white, breast and abdomen and a black apical line on the forewing, which is broader than in mainland specimens. Molecular clock models using either rate- or fossil-based calibrations imply that the Madagascan subspecies X. morganii praedicta and the African subspecies X. morganii morganii diverged 7.4 ¬± 2.8 Mya, which overlaps the divergence of A. sesquipedale from its sister, A. sororium, namely 7.5 ¬± 5.2 Mya. Since both these orchids have extremely long spurs, long spurs likely existed before that and were exploited by long-tongued moths similar to Xanthopan morganii praedicta. The long geological separation of the subspecies morganii and praedicta matches their morphological differences in the colour of breast and abdomen. Morgan's sphinx moth approaches the flower to ascertain by scent whether or not it is the correct orchid species.

Opened in 2001, it combines a clinic and hospital in one facility.  History  The first hospital in Red Wing, Minnesota was established in 1884. Located at southwest Dakota and Levee Streets. The Andrew Koch building served as the first hospital in Red Wing. The house was built by A. Koch in the 1850s. The current hospital was formed from the merge of River Region Health Services and Interstate Medical Center in 1997. =River Region Health Services= Red Wing was later served by St. John's Regional Health Center and was organized into River Region Health Services (RRHS) in 1986. It was determined in a community- wide planning process, initiated in 1985 and was completed in mid-1986, that the city of Red Wing wanted to create a regional health care system. The board leadership of St. John's Regional Health Center, Seminary Memorial Home (representing the nonprofit health care providers) and Interstate Medical Center (representing most area physicians) agreed with the goals of \\"Red Wing 2000.\\" An organizational format was created for what was known as River Region Health Services (RRHS). Recommendations to create a new system and to build stronger working relationships with physicians were presented to the boards of St. John's Regional Health Center, Seminary Memorial Home and Interstate Medical Center in September 1986. There was a clear vision that the future trend in health care was toward de-institutionalization‚Äì‚Äìoutpatient and home care, and alternative living arrangements. To meet the changing needs, RRHS created two additional subsidiaries in River Region Community Services (RRCS) and River Region Housing Corporation (RRHC). =Interstate Medical Center= Interstate Medical Center was a professional corporation and its predecessor was the Interstate Clinic. It was founded in a partnership between Edward H. Juers, M.D., and Raymond F. Hedin, M.D., in 1932. In 1940, having additional physicians join the medical staff, their group, now the Interstate Clinic, moved to a new building at Third and Dakota streets. The group incorporated as the Interstate Medical Center, Professional Associates in 1969, and moved to US Highway 61 in 1970. A major expansion of the building occurred in 1980. In 1986, a second building was added at this site. In 1981, George M.B. Hawley, M.D., became associated with the Interstate Medical Center and the first branch office began operation at 303 West Fifth Street. In 1987, that office expanded and moved to Fourth Street in the Seminary Plaza. The branch office in Ellsworth, Wisconsin was constructed in 1984. In 1986, Robert Thompson, M.D., in Zumbrota, joined Interstate Medical Center. That office expanded in 1987 and moved to 525 Mill Street. =Current Hospital and purchase by Mayo Clinic= In 1997, Fairview Red Wing Health Services brought together River Region Health Services and Interstate Medical Center as one coordinated system of care. The new Fairview Red Wing Medical Center served the clinic and hospital needs of Red Wing and the surrounding area. Red Wing Medical Center opened in 2001 on the West side of Red Wing, Minnesota located on Fairview Boulevard, just off Red Wing Avenue S near US Highway 61. Red Wing Medical Center was purchased by Mayo Clinic in 2012 and was renamed Mayo Clinic Health System in Red Wing.  Governance  Mayo Clinic Health System in Red Wing is part of Mayo Clinic Health System. Their merger and partnership with Mayo Clinic Health System and Mayo Clinic puts the former Red Wing Medical Center at the forefront of world-class research and innovative patient treatments. The University of Minnesota is world-renowned for leading in transplants, heart surgery and treatments for other diseases. The partnership we entered in 1997 stands as a national model for academic- and community-based health system collaboration.

Design  With DDM (Dynamic Device Mapping) Technology, the communication between shared peripherals and all connected systems are maintained 100% of the time, even as a user switches between the KVM ports. This makes generic device emulation unnecessary as the DDM allows each connected computer system to believe all connected I/O devices are remaining connected even as the KVM switch might move to another port. KVM device emulation Many USB KVM devices provide peripheral emulation, sending signals to the computers that are not currently selected to simulate a keyboard, mouse and monitor being connected. The emulation is used to avoid problems with machines which may reboot in unattended operation. Peripheral emulation services embedded in the hardware also provides continuous support where computers require constant communication with the peripherals. In addition, some types of computer systems do not treat USB devices as hot- pluggable, which means the keyboard and mouse will not be re-detected when switching back to a particular KVM port. For these types of systems, it is necessary to implement device emulation. Standard device emulation has its limitations. When emulating a USB keyboard, mouse, and monitor it is impossible for most KVM's to simulate various types of I/O devices specifically. As a result, KVM switches will sometimes offer inconsistent performance and even sometimes unsolved compatibility issues with the shared keyboard, mouse, and other devices.Kengsington Expert Mouse Issues. - TechNet Forums The intent of Dynamic Device Mapping is to resolve the issues that standard device mapping sometimes faces.

The program was aired as late as April 2013 on Silver Screen Classics, usually late on Saturday nights. The Show Condensed Classics was an attempt at reviving the \\"horror host\\" format of the 1950s and 1960s. The program aired movies such as The Terror of Tiny Town and Gorgo, which were condensed from their original running time to about 40 minutes, presided over by host and head writer Dave Shaw. The hosted segments of the show would appear four times a broadcast, and rarely had anything to do with the movies. Some of the hosted segments were parodies of different movies, which were usually cult films such as Mulholland Drive and Misery. Style Shaw described the show as \\"What if Dean Martin hosted a horror movie show?\\", and then ran with that aesthetic. The hosted segments were shot in black and white and featured Shaw wearing a tuxedo in the \\"Condensed Classics\\" movie lounge where he'd do short comedy bits, usually with a comely female sidekick in a 1940s era cocktail dress.

Many games feature space combat, and some games feature commerce and trading in addition to combat. Overview Some games in the genre aim to recreate a realistic portrayal of space flight, involving the calculation of orbits within a more complete physics simulation than pseudo space flight simulators. Others focus on gameplay rather than simulating space flight in all its facets. The realism of the latter games is limited to what the game designer deems to be appropriate for the gameplay, instead of focusing on the realism of moving the spacecraft in space. Some \\"flight models\\" use a physics system based on Newtonian physics, but these are usually limited to maneuvering the craft in its direct environment, and do not take into consideration the orbital calculations that would make such a game a simulator. Many of the pseudo simulators feature faster than light travel. Examples of true simulators which aim at piloting a space craft in a manner that conforms with the laws of nature include Orbiter, Kerbal Space Program and Microsoft Space Simulator. Examples of more fantastical video games that bend the rules of physics in favor of streamlining and entertainment, include Wing Commander, Star Wars: X-Wing and Freelancer. The modern space flight game genre emerged at the point when home computers became sufficiently powerful to draw basic wireframe graphics in real-time. The game Elite is widely considered to be the breakthrough game of the genre, and as having successfully melded the \\"space trading\\" and flight sim genres. Elite was highly influential upon later games of its type, although it did have some precursors. Games similar to Elite are sometimes called \\"Elite-clones\\". Space flight games and simulators, at one time popular, had for much of the new millennium been considered a \\"dead\\" genre. However, open-source and enthusiast communities managed to produce some working, modern titles (e.g. Orbiter Spaceflight Simulator); and 2011's commercially released Kerbal Space Program was notably well-received, even by the aerospace community. Some more recent games, most notably Elite: Dangerous, and No Man's Sky, have brought new attention to the space trading and combat game subgenre. Subgenres =Realistic simulation= Realistic space simulators seek to represent a vessel's behaviour under the influence of the laws of physics. As such, the player normally concentrates on following checklists or planning tasks. Piloting is generally limited to dockings, landings or orbital maneuvers. The reward for the player is on mastering real or realistic spacecraft, celestial mechanics and astronautics. Classical games with this approach include Space Shuttle: A Journey into Space (1982), Rendezvous: A Space Shuttle Simulation (1982), The Halley Project (1985), Shuttle (1992) and Microsoft Space Simulator (1994). If the definition is expanded to include decision making and planning, then Buzz Aldrin's Race Into Space (1992) is also notable for historical accuracy and detail. On this game the player takes the role of Administrator of NASA or Head of the Soviet Space Program with the ultimate goal of being the first side to conduct a successful human moon landing. Most recently Orbiter and Space Shuttle Mission 2007 provide more elaborate simulations, with realistic 3D virtual cockpits and external views. Kerbal Space Program can be considered a space simulator, even though it portrays an imaginary universe with tweaked physics, masses and distances to enhance gameplay. Nevertheless, the physics and rocket design principles are much more realistic than in the space combat or trading subgenres. The game Lunar Flight (2012) simulates flying around the lunar surface in a craft resembling the Apollo Lunar Module, while Perilune (2019) is an example of a lunar landing simulation with realistic physics designed for Android mobile devices. =Space combat game= Strike Suit Zero is a space flight combat game released in 2013. Most games in the space combat genre feature futuristic scenarios involving space flight and extra planetary combat. Such games generally place the player into the controls of a small starfighter or smaller starship in a military force of similar and larger spaceships and do not take into account the physics of space flight, often citing some technological advancement to explain the lack thereof. The prominent Wing Commander, X-Wing and Freespace series all use this approach. Exceptions include Independence War, Independence War 2 and the Star Trek: Bridge Commander series, which model craft at a larger scale and/or in a more strategic fashion. I-War also features Newtonian style physics for the behaviour of the spacecraft, but not orbital mechanics. Space combat games tend to be mission-based, as opposed to the more open-ended nature of space trading and combat games. =Space trading and combat game= The general formula for the space trading and combat game, which has changed little since its genesis, is for the player to begin in a relatively small, outdated ship with little money or status and for the player to work his or her way up, gaining in status and power through trading, exploration, combat or a mix of different methods. The ship the player controls is generally larger than that in pure space combat simulator. Notable examples of the genre include Elite, Wing Commander: Privateer, and Freelancer. In some instances, plot plays only a limited role and only a loose narrative framework tends to be provided. In certain titles of the X series, for instance, players may ignore the plot for as long as they wish and are even given the option to disable the plot completely and instead play in sandbox mode. Many games of this genre place a strong emphasis on factional conflict, leading to many small mission-driven subplots that unravel the tensions of the galaxy. Oolite (2004). Games of this type often allow the player to choose among multiple roles to play and multiple paths to victory. This aspect of the genre is very popular, but some people have complained that, in some titles, the leeway given to the player too often is only superficial, and that, in reality, the roles offered to players are very similar, and open-ended play too frequently restricted by scripted sequences. As an example, Freelancer has been criticised for being too rigid in its narrative structure, being in one case compared negatively with Grand Theft Auto, another series praised for its open-ended play. All space trading and combat games feature the core gameplay elements of directly controlling the flight of some sort of space vessel, generally armed, and of navigating from one area to another for a variety of reasons. As technology has improved it has been possible to implement a number of extensions to gameplay, such as dynamic economies and cooperative online play. Overall, however, the core gameplay mechanics of the genre have changed little over the years. Besides the array of space-themed trade and combat games, there also exist a small number of games with similar mechanics, but with a less traditional historical setting. These include the Sid Meier's Pirates! and Mount and Blade franchises. Some more recent games, such as 2003's EVE Online, have expanded the scope of the experience by including thousands of simultaneous online players in what is sometimes referred to as a \\"living universe\\" ‚Äì a dream some have held since the genre's early beginnings. Star Citizen, a title currently in open, crowd-funded development by Chris Roberts and others involved in Freelancer and Wing Commander, aims to bridge the gap between the EVE-like living universe game and the fast action of other games in the genre. An additional sub-class of space trading games eliminate combat entirely, focusing instead entirely on trading and economic manipulation in order to achieve success. Control systems =Video games= Most modern space flight games on the personal computer allow a player to utilise a combination of the WASD keys of the keyboard and mouse as a means of controlling the game (games such as Microsoft's Freelancer use this control system exclusively). By far the most popular control system among genre enthusiasts, however, is the joystick. Most fans prefer to use this input method whenever possible, but expense and practicality mean that many are forced to use the keyboard and mouse combination (or gamepad if such is the case). The lack of uptake among the majority of modern gamers has also made joysticks a sort of an anachronism, though some new controller designs and simplification of controls offer the promise that space sims may be playable in their full capacity on gaming consoles at some time in the future. In fact, X3: Reunion, sometimes considered one of the more cumbersome and difficult series to master within the trading and combat genre, was initially planned for the Xbox but later cancelled. Another example of space simulators is an arcade space flight simulation action game called Star Conflict, where the players can fight in both PvE and PvP modes. =Realistic simulators= Realistic simulators feature spacecraft systems and instrument simulation, using a combination of extensive keyboard shortcuts and mouse clicks on virtual instrument panels. Most of the maneuvers and operations consist of setting certain systems into the desired configuration, or in setting autopilots. Real time hands on piloting can happen, depending on the simulated spacecraft. For example, it is common to use a joystick analog control to land a space shuttle (or any other spaceplane) or the LEM (or similar landers). Dockings can be performed more precisely using the numerical keypad. Overall, the simulations have more complex control systems than game, with the limit being the physical reproduction of the actual simulated spacecraft (see Simulation cockpit). History Early attempts at 3D space simulation date back as far as 1974's Spasim, an online multi-player space simulator in which players attempt to destroy each other's ships. The earliest known space trader dates to 1974's Star Trader, a game where the entire interface was text-only and included a star map with multiple ports buying and selling 6 commodities. It was written in BASIC. =Star Raiders= Star Raiders was introduced in 1979 for the then-new Atari 8-bit family and became the killer app for the system. Doug Neubauer created the game as a combination of Star Wars and the text-based Star Trek mainframe game. Using smoothly scaled 2D sprites and 3D particles to mimic a first person view of a volume of space, Star Raiders simulates clearing sectors of enemy ships while managing resources and damage to the ship's different systems. In addition to forward and rear views from the ship, the game provides both a galactic map and sector scanner to show enemy and friendly starbase locations. The game does not pause while these displays are active; they keep updating in real-time. It is one of the games that inspired Elite and the Wing Commander series. It also resulted in direct clones, including Space Spartans for Intellivision and Starmaster for the Atari 2600, both from 1982. =Elite= Elite, released in 1984, was one of the first home titles to feature fully three-dimensional graphics.Elite has made a lasting impression on developers, worldwide, extending even into different genres. In interviews, senior producers of CCP Games cited Elite as one of the inspirations for their acclaimed MMORPG, EVE Online. √û√≥r√≥lfur Beck, CCP's co-founder, credits Elite as the game that impacted him most on the Commodore 64. Developers of Jumpgate Evolution, Battlecruiser 3000AD, Infinity: The Quest for Earth, Hard Truck: Apocalyptic Wars and Flatspace likewise all claim Elite as a source of inspiration. Elite was named one of the sixteen most influential games in history at Telespiele, a German technology and games trade show, and is being exhibited at such places as the London Science Museum in the \\"Game On\\" exhibition organized and toured by the Barbican Art Gallery. Elite was also named #12 on IGN's 2000 \\"Top 25 PC Games of All Time\\" list, the #3 most influential video game ever by the Times Online in 2007, and \\"best game ever\\" for the BBC Micro by Beebug Magazine in 1984. Elite's sequel, Frontier: Elite II, was named #77 on PC Zone's \\"101 Best PC Games Ever\\" list in 2007. Similar praise has been bestowed elsewhere in the media from time to time. Elite is one of the most popularly requested games to be remade, and some argue that it is still the best example of the genre to date, with more recent titles--including its sequel--not rising up to its level. It has been credited as opening the door for future online persistent worlds, such as Second Life and World of Warcraft, and as being the first truly open-ended game. It is to this day one of the most ambitious games ever made, residing in only 22 kilobytes of memory and on a single floppy disk. The latest incarnation of the franchise, titled Elite: Dangerous, was released on 16 December 2014, following a successful Kickstarter campaign. =Trade Wars= Though not as well known as Elite, Trade Wars is noteworthy as the first multiplayer space trader. A BBS door, Trade Wars was released in 1984 as an entirely different branch of the space trader tree, having been inspired by Hunt the Wumpus, the board game Risk, and the original space trader, Star Trader. As a pure space trader, Trade Wars lacked any space flight simulator elements, instead featuring abstract open world trading and combat set in an outer space populated by both human and NPC opponents. In 2009, it was named the #10 best PC game by PC World Magazine. =Other early examples= Other notable early examples include Space Shuttle: A Journey into Space (1982), Rendezvous: A Space Shuttle Simulation (1982), and Star Trek: Strategic Operations Simulator (1982), which featured five different controls to learn, six different enemies, and 40 different simulation levels of play, making it one of the most elaborate vector games ever released.Mark J. P. Wolf (2008), The video game explosion: a history from PONG to Playstation and beyond, p. 70, ABC-CLIO, Other early examples include Nasir Gebelli's 1982 Apple II computer games Horizon V which featured an early radar mechanic and Zenith which allowed the player ship to rotate,John Romero, John Romero, and Ginga Hyoryu Vifam, which allowed first-person open space exploration with a radar displaying the destination and player/enemy positions as well as an early physics engine where approaching a planet's gravitational field pulls the player towards it. Following Elite were games such as The Halley Project (1985), Echelon (1987) and Microsoft Space Simulator (1994). Star Luster, released for the NES console and arcades in 1985, featured a cockpit view, a radar displaying enemy and base locations, the ability to warp anywhere, and a date system keeping track of the current date. (Translation) Some tabletop and board games, such as Traveller or Merchant of Venus, also feature themes of space combat and trade. Traveller influenced the development of Elite (the main character in Traveller is named \\"Jamison\\"; the main character in Elite is named \\"Jameson\\") and Jumpgate Evolution. =Wing Commander= The Wing Commander (1990‚Äì2007) series from Origin Systems, Inc. was a marked departure from the standard formula up to that point, bringing space combat to a level approaching the Star Wars films. Set beginning in the year 2654, and characterized by designer Chris Roberts as \\"World War II in space\\", it features a multinational cast of pilots from the \\"Terran Confederation\\" flying missions against the predatory, aggressive Kilrathi, a feline warrior race (heavily inspired by the Kzinti of Larry Niven's Known Space universe). Wing Commander (1990) was a best seller and caused the development of competing space combat games, such as LucasArts' X-Wing. Wing Commander eventually became a media franchise consisting of space combat simulation video games, an animated television series, a feature film, a collectible card game, a series of novels, and action figures. Game designer Chris Crawford said in an interview that Wing Commander \\"raised the bar for the whole industry\\", as the game was five times more expensive to create than most of its contemporaries. Because the game was highly successful, other publishers had to match its production value in order to compete. This forced a large portion of the video game industry to become more conservative, as big-budget games need to be an assured hit for it to be profitable in any way. Crawford opined that Wing Commander in particular affected the marketing and economics of computer games and reestablished the \\"action game\\" as the most lucrative type of computer game. =Decline= Vega Strike, a space flight simulator game: a Llama class ship docks on a mine base (2008) The seeming decline of the space flight simulators and games in the late 1990s also coincided with the rise of the RTS, FPS and RPG game genres, with such examples as Warcraft, Doom and Diablo. The very things that made these games classics, such as their open-endedness, complex control systems and attention to detail, have been cited as reasons for their decline. It was believed that no major new space sim series would be produced as long as the genre relied on complex control systems such as the keyboard and joystick. There were outliers, however, such as the X series (1999‚Äì2016) and Eve Online. =Resurgence= Crowdfunding has been a good source for space sims in recent years, however. In November 2012 Star Citizen set a new record, managing to raise more than $114 million as of May 2016, and is still under development. Elite: Dangerous was also successfully crowdfunded on Kickstarter in November and December 2012. The game was completed and released in 2014, and expansions are being released in stages, or \\"seasons\\". Born Ready Games also closed a successful Kickstarter campaign at the end of 2012, having raised nearly $180,000 to assist with the completion of Strike Suit Zero. The game was completed and released in January 2013. Lastly, the non-linear roguelike-like space shooter Everspace garnered almost $250,000 dollars on Kickstarter, was released in May 2017. On March 10, 2013, the space flight simulator Kerbal Space Program reached the top 5 best selling games after its release on Steam. No Man's Sky (2016) is another self-published, open-ended space sim (though this one was not crowdfunded). According to the developers, through procedural generation the game is able to produce more than 18 quintillion ( or 18,000,000,000,000,000) planets for players to explore. However, several critics found that the nature of the game can become repetitive and monotonous, with the survival gameplay elements being lackluster and tedious. As summarized by Jake Swearingen in New York, \\"You can procedurally generate 18.6 quintillion unique planets, but you can't procedurally generate 18.6 quintillion unique things to do.\\" Further, there was considerable disappointment upon its release among players, as players felt betrayed by dishonest marketing practices. The open source community has also been active, with projects such as FS2 Open and Vega Strike serving as platforms for non-professional efforts. Unofficial remakes of Elite and Privateer are being developed using the Vega Strike engine, and the latter has reached the stage where it is offered as a working title to the public. In 2013 a hobbyist space flight simulator project was realized under usage of the open source Pioneer software.

The Triumphal Arch (also known as the Arch of Maximilian I, ) is a 16th-century monumental woodcut print, commissioned by the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I. The composite image was printed on 36 large sheets of paper from 195 separate wood blocks. At , it is one of the largest prints ever produced, and was intended to be pasted to walls in city halls or the palaces of princes.Bartrum, (1995), 51 It is part of a series of three huge prints created for Maximilian, the others being a Triumphal Procession (1516‚Äì18, 137 woodcut panels, long) which is led by a Large Triumphal Carriage (1522, 8 woodcut panels, ); only the Arch was completed in Maximilian's lifetime and distributed as propaganda, as he intended. Together, this series has been described by art historian Hyatt Mayor as \\"Maximilian's program of paper grandeur\\". They stand alongside two published biographical allegories in verse, the ' and ', heavily illustrated with woodcuts. Very large multi-sheet prints designed to decorate walls were a feature of the early 16th century, although their use in this way means their survival rate is exceptionally low. The prints were intended to be hand-coloured, but only two sets of impressions from the first edition survive with contemporary colouring (held in Berlin and Prague).Bartrum, (2002), 138 Design and execution The architectural form of the arch was designed by Tyrolean architect and court painter J√∂rg K√∂lderer, and elaborated by Maximilian's court historian and mathematician Johannes Stabius, modelled on the triumphal arches constructed by Roman Emperors in Ancient Rome (although Maximilian's arch was never intended to be constructed in stone). It may have been inspired by a six-panel woodcut View of Venice, a bird's-eye view of Venice designed by Jacopo de' Barbari and published by the Nuremberg publisher Anton Kolb, both of whom entered the employ of Maximilian from about 1500. Detailed drawings for the woodcuts were created between 1512 and 1515, mainly by Albrecht D√ºrer and his pupils, Hans Springinklee and Wolf Traut; the flanking round towers are attributed to Albrecht Altdorfer. The design includes three arches: the central arch is entitled \\"Honour and Might\\", the left arch is \\"Praise\\", and the right arch is \\"Nobility\\". Each arch is illustrated with scenes relating to Maximilian, including a family tree above the central arch which leads back to Clovis I, first King of the Franks, and then the mythical Francia, Sicambria and Troia, flanked by heraldic escutcheons, and 12 historical scenes above each of the two side arches. To the left are busts of emperors and kings, including Julius Caesar and Alexander the Great, and to the right are Maximilian's ancestors. Towers to each side show scenes from Maximilian's private life. Towards the lower right is a line of three shields showing the coats of arms of Stabius, K√∂lderer and D√ºrer. Many panels contain a descriptive text, and a long inscription at the bottom describes the whole. The design includes elements of Egyptian hieroglyphs, influenced by Willibald Pirckheimer's 1514 translation of the Hieroglyphica by Roman author Horapollo. Distribution detail The print is dated 1515 on two blocks, indicating when the designs were completed (save for the 24th historical block ‚Äì intended to show Maximilian's tomb ‚Äì which remained blank). The wood blocks were cut from 1515 to 1517 by Hieronymus Andreae of Nuremberg, no doubt with workshop assistance. About 700 sets of impressions were printed in a first edition in 1517-18, and given by Maximilian as gifts, mostly to the cities and princes of the Holy Roman Empire. Examples of the first edition include those in the print rooms at the British Museum, the Albertina in Vienna, and museums in Berlin, Copenhagen, Prague, and elsewhere. A second edition of about 300 was authorised by Archduke Ferdinand (Maximilian's grandson and later Holy Roman Emperor) in 1526‚Äì28, and a third edition by Archduke Charles (Ferdinand's son) in 1559. Separate editions of just the scenes from Maximilian's life were printed, the first in 1520 just after his death. A separate print of the tomb, itself another major piece of Habsburg propagandizing, was created, to be pasted over the empty 24th historical panel. A fourth edition was published by Adam Bartsch in Vienna in 1799, with many of the block showing considerable wear - several missing blocks were replaced by etchings by Bartsch (including the Battle of Utrecht, Maximilian's coronation, and the First Congress of Vienna; the 24th panel shows a new image of the Battle of Pavia). A fifth edition followed in 1886. 171 of the 195 original wood blocks survive, and are held by the Albertina, Vienna.Bartrum, (1995), 53 References Notes Bibliography * Bartrum, Giulia, German Renaissance Prints, 1490‚Äì1550, British Museum Press, 1995, * Bartrum, Giulia, Albrecht D√ºrer and his Legacy, British Museum Press, 2002, * Kurth, Willi & C.

Serious disorder was allegedly sparked by the failure of a big screen erected in Piccadilly Gardens to transmit the match to thousands of Rangers fans who had travelled to the city without tickets. Greater Manchester Police reported that only \\"a minority of thugs\\" among the 150,000 visiting Rangers fans were involved in the violence; while Detective Superintendent Geoff Wessell, of Greater Manchester Police, stressed that a \\"very, very low proportion\\" of the travelling Rangers fans had been involved in disorder. In addition to property damage, fifteen policemen were injured and ambulance crews attended 52 cases of assault. A Manchester City Council inquiry into the events estimated that over 150,000 Rangers fans visited Manchester for the match, with 39 fans were arrested for a range of offences across the city, while 38 complaints were received about the conduct of Greater Manchester Police officers. The report concluded that the 37,000 Rangers fans inside the City of Manchester Stadium were well behaved. Early scuffles One early incident occurred when fighting between rival fans broke out in a pub, resulting in its closure. The evening before the match, someone had set off fire alarms in the city, a criminal offence. An official report found that missile-throwing and fighting by Rangers fans occurred as long as eight hours before the match began. Around late afternoon the Piccadilly fans zone's gates were forced. Large numbers of fans were jumping upon the roofs of sales units and urinating. The sales units were \\"overrun\\" and frightened staff had to flee. Police were called but were powerless in the face of the large number of supporters.  Screen failure  Rangers fans in the Zenit fanzone, in Piccadilly Gardens. Serious civil disorder began when a large screen, erected to broadcast the game at the Zenit fanzone in Piccadilly Gardens, failed. Chris Burrows, chair of the Manchester Police Federation, claimed the screen was deliberately switched off. The technicians who were brought in to try to rectify the fault were attacked with bottles and had to withdraw. Rangers fans then tore down railings, fighting amongst themselves, as the riot police arrived en masse. Several hundred people became directly involved in disorder and \\"considerable violence\\" was directed at the police. Thirty-nine police officers were injured, including one incident in which hundreds of fans isolated and attacked a riot officer. PC Paul Ritchie received a High Commendation for saving a police officer knocked to the ground by a bottle thrown by a rioter.Pc commended for saving colleague (From Herald Series) A police dog was injured when it stood on some broken glass. BBC News reported that groups of Rangers supporters had clashed with police in the city centre after attacking a bank, bus stops and a sports car which was bounced over the road. Greater Manchester Police reported that \\"a minority of thugs\\" among the 150,000 visiting Rangers fans were involved in the violence. There were reports that a Zenit Saint Petersburg fan was stabbed before the game outside the stadium. However, people detained in connection with the alleged incident were released without charge. Authorities had to draft in hundreds of extra riot police to deal with the rioting. As the riots continued, by 2100 BST, ambulances were no longer being sent into the city centre unless accompanied by a police escort due to concerns about the \\"safety of the crew\\". British Transport Police reported sporadic outbursts of rioting at Piccadilly, Oxford Road and Deansgate railway stations. Reaction Cleanup in Piccadilly Gardens, the day after the disturbance. BBC News interrupted normal programming to broadcast the riots live on television, with ITN's flagship News at Ten programme giving extensive coverage to the riots. Judge Andrew Blake of Manchester Crown Court, when later sentencing twelve people in connection to the disorder, described the riots as \\"the worst night of violence and destruction suffered by Manchester city centre since the Blitz\\". Rangers' chief executive Martin Bain described the scenes as \\"dreadful\\" but claimed that the violent scenes \\"were caused by supporters that don't normally attach themselves to our support\\". He also stated that the club was \\"in general, absolutely delighted with the behaviour of our supporters.\\" The following day the Prime Minister Gordon Brown condemned the rioting as \\"a disgrace\\". Scottish Conservative leader, Annabel Goldie, said she was \\"absolutely appalled\\" by the footage, condemning the behaviour as \\"horrific and inexcusable\\". Stephen Purcell, leader of Glasgow City Council, offered an apology in a Manchester newspaper for 200 hardcore thugs. PC Mick Regan, attacked by a gang of twenty men whilst lying on the ground, described the violence. \\"It was unbelievable when we got there, it was already in motion. It was frightening, on a different scale from any other match I have worked in my 23-year career. It seemed the vast majority were drunk and they just wanted to cause trouble. A lot of the fans were OK and just asking for directions but there was a large hard core ... .I know they will say it's a minority but a few thousand is a big minority.\\" A UEFA spokesman indicated that Rangers were unlikely to face sanctions because the violence did not occur at the City of Manchester Stadium where the match was held. Many Rangers fans criticised the tactics employed by Greater Manchester Police. In particular, the deputy leader of the Scottish Conservatives' Murdo Fraser suggested the problem might have been caused by heavy-handed policing. He later retracted this after police released footage showing the scale of the problems.Brown brands Rangers riot fans 'a disgrace' - The Scotsman There were 63 complaints about police conduct, mainly on the grounds of excessive force. They included one from a 60-year-old man who spent four weeks in hospital after suffering a broken hip and perforated bowel. One fan, James Clark, was charged with rioting, but later cleared of all charges by a court in Manchester. He told STV, \\"I have been through utter hell because of the police. They picked me out of crowd of fans at random, beat me black and blue with their batons and set their dogs on me. Yet they charged me with being violent. You couldn't make it up.\\" The police, however, defended their actions. There was also criticism from supporters regarding the organisation of the event. In response the Leader of Manchester City Council, Sir Richard Leese, said \\"If we are going to put a finger of blame anywhere it has to be with those fans having to take responsibility for their own behaviour.\\" Upon the advice of Greater Manchester Police following the unrest, Manchester United cancelled plans for a public parade to celebrate their 2007‚Äì08 Premier League and UEFA Champions League Double. Arrests and convictions Police lined up in riot gear in Piccadilly Gardens Manchester City Council announced that 39 fans were arrested for various offences. These included Section 18 wounding at the stadium in relation to the Russian man who was allegedly stabbed, public order offences, touting, affray, possession of an offensive weapon, Section 47 assault, common assault, possession of Class A drugs, theft, possession of forged tickets, and a Zenit fan for pitch incursion. The force's Assistant Chief Constable referred to the behaviour of the fans who were involved in trouble as \\"unnecessary and unacceptable\\". An appeal was issued on Crimewatch in January 2009, and published in Rangers' match programme, attempting to trace 49 men in connection with the riots. In August 2009, thirteen suspected football hooligans appeared in Manchester magistrates court charged with violent disorder following the final. In particular, Scott McSeveny was charged with knocking PC John Goodwin unconscious; another fan, Mark Stoddart, was alleged to have assaulted PC Mick Regan.Thirteen in court over riots - Press & Journal Twelve people were convicted of rioting and eleven given prison sentences varying from six months to three and a half years in September 2010. An arrested rioter was found to be a serving Essex police officer who was off duty at the time of the incident. He was charged with violent disorder and was released on bail.  Return to Manchester  Plans by Manchester United to invite Rangers to be the opponents for Gary Neville's testimonial match were reportedly abandoned in April 2010 due to objections from police and the local council over fears of trouble due to remaining bad feeling over the damage caused to Manchester city centre by the riots. Rangers were drawn alongside Manchester United in the same group for the 2010‚Äì11 UEFA Champions League group stage, with the opening game in Manchester on 14 September 2010, with a reverse fixture in Glasgow on 24 November. The draw raised security concerns, in particular regarding the potential for possible reprisals, and the prospect of a large number of ticketless fans arriving in Manchester. United's chief executive David Gill played down the potential for trouble, emphasising instead the connection the two clubs had in both the current club managers in Alex Ferguson of United and Walter Smith of Rangers. The Rangers chief executive Martin Bain also dismissed concerns, highlighting the club's good relations, and prior Champions League meeting in 2003. Prior to kick-off, away supporters were held at Wigan Athletic's DW Stadium, to prevent congregation within Manchester city centre. The match passed with 10 arrests for minor offences, involving five Rangers supporters and five Manchester United fans. The behaviour of Rangers fans was praised by Greater Manchester Police.\\"The night has shown the fans in a really good light.\\" dated 15 September 2010, accessed 21 August 2012 Wigan Athletic's safety officer also commended supporters' behaviour, commenting \\"Rangers fans are welcome here any time in the future, because we had a superb reaction from those who travelled\\".\\"The Rangers fans were absolutely tremendous.\\" dated 15 September 2010, accessed 21 August 2012  See also  * 2000 UEFA Cup Final riots * Football hooliganism * Rangers F.C. in European football * FC Zenit Saint Petersburg in European football  References  Final, riots UEFA Cup Final UEFA Cup Final riots UEFA Cup Final riots UEFA Cup Final riots Category:2008 in Russian football UEFA Cup Final riots UEFA Cup Final riots UEFA Cup Final riots UEFA Cup Final riots UEFA Cup Final riots UEFA Cup Final riots Category:Riots and civil disorder in England Category:FC Zenit Saint Petersburg Category:Sports scandals in Scotland Category:May 2008 events in the United Kingdom ","title":"2008 UEFA Cup Final riots"},{"id":"17431199","text":"Junie 5 is a 1981 solo album recorded by singer/multi-instrumentalist Walter \\"Junie\\" Morrison.

In 1907 he became the first professor of pathology at Oxford University, a position he maintained until 1934, the year he died. During World War I, Dreyer was a consultant to the British Royal Flying Corps. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in May 1921. Dreyer specialized in the fields of bacteriology and virology, performing extensive studies involving vaccines and immunization. He conducted investigations on variations of blood volume among different species, and studied the relationship of blood volume to an animals' surface area and weight. Dreyer is also credited with introducing a modification of the Widal test for diagnosis of typhoid and paratyphoid. He is remembered today for his work in respiratory physiology, that included experiments with oxygen in regards to aviation. During World War I, he developed a device that was capable of administering low oxygen mixtures to test the effects of hypoxia in aviators.

She joined the faculty in the Biology Department at Loyola University Chicago in the Fall 2004.Inside Loyola (News for Faculty and Staff of Loyola University Chicago) June/July 2005. Notedly, in 2001, Cole created a course, Biology through Art, first offered at University of Wisconsin‚ÄìParkside, where students have opportunities to create innovative artworks in a biology laboratory.Cole, Kevin. \\"Art and Science 101, Deconstructing Hunter: Will the Real Bionic Woman Please Stand Up?\\" Dialogue: the art, architecture, and design journal of the Heartland July/August 2003. Currently she teaches this course at Loyola University Chicago. Biology through Art helps students from all disciplines to think outside the box. This course focuses on several areas in the biological sciences from molecular biology to human anatomy. Students view microorganisms; use DNA as an artistic medium, create music based on DNA sequence, and see anatomy as art. Contemporary artists that use biological concepts and biological materials in their art are discussed. Beginning Fall 2008 at Loyola University Chicago, Cole taught a new course she created titled, BioArt: Exploring Living Organisms through Art. The course focuses on art that incorporates living organisms. The course will also look at art that incorporates actual blood as a medium in the art. With her extensive laboratory experience, Cole brings a unique and challenging perspective to the world of biotechnology via art. =Grants and commissions= Cole has received grants from the Chicago Community Arts Assistance Program, the Puffin Foundation and the University of Michigan Life Sciences, Values and Society Program to create art for exhibitions reinterpreting science as art looking at positive aspects of biotechnology. In 2006 the National Institutes of Health commissioned her to create paintings based on cancer genomics and cancer proteomics. =Genetic Revelations and Radioactive Biohazard exhibitions= Cole's exhibition Genetic Revelations was presented at the University of Alabama School of Public Health in Birmingham, Alabama from January to April 2004.Stannard, Jennifer. \\"O'Reilly Art Exhibit Fuses Art and Science.\\" Kaleidoscope 17 February 2004.

Early life and education Joseph Pinckney McCain II was born to John S. McCain Jr. and Roberta McCain on April 26, 1942, in the naval base hospital in New London, Connecticut. His father's perpetual traveling for Navy assignments meant that Joe had attended 17 different schools by the time he completed 9th grade. He entered the United States Naval Academy, but left in 1961 during his first year. Although he had tried to emulate his older brother, father (against his advice), grandfather and forebears, he later said \\"I just didn't like all the formations and inspections and things like that.\\" He then attended the Norfolk Division of the College of William & Mary which became Old Dominion University, where he later said he \\"discovered fraternities and beer and girls.\\" Vietnam era Joe McCain was a member of the United States Navy and in 1965 to 1966 served as an enlisted man aboard the during the Vietnam War. During that conflict and his brother's long time as a prisoner of war, the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, which included Joe, heightened awareness of the POWs' plight. pp. 290‚Äì91. In 1970, McCain sat in a bamboo cage in Los Angeles, eating simulated POW food to dramatize the plight of POWs.The Independent (Long Beach, CA) November 27, 1970. In the same year, he and two other brothers of POWs traveled around the U.S. circulating petitions to be presented to North Vietnamese representatives, and sought the signatures of opponents of the Vietnam War as well as those supporting it.\\"In behalf of POWs, will ask 'doves' to sign petition\\" (Associated Press, December 31, 1970) as printed in Florence (SC) Morning News, December 31, 1970, p. 1. He then helped bring 13 tons of mail to the North Vietnamese delegation at the Paris Peace Talks, demanding humane treatment for the POWs. Career Following Vietnam, McCain tried both journalism and medical school before moving to acting. He worked at the San Diego Union and San Diego Evening Tribune, but got in trouble at one for perpetrating a prank. He subsequently became a dinner theater actor. McCain married around 1998, but divorced in 2008, having no children. His brother John died on August 25, 2018 at the age of 81, and his sister Sandy died on November 6, 2019 at the age of 85. Political involvement =2000 presidential election= McCain was a volunteer manager for his brother's 2000 presidential campaign in his home state of Virginia, making over 100 campaign appearances. He expressed anger at some of the tactics that George W. Bush used in defeating his brother, and said that the Republican Party needed to be reformed. =Possible congressional run= In 2001, Republican Party activists in Northern Virginia tried to recruit McCain to run for the U.S. House of Representatives from Virginia's 8th congressional district against the incumbent Democrat Jim Moran. They believed McCain's personal characteristics, combined with his brother's name and appeal to moderate voters, would allow an effective challenge. McCain declined to run, however, due to the growing Democratic tilt of the district, saying, \\"I don't mind running uphill for anything. But it looked like it was going to be a vertical wall.\\" =Political views= In 2005, McCain was vocal in his reaction to revelations of Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse during the Iraq War, saying \\"To be fighting from supposedly the higher ground, and yet to have allowed this kind of stuff that goes on in Abu Ghraib ‚Äì it destroys the fact we're fighting for the better cause. It's just awful.\\" =2008 presidential election= During his brother's 2008 presidential campaign, McCain acted as a low-key surrogate. He was aware of the past foibles of presidential siblings and offered self-deprecating lines such as, \\"I'm the discount John McCain. They call me McKmart.\\" On October 15, 2008, The Baltimore Sun obtained an e-mail written by McCain with the subject title \\"Shoaling\\" that spoke about his unhappiness with unnamed top campaign officials who \\"control the message\\" of his brother's run for president. McCain also received press coverage for remarks made in early October. In the context of describing his naval service postings in Arlington, Virginia and Alexandria, Virginia, McCain jokingly described northern Virginia as \\"communist country\\", for which he later apologized.

The ship fought at San Juan, Puerto Rico, during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Technical characteristics Isabel II was built at the naval shipyard at Ferrol. Her keel was laid in 1883 and the ship was launched on 19 February 1886. Isabel II was completed in 1888 or 1889. She had one rather tall funnel. She had an iron hull and was rigged as a barque.Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1860‚Äì1905, p. 383 Operational history When the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War began in April 1898, Isabel II was at San Juan, Puerto Rico. The U.S. Navy established a permanent blockade of San Juan on 18 June 1898.Nofi, p. 166 On 22 June 1898, Isabel II, gunboat , and destroyer came out of port to test the blockade, resulting in the Second Battle of San Juan. The auxiliary cruiser moved in, resulting in a short, running gun battle, from which the Spanish quickly broke away. Isabel II and General Concha could go no faster than ; Terror made a torpedo run on St. Paul to cover their retreat, and was badly damaged by gunfire from St. Paul, but all three Spanish ships made it back into port at San Juan. Two men had been killed aboard Terror, the only casualties either side suffered during the battle. On 28 June 1898, Isabel II, General Concha, and gunboat sortied to assist a Spanish blockade runner, the merchant steamer , make it into San Juan's harbor. The three Spanish warships exchanged long-range gunfire with St. Paul, , and the cruiser , with neither side scoring any hits. When it became clear that Antonio Lopez would not be able to get past the Americans, the Spanish warships returned to port, where they spent the rest of the war.

He was shot and killed by the Social Democratic politician Friedrich Adler. Life St√ºrgkh descended from a Styrian noble family (originally from the Bavarian Upper Palatinate region), which had been elevated to the status of Imperial Counts in 1721. He owned large estates in Halbenrain and was elected a member of the Austrian Imperial Council in 1891. From 1909 until 1911 he served as education minister in the cabinets of Richard von Bienerth-Schmerling and Paul Gautsch von Frankenthurn. Gautsch resigned when rising prices led to bloody unrest in Vienna and even a shooting in parliament (the bullets just missed St√ºrgkh), whereafter Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria appointed him Austrian Minister-President (Prime Minister) on 3 November 1911. He went on to rule the Cisleithanian lands autocratically: On 16 March 1914 he used the continuous filibustering in parliament to indefinitely adjourn the convenings of the Imperial Council and to pass laws by emergency decrees. This de facto elimination of the legislature turned out to be fatal in the following July Crisis, when upon the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria the deputies were not able to interact with the government on the way to World War I. St√ºrgkh together with Foreign Minister Leopold Berchtold and Chief-of-Staff Franz Conrad von H√∂tzendorf advocated a preventive strike against Serbia, mainly for internal reasons, in order to defy Pan-Slavism in the Bohemian, Carniolan and Croatian crown lands. After the declaration of war on 28 July, St√ºrgkh implemented a harsh censorship and kept refusing to convoke the parliament. He served as Prime Minister until he was shot and killed by Friedrich Adler, son of the Social Democratic party chairman Victor Adler, while having lunch in the Meissl & Schadn Hotel's dining room. Adler's action was a protest against St√ºrgkh's government without the legislature. Emperor Franz Joseph appointed Ernest von Koerber as St√ºrgkh's successor, one of his last official acts, as he died four weeks later. Adler was sentenced to death, pardoned by Emperor Charles I, and finally amnestied after the war.

(2004). \\"Life, Liberty, and Property Rights,\\" in Bringing Justice to the People: The Story of the Freedom-Based Public Interest Law Movement (Lee Edwards, ed.). Washington, DC: Heritage Books, , p.41-44 PLF was established for the purpose of defending and promoting individual and economic freedom in the courts. To that end, PLF attorneys provide pro bono legal representation to clients, file amicus curiae briefs, and participate in administrative proceedings with the goal of supporting property rights, equality before the law, freedom of speech and association, economic liberty, and separation of powers. They have represented clients in 14 cases before the United States Supreme Court. PLF is a non- profit organization under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. It does not charge for legal services, but instead is funded by donations from individuals (53%), foundations (17%), and associations, small businesses and corporations (17%). Except for court-awarded attorney fees for case victories, the organization receives no money from government. The organization was founded in 1973, making it the first and oldest libertarian public interest law firm.Charles Murray, By the People: Rebuilding Liberty without Permission, page 146.Damon Root, Overruled: The Long War for Control of the U.S. Supreme Court, page 106.  History  Incorporated in Sacramento, California, on March 5, 1973, PLF's original staff was composed mainly of individuals who had been a part of then-Governor Ronald Reagan's welfare reform team. Operating on a proposed budget of $117,000 for the first 10 months of operation, PLF attorneys began litigation activities in June 1973 under the direction of Ronald A. Zumbrun, PLF's first president. Currently, PLF has a staff of over 30 attorneys and four offices across the United States: Sacramento, CA; Arlington, VA; Palm Beach Gardens, FL; and Seattle, WA. Legal areas =Property rights= PLF's property rights cases have focused on regulatory takings and over-reaching environmental regulations. The Foundation's attorneys have successfully argued five takings cases at the United States Supreme Court: Nollan v. California Coastal Commission, Suitum v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, Palazzolo v. Rhode Island, Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Management District, and Knick v. Township of Scott, Pennsylvania. PLF has litigated housing and zoning issues in lower courts. PLF successfully challenged San Francisco's ‚ÄúRelocation Assistance Payment Ordinance,‚Äù which required landlords to pay tenants to regain personal use of their property. PLF has a case pending at the Michigan Supreme Court, challenging a common practice of counties foreclosing properties for unpaid taxes and keeping the surplus home equity. PLF's environmental law litigation has frequently involved challenges to federal regulation of private property under the Clean Water Act or the Endangered Species Act, including five victories at the U.S. Supreme Court. PLF attorneys represented a Minnesota property owner who was denied the right to build on his property in Contoski v. Scarlett, a case that resulted in the removal of the bald eagle from the endangered species list. PLF argued that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service failed to delist the species after it concluded that the bald eagle population had recovered. PLF represented Andy Johnson in a dispute with the Environmental Protection Agency. Johnson built a stock pond on his property in Wyoming to provide water for his cattle. EPA found that he had violated the Clean Water Act, demanded that he remove the pond, and fined him $37,500 per day, eventually resulting in $16 million in fines. Wyoming's senators called the agency's action ‚Äúheavy- handed bureaucracy.‚Äù The case was settled in 2016, with EPA dropping the fines and demands, and Johnson agreeing to plant willow trees to protect the ground from erosion. Johnson's case was highlighted by President Trump when he signed an Executive Order to reduce regulatory agencies' ability to rely on administrative guidance to justify enforcement actions against citizens. PLF represented Uri Rafaeli, a Michigan resident whose property was foreclosed and sold at auction for a property tax debt of $8.41. The county kept the entire proceeds from the auction, over $24,000. PLF appeared before the Michigan Supreme Court to challenge a state law which was aimed at preventing blight but allows counties to keep the entire proceeds from property auctions, even if the amount raised at auction is greater than the amount owed in back taxes. The court ruled in favor of Rafaeli and found the practice illegal under the Michigan Constitution. The practice, which PLF refers to as \\"home equity theft\\", is also legal in other states such as Arizona, Massachusetts, and Montana. PLF plans to work towards removing these laws through the court system or encouraging legislative change. PLF has frequently litigated property disputes along the coast and other shorelines, including several cases challenging actions by the California Coastal Commission. The organization argues there is no conflict between private ownership of shoreline and the public good, because development can increase opportunities to experience the beach and to protect it. = Economic liberty = PLF argues that certain licensing laws and similar regulations violate the individual right to earn a living and result in a loss of jobs and a lower standard of living for Americans. PLF has battled against Certificate of Need (CON) laws in multiple states that require new entrants to a job market to receiver a ‚Äúcertificate of need‚Äù from the government to which businesses currently engaged in the occupation may object to the competition. PLF represented several moving companies challenging their state's CON laws. PLF represented Arty Vogt from Lloyd's Transfer & Storage in a challenge to West Virginia's CON law regulating interstate movers, which required new moving companies in the state to be approved by incumbents. The case concluded in 2017 when the state passed a law effectively repealing the regulation. In 2019, PLF filed suit in Kentucky, challenging the state's CON law regulating non-emergency medical transportation. In 2008, PLF won Merrifield v. Lockyer, a challenge to California licensing of pest control. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that ‚Äúeconomic protectionism for its own sake, regardless of its relation to the common good, cannot be said to be in the furtherance of a legitimate governmental interest.‚Äù =Equality before the law= PLF has participated in cases challenging government-sponsored race and sex preferences, both under the federal Constitution's Equal Protection Clause and state constitutional provisions such as California's Proposition 209 and Washington's Initiative 200. In 2018, PLF filed a number of lawsuits on behalf of boys seeking to compete on high school dance teams. In South Dakota, the South Dakota High School Activities Association changed their regulations to allow boys to compete in competitive dance following PLF's lawsuit. Additionally, the Minnesota State High School League also amended their rules to allow boys in competitive dance following lawsuits filed by PLF on behalf of two male students. In 2019, PLF, representing a group of black and Hispanic parents, filed a federal lawsuit arguing that Connecticut's enrollment standards for its magnet schools are discriminatory. Connecticut caps the enrollment of black and Hispanic students in magnet schools at 75%, while no less than 25% of students can be white or Asian. In 2018, PLF sued New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, challenging his proposed changes to the admissions policies of New York City's specialized high schools. De Blasio proposed expanding the Discovery program, which admits students just under the cutoff for the admissions test, from 6% to 20% of all students accepted, a move which he claimed would increase black and Hispanic diversity in those schools. PLF represents Asian-American parents and advocacy groups who claim that the mayor's plans discriminates against Asian-American students and amounts to unconstitutional racial balancing. = Freedom of speech and association = PLF successfully challenged Minnesota polling place laws that violated voters' right to free speech in Minnesota Voters Alliance v. Mansky. The Supreme Court held 7‚Äì2 in favor of PLF's client, the Minnesota Voters Alliance, finding that the state's restrictions on clothing worn in the polling place were not reasonable and violated the First Amendment. PLF was also instrumental in overturning a Virginia law banning the advertising of happy hours, suing on behalf of restaurateurs who could not advertise drink specials in the state in violation of the First Amendment. Additionally, in Keller v. State Bar of California, PLF successfully curbed the California State Bar's use of compulsory dues to finance political and ideological activities. PLF represents two freelancer groups suing to block the implementation of California AB5, which severely limits the number of pieces freelance writers and photographers may provide to publishers. The lawsuit alleges that the law treats journalists differently than fine artists, grant writers, and marketing representatives. = Separation of powers = PLF has litigated several cases arguing for citizen access to judicial review. In Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency, the Supreme Court held that the Sacketts could go to court to challenge an EPA compliance order.https://www.oyez.org/cases/2011/10-1062 and Charles Murray, By the People: Rebuilding Liberty without Permission, page 170-171. In U.S. Army Corps of Engineers v. Hawkes Co., Inc, the Court held that a jurisdictional determination that the property in question constituted ‚Äúwaters of the United States‚Äù was a final agency action subject to judicial review. In 2017, PLF began studying and commenting on the Congressional Review Act as a tool to eliminate regulations. In 2018, they filed two lawsuits demanding that regulatory agencies follow the CRA and submit their new rules to Congress. In 2018, PLF launched a campaign to end the unconstitutional regulatory state through litigation, legislation, and executive action, focusing on restoring an original understanding of the separation of powers. PLF launched a legal challenge of FDA's Deeming Rule, arguing that it was signed by a career civil servant, rather than an officer of the United States as required by the appointments clause of the Constitution. In 2019, PLF released a study of 2,952 rules issued by HHS between 2001 and the beginning of the Trump administration which found that 71% were issued unconstitutionally; the majority being signed by career executive employees, not \\"an officer of the United States.\\" The study found that 98% of the FDA's rules issued in that time period were issued by career employees. = Other = In the early 1980s, PLF was lead plaintiff in one of the first known Strategic lawsuit against public participation (SLAPP) suits in the U.S., which attempted to obtain the mailing list of the Abalone Alliance to get the group to pay for the police costs of the largest anti-nuclear civil- disobedience act in U.S. history, at the Diablo Canyon Power Plant. The case was rejected multiple times for PLF's lack of standing, and was eventually dismissed altogether. PLF stated that it did receive funding from utility companies, but would not disclose whether PG&E;, the plant's owner, had contributed. Law school programs =Chapman University= PLF operates a \\"Liberty Clinic\\" at Chapman University's Fowler School of Law, where a PLF attorney supervises a trial-court program as part of the law school's Constitutional Jurisprudence Clinic. Students in the clinic have hands-on roles in on-going court cases and learn how strategic litigation works. =Berkeley Law School= In 2018, PLF began teaching a seminar and field placement at UC Berkeley School of Law on strategic constitutional litigation. The seminar, taught by PLF Executive Vice President and General Counsel John M. Groen, focuses on property rights and economic liberty. In the field placement, students join a PLF litigation team to work on on-going court cases. Supreme Court cases PLF has litigated a number of cases before the United States Supreme Court. Its 12 victories are: * Nollan v. California Coastal Commission (1987): Justice Scalia held, in a 5-4 opinion, that the Coastal Commission could only place conditions on the Nollan's development permit to rebuild their home where those conditions substantially furthered government interests that would justify denial of the permit entirely. Because the Nollan's request to rebuild their home did not further the government's interest in overcoming a perceived ‚Äúpsychological barrier‚Äù to using the beach, the condition was a regulatory taking without compensation, in violation of the Fifth Amendment. *Keller v. State Bar of California (1990): A unanimous Court held that, \\"The State Bar's use of petitioners' compulsory dues to finance political and ideological activities with which petitioners disagree violates their First Amendment right of free speech when such expenditures are not necessarily or reasonably incurred for the purpose of regulating the legal profession or improving the quality of legal services.\\" *Suitum v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (1997): A unanimous Court held that property owners do not have to attempt to sell their transferable development rights before they can claim a regulatory taking of property. *Palazzolo v. Rhode Island (2001): The Court held that property owners may challenge land use restrictions that were enacted before they acquired the property. Justice Kennedy wrote that ‚ÄúFuture generations, too, have a right to challenge unreasonable limitations on the use and value of land.‚Äù *Rapanos v. United States (2006): The Court rejected the Army Corps of Engineers‚Äô broad definition of wetlands subject to federal jurisdiction, but left unanswered the question of whether the phrase \\"waters of the United States\\" in the Clean Water Act includes a wetland that at least occasionally empties into a tributary of a traditionally navigable water. *Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency (2012): Argued by PLF attorney Damien M. Schiff, the case challenged EPA's practice of unilaterally asserting jurisdiction over private property without a hearing and without judicial review. In a unanimous opinion, the Court sided with PLF and the Sacketts, ruling that EPA's compliance orders are subject to immediate judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). *Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Management District (2013): The Court considered the issue of whether the Nollan and Dolan nexus limitation and proportionality test apply to an exaction in the form of a government demand that the permit applicant make off-site improvements; and whether these same Nollan and Dolan doctrines extend to permit exactions, where the permit has been denied due to the applicant's rejection of that exaction. The Supreme Court found in favor of the property owner on June 25, 2013. *U.S. Army Corps of Engineers v. Hawke Co., Inc. (2016): The Court held that the Army Corps of Engineers‚Äô jurisdictional determination that the property in question constituted ‚Äúwater of the United States‚Äù was a final agency action subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). *National Association of Manufacturers v. Department of Defense (2018): The Court unanimously ruled that the EPA cannot shelter its ‚Äúwaters of the United States‚Äù rule from judicial review by arbitrarily limiting where victims can sue. *Minnesota Voters Alliance v. Mansky (2018): The Court ruled that a Minnesota statute prohibiting individuals from wearing political apparel at a polling place violates the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. *Weyerhaeuser Co. v. U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (2018): In this case the government, under the Endangered Species Act, designated private land in Louisiana as a potential ‚Äúcritical habitat‚Äù for the dusky gopher frog, enjoining the plaintiffs' use of the land. However, the dusky gopher frog does not inhabit the land, nor is the land currently suitable for use as its habitat. In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court ruled that it cannot be a critical habitat if it is not a habitat and remanded to the 5th Circuit to determine what is a habitat under the Act. *Knick v. Township of Scott, Pennsylvania, et al (2019): The Court overruled a prior case that required property owners to seek compensation for state and local property takings in state courts first. Instead, the Court allowed such cases to be brought directly to federal court. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote, \\"[f]idelity to the Takings Clause and our cases construing it requires overruling Williamson County and restoring takings claims to the full-fledged constitutional status the Framers envisioned when they included the Clause among the other protections in the Bill of Rights.\\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-647_m648.pdf At the California Supreme Court, PLF principal attorney Sharon L. Browne won two significant victories upholding the constitutionality of Proposition 209.See Hi-Voltage Wire Works v.

Marins is also known by his alter ego Z√© do Caix√£o (in English, Coffin Joe). The film features Coffin Joe as the main character, although it is not part of the \\"Coffin Joe trilogy\\" (At Midnight I'll Take Your Soul, This Night I Will Possess Your Corpse, and Embodiment of Evil). Plot The film opens with a surreal sequence of dancing women, monkey-like figures fearing lightning, and native Brazilian drummers. An old man begins chanting over a closed coffin. The coffin opens and a man rises. He appears with a top hat, cape, and long fingernails. In an isolated inn called \\"Hospedaria dos Prazeres\\" (Hostel of Pleasures), the mysterious proprietor advertises for employees to serve his guests while they stay the night of a tempestuous storm. As the storm gathers and night falls, various people begin to show up. The proprietor (Marins) allows some to stay while informing others that there are no vacancies, to their obvious displeasure because of the severity of the storm. A wealthy patron who is turned away vows to get the police. The guest book is already filled with the names of the permitted guests before they arrive; they include a group of drunken and promiscuous bohemian motorcyclists, an adulterous couple, a suicidal man, an amorous couple, a group of thieves who just finished a robbery, and some gambling businessmen preparing a deal to bankrupt a competitor. The number of guests is twelve. As the night passes, the guests continue with their assorted activities. In the early morning, they all notice that their watches all display midnight and wonder how time has stopped. When they question the proprietor, they are all presented with gruesome scenes of their dead bodies, revealing that their deaths occurred prior to midnight in the storm. The motorcyclists are shown as dead and mutilated victims of a massive drunk-driving accident. The thieves are shown shot dead by police after the robbery. The corrupt businessmen are charred victims of arson. The proprietor informs them that the clocks all turning to midnight was part of their eternal torment, as the absence of time is one of the key aspects of their punishment. The proprietor then warns the guest not to anger him, as it would unleash his dark side (the Coffin Joe-esque figure scene at the start of the film). The scene switches to daytime, and the wealthy man returns to the site of the hostel with the police. Rather than the hostel, there is a cemetery with a funeral in progress. Laughing off the incident as confusion, the man and police leave. The coffin is the same from which the hostel proprietor rises at the beginning of the film. The movie itself ends with the proprietor walking in the graveyard. He ultimately turns to the camera as the image shifts quickly to a skull wearing the same hat as the proprietor. As blood flows from the empty eye sockets, the film ends.

It was first published in 1897. The book contains a minimal amount of plot; Bellamy primarily used Equality to expand on the theories he first explored in Looking Backward. The text is now in the public domain and available for free.https://www.amazon.com/Equality-Julian-West- ebook/dp/B0084AL124/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital- text&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1369169084&sr;=1-1&keywords;=equality Synopsis The story takes up immediately after the events of Looking Backward with the main characters from the first novel, Julian West, Doctor Leete, and his daughter Edith. West tells his nightmare of return to the 19th century to Edith, who is sympathetic. West's citizenship in the new America is recognized, and he goes to the bank to obtain his own account, or \\"credit card,\\" from which he can draw his equal share of the national product. He learns that Edith and her mother do not normally wear the long skirts he has seen them in (they had been wearing them so as not to offend his 19th century sensibilities): when Julian tells Edith that he would not be shocked to see them dressed in the modern fashion, Edith immediately runs into the house and comes out dressed in a pants suit. Clothing has revolutionised and is now made of strengthened paper, recycled when dirty, and replaced at very little cost (shoes and dishes are made of variations on the same substance). Julian learns that women are free to compete in many of the same trades as men; the manager of the paper factory he visits with Edith is a woman. Edith herself is in the second year of the three year general labor period required of everyone before choosing a trade, but has taken leave to spend time with Julian. The two tour a tenement house, in which no one now lives, kept as a reminder of the evils of private capitalism. Julian opens his safe (a device unknown in 2000 outside museums). Dr. Leete sees his mortgages and securities not as long-obsolete claims to ownership interest in things, but rather in people and their labor. The papers are worthless except as antiques, as most papers of the sort were burned at the conclusion of the economic transition, in a great blaze on the former site of the New York Stock Exchange. The gold coins in the safe are admired for their prettiness, but are also worthless. Julian learns more about the world of the year 2000. Handwriting has been virtually replaced by phonograph records, and jewelry is no longer used, since jewels are now worthless. Julian is amazed by a television-like device, called the electroscope. World communication is simplified, since everyone now speaks a universal language in addition to their native tongue. Not only are there motor cars, but also private air cars. Everyone is now vegetarian, and the thought of eating meat is looked upon with revulsion. The book concludes with an almost uninterrupted series of lectures from Dr. Leete and other characters, mostly concerning how the idyllic state in which West has arrived was achieved. Important quotes Power *\\"Government is actually now what it nominally was in the America of your day--the servant, tool, and instrument by which the people give effect to their will, itself being without will.\\" *\\"Power over others is necessarily demoralizing to the master and degrading to the subject.\\" *\\"It was not till the kings had been shorn of power and the interregnum of sham democracy had set in, leaving no virile force in the state or the world to resist the money power, that the opportunity for a world-wide plutocratic despotism arrived.\\" *\\"Put workingmen in the places of the capitalists and they would have done just as the capitalists were doing. In fact, whenever workingmen did become capitalists they were commonly said to make the hardest sort of masters.\\" Wage slavery *\\"The slave received subsistence--clothing and shelter--and the wage- earner who could get more than these out of his wages was rarely fortunate. The rate of wages, except in new countries and under special conditions and for skilled workers, kept at about the subsistence point, quite as often dropping below as rising above. The main difference was that the master expended the subsistence wage of the chattel slave for him while the earner expended it for himself.\\" Distribution of labor *\\"...the theory that a person has a right in dealing with his fellows to take advantage of his superior abilities is nothing other than a slightly more roundabout expression of the doctrine that might is right.\\" *\\"Even the worker of special ability, who might hope to gain most by it, could not hope to gain so much as he would lose in common with others by sacrificing the increased efficiency of the industrial machinery that would result from the sentiment of solidarity and public spirit among the workers arising from a feeling of complete unity of interest.\\" *\\"For the reason that there was no fair play or suggestion of justice in the distribution of work, everybody shirked it who could, and those who could not shirk it cursed the luckier ones and got even by doing as bad work as they could. Suppose a rich young fellow like myself had a feeling that he would like to do his part. How was he going to go about it? There was absolutely no social organization by which labor could be shared on any principle of justice. There was no possibility of co-operation. We had to choose between taking advantage of the economic system to live on other people or have them take advantage of it to live on us...There being no more moral satisfaction in the one alternative than the other, we naturally preferred the first. By glimpses all the more decent of us realized the ineffable meanness of sponging our living out of the toilers, but our consciences were completely bedeviled by an economic system which seemed a hopeless muddle that nobody could see through or set right or do right under.\\" Property *\\"If you own the things men must have, you own the men who must have them.\\" *\\"...the old so-called ethics of property absolutely overlooked the whole ethical side of the subject-- namely, its bearing on human relations.\\" *\\"The Revolution, that is to say, instead of denying or abolishing the institution of private property, affirmed it in an incomparably more positive, beneficial, permanent, and general form than had ever been known before.\\" *\\"The principle of inheritance, the backbone of the whole property system, at the first challenge of serious criticism abandoned all ethical defense and shriveled into a mere convention established by law...\\" Old economics *\\"Their maxim that demand governed supply, and supply would always meet demand, referred in no way to the demand representing human need, but wholly to an artificial thing called the market, itself the product of the profit system.\\" *\\"To have criticised the profit system would have been flat blasphemy. The learned men called it a problem--the problem of the unemployed--and gave it up as a conundrum. It was a favorite way our ancestors had of dodging questions which they could not answer without attacking vested interests to call them problems and give them up as insolvable mysteries of Divine Providence.\\" Private capitalism *\\"...the profit system, by its necessary nature, operated to stop limit and cripple production at the point where it began to be efficient.\\" *\\"The whole acknowledged art of wealth-making on a large scale consisted in devices for getting possession of other people's product without too open breach of the law.\\" *\\"A vast army of laborers was constantly engaged in manufacturing an infinite variety of articles and appliances of elegance and ostentation which mocked the unsatisfied primary necessities of those who toiled to produce them.\\" *\\"The A B C of any science of wealth production is the necessity of co-ordination and concert of effort; whereas competition, conflict, and endless cross-purposes were the sum and substance of the economic methods set forth by these writers.\\" *\\"...under competition there was no free play whatever allowed for the capitalist's better feelings even if he had any. He could not be better than the system. If he tried to be, the system would crush him.\\" *\\"No inventor could introduce an invention, however excellent, unless he could get capitalists to take it up, and this usually they would not do unless the inventor relinquished to them most of his hopes of profit from the discovery.\\" *\\"...when any new idea was suggested in religion, in medicine, in science, in economics, in sociology, and indeed in almost any field of thought, the first question which the learned body having charge of that field and making a living out of it would ask itself was not whether the idea was good and true and would tend to the general welfare, but how it would immediately and directly affect the set of doctrines, traditions, and institutions, with the prestige of which their own personal interests were identified.\\" New economics *\\"You see economic science in your day was a science of things; in our day it is a science of human beings.\\" *\\"Would it not have startled the old economists to hear that the secret of the most efficient system of wealth production was conformity on a national scale to the ethical idea of equal treatment for all embodied by Jesus Christ in the golden rule?\\" *\\"Any economic proposition which can not be stated in ethical terms is false. Nothing can be in the long run or on a large scale sound economics which is not sound ethics. It is not, therefore, a mere coincidence, but a logical necessity, that the supreme word of both ethics and economics should be one and the same--equality. The golden rule in its social application is as truly the secret of plenty as of peace.\\" *\\"If, indeed, [society] had but substituted this collective economic organization for the criminal and judicial system it presently would have had as little need of the latter as we do, for most of the crimes that plagued you were direct or indirect consequences of your unjust economic conditions, and would have disappeared with them.\\" *\\"Truly, it is these secondary consequences, these moral and social reactions of economic equality to create a noble atmosphere of human intercourse, that, after all, have been the greatest contribution which the principle has made to human happiness.\\" *\\"Our economic system puts us in a position where we can follow Christ's maxim, so impossible for you, to 'take no thought for the morrow.'\\" Aesthetics *\\"The aesthetic equivalent of the moral wrong of inequality was the artistic abomination of uniformity. On the other hand, equality creates an atmosphere which kills imitation, and is pregnant with originality, for every one acts out himself, having nothing to gain by imitating any one else.\\" *\\"As to the pretension of civilized persons to admire gems or gold for their intrinsic beauty apart from their value, I suspect that was a more or less unconscious sham.\\" Youth *\\"Youth is visited with noble aspirations and high dreams of duty and perfection. It sees the world as it should be, not as it is; and it is well for the race if the institutions of society are such as do not offend these moral enthusiasms, but rather tend to conserve and develop them through life.\\" *\\"Youth was as noble in your day as now, and dreamed the same great dreams of life's possibilities. But when the young man went forth into the world of practical life it was to find his dreams mocked and his ideals derided at every turn. He found himself compelled, whether he would or not, to take part in a fight for life, in which the first condition of success was to put his ethics on the shelf and cut the acquaintance of his conscience. You had various terms with which to describe the process whereby the young man, reluctantly laying aside his ideals, accepted the conditions of the sordid struggle. You described it as a 'learning to take the world as it is,' 'getting over romantic notions,' 'becoming practical,' and all that. In fact, it was nothing more nor less than the debauching of a soul.\\" Religion *\\"...with a high grade of intelligence become universal the world was bound to outgrow the ceremonial side of religion, which with its forms and symbols, its holy times and places, its sacrifices, feasts, fasts, and new moons, meant so much in the child-time of the race. The time has now fully come which Christ foretold in that talk with the woman by the well of Samaria when the idea of the Temple and all it stood for would give place to the wholly spiritual religion, without respect of times or places, which he declared most pleasing to God.\\" *\\"But there was a minority of the cultured. Were they bigoted also? Were they tools of ecclesiastics?\\" \\"On the contrary, they always held a calm and tolerant attitude on religious questions and were independent of the priesthoods. If they deferred to ecclesiastical influence at all, it was because they held it needful for the purpose of controlling the ignorant populace.\\" *\\"Though the state will enforce no private contracts of any sort, it does not forbid them.\\" *\\"Not only were women the chief attendants at religious functions, but it was largely through their influence on the men that the latter tolerated, even so far as they did, the ecclesiastical pretensions...Less educated, as a rule, than men, unaccustomed to responsibility, and trained in habits of subordination and self-distrust, they leaned in all things upon precedent and authority. Naturally, therefore, they still held to the principle of authoritative teaching in religion long after men had generally rejected it.\\" Reaction As might be expected given the success of Looking Backward, Equality was highly anticipated. A large first edition was ordered by the publishers. In spite of this, the first edition entirely sold out within 36 hours of publication.New York Times articles from July 3, 1897 Ripley Hitchcock, who was affiliated with Bellamy's publishers, explained the thematic distinction between Looking Backward and Equality as the latter \\"explain[s] not only [the institutions of Bellamy's future's] righteousness and reason, but likewise the course of historical evolution by which they were born out of the very different order of things existing to-day\\".New York Times article from May 28, 1898 Reaction to Equality was generally not good. Nicholas P. Gilman provides a common criticism for the work in his review for the Quarterly Journal of Economics. Written in 1897, Gilman explains, \\"Mr. Bellamy has apparently abandoned fiction, and has at length broken the silence of several years with a volume which is neither novel nor a treatise on socialism in scientific form, but a prolonged reduplication of the monologues of Dr. Leete, the part of Looking Backward which has the least interest for most of its readers\\".Gilman, Nicholas P. \\"Bellamy's \\"Equality.\\"\\", The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. 12, No. 1 (October, 1897), pp. 76. Published by: The MIT Press. On the other hand, John Dewey (who called Bellamy \\"a great American prophet\\") preferred Equality, considering it to be \\"more populist and democratic\\" than the \\"more popular and authoritarian\\" Looking Backward.Westbrook, R.B., John Dewey and American Democracy, (Cornell University Press, 1993), p. 454 Peter Kropotkin also received the book more favourably, arguing that it was superior to Looking Backward because Bellamy had removed the authoritarian aspects. Kropotkin claimed that these elements did not fit the character of the former work in any case, and stated that he believed that if someone suitable could have conversed with Bellamy, they could have convinced him to declare for anarchism.Rosemont, F. in Patai, D.

He was created and drawn by Spain Rodriguez.Rodriguez, Spain. Trashman Lives! (Fanatagraphics Books, 1997), p. iv.  Publication history  Trashman's first appearance was as a full-page serial comic strip in the New York City underground newspaper the East Village Other. After moving from New York City to San Francisco in 1970, Spain's Subvert Comics series (1970‚Äì1976)Issues #1‚Äì2 were published in 1970 and 1972 by Rip Off Press; issue #3 was published by Saving Grace, a Division of Keith Green Industrial Realities in 1976. featured \\"three full length Trashman: Agent of the Sixth International stories.\\"Trashman Lives, pg. v. Since 1976, Trashman has appeared in such publications as High Times, Heavy Metal, Weirdo, San Francisco magazine, Zap Comix #11-13, and the Fantagraphics anthology Zero Zero #2. Fictional character biography Trashman is a hero of the working classes and a champion of the radical left causes. The Trashman stories are set in a dystopian near-future America, which after having been ravaged by nuclear weapon attacks, has become a fascist police state, with \\"vast urban conglomerations. Social ferment [has] divided the land into a patchwork of virtually self-governing areas.\\"Subvert Comics, Vol, 1, No. 1 Mild-mannered auto mechanic Harry Barnes turned to a life of petty crime after finding his wife murdered in their home by Gestapo-like soldiers. As Barnes flees capture by the police, a mysterious stranger in a hooded robe calling himself \\"Citizen X\\" appears and leads him down a hidden passageway to a secret underground installation. There, Barnes is told he was chosen by the mysterious and elusive \\"Sixth International\\", an underground anarcho-Marxist organization, to be trained as a master of the \\"para-sciences\\" and to use these powers to fight the oppression of the fascist governments of the world. Trashman is typically cast as the defender of the working-class masses against the tyranny of fascist police/military forces, agents of governmental oppression, and the plots of the rich and powerful to oppress the common people. He is depicted as a strong, rugged, black-clad militant figure, with dark hair and beard and eyes always in shadow, who wields conventional military weapons such as machine guns, pistols, daggers and explosives in addition to his super powers. Super powers \\"Harry Barnes, known to the world as Trashman, trained by the elusive Sixth International as a master of the para-sciences, is able to change his molecular structure or decipher a crack in the sidewalk.\\" (quote from Trashman's first comic strip in the East Village Other.) Trashman's powers include superhuman strength, stamina, speed, agility, reflexes, equilibrium and durability. He is not invulnerable to harm, but his powers usually enable him to avoid being wounded or killed by conventional weapons. He also has the ability to \\"shape-shift\\", or alter his shape and molecular structure to any desired form, including non-organic ones. (For example, he once shifted himself into the shape of a copy of the East Village Other.) He retains his mental abilities even while shifted, and can change back to human form at will. Trashman also has a power called the \\"Random Alert Factor\\", based on the fictional \\"science of numantics.\\" One of the principles of numantics, according to Trashman's Professor of Numantics Dr. Eugene Kranker, is that \\"from observing random phenomena, a general pattern may be deduced.\\" Trashman is tuned into this mode of perception, giving him a synchronicity-based precognition/clairvoyance, of seemingly unrelated information by making observations of random (complex) phenomena. For example, on the inside back cover artwork of Subvert Comics #1, Trashman \\"hears\\" a crack in the sidewalk \\"speak\\" to him, warning him of an attack from behind. Strangely, Trashman's powers are diminished when he is exposed to an atmosphere lacking in a certain level of pollution.Trashman Lives!, pg. 35. Cultural influence The Trashman series is one of the very few superhero stories depicted in the underground comix of the 1960s and 1970s, particularly as a recurring character. Trashman's post-apocalyptic setting and Marxist- anarchist overtones expressed Spain's own social and political beliefs, as well as the sensibilities of the anti-Vietnam War movement and the underground counterculture of the era.My True Story (1994) Like many underground comix, the Trashman stories are replete with graphic depictions of violence, sex and profanity, which were all but unknown in superhero comics of the past. There are also many times that the characters break the \\"fourth wall\\" boundary between the fiction and the reader, typical of post-modern art. In one exchange with another character, Trashman \\"admits\\" he is a comic book character: \\"You heard Dr. Kranker. It was all figured out thru numantics. It's just odds and fixed points and all that stuff.\\" \\"Fuck you! Do you expect me to believe that shit?\\" \\"Shhh! Don't blow it man. There's all those readers out there watching.\\"Subvert Comics, vol. 1, No. 3 The style and setting of the Trashman comics are similar to many of the post-apocalyptic graphic novels and films that followed it years later, such as the Blade Runner and Mad Max films, the Dark Knight series of Batman graphic novels, and the V for Vendetta graphic novel and film. In an interview with John Ascher, Spain claims no direct influence on these later works, but concedes, \\"These ideas are out there. The artist pursues a cultural thread, and there are other people pursuing that cultural thread as well, so you exchange these ideas, they‚Äôre thrown back and forth, amplified, then the cultural thread goes underground, then it pops up again, often.\\" Notes References *Spain Rodriguez: My True Story, Fantagraphics Books (Seattle), 1994. *Spain Rodriguez: Trashman Lives!, Fanatagraphics Books (Seattle), 1997.

This temple, which is in a dilapidated state, is in the historically important town of Balligavi (also called Balagamve), modern Shivamogga district, Karnataka state, India. The exterior walls of the temple have erotic sculptures on friezes. These depictions are considered rare in Chalukyan art. Being miniature in size, these are visible only upon close examination.Cousens (1926), p. 107 During medieval times, Balligavi was a seat of learning to multiple religious faiths and was home to many monuments and structures built by the Chalukyas. More than 80 medieval inscriptions have been discovered in Balligavi and belong to the Shaiva, Vaishnava, Jain and Buddhist faiths. These inscriptions describe, among other things, the building of temples.Cousens (1926), p. 108 Other sculptures Kamasutra art sculpture Kamasutra (erotica) art, 1070 CE, Tripurantaka Temple, Shimoga district This temple is noted for its decorative windows and screens which consist of very intricate perforated stone work. The two sides of the doorway to the shrine have a window panels, each filled entirely by three pairs of nƒÅga figures (snake). The long intertwined and knotted bodies of these nagas create a virtual mesh to fill up the panels.Cousens (1927), p. 106 Above the entrance to the shrine is a decorative architrave with sculptures of the Hindu Gods Brahma, Shiva and Vishnu, with Shiva being depicted in his Bhairava form. Other figures here are the dikpalas (the guardians). Some interesting larger sized figure sculptures exist, such as the sculpture of a Hoysala king slaying a lion. This piece of sculpture comes with its own inscription and depicts a hunting expedition in which the king, in the company of his hunting dogs, speared and killed a wild boar. Also depicted is the king on foot, fighting a lion which sprang out of the forest.Cousens (1926), p. 107 Ganda-Bherunda (Two headed mythical bird) at town centre in Balligavi An interesting piece of sculpture near the temple in the town centre is the Ganda-Bherunda Stambha (\\"column of two-headed bird\\"). The column on which the sculpture stands is about tall and the shaft is about in diameter. The top of the column has an octagonal capital surmounted by a broad slab of stone. Upon this is mounted the statue of the mythical two- headed bird Ganda-Bherunda, which, according to legend was an enemy of elephants and fed on their flesh.Cousens (1926), p. 146 The statue has the body of a human standing upright with two bird like heads, looking in opposite directions. In its hands, it holds the prey that it feeds on. An inscription at the base of the column describes its erection in 1047 CE by Chamundaraya Arasa of the Kadamba Dynasty of Banavasi. Legend has it that the column may have been erected to scare away marauding elephants from local plantations.

Beaudry served as mayor of Montreal three times, from 1862 to 1866, from 1877 to 1879, and from 1881 to 1885 for a total time served as mayor of ten years. Early life Born in Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines, Quebec, he was raised and worked on the family farm. After working as a clerk and shopkeeper, Beaudry opened a dry goods store with his brother in 1834. Beaudry became increasingly politically active. In 1827 he signed a petition in opposition to the proposed union of the upper and lower Canadas. In 1837 he became one of the vice presidents of the Soci√©t√© des Fils de la Libert√©. When the Rebellions of 1837 occurred, Beaudry fled temporarily to the United States. He returned in June 1838 and resumed his business dealings which flourished. Political career Having established himself as a successful businessman, in 1860 Beaudry ran and was elected councillor. In 1862 he ran for mayor of Montreal and won. He was easily re-elected through 1885. He declined to run for a couple of years, but ran again in 1868 against William Workman. During the campaign Beaudry turned off voters with religious and negative overtones. Beaudry did not run for mayor again until 1877, where he won, and again in 1878. However, in 1879 he lost in a fierce campaign against S√©v√®re Rivard. Beaudry was once again re-elected from 1881 through 1885. His younger brother Prudent Beaudry was mayor of Los Angeles (1874‚Äì1876). He was a member of the Legislative Council of Quebec from 1867 until his death in 1886. He was buried in the Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery.

The H1 grounds through the metal base itself. =Power and output= Under ECE Regulation 37, which governs automotive filament lamps in most of the world, the H1 lamp's nominal rating is 55 watts at 12 volts, and its test rating is 68W (maximum) and 1550 ¬±15% lumens at 13.2V. R37 also contains provisions for 6-volt, 55-watt and 24-volt, 70-watt H1 lamps. The United States government does not recognise ECE regulations, but rather applies its own regulations. Under these, the H1 is rated 65W (maximum) and 1410 lumens ¬±15% at 12.8V. Despite the two different sets of specified voltages and test protocols, the lamps themselves are the same; with few exceptions, 12-volt H1 lamps are generally manufactured and tested to comply with both regulations. =Colour of light= Under ECE regulations, H1 lamps are required to emit white or selective yellow light. U.S. regulations require H1 lamps to emit white light. Under both ECE and U.S. specifications, the allowable range of white light is quite large; some H1 lamps have a slight blue or yellow tint to the glass yet still produce light legally acceptable under the requirement for white light. Variants =Compliant= Because the light output is specified as a nominal value with a 30% tolerance (¬±15%), H1 lamps may be optimised for longer life (with lower flux and luminance), or for higher flux and luminance (with shorter life). A long-life filament is wound on a larger mandrel with a wider pitch ‚Äî the separation distance between adjacent filament coils. This tends to reduce the filament's luminance and the focus of the beam from the headlamp, Opposite alterations are made to create higher-performance lamps; the filament is wound on a smaller mandrel with a tighter pitch. This increases flux and luminance and creates a better-focused beam from the headlamp, but lifespan is reduced. These same changes can be made with different parameters to give output identical to a standard bulb, but with lower power consumption. =Noncompliant= Lamps are available that conform to the physical specifications for H1, but not to the regulated specifications for power consumption, light output, and/or light colour. These include high-wattage lamps, and those that emit light of a colour outside the white or selective yellow specification ranges. Such lamps are illegal throughout the industrialised world for use in regulated automotive lighting devices, and so vehicle wiring, switches, and lighting components are generally not designed or built to withstand the higher heat and power consumption from off-spec lamps. Lamps with higher-than-specified output can also create unsafe levels of glare. There is considerable variability by jurisdiction in the regulation of off-road applications of lamp types used in on-road vehicles.

He was the eldest son of the eight surviving children of William Doxford (1812‚Äì1882) and his wife, Hannah n√©e Pile (1814‚Äì1895). He was baptised on 14 March 1841 in St Michaels, Bishopwearmouth (now the Sunderland Minster).FamilySearch International Genealogical Index v5.0 After graduating from Bramham College in the West Riding of Yorkshire in 1857, Doxford began to work at his father's company, William Doxford & Sons, upon its creation in 1858 at its new headquarters at Pallion on the River Wear. Family On 9 April 1863, Doxford married Margaret Wilkinson (1842‚Äì1916), daughter of Richard Wilkinson, a local shipbuilder. They eventually had nine children, six of whom survived to adulthood: *Margaret Eveline (1864‚Äì1960), married John Hunt Hedley (1858‚Äì1914), a valuer. *William Theodore (1866‚Äì1870) *(Albert) Ernest (1867‚Äì1937), a marine engine builder; married Bertha Eleanor Warner (1866‚Äì1949). *Harold (1869‚Äì1869) *Mary Hannah (1870‚Äì1948), married Alfred Octavius Hedley (1861‚Äì1926; brother of the above John Hunt Hedley), a solicitor. *Theodore (1874‚Äì1876) *Norah (1876‚Äì1965), married (Andrew Leyland) Hillyar Cleland (1868‚Äì1943), son of John Cleland of Stormont Castle. *(Annie) Greta (1878‚Äì1968), died unmarried. *(Wilhelmine) Vera (1883‚Äì1955), married Stanley Miller Thompson (1883‚Äì1948), creator of The Silver Line.

It is a satirical movie about the struggle for political and social power. Plot Gordini Malvezzi is a family of the Romagna gentry. The nuclear family is composed of siblings Elena, Vittorio, and Camillo. Countess Elena is an attractive middle-aged woman who plays the part of a matriarch and indulges herself in sexual relationships with common men of the town but avoids further rapport because she is afraid they are just after her money. Count Vittorio is a secularist professor who has pursued fruitless efforts to launch a political career. On the other hand, Camillo is a seventeen-year-old seminary student who is in constant struggle with his aristocratic background and Catholic upbringing and finds a symbolic revolt in adopting a hardline Maoist political line. Vittorio is in love with his accountant-secretary Giovanna but, although sympathetic with him, repelled by Vittorio's meek and impotent attitude, she rejects his advances and runs a relationship with Carlo, the young and ambitious accountant who also happens to be the treasurer of the local Unified Socialist Party branch. Carlo makes a plan to marry into the rich landed gentry through Elena and the party offers Vittorio a candidacy for the local administration elections. When Vittorio eventually drops his restrained support to Camillo's 'organisation' for the sake of his socialist candidacy, Camillo starts to subversively target his brother's campaign.

The violent tornado destroyed most of the town, killing about 34 people‚Äîestimated totals varied‚Äîand injuring at least 70, many severely. This was the deadliest tornado ever to strike the state of Connecticut, and the second deadliest ever in New England, after the Worcester tornado of 1953. Before the storm The storm system that eventually spawned the Wallingford tornado produced damaging winds and at least one tornado far before it reached the town. The first tornado from this storm system touched down in South Kent, unroofing houses, blowing down barns, and uprooting and tossing trees into the air. It moved steadily southeast for , moving just south of New Preston, and then through Washington, before turning north and dissipating. The next path of damage started further north along the Shepaug River. It is unknown whether this was a tornado or straight- line winds, but the damage path continued southeast for three miles before disappearing again. More damage was reported near Waterbury, where a house was unroofed two miles west of the town. In the town itself, branches and chimneys were damaged. As the storm approached Wallingford, observers described a black, rolling funnel, with clouds blowing in from all directions. This system passed directly over Cheshire, producing a strong wind at the surface which caused some minor damage. The storm then moved directly towards Wallingford. The Wallingford tornado Artist's conception of the tornado destroying a house Map of the tornado's path through the town In Wallingford, the day prior to the tornado was clear, and said to be \\"one of the loveliest [days] of the season\\".* At around 5 p.m. the sky began to get dark, and by 5:30 p.m. the air was very black. At around 6 p.m., the air at the surface was calm, but lightning began to fill the sky, and the clouds began moving at a very rapid pace, frightening some residents into shelter. The tornado started at 6:15 p.m. local time as a waterspout over Community Lake, just west of town. It then moved through the center of town along Christian Street, damaging almost every structure as it went. The tornado tore houses from their foundations, throwing some more than 600 feet (180 meters). A receipt from the town was later found 65 miles (105 km) east in Peacedale, Rhode Island. Large trees were uprooted and snapped, and those that were still standing were stripped of small limbs and leaves. The Catholic Church was blown to bits, and heavy tombstones in the nearby cemetery were tossed around. The brand-new brick high school building was almost completely destroyed. The tornado's path through town was only two miles long, but the damage path was up to 600 feet (180 meters) wide. More tornadic damage was reported in southern Durham and Killingworth, with some homes severely damaged, but there were some minor injuries, one young woman in Killingworth was injured by shards of glass from a breaking window. Some sources insist that the Wallingford tornado dissipated a few miles west of the town, and this was an entirely separate tornado, but without a modern damage survey it is impossible to tell. The parent storm finally moved out over the ocean around 8 PM. Aftermath Artist's drawing of damage to the grade school A district schoolhouse was converted into a temporary morgue immediately after the storm; 21 bodies were discovered and placed there that night. One person was found dead 3300 feet (1 km) from where he had been standing. The tornado brought down telegraph lines and poles around the area, so assistance from physicians in nearby towns took more than an hour. More than 50 special police were sworn in to prevent looting, and to control the crowds of curious onlookers who had come by train from surrounding cities. Thirty five homes were completely destroyed, with many more being unroofed or receiving some sort of damage. Damage estimates were around $150,000 from buildings alone; utilities and railway facilities received a lot of damage as well. Final estimates were around $250,000 ($5.3 million when adjusted for inflation). Tornadoes are not very uncommon in the state of Connecticut, but tornadoes of this power are rare. Though tornadoes have only been officially rated on the Fujita scale since 1950, this tornado has been estimated to be of F4-intensity on the scale. This would make it one of only three tornadoes of this intensity to ever affect the state, as of 2008.Tornado Project. \\"Worst\\" Tornadoes Retrieved on July 2, 2007. Thirty-four people were killed by the tornado--thirty-one more than the second-deadliest Connecticut tornado--and 70 others injured. The tornado also devastated a branch of the Oneida Community that had operated in Wallingford from 1851 through 1878.* The subsidiary community closed down and the members consolidated with the main community.

Contact  History  Bersa Thunder Ultra Compact Pro 40 The company was founded in the mid-1950s by Italian immigrants Benso Bonadimani, Ercole Montini and Savino Caselli, all of them mechanical engineers. Montini worked for Beretta in Italy. At the beginning they were producing parts for the now defunct Argentinian arms manufacturer Ballester‚ÄìMolina. Their first handgun was a modified version of a Ballester model which they called \\"Luan\\", combining the first two letters of the last names of the 2 designers of the pistol, Luce and Antonovich. The gun did not have much commercial success and very few of them were produced; nowadays they are quite rare collector's items. In 1959 the first 22 Long Rifle pistol was commercialized, called \\"Modelo 60\\", which later evolved in the \\"Modelo 62\\", and based on a modified Beretta design, it sold extremely well. In 1960 the name \\"Bersa\\" was introduced, taken from the initial letters of the founders' first names. Many more successful models in increasingly more powerful calibers were produced in the following years, making Bersa a well-known and respected name in the firearms world. In 1989 the first full-size combat pistol was introduced, the Model 90, chambered for the 9√ó19mm Parabellum cartridge. In 1994 a new model name for the entire production line was introduced, \\"Thunder\\", followed by a number indicating the handgun caliber. However, the Thunder series in reality includes two totally different designs in mechanics and appearances; for cartridges up to and including the .380 ACP, the handguns are compact in size and based on a blowback system. For more powerful rounds, starting with the 9√ó19mm Parabellum, the Thunder line is based on a locked breech and short-recoil modified Browning design. At the end of the 1990s Bersa won the contract for supplying a new standard sidearm for the Argentine Armed Forces and Argentine Federal Police that were looking to replace their aging Browning Hi-Power pistols. The Bersa Thunder 9, an evolution of the Model 90, was chosen. Bersa rifle, cal. 22 LR Bersa shotguns In the past Bersa also produced .22 Long Rifle caliber long guns and single- and double-barreled shotguns, but they did not have the same commercial success of the pistols, and they have been discontinued. Bersa TPR9 in 9x19 with the threaded barrel. Bersa is currently one of the largest privately owned corporations in Argentina. It produces, among many handguns, the very popular Bersa Thunder 380 and the Bersa Thunder 9 pistols and the Ultra Compact series of the Thunder chambered in 9mm, .40 S&W;, and .45 ACP.  Overview  The compact Thunder 22, 32, and 380 are similar to the Walther PPK, while the full-size Thunder 9, 40, 45 and are somewhat similar in appearance and some mechanical aspects to the Walther P88. IPSC competitions for Team Bersa The Thunder 22 pistol chambered for the 22 Long Rifle cartridge is widely used among recreational shooters in North and South America, and the Thunder 22-6, a longer-barreled version of this pistol, is used in high-level competitions. The compact Thunder pistols sell very well in countries that ban the use of more powerful cartridges for civilian personal defense purposes. The Thunder 380 is popular in the US market as a small and light, easy concealable, high-quality and competitively priced personal defense handgun. The full-size Thunder combat pistol is the standard sidearm of the Argentina Armed Forces (Thunder 9), the Argentina Federal Police (Thunder 9), the Buenos Aires Provincial Police (Thunder 9) and several other law enforcement agencies (Thunder 9 & 40). Bersa as of 2019 introduced an eight-shot, single-stack 9mm-chambered polymer pistol called the BP9CC. This is a striker-fired pistol versus the hammer-fired Thunders. The BP9CC has a double-action trigger. The BP9CC also includes the locking barrel design. Versions chambered in .380 ACP and .40 S&W; are also available.

It is an interdimensional crossroads and scientific observatory. Knowhere is a severed head of an ancient celestial being. Development When asked about how they came up with the idea, authors Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning said: Overview Located within what appears to be a severed head of a Celestial floating along The Rip (the extreme outer edge of all spacetime with no specific physical location), Knowhere acts as a makeshift port of call and observatory of the End of the Universe for intergalactic travelers of all species and from all times. First appearing in Nova #8 (see 2007 in comics and Annihilation: Conquest), the station is administered by its chief of security, Cosmo, a telepathic and telekinetic Soviet space dog originally lost in Earth orbit in the 1960s. Knowhere maintains minor facilities for close observation of the end of the Universe, a main hall, a marketplace and other amenities including the bar, Starlin's. Cosmo assigns special \\"passport\\" bracelets allowing instantaneous transportation to and from anywhere in the Universe via the deceased Celestial's \\"Continuum Cortex\\", located within the brain-stem, from where sensors can also detect subtle disruptions in space-time occurring outside The Rip in the greater Universe. Facilitated by Cosmo and Richard Rider, Knowhere is now used as the base of operations for the new Guardians of the Galaxy.Inside Look: Guardians of the Galaxy #1 by DnA, Broken Frontier, May 21, 2008 The origins of Knowhere are uncertain. It is unknown as to how the severed head of a Celestial would have appeared at the end of the Universe, and what kind of forces could conceivably decapitate the God-like alien. Abnett and Lanning have said that the origin is \\"A mystery that will have to wait for now, but it's a biggie!\\"Lost In Space: Nova #9, Marvel.com, November 21, 2007 While recounting his origin to Eddie Brock, the Symbiote God Knull revealed that he was the one who killed the Celestial whose head became Knowhere with the use of All-Black The Necrosword and used his head to create more symbiotes.  Other versions  During the Secret Wars storyline, Knowhere is shown to be the Moon that orbits Battleworld. Its origin is that this Knowhere is the head of a Celestial that came to collect Battleworld but was slain in battle by God Emperor Doom and its head is still in orbit around Battleworld as a reminder of Doom's power.Guardians of Knowhere #1 In other media =Television= Knowhere appears in the Guardians of the Galaxy TV series.

Pioneer was initially affiliated with RKO Pictures, whose production facilities in Culver City, California were used by Pioneer, and who distributed Pioneer's films. Pioneer later merged with Selznick International Pictures. History The company was formed in 1933 by investor John Hay Whitney, who wanted to get into the motion picture business, and his cousin Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney, on the encouragement of RKO executive Merian C. Cooper, an enthusiast of the newly improved, full- color Technicolor Process No. 4, introduced in 1932.\\"Pioneer Pictures Formed\\", The New York Times, May 27, 1933, p. 11. The process had been used thus far only in Walt Disney cartoons. Technicolor, Inc. had been operating at a loss in 1931‚Äì1933, mostly servicing old contracts for its two-component color system, and badly needed a movie studio that would move the new three- component process into feature filmmaking.\\"Inquiring Investor\\", The Wall Street Journal, August 16, 1933, p. 8.

Other never-realized color projects were adaptations of the novels The Three Musketeers and Green Mansions.\\"Screen Notes\\", The New York Times, July 18, 1934, p. 20. Instead, Pioneer designated the musical short La Cucaracha (1934) to be its Technicolor live-action showcase, and subsequently won an Academy Award for it. Pioneer's Dancing Pirate (1936) was the second feature in full color In late 1934, Pioneer contracted with Technicolor to make nine features in the full color process, and hired RKO's Merian C. Cooper to be its vice-president in charge of production.\\"Pioneer Plans Color Films\\", The Wall Street Journal, November 5, 1934, p. 5.

In August she moved to the East Indies station, where she spent the next two years, until February 1942. She was then assigned to operate with the Eastern Fleet in March 1942. She was drydocked in Colombo to prepare for decommissioning. Whilst in harbour with other ships, the port came under attack from Japanese carrier-based aircraft, as part of the Indian Ocean raid. Colombo was targeted on 5 April in the Easter Sunday Raid. The Japanese force, led by Admiral Chuichi Nagumo, had hoped to catch the remnants of the Eastern Fleet in harbour. However, most of the fleet had left several days earlier. Japanese aircraft found only three targets in the harbour, and so proceeded to attack them. The Hector was hit by bombs and set on fire. She was abandoned and later sank. The Japanese also sank the destroyer in the harbour, before locating and sinking the cruisers and out at sea. The wreck of Hector was nominally returned to the Ocean Steamship Company on 20 April 1942, but the ongoing war meant that she was not refloated until 1946. She was then beached north of Colombo for assessment. It was concluded that she was beyond economical repair, and she was sold for scrapping.

The Flowerdale River is the largest tributary system on the Inglis River and makes up approximately one-third of the Inglis- Flowerdale catchment basin. Inglis-Flowerdale catchment area Inglis River estuary looking upstream. Stream pool of Camp Creek, a tributary of the Inglis River. While not tributaries of the main river system, Sisters Creek and Seabrook Creek are notable minor creeks which form part of the Inglis- Flowerdale catchment area. Annual rainfall ranges from about at the coast to greater than in the upper reaches of the catchment, some inland from Wynyard. Forestry plantations dominate the landscape in the western region of the catchment, with intensive agriculture land-use in the north and eastern regions. Because of the steep and confining nature of the topography around the Inglis and Flowerdale rivers, both have retained substantial native forests that tend to buffer the rivers from both land-use activities. Environment and wildlife A 2003 water assessment report determined that the upper Inglis and Flowerdale Rivers and their tributaries are in generally good ecological health, however the middle and lower reaches of the Inglis River have less healthy macroinvertebrate communities. The poorer health of these communities suggest that they have been impacted by sedimentation from upstream forestry operations, gravel pits and poor stream-side agricultural land management practices. Measures to help mitigate further environment issues may include fencing off rivers to prevent livestock from accessing waterways and re-vegetation of river banks to prevent further erosion. Beddomeia capensis is an endangered freshwater snail that had previously been surveyed at a tributary of Big Creek in 1989, but is now only known to occur on a few small streams upon Table Cape. Other aquatic threatened species in the Inglis-Flowerdale catchment includes the endangered giant freshwater crayfish, and the Australian grayling. =Willow removal= During 1999 and 2000, large scale willow infestation removal works were undertaken along the lower reaches of the Inglis River in the Flowerdale valley under the guidance of a Federal Government funding initiative. Poor remediation processes at the time, which involved removing the roots of the trees, has led to significant soil erosion and remains to be an issue for local agricultural landholders - more than a decade later.

The program was produced for Cartoon Network by Desert Panther Production and Rubicon Studios in association with Mirisch-Geoffrey-DePatie- Freleng and MGM Television, and premiered on the channel on March 7, 2010, both in HD and SD. Like the classic cartoon show, the programme is composed of two seven-minute Pink Panther shorts and a seven-minute Ant and the Aardvark short in between, retaining the main characters in both shorts though with some changes. Show premise =The Pink Panther= The Pink Panther shorts are reminiscent of the classic DePatie-Freleng shorts from the 1960s and the 1970s, from art direction, silent acting, musical scoring, and story lines. The Pink Panther remains silent throughout the show, and has been aged down as a teenager. The Little Man has been renamed \\"Big Nose\\" for this series with vocal effects provided by Alex Nussbaum. Pink Panther's horse and Big Nose's lovable canine companion have been reintroduced as well. The characters are more modern than the 1993 series. =The Ant and the Aardvark= The Ant and the Aardvark is based on the classic DePatie-Freleng shorts. In this version, the Aardvark's Jewish sense of humor and Jackie Mason-esque voice (here portrayed by Eddie Garvar (occasionally John Over) from his classic counterpart remains; a new, younger ant (voiced by Kel Mitchell) has replaced the Dean Martin-esque \\"Charlie\\" from the original shorts. The series now takes place in a jungle and new characters are introduced in this series. Characters *The Pink Panther: The protagonist of the series. He's a cool and collected character who always seems to rub Big Nose the wrong way. As in the classic series, he is, for the most part, a silent protagonist. He is also nicknamed Pink or Pinky. *Big Nose: Based on the original \\"Little Man\\" from the classic series. He is the neighbor and an archenemy of the Pink Panther and is not fond of him at all. He always ends up being upstaged by the Pink Panther in everything he tries to do where he got the Pink Panther back instead, making him far more nasty and unlovable than in previous incarnations (where he was mostly oblivious to the Pink Panther's presence). He's depicted as short, with a big nose and a mustache, and is plain white in color. He has a pet dog that, unlike his master, has almost no problem with the Pink Panther at all. *Hoarse: The Pink Panther's white horse, based on a horse that gave him trouble in several cartoons of the classic series. *Dog: Big Nose's white dog who is cute and lovable. Like his master, he is a plain white color and not very outstanding. He is not always fond of the Pink Panther, and is not afraid of showing his displeasure. But from time to time has shown to enjoy the Pink Panther's activities, such as music and dancing. *Ant: A small red ant, and one of the title characters of \\"The Ant and the Aardvark\\" sketches. He is quite sharp and intelligent and, like real-life ants, is physically very strong, being able to carry objects many times his weight. His remarks towards and about Aardvark are somewhat more sharp and sarcastic than in his previous laid-back incarnations. *Aardvark: A blue aardvark, and the main antagonist in \\"The Ant and the Aardvark\\" sketches. Like real aardvarks, he wants to eat the Ant. He's sly, sneaky and uses the fourth wall; he frequently addresses the audience as to what's going on. *Eli: An elephant, is a friend of the Ant and on many occasions protects the Ant from the Aardvark. Voice cast *Kel Mitchell as Ant *Eddie Garvar as Aardvark *Alex Nussbaum as Big Nose, Horse, Dog, Narrator, Big Nose's wife, Dog Tracker, Hedgehog, Chef on TV, Bear, Pig, Lion, Croc 1 and 2, Grampy, Italian Chef, Radio VO, Alien, Skunks, Walrus, Mockingbird Mike, Leopard *Jeannie Elias as Genius, Female Spy *John Over as Aardvark, Eli *Bob Spang as Gracie Gorilla, Rowdy Rhino, Mitey Mite Episodes Broadcast In the US, the show aired on Cartoon Network.

Most of the records were studio recordings produced by Alfred Lion or Francis Wolff. The two main series were '1500', which ran from 1955 to 1958, and '4000', which ran c.1958 to 1972. The 'BN-LA' series followed during the 1970s: this series contained many compilations and reissues in addition to new studio albums. Main series = 1500 series = Blue Note made the switch to 12\\" LPs late in 1955. The Modern Jazz Series (see the 5000 series below) continued with the following 12\\" LPs. Many of these were issued in both monaural versions (BLP series) and stereo versions (BST 81500 series), sometimes in electronically rechanneled stereo. In certain cases, the stereo versions of recordings from 1957 onwards only appeared many years later. Beginning in 1956 with BLP 1509, Reid Miles designed most of the Blue Note LP covers. The 1500 series has been systematically reissued by Toshiba-EMI in Japan (\\"Blue Note Works 1500\\" series, 20-bit 88.2 kHz CDs); the catalog numbers are TOCJ-1501, etc. In addition, originally unissued material from these dates was made available on Toshiba's 1600 series (20-bit 88.2 kHz CDs). *1501: Miles Davis - Miles Davis Volume 1 (5/9/52, 4/20/53) *1502: Miles Davis - Miles Davis Volume 2 (5/9/52, 4/20/53, 3/6/54) *1503: Bud Powell - The Amazing Bud Powell, Vol. 1 (8/9/49, 5/1/51) *1504: Bud Powell - The Amazing Bud Powell, Vol. 2 (5/1/51, 8/14/53) *1505: J.

Several of his songs, poems, and ballads are known outside of the Shaker movement, including \\"Rights of Conscience,\\" written around 1808 and included in the Shakers' first printed hymnbook, Millennial Praises, and \\"Come Life, Shaker Life\\", written between 1835 and 1837. Early life Bates was born to William and Mercy Bates in Hingham, Massachusetts on January 29, 1758. He was one of eleven children. In the 1760s, his family moved to Sherborn and Southborough, Massachusetts, before settling near Templeton, Massachusetts, around 1771. As a teenager in 1775, Bates taught himself to play the fife and joined the local militia. He served several tours of duty in the American Revolutionary War, mainly as a fifer and fife major. During the war years, at the age of 20, he married Lovina Maynard, the daughter of Bezaleel Maynard, a local man with whom Bates had served in the militia.Medlicott, pg. 3-16, 40-41. Adulthood After the war, Bates returned to the area of Athol, Massachusetts. In 1781 he was present at the Petersham, Massachusetts, home of David Hammond when Ann Lee and her Shaker followers traveled through the area and were hosted for a few days of preaching and proselytizing. Bates wrote of being drawn to Ann Lee's teaching at that time, but his family responsibilities inhibited him from further action towards becoming a Shaker himself.Medlicott, pg. 41-42. During this period, Bates was in his early twenties with a growing family. He tried several different trades but was unsuccessful. In the late 1780s, he migrated with his wife and children to the region of the southern Adirondacks, an area through which he had traveled during his wartime service. He migrated with an extended family group, which included members of his wife's family, and he settled in Hartford, New York.Medlicott, pg. 43-46. In the 1790s, Bates entered a long period of spiritual turmoil. He was a popular and jolly member of the Hartford, New York, community, and he served the church as the choirmaster, putting to use his considerable musical talents. But inwardly, Bates did not feel that he was truly a Christian. He continued to harbor thoughts of the Shakers. After much depression and soul-searching, he experienced a profound religious conversion around 1795. After that, he discovered a gift for preaching, and he was licensed to preach at Baptist churches around the region. He also began writing poetry, and he published a set of eight poetic texts in 1801 under the title, New Songs, On Different Subjects.Issachar Bates, New Songs, On Different Subjects (Salem, NY: Dodd, 1801) But spiritual satisfaction continued to elude Bates, and he secretly remained drawn to the Shakers. Finally, in the summer of 1801, he visited New Lebanon, New York, on the pretext of making a journey to visit his aged father in western Massachusetts. While there, he made the decision to become a Shaker. He returned to Hartford, where he faced considerable opposition from his family. Later that summer, he journeyed back to New Lebanon, where he made his formal confession of sins.Medlicott, pg. 48-55. Shakers The Shakers instantly recognized Bates's talent for preaching and proselytizing. Soon after his confession of sins, he undertook preaching trips on behalf of the Shakers. As a Shaker missionary, he was paired with Benjamin Seth Youngs. Between 1801 and 1805, the two were sent into Vermont, New Hampshire, and areas of New York state.Medlicott, pg. 62-66. In 1805, he left New Lebanon, New York, for an extended trip west with two other Shaker missionaries, John Meacham and Benjamin S. Youngs.Brewer, p. 34. Their travels took them to Kentucky and Ohio where the camp meeting revivals had taken place. Bates was the musician who sang at the first official Shaker meeting in the West at Turtle Creek, Ohio, on May 23, 1805. He was nearly strapped on a horse and thrown out of Indiana by antagonistic locals who objected to the Shakers establishing a community at West Union (Busro), Indiana. Bates eventually walked several thousand miles across Kentucky and the Midwest in the interests of advancing Shakerism. Before he joined the Shakers in 1801, Bates had learned many of the tunes of that time. He used one of these tunes in his early Shaker hymn, \\"Rights of Conscience,\\" composed about 1810. This long ballad hymn of fifteen verses pays tribute to both George Washington and Mother Ann Lee. Bates based his hymn on the popular tune of Washington's time, titled \\"The President's March.\\"Hall, pg. 42-47. Later on Bates became a prominent Shaker church leader, serving mainly at Watervliet, Ohio, just south of Dayton. He wrote many Shaker spirituals, including an anthem, \\"Mount Zion,\\" and the hymn, \\"Ode to Contentment,\\" with words attributed to Elder Richard Pelham at the Shaker community in North Union, Ohio. Bates returned to New Lebanon, New York in 1835 and the following year completed his lively and informative autobiography. He remained at New Lebanon until his death on March 17, 1837. As per his request, \\"Almighty Savior,\\" a hymn which he had composed, was sung at his funeral.Hall, pg. 33-35, 62-64. Bates was the father of Sarah Bates, who became known in her own right for her activities among the Shakers.

Graham III (Nov 20, 1940 - May 12, 2008) was the Director of Timing & Scoring for the Indianapolis 500 from 1978-1998 A native of Columbus, IN, but a longtime resident of Cincinnati, OH and then Brownsburg, IN. Graham designed and implemented the first fully automated electronic race timing and scoring system and introduced many of the timing-and-scoring innovations now used in American and International open-wheel racing. Graham was also a Computer Engineer for IBM for 30 years from 1962-1992, overseeing the PC Divisions unprecedented growth in home computers. His dual roles with IBM and Indy, birthed a partnership with \\"Big Blue\\" and USAC that enabled innovations not seen in other Motorsports.  Indy Racing League  Art Graham at the Indianapolis 500 A lifelong racing enthusiast who recalled watching the first live television coverage of the \\"500\\" in 1949 on a tiny screen through an appliance store window, Graham first became involved with the United States Auto Club in 1965 while living in Cincinnati. It wasn't long before he was serving on USAC's various competition commissions, eventually becoming Chairman of the Rules Committee. In 1982 he was named to USAC's Board of Directors, remaining there until 1997 as the Director of Corporate Development. Computers were being used at Indianapolis when Graham first came onto the scene, but he revolutionized their use into timing & scoring procedures. He designed and installed the first automated system that tracked and communicated drivers position and speed in Real-time. It simultaneously displayed race leaders and laps on the position board. Utilizing proprietary in-track antenna loops and on-car position transponders, the information was automatically fed to live TV broadcasts allowing home viewers to follow the race and position of their favorite drivers. For many years prior, it was traditional for an all-night audit of individual manual scoring sheets and DOS-based computers to verify race results, with the results not being officially posted until 8 a.m. the following day. By the late 1980s, under Graham's leadership, they would be posted within an hour of the race finish. Graham has been recognized as the \\"Father of Autosport Timing Technology\\". In the early 1990s, Graham began championing the cause of the National Midget Auto Racing Hall of Fame, and later served for several years as the organization's Secretary.  Interests  A great lover of big-band music, Graham was the Indiana representative of the Four Freshmen Society, and he had put in a considerable amount of effort toward the planning of a 60th anniversary celebration of the group's formation, to be held in Indianapolis in August, 2008.  Family  Graham is a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, Indiana Beta '62. His family includes wife Dina, daughter Susan L. Moore, sons Daniel A. and Matthew S. Graham, brother Andrew S. Graham, mother Martha S. Graham, and four grandchildren, Sydney, Reagan, Taylor and Kyle.

Embassy Racing was a British auto racing team founded by Jonathan France in 2003. Initially created as a conjunction with Xero Competition in the British GT Championship, the team expanded to become an independent team and began to win races in British GT before the team took a sabbatical year in 2006. Upon their return to motorsport, Embassy moved to the international Le Mans Series, running in a Le Mans Prototype class, as well as entering the British Superbike Championship's junior leagues, the Supersport and Superstock Championships, running with the support of Triumph Motorcycles under the MAP Embassy Triumph banner. In 2008, Embassy became a race car constructor for the first time, when they developed and built a new Le Mans Prototype known as the WF01. Embassy Racing ran two WF01s in the Le Mans Series, two Triumph Daytona 675s in the British Supersport Championship, and another Daytona in Superstock. At the end of the 2008 season Jonathan France declared that he planned to ‚Äòmothball‚Äô the team due to the economic climate. Then in March 2009 it was announced that the entire assets of the team were to be sold via an on- line auction.Embassy Racing under the hammer Motors TV Website 2009-03-30 Retrieved 2010-02-18 Team history =British GT= When Embassy Racing was first founded by France in 2003, the team initially served as a marketing brand, racing under their own banner but serving as the public face for a second team under the management of Xero Competition. Entered in the British GT Championship, Xero and Embassy ran Chevrolet Corvette C5s in the series' top category with drivers Paula Cook and New Zealander Neil Cunningham. Embassy's Corvette started the season with good results, outperforming the other Xero Corvette, but by mid-season the team had difficulty finishing races due to accidents and mechanical problems. The team rebounded and were able to score their first podium finish at race two at the Thruxton Circuit, aided by Ben Collins replacing Paula Cook. By season's end Embassy's Cunningham was well ahead of the two drivers in the Xero Corvette in the Drivers' Championship for their class and eventually earned 12th place in the standings. For 2005, feeling that their partnership with Xero was not to their benefit, Embassy Racing built their own team under the direct control of France. Neil Cunningham was retained as a driver and Ben Collins was signed to a full season contract, both of which shared a new Porsche 911 GT3-RSR. At the Knockhill Racing Circuit, the third race of the year, the duo earned Embassy's first victory, immediately followed by a fourth-place finish in the second race at the circuit. A string of podium finishes continued as the season progressed, including another win at the Silverstone Circuit. At the end of the year, Cunningham and Collins shared second place in the Drivers' Championship. The team also participated in the Spa 24 Hours with Porsche factory driver Sascha Maassen and finished the event fourth in their class, twentieth overall. =Le Mans Series= Embassy Racing's first car as a constructor, the WF01 powered by a Zytek V8 Jonathan France chose to put his team on sabbatical in 2006 following the birth of his son, but planned a return in 2007 that expanded the team to an international level. France chose to take his team to the Le Mans Series, a European championship for sports prototypes and grand tourers, and entered the LMP2 class, the lower category amongst the prototypes. Initially, a Pilbeam chassis was purchased and tested, but feeling that the car was not adequate, the Pilbeam was replaced by a newer Radical chassis. Neil Cunningham remained with the team while Warren Hughes joined as his teammate. In the short Le Mans Series season, Embassy did not start off well as their Radical did not finish the first two events. The team managed to finish their first race in round three, the 1000 km of N√ºrburgring, with thirteenth place and fifth in their class, earning them points towards the championships. Joined by Darren Manning, the team earned points finishes in the next two races. The season finale, the Mil Milhas Brasil, featured only three cars competing in Embassy's category, but the team's Radical was once again able to finish and earn second in their category. Boosted by the points received at the Mil Milhas Brasil, Embassy Racing finished seventh in the Teams' Championship, and Warren Hughes 18th in the Drivers' Championship. During the 2007 season, Embassy announced that they were moving to larger facilities in order to allow for the construction and support of a two-car entry in the following season of the Le Mans Series. The new WF01 prototypes, named after France's son William, shares several elements with the team's Radical SR9. This includes the same designer, Peter Elleray, but the new WF01s will instead run Zytek engines instead of the Radical's Judd. The two chassis were completed in time for the 2008 season, and Warren Hughes was partnered with Mario Haberfeld in one entry, while Jonny Kane and Joey Foster share the other car. By the second round of the 2008 season, one of Embassy's WF01's had already earned its first championship points with an eighteenth-place finish at the 1000 km of Monza. Embassy Racing also plans to make their first appearance at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, with Hughes, Kane, and Foster all driving. At the 2008 24 Hours of Le Mans Embassy qualified 5th in class and 24th overall. The car retired after 15 hours and was classified 39th in the final standings. The car was entered for one more race only, the 2009 Silverstone 1000km round of the 2009 Le Mans Series, with a finish of 14th. In 2013, the relaunched Tiga Race Cars bought the IP rights and all existing tooling and data of the WF01, with the intention of modifying the car to comply with the revised cost-cap regulations of the then-current LMP2 class. The car's engine was changed over from its original Zytek V8 to the Judd Power HK V8. The car did not compete in the 2014 season as originally planned but further development was carried out, with the aim of competing in 2015. The car never competed. =British Supersport and Superstock= As Embassy Racing was preparing for their entry into the Le Mans Series, team owner Jonathan France also chose to enter the world of motorcycle racing by entering the lower levels of the British national championship. A Yamaha R1 was purchased for use by Glen Richards in the Supersport series. In 2008, Embassy expanded their motorcycle program, signing Australian Paul Young to ride alongside Richards in Supersport, while South African A.J. Venter was signed to ride in the Superstock 600 Championship. The team was also able to sign a deal with Triumph Motorcycles for using their Daytona 675 bikes, as well as support direct from the Triumph factory.

(access: 11 October 2012). In 1937, he transferred to the British Royal Air Force (RAF) on a Short Service Commission and moved to England. He married an Englishwoman, Helen Dorothy Stanes, at Godmanchester on 19 October 1939. After the outbreak of World War II, he served with No. 139 Squadron RAF, and flew Bristol Blenheim bombers during the Battle of France, with the rank of Flying Officer\\"Bristol\\" BLENHEIM: The Journal of the Blenheim Society, 2011, iss. 69 (March), p16. On 12 May 1940, the squadron was stationed at Plivot and undertook a mission to attack German positions near Maastricht and Tongeren, in the Netherlands. Grey-Smith's aircraft (N6219) was attacked by a Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter and caught fire. As he parachuted out of the stricken bomber, Grey-Smith was hit by the tailplane and received severe head injuries, but landed safely. He was captured and kept at Stalag Luft III as a prisoner of war. During his time as POW, Grey-Smith began to explore an interest in art, with materials sent by his wife. He contracted tuberculosis and, as a consequence, was repatriated to the UK in 1944 for treatment, which included art therapy. =Artistic career= In 1945, he began studying at the Chelsea School of Art. Grey-Smith attended the school until 1947, learning from Ceri Richards, Robert Medley and Henry Moore. He and Helen returned to Western Australia and set up a pottery studio at their home in Darlington. In 1952, his tuberculosis recurred, and upon recovery eight months later, he and Helen moved back to London. He studied fresco painting at the Central School of Arts and Crafts under Louis le Brocquy until 1954. Upon their return to Australia, Grey-Smith worked for the Education Department and Art Gallery before journeying across the Nullarbor and to the north-west of Western Australia, which inspired his work. =Death= He died at the age of 65 from a recurrence of tuberculosis, in August 1981. Artwork and recognition He formed the Perth Group in the late 1950s with fellow artists Robert Juniper Brian McKay, Tom Gibbons and Maurice Stubbs. The group's aim was to promote European modernism, which was not yet accepted in Australia. Grey-Smith was influenced by C√©zanne, English constructionist painters, Nicholas de Sta√´lGleeson, James (1972) 'True to a joint code, but only so far'. In The Sydney Morning Herald July 16, 1972, p.50 and the Western Australian landscape. He travelled throughout the state, including the Kimberley, Pilbara, Goldfields and South West regions, drawing and making notes in order to produce larger works back in his studio. At the time of his death, his work was increasingly achieving recognition and is held in high regard today. In December 2007, Christie's auctioned one of his landscape paintings with an estimate of ¬£1500 to ¬£2500. The painting sold for ¬£29,300 (A$64,000). According to art collector Max Grunberg, Grey-Smith paintings sold at a large auction during the 1990s for $18,000 to $20,000 would now sell for at least $40,000 to $45,000. He won the Perth Prize for best Western Australian entry in 1955 and 1963, and the Perth Prize in 1964. In 1959, he was awarded the Murdoch Prize, and the Robin Hood Art Prize in 1962 He received the St George's Cathedral Prize in 1966 and 1967, and the Walter Murdoch Prize in 1967 and 1968. Grey-Smith was honoured with a Special Distinguished Artist and Scholar Grant from the Australia Council for the Arts in 1973 and an Order of Australia in 1981. In 2012, a new biography of the artist by Andrew Gaynor was published. Selected exhibitions * 1957 Brummels Gallery, Melbourne.Shaw, Arnold (1957) 'Art Notes: Young Painter Comes To Maturity'.

This was the Kingdom's eighth appearance at a Summer Olympic Games. The Swazi delegation to Beijing consisted of four competitors, two track and field athletes; Isaiah Msibi and Temalangeni Dlamini; and two swimmers; Luke Hall and Senele Dlamini. None of the four advanced beyond the first round of their respective events. Background The Swaziland Olympic and Commonwealth Games Association was recognized by the International Olympic Committee on 1 January 1972. Swaziland first sent a delegation to the Summer Olympic Games at the 1972 Summer Olympics. They did not send a delegation in 1976, and participated in the United States-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics; but have participated in every Summer Olympics since the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. This made Beijing Swaziland's eighth appearance at a Summer Olympiad. The 2008 Summer Olympics were held from 8‚Äì24 August 2008; a total of 10,942 athletes represented 204 National Olympic Committees. The Swazi delegation to Beijing consisted of four competitors, two track and field athletes; Isaiah Msibi and Temalangeni Dlamini; and two swimmers; Luke Hall and Senele Dlamini. Temalangeni Dlamini was chosen as the flag-bearer for the opening ceremony, while Hall was selected to do the same at the closing ceremony. Athletics Temalangeni Dlamini was 21 years old at the time of the Beijing Olympics and was making her debut in Olympic competition. On 16 August, she participated in the heats of the women's 400 meters, and was drawn into heat seven. She finished her heat in a time of 59.91 seconds, seventh and last in her heat, over nine seconds behind the heat's winner, Shericka Williams of Jamaica, and was eliminated from the competition. The gold medal was eventually won by Christine Ohuruogu of Great Britain in 49.62 seconds, the silver by Williams, and the bronze medal was taken by Sanya Richards-Ross of the United States. Isaiah Msibi was 24 years old at the time, and likewise making his first Olympic appearance. On 15 August, he took part in the men's 1500 meters and finished the first round race in 3 minutes and 51.35 seconds, 12th in his heat, and was eliminated from the competition. The gold medal was eventually won in 3 minutes and 33.11 seconds by Asbel Kiprop of Morocco, the silver by Nick Willis of New Zealand, and the bronze was won by France's Mehdi Baala. {class=wikitable style=\\"font-size:90%\\" - !scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"Athlete !scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"Event !scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Heat !scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Semifinal !scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Final -style=\\"font-size:95%\\" !Result !Rank !Result !Rank !Result !Rank -align=center !scope=\\"row\\" align=leftTemalangeni Dlamini align=leftWomen's 400 m 59.91 7 colspan=4Did not advance -align=center ! scope=\\"row\\" align=leftIsaiah Msibi align=leftMen's 1500 m 3:51.35 12 colspan=4Did not advance } Swimming Luke Hall was 19 years old at the time of the Beijing Olympics, and would later go on to represent Swaziland again four years later in the 2012 London Olympics. On 14 August, he took part in the first round of the men's 50 meter freestyle, a race he finished in 24.41 seconds, good for 60th place out of 97 athletes, and he was eliminated as only the top 16 advanced to the semifinals. The gold medal was won by C√©sar Cielo of Brazil in 21.30 seconds, the silver and bronze medals were both won by Frenchmen, the silver by Amaury Leveaux and the bronze by Alain Bernard. Four years later, in the same event, Hall came in 36th place. Senele Dlamini was 16 years old at the time of these Olympics, and was making her Olympic debut. She finished the first round of the women's 50 meter freestyle in 28.70 seconds, which was 61st place out of 90 competitors. Similarly to the men's race, only the top 16 could advance to the semifinals, and Dlamini was eliminated from the competition.

The feminist protest was organized by New York Radical Women and included putting symbolic feminine products into a \\"Freedom Trash Can\\" on the Atlantic City boardwalk, including bras, hairspray, makeup, girdles, corsets, false eyelashes, mops, and other items. The protesters also unfurled a large banner emblazoned with \\"Women's Liberation\\" inside the contest hall, drawing worldwide media attention to the Women's Liberation Movement. Reporter Lindsy Van Gelder drew an analogy between the feminist protesters throwing bras in the trash cans and Vietnam War protesters who burned their draft cards. The bra-burning trope was permanently attached to the event and became a catch- phrase of the feminist era.Heller, Karen. \\"The bra-burning feminist trope started at Miss America. Except, that's not what really happened.\\" Washingtonpost.com, 7 Sept. 2018. Academic OneFile  Origins  The New York Radical Women was a group of women that had been active in the civil rights movement, the New Left, and antiwar movements. The group was organized in the fall of 1967 by former TV child star Robin Morgan, Carol Hanisch, Shulamith Firestone, and Pam Allen. They were searching for a suitable way to draw attention to their movement. Hanisch said that she got the idea to target the Miss America contest after the group, including Morgan, Kathie Sarachild, Rosalyn Baxandall, Alix Kates Shulman, Patricia Mainardi, Irene Peslikis, and Ellen Willis, watched a movie that depicted how beauty standards oppressed women. It included clips of a Miss America parading in her swimsuit. \\"It got me thinking that protesting the pageant might be a good way to launch the movement into the public consciousness,\\" Hanisch said. \\"Because up until this time, we hadn't done a lot of actions yet. We were a very small movement. It was kind of a gutsy thing to do. Miss America was this 'American pie' icon. Who would dare criticize this?\\" The group decided to incorporate the techniques successfully used by the civil rights movement and adapt it to the new idea of women's liberation. = Purpose = In a letter on August 29, 1968, to the city mayor, Morgan requested a permit. She explained that the purpose of the protest was to demonstrate their objections to the pageant's focus on women's body over their brains, \\"on youth rather than maturity, and on commercialism rather than humanity\\". = Organizers and participants = In her letter requesting a permit, Morgan named the sponsor of the protest as \\"Women's Liberation\\", a \\"loose coalition of small groups and individuals\\". She was the key organizer of the protest. The advisory sponsor was Florynce Kennedy's Media Workshop, an activist group she founded in 1966 to protest the media's representation of African Americans. Other members of New York Radical Women were involved in protesting and documenting the event. Bev Grant, a musician and filmmaker / photographer with Newsreel who part in the protests, also shot film and took photos of the protests and of the pageant itself. Peggy Dobbins, a performer and activist, created a life-sized Miss America puppet which she displayed on the boardwalk in the guise of a carnival barker auctioning her off.Heller, Karen. \\"The bra-burning feminist trope started at Miss America. Except, that's not what really happened.\\" Washingtonpost.com, 7 Sept. 2018.

In Morgan papers, Duke University; see http://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/wlmpc/ Men were barred from taking part.  Protest event  = Atlantic City boardwalk = About 200 members of the group New York Radical Women traveled to Atlantic City in cars and chartered buses. On September 7, 1968, about 400 feminists from New York City, Florida, Boston, Detroit, and New JerseyRowbatham, Sheila. A Century of Women Penguin Books, New York. 1997 gathered on the Atlantic City Boardwalk outside the Miss America Pageant. They protested what they called \\"The Degrading Mindless-Boob-Girlie Symbol\\" and American society's normative beauty expectations.Morgan, Robin. \\"No More Miss America\\", Redstockings, 22 Aug. 1968. Web. 2 Feb. 2012. They marched with signs, passed out pamphlets, including one titled No More Miss America, and crowned a live sheep‚Äîcomparing the beauty pageant to livestock competitions at county fairs, including an illustration of a woman's figure marked up like a side of beef. = Freedom Trash Can = They threw a number of feminine products into a \\"Freedom Trash Can\\". These included mops, pots and pans, copies of Cosmopolitan and Playboy magazines, false eyelashes, high-heeled shoes, curlers, hairspray, makeup, girdles, corsets, and bras; items the protesters called \\"instruments of female torture\\" and accouterments of what they perceived to be enforced femininity. Protesters saw the pageant and its symbols as oppressing women. They decried its emphasis on an arbitrary standard of beauty. They were against the labeling, public worship and exploitation of the \\"most beautiful girl in America.\\" Sarachild, one of the protest organizers, reported that \\"huge crowds gathered for the picketing. People were grabbing our fliers out of our hands.\\" = Protest inside pageant = Along with tossing the items into the trash can and distributing literature outside, four protesters including Kathie Sarachild and Carol Hanisch bought tickets and entered the hall. While the outgoing 1968 Miss America, Debra Barnes Snodgrass, was giving her farewell speech, the women unfurled a bedsheet from the balcony that said \\"Women's Liberation\\" and began to shout \\"women's liberation!\\" and \\"No more Miss America!\\" They got out a half-dozen shouts before they were quickly removed by police. While TV cameras at the event didn't show them, newspapers all around the country covered the protest. \\"I think it kind of made the phrase 'women's liberation' a household term,\\" Sarachild says. \\"The media picked up on the bra part,\\" Hanisch said later. \\"I often say that if they had called us 'girdle burners,' every woman in America would have run to join us.\\" Outgoing Miss America Snodgrass said that the protesters were diminishing the hard work of thousands of competitors who were attending school and had put a lot of effort into developing their talents.  Origin of \\"bra-burning\\"  The dramatic, symbolic use of a trash can to dispose of feminine objects caught the media's attention. Protest organizer Hanisch said about the Freedom Trash Can afterward, \\"We had intended to burn it, but the police department, since we were on the boardwalk, wouldn't let us do the burning.\\" A story by Lindsy Van Gelder in the New York Post carried a headline \\"Bra Burners and Miss America\\". Her story drew an analogy between the feminist protest and Vietnam War protesters who burned their draft cards. Individuals who were present said that no one burned a bra nor did anyone take off her bra. However, respected author Joseph Campbell found a local news story reporting that articles were in fact burned, and a witness corroborating the news story. The article and the witness contradicted the feminists' statements, stating that lingerie was in fact burned at least briefly that day. An article on page 4 of the Atlantic City Press reported, \\"Bra-burners blitz boardwalk\\". It stated, \\"As the bras, girdles, falsies, curlers, and copies of popular women's magazines burned in the Freedom Trash Can, the demonstration reached the pinnacle of ridicule when the participants paraded a small lamb wearing a gold banner worded Miss America.\\" A second story in the same newspaper written by Jon Katz did not mention burning lingerie, but Campbell interviewed Katz. Katz, who was present that day, confirmed that bras and other items had been set on fire: \\"...the fire was small, and quickly was extinguished.\\" The feminists insisted afterward that the story was wrong. The parallel between protesters burning their draft cards and women burning their bras were encouraged by organizers including Robin Morgan. The phrase became headline material and was quickly associated with women who chose to go braless. Feminism and \\"bra-burning\\" then became linked in popular culture. Deborah J. Cohan, an associate professor of sociology at the University of South Carolina, Beaufort, believes that bra- burning has become negatively associated with feminism.Why You Don't Have to Wear a Bra = Historical precedent = The bra-burning trope echoed an earlier generation of feminists who called for burning corsets as a step toward liberation. In 1873 Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward wrote: = Backlash = Author and feminist Bonnie J. Dow suggested that the association between feminism and bra-burning was encouraged by individuals who opposed the feminist movement. \\"Bra-burning\\" created an image that women weren't really seeking freedom from sexism, but were attempting to assert themselves as sexual beings. This might lead individuals to believe, as she wrote in her article \\"Feminism, Miss America, and Media Mythology\\", that the women were merely trying to be \\"trendy, and to attract men\\". Women associated with an act like symbolically burning their bra may be seen by some as law-breaking radicals, eager to shock the public. This view may have supported the efforts of opponents to feminism and their desire to invalidate the movement. Some feminist activists believe that anti-feminists use the bra-burning myth and the subject of going braless to trivialize what the protesters were trying to accomplish that day and the feminist movement in general.Lee, Jennifer Feminism Has a Bra-Burning Myth Problem June 11, 2014 Time Joseph Campbell described the reaction that ensued as \\"serving to denigrate and trivialize the objectives of the women‚Äôs liberation movement.\\" = No More Miss America! = The protest planners produced a press release before the event that was afterward turned into a pamphlet titled No More Miss America!.No More Miss America! The pamphlet called on women to help \\"reclaim ourselves for ourselves\\". Written by Robin Morgan, it listed ten characteristics of the Miss America pageant that Morgan believed degraded women. Morgan wrote that the pageant contestants epitomize the \\"Degrading Mindless-Boob-Girlie Symbol\\". The runway parade is a metaphor of the 4-H Club county fair, where the animals are judged for teeth, hair, grooming, and so forth, and where the best specimen is awarded the blue ribbon. Since its inception in 1921, only Caucasian contestants had been accepted as finalists, so the authors derided the contest as \\"Racism with Roses\\". They criticized the \\"cheerleader\\" tour taken by the winner to visit troops in foreign countries as \\"Miss America as Military Death Mascot\\". Her support of troops personifies the \\"unstained patriotic American womanhood our boys are fighting for\\". She wrote that Miss America is a walking commercial for the pageant's sponsors, making her a primary part of \\"The Consumer Con-Game\\". It deplored the win-or-you're-worthless competitive disease, which it described as \\"Competition Rigged and Unrigged\\". The authors criticized \\"The Woman as Pop Culture Obsolescent Theme\\", which they described as the promotion of women who are young, juicy, and malleable, but upon the selection of a new winner each year, are discarded. She compared the pageant to Playboy's centerfold as sisters under the skin, describing this as \\"The Unbeatable Madonna-Whore Combination\\". The writers accused the competition of encouraging women to be inoffensive, bland, and apolitical, ignoring characteristics like personality, articulateness, intelligence, and commitment. They called this \\"The Irrelevant Crown on the Throne of Mediocrity\\". The pamphlet said the pageant was \\"Miss America as Dream Equivalent To\\", positioning itself as the penultimate goal of every little girl, while boys were supposed to grow up and become President of the United States. Men are judged by their actions, women by appearance. Morgan wrote that the pageant attempted thought control, creating the illusion of \\"Miss America as Big Sister Watching You\\". It attempted to enslave women in high- heeled, low-status roles, and to inculcate values in young girls like women as beasts of shopping. \\"No More Miss America!\\" was the very first public pamphlet of the time to share the movement's ideals; therefore, complaints about the Pageant, recorded in the pamphlet, outlined and predicted numerous problems these women might have to overcome in their battle for equality. The pamphlet became a source for feminist scholarship.  Legacy  A six-minute documentary, Up Against the Wall Miss America (1968), concerns the Miss America protest. The demonstration was largely responsible for bringing the women's liberation movement into the American national consciousness.Hanisch, Carol. \\"What Can Be learned: A Critique of the Miss America Protest\\", 2009, Web. 2 Feb 2012. http://carolhanisch.org/CHwritings/MissACritique.html The event \\"'marked the end of the movement's obscurity' and made both 'women's liberation' and beauty standards topics for national discussion\\".Confronting the \\"Bra-Burners\\": Teaching Radical Feminism with a Case Study, Beth Kreydatus, The History Teacher, Vol. 41, No. 4 (Aug., 2008), pp. 489-504 \\"No more Miss America! Ten points of protest\\" was included in the 1970 anthology Sisterhood is Powerful: An Anthology of Writings From The Women's Liberation Movement, edited by Robin Morgan.  Civil rights protest  Also on September 7, 1968, in Atlantic City, a separate civil rights demonstration took place in the form of a beauty pageant. African Americans and civil rights activists gather to crown the first Miss Black America. The winner, nineteen-year-old Philadelphia native Saundra Williams, had been active on the civil rights scene prior to the competition. As a student at Maryland State College, she helped organize the Black Awareness Movement with her classmates and staged a sit-in at a local restaurant, which refused to serve African Americans.Klemesrud, Judy. \\"There's Now Miss Black America\\". New York Times, 8 Sep. 1968: 81. Print Born to a middle-class family, she aspired to a career in social work and child welfare. She explained her motivation for running in the pageant: > Miss America does not represent us because there has never been a black girl > in the pageant. With my title, I can show black women that they too are > beautiful. ... There is a need to keep saying this over and over because for > so long none of us believed it. But now we're finally coming around. The competition, organized by civil rights activist J. Morris Anderson, was held at the Ritz Carlton a few blocks from Convention Hall, where the Miss America pageant took place the same evening. The Miss Black America contestants, prior to competition, rode in a convertible motorcade through the streets of Atlantic City and were greeted with cheers and applause, especially from members of the black community.Curtiss, Charlotte. \\"Miss America Pageant is Picketed by 100 Women\\", New York Times 9 Sep. 1968: 54.

It was originally one of five locations in Rhode Island which hosted the state legislature on a rotating basis, and served as the county courthouse through the 1980s. Currently the building is used for educational and community programs, meetings, and events. The building The architect of the Federal style courthouse is unknown; official state records of the time do not list any individual involved with the building. There are good architectural and political reasons to believe the architect may have been Russell Warren or possibly John Holden Greene.Jordy, William H. Buildings of Rhode Island. 2004. The building's structure is of stone, originally faced in brick, although that has since been stuccoed over. The original design of the interior of the building had a central staircase leading to a platform and split risers to the second floor. In 1836, the stairs were moved in a major redesign. History In 1814, the state General Assembly held a competition for a new courthouse; they accepted Bristol's offer of a location on Bristol Town Common facing Bristol Harbor, which was then a major transportation hub. The building was used between 1816 and 1854 as one of five locations for meetings of the Rhode Island House of Representatives and Senate. In 1854 the General Assembly decided to meet only in Providence or Newport. The building housed municipal offices and courts, in addition to the state legislature. In the 1930s it was restored by Providence architects Howe & Church.Historic and Architectural Resources of Bristol, Rhode Island. 1990. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. The building continued as the seat of Bristol County's court until the 1980s. The Bristol County Sheriff maintained offices there until 1997, when the building was purchased from the state for $1 by the Bristol Statehouse Foundation. The nonprofit foundation has worked to restore and maintain the building. Currently the building is used for education, community programs, meetings, and events. It also serves as the headquarters for the Bristol Fourth of July Committee.

History The large house was designed in 1848 by architects Russell Warren & Son on sixty acres of DeWolf family land; it was given to Charles Dana Gibson (the grandfather of the famous artist and namesake) upon his marriage to Abbey DeWolf, the daughter of the late US Senator James DeWolf. Warren had built many other important buildings in Bristol for the DeWolf family, who rose to prominence through wealth gained from the Atlantic slave trade. In 1901, the house was passed down from Abbey DeWolf Gibson to granddaughter Josephine Gibson, who became the longtime chatelaine of the estate. Josephine was one of the models of the \\"Gibson Girl\\" illustrated by her brother, named Charles Dana Gibson after their paternal grandfather. Josephine Gibson married a Mr. Knowlton and made Longfield a center of social and artistic gatherings until her death in 1969. Her son, bookbinder Daniel Gibson Knowlton, sold the house in 1972. In May of that year, it was nominated to the National Register of Historic Places. The property includes smaller houses and cottages, originally constructed to house servants and caretakers. Knowlton built an adjacent home and bookbindery, named Longfield Studio, on the property at 1202 Hope Street. The property has been sold several times since it passed out of the family. Various owners announced intentions to convert the property to a single-family house, a \\"green inn\\", a place for weddings and functions, or an artists' residency. In the early 21st century, renovations were begun, then halted, and the property was sold twice in 2012. By January 2014 the structure was seriously neglected and derelict, missing windows and the porch floor. Its future is uncertain. There is a nearly identical house, built c. 1845, at 64 Kay Street in Newport.Yarnall, James L. Newport Through its Architecture. 2005. Architecture The house is a slightly altered example of Gothic Revival architecture interpreted in wood. According to a National Park Service survey, the foundation of the house is of stuccoed stone and the walls are constructed of wood clapboards. The house has four chimneys. The original cut-out bargeboard trim was removed from the gables around 1907. The front porch was rebuilt with a steeper shingled roof and its Gothic bracing and wooden crockets were removed. The Gothic window over the front porch may have had its sill-level raised. The south side porch was enlarged from a half-octagon shaped protrusion, which had been accessible from only the south parlor window. Its Gothic balustrade, bracing and parapet railing were kept. The original exterior window blinds of the house are stored in the attic. The rear entrance porch was rebuilt in 1963. The original partition separating the front southwest bedroom from a dressing room was removed. The house originally had a wood-shingled roof and was painted light red with darker trim. As of 1979, the house was painted white with black trim.

It is a retelling of The Golden Bird and The Firebird. Plot summary The story revolves around the life of the clever young Ilya, who is one of the eight sons of a local boyar (Russian nobleman) named Ivan (who insists on being referred to as \\"Tsar\\"). Being in a household where the philosophy is 'survival of the fittest', Ilya has to contend with his jealous and overcompetitive brothers, who fear him for his intellect and abuse him constantly. His only friends are a priest (Father Mikhail) and a shaman (Ruslan), who are both as unwanted as he is, and Mother Galina, the elderly woman who runs the dairy. His already dismal life takes a turn for the worse when the legendary Firebird, an enormous hawk of fire similar to the phoenix, visits his father's prized cherry tree orchard and begins eating all of the ripe cherries. Days pass on and more cherries disappear, causing Ivan great anger as the culprit remains unknown and free. In a fit of rage, he promises a great reward: whoever catches the thief and brings him or them to him will become his heir. However, this proves to be useless as well for none are able to catch the culprit without falling asleep. After failing his attempt, the third son, Pietor, takes the opportunity to tell off his father and escape from Tsar Ivan's domination (stealing a horse and provisions for his escape in the process). Curious, Ilya spends the night at the orchard and, through the use of charms and some pins, manages to stay awake enough to see the Firebird. Shocked at what he's seen, Ilya remains quiet about his discovery and soon finds that he has been given the ability to understand the language of and speak with animals. However, having seen the Firebird, he is also, however, cursed with terrible luck afterwards, which leads to his being violently beaten by his remaining brothers and left for dead in the family crypt. Rescued by the priest and shaman, Ilya, with their help, concocts a plan to make himself appear harmless by pretending that his mind has been broken and he has become a fool in the traditional sense. This works for a while, but his brothers concoct another scheme to get rid of him: getting him to accompany them on a boar hunt, trying his legs to the saddle and making his horse bolt off. With the horse's help, Ilya escape unharmed, but the boar being hunted attacks and fatally wounds the horse, leaving Ilya to wander the forest in early winter. After narrowly escaping the attack of a rusalka (a female water spirit), he stumbles upon the hut of a wolf-hunter who takes him in and helps him. After staying with the hunter for a while, Ilya leaves to try to find the Firebird, who is the only one who can remove his bad luck. He soon stumbles upon the castle of Kashchei the Immortal, who has kidnapped and imprisoned the most beautiful princesses from all over and turned to statues all those heroes who have tried to rescue them (including Ilya's brother Pietor), and finds himself within reach of Princess Tatiana, the most beautiful girl in the world. Pretending again to be a half-witted fool, Ilya must use all his wits to defeat the Kashchei and win the Princess‚Äô freedom. With the help of the Firebird, a vixen and a nightingale, he learns of a way to destroy the Kashchei and free all of the captives. But once he saves Tatiana and the others and she has sworn in front of witnesses to marry him, he realizes that things are not as he would have wished: Tatiana is not all she appears to be on the surface but is in fact selfish, vain and spoiled, and his own feelings lie elsewhere. On the very day of his wedding to Tatiana, through a hint dropped by his friends the vixen and the nightingale, he discovers that Tatiana has been unfaithful to him with Pietor. In front of witnesses, he exposes her deceit and repudiates her in theatrical fashion, and, knowing that Tatiana will now have to marry Pietor (who does not really want her and who will mistreat her just like Tsar Ivan mistreated his own wife), rides away to be reunited with his true love, the Firebird Maiden.

It consists of 47 contributing properties. Greensburg was founded in 1794. The town site was originally called Glover's Station, named after its founder John Glover in 1779. The name change was due to the founding of Green County, and renaming the town to reflect the county's name. The county name was to honor American Revolutionary War General Nathanael Greene.Greensburg, Kentucky Due to their proximity to the Cumberland Trace, the town and the county grew rapidly. Green County's population jumped from 1,000 in 1790 to 6,096 in 1800, 6,735 in 1810, and 11,943 in 1820, with its highest population being 14,212 in 1840, when the county included what is now Taylor County. Most of the buildings in the district are of Federal or Greek Revival architectural style. Due to the heyday of the town and county being between 1794 and 1840, almost all the outstanding architecture is pre-1840, as after that year the population decreased in favor of other areas in Kentucky, as the Cumberland Trace gave way to railroads and steamboats for transportation. Although it escaped any conflict during the Civil War, it still was impacted by the economic downturn felt by the rest of Kentucky after the War. It also means that the basic structure of Kentucky seats built around 1800 is largely intact. The center of the historic district features the old courthouse, which was separately listed on the National Register 31 years before the district itself. It was the second courthouse the county had. It was built by five men between 1802 and 1804, and was used for 130 years, ceasing to be an active courthouse in 1931. The Jane Todd Crawford Library was on the second floor. It is the oldest courthouse west of the Allegheny Mountains. The limestone used in its construction was quarried locally.City of Greensburg Gallery Image:Downtown Greensburg Kentucky.jpgBusiness area References Category:National Register of Historic Places in Green County, Kentucky Category:Geography of Green County, Kentucky Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Kentucky ","title":"Downtown Greensburg Historic District (Greensburg, Kentucky)"},{"id":"17435166","text":"The tawny crazy ant, Nylanderia fulva, is an ant originating from South America. Like the longhorn crazy ant (Paratrechina longicornis), this species is called \\"crazy ant\\" because of its quick, unpredictable movements (the related N. pubens is known as the \\"Caribbean crazy ant\\"). It is sometimes called the \\"Rasberry crazy ant\\" in Texas after the exterminator Tom Rasberry, who noticed that the ants were increasing in numbers in 2002. Scientists have reorganised the genera taxonomy within this clade of ants, and now it is identified as Nylanderia fulva. In 2014, it was discovered that the ant produces and covers itself with formic acid as an antidote to the fire ant's venom. It is the first known example of an insect being able to neutralize another insect's venom, an ability speculated to have evolved in South America where the two species share the same native range. Colonies have multiple queens, which also contributes to their survival.Can Ants Eat Your Computer: Why the \\"crazy rasberry\\" ant infests electronic devices., Slate, 20 May 2008. As of 2012, the ants have established colonies in all states of the Gulf Coast of the United States including at least 27 counties in Southeast Texas. Description The ant is about long, thus smaller than the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta. It is covered with reddish-brown hairs. Their larvae are plump, and hairy, with a specific conformation of mouthparts and unique mandible morphology that allows for precise species identification. The colonies live under stones or piles; they have no centralized nests, beds, or mounds. They tend aphids for honeydew, feed on small insects and vertebrates, and forage on plants, especially for sweet materials. The ants appear to prefer the warmth and moisture of the coast.Ralph Blumenthal, A Pest Without a Name, Becoming Known to Ever More, The New York Times, May 16, 2008 N. fulva has been a pest in rural and urban areas of Colombia, South America, where it displaced all other ant species. There, small poultry such as chickens, have died of asphyxiation, while larger animals, such as cattle, have been attacked around the eyes, nostrils, and hooves. Grasslands have dried out because of the increase in plant-sucking insect pests (hemipterans), which the ants cultivate to feed on the sugary \\"honeydew\\" that they excrete. When attacked, these ants, like other formicine ants, can bite but not sting, and excrete formic acid through a hairy circle or acidopore on the end of the abdomen, using it as a venom, which causes a minute pain that quickly fades. Formic acid was named after the Latin word formica (ant), because it was first distilled from ants in the 17th century. Uniquely, the tawny ant also uses formic acid as an antidote against the venom alkaloids of the fire ant (known as solenopsins). The venom alkaloids of fire ants have been demonstrated to be strongly paralytic against competitor species, thus the tawny crazy ant may have developed a resistance by acid-immobilisation of the venom toxins. Tawny crazy ants were found to displace other ant species in their native Argentina and later the US, including the red imported fire ant. This was first thought to be due to exploitative and interference competition. =Formic acid as an antidote to fire ant venom= In March 2014, researchers concluded that formic acid helped tawny crazy ants survive fire ant venom in ant fights 98% of the time; when the gland ducts were blocked with nail polish in an experiment, crazy ants had only a 48% chance of surviving fights with fire ants. After exposure to fire ant venom, N. fulva retreats, covers itself with formic acid and returns to the fight. This is the first known example of an insect detoxifying another insect's venom, and the first discovery of an ionic liquid in nature which results from mixing of formic acid with venom from S. invicta. How formic acid acts as an antidote against the much more toxic fire ant's venom is unknown. Fire ant venom is a mixture of toxic alkaloids and proteins that presumably enable the alkaloids to enter rival ants‚Äô cells. Each alkaloid in the fire ant‚Äôs venom, including solenopsin, has a six-membered heterocyclic ring with fat-soluble side chains. The researchers who discovered the antidote property of formic acid in crazy ants speculate that the formic acid denatures the proteins in fire ant venom. Another possibility is that the nitrogen on an alkaloid‚Äôs heterocyclic ring is protonated, rendering the ionic molecule less lipophilic, thus less likely to penetrate the tawny crazy ant‚Äôs cells. Attraction to electrical equipment Infestations of Nylanderia fulva in electrical equipment can cause short circuits, sometimes because the ants chew through insulation and wiring. Overheating, corrosion, and mechanical failures also result from accumulations of dead ants and nest detritus in electrical devices.Computers at risk from Crazy Raspberry ants, Techworld, 16 May 2008. If an ant is electrocuted, it can release an alarm pheromone in dying, which causes other ants to rush over and search for attackers. If a large enough number of ants gathers, it may short out systems. It is unclear why colonies of Nylanderia fulva, like many species of ants, are attracted to electrical equipment. They may sense the magnetic fields that surround wires conducting electric current, or they may prefer the warmth produced by resistance to the currents in the wires. Some argue they simply are searching for food or an attractive place to nest. Rate of spread The Texas A&M; University research extension service quotes the annual rate of spread by ground migration as about 240 and 360 m per year in neighborhoods and industrial areas, respectively, and 207 m/year in rural landscapes hence spreading more slowly than fire ants. Other sources quote per year. Being carried by people, animals, and vehicles (in trash for example), the observed rate is much higher: the spread from five Texas counties in 2002 to 20 in 2007 yields an accelerated rate of per year, at which rate it would take about 70 years for them to reach New Orleans.

Range in the United States Reported distribution of the Rasberry crazy ant in the United States (2012); actual occurrence is thought to be more widespread The earliest record of N. fulva presence in the US is from Brownsville, Texas, in 1938.http://gap.entclub.org/taxonomists/Trager/1984b.pdf By the early 2000s, the ants spread across the southeastern portion of Texas including at more than 27 counties Large population explosions have been described also on St Croix in the US Virgin Islands; in many cases the ant species was misidentified as its close relative, the hairy crazy ant, Nylanderia pubens. As of 2012, the ants have established colonies in all states of the Gulf Coast of the United States. The ant is considered an invasive species. Control in the US The ants are not attracted to ordinary ant baits, and are not controlled by over-the-counter pesticides,Ants swarm over Houston area, fouling electronics, Yahoo News, 15 May 2008. and are harder to fully exterminate than many other species because their colonies have multiple queens.

Outbuildings Of the six original buildings, only four are still standing. The main house, a houseman's house, one stable barn are still intact. The ice house has been reduced to about 40 percent of its original structure and two additional barns have been demolished for safety concerns. The current barn that is still standing is used for llamas that live in a pasture just beyond the Western side of the Mansion. Other buildings have been built with the purpose of renting them out to travelers. The \\"Dowager House\\" was completed in 2002. The Dowager is a building southwest of the mansion overlooking the largest pond on the current property. Two other cottages have been built with the intention of renting out as well. They are nearly identical and are located west of the main house. New construction Approximately 20 years after the Garth Mansion was completed, Mrs. Helen K. Garth expanded the square porch to become a true wraparound veranda large enough for many family and friends to enjoy the picturesque view both south and east. When the Garth Mansion was transformed into an operating Bed and Breakfast in 1987 many changes had been made to accommodate overnight guests. Each of the rooms featured a large closet. These closets are now used as restrooms and retrofitted with running water and sewer. The original method of heating the mansion was carbide gas. The original gas pipes now serve as tubing to hold electrical wire. This wire powers the lights that replace the wicks in lamps and light fixtures of which many are original to the house.

Lebo was the principal local reporter covering Kitzmiller v. Dover in 2004 and 2005, and was featured prominently in the Nova documentary Judgment Day: Intelligent Design on Trial both because of her coverage and because her father, Shiremanstown Mayor Dean Lebo, who co-owned Christian radio station WWII-AM (broadcasting to Harrisburg), sided with the Dover school board in the controversy. An award-winning journalist for over 20 years, including helping to reopen murder cases from the 1969 York Race Riot, Lebo left reporting to write The Devil in Dover, a book about the trial of the intelligent design movement and its effects on Dover.  Early life  Lauri was the oldest of Dean and Ann Lebo's five children. Lauri Lebo attended Sunday school weekly and sang in the church choir. She believed the stories of Adam and Eve, Noah's Ark, and Jesus‚Äô sacrifice. Her mother taught her to enjoy life. Her father taught her about possibilities. As she grew older, she drifted away from the church. Her father's conversion to the Pentecostal faith began in 1987, when Lauri Lebo was about 23, when the father who had taught her about the distance of the stars and whom she loved dearly became ‚Äú... a fundamentalist, speaking- in-tongues, slain-in-the-spirit, beware-the-mark-of-the-beast, faith-healing Christian...‚Äù) Lebo said her York County male elementary school classmates used to beat her up because of her ‚Äúbig mouth.‚Äù Inspired by her friend's journalist father, Ed Jensen, who included his daughter's friends in his ‚Äúclever‚Äù news-related conversations, Lebo was deciding to become a journalist. When she was 15, her family evacuated their home due to the Three Mile Island partial nuclear meltdown just across the Susquehanna River from Newberrytown, less than 5 miles from her home at the time.Lebo lived close to Three Mile Island  Journalism/Authorship career  Ed Jensen stayed in the area to report when Three Mile Island had its partial nuclear meltdown. Jensen died three years later of cancer, and Lebo ‚Äúunderstood what it means to be a reporter,\\" and become one in 1985. In 2000, her first big story covered the 1969 York, PA race riot. Based on a series of articles for the 30th anniversary of the riots by Lebo and others at the York Daily Record/Sunday news, the York County District Attorney and Deputy Prosecutor each reopened investigations. = Journalism related to the Dover trial = In 2004, the York Daily Record assigned their Education Reporter, the then-Christian Lebo, to cover Kitzmiller v. Dover, which she called ‚Äúthe most amazing story I've ever covered in my life.‚Äù Lebo sat through every day of testimony. ‚ÄúAs a reporter who doesn't come from a scientific background,‚Äù she was amazed daily that she was getting paid to ‚Äúlearn about evolution and the scientific method.‚Äù The plaintiffs presented ‚ÄúThe biology class you wish you could have taken‚Äù, as Lebo quoted Margaret Talbot. ‚ÄúEvery day we‚Äôd... learn something else incredible about... the fossil record, about the Avida program, which is a software program that actually shows evolution.‚Äù Lebo had thought she could see the ‚Äúhand of the Divine‚Äù when Intelligent Design was first described to her. She had been looking forward to hearing scientific arguments for the Christian god. Instead, she heard the primary scientist for the defense, biochemist Michael Behe, admit that astrology is as much a science as Intelligent Design is. During her December 2015 interview with Freedom From Religion‚Äôs Freethought Radio podcast, Lebo compared the pressure that Dover teachers felt to teach Creationism in biology class on the one hand, to the pressure she received from her employer to \\"write something nice\\" about Creationism on the other. Although it relented after several months, the York Daily Record threatened Lebo with dismissal if she spoke at ‚ÄúEvolution 2006‚Äù, put on by the Stonybrook University Department of Ecology and Evolution. The York Daily Record also strongly opposed Lebo's request for time off to write her book on the Kitzmiller v. Dover trial, claiming this would offend their conservative Christian readers. So Lebo quit her job as reporter and wrote The Devil in Dover. Afterwards, Lebo became a reporter for Religion Dispatches, from which she announced, on 2011-07-10, her retirement to join the Pennsylvania State Education Association. Lebo was one of three panel judges for the 2016 Heywood Broun (journalism) Award. In October 2016, Lebo was given the Freedom From Religion Foundation's Freethought Heroine Award in recognition of the special contributions of women to freethought and the battle to keep state and church separate. = Journalism philosophy = Since the Dover trial, Ms. Lebo has subscribed to Walter Williams‚Äô Journalist‚Äôs Creed, the words of which ‚Äúremain one of the strongest summations of the guiding principles of our craft‚Äù and the Walter Lippman philosophy of ‚Äúobjectivity of method‚Äù, rather than the pretense that journalists have no opinions. ‚ÄúIf one side is a lie‚Äù and the reporter treats it as equal to the other side, that reporter performs a disservice. She also asserted that media consolidation threatens a journalist's ‚Äúdepth and breadth of knowledge (of her/his sources and community) and does a disservice to democracy.‚Äù = Journalism awards = *Freedom From Religion 39th National Convention 2016 Freethought Heroine *Studs and Ida Terkel Fund prizewinner for The Devil in Dover (Initial prizewinner) *27th Annual Schnaeder Print Media Awards (2006) 1st Place Beat Coverage: Daily Newspapers Under 49,000 Circ. for her coverage of intelligent design *To the York Daily Record and York Dispatch/Sunday News (Lebo reported for both, including articles on the York race riots) National Journalism Award for Public Service Reporting - Under 100,000 circulation for coverage of the York race riot. = Selected articles = *Religion Dispatch articles, 15 pages of links *The Scopes Strategy: Creationists Try New Tactics to Promote Anti-Evolutionary Teaching in Public Schools *Unregulated Capitalism and Christian Fervor *No News Is Bad News *‚ÄòAcademic Freedom‚Äô is Creationism *Intelligent Design Propaganda Is Coming to a Theater Near You *Was Guillermo Gonzalez ‚ÄúExpelled‚Äù?

The first version was released on July 1, 1987 by the former German software company DMC GmbH. Calamus was discontinued in March 2018 and is no longer supported by its German owner company, invers Software. It is also able to run under a built-in and transparent Atari emulator on Windows, or on other platforms such as Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X, using any available TOS emulator. Calamus is a software RIP application which generates high-quality output in any resolution. It was one of the first DTP applications supporting an own vector font format, notable for its support for automatic kerning even where adjacent characters are set in different fonts or at different sizes. Its high modularity offers features for almost every purpose in desktop publishing. Calamus also was one of the first DTP apps to support real virtual objects and frames, nondestructive vector masks, and editable PS/PDF import. Its (adjustable) measurement base of 1/10,000mm allows accurate positioning of elements. Calamus was ported to Windows by MGI Software and was released as Calamus 95. The current and last version of Calamus is Calamus SL 2015, also available as SLC 2015 (complete edition with all additional modules) and LE 2015 (lite edition with restricted number of modules). Raster Image Processor Calamus is a RIP itself and handles various, adjustable raster dot sizes at the same time. It handles rasterization information per document, page or even per frame. It also uses a unique, notable method of cutting raster dots, which means that a screen raster can be cropped or clipped at certain borders, given by the document layout elements. Thus, it does not require any external RIP for interpretation, rendering and screening of documents. Using a special module, Calamus supports dot rasterization (using the term Star Screening) which is a frequency modulated method of halftoning (Stochastic screening). Calamus Intelligent Kerning Kerning in Calamus works with sets of left and right bounds measured at different heights for each glyphRather than using kerning pairs or relying on simple side-bearing measurements, Calamus‚Äô native fonts encode left and right bounds for each character at eight different latitudes. Unlike the kerning information in other formats, the resulting jigsaw-pieces can be used to fit characters together, even if those characters are from different fonts or if they are set at different sizes. In contrast, the kerning implementation in OpenType and TrueType only works when adjacent characters are part of the same font, which can result in character collisions or poor kerning in some instances. The alternative is to use optical kerning, where the shapes of the characters are analysed to determine the appropriate distances; Calamus‚Äô approach might be regarded as a simplification of that, working with a low-resolution version of the final character.

Retrieved 2012-03-29. (With essay by Harold Augenbraum from the Awards 60-year anniversary blog.) The book tells the story of retired literary agent Joe Allston, who receives a postcard from an old friend, a Danish countess named Astrid. Joe initially hides the postcard from his wife, Ruth. However, he soon reveals to her not only its existence but that of a diary Joe kept twenty years before, when Joe and Ruth met Astrid while visiting Denmark. The Allstons took the trip in the wake of the death of their only child, Curtis, with whom Joe fought constantly. Stegner moves the novel's narration back and forth between the present day, as Joe struggles with the physical and emotional degradations of older age, and Denmark, where Joe and Ruth get caught up in the strange, almost Gothic world of Astrid and her ostracized aristocratic family. It transpires that Joe became romantically involved with Astrid‚Äîto what degree Ruth hopes to find out‚Äîand still has unresolved feelings about her.

Tiger's Lair is a part of Mizzou Spirit, a part of Student Activities at the university. This program is headed by its Director. Sign-ups for the section are before the first week of classes at the Midnight Barbecue. Members often wear costumes and other outfits to games including overalls, helmets, and football pads. The first 60 students in line are allowed to stand in the front row, and become a part of the front row saying, which is painted on each person's chest. Coordinators then paint that week's saying.

The section is visible from aerial cameras as a \\"gold section,\\" as students are required to wear their Tiger's Lair shirt to gain entry to the section before games.

History  On August 1, 1995, Mizzou Spirit was founded with the creation of Tiger's Lair. At the time, the Missouri Tigers football team averaged 3 wins per season, and the section was created to boost student morale and attendance. The solution was to create an organization to bring the most spirited fans together at football games. The first year after its creation, the average attendance at football games jumped from around 33,000 to 39,000, and in its second year, attendance jumped to an average of 52,500 fans. In 2007, the section expanded to its largest size to 1,111 members. In 2008, there were 1,500 members in the section. In 2009, there were approximately 1,600 members.

Bache was the \\"chief\\" of this science and intelligence grouping. American Prometheus ‚Äì The American System who flourished before and up to the American Civil War. (\\"Lazzaroni\\" was slang for the homeless idlers of Naples who live by chance work or begging - so called from the Hospital of St Lazarus, which served as their refuge.) These scientists then gained greater support and laid the foundation for the National Academy of Sciences. However, the National Academy did not solve the problems facing a nation plunged in Civil War ‚Äì as the Lazzaroni had hoped, nor did it centralize American scientific efforts. These Lazzaroni were mostly professional physical scientists, interested in geophysical problems, who admitted a few kindred souls from other fields to their ranks. Their interests and range of influence extended to all of the sciences and included much of the research performed in universities and the government. They were consciously promoting the development of a professional scientific community in America. The Lazzaroni in the United States actually existed in the 1850s and a little before, though the name was not always the same as the group changed and grew. The Lazzaroni wanted to mimic the autocratic academic structures of European universities. The members of the Lazzaroni wanted only university-educated scientists, at one point, so as to create a \\"pure science\\" for America. Therefore, the scientists who did not match the code and \\"oath\\" of the initial members would be forced, if possible, out of their vocation and not allowed to advance unless they met the qualifications of the Lazzaroni, who often kept scientists out of any professional scientific position. They used their influence together, a group of top scientists against any one individual. The following is a partial list of Lazzaroni and their opponents.

Bache did not like Maury working near the area which Bache regarded as his own, the Coast Survey. However, due to persistent shipwrecks along the coast, Maury was ordered to create charts. After his charts were widely available, the losses were greatly reduced. Bache became jealous and was determined to get revenge. Davis was a Regent of the Smithsonian for several years (1847, 1851; 1853-57 as Secretary of War); the Institution clashed with the Naval Observatory over using its endowment funds for professional scientific advancements.

It is native to eastern California and Oregon and western Nevada, where it grows in desert and plateau scrub. This is an erect or spreading herb, usually an annual, approaching 50 centimeters in maximum stem height or length. It produces several thick green leaves which are somewhat oval to nearly round and a few centimeters wide. Inflorescences arise from the stem on peduncles of several centimeters and hold hemispheric or spreading clusters of up to 35 white to pinkish flowers. Each small flower in the cluster is a narrow tube up to 2 centimeters long which abruptly spreads into a lobed corolla. The fruit is a few millimeters long and has hollow, inflated wings.

Described as \\"street people under a chief\\", they were often depicted as \\"beggars\\"‚Äîwhich some actually were, while others subsisted partly by service as messengers, porters, etc. No precise census of them was ever conducted, but contemporaries estimated their total number at around 50,000, and they had a significant role in the social and political life of the city (and of the kingdom of which Naples was the capital). They were prone to act collectively as crowds and mobs and follow the lead of demagogues, and proved formidable in periods of civil unrest and revolution. Revolutionary period At the time of the French Revolution, the Lazzaroni were staunchly monarchist in their political inclination‚Äîthe diametrical opposite of the contemporary Parisian sans-culottes‚Äîwith their (sometimes lethal) mob violence being directed against supposed republican and Jacobin sympathisers. For that reason, republicans at the time and later dismissed them as \\"tools of the absolutist government\\". The Lazzaroni were fiercely loyal to the House of Bourbon and specifically to the person of King Ferdinand I who‚Äîunlike most monarchs of his and other times‚Äîdid not keep an aristocratic distance but liked to mingle among the Lazzaroni and sport with them. During the French military campaigns of the late 1790s, designed to export the Revolution to Italy (as to other parts of Europe), the regular Neapolitan troops did not particularly distinguish themselves against the French Army. The Lazzaroni, to the contrary, clamored to be armed and made a valiant effort to defend the city against the French‚Äîeven though the royal family had already fled to Sicily. Some sources put as high as 2,000 the number of Lazzaroni who were killed on a single bloody day. Though unable to stand in face-to-face fighting with trained troops (a contemporary drawing shows Lazzaroni being mowed down by a volley from French guns), their resistance ensured that the Parthenopaean Republic (which was established in Naples) had no popular base of support and could only rely on the repressive power of the French Army. Thus, it collapsed when the French needed to shift much of their troops elsewhere in Italy‚Äîwhereupon the Lazzaroni exacted acts of retribution upon that republic's adherents. Friedrich Engels wrote about the Neapolitan lumpenproletariat during the repression of the 1848 Revolution in Naples: \\"This action of the Neapolitan lumpenproletariat decided the defeat of the revolution. Swiss guardsmen, Neapolitan soldiers and lazzaroni combined pounced upon the defenders of the barricades.\\" The Lazzaroni and Garibaldi During the first decades of the Nineteenth Century, the Bourbons gradually lost the support of the Naples Lazzaroni. This was fully evident by 1860 when Garibaldi arrived in the city at the climax of his campaign for the unification of Italy. As mentioned in many eye-witness reports, when entering Naples after the Bourbon King fled, Garibaldi received a tumultuous welcome from the Lazzaroni, as from other sections of Naples' population. Journalist Charles Arrivabene wrote at the time: \\"Garibaldi was accompanied by a great procession along the seafront to Piedigrotta (...) He was cheered by fishermen and lazzaroni, and women shouted 'May the blessed Virgin be with you, Eccellenza!'\\".C.Arrivabene, \\"Italy Under Victor Emmanuel, a personal narrative\\", London, 1862; quoted in Lucy Rial, \\"Garibaldi, Invention of a Hero\\", London, 2007, pp. 230‚Äì231, p. 430 note 21 Another observer, Marc Monnier, noted that \\"Garibaldi is a saint for les lazzarones. It is God who had sent him to save the country. Several call him Jesus Christ, and his officers are the apostles. Alms are asked in Garibaldi's name\\".M.Monnier, \\"Garibaldi.

When Unitarians were excluded from the Boston YMCA (which was evangelical) in 1851, a group of Harvard students founded a Christian discussion group, which was incorporated as the Boston YMCU in 1852.http://www.cityofboston.gov/Images_Documents/BYMCU%20Study%20Report_tcm3-29003.pdf In 1873, the organization decided to construct its own building. $270,000 was raised, and construction on the original segment completed in 1875. The building was designed by Nathaniel Jeremiah Bradlee, constructed in a High Victorian Gothic style, and included ground-level retail. Several additions were made, including in 1956. The building was designated a Boston Landmark by the Boston Landmarks Commission in 1977 and added to the National Historic Register in 1980. Boston YMCU owned Camp Union, a camp, in Greenfield, New Hampshire (1929‚Äì1993) (now Barbara C. Harris Camp & Convention Center of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts). From its renovation in 2003 to 2011 it was called the Boylston Street Athletic Club, and later the Boston Union Gym or BYMCU Athletic Club. The Massachusetts Commission for the Blind moved out in 2012, and the organization began failing financially. In 2016, plans were announced to redevelop the site as 46 units of affordable housing, in partnership with the Planning Office for Urban Affairs of the Archdiocese of Boston.https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/04/08/amid-skyscrapers-new-home- for-needy/1lMVaOlqgqvDB1WIM8F9jI/story.html Image:Boston Young Men's Christian Union - front facade.JPG Goal (1852) The BYMCU goal in 1852 was to furnish the young men of Boston and vicinity a place of pleasant resort where the influences are beneficial and elevating, to provide them with opportunity of self-improvement and healthful recreation, at little or no expense; to give them opportunities for doing good, by engaging in charitable and benevolent work. Members All young men of good moral character, and claiming to believe in the truths of Christianity, without distinction of sect or party, were eligible as members of this society. Activities The report of 1871 shows the Union organized, with committees as follows: finance; lectures, classes, and entertainments; library; rooms; members; benevolent action; public worship and religious study. Sunday religious services were maintained, seats in churches furnished to young men, teachers supplied for Sunday schools and missions, boarding-places recommended, employment secured, savings deposited, and practical benevolent work engaged in. In 1875, there were classes in book-keeping, German, French, parliamentary law, vocal music, astronomy, elocution, and Shakespeare; monthly socials were held, at which many of Boston's most cultured women were present; and a Christmas and New Year's festival was given to poor children. In 1895, we note, 2,318 children and 267 adults were sent to the country for short periods, and carriage and other drives for shut-ins and convalescents to the number of 8,070 provided. The report for 1900 showed that the secular classes had grown in variety and attendance, that the library had 15,000 volumes, that the membership was 5,554, that religious services had been held every Sunday except during July and August, and that over $18,000 had been expended in drives, bay trips, and country visits for the poor.

A recent botanical reclassification split off some species formerly in Senecio, putting the giant groundsels in the new genus Dendrosenecio. It also redefined the former species Senecio cottonii, as a subspecies of Dendrosenecio johnstonii. Both genera are in the family Asteraceae. The giant grounsels of the genus Dendrosenecio evolved, about a million years ago, from a Senecio that established itself on Mount Kilimanjaro, with those that survived adapting into Dendrosenecio kilimanjari. As it moved down the mountain, the adaptations necessary for the new environment created the new species, Dendrosenecio johnstonii. Various subspecies are found on other mountains. Description Dendrosenecio johnstonii can be up to 10 meters tall, and grow to 40 centimeters (17 inches) or more in diameter. The centre of the stem, at full size, contains 1 to 2 centimeters of pith. It branches repeatedly, forming a dense canopy with 50 to 80 branches when mature. The leaves are hairless, heart-shaped (cordate) and large, 53 centimetres (approximately 2 feet) long by 40 centimetres (16 inches) wide. The flower shoot is a tall, broad cone, 60 centimetres (about 2 feet) tall, and 40 centimetres (16 inches) wide, with the flower heads horizontal. Each floret is about 25 millimetres (one inch) long, and the compound flower is made up of 11 to 15 of the petal-like ray florets, with thirty to fifty \\"disc\\" florets in the centre. Distribution D. johnstonii lives between the altitudes of 2,750 and 3,350 meters (9,000 and 11,000 feet) on Kilimanjaro. The following excerpts were presented as first hand accounts: ;Kilimanjaro (1903): \\"Ravines longer retain a somewhat richer vegetation. The last stunted Erica-trees disappear from them at 2,900 meters; and are replaced by a new characteristic plant of very peculiar habit, the arboreous Senecio johnstonii, with a spongy, simple or forked stem, the top of which bears a rosette of leaves as long as one's arm, and a dense inflorescence a meter in length.\\" :\\"Senecio johnstonii bears the least resemblance to the alpine habit in this region. It is remarkable, however, that plants of similar habit are also found on tropical high mountains elsewhere. For the Vellozieae of Brazil are similar, and so to some extent are species of Espeletia in the Cordilleras of Venezuela.... In other respects the impress of the alpine climate is most clearly stamped on the vegetation, especially in the higher part of the region, with its dwarf plants. Protective measures against transpiration are everywhere strongly developed, in particular dense coatings of woolly hairs are frequent.\\" ;Kilimanjaro (2007): \\"There is no bamboo zone, nor a Hagenia-Hypericum zone. Above about 4,600 meters, very few plants are able to survive the severe conditions, although specimens of Helichrysum newii have been recorded as high as 5,760 meters (close to a fumarole), and mosses and lichens are found right up to the summit. The upland moor consists primarily of heath/scrub plants, with Erica excelsa (Erica rossii), Philippia trimera (Erica trimera), Adenocarpus mannii, Protea kilimandscharica (Protea caffra), Stoebe kilimandscharica (Seriphium kilimandscharicum), Myrica meyeri-johannis (Morella salicifolia), and Myrsine africana. Grasses are abundant in places, and Cyperaceae form the dominant ground cover in wet hollows. On flatter areas between the upland moor and the forest edge are areas of moorland or upland grassland composed of Agrostis producta, Festuca convoluta (Poa kilimanjarica), Koeleria gracilis (Koeleria capensis), Deschampsia sp., Exotheca abyssinica and Andropogon amethystinus, with scattered bushes of Adenocarpus mannii, Kotschya recurvifolia and Myrica meyeri-johannis (Morella salicifolia). Various species of Helichrysum are found in the grasslands and in the upland moor. Two distinct forms of giant groundsel occur on the upper mountain: Senecio johnstonii cottonii, endemic to the mountain and only occurring above 3600 meters , and S.johnstonii johnstonii which occurs between 2,450 meters and 4,000 meters, and shows two distinct forms. At all altitudes Senecio favours the damper and more sheltered locations, and in the alpine bogs is associated with another conspicuous plant, growing up to 10m tall, the endemic giant lobelia Lobelia deckenii. Below the tree line, the park includes six corridors through the forest to the mountain foot.\\" References External links johnstonii Category:Endemic flora of Kenya Category:Mount Kilimanjaro Category:Afromontane flora ","title":"Dendrosenecio johnstonii"},{"id":"17435716","text":"Dendrosenecio adnivalis (synonym Senecio adnivalis) is one of the giant groundsels of the mountains of Eastern Africa. D. adnivalis grows on the Rwenzori Mountains and on the Virunga Mountains in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Description Dendrosenecio adnivalis attains heights of tall, trunk can be 40 centimeters diameter and the pith diameter. The stems have 25 to 60 leaves densely packed in a rosette shape at the top. Old leaves are persistent, withered leaf-bases covering the stalk for 1 to 3 meters below the leaf-rosettes. Leaf surfaces are elliptic to heart shaped and can be long and wide, hairy on the top and not hairy on the bottom. Branched clusters of flowers to tall and wide. The droopy flower heads have 9 to 20 ray florets, 16 millimeters long or no ray florets at all and 90 to 250 disc florets. Distribution The Congo basin is very wet; humid air is trapped by the mountains and rain falls on most days even in the drier months. Above 2500 meters (8,200 ft) clouds can persist for several days making the Rwenzori and the Virunga a wetter environment than the other East African mountains. Dendrosenecio adnivalis lives at altitudes of 3,000 to 3,800 meters (9,800 to 12,000 feet) on the Rwenzori Mountains with another giant groundsel, Dendrosenecio johnstonii. D. adnivalis more common on the wetter soils. On the Virunga Mountains groves of Senecio stanleyi (Dendrosenecio adnivalis) grow after the tree heaths (Erica sp.) in clearings along with Lobelia wollastonii until the altitude of 4,300 meters (14,000 feet) when vegetation becomes sparse. Synonyms The herbarium has all of the Dendrosenecio adnivalis specimens filed under Senecio johnstonii and indeed, one is probably a variety or subspecies of the other that adapted to live closer to water and on damper ground.

The feature stars Victor McLaglen, Robert Armstrong, and Louise Brooks. It was produced and distributed by the Fox Film Corporation, which later remade it as Goldie in 1931, with Spencer Tracy and Jean Harlow. A print of the 1928 movie exists at the George Eastman House and a DVD-R was released in 2002. Plot Spike (McLaglen) travels the world as the mate of a schooner. He has a little address book full of sweethearts, but everywhere he goes, he finds that someone has been there before him, leaving behind with each girl a heart- shaped charm with an anchor inscribed on it. In Central America, he takes a dislike to another sailor, Salami (Armstrong), but before they can settle their differences, they brawl with the police and are thrown in jail. Then Spike notices that Salami has a ring shaped like a heart with an anchor inscribed. He has finally found his nemesis. When they are released, they look for a private place to fight, but accidentally fall into the water. Oddly, Spike cannot swim, so when Salami rescues him, they become the best of friends. Inseparable, they sail the seas on the same ships. Just before they reach Marseille, Spike tells Salami he has finally saved enough money to buy a house and some horses, cows and chickens, but Salami scoffs at the idea. When they dock, Salami has to stay aboard due to a toothache and worries the Spike will get into trouble without him. At a carnival, Spike becomes entranced by the high diver \\"Mam'selle Godiva\\" (Brooks). When the barker signals her that Spike gave him the most money to watch her performance, she latches onto him. He is so in love with her that he asks her if she would like to settle down with him; she leads him on so she can get the rest of his money. When Spike first introduces Salami to her, Salami recognizes her. She was his girlfriend at Coney Island until he left her. She makes it clear that she would very much like to renew their relationship, but he is not interested, nor does he want to hurt Spike by telling him the truth. One night, she sends Spike on an errand so she can visit Salami, whom she finds asleep in bed. She tells him that she has gotten most of Spike's savings and is about to drop him. Salami refuses to take her back; he gets dressed and goes to a bar to get away from her. However, Spike returns to their lodgings and finds her there. He also spots Salami's unmade bed, so he assumes the worst. Meanwhile, Salami gets into a fight with two other sailors and yells for his friend's help. Spike knocks the two men out, then does the same to Salami. After thinking over all the fun they had together, however, he asks Salami if he betrayed him. When Salami says no, they become friends again.

Author Todd McCarthy wrote in his book Howard Hawks: The Grey Fox of Hollywood, that A Girl in Every Port is considered by film scholars to be the most important film of Hawks's silent career because it is his first film to introduce many of the Hawksian themes and characters that would continue until his final films. It was his first \\"love story between two men,\\" with two men bonding over their duty, skills and careers and considering their friendship to be more important than relationships with women. In his book Hawks on Hawks, Joseph McBride asked the director: \\"What is the reason for the running bit of business in A Girl in Every Port of one guy pulling the other guy‚Äôs finger?\\" Hawks replied: \\"You ever hit anybody hard? Your finger goes out of joint, and somebody takes it and pulls it back into joint. I hit Hemingway, and I broke the whole back of my hand. I wish it had just gone out of joint.\\" McBride asks him why he hit Hemingway, which Hawks replies: \\"He just said, Can you hit? I broke my whole hand. He laughed like hell, and he sat up all night making a splint out of a tomato can so that I could go shooting with him the next morning. It didn‚Äôt do my hand any good. It‚Äôs an absolutely different shape.\\" McBride then asks of Hawks: \\"Was the finger business in A Girl in Every Port supposed to be a gesture of friendship? You used it again with Kirk Douglas and Dewey Martin in The Big Sky.\\" Hawks stated, \\"Oh, it‚Äôs just like Wayne rolling cigarettes for Dean Martin. One thing you can do is look at all the pictures I‚Äôve ever made, and you‚Äôll see that nobody pats another on the back. That‚Äôs the goddamnedest inane thing I‚Äôve ever known.\\" Coast Guard officers at Fox Theater in Washington D.C. (c. 1928) =Semper Paratus= During the film's run at the Fox Theater in Washington D.C., a detachment of 50 Coast Guard officers were recruited to appear at the theater for the inauguration of Semper Paratus, the official song of the U.S. Coast Guard. The song had recently been written by an officer and adopted by Admiral Frederick C. Billard, Commandant of the Coast Guard. The officers appeared at each performance during the rendition of the song. =Versions= The 78-minutes currently available version omits chapters with girls in Liverpool, a South Sea Island, Singapore and Bombay. These girls are mentioned in some reviews and publicity. Reviews and reception Swiss writer Blaise Cendrars said the film \\"definitively marked the first appearance of contemporary cinema\\", and that the movie represented the first of Hawks' \\"buddy films\\". A reviewer for The New York Times praised the film saying, \\"the incidents are set forth in a rollicking fashion with none other than the towering Victor McLaglen filling the part of Madden...Robert Armstrong‚Äôs acting of the part of Salami is natural. He gives you a good idea of the fearlessness of the individual.\\" VarietyA Girl in Every Port, Variety, December 31, 1927. compares the friendship to that of Damon and Pythias. The Film Daily reported in March 1928 that the feature had broke the \\"world's record\\" for a single day's box office receipts at the Roxy Theater in New York, when it grossed $29,463.00 on Washington's Birthday. An exhibitor from Michigan wrote in the Exhibitor's Herald that, \\"the salesman said that this was a good picture when he sold it to me...time must have rotted it for it is one of the smuttiest pictures on the market. If you want to promote immorality, by all means play this one. I have to use care and precaution in the selection of pictures, and this one brought plenty of criticism\\".

His wife Sindhu is an employee at the LSG department and he is the father of five children ‚Äì Liya Maria, Diya Ann, Evana Elza, Joseph Kurian and Catherine Rebecca. Eby J Jose is the son of Pala Moolayilthottathil Baby Joseph and Ammini. History The journeys of Eby J. Jose are always through the paths less traversed by politician and social workers. Invoking public conscience against social issues ignored by rulers and officials has been his passion for the last 21 years. \\"None of us are bothered about our responsibilities to the Indian Constitution though we are fond of making incessant lectures on the merits and demerits of the Constitution,'‚Äô says Eby. He has every right to say that, attests several legal battles initiated by Eby to protect the basic principles of Indian Constitution. Eby uses all available sources including media to create awareness among people on the responsibilities of a citizen to our Constitution. He organised many such movements, both successful and unsuccessful. =Credentials= A student politician-turned-journalist and social worker, Eby has to his credit the titles of several magazines like Pala Times, Kera Sabdam, Information Today, India Monitor and Dil Se. At present, he is editing the monthly Gulf Life. To strengthen his fights, Eby had joined some organisations and organised some movements. National Unity Front, Rajiv Gandhi Peace Foundation, Catholic Youth Council of India, Cheriyan J Kappan Foundation, Anti Narcotic Movement of India and Small Scale Farmers' Federation served as suitable platforms for Eby to raise various demands. When the film stars in Kerala formed an organisation called 'AMMA', Eby retaliated with an organisation of viewers called 'AMMAYI'. He is now serving as the chairman of Mahatma Gandhi National Foundation. =Political activism= His determination to fight against vices was seen during the campaigns against drugs, pan masala, single digit lottery and for creating AIDS awareness. Kottayam and Delhi were the locations for these campaigns. Stance against Padma award for celebrities The campaign initiated by Eby against awarding Padma honours to film stars and sports stars had invited the attention of national media. \\"Padma awards have been instituted to honour the great sons of India who give rich contribution to the development of the country. We can't include film and cinema stars in these category. They do their work by accepting handsome remuneration. Many of them do not even pay tax and don't even know the value of a Padma award,'‚Äô says Eby. He had already written to the President of India and Prime Minister requesting not to give Padma award to film and sports personalities in future. Support for Prohibition Eby's protest against a recent liquor advertisement by Padmasree award winner and actor Mohanlal was hot news for national and international media. '\`Prohibition is part of the directive principles listed in Indian Constitution. But, this Padma awardee had acted in a liquor commercial by accepting remuneration worth Crores. We have requested him to refrain from the ad for the sake of morality but of no avail,'‚Äô explains Eby. According to the sections of Prohibition Act ‚Äì 1950, promoting liquor is a crime. My argument was based on that but he didn't pay heed to it. Even the reports in international media like BBC and CNN could not prevent him from doing that ad, says Eby. Eby wrote to Mohanlal's parents and wife requesting them to correct their beloved. '\`The government has removed the ads from KSRTC buses and directed to remove the hoardings on road. Now the company displays the same ad for a chips brand. Can you buy the chips manufactured by that company from anywhere in the world?'‚Äô asks Eby, who vows that he will continue campaigning against the Superstar's anti social policies. He says even Mohanlal's new movie Hello promotes the habit of drinking. On the contrary, Eby had a sweet experience from the distributors of Rajanikanth's latest movie Sivaji in Kerala. The initial posters of Sivaji carried the ad of a liquor brand. Eby wrote to Johny Sagarika, who had the distribution rights in Kerala and the agency withdrew those posters and issued fresh ones. You may remember the shocking visuals aired by Surya TV some years back that portrayed a man being drowned by another in Padmatheertha pond in Thiruvananthapuram. The visual also showed police men and fire force personnel with disgust. Moved by the visuals, Eby wrote a letter to the High Court. Justice Sankara Subban and Justice Lakshmykkutty Amma registered a petition based on that letter. They ordered to give a compensation of Rs. One lakh to the victim's family. It was a rare case, in which one who has no relation to the victim had approached the Court and secured a favourable order. Campaign against Union Ministers Eby is also leading a battle against Union Ministers including the Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh. According to him, these ministers reached the cabinet through the back door, that is through Rajya Sabha, without facing the public directly. He sees this as a bid on the life of democracy. \\"When a candidate who lost the polls becomes the Minister, the one who had defeated him waits in the queue to meet him. This is irony,'‚Äô explains Eby. Campaign for proper use of the national flag If you ask him which is his masterpiece campaign, Eby will point his finger to a well kept and clean national flag in his room. For the past 15 years, this young man has been engaged in relentless fight to ensure that the tri colour always flown high. '\`It all started accidentally. Once I got an opportunity to travel with then Minister A.C. Shanmukhadas. In the evening, the driver took the national flag from the bonnet of the car neatly wrapped it and kept inside. I asked what was wrong in keeping it there,'‚Äô says Eby about the birth his most dedicated campaign. Das told him that the national flag could only be used during day time, after the sun rise and before the sun set. That was a new piece of knowledge to him. He began to collect all the details about our national flag like its history and the rules to be followed while using the flag. His sharp eyes soon began to detect the misuse of national flag in and around. The flags put on tables at the meeting of some social organisations, plastic ones, those with heads down, the flags in which slogans are printed. He collected a number of evidences and approached the High Court with a petitition, admitted by then Chief Justice A.R. Lakshman. Four days ahead of our 53rd Independence Day, Justice Radhakrishnan reminded all cititzens about the greatness of the tri color and the code of conduct to be observed while handling the flag. From ace motorist Narain Karthikeyan to the architects of Tamil movie 'Annian'. many careless citizens had to taste Eby's legal notices that are intended to educate them about the national flag. Recently, Babu M Pallissery MLA withdrew the national flag from his web page after an alert from Eby. The latest errant is the optical firm Essilor India Private Limited. After reading a letter sent by Eby, the company withdrew its advertisement featuring tri colour printed on the eyelids of a model. He has recently launched a project'Mission Flag' to create awareness among school children about the National flag. He targets to reach 10000 schools in five-year with this message. Eby J Jose with Hon'ble President of India Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam (2005) Mission Flag Campaign Eby J. Jose have undertaken this nationally important campaign named Mission Flag The National Flag (flag) is a symbol of the Nation's respect and pride. There is a liberal use of the flag on Independence Day and Republic day. The duty of every individual to maintain proper respect of the National Flag. From this point of view the following dos & donts will prove useful. Do's and Don'ts Hoist the Flag at a height in a suitable manner. Do not let small children use the National Flag as a toy. Do not use or buy plastic Flags. Do not use paper Flags to pin up on shirt pockets, etc. Take care to see that the Flag does not get crumpled. Do not use the Flag as a banner or for decoration. Take care to see that the National Flag is not trampled upon or torn. Do not let the Flag fall on the ground. Do not join cloth pieces to resemble the National Flag. As a part of this campaign ‚Äì 1.)Mahatma Gandhi National Foundation is attempting to educate children in various schools, putting up appeals for display in public places and on notice boards, so also attempting to reach maximum people through the medium of Internet. 2.)The Foundation has also appealed to people through the newspapers to implement the above measures. 3.) The Foundation has met the President of India and has demanded that strict action be taken in cases of insult to the National Flag.

Responsible Citizen Zee News ‚Äì \\"Hum Bharat Ke Log; Kartavye Nibhayein, Rashtra Banayein\\" initiative launched on 2 October 2011, in association with Ministry of Youth Affairs (NYKS & NSS) is a unique campaign with an objective of invoking people's thought on the importance of performing their duties for building up the Nation and motivating them to own up their dutiesand act in accordance.As per this campaign Eby J. Jose selected as Responsible Citizen.(See item no.9) School of rights and duties Eby J. Jose has proposed to set up a free school to instruct citizens on the rights guaranteed by the Constitution and their duties to the nation. Named as \\"School of rights and duties\\", the facility would offer three-month courses to the candidates on the rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution and the duties expected of them as responsible citizens. A study conducted by Mahatma Gandhi National Foundation has found that a majority of people are not sufficiently aware of their Constitutional rights. This results in exploitation of the majority by a privileged minority. If citizens are properly instructed of their rights, they could, to a great extent, resist exploitation. ‚ÄùSimilarly, it is important for responsible citizens to be conscious of their duties to the nation. In our formal educational syllabus, these basic issues are often not given due importance. Ours is a modest beginning to overcome these lacunae,\\" Eby J.Jose,director of the venture, said. Even many of those young persons who choose political and social careers were not adequately aware of these aspects and this was the cause for lack proper perspective in their approach. Published Book Eby J Jose with K.R.Narayanan,President of India(2002) Eby J. Jose has written a biography of the late president under the title K.R.Narayanan Bharathathinte Suryathejassu. It is written in Malayalam, in the mother tongue of Dr.K.R. Narayanan. This book traces the not-so-rosy paths through which this great man had to travel. Documentary film K R Narayanan Foundation (KRNF) is producing a documentary film (both in Malayalam and English) on the life of K R Narayanan, title THE FOOTPRINTS OF SURVIVAL, aimed at propagating the ideals and perpetuating the memory of K. R. Narayanan. This documentary film will be directed by Mr.Sunny Joseph, a senior journalist. The script would be based on a biography of the late President written by Eby J. Jose, who is also General Secretary of the K R Narayanan Foundation. The Foundation has planned to distribute the DVD copies of the creative work to all schools, colleges and public libraries.

It was notable for being the country's first local high-definition TV channel. It was owned and operated by ABS-CBN's subsidiary ABS-CBN Cable Channels. The network shows notable sports broadcasts from the Philippines and abroad, as well as other sports related programming. Its local programming were produced and licensed by ABS-CBN Sports. Background Balls was officially launched on 1 January 2008, the same day that fellow ABS-CBN subsidiary Sky Cable dropped the channels of Solar Entertainment Corporation (including the sports channels Solar Sports and Basketball TV) from its lineup. These channels were replaced by a group of new channels owned by ABS-CBN's subsidiary Creative Programs Inc. (now ABS-CBN Cable Channels), which include Maxxx and Velvet. While SkyCable officials stated that the channels were being replaced to reduce redundancy in SkyCable's lineup and introduce new programming to the service, reports surfaced that the two companies had failed to reach a carriage deal since ABS-CBN had accused Solar of cannibalizing the revenue of its over-the- air networks. Some reports says that the dispute has to do with Manny Pacquiao's exclusive contract with ABS-CBN's main competitor GMA Network, which Solar has partnered for free TV airing of its boxing matches. Although Balls was intended to effectively replace it, Basketball TV was restored to the SkyCable lineup in time for the 2008‚Äì09 NBA season in October 2008, and other Solar channels also returned to the lineup afterward. It was announced that Balls and Balls HD will cease their broadcast on 31 December 2015. Its HD channel, as well as the entire channel's content (except the Ultimate Fighting Championship which the broadcast rights was acquired by TV5's sports division, Sports5) will be absorbed to the Sports + Action brand and renamed as ABS-CBN Sports + Action HD.http://www.mysky.com.ph/Cebu/updates/277/2015/12/15/balls- to-cease-airing The last program to air on this channel was a replay of UFC 194: Aldo vs. McGregor on 31 December 2015 before signing off at 12:00 a.m. midnight on 1 January 2016. Cable providers still receiving Balls would see an imaging card that reads \\"Balls is now signing off\\" until the provider can replace it with another channel, while other providers like Sky Cable (in Metro Manila and in select metropolitan and large cities) have replaced this channel with a reserved channel or with another channel. High-definition feed On 11 July 2009, the channel launched its own high-definition feed on Sky Cable, marking the Philippines' first ever local high-definition television channel. On the same day, Balls also televised the country's first locally produced programs in HD, which included a UAAP college basketball game, followed by an NCAA game the following Monday, all produced by ABS-CBN Sports using the recently acquired Sony high-definition professional video cameras and a state-of-the-art HD OB van with technologies developed by EVS Broadcast Equipment, Snell, and Avid Technology. Balls HD was in hibernation from December 28, 2009 until 2013. Programming Balls' initial lineup focused on ball sports such as football, basketball, golf, tennis, and volleyball (as suggested by its name). Also Balls aired 2 of 4 Tennis Grand Slam Tournament which is French Open (2008‚Äì2013; transferred to Fox Sports Asia) and US Open (2007‚Äì2015). Balls later expanded its lineup to include boxing, UFC MMA events, WWE programs, and the 2011 Southeast Asian Games. It also carries all the matches of FIFA World Cup which is exclusively licensed to ABS-CBN Sports. While originally airing only foreign events since its inception, Balls began to air domestic events produced by ABS-CBN Sports in 2009, beginning with NCAA Season 85 and UAAP Season 72.

History The predecessor to the Order of the Dogwood, called the Dogwood Medallion, was created by the provincial government in 1958 to mark the centennial of the establishment of the Colony of British Columbia. The Order of the Dogwood was created by Order in Council during a provincial Cabinet meeting held at Fort Langley on November 19, 1966 to mark the centennial of the union of the Colony of British Columbia with the Colony of Vancouver Island. Immediately following the Cabinet meeting, Lieutenant Governor George Pearkes (a future recipient of the honour) gave consent to the creation of the honour, which was then presented to the first recipients at the \\"Douglas Day\\" dinner that ensued. The first five recipients were Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, Viscount Amory (then Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company), Sir Robert Bellinger (then Lord Mayor of London), Clarence Wallace, and Frank Mackenzie Ross; Bellinger and Ross were present for the ceremony. The Order of the Dogwood was the highest provincial honour until 1989, when it was replaced by the Order of British Columbia. The last person granted the Order of the Dogwood was Terry Fox, who received it in 1980. The award The granting of the award was not limited to British Columbia residents. The award could not be granted to a person currently holding public office under the authority of the province. Recipients received a medal struck in gold, bearing the image of the dogwood flower on one side and the provincial coat of arms on the other. Recipients also received a certificate issued under the Great Seal of British Columbia.

The convoy was escorted by private military contractors. The ambush ended with the death of all the contractors. Ambush On May 9, 2005, a supply convoy left the U.S. military air base at Al Asad, Iraq. The convoy was escorted by 12 Iraqi, 4 South African and 1 Japanese private military contractor. Almost immediately after they exited the base they were observed by Iraqi insurgents. The insurgents then prepared a well planned ambush for the convoy. While the vehicles were passing near the city of Hit, 170 kilometers northwest of Baghdad, the insurgents struck. The ambush was complex and well planned, incorporating the use of multiple improvised explosive devices, rocket propelled grenades, machine gun fire and small arms fire. The vehicles got stuck in the ambush and couldn't pull back. For several hours a fierce battle raged and by morning the convoy was decimated. U.S. military helicopters arrived at the scene only after dawn broke. Insurgent propaganda footage showed burning trucks and SUV's with bodies littering the streets. 16 of the 17 security contractors were killed and the Japanese man was seriously wounded and captured. Insurgent casualties, if any, were unknown. Aftermath Following the attack there was much confusion over what really happened, but the only thing definitely confirmed was that a Japanese security contractor was wounded and captured in the attack. Akihiko Saito was seriously wounded in the attack and captured by the insurgents. This raised the public debate in Japan to new heights whether Japanese troops should stay in Iraq or leave. Saito had been in the Japanese military until 1981, when he left the Japanese Self-Defense Forces and joined the French Foreign Legion. He had been working with Hart Security Ltd. as a security specialist at the time of his capture. The militants tried to provide him with medical aid but it was not enough. It was reported on May 12 that he had died of his wounds. They were not all killed. A South African made his way to a combat outpost called the B/U split. From there Marines mounted tracks and went to the ambush site. It was still light out when we mounted the tracks. There were no insurgents on site, but we disarmed another IED that was left under one of the bodies, and collected all of the KIA's. We did go back in the morning again to see if we could gather anymore intel and to set a counter ambush once we pulled out. One Iraqi truck driver escaped and picked up one of Hart Security's Iraqi personnel making his way back to the Abu Ghraib Distribution center. Later debriefings at the Distribution center established that Akihiko Saito was killed by a bullet to the back of his head while attemptingRichard L. Stewart present at debriefing to fight his way out of the ambush.

Biography  He was born in Versailles, the son of Alexandre Henry Lefuel (1782-1850), an entrepreneurial speculative builder established in the town of Versailles, who was admitted to the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in 1829; there he studied with Jean-Nicolas Huyot and in 1833 he received second place in the Prix de Rome competition. A winner of the Prix de Rome in 1839, he spent the years 1840 to 1844 as a pensionary of the French Academy in Rome at the Villa Medici. On his return to France he opened his own practice and was appointed an inspector for the Chambre des d√©put√©s. Having carried out alterations as the Ch√¢teau de Meudon (1848) and for the housing of the Manufacture Royal de Porcelaine de S√®vres (1852), he was appointed chief architect of the Ch√¢teau de Fontainebleau, one of the main seats of Napoleon III and the Second French Empire; there he designed a new Imperial theatre (1853-1855). He was elected to the Acad√©mie des beaux-arts in 1855, taking the chair of Martin-Pierre Gauthier. He was made a chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1854, and a Commander of the Legion in 1857. Pavillon de Flore, north facade At the same time Lefuel was placed in charge of the ambitious project of completing the Louvre, following the death of the architect Louis-Tullius-Joachim Visconti in 1853. Adjusting and enriching Visconti's project he completed the project, one of the showpieces of the Second Empire. Lefuel produced the Salle des √âtats in the extended northern wing facing the Place du Palais-Royal (containing the Ministry of Finance and the library, opened in 1857, the southern extension of the Galerie du Bord de l'Eau, with the Pavillon Lesdigu√®res and the Pavillon Tr√©moille.) Aiding Lefuel was the young American architect Richard Morris Hunt, who had studied under Lefuel at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. Following Hunt's graduation, Lefuel made Hunt inspector of the Louvre work and allowed him to design the facade of the Pavillon de la Biblioth√®que.The Harvard Graduates' Magazine, Vol. I, William Roscoe Thayer, Published by the Harvard Graduates' Magazine Association, Printed by the Riverside Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1893 Lefuel's work at the Pavillon de Flore which had been begun under Visconti was to the order of Napol√©on III, who in 1861 authorized its remodeling. The renovation, performed between 1864 and 1868, added significant detail and sculpture to the work, which is thus noted as an example of Second Empire Neo-Baroque architecture as much as it is of the late sixteenth century. After the Tuileries Palace was destroyed by fire in 1871, Lefuel added a north facade, similar in design to his south facade, in 1874-1879.Aulanier 1971, pp. 91‚Äì93. For the Empress Eug√©nie, Lefuel created sumptuous apartments in the Palais des Tuileries, lost when that palace burned in the Paris Commune of 1871. Lefuel's grave at Passy Cemetery Lefuel also designed and erected the h√¥tel particulier of Achille Fould, Minister of Finance under Napol√©on III, and that of the museum director √âmilien de Nieuwerkerke (the H√¥tel de Nieuwekerke in Parc Monceau) and the H√¥tel √âmonville in Abbeville. He designed funeral monuments, such as that to the composers Daniel-Fran√ßois-Esprit Auber and Fran√ßois Bazin at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery. For the Paris Exposition of 1855 he built the temporary Palais des Beaux-Arts et de l'Industrie. His palace in Louis XIII style at Neudeck (≈öwierklaniec), Polish Silesia, built in 1868-1872, the grandest of three residences there of the Donnersmarcks, was burnt out in 1945 and demolished in 1961. Hector Lefuel died in Paris and is buried at Passy Cemetery.Kirkland, Stephanie (22 December 2011). \\"Paris Places: Passy Cemetery. Retrieved 4 March 2014.

Stuart (May 9, 1819-August 13, 1880) was a California pioneer and delegate to the California Constitutional Convention of 1878-79, where he distinguished himself as the only delegate to speak out in defense of the rights of Chinese immigrants. Life =In Pennsylvania and New York= Stuart was born in Nippenose Township, Pennsylvania, and worked on his father's farm until the age of 14, when he was enrolled at Owego Academy in what is now Tioga, New York, where he studied under the educational reformer Charles Rittenhouse Coburn. After graduating, Stuart moved to Ithaca, New York, where he began work as a merchant. In 1839, Stuart took a grand tour of the United States and in 1842, married Ellen Mary Tourtellot. The Stuarts had three children while living in the east: Robert H. Stuart (d. 1878), Mary (Stuart) Pickett, and Emily (Stuart) Stangroom. =In California= Inspired by the California Gold Rush, Stuart led the first mule train‚Äîcalled the \\"Ithaca Company\\"--to California, beginning from Independence, Missouri and traveling along the Arkansas River to the Rocky Mountains, and then to Salt Lake City, where after a brief recuperation, the expedition traveled to the Cajon Pass, near what is now Rancho Cucamonga, California. From there, the travelers headed to Los Angeles, the San Fernando Valley, and San Joaquin, California, where the members separated to find their own way. Stuart headed to San Francisco, where he arrived on November 20, 1849. In San Francisco, Stuart and partners I.N. Thorne and John Center began farming of land in the vicinity of the Mission Dolores. They constructed a house and dug a canal several hundred feet long to accommodate boats on the nearby creek. Shortly afterwards, Stuart and business partner Robert T. Ridley established a tavern on the site, called the \\"Mansion House.\\" The tavern (located on the site now occupied by the basilica) was successful, and Stuart continued operating it after Ridley's death in 1851. Stuart was able to afford to build San Francisco's first brick house on the corner of 16th and Capp Streets. By the mid-1850s, Stuart was living there with his wife, son Charles Duff Stuart (b. 1854), and daughters Antoinette (Stuart) Vermehr (b. 1856), Ida (Stuart) Sessions (b. 1859) and Isabel (Stuart) Dennis (b. 1863). Stuart was elected to San Francisco's first Board of Aldermen and ran for a seat in the state assembly in 1854. He tried to lease the New Almaden quicksilver mine‚Äîthe state's most financially successful mine‚Äîbut sold his interest in the mine to escape the extremely complicated litigation over its ownership. In 1859, Stuart purchased a part of the Rancho Agua Caliente land grant in Sonoma County and in 1868 began building a house there, eventually establishing a vineyard he named Glen Ellen after his wife. The town that grew up around the vineyard also came to be called Glen Ellen, and Stuart's home was later renamed Glen Oaks Ranch. In 1878, when California held its second constitutional convention, Stuart was elected as a delegate on the non- partisan ticket. He spoke rarely in the Convention, most notably in two impassioned speeches defending the rights of Chinese immigrants against various discriminatory provisions proposed by the convention delegates. The first of these speeches occurred on December 9, 1878, in opposition to proposals to ban Chinese immigrants from owning property in the state, or from being employed by any state corporation. Again, on February 1, 1879, when the convention was finalizing the Constitution's language, Stuart spoke against such provisions, declaring, > Give to the children of these people (and some of them native born) the > privilege of our common schools in return for the school taxes they pay; > cease persecuting them by personal assault, to which the law is blind; stop > this disgraceful special legislation against them; stop this relentless, > heartless, and inhuman persecution of foreigners...and then, and only then, > will we do our duty. What right has the State to exact of these men poll and > other school taxes, and then legislate against them, prohibiting their > children the privilege of her common schools? Why pass and continue to pass > arbitrary and oppressive laws against them? Why does the State fail to > protect them from murder, arson, and outrage? I charge the city of San > Francisco with cowardice in not protecting them in the exercise of their > rights of \\"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,\\" which all men are > guaranteed under our flag; while they have collected millions of dollars in > taxes, licenses, and otherwise, yet they furnish them no protection in > return. They pass cruel ordinances against them; they harass and annoy them > through every device the law can invent, and why are similar outrages heaped > upon them in nearly every county, town, village, or hamlet in this state? > Tell me; tell me; oh, tell me, why they are not protected like others in > their honest toil? Or is this to be the final sum of all villainy? In case > the outrages on these people do not cease in this state, and it refuses > longer to protect them, then I call upon our Government to give them the > ballot, that they may protect themselves. If it does not, then I demand the > repeal of all naturalization laws, and to modify all immigration laws, with > other nations, under the treaty making power. Although Stuart was ridiculed and attacked for this speech, the convention failed to approve the provisions to which he objected, and many of the later laws enacted restricting the rights of the Chinese were declared unconstitutional by federal courts. Nevertheless, persecution of the Chinese worsened over the next half-century in California and other west coast states. Death After Stuart's death in 1880, his wife Ellen Stuart continued to operate the vineyard. She banded together with two other widows who petitioned the Sonoma County Superior Court for the right to operate their businesses as ‚Äúsole traders,‚Äù the designation needed to legally conduct business in the state as women. Their son, Charles Duff Stuart, became an author, publishing a novel, Casa Grande, in 1906. The Stuart home, Glen Oaks Ranch, is still standing in Glen Ellen, California.

Kaul. It features Karan Nath, Dino Morea and Tanisha in the lead roles. It was produced by Sunil Mehta and Prem Kishen. The music was directed by Anu Malik. The movie was heavily inspired by the 1996 Hollywood thriller Scream. The movie did average business. It is the debut movie of actress Tanishaa Mukerji. Plot Late one night, Malini Gujral and her boyfriend Sunny are brutally murdered while playing Squash on their college campus by a killer in a clown mask. Six months later in Shimla, Malini's younger sister Mahek is shopping for art supplies and runs into police inspector Kamat Uncle. He tells her there is no progress in the search for her sister's killer, as no evidence was left behind. He warns her that killers like this lie in wait before their next attack, and advises her to take care. While at the register, the phone rings and Mahek answers. The caller addresses Mahek by name and introduces himself as Malini's killer. Mahek frantically looks around and sees a young man walking away from a pay phone from the back of the store, he comes closer to her, apparently holding a large knife, similar to the clown-masked killer. She screams and covers her eyes, but the man has no knife and he was following her to return her purse. The next day at Simon College, she runs into the young man while hanging out with her friends Rocky, Gehna, Rajat, Rhea and Nikhil. He introduces himself as Suraj Rai, and says he is new to the campus from Delhi. Rocky is the jokester of the group and likes to bunk classes. Suraj and Mahek head off to their psychology class and it's obvious Rocky is jealous and in love with Mahek. While preparing for gym class, Mahek expresses her concern of the incident of the phone call, and Gehna brushes it off. As Mahek is left alone in the locker room, the killer's voice comes over the loudspeaker calling her name. The principal announces not to worry, as someone played a cheap joke while out of his office. Whilst Mahek is picking up her makeup that she dropped, the clown-masked killer comes up behind her with a knife. Mrs. Roy enters the room and the killer is gone. Mahek leaves and Mrs. Roy continues to rant about the prankster from earlier. She hears a man's cough from one of the stalls. Thinking it's a girl and boy together, she starts to open each stall. As she gets to the third stall, it won't open. She peers into a slight opening and the killer stabs her in the eye. Students crowd around as the investigation of Mrs. Roy's death presses on. There is a bloody shoe print at the scene of the crime, but no other evidence. Kamat Uncle is there and advises the principal that his students are not safe as this is the second incident in 6 months. The inspectors believe it is the work of a serial killer. Mahek approaches Kamat Uncle and tells him about the phone call she received. Rocky is chatting with Nikhil and Suraj, making jokes about how he's escaped having to take the psychology exam tomorrow and Kamat Uncle overhears and becomes suspicious and starts questioning where Rocky was, and what his shoe size is. Rocky claims to have been at home an hour earlier and just got to campus. But Rocky's feet are bigger than the prints at the scene, eliminating him as a suspect. Rocky tells the inspector to question newer students, pointing to Suraj. Suraj becomes nervous when his shoe size matches the footprint. Kamat Uncle dismisses it and suggests that they wait for the post-mortem report. Mahek starts to avoid Rocky and apologizes to Suraj for his behavior. Suraj shares about his close relationship with his father, and Mahek has flashbacks to when her dad left her family. Upset, she runs away without explanation. At home she is comforted by her mom, who explains she is going away for an art convention in Delhi. She is worried about leaving Mahek, even though it is just for 3 hours. Later that night, she hears a noise thinking her mom is back from Delhi. She finds a window unlocked and realizes she's in her house with the killer. During the pursuit she notices an orange watch on the killer's wrist. She manages to alert Kamat Uncle of her attack and is able to fight the killer, who escapes through a window before the police arrive. She runs outside and Suraj is out there. Initially she rushes into his arms, but she notices the same orange watch on his wrist. Kamat Uncle arrives and Inspector Rathod finds the clown mask and robe in the bushes nearby. Her mom arrives as Suraj is being arrested. Rocky is throwing a party and is desperate for Mahek to attend. She is convinced by Gehna and her mom to go to the party to get her mind off the attack. Mahek goes to the party but is less than enthusiastic. Eventually she leaves, and on the foggy drive home. Gehna is venting and blaming Rocky for being insensitive, but Mahek defends him. She receives a call on her mobile from the killer. She is terrified, because Suraj is currently in jail. Suddenly, the killer appears in the middle of the road, causing Gehna to lose control of the car and crash into a shallow river. Gehna is unconscious and Mahek climbs her way out and begins to scream for help. The killer comes out from the water and grabs her trying to drown her. Suraj arrives and begins to fight the killer. It turns out he had an alibi and was working with Principal Aneja that evening. Kamat Uncle is also there. He has his gun out but doesn't have a good shot. The killer escapes into the fog and is shot by Kamat Uncle, and jumps into the river. The police are unsuccessful in recovering the killer's body and Mahek is back at home. She makes amends with Suraj, but continues to have visions of the killer, despite her assuming he is dead. She has a breakdown in front of Gehna and her friends decide that they need to go on holiday. They decide on going to Thailand. After staying in Thailand, they go to an island and get trapped. They realise that there is no escaping death now as they are trapped the island with the killer. The group all argue over who amongst them can't be trusted. Mahek is turned against Rocky as suspicious circumstances continue to surround him. Rajat, Rhea, and Nikhil are all murdered. Kamat Uncle and Rathod arrive on the island and bring news of Mrs Gujral's murder. Kamat Uncle is killed, and the killer is shot by Suraj. When they remove the mask, it is Inspector Rathod. Rocky tries to implore Mahek to accept his love, and Suraj shoots him. It is at this point Suraj reveals his identity as the killer. It is also revealed that Rajat was not killed, but is alive. The killer is a duo. Suraj and Rajat are brothers. Their mother was raped by Mahek and Malini's estranged father, destroying their family after she committed suicide from the shame. Following their mother's suicide, their dad shot himself. For revenge, Suraj and Rajat killed Mr. Gujral first, followed by Malini, then Mrs. Gujral and need to claim Mahek's life to repay the debt owed for her father ruining their lives. Rocky is able to regain enough strength to shoot Suraj and Rajat and save Mahek from the same fate as her family. Ultimately Suraj dies at the hands of Mahek, who stabs him after his gunshot wound proves to be nonfatal. Rocky and Mahek ride back to the mainland on a boat in each other's arms. Reception The film did average business after getting a good opening as it fared much better than pinjar and inteha. Karan Nath was nominated for this film by Stardust Awards for his performance in 2004.

History = 1970s = The band was formed in 1977 when Bob Pfeifer met Myrna Marcarian at Syracuse University. They spent that summer back in Cleveland, where Pfeifer grew up. They, along with drummer Ron Metz, recorded an EP of four songs, enlisting David Thomas of Pere Ubu to mix the tapes. The EP was self-released during that fall. The band next recorded their \\"I Gotta Know\\" single for Akron's Clone Records during a spring break in 1978. By this time, Pfeifer and Metz had moved to Columbus to attend The Ohio State University. Marcarian soon followed after her year at Syracuse and the band re-formed as a three piece. After the school year ended, the band started playing shows, with its first in the basement of local Columbus High Street record store Magnolia Thunderpussy. Soon after the summer of 1978, the band moved back to Cleveland briefly and then opened a used record store in Kent, Ohio. This store was to provide support for the band, which it did for the following three years. In the next few months, the band started playing shows in the area and gained followings in the Kent, Akron, Dayton, Columbus, Detroit and Pittsburgh regions. In 1979, the band recorded its next single at one of the better Cleveland studios named SUMA. With the help of Kent's famed The Numbers Band (15-60-75), they recorded their next single 'Prime of My Life / In My Room', later to be released on the band's own Square label. After the release of the single, the band met bass player Dave Schramm who helped round out the sound. Shortly thereafter, they were invited to play at Hurrah, the premier new wave night club in New York City. The club was impressed enough with the sound that they invited them back to play regularly. At the same time, the band also started playing other legendary clubs such as Maxwell's in Hoboken, NJ, The Rat in Boston, and the 9:30 Club in Washington, DC (even though the club did not exist until 1980). They continued playing more dates in New York with a new bass player George Scott III, formerly of the 8 Eyed Spy, James White and the Blacks and The Raybeats. The East Coast was becoming very friendly to them, but they still lacked a major record release. At this time, a fan recorded and released a 'bootleg' with the band's blessing and help. The rough cassette recordings captured a couple of their exciting live shows in the Akron and Kent area. The 1,000 copies pressed sold quickly and their following was established. =1980s= In 1980, Rough Trade record company out of the UK took notice of the band and commissioned them to record a three track 12 inch single. The band went back to SUMA, this time with bass player Doug Morgan, and recorded two songs 'Who's Landing in My Hangar?' and 'I Can Walk Alone'. These two songs would then be backed with a re-release of 'In My Room' from the year before. The songs were recorded, but the label inexplicably recanted their offer at the last minute. Later that year, an IRS label subsidiary name Faulty Products signed the Human Switchboard to what was to become their only studio LP. It was aptly named 'Who's Landing in My Hangar'. The two tracks recorded for Rough Trade were included along with eight newer tunes. The bass playing chores on the new songs was shared among two players, Paul Hamann the studio engineer and the newest band member, Steve Calabria. The band toured briefly around the mid-west and east coast opening for Toots & the Maytals. It was an unusual mix of sounds, but the crowds appreciated the diverse styles of the tour and paid attention to the opening band. Human Switchboard also had become a resident fixture at New York's Danceteria night club where they would remain a feature act for the next couple of years. After the tour, the band settled into a routine of shows in friendly environments. They decided to close the store and move from Kent back to Cleveland, where they obtained an apartment in Coventry (an area made famous by Harvey Pekar). Musically, they began to experiment with more contemporary music structures. They sought out and enlisted Jared Michael Nickerson from Dayton, Ohio to play bass and offer inspiration towards the new sound they were after. Nickerson would become the band's final and longest tenured bass player. The beat straightened out. The bass lines became funkier and once again, the band tried to gain interest from the record companies. This is when they met John Stains from Polydor Records. Polydor was on a roll at that time with hits from bands like The Waitresses and was looking to expand upon the 'new wave' sound. John helped finance demos that the band recorded over a two-week stretch in December 1983. The Switchboard would set up on the stage of CBGBs during the afternoons and recorded a series of a dozen songs onto the club's 16-track machine. The recordings were fleshing out nicely when suddenly, the rug was pulled out from them as John was let go from the record company. Those were the last studio recordings the band ever made. One track from these recordings 'When Your Train Starts Slowing Down' was completed and released on a 1988 compilation named 'It's Hard to be Cool in an UnCool World' (I Wanna Records). During the band's remaining year and a half, they played regular shows at the Peppermint Lounge and CBGBs in New York, Maxwells in Hoboken and Gilleys in Dayton, Ohio. Human Switchboard finally broke up in the spring of 1985.

The plan was first published in Russia shortly after the dissolution of the USSR and was often quoted by prominent Russian politicians, journalists, and writers. The text originates from a work of fiction, a 1971 novel The Eternal Call (), by Anatoly Ivanov, where it is provided in the form of an exposition by one of the novel's villains, a Nazi collaborator. It was first published as a distinct \\"plan\\" and ascribed to Allen Dulles in a 1993 book by John (Snychov), Metropolitan of St. Petersburg and Ladoga.

A simple form lists Biblical words alphabetically, with indications to enable the inquirer to find the passages of the Bible where the words occur. Concordances may be for the original languages of the Biblical books, or (more commonly) they are compiled for translations. Latin Friars of the Dominican order invented the verbal concordance of the Bible. As the basis of their work they used the text of the Latin Vulgate, the standard Bible of the Middle Ages in Western Europe. The first concordance, completed in 1230, was undertaken under the guidance of Cardinal Hugo de Saint-Cher (Hugo de Sancto Charo), assisted by fellow Dominicans. It contained short quotations (see the Ms. Saint-Omer, Biblioth√®que municipale, 0028 Online access to the first page of the Concordance by Hugues de St. Cher) of the passages where a word was found. These were indicated by book and chapter (the division into chapters had recently been made by Stephen Langton) but not by verses, which Robert Estienne would first introduce in 1545. In lieu of verses, Hugo divided each chapter into seven almost equal parts, indicated by the letters of the alphabet, a, b, c, etc. Three English Dominicans (1250‚Äì1252) added the complete quotations of the passages indicated. Due to lack of space, present-day concordances do not aim for this completeness of quotation; it is likely, therefore, that the passages indicated were far fewer than those found in a complete concordance of today. The work was somewhat abridged, by retaining only the essential words of a quotation, in the 1310 concordance of Conrad of Halberstadt, another Dominican - his work obtained great success on account of its more convenient form. The first concordance to be printed appeared in 1470 at Strasburg, and reached a second edition in 1475. The larger work from which it was abridged was printed at Nuremberg in 1485. Another Dominican, John Stoicowic (also known as \\"John of Ragusa\\"), finding it necessary in his controversies to show the Biblical usage of nisi, ex, and per, which were omitted from the previous concordances, began (c. 1435) the compilation of nearly all the indeclinable words of Latin Scripture; the task was completed and perfected by others and finally added as an appendix to the concordance of Conrad of Halberstadt in the work of Sebastian Brant published at Basle in 1496. Brant's work was frequently republished and in various cities. It served as the basis of the concordance published in 1555 by Robert Estienne. Estienne added proper names, supplied omissions, mingled the indeclinable words with the others in alphabetical order, and gave the indications to all passages by verse as well as by chapter, bringing his work much closer to the present model of concordances. Since then many different Latin concordances have been published: 5 volume concordance to the Latin Vulgate Bible * Plantinus's \\"Concordanti√¶ Bibliorum juxta recognitionem Clementinam\\" (Antwerp, 1599), which was the first made according to the authorized Latin text; * \\"Repertorium Biblicum ... studio ... Patrum Ordinis S. Benedicti, Monasterii Wessofontani\\" (Augsburg, 1751) * \\"Concordanti√¶ Script. Sac.\\", by Dutripon, in two immense volumes, the most useful of all Latin concordances, which gives enough of every text to make complete sense (Paris, 1838; seventh ed. 1880)Online access to the concordance of Dutripon * an edition of the same by G. Tonini, at Prato, 1861, recognized as nearly complete * V. Coornaert's Concordantiae librorum Veteris et Novi Testamenti Domini Nostri Jesu Christi juxta Vulgatam editionem, jussu Sixti V, Pontificis Maximi, recognitam ad usum praedicatorum, intended for the use of preachers (Bruges, 1892) *the \\"Concordantiarum S. Scriptur√¶ Manuale\\", by H. de Raze, Ed. de Lachaud, and J.-B. Flandrin (13th ed., Paris, 1895), which gives rather a choice of texts than a complete concordance *\\"Concordantiarum Univers√¶ Scriptur√¶ Sacr√¶ Thesaurus\\", by Fathers Peultier, Etienne, and Gantois (Paris, 1902) Peter Mintert's \\"Lexicon Gr√¶co-Latinum\\" of the New Testament is a concordance as well as a lexicon, giving the Latin equivalent of the Greek and, in the case of Septuagint words, the Hebrew equivalent also (Frankfort, 1728). Hebrew The first Hebrew concordance (Me√Ør Netib) was the work of Isaac Nathan ben Kalonymus, begun in 1438 and finished in 1448. It was inspired by the Latin concordances to aid in defence of Judaism, and was printed in Venice in 1523. An improved edition of it by a Franciscan friar, Marius de Calasio, was published in 1621 and 1622 in four volumes. Both these works were several times reprinted, while another Hebrew concordance of the sixteenth century, by Elias Levita, said to surpass Nathan's in many respects, remained in manuscript. Nathan and Calasio arranged the words according to the Hebrew roots, the derivatives following simply according to the order in which they occur in the Hebrew books; the Buxtorfs, father and son, introduced order into the derivatives by a grammatical classification of the verbs and nouns. Their work (Basle, 1632) also contained many new words and passages previously omitted, and an appendix of all the Aramaic words in the Hebrew Bible; Baer's edition of Buxtorf (1847) added certain particles. F√ºrst's concordance (Leipzig, 1840) was for a long time the standard. It corrected Buxtorf and brought it nearer to completeness, printed all Hebrew words with the vowel- points, and perfected the order of the derivatives. Every word is explained in Hebrew and Latin. F√ºrst excludes, however, the proper nouns, the pronouns, and most of the indeclinable particles, and makes many involuntary omissions and errors; his classification of roots is, according to the Catholic Encyclopedia (1913), sometimes fanciful. \\"The Englishman's Hebrew and Chaldaic Concordance\\" (London, 1843; third edition, 1866) is still considered very useful by the same. A comprehensive Hebrew concordance is that of Salomon Mandelkern (Leipzig, 1896), who rectified the errors of his predecessors and supplied omitted references. Though his own work has been shown to be frequently imperfect, still it is almost complete. An abridged edition of it was published in 1900. A New Concordance of the Bible (full title A New Concordance of the Bible: Thesaurus of the Language of the Bible, Hebrew and Aramaic, Roots, Words, Proper Names Phrases and Synonyms) by Avraham Even- Shoshan is a concordance of the Hebrew text of the Hebrew Bible, first published in 1977. The source text used is that of the Koren edition of 1958. Greek Septuagint A page from the Hatch-Redpath Concordance The first was that of Conrad Kircher (Frankfort, 1607); Tromm's, published at Amsterdam, 1718, had reference not only to the Septuagint, but also to the versions of Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion. It remained the standard until it gave way to Edwin Hatch and Henry Adeney Redpath's \\"Concordance to the Septuagint and other Greek Versions of the Old Testament\\" (Oxford, 1892‚Äì97). This includes a concordance to the deutero-canonical books and the Old Testament Apocrypha, and to the remains of the versions which form part of Origen of Alexandria's Hexapla. The Hebrew equivalents of the Greek, when known, are also given. References to proper names are added in a supplement published in 1900. Bagster's \\"Handy Concordance to the Septuagint\\" (London, 1887) gives simply the references, without quotations. Greek New Testament The earliest concordances to the Greek New Testament are those of Birken or Betulius (Basle, 1546), Henry Estienne (Paris, 1594), and Erasmus Schmid (Wittenberg, 1638), whose work was twice revised and republished. During the latter half of the nineteenth century the standard New Testament concordance was that of Bruder (Leipzig, 1842; 4th ed., 1888). Its main defect is that it was practically based on the textus receptus, though it aims, in its latest editions to give also the chief variants. Moulton and Geden's Concordance to the Greek Testament, according to the text of Westcott and Hort, Tischendorf, and the English Revisers (Edinburgh and New York, 1897) includes all the marginal readings. In the case of a reading being in dispute among these authorities, the fact is pointed out. The Hebrew equivalents of all quotations in the N. T. are given; the relation of the Greek N. T. words to the Septuagint and other O. T. Greek versions, as well as to classical usage, is indicated. Two other concordances are The Englishman's Greek Concordance to the New Testament by G. V. Wigram (London, 1839, 2d ed. 1844), and Hudson's Critical Greek and English Concordance of the N. T. (Boston, 1875), which contains references to the chief variant readings. Syriac Charles Schaaf's \\"Lexicon Syriacum\\" (Leyden, 1709) practically serves the purpose of a concordance to the Peshito version. English The earliest concordances in English were published in the middle of the sixteenth century, the first by Thomas Gybson in 1535 (for the New Testament only), and the second in 1550 by John Marbeck. The most famous one, Cruden's Concordance was the work of Alexander Cruden. First published in 1738, it reached several editions in his own lifetime and has been re-edited, abridged and reprinted repeatedly. Cruden's work is not a complete concordance, and omits especially many references to proper names, but his last edition had a concordance to the deuterocanonical books of the Old Testament, which, however, is usually not reprinted. It was surpassed by three major concordances of the King James Version of the Bible, those of Robert Young, James Strong, and Walker. *Young's Analytical Concordance to the Bible (Edinburgh, 1879‚Äì84), an almost complete concordance, indicates the Hebrew, Chaldaic, or Greek original of the English word, and distinguishes the various meanings that may underlie the same word. *Strong's Concordance has reference only to the English text. It contains also a comparative concordance between the Authorized and Revised English versions, useful for a study of the changes introduced. *Walker's Comprehensive Concordance to the Holy Scriptures (Boston, 1894) is an almost complete concordance. A Complete Concordance to the Revised Version of the New Testamen, by J. A. Thoms, was published in London, 1884. These were followed by a concordance based on the Douay‚ÄìRheims translation of the Bible preferred by Roman Catholics, A Textual Concordance of the Holy Scriptures by Father Thomas David Williams, 1942. Contemporary use  Since software has made the Bible available in electronic form and with thorough electronic indexes, hard- copy printed concordances have less application. Most scholars and Bible students rely instead on software. Due to Strong's numbers (see Strong's Concordance) it became possible to translate concordances from one language into another. Thus, the Russian concordance of 30,000 words from the Russian Thompson Study Bible (\\"–ù–æ–≤–∞—è —É—á–µ–±–Ω–∞—è –ë–∏–±–ª–∏—è –¢–æ–º–ø—Å–æ–Ω–∞\\", La Buona Novella Inc, 2010, edition made by Christian society \\"The Bible for everyone\\", St.Petersburg, Russia) is a translation of the English concordance from Thompson Chain-Reference Bible (The New Thompson Study Bible. La Buona Novella Inc. & B.B.Kirkbride Bible Company, Inc., 2006). In the process of compiling the Russian concordance, the Hebrew/Greek word corresponding to the English concordance word was found, and then its Russian equivalent in the Russian Synodal translation of the Bible was added to the resulting Russian concordance text.

The Korean Empire had issued its first English-language passports to these immigrants the previous year. They travelled on the and landed in Hawaii. The passengers were a diverse group with various ages and backgrounds. Among the group were fifty- six men recruited as labourers for sugarcane plantations located on various islands in the Territory of Hawaii, as well as twenty-one women and twenty- five children. Within two years of the first arrival of Korean immigrants, the number of Koreans who had migrated to Hawaii had grown to more than 7,000.Chang and Patterson 2003, pp. vii-ix The Purpose of Korean immigration to America The very first large group of Korean Immigrants settled in America between 1901 and 1905. Between those years 7,226 immigrants, including 6,048 men, 637 women, and 541 children, came on 65 trips. Most of the early immigrants of that period had some contracts with American missionaries in Korea. For some Western-oriented Korean intellectuals, immigrating to the United States was considered useful, in part, to help them in the modernization of their homeland. Consequently, the recruiter for laborers for the Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association (HSPA), David Deshler, had no trouble finding Koreans from a wide range of social classes willing to sail to Hawaii.Chang and Patterson 2003 According to Dr. Wayne Patterson during his speech to the Royal Asiatic Society (posted on YouTube September 21, 2013) the transfer of Koreans to Hawaii was against the US Emigration Laws regarding foreign Contract Laborers. Deshler recruited Koreans as strikebreakers because Japanese laborers working in the Hawaiian plantations were on strike against the owners of the plantations. Some of the same American business people who overthrew the Hawaiian Monarchy were in collusion with Dr. Horace Allen and Deshler to conjure up a plan to get away with breaking the US Emigration Laws to deal with Japanese worker's strike problems. Most of the Koreans came to Hawaii from 1903 to 1905 through a money-laundering scam that paid for the boat passengers' fares from Korea to Hawaii, violating the law. In some cases, the Koreans were forced to pay back their fare money to the HSPA. Decades of new hope, hardships and barriers Within a century the Korean population in America exploded from roughly seven thousand to about two million.Chang and Patterson 2003, pp. 1-10 King Gojong (1852‚Äì1919) reigned in Korea at the time of the first migration to America and played a crucial part in the lives of Koreans abroad. Christian missionaries had found their way to Korea during King Gojong's reign. By the 1890s, American missionaries were the most influential in spreading Christianity in Korea. Dr. Horace Allen, missionary- turned-diplomat, was embroiled in Korean politics and in effect was the representative for American trade. The missionaries brought not only Christianity, but also capitalism, Western learning, and Western culture. Many of the immigrants had converted to Christianity. Protestant evangelism in Korea was predominantly Methodist and Presbyterian. The two Protestant groups decided not to overlap their evangelizing activities. They agreed that the Methodist mission in Hawai'i would minister to the Korean immigrants. Korea's first formal treaty with America was in May 1882. The treaty was preceded by America's forgotten \\"little war\\" of bloody exchanges between the two countries. The little-known episode in American history involved a heavily armed American ship, the Colorado, entering Korean waters and landing its soldiers on Ganghwa Island. A battle ensued in which more than three hundred Koreans and three American soldiers were killed. The Americans later returned pursuing a treaty, resulting in the Treaty of Amity and Commerce in 1882. Among other things, the treaty contained a provision allowing Korean immigration to America. The first group of immigrants came from Rev. George Heber Jones' Methodist parish in Jemulpo (Inchon). *Immigrants prior to 1903: Historical statistics of Hawai'i indicate there were sixteen Koreans in the Territory of Hawai'i in 1902. Some are said to have been ginseng merchants in disguise who came using Chinese passports. One of these ginseng merchants was Choo Eun Yang, who came to Hawai'i and transmigrated to San Francisco around 1898. He became active in the Korean community there, became prosperous, and lived to the age of 102. Among other immigrants, Sung Pong Chang worked for the Circuit Court of Hawai'i and for the Honolulu Police Department as an interpreter until he died in 1949. *Four famous Korean immigrants: Dr. Philip Jaisohn (1866‚Äì1951), Dr. Syngman Rhee (1875‚Äì1965), Dosan Ahn Chang Ho (1878‚Äì1938), and Young Man Pak (1877‚Äì1928).

Early life Born in Manchester, New Hampshire, Elliot was educated at St. Paul‚Äôs School in Concord, New Hampshire, Phillips Academy (Andover, Massachusetts), Yale University, Cambridge University, and Columbia Law School. He also studied music privately with Nadia Boulanger and Leonard Bernstein, among others. 1914 Sheet Music Edition \\"There's a Long, Long Trail\\" His best-known composition is \\"There's a Long Long Trail A-Winding\\", a popular song from the era of World War I. Elliott wrote the music, and Stoddard King (1889‚Äì1933), Elliot's chief song collaborator, wrote the lyrics, when they were seniors at Yale. The song was published in London in 1914 (no U.S. publisher would gamble on it), but a December 1913 copyright for the music is claimed by Zo Elliot. [In Elliot's own words told to me shortly before his death in 1964, he created the music as an idle pursuit one day in his dorm room at Yale in 1913. King walked in, liked the music and suggested a first line. Elliot sang out the second, and so they went through the lyrics. And they performed it‚Äîwith trepidation‚Äîbefore the fraternity that evening. The interview was published as an article in the New Haven Register and later reprinted in Yankee Magazine. It then appeared on page 103 of \\"The Best of Yankee Magazine\\" In the interview he recalled the day and the odd circumstances that led to the creation of this historic song. I'm so pleased to have caught the details for history. ‚Äî Marc Drogin] Other works Elliot composed the well-known march ‚ÄúBritish Eighth‚Äù. It was written in tribute to General Bernard Montgomery and the Eighth Army and was copyrighted in 1943 for publishing in 1944. He also composed as an opera entitled Top Sergeant. In addition, he wrote an article on the background of the American Civil War song \\"John Brown's Body\\" (‚ÄúJohn Brown‚Äôs body lies a-mouldering in his grave,‚Äù sung to a melody later to become more famous as the melody to ‚ÄúThe Battle Hymn of the Republic\\"); the article purported to show that the John Brown of the song was a soldier in Boston, not the famous abolitionist of the same name. Elliot died age 73 at the Gaylord Farm Hospital in Wallingford, Connecticut on June 25, 1964.

It is directed by Pooja Bhatt, produced by Mukesh Bhatt and music by M. M. Keeravani. The film revolves around a moderate Indian Muslim cop, who wakes up and to his horror, discovers that his wife, who had recently been killed in a bomb blast, is accused of being a suicide bomber and had killed 20 people in the club.Dhoka‚Ä¶ The Moderate Muslim Voice This film is based on the novel The Attack by Yasmina Khadra. Plot Inspector Zaid Ahmed (Muzammil Ibrahim) is notified on duty that there has been a bomb blast at a mall. After investigation, it is found out that the suicide bomber responsible was Sara Khan (Tulip Joshi), Zaid's wife. Zaid finds it hard to believe in seeing his wife's dead body and claims to have dropped her at the bus stop. Zaid, who is inspected by the ATS (Anti Terrorism Squad), is called off duty temporarily by ATS Chief Raj Mehra (Gulshan Grover) but stands firm to his statement that his wife could not be the terrorist responsible. One day he receives a DVD, by post, at home, which consists of his wife's dying testimonial in which she accepts that she is the responsible terrorist. Not believing what he has seen, Zaid decides to visit Sara's grandfather Saeed Noor Bux (Anupam Kher). On meeting him, Saeed reveals a rather shocking story. Sara's father had been arrested by the Local Police and had been beaten as he was suspected of terrorist activities. During the interrogation, he dies. The Police hide his body, claims that he has run to Pakistan and was found guilty of being a terrorist. When Saeed complains about this incident to higher authorities, Sara, her brother Daanish (Abhay Sachar) and he himself are arrested by the Inspector and are forced to sign a statement that they do not want to investigate this case. Upon refusal, they make nude videos of Sara. After Saeed is forced to sign the statement, the inspector (Ashutosh Rana) asks Saeed and Daanish to go home, takes Sara to a cell, and rapes her. Due to this incident, Sara and her brother start meeting a Molvi (Islamic Preacher) (Munish Makhija), who convinces them to lay down their lives by killing Non-Muslims. While Sara was first in the league, her brother, who has been missing for a month, might follow her. Zaid, horrified by this tale, tries to find Sarah's brother Danish and finds him when he is being prepared to blast himself in a few days. As a result of chasing him, he finds out the Molvi behind this, and shares harsh words with him. Later he is shown a recording of Daanish accepting the responsibility of another bombing yet to take place. Molvi's men tell Zaid they will let him go after the bombing has happened the following day but he fights them and escapes to go after Daanish. Zaid finds Daanish at the station about to make a final call to his grandad and convinces him that he will get justice for Sara and their father. Daanish relents and hugs Zaid. Zaid's rank is restored and he resumes duty. He then explains to the senior police officers how they force terrorists to be born just because of not being able to give them justice. It is later shown that the corrupt Inspector is arrested and sentenced. Saeed and Daanish win the case with the help of Zaid.

Under the Treaty of Viterbo (27 May 1267), Baldwin II of Courtenay transferred much of the rights to the Latin Empire to Charles I.John V.A. Fine, Jr., The Late Medieval Balkans (1987), page 170 Charles was to be confirmed in possession of Corfu and some cities in Albania. He was also given suzerainty over the Principality of Achaea and sovereignty of the Aegean Islands, excepting those held by Venice and Lesbos, Chios, Samos, and Amorgos. The same treaty arranged the marriage of Philip of Courtenay, heir apparent to the Latin Empire, and Beatrice, second daughter of Charles. If the marriage was childless, Philip's rights would be inherited by Charles I. Beatrice was approximately fifteen-years-old at the time of her betrothal. On 15 October 1273, Beatrice and Philip were married in Foggia. The bride was twenty-one-years old and the groom thirty. Her father-in-law died days later. Philip was proclaimed emperor with Beatrice as empress. The marriage was harmonious and produced a daughter, Catherine I of Courtenay, born on 25 November 1274.

It was first released in 2002 by David Koelle. The current version, JFugue 5.0, was released in March 2015. Brian Eubanks has described JFugue as \\"useful for applications that need a quick and easy way to play music or to generate MIDI files.\\"Eubanks, Brian D. (2005), \\"Wicked Cool Java\\". pp. 154‚Äì156. JFugue is free software released under the Apache License.http://www.jfugue.org/download.html Example Here's an example Java program that will play the C-major scale in JFugue. import org.jfugue.player.Player; public class HelloWorld { public static void main(String[] args) { Player player = new Player(); player.play(\\"C D E F G A B\\"); } } The string passed to JFugue contains a series of musical instructions that JFugue parses and turns into musical events, which by default are rendered in MIDI. This format, called \\"Staccato,\\" can represent all of the musical features of MIDI \\"The Complete Guide to JFugue,\\" Chapter 2, \\"http://www.jfugue.org/4/jfugue-chapter2.pdf \\" and is specifically designed to be easy for people to read and write.\\"slideshare.net/dmkoelle/4130-musical- programs\\" While the default use case for JFugue is to convert Staccato to MIDI, the architecture allows it to read and write musical information from and to a variety of formats (e.g., MIDI to MusicXML,Recordare LLC, \\"http://www.recordare.com/xml/software.html Staccato to LilyPond). Below is an example converting a MIDI file to the Staccato format. MidiParser parser = new MidiParser(); StaccatoParserListener listener = new StaccatoParserListener(); parser.addParserListener(listener); parser.parse(MidiSystem.getSequence(new File(\\"YourMidiFile.mid\\"))); // Change to the name of a MIDI file that you own the rights to Pattern staccatoPattern = listener.getPattern(); System.out.println(staccatoPattern); JFugue 5.0 contains a set of classes that represent ideas in music theory, including intervals, scales, chords, and chord progressions. The notion of Patterns is integral to JFugue. Patterns are used to represent phrases of music that can be combined, repeated, and altered using tools that are aware of the musical content of the pattern. Pattern pattern1 = new Pattern(\\"A B C\\"); Pattern pattern2 = new Pattern(\\"G F E\\"); pattern1.add(pattern2).repeat(3); Player player = new Player(); player.play(pattern1); JFugue 5.0 makes extensive use of fluent interfaces, also known as method chaining, which lets developers write short, expressive pieces of code like the following: Chord[] chords = new ChordProgression(\\"I IV V\\").setRoot(\\"C\\").getChords(); Advanced Features JFugue is capable of producing microtonal music by using a Staccato element consisting of the letter 'm' followed by the frequency in Hertz of the desired tone. Like other notes in JFugue, this tone may be followed by a duration (such as 'w' for a whole note or 'q' for a quarter note) and note dynamics (e.g., \\"note on\\" and \\"note off\\" velocities). JFugue converts the microtone frequency to a sequence of MIDI Pitch Wheel and Note events to achieve the desired tone. Player player = new Player(); player.play(\\"m440.0q A4q\\"); // These sound the same player.play(\\"m568.7w\\"); // Whole duration note at 568.7 Hertz JFugue provides an intuitive programming interface for creating beats and rhythms. The characters in the strings below each correspond to a percussion note that is played on the percussive MIDI Channel (the tenth channel); default settings are provided for common sounds (e.g., \\"O\\" for \\"[BASS_DRUM]q\\"), although any Java Map or Character to String may be passed to the Rhythm constructor. Rhythm rhythm = new Rhythm() .addLayer(\\"O..oO...O..oOO..\\") .addLayer(\\"..S...S...S...S.\\") .addLayer(\\"\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\\") .addLayer(\\"...............+\\"); new Player().play(rhythm.getPattern().repeat(2)); In addition to allowing music to be converted from one music format to another, the architecture of JFugue can be used to create programmatic tools that are capable of both performing computations on incoming music (from any format) and changing incoming music.

This serial is said to have promoted the careers of Rahat Kazmi and Marina Khan as one of the most-sought- after stars in Pakistani television industry.http://www.dawn.com/news/1169324, Dhoop Kinare (1987) drama serial is reviewed and rated by Dawn newspaper, 'Old but not forgotten: Top 10 Pakistani dramas to re-watch now', Updated 13 March 2015, Retrieved 25 Dec 2016 Characters =Dr Ahmer Ansari= Rahat Kazmi as Dr Ahmer Ansari in Dhoop Kinare. This role made him as one of the most promising and prominent stars in the Pakistani television industry. Dr. Ahmer Ansari (Rahat Kazmi) is bereaving the death of his foster father (played by Arshad Mehmood) whom he calls Baba (an affectionate word for father in Urdu). He vaguely remembers that the professor had adopted him as a child but has no knowledge that his father had a daughter who died young and that she also gave birth to a girl who lives somewhere in the same city. His father had never shared his past with Ahmer. Ahmer was led to believe that he was the sole beneficiary of his baba's love and affection. In his will, Ahmer's father (Baba) leaves behind everything but the house to Ahmer. Baba gifts the house to his granddaughter, whom he never met. Ahmer, while trying to reminisce of his encounters with his father (shown in flashback sequences), gathers the true understanding of the dual meaning conversations with his father. He is very upset over the turn of events as he feels let down by his adopted father. Once again he feels alone and rejected. From a happy and cheerful man he turns into a reticent and reserved person. Throughout the first few episodes, Dr. Ahmer cannot come to terms with the death of his foster father and the sudden emergence of Baba's granddaughter who now owns the house where he spent his entire life. Upon repeated visits to the house Ahmer finds the new owner to be negligent towards the maintenance of the property. It angers him to see his father's house in disrepair. Through his lawyer, he makes many attempts to buy the house from the current owners but is always rejected. Incidentally, the same girl appears in his hospital as an intern. While he does not know who she is, he finds her to be quite immature and careless. He tries to instil professionalism in her and is often seen criticising and educating her which she finds frustrating. After some time Zoya begins to take interest in her profession and Dr Ahmer and she become friends which in turn helps him to loosen up. Soon they start to develop stronger feelings for each other. However, soon Dr Ahmer finds out who Zoya really is and refuses to talk to her. He also rejects the idea of buying the house from her since she finally decides to sell it because of financial losses to her father's business. However, when Dr. Ahmer finds out that they are in desperate need of money, he goes through with the transaction but decides to gift the house to Zoya anyway. In order to get away from Zoya, Dr Ahmer takes a leave from work and decides to leave Pakistan. However his feelings for Zoya are genuine and he soon finds himself at his Baba's house only to find Zoya waiting for him. They reunite for a beautiful conclusion to a memorable show. =Dr Zoya Ali Khan= =Dr. Sheena Karamat= Badar Khalil plays this character very well. She wants to get close to Dr. Ahmer but he doesn't consider her more than a good friend. When she notices Dr. Ahmer's interest in Zoya, she gets really jealous and gives Zoya a hard time. Later, she meets her old college friend Nasir Jamal (Rizwan Wasti) and marries him but finds out that he is also married to another woman and has children. =Dr. Irfan= Sajid Hassan plays this character beautifully. He is a junior colleague of Dr. Ahmer and work as the administrator of the children ward. He is a carefree person with an unmatched humorous personality. =Anji= Kehkishan Awan plays Anji, Zoya's best friend since childhood. She lives in a house next to Zoya. In later episodes, she gets engaged to Dr. Irfan (Sajid Hassan) who is a junior colleague of Dr Ahmer. =Zoya's Father= Qazi Wajid plays the role of Zoya's \\"Baba\\" who is very close with her and raised her like a friend. He believes in letting the kids grow by learning from their own experiences of life while supporting and advising them when in need. =Fazeelat Bibi= Azra Sherwani plays Fazeelat who is Zoya's caretaker and is not happy with Zoya always being at the hospital without having rest. Zoya calls her Fazee. =Mummy= Ishrat Hashmi plays Anji's mother =Daddy= Hameed Wyne plays a very strict father of Anji. He forces his daughter into working with him in his office rather than pursuing interior designing. He died in 1997. =Ahmer's Father= Arshad Mehmood plays the role of Dr. Ahmer Ansari's foster father. He appears in dream sequences from Dr. Ahmer's past.

At the time, \\"fatbikes\\" were emering on the market for winter use in snowy climates, but they were considered exotic and too expensive to produce. Quality Bicycle Products hoped to standardize parts to make mass production easier. Soon after its founding in the late 1990s, the Surly brand was mostly known for in the bicycle industry for its single-speed bikes, but in the 2010s it became known for fat-tire bikes that it helped pioneer with machinery it owned. By the 2010s, many brands that manufactured fat bikes used Surly tires. In April 2020, Surly's parent company announced layoffs for 12 percent of its workforce due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The small mushroom is a distinctive all-blue colour, while the gills have a slight reddish tint from the spores. The blue coloring of the fruit body is due to three azulene pigments. Whether Entoloma hochstetteri is poisonous or not is unknown. The MƒÅori name for the blue mushroom is werewere-kokako because the colour is similar to the blue wattle of the k≈çkako bird. This species was one of six native fungi featured in a set of fungal stamps issued in New Zealand in 2002.Moss MO, Pegler DN. (2003). Recent stamp issues of fungi from New Zealand. Mycologist 17:176-178. Taxonomy 300x300px The species was first described as Hygrophorus hochstetteri in 1866 by the Austrian mycologist Erwin Reichardt, before being given its current binomial name in 1962 by Greta Stevenson. It is named after the German naturalist Ferdinand von Hochstetter. Description Entoloma hochstetteri has a small delicate epigeous (above-ground) fruiting body (basidiocarp) which may be found among moss or leaf litter. The cap may be up to 4 cm (1.4 in) in diameter and conical in shape. The cap color is indigo-blue with a green tint, and is fibrillose. The cap margin is striate and rolled inwards. The gill attachment is adnexed or emarginate, gills are thin and 3‚Äì5 mm wide, essentially the same color as the cap, sometimes with a yellow tint.

It is the largest rail Local within Unifor. Prior to the launch of Unifor during the 2013 Labour Day weekend in Toronto with the merger of the Canadian Auto Workers and Communications, Energy and Paperworkers unions, National Council 4000 was affiliated with the CAW and known as CAW National Council 4000. Unifor is now the largest private sector Union in Canada, with more than 310,000 workers and associate members in industries ranging from railway and transportation to manufacturing and media to forestry and fishing, and many other private and public sector areas. CAW National Council Logo 1997-2013 CAW Council 4000 was formed in November 1997 at the Founding Convention held at the CAW Family Education Centre (now Unifor Family Education Centre) located on the shores of Lake Huron in Port Elgin, Ontario. The delegates to this convention voted to change the bargaining unit structure of the former Canadian Brotherhood of Railway, Transport and General Workers Union (CBRT&GW;), which merged with the National Automobile, Aerospace, Transportation and General Workers Union of Canada (CAW-Canada) in 1994, from 45-local unions situated across Canada, choosing to form a national council with five regionally based locals to service members from coast-to-coast. The CBRT&GW;, which was initially called the Canadian Brotherhood of Railway Employees (CBRE), was Canada's first sole Canadian Union founded in Moncton, New Brunswick on October 12, 1908. This was before the creation of Canadian National Railways (CNR), then a Federal Crown corporation, which saw the amalgamation of government owned railways and the several others that had become bankrupt and placed into government hands. Unifor National Council 4000 represents workers employed at CN and Via Rail Canada, which makes up the majority of the Council 4000 membership across Canada. Additionally, Council 4000 represents workers at Atlantic Wholesalers (DC24) (Loblaw Companies) and Loblaw Companies / Atlantic Wholesalers (DC06); Bay Ferries; CHEP Canada; CN (formerly Savage Alberta Railway); Cummins; DHL Express; Discovery Centre; Loomis Express (Transforce); Nova Scotia Federation of Labour support staff; Rocky Mountain Catering Co.

In September 2006 he became the first player to exploit the updated transfer regulations of FIFA, football's governing body, which stipulated that players are able to unilaterally walk away from a contract after a fixed period, regardless of the duration of the contract itself. Although the long-term effects of the decision remain unclear, it has been compared to the landmark Bosman ruling of 1995 in its potential significance. Background =Regulations for the Status and Transfer of Players= The regulations which led to the Webster ruling were enacted in response to the European Commission, who in 1998 opined that FIFA's then current football transfer system served as an obstruction to players' freedom of movement compared to workers in other industries. FIFA, and its European governing body UEFA, campaigned for a special exemption for football, but after the Commission threatened to abolish the system, the new regulations were put in place by September 2001. Because of the complexity and potential legal ramifications for players, it was five years before Webster's test case emerged. =Article 17= Article 17 of FIFA's Regulations for the Status and Transfer of Players is entitled \\"Consequences of Terminating a Contract Without Just Cause\\", and is the fifth article of Chapter IV, \\"Maintenance of Contractual Stability between Professionals and Clubs\\". It outlines the provisions which apply if a contract is terminated without just cause, and the requirement for the party in breach to pay compensation. Specifically, it states that any player who signed a contract before the age of 28 can buy himself out of the contract three years after the deal was signed. If he is 28 or older the time limit is shortened to two years. Article 17 was introduced in December 2004, with effect from 1 July 2005. =Webster's transfers= In March 2001, Andy Webster joined Hearts from Arbroath F.C. for a reported ¬£75,000, plus a \\"sell-on clause\\" which entitled Arbroath to 17.5 percent of any future sum received by Hearts for him. He played regularly for the next five years, and also played for the Scotland national football team. In July 2005, Glasgow side Rangers F.C. were credited with an interest in Webster, and the player requested permission to speak to them. This was refused, and Hearts told the player he would be part of their squad that season. However, in 2006 he became involved in a dispute with club owner Vladimir Romanov after refusing to extend his contract, and was subsequently omitted from the squad for the remainder of the 2005‚Äì06 season. Webster, who still had a year of his existing contract remaining, then signed for English Premiership club Wigan Athletic in August that year. The transfer was a protracted affair; it took several months before contracts were approved by FIFA, and the governing body took further time to ascertain if Webster's former club were due any compensation. The matter was further complicated by Hearts' initial refusal to release the player from their books as they sought to challenge the decision. Despite the efforts made to sign him, Wigan did not provide Webster with a regular first team place, and in January 2007 he returned to Scotland after Rangers signed him on loan for the remainder of the 2006‚Äì07 season. Despite persistent injuries which prevented him playing, Rangers manager Walter Smith extended his loan contract to 2008, although a permanent move was not organised until June 2008 as litigation over the Hearts‚ÄìWigan transfer continued. FIFA and CAS rulings on the Webster case Hearts had initially placed a valuation of ¬£5 million on Webster. However, because he had served more than three years of his contract he was outside of FIFA's \\"protected period\\", and any compensation due to Hearts would, per Article 17, be based primarily on the amount of Webster's salary still outstanding‚Äîa figure estimated by Webster's advisors at approximately ¬£250,000. FIFA's transfer arbitration tribunal, the Dispute Resolution Chamber, met on 4 April 2007 and ruled that Hearts were due ¬£625,000, based on Webster's future wages, his earning potential, and the legal costs. They also found Webster guilty of breaking his contract \\"without just cause\\", although only on a technicality; he and his agent were late informing the club of his intention to leave, because of confusion over the final match of the season (Hearts had reached the 2006 Scottish Cup Final, but the time limit was calculated from the club's last league game, four days prior to the Cup match). For this he was suspended for the first two weeks of the 2007‚Äì08 season. Hearts were quick to lodge an appeal against the ruling, disputing the figure which they said had not been unambiguously calculated. Webster had also indicated a desire to appeal, believing the fine against him was excessive. On 30 January 2008 the Court of Arbitration for Sport, the highest arbitration authority in sport, met in Lausanne and clarified the original ruling. They also reduced the compensation due payable by Webster to ¬£150,000. Reactions and analysis The general assessment from commentators is that the ruling is the most significant since Jean-Marc Bosman successfully challenged the restrictions on freedom of movement for workers for footballers in 1995. There is also speculation that the days of record-breaking transfer fees may be at an end. High-profile players like Frank Lampard, Cristiano Ronaldo, Michael Owen, Steven Gerrard and Wayne Rooney have all been cited as examples of players who could either leave their club for a relatively small amount, or increase their contract bargaining power as a result. Several other players have taken advantage of Article 17, including Tony Sylva and Jon√°s Guti√©rrez. FIFA were highly critical of the ruling; president Sepp Blatter said \\"the verdict in favour of the player will have far-reaching and damaging effects on the game as a whole. [It] is... a Pyrrhic victory for those players and their agents who toy with the idea of rescinding contracts before they have been fulfilled.\\" Football clubs were also hostile; A Hearts spokesman described it as a \\"dark day for football clubs\\", while Celtic, one of Hearts' and Rangers' rivals, stated bluntly that they would sue any player who broke his contract, believing that a court of law would support them regardless of any prior arbitration decision. The European Club Association has vocally criticised the ruling on several occasions, most notably after CAS decided Real Zaragoza had to compensate FC Shakhtar Donetsk for Brazilian midfielder Matuzal√©m's controversial transfer in May 2009. Conversely, players' organisations were highly supportive of CAS's decision. Tony Higgins, a Scottish representative of international footballers' union FIFPro, said \\"Article 17 gives footballers the sort of employee rights that anyone else would expect in the workplace\\", while Fraser Wishart, the general secretary of the Scottish players' union who had supported Webster's case, described it as \\"a new groundbreaking decision enabling players to enjoy greater freedom of employment.\\" References External links  Category:Labour law Category:Court of Justice of the European Union case law Category:Association football terminology Category:Sports law Category:2007 in case law Category:2005‚Äì06 in Scottish football Category:2006‚Äì07 in Scottish football Category:2005‚Äì06 in English football Category:2006‚Äì07 in English football ","title":"Webster ruling"},{"id":"17436492","text":"Cairo Roberto da Lima - also known as Cairo Lima only - (born 16 September 1976 in Uberl√¢ndia) is a Brazilian football manager and former player.

Life Gregor Schwartz-Bostunitsch was a radical author with German-Russian ancestry.Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 169. An active agitator against the Bolshevik Revolution, he fled his native Russia in 1920 and travelled widely in eastern Europe, making contact with Bulgarian Theosophists and probably with G.I. Gurdjieff. As a mystical anti-communist, he developed an unshakeable belief in the Jewish-Masonic-Bolshevik world conspiracy portrayed in the Protocols of the Elders of Zion.Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 169-170. In 1922 he published his first book, Freemasonry and the Russian Revolution, and emigrated to Germany in the same year.Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 170. He became an enthusiastic convert to Anthroposophy in 1923, but by 1929 he had repudiated it as yet another agent of the conspiracy. Meanwhile, he had begun to give lectures for the Ariosophical SocietyGoodrick-Clarke 1985: 170-171. and was a contributor to Georg Lomer's originally Theosophical (and later, neopagan) periodical entitled Asgard: a fighting sheet for the gods of the homeland.Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 162. He also worked for Alfred Rosenberg's news agency during the 1920s before joining the SS. He lectured widely on conspiracy theories and was appointed an honorary SS professor in 1942, but was barred from lecturing in uniform because of his unorthodox views. In 1944 he was promoted to SS- Standartenf√ºhrer on Himmler's recommendation. Notes Works * Ein Meer von Blut (Sea of Blood). Munich 1926. * Die Freimaurerei (Freemasonry).

The mine is located in the southwestern area of Montana, between Drummond and Anaconda along the Pintler Scenic Route on Montana Highway 1, east of Georgetown Lake. The gold mine was named on June 15, 1867, with the name commemorating the completion of the laying of the second transatlantic cable. The mine's founders were Alexander Aiken, John B. Pearson and Jonas Stough. They were camped on Flint Creek and their horses had drifted off. In tracking them to this location, the men were led to the discovery of the mine. Machinery for the first mill was imported from Swansea, Wales, and moved by wagon team from Corinne, Utah, the nearest railroad terminal. In the 19th century, mining was irregular. The town which grew up around the mine, Cable, Montana, boomed and busted four distinct times: 1867-1869, 1873‚Äì1878, 1883‚Äì1891 and 1902-1940. The Atlantic Cable Quartz Lode mine was operated with varying success until about 1880, when extremely rich ore was located. A 500-foot piece of ground produced $6,500,000 in gold. W. A. Clark paid $19,000 for one chunk of ore taken from this mine in 1889 and claimed it was the largest gold nugget ever found. In 1902, two brothers cleaned up the mine and obtained $18,000 from the first cleanup. By 1906, three shifts a day were running in the mill. By 1940, the mine was inactive and has remained that way.

Jitegemee was founded in 2003 by Farah Stockman and Alex Mutiso, and has been supported since by grants and contributions. It is overseen by a U.S. NGO, Jitegemee USA. Jitegemee means \\"sustain yourself\\" in Swahili and the program focuses on giving the street children the training and means necessary to become self-sustaining. Their work is ongoing and relatively successful insofar as around 130 children (as of May 2008) are participating in one of the programs Jitegemee has established. Common alternate paths for such children on the streets of Machakos include prostitution, drug-addiction, crime, and unskilled labor producing very little income.  Practice  Kenyan law requires that children in grades 1-8 attend free primary school, so for this age group Jitegemee provides food as well as money for concerns such as books and uniforms. After completion of primary school, children with interest and sufficient grades can elect to attend high school (referred to as secondary school). Children lacking the grades or desire to attend high school can participate in Jitegemee's vocational program. For secondary school children, Jitegemee continues to provide food and expenses as well as school tuition. For the vocational program enrollees, they teach classes on how to be a productive employee or mentee, and then help the kids find mentors in one of a handful of local trades ranging from hair- dressing to welding. Jitegemee has also worked to foster relationships between youth in the United States and their students.
