Alex Finlayson is an American playwright whose sly irreverent plays found more success on the English stage than in the United States. After winning Finlayson a Mobil Oil International Playwriting Prize, Winding the Ball was produced by The Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester, which also commissioned and produced Finlayson's Misfits (1996) and Tobaccoland (1999). All three plays starred American stage and film actress Lisa Eichhorn and were directed by Greg Hersov. Hersov has written that Finlayson creates \\"vivid and authentic worlds underpinned by a fiercely personal moral vision.

Her play Misfits portrays the film's historic box office and artistic failure as the casual fault of screenwriter Miller, director John Huston, and producer Frank Taylor, and not its star, Marilyn Monroe, who is most often blamed for the film disaster. Misfits received mixed reviews, with some critics attacking Finlayson for daring to put Miller onstage as a character. However, The Times proclaimed the play \\"riveting\\" and \\"inventive.\\"Kingston, Jeremy. \\"A Hit at Long Last,\\" The Times, 13 May 1996. Perhaps not surprising, given Miller's stature, U.S. theaters steered clear of Misfits. But in a dramatic twist worthy of the stage, Arthur Miller may have had the final word. His last play, Finishing the Picture (Goodman Theatre, Chicago 2004), presented his version of Marilyn Monroe and the making of The Misfits (film) eleven years after Finlayson‚Äôs Misfits debuted.Don't Mess With Arthur Miller, Chicago Reader Alex Finlayson was born and grew up in East Texas the daughter of an actor. After a brief career as a New York advertising copywriter, she taught herself to write plays by moving to a remote cabin in the Appalachian Mountains and studying the work of playwrights she admired.

He was abducted and later found dead in 2002, following a series of events marking the eighth anniversary of the imprisonment of Lebanese Forces party leader Samir Geagea.  Early life  Irani was born in Hazmieh on 21 June 1966 to a Maronite family. He attended Sisters of Ibrin School, Coll√®ge de la Salle in Cl√©menceau and Coll√®ge Mont- la-Salle in Ain Saadeh. He studied engineering at the Lebanese University Faculty of Engineering in Roumieh where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering in 1992. He worked in Total Liban in Beirut from 1993 until his death.  Political background  Irani was a well-known outspoken critic of the Syrian-occupied government in Lebanon. He led the Lebanese Forces in Lebanon's Order of Engineers elections to win a seat on the order's board for the first time, defeating Pro-Syrian and Hezbollah candidates. In 2000, Lebanese authorities briefly arrested Irani and he was released a short while later with broken ribs. After being released, Irani organized peaceful protests against the Syrian-occupied government of Lebanon and faced continuous harassment from Lebanese authorities. On 21 April 2002, he gave his last speech in public, during the celebration of the eighth anniversary of the imprisonment of Lebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea at the Lebanese University Faculty of Law in Jal el Dib. Personal life In 1996, he married Jocelyne El Khoury and had two children, Yasmine (born 1997) and Jad (born 1999) .  Abduction and murder  On 7 May 2002, Irani was walking down the popular Hamra Street on his way to celebrate the birthday of his 5-year-old daughter, Yasmina when he was kidnapped without a trace. His lack of resistance suggested that he knew who his kidnappers were. On 9 May 2002, Amnesty International issued a statement to express the fear that Irani could be detained incommunicado and subjected to torture.Lebanon: Possible \\"disappearance\\"/fear of torture Ramzi Irani (m), aged 35.

Many people in Lebanon point the finger at Syria and their agents inside Lebanon.  Legacy  Irani's involvement in the Engineers Section of the Lebanese Forces led to the establishment of the Ramzi Irani Memorial Award, awarded to the three students of the Faculty of Engineering in Roumieh who have received the highest grades in mechanical engineering, civil engineering and electronic and computer engineering departments. Since 2003, the LF students of the Faculty of Engineering in Roumieh have been holding a commemorative mass for Irani during May of each year.

It is located in the neighborhood of the same name, Hamra. Its technical name is Rue 31. Due to the numerous sidewalk cafes and theatres, Hamra Street was the centre of intellectual activity in Beirut during the 1960s and 1970s. Before 1975, Hamra Street and the surrounding district was known as Beirut's trendiest, though in the post-war period it has arguably been eclipsed by Rue Monot in Ashrafieh, Rue Gouraud in Gemmayzeh, Rue Verdun, and downtown area.New York Times In the mid 1990s, the Municipality of Beirut gave a face lift to the street to reattract tourists all year round. Hamra Street was known as Beirut's Champs Elys√©es as it was frequented by tourists, mostly Americans, Europeans and mega-rich Arabs, all year round. Today it is a commercial district with numerous prestigious universities (such as: American University of Beirut, Lebanese American University, and Haigazian University), hotels, furnished apartments, libraries, restaurants and coffee shops, with \\"78 Street\\" (commonly known as \\"the Alleyway\\") being Hamra's main pubbing and clubbing hub.  Geography  Hamra Street runs east-west, connecting Beirut Central District with the Ras Beirut neighborhoods. The street begins at the intersection of Rue de Rome and runs west until the intersection of Rue Sadat. Hamra Street is also a walking distance from the American University of Beirut on Bliss Street, Haigazian University on Rue Michel Chiha and the campus of the Lebanese American University as well as Rue Jeanne d'Arc and Ren√© Moawad Garden on Rue Spears. Demographics The Los Angeles Times journalist and Pulitzer Prize winner Borzou Daragahi described the street as a bastion of liberalism [that] embraces multiple religions and political views; Hamra Street is an amalgam of all of Lebanon's religious groups, including Sunnis, Maronites, Melkites, Greek Orthodox Christians, Druze, and Shias. Hamra, however, remains Lebanon's secular haven, melting pot for free thinkers and the least religiously affiliated area around Beirut as the area hosts a limited number of churches and mosques. Economy It hosts a large number of western chains (including Gloria Jean's, Caribou Coffee, Costa Coffee and Starbucks), as well as many local shops and restaurants. The appropriately named Cafe Hamra is a restaurant celebrating the historic street with an old street graffiti decor and a variety of international and Lebanese food as well as hookah smoking. Cafe Younes is another popular cafe that was first opened in 1935 and is run by a small family and is run by Amin Younes, the grandson of the founder of the same name. It is also known for its tourist appeal and variety of hotels. Its main landmark is the Crowne Plaza. The street buzzes with life during the summer when many tourists, especially from the Persian Gulf area, flock to Lebanon. Before the Lebanese civil war, Hamra Street was known as Beirut's \\"Champs Elys√©es\\" as it was frequented by tourists all year round. Beirut's Piccadilly Theatre was one of the major theaters in the Middle East. Hamra Street is a first-rate commercial district which proudly displays the latest fads in fashion. It also hosts a good number of hotels, furnished apartments and coffee shops that cater to visitors and students from the nearby American University of Beirut, Lebanese American University and Haigazian University. Hamra no longer functions as the cosmopolitan bastion of sectarian Lebanon. The Lebanese civil war and the ensuing government regulation that enforced rent control on all of the buildings removed the neighborhood's elite, pre-war cachet. However, the neighborhood remains trendy and profitable because of: #the historical significance of the neighborhood; #the attraction of \\"authentic\\" Beirut to foreign tourists, particularly those from the Persian Gulf; #the historic Hamra red light / supernightclub district, and the present acceptability of opening pubs, bars, and public cafes that serve alcohol in the district; #the current locations of the Lebanese Central Bank (Banque Du Liban), many private banks, multiple major newspapers (As-Safir, the wartime and pre-war headquarters of An-Nahar, and the near neighbors Al-Akhbar and Al-Mustaqbal), and many Lebanese government ministries (including the Ministries of Interior, Information, Tourism, and Economy and Trade), which have existed in Hamra since before the civil war; #the close proximity and economic focal points of four of Lebanon's most significant universities: the American University of Beirut, the Lebanese American University, and Haigazian University. #the booming commercial scene in Hamra St. that is a combination of retail shops, cafes, and restaurants. Although it has yet to revive fully its pre-war legacy, Hamra Street has undergone many renovations and is still regarded by many as the heart of the city. While it is no longer the nightlife and commercial center of Beirut, it has become one of many pocket areas and streets scattered throughout the city, and is included with other streets and areas as Rue Monot, Rue Gouraud, and Rue Verdun. Hamra Street Festival Hamra Streets Festival is launched in the autumn of each year under the patronage of the Prime Minister. It is a convivial and cultural festival, its aim is to exhibit the cultural and artistic diversity of Lebanon in general and Hamra Street in particular. The festival has encompassed a vast number of activities and events that target all age groups. Participation in the festival is flexible, and it greatly encourages amateur musicians, Artists and Free-lancers in all fields of the Arts. A wide variety of professional musicians perform after 8:30 p.m. each night while Amateurs reign the stages during the day. The Inauguration & Carnival Parade includes Carnival Float (Char de Carnaval), Dancing Groups, Zaffee loubnaniyya, Harley Davidson Owners HOG, The Beirut Orchestra, University Clubs Parade, Firemen, Croix Rouge Libanaise, Fuel Tankers with donkeys, Vegetable Chariots, Street Artists (Fire eater, stilt walker, etc.), Vintage Car etc. and a firework show afterwards.

He bought weapons with his own funds, supported militants being pursued by the French authorities and distributed arms. Ben-Boulaid contested the Assembly of Algeria election of 1948 and won decisively. However, the results were falsified by the French authorities. He was a founding member of the Revolutionary Committee of Unity and Action (CRUA). From 22‚Äì25 June 1954, he chaired a crucial meeting which aimed to unite the revolutionary forces.

He participated in the battle of Ifri el blah and the battle of Ahmar Khaddou near Batna. =Arrest and escape= On 11 February 1955, Ben-Boulaid was arrested in Tunisia. Ben- Boulaid was imprisoned at \\"Coudiat Aty\\" Central Prison in Constantine and was sentenced to death. In November 1955, with the complicity of a prison warden, Djaffer Ch√©rif, who was from Ben-Boulaid's home town, Ben-Boulaid escaped, along with other prisoners. One of the other prisoners was Tahar Zbiri, who went on to initiate a failed coup against President Houari Boumediene in 1967. During the escape, one of Ben-Boulaid's comrades was injured, recaptured, and subsequently decapitated. =Death= On 22 March 1956, Ben-Boula√Ød died in the blast of a parachuted French radio bomb].

He began his career in politics as a campaign director for the Commonwealth Liberal Party and Nationalist Party. He later joined the new United Australia Party in 1931, and served as a minister in the Lyons Government between 1932 and 1937. Early life Parkhill was born on 27 August 1878 in Paddington, New South Wales. He was the son of Isabella (n√©e Chisholm) and Robert Parkhill, his father being a stonemason. He was educated at public schools in Paddington and Waverley before finding work as a clerk. In 1904, Parkhill was elected to the Waverley Municipal Council. In the same year, he was appointed secretary of the Liberal and Reform Association. He married Florence Ruth Watts on 9 May 1906. Party politics Parkhill sitting at his desk In July 1909, Parkhill was chosen as secretary of the newly formed New South Wales Federal Liberal League. The new organisation was formed to support the parliamentary \\"Fusion\\" Liberal Party formed by Alfred Deakin and Joseph Cook. Influenced by his mentor Joseph Carruthers, Parkhill made the Liberal Party and its successor the Nationalist Party, extremely efficient political machines. He directed nineteen Federal and State election and referendum campaigns between 1904 and 1928, presiding over the introduction of new campaign techniques such as film and radio. Despite his professionalism, he was also unscrupulous, being sued for libel in 1914. His most successful campaign was for the 1925 Federal election, when he combined fear of Bolshevism, with which the opposition Labor Party was sometimes associated, with traditional Australian aspirations of home ownership. Due to his considerable success and efficiency, Parkhill became a national figure, and was closely involved in the formation of the Nationalist Party after the split in the Labor Party due to the issue of conscription in 1916. He became closely associated with Prime Minister Billy Hughes, who had led the Labor split, and was the central figure in the organisation of the Nationalist Party under both Hughes and his successor, Stanley Bruce. In this capacity, he served as secretary of the Australian National Federation. In another role, as secretary of the New South Wales Consultative Council from 1919 to 1929, he organised fund-raising for the ANF's Victorian equivalent, the National Union. Federal politics Parkhill in 1932 In 1922, Parkhill was persuaded to surrender his candidacy for the safe Nationalist seat of North Sydney to Hughes, but was able to enter Parliament via the equally safe seat of Warringah at a by- election following the retirement of Sir Granville Ryrie in 1927. His ministerial ambitions were suspended when the Government lost the 1929 election, although he became prominent in the ensuing Opposition under the leadership of John Latham. He was instrumental in reviving Nationalist morale, which was partly responsible for the implosion of Labor Prime Minister James Scullin's government. =Government minister= Parkhill as Minister for Home Affairs and Transport Parkhill, who was deeply attached to the Nationalist Party (going so far as to call it his \\"Nicene Creed\\"), was not enthusiastic about the formation of the United Australia Party, successor to the Nationalist Party, under Labor defector Joseph Lyons. He described it as a \\"party of spare parts\\"; nevertheless, when the party won the 1931 election, Parkhill was appointed Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Transport in January 1932. In April 1932, he became Minister for the Interior, which replaced the porfolios of Home Affairs and Transport. In October 1932, he lost the interior portfolio, but gained the position of Postmaster-General. By 1934 he was a member of the Cabinet and was third only to Lyons and Latham in the government, often serving as acting Prime Minister. By now, he had become one of Lyons's strongest supporters. As Minister for Defence (1934‚Äì1937), Parkhill cultivated a bipartisan approach, but his selection of an American model of aircraft for the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation, which he had established, cost him support within the party. He was defeated by Robert Menzies for the deputy leadership of the United Australia Party in December 1935, but was nevertheless the leader of the Australian delegation to King George VI's coronation in 1937. However, he was defeated in the 1937 election by \\"independent UAP\\" candidate Percy Spender on preferences, and, shocked, refused to shake hands after the poll. Later life Parkhill joined a number of company boards after his electoral defeat and considered re-contesting Warringah, but the success of Spender destroyed his hopes. Despite persistent rumours, he never returned to public life, and attacked Menzies' wartime leadership as \\"tragic\\". He died at St Luke's Hospital in Sydney in 1947 and was buried in Waverley Cemetery, survived by his wife, a son and a daughter. Legacy Parkhill was regarded as the leader of the conservative faction of the party, being extremely conservative morally and socially, and lent his support to free trade. His reputation as a dandy, partly due to his famous propensity to be over-dressed, led to nicknames including \\"Archduke\\", \\"Sir Spats\\", \\"Sir Kewpie\\" and \\"Perky\\". He always aspired to be Prime Minister, and his defeat for deputy party leader was a personal blow to Joseph Lyons. He is held partly responsible for the revival of the parties opposed to Labor in the 1930s, and for his effective defence policy.

It identifies the gap between the current (problem) state and desired (goal) state of a process or product. Focusing on the facts, the problem statement should be designed to address the Five Ws. The first condition of solving a problem is understanding the problem, which can be done by way of a problem statement. Problem statements are widely used by most businesses and organizations to execute process improvement projects. A simple and well-defined problem statement will be used by the project team to understand the problem and work toward developing a solution. It will also provide management with specific insights into the problem so that they can make appropriate project-approving decisions. As such, it is crucial for the problem statement to be clear and unambiguous.  Purpose  The main purpose of the problem statement is to identify and explain the problem. This includes describing the existing environment, where the problem occurs, and what impacts it has on users, finances, and ancillary activities. Additionally, the problem statement is used to explain what the expected environment looks like. Defining the desired condition provides an overall vision for the process or product. It makes clear the purpose for initiating the improvement project and the goals that it is meant to accomplish. Another important function of the problem statement is to be used as a communication device. A problem statement helps with obtaining buy-in from those involved in the project. Before the project begins, the stakeholders verify the problem and goals are accurately described in the problem statement. Once this approval is received, the project team reviews it to ensure everyone understands the issue at hand and what they are trying to accomplish. This also helps define the project scope, which keeps the project concentrated on the overall goal. The problem statement is referenced throughout the project to establish focus within the project team and verify they stay on track. At the end of the project, it is revisited to confirm the implemented solution indeed solves the problem. A well-defined problem statement can also aid in performing root-cause analysis to understand why the problem occurred and ensure measures can be taken to prevent it from happening in the future. It is important to note that the problem statement does not define the solution or methods of reaching the solution. The problem statement simply recognizes the gap between the problem and goal states. It can be said that ‚Äúa problem well stated is half solved‚Äù. However, there are often multiple, viable solutions to a problem. Only after the problem statement is written and agreed upon should the solution(s) be discussed and the resulting course of action determined.  Defining the problem  Before the problem statement can be crafted, the problem must be defined. It is human nature to want to begin working on a solution as soon as possible and neglecting the definition of the true problem to be solved. However, a poorly defined problem increases the risk of implementing a solution that does not fully meet the expected results. A problem cannot be solved if it is not completely understood. The process of defining the problem is often a group effort. It starts with meeting with the stakeholders, customers, and/or users affected by the issue (if possible) and learning about their pain points. Since people often struggle with effectively communicating their issues, particularly to someone outside of the process, it is helpful to ask a series of ‚Äúwhy‚Äù questions until the underlying reasoning is identified. This method, known as the ‚Äú5 Why‚Äôs‚Äù, helps drill down to the core problem as many of the experienced frustrations could be mere symptoms of the actual problem. Asking these additional questions as well as paraphrasing what the stakeholder had said demonstrates a degree of empathy and understanding of the problem. The information collected from these initial interviews is only one part of problem analysis. Many times the problem extends to multiple areas or functions to which the stakeholders, customers, and users are unaware. They may also be familiar with what is happening on the surface but not necessarily the underlying cause. Therefore, it is just as essential to gather knowledge, information, and insights from project team members and subject matter experts concerning the problem. Additional research materials, including work instructions, user manuals, product specifications, workflow charts, and previous project plans may also need to be consulted. Like most other stages in the process improvement project, defining the problem is often iterative as several rounds of discussions may be needed to get the full picture. Once the problem is understood and the circumstances driving the project initiation are clear, it is time to write the problem statement.  Writing the problem statement  The problem statement will be used to gain project support and approval from stakeholders. As such, it must be action-oriented. More importantly, the problem statement must be written clearly and accurately in order to deliver successful results. A poorly crafted or incorrect problem statement will lead to a faulty solution, as well as wasted time, money, and resources. There are several basic elements that can be built into every problem statement to decrease the risk of project failure. First, the problem statement must focus on the end user. A common mistake is focusing on ‚Äúhow‚Äù a problem will be solved rather than the current gap. Second, the problem statement shouldn‚Äôt be too broad. A benefit of using the ‚Äú5 Why‚Äôs‚Äù approach is that it avoids over-simplicity by providing the details needed for understanding the problem and developing an appropriate solution. Finally, the problem statement shouldn‚Äôt be too narrow. Solution-bias stifles the creativity that arises while brainstorming a solution, which may result in a less-than-optimal experience for the user. It is useful to design and follow a specific format when writing a problem statement. While there are several options for doing this, the following is a simple and straightforward template often used in Business Analysis to maintain focus on defining the problem. # IDEAL: This section is used to describe the desired or ‚Äúto be‚Äù state of the process or product. It identifies the goals of the stakeholders and customers as well as assists in defining scope. At large, this section should illustrate what the expected environment would look like once the solution is implemented. # REALITY: This section is used to describe the current or ‚Äúas is‚Äù state of the process or product. It explains the pain points expressed by the stakeholders and customers. It should also include the insights and expertise of the project team and subject matter experts provided during problem analysis. # CONSEQUENCES: This section is used to describe the impacts on the business if the problem is not fixed or improved upon. This includes costs associated with loss of money, time, productivity, competitive advantage, and so forth. The magnitude of these effects will also help determine the priority of the project. # PROPOSAL: This section is used to describe potential solutions. Once the ideal, reality, and consequences sections have been completed, understood, and approved, the project team can start offering options for solving the problem. It can also include suggestions by the stakeholders and customers, although further discussions and research will be needed before a specific course of action can be determined. Following this format will result in a workable document that can be used by all parties to understand the problem and elicit requirements that will lead to a winning solution.  Example  Problem statements can vary in length, depending on the complexity of the problem. The following is an example of a simple problem statement for the creation of a Single Sign On capability: IDEAL : Ideally our users would be able to sign into their laptops and then automatically have access to all of the applications they need to use. REALITY : In reality we use at least three applications every day to accomplish our work. Each application is protected by a password with different requirements for username & password length. Passwords also expire at different times. CONSEQUENCES : * Users waste approximately 2 minutes per day logging into multiple applications (Lets take if there are 500 users then 500 users * 2 minutes per day = 1000 minutes in lost productivity; 1000 minutes = 16.67 hrs per day * $75/hr = $1250 per day). * Helpdesk resolves approximately 6000 calls per year to reset forgotten passwords & unlock accounts. * Security risk as users will continue to write usernames & passwords on sticky notes on their desks. PROPOSAL Have a S/W Dev, Network Administration and business stakeholders collaboration to evaluate potential solutions for a Single Sign On capability.

This company was manufactured to carry on business by publishing books, selling color supplies for schools such as crayons, water colors, paper colors and school supplies and to teach the principles of Munsell Color System. After the death of Albert H. Munsell, his son, Alexander Ector Orr Munsell, was convinced to take over the company and reorganized it, renamed as the Munsell Color Foundation. The Munsell Color Foundation moved to New York for educational purposes and established the Munsell Laboratory Research which was funded by the Munsell family. A few years later, the Munsell Color Foundation and the Laboratory moved to Baltimore, Maryland, to be close to the National Bureau of Standards and Johns Hopkins University. Alexander Munsell contributed his times attending to Johns Hopkins University and under the guidance from I. G. Priest, in order for Alexander continuing researching on his father's works. In 1983, the Foundation trustees had voted to close Munsell Color Foundation and donated to Rochester Institute of Technology, from which it created the Munsell Color Science Laboratory. Short Biography of Albert H. Munsell Albert H. Munsell was born in Boston, Massachusetts on January 6, 1858 and died on June 24, 1918. During his youth, he has been studied arts in Massachusetts Normal Art School and went aboard to √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris to further studied arts. Impression arts movement was a big hit during his time. He has won some awards for his work in anatomy, perspective and composition. His artworks were praised and exhibited in Boston, New York, Pittsburgh and Chicago. Most of his paintings were seascape artwork. When Albert Munsell went back to Massachusetts, he becomes a teacher to teach his students to drawing and painting from antique figure, model, composition and anatomy. During the early 1900s, Albert Munsell has kept diaries of his development of Munsell color space. The reason he developed the Munsell Color System was to make the colors easy and convenient to teach children. Therefore, he believed that if children were properly taught, colors would be more meaningful and useful for them through life. He devoted his time to continue working on his Munsell color space.Albert Henry Munsell In 1917, Munsell Color Company was founded by Albert H. Munsell. He invested his time working on Munsell Color System. He has published a few books which were called A Color Notation (1905), Altas of Munsell Color System (1915) and A Grammar of Color: Arrangements of Strathmore Papers in a Variety of Printed Color Combinations According to The Munsell Color System (1921). He was the first one to create the Munsell color system to separate three attributes ‚Äì hue, value, and chroma ‚Äì to be perceptually uniform. And the data of the Munsell color system was the most accurate measurement of human's visual responses to color. Munsell Color Foundation The Munsell Color Company was founded by Albert H. Munsell, who devoted his time to developing a color order system. The share owners of the stock besides Albert Munsell were Arthur Allen and Ray Greenleaf. Albert Munsell developed the color system based on human perception. And yet, his color system became popular and is still used worldwide today. The Munsell Color Company was formed to carry business by publishing books and charts, crayons, water colors, color spheres, paper colors and school supplies. After the death of Albert Munsell, his family supported the company in memorial of him. The company was later reorganized as the Munsell Color Foundation and moved to New York. The Foundation was set up as the Munsell Color Laboratory to continue the scientific work of Munsell color system. Albert's son, Alexander Ector Orr Munsell, was convinced by Allen and Greenleaf to agree to take over the position of CEO of the Munsell Color Foundation. Alexander did not care much about the business and artist aspect. He only cared about the scientific aspect of Albert Munsell's work. So Alexander decided to turn over the making and the handling of Munsell crayons to the Binney and Smith Company and the school supplies to Favor, Ruhl and Company. The only things left in the Munsell Color Company were the production of the Atlas papers, charts, disks and Munsell publications. At the same time, the Munsell Color Foundation and Munsell Color Laboratory moved to Baltimore, Maryland, where it was near to the National Bureau of Standards and Johns Hopkins University. Alexander intended to do some laboratory research with the spectrophotometer, artificial daylight, darkroom, and painting posters near Hopkins University under the guidance of I.G. Priest. Based on his successful research, the Munsell Book of Color was published, replacing Albert Munsell's Atlas of Munsell Color System. Later, the Munsell Color Foundation became a nonprofit organization. Alexander no longer had time to worry about the business aspect of his company when he was focusing on researching. So he attended an open meeting with the leaders in the color field and confirmed that Munsell Color Foundation gave up the business. The National Bureau of Standards and Inter-Society Color Council appointed special trustees to serve on the Board of Trustees. Those trustees were appointed to represent the color interests of science and educational fields. The purpose of this company serves ‚Äúto further the scientific and practical advancement of color knowledge and in particular knowledge relating to standardization, nomenclature, and specification of color, and to promote the practical application of these results to color problems arising in science, art and industry.‚Äô. In 1983, the Foundation Board of Trustees voted to close the Munsell Color Foundation. They had donated the endowment of the Munsell Color Science Laboratory to the Rochester Institute of Technology who was selected as a recipient . Most of the products that were owned by the Munsell Color Foundation are now owned by the X-Rite company.Albert Henry Munsell =Munsell Color Science Laboratory= The Board of Trustees of the Munsell Color Foundation voted to close down the foundation and donated the Munsell Color Laboratory to a selected recipient, the Rochester Institute of Technology . The Munsell Color Science Laboratory was located at the Rochester Institute of Technology at the building of Chester F. Carlson Center for Imaging Science. The creation of the Munsell Color Science Laboratory was thanks to the effort of Franc Grum, who was the first Director of the Munsell Color Science Laboratory and R.S. Hunter, who was a professor of Color Science. Franc Grum used to be an employee of Munsell Color Foundation. Currently, the purpose of this laboratory is to aim the improvement of scientific researches toward Imaging Science Field. =Contributions of Munsell Color Foundation= Albert H.

The positive phase of the PNA pattern features above-average barometric pressure heights in the vicinity of Hawaii and over the inter-mountain region of North America, and below-average heights located south of the Aleutian Islands and over the southeastern United States. The PNA pattern is associated with strong fluctuations in the strength and location of the East Asian jet stream. The positive phase is associated with an enhanced East Asian jet stream and with an eastward shift in the jet exit region toward the western United States. The negative phase is associated with a westward retraction of that jet stream toward eastern Asia, blocking activity over the high latitudes of the North Pacific, and a strong split-flow configuration over the central North Pacific. The positive phase of the PNA pattern is associated with above-average temperatures over western Canada and the extreme western United States, and below-average temperatures across the south-central and southeastern US. The PNA tends to have little impact on surface temperature variability over North America during summer. The associated precipitation anomalies include above- average totals in the Gulf of Alaska extending into the Pacific Northwestern United States, and below-average totals over the upper Midwestern United States. The negative PNA phase is associated with the opposite. Although the PNA pattern is a natural internal mode of climate variability, it is also strongly influenced by the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. The positive phase of the PNA pattern tends to be associated with Pacific warm episodes (El Ni√±o), and the negative phase tends to be associated with Pacific cold episodes (La Ni√±a).

The writing on the book refers to two of the observatories where he worked: Helsingfors (Helsinki, 1875) and Gotha (1877). Karl Nikolaus Adalbert Krueger (9 December 1832 ‚Äì 21 April 1896) was a German astronomer. Born in Marienburg, Prussia (now Malbork, Poland), he was editor of Astronomische Nachrichten from 1881 until his death. Krueger died of a heart condition in Kiel at the age of 63. Life and work In 1851, Krueger entered the University of Berlin where he studied mathematics and science. In 1853, showing a special preference for astronomical studies, Krueger moved to the University of Bonn and became an assistant to the astronomer Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander at the Bonn Observatory. Under Argelander's supervision he produced data for the comprehensive astrometric star catalogue known as the Bonner Durchmusterung, together with fellow student Eduard Sch√∂nfeld . Starting in Bonn, he undertook a lifelong study of the orbit of the minor planet Themis, whose perturbations by Jupiter eventually enabled him in 1873 (while at Helsinki Observatory) to determine the mass of the latter planet. He was awarded his doctorate by the University of Bonn in August 1854 for his dissertation titled \\"De ascensionibus rectis, a Flamsteedio quadrantis muralis ope observatis\\". In 1858 a heliometer previously used by Friedrich Winnecke came into his hands, and was successfully employed in a series of parallax determinations. Krueger was made Privatdozent in the University in 1860. In 1862 Krueger was appointed Professor of Astronomy and Director of the Helsinki Observatory, working there for 14 years. At the time of his appointment he married Maria Wilhelmina Amalia, the eldest daughter of Friedrich Argelander. While in Helsinki, Krueger carefully determined the position of the stars of the Double Cluster in Perseus. The large proper motion of the star Groombridge 34 was first detected by him. He also performed observations of variable stars, several comets and minor planets, in addition to his theoretical work. After leaving Helsinki, Krueger directed the Gotha Observatory (1876-1880), succeeding the recently deceased Peter Andreas Hansen. In Gotha he continued to record data for the Astronomische Gesellschaft Katalog, an astrometric star catalogue. Krueger was appointed as Director of the Royal Prussian Observatory in Kiel in 1880. In 1881, with the approval of the Astronomical Society (Astronomische Gesellschaft), Krueger became the editor of one of the foremost astronomical journals of the day, Astronomische Nachrichten; following the death of the former editor Christian Peters the year before. Following the death of Krueger in 1896, the editorship passed to his former assistant and son-in-law Heinrich Kreutz.

August 24, 1634 ‚Äì September 22, 1692) was a defendant in the Salem witch trials in colonial Massachusetts. She was executed by hanging in Salem in 1692. Early life Mary Eastey was born Mary Towne to William Towne and Joanna Towne (n√©e Blessing) in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, England. She was one of eight children, among them her sisters and fellow Salem defendants Rebecca Nurse and Sarah Cloyce. Mary Towne and her family moved to America around 1640. She married Isaac Estey, a farmer and barrel-maker, in 1655 in Topsfield, Massachusetts Bay Colony. Isaac was born in England on November 27, 1627; the couple had eleven children: Joseph (1657‚Äì1739), Sarah (1660‚Äì1749), John, Isaac (1662‚Äì1714), Hannah, Benjamin, Samuel, Jacob, Joshua, Jeffrey, and Isaac. Accusation and trial Like her sister Rebecca Nurse, Eastey was a pious and respected citizen of Salem, and her accusation came as a surprise. During the examination on April 22, 1692, when Eastey clasped her hands together, Mercy Lewis, one of the afflicted, imitated the gesture and claimed to be unable to release her hands until Eastey released her own. Again, when Eastey inclined her head, the afflicted girls accused her of trying to break their necks. Mercy claimed that Eastey's specter had climbed into her bed and laid her hand upon her breasts. In the face of such public hysteria, Mary Eastey defended herself with remarkable eloquence: when she was asked by the magistrates John Hathorne and Jonathan Corwin how far she had complied with Satan, she replied, \\"Sir, I never complyed with Satan but prayed against him all my dayes, I have no complyance with Satan, in this ... I will say it, if it is my last time, I am clear of this sin.\\" Hathorne, showing a momentary doubt about her guilt, went so far as to ask the girls if they were quite sure that Mary Eastey was the woman who afflicted them. For reasons unknown, Eastey was released from prison on May 18 after two months. However, on May 20, Mercy Lewis claimed that Eastey's specter was afflicting her, a claim which other girls supported. A second warrant was issued that night for Eastey's arrest. She was taken from her bed and returned to the prison; Lewis ceased her fits after Eastey was chained. Eastey was tried and condemned to death on September 9. Robert Calef, in More Wonders of the Invisible World, described Eastey's parting words to her family \\"as serious, religious, distinct, and affectionate as could be expressed, drawing tears from the eyes of almost all present.\\" She was hanged on September 22, along with Martha Corey, Ann Pudeator, Alice Parker, Mary Parker, Wilmot Redd, Margaret Scott, and Samuel Wardwell: Cotton Mather, to his later embarrassment, denounced them as \\"eight firebrands of Hell\\". On the gallows she prayed for an end to the witch hunt. Of her two sisters, likewise charged with witchcraft, Rebecca Nurse was hanged on July 19, 1692, but Sarah Cloyce was released in January 1693. Calef also published Mary Eastey's last petition to the Court, of which it has been said that no more moving document has ever been addressed to any judge. Mary pleaded not for her own life but for those of the others falsely accused: \\"I petition your honours not for my own life for I know I must die and my appointed time is set but the Lord he knows it is that no more innocent blood be shed.....the Lord above that is the searcher of all hearts knows that as I shall answer at the Tribunal seat I never knew the least thing of witchcraft\\".Hill, Frances Delusion of Satan- the Full Story of the Salem Witch Trials Hamish Hamilton London 1996 p.183 In November, after Eastey had been put to death, Mary Herrick gave testimony about Eastey. Herrick testified that she was visited by Eastey's ghost, who told her she had been put to death wrongfully and was innocent of witchcraft, and that she had come to vindicate her cause. Eastey's family was compensated with 20 pounds from the government in 1711 for her wrongful execution. Her husband Isaac lived until June 11, 1712. In popular culture * Mary Eastey was referred to as a witch in the 2013 horror movie The Conjuring, as was her supposed relative, Bathsheba, who possessed those who lived on her land. * Mary Eastey was mentioned to be a witch in Season 1 Episode 2 of the TV series Charmed. * In the 1985 PBS drama Three Sovereigns for Sarah she was played by Kim Hunter. * In The Crucible, by Arthur Miller, Mary Eastey does not appear on stage, but is named in Act IV, like her sister Rebecca Nurse, as one of those alleged witches whose execution, due to their blameless lives, may cause a backlash against the witchcraft trials. The hero, John Proctor, is pressed hard to name her as a witch, but refuses to do so. * The Primate Fiasco released the song \\"Mary Towne Estey 1692\\" in 2017.

It was one of the original university radio stations in the United Kingdom and with the other pioneering campus radio stations at York, Brunel, Loughborough, Sussex, Surrey the door was opened in the UK for campus radio. Format The radio station was funded by the Student Union at the University of Essex, and changed identity to RED - 1404 AM in Autumn 2001. URE first broadcast on the 1 March 1971, on 301 metres medium wave (originally 998 kHz, later 999 kHz AM). It later broadcast on 963 kHz AM, 1404 kHz AM, 1602 kHz AM, and 87.7 MHz FM. Programming format is predominantly music, with some news programmes including the award-winning Tower to Tower magazine programme. Early history Campus radio at Essex University started with the protests that ripped through the campus in 1968, followed by a long blockade of the boundary road surrounding the Wivenhoe Park campus at the University of Essex. One of the demands of the protagonists was that a student radio station may be set up. For its day, this was reported to be not an unusual demand, considering the only alternatives at the time were the BBC Home or Light programmes - or pirate radio, from boats anchored in the North Sea. It took several years for radio to become a reality in the UK. Essex URE was beaten to air by University Radio York. Preparation and licensing had begun with members of the Students Union and the university's Amateur Radio Society, several members of whom were also members of the station's technical team. There was a close affiliation between the station, the amateur radio society and the Union Technical Organisation (UTO) who did stage lighting and provided disco services on campus. By the time the station was ready to go on air, the central Student Union building had been built above Square 3, as had the first two towers. As a mark of the importance that the university attached to the station at the time, installation of cables for induction loops was already planned in the construction of the residential tower blocks (they were laid along a duct that runs between the towers). The original mixer, with rotary volume controls was built by students, and assembled along with inexpensive turntables. Meanwhile, the Student Union had great plans for their station - and dedicated three rooms in the union corridor for the new station. At the top of the stairs in the union building there was a large reception area and office (also used as the location for the transmission equipment) leading to a corridor with the main on air studio (studio A), and a talk studio (studio B - also known as the passenger studio) with a window between them. The studio B had a table for round table discussions. An article in the university magazine Wyvern in October 2001 written by one of the creators of URE notes that > \\"Sound deadening, was originally provided by egg boxes glued to the wall. > After the University fire office found out, the whole lot had to be ripped > down, and heavy curtains used instead\\". The idea at the time was that for occasional music programmes and news programs presenters would sit in the passenger studio B while an engineer would play the discs and otherwise operate the controls from studio A. In 1976 this layout was changed, with studio B divided so that a further studio, studio C was created, as a small self-op presenters music studio. At some point later in the 1970s this configuration was changed with a further studio room added. As at UKC Radio this layout soon proved wildly impractical, because most presenters would sit in the self-op studio, leaving the centre and end studio unoccupied except for the daily union discussion programmes, and occasional news broadcasts. A second studio suite was built at Wivenhoe House (original stately home of Wivenhoe Park on which the university was built, and was the home of the vice chancellor's offices and other admin) with a landline connection to the main studios. The intention was to produce documentary programs and news at Wivenhoe House. The studio was never actively used for broadcasting. The studios were swapped in 1980 with the arrival of a Magnetic Tapes Ltd 12 channel desk (called \\"old faithful\\" by the engineers, due to its longevity), which was ordered specifically from the factory for the purpose, with quad Chilton PPM BBC style meters. This desk was later purchased by a member, and was used for BBC broadcasts. The Studio in Wivenhoe House had meanwhile bitten the dust as early as 1978. The station first broadcast on the 1 March 1971, on 301 meters medium wave (originally 998kHzAM) with the Dean of Students welcoming the new station to the airwaves. Programming rapidly changed from a mix of spoken word and music, to mainly music Breakfast shows were a part of broadcasting from the first day, but moved several hours earlier after a few years. The late afternoon show was called \\"5ive 2wo\\" from 5pm to 7pm. Specialty shows followed often with a half hour foreign educational program from places like ORTF (France) and NHK (Japan). Other specialty programming included Folk, Rock, Blues, and a Country show. A famous late night request show called at the time \\"Cancer - the show that grows on you\\". Reports from the 5th birthday programme indicate that it was very popular. News was also a significant part of URE for the first few years, as at most campus radio stations, and was a part of the license mandate. Copyright was a major issue, and so URE, along with several other stations at Sussex, York, Loughborough, Brunel, Surrey, and Swansea formed the National Association of Student Broadcasting. NASB as it became known negotiated with the copyright agencies for reduced copyright fees for stations by central administration, and negotiated to try to obtain news feeds for stations, since most relied on getting articles from newspapers and transcriptions of radio news. Unfortunately at that time the cost of providing feeds by telex was prohibitively expensive. As a result, Reuters worked with NASB and URE to find a way to provide news info. The union were very supportive of the station in the first few decades, and paid for outside broadcast lines to the Union Bar, Square 4 Coffee Shop, and Ball Room or Dance Hall (in the basement of the union building), plus the newly built Lecture Theatre Block (LTBs). Here the university again put in considerable resources to the station, and built 4 dedicated studios for URE in LTB6, on the balcony overlooking the largest lecture theatre block. The idea was that URE would provide commentary for important speakers, and the union hustings from here. These were intensively used at the time, and two decades later still provided good service two or three times a year, including when Desmond Tutu visited the university in 1991. They are last believed to have hosted a URE broadcast for the union hustings in 1996, but are still in existence, and when tested in 2007 these dusty and unused studios were found to be still serviceable and connected to the main studio complex (now consisting of just one room). =Early transmission systems= Before the official opening, some programmes were broadcast on a \\"test oscillator\\" to show the practicality of the service. These broadcasts, which were of very low power, were not strictly legal. In order to obtain a British Post Office license for the official opening, strict regulations had to be met. Because no budget was available, all of the work had to be done with minimum expenditure. An Amateur Radio KW \\"Vanguard\\" transmitter was modified by John Rabson to operate at 998 kHz, using a crystal-controlled exciter made by Robin Gape to replace the original Geloso VFO. Since the transmitter frequency was fixed, the large tuning dial was removed. An active filter was built into the Vanguard's modulator by Rick Jenkins, to avoid exceeding the allotted bandwidth. Because of a stringent Post Office requirement to limit field strength at the campus boundary to 100 microvolts per metre, and the presence of a strong signal on an adjacent channel, the transmitter could not be simply coupled to a single, central antenna. A scheme was devised to use individual \\"infinitesimal\\" passive loop antennae in each residential tower, fed by coaxial cable and carefully phased in pairs to cancel the external field. The coaxial cable had to be carefully laid out to produce the required accuracy of phasing, and splitting transformers were used to reduce power loss. The antennae were in protected ducts inside the residential buildings, and their frames were lightly built of hardboard and spruce. Since the splitting transformers were in underground ducts, they were housed in robust die-cast boxes. Despite the crudity of its construction, this system produced a strong signal of about 10mV/metre inside the residential towers, while still meeting the requirement for a negligible signal at the campus boundary. Test equipment to confirm its correct operation, including portable field-strength meters and their calibration gear, was improvised. Subsequent Post Office testing with professional equipment confirmed that the system met its goals. This original system was on its last legs by 1982. The Students' Union accordingly paid for a full new installation of a new \\"active\\" induction loop system, with power for loop amplifiers supplied down the coax along which came the RF supply. This was built over the summer of 1982 as the first installation by Wireless Workshop - a company formed by students from University Radio Falmer who at the time only built transmitters for university radio in the UK. At the time the chance was taken to switch to 999 kHz AM, the new UK standard. There was a separate coax supply to each tower, with a loop every three floors. There were active amplifiers under the North Towers causeway. This new system worked very well until 1990, when a blown fuse in a power amp under the causeway resulted in Tawney and William Morris being off air for 9 months. Considerable ingenuity by engineers in reaching the fuse - in the sub-basement and abandoned boiler rooms under Tawney - eventually resulted in a fix. The opportunity was taken in 1990 to add induction loops to the Wolfson Court hall of residence, which had previously only received some radiation from Keynes. This new system allowed a \\"fudge\\", considering both studios were now constructed for self-op operation: the campus now had two transmission networks. Accordingly, the new transmitters were set up so that Studio A could serve 999 kHz with a music service (called the URE301 service, complete with sung jingles), as this used the new transmitter with much better audio processing and modulation, and speech on 1602 kHz (with a formal Home Service style) using the old 1971 transmitter, but again this 1602 service bit the dust a few years later, following the mid-80s station collapse, although it took until 1991 for the then programme controller to notify the authorities that this frequency was no longer required. By then the few remains of the 1602 transmitter were in a filing cabinet in the corridor linking the studios. The newly installed 999 kHz induction loop network was however much weaker than the original transmitter - 1 watt as opposed to the original 50 watts - and this allowed stations like Radio Tirana (from Albania) and Deutsche Welle (from Grigoriopol) a pretty much perfect interference pattern that silenced the station unless received close to an induction loop (located on each third floor of the towers). Accordingly, in 1983 URE applied to the Home Office to move to the pretty much clear and unoccupied channel of 319 meters (963 kHz). The unauthorised broadcaster Radio Caroline had the same idea and also promptly did so too. Because it was anchored just off the coast of Frinton-on- Sea (just a few miles from URE) it pretty much decimated any reception for the station. URE moved back to 999 kHz, and took 1602 kHz transmission off air at the same time. =New constitution= The debacle sparked some internal disputes within the station, which caused doubt within the Students Union as to whether they could continue to allow URE to run without tight control of the output: in the resulting argument (from URE committee meeting minutes in 1984) URE's management took the station off air for the latter part of 1984. The dispute was only resolved when URE agreed to relinquish its office, in return for the Union to agree to abide by acknowledging URE's autonomy and a management structure decided by internal voting by the stations members, who were deemed to be \\"anyone enrolled in the university, its staff, or anyone they deemed a fit member of the radio station\\". (URE constitution 1987). This constitution worked by having a committee of a Station Manager and Programme Controller on equal footing, plus a head of News, Engineering, Publicity, Treasurer, Secretary, and Record Librarian. All had a vote in committee decisions, and the union was relegated to a position at which the station would put in its request for a budget at the end of the year, and maintain its own finances. In 1988 in a formal referendum URE members voted to accept advertising for the first time, but turned down any suggestion to playlist the station. At the time URE had extensive publicity, including a programme schedule that was produced and sent to each flat on campus every two weeks with a name on the pun of Radio Times (Radio Tubes, Radio Tiles, Radio Tynes etc.): by 1988 the name Radio Crimes had stuck - it was printed fortnightly until 1996, with a wider circulation than any SU publication. The new constitution reinvigorated the station and dramatically changed the output: it was the start of a long period of steady growth that lasted nearly two decades. While in 1986 the station didn't broadcast in Freshers week, by 1987 the importance of welcoming new students (and indirectly, encouraging them to listen to URE) was recognised, and in 1987 the programme controller (on air 10amnoon) and Station Manager (on air 4pm6pm) managed a week of broadcasting, with specialist programming in the evening. This encouraged considerable sign- up of new presenters, and by the second week of term there was full programming throughout weekdays. By the winter, there was even a Saturday breakfast show. In the spring the station started taking Independent Radio News on the hour - by a tuner that provided Essex Radio as a fader on the desk. This was initially planned as just a way to taking news (IRN), but by the summer it had turned into a way to fill \\"dead air\\" - previously the station just broadcast silence when there was no presenter in the one on air studio. By 1988 there was full daytime programming in Freshers Week for the first time and over 200 new DJs signed up: that winter URE achieved full 24-hour programming in the last week of term, a new record. At the same time the tower blocks moved over from having an internal phone system (known as \\"Towers Internal Telephone System\\" or TITS), on which URE used the extension 158, to a Private Internal Phone System. There were from the mid 70s many jocular jingles on the theme of URE being on \\"TITS 158\\". URE adopted a new extension in 1988, of 2267, which exists to this day, however that gave rise to the infamous \\"PITS\\" switch, or \\"Phone Internal Telephone System\\". This, on the Magnetic Tapes desk until it was replaced, gave the presenter output plus music through the speakers in the studio, without a cutout if the microphone was on air. Very soon the advantage of this switch - which meant the music carried on, even while the presenter was on air, became apparent: it became known as the PITS or \\"Party in the Studio\\" Switch. URE celebrated its 18th birthday in 1989. Many Alumni were invited back to make programmes. By 1989 there was a waiting list of over 20 new presenters, and the Christmas \\"all- nighters\\" presentation had become a fixture. A criticism of this period was that there was always a drive to encourage new presenters to sign up - and maintain the music output, to keep the station on air all the time, at an expense of complex talk programmes. To counter this then programme controller introduced a once a week talk programme called \\"Tower to Tower\\"; the name was a direct copy of University Radio Falmer's \\"Slope to Slope\\", although the format was new: with three minutes of the news of university that week, six minutes of UK news, a five-minute what's on guide, an interview with a sabbatical officer, a five-minute package of an event effecting students, a band review, film review, and the headlines again, it was the quickest way to teach a junior news team the basics of news, and maintain an entertaining programme. The format was in turn copied by UKC Radio's \\"College to College\\" and even Wired! at Goldsmiths \\"Tower to College\\", as one of the longest living speech formats on UK Student Radio. It was nominated for awards by the Student Radio Association (SRA) in 1996. Derivations of the format still exist on air today. In 1989 URE started taking Capital Radio as its overnight \\"sustaining\\" service, when it couldn't provide output. This has been reported to be an innovative piece of programming. At the time Capital was by far the most dominant ILR station in the UK, with highly innovative programming. However, in North Essex, Capital was out of range except for people with a very expensive directional aerial. URE possessed this - and relayed Capital overnight, and for early breakfast until 8am: this considerably drove its listenership, although it took a knock in 1990 when URE's main competition, BBC Radio 1, started broadcasting in FM - previously BBC Radio 1 had been at 1053 & 1089 kHz AM, and for some students switching from FM to AM and back was too complicated, as other Medium Wave stations later also found. Ironically, to celebrate the launch of Radio 1 in FM, Radio 1 toured East Anglia by Helicopter and touched down at the Wivenhoe Park campus: alas, they did so in the middle of the Easter Holidays, and the only people to greet them were members of URE. However the Student Union had become wary of the newly resurgent URE. In 1991 a band of Sabbatical Officers, aware that the main players in URE stood for elections - using it as a platform for their own agendas - demanded cutbacks in URE: the most severe being a move from URE's coveted studio complex above square three to a couple of rooms at the back of the union corridor. However, with URE having by far the most members of any part of the SU, and with far more members actively involved than any other outlet, it was forced to back down in 1992, and fully fund URE, while abiding by its autonomous constitution. Later history The move in studio locations marked a neat change in URE's history. It cost Essex University Students' Union over 20,000 pounds to move the URE studios up the union corridor from their favoured positions above the stairs, to the present position at the end of the union corridor. The move bought a new Air2000 broadcast desk which is in use to this day, plus what at the time was state of the art equipment: Sonifex broadcast cartridges and twin CD vari-speed players. Part of the cost went towards wiring up the new Square three coffee bar with URE speakers. This was the original food bar, before the Hexagon was built, however with the advent of the Square four coffee bar in 1980 it was closed and used as a lecture room. The Square Four coffee bar was wired with twin speakers in the ceiling, a home built amp, an outside broadcast socket for URE's totally unique \\"network\\" sockets. By 1989 a new coffee bar was mooted - the old Square 3 rooms: in a weekend long operation after the coffee bar was finished by estates, URE members put speakers over the ceiling tiles, and then ran a single screened cable under the podia (an operation involving a member walking 20 feet (6.3m) above the ground on a single cable tray), although the speakers were later cut into ceiling tiles, and then run through a single 100 volt transformer. The Square three coffee bar later closed, but in 2006 became what is now called Food on Three, still with the student radio station on speakers in the ceiling. The Square Four coffee bar shut in 1989, and became tutorial rooms, but reopened as SXPress in 2000, however no attempt has been made to put speakers back here, despite the permanent landline. By 1996 the station was the first student radio station to have a digital playout system - Myriad. By 1997 the station was becoming so important to campus life that it was clear that the SU would have to pay for a permanent staff member: this was highly successful, and a permanent Station Manager brought in almost more advertising than the station cost. In 1998 the station started Freely Radiating on 1404 kHz using LPAM, an AM frequency in a tightly defined area restricted by the terms of the licence to the university campus. In the case of URE this was particularly restrictive, as URE was one of the \\"test beds\\" of the first four LPAM AM licences issued by the Radio Authority. URE was of note as at the time it was one of the leading campus radio stations, and with this experimental new licence the authorities were particularly cautious about who should have a licence. URE proved that it could act responsibly, and it led the way by which other student radio stations gained LPAM. Although designed just for campus, in daytime reception was now possible throughout Colchester, however this could not be advertised under the terms of the licence. This transmitter - again, by Wireless Workshop - was initially sited by Bertram Russell tower. This, on a hill by water, was one of the best possible AM transmission sites in Essex. The 1602 kHz LPAM mast had to be moved in 2003 to accommodate new student residences, and was sited behind the Sports Hall. Although in the tradition of URE, 999 kHz on induction loops was maintained as backup. URE closed 999 kHz in 2001 due to the extra costs of two AM licences. By 1997 month-long FM broadcasts became the norm, and these were permitted to be heard by an audience beyond the campus. 20 watts with a mast on the roof of the SU building gave good coverage over North Essex. It gave virtual 24-hour output: these acted as a good advert for the student union, and also broadcast the Sabbatical election hustings, encouraging thousands to vote. URE broadcast in FM from 30 Sep ‚Äì 27 Oct 1997 (during which it also maintained a split service daytime 1404AM output, and had separate jingles for 999 kHz AM. Medium Wave was known as the \\"Gold\\" service, FM was \\"hot hits\\".) There were subsequent FM broadcasts from 6 October to 2 November 1998, from 5 October to 1 November 1999, and from 31 January to 27 February 2005. In 2003 the Students' Union suspended the constitution. This was considered by many to be a devastating blow, and there was much criticism at SU meetings. Instead of URE's management for the following year being voted on by the members who had seen how hard they had worked that year, there was instead to be just one Station Manager, and no other management staff. This was a paid Sabbatical position voted by all SU members, and it also encompassed \\"Rabbit\\", the SU newspaper. The post became a political position, and with little day to day care, URE collapsed and shut down virtually overnight. A massive setback for URE again was the collapse in the summer of 2004 of SBN - the Student Broadcast Network - as the sustaining service. It provided URE with specialist shows and student- orientated news and information via satellite. SBN paid stations for taking syndicated advertising and sponsored shows, which enabled them to buy transmitting and studio equipment. However, in July 2004, SBN's parent company Campus Media ceased its student radio operation at just one weeks notice. URE suffered badly from this cutback, both in loss of revenue, and from the loss of output on air that could not be supplied from automated computer playlists from the studios. The SU took back the sole production studios in 2006, at just one weeks notice. It turned them into offices for non-sabbatical officers, which mean the station could not now produce anything off-air, from debates to trails. The station now just has one room, with the Alice Air 2000 broadcast desk. At one point there was an attempt to re-brand URE as \\"Rabbit Radio\\" - moving in inline with the student newspaper, The Rabbit, this however was heavily resisted and the idea dropped. In 2003 the station was rebranded as RED by the Student Union, however a survey in 2006 showed few people at Essex University associated RED with a radio station. URE or RED - 1404AM still exists today, but massively truncated from its status as previously one of the most dominant radio stations, defining alternative radio listening and leading the Students' Union media outlet of the past four decades. Information on the present day activities of URE can be found at RED - 1404 AM. Notable presenters Several professional presenters started out on URE, including: * Nick Margerrison, who was also Head of Music for 1996/97 * Ian Gardner, a presenter at URE around 1991-1993, particularly of \\"The Nite Spot\\" Other notable presenters were Roy Trubshaw, Nigel Roberts and Michael Tierney.

Background and early career Mant was born in Purley, Surrey on 11 September 1919. His father George was a solicitor who represented the tenth generation of members of the legal profession in the family. Mant was educated at Denstone College before choosing not to follow in his father's footsteps, and in 1939 joined an undergraduate course at St Mary's Hospital Medical School in London on a rugby exhibition. While studying Mant worked as an ambulance driver and plane spotter, and after graduating in 1943 started work in obstetrics and gynaecology at St Mary's. In January 1944 Mant was called up for service in the British Army, and joined the Royal Army Medical Corps. He worked in military hospitals in France and Germany after crossing the English Channel soon after D-Day in June 1944. War crimes investigation Following the end of World War II, in November 1945 Mant was promoted to major and posted as officer in charge of the War Crimes Investigating Team's pathology section covering north-western Europe. His initial task was largely restricted to exhuming the bodies of Allied airmen and other airborne personnel from cemeteries and unmarked graves, concentrating on cases where the German personnel responsible were in custody or it was possible a suspect could be arrested. In 1946 he was put in charge of the Special Medical Section of the British Army's War Crimes Group. His main activities were interviewing people who had been in, or worked for, the SS and were suspected of carrying out human medical experiments in a number of concentration camps in particular Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp. Mant took over 100 statements from staff members and inmates at Ravensbr√ºck, which were used as evidence in later trials. A number of mass graves were also exhumed, and Mant carried out 150 autopsies on exhumed bodies. The Special Medical Section was dissolved in 1948, and Mant returned to Britain. Later career Mant returned to work at his former department at St. Mary‚Äôs, while preparing a thesis on exhumations and autopsies for his doctorate. Dr Keith Simpson, then regarded as England's up-and-coming forensic pathologist, offered Mant a job in the Department of Pathology at Guy's Hospital Medical School. Mant succeeded Simpson as head of the department when Simpson retired in 1972, and was awarded a personal chair in 1974. In addition, Mant was an honorary senior lecturer in forensic medicine at King's College Hospital Medical School and St Mary's Hospital Medical School. Mant also worked for the defence in criminal cases and as a pathologist for the Home Office, and was involved in investigations into the Teddington Towpath murders in the 1950s, the death of anti-racist campaigner Blair Peach, and the deaths of two Provisional Irish Republican Army members who died on hunger strike - Bobby Sands and Michael Gaughan. Mant often lectured in Richmond, Virginia, where he also advised novelist Patricia Cornwell on plots for her mystery novels. Mant retired from Guy's in 1984 but continued to give independent lectures and accept commissions as a pathologist, while also spending more time growing orchids and fishing for trout. He died in Walton-on-Thames on 11 October 2000, survived by his three children, Tim, Philippa and Jonathan.

Ferryboats were of great value, since, because of their flat bottom and shallow draft, they could navigate streams and shallow waters that other ships could not. Construction and design Morse, originally named Marion, was a sidewheel ferryboat built at New York in 1859 by Roosevelt, Joyce & Co. She was in length, with a beam of , draft of and hold depth of . Marion was powered by a 500 hp single-cylinder vertical beam steam engine with bore and stroke, built by the Novelty Iron Works of New York.Silverstone, p. 101. Service history Marion was purchased by the Navy on 7 November 1861, renamed Morse, and armed with two guns. She was commissioned 9 November 1861, Acting Master Peter Hays in command. Morse arrived at Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 20 November 1861 to join the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. She lay off Newport News, Virginia, until 29 December when she steamed across Hampton Roads in an attempt to capture the CSS Sea Bird; Morse's shelling drove the steamer to the protection of three batteries at Sewell's Point. Heated action began for Morse in January 1862 when she joined the Roanoke Island expedition with 16 additional shallow draft gunboats. The expedition departed Hampton Roads 11 January and began bombarding the fortifications 7 February. The campaign resulted in Union capture of the island 8 February, threatening Confederate communications and opening the rear defenses to Norfolk, Virginia. On 9 February, Morse and steamed up Croatan Sound for Elizabeth City, North Carolina, to destroy Confederate gunboats and break up canal communications. Crossing Dismal Swamp Canal, the gunboats spotted Confederate ships and shore batteries. Firing from the ships drove the southerners from their guns and scattered the Confederate vessels. The Union squadron captured or destroyed Confederate ships Sea Bird, Fanny, Ellie, Forrest, and Black Warrior, permitting capture of the town 10 February. Morse and five additional gunboats departed Hatteras Inlet 23 February to reconnoiter Croatan Sound. Strong Confederate forces at Winton, North Carolina, opened heavy fire on , the lead ship, with artillery and musketry. The ships returned the attack, firing on the battery and landing the 9th New York Zouaves, who entered Winton, destroying military stores, tents, arms, and gear. Morse departed Hatteras Inlet with 12 other ships 12 March for Brant Island, Neuse River to cover the disembarkation of troops in the New Berne campaign. The joint Army Navy expedition captured the town 14 March and the last of the batteries the 16th. Morse spent the remainder of the spring and summer scouting and patrolling the York River, protecting transports and aiding operations of the Army on Pamunkey River in June. Joining the James River Flotilla in July, she captured supplies on Mattapony River the following May, scouting the river to Frazier's Ferry and silencing Confederate guns above West Point, Virginia. Morse joined seven others in capturing Fort Powhatan, James River 14 July 1863. In November, Morse joined the expedition to Mathews County, Virginia, a peninsula between Mobjack Bay and Piankatank River and a base for Confederate raiders. Information from captured guerrillas on plans to capture a schooner and to destroy the lights on Chesapeake Bay sent Morse up East River to throttle these efforts. After searching out torpedoes (mines) on Purtan Bay in February 1864, Morse joined General Wister's campaign on the Mattapony River, attacking King and Queen Courthouse. One thousand infantry went ashore from the Union ships at Sheppard's Landing 13 March. After a feint attack on West Point, Virginia, in May, Morse evacuated troops from that point. After scouting duty throughout the spring and summer, Morse joined the Potomac Flotilla later in the winter.

Its adherents were known as Morrisites, and schismatic sects have been defunct since 1969, excepting the Order of Enoch. History =Origins= In 1857, Joseph Morris, an English convert to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, reported receiving revelations naming him the Seventh Angel from the Book of Revelation. He wrote Brigham Young, seeking recognition of his calling from the church. Young did not respond to Morris' request or any of his subsequent letters through 1860.C. LeRoy Anderson Morrisite Collection . Marie Eccles-Caine Archive of Intermountain Americana. Utah State University Libraries: Special Collections and Archives. In 1860, Morris began to collect followers to a group that became known as the Morrisites. In February 1861, John Taylor and Wilford Woodruff excommunicated Morris from the LDS Church. On April 6, 1861, Morris and his followers organized the Church of the Firstborn and called all of his followers to gather at Kingston (Kington) Fort, a fort on the Weber River that had been abandoned in 1858.Ruth Malan, \\"Three-day war focus of new monument\\", Standard-Examiner (Ogden, UT), 2006-11-02. Pluses section. By midsummer 1861, the group reached 300 followers. Joseph Morris, leader of the Church of the Firstborn Morris told his followers that the Second Coming was imminent and not to bother with planting crops. They may have trampled some of their crops into the ground as evidence of their faith. The group pooled available supplies and waited at Kingston Fort. =Membership= An eight-page Roll of Membership, Names of Persons Baptized into the Fulness of the Gospel was published in San Francisco in 1886.For more information on Dove see Richard Neitzel Holzapfel, \\"The Flight of the Doves from Utah Mormonism to California Morrisitism: The Saga of James and George Dove.\\" in Differing Visions: Dissenters in Mormon History edited by Roger Launius and Linda Thatcher. Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1994. 196-219. An introduction to the roll reads: \\"Names of persons baptized during the administration of Joseph Morris, at South Weber, Utah Territory, in the years of 1861 and 1862.\\" The Roll of Membership then lists alphabetically the names of 430 individuals. At the conclusion of the list the publisher notes: \\"All the names that we found in the record book are in this list. We feel assured that there were many persons baptized whose names were not recorded.\\"For a list of individuals see Geo. Dove's Roll of Membership RootsWeb, MORRISITES-L Archives =Leadership= A copy of the Roll of Membership housed in the Archives of the Community of Christ includes notations in pencil identifying those in positions of authority next to the following individuals: John Banks, Prescy.; John Cook, Apostle; Richard Cook, Presidency; James Cowan, Apostle; James Dove, apostle; John R. Eardley, Apostle; Mark Hill Forscutt, Apostle; Gudmund Gudmundson, Apostle; William Harris, Bishop; Niels Jacobson, Apostle; John E. Jones, Apostle; William Kendell, Apostle; R. J. Livingstone, Apostle; James Mather, Apostle; John Parson, Apostle; Abraham Taylor, Apostle; John Trolsen, Apostle. =Morrisite War= By spring 1862, food was scarce and some members were becoming discontented. Morris repeatedly designated certain days for the Second Coming, only to have those days pass uneventfully.G.M. Howard, \\"Men, Motives, and Misunderstandings: A New Look at the Morrisite War of 1862\\". Each time this happened, a handful of members would recover their possessions from the community pool and leave the congregation. With the steady outflux of members, the question of property entitlement became contentious. Those who stayed behind felt those who left were taking better stock and other items than they had initially contributed to the community pool. Soon after three departing members ‚Äî William Jones, one of Morris's first converts, John Jensen, and Lars C. Geertsen ‚Äî vowed revenge after what they perceived as an unfair reckoning, they seized a load of wheat en route from Kingston to Kaysville for milling. The Morrisites sent a group of men after them, and the group soon captured the three and the wheat. The church held the men prisoner in a small cabin, to be \\"tried by the Lord when he came.\\" Eventually, the Utah territorial militia was ordered to arrest Morris and the other leaders of the church. On June 15, 1862, Morris was killed in a skirmish and other Morrisite leaders were taken prisoner. A monument commemorating the Morrisite War stands in South Weber, Utah. =Scattering and regathering= A Morrisite meetinghouse in Race Track, Powell County, Montana with the inscription \\"The Lord's House.\\" Although seven Morrisites were convicted of murder and 66 others were convicted of resisting arrest, territorial governor Stephen S. Harding pardoned them all three days after being convicted, and the Morrisites scattered across the western United States. Ultimately, many of the members of the church began to regather in Deer Lodge County, Montana under the leadership of George Williams, who declared himself to be the \\"Prophet Cainan\\" and Morris's rightful successor. In January 1879, Williams prophesied that Deer Lodge County would be the site of the Second Coming of Christ. Williams was frequently away from Montana, living mostly in Salt Lake City, Utah and England. Williams recorded many revelations that he said he received from God, and also authored St. Ann's Hill Record, which he claimed was a record of ancient origin. =Schism and extinction= After Williams died in 1882, the church divided into a number of schisms, each claiming to be led by Williams's rightful successor. The largest group, based in Montana, was led by John R. Eardley, who renamed the church the Church of Jesus Christ of Saints of the Most High. By the 1950s, most of the members of the church had died and it was officially disbanded in 1969. Teachings Twenty-four years after the death of Joseph Morris, a collection of his \\"Revelations, Articles, and Letters\\" were published by George S. Dove & Company in 1886 under the title The Spirit Prevails. The revelations were recorded between 1857 and 1862 and constituted sacred scripture for Morris's followers. Like most Latter Day Saint denominations, the Church of the Firstborn taught that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God. The church taught that Smith's rightful successor after his death was James Strang, and that Strang was succeeded by Joseph Morris. What set the Church of the Firstborn apart from the majority of Latter Day Saint sects was its belief in reincarnation. Called \\"baby resurrection\\" by the church, Morris and Williams taught that reincarnation was taught by Joseph Smith and that the majority of other Latter Day Saint sects are in apostasy for rejecting these teachings. Each of the successive leaders of the church were believed to be the reincarnation of a significant prophet of old: Joseph Smith was the reincarnation of Mormon and the Apostle Paul; Joseph Morris was the reincarnation of Moses; and George Williams was the reincarnation of Cainan. Morris prophesied that Jesus would be reincarnated and born to an Arab in Jerusalem in 1909; some have identified Dr. Dahesh as the fulfilment of this prophecy.See, e.g., Darrick Evenson, \\"An (sic) Brief History of THE CHURCH OF THE FIRSTBORN (The Morrisites): Founded by the Prophets Joseph Morris and George Williams . The Church of the Firstborn rejected other teachings of Brigham Young and the LDS Church, including plural marriage and temple ordinances. Bah√°'√≠s Under the Provisions of the Covenant One of Williams' prophesies was that Deer Lodge, Montana would be the site of the Second Coming of Christ. This prophecy was discovered by leaders of the Bah√°'√≠s Under the Provisions of the Covenant (BUPC) founded by Leland Jensen and was considered a confirmation of Jensen's prophetic calling. Jensen taught that the Montana State Prison in Deer Lodge, where he had been incarcerated, was actually Ezekiel's Temple. In a 1991 press release the BUPC explained: \\"The appointment of the Second IBC (International Baha'i Council) is an epic- making event that parallels the announcement of the return of Jesus in Ezekiel's Temple in Deer Lodge. This event was heralded by the migration of the Morrisites to Deer Lodge, Montana under the direction of the Mormon prophet, George Williams, as John the Baptist heralded Jesus on his first coming. In April 1863, about the same time Bah√° ºu'll√°h made his proclamation in Baghdad, Iraq the Morrisites came to Deer Lodge by the instruction of George Williams to 'prepare the way of the Lord,' the second coming of Jesus whose mission is to establish the New World Order...\\"Anderson, C.

History The party was founded in 1994 as the Italian Liberal Right (DLI) by members of the right-wing of the Italian Liberal Party (PLI). Leading members included Gabriele Pagliuzzi, Giuseppe Basini, Luciano Magnalb√≤ and Saverio Porcari Lidestri.http://www.laquintastagione.com/wp/?p=1789 The DLI soon allied itself with the National Alliance (AN), of which it became the liberal faction. In the 1994, 1996 and 2001 general elections, some members of DLI, including Pagliuzzi, Basini and Magnalb√≤ were elected in the Italian Parliament for AN. In 2001 Pagliuzzi and Basini left AN, due to their exclusion from party lists for the general election, and re-established DLI, renaming it the Liberal Right ‚Äì Liberals for Italy (Destra Liberale ‚Äì Liberali per l'Italia, DL-LpI). Basini left the DL-LpI in 2004 in order to join the re- established Italian Liberal Party of Stefano De Luca, while Pagliuzzi remained in charge of party leadership. Magnalb√≤ was Senator for AN until 2006 and then joined the new PLI in June 2007. By 2007, DL-LpI had become a tiny liberal political action committee. On 23 October, Eugenio Riccio (former member of the Italian Social Movement and later of AN) joined Pagliuzzi in a convention on the future of the party.

These two elements put together can lead to classification the party's ideology as national liberalism. As heirs of the right-wing liberal tradition of Italy, DLI members were keen on supporting national identity and centralism. Thus they strongly opposed any form of federalism and proposed the abolition of the Regions, including those with special statute, and the Provinces in Italy.

Seven volumes have been published in Korea, all of which have been translated into English. Each chapter starts or ends with a modified tarot card often relating to the story, featuring well known commercial tarot decks replaced with story characters.  Plot  In contemporary Great Britain, Pamela is the owner of a mysterious Tarot Caf√©. After midnight, she receives supernatural clients who come to her for advice through tarot readings. From cats to fairies to vampires, they tell her their stories even as she unravels their past, present and future through her cards. In exchange for her advice, they pay her with beads of Berial's Necklace, which Pamela gathers for her own secret ends.  Characters  Pamela: Pamela was orphaned at age eleven when her mother was burned at the stake for witchcraft. As a result of her mother's begging, she was spared, despite having the ability to foresee the future. Led away from the village by a priest, Pamela was abandoned in the forest. After a chance encounter, she was raised by a dragon named Ash, who ultimately became both her lover and her mentor. Years later, Ash was murdered, and whilst dying in Pamela's arms, inadvertently gave Pamela his immortal life through a drop of blood from his heart, which manifested as a mark on her forehead. After trying unsuccessfully to end her life by many means, she makes a pact with Belus. In exchange for collecting the beads of Berial's necklace, he has agreed to kill her. Now, hundreds of years later, she is the wise proprietor of the Tarot Caf√©. She is both kind and stern with her many customers, particularly her \\"special\\" ones. In her own words, she doesn't profess to know the future but instead depends on examining her clients to fully understand their motivations and problems. Also to aid her is a vast store of esoteric knowledge, particularly identification of magical creatures, and her companion Belus. Pamela is a kind-hearted young woman, shown when she takes in the young werewolf Aaron after he comes to her for a tarot reading, but at times cynical about humanity (though not quite to the extent of Belus). She has a complicated relationship with Belus, who she is bound to by a pact. While they outwardly appear to dislike each other and violently deny any sort of romantic relationship with one another, they tolerate and ultimately depend on one another for strength (or a good shove in one direction or another). However, he is simply an aspect of Belial, and being a devil he toys with her, revealing his true form and forcing her to choose between seeing her mother in heaven by killing Ash, and living forever. When she is saved, she remains close to Aaron and Neribos, saying goodbye to him when he dies. When Belus returns, he attempts in desperation to re-establish their old contract. However, she reveals she has decided to live, and tentatively lets him back into her life after he admits that he's lonely. It is implied they stay together and begin their relationship anew. Belus: A mysterious young man with an intimate tie with Pamela, Belus is always at her shop to annoy her or offer cynical remarks about humanity and her clients. When they first \\"meet\\" he claims to be Prince of Pandemonium. After she is thrown in a body of water as a witch, he rescues her from a mob. He is often shown smoking a small opium pipe. Mercurial and flippant, he nevertheless shows a serious side, particularly when Pamela is threatened, slaughtering many to save her life. This may be because he has made a pact with her; in exchange for her gathering all the pieces of the mystic 'Belial's Necklace', he will end her immortal life. He also has a strange connection with Ash and Nebiros, and seems to know either everything or nothing at all about any given subject. He is often found to be involved in different episodes where one might not expect him to be. According to Ash, who hates Pamela because Belus his only friend as a child, he left to find her because she made him happier than anyone else. Despite his normal appearance, he exhibits several supernatural traits - his stamina, strength, speed and damage resistance are all far above humans, surviving falls and injuries that would kill humans and most immortals, and able to strangle a feral werewolf to near death without straining himself. Later in the series it is revealed he is capable of great magical feats. Eventually, he comes to be nearly killed defending Pamela, but appears in Hell where he and Pamela sleep together after he saves her life. In the end, it is revealed that Belus is just another form of Belial, who genuinely loves Pamela, but being a Devil and not knowing anything else, he has been playing a cruel game with her because she is the only thing that amuses him. He attempts to force her to choose between living for the rest of eternity, or killing Ash and dying. When she is saved by God, he goes into isolation for 60 years, only admitting his feelings when Neribos visits him to taunt him about love. At the end, he goes back to find Pamela after receiving a handkerchief soaked with her tears from Nebiros, and she lets him in. The two of them decide to spend the rest of eternity together with neither one dying, though it is unclear what their relationship becomes. Aaron: Abused and ultimately sold by his alcoholic father, Aaron is a young boy who once was the companion of a demon named Nebiros, who granted his every wish. He ultimately grew dissatisfied in Nebiros's castle, and is lured by the enticing company of a young shepherd girl who persuaded him to run away with her. Once he left the castle, however, she turned into a werewolf and bit him with the intention of devouring him. Although Nebiros arrived in time to save him, Nebiros was stung by his young charge's betrayal and abandoned him. With a bite wound from the female werewolf, Aaron is now cursed to turn into a werewolf every full moon. After Pamela takes him from the streets and reads his cards, she hires him as her cafe employee. He is a flighty but good- hearted boy (described by Pamela as having 'the nose of a dog and the brain of a bird') who is haunted by the horrific change that comes over him every month and with the memory of the man who was like a true father to him. He is kidnapped and rescued by Nebiros and sixty years later at the end of the story, he is seen dying as an eighty-year-old man after Nebiros and he finally reconciled with each other, with Nebiros promising Aaron that they would see each other again once Nebiros returned to the rank of an angel. Ash (past): Ash is the name of two virtually identical men with intimate connections to Pamela: one her former teacher and lover and the other a mysterious young man who suddenly appears on Pamela's doorstep. The past Ash was a dragon of great rank, though a kind, slightly scatterbrained recluse, in comparison to his closest friend, the serious and belligerent, though dutiful, Emperor Alecto. This is a deception however, though he does love Pamela, he admits to loving himself more, and is described by Belial himself as \\"the coldest person\\" he knows. He discovered Pamela after her mother was executed, and raised her, ultimately falling in love with her against the misgivings of Alecto. Pamela's and Ash's idyllic existence soon was shattered upon Ash's death and the passing of his immortality to her with the first drop of blood from his heart. Despite his love for Pamela and his genuine affection for Alecto, he truly detested life, describing his heart as stone and wanted nothing more to die, unleashing a tragic series of events that resulted in Pamela's anguished inheritance of his immortality. Ash (present): The present day Ash appears to have no memories of his past and yet seems to attract the worst sort of company. Despite his sweet, almost innocent demeanor, he is in reality a cruel sociopath who has no trouble torturing and seducing others for mere amusement. He was apparently raised by the curious fortuneteller Cora since childhood though he shows her no real affection. He has a similarly tumultuous relationship with Belus, able to threaten the other man without repercussions, though due to Belus's true nature it is unsure how much of this is Belus humouring him for his own ends. According to him, Belus was his teacher and friend, but abandoned him for Pamela, causing him to hate her. Eventually he comes to be kidnapped by a confused Alecto and after a failed seduction attempt, faints at the speaking of the Past Ash's full name. Once he is returned, he comes to haunt both Pamela and Cora's steps once more, culminating in a devastating revelation about his past and purpose. Alecto tells the Ash that he is only a doll created by Belial and given life by a gemstone of Belial's necklace. Eventually, it is revealed that he is actually the real Ash, who had signed a contract with Belial for a new life in which one may die, be reborn, and have an end. After 60 years passed at the end of the series, Ash is seen as a young student among a group of friends walking past Pamela. Both of them share a long stare, before looking away. When questioned by one of his friends whether he knows her, Ash answers \\"no.\\" Alecto: Another dragon from the days of Dark England, apparently the Emperor of Dragons, with a grim prophecy hanging over him: the day he falls in love with a human female would be the day death takes him. Though friends with Ash, he treats him with open contempt and a gruff concern, particularly regarding Ash raising Pamela. His callousness extends to the point that he calls Ash a useless dragon, and were he a female Alecto would impregnate the other to propagate the species. Belatedly finding of Ash's death from a loyal wind servant, he was unable to find anything at the site of the death. He has since hunted Pamela, insistent she killed Ash, whether in malice or carelessness. So when he finally finds her, and proceeds to attack her, who should walk into the cafe but Ash himself. Confused, Alecto questions him fiercely, only to be told that this was not the real Ash. Refusing to accept the fact, he later kidnaps Ash and chains him in his bedchamber. After nearly being taken in by Ash's charms, he flees and later returns to explain to the new Ash about his past. When he speaks the past Dragon's name, he is then thrown back by a mysterious force later revealed to be Belial and obliterated. Later, it is revealed he was sent to Hell and spoke with a three-headed crone who told him his fate. It is later revealed that Alecto was also in love with Pamela since he first saw her and that he wishes to kill her to end his pain. He is infected by a Mind Worm, causing him to go insane, and is eventually killed in his dragon form by Belus. Nebiros: Nebiros is a mysterious figure and the foster father of Aaron. He claims to be a demon though he is more commonly associated with werewolves, who fear and adore him. Some time before, he had \\"purchased\\" Aaron from his drunken father and lured him into a secluded castle. He provides the boy with everything he desires and soon takes him as a confidant. Cursed by \\"forces of light,\\" (possibly for siding with Lucifer and the rebel angels in the War of Heaven) he becomes wracked with pain and must remain in isolation. Despite this curse, he is a powerful demon, able to turn underlings into stone with one touch of his sigil ring. Upon Aaron's betrayal, he abandons the boy and isolates himself. Oddly enough, he seems to be acquaintances with Belus, though he shows no liking for the other male. It is revealed at the end that Nebiros was a former angel who was cast from heaven and turned into a demon by the Almighty. He is Belial's rival, explaining his connection with Belus (Belus is another form of Belial). He later returns for Aaron and leads Pamela to Belial in Hell, getting his revenge on Belial as he can watch whilst he unwittingly betrays and crushes the thing he loves most, Pamela, forcing Belial to live without her. At the end, he somewhat helps Belial to reconcile with Pamela knowing the truth about his seclusion, saying Belus can't hide the truth of his real love for Pamela from him since they're brothers after all, and gives him a tissue soaked with Pamela's tears. He also reconciles with Aaron sixty years later in the storyline and waits to return to his angelic status so he can be with Aaron in Heaven. Cora: A mysterious albino fortune teller. She found the present day Ash when he was just a child and raised him. When she goes to find Pamela later, Pamela is shocked at the resemblance between her mother and Cora. Upon meeting, Cora dissolves and leaves behind a gemstone from Belial's necklace, indicating that she was a doll like Ash. Victor: A wicked monk from Pamela's past who was in love with Pamela. After she refused him (on the grounds that she was in love with another and that Victor must only love God as a monk), he attempts to rape her. He declares he would have her even if he had to make a deal with the devil. After she escapes, he makes a contract with Belial to have the strength to kill Ash, become immortal, and win Pamela. Though he succeeds in killing Ash, he does not obtain his other desires, as Belial only promised to give him the means, the fact he failed was his fault. Berial/Belial: A devil-like figure. Known as the King of Fear and Deceit, Lord of Fire, Great Prince, and Noble of Malice (among other titles) and has great power in hell, rivaled only by Nebiros. It is implied throughout the series that despite being a Devil, he is simply bored rather than evil, though due to his power he has no respect for most people and treats them as pawns in his games to amuse himself. These games are usually cruel and malicious, no matter what he feels towards the individuals themselves. Belial is first introduced with the concept of his necklace: The necklace holds immense power but was broken apart. These pieces gravitate towards mystical beings but have no power by themselves. Belus charged Pamela with collecting the bead in return for her death. It is later revealed that Belial disguised himself as a Sage who gave bread to the poor when Pamela was a child. When Pamela and her mother went to him for food, the girl's power let her see his true evil form, a winged demon feeding people the dead. This impressed and intrigued Belial, who then set about making Pamela immortal by granting Ash's wish to die (he wanted Pamela around forever so that he could continue to \\"enjoy\\" her). It is further revealed that he was responsible for creating Cora and the present day Ash with gemstones from his necklace and that they, along with Alecto, Pamela, and Belus, were pawns in his games. At the end of the series, it is revealed that Belial and Belus are one and the same and that he actually loves Pamela, but being a Devil and not knowing how to deal with this, plays a cruel game with her that only succeeds in driving her away. He was also disguised as the first monk who decreed that the mother must die but that Pamela was young enough to possibly be redeemed. After 60 years in isolation, Belial/Belus is gloated over by Nebiros, as since he and Belial are brothers, he knows Belial truly loved Pamela, claiming he enjoyed watching Belial rip himself apart, and leaves a handkerchief Pamela cried into. He begins to hope he can have this love reciprocated through Belus, an aspect of himself that Pamela loves, and attempts to re-establish his old contract with her just for a reason to contact her. When she reveals her desire to live, she tentatively lets him in, and it is implied they stay together, though it is unknown what happens to his realm in Hell after he leaves.

Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 323 U.S. 57, 60 (1944); Estate of Rockefeller v.

However, the IRS, with approval of the courts, has insisted on a high degree of sameness between the new position sought and the previous means of employment.Estate of Rockefeller, 762 F.2d at 268 This means that if substantial differences exist between the duties, tasks, and activities of the taxpayer's prior job and those of the job he now seeks,Id. at 268‚Äì69 (and cited cases) then the expenses incurred will be deemed to be start-up costs, and not subject to immediate deduction.See Id. at 269 (quoting Davis v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 65 T.C. 1014, 1019 (1976)) Similarly, if the taxpayer has undergone a significant hiatus between the prior position of employment and the one now sought, expenses will not be considered \\"carrying on\\" the business or trade.Id. at 270 (and cited references) Again, whether a hiatus would be considered significant is highly fact- and context-specific. The relevant inquiry here should be whether there is a \\"substantial lack of continuity.\\"Id. If the taxpayer terminated his previous employment with little indication of seeking a new position in the same profession, it is likely that time spent unemployed or employed in a different field would prevent the taxpayer from claiming that he was \\"carrying on\\" his prior business or trade.Id. The ability to deduct the costs of seeking new employment is a distinct advantage for many taxpayers, but one likely to be overlooked. To recap, a taxpayer may only deduct the costs associated with seeking new employment when that taxpayer is searching for a new employer in substantially the same profession. Further, a significant hiatus between jobs may bar claiming this type of deduction.

An interest fair is an event somewhat like a science fair usually organized by a school that involves a group of corrugated cardboard boards on which students put information on their favorite topic or hobby Originally they also had to write a short paper. Unlike a science fair, it has both competitive and non-competitive elements. History of the Interest Fair =History of the Fair= The interest fair originated in Columbus, Ohio at St. Joseph Montessori school. It was created as an alternative to the science fair because they wanted more flexibility. They wanted to focus on the student. When they did it they invited 6- to 14-year-old students to do an interest fair, but required the older students to do it. The students were judged and had to tell visitors about their Interest Fair board. =Evolution of the Fair= Over time the idea caught on, and it has evolved between schools, so it has been seen in many variations. In some schools the competitive element is completely removed, so there are no judges. In others, only the upper grade levels get to participate. In some places the students do not have to discuss their topic with visitors. Sometimes the students have to write a paper. The project may be optional or required. The rubric is almost always used.

Zhang Da'an was one of the sons of Zhang Gongjin (ÂºµÂÖ¨Ë¨π), a key follower of Li Shimin (the eventual Emperor Taizong) the Prince of Qin, a son and major general of Tang's founder Emperor Gaozu, who supported Li Shimin in his rivalry with his brother Li Jiancheng the Crown Prince. When Li Shimin feared that Li Jiancheng was about to kill him in 626, Zhang Gongjin was a major proponent of launching a preemptive strike against Li Jiancheng and another brother who supported Li Jiancheng, Li Yuanji the Prince of Qi, and when Li Shimin did so (in an incident known as the Incident at Xuanwu Gate), Zhang defended Li Shimin's mansion against counterattacks by Li Jiancheng's and Li Yuanji's followers after Li Shimin killed Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji. Zhang Gongjin died in 632 at the age of 38 and was eventually posthumously created the Duke of Tan and honored in one of the Portraits at Lingyan Pavilion, reserved for the greatest contributors to Emperor Taizong's reign. It is not known when Zhang Da'an himself was born, but it is known that he had at least two older brothers, Zhang Daxiang (ÂºµÂ§ßË±°) and Zhang Dasu (ÂºµÂ§ßÁ¥†). Less is known about Zhang Da'an's career than his father's. By 677, he was serving on the staff of Li Xian, the crown prince of Emperor Gaozong (Emperor Taizong's son), when he was given the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Sanpin (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ã‰∏âÂìÅ), making him a chancellor de facto. He and another staff member, Liu Nayan (ÂäâË®•Ë®Ä), were key contributors in a project led by Li Xian in writing commentaries for the Book of Later Han, the official history of the Eastern Han Dynasty. In 680, Li Xian, who had lost the favor of Emperor Gaozong's powerful wife Empress Wu (later known as Wu Zetian), was accused of plotting treason, deposed, and exiled. Most of the staff members were pardoned, but Liu was exiled, and Zhang was also accused of flattering the former crown prince and demoted to the post of Pu Prefecture (ÊôÆÂ∑û, roughly modern Ziyang, Sichuan). He died in 684, while serving as the military advisor to the prefect of Heng Prefecture (Ê©´Â∑û, roughly modern Nanning, Guangxi).

He moved to Los Angeles in 1990. Steele gained recognition for his unusual multi-figure compositions of an exceptionally large scale. His areas of expertise also include portraits, nudes and plein-air landscapes. Based on his interviews, Steele expresses strong interest in the direction of art in the 21st century. Background Alexey Steele began his art training at an early age in the studio of his father, Socialist Realism painter Leonid Mikhailovich Steele. The young artist furthered his professional education at the Surikov Art Institute of the Soviet Academy of Arts in Moscow, studying under the well- known yet controversial painter Ilya Glazunov. Steele had his first one-man exhibition in the United States at the Carnegie Museum of Art in California in 2004.  Work  Even though his Russian heritage is often noted in his palette as well as the treatment of his subjects, Steele's approach to figure is rooted in the Renaissance and Baroque periods. At the same time, his works possess a modern feel and intensity in their disregard of the mainstream and in their peculiar audacity of grand scale and grand themes. Steele's fusion of realistically rendered forms with allegorical elements almost impose his personal world on the viewer, resulting in strongly metaphorical imagery as in his 20-foot ‚ÄúSoul of the Hero,‚Äù executed for a private residence in LA, and his depiction of Mick Fleetwood in ‚ÄúBlue Rose.‚Äù Through its broad thematic range, Steele's work exhibits a fascination with the expressive possibilities of figure based on a skillful representation of dynamic foreshortenings, and the ability to construct complex compositions. At the same time, his depiction of epic grandeur comes across even in his plein-air landscape works, as in ‚ÄúGlowing Cliff,‚Äù and in his portrayal of larger than life contemporary personalities, such as the portrait of ‚ÄúDonna Fleischer.‚Äù Solving various problems in the development of his mammoth works, Steele employs largely forgotten Renaissance period processes. He is known for creating full size drawings, referred to as ‚Äúcartoons,‚Äù which attract attention in their own right, as opposed to other artists who may use such drawings as only preliminary sketches. Steele's venture into the public art arena was marked by the ‚ÄúAngel of Unity,‚Äù executed for a city-related public art project noted in the Los Angeles Times on June 5, 2003. It explores the archetypical commonalities of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. In December 2008 the Carnegie Art Museum commissioned and acquired to its permanent collection Steele's major master drawing \\"Quiet Steps of Approaching Thunder\\" (72 x 48) which links figurative art to our era of crisis. Continuing work on his large scale drawings, in August 2011 he exhibited an epic cartoon measuring 100\\" X 80\\" titled \\"Rising: Jaboy, Christian, Derron, Michael, Luis\\" in \\"The New Romantic Figure\\", a ground breaking group show of figurative works by prominent Californian artists at California Lutheran University's Kwan Fong Gallery. For his heroic approach to art and his crusading personality, Steele is sometimes described as ‚ÄúA Modern Warrior of Art.‚Äù He is an unabashed proponent of 21st Century figurative art, saying ‚ÄúAmerican realism is the true non-conformism of our time, and that‚Äôs exciting; that‚Äôs the most exciting thing that‚Äôs happened to the art world since Picasso‚Äù in an interview for CLU.The New Romantic Figure, Video Interview with the Artists. August 21st 2011. CLU Media Arts Lab. In June 2009, Steele received Artemis Award for celebrating the power and beauty of women through his art on a heroic scale in the modern world particularly in his multi-figure compositions ‚ÄúThe Circle‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Soul of The Hero‚Äù. He was one of the 14 distinguished honorees and came to Athens for the Annual Euro-American Women's Council's Global Forum sponsored by the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Culture, and the Mayor of Athens. In November 2009, Alexey Steele received Gusi Peace Prize in the Philippines for his work on turning art into a tool of International Conflict Resolution and for his \\"Fire of Peace\\" composition. In the works since 2001, \\"Fire of Peace\\" serves as the modern day icon for new inter- cultural paradigm of inclusive unity and mutual respect, reflecting broader pluralistic culture while remaining viable to traditional communities, thus encouraging a seismic shift in their fundamental perception of each other, presenting an inspiring vision of lasting acceptance and embrace among most vital to World Peace Jewish, Christian and Muslim communities. In March 2010, Steele founded NOVOREALISM, a venture consisting of an online magazine, gallery and academy, and aimed at explaining his views in contemporary art.  Trivia  Steele's noted painting ‚ÄúDesire of Light‚Äù appeared on the cover of actress/model/singer/fashion designer Milla Jovovich‚Äôs 1993 album ‚ÄúDivine Comedy.‚Äù This led the record company to employ the strategic placement of a sticker on the figure's breasts for which 17-year-old Jovovich posed. Director David Lynch used Steele's painting ‚ÄúBattle of the Angels‚Äù in his commercial. ‚ÄúBattle of the Angels‚Äù also appeared in a Toyota commercial representing the office of a sinister financial ruler of the world. It is rumored that the theme for this work was suggested to the artist by actor Sylvester Stallone. Steele inspired disturbing concepts on singer-activist Catman Cohen's album covers for ‚ÄúHow I want to die‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow I want to Live.\\" Steele's trademark appearance was the subject of a Bill Maher joke involving ‚ÄúAlexey‚Äôs Mustache Enhancer‚Äù on the HBO program, ‚ÄúReal Time with Bill Maher‚Äù (September 14, 2007, Episode 108).

Ottenheimer is a former Cabinet minister in the government of Danny Williams and represented the district of St. John's East for the Progressive Conservative Party from 1996 to 2007. He unsuccessfully ran for the leadership of the Progressive Conservatives in 2014 losing to Paul Davis. Between 2003 and 2007, Ottenheimer served as the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, the Minister of Health and Community Services, and as the Minister of Education. He also briefly served as acting Minister of Municipal Affairs and acting Minister of Natural Resources. He left provincial politics in 2007 and was later appointed chairman of Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro. Background Ottenheimer was born in St. John's, Newfoundland in 1953. He is the younger half-brother of former Progressive Conservative leader and Canadian Senator Gerry Ottenheimer. In 1974 he graduated from Memorial University of Newfoundland with a Bachelor of Arts degree and a Bachelor of Education Degree. He would later receive a graduate diploma and his Masters of Education. After working as a high school teacher in St. John's and as a principal throughout the province he decided to go back to school and become a lawyer. in 1982, Ottenheimer received his Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Windsor. Ottenheimer practised law in St. John's and was also a lecturer in property law at Cabot College and a lecturer in Law and Education at the Faculty of Education of Memorial University. His wife Helen Conway-Ottenheimer was elected in the 2019 provincial election in the district of Harbour Main. Provincial politics =Opposition MHA= In the 1996 provincial election Ottenheimer defeated Liberal incumbent Hubert Kitchen in the district of St. John's East, winning the seat for the Progressive Conservatives. His win came despite the Liberals winning an overwhelming majority government and the PC Party losing seven seats from the previous election. Ottenheimer was easily re-elected in the district in the 1999 general election. From 1996 to 2003 Ottenheimer served in opposition and was a critic for a number of ministries. Ottenheimer had considered running for the party's leadership following the 1996 and 1999 general elections, but did not enter either race. =Minister of Education= Ottenheimer was re-elected in the 2003 provincial election and the Progressive Conservatives won a majority government under Danny Williams. Weeks after the election Williams appointed Ottenheimer as the province's Minister of Education. In February 2004, Ottenheimer confirmed that the provincial government would maintain the post-secondary education tuition freeze. The PC Party had committed to maintaining the freeze in their 2003 election platform but following a review of the province's finances the new government began to make sweeping budgetary cuts. =Minister of Health and Community Services= On October 1, 2004, Ottenheimer was named minister of Health and Community Services, succeeding Elizabeth Marshall who quit the post after a public dispute with Williams over his management style. In October 2005, it was reported that Eastern Health, the province's largest health authority, was reviewing breast cancer tests dating back to 1997. The health authority later announced that between 1997 and 2005 over 400 women received inaccurate test results. The incident led the provincial government to call a judicial commission of inquiry into the conduct of Eastern Health. The Cameron Inquiry began in May 2007 and finished hearing testimony in October 2008. Ottenheimer was questioned at the inquiry in March 2008, about his role in the matter. Prior to Ottenheimer's testimony, it was reported that he had found out about the error in the testings on July 19, 2005, several months before it was reported in the media. Ottenheimer stated that he had wanted to go public with the information when he found out but was advised by officials at Eastern Health not to. In March 2005, Ottenheimer blacked out on an airplane en route to Gander and had a pacemaker installed later in the day. The incident led to Ottenheimer taking a two-month leave of absence from cabinet. =Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs= On March 16, 2006, Ottenheimer was appointed Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. The move to the less demanding portfolio was a result of the health issues he faced the previous year. Ottenheimer said he needed a lifestyle change and had spoken to Williams the week prior to the shuffle about his health. On June 15, 2007, Ottenheimer announced he would not be seeking re-election in that year's provincial election. Federal politics On March 30, 2011, Ottenheimer announced that he would be the Conservative Party of Canada candidate in the district of Random‚ÄîBurin‚ÄîSt. George's in the 2011 federal election. He was defeated by Liberal incumbent Judy Foote, receiving 8,322 votes. Leadership bid Ottenheimer unsuccessfully ran for the leadership of the provincial Progressive Conservatives in 2014 losing to Paul Davis. He subsequently decided against running for the federal Conservative nomination in Avalon for the 2015 election. Davis subsequently appointed Ottenheimer to head the Newfoundland and Labrador Housing Corporation. He was termination without cause from the NL Housing Corp. in 2016 following the Liberals forming government. In 2018, he returned to law joining the Morrow, Morrow & Crosbie firm in Bay Roberts.

It is a supply chain software developer for nonprofits and those involved in the supply chain of humanitarian relief including disaster relief, medical relief, and hunger relief. It is headquartered in Dallas, TX. The President and CEO is Mark Theilken, a former executive at IBM in the U.S. and Asia-Pacific. Aidmatrix was merged with Atlanta-based organization, Techbridge, Inc. as of January 1 of 2015. TechBridge is a nonprofit that drives community impact by bringing affordable technology and business expertise to other nonprofits.  History  The Aidmatrix Foundation, Inc. began with a group of i2 Technologies‚Äô employees who set up the i2 Foundation. Jason Rushton, an i2 employee and former captain of military logistics automation, initiated the plan of using i2's supply chain management technology for use in disaster relief. While serving in Kosovo, he saw how difficult it was for organizations to get the items they needed most in disaster situations. Ms. Lekha Singh is the visionary behind Aidmatrix. Ms. Singh not only founded the organization but also pioneered the use of innovative technology to change the way aid is delivered both in disaster relief and in day-to-day needs. She was concerned that much needed food and medical supplies were going to the landfill while many people went hungry and without medicine.

Plot Anand is a twelve-year-old boy who lives in modern India. A believer in fairy tales and magic, he used to go to school until his family could no longer afford to pay for his lessons. His father had left two years before the start of the story. His sister, Meera, on the other hand, had been hurt mentally when she witnessed a murder. Thus, Anand and his mother had been forced to work. Anand has been employed by a tea shop owner, Haru, who is frequently displeased with Anand's work and pays very little. One day, the shop is visited by an old man, whom Haru assumes to be a beggar. Ordered to take the beggar out of Haru's shop, Anand gently guides the old man out and, feeling sympathetic, gives the old man his lunch of stale pooris and weak tea. Later that night, Anand finds the old man at his door. The man, who introduces himself as Abhaydatta, tells his story of a group of Healers, known as the brotherhood, who wield magic in a place called the Silver Valley, hidden deep within the Himalayas. He also reveals that a powerful magical item, the Conch, has been stolen from the brotherhood by one of its members, Surabhanu. This resulted in the weakening of the Brotherhood; therefore, they have sent four pairs of Healers to search for the conch. Abhaydatta and his partner have, in fact, retrieved the conch; however, his partner died buying Abhaydatta time to escape from Surabhanu. Abhaydatta asks Anand for help in his journey back to the Silver Valley. He reveals that it is Anand's belief in magic that drew Abhaydatta and the Conch to Kolkata. Sensing Anand's hesitation, Abhaydatta heals Meera. However, Anand's mother arrives and, finding no visible effect on Meera, orders Abhaydatta out of the house, despite Anand's protests. Abhaydatta leaves, informing them where he will be and what time he will leave, with or without Anand. The next morning, Anand is awakened by Meera's voice; she was cured during the night and is able to speak normally again. His mother gives her consent and lets Anand go. Unfortunately, for Anand, Abhaydatta has already left. Anand meets Nisha, a girl sweeping in front of a soft drinks stall, who tells him she knows where Abhaydatta will be waiting. After Anand reluctantly agrees to let her come, she leads him to the train station. There, they run into Surabhanu, disguised as a wealthy passenger. He manages to hold the struggling children until a mysterious candy vendor helps them escape. Outside the station, they meet a blind beggar woman who, after receiving alms from Anand, points the two children in the direction of the meeting point where Anand and Nisha finally find Abhaydatta. The Healer is initially disapproving of Nisha but eventually relents. The three start their journey towards the Silver Valley. Along the way, Abhaydatta tells the children of the journey ahead and what to do if they get separated from him. He tells of the dangers they will face and the three trials they will have to pass before reaching the Silver Valley. Abhaydatta also secretly entrusts the Conch to Anand; Surabhanu would not expect the Healer to trust the Conch to a boy. Surabhanu, however, catches up to the three. In the duel that ensues, Anand and Nisha escaped but Abhaydatta mysteriously vanishes. As they journey, Anand begins hearing the conch talk to him and respond to his thoughts. It reveals to Anand that it will allow itself to be used only after all human solutions have been exhausted. A mongoose also joins the two children, saving them from trouble a few times along the way and earning Nisha's appreciation. They finally reach the first trial of the Brotherhood: a raging river none of them can cross. The mongoose, however, steps into the river, which stills as the animal and the two children make their way across. Upon reaching the second trial, an enchanted rocky pass, Anand is forced to decide between going on alone or staying with Nisha. A bit of ingenious thinking allows both of them to cross the pass; however, Nisha is injured badly. Unfortunately, Surabhanu catches up to the two children in the form of a red snake. He reveals that Nisha has been under his control since their encounter at the train station. Surabhanu orders her to smash Anand's head with a rock, but the mongoose, which had been Abhaydatta all along, fights Surabhanu. The mongoose is defeated, which pains Nisha and causes her to betray Surabhanu. The conch finally allows Anand to use it, defeating Surabhanu in a wave of fire. Anand arrives at the gate to the Silver Valley. There, in the final trial, he is made to choose between glory in the Silver Valley or his friends. Giving up the conch, he chooses to remain with an injured Nisha and the mongoose Abhaydatta. The Brotherhood declares that he has passed the final test, the trial within his mind, and welcomes Anand, Nisha, and Abhaydatta into the Silver Valley. With the Conch restored in the Valley, Abhaydatta is restored to his human form and, with some help from Anand and Nisha, his mind is also turned back from that of a mongoose into his old self. Nisha is inducted as a novice, the first female member of the Brotherhood, which makes Anand wonder why the Brotherhood did not invite him to join. Abhaydatta talks to Anand and reveals that, unlike Anand, Nisha has no family. Thus, it was Anand who had to choose between the Brotherhood and his family, which had just found Anand's father, imprisoned for a crime he did not commit. Anand chooses to stay with the Brotherhood, so the Healers make his family forget he had ever been a part of their lives. Anand, however, is not allowed to forget them for, as a Healer, he should remember the pain and what he had given up for the Brotherhood. Anand is then inducted not just as a novice but also as the titular Conch Bearer. Characters * Anand - the main hero a boy living in contemporary India, and later, the Conch Bearer. * Nisha - a clever and resourceful girl who unexpectedly accompanies Anand and Abhaydatta on their quest. She lost her parents and doesn't remember her name,birthday,parents faces etc. Luckily Abhaydatta gives her the name \\"Nisha\\". She undergoes a minor personality change, from being tough to clingy to Abhaydatta whom she calls Dadaji (meaning grandfather). * Abhaydatta - a Master Healer of the Brotherhood, recovered the Conch and passed it to Anand. He specializes in memory spells; he can make a person forget what they know or remember what they have lost. He also changed his form into a mongoose when Surabhanu changed into a snake. Unlike Surabhanu, however, his magic was depleted and Abhaydatta was unable to change back into a human by himself. * Surabhanu - once a member of the Brotherhood, he stole the Conch for himself. He is capable of changing shape; Anand and Nisha met him in the form of a wealthy train passenger, a red snake and, finally, his own shape. He can also command animals like ravens or monkeys to spy or do work for him and is the main villain of the book. * The Conch- a mysterious object that can communicate with humans and has great power. Anand's task is to carry the conch back to the Brotherhood. The conch looks like a conch and usually gives off a glow but most people see it as something else. (ex. a bone, a shell) Writing After 9/11,the author began thinking about heroes and how different cultures try to find heroes, and she \\"wanted to write a book where there could be heroic characters\\". She stated that she wanted to share India and her culture with young readers, and that she feels it is important to spread cultural diversity because she is concerned about \\"a really dangerous tendency to close down the borders.\\" It also deals with the theory of Monomyth or The Hero's Journey. Awards The Conch Bearer was chosen as a Publishers Weekly Best Children's Book of the Year and a Booklist Editor's Choice. It also got the gold medal Blue Bonnet award. It is on many school district summer reading book lists including FBISD in Texas. Adaptation On August 2019, it was reported that Imtiaz Ali will be the showrunner of a series based on the novel. It will be jointly produced by Ali, Ashok Amritraj and Reliance Entertainment.

It depicts a band of survivors in a zombie wasteland. The film includes a sequence of human-zombie intercourse. Plot Dexy, a sexually insatiable woman, implores her husband Nathan to find her \\"someone to play with\\". Immediately afterward, a man armed with a one-handed sledgehammer and a number of long spikes is engaged in hand-to-hand combat with a zombie, which he ultimately kills by overpowering it and driving a spike into its head with his hammer. His name is revealed to be \\"Matool\\". He then sees another zombie approaching him, which appears to annoy him more than frighten him. He is also shown being extremely protective of his glasses, since zombies have overrun the world and he might find it difficult to acquire another pair. As the opening credits roll, short clips are shown of Matool running around the deserted streets of Albuquerque, New Mexico, while Nathan is driving his pickup on those same streets, showing that the city is devoid of human life. Afterward, a young woman is shown trapped in her car by a group of ravenous zombies outside, while her male companion is pulled down and devoured. Matool hears this and utters \\"Fuck yeah!\\" while rushing off to her rescue. Though she is obviously reluctant, she allows herself to be saved, but Matool is forced to resort to carrying her, as she is overcome by panic. They take refuge in a rundown, abandoned house, which is already occupied by a middle-aged man and two young boys. The older man, Mr. Rainville, seems not to be bothered much by what is happening outside, and neither does one of his young friends, but the other boy does not speak at all or show any kind of emotion. After some amusing introductions, Matool inquires as to the identity of the man who was just killed, and the young woman replies that it was her brother, much to Matool's joy, but she is incensed by his subtle advances, and still believes that they can save her now-dead brother. Rainville continues to do nothing but sit and watch as all this happens, though he does not hesitate to jump in with a witty comment about he's \\"not going to fuck you either\\" to Matool, mocking his attempts to get the young lady in bed. The woman then loses it and tries to leave to save her brother, but is pulled down and devoured by several zombies while Matool has no choice but to run. Rainville and one of the boys are eaten alive, but the quiet one simply hides, showing no emotion whatsoever. As Matool runs, Nathan hits him with the door of his truck. Matool later wakes up bound in the back of Nathan's truck as they arrive at Nathan's house in the mountains near the city. Also in the truck is the quiet boy who Rainville had taken in (though the purposes for which he did so are implied to be carnal in nature). After being taken inside, he is cut loose, welcomed, allowed to bathe, and is bluntly informed that Nathan and Dexy have an alternative lifestyle, which involves Nathan watching while other men engage in sexual activity with Dexy. Matool is intrigued by this and goes along with the idea, but their first time, Dexy's sister Sassy smacks his bare rear with a ruler, surprising Matool, who is even more surprised when he sees that this new woman has a mutated human face on her side, the result of some kind of conjoined twins situation (the face appears to be self-aware, and is named Dottie). Matool apologizes for freaking out, seeing that Sassy is very sensitive. After a few days, during which Matool gets used to his new surroundings, and after a few fights with zombies lurking outside, Nathan and Matool become fast friends, and Matool is shown a shed behind the house where Nathan keeps a naked female zombie that he likes to \\"look at\\", prompting Matool to remark \\"Yeah, she'd be pretty fucking hot if she weren't decomposing.\\" Shortly thereafter, a small group of soldiers arrive in the rain. Two are carrying a third, who is badly injured. Their leader is Mandel, the other is Vega, and the wounded man is Sepulveda, who talk their way inside. A flashback reveals that they were part of a larger unit surviving on the roads after the zombies overran civilization until a zombie attack (including what they call 'hyperzombies, which can move faster than normal zombies) cost them two soldiers (one, a male, was eaten alive and another, a female, was dragged screaming under their truck), and wounded Sepulveda. Mandel becomes acquainted with Matool who tells him that the house is well- supplied, has power from an electrical generator, a well, as well as \\"more\\". Sepulveda is placed in an unoccupied bedroom where Mandel and Vega take turns watching him, knowing that death and reanimation are inevitable. Also, Vega becomes acquainted with Sassy, who later admits to Mandel and Matool that the face on her side is \\"disturbingly sexy\\" (prompting Matool to call him \\"disturbingly weird\\"). Later, Mandel and Vega begin having sex with Dexy while Nathan watches, causing him obvious frustration, leading him to, while the others are having breakfast, sneak back to his shed and have rough sex with his chained female zombie. A flashback reveals that the female zombie was one of two survivors who had arrived sometime earlier (the other being a male), who, after seeing Dexy's attraction to them both, shot the man and strangled the woman, keeping her for sexual purposes. As the days pass, Vega and Sassy begin a relationship, while Sepulveda continues to die in agony, while Mandel resists Matool's suggestion that he be put down right away. Nathan and Matool continue to fight and destroy zombies (Nathan with a Beretta pistol, Matool with his trademark hammer and spikes) as they show up at the house. Things inevitably fall apart, however, as the quiet boy who has not yet said a word begins feeling an attraction towards Dexy, and takes Nathan's keys and frees his female zombie, leaving it contained in the shed. Meanwhile, Sepulveda wakes up and sees Sassy for the first time, as well as her conjoined twin, freaking out at how disgusting it is, causing Sassy to lose it and kill him with a pair of scissors. Mandel, who was watching Sepulveda, instinctively shoots Sassy, killing her. Nathan goes out to the shed for a tryst, but is killed and devoured by his zombie companion. Meanwhile, Matool, Mandel, and Vega take Sassy and Sepulveda's bodies out before they reanimate as zombies, while attempting to reassure Dexy that it was \\"an accident\\". Matool smashes Sassy's head with a cinder block over Vega's objections who is then attacked and killed by a reanimated Sepulveda. As more zombies begin to gather at the house, Matool demands that Mandel go back into the house to get his MP5 submachine gun, but he can't, as the boy has locked them out. Mandel then kills the Sepulveda zombie with his knife. Then they head to the shed to find Nathan. They open the door and see him being devoured by his female zombie and proceed to lock her back in. As more and more zombies arrive, Mandel punches Matool, claiming Dexy as his own, but Matool fights back. As they fight, they find themselves surrounded and are forced to run down the same road to escape. Dexy, meanwhile, looks out the window as the zombies approach the door while the boy comes up to her, still not speaking or expressing any emotion. She looks at him and says \\"Nathan will be back.\\" The boy then holds Dexy's hand. Matool and Mandel run down a gravel road together, making their escape.

It is named after Manfred Bial, a German physician. The components include orcinol, hydrochloric acid, and ferric chloride. A pentose, if present, will be dehydrated to form furfural which then reacts with the orcinol to generate a colored substance. The solution will turn bluish and a precipitate may form. The solution shows two absorption bands, one in the red between Fraunhofer lines B and C and the other near the D line.Baldwin, E. and Bell, D.J., Cole's Practical Physiological Chemistry, published by Heffer, Cambridge, 1955, page 189 An estimate of the relevant wavelengths can be made by referring to the Fraunhofer lines article. Composition 700px Bial's reagent consists of 0.4 g orcinol, 200 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 0.5 ml of a 10% solution of ferric chloride.Baldwin and Bell, page 189 Bial's test is used to distinguish pentoses from hexoses; this distinction is based on the color that develops in the presence of orcinol and iron (III) chloride. Furfural from pentoses gives a blue or green color. The related hydroxymethylfurfural from hexoses may give a muddy-brown, yellow or gray solution, but this is easily distinguishable from the green color of pentoses. Quantitative version The test may be performed as a quantitative colorimetric test using a spectrophotometer. Fernell and King have published a procedure for simultaneous determination of pentoses and hexoses from measurements at two wavelengths.W. R. Fernell and H. K. King, The simultaneous determination of pentose and hexose in mixtures of sugars. Analyst, 1953,78, 80‚Äì83 Various versions of this test are widely used for a quick chemical determination of RNA; in this context it is usually called the orcinol test.R.S. Hanson and J.A.

It was mainly used for coal, limestone and iron ore traffic for the local industries. History The Cleator & Workington Junction Railway was incorporated in 1876 and a Bill presented to Parliament in the same year. Construction began shortly after and the line between Workington and Cleator Moor was opened in 1879. The line continued northwards from Workington to a junction with the London & North Western Railway at Siddick, approximately two miles away. The principal station and company headquarters were in Central Square, Workington and the station soon became known as Workington Central. A second main line was built from a junction on the C&WJR; main line at Calva Junction to Linefoot Junction, where it joined the Maryport and Carlisle Railway. This section was known as the Northern Extension. Several branch lines were built including that to Rowrah of which a short 300 yard section remained in use at Rowrah as a backshunt until 1978. To the people of West Cumberland the line became affectionately known as the \\"Track of the Ironmasters.\\" The C&WJR; never ran its own services on the main lines: this was done on their behalf by the Furness Railway. In later years the C&WJR; purchased its own engines to work its branch lines (see below). At the railway grouping of 1923, the line was incorporated into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway network. The Northern Extension section that served the Broughton Moor Armaments Depot closed on 4 June 1992. Accidents and incidents *On 16 February 1900, an embankment was washed away at Moss Bay, Workington. A freight train on the Moss bay Branch was derailed with the locomotive coming to rest on its side. The 0-6-0ST locomotive was rescued shortly after the incident and was returned to traffic. Route =Main line= \\\\- - - - (Route in Google Maps) =Northern extension= \\\\- - (Route in Google Maps) =Rowrah line= The Rowrah Line was branch line that left the mainline south of , accessing the mines and quarries near Rowrah. This branch line crossed over the main line from Workington to Cleator Moor to continue to Rowrah. The Company built a single road engine shed near the junction to house a C&WJR; locomotive that worked the line. The much altered building exists today (2017) as an agricultural store.  Cleator & Workington Junction Railway locomotives  All the nameplates used on this company's locomotives were named after residences of C&WJR; company directors. Until recently there was uncertainty about the name of No. 2 but the personal notebook of the Company Accountant shows otherwise. The engine never ran in service with the name \\"Ennerdale\\" * Notes on the Locomotives The first two locomotives were outside cylinder 0-4-0 tank engines. They proved not to be powerful enough for the severe inclines so engines 3 to 10 were 0-6-0 inside cylinder saddle tanks from a wide range of builders. Some poorly researched historical sources often get this fact wrong and describe the larger saddle tank engines as outside cylinder engines. * No.1, Brigham Hall (1st) and Rothersyke (1st.)

ND is allocated 3 electors because it has 1 congressional district and 2 senators. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of 3 electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate and his or her running mate. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded all 3 electoral votes. Their chosen electors then vote for president and vice president. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a faithless elector. The electors of each state and the District of Columbia met on December 13, 2004, to cast their votes for president and vice president. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body. Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia met in their respective capitols. The following were the members of the Electoral College from the state.

It connects with the BNSF Railway in Mitchell and Napa Junction respectively. History The Mitchell‚ÄìKadoka line is part of a former Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (CMStP&P;) secondary built between Marquette, Iowa and Rapid City, South Dakota during the period of 1880 and 1907. The line lost profitability and was embargoed in 1980 and subsequently bought by the South Dakota Department of Transportation, which still owns the tracks. The purchase was orchestrated by Governor Bill Janklow. Dakota Southern also operated a line from Napa Junction to Platte, South Dakota, which was also constructed and owned by the Chicago, Milwakuee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad. The operation lasted from 1985 to 1989 before Dakota Southern stopped operating the line. Dakota Southern has since reinstated operations on this line as far as Tabor, almost 30 years after the last train left the line. The railway originally hauled large amounts of grain, but this business became unprofitable in the late 1990s. Between 2000 and 2007, the railway had just one customer‚Äîa box factory in Mitchell, and thus no trains passed that point. In 2005, however, the railway obtained a haulage agreement with BNSF to allow it to operate to Sioux City, where it could interchange with the Union Pacific Railroad and the Canadian National Railway, making grain service profitable again. After track repairs, service briefly resumed as far as Presho, South Dakota in fall 2007. While the line still officially operates all the way to Kadoka, as the Kadoka-Rapid City portion was rail-banked in 1996, a grade crossing in Vivian is currently paved over, as well as one in Belvidere. New ownership and revitalization of the line On October 1, 2009, new owners Mike Williams and Stan Patterson took over the day-to-day operations of the railroad. They both own other rail lines in the country. Mike Williams owns the Bountiful Grain and Craig Mountain Railroad, Ozark Valley Railroad and the Iowa River Railroad. Stan Patterson operates the Washington and Idaho Railway. Initially they planned to rehabilitate the line as far as Murdo, 140 miles west of Mitchell, over three years. The first year was to be from Mitchell to White Lake, the second year to Chamberlain and in the third year rehabilitation would be carried out to Murdo. In spring 2011 a 16-million- dollar federal Tiger grant was secured to help finance the 28-million-dollar rebuild of 61.6 miles of the line between Mitchell and Chamberlain. Work began in late May 2011. According to former railroad owner Alex Huff, the 65-pound rail was to be replaced with 136, 132 and 115-pound rail. As a result of the rebuilding, two competing companies proposed building 110-car shuttle loading facilities near Kimball, South Dakota. In mid-September 2012 the first regularly scheduled service west of Mitchell since the late 1990s began with twice weekly unit trains of inbound fertilizer and outbound grain to the newly built Liberty Grain elevator east of Kimball. In fall 2014 Dakota Southern received a Federal Tiger grant to help fund rebuilding an additional 42 miles of the line from Chamberlain to one mile west of Presho. South Dakota Wheat Growers started construction on an agronomy services and shuttle loader facility in the fall of 2014 in Kennebec. The reconstructed line opened and the first 115-car shuttle train arrived and was loaded in Kennebec in October 2016. Before being rehabilitated the line carried 687 cars in 2010, 3,049 cars in 2013 after rehabilitation between Mitchell and Chamberlain and 9,580 in 2017 after rehabilitation to Presho. In 2018, Dakota Southern had expressed reinterest in rehabilitating the line to Murdo, and possibly beyond all the way to Kadoka. Platte Line operator In September 2015, 27 years after Dakota Southern stopped operating the line, Dakota Southern was chosen by the State Railway Board to again operate the long out-of-service Napa Junction ‚Äì Platte line in southern South Dakota. In November 2016, the South Dakota Railway Board agreed with terms on a 10-year contract with Dakota Southern to lease and restore service between Napa Junction and Ravinia. Plans were made to replace 2,000 ties so that the railroad could operate the first 10 miles of track, as far as Tabor, within 30 days. In addition a 40-million-dollar Dakota Plains Ag Center grain facility opened in 2017 at Napa Junction. In June 2020 the South Dakota Railway Board agreed to ask the federal Surface Transportation Board to railbank 33 miles of the Platte Line between Tyndall and Ravinia. The remainder of the line beyond Ravinia to Platte had already been railbanked. If approved the ties and rails would be removed and salvaged and Dakota Southern Railway's lease amended amended to end at Tyndall. The South Dakota DOT had previously authorized sale of the Platte Line to investors in a proposed ethanol plant in Wagner in 2006, but the sale fell through and the authorization was withdrawn in 2011.

Controversy  In December 2017, Dakota Southern Railway was found to have stored rail cars full of liquid natural gas, more commonly known as butane, on a siding at the South Dakota Wheat Growers facility in Kennebec. A federal inspection found that they had been sitting there far too long, and cited 11 counts of hazardous material violations. Further investigation found that Mike Willams, one of the co-owners of Dakota Southern, had signed a contract giving away 1.4 miles of siding to Bruce Terminaling LLC, a company that Mike Willams also owns. This contract was not presented to the South Dakota State Rail Board, and due to this, a discussion about terminating the lease of Dakota Southern on the Rapid City‚ÄìMitchell (MRC) line came about, but Dakota Southern still currently holds the lease.

He returned in 1960 to find he was still impressed by the \\"neat people\\" Aspen had living there. After a trip to Europe and fleeting thoughts about Big Sur, his family decided to move to Colorado. In the fall of 1961 the Bentons came back to Aspen, stayed just one day, bought a lot and then returned to Southern California to liquidate their assets in order to pay for the Aspen property. In 1963, Benton was in Aspen to begin building what would become his home, studio, and gallery and the family followed the next year. It is still located at 519 East Hyman Avenue in downtown Aspen. Benton did nearly all the work on the building himself and with friends. Art and Politics Benton mostly gave up architecture in 1964 to devote time to his art, though he did design a select few buildings later. He became very involved in local and national politics, creating his first anti-war \\"peace\\" poster in 1965 and becoming a charter member of the Aspen Liberation Front, a loose-knit group of peace activists. He used quotes to make sure no one missed the message in his work and occasionally added a straight line to his pieces as representing the \\"hand of man\\". His artistic influences include the great Japanese artist Hokusai, Paul Jenkins, Mark Rothko, and Morris Lewis. Still, as fellow artist and friend Michael Cleverly puts it, \\"When he did a 'Benton', it looked like a 'Benton'.\\" Benton's close friends included many of the politicians in the Roaring Fork Valley and in 1970 he gained national recognition as the artist who created the posters for Hunter S Thompson's infamous campaign for Pitkin County Sheriff, including the 1970 ‚ÄúHunter S. Thompson for Sheriff‚Äù poster depicting a sheriff's star covered by a two-thumbed fist holding a button of peyote. In the years after that defeat, Benton also designed posters George McGovern and Gary Hart early 1970s. The \\"struggling artist\\" lifestyle took its toil and Benton was divorced from Betty in 1977. He remarried twice more. First to Katie Smith and then to Marci Griffin in 1991. He had to sell the studio home on Hyman and eventually worked out a makeshift studio on the Woody Creek ranch of friend George Stranahan. Later Years Benton continued to keep his hand in politics and issues that mattered to him throughout his career, designing the poster that current Sheriff Bob Braudis used in his last campaign in 2006. Starting in 1989 and continuing off and on until 2003 he worked as a jailer for the Pitkin County Sheriff Department. He was still on the roster at the time of his death. Tom spent much of his \\"art\\" time creating monoprints and paintings that were an extension of his earlier work with perhaps a bit more left to the imagination of the viewer. A self-described pessimist in his early career, his more recent works show a shift towards lighter issues in his colors and perhaps even a bit more optimism. Benton was diagnosed with advanced lymphoma in early 2007 and died on Friday, April 27, 2007. He was 76. A book about Benton's work, by Aspen writer Daniel J. Watkins, was published in 2011.Stewart Oksenhorn, \\"Aspen author's book features Tom Benton's work\\", The Aspen Times, April 30, 2007.Katherine Warren, \\"The art behind Hunter S.

Jeddah was the last major stand of the Hashemites against the Saudis. Information Following the fall of Mecca to King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud in early December 1924, King Ali bin Hussein moved back to Jeddah, trying to defend it against the Nejd Army. Ali's remaining army started to build fortifications around the city and place mines. Ali requested help and supply from his brothers' states, King Abdullah of Transjordan and King Faisal of Iraq. They both supplied Ali with arms and men. Also, Ali's two old airplanes were not enough for the incoming battle so he bought five aircraft from Italy and several tanks from Germany. Regardless, Ali could not stand for long. The nearby clans were Ibn Saud's allies. The supplies from Aqaba traveled slowly to Jeddah, besides he had only two pilots, one of whom died during the battle. Eventually, the chiefs of Jeddah decided to surrender the city to Ibn Saud, while King Ali escaped to Baghdad over the Red Sea. The siege ended on 23 December 1925 (1343 A.H.). Consequently, Ibn Saud was declared the new King of Hejaz. The following year, Ibn Saud merged the Hejaz with the Nejd as one state.

The 4,000 acre area was sold by the municipality of West Vancouver to the British Pacific Properties corporation in 1931, which continues to develop the land to the present day. The development is credited with starting West Vancouver's slow transformation from a ferry-access only, resort-style beachside enclave into a leafy suburban community with roads, parks, and shopping centres.  History  In 1931, the British Pacific Properties, a corporation consisting of a group of investors led by the Guinness brewing company, acquired 4,000 acres of land from the municipality of West Vancouver stretching from the Capilano River to Horseshoe Bay. The land was purchased during the Great Depression, when the municipality was nearing bankruptcy due to residents being unable to pay property taxes. The Guinness family, led by Walter Guinness committed to funding $1 million in local improvements over a five-year period and constructing the Lions Gate Bridge. The corporation ended up paying $75,000 to the municipality for the land with the agreement of $1 million in improvements. A cabin at 15th St. and Ottawa Ave. in 1942.

Olmsted Brothers was founded by Frederick Law Olmsted‚Äîthe father of North American landscape architecture and the creator of Central Park in Manhattan, Mount Royal in Montreal, and the innovative Riverside suburb in West Chicago. Ethnic restrictions The neighbourhood was known for its strict whites-only policy. Property titles including covenants such as barring sales to \\"any person or persons of African or Asiatic race or of African or Asiatic descent.\\" Jewish people were also excluded, although, eventually, the first synagogue in West Vancouver was built opposite the entrance to the British Properties. In modern times, the resident population is diverse due to the property values and other factors attracting Asian and other international investors. It is said that residents are just as likely to speak Persian or Mandarin as they are to speak English.

The United States maintained diplomatic relations with the government-in-exile of Greece in London (1941‚Äì43) and then in Cairo (1943‚Äì44). Ambassador MacVeagh reopened the embassy on October 27, 1944. The U.S. Legation was raised to Embassy status on September 29, 1942. This action also would promote Minister Biddle to the rank of Ambassador, which required a new appointment. The appointment was promptly made by President Roosevelt and confirmed by the Senate. Ambassador Biddle presented his credentials to the government of Greece on October 30, 1942.

Among the Pseudo- Demosthenic works are six of those written for Apollodorus of Acharnae, (46, 49, 50, 52, 53, and 59), all of which seem to have been written by the same author. The author of these speeches has been identified as Apollodorus himself. Demosthenes' speech 45 also concerns Apollodorus, but seems to be genuine. Additionally, speech 47, though it does not concern Apollodorus, was probably written by the same author as these six, which Friedrich Blass considered to be evidence that the speeches were not in fact written by Apollodorus, but an otherwise unknown minor logographer. However, Kapparis considers that speech 46 can only have been composed by Apollodorus, as there is no reason that he would have hired two different logographers, one to compose his first speech and a second to draft his reply to the defence. Kapparis concludes that either speech 46 must be written by Demosthenes or Apollodorus, and as it is stylistically drastically different from Demosthenes' speeches and similar to the other speeches given by Apollodorus, Apollodorus himself must have been the author of these speeches. Additionally, at least two of the Apollodoran speeches, 52 and 53, cannot have been authored by Demosthenes, because he would not have been old enough when they were written.

Life Peter Fendi was born in Vienna on 4 September 1796 to Joseph and Elizabeth Fendi. His father was a schoolmaster. He fell from a changing table as an infant, an accident which caused irreparable damage to his spine. Fendi demonstrated a talent for drawing from childhood. He was admitted to the St. Anna's Academy of Fine Art in 1810 at the age of thirteen, where he studied for three years under , Hubert Maurer and Johann Baptist von Lampi the Elder. Fendi met Joseph Barth, an art collector and the personal ophthalmologist of Joseph II, and through Barth's connections to other influential artists, in 1818 Fendi found a job at the Imperial Gallery of Coins and Antiquities,Waissenberger 1986, p. 164.The Imperial Gallery of Coins and Antiquities was originally part of the Imperial Art Collection, which was later transferred the Kunsthistorisches Museum where he worked as a draughtsman and engraver. Fendi received a gold medal in 1821 for his oil painting Vilenica, and was elected a member of the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna in 1836. Both nobles and commoners occasionally employed Fendi to give instruction in drawing and painting, and later in life teaching took up more of his time; his pupils included Carl Schindler and .Norman 1987, p. 84. He died on 28 August 1842. Works Fendi painted in oil and watercolours, as well as working with printing, etching, lithography and wood carving. Multicolored prints by Fendi are considered pioneering achievements in the field of lithography. Fendi is remembered for his genre scenes, influenced by Dutch painters such as Adriaen Brouwer, Adriaen van Ostade and Rembrandt. Other influences on Fendi's artistic development included the works of Italians such as Giovanni Bellini, Tintoretto, Titian, and Paolo Veronese, which he saw on a trip to Venice in 1821.Waissenberger 1986, p. 166. He is also well known for his portraits of the aristocracy. Fendi engraved a series five of Austrian banknotes that were issued in 1841. His works are preserved in the Albertina Museum, the Austrian Gallery in the Belvedere, Kunsthistorisches Museum, and in the collections of the Prince of Liechtenstein in Vaduz.

The face and throat pouch are dark brown, ornamented with yellow-orange tubercles. The bill is horn-colored or brown; the eyes are hazel. The legs and feet vary from dark brown to dark-blotched bright pink. Breeding adults have a little black erectile crest on the forehead, yellow or orange caruncles (large warts) above the base of the bill, and a bright blue ring around the eye. After the breeding season, the plumage fades, the eye-ring becomes lead-blue, and the caruncles become smaller and duller-colored. Juveniles are dark brown with varying amounts of white underneath and brown iris, bill, and feet. They have no caruncles, and their eye-rings are lead-blue. They acquire adult plumage gradually. Unlike many cormorants, this species does not spread its wings when it is perched. Feeding Kerguelen shags presumably eat mostly fish and such invertebrates as echinoderms, crustaceans, and polychaete worms. In summer they mostly forage alone, but from May to October they form linear flocks of several hundred, diving and surfacing sequentially down the line. Reproduction This species breeds in colonies, usually of 3 to 30 pairs but occasionally up to 400. Colonies may be near those of southern rockhopper penguins. There is a period of nest-building and displaying in late March and early April‚Äîan unusual time for a subantarctic cormorant. Advertising males display by throwing the head back till the nape touches the tail. Nests are cones of seaweed, twigs, and grass held together with mud and guano, up to 1 meter tall and 33 cm across, with a cup averaging 20 cm across and 8 cm deep. Nests that survive may be reused, perhaps not by the same pair. Breeding activity starts as early as September, but laying usually starts at some point from late October to late November and lasts till mid January; the times vary considerably among colonies. The clutch comprises two to four eggs, about 6.2 cm long and 3.9 cm wide. The second egg is laid 2 or 3 days after the first. Both parents incubate for an average of 29 days. Both protect the chicks from predation by skuas, gulls, and sheathbills, which nevertheless take some chicks. Chicks hatch black with a pink throat and develop blackish-brown down with greyish-white tufts. Other aspects of reproductive behavior and success are unknown. The population was about 6,000 to 7,000 pairs in 1984‚Äì1987. Interactions with human beings and introduced mammals do not appear to be damaging the population. Classification This species has been placed in genera Halieus, Hypoleucos, Notocarbo, and Leucocarbo. Others place it in the genus Phalacrocorax. It has been considered conspecific with some other blue- eyed shags under the name imperial shag. Here it is considered a separate species following the Handbook of the Birds of the World and other authorities, according to It has been suggested that Heard shags may visit the Kerguelens and that Kerguelen shags with white wing or back patches are the result of hybridization. Etymology The epithet verrucosus means \\"full of warts\\", referring to the facial ornaments.

The Point Paterson Project was to utilise a salt flat owned by a salt company but which has not been in use for solar salt production for decades. The plant would have integrated renewable energy and desalination technologies to create environmentally-friendly electricity and water. In particular, the project would have significantly reduced the usual greenhouse impacts associated with grid electricity demand for desalination.Solar-powered desalination plant leads the way The project had attracted the interest of internationally renowned climatologist, the late Professor Stephen Schneider, who joined the Board of Acquasol in 2006. If the plant had been built, it was expected to produce 5.5 gigalitres of water per year, enough to supply the needs of 34,000 people. Port Augusta (13,257 people) would receive 2 gigalitres per year free of cost during the first two years of the plant's operation. The plant would have been configured to expand if need be, with a potential output of 45 gigalitres per year. The project never received enough funding, and the company was declared insolvent in 2014. Salt harvesting As the plant was to be built on the site of a salt pan, brine wastewater from the desalination process would be diverted onto the pan rather than pumped back into the gulf. Once the brine evaporates, the remaining salt was to be harvested and sold. The profits from the salt harvesting will be used to offset the cost of the desalination process while simultaneously preventing wastewater from being pumped back into the Spencer Gulf.

Early life and career Born at Versailles from a family steeped in the traditions of the palace, de La Porte (or de Laporte) was destined early to follow in the family footsteps. His great-granduncle was Michel Richard Delalande, court composer to Louis XIV, his grandfather was First Commissary of the Marine Joseph Pellerin, his father Arnaud I de La Porte was First Commissary as well, and his uncle, Joseph Pellerin Jr. was Intendant of the Naval Armies, all under Louis XV and Louis XVI.¬πArnaud II de La Porte He began working in his father's bureau in 1755 at only eighteen years of age. The next year he joined his uncle at the Marine (as the Navy was known in France). He would continue in these branches of the government occupying at various times Intendancies of Brest and Bordeaux, arriving at the Intendancy of Foreign and Maritime Trade in 1783. The Revolution Named Minister of the Navy during the Baron de Breteuil's ephemeral ministry on 12 July 1789, after the fall of the Bastille two days later he immediately emigrated to Spain. However Louis XVI needed faithful servants more than ever, and when the King called, La Porte was one of the few who dared answer. He was named Intendant of the Civil List (Minister of the Royal Household) in December 1790 which gave him direct control of the large sums of money that were considered the private wealth of the King and so not subject to public audit. He soon became a close confidant of the beleaguered king and Louis XVI entrusted him with great sums of this private money to be distributed toward the moderation of the rapidly radicalising revolutionary fervour. More than 1500 persons; actors, singers, public speakers, etc. were employed to this end, at an expense which exceeded 200,000 livres monthly. In 1791 La Porte founded the \\"National\\" Club in the Carrousel. Despite his close collaboration with Mirabeau, and especially due to the latter's premature death, La Porte's efforts proved to be in vain. Seeing how dangerous things were becoming, La Porte, who conferred on a daily basis with the King in his apartments in the Pavillon de l'Infante of the Louvre (which were attached by a long wing to the Tuileries Palace at that time), proposed a plan to his sovereign in an attempt to save his life. He had previously discovered a secret room in his suite, and knowing that the guards would not take notice of his passage since he made the same walk every day, counselled the King to hide in the secret room after their daily conference until such a time as he could be safely spirited out of the whole palace complex. At that time Louis refused, still certain of the love of his people. The Queen's friend, Fersen would be more successful in convincing him of his need to escape a few months later. When the royal family attempted the flight to Varennes, Laporte was left behind, entrusted by the King to read his letter explaining his motives to the Constituent Assembly, something that must have been a thankless, not to say extremely dangerous task. Caught near the border, the royal family was unceremoniously returned to Paris to face the music. The King's position deteriorated steadily after that. After the storming of the Tuileries on 10 August, La Porte was arrested for having distributed secret funds, and convicted of treason against the Revolution becoming, on 23 August 1792, the second political victim of that new humane device: the guillotine. In a macabre gesture, his severed head was then presented to the King, by then imprisoned in the Temple, as a grisly birthday gift. His services and ultimate sacrifice were recalled after the Restoration by the King's younger brother who had been crowned as Louis XVIII, and his son Arnaud III de La Porte was created a baron in recognition of all this in 1822. The title remains in the family to this day. (based on the Dictionnaire Biographique Universel, article by Louis-Mayeul Chaudon and Antoine-Fran√ßois Delandine, translated with background interpolations and additions by R.Sekulovich) Biographical essay (translated from the \\"Dictionnaire historique ou Histoire abr√©g√©e des hommes qui se sont fait un nom par la g√©nie, les talens, les vertus, les erreurs, depuis le commencement du monde jusqu‚Äô√† nos jours. --Fran√ßois Xavier de Feller, 12 vol in-8¬∫, Paris, 1818.\\"): Laporte (Arnaud de), born in 1737 of a family which over the last century had provided several intendants and chief administrators to the Navy and the Colonial Office, he was destined to follow the same career. The Jesuits, with whom he did his studies at the Coll√®ge Louis Le Grand, had hoped to acquire him for their company; but the young Laporte did not heed their hints, though he was always to retain feelings of attachment and veneration for his former masters. At an early age (he was barely 23 years old), he was given the task of directing construction in the ports of Calais and Boulogne, of flat-bottomed boats, of a kind which, since they were ultimately to prove useless, have become the objects of ridicule by the English but which had for quite some time been the subject of their livliest anxiety. In the fulfilment of his duties, Laporte exercised those talents and that energy which were ever to focus public attention upon him. Having been rapidly promoted through the intermediary ranks, he was soon appointed Controller of the Navy at Brest. This posting's modest title belies its vast responsibilities; it was in fact a senior posting. He soon made for himself a personal reputation which public opinion, ratified by the full confidence of his superiors, led to his gradual assumption of all the functions of the Intendancy, of which he would one day actually hold the title as well. When his father died in 1770, Laporte went up to Paris to succeed him at the Exchequer, thus becoming the magistrate of a Sovereign Court and as such could no longer remain the mere controller of the port of Brest. In order for the Navy to be able to retain his services he was appointed Ordinator of Bordeaux, a post which gave him direct access to the Minister of the Navy which was a r√¥le much more in keeping with his newly elevated rank. It was at this time that he began to lay the foundations of that double reputation of a virtuous man as well as an able administrator which was to particularly characterise him. It is from this time as well that one can date that universal concert of approbation both from the Navy and the Merchant Marine as well as from shipping magnates in every port who all championed him for the office of Minister of the Navy each time that post became vacant. M. de Sartine was appointed Minister in 1775, and no sooner was he in office than he hastened to nominate Laporte to the king for the Intendancy of Brest, at that time vacant. Soon after, in 1776, an order came down changing the structure of the administration of the ports, by which several aspects were now to fall under the purview of the military. Although the new Intendant disapproved of some of these changes, having foreseen and reported several inconveniences likely to come of them, he nevertheless set himself to implement them inonfidence he inspired in general, that Laporte was in great part responsible for the rapid expansion of the French Navy during the period of the War of American Independence, this in spite of the innumerable difficulties that the execution of the new order entailed. The port of Brest during the course of this war was, as the principal French naval base, the nerve centre of almost all operations. Arnaud de Laporte who was its very soul soon gathered the fruits of his labours in expressions of esteem from the multitudes of travellers who passed through, expressions to which the king's brother the Count of Artois deigned to join his own. This prince would henceforward honour Laporte with his most particular grace. M. de Castries, having become Naval Minister in 1780 immediately called Laporte to his side and gave him, under the title of Intendant General of the Navy, the direction of all matters remaining under Administrative Corps. In 1783 he was called to the Royal Council of State as Master of Requests and at the same time appointed Intendant of Maritime Commerce, Intendant of the Navy, and a member of the Naval Council which the Minister had formed around his person. Then the Revolution began, and in July 1789 the king appointed a new ministry, calling on Arnaud de Laporte to take on the portfolio of the Navy at last. He was at that moment in Paris which was in full insurrection. The courrier on his way from Versailles carrying his nomination as Minister of the Navy was arrested at the barriers set up around the city and taken to the City Hall where the electors had constituted themselves. Luckily there were among them some well- intentioned men who saw to it that the courrier and his despatches was allowed to continue without the contents of his attach√© being examined, and it is thanks to them that Laporte was not subjected to the fury of the enraged populace then and there. Louis XVI, who had been unable to approach him in person at the time, finally got the chance eighteen months later in December 1790 when, come to name his new Intendant of the Civil List decided upon Laporte for the job. The latter was however no longer in France, having emigrated to Vitoria, near Bilbao in Spain which is where he received the king's letter, and though he had no doubts as to the danger to which he would expose himself, without a moment's hesitation he hastened to the service of a master who had found him worthy, and who lost no time in coming to appreciate the value of his servant. Over the next year and a half, Laporte had few occasions to give public proof of his devotion to his king. Circumstances required him to appear to be buried in purely financial matters obeying the king's wishes, whose confidence and affection in any event gave his heart all the reward he could hope for. Louis XVI soon gave him proof of his feelings when a pamphlet was published at the beginning of 1791 which accused his Intendant of weakness and even incompetence. The king, under no illusion as to the real aim of this slander which was getting a great deal of publicity at the time, was the first to go and speak to Laporte of it. His Intendant immediately offered his resignation if the king did not feel his services had been adequate, to which the Louis responded \\" Would you too, wish to leave me then?\\" Laporte, deeply moved, threw himself at his master's knees, and at that moment his fate was irrevocably sealed. Whether because the king was satisfied with Laporte's account of his work, or because the ever-mounting danger of being in the king's service kept even the most ambitious from seeking such a post, in any event Laporte was able to hold onto the king's confidence. It was this close collaboration with Louis XVI that led a great many people to come into contact with him, some no doubt in hope of acquiring an entr√©e with the king in the event that royal authority might eventually be restored, others with perhaps purer motives. All took him for their mediator with the king to whom, via Laporte they communicated their expressions of affection and zeal to serve him. After the tenth of August Laporte's first care was to destroy all evidence of this correspondence. That his retiring behaviour was not a sign of timidity in Laporte is shown by the fact that every time it was his duty to appear in public he did so with great courage. One reads in the accounts of the day that when he was called upon to appear before the National Assembly to present the declaration the king had prepared before the royal family's flight to Varennes, he refused to disclose the letter his unfortunate master had written him which he regarded as a sacred trust which he would not violate. He was equally firm when called upon to explain what had become of the \\"Memoires\\" of Madame de La Motte of which the entire edition had been bought up by the king so it could be suppressed. It had been decided that the books would be burnt in their entirety in the furnaces of the S√®vres porcelain factory. Laporte, assigned to oversee this operation (which he had considered a mistake in the first place), nevertheless undertook the task out of duty and discipline, feeling that such a delicate matter had to be seen to properly. It is known that Louis XVI, departing from Paris in 1791 was headed for Montm√©dy where he would centre his provisional government. A new ministry was envisioned. The Baron de Breteuil was to be Prime Minister and Laporte was to join it as Minister of the Navy. This second appointment was to have no more result than the first, and was even less known since every effort was made after the failure of the king's flight to play down all details regarding the oppositional government's plans. On the tenth of August, Laporte, fearing that his absence might compromise the king took it to be his duty to remain at his post. He went home that evening and there received a deputation of two jacobin envoys upon which he was obliged to present himself before the National Assembly to deposit the registers of the Civil List for their review. He replied calmly to the interrogation he was then subjected to, and surprisingly his point of view carried the day. Four more days passed without any attacks upon his person, however during that time he had to suffer the search of his papers by Commissioners of the National Assembly. To their disappointment no incriminating materials were discovered among them. Despite their best efforts not to omit anything that might produce their desired results, even to the point of removing chimney stones and pulling up the floorboards of his apartment, not a single piece of evidence was found that might have incriminated anyone at all. The care taken by this good man, who in so much personal danger himself, still took the pains not to compromise all those who had been in correspondence with him shows one of the character traits of Arnaud de Laporte which has sadly largely been ignored by posterity. Too many with too much to lose had good reason to keep him in oblivion, and so it wasn't until many years later that a few of those who were saved by his actions on that day were able to come forward in their memoires to express their belated gratitude and pay homage to his memory. The confidence that he enjoyed and which he so clearly showed to be well merited as in this instance, had made his network of contacts very numerous, and even thre times he regretted having had to meet with them. But all that he did remained largely unknown, an inevitable consequence of the circumstances in the midst of which he was acting, which as a man of experience he knew to be of the highest delicacy. Nevertheless, he continued to perform these thankless tasks with all the constancy of a man of real character who had no need of the approbation of others in the fulfilment of his duty. Some others held in the king's heart and would have been frustrated to appear to be held away from that close coterie that had surrounded Louis XVI which both friends and enemies of the king were vainly striving to force their way into. But Arnaud de Laporte, faithful to that wise spirit of discretion which he had made his creed, affected to remain always at a remove from the buzzing throng that whirled around the king's person. Everyone knew what he was about, and understood his firm principles, and that understanding led them to feel deep gratitude towards him. He had no personal enemies, and as such he probably would not have been singled out to become one of the Revolution's first victims had not the cold calculations of the leaders of the movement required them to find someone of \\"great guilt\\" to sacrifice in order to stoke the fires of public fury. It is quite clear that Laporte would not have been chosen to open up the abominable series of judicial murders which was to be the prelude to the more wholesale slaughter of 25 September, except that the persons upon whom the revolutionaries‚Äô eyes had first fallen had for the most part already made their escape from the capital or were being reserved for an even crueller fate. It was on 15 August 1792, at the very time the Royal Family was being transported to prison at the Temple, that this faithful servant of the crown was taken to the City Hall to be interrogarted by Billaud-Varennes, and from there transported to the Abbey of St. Germain des Pr√®s, then in use as a revolutionary prison. On the 23rd he appeared before the Revolutionary Tribunal. His calm countenance and the precision and accuracy of his responses to questioning stymied his judges best efforts to justify the guilty verdict they were required to make. \\"Why can‚Äôt you judge him?\\" cried the angry mob which had gathered to wallow in the spectacle of this just man's calvary. For‚Äö in the eyes of this ignorant multitude, especially with tempers at fever-pitch, no judgement, no justice was possible except the death sentence. Still the interrogation dragged on and on, for the rest of the day of the 23rd, through the whole night and for the morning after. And yet, surprisingly, after all that, such a great impression had he made upon his judges by his evident virtue, that they found themselves divided, and could not get the required majority vote for a condemnation, as was later reported by M. Julienne, the lawyer who had the courage to take on the dangerous job of defending Laporte. Nevertheless, they were bound by the powers over them and circumstances to condemn him and this they ultimately managed to bring themselves to do. When Arnaud de Laporte heard his sentence, he had a momentary shudder of emotion, which he made no attempt to conceal without however showing any weakness. His faith, this religion which he'd always respected, so full of hope and consolation in adversity gave him the courage to remain calm without affectation, which made a deep impression upon all who witnessed it, including the judges who had just condemned him. The imprint of his peaceful religious feelings has remained in a letter he wrote just after his sentencing which has been kept by his descendants. It is a very model of simple Christianity which resonates with submission to divine will and tenderness for his loved ones. The great impression he made at that moment, at first known only to those sharing the Tribunal with him, soon spread far and wide, this hommage to his dignity under duress, this respect due his courage at this terrible moment was reported unanimously by all the Parisian newspapers on the next day. One history of the Revolution which appeared in 1797, called \\"Two Friends of Liberty\\" closes its account of his death as follows: \\"Calm, as was his conscience, he climbed the steps of the guillotine to meet his death with all the assurance of a man who had never used his life but to bring happiness to all who surrounded him\\". No-one, in fact, ever took the practice of private virtues farther than Arnaud de Laporte which was the best guarantee possible one could have for his public probity in office. Also, the esteem in which he was held by those who came to know him and even those who knew him only slightly was always accompanied by a genuine sentiment of affection. His affability and good nature had won him all hearts back in Brest. During a long and grave illness in 1780 while posted there, the sailors of the port would gather daily at the door of the Intendancy eager for any scrap of news as to how he was faring, and thirty years after his death, when an oldtimer from Brest was asked if he had known Arnaud de Laporte the codger could not bring himself to answer, so overcome was he with tears of emotion. Arnaud de Laporte left only one son, a squadron chief in the artillery of the Royal Guard.

It is an important part of Dirac's development of Hamiltonian mechanics to elegantly handle more general Lagrangians; specifically, when constraints are at hand, so that the number of apparent variables exceeds that of dynamical ones.; Dover, . More abstractly, the two-form implied from the Dirac bracket is the restriction of the symplectic form to the constraint surface in phase space.See pages 48-58 of Ch. 2 in Henneaux, Marc and Teitelboim, Claudio, Quantization of Gauge Systems. Princeton University Press, 1992. This article assumes familiarity with the standard Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms, and their connection to canonical quantization. Details of Dirac's modified Hamiltonian formalism are also summarized to put the Dirac bracket in context.  Inadequacy of the standard Hamiltonian procedure  The standard development of Hamiltonian mechanics is inadequate in several specific situations: # When the Lagrangian is at most linear in the velocity of at least one coordinate; in which case, the definition of the canonical momentum leads to a constraint. This is the most frequent reason to resort to Dirac brackets. For instance, the Lagrangian (density) for any fermion is of this form. # When there are gauge (or other unphysical) degrees of freedom which need to be fixed. # When there are any other constraints that one wishes to impose in phase space. = Example of a Lagrangian linear in velocity = An example in classical mechanics is a particle with charge and mass confined to the - plane with a strong constant, homogeneous perpendicular magnetic field, so then pointing in the -direction with strength . The Lagrangian for this system with an appropriate choice of parameters is : L = \\\\tfrac{1}{2}m\\\\vec{v}^2 + \\\\frac{q}{c}\\\\vec{A}\\\\cdot\\\\vec{v} - V(\\\\vec{r}), where is the vector potential for the magnetic field, ; is the speed of light in vacuum; and is an arbitrary external scalar potential; one could easily take it to be quadratic in and , without loss of generality. We use : \\\\vec{A} = \\\\frac{B}{2}(x\\\\hat{y} - y\\\\hat{x}) as our vector potential; this corresponds to a uniform and constant magnetic field B in the z direction. Here, the hats indicate unit vectors. Later in the article, however, they are used to distinguish quantum mechanical operators from their classical analogs. The usage should be clear from the context. Explicitly, the Lagrangian amounts to just : L = \\\\frac{m}{2}(\\\\dot{x}^2 + \\\\dot{y}^2) + \\\\frac{qB}{2c}(x\\\\dot{y} - y\\\\dot{x}) - V(x, y) ~, which leads to the equations of motion : m\\\\ddot{x} = - \\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial x} + \\\\frac{q B}{c}\\\\dot{y} : m\\\\ddot{y} = - \\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial y} - \\\\frac{q B}{c}\\\\dot{x}. For a harmonic potential, the gradient of amounts to just the coordinates, . Now, in the limit of a very large magnetic field, . One may then drop the kinetic term to produce a simple approximate Lagrangian, : L = \\\\frac{qB}{2c}(x\\\\dot{y} - y\\\\dot{x}) - V(x, y)~, with first-order equations of motion : \\\\dot{y} = \\\\frac{c}{q B}\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial x} : \\\\dot{x} = -\\\\frac{c}{q B}\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial y}~. Note that this approximate Lagrangian is linear in the velocities, which is one of the conditions under which the standard Hamiltonian procedure breaks down. While this example has been motivated as an approximation, the Lagrangian under consideration is legitimate and leads to consistent equations of motion in the Lagrangian formalism. Following the Hamiltonian procedure, however, the canonical momenta associated with the coordinates are now : p_x = \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{x}} = -\\\\frac{q B}{2c}y : p_y = \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{y}} = \\\\frac{q B}{2c}x ~, which are unusual in that they are not invertible to the velocities; instead, they are constrained to be functions of the coordinates: the four phase-space variables are linearly dependent, so the variable basis is overcomplete. A Legendre transformation then produces the Hamiltonian : H(x,y, p_x, p_y) = \\\\dot{x}p_x + \\\\dot{y} p_y - L = V(x, y). Note that this \\"naive\\" Hamiltonian has no dependence on the momenta, which means that equations of motion (Hamilton's equations) are inconsistent. The Hamiltonian procedure has broken down. One might try to fix the problem by eliminating two of the components of the -dimensional phase space, say and , down to a reduced phase space of dimensions, that is sometimes expressing the coordinates as momenta and sometimes as coordinates. However, this is neither a general nor rigorous solution. This gets to the heart of the matter: that the definition of the canonical momenta implies a constraint on phase space (between momenta and coordinates) that was never taken into account.  Generalized Hamiltonian procedure  In Lagrangian mechanics, if the system has holonomic constraints, then one generally adds Lagrange multipliers to the Lagrangian to account for them. The extra terms vanish when the constraints are satisfied, thereby forcing the path of stationary action to be on the constraint surface. In this case, going to the Hamiltonian formalism introduces a constraint on phase space in Hamiltonian mechanics, but the solution is similar. Before proceeding, it is useful to understand the notions of weak equality and strong equality. Two functions on phase space, and , are weakly equal if they are equal when the constraints are satisfied, but not throughout the phase space, denoted . If and are equal independently of the constraints being satisfied, they are called strongly equal, written . It is important to note that, in order to get the right answer, no weak equations may be used before evaluating derivatives or Poisson brackets. The new procedure works as follows, start with a Lagrangian and define the canonical momenta in the usual way. Some of those definitions may not be invertible and instead give a constraint in phase space (as above). Constraints derived in this way or imposed from the beginning of the problem are called primary constraints. The constraints, labeled , must weakly vanish, . Next, one finds the naive Hamiltonian, , in the usual way via a Legendre transformation, exactly as in the above example. Note that the Hamiltonian can always be written as a function of s and s only, even if the velocities cannot be inverted into functions of the momenta. = Generalizing the Hamiltonian = Dirac argues that we should generalize the Hamiltonian (somewhat analogously to the method of Lagrange multipliers) to : H^* = H + \\\\sum_j c_j\\\\phi_j \\\\approx H, where the are not constants but functions of the coordinates and momenta. Since this new Hamiltonian is the most general function of coordinates and momenta weakly equal to the naive Hamiltonian, is the broadest generalization of the Hamiltonian possible so that when . To further illuminate the , consider how one gets the equations of motion from the naive Hamiltonian in the standard procedure. One expands the variation of the Hamiltonian out in two ways and sets them equal (using a somewhat abbreviated notation with suppressed indices and sums): : \\\\delta H = \\\\frac{\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial q}\\\\delta q + \\\\frac{\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial p}\\\\delta p \\\\approx \\\\dot{q}\\\\delta p - \\\\dot{p}\\\\delta q ~, where the second equality holds after simplifying with the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion and the definition of canonical momentum. From this equality, one deduces the equations of motion in the Hamiltonian formalism from : \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial q} + \\\\dot{p}\\\\right)\\\\delta q + \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial p} - \\\\dot{q}\\\\right)\\\\delta p = 0 ~, where the weak equality symbol is no longer displayed explicitly, since by definition the equations of motion only hold weakly. In the present context, one cannot simply set the coefficients of and separately to zero, since the variations are somewhat restricted by the constraints. In particular, the variations must be tangent to the constraint surface. One can demonstrate the solution to : \\\\sum_n A_n\\\\delta q_n + \\\\sum_n B_n\\\\delta p_n = 0, for the variations and restricted by the constraints (assuming the constraints satisfy some regularity conditions) is generallySee page 8 in Henneaux and Teitelboim in the references. : A_n = \\\\sum_m u_m \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi_m}{\\\\partial q_n} : B_n = \\\\sum_m u_m \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi_m}{\\\\partial p_n}, where the are arbitrary functions. Using this result, the equations of motion become : \\\\dot{p}_j = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial q_j} - \\\\sum_k u_k \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi_k}{\\\\partial q_j} : \\\\dot{q}_j = \\\\frac{\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial p_j} + \\\\sum_k u_k \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi_k}{\\\\partial p_j} : \\\\phi_j(q, p) = 0, where the are functions of coordinates and velocities that can be determined, in principle, from the second equation of motion above. The Legendre transform between the Lagrangian formalism and the Hamiltonian formalism has been saved at the cost of adding new variables. = Consistency conditions = The equations of motion become more compact when using the Poisson bracket, since if is some function of the coordinates and momenta then : \\\\dot{f} \\\\approx \\\\\\\\{f, H^*\\\\\\\\}_{PB} \\\\approx \\\\\\\\{f, H\\\\\\\\}_{PB} + \\\\sum_k u_k\\\\\\\\{f, \\\\phi_k\\\\\\\\}_{PB}, if one assumes that the Poisson bracket with the (functions of the velocity) exist; this causes no problems since the contribution weakly vanishes. Now, there are some consistency conditions which must be satisfied in order for this formalism to make sense. If the constraints are going to be satisfied, then their equations of motion must weakly vanish, that is, we require : \\\\dot{\\\\phi_j} \\\\approx \\\\\\\\{\\\\phi_j, H\\\\\\\\}_{PB} + \\\\sum_k u_k\\\\\\\\{\\\\phi_j,\\\\phi_k\\\\\\\\}_{PB} \\\\approx 0. There are four different types of conditions that can result from the above: # An equation that is inherently false, such as . # An equation that is identically true, possibly after using one of our primary constraints. # An equation that places new constraints on our coordinates and momenta, but is independent of the . # An equation that serves to specify the . The first case indicates that the starting Lagrangian gives inconsistent equations of motion, such as . The second case does not contribute anything new. The third case gives new constraints in phase space. A constraint derived in this manner is called a secondary constraint. Upon finding the secondary constraint one should add it to the extended Hamiltonian and check the new consistency conditions, which may result in still more constraints. Iterate this process until there are no more constraints. The distinction between primary and secondary constraints is largely an artificial one (i.e. a constraint for the same system can be primary or secondary depending on the Lagrangian), so this article does not distinguish between them from here on. Assuming the consistency condition has been iterated until all of the constraints have been found, then will index all of them. Note this article uses secondary constraint to mean any constraint that was not initially in the problem or derived from the definition of canonical momenta; some authors distinguish between secondary constraints, tertiary constraints, et cetera. Finally, the last case helps fix the . If, at the end of this process, the are not completely determined, then that means there are unphysical (gauge) degrees of freedom in the system. Once all of the constraints (primary and secondary) are added to the naive Hamiltonian and the solutions to the consistency conditions for the are plugged in, the result is called the total Hamiltonian. = Determination of the = The uk must solve a set of inhomogeneous linear equations of the form : \\\\\\\\{\\\\phi_j, H\\\\\\\\}_{PB} + \\\\sum_k u_k\\\\\\\\{\\\\phi_j,\\\\phi_k\\\\\\\\}_{PB} \\\\approx 0. The above equation must possess at least one solution, since otherwise the initial Lagrangian is inconsistent; however, in systems with gauge degrees of freedom, the solution will not be unique. The most general solution is of the form : u_k = U_k + V_k, where is a particular solution and is the most general solution to the homogeneous equation : \\\\sum_k V_k\\\\\\\\{\\\\phi_j,\\\\phi_k\\\\\\\\}_{PB}\\\\approx 0. The most general solution will be a linear combination of linearly independent solutions to the above homogeneous equation. The number of linearly independent solutions equals the number of (which is the same as the number of constraints) minus the number of consistency conditions of the fourth type (in previous subsection). This is the number of unphysical degrees of freedom in the system. Labeling the linear independent solutions where the index runs from to the number of unphysical degrees of freedom, the general solution to the consistency conditions is of the form : u_k \\\\approx U_k + \\\\sum_a v_a V^a_k, where the are completely arbitrary functions of time. A different choice of the corresponds to a gauge transformation, and should leave the physical state of the system unchanged.Weinberg, Steven, The Quantum Theory of Fields, Volume 1. Cambridge University Press, 1995. = The total Hamiltonian = At this point, it is natural to introduce the total Hamiltonian : H_T = H + \\\\sum_k U_k\\\\phi_k + \\\\sum_{a, k} v_a V^a_k \\\\phi_k and what is denoted : H' = H + \\\\sum_k U_k \\\\phi_k. The time evolution of a function on the phase space, is governed by : \\\\dot{f} \\\\approx \\\\\\\\{f, H_T\\\\\\\\}_{PB}. Later, the extended Hamiltonian is introduced. For gauge-invariant (physically measurable quantities) quantities, all of the Hamiltonians should give the same time evolution, since they are all weakly equivalent. It is only for nongauge-invariant quantities that the distinction becomes important.  The Dirac bracket  Above is everything needed to find the equations of motion in Dirac's modified Hamiltonian procedure. Having the equations of motion, however, is not the endpoint for theoretical considerations. If one wants to canonically quantize a general system, then one needs the Dirac brackets. Before defining Dirac brackets, first-class and second-class constraints need to be introduced. We call a function of coordinates and momenta first class if its Poisson bracket with all of the constraints weakly vanishes, that is, : \\\\\\\\{f, \\\\phi_j\\\\\\\\}_{PB} \\\\approx 0, for all . Note that the only quantities that weakly vanish are the constraints , and therefore anything that weakly vanishes must be strongly equal to a linear combination of the constraints. One can demonstrate that the Poisson bracket of two first class quantities must also be first class. The first class constraints are intimately connected with the unphysical degrees of freedom mentioned earlier. Namely, the number of independent first class constraints is equal to the number of unphysical degrees of freedom, and furthermore the primary first class constraints generate gauge transformations. Dirac further postulated that all secondary first class constraints are generators of gauge transformations, which turns out to be false; however, typically one operates under the assumption that all first class constraints generate gauge transformations when using this treatment.See Henneaux and Teitelboim, pages 18-19. When the first-class secondary constraints are added into the Hamiltonian with arbitrary as the first class primary constraints are added to arrive at the total Hamiltonian, then one obtains the extended Hamiltonian. The extended Hamiltonian gives the most general possible time evolution for any gauge-dependent quantities, and may actually generalize the equations of motion from those of the Lagrangian formalism. For the purposes of introducing the Dirac bracket, of more immediate interest are the second class constraints. Second class constraints are constraints that have nonvanishing Poisson bracket with at least one other constraint. For instance, consider constraints and whose Poisson bracket is simply a constant, , : \\\\\\\\{\\\\phi_1,\\\\phi_2\\\\\\\\}_{PB} = c ~. Now, suppose one wishes to employ canonical quantization, then the phase-space coordinates become operators whose commutators become times their classical Poisson bracket. Assuming there are no ordering issues that give rise to new quantum corrections, this implies that : [\\\\hat{\\\\phi}_1, \\\\hat{\\\\phi}_2] = i\\\\hbar ~c, where the hats emphasize the fact that the constraints are on operators. On one hand, canonical quantization gives the above commutation relation, but on the other hand 1 and are constraints that must vanish on physical states, whereas the right-hand side cannot vanish. This example illustrates the need for some generalization of the Poisson bracket which respects the system's constraints, and which leads to a consistent quantization procedure. This new bracket should be bilinear, antisymmetric, satisfy the Jacobi identity as does the Poisson bracket, reduce to the Poisson bracket for unconstrained systems, and, additionally, the bracket of any constraint with any other quantity must vanish. At this point, the second class constraints will be labeled . Define a matrix with entries : M_{ab} = \\\\\\\\{\\\\tilde{\\\\phi}_a,\\\\tilde{\\\\phi}_b\\\\\\\\}_{PB}. In this case, the Dirac bracket of two functions on phase space, and , is defined as where denotes the entry of 's inverse matrix. Dirac proved that will always be invertible. It is straightforward to check that the above definition of the Dirac bracket satisfies all of the desired properties, and especially the last one, of vanishing for an argument which is a constraint. When applying canonical quantization on a constrained Hamiltonian system, the commutator of the operators is supplanted by times their classical Dirac bracket. Since the Dirac bracket respects the constraints, one need not be careful about evaluating all brackets before using any weak equations, as is the case with the Poisson bracket. Note that while the Poisson bracket of bosonic (Grassmann even) variables with itself must vanish, the Poisson bracket of fermions represented as a Grassmann variables with itself need not vanish. This means that in the fermionic case it is possible for there to be an odd number of second class constraints.  Illustration on the example provided Returning to the above example, the naive Hamiltonian and the two primary constraints are : H = V(x, y) : \\\\phi_1 = p_x + \\\\tfrac{q B}{2c} y,\\\\qquad \\\\phi_2 = p_y - \\\\tfrac{q B}{2 c} x. Therefore, the extended Hamiltonian can be written : H^* = V(x, y) + u_1 \\\\left(p_x + \\\\tfrac{q B}{2c}y\\\\right) + u_2 \\\\left(p_y - \\\\tfrac{q B}{2c}x\\\\right). The next step is to apply the consistency conditions , which in this case become : \\\\\\\\{\\\\phi_1, H\\\\\\\\}_{PB}+\\\\sum_j u_j\\\\\\\\{\\\\phi_1, \\\\phi_j\\\\\\\\}_{PB} = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial x} + u_2 \\\\frac{q B}{c} \\\\approx 0 : \\\\\\\\{\\\\phi_2, H\\\\\\\\}_{PB}+\\\\sum_j u_j\\\\\\\\{\\\\phi_2, \\\\phi_j\\\\\\\\}_{PB} = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial y} - u_1 \\\\frac{q B}{c} \\\\approx 0. These are not secondary constraints, but conditions that fix and . Therefore, there are no secondary constraints and the arbitrary coefficients are completely determined, indicating that there are no unphysical degrees of freedom. If one plugs in with the values of and , then one can see that the equations of motion are : \\\\dot{x} = \\\\\\\\{x, H\\\\\\\\}_{PB} + u_1\\\\\\\\{x, \\\\phi_1\\\\\\\\}_{PB} + u_2 \\\\\\\\{x, \\\\phi_2\\\\\\\\} = -\\\\frac{c}{q B} \\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial y} : \\\\dot{y} = \\\\frac{c}{q B} \\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial x} : \\\\dot{p}_x = -\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial x} : \\\\dot{p}_y = -\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial y}, which are self- consistent and coincide with the Lagrangian equations of motion. A simple calculation confirms that and are second class constraints since : \\\\\\\\{\\\\phi_1, \\\\phi_2\\\\\\\\}_{PB} = - \\\\\\\\{\\\\phi_2, \\\\phi_1\\\\\\\\}_{PB} = \\\\frac{q B}{c}, hence the matrix looks like : M = \\\\frac{q B}{c} \\\\left(\\\\begin{matrix} 0 & 1\\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 & 0 \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right), which is easily inverted to : M^{-1} = \\\\frac{c}{q B} \\\\left(\\\\begin{matrix} 0 & -1\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right) \\\\quad\\\\Rightarrow\\\\quad M^{-1}_{ab} = -\\\\frac{c}{q B_0} \\\\varepsilon_{ab}, where is the Levi-Civita symbol. Thus, the Dirac brackets are defined to be : \\\\\\\\{f, g\\\\\\\\}_{DB} = \\\\\\\\{f, g\\\\\\\\}_{PB} + \\\\frac{c\\\\varepsilon_{ab}}{q B} \\\\\\\\{f, \\\\phi_a\\\\\\\\}_{PB}\\\\\\\\{\\\\phi_b, g\\\\\\\\}_{PB}. If one always uses the Dirac bracket instead of the Poisson bracket, then there is no issue about the order of applying constraints and evaluating expressions, since the Dirac bracket of anything weakly zero is strongly equal to zero. This means that one can just use the naive Hamiltonian with Dirac brackets, instead, to thus get the correct equations of motion, which one can easily confirm on the above ones. To quantize the system, the Dirac brackets between all of the phase space variables are needed. The nonvanishing Dirac brackets for this system are : \\\\\\\\{x, y\\\\\\\\}_{DB} = -\\\\frac{c}{q B} : \\\\\\\\{x, p_x\\\\\\\\}_{DB} = \\\\\\\\{y, p_y\\\\\\\\}_{DB} = \\\\tfrac{1}{2} while the cross-terms vanish, and : \\\\\\\\{p_x, p_y\\\\\\\\}_{DB} = - \\\\frac{q B}{4c}. Therefore, the correct implementation of canonical quantization dictates the commutation relations, : [\\\\hat{x}, \\\\hat{y}] = -i\\\\frac{\\\\hbar c}{q B} : [\\\\hat{x}, \\\\hat{p}_x] = [\\\\hat{y}, \\\\hat{p}_y] = i\\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2} with the cross terms vanishing, and : [\\\\hat{p}_x, \\\\hat{p}_y] = -i\\\\frac{\\\\hbar q B}{4c}~. This example has a nonvanishing commutator between and , which means this structure specifies a noncommutative geometry. (Since the two coordinates do not commute, there will be an uncertainty principle for the and positions.) Further Illustration for a hypersphere Similarly, for free motion on a hypersphere , the coordinates are constrained, . From a plain kinetic Lagrangian, it is evident that their momenta are perpendicular to them, . Thus the corresponding Dirac Brackets are likewise simple to work out, : \\\\\\\\{x_i, x_j\\\\\\\\}_{DB} = 0, : \\\\\\\\{x_i, p_j\\\\\\\\}_{DB} = \\\\delta_{ij} -x_i x_j , : \\\\\\\\{p_i, p_j\\\\\\\\}_{DB} = x_j p_i - x_i p_j ~. The ( constrained phase-space variables obey much simpler Dirac brackets than the unconstrained variables, had one eliminated one of the s and one of the s through the two constraints ab initio, which would obey plain Poisson brackets. The Dirac brackets add simplicity and elegance, at the cost of excessive (constrained) phase-space variables. For example, for free motion on a circle, , for and eliminating from the circle constraint yields the unconstrained :L=\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\frac {{\\\\dot z}^2}{1-z^2} ~, with equations of motion :{\\\\ddot z} =-z \\\\frac {{\\\\dot z}^2}{1-z^2} =-z 2E ~, an oscillation; whereas the equivalent constrained system with yields :{\\\\dot x}^i =\\\\\\\\{x^i,H\\\\\\\\}_{DB} = p^i~, :{\\\\dot p}^i =\\\\\\\\{p^i,H\\\\\\\\}_{DB} = x^i ~ p^2~, whence, instantly, virtually by inspection, oscillation for both variables, :{\\\\ddot x}^i = - x^i 2E ~.

Briefly around 1906 however, the road basked in the limelight of the mighty E.H. Harriman who considered, and then discarded, the idea of incorporating it into one of his \\"paper\\" railroads projected through the region. History =Timber industry= The roots of this operation date back to 1884 when the Morris brothers began construction of a flume from the rich timber belt near Round Mountain about northeast of Redding on the Little Cow Creek drainage to a point below the snow belt. From here, sawn boards were transported by wagons to the railhead. Ownership passed to Joseph Enright of Chico, who extended the flume (up to ) to a planing mill, drying shed, and box factory he erected where Little Cow Creek and Dry Creek join to form Cow Creek. The community around the operation became known as Bella Vista. =Anderson and Bella Vista Railroad= Northern portion of route in 1901 The bottleneck of the operation was the transfer of the lumber from the mill at Bella Vista to the nearest rail connection, which was away in Redding and on the wrong side of the Sacramento River. Clearly, a standard gauge shortline railroad would need to be constructed. In about 1891, work began on the Anderson & Bella Vista Railroad down the valley of Cow Creek to the Southern Pacific rail connection in Anderson.  Construction  Little grading was required, the only major obstacle being the crossing of the Sacramento River north of Anderson which was originally done with a ferry. The top heavy arrangement of the ferry proved to be fatal for the railroad's first locomotive. A diminutive 4-4-0 named J.G. Kellog which one day fell into the river never to be recovered. The locomotive is still there; it was discovered again during construction of a new road bridge across the river, next to the old one. Following this incident, the railroad opted to build a trestle instead. There are plans to raise the loco.  Sale to J. E. Terry  By 1897, Enright had sold all his properties, including the A&BV;, to Joseph E. Terry, reportedly for $87,000. The 2-4-0 locomotive (obtained from the Visalia Railroad to replace the J.C. Kellog) was appropriately named J.E. Terry.  Traffic  From the beginning, the road was never intended as a common carrier or passenger road. The top speed was around and most of the business came from the mills in Bella Vista, although other producers used the line on occasion.  Operating equipment in 1906  The operating equipment in 1906 consisted of a single locomotive, a leased Southern Pacific 4-4-0 numbered 1341 which replaced the J.E. Terry following an enginehouse fire in Bella Vista in December 1905. The line also had one boxcar, Oregon Short Line no. 7385 which was used as a caboose, express car, and coach. In addition there were 2 hand cars, 3 light pushers, and 3 center dump gravel cars. This survey of equipment was part of a comprehensive study for Southern Pacific chief engineer William Hood. It seems that the Anderson and Bella Vista Railroad mainline lay directly in the path of the Goose Lake and Southern Railway, a Harriman contrivance, an arm of which was projected into the area in 1906 on its way from the Goose Lake area, via Alturus, some to a connection with the SP at Anderson. Nothing was to come of the project however. =Incorporation of the California, Shasta and Eastern= The California Shasta & Eastern was incorporated June 4, 1913, but did not formally take title to the A&BV; until September 4. Evidently, this was a legal dodge by Terry who interested the Afterthought Copper Company to purchase the line. The purchase was made for $200,000 and a $405,000 extension to Ingot was announced. This never materialized. Following fires in Bella Vista in 1917, Terry disappeared, departing on an SP train in Anderson never to return. The Afterthought Copper Company was experiencing declining revenues with the loss of lumber traffic at Bella Vista and railroad went idle. By March 1920, the Red River Lumber Company was in control and pumped men and money into the railroad laying new ties and rails where needed on the CS&E; as well as improving and restoring logging operations on Round Mountain and rebuilding the mill at Bella Vista. Unfortunately, the industry went into recession by late 1920 and the entire logging operation was shut down. The logging railroad on Round Mountain was pulled up in 1925. Operations on the railroad became infrequent, although for unknown reasons, the Red River Lumber Company continued to spend money on the line. In 1925, the piers on the original bridge over the Sacramento River were replaced with concrete at a cost of nearly $19,000. Red River made little use of the bridge and it was deeded to the county, along with much of the right of way which became Deschutes Road. The county filled in the deck with concrete until a new bridge was built in 1972. The remaining railroad was torn up in 1937, although official permission to abandon the line was not granted by Interstate Commerce Commission until 1946. Locomotives =A&BV;= * J.G.

It closed in 1994. __TOC__ History The original building was a three story white stone-faced building. It was stocked with \\"the latest and largest line of dry goods, notions, cloaks, ladies' tailor-made suits, and men's furnishings\\". The Globe Store eventually moved to Scranton where it would gain local fame. The Scranton Globe Store was the Cleland, Simpson & Taylor building on Wyoming Avenue. The original building of Cleland was destroyed by fire on March 17, 1889.  Golden years  The new Globe Store in Scranton was one of the only stores of its kind in the city. It had sometimes been compared to the stores of New York City with its large display windows, enormous selection with all of the latest fashions, and its restaurant, the Charlmont (later converted to cafeteria style restaurant). The Globe continued to prosper throughout the 1900s, adding a wider selection of goods and other features to the store. It had elaborate outside decorations during the Christmas season.  Economic downturn and closure  The founding families ran the store until 1979, a full decade after it became a division of John Wanamaker; the Globe continued to break sales records into the 1980s. In 1978, at the request of the Wanamaker family, Carter Hawley Hale (CHH) acquired John Wanamaker and its The Globe Store division. CHH invested heavily in Wanamaker‚Äôs and The Globe intending to expand The Globes‚Äô footprint. Carter Hawley Hale became embroiled in a fight to thwart 2 hostile takeover attempts by DeBartolo/Wexner and was forced to sell John Wanamaker and The Globe to Woodward & Lothrop. Woodies sold The Globe to local investors in 1989. Competition from suburban malls and retail consolidations had a detrimental impact. In 1993, Scranton‚Äôs Steamtown Mall opened in an effort to draw dollars back downtown. The Globe was connected to the new mall via a pedestrian bridge, intended to lure shoppers across Lackawanna Avenue. Anchor stores in the new downtown mall changed, the Globe Store struggled and encountered innumerable financial and legal troubles. It filed for bankruptcy right after New Year‚Äôs Day, 1994. Finally closing in April, after laying off 400 workers, when PNC Bank seized the store's assets. The former Globe building was converted to office space and is occupied by Diversified Information Technologies. The pedestrian bridge was closed off from the Globe and turned into the furniture department of Boscov's, one of the other anchors of the mall. That area become a Steve and Barry'ssportswear store until Steve and Barry's bankruptcy and subsequent liquidation. The area is now a Crunch Gym. Future In 2016, the Lackawanna County commission announced that most of the county‚Äôs offices would relocate to The Globe Store building following restoration and necessary renovations.

Alexander Lenard (; ; Budapest, 9 March 1910 ‚Äì Dona Emma, Brazil, 13 April 1972) was a Hungarian physician, writer, translator, painter, musician, poet and occasional language instructor. He was born in Budapest, Hungary and died in Dona Irma (Dona Emma), in the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil. He is best known as the Latin translator of A. A. Milne's Winnie the Pooh (Winnie Ille Pu). He wrote fiction and non-fiction in German, Latin, Hungarian, Italian and English. Life Lenard was born in the family of Jen≈ë L√©n√°rd (1878-1924) and Ilona Hoffmann (1888-1938), he was the first son in their family. Alexander Lenard's home in Dona Irma. In 1920 the L√©n√°rd family moved from Hungary to Austria. His first studies were private lessons at home because he couldn't stand being at school. In 1920-1921 he began his study at Wiener Theresianum (a board school in Vienna) where he was being hungry and cold, and only a few days at home at weekends were a real happiness to him.Sikl√≥s:Von Budapest bis zum Tal am Ende der Welt S√°ndor L√©n√°rds romanhafter Lebensweg Retrieved on 16 Jan 2018 But he didn't stay in this school for long because their family moved to Klosterneuburg and there he finished his studying in 1928. During his leisure time he was practicing in playing piano, rowing, swimming and running. S√°ndor conducted his medical studies at the University of Vienna. He continued studying in the university till 1936 and had a good relationship with the professors and his fellow students; with some of them, the likes of Karl Adams and Egon Fenz, he had contacts till his death. During the period of 30' he travelled a lot and visited such countries as Greece, Denmark, England, the Czech Republic, France, and Turkey. In 1936 he married Gerda Coste, who gave birth to their son Hans-Gerd. After the 1938 \\"Anschluss\\" with Germany, he escaped to Italy. There is no notice if he had obtained his certificate in medicine, because literature and poetry were more attractive to him. His staying in Italy he described as a very productive time for his poetry. At the beginning of the World War II he attempted to join the French Army in Basel as a volunteer but failed to do this. During World World II, he escaped the attention of the Fascist regime by leaving no \\"paper trail\\" (identity card, ration card, etc.). He survived by trading his medical services for food and shelter. His leisure hours were spent in the Vatican library, reading texts in Latin until it became a colloquial language to him. He met his second wife, Andrietta Arborio di Gattinara from a noble family, in 1942. His brother K√°roly died in 1944 in a Nazi labour camp (Arbeitslager) while his sister settled in England. In 1951, he emigrated to Brazil, where he won the S√£o Paulo Television Bach competition in 1956. He settled in the Dona Irma valley, where he bought a small farm with a house he made \\"invisible\\" by surrounding it with his favourite trees. He treated the local population medically until his death in 1972. Work While in Brazil, he tutored the daughter of a local resident in Latin, and she expressed the wish for something interesting to read. In response, he translated Winnie the Pooh, for which he combed the classics for idiomatic expressions used during ancient times. He was working on this translation for about 7 years and could not find a publisher to have this work edited. And at last he published the first copies by his own money.Tagged ‚ÄòAlexander Lenard‚Äô Retrieved on 16 Jan 2018 Privately printed, the book gradually reached larger audiences until it became an international best- seller.

A dumpling‚Äîin this context‚Äîis a biscuit dough, which is a mixture of flour, shortening, and liquid (water, milk, buttermilk, or chicken stock). The dumplings are either rolled out flat, dropped or formed into a ball. It is a popular comfort food dish, commonly found in the Southern and Midwestern United States, that is also attributed to being a French Canadian meal that originated during the Great Depression. Some sources say that chicken and dumplings originated in the Southern United States during antebellum era and was considered a mainstay during harsh economic times. One of the earliest versions of the recipe was cornmeal dumplings cooked with turnip greens. Chicken and dumplings as a dish is prepared with a combination of simmered chicken meat, broth produced by simmering the chicken, multiple dumplings, and salt and pepper for seasoning. Sometimes finely chopped vegetables, such as carrots and celery, are added to the broth, and herbs such as dill, parsley, thyme, or chives are added to the dumpling dough. Preparation Various commercial preparations of chicken and dumplings are available, including canned and frozen versions of the prepared dish. Frozen raw dumplings, typically very flat strips about 1x4 inches, can be cooked in any broth. The consistency of the prepared dish, whether homemade or purchased, varies from a thin soup to a very thick casserole-like consistency, easily eaten with a fork. Thicker preparations are made by gently simmering the dumplings longer and/or adding flour or another thickening agent directly to the broth. Flour tortillas or canned biscuits, rolled thin on a floured surface, cut into strips, are a quick and easy substitute for homemade dough. Butter may be added to the recipe for added richness. Since chicken meat would become dry and tough if it is boiled long enough to cook the dumplings and thicken the broth, the chicken or parts are removed from the broth before adding the dumplings. While the dumplings are cooking, the meat is separated from the bones. When the dumplings are done and the broth seasoned and thickened, the chicken is returned to the broth. The dish is then ready to be served, but may be kept on low heat so as to not further cook the chicken. Variations Chicken and dumpling soup at Nicoll's Cafe in Pine City, Minnesota. A variant known as \\"chicken and pastry\\" or simply \\"chicken pastry\\" features wide, flat noodles rolled from biscuit dough. Where such a distinction is made, it is sometimes considered a different dish from \\"chicken and dumplings\\", which is known for small balls of dough rather than flat strips. In the Appalachian region of the United States, this preparation is called chicken and slicks. The Pennsylvania Dutch version is called bott boi. Chicken and dumpling soup is another variation, and is very popular in the Midwest. =Bott boi= Pennsylvania Dutch bott boi is a soup popular in central and southeastern Pennsylvania, also called chicken and dumplings in the American south. Bearing no resemblance to the baked dish known elsewhere as pot pie (itself known within Pennsylvania as \\"meat pies\\"), bott boi consists of large square noodles and a meat such as chicken, ham, or beef simmered in stock. Other common ingredients include potatoes, carrots, or celery. Saffron may also be added as a flavoring, particularly in Pennsylvanian restaurants catering to a niche market among the Pennsylvania Dutch farming communities. Created to use up leftovers, Pennsylvania Dutch pot pie developed from the more widespread baked variety. Its characteristic noodles were added as a staple of the Pennsylvania Dutch and English diets. The ease of preparing it in large quantities has made it popular for fundraisers, community dinners, and other large-scale preparations. Preparation Bott boi is a soup of thick square-cut dough boiled in chicken broth. (Turkey or other poultry can be substituted for the chicken.) Potatoes and various vegetables may be added, and the broth can also be seasoned with saffron. The simple dough is made from flour and eggs, with a little water or milk. International versions Although the dumpling has been around for many generations, each culture has its own way of individualizing the basic dumpling recipe. There are other international versions of chicken and dumplings. For instance, the Chinese culture has the wonton, which is similar to the chicken and dumplings dish as we know it today. Additionally, the Iranian-Jewish dish, called gondi, includes matzah ball dumplings, which are also common in Central European food. Since the creation of the dumpling, various meats aside from chicken have accompanied it, such as beef, lamb and pork.

Historically, the lake was spring-fed, and sat on the property of William Neil in North Columbus (then a city of its own, which would later be annexed by Columbus). The trustees in charge of purchasing land for the new Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College (which would later become the Ohio State University) chose to purchase Mr. Neil's land after drinking from the spring. A German trustee reportedly stated \\"It's hard to get a Dutchman away from a spring like that.\\" The spring dried up in 1891 when the city of Columbus struck the source of the spring while installing a trunk sewer line through campus. The water source was subsequently provided by the city of Columbus municipal water supply, at a new location on campus near the location of the original lake. Visitors, students, faculty, and staff enjoy the fountains that run in spring, summer, and autumn. In 2014, a well was dug to feed the lake from groundwater, eliminating the need to use municipal water. Light up the Lake Mirror Lake during at Light Up The Lake event Light Up The Lake is an event hosted by The Ohio Staters Inc., a student organization at The Ohio State University, to kick off the holiday season. Students hang white seasonal lights throughout the Mirror Lake and Browning Amphitheatre area. A lighting ceremony takes place when the lights are turned on for the first time of the season, usually the week following Thanksgiving. Michigan week tradition It is a tradition for students to jump into the lake around midnight on the Tuesday night prior to the annual football game between the Ohio State Buckeyes and the Michigan Wolverines. Even though students have jumped into Mirror Lake according to tradition since 1969, the modern tradition started in 1990 when Jim Jones led a parade of students on a traditional march around campus. At the end of the parade ‚Äî at Mirror Lake ‚Äî students made the celebratory jump. While the jumps of the past few years have drawn crowds of several thousand, less than 100 people leaped into the lake in 1990, led by someone named \\"Marmaduke\\" and a few other AEPi fraternity members wanting to add to the historic rivalry. Approximately 12,000 people either jumped or were near the lake for the 2009 jump. However, with a change in the Big Ten scheduling to add a bye week to the season coming in 2010 puts the game on the Saturday during Thanksgiving weekend, threatening the tradition as the Thursday night prior to the game would be Thanksgiving. Students have suggested moving the jump to the Tuesday prior to the game to allow the jump to continue.https://www.facebook.com/home.php?#!/group.php?gid=35236922319&ref;=search&sid;=zznWis04gEwyRoGNk_sSfg.2499037442..1 As of November 23, 2010, the jump was on a Tuesday night for the first time and a dedicated following of six thousand fans before midnight (the jump takes place for most students between the hours of 10pm and 2am).http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2010/11/24/school- spirit-trumps-cold-dirty-water.html?sid=101 Students jumping in Mirror Lake before the 2009 game The Mirror Lake Jump event is not a university sponsored event, and people are encouraged not to participate by The Ohio State University.http://studentaffairs.osu.edu/articles/mirror-lake-jump Although the event has been associated with a variety of emergency room visits, and loss or destruction of property, folklore exists that calls it the \\"Lucky Mirror Lake Jump\\" event. There are OSU graduates who have jumped into Mirror Lake according to tradition who have become very wealthy and have had wonderful lives. Of course, at least one person has been paralyzed from an injury associated with Mirror Lake, and another person has died, although neither was directly related to the Mirror Lake Jump event.http://www.thelantern.com/2.1345/mirror-lake-poses-a-real-threat-for- trespassers-1.83439#.Tsm2MMNFu7shttp://www.10tv.com/content/stories/2013/09/24/ohio- state-university-mirror-lake-near-drowning-victim-pronounced-dead.html One man did die in 2015 after being pulled out of the lake http://nbc4i.com/2015/11/25/man-rescued-from-water-during-annual-mirror-lake- jump/ The 2010 Mirror Lake Jump was associated with approximately 25 trips to the emergency room for cuts, sprains, and other injuries.http://swc.osu.edu/mirror-lake-jump-in/ The 2004 Mirror Lake Jump was associated with at least three injuries. A study was conducted during one of the Mirror Lake Jumps where water samples were taken from the lake throughout the night. It was noteworthy that the ammonia levels in the lake greatly increased throughout the night. This has been attributed to people urinating in the lake.http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2009/11/19/mirror- lake-jump-urine.html There has also been concern that the lake may be a potential source for disease infection, salmonella is a concern. The Ohio State University usually spends approximately $20,000.00 cleaning up the landscape and property surrounding Mirror Lake after the jump event.http://www.thelantern.com/campus/unplanned-patriotic-plunge-leaves- mirror-lake-unscathed-1.2216768#.Tsm2LMNFu7s Jumping into Mirror Lake is also a fourth-degree misdemeanor, however police acknowledge that they ignore this during jump events in order to focus on the safety of those present.http://www.thelantern.com/campus/officials-don-t-jump- thursday-1.1794442#.Tsm5GMNFu7s 2013 has seen a change in the attitude of the University toward this tradition. The Ohio State University required wristbands to participate in the 2013 jump which was scheduled for November 26.http://thelantern.com/2013/11/ohio-state-access-mirror-lake-jump-will- require-wristband/ The area was fenced off, and only those with the wristbands were allowed to enter the area; the area spanned from Neil avenue to past Browning amphitheater.http://www.elevenwarriors.com/2013/11/29339/ohio-state- requiring-wrist-bands-other-restrictions-on-mirror-lake-jump The wrist bands were available at the Union to enrolled Ohio State students. In defiance of these regulations, another jump took place on Monday, November 25, 2013, the night before the regularly scheduled Michigan game jump. Through the use of social media, many students organized a last minute unofficial jump as a response to school officials. Students upset at the new regulations tore down the fences and jumped in the lake a night earlier than planned. =Student death= On November 25, 2015, shortly after midnight, Austin Singletary's body was found underwater after jumping into Mirror Lake during the annual jump. According to Ohio State's website, Singletary was a student in the university‚Äôs College of Education and Human Ecology, majoring in human nutrition, pursuing a minor in business administration and worked as a Social Change Site Leader via the University's Outreach arm, Buckeye Civic Engagement Connection. A preliminary investigation and autopsy concluded that the death was the result of a fracture of the C-5 vertebra, which can lead to paralysis of the arms, legs and diaphragm, causing death. He was pulled from the lake in cardiac arrest at 12:20 a.m. Wednesday. He immediately received treatment by on-site paramedics and was rushed to Wexner Medical Center on Ohio State's campus, but later died. University Officials took to social media and news outlets to help identify Singletary. President Michael V. Drake later released a statement, saying, \\"We are heartbroken over this horrible tragedy. We have tentatively identified the young man as a student and are in the process of reaching out to his family. During this difficult time, counseling services will be made available throughout the holiday weekend for those who seek support.\\" Ohio State Officials quickly announced plans to work with students and the OSU community to end the annual jump. Ohio State's Undergraduate Student Government soon after released a statement agreeing to work with the University to end the tradition and \\"create a new one\\". =Non-Michigan game jumps= A notable non-Michigan game jump occurred on the night of May 1, 2011, when students jumped into the lake in the wake of the death of Osama bin Laden, announced on television at approximately 11:30 pm.http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2011/05/03/leap- into-mirror-lake-marks-end-of-an-era.html?sid=101 Draining On November 22, 2019, the University announced that the lake would be drained in order to prevent anyone from jumping in the lake before the annual Michigan game.

The role dated to the time when Athens was ruled by kings, and their wives acted as priestesses. The duties of the basilinna are described in the pseudo-Demosthenic speech Against Neaira, which is the main source of evidence about the position. The laws which set out the qualifications for a basilinna were inscribed on a stele which stood in the sanctuary of Dionysus at Limnai. She was expected to be of Athenian birth and not previously married, though Noel Robertson argues that these requirements may have been ignored as inconvenient. The most important duty of the basilinna appears to have been taking part in a sacred ritual marriage to the god Dionysus as part of the Anthesteria. This ceremony seems to have taken place at the Boukoleion, near the Prytaneion. Most scholars consider that this would have happened on the second day of the festival (\\"Choes\\"). However, Robertson suggests that it in fact happened on the first day of the festival (\\"Pithoigia\\"). Ludwig Deubner has proposed a full reconstruction of the ceremony, in which Dionysus was taken in a procession to the sanctuary at Limnai and married to the basilinna; both the basilinna and Dionysus were then taken in a wedding procession to the Boukoleion, where the marriage was consummated, with the archon basileus playing the part of Dionysus. The basilinna was also responsible for administering an oath to the gerarai, women priests apparently appointed by the archon basileus. This took place on the second day of the Anthesteria, and Robertson argues that it must have taken place after the wedding.  References  Works cited  Further reading * Otto, Walter F.

Perrow published the first folk version of this song in 1915, which he collected from East Tennessee in 1912.Perrow, \\"Songs and Rhymes from the South,\\" p. 142: \\"from Tennessee mountain whites, 1912\\". The folk version of the song‚Äîas with Riley's‚Äîdoes not have any distinct theme, but consists of various floating lyrics, some relating to \\"shortnin' bread\\", some not. The traditional chorus associated with the folk song goes: The Beach Boys version The song was recorded by the American rock band the Beach Boys numerous times. Only one version has seen official release, as the final track on their 1979 album L.A. (Light Album). During the 1970s, principal songwriter Brian Wilson was reportedly obsessed with the song, recording more than a dozen versions of the tune. Beach Boy Al Jardine speculated that Wilson's obsession with the song may have begun after co-writing the song \\"Ding Dang\\" with the Byrds' Roger McGuinn in the 1970s. McGuinn explained that Wilson had one day come to his house for amphetamines while escaping from his therapist. After McGuinn spent some time crafting \\"Ding Dang\\" with Wilson, he went to bed. The next day, he awoke to Wilson, still awake, and still playing \\"Ding Dang\\" on piano. Only one lyric was ever written: \\"I love a girl and I love her madly / I treat her so fine but she treats me so badly\\". During sessions for The Beach Boys Love You, engineer Earle Mankey commented that \\"everybody who showed up got subjected to 'Ding Dang'.\\" A significant number of \\"Ding Dang\\" and \\"Shortenin' Bread\\" permutations exist in the Beach Boys' tape vaults. Most of them are unreleased, with titles such as \\"Clangin'\\" (recorded with Harry Nilsson), \\"Brian's Jam\\", and \\"Rolling Up to Heaven\\". A version was completed for the unreleased album Adult/Child in late 1977. This recording was developed from a 1973 session conducted with Wilson's girl group side-project American Spring. Numerous anecdotes have been reported about Wilson's obsession with the song: * Singer-songwriter Alex Chilton recalled receiving middle-of-the-night phone calls from Wilson asking him to sing on a recording of \\"Shortenin' Bread\\"' (\\"He was telling me I have the perfect voice for it\\"). * The Monkees' Micky Dolenz said that when he tripped on LSD with Wilson, John Lennon, and Nilsson, Wilson played \\"Shortenin' Bread\\" on piano \\"over and over again\\". * Biographer Peter Ames Carlin wrote that Elton John and Iggy Pop were bemused by an extended, contumacious Wilson-led singalong of \\"Shortenin' Bread\\", leading Pop to flee the room proclaiming, \\"I gotta get out of here, man. This guy is nuts!\\" * Musician Alice Cooper recalled that Wilson considered \\"Shortnin' Bread\\" to be the greatest song ever written, as he quoted Wilson for an explanation: \\"I don't know, it's just the best song ever written.\\" Other renditions * The Andrews Sisters * Al Jolson * Gid Tanner * The Viscounts * Sonny Terry, Sonny Terry's New Sound: The Jawharp in Blues and Folk Music (1968) * Lawrence Tibbett * Fats Waller * Dave Brubeck * Frances Faye * Taj Mahal (musician) * Richard White * 1937 ‚Äì Nelson Eddy, Maytime * 1956 - Etta James, Etta \\"Miss Peaches\\" James: Shortnin' Bread Rock / Tears of Joy * 1963 ‚Äì Mississippi John Hurt, D.C.

It was inspired in part by the crimes of sex offender Toby Studebaker, and depicts a young woman meeting a middle-aged man fifteen years after being sexually abused by him when she was twelve. David Harrower's Blackbird is not to be confused with the Adam Rapp play of the same name. Synopsis At his workplace, 55-year-old Ray is shocked to be visited by a young woman, 27-year- old Una. Fifteen years earlier, they had a sexual relationship for three months when Una was 12 and Ray was 40; subsequently, Ray had been jailed for three years for statutory rape.\\"Blackbird Review: Child Rape, 15 Years Later\\" by Jonathan Mandell, newyorktheater.me, 18 March 2016 Ultimately, they ran off together, and, while Ray was taking time to compose himself after realizing what he had just done, he left her alone in a motel room. She got worried and left to find him, which led to both of them frantically searching for one another and raising suspicions within the small coastal town where they were staying. Eventually, a couple out walking their dog took Una in and called the police after learning why she was there. Ray was then arrested and imprisoned. Upon his release, he managed to establish a reasonably successful new life under another name, but Una recognized him in a photograph and tracked him down. Ray takes Una to the office break room, where the two engage in a long and difficult confrontation involving Una's continuing struggles to understand and come to terms with the abuse and her intensely conflicting emotions, which pivot between anger, curiosity, confusion, and even a persistent attachment to Ray, whom Una loved ‚Äì and she believed that he loved her. The fearful Ray, who is himself trying to forget the past and the potential feelings he had for Una, parries her demanding questions and descriptions of her feelings and experiences, all the while uncertain of her intentions. Film adaptation A film adaptation of the play titled Una premiered in September 2016 at the Telluride Film Festival. The film stars Rooney Mara as Una and Ben Mendelsohn as Ray.

Generally, large wether (castrated buck) goats are used for packing, though does may also be packed. While does are generally smaller and therefore able to carry somewhat less cargo, they may also provide fresh milk. Goats are domesticated herd animals. They will usually stay near camp and follow their human masters on the trail, much as dogs will, without having to be leashed or tethered. They are generally used in wilderness camping settings. A healthy and fit pack goat can carry up to 25 percent of its weight and walk up to about 12 miles per day depending on its load weight, the terrain, and the animal's conditioning. They are generally less expensive to own and operate than other pack animals since they are natural browsing animals and can feed themselves along the way. In the United States The North American Packgoat Association is a Boise, Idaho-based not-for-profit corporation formed to promote packing with packgoats. In the U.S., goats bred for packing are usually tall and lean; belonging to one of the larger dairy goat breeds such as Alpine, Toggenburg, Saanen, Lamancha, Oberhasli or a crossbreed thereof. However, any type of goat can be trained to pack. Craftspeople and enthusiasts in the U.S design and build specialized goat packing equipment, publish newsletters and raise pack goats for personal use and sale. Goat packing is popular with both young families, and older individuals who want to be able to go into the wilderness and need help carrying all their gear. Some public lands require permits for the use of goats as pack animals. Concerns have been raised about the disease-spreading potential that domestic goats may pose to wild animals, such as mountain sheep and mountain goats. Accordingly, the use of pack goats is restricted in certain areas. Goat packing was popularized in the U.S. in the 1980s and 1990s by John Mionczynski of Atlantic City, Wyoming. He developed a herd of large mixed-breed goats and used them as early as the 1970s to pack supplies for scientists working in the mountains and later to carry food and gear for tourists on hiking trips. He designed and built customized pack saddles and saddlebags and, with illustrator Hannah Hinchman, published a book, The Pack Goat, in 1992.

It is a controversial treatise on the nature and theory of war in the thermonuclear weapon age. In it, Kahn addresses the strategic doctrines of nuclear war and its effect on the international balance of power. Kahn introduced the Doomsday Machine as a rhetorical device to show the limits of John von Neumann's strategy of mutual assured destruction or MAD. The book helped popularize the term megadeath, which Kahn coined in 1953. Kahn's stated purpose in writing the book was \\"avoiding disaster and buying time, without specifying the use of this time.\\" The title of the book was inspired by the classic volume On War, by Carl von Clausewitz. Widely read on both sides of the Iron Curtain‚Äîthe book sold 30,000 copies in hardcover‚Äîit is noteworthy for its views on the lack of credibility of a purely thermonuclear deterrent and how a country could \\"win\\" a nuclear war. Reception Of the book, Hubert H. Humphrey said: \\"New thoughts, particularly those which contradict current assumptions, are always painful for the human mind to contemplate. On Thermonuclear War is filled with such thoughts.\\" In popular culture Lines from the character General Buck Turgidson in Stanley Kubrick's 1964 film Dr. Strangelove directly mimic passages from this book, such as Turgidson's phrase \\"two admittedly regrettable, but nevertheless, distinguishable post-war environments\\" which reflects a chart from this book labeled \\"Tragic but Distinguishable Postwar States\\" (also discussed in the related article Megadeath). Indeed, the folder that General Turgidson holds while reading a report on projected nuclear war casualties is titled \\"Global Targets in Megadeaths\\".

It was produced by Southern Star Group and was based on a set of reading books created from 1981 that follow the adventures of a group of Australian bush animals. Prior to the television series, the original Kangaroo Creek Gang Cassette Tapes for the read-along books were recorded in the early 1980's in Perth, Western Australia and were voiced by Gregory Ker amongst others. Ker voiced the characters of Kevin Kangaroo, Wal Wombat, Tiddles Tiger Snake, Ranger West and also voiced the narrator for some of the read-along books. Helen Matthews, a well-known jazz singer, was also present for the cassette tape recordings and recorded the songs that were on the tapes. History Kangaroo Creek Gang began as a series of books, extending to 40 titles with over one million copies sold around Australia.http://www.kcg.com.au/history.php Kangaroo Creek Gang History A comic strip was developed for the children's pages in News Limited‚Äôs Sunday newspapers in most states of Australia. The gang featured in a series of Multi Media Packages distributed to primary schools and were also involved with in- flight children‚Äôs activity packages for Australian Airlines and Ansett. In 1990-91 the Kangaroo Creek Gang starred in a TV commercial for the State Bank of South Australia now known as Bank SA. The jingle was \\"saving makes sense is what we say\\". One of the characters, Kenny Kidna, had his own 30 second 'Goodnight girls and boys' segment at 7.30pm every night in Perth, Western Australia on television channel \\"NEW-10\\". The animated series was first broadcast on television in April 2002 on the Nine Network and aired on Starz Kids & Family for some time.

He studied astronomy with Tang Du, the I Ching under Yang He, and Daoism under Master Huang. He held the position of Court Astrologer (Â§™Âè≤‰ª§) between 140-110 BC. While Sima Tan had begun the Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji), he died before it was finished. It was left to his son, Sima Qian, to complete. The year of Sima Tan's death is the year of the great imperial sacrifice fengshan :zh:Â∞ÅÁ¶Ö by Han Wudi, for which the emperor appointed the fangshi, leaving Sima behind and thus probably causing him much frustration. An essay by him has survived within the Records of the Grand Historian. In this essay, Sima Tan speaks of six philosophical lineages or \\"schools\\" (ÂÆ∂ jiƒÅ): Confucianism (ÂÑíÂÆ∂ R√∫ jiƒÅ), Daoism (ÈÅìÂÆ∂ D√†o jiƒÅ), Legalism (Ê≥ïÂÆ∂ F«é jiƒÅ), Mohism (Â¢®ÂÆ∂ M√≤ jiƒÅ), School of Names (ÂêçÂÆ∂ M√≠ng jiƒÅ), and School of Naturalists (Èô∞ÈôΩÂÆ∂/Èò¥Èò≥ÂÆ∂ Yƒ´ny√°ng jiƒÅ) ‚Äì the central figure of this last \\"school\\" being Zou Yan.

Email archiving solutions capture email content either directly from the email application itself or during transport. The messages are typically then stored on magnetic disk storage and indexed to simplify future searches. In addition to simply accumulating email messages, these applications index and provide quick, searchable access to archived messages independent of the users of the system using a couple of different technical methods of implementation. The reasons a company may opt to implement an email archiving solution include protection of mission critical data, to meet retention and supervision requirements of applicable regulations, and for e-discovery purposes. It is predicted that the email archiving market will grow from nearly $2.1 billion in 2009 to over $5.1 billion in 2013. The Radicati Group, Inc. Releases \\"E-Mail Archiving Market, 2009-2013\\" Study Definition Email archiving is an automated process for preserving and protecting all inbound and outbound email messages (as well as attachments and metadata) so they can be accessed at a later date should the need arise. The benefits of email archiving include the recovery of lost or accidentally deleted emails, accelerated audit response, preservation of the intellectual property contained in business email and its attachments and \\"eDiscovery\\" in the case of litigation or internal investigations (what happened when, who said what). Overview Email Archiving is the process of capturing, preserving, and making easily searchable all email traffic to and from a given individual, organization, or service. Email archiving solutions capture email content either directly from the email server itself (journaling) or during message transit. The email archive can then be stored on magnetic tape, disk arrays, or now more often than not, in the cloud. Regardless of the location of the email archive, it gets indexed in order to speed future searches, and most archive vendors provide a search UI to simplify query construction. In addition to email, attachments and associated metadata, some email archiving applications can also archive additional aspects of a mailbox including public folders, .pst files, calendars, contacts, notes, instant messages and context. Objectives There are many motivations for enterprises or end-users to invest in an Email Archiving solution, including: * Data Preservation * Protection of Intellectual Property * Regulatory compliance * Litigation and Legal Discovery * Email Backup and Disaster Recovery * Messaging System & Storage Optimization * Monitoring of Internal & External Email Content * Records Management (Email Retention Policies) * Business & Email Continuity =Regulatory compliance= As enterprises of all sizes grow more reliant on email, the business value of that content is also growing. To protect this increasingly valuable information (intellectual property), numerous standards and regulations have been enacted to require records protection and retention as well as timely response to legal (discovery) and information (FOIA) requests. Modern email archiving solutions allow companies to meet regulatory requirements or corporate policies by securing and preserving data and providing flexible data management policies to enable authorized users to enact 'legal holds', set retention and purge policies, or conduct searches across multiple mailboxes to complete various inquiries. Some of the primary compliance requirements driving the need for secure email archiving are (alphabetically): Canada * Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) 29.7 * Mutual Fund Dealers Association (MFDA) * PIPEDA Germany * GoBD Principles of data access and of digital documents (GDPdU) Switzerland * Schweizerisches Obligationenrecht, article 962 United Kingdom * British Standards Institution - BS 4783, BS 7799/ISO 17799, BS ISO 15489-1, BSI DISC PD 0008, BSI DISC PD0010, BSI DISC PD0012 * Data Protection Act 1998 * Freedom of Information Act 2000 United States * FDA Title 21 CFR Part 11 * Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) * Freedom of Information Act * Gramm-Leach- Bliley Act * [HFTA] (Hedge Fund Transparency Act) * HIPAA * Investment Advisors Act * FINRA Rule 3110 and NYSE Rule 440 * Sarbanes-Oxley * California Senate Bill 1386 (2002) (Only in California) * Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 17a-4 and SEC Rule 17a-3 * Patriot Act Note, that many of the compliance regulations require the preservation of \\"electronic business communications\\" which consist of not only email, but may include instant messaging, file attachments, Bloomberg Messaging, Reuters Messaging, PIN-to- PIN and SMS text messages, VoIP and other electronic messaging communications used in business. =Litigation and legal discovery= For legal discovery, email archiving solutions will lower the overall risk of spoliation and greatly speed up electronic discovery. This is because messages are indexed, audit trails are provided, messages are deduplicated, and legal hold/preservation can be applied.The Sedona Canada Principles: Addressing Electronic Discovery, 2008 For litigation support, email can be retrieved quickly and a history of the email exists to prove its authenticity for chain of custody. For compliance support, email records are stored in the archive according to administrator defined retention policies. When retention periods expire, email is automatically deleted by the archiving application. In order to be compliant, an organization can intentionally destroy email messages, so long as (1) the destruction is done pursuant to a stated company policy and (2) the destruction stops immediately if an incident occurs which could give rise to a lawsuit. If an organization has multiple separate applications, for example for e-discovery, records information management, and email archiving, each application may have a separate database and it becomes difficult to de- duplicate messages and ensure that a single retention policy is being applied. From a legal point of view, this is important because once retention periods have expired the message should be purged from the archive.http://www.usdatavault.com/library/email_archiving_best_practices.pdf Messages that are not purged are still discoverable, should litigation arise at a later date. As such, without a unified archive it is difficult to ensure one single retention policy. This problem is magnified for large organizations that manage tens of millions of emails per day. Without email archiving, email likely exists on some combination of backup tapes and on end users‚Äô local workstations. If a specific email needs to be found for an internal investigation or in response to litigation, it can take weeks to find and costs a great deal. With today‚Äôs legal discovery rules (see FRCP: https://web.archive.org/web/20141021110256/http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/RulesAndPolicies/rules/EDiscovery_w_Notes.pdf) and compliance legislations, it has become necessary for IT departments to centrally manage and archive their organization‚Äôs email, so email can be searched and found in minutes; not days or weeks. =Email backup and disaster recovery= Email is the lifeblood of many modern businesses, and enterprises today depend more on reliable email service. Virtually all enterprises implement a messaging infrastructure to connect workers and enable business processes. In the e-commerce arena, employees may require access to email to close sales and manage accounts. These employees, plus many others, may choose to keep their emails indefinitely, but some organizations may mandate that emails more than 90 days old be deleted. Setting these kinds of retention policies deserves careful consideration as a single email could help a company win a lawsuit or avoid litigation altogether. Email archiving can also be used for business continuity at the individual employee level. When one employee quits, his/her replacement can be given access to the departed employee's archived messages in order to preserve correspondence records, and enable accelerated on-boarding. As part of a comprehensive disaster recovery plan, an email archive can be instrumental in an organization's effort to \\"get back to business\\". An offsite, online archive means that secondary facilities can spin up messaging servers and quickly get access to the last mails sent/received as well as all historical messaging data. Offsite archives can take the form of disk farms (SANs) in distant DR facilities or email archives stored in public/private cloud environments. Although email archiving products do capture and copy all messages, they are not mirrored copies of the messaging server itself, and therefore cannot help recreate user accounts/groups in the event of a disaster. =Messaging system & storage optimization= Every email message takes up space on an email system's hard drive or some other permanent storage device (e.g. Network Attached Storage, Storage Area Network, etc.). As the number of these messages increase, simple operations such as retrieving, searching, indexing, backup, etc. utilize more information system resources. At some point older data must be removed from the production email system so that they can maintain a level of performance for their primary use, exchange of email messages. Email archiving solutions improve email server performance and storage efficiency by removing email and attachments from the messaging server based on administrator defined policies. Archived email and attachments remain accessible to end users via the existing email client applications.

Her mother took her on weekly visits to the Art Institute of Chicago, her favorite works in the collection being those by Rembrandt, Edward Hopper, and the Thorne miniature rooms. She also spent a lot of time copying her Brenda Starr and Dick Tracy comic books. At the age of eight, Weber's family relocated to Southern California in an effort to treat her severe allergies. The museum scene there was not as robust as in Chicago, but she found plenty to support her passion for art. She would ride her bicycle to Frank Perls' gallery for critiques on her own artwork. She was exposed to the work of modern masters Matisse, Rodin, and Degas. Her high school dissertation looked at the seemingly disparate work of Edward Hopper and Jackson Pollock. Receiving a full tuition, she attended Scripps College in Claremont, California. Briefly, Weber attended the Aspen Design Conference, which was deeply influential to her developing artistic style, introducing a graphic and bold aesthetic. She went on to study at UCLA, with William Brice, Frederick S. Wight, and Stanton MacDonald-Wright. She received a BA in 1954 and an MA in 1955. After school she shared a studio with Craig Kauffman and Walter Hopps and the three of them became engaged with images of New York School abstraction. Career In 1956, Weber's work Observation of Sound, a charcoal work of the previous year, was selected from 5,000 entries by curator William S. Lieberman for inclusion in the Museum of Modern Art's show Recent Drawings USA. She showed under her unmarried name, Feinberg. In light of this success, Weber moved to New York to work and to secure a gallery affiliation. Sam Hunter, then curator at MoMA, arranged for her to meet art historian H. W. Janson, who admired Weber's work but stated that he did not include women painters in his books.\\"Idelle Weber: Chronology,\\" Artist Works Catalogue, artnet. Charles Allen, owner of the Allen Gallery, similarly indicated that he did not show women artists. Weber attended an illustration and design class taught by Alexander Liberman at the School of Visual Arts, but when she asked Robert Motherwell if she could audit his class at Hunter College, he responded that married women with children were not permitted to audit classes because they would not continue painting. Weber had married earlier that year. In 1958, her son was born, followed by a daughter in 1964, yet she continued painting. She attended classes at the Brooklyn Museum and studied under Theodoros Stamos at the Art Students League, rented a studio in Brooklyn Heights, and showed her work in several group exhibitions. Finally, Weber signed with Bertha Schaefer Gallery in 1962. Her first solo show was there in January 1963 and featured her silhouette paintings. The Albright-Knox Gallery purchased Reflection (1962) from that show. She had two solo exhibitions at Bertha Schaefer Gallery. (Weber would be represented later by a string of galleries, including Hundred Acres, OK Harris, Schmidt-Bingham, and Jean Albano.) It was also around this time that she came to know Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Jasper Johns, James Rosenquist, and other Pop artists through her contacts at the Castelli Gallery. She became particularly close with Yayoi Kusama, Lucas Samaras, Claes Oldenburg, and Agnes Martin. During the early 1960s, Weber's work mainly consisted of silhouette paintings against brightly colored, checkerboard backgrounds. Her preferred subjects were anonymous figures engaged in everyday activities, such as a group of friends playing cards (Hearts, 1964), or business men riding escalators (Munchkins I, II, & III, 1964). Munchkins was the largest work she ever created; it was painted on three canvases butted together. She painted each canvas in a different room in her small apartment. She began making large-scale Plexiglas sculptures in 1965. Jumprope Lady was her first successful attempt at transposing her silhouette paintings into three-dimensions. In the late 1960s, Weber switched from her early Pop aesthetic to Photorealist techniques. Working from photographs and slides of New York City, she made highly detailed paintings of fruit-stands (Bluebird, 1972), trash and litter (Heineken, 1976), which would become her dominant themes over the next several years. Weber became a leading member of the Photorealist movement and formed friendships with Duane Hanson, Robert Cottingham, Richard Estes, John DeAndrea, John Salt, and Ralph Goings, among others. Weber taught graduate drawing and painting at NYU in the 1970s and would later teach art at Harvard University, the Art Barge in Amagansett, NY and the Victorian College of the Arts in Melbourne, Australia, where she was also artist-in-residence. While teaching at Harvard in the 1990s, Weber began working in monotypes and created a series of small black and white works inspired by television coverage of the Gulf War. Moving from small to large scale, the experience working in monotype resulted in a dramatic change in her painting style. A severe allergy to most solvents forced her to stop working with oil paint in 1995. In 2000, she began working in collage, culminating in a major installation, Head Room, at the Contemporary Gallery at the Nassau County Museum of Art in Roslyn, NY. Weber continued to live and work in New York City. She died in Los Angeles on March 23, 2020 at the age of 88. Acquisition of Munchkin I, II, III In 2013, the Chrysler Museum of Art acquired her painting, Munchkins, I, II, & III (1964), showing silhouetted business men riding the escalators of the PanAm Building, which had been completed in New York the year before. Online art publication Blouin ArtInfo announced the acquisition with the headline, \\"Chrysler Museum Acquires Original \\"Mad Men\\" Painting by Neglected Pop Artist Idelle Weber\\". The story also reported that the work was one of three by Weber acquired by the museum at that time. The other two paintings, High Ceiling‚ÄîYou Won‚Äôt Get This and Mr. Chrysler also reference the gender stereotypes of the American workplace in the 1960s. The titular Mr. Chrysler made the work all the more appropriate for that museum's collection. The purchase occurred at a time that Weber was resurfacing with renewed critical interest.

Zhu Shugui (1617 - 21 July 1683), courtesy name Tianqiu and art name Yiyuanzi, formally known as the Prince of Ningjing, was a Ming dynasty prince and the last of the pretenders to the Ming throne after the fall of the Ming Empire in 1644. He committed suicide when forces of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty conquered the Southern Ming dynasty's Kingdom of Tungning in Taiwan, where he took shelter after mainland China fell under Qing control. He was a ninth- generation descendant of Zhu Yuanzhang (the Hongwu Emperor), the founder of the Ming dynasty, via the line of Zhu Yuanzhang's 15th son, Zhu Zhi (the Prince of Liao). Early career Zhu Shugui was styled the general of Fu while living in Jingzhou. He was later granted the title prince of Changyang during the Regency of the Prince of Lu near the end of the Ming dynasty. In 1642, after the rebel leader Zhang Xianzhong captured Jingzhou, he followed Zhu Changrun, the Prince of Hui, to Nanjing. In 1644, the Chongzhen Emperor, the last emperor of the Ming dynasty, committed suicide in Beijing, and China fell into chaos. But Zhu Shugui, living in Nanjing under the auspices of the Prince of Fu, continued to support the legitimacy of the Ming dynasty. Support of anti-Qing forces By 1647, the Manchus had occupied most Chinese territory and founded the Qing Dynasty. Zhu Youlang, the Prince of Gui, who had proclaimed himself heir to the Ming throne, was alone among the many Ming princes in recognizing the legitimacy of the Kingdom of Tungning that Koxinga had founded in Taiwan. In 1648, Zhu Youlang sent Zhu Shugui to serve as regent for Koxinga's troops, changing his title to Prince of Ningjing. He was stationed in Fujian Province. As a representative of the Ming royal house, he was used by Koxinga as a rallying point to regroup the anti-Qing forces. Relocation to Taiwan Koxinga died in 1663, whereupon his son Zheng Jing succeeded him. In 1664, in support of the legitimacy of the Ming Dynasty, Zheng Jing invited the Prince of Ningjing to Taiwan. He built a residential mansion for the Prince in the district of Xidingfang, adjacent to Fort Provintia in the city of (now Tainan), and provided him with a yearly stipend. Taiwan was newly settled territory, boasting fertile lands, and Zhu cleared dozens of hectares of land at Zhuhu Village, Wannian Prefecture (modern-day Lujhu District, Kaohsiung) for farming. Another Ming dynasty Prince accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan, Prince , son of Zhu Yihai. Zheng Jing died in 1681, and his son Zheng Keshuang took his place. Final days In 1683 the Qing general Shi Lang took the strategically important Pescadores, after which Zheng Keshuang and the House of Zheng surrendered to the Qing. On the 26th day of the 6th moon of the Chinese lunar calendar (July 20 in the Gregorian calendar), Zhu Shugui, seeing no hope for the restoration of his dynasty, decided to lay down his life for his country. He summoned his concubines and said: \\"I live abroad with disfavor and strife, longing to spend the hereafter with my royal forefathers in the underworld. Now all is lost, and the day of my death is set. You are young and should make your own plans.\\" The five concubines, who had been by his side since the death of his wife Lady Luo, wept, saying to him: \\"As the Prince can keep his integrity thus, so would we rather give our lives willingly. If the Prince lives, we all live; if the Prince dies, we all die. We ask that you first grant us a measure of silken cord, that we may follow you in death.\\" Then, one after the other, they hanged themselves in the central hall. The next day, Zhu interred his concubines, in coffins, at Kuidoushan (Cassia Bud Hill), a hillside outside the south gate of the city (the current location of the Temple of the Five Concubines). Before his death, Zhu wrote on the wall: \\"When brigands took Jingzhou in 1642, I brought my household southward; in 1644, I took refuge in Fujian. For the sake of the hairs on my head and to preserve the integrity of my humble body, I have lingered abroad for more than 40 years; now I am 66 years old. In this time of adversity I shall die a whole man. I shall not forsake my emperors; I shall not forsake my parents. My life and work are done, without disgrace or shame.\\" The next day, he donned the crown and dragon robes, fastened a jade belt, and received the Imperial seal. The Prince sent a letter under seal to Zheng Keshuang, who then led his officials to the Prince, lamenting their separation. The Prince made obeisance to heaven, earth and ancestors. The people, young and old, paid their respects, and the Prince paid his respects in return. Then on the back of an inkstone he inscribed his death poem, which read: \\"I take refuge abroad from calamity, all for the sake of a few strands of hair. Now all is done; I shall no longer be in exile.\\" Two of his attendants also died by his side. The other Ming Princes on Taiwan such as Zhu H√≥nghu√°n Êú±ÂºòÊ°ì, (son of Zhu Yihai) chose not to commit suicide and surrendered, and their lives were spared by the Qing and they were instead sent into exile into various places on mainland China.Manthorpe 2008, p. 108. After the surrender of the Kingdom of Tungning, the Qing sent the 17 Ming princes still living on Taiwan back to mainland China where they spent the rest of their lives.Manthorpe 2008, p. 108. Burial Zhu Shugui was 66 years old (by Chinese reckoning; 65 by Western standards) at the time of his suicide. Moved by loyalty, the townsfolk interred him together with his primary wife Lady Luo in what is now Hunei Township. At the time there was no marking on the tomb, and over 100 decoy tombs were built to confound the Qing army‚Äôs searches. The tomb, located in Hunei District, Kaohsiung City, was discovered in 1937. At the time of discovery the casket was empty, and the artifacts in the tomb fell into the hands of the Japanese. Although the tomb was empty, the villagers built a square concrete wall around the tomb site to demarcate it. After World War II, the residents of Zhuhu and Hunei funded the tomb's rebuilding, and the decoy tombs were dismantled and assembled into a large tomb. The tomb site you can see today is a reconstruction done by the Kaohsiung County (now part of Kaohsiung City) government in 1977, and in 1988 it was designated a third class historic site. Character History records Zhu Shugui as being stately in appearance, handsomely whiskered and grand of voice, an outstanding calligrapher, fond of wearing a sword, a man of great actions but few words, brave but not arrogant, and respected by generals and foot-soldiers alike. Before his death, Zhu burned the contract he had with tenant farmers, bequeathing all of the farmland in Lujhu Township to them. It was after this act that he calmly ended his life, hanging himself from a roof beam. Nowadays there is a temple dedicated to the Prince in Lujhu Township. Inside the temple is written Zhu's death poem.

After Clark went back to the United States, the Kaitaku-shi began beet production in Nanae Village, where is currently a part of Hakodate. This was the first beet cultivation in Hokkaid≈ç.Agriculture & Livestock Industries Corporation In 1878, the Kaitaku-shi delegated beet cultivation to the Sapporo Agricultural College, the predecessor of the Hokkaid≈ç University, and a Monbetsu Sugar Factory was built in 1879, where currently Date is located. The sugar factory was disposed to the private, and in 1888, the Sapporo Sugar Company was established with a sugar manufacturing factory in Naebo Village, which would have been Naebo area in Higashi-ku, Sapporo. The company was established as a manufacturer of beet sugar, and asked foreign engineers for advice. The factory building of the Sapporo Sugar Company later became the Sapporo Beer Museum and the Sapporo Beer Garden. The construction of the building was supervised by the government of Hokkaid≈ç, and a Germany-based company the Sangerhausen. While the sugar manufacturing building was constructed, the Kaitaku-shi Brewery was established on September 23, 1876 in the place where now the Sapporo Factory is located. It was built by the government official Murahashi Hisanari. The chief engineer of the brewery was Seibei Nakagawa, who learned brewing technique in Germany. The inauguration was held at the brewery, and beer barrels were piled up in front of the building. These barrels were restored, and currently located in the area of the Sapporo Beer Museum. The Kaitaku-shi Brewery was disposed, and the Sapporo Beer Company was established in December 1887, which later became the Sapporo Brewery. Due to the popularization of Taiwanese sugar manufacturers after the end of First Sino-Japanese War in 1895, Japanese sugar manufacture declined, causing liquidation of the beet manufacturing factory run by the Sapporo Sugar Company. In 1903, the Sapporo Beer Company purchased and remodeled the factory to use as a brewery. The factory was operated until 1965, and the Kaitaku-shi Beer Memorial Hall was constructed at the third floor of the building in 1967, which exhibited a number of historical records, tools, and documents practically used in the factory. After the renovation of the building, the Sapporo Beer Museum was officially opened to the public in July 1987. After the function of the factory as a brewery transferred to Eniwa, the building was renovated again and renewedly opened in December 2004. In 1996, the Agency for Cultural Affairs proposed to register the Sapporo Beer Museum as one of the Important Cultural Properties of Japan. The museum side, however, declined the proposal. This was mainly because if it was registered, the permission of the government would be required to remodel the building each time, which was thought to be inconvenient by the museum.Yomiuri Online , January 7, 2003. The museum was registered as one of the Hokkaid≈ç Heritage sites on October 22, 2004.  Overview  Yebisu beer tasting set of dark and light lagers, hops beer and ale, at the Beer Museum Yebisu The Sapporo Beer Museum has three floors, and is free to enter. A museum tour is available. The panels displaying the history of people involved in beer industry and the Sapporo Brewery Inc. are exhibited. Other exhibited items include beer bottles, signs, posters, miniatures of the building, and instruments for brewing beer. Some of them were actually used in the brewery before World War II. Since some products of the DaiNippon Beer Company, a predecessor of the Sapporo Brewery, were also housed in the museum, materials related to the Yebisu Beer are exhibited as well as the Sapporo Beer ones. A museum bar is located on the second floor, and visitors can try alcohol products of the Sapporo Beer. The first floor has a restaurant called \\"Star Hall\\", and a museum shop. The Sapporo Garden Park also houses the Ario Sapporo, a shopping mall, and the Sapporo Beer Garden, which is connected to the museum.

Early years  Schou was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 24 November 1918. His father was a psychiatrist and medical director of a large mental hospital. Schou chose to study medicine with a specific view to doing research on manic-depressive illness (now more commonly referred to as bipolar disorder). He graduated with a degree in medicine from the University of Copenhagen in 1944. After his training in clinical psychiatry he also studied experimental biology.  Research  Schou's research interests focused on therapeutic uses of lithium for patients with mood disorders. The psychopharmacological era began in earnest in 1949, with an article published by John Cade about the observed antimanic action of lithium in Australia. Intrigued by these findings Schou, who in the meantime had joined the Psychiatric Research Institute of Aarhus University, confirmed these findings in a double-blind placebo-controlled study with his co-workers. During the early 1960s, G. P. Hartigan, Poul Chr. Baastrup and Schou independently made sporadic observations that were suggestive of lithium also having prophylactic properties in manic-depressive illness. Subsequently, Baastrup and Schou joined together and in a non-blind lithium trial saw their preliminary observations confirmed. They even deemed the results so significant that they concluded that ‚Äòlithium is the first drug demonstrated as a clear-cut prophylactic agent against one of the major psychoses‚Äô. However, the Schou- Baastrup prophylaxis hypothesis was met with great resistance by British psychiatry. To Aubrey Lewis and Michael Shepherd, lithium was ‚Äòdangerous nonsense‚Äô. Shepherd, seconded by Harry Blackwell, simply characterized it as ‚Äòa therapeutic myth‚Äô, which, in their opinion, was based on ‚Äòserious methodological shortcomings‚Äô and ‚Äòspurious claims‚Äô. Even terms such as unethical and unscientific were used. After consideration of the ethical aspects invoked, Schou and Baastrup undertook a double-blind trial of prospective-discontinuation design and with random allocation of manic- depressive patients (already on lithium) to lithium or placebo. It confirmed their hypothesis, published in The Lancet in 1970. He was aware of some of the limitations of lithium treatment. He welcomed the introduction of other prophylactic agents into the market. From the available observations he concluded, however, that anti-epileptics and atypical anti-psychotics act on different kinds of bipolar patients to lithium. He was an author of more than 500 publications, including texts, research papers, articles and book chapters. He was Emeritus Professor of the Psychiatric Hospital in Risskov, Denmark.  Awards and honors  Schou has published approximately 540 works on lithium and lithium therapy, and some of his awards include: * 1974‚ÄîInternational Scientific Kitty Foundation Award (shared with Cade). * 1982‚ÄîJohn Cade Memorial Award. * 1987‚ÄîAlbert Lasker Clinical Medical Research Award. * 1995‚ÄîInternational Society of Lithium Research‚Äôs Mogens Schou Prize for Lifetime Achievement. * 2000‚ÄîC.I.N.P‚Äôs Pioneers in Psychopharmacology Award. * 2001‚ÄîInternational Society For Bipolars‚Äô Mogens Schou Award For Distinguished Contributions. * 2004‚ÄîNARSAD Lifetime Achievement Award. He has received an honorary doctorate from Charles University in Prague. In recognition of his accomplishments in bipolar medicine, he was made the Honorary President of the International Society for Bipolar Disorders. At the same time, the Mogens Schou awards were created for presentation at the Society‚Äôs biennial International Conference on Bipolar Disorder.

History In 1939, after working as a Sales Engineer with Reed Roller Bit Company in Houston, Eddie Chiles founded the Western Company of North America in Fort Worth, Texas. He started the company with two trucks and three employees. Western served the petroleum industry with technical services required in the discovery and production of oil and gas. The company grew to become a major oil services firm, primarily in acidizing, fracturing, and cementing. At its peak, the Western Company had over 5,000 employees and annual worldwide revenues of over $500 million. Western also featured an innovative television campaign with commercials telling viewers \\"If you don't have an oil well, get one‚Äîyou'll love doing business with Western!\\" The Western Company also operated an offshore drilling company, run by Chiles' brother, during the 1970s. The offshore drilling company was sold to Noble Drilling in 1991. The Western Company moved from Fort Worth to Houston in 1990. The company featured an innovative oil museum open to the public on the first floor of their office building in Fort Worth, which was moved to Beaumont, Texas.

History Kur coat of arms - illustration from \\"Herby Rycerstwa Polskiego\\" Bartosz Paprocki, 1584 The Kur coat of arms and its battle cry is noted in Polish heraldry in 1496. Earlier notes confirming graphic form of the CoA but without battle cry are from year 1300.Franciszek Piekosi≈Ñski, Heraldyka polska wiek√≥w ≈õrednich, Krak√≥w 1899 The notes of 1496Piotr Na≈Çƒôcz-Ma≈Çachowski, Zbi√≥r Nazwisk Szlachty, Lublin 1805, p.667 tells about the King John I Albert that created this coat of arms for the Kur family. The date is close to the Piotrk√≥w privilege from 1493 and the confirmation of the ruling house by Konrad III Rudy, duke of Masovia. The Piotrk√≥w privilege made the Masovian nobility equal to Polish in rights which explain that the documents regarding the Clan of Kur is not act of nobility but act of equal rights. Before adding Kur coat of arms to Polish heraldry 1496, the name was known as Kokoty and is noted in court documents referring to Miko≈Çaj Kiczka in 1426.Franciszek Piekosi≈Ñski, Heraldyka polska wiek√≥w ≈õrednich, Krak√≥w 1899 Late appearance of the Kur coat of arms in Polish heraldry is explained by the tradition in Masovia that formed coat of arms in European style later than in other parts of Poland. In Europe, the symbol of the Kur coat of arms is well known from ancient years, it origin from Italy where it can be found under the name Gallohttp://www.heraldica.org name=Gallo and later made its way through France, Spain, Netherlands, Scotland and Poland. = Legend of the CoA = The legend tells that the Kur coat of arms have been given to the knight for service and for saving King's camp during military campaign.

It uses similar imagery to Sonnet 116 and expands on the challenge in the closing couplet (\\"If this be error and upon me proved, / I never writ, nor no man ever loved\\"). Using legally resonant metaphors (\\"accuse\\", \\"bonds\\", \\"proof\\", \\"appeal\\", \\"prove\\"), the poet defends himself against accusations of ingratitude and infidelity by saying that he was merely testing (or proving) the constancy of those same things in his friend. Structure Sonnet 117 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet. The English sonnet has three quatrains, followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the typical rhyme scheme of the form ABAB CDCD EFEF GG and is composed in iambic pentameter, a type of poetic metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The 3rd line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / Forgot upon your dearest love to call, (117.3) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus.

The base also houses Camp Williams, which is supported by the Wisconsin Army National Guard. History =Early history= The origin of the Volk Field Combat Readiness Training Center (CRTC) can be traced back to 1888 when the state adjutant general, General Chandler Chapman, purchased a site for a rifle range and offered it to the state for a camp. In 1889 the state legislature authorized the governor to purchase land near the site for a permanent training site to include a dedicated pistol, rifle, and artillery training range for the Wisconsin National Guard. By 1903 the camp had expanded to more than and was used for training by the then reorganized National Guard. In 1917 the site served as a major mobilization and training post for the 32nd Infantry Division which was made up almost exclusively of the Wisconsin and Michigan National Guard prior to its shipping to France as part of World War I. The site was named Camp Williams in 1927 in honor of Lieutenant Colonel Charles R. Williams, the chief quartermaster of the post from 1917 until his death in 1926. Camp Williams grew slowly following the First World War, but with the development of the airplane, the first hard- surface runways were constructed in 1935 and 1936.Robert Hoagenson. The History of Camp Douglas, Wisconsin and Camp Williams-Volk Field. 1966. During World War II Camp Williams and Volk served as a mobilization and training station for elements of the 32nd Infantry Division which was made up almost exclusively of the Wisconsin and Michigan National Guard. In 1954 the federal government leased the field from the state of Wisconsin for use as a permanent field training site. That same year work began on the air-to-ground gunnery range near Finley, Wisconsin. In 1957, the Wisconsin legislature officially designated the facility a permanent field training site and named it in memory of 1st Lieutenant Jerome A. Volk, the first Wisconsin Air National Guard pilot killed in combat in the Korean War. A small graveyard near the front gate contains three burial plots, those of Lt. Col. Charles R. Williams, Camp Williams' namesake; his son, Private Robert W. Williams, who died in France during World War I; and Brigadier General Hugh M. Simonson, Adjutant General of the Wisconsin National Guard from 1977 until 1979. It also contains a memorial marker for Lt. Jerome Volk, for whom the installation was named, as his body was never recovered after being shot down over North Korea in 1951. =False alarm incident= During the Cuban Missile Crisis a majority of B-47 bombers with capability to drop nuclear payloads were \\"dispersed\\" to Volk, among other bases, to make it harder for the Soviets to threaten USAF assets.Doomsday: On The Brink. A two-part 1997 documentary, originally aired on the Learning Channel. http://www.56.com/u59/v_NDgyMDgzODQ.html from 26:21 to 28:59. At around midnight on 25 October 1962, a guard at the Duluth Sector Direction Center saw a figure climbing the security fence. He shot at it, and activated the \\"sabotage alarm.\\" This automatically set off sabotage alarms at all bases in the area. At Volk Field, the alarm was incorrectly wired, and the Klaxon sounded, which ordered nuclear armed F-106A interceptors to take off. The interceptor crews had not been notified that the Strategic Air Command had increased its patrols of nuclear-armed bombers, some of which were airborne near Volk, threatening the possibility of nuclear friendly fire. Immediate communication with Duluth showed there was an error. By this time aircraft were starting down the runway and Volk was too small for a control tower (its aircraft were dispatched from Duluth away). A truck raced from the command center and successfully signaled the aircraft to stop. The intruder was later identified as a black bear, not the Soviet saboteurs in advance of a nuclear attack the sentry was expecting. =Recent history= In 1989 the site was re- designated a Combat Readiness Training Center (CRTC). During the 1990 Persian Gulf War, Volk Field was the primary point of embarkation for soldiers and equipment from nearby Fort McCoy, Wisconsin. The 128th Air Control Squadron, Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation system (ACMI), Air Base Operability and Ability to Survive and Operate (ATSO) training missions were added in 1991. Since 2006 Volk Field, along with Fort McCoy, has served as the primary location for Patriot Warrior the largest annual training exercise for Air Force Reserve Command. Facilities Volk Field has one asphalt and concrete paved runway (9/27) measuring 9,000 x 150 ft (2,743 x 46 m). The Runway's Edge is the installation's all ranks club and provides hot food and drinks. The Wisconsin National Guard Museum is located at Volk Field. It contains aircraft, helicopters, artillery, and armored vehicles used by the Wisconsin National Guard over its existence.

It was also available to area subscribers of Charter Cable on channel 6. The station's programming at the time was similar to a public-access television cable TV channel, consisting primarily of news, public affairs and travel programs produced by local residents of the Big Bear Valley.

He was subsequently investigated by French anti-terrorist authorities as the prime suspect in the blast. An official enquiry later determined the blast was accidental, and not a result of Mr. Jandoubi's actions. Early life Jandoubi had been known to French police as the suspected ringleader of a gang trafficking stolen cars between France and Germany. He became an active member of a mosque in the Toulouse suburbs where he was \\"initiated to fundamentalism\\". He was known by locals and police to be part of a gang seen celebrating the September 11 terror attacks, however, at the time of his death his name wasn't included on lists of fundamental terrorist suspects maintained by Interpol, the French intelligence service or the counter-espionage agency DST. Jandoubi was hired to unload ammonium nitrate at the AZF plant by a subcontractor five days before the explosion. He was already known to local police for possible Islamic fundamentalist sympathies and was involved in several angry altercations before the blast with co-workers who were displaying the U.S. flag in sympathy with victims of the September 11 attacks. Blast At 10:17 on 21 September 2001, ten days after the attacks in the United States, a massive explosion destroyed the entire AZF facility in Toulouse, killing 29 people, injured over 3000 people and damaged 10,000 buildings, including nearby schools, hospitals, businesses and 600 homes. The explosion measured 3.5 on the Richter scale and windows were blown out over five kilometres away from the epicenter. 1,400 families were left homeless. The blast released an ammonia cloud that eventually settled on nearby suburbs sending many more to hospital. On the day of the blast, Jandoubi was working in hangar 10, 30 metres from hangar 221 whose stock of 200-300 tonnes of ammonium nitrate exploded. Investigation French Police and investigators were initially intrigued by the fact that Jandoubi was found with a mobile phone fitted with a stolen SIM card. Media interest was further aroused by the results of his autopsy, which was carried out by a doctor who had worked in the Middle East for the international aid organisation M√©decins du Monde. The medical examiner noted that Jandoubi was wearing two pairs of trousers and four pairs of underpants, which reminded her \\"of the apparel worn by some Islamic militants going into battle or on suicide missions\\". Media reports in France heavily reported the fact he was dressed in several layers of garments, and described how they were arranged \\"in the manner of kamikaze fundamentalists.\\" The chief prosecutor, Michel Breard, barred police and investigators from searching Jandoubi's apartment for five days after the explosion. When the apartment was finally entered, it was found cleaned out of his clothes, personal effects and photos. His girlfriend living in the apartment stated she had destroyed his belongings in order to better overcome the tragedy. Ten seconds before the major explosion, witnesses report a primary explosion and many personnel electrocutions in the AZF facility. Jandoubi's body was found deeply burnt but not his clothes. Furthermore, the colour of his eyes was blue instead of their natural black colour. An alternative hypothesis concerning Jandoubi's death could be electrocution and not a suicide attack. The current flowing through his body but not through his clothes burnt him internally and the blue colour of his eyes could be an electric cataract.Anti-Terror probe into French blast CNN Oct 4 2001Explosion in France may have been Terrorism The Michigan Daily Oct 5 2001Terrorism link to French explosion The Guardian Oct 5 2001Paul Seabright What Explosion?

He had no formal college degree. He published his first research papers in 1932, on life events in the body of plants. Subsequently, he also published work on bioluminescence and other botany topics, but gradually his interests shifted to entomology. He became an expert photographer, and photographed many varieties of ants, spiders, small bats and tadpoles. In total, he published 22 papers in English, including journals such as the Natural History of the American Museum of Natural History. Science popularization In 1948 he worked with Satyendra Nath Bose (of Bose‚ÄìEinstein statistics fame) to establish the Bangiya Bijnan Parishad (Bengal Science Council), a society for science research. He won the Ananda Puraskar for Bengali literature in 1968, and the highest award for Bengali literature, the Rabindra Puraskar, in 1975. In 1981, the University of Calcutta awarded him an honorary Doctor of Science degree less than three months before he died. Scientific findings In 1940, possibly before the fact had been established among naturalists, Gopal Chandra published an article in the Transactions of the Bose Institute of Calcutta, outlining how the queen in social insects such as ants or bees, produces other queens, workers or soldiers, by appropriately altering the nature of the royal jelly fed to the larvae. His observations were based on the Indian variety of ants, Occophylia. The Gopal Chandra Bhattacharya Award In 2005, the government of West Bengal instituted an award for science popularization in his name, the Gopal Chandra Bhattacharyya Smriti Puraskar.

It is a member of the Fair Youth sequence, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man. Although the relationship started exuberantly in Sonnet 18 (\\"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day\\") by now it has given way to an almost defensive tone. The poet justifies giving away or losing a notebook (\\"tables\\") given him by the youth to record shared events by saying that his memories of them are stronger. Structure Sonnet 122 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet. The English sonnet has three quatrains, followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the typical rhyme scheme of the form ABAB CDCD EFEF GG and is composed in iambic pentameter, a type of poetic metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The 1st line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain (122.1) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. Line 4 exhibits a mid-line reversal: √ó / √ó / / √ó √ó / √ó / Beyond all date; even to eternity: (122.4) Lines 3, 5, 11, and 14 all have potential initial reversals. Line 10 potentially incorporates a rightward movement of the third ictus (resulting in a four-position figure, \`√ó √ó / /\`, sometimes referred to as a minor ionic): √ó / √ó / √ó √ó / / √ó / Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score; (122.10) However, if \\"thy\\" receives emphasis, the line becomes regular again. The meter demands that line 4's \\"even\\" function as one syllable, and line 7's \\"oblivion\\" as three.

They approached Emir Rodr√≠guez Monegal, scholar of Latin American literature and friend of Borges and Neruda. The magazine was published via ILARI (Instituto Latinoamericano de Relaciones Internacionales) which was habilitated to receive the Ford funding. Monegal's only demand was to establish it in Paris, France, because, as he explained later, \\"Paris [...] has the advantage of being a great city where you can still live cheaply. Latin American writers, especially during the sixties, always made their sentimental journey to Paris, and I knew that I could always find talent just outside the door. Besides, if you publish a magazine in any Latin American city, it inevitably takes on a local air. This was just what I wanted to avoid. And the French postal service enabled us to reach the entire New World.\\"Mac Adam 1984, primary sources. =Contribution (1966‚Äì1968)= In July 1966, the first issue was published. It was a 23 cm illustrated magazine.LOC, tertiary sources. Mundo Nuevo published articles and interviews, prose, poetry, and essays, but also excerpts of unreleased texts. It helped launch the career of younger writers such as Guillermo Cabrera Infante, Severo Sarduy, Manuel Puig but also helped then-new writers such as Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, Carlos Fuentes, Mario Vargas Llosa, or Jos√© Donoso. During 1966, Mundo Nuevo prepublished two chapters of Garc√≠a M√°rquez's breakthrough novel One Hundred Years of Solitude one year before the book's release; Monegal explained, \\"I wanted to prepare the ground for the book, which came out in 1967.\\" Mundo Nuevo contributed to the 1960s publishing phenomenon dubbed \\"The Boom\\" in Latin American literature that led to many Latin American writers being published outside of their home countries and gaining critical recognition. =Opposition= Monegal directed Mundo Nuevo with full editorial control. In those times of Cold War, the magazine was attacked and boycotted from the beginning by Cuba and Latin-American Castrists or Marxists. Monegal defined himself as \\"a socialist of the English Labour Party type\\" who \\"had nothing to do with what they call socialism in the Soviet Union\\" and he refused to turn Mundo Nuevo into yet another pro-Communist or anti-Communist journal. He explained later, \\"I conceived Mundo Nuevo as an open forum and invited writers of all political persuasions to contribute to it.\\" This stand of independence also attracted the ire of the anti-Castro in exile. In 1967, a political scandal was manufactured, with a rumor alleging that Mundo Nuevo was funded by the CIA.EB, tertiary sources. In answer, Monegal published in the July 1967 issue of Mundo Nuevo \\"La CIA y los intelectuales\\" (\\"The CIA and the intellectuals\\"), an article not only debunking the rumor, but also lambasting both the Stalinists and the CIA. He expressed (translated from the Spanish) \\"the strongest condemnation\\" of the CIA's actions against intellectuals \\"who had demonstrated independence against Fascism and Stalinism\\", being \\"victim of slander of the organized reaction of the McCarthyist or Stalinist gangs\\" and of \\"the deceit\\" of \\"the CIA or other corrupters from other sides\\". Monegal 1967, primary sources. This article, and its follow-up two months later, did not amuse Monegal's backers. Escalating disagreements with the Ford Foundation and the ILARI eventually led to Monegal's resignation in July 1968. =Dissolution (1968‚Äì1971)= As Monegal explained, the magazine was moved to Argentina in Buenos Aires, \\"where it became just one more anti-Communist journal.

Performance history Leben des Orest had 13 productions by 1933, when the Nazis seized power and banned Krenek from German stages. The first postwar revival was in 1947 in Linz and performances in Frankfurt (1951), Graz (1952), D√ºsseldorf (1954) and Wiesbaden (1961) followed.Grosch: Zeitoper, Stilpluralismus und episches Theater p. 107 The 1961 Darmstadt performances were conducted by Krenek himself, but drew loud demonstrations against its supposed musical conservatism. Pierre Boulez wrote an open letter denouncing the management's actions against the disruptions as \\"organized terror\\" and the faculty of the Sommerferienkurse sided with him in calling the work a mere relic of the 1920s. A successful revival was the Portland Opera's 1975 Life of Orestes in the composer's English translation. Roles Orestes and Iphigenia, mosaic in Rome's Capitoline Museum *Agamemnon, a king in Greece (tenor) *Klyt√¶mnestra, his wife (mezzo-soprano or contralto) *Elektra, their daughter *Iphigenie, their daughter *Orest, their son (baritone) *√Ügisth, a relative (tenor) *Anastasia, the royal nurse (contralto) *√Ügisth's servant *Three Elders *A lame accordionist *Aristobulos, Chief justice in Athens *A cryer *Two street-girls *Four street singers *Shepherd *Small girl *Thoas, a northern king (bass) *Thamar, his daughter (soprano) *Crowds, warriors, guards, Athenians, judges, artists, dancers chorus Synopsis The opera opens with the chorus (hidden by a scrim) singing of the southern land of their longing. The curtain rises on a busy square in front of Agamemnon's palace. Anastasia tells the crowd of the impending war. Agamemnon enters and exhorts them in chopped phrases, but they clamour loudly for peace. \\"Go away and let me decide\\" he orders, and the street is cleared by armed guards. There's no turning back, even if his own children were to be sacrificed. This strikes √Ügisth, who has been following, as a very good idea. After all, you're a little afraid of your son anyway! He tells him that it will be easier to convince the queen if √Ügisth's name is kept out of it and the plan seems the king's own, and when Agamemnon leaves he expresses his glee at being closer to the throne. Klyt√¶mnestra's cries are heard from the palace; Agamemnon tells her that, as priest of all Greece, he is carrying out the will of the gods. Klyt√¶mnestra orders Anastasia to flee with Orest to Phokisland, and shudders as the instruments of sacrifice are brought in to the sound of trumpets. When the people are reassembled, Agamemnon announces his plan. As soon as Orest's flight is known, they shout \\"treachery\\" and begin to riot, but are again overawed when the king decides to offer Iphigenie. As he raises the axe the child disappears in thunder and darkness. As the breeze picks up, the people sing a farewell to peacetime and depart, Klyt√¶mnestra remarking that the limping accordionist who remains is a fitting emblem of the ravaged country. The chorus altos again relate how Agamemnon was rewarded, for his great faith in the gods, with a miracle, and the curtain rises on Thoas' astronomical observatory. He relates how, since he was widowed, he has sought consolation in the secrets of nature, and he senses that the moon is about to send an embodiment of the longed for southern land. Thamar stirs in her sleep and tries to call a warning, but he places her back under hypnosis. Thoas bids the approaching vision to speak, and Iphigenie calls out for her father. Both look startled and somewhat disappointed. After an interlude the chorus relates how Anastasia and Orest could go no farther when they reached Athens on the faire day, on which the curtain now rises.

The definition is also sometimes extended to include sounds made by humans in a directly biological way. For instance, music that is created by the brain waves of the composer can also be called biomusic as can music created by the human body without the use of tools or instruments that are not part of the body (singing or vocalizing is usually excluded from this definition). Biomusic can be divided into two basic categories: music that is created solely by the animal (or in some cases plant), and music which is based upon animal noises but which is arranged by a human composer. Some forms of music use recorded sounds of nature as part of the music, for example new-age music uses the nature sounds as backgrounds for various musical soundscapes, and ambient music sometimes uses nature sounds modified with reverbs and delay units to make spacey versions of the nature sounds as part of the ambience. Forms =Bird song and/or biophonies in music= The incorporation of bird song in music is one of the most widely studied forms of biomusic. Notable in this regard is the French composer Olivier Messiaen who began incorporating accurately transcribed bird songs into his music in 1952. One obstacle facing the use of bird songs in music is their complexity and usually very high register. Nevertheless, Messiaen included a variety of bird songs in many of his mature works including his Catalogue d'oiseaux (\\"Birds catalogue\\"), piano (1956‚Äì58) which incorporated songs from thirteen different birds. Also, he incorporated the themes of many birds in his orchestral piece, \\"Chronochromie\\". In Western music, recordings of bird songs have also been used in numerous works. The first one is Pines of Rome (1924) by Ottorino Respighi (the third movement includes the sound of a nightingale recorded onto a phonograph, played in the concert hall during the movement's ending. This was something that had never been done before, and created discussion). A famous one is Cantus Arcticus (1972) by the Finnish composer Einojuhani Rautavaara. Subtitled Concerto for Birds and Orchestra this piece incorporates tape recordings of birdsong recorded near the Arctic Circle and on the bogs of Liminka in northern Finland. A nightingale can be heard on Pink Floyd's \\"Cirrus Minor\\" (More, 1969) or \\"Grantchester Meadows\\" (Ummagumma, 1969), a sample of tweeting birds on Laurie Anderson's \\"O Superman\\" (1981), seagulls within concept album L'Op√©ra du pauvre (1983) by French singer-songwriter L√©o Ferr√©. The entire biophony of a soundscape can be heard on the Beaver & Krause 1968 Warner Brothers album (released in 1970), \\"In a Wild Sanctuary\\", the first album on the theme of ecology and the first album to incorporate entire natural soundscapes as components of the orchestration. This work anticipated by 44 years, the 2014 Cheltenham Music Festival (UK) premier of \\"The Great Animal Orchestra Symphony for Orchestra and Wild Soundscapes,\\" composed by Bernie Krause and Oxford (Balliol College) former composer-in-residence, Richard Blackford, performed by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales. This, too, features the first symphony based on ecological themes and the first to perform, live, with whole natural soundscapes informing the orchestral form and themes, just as biophonies and geophonies inspired music (rhythm, melody, organization of sound, timbre, and dynamic) at the dawn of cultural time. Commissioned by the Alonzo King LINES Ballet, an international corps based in San Francisco, the score for Biophony, composed by Bernie Krause and Richard Blackford, consists almost entirely of biophonies and geophonies and premiered in 2015. It has been performed worldwide, since. It is important to note that of the more than 13,100 bird species, less than 100 have been accepted into Western classical or other music genres (or 0.007%). With the exception of entire biophonies, the abstract and deconstructed selection of particular birds (and the voices of a few other non-human animals such as certain cetaceans or canids) in these genres have been largely predicated on the convenient ways in which they happen to fit the models consistent with the then-current paradigms‚Äì those considered to be \\"musical\\" at any given time.The Great Animal Orchestra: Finding the Origins of Music in the World's Wild Places, by Bernie Krause (Little Brown, 2012) =Whale song in music= Recorded whale song also frequently inspired 20th century experimental music. One example is in George Crumb‚Äôs Vox Balaenae (Voice of the Whale), a composition for electric flute, electric cello, and amplified piano.Vox Balaenae (Voice of the Whale) The official George Crumb home page (Retrieved 10 October 2007) However, as Vox Balaenae does not include actual recorded whale songs, it is not a pure biomusic composition. Another similar piece that could be considered true biomusic is And God Created Great Whales, a piece written in 1970 by American composer Alan Hovhaness. This work for orchestra and whale songs brings the recorded sounds of humpback, bowhead, and killer whales directly into the concert hall.And God Created Great Whales (1970) for Orchestra and Whale Songs Artist direct (Retrieved 10 October 2007) The song \\"Il n'y a plus rien\\", from French singer-songwriter L√©o Ferr√©'s eponymous album (1973), begins and ends with recorded whale songs mixed with a symphonic orchestra. Another piece utilizing recorded whale song is the Earth Mass (Missa Gaia) by Paul Winter (1982) which is performed at the Episcopal Church of St. John the Divine each year to celebrate the Feast of St. Francis. One of the movements uses a four note motive derived from a recorded humpback whale song that opens and closes that segment of the work. =Neurofeedback= Music created by neurofeedback relies on the brainwaves of a human subject to create music. An Electroencephalophone (a musical instrument that converts brain waves to sound) was first designed by Erkki Kurenniemi in the 1960s. American composer David Rosenboom further pioneered work with neurofeedback music as has Brazilian composer Eduardo Reck Miranda. Neurofeedback composition is still in development, and though it is widely experimented with, it is still very uncommon to see it performed. =Cybernetic biomusic= In 1975, Grateful Dead associate Ned Lagin released an album of experimental space music entitled Seastones on Round Records; he described the recording as \\"cybernetic biomusic\\", emphasizing the use of computers and synthesizers to create organic-impressionistic sounds and meditative feelings. The album was one of the first commercially released recordings to feature digital computers and the Buchla digital-polyphonic synthesizer. From 2004 to 2007, Pete Townshend collaborated with composer Lawrence Ball and programmer Dave Snowdon to set up a project called The Lifehouse Method, an Internet site where applicants could \\"sit\\" for an electronic musical portrait made up from data they entered into the website. On 23 April 2007, Ball released a double album on iTunes called Method Music - Imaginary Sitters, Imaginary Galaxies which is part of Pete Townshend's Lifehouse Method music project. =Other examples= Biomusic can take many other forms. These can include the simple amplification of animal sounds, or the creation of music through the fluctuation of electric current in plants. More unusual still is the use of animal notation: music scores created by animals, often in the form of paw prints. Biomusic can also take the form of animals trained to perform specific behaviors as part of a musical performance (birds trained to sing for instance). Music from The Body is the biomusic soundtrack album to Roy Battersby's 1970 documentary film The Body, about human biology, narrated by Vanessa Redgrave and Frank Finlay. The music was composed and performed in collaboration between Pink Floyd member Roger Waters and Ron Geesin, and uses sounds made by the human body (slaps, breathing, laughing, whispering, farts, etc.) in addition to more traditional guitar, piano and stringed instruments. The experimental ambient/noise group Tribes of Neurot released an album titled \\"Adaptation and Survival: The Insect Project\\" in 2002; a multidirectional sound experiment in which all sounds were originally produced by insects and then manipulated and synthesized. A collaboration album between Breakcore artists Venetian Snares and Hecate entitled Nymphomatriarch was composed entirely from sounds of the two performing various sexual activities together, which were distorted and time- stretched to resemble typical Breakcore samples. The Lake, by artist Julie Freeman tracked natural biological motion via electronic tagging systems, and transformed the data collected into musical composition and animation. Musicians Caninus, Hatebeak and Lil Bhttp://pitchfork.com/news/48656-lil-bs- cat-keke-the-adopted-tabby-drops-track/ have used animals as lead or backing vocalists. \\"Field recorder\\" Stuart Hyatt has used sounds created by bats which were then combined with music.

He graduated from Blackburn University (1880) and received the M. A. degree from the same institution in 1882. He conducted various zoological expeditions--in Central America for the Smithsonian Institution (1882‚Äì84), in Florida (1885), on the Saskatchewan River (1891)--and was naturalist of the Albatross Hawaiian expedition in 1902. He was professor of zoology and curator of the Museum of Natural History of the University of Iowa from 1886 to 1890 and thereafter was head of his department. Nutting's most important publications are systematic papers dealing with marine hydroids, which appeared in the reports of the United States Commission of Fisheries and elsewhere and were reprinted, especially American Hydroids (part i, 1900; part iii, 1915). In this work Nutting described 124 new species and beautifully illustrated his monograph on American hydroids. He is commemorated in the names of a number of animals, including Nutting's flycatcher Myiarchus nuttingi and the Nicaraguan seed- finch Oryzoborus nuttingi. As museum director, Nutting was successful in attracting support from donors, politicians, university students and the public. He organized and lead expeditions to exotic destinations, always bringing home specimens, photographs and stories to his supporters.  Publications  * 1900-15. The American hydroids.

The group included Balfour Gardiner, Norman O'Neill, Cyril Scott and Roger Quilter, who were all English, and Percy Grainger and Frederick Septimus Kelly, who were born in Australia but established themselves as composers in England. Although they did not study in Frankfurt all at the same time they remained close friends from their student days onwards. Knorr, though German- born, was strongly influenced by Russian music and was a believer in fostering the individuality of his pupils. The Frankfurt group were united more by their friendship and their non-conformity than by any common aim, though they did share a dislike of Beethoven, and a resistance to the musical nationalism of the self-styled English Musical Renaissance of Hubert Parry and Charles Villiers Stanford, and of the later English Pastoral School of Ralph Vaughan Williams and Gustav Holst. All of them had a predilection for the music of Frederick DeliusPayne, Anthony.

Sensibility and English Song (1985), p 107 The group was distinguished by its rebelliousness, and by studying abroad they stood apart from the conservative wider English musical establishment. Grainger described the group as Pre-Raphaelite composers, arguing that they were musically distinguished from other British composers by \\"an excessive emotionality ... particularly a tragic or sentimental or wistful or pathetic emotionality\\", reached through a focus on chords rather than musical architecture or \\"the truly English qualities of grandeur, hopefulness and glory\\". Most rebellious were Grainger and Scott, whose music often crossed the boundaries of accepted musical convention. Scott's work for a time gave up the use of bars and time signatures, while employing dissonant harmonies and highly individual orchestration..

Built from earth and concrete in the 1960s (and completed in 1968) to dam Lake Aviemore, it is one of the major dams of Meridian Energy, and is used to power a hydroelectric power plant. It is a part of the Waitaki River Hydroelectric System, a scheme which supplies 30% of New Zealand's considerable amount of hydropower. Characteristics =Composite structure= The dam is located over unequal ground underneath, due to the line of the Waitangi Fault. On the northern side in Canterbury, the dam is founded on solid rock, and consists of a -long concrete structure. On the southern side in Otago, the dam crosses the fault as a long earth dam. During the construction of the concrete section, low-heat cement was first used in a large-scale application in New Zealand, to allow quick concrete pouring without the need for cooling elements. =Hydroelectric facilities= The dam contains 4 francis turbines of each ( total), with the generators being 4 x 11 kV. The facility produces approximately of electricity per year.

Background The dispute centred on 'modernisation plans' which Royal Mail said were required to remain competitive, however the CWU believed that these might have led to around 40,000 job losses. Additionally there were disputes surrounding flexible working hours, pay rises and pensions. =Royal Mail position= Royal Mail claimed that flexibility is vital to the business, and that it was entirely reasonable for employees normally employed in one capacity to cover other roles as required to cope with variations in the work levels in each area. The company was also adamant that increased automation (and fewer employees) were necessary to bring costs under control. The unions were accused of retaining numerous Spanish practices which prevent flexible working. =CWU position= The CWU accused Royal Mail of treating its employees as slaves, and regarded a level of flexibility which would have seen employees doing different jobs on a daily basis as unacceptable. =Government position= The CWU called on the government to \\"intervene in a positive way\\". Until early October, the government maintained its stance that this was a matter for Royal Mail and the union to sort out. However, in early October Gordon Brown called on the CWU to reach an agreement on the terms offered, a move that was condemned by the TUC. =Public view= Public opinion was divided, with some strongly in support of the Postal Workers, and others supporting Royal Mail and condemning the disruption caused by the strikes. Strike dates *29 June 2007 - First strike *12‚Äì13 July 2007 - Second set of strikes *4‚Äì5 October 2007 - Business- wide CWU strike *8‚Äì9 October 2007 - Business-wide CWU strike *10‚Äì11 October 2007 - All CWU union members return to work, however wildcat strikes continue in Liverpool and London. Key events *On 7 June 2007 the union's postal members voted by 77.5% in favour of industrial action after a 2.5% pay rise coupled with ¬£350million every year for five years (totaling ¬£1.5 billion) of cuts was offered. *They took their first one-day strike on Friday 29 June 2007, and the second on 12/13 July. **The action then progressed to a series of rolling strikes designed to cause as much disruption as possible. *On 9 August strikes were called off when Royal Mail chairman Allan Leighton and CWU General Secretary Billy Hayes began secret talks. **These negotiations failed and industrial action began again at 12PM on 5 October. **This time two national strikes of 48 hours were called. **These took place on Friday 5 and Saturday 6 October, and then Monday 8 and Tuesday 9 October. **In between these dates was a Sunday so no deliveries took place between the Friday and Tuesday, but resumed on Wednesday with a large backlog of undelivered mail. *On 6 October 2007 a march of over 100 postal workers supported by local groups of TUC members, a pensioners group against Post Office closures and the local branch of the Socialist Party took place in Stoke on Trent, stretching 2 miles from Burslem to Hanley. A rally at the end featured many speakers including local CWU vice branch secretary, Mick Pender, and Socialist Party member Andy Bentley. *On 12 October, Royal Mail challenged the legality of the next phase of the planned action, claiming that the notice of the strike had been improperly issued. *24 hour strikes were planned for; **Monday 15 October from 6pm at Mail sorting offices and airports **Tuesday 16 October from 3am at Deliveries and collection hubs **Wednesday 17 October from midday for Royal Mail drivers **Thursday 18 October from midday for Manual data entry centres **Thursday 18 October from 2pm at Heathrow world distribution centre. *In late afternoon 12 October, Royal Mail succeeded in obtaining an injunction at London's High Court banning the scheduled strikes starting on 15 and 16 October. The union responded by issuing a suspension of the strikes. In addition, the planned actions in Airports and Separate Collection Hubs were withdrawn because of the small numbers involved. *On the evening of 12 October, Royal Mail and the CWU reached an agreement which was discussed by the union executive on 15‚Äì16 October and narrowly endorsed by them. Local issues *Industrial action took place in Burslem (Stoke on Trent) following the suspension of postal worker, Dave Condliffe, in relation to allegations of aggressive behaviour towards two managers. Wildcat strikes took place earlier in the year with support from the local branch of the Socialist Party. *On 10 October CWU members in London and Liverpool started an unofficial strike in response to changes in flexible working that meant they would have to start at 6am and finish not before 2.15pm. It was reported that all of South West London is out, East London, Peterbrough, Walsall and Manchester also were involved in unofficial action. *On 12 October, staff in Edinburgh and Grangemouth walked out in unofficial action in reaction to Royal Mail's decision to deduct pay for both the previous weeks walkout and that weeks walkout from a single pay packet Royal Mail response Royal Mail drafted in managers from non-operational roles to attempt to keep some mail moving through the system, and offered opportunities for those CWU members who wish to work to do so at other offices to avoid conflict with striking colleagues, but the strike still had a major impact on the operation.

Rozalia Lubomirska. Rozalia's daughter Alexandra Francis Rzewuska, 1814. They were incarcerated together during the Terror. Rozalia Lubomirska (16 September 1768 in Chernobyl ‚Äì 29 June 1794 in Paris) was a Polish noblewoman, most noted for her death. Born Countess Rozalia Chodkiewicz, she was the daughter of Count Jan Miko≈Çaj Chodkiewicz and Countess Maria Ludwika Rzewuska, who was a daughter of hetman and writer Wac≈Çaw Rzewuski. She was married in 1787 (at the age of 19) to Prince Aleksander Lubomirski. A year later she bore their daughter, Aleksandra. Rozalia Lubomirska as Girl with a Dove by Anna Rajecka Known for her beauty, Rozalia travelled to France, where she was rumoured to have some romantic affairs. Anna Rajecka's painting Girl with a Dove comes from that period. The allegory of virginity and innocence was meant to contradict the widespread gossip. Unhappy in her marriage, she decided to divorce her husband and did not accompany him on his way back to Poland. During the Revolution she was arrested along with her child, and tried for alleged conspiracy against the Revolution, and cooperation with the royalists. As a result, the 26-year-old princess was sentenced to death and soon beheaded by guillotine, although her guilt was, and remained, widely questioned. The death of a Polish national caused much concern among the Polish nobility who, prior to the Reign of Terror, openly cheered the Revolution. Lubomirska's husband, who returned to France to help her, as well as other Poles present in Paris at that time, vouched for her innocence. Among those who spoke in her defence were such great friends of liberty as Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko, the Polish-American revolutionary, who was granted honorary French citizenship during the Revolution. Following Rozalia's death, her daughter, Aleksandra Lubomirska, was released from prison and given under the guardianship of Izabella Le≈ºe≈Ñska. After her death, Rozalia became the subject of legends. According to one, her ghost appears in the Lubomirski's palace in Opole Lubelskie. The writer Adolf Dygasi≈Ñski claimed he saw her ghost.

Jefferson is believed to be a grandson of Thomas Jefferson, third President of the United States; his paternal grandmother was Sarah (Sally) Hemings, the president's mixed-race slave and half-sister to his late wife. Jefferson was the eldest son of Eston Hemings (1808‚Äì56), a former enslaved man freed in Jefferson's will, who was seven-eighths European in ancestry and \\"white\\" under Virginia law, and Julia Ann (n√©e Isaacs) Hemings (1814‚Äì1889), a free woman of color who was of three- quarters European descent. The Hemings moved from Charlottesville, Virginia to Chillicothe, Ohio in 1836. They moved to Madison, Wisconsin, in 1852, taking the surname Jefferson, and entered the white community, where they were well accepted. Early life and family John's father, Eston Hemings, was born a slave at Monticello in 1808, the youngest of Sally Hemings' six mixed-race children. They are widely understood to have been the children of President Thomas Jefferson, Hemings' master. As they were seven-eighths European in ancestry, under Virginian law at the time they were legally white. But they were born into slavery under the slave law principle of partus sequitur ventrem, by which children of slave mothers took the status of the mother. Sally Hemings was three-quarters white and a half-sister of Jefferson's late wife, Martha Wayles Skelton. Thomas Jefferson informally and formally freed all of Sally's four surviving children. He let the first two \\"escape\\" when they came of age; they went North to Washington, DC and passed into white society, both marrying white spouses. Jefferson's will freed Madison and Eston Hemings shortly after the president's death in 1826; Eston was \\"given his time\\" so that he did not have to wait until the age of 21 for freedom. Madison, already 21, had been freed immediately. In 1830 Eston purchased property in Charlottesville, on which he and his brother Madison built a house. Their mother Sally lived with them until her death in 1835. In Charlottesville, Eston married Julia Ann Isaacs, a mixed-race daughter of a wealthy Jewish merchant, David Isaacs from Germany, and Ann (Nancy) West, a free woman of color, who built an independent bakery business in the town. Eston and Julia Ann's first son John Wayles Hemings was born in Charlottesville in 1835. His first and middle name were after his great- grandfather John Wayles. As a widower Wayles had fathered six children by his enslaved concubine Betty Hemings, of whom the youngest was Sally Hemings. Eston and Julia's second child, Anna Wayles Hemings (1836‚Äì1866), was also born in Charlottesville. After his mother Sally died, Eston and Julia Ann Hemings moved their family to Chillicothe in the free state of Ohio, where they settled for more than 15 years. His and Julia Ann's youngest child, William Beverley Hemings (1839‚Äì1908), was born there. The town had a thriving free black community and strong abolitionist activists, who together helped fugitive slaves along the Underground Railroad. Eston was well known as a musician and entertainer. The children were educated in the public schools. His brother Madison Hemings and his family also moved there. In 1852, after passage of the Fugitive Slave Act increased the danger to members of the African-American community as slave catchers came to Ohio, as they sometimes kidnapped free blacks to sell them into slavery, the family moved North to Madison, Wisconsin, the state capital. There the entire family took the surname Jefferson to reflect Eston's and the children's ancestry. John was 17, Anna 16, and Beverly 13 at the time of the move. The family lived as part of the white community in Madison and for the rest of their lives. As adults, both Anna and Beverly Jefferson married white spouses; John never married. Anna died young in 1866 at the age of 30. Career Before the Civil War, John W. Jefferson operated the American House hotel in Madison, where he brought on his younger brother Beverly to help and learn the business. =Military service= At the age of 26, Jefferson entered the volunteer Union Army on August 26, 1861, at Madison, Wisconsin. He served in the 8th Wisconsin Infantry Regiment during the American Civil War. On September 28, 1861 he was promoted to Major; to Lieutenant Colonel on April 23, 1863; and to Colonel on June 16, 1864. He fought in significant battles of the war and was wounded at Vicksburg and during the Siege of Corinth. He was mustered out of service on October 11, 1864, at Madison, Wisconsin. His brother, William Beverly Jefferson, also served as a white soldier in the Union Army. According to service records, John Jefferson had red hair and gray eyes (as did Thomas Jefferson).Justus, Judith, Down from the Mountain: The Oral History of the Hemings Family, Lesher Printers, Inc., 1999, p. 91. Photographs show his strong resemblance to Thomas Jefferson. In 1902, a former neighbor from Chillicothe recalled John Jefferson's concerns about his mixed ancestry in the social climate of the times: > ... and I saw and talked with one of the sons, during the Civil War, who was > then wearing the silver leaves of a lieutenant colonel, and in command of a > fine regiment of white men from a north-western state.

After the war, he moved to Memphis, Tennessee, where he became a highly successful cotton broker, founding the Continental Cotton Company. > He raised cotton in Arkansas and bred blooded trotting horses on his > plantation near Memphis. Articles under his name in the Memphis Daily > Avalanche cover such matters as improving streets, enlarging the city's > boundaries, and preventing cotton-warehouse fires.Fawn M. Brodie, \\"Thomas > Jefferson's Unknown Grandchildren: A Study in Historical Silences\\", American > Heritage, October 1976, Vol. 27, Issue 6, accessed 13 November 2013. Jefferson never married. He died on June 12, 1892. He was interred in Madison, Wisconsin, in the Jefferson family plot at Forest Hill Cemetery. He left a sizeable estate. Ancestry controversy Historians disputed as to whether Thomas Jefferson had children with his slave Sally Hemings. Fawn McKay Brodie and Annette Gordon-Reed presented new analyses that assessed the historiography, showing evidence that other historians had overlooked. Y-DNA tests conducted in 1998 confirmed that a male-line descendant of John's brother Beverly had a male ancestor in common with male-line descendants of the Jefferson line. (As Thomas Jefferson had no acknowledged male descendants, another from his line had to be tested, but Y-DNA was passed unchanged.) This supported the Hemings family's tradition of descent from Thomas Jefferson. As the Carr DNA did not match, the Jefferson family tradition (stated by two grandchildren) that his Carr nephew(s) had fathered Sally Hemings' children was disproved. For most historians, this data, together with the weight of historical evidence, confirmed the Hemings family's claim of descent from Thomas Jefferson.Dinitia Smith and Nicholas Wade, \\"DNA Test Finds Evidence of Jefferson Child by Slave\\", New York Times, 1 November 1998, accessed 8 September 2011.

A short tract by him, entitled Introduction to Plato's dialogues, has survived. From the title of one of the extant manuscripts we learn that Albinus was a pupil of Gaius the Platonist.Tryggve G√∂ransson, (1995), Albinus, Alcinous, Arius Didymus, page 34. Acta Universitatis Gothoburgensis The original title of his work was probably Prologos, and it may have originally formed the initial section of notes taken at the lectures of Gaius.Tryggve G√∂ransson, (1995), Albinus, Alcinous, Arius Didymus, page 51-2. Acta Universitatis Gothoburgensis After explaining the nature of the Dialogue, which he compares to a Drama, the writer goes on to divide the Dialogues of Plato into four classes, logical, critical, physical, ethical, and mentions another division of them into Tetralogies, according to their subjects. He advises that the Alcibiades, Phaedo, Republic, and Timaeus, should be read in a series. Some of Albinus's fame is attributed to the fact that a 19th-century German scholar, J. Freudenthal, attributed Alcinous's Handbook of Platonism to Albinus. This attribution has since been discredited by the work of John Whittaker in 1974.John Whittaker, (1974), Parisinus Graecus 1962 and the Writings of Albinus, Phoenix 28, 320-54, 450-56.

She has many song writing credits both within and outside the group and also sings for many other German dance acts.  Early life  After attending kindergarten, Verena discovered her passion for music. In her autobiography on the Suprime Records website, Verena states that her interest began with her father's old piano, which lead Verena to begin piano lessons. At 14, Verena joined the cover band Querbeet. She spent 4 years with them as their lead singer, also playing the keyboard.  Suprime Records and Groove Coverage  At the age of 18, Verena was approached by Axel Konrad and Ole Wierk, who asked her to join the team at Suprime Records. After debating against herself for a while, she accepted. Verena, along with Markus Shaffarzyk (aka DJ Novus) was one of the faces for Groove Coverage when they first started, even though she was not the lead singer. This was because Mell was pregnant and could not travel to the locations of live gigs, photo shoots, and music video sets. Verena has sung lead on a number of songs done by the group including, Lullaby for Love and Rock, and has had solos during the bridge of songs such as Only Love and Because I Love You. She appeared in two of the group's music videos, God is a Girl and The End, although in both of these songs Mell sings the lead while Verena provides backing vocals. Verena was the stage performer miming the lyrics to their hit songs while lead vocalist Mell was pregnant. Since then, Verena has taken on a more behind the scenes or back seat role in the group, while she continues to write songs and record backing vocals she has been absent from video and photo shoots as well as live performances. Verena was one of the coproducers for the group's 21st Century album.  Other projects  Verena sings lead for the song Face 2 Face by Future Trace United, which is a group formed by the most successful DJs in Germany, including Axel Konrad and Special D, both of whom Verena has worked with separately. Working with Special D on his album Reckless, Verena wrote and provided lead vocals for the song Keep The Faith. Verena also works frequently with fellow Groove Coverage producer and Suprime Records label owner Axel Konrad. Axel operates under many different aliases for his music including: Age Pee, Renegade Masterz, and Spring Break. In 2012, she recorded the song My Party with DJane HouseKat and Rameez. She didn't got credit on it for an unknown reason but, she performed the song live in The Dome 62 along DJane HouseKat and the British rapper Rameez.  Other ventures Verena provides vocals for the songs: Hymn, Out of the Dark, When the Rain Begins to Fall, Because of You  Renegade Masterz  Verena provides vocals for the songs: Crystal Ship, Nasty Girl  Spring Break  Verena provides vocals for the songs: Shut up, Big Bad Love  Fashion Music  Verena runs a music school called Fashion Music, where she teaches students singing, piano and the art of music composition.

It is sometimes divided into a concern with the moral behavior of humans as they design, make, use and treat artificially intelligent systems, and a concern with the behavior of machines, in machine ethics. It also includes the issue of a possible singularity due to superintelligent AI. Robot ethics The term \\"robot ethics\\" (sometimes \\"roboethics\\") refers to the morality of how humans design, construct, use and treat robots. It considers both how artificially intelligent beings may be used to harm humans and how they may be used to benefit humans. =Robot rights= \\"Robot rights\\" is the concept that people should have moral obligations towards their machines, similar to human rights or animal rights. It has been suggested that robot rights, such as a right to exist and perform its own mission, could be linked to robot duty to serve human, by analogy with linking human rights to human duties before society. These could include the right to life and liberty, freedom of thought and expression and equality before the law. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition The issue has been considered by the Institute for the Future and by the U.K. Department of Trade and Industry.

The philosophy of Sentientism grants degrees of moral consideration to all sentient beings, primarily humans and most non-human animals. If artificial or alien intelligence show evidence of being sentient, this philosophy holds that they should be shown compassion and granted rights. Joanna Bryson has argued that creating AI that requires rights is both avoidable, and would in itself be unethical, both as a burden to the AI agents and to human society. =Threat to human dignity= Joseph Weizenbaum argued in 1976 that AI technology should not be used to replace people in positions that require respect and care, such as any of these: * A customer service representative (AI technology is already used today for telephone-based interactive voice response systems) * A therapist (as was proposed by Kenneth Colby in the 1970s) * A nursemaid for the elderly (as was reported by Pamela McCorduck in her book The Fifth Generation) * A soldier * A judge * A police officer Weizenbaum explains that we require authentic feelings of empathy from people in these positions. If machines replace them, we will find ourselves alienated, devalued and frustrated, for the artificially intelligent system would not be able to simulate empathy. Artificial intelligence, if used in this way, represents a threat to human dignity. Weizenbaum argues that the fact that we are entertaining the possibility of machines in these positions suggests that we have experienced an \\"atrophy of the human spirit that comes from thinking of ourselves as computers.\\"Joseph Weizenbaum, quoted in Pamela McCorduck counters that, speaking for women and minorities \\"I'd rather take my chances with an impartial computer,\\" pointing out that there are conditions where we would prefer to have automated judges and police that have no personal agenda at all. However, Kaplan and Haenlein stress that AI systems are only as smart as the data used to train them since they are, in their essence, nothing more than fancy curve-fitting machines: Using AI to support a court ruling can be highly problematic if past rulings show bias toward certain groups since those biases get formalized and engrained, which makes them even more difficult to spot and fight against. AI founder John McCarthy objects to the moralizing tone of Weizenbaum's critique. \\"When moralizing is both vehement and vague, it invites authoritarian abuse,\\" he writes. Bill Hibbard writes that \\"Human dignity requires that we strive to remove our ignorance of the nature of existence, and AI is necessary for that striving.\\" =Transparency, accountability, and open source= Bill Hibbard argues that because AI will have such a profound effect on humanity, AI developers are representatives of future humanity and thus have an ethical obligation to be transparent in their efforts.Open Source AI.

There are numerous other open-source AI developments. Unfortunately, making code open source does not make it comprehensible, which by many definitions means that the AI code is not transparent. The IEEE has a standardisation effort on AI transparency.. The IEEE effort identifies multiple scales of transparency for different users. Further, there is concern that releasing the full capacity of contemporary AI to some organizations may be a public bad, that is, do more damage than good. For example, Microsoft has expressed concern about allowing universal access to its face recognition software, even for those who can pay for it. Microsoft posted an extraordinary blog on this topic, asking for government regulation to help determine the right thing to do. Not only companies, but many other researchers and citizen advocates recommend government regulation as a means of ensuring transparency, and through it, human accountability. An updated collection (list) of AI Ethics is maintained by AlgorithmWatch. This strategy has proven controversial, as some worry that it will slow the rate of innovation. Others argue that regulation leads to systemic stability more able to support innovation in the long term. The OECD, UN, EU, and many countries are presently working on strategies for regulating AI, and finding appropriate legal frameworks. On June 26, 2019, the European Commission High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI HLEG) published its ‚ÄúPolicy and investment recommendations for trustworthy Artificial Intelligence‚Äù. This is the AI HLEG's second deliverable, after the April 2019 publication of the \\"Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI\\". The June AI HLEG recommendations cover four principal subjects: humans and society at large, research and academia, the private sector, and the public sector. The European Commission claims that \\"HLEG's recommendations reflect an appreciation of both the opportunities for AI technologies to drive economic growth, prosperity and innovation, as well as the potential risks involved\\" and states that the EU aims to lead on the framing of policies governing AI internationally.  Biases in AI systems  '' US Senator Kamala Harris speaks about racial bias in artificial intelligence. AI has become increasingly inherent in facial and voice recognition systems. Some of these systems have real business implications and directly impact people. These systems are vulnerable to biases and errors introduced by its human makers. Also, the data used to train these AI systems itself can have biases. For instance, facial recognition algorithms made by Microsoft, IBM and Face++ all had biases when it came to detecting people's gender. These AI systems were able to detect gender of white men more accurately than gender of darker skin men. Further, a 2020 study reviewed voice recognition systems from Amazon, Apple, Google, IBM, and Microsoft found that they have higher error rates when transcribing black people's voices than white people's. Similarly, Amazon's.com Inc's termination of AI hiring and recruitment is another example which exhibits that AI cannot be fair. The algorithm preferred more male candidates than female. This was because Amazon's system was trained with data collected over 10-year period that came mostly from male candidates. Bias can creep into algorithms in many ways. For example, Friedman and Nissenbaum identify three categories of bias in computer systems: existing bias, technical bias, and emergent bias. In a highly influential branch of AI known as \\"natural language processing,\\" problems can arise from the \\"text corpus\\"‚Äîthe source material the algorithm uses to learn about the relationships between different words. Large companies such as IBM, Google, etc. started researching and addressing bias. One solution for addressing bias is to create documentation for the data used to train AI systems. The problem of bias in machine learning is likely to become more significant as the technology spreads to critical areas like medicine and law, and as more people without a deep technical understanding are tasked with deploying it. Some experts warn that algorithmic bias is already pervasive in many industries and that almost no one is making an effort to identify or correct it.  Liability for self-driving cars  The wide use of partial to fully autonomous cars seems to be imminent in the future. But fully autonomous technologies present new issues and challenges. Recently, a debate over the legal liability have risen over the responsible party if these cars get into accidents. In one of the reports a driverless car hit a pedestrian and had a dilemma over whom to blame for the accident. Even though the driver was inside the car during the accident, the controls were fully in the hand of computers. In one case that took place on March 19, 2018, a self-driving Uber car killed a pedestrian in Arizona-Death of Elaine Herzberg. Without further investigation on how the pedestrian got injury/death in such a case. It is important for people to reconsider the liability not only for those parts or fully automated cars, but those stakeholders who should be responsible for such a situation as well. In this case, the automated cars have the function of detecting nearby possible cars and objects in order to run the function of self-driven, but it did not have the ability to react to a nearby pedestrian within its original function due to the fact that there will not be people appear on the road in a normal sense. This leads to the issue of whether the driver, pedestrian, the car company, or the government should be responsible in such a case. According to this article, with the current partial or fully automated cars' function are still amateur which still require driver to pay attention with fully control the vehicle since all these functions/feature are just supporting driver to be less tried while they driving, but not let go. Thus, the government should be most responsible for current situation on how they should regulate the car company and driver who are over-rely on self- driven feature as well educated them that these are just technologies that bring convenience to people life but not a short-cut. Before autonomous cars become widely used, these issues need to be tackled through new policies. Weaponization of artificial intelligence Some experts and academics have questioned the use of robots for military combat, especially when such robots are given some degree of autonomous functions.Call for debate on killer robots, By Jason Palmer, Science and technology reporter, BBC News, 8/3/09.Robot Three-Way Portends Autonomous Future, By David Axe wired.com, August 13, 2009. On October 31, 2019, the United States Department of Defense's Defense Innovation Board published the draft of a report recommending principles for the ethical use of artificial intelligence by the Department of Defense that would ensure a human operator would always be able to look into the 'black box' and understand the kill-chain process. However, a major concern is how the report will be implemented. The US Navy has funded a report which indicates that as military robots become more complex, there should be greater attention to implications of their ability to make autonomous decisions.New Navy-funded Report Warns of War Robots Going \\"Terminator\\" , by Jason Mick (Blog), dailytech.com, February 17, 2009.Navy report warns of robot uprising, suggests a strong moral compass, by Joseph L. Flatley engadget.com, Feb 18th 2009. One researcher states that autonomous robots might be more humane, as they could make decisions more effectively. Within this last decade, there has been intensive research in autonomous power with the ability to learn using assigned moral responsibilities. \\"The results may be used when designing future military robots, to control unwanted tendencies to assign responsibility to the robots.\\" From a consequentialist view, there is a chance that robots will develop the ability to make their own logical decisions on whom to kill and that is why there should be a set moral framework that the AI cannot override. There has been a recent outcry with regard to the engineering of artificial intelligence weapons that have included ideas of a robot takeover of mankind. AI weapons do present a type of danger different from that of human-controlled weapons. Many governments have begun to fund programs to develop AI weaponry. The United States Navy recently announced plans to develop autonomous drone weapons, paralleling similar announcements by Russia and Korea respectively. Due to the potential of AI weapons becoming more dangerous than human-operated weapons, Stephen Hawking and Max Tegmark signed a \\"Future of Life\\" petition to ban AI weapons. The message posted by Hawking and Tegmark states that AI weapons pose an immediate danger and that action is required to avoid catastrophic disasters in the near future. \\"If any major military power pushes ahead with the AI weapon development, a global arms race is virtually inevitable, and the endpoint of this technological trajectory is obvious: autonomous weapons will become the Kalashnikovs of tomorrow\\", says the petition, which includes Skype co-founder Jaan Tallinn and MIT professor of linguistics Noam Chomsky as additional supporters against AI weaponry. Physicist and Astronomer Royal Sir Martin Rees has warned of catastrophic instances like \\"dumb robots going rogue or a network that develops a mind of its own.\\" Huw Price, a colleague of Rees at Cambridge, has voiced a similar warning that humans might not survive when intelligence \\"escapes the constraints of biology.\\" These two professors created the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk at Cambridge University in the hope of avoiding this threat to human existence. Regarding the potential for smarter-than-human systems to be employed militarily, the Open Philanthropy Project writes that these scenarios \\"seem potentially as important as the risks related to loss of control\\", but research investigating AI's long-run social impact have spent relatively little time on this concern: \\"this class of scenarios has not been a major focus for the organizations that have been most active in this space, such as the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI) and the Future of Humanity Institute (FHI), and there seems to have been less analysis and debate regarding them\\". Machine ethics Machine ethics (or machine morality) is the field of research concerned with designing Artificial Moral Agents (AMAs), robots or artificially intelligent computers that behave morally or as though moral. To account for the nature of these agents, it has been suggested to consider certain philosophical ideas, like the standard characterizations of agency, rational agency, moral agency, and artificial agency, which are related to the concept of AMAs. Isaac Asimov considered the issue in the 1950s in his I, Robot. At the insistence of his editor John W. Campbell Jr., he proposed the Three Laws of Robotics to govern artificially intelligent systems. Much of his work was then spent testing the boundaries of his three laws to see where they would break down, or where they would create paradoxical or unanticipated behavior. His work suggests that no set of fixed laws can sufficiently anticipate all possible circumstances. More recently, academics and many governments have challenged the idea that AI can itself be held accountable. A panel convened by the United Kingdom in 2010 revised Asimov's laws to clarify that AI is the responsibility either of its manufacturers, or of its owner/operator. In 2009, during an experiment at the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems in the Ecole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale of Lausanne in Switzerland, robots that were programmed to cooperate with each other (in searching out a beneficial resource and avoiding a poisonous one) eventually learned to lie to each other in an attempt to hoard the beneficial resource.Evolving Robots Learn To Lie To Each Other, Popular Science, August 18, 2009 Some experts and academics have questioned the use of robots for military combat, especially when such robots are given some degree of autonomous functions. The US Navy has funded a report which indicates that as military robots become more complex, there should be greater attention to implications of their ability to make autonomous decisions.Science New Navy- funded Report Warns of War Robots Going \\"Terminator\\" , by Jason Mick (Blog), dailytech.com, February 17, 2009.Navy report warns of robot uprising, suggests a strong moral compass, by Joseph L. Flatley engadget.com, Feb 18th 2009. The President of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence has commissioned a study to look at this issue.AAAI Presidential Panel on Long-Term AI Futures 2008-2009 Study, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, Accessed 7/26/09. They point to programs like the Language Acquisition Device which can emulate human interaction. Vernor Vinge has suggested that a moment may come when some computers are smarter than humans. He calls this \\"the Singularity.\\" He suggests that it may be somewhat or possibly very dangerous for humans.The Coming Technological Singularity: How to Survive in the Post-Human Era, by Vernor Vinge, Department of Mathematical Sciences, San Diego State University, (c) 1993 by Vernor Vinge. This is discussed by a philosophy called Singularitarianism. The Machine Intelligence Research Institute has suggested a need to build \\"Friendly AI\\", meaning that the advances which are already occurring with AI should also include an effort to make AI intrinsically friendly and humane.Article at Asimovlaws.com , July 2004, accessed 7/27/09. In 2009, academics and technical experts attended a conference organized by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence to discuss the potential impact of robots and computers and the impact of the hypothetical possibility that they could become self-sufficient and able to make their own decisions. They discussed the possibility and the extent to which computers and robots might be able to acquire any level of autonomy, and to what degree they could use such abilities to possibly pose any threat or hazard. They noted that some machines have acquired various forms of semi-autonomy, including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons. They also noted that some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved \\"cockroach intelligence.\\" They noted that self- awareness as depicted in science-fiction is probably unlikely, but that there were other potential hazards and pitfalls. However, there is one technology in particular that could truly bring the possibility of robots with moral competence to reality. In a paper on the acquisition of moral values by robots, Nayef Al-Rodhan mentions the case of neuromorphic chips, which aim to process information similarly to humans, nonlinearly and with millions of interconnected artificial neurons. Robots embedded with neuromorphic technology could learn and develop knowledge in a uniquely humanlike way. Inevitably, this raises the question of the environment in which such robots would learn about the world and whose morality they would inherit - or if they end up developing human 'weaknesses' as well: selfishness, a pro-survival attitude, hesitation etc. In Moral Machines: Teaching Robots Right from Wrong, Wendell Wallach and Colin Allen conclude that attempts to teach robots right from wrong will likely advance understanding of human ethics by motivating humans to address gaps in modern normative theory and by providing a platform for experimental investigation. As one example, it has introduced normative ethicists to the controversial issue of which specific learning algorithms to use in machines. Nick Bostrom and Eliezer Yudkowsky have argued for decision trees (such as ID3) over neural networks and genetic algorithms on the grounds that decision trees obey modern social norms of transparency and predictability (e.g. stare decisis), while Chris Santos-Lang argued in the opposite direction on the grounds that the norms of any age must be allowed to change and that natural failure to fully satisfy these particular norms has been essential in making humans less vulnerable to criminal \\"hackers\\". According to a 2019 report from the Center for the Governance of AI at the University of Oxford, 82% of Americans believe that robots and AI should be carefully managed. Concerns cited ranged from how AI is used in surveillance and in spreading fake content online (known as deep fakes when they include doctored video images and audio generated with help from AI) to cyberattacks, infringements on data privacy, hiring bias, autonomous vehicles, and drones that don't require a human controller. Singularity Many researchers have argued that, by way of an \\"intelligence explosion,\\" a self-improving AI could become so powerful that humans would not be able to stop it from achieving its goals.Muehlhauser, Luke, and Louie Helm. 2012. \\"Intelligence Explosion and Machine Ethics\\". In Singularity Hypotheses: A Scientific and Philosophical Assessment, edited by Amnon Eden, Johnny S√∏raker, James H. Moor, and Eric Steinhart. Berlin: Springer. In his paper \\"Ethical Issues in Advanced Artificial Intelligence\\" and subsequent book Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies, philosopher Nick Bostrom argues that artificial intelligence has the capability to bring about human extinction. He claims that general superintelligence would be capable of independent initiative and of making its own plans, and may therefore be more appropriately thought of as an autonomous agent. Since artificial intellects need not share our human motivational tendencies, it would be up to the designers of the superintelligence to specify its original motivations. Because a superintelligent AI would be able to bring about almost any possible outcome and to thwart any attempt to prevent the implementation of its goals, many uncontrolled unintended consequences could arise. It could kill off all other agents, persuade them to change their behavior, or block their attempts at interference.Bostrom, Nick. 2003. \\"Ethical Issues in Advanced Artificial Intelligence\\". In Cognitive, Emotive and Ethical Aspects of Decision Making in Humans and in Artificial Intelligence, edited by Iva Smit and George E. Lasker, 12‚Äì17. Vol. 2. Windsor, ON: International Institute for Advanced Studies in Systems Research / Cybernetics. However, instead of overwhelming the human race and leading to our destruction, Bostrom has also asserted that superintelligence can help us solve many difficult problems such as disease, poverty, and environmental destruction, and could help us to ‚Äúenhance‚Äù ourselves. The sheer complexity of human value systems makes it very difficult to make AI's motivations human-friendly. Unless moral philosophy provides us with a flawless ethical theory, an AI's utility function could allow for many potentially harmful scenarios that conform with a given ethical framework but not \\"common sense\\". According to Eliezer Yudkowsky, there is little reason to suppose that an artificially designed mind would have such an adaptation.Yudkowsky, Eliezer. 2011. \\"Complex Value Systems in Friendly AI\\". In Schmidhuber, Th√≥risson, and Looks 2011, 388‚Äì393. AI researchers such as Stuart J. Russell and Bill Hibbard have proposed design strategies for developing beneficial machines. AI ethics organisations There are many organisations concerned with AI ethics and policy, public and governmental as well as corporate and societal. Amazon, Google, Facebook, IBM, and Microsoft have established a non-profit partnership to formulate best practices on artificial intelligence technologies, advance the public's understanding, and to serve as a platform about artificial intelligence. Apple joined in January 2017. The corporate members will make financial and research contributions to the group, while engaging with the scientific community to bring academics onto the board. The IEEE put together a Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems which has been creating and revising guidelines with the help of public input, and accepts as members many professionals from within and without its organization. Traditionally, government has been used by societies to ensure ethics are observed through legislation and policing. There are now many efforts by national governments, as well as transnational government and non-government organizations to ensure AI is ethically applied. * The European Commission has a High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence. On 8 April 2019, this published its 'Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence'. in February 2020, the European Union's Digital Policy Development and Coordination unit published a white paper on excellence and trust in artificial intelligence innovation. * The OECD on Artificial Intelligence * In the United States the Obama administration put together a Roadmap for AI Policy (link is to Harvard Business Review's account of it. The Obama Administration released two prominent white papers on the future and impact of AI. The Trump administration has not been actively engaged in AI regulation to date (January 2019). *The Computing Community Consortium (CCC) weighed in with a 100-plus page draft report ‚Äì A 20-Year Community Roadmap for Artificial Intelligence Research in the US * The Center for Security and Emerging Technology advises US policymakers on the security implications of emerging technologies such as AI. In fiction The movie The Thirteenth Floor suggests a future where simulated worlds with sentient inhabitants are created by computer game consoles for the purpose of entertainment. The movie The Matrix suggests a future where the dominant species on planet Earth are sentient machines and humanity is treated with utmost Speciesism. The short story \\"The Planck Dive\\" suggest a future where humanity has turned itself into software that can be duplicated and optimized and the relevant distinction between types of software is sentient and non-sentient. The same idea can be found in the Emergency Medical Hologram of Starship Voyager, which is an apparently sentient copy of a reduced subset of the consciousness of its creator, Dr. Zimmerman, who, for the best motives, has created the system to give medical assistance in case of emergencies. The movies Bicentennial Man and A.I. deal with the possibility of sentient robots that could love. I, Robot explored some aspects of Asimov's three laws. All these scenarios try to foresee possibly unethical consequences of the creation of sentient computers. The ethics of artificial intelligence is one of several core themes in BioWare's Mass Effect series of games. It explores the scenario of a civilization accidentally creating AI through a rapid increase in computational power through a global scale neural network. This event caused an ethical schism between those who felt bestowing organic rights upon the newly sentient Geth was appropriate and those who continued to see them as disposable machinery and fought to destroy them. Beyond the initial conflict, the complexity of the relationship between the machines and their creators is another ongoing theme throughout the story. Over time, debates have tended to focus less and less on possibility and more on desirability, as emphasized in the \\"Cosmist\\" and \\"Terran\\" debates initiated by Hugo de Garis and Kevin Warwick. A Cosmist, according to Hugo de Garis, is actually seeking to build more intelligent successors to the human species. Experts at the University of Cambridge have argued that AI is portrayed in fiction and nonfiction overwhelmingly as racially White, in ways that distort perceptions of its risks and benefits.

Released in 2005, the album initially failed to chart. However, in July 2006 the album entered the Danish Charts, peaking at #18. The album would stay on that chart for 21 non-consecutive weeks. Volbeat's label at the time, Mascot Records, had only a limited distribution deal in the United States, meaning that the album went largely unnoticed in that country. Volbeat would not breakthrough in the United States until 2010 with their fourth album, Beyond Hell/Above Heaven. Two of the album's songs, \\"Danny & Lucy (11PM)\\" and \\"Fire Song\\" form a story which is continued on Volbeat's second album, Rock The Rebel/Metal The Devil with the song \\"Mr. & Mrs. Ness\\", the song \\"Mary Ann's Place\\" from the band's third album, Guitar Gangsters & Cadillac Blood, and is concluded on the band's sixth album, Seal the Deal & Let's Boogie with the song \\"You Will Know\\". The songs \\"Pool of Booze, Booze, Booza\\", \\"Soulweeper\\", \\"Danny & Lucy (11 PM)\\", and \\"Alienized\\" are all taken from Volbeat's 2003 demo, titled \\"Beat The Meat\\". Additionally, the song Soulweeper was released as a single in 2003, though the band did not have a label when it was released and is considered a demo. The only official single released from the album was the band's cover of Dusty Springfield's \\"I Only Wanna Be With You\\", which was released in 2006. The band also filmed a music video for the single, which features Volbeat performing on a rooftop.  Reception  Being a limited release outside of Denmark, professional English reviews of the album are scarce. Scott Alisoglu of Blabbermouth.com gave the album a 7.5/10, saying \\"Loud guitars, a nice collection of hooks, and an endearingly oddball vocal performance make \\"The Strength/The Sounds/The Songs\\" a worthwhile spin.

Biography He studied Law at the University of Oviedo and worked as secretary of the bishop of Barcelona. In 1809 he was appointed secretary of the patriotic Royal Junta of the Treasury and Legislation. He was member of the Cortes of C√°diz and was selected for the Constitutional commission, playing thus a key role in the drafting of the Constitution of 1812. Siding with the liberal faction of the Parliament, he promoted freedom of the press, free-market and physiocracy, the abolishment of torture, the prosecution of slave trade and the abolishment of the jurisdictional power of manors. He showed a notable oratorial skill during the parliamentary debates. When in 1814 the War of Independence finished and Ferdinand VII returned to Spain as absolute monarch, Arg√ºelles was imprisoned in Ceuta and later in Alcudia (Majorca). After the Riego's coup d'√©tat in 1820, he was appointed minister of the Interior and led the moderate wing of the liberal party. He resigned in 1821 and was elected member of the Parliament in 1822. After the absolutist reaction of 1823, he exiled to Britain and turned back in 1834, when Queen Regent Maria Christina signed the 'Estatuto Real'. He was elected member of the Parliament and also turned to his original progressive liberal positions back, giving support to Mendiz√°bal cabinet of 1835 and his ecclesiastical confiscation policy. After the revolution of 1836, he was appointed member of the commission for composing the Constitution that was promulgated in 1837. Thanks to him and to Ol√≥zaga, the Constitution was progressive liberal but not so much as 1812's, as they hoped moderate liberals would accept it. When Queen Regent Maria Christina resigned in 1840, the Parliament debated whether to appoint one or three regents, including Arg√ºelles. Finally, General Espartero was elected as the only Regent, but Arg√ºelles was appointed legal guardian of Queen Isabella II (although Maria Christina protested the decision from Paris) and president of the Parliament. He ceased to be legal tutor in 1843, when Espartero resigned as Regent and Parliament decided to declare come of age 13-year-old queen. He was freemason.

DiGerolamo on March 9, 1966) is a comic book writer and screenwriter from New Jersey. Career Tony DiGerolamo began his comics career in 1996 with the publication of his first comic book, \\"Jersey Devil #1\\", based on the Jersey Devil legend and several articles written in the South Jersey Courier-Post. It was published under his own imprint, South Jersey Rebellion Productions. Pencilled largely by Steven Cornicelli and inked by Bob Clark, \\"Jersey Devil #1\\" enjoyed modest sales. Replacing the art team, DiGerolamo recruited Dom LaGrutta, Jr. for the pencils and Donn Smith for the inks, giving \\"Jersey Devil #2\\" a cleaner look. Although the improvements continued to bring DiGerolamo and the SJRP strong local sales, comic fans largely ignored the comic. DiGerolamo's insistence on longer issues and multi- issue stories put a strain on his art team and forced him to recruit additional artists. Around 1999, DiGerolamo launched what would become a more successful comic book, The Travelers, which was eventually picked up by Kenzer & Company at issue #4. With the changes of art teams, Jersey Devil was dropped by Diamond Distributors after issue #7 due to low sales. DiGerolamo struggled to keep the comic alive publishing issues 8 to 12 in mini-comic formats. Now relieved of the financial burden of publication, DiGerolamo concentrated more on making The Travelers a success. The bimonthly schedule put a strain on artist Brian Dawson and the variety of inkers on the book, who included the Fraim Brothers. DiGerolamo also launched a four-issue mini-series called The Fix to coincide with a novel with the same character. By issue 9, Dawson could no longer commit to The Travelers hectic schedule, so inker James Dunn took over the art chores for issues 10 and 11. Eventually, DiGerolamo found a new artist with Chris Moreno on the \\"Travelers #12\\". Sales peaked with The Travelers issue #14, which was a crossover with Knights of the Dinner Table Illustrated. Shortly thereafter, he took over the writing chores for another Kenzer comic called Everknights. DiGerolamo moved The Travelers to Wingnut Games with issue #21. By issue 22, Moreno could no longer keep doing the Travelers with his other comic work. DiGerolamo struggled with a series of other artists, with Moreno occasionally coming back to help with the art. The comic limped to the 25th issue before Wingnut had to cancel it. By this time, DiGerolamo had landed side work with Bongo Comics writing for the Bart Simpson comics. His first story was a Lisa story entitled \\"A Chair of One's Own\\" in November 2002. While he continued to write for Bongo, he met the publishers at Silent Devil. Looking for another project that both he and Moreno could work on, the duo launched the Super Frat webcomic under Silent Devil's banner. In 2006, Silent Devil published its first compilation of Super Frat called \\"Super Frat: Rush Week Collection\\". DiGerolamo continues to write screenplays and comic books in New Jersey. He is also the creator of \\"Complete Mafia\\" for d20 from Living Room Games and worked on an online zombie TV show called Zombie Country. DiGerolamo currently works with Christian Beranek on a webcomic hub called The Webcomic Factory. Books *The Wildsidhe Chronicles: Book 5: The Undercover Dragon 2003, Published by Padwolf Publishing.

Typically, these are arrangements that have been negotiated in the past between employers and unions. The issue arises because, in United Kingdom law, a contract of employment consists of both expressed and implied terms.Citizens Advice Bureau What is a contract of employment Implied terms can arise through \\"custom and practice\\". Historically, alteration of these terms has been by negotiation and collective bargaining. For example, if it has been the habit to release staff when the day's work is done (such as, today's newspaper is printed), then that becomes the de facto contract of employment. If some workers are required to stay on to do additional tasks, then it may be more convenient to pay these workers to do so (since otherwise they are not being treated equitably and/or have no incentive to do so). Over many years of incremental negotiation, the original rationale may be lost and a point reached where all workers are being paid a supplement merely to complete a normal shift. With the benefit of hindsight, such an arrangement might be described as a \\"Spanish practice\\". The expression was widely used in reporting the 2007 Royal Mail industrial disputes, the UK‚Äôs national postal service. The term was used in an interview by Royal Mail Chief Executive Adam Crozier. Crozier described as \\"cobblers\\" claims by the Communication Workers Union deputy general secretary Dave Ward that the way Royal Mail made its employees work amounted to \\"slavery\\". According to Crozier, Royal Mail was \\"only trying to make people work the hours for which they were paid\\". He claimed there were 1,442 Spanish practices at Royal Mail a few years ago, and these had now been cut to 92. One example of such practices was paid overtime within normal working hours, after workers completed their scheduled delivery rounds early. Earlier, the term old Spanish customs was used in 1986 in reference to long- lasting industrial action in Fleet Street, traditionally the home of the UK‚Äôs newspaper industry, for example the Wapping dispute. Main types of \\"Spanish practices\\" include allowing workers to go home before the end of their shift if they have completed their scheduled work; negotiable paid overtime within normal working hours after completing scheduled work, regardless of remaining working hours; automatic overtime pay if production reaches a certain level regardless of remaining working hours; no overlap between functions in the same workplace (demarcation); and overtime pay to cover absence of colleagues. Implications and history The term is viewed by some as pejorative or politically incorrect, but remains in common use in the media when labour disputes occur. According to BBC Radio 4 presenter Nigel Rees, the terms have been used since the 1970s to describe malpractices among the trades unions, especially the print unions in Fleet Street. Speaking on Radio 4‚Äôs Broadcasting House current affairs programme on Sunday 7 October 2007, Rees said: ‚ÄúAs one knows, Spanish people are very hard-working, upright people. But I suppose one or two of them may tend to take the 'ma√±ana' attitude.‚Äù Citing the origin of the terms, Rees said usage goes back to the Elizabethan era. William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, described Sir Thomas Tresham II as being ‚Äúnot given to Spanish practices‚Äù, meaning Roman Catholic practices, which at the time were censured in England. In 1584 another secretary of Queen Elizabeth I, Francis Walsingham, referred to Spanish practices in a way that meant they were \\"deceitful, perfidious and treacherous‚Äù. This may well help to give the current meaning of the term. Since the days of strong unions in the 1960s and 1970s through the Thatcherite reforms of the 1980s, Spanish practices have been increasingly removed from the workplace.

Berry is a fishing sloop located at the Mystic Seaport Museum in Mystic, Connecticut, United States, and one of the oldest surviving commercial vessels in America. She is the last known surviving American well smack. This type of boat is also termed a sloop smack or Noank smack. The Noank design was imitated in other regions of the United States. Emma C. Berry was built in 1866 at the Palmer Shipyards in Noank, Connecticut by James A. Latham. and The boat was named for Captain John Henry Berry's daughter. In 1886 she was rigged as a schooner, and in 1916 a gasoline engine was added. She was restored in 1931 to her original condition. She was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1994.  Construction  The Emma C. Berry was built in 1865 by John Latham in the R. & J. Palmer Shipyard in Noank, Connecticut for John Henry Berry. The ship was named after his daughter and constructed in a similar way to other Noank smacks. The ship was launched in 1866 with a sloop rig and two head-sails. History Originally, John Henry Berry had a 1/2 stake with Moses Wilbur, William Latham, Charles Spencer and Amos Lanplear each owning 1/8 stake. Ownership changed by September 1866, with Berry having no stake in the ship. In 1870, the ship was owned by Henry Chapel with 5/8 and Henry Brown with 3/8. In 1872, Robert Westcote was the sole owner and master of the Emma C. Berry. Henry Chapel became the managing owner in 1886 and the sole owner in 1887, and then she was re-rigged as schooner. It changed ownership several times from 1895 to 1910, when it became owned by the Marston Lobster Pound Co. (5/8), Sargent Land and Co. (1/8) and by Charles A. Baker (2/8). Just two years later in 1918, S. A. Skilling and Son had a 6/8 stake and Clarence A. Baker retained his 2/8th stake. From 1918 through 1929 various individuals came to own her. Her career as a fishing vessel ended around 1924 and she was left on the flats of Beals, Maine. In 1926, she was purchased by Milton Beal and used as a coastal freighter. F. Slade Dale purchased the ship in 1931, restored it and registered the ship in Philadelphia. Dale retained ownership until it was donated to the Mystic Seaport in 1969. Captain Dayton O. Newton, bandmaster at Admiral Farragut Academy (Pine Beach, NJ) and captain of the Schooner Adventure (Camden, ME) met Dale in the early 1960s and offered to assemble a volunteer crew of Admiral Farragut Academy cadets to work on the Berry. Newton convinced Dale that she should sail back to the yard in Noank 100 years following her launch. In 1965 Captain Newton and volunteers sailed the ship on a shakedown cruise up the Hudson to Troy, NY carrying a cargo of historical documents to the Albany Historical Society. During this shakedown cruise, Pete Seeger came aboard for a concert from the Berry raising funds for his soon to be built Clearwater. In 1992, the Emma C. Berry sailed from the Mystic Seaport down to Fishers Island Sound under sloop rig, for the first time in 106 years.  Alterations  The Emma C. Berry has undergone numerous alterations in rigging, modification and repairs throughout its career before undergoing an extensive restoration to return it to its original configuration. The original sloop was rerigged as a schooner in 1887 and Will Beal installed a Knox gasoline engine around 1916. Woodward and Hopkins changed the ship to a freighter and Milton Beal would later remove the well. In 1963, a $5000 \\"restoration\\" of the ship was used to make her seaworthy. The ship's tonnage varies according to the official records. In 1894 and 1897, at 15.76 gross tons and 14.96 net tons. In 1912 and 1915, it registered 15 gross tons and 14 net tons.  Restoration  After its arrival at the Mystic Seaport, the Emma C. Berry underwent the first phase of its restoration, lasting from 1969 to 1971. The restoration restored the original sloop rig and wet well and renewed the stanchions and rotting frames and floor timbers. After additional research and a collection of photographs were acquired, the Mystic Seaport began a second restoration from to restore the deck, horn timbers, spar ironwork and sails. The Mystic Seaport drew upon literature and other sources to accurately restore her to her original configuration and appearance. The painting of the hull black follows the Rattler, an 1855 Noank smack built by R. & J. Palmer; previous to it hulls were painted \\"bottle green\\". Further evidence is the painting of the 1867 Noank smack Mary E. Hoxie by Elisha Baker, depicting the black hull. The choice to restore the ship to its original sloop condition was not universally accepted. Jack Wilbur, a Noank boat builder and master mariner, believes the return to the sloop rigging was nonsensical because it went against the way the ship sailed from its early years, as a schooner. Wilbur states that the schooner rig served the Emma C. Berry longer than the entire lives of those who made the decision.  Importance  The National Historic Landmark nomination form states that, \\"[t]he sloop smack Emma C. Berry is the last known surviving American smack.\\" Important as the last surviving American well smack and with a lengthy service life, the ship is typical of the Noank smacks of the era.

Early life Vaughan was born at Courtfield, near Ross-on-Wye in Herefordshire, the son of Lieutenant-Colonel John Francis Vaughan, of an old recusant (Roman Catholic) family, the Vaughans of Courtfield, Herefordshire. His mother, Eliza Rolls from The Hendre, Monmouthshire, was a Catholic convert and intensely religious. All five of the Vaughan daughters became nuns, while six of the eight sons took Holy Orders and became priests. John Vaughan studied at St. Gregory's College, and at the English College Bruges, then finally at Rome, before being ordained priest 4 June 1876 at Salford Cathedral by his brother Bishop Herbert Vaughan. Career Immediately after ordination Fr Vaughan was appointed to the staff of the recently opened St. Bede's College as Professor of Mathematics, however he resigned in November of that same year following a breakdown in health and was invited by his brother Bishop Roger Vaughan to come and undertake Missionary work in Australia. He returned to England in July 1879 and rejoined the staff of St Bede's in his former role as Professor of Mathematics, where he remained until July 1886. In 1886, Fr Vaughan was invited by his brother Fr Kenelm Vaughan to join him at his new venture 'The House of Expiation' in Chelsea, London. In 1896, he was appointed domestic prelate to the Papal Court with the title Monsignor and in 1898 became Canon of Westminster. Between 1890 and 1903, he organized free Catholic lectures in various public halls in London. He resided in Rome 1904-07, and then undertook a preaching tour in the United States and Canada. In 1909, Monsignor Vaughan returned to England and was sent back to the Diocese of Salford to assist Bishop Louis Charles Casartelli as his auxiliary bishop, he was assigned the title of Titular Bishop of Sebastopolis and was consecrated in Westminster Cathedral on the 5 August 1909. Coming to Manchester he initially resided at Xaverian College until 1912 when he returned to St. Bede's College as Rector. In 1915 he took up residence at St Joseph's College, Upholland near Wigan.

It also led to formation of an counter group called Americans for Democratic Action (ADA), formed in January 1947 with progressive domestic views but anti-communist and interventionist foreign policy views, that split liberals and nearly cost Harry S. Truman the 1948 US Presidential Election. The organization was dissolved in 1948. History In 1944, Elinor S. Gimbel founded a Popular Front group called the Non-Partisan Committee to support Franklin Delano Roosevelt's 1940 presidential campaign. That committee folded into the National Citizens Political Action Committee (NC-PAC), an arm of the Congress of Industrial Organizations - Political Action Committee (or CIO-PAC). Anita McCormick Blaine was also a major supporter of the NC-PAC. Meanwhile, in 1946 (recalled Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., an opponent of the PCA, in a 2002 memoir) the Communist Party USA under Eugene Dennis had decided to create a third party for the 1948 presidential election. Bella Dodd described some of those CPUSA decisions in her 1954 memoir. Guided by Herbert Croly, founder of The New Republic magazine, the PCA formed from the NC-PAC and the Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions (ICCASP). The primary driver for their merger was funding: rather than compete for the same pool, they would merge. Former US Vice President Henry A. Wallace and former New York City Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia spoke at the PCA's founding convention in December 1946. The Montana Farmers Union (MFU) and the Montana Council for Progressive Political Action (MCPPA) were some of the first organizations to endorse the PCA. Within six months of operations, the PCA had gained some 25,000 members. The PCA opposed the Truman Doctrine and Loyalty Boards; it gave limited, qualified support to the Marshall Plan. The ADA fully supported the Marshall Plan. Otherwise, \\"ADA and PCA were in substantial agreement on domestic issues.\\" By Summer 1947, the PCA had decided to make Henry A. Wallace its candidate for US president. By June 21, 1947, the House Un-American Activities Committee held its first hearing about the PCA. From July 9 to July 13, 1947, the Southern California Chapter of the PCA held a Thought Control Conference at the Beverly Hills Hotel that was sponsored by the Arts, Sciences and Professions Council of the PCA. The conference was in response to what the Chapter saw as \\"an alarming trend to control the cultural life of the American people.\\"Koch, Howard. \\"Introduction\\" p. 2. Thought Control in U.S.A., copyright 1947, Harold J. Salemson, editor. Among the known attendees and participants were people considered to be professionals and experts in their fields at the time (and a few to this day). Many were also well-known and included several Hollywood stars.ibid On October 15, 1947, Eleanor Roosevelt attacked the PCA in her \\"My Day\\" column: > It is a strange thing that groups of our own citizens, supposedly liberals, > and the new (old) Information Bureau of the Communist Parties of Europe, > which we ordinarily allude to as the Comintern, are condemning with one > voice the Marshall proposals!... Our own section of liberals who, with the > Progressive Citizens of America, follow so closely the arguments put out by > the Comintern do themselves harm, for they offer nothing constructive and > this increases in many less radical but liberal groups the sense of > suspicion and uncertainty regarding the influences under which they operate. In 1948, the PCA backed Henry A. Wallace as candidate for US President of a new, third iteration of an American Progressive Party (the two proceeding Progressive parties being nicknamed the \\"Bull Moose Party of 1912 and the LaFolette Party of 1924). By January 1948, with Wallace as its candidate, the PCA claimed to have some 100,000 members. During Summer 1948, William Z. Foster, head of the CPUSA, came out in favor of Wallace. The PCA was unwillingly responsible in part for the final downfall of Popular Front organizations, as its counterpart ADA \\"attracted liberal intellectuals who wanted to purge the left of all Communist Party influences. Its militant opposition to the PCA deliver the coup de grace.\\" The ADA did so by characterizing the PCA as an \\"unholy alliance of Communists and reactionaries.\\" In February 1948, the PCA merged with the \\"Independent Progressive Party\\" (at least in California).

Kenny, John Howard Lawson, Harold Orr, Dr. Linus Pauling, and Frank Tuttle. Actor Edward G. Robinson was a vocal PCA member. Lillian Hellman, Dashiell Hammett, and Elinor S. Gimbel were members and at some point vice chairs. James Cagney, Frank Sinatra, Bette Davis, Olivia de Havilland, Agnes de Mille, Paul Robeson, Lena Horne, and Canada Lee were members. Southern California attorney Edward Mosk was also an active member. Mrs. S. Glidden Loomis was a member of the Legislative Committee in New York City for the PCA. Chester Kinsey of the Montana PCA led the Wallace campaign in that state. In 1947‚Äì1948, Robert M. Lindner served as the Maryland state chairman of the PCA, which then became the state organization for Henry A. Wallace's quixotic 1948 third-party presidential campaign. In 1948 he was added to the national board of the PCA.\\"P.C.A. Votes to Join Third Party\\", Baltimore Sun, Jan. 19, 1948, pg. 1. On February 21, 1950, actor Gregory Peck testified that he had been a PCA member and had resigned when offered to join its executive board, at which time he learned more about how its \\"true aims and activities were subversive.\\" On September 17, 1954, Mrs. Lynn Akerstein testified in Los Angeles that she had joined the PCA in June 1947 as an executive secretary, where she stayed until February 1948. At that time, the PCA merged with the Independent Progressive Party, and Akerstein rolled over as county director. She also stated that the CPUSA influenced the PCA \\"to very little extent.\\" Funding Major funding for the PCA came from Anita McCormick Blaine of Chicago (a daughter and heiress of Cyrus McCormick) and Elinor S. Gimbel (wife of Louis S. Gimbel Jr., an heir of the Gimbel brothers department store). Lesser funding came from Lillian Hellman and Norman Mailer.

It was produced and directed by Hugo Grimaldi and Arthur C. Pierce (without a credit for Pierce as director). The film stars George Nader, Barbara Nichols, George Macready and Dolores Faith. The narrative follows a very tall space alien (Richard Kiel) who has come to earth at the command of the \\"Intergalactic Council\\" to replace select humans with \\"android doppelg√§ngers.\\" The goal of human duplication is to take over the earth, but the plan fails when the androids are destroyed by an investigator from the US National Intelligence Agency. The Human Duplicators was shown in the US on a double feature with Mutiny in Outer Space. Plot Aboard a spacecraft heading toward earth, the head of the \\"Intergalactic Council\\" (Ted Durant) briefs Dr. Kolos (Richard Kiel), a gigantic humanoid alien, on his part to \\"expand our galaxy domination program.\\" If Kolos succeeds, human duplicates - androids - will begin taking over. If he fails, he will be destroyed. After arriving via \\"teletransporter\\" at the mansion of Dr. Vaughan Dornheimer (George Macready), Kolos encounters Dornheimer's blind niece, Lisa (Dolores Faith). Not realizing that he's an extraterrestrial, she take Kolos to Dornheimer's laboratory. Kolos tells Dornheimer that together they will develop the sophisticated androids that Dornheimer is unable to create on his own. Dornheimer refuses, but Kolos makes it clear that he is now \\"the master\\" and that he will be obeyed. The police, meanwhile, are stymied by multiple thefts from high-security electronics facilities, apparently perpetrated by the \\"top scientists\\" who work at them. Most baffling of all is Dr. Munson (Walter Abel). After being admitted to his facility, he tears a security door off it hinges with his bare hands and kills a guard. He then ignores shouted warnings to halt by a second guard, who shoots him four times in the back. Munson neither flinches nor bleeds, just gets into his car and calmly drives off as if nothing unusual has happened. He's an android, although the police don't know it. Glenn Martin (George Nader) of the National Intelligence Agency (NIA) takes over the case. Glenn fails to find out anything by posing as a reporter, although he meets Lisa. He later sneaks into Dornheimer's lab and witnesses human duplication. Lisa tells him that Dornheimer has been replaced by an android. As she leaves, Glenn is attacked by an android version of Dornheimer's servant Thor (John Indrisano). In the ensuing fight, Glenn smashes android Thor's fragile head, destroying him. Kolos hauls Glenn off to be duplicated. After duplication, android Glenn returns to NIA headquarters, where Gale Wilson (Barbara Nichols), Glenn's girlfriend and fellow agent, notices his oddly cold behavior. She wonders if Glenn is an android and decides to tail him. Android Glenn goes to a facility to steal additional electronics. He is interrupted by Gale, then gets into a gunfight with the police, during which his arm is trapped in a sliding door. When the police yank the door open, expecting to arrest the real Glenn, all they find is android Glenn's arm. He has torn it off and escaped. The real Glenn is locked in a cell with the real Dornheimer. Lisa brings Glenn his \\"lucky coin,\\" which contains a wire that he can use to cut through the cell's bars. She is then dragged away by two android lab assistants. As he saws the bars, the real Dornheimer tells him that he can destroy the androids by zapping their heads with the lab's \\"pulse laser beam.\\" Android Dornheimer unexpectedly proclaims himself head of the android \\"master race\\" and has Kolos chained to a wall by the half-dozen android Thors it takes to overpower him, then begins the process of duplicating Lisa. But suddenly android Glenn returns, interrupting the duplication. Still loyal to Kolos, android Glenn refuses to accept android Dornheimer as master. They fight, destroying each other. The real Glenn zaps the remaining androids as Kolos breaks free of his chains. After the androids have been destroyed, Kolos gently places the unconscious Lisa on a sofa. Her eyelids flutter open. She puts a hand to the corner of one eye and smiles. Has Kolos somehow restored her vision? Kolos says that his mission has failed and, sadly, he has learned that he too is an android. He teletransports back aboard the spaceship, presumably to meet his doom at the hands of the Intergalactic Council.

Production  The Human Duplicators' interior shots were filmed at Producers Studio in Hollywood. Exterior locations were Bronson Canyon in Griffith Park in Los Angeles and a school located at 5210 Clinton St. in LA, which was used as the Space Research Corp. building where the scientists work. The exact dates of filming could not be found, but the film was copyrighted by Hugo Grimaldi Productions on 21 October 1964. In The Overlook Film Encyclopedia: Science Fiction, British film scholar Phil Hardy lists the movie as an American-Italian co-production made by Woolner Brothers and Independenti Regionali. It was one of two such co- productions directed by Grimaldi and released in 1965, the other being its companion film Mutiny in Outer Space. Why Richard Kiel's name was not included on the movie poster remains a mystery, although the packaging of a VHS tape of unknown date identifies the film's stars as \\"Richard 'Jaws' Kiel and Hugh 'Ward Cleaver' Beaumont.\\" The film was Beaumont's final picture before retiring from acting. Release The Human Duplicators was the color first feature on a double bill with the black-and-white Mutiny in Outer Space. The film was released in the US on 3 March 1965 and at an unspecified date the same year in Canada. It opened in Mexico on 14 December 1967 as Humanoides asesinos (\\"Humanoids, murderers\\"). A day later in West Germany, where Nader was well known for playing \\"tough FBI agent Jerry Cotton in eight highly successful but rubbishy crime thrillers\\" it premiered as FBI jagt Phantom (\\"FBI hunts Phantom\\"). The movie was released to theaters in Italy as Agente Spaziale K-1 (\\"Space Agent K-1\\") and in France as Les Cr√©atures de Kolos (\\"The Creatures of Kolos\\"). In Belgium it was shown under both the French title and the Dutch title Schepsels van Kolos (\\"Creatures of Kolos\\"). The film was also released theatrically in Brazil, Greece and Spain. In France, the video version's title was Kolos, l'agent cosmique (\\"Kolos, the Cosmic Agent\\"). One of the titles used for a VHS of the movie in the US was Jaws of the Alien. Kiel appeared as the character Jaws in The Spy Who Loved Me (1977) and Moonraker (1979). The movie was theatrically released in the US by Woolner Brothers Pictures Inc., by International Film Distributors in Canada and by Regal Films International in the UK. Distribution in the US switched to Allied Artists in 1966 and 40 years later, in 2006, the American company Better Television Distribution had acquired the world-wide TV syndication rights. For personal home viewing, VHS tapes of The Human Duplicators were released in the 1980s by Joy Home Video in West Germany and at unknown dates by International Video Entertainment, ThrillerVideo and Star Classics Video in the US. It is the Star Classics VHS that's titled Jaws of the Alien.  Reception  The Human Duplicators has not received particularly good reviews from critics over the years. \\"Whit\\" reviewed the film for the 19 May 1965 issue of Variety and called it \\"an okay entry in its field.\\" He wrote that there was little new in the plot, but that it \\"generates enough interest to pass in minor situations\\" and has \\"exploitation value\\" for theater owners. \\"Whit\\" was somewhat complimentary about the production crew, noting that \\"Don Wolf's editing is fairly fast.\\" Phil Hardy, the British film scholar, calls the movie a \\"confused and over-ambitious offering from Grimaldi.\\" He says that The Human Duplicators \\"marks the beginnings of a return to the technical gimmickry of the thirties. Thus, fittingly, it stars Kiel who became one of the more bizarre jokes in the later James Bond films, which were the ultimate in technological gadgetry.\\" Current-day British critic Steven Puchalski refers to the film as a \\"colourful dose of swill\\" with a \\"silly plot and comical goofiness going for it.\\" He makes specific mention of the special effects, sarcastically noting that \\"The highly technical duplication process involves the victims standing in a circular cage while red and blue lights flash at them,\\" after which \\"they sit under clear plastic hair dryers until their brains harden.\\" He adds that for unknown reasons the androids have heads made of plaster, \\"so whenever they're knocked on the noggin, their skulls crack open and Erector Set pieces tumble out. Oops! Design flaw, indeed ....\\" Kiel himself seems to have had mixed feelings about the film. He said in an interview with American film scholar Tom Weaver that the film \\"was a big hit in Chicago,\\" where it played \\"in like 27 theaters\\" simultaneously. Kiel made personal appearances at theaters that were showing the movie in Chicago and said that they were so successful that he was asked to do the same in Toronto. But he told interviewer Maggie Howard in 2009 that \\"The way the director wanted me to act - kind of robotic - didn't come off as well as I would have liked.\\" In popular culture The Human Duplicators was shown as Episode 6 of Season 3 of Elvira's Movie Macabre, which first aired on 5 August 1984. The film was later featured in a season 4 episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 originally telecast on 26 December 1992. User ratings of the film have been poor. Rotten Tomatoes gives the movie a score of 1.9/5 based on 291 user ratings and 0 percent for \\"those who liked it.\\" IMDb's score is 2.9/10 based on 503 user ratings.

At the turn of the 20th century the Isle of Man was a hugely popular holiday destination with the working class factory workers from the northerly part of England and Douglas Head had many attractions, most of which have long since disappeared. One such attraction was the amphitheatre which remains in situ today after many years of neglect. On this stage there took place many shows including minstrels, pierrots, etc., all of which were ideal forms of entertainment to the discerning holidaymaker to the island and the popularity of the shows can be seen from the large number of concrete steps still extant which formed the seating (although wooden slats were once added to this). Cine footage exists of these entertainments but the popularity of the headland as a destination never really picked up after the war, with several of the other attractions being closed in 1939 and never re-opening, most notably the spectacular tramway which ran on the roadway alongside the stage. Although not used for a great number of years, the stage area was still periodically maintained, receiving a coat of paint every so often. Isle of Man Film Festival 2015 Until 2015 the amphitheatre had lain disused since the last organised entertainment which had taken place on the site in 1993 as part of the island's Year Of Railways in celebration of the centenary of the Manx Electric Railway. The use of the amphitheatre was revived as part of the 2015 Isle of Man Film Festival. Used as the venue for the opening night of the festival, the amphitheatre played host to a screening of the cult film The Goonies, with those in attendance including the film critic Mark Kermode.http://www.chrystals.co.im/uploads/iomff2015flyer.pdf Judged a success, it is hoped that the future screening of films under the stars during the summer months will lead to a new lease of life for the venue.

The condition is named after the Swedish mathematician Lars H√∂rmander. Definition Given two C1 vector fields V and W on d-dimensional Euclidean space Rd, let [V, W] denote their Lie bracket, another vector field defined by :[V, W] (x) = \\\\mathrm{D} V(x) W(x) - \\\\mathrm{D} W(x) V(x), where DV(x) denotes the Fr√©chet derivative of V at x ‚àà Rd, which can be thought of as a matrix that is applied to the vector W(x), and vice versa. Let A0, A1, ... An be vector fields on Rd. They are said to satisfy H√∂rmander's condition if, for every point x ‚àà Rd, the vectors :\\\\begin{align} &A;_{j_0} (x)~,\\\\\\\\\\\\ &[A_{j_{0}} (x), A_{j_{1}} (x)]~,\\\\\\\\\\\\ & A_{j_{0}} (x), A_{j_{1}} (x)], A_{j_{2}} (x)]~,\\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\quad\\\\vdots\\\\quad \\\\end{align} \\\\qquad 0 \\\\leq j_{0}, j_{1}, \\\\ldots, j_{n} \\\\leq n span Rd. They are said to satisfy the parabolic H√∂rmander condition if the same holds true, but with the index j_0 taking only values in 1,...,n.  Application to stochastic differential equations  Consider the stochastic differential equation (SDE) :\\\\operatorname dx = A_0(x) \\\\operatorname dt + \\\\sum_{i=1}^n A_i(x) \\\\circ \\\\operatorname dW_i where the vectors fields A_0,\\\\dotsc,A_n are assumed to have bounded derivative, (W_1,\\\\dotsc,W_n) the normalized n-dimensional Brownian motion and \\\\circ\\\\operatorname d stands for the Stratonovich integral interpretation of the SDE. H√∂rmander's theorem asserts that if the SDE above satisfies the parabolic H√∂rmander condition, then its solutions admit a smooth density with respect to Lebesgue measure. Application to the Cauchy problem With the same notation as above, define a second-order differential operator F by :F = \\\\frac1{2} \\\\sum_{i = 1}^n A_i^2 + A_0. An important problem in the theory of partial differential equations is to determine sufficient conditions on the vector fields Ai for the Cauchy problem :\\\\begin{cases} \\\\dfrac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} (t, x) = F u(t, x), & t > 0, x \\\\in \\\\mathbf{R}^{d}; \\\\\\\\\\\\ u(t, \\\\cdot) \\\\to f, & \\\\text{as } t \\\\to 0; \\\\end{cases} to have a smooth fundamental solution, i.e. a real-valued function p (0, +‚àû) √ó R2d ‚Üí R such that p(t, ¬∑, ¬∑) is smooth on R2d for each t and :u(t, x) = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{R}^{d}} p(t, x, y) f(y) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} y satisfies the Cauchy problem above. It had been known for some time that a smooth solution exists in the elliptic case, in which :A_{i} = \\\\sum_{j = 1}^{d} a_{ji} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x_{j}}, and the matrix A = (aji), 1 ‚â§ j ‚â§ d, 1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ n is such that AA‚àó is everywhere an invertible matrix. The great achievement of H√∂rmander's 1967 paper was to show that a smooth fundamental solution exists under a considerably weaker assumption: the parabolic version of the condition that now bears his name.  Application to control systems  Let M be a smooth manifold and A_0,\\\\dotsc,A_n be smooth vector fields on M.

It opened in 2006 and is the first purpose-built women's prison in New Zealand; there are two older women's prisons. About 6 per cent of the New Zealand prisoner population is female. The facility houses about 330 prisoners including remand prisoners - alleged criminals not yet sentenced - as well as normal sentenced prisoners. It has a specialist unit for mothers and babies. A small number of women give birth while serving a sentence of imprisonment and others have young children at the time of sentencing. Some prisoners with babies (up to nine months) may be eligible to live in the mothers and babies unit.

Nicknamed the \\"Jumbo Prince\\", Davies played a total of 390 games throughout his career (317 for Sturt, 33 for South Adelaide, 20 for Hawthorn, and 20 State Games for South Australia. Though not tall for a ruckman at only 188 cm (6'2\\"), Davies was known for his strong marking and body strength which he used to great effect against opponents who were often taller and heavier than him. Playing career Rick Davies' senior career began with Sturt in 1970 at age 18. He went on to be named as Sturt‚Äôs best and fairest player in a record seven of the eight seasons he played for the Double Blues. One of Davies' most noteworthy performances was his dominant display in the 1976 Grand Final victory against Port Adelaide. Davies was judged best on ground on the day when the all-time SANFL record attendance was set when 66,897 fans crammed into Football Park. In 1981 Davies joined Hawthorn in the VFL. Changes to rules for rucking contests disadvantaged shorter ruckman, and Davies mostly played in the forward pocket, kicking 37 goals. He returned to Sturt in 1982 and was their leading goal kicker for the next three seasons. In 1983 Davies kicked an SANFL record 151 goals for the season (later beaten in 1990 by Scott Hodges of Port Adelaide who kicked 153), which included 11 goals in a 114-point win over Port Adelaide at the Unley Oval, and a club record 15 against West Adelaide in round eight at Football Park (this would be only one goal shy of Football Park‚Äôs all-time record of 16 goals in a match by Woodville‚Äôs John Roberts in 1976). Davies would play his last Grand Final for Sturt later in the 1983 season when the Double Blues went down to West Adelaide. After averaging over 6 goals per game in 1983, Davies was restricted by Tony Burgess to only two in the Grand Final, with his first in the 3rd quarter making him the first player to ever kick 150 goals in a SANFL season, beating Tim Evans‚Äô record of 146 from 1980. Rick Davies‚Äô form at full forward for Sturt in 1983 was such that he kept Sturt's young goal kicking hotshot Ian Wilmott playing in the reserves for most of the season. Wilmott, who kicked 97 goals for the season in the SANFL Reserves (plus another two in a disappointing finals series), played only one game of league football in 1983 in Round 10 against Norwood at the Norwood Oval, kicking six goals in his league debut (while Davies was on state duty with the South Australian team in Perth). The next week Davies returned to the side while Wilmott was back in the reserves team. After again leading Sturt‚Äôs goal kicking in 1984, Davies moved to South Adelaide in 1985, and became playing coach later that season when former Hawthorn teammate Don Scott was sacked. The Panthers finished eighth in 1985 and ninth in 1986, with Davies leading goalkicker with 72 goals in each season from full forward. He retired as a player at the end of the 1986 season, with a SANFL total of 350 league appearances and 781 goals over 16 seasons. Representative career Rick Davies was a regular interstate representative, with 20 appearances for South Australia from 1973 until 1983, captaining the State in 1979 and 1980. In 1980 Davies was named as captain of the All Australian team. Coaching career Rick Davies stayed on as non- playing coach of South Adelaide in 1987. The Panthers finished last and Davies was replaced as coach. In September 1988 he was named as coach of Sturt after Mervyn Keane's controversial departure.Lysikatos, John; True blue: the history of the Sturt Football Club; pp. 302-303. Sturt had finished fifth under Keane in 1988 but finished last in 1989 under Davies, who resigned following Sturt's 132-point loss to Glenelg in their last match.The Advertiser, 11 September 1989, p. 40 The Double Blues continued to struggle after Davies resigned, not recovering until after eight consecutive wooden spoons and a winless 1995 season. Awards and achievements Rick Davies was awarded Life Membership as a player of the Sturt Football Club in 1977. His 781 SANFL goals ranks 5th on the all-time list and his 151 goals in 1983 broke the record of 146 set in 1980 by Port Adelaide's Tim Evans, before being bettered by Port's Scott Hodges who kicked 153 in 1990. He was one of 113 inaugural inductees into the South Australian Football Hall of Fame in 2002 and his 350 SANFL games for Sturt and South Adelaide qualified him for SANFL Player Life Membership.SA Football HoF - E R (Rick) Davies Davies was named in Sturt's \\"Team of the Century\\" as 1st Ruck and forward.Sturt Team of the Century In 2013 Davies was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame at a gala dinner in Canberra.

Under the Childers Reforms it amalgamated with the 105th Regiment of Foot (Madras Light Infantry) to form the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry in 1881.Wickes, HL Regiments of Foot (1974) History =Early history= John Moore, who was the regiment's commanding officer at the Siege of Toulon in autumn 1793 and the Siege of Calvi in July 1794, by Thomas Lawrence Monument to the Battle of Villinghausen in July 1761 The regiment was formed by Lieutenant General Robert Napier as the 53rd (Napier's) Regiment of Foot in 1755 for service in the Seven Years' War. The regiment started out in Exeter but was transferred to Leeds later in the same year. In the space of one month, 800 men had volunteered to serve for three years or as long as the country needed them to. It was re-ranked as the 51st (Brudenell's) Regiment of Foot, following the disbandment of the existing 50th and 51st regiments, in 1757. The regiment's first action was when it embarked on ships and took part in the Raid on Rochefort in September 1757 during the Seven Years' War. The regiment embarked for Germany in 1758 and saw action at the Battle of Minden in August 1759, the Battle of Corbach in July 1760 and the Battle of Warburg later that month as well as the Battle of Kloster Kampen in October 1760, the Battle of Villinghausen in July 1761 and the Battle of Wilhelmsthal in June 1762. After returning home in spring 1763, the regiment was posted for garrison duty in Ireland later in the year. It embarked for Menorca in 1771 but was captured by a French invading force in January 1782 and only released five months later. It adopted a county designation and became the 51st (2nd Yorkshire West Riding) Regiment in August 1782. The regiment embarked for Gibraltar in 1792 for service in the French Revolutionary Wars, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel John Moore, and took part in the Siege of Toulon in autumn 1793 and the Siege of Calvi in July 1794. =Napoleonic Wars= In early 1800 the East Indiaman Earl Cornwallis, transported the regiment to Ceylon, where it saw action in the Kandyan Wars. After returning home in 1807, it embarked for Portugal in October 1808 for service in the Peninsular War and saw action at the Battle of Corunna in January 1809 before being evacuated from the Peninsula. It became a light infantry regiment as the 51st (2nd Yorkshire West Riding) Regiment of Foot (Light Infantry) in May 1809. It then embarked for the Netherlands in summer 1809 and saw action in the disastrous Walcheren Campaign. The Hangman's Tower at Badajoz, the objective of the siege by men from the regiment, led by Ensign Joseph Dyas, in summer 1811 The regiment returned to the Portugal in 1811 and took part in the Battle of Fuentes de O√±oro in May 1811, the Second Siege of Badajoz in summer 1811 and the Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo in January 1812. At Badajoz Ensign Joseph Dyas, a junior officer in the regiment, distinguished himself by twice leading the storming party on the San Cristobal Fort. The regiment went on to fight at the Battle of Salamanca in July 1812, the Siege of Burgos in September 1812 and the Battle of Vitoria in June 1813. It then pursued the French Army into France and fought at the Battle of the Pyrenees in July 1813, the Battle of Nivelle in November 1813 and the Battle of the Nive in December 1813 as well as the Battle of Orthez in February 1814. It then returned to England in June 1814. Following Napoleon's escape from Elba in February 1815, it embarked for Ostend in March 1815 and fought at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815. At Waterloo the regiment prevented 100 French cuirassiers from escaping the field of battle. =The Victorian era= The regiment traveled to Australia in detachments as escorts to prisoners in 1837 and then moved on to India in 1846. From there it was deployed to Burma and saw action at Pegu in 1852 during the Second Anglo-Burmese War. Although it returned to England in 1854, it was deployed to India again in 1857 to help suppress the Indian Rebellion and was still in India for the Ambela Campaign in 1863. It was also from India that it was deployed to Afghanistan in autumn 1878 and saw action at the Battle of Ali Masjid in November 1878 during the Second Anglo-Afghan War. As part of the Cardwell Reforms of the 1870s, where single-battalion regiments were linked together to share a single depot and recruiting district in the United Kingdom, the 51st was linked with the 105th Regiment of Foot (Madras Light Infantry), and assigned to district no. 8 at Pontefract Barracks in the West Riding of Yorkshire. On 1 July 1881 the Childers Reforms came into effect and the regiment amalgamated with the 105th Regiment of Foot (Madras Light Infantry) to form the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry.

The regiment first saw active service during the American War of Independence, and were posted to India during the Anglo-Mysore Wars. During the Napoleonic Wars, the 52nd were part of the Light Division, and were present at most major battles of the Peninsula campaign, becoming one of the most celebrated regiments, described by Sir William Napier as \\"a regiment never surpassed in arms since arms were first borne by men\\".Napier, p. 279 They had the largest British battalion at Waterloo, 1815, where they formed part of the final charge against Napoleon's Imperial Guard. They were also involved in various campaigns in India. The regiment was raised as a line regiment in 1755 and numbered as the \\"54th Foot\\"; they were renumbered as the \\"52nd Regiment of Foot\\" in 1757. In 1781, the regional designation \\"52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot\\" was given and in 1803 the regiment was designated \\"Light Infantry\\". In 1881, the regiment was merged with the 43rd (Monmouthshire) Regiment of Foot to become the regiment later known as the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry. Regimental structure Throughout the period of the 52nd's existence, the British Army comprised both infantry and cavalry line regiments, as well as the Household Divisions. The regiments of the line were numbered and, from 1781, were given territorial designations ‚Äì \\"Oxfordshire\\" in the 52nd's case ‚Äì which roughly represented the area from which troops were drawn. This was not rigid, and most English regiments had a significant proportion of Irish and Scots.Haythornthwaite (1987), p. 6 Regiments comprised at least one battalion, often two ‚Äì as the 52nd did intermittently ‚Äì and occasionally more. Commanded by a lieutenant colonel, an infantry battalion was composed of ten companies, of which eight were \\"centre\\" companies, and two flank companies: one a grenadier and one (in regular line regiments) a specialist light company. Companies were commanded by captains, with lieutenants and ensigns (or subalterns) beneath him. Ideally, a battalion comprised 1000 men (excluding NCOs, musicians and officers); the 1st (or senior) battalion of a regiment would frequently draw fit recruits from the 2nd battalion to maintain its strength. If also sent on active service, the 2nd battalion would consequently be weaker. In periods of long service, battalions were generally operating under strength.Haythornthwaite (1987), p. 7 Seriously under-strength battalions might be dissolved, or temporarily drafted into other regiments, as happened to the 52nd on several occasions. The 52nd was initially a one-battalion regiment, but increased recruiting resulted in the creation of a second battalion in 1798. While the 1st Battalion saw some action in Spain and Portugal in 1800‚Äì1801, the 2nd remained stationed in England. In 1803 the regiment's fittest officers and men were concentrated in the 1st battalion, for training as light infantry, and the 2nd battalion was transferred to the 96th Foot. A new second battalion was raised in 1804. Both battalions saw extensive action during the Napoleonic Wars, and they were brigaded together for a time during the Peninsula Campaign, but heavy losses at Badajoz in 1812 resulted in the reduction of the 2nd battalion to a cadre (skeleton staff). The 2nd was eventually reformed with new recruits and saw service in Holland in 1813‚Äì14. Following the conclusion of the war in 1814, both battalions were billeted in England, where the 2nd's effectives were transferred to the 1st battalion, in preparation for further service.Wilkinson-Latham & Roffe, p. 11 The 2/52nd remained in England during the Waterloo Campaign, and were disbanded in 1815. Subsequently, the 52nd remained a one-battalion regiment until their merger with the 43rd. Light infantry Initially raised as a regular line regiment, the 52nd fought in the line during the American wars and the early Indian campaigns, and did not become a light regiment until 1803. Prior to this, the British Army had relied on irregulars and mercenaries to provide most of its light infantry or, when conditions demanded it, temporarily seconded regular line companies.Chappell, pp. 6‚Äì7 While regular regiments were required to include one company of light infantry from 1758, the training of such light troops was inconsistent, and frequently inadequate.Chappell, pp 6,9 Consequently, when beginning a restructure of the British Army in the late 18th century, the Duke of York recognised a need for dedicated light troops, especially coming into a war against Napoleon and his experienced light infantry, the chasseurs.Chappell, pp. 8, 10 During the early war against the French, the British Army was bolstered by light infantry mercenaries from Germany and the Low Countries, but the British light infantry companies proved inadequate against the more effective French tirailleurs during the Flanders campaign, and in the Netherlands in 1799, and infantry reform became urgent.Chappell, pp. 9‚Äì10 Map of Shorncliffe Camp - 1801. In 1801, the \\"Experimental Corps of Riflemen\\" was raised (later designated the 95th Rifles), and a decision was made to train some line regiments in light infantry techniques, so they might operate as both light and line infantry. Sir John Moore, a proponent of the light infantry model, suggested that his own regiment of line infantry, the 52nd, undergo this training, at Shorncliffe Camp.Chappell, p. 11 They were followed shortly afterwards by the 43rd Foot, by whose side they would fight many campaigns as part of the Light Division. Several other famous line regiments were designated \\"light infantry\\" in 1808, such as the 85th, or The King's Regiment of Light Infantry (Bucks Volunteers). Moore wrote of the 52nd in his diary that \\"it is evident that not only the officers, but that each individual soldier, knows perfectly what he has to do; the discipline is carried on without severity, the officers are attached to the men and the men to the officers.\\"quoted in Glover, p. 74 This had much to do with the method of training; unlike other regiments, light infantry officers drilled with the men and were expected to be familiar with drill routines, including weapons training.Chappell, p. 13 The ranks also received additional training, and were encouraged to develop initiative and self-direction; while skirmishing in the field they would need to react without direct orders. While most regiments of the time fought in tight formation, allowing easy administration of orders, light infantry worked in small groups, in advance of the main line, so complicated bugle calls were developed to pass orders.Chappell, p. 15 Consequently, the bugle became the emblem of the light infantry regiments. When skirmishing, light infantry fought in pairs, so that one soldier could cover the other while loading. Line regiments fired in volleys, but skirmishers fired at will, taking careful aim at targets.Chappell, pp. 14‚Äì15 While some consideration was given to equipping light infantry with rifles, due to their improved accuracy, the expected difficulty and expense in obtaining sufficient rifled weapons resulted in the standard infantry musket being issued to most troops. The accuracy of the musket decreased at long range and, since the French chasseurs and voltigeurs also used muskets, it is likely that skirmishers' firefights took place at ranges of only 50 yards (or less). 10 yards provided the accuracy of point-blank range.Chappell, pp 15‚Äì16 Although the French infantry (and, earlier, the Americans) frequently used multi-shot and grapeshot in their muskets, the British light infantry used only standard ball ammunition.Chappell, p. 14 Light infantry were equipped more lightly than regular line regiments, and marched at 140 paces per minute.Wickes, p. 78 Tasks of the light infantry included advance and rear guard action, flanking protection for armies and forward skirmishing. They were also called upon to take regular line formations during battles, or to act as part of fortification storming parties. During the Peninsular War they were regarded as the army's elite corps. Regimental history =Early history= The 52nd began as a standard infantry line regiment in 1755, when Colonel Hedworth Lambton received papers to raise a new regiment, to be numbered as the 54th Foot. It was renumbered as the \\"52nd Regiment of Foot\\" in 1757,Wickes, p. 77 and was stationed in England and Ireland.Wilkinson-Latham & Roffe, p. 4 (At the same time, the previous 52nd Foot was renamed the 50th Foot.) In 1765, the Regiment was posted to Canada.Light Infantry.org 52nd Foot Timeline The regiment, under the command of Colonel John Clavering, departed Cork, Ireland aboard the transport Pitt, for Quebec. En route the ship ran aground in dense fog in the Gulf of St Lawrence, near the coast of Nova Scotia; the wreck remained intact enough for all on board, including the soldiers' wives, to disembark safely, transferring their effects and regimental provisions to shore.Smith, p. 5 General Murray, Governor of Quebec, sent a schooner to retrieve the personnel and belongings, and carry them to Quebec.Smith, p. 6 Bunker Hill, 1775, by Howard Pyle, showing a battalion with buff facings, as worn by the 52nd and 22nd Foot =American War of Independence= Twenty years after its founding, the regiment saw active service in the American War of Independence, from 1774 to 1778. The 52nd was shipped to America from Canada, arriving in Boston, and fought in the battles of Lexington and Bunker Hill in 1775. Major-General William Howe led the main assault at Bunker Hill with Brigadier Robert Pigot leading the 52nd and 43rd Foot in support.Hibbert (1990), p. 53 This was the first occasion that the 52nd fought alongside the 43rd.Wilkinson-Latham & Roffe, p.3 They suffered heavy casualties at Bunker Hill, and in their grenadier company, only 8 men were left unwounded. In August, 1778, the men were drafted into other regiments and the officers returned to England.British Orderly Books, RevWar75.com The regiment obtained new recruits and in 1782 the introduction of county titles for regiments resulted in the 52nd adding \\"Oxfordshire\\" to their name. =Indian Wars= In 1783, the 52nd arrived in Madras, for nine years of war spanning the Second and Third Anglo-Mysore Wars. The Second War had begun in 1778, when the British responded to news of war against France by moving against French-held bases in India. Hyder Ali, then ruler of Mysore, sided with the French and marched against the British.Haythorthwaite (1995), p. 69 Hyder died in 1782, and was succeeded by his son, Tippu Sultan, who continued the war through some minor campaigns until a peace treaty was signed in 1784.Haythornthwaite (1995), p. 70 Shortly afterwards, a detachment from the 52nd took part in the 1785 siege of Cannanore. The 52nd stormed the breach at Cannanore, under command of Sir Martin Hunter. In 1786, Lord Cornwallis was appointed Governor-general, and the war against Tippu Sultan was resumed after Tippu attacked British allies in 1789. (This was known as the Third Mysore war). Initially, military actions were fairly minor. In 1790, the 52nd were involved at Pollighautcherry and in a battle near Seringapatam.Philippart, p. 234 In 1791, the regiment fought at Bangalore in March, and Arakere (near Seringapatam) in May.Baker, pp. 256‚Äì7 In December that year, the flank companies from the 52nd and 76th Foot, with sepoy grenadiers, formed the storming party during the assault on Savandroog; the defenders abandoned the fortress, and it was successfully taken at the cost of just one British soldier wounded. Throughout the assault, the band of the 52nd played to spur on the attackers.Haythornthwaite (1995), p. 71 The 52nd were also present at the February 1792 siege of Seringapatam, where the battalion's grenadier company received heavy casualties while crossing the Kaveri River.The Gentleman's Magazine Vol XLV, p. 425 During that battle, the 52nd came to the aid of Lord Cornwallis, whose companies were exposed and in danger of capture. Tippu Sultan sued for peace during the siege, and a treaty was signed in 1792, ending the war. However, in August 1793 the regiment took part in an assault on Pondicherry. =French Revolutionary Wars= In 1793 war broke out with Revolutionary France. Following the French occupation of the Netherlands in January 1795 and the creation of the Batavian Republic, an assault was planned on the Dutch colony at Ceylon. A force commanded by Colonel James Stuart, of the 72nd Foot, and including the 52nd, left India for Ceylon, laying siege to Trincomalee; by February 1796 the island was in British hands.Haythornthwaite (1995), p. 151 The 52nd returned to Britain in 1798 where, bolstered by new recruits, a second battalion was created. In 1800 the 1/52nd took part in the Qiberon Bay, Vigo, Cadiz and Ferrol expeditions and, after short stations in Gibraltar and Lisbon, returned to England in 1801. In January 1803, the regiment's 2nd battalion was transferred into the 96th Foot; prior to the transfer, the fittest men and officers were seconded by the 1st battalion, which was converted into \\"a corps of light infantry\\", and began training under Major-General John Moore (who was also Colonel of the 52nd) at Shorncliffe Camp. They formed a brigade with the 95th Rifles, and three line regiments. Much of the training was undertaken by Lieutenant-Colonel Kenneth MacKenzie, who devised many of the tactics of light infantry training.Chappell, p. 12 A new second battalion was raised in 1804. =Napoleonic Wars= Officer and private of 52nd by C H Hamilton & J C Stadler, 19th century Both battalions of the 52nd experienced active service throughout the Napoleonic Wars, their paths occasionally overlapping. In 1806‚Äì7 the 1st battalion was stationed in Sicily, where they helped train local soldiers; later, they accompanied Moore to Sweden. In August 1806, the 2nd battalion accompanied the expedition to Copenhagen, taking part in the 1807 assault against Copenhagen, which was led by General Wellesley.Chappell, p. 17 The 2/52nd landed in Portugal in August 1808 and, with the 2/43rd, were positioned in the village of Vimeiro to provide cover for the army landings at the nearby Maceira Bay. Three companies of the 2/52nd were posted with the advance guard, and were the first to encounter the enemy during the Battle of Vimeiro. Following the battle the British commander Wellesley was superseded in turn by two superiors, Sir Harry Burrard and Sir Hew Dalrymple respectively, who signed the Convention of Sintra. The three commanders were recalled to England to explain their actions, and the command of the British troops devolved on Sir John Moore, the 52nd's colonel.Chappell, p. 18 In October, Sir John Moore led the army into Spain, reaching as far as Salamanca. In December, they were reinforced by 10,000 troops from England, including the '1st Flank Brigade', which consisted of 1/52nd, 1/43rd and 1/95th and led by Robert Craufurd. Moore's army now totalled 25,000, but his advance was cut short by the news that Napoleon had defeated the Spanish, held Madrid, and was approaching with an army of 200,000. Moore turned his men, and retreated to Corunna, over mountain roads and through bitter winter weather. French cavalry pursued the British Army the length of the journey, and a Reserve Division was set up to provide rearguard protection for the British troops. The core of this Reserve, commanded by Edward Paget, consisted of the 1/52nd and 1/95th battalions,Haythornthwaite (2001), p. 21 who displayed none of the ill-discipline which plagued other regiments during the retreat, but \\"made a stand at every defile and riverline, buying time for the rest of the army to get away.\\"Glover, p. 81 Following the secondment of the 1/52nd and 1/95th to the Reserve, Craufurd's 1st Flank Brigade was reformed, and comprised the 1/43rd, 2/52nd and 2/95th. The 1st Flank Brigade deployed with the Reserve for a time, protecting the crossing of the river Esla near Benavente, before it separated from the Reserve and the main army and marched to Vigo, with over 4,000 other troops, for eventual transportation to England.Glover, p. 82Leach, p. 63 The 1/52nd remained with the main army, which was caught by the French at Corunna. During the ensuing battle, in January 1809, Moore was killed; the army, including the 1/52nd, were evacuated to England. British battles of the Peninsular War = Wellesley's Peninsular Campaign = The 1/52nd, along with 1/43rd and 1/95th, returned to the Peninsula in June 1809, where they were designated the \\"Light Brigade\\", under the command of General Craufurd.Chappell, p. 19 Alighting in Lisbon and hearing of the army's engagement with the French, they undertook a forced march to Talavera, arriving mere hours after the battle. The march was an extraordinary achievement, covering 42 miles in 26 hours, at a time when an infantry march of 15 miles a day was standard.Glover, p. 27 Henceforth, the 1/52nd generally remained in advance of the army, as a forward party, a role which was to be theirs throughout much of the war. In February 1810, Portuguese Cazadores were added to Craufurd's brigade, creating the Light Division, the 1/52nd forming a brigade with 1st Cazadores and four companies from the 95th, under Lt-Col Barclay. While holding a forward outpost, the Light Division was involved in the Battle of the C√¥a, in July 1810, and took part in the Battle of Bussaco, where the Light Division held the left against the main French charge, which they successfully repulsed, inflicting high casualties; 1200 Frenchmen were killed, wounded or captured, while the Light Division suffered only 120 casualties.Chappell, p. 20 When Wellington's army retreated back to the Lines of Torres Vedras, late 1810, the Light Division acted as rearguard.Chappell, p. 21 The French were unable to breach the Torres Vedras defences, but engaged the British army in a number of small skirmishes, such as those fought by the Light Division, under the temporary command of Sir William Erskine, at Casal Novo ‚Äì where they unwittingly came upon 11 French divisions in the fogHistory of War: Combat of Casal Novo ‚Äì and Sabugal (April 1811), an engagement of which Wellington later wrote: \\"I consider that the action that was fought by the Light Division [...] with the whole of the [French] 2nd Corps, to be the most glorious that British troops were ever engaged in.\\" After returning to England in 1809, the 52nd's 2nd battalion had joined the unsuccessful Walcheren Campaign in the Netherlands.Fosten, p. 6 Walcheren was surrounded by marshes, and many of the officers and men came down with \\"Walcheren Fever\\" (malaria), which was to recur for years afterwards, and deplete the strength of the battalion.Chappell, p. 35 They eventually returned to the Peninsula in 1811 and were brigaded with their first battalion, who were manning outposts near Almeida.Chappell, p. 21 In early May, battle was engaged at Fuentes d'Onoro; initially set in the reserve, the Light Division came to the aid of the struggling British 7th Division, and provided a fighting retreat, as Wellington retired his army.Chappell, p. 22 For the rest of the year, both battalions of the 52nd, with the Light Division, manned outposts, which were constantly moved to mark the changing French positions. January 1812 saw the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo. Companies from the Light Division, under the 52nd's Colonel Colborne, captured the Francisco redoubt on 9 January, and thereafter built trenches for the main assault, under enemy fire. Once the army's artillery had breached the walls, a 4-column assault was planned for 19 January, the Light Division forming the column which assaulted the breach near the Convent of San Francisco. Lt John Gurwood of the 52nd led the Forlorn Hope,Glover, p. 181 followed by 300 \\"stormers\\" under the command of the 52nd's Major George Napier.Glover, p. 180 The breach was carried and the fortress was taken within half an hour, at high cost. Amongst the 1300 British and Portuguese casualties was Craufurd, who died several days later.Chappell, p. 23 The army turned its attention to Badajoz, another strong fortress, which the British had failed to carry on an earlier occasion. The Light Division dug trenches near Fort Picurina, which was stormed, and established batteries. On 6 April, the breaches were deemed practicable, and the Light Division were ordered to storm the breach at Santa Maria. As the Light Division's Forlorn Hope reached the ditch, the French exploded a mine. Various other barricades and gunpowder defences were in place, and the toll at the breaches was heavy. Wellington ordered a withdrawal. Elsewhere, the fortress walls were achieved by escalade, encouraging an attack on the breaches again. The fortress was taken, at great cost (over 5000 British casualties), and for three days the army sacked and pillaged the town in undisciplined revenge.Chappell, p. 24 The 52nd and the 43rd together lost 39 officers and 700 men, resulting in a reduction of the 2/52nd, who saw no more action in the Peninsula. Soon after the assault on Badajoz, Wellington marched his men to confront the French near Salamanca. For a month the armies marched and counter-marched against each other, seeking advantage, and on 22 July Wellington attacked in the Battle of Salamanca, achieving a comprehensive victory. The Light Division were in the reserve during the battle, and afterwards pursued and harried the retreating French.Chappell, p. 33 August saw the army in Madrid, where the 1/52nd remained while Wellington led a force on to Burgos, which he attempted to take. The siege was unsuccessful, and it was lifted by Wellington in October; the 1/52nd, with the Light Division, covered the army's retreat back into Portugal. This \\"Winter Retreat\\" bore similarities with the earlier retreat to Corunna, as it suffered from poor supplies, bitter weather and rearguard action, including one skirmish near the River Huebra, where the 43rd and 1/52nd lost 95 men. Ciudad Rodrigo was reached on 19 November, where the 1/52nd were billeted and resupplied with both men and clothing. Diversions were set up, including the \\"Light Division Theatre\\", in which the 52nd were described as \\"highly gentlemanly men, of steady aspect; they mixed little with other corps, but attended the theatricals of the 43rd with circumspect good humour, and now and then relaxed.\\" In spring, 1813, the army returned to the offensive, leaving Portugal and marching northwards through Spain to Vitoria where the French stood in preparation for battle, which took place on 21 June. The Light Division held the centre of the Allied line, and took the bridges of Villodas and Tres Puentes.Chappell, p. 34 The battle proved an overwhelming victory for the British, and the following day the 1/52nd, with the Light Division, were sent in pursuit of the retreating French, skirmishing with the enemy rearguard. In August, volunteers from the 1/52nd were involved in the storming of San Sebastian. The 1/52nd crossed into France on 7 October, when they stormed redoubts above Vera. The 1/52nd also fought in the battles at Nivelle (November 1813), Nive (December 1813) and Orthes (February 1814). During the battle of Orthes, the 52nd led an assault up the ridge under heavy fire, an advance which was later described by Sir Harry Smith as the most majestic he had ever seen.Bryant, p. 85 = The Hundred Days and end for Napoleon = Napoleon abdicated on 6 April 1814, but the news arrived in Wellington's camp too late to prevent the Battle of Toulouse, on 10 April, during which battle the 1/52nd's Lieutenant Whichcote was first into the city. Over this later period, the 2/52nd, who had left the Peninsula, were bolstered with new recruits and were sent to Holland in 1813‚Äì14, as part of Sir Thomas Graham's force which made an unsuccessful attack on Bergen op Zoom in March 1814.Fosten, p. 7 Afterwards they spent some time in Belgium before returning home to England. Once peace agreements had finally been settled ‚Äì the French Governor of Bayonne being the last, on 26 April ‚Äì the army left the Peninsula; the infantry marched to Bordeaux for transportation to their new postings.Bryant, p. 98 The 1/52nd were returned to England and, on 6 June 1814, stood on the quayside at Dover with their Light Division comrades from the 43rd and 95th as part of the official welcome for the Allied sovereigns visit to England.Bryant, p. 101 They were later billeted in Hythe and Chatham, where they were joined by the 2/52nd, returned from Belgium, who transferred their effectives to the 1st battalion. =Waterloo Campaign= In January, 1815, the 1/52nd departed Portsmouth for Cork, where they were due to embark for America, where fighting in the War of 1812 continued. Gales prevented sailing, and by the time conditions had improved, news had arrived of Napoleon's escape from Elba. The 1/52nd were sent to Belgium, at the start of the Hundred Days.Wilkinson-Latham & Roffe, p. 12 Napoleon marched swiftly through France to meet the Allies, who had formed two armies, with the Duke of Wellington commanding the Anglo-Allies, and Gebhard Leberecht von Bl√ºcher commanding the Prussians.Cornwell, p. 93‚Äì94 The 52nd were assigned to Lt-Gen Hill's II Corps, as part of the 2nd Division's 3rd Brigade, under General Adam.Nofi, p. 306 As a response to Napoleon's movements, on 15 June, II Corps were posted west and southwest of Brussels, with a cavalry screen.Nofi, p. 63 Wellington's forward army engaged the French at Quatre Bras on 16 June, but he later fell back to remain in contact with his Prussian allies, who had retreated following the Battle of Ligny, and took position near the village of Waterloo. The field at Waterloo was 5.5 km wide, with two parallel ridges running west to east, creating a shallow valley 1.4 km across. The Allies took position on the northern ridge.Nofi, p. 179 As the army prepared for battle on 18 June, the 2nd Division were initially held in reserve, placed in the centre left, behind Major-General Cooke's 1st Division.Nofi, p. 182 Following the French cavalry's battering of the British squares over the afternoon, Adam's brigade was brought up to reinforce the right.Nofi, p. 228Fletcher, p. 191 In this position the 52nd endured a heavy bombardment, of which Ensign Leeke of the 52nd reported afterwards \\"the old officers, who had served during the whole of the Peninsular War, stated that they were never exposed to such a cannonade as the 52nd squares had to undergo on this occasion for 2¬Ω hours from French artillery ¬Ω mile to the front\\".quoted in Fletcher, p. 191 While the 52nd's squares stood waiting, British artillery fired over their heads. Activity was happening elsewhere on the field, however, and as the battle drew to a close, Napoleon's Middle Guard launched an assault on the British line, to the 52nd's left, and were met by a number of regiments including the 1st Foot Guards, who repulsed the 3rd Chasseurs, but had to themselves retreat when the 4th Chasseurs moved forward to threaten their left. The 52nd, under Sir John Colborne, wheeled to the left, deploying parallel to the French column, and fired volleys against their left flank.Nofi, pp. 248‚Äì9 William Hay, a Light Dragoon watching from the right, later recalled that \\"so well- directed a fire was poured in, that down the bank the Frenchmen fell and, I may say, the battle of Waterloo was gained.\\"quoted in Fletcher, p. 254 Seeing the 52nd begin an advance, Wellington reputedly ordered \\"Go on, Colborne, they won't stand!\\"; the battalion then advanced diagonally across the field.Fletcher, p. 254 When this was later followed by a bayonet charge by all of General Adam's 3rd Brigade, the Guard broke, forced into full retreat.Roberts, p. 107 Having pursued the French down the escarpment of Mont St Jean, the 52nd crossed the valley floor (that at the start of the battle had separated the armies) and on the other side attacked a square of Old Guard (part of the personal body guard of Napoleon,) that had formed up to the British right of the inn La Belle Alliance and forced it to retreat. The 1/52nd were the largest battalion at Waterloo,Nofi, p. 248 and one of the few British battalions operating at full strength.Bryant, p. 249 Of the 1,130 men and officers present, 168 were wounded and 38 killed.Moorsom, p. 267 Kashmir Gate, Delhi, showing damage sustained during the 1857 assault. Photo taken in the 1860s =Later history= The 1st battalion were sent to Paris after Waterloo, and remained stationed in France until 1818. In 1816, the 2nd battalion were disbanded, in line with the other reductions in the army which occurred following the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars.Haythornthwaite (1995), p. 18 Returning to England in 1818, the 52nd were stationed in the Midlands, where they were responsible for domestic peacekeeping and policing under the command of Lt. Col. Charles Rowan, experience which fitted Rowan for his 1829 posting to establish a military-style metropolitan police service under Sir Robert Peel.F. E. C. Gregory, ‚ÄòRowan, Sir Charles (1782?‚Äì1852)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, September 2004; online edn, January 2008 , accessed 29 July 2009 In 1821, the regiment were posted to Dublin. Over the following years the 52nd received a number of overseas postings. Between 1823 and 1831, the regiment was stationed at, in turn, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and Prince Edward Island. In early 1842, the 52nd performed garrison duty in Barbados,Haythornthwaite (1995) pp. 17‚Äì18 where British units frequently supplemented the local forces.Haythornthwaite (1995), p. 275 In 1842, the regiment returned to Canada, and were posted to New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Quebec; they left Canada in 1845. Captain Charles Francis Norton, d. 1835, Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia) The 52nd later returned to India, arriving in Allahabad in 1853.Holmes, p. 132 The regiment found the heat and dust of India gruelling, and Major John Arthur Bayley of the 52nd, who published an account of the regiment's operations in India and described the great clouds of dust which rose over their columns in the march from Allahabad to Umballa in 1853‚Äì4; \\"it was worse in the rear than in the front; so, in order that everyone should have a fair chance, the order of march was changed daily.\\"Holmes, p. 129 They were in India during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, where they took part in the Siege of Delhi. Once breaches had been made by the artillery by a bombardment of the walls, an attempt was made on the city on 14 September. The Kashmir Gate was blown by a party of engineers, accompanied by Bugler Robert Hawthorne of the 52nd, who won the Victoria Cross for his bravery.Haythornthwaite (1995), p. 102 The 52nd led the assault on the blown gate; amidst the action, Lance Corporal Henry Smith also won the Victoria Cross. After six days of heavy fighting, the city was won.Haythornthwaite (1995), p. 103 The 52nd remained in India until 1865, when they returned to England. Over the next sixteen years they received postings in Ireland, England, Malta and Gibraltar. As part of the Cardwell Reforms of the 1870s, where single-battalion regiments were linked together to share a single depot and recruiting district in the United Kingdom, the 52nd was linked with the 85th Regiment of Foot (Bucks Volunteers), and assigned to district no. 42 at Cowley Barracks in Oxford. In 1881, due to the Childers Reforms, the 52nd was merged with the 43rd (Monmouthshire) Regiment of Foot, a regiment they had fought alongside as part of the Light Division during many campaigns. The newly combined unit was named the \\"Oxfordshire Light Infantry\\" ‚Äì the 52nd becoming the 2nd Battalion ‚Äì and in 1908 the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry. In 1958, the Ox & Bucks became the 1st Green Jackets (43rd and 52nd), and in 1966 was merged into the Royal Green Jackets.Wickes, p. 64 In 2007, the Royal Green Jackets became part of The Rifles. Colours and honours Like most British regiments, the 52nd carried flags known as \\"colours\\": the First, or \\"King's Colour\\", and the Second, or \\"Regimental Colour\\". The First had the Union Flag with the Regiment's number in the centre, surrounded by a wreath. Following the presentation of their colours in 1799, the 52nd's King's Colour included the Royal Cipher in the centre, a non- standard addition.Sumner & Hook, p.20 The Second was in the colour of the regimental facings (buff, in the 52nd's case) with a small Union Flag in the corner; the regimental number took the centre.Sumner & Hook, p.3 The colours were carried into battle for identification, and as a rallying point, in the care of sergeants or ensigns. Attending the colours in battle was dangerous, since they were a target for enemy artillery and assault; due to the symbolic significance of the colours, their loss was a grave issue, and extreme measures were often taken to prevent such dishonour occurring.Sumner & Hook, pp.20‚Äì1 The skirmishing and forward positions maintained by light infantry frequently made the bearing of colours inconvenient. For this reason, the newly raised 95th Rifles received no colours, but the converted line regiments, such as the 52nd, retained their existing colours. While some light infantry regiments opted not to carry them in the Peninsula, the 52nd and 43rd did.Sumner & Hook, pp.22‚Äì23 Battle honours are awarded to a regiment for their performance in certain battles and campaigns, and are displayed on their colours. The 52nd received the following honours: Hindoostan, Vimeiro, Corunna, Bussaco, Fuentes d'Onor, Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz, Salamanca, Vitoria, Nivelle, Nive, Orthes, Toulouse, Peninsula, Waterloo and Delhi 1857. Badges and decorations =Regimental badge= The Regimental Badge of the 52nd showed a bugle horn, suspended by cords from a knot, with the number \\"52\\" below the tassels. The bugle horn had been the badge of light infantry regiments since 1770, adapted from the Hanoverian Jaegar regiments, and became standard for the newly formed Light Infantry regiments, since it represented the bugle calls used for skirmishing orders instead of the standard line infantry drum.British Army: History of the Bugle Horn The regimental badge was worn on much of the equipment, including the shakos and belts, and also frequently on turnbacks and officers' shoulder wings.Haythornthwaite (1987), p. 84Haythornthwaite, p. 87 =Valiant Stormers= 1 January 1870-52nd veteran with his medals-Private John Jack of the 52nd Regiment of Foot, British Army, photographed at Banff, Scotland at the age of 90 wearing his medals, including the stormers medal for volunteering for the leading file of attack at the storming of Ciudad Rodrigo and Waterloo Medal Valiant Stormer patch, Replica done by Regimientos de America thumbleft52nd veteran's medals-The medals of Private John Jack of the 52nd Regiment of Foot, British Army, showing (left to right) the Military General Service Medal (MGSM) with clasps for Toulouse, Orthez, Nive, Nivelle, Pyrenees, Vittoria, Salamanca, Badajoz, Cuidad Rodrigo, Fuentes D'Onor, Busaco, Corunna; Stormers Medal for volunteering for the leading file of attack at the storming of Cuidad Rodrigo; Waterloo Medal (WM)During the Peninsular War, the 52nd fulfilled their dual role as line and light infantry by contributing to fortress assault parties. The companies that led the breach assaults were known as the \\"Forlorn Hope\\", (from the Dutch \\"verloren hoop\\" (lost troop)). It was deemed an act of high honour, since the lead troops faced the greatest danger.Adkin, Mark (1998)The Sharpe Companion, Harper Collins Publishers reproduced goliath.ecnext.com The 52nd contributed to the Forlorn Hope at the sieges of Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz (1812) and San Sebastian. Officers and sergeants who survived would be very likely be put up for battlefield promotions (although it was not assured) while other ranks would receive laurels from their commander also with the chance of promotion being greatly increased. The 52nd, however, offered its own recognition: those who survived the Forlorn Hope at Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz were entitled to wear on their right arm a badge displaying a laurel wreath and the letters \\"V.S.\\" for \\"Valiant Stormer\\".Haythornthwaite (1987), p.46 This honour was awarded by the 52nd's commanding officer, and was restricted to the 52nd.Costello, p.247 Officer and private, showing short jackets and stovepipe shako with bugle badge and green plume. C H Hamilton & J C Stadler, 19th century =Victoria Cross= The Victoria Cross (VC) was instituted in 1856 as the British Empire's highest decoration for valour. From that date until the 52nd merged with 43rd in 1881, two soldiers from the 52nd were awarded the Victoria Cross, both at Delhi in 1857: Bugler Robert Hawthorne and Lance Corporal Henry Smith. Bugler Hawthorne accompanied a party of engineers, led by Lieutenants Home and Salkeld of the Bengal Engineers, who had been ordered to lay a charge and blow the Kashmir Gate, so that entry to the city might be obtained. Once the charges had been detonated, Hawthorne sounded the advance, and then attended to a wounded officer from the explosion party, all the while enduring intense fire from the city's defenders. Lance Corporal Smith's medal was won during the following assault on the blown gate, when he \\"most gallantly carried away a wounded comrade under a heavy fire of grape and musketry, in the Chandnee Chouk of the city of Delhi, on the morning of the assault\\".Leeke (Vol II), p. 404 Hawthorne and Henry Smith's VC medals are on display at the Royal Green Jackets (Rifles) Museum in Winchester. Three others from the explosion party were awarded VCs that day: Sgt Smith, Lt. Home and Lt. Salkeld, who was the first posthumous recipient of the VC.

During the American wars, the coat was long tailed, with buff facings, buff waistcoat and breeches. The grenadier company wore a bearskin hat with the King's Crest and the regimental number. Officers wore crimson sash, gorget and silver epaulettes.Sons of the Revolution: Uniforms When becoming a light infantry regiment in 1803, the uniform accordingly changed. Light infantry dress has its origins in the American War of Independence, when uniforms were altered to allow ease in the field. \\"Wings\\", similar to those worn by grenadiers, were added to the shoulders and lacing was dispensed with, to make the quick removal of coats possible. At that time, the irregular light infantry also sought less conspicuous dress than the traditional red coat.Chappell, p. 6 However, conservatism returned with the new regular light infantry; while the 95th Rifles were permitted to retain the green clothing used by the German regiments, the seconded line regiments were required to retain the red coat, which remained an impediment to their skirmishing duties.Chappell, p. 16 Thus, throughout the Napoleonic wars, the 52nd foot continued to wear red uniforms with buff facings. The officers had silver lace, while the other ranks' lace was worn in pairs, red with orange stripes (according to 1802 regulations); in 1812 a commentator described the lace as red with two blue stripes.Haythornthwaite (1987), p. 100 Light infantry officers wore short jackets, rather than the tailed coats of the other line regiments, with white piping, silver buttons, and silver and scarlet shoulder wings. The uniform was completed with a crimson sash; to match the buff facings and turn-backs, the officers generally wore buff breeches, or grey overalls. Field officers of the 52nd wore silver epaulettes, with regimental badge, overtop the light infantry wings, to designate rank. An 1810 order stipulated these be badged with a star (for majors), a crown (lieutenant colonels) or star and crown (colonels).Haythornthwaite (1987), p. 37 Light infantry also commonly wore a narrow waist belt instead of the customary shoulder belt. The 52nd did not adopt the \\"Belgic cap\\" but retained the stovepipe shako throughout the Napoleonic period; it was adorned with the brass bugle badge and green plumes of the light infantry.Haythornthwaite (1987), p. 54 In the 52nd, officers' plumes were made from horsehair. Officers generally carried a stirrup-hilted sabre. Officers were responsible for providing (and paying for) their own uniforms; consequently, variable style and decoration was present, according to the officer's private means.Haythornthwaite (1987), p. 14 Equipment could consume a significant portion of an officer's pay; during the Napoleonic era, the 52nd's plain regimental sabre, for example, cost 4 guineas, approximately 16 days' pay for an ensign.Haythornthwaite (1987), p. 10 The red coat remained standard uniform for the British Army until khaki was introduced as standard in 1885, although some allowances were made for colonial conditions, with the use of lighter materials, and slight change of design.Haythornthwaite (1995), pp. 34‚Äì35 However, the uniform and equipment remained quite restrictive, particularly in colonial warfare. In 1841, the light bob's situation was compared unfavourably with his enemy's light marching order: \\"Buckle him up in a tight red jacket, when the thermometer is about 80¬∞; place across his breast two buff-leather belts, about a quarter of an inch in thickness, and each what the milliners call a nail in breadth; hang to one of them a cartouche-box containing sixty rounds of ball cartridges, each of these about above an ounce in weight; strap across his shoulders a square well-packed wallet, containing four shirts, with or without frills, and other notions; plant a cap on his head which in point of weight is equal to an iron pot; then place over his shoulder a musket and bayonet weighing a stone; with three days' provisions in his haversack, and a couple of quarts of liquid in a canteen.\\"Lt-Col Wilkie, \\"The British Colonies Considered as Military Posts\\", in United Services Journal, 1841, vol I, p. 235; quoted in Haythornthwaite (1995), p. 34 While no official service uniform was developed for the tropics, during the Mutiny in India in 1857, many of the regiments fought in their undress uniform (white drill), rather than the standard uniform. The 52nd were the first regiment to dye their white uniforms khaki for use in the field.Barthorp (1982), p. 88 This early khaki was a grey colour.Barthorp (1982), p. 99 For most purposes, they discarded their coats and, adopting the Indian traditions, wore their shirts out, rather than tucked in; shirts were also dyed.Barthorp (1994), p. 20 The 52nd also developed turbans to wear over their standard-issue forage caps.Barthorp (1994), p. 21 Following the mutiny, regiments returned to the standard red clothing.Barthorp (1982), p. 100 Headstone of Depot Sergeant Major George Stone at Cowley Barracks, Oxfordshire light Infantry, St James' parish churchyard, Cowley, Oxfordshire. (An eroded trace of the number \\"52\\" is visible in the regimental badge carved at the top of the stone.) Legacy Despite its continual merging with other units from 1881, the legacy of the 52nd remains. Many of the 52nd's battle honours are represented on the Belt Badge of The Rifles (being a rifle regiment, The Rifles do not carry colours). Various museums record the actions of the 52nd and hold collections of artifacts and memorabilia, including the Royal Green Jackets (Rifles) Museum, and the Soldiers of Oxfordshire Museum, whose archives are managed by the Oxfordshire County Council. Some officers of the 52nd recorded their experiences in the regiment. One of the most notable was the Reverend William Leeke who, as a young ensign, carried the Regimental Colours at Waterloo.Leeke (Vol I), p. 20 He believed that the actions taken by Sir John Colborne (Lord Seaton) and the 52nd to defeat the Imperial Guard at the close of the battle had been unjustly overlooked in official dispatches and histories, and wrote his memoirs so that \\"the truth, with regard to what we knew the 52nd had achieved at Waterloo, [should] see the light\\".Leeke (Vol I), p. v In 1866 his two-volume work The History of Lord Seaton's Regiment, (the 52nd Light Infantry) at the Battle of Waterloo was published, and has served as a primary source for most Waterloo historians since. Also to publish memoirs, although less successfully, was Reginald Wilberforce, grandson of slavery abolitionist William Wilberforce, who wrote, in 1894, An Unrecorded Chapter of the Indian Mutiny; on publication, the book was criticised by his fellow officers of the 52nd for its inaccuracy.Haythornthwaite (1995) p. 336 See also *Officers of the 52nd Foot *Soldiers of the 52nd Foot *British Army during the Napoleonic Wars Notes References * Baker, Anthony; (1986) Battle Honours of the British & Commonwealth Armies UK: Ian Allan, * Barthorp, Michael; (1982) British Military Uniforms Since 1660, Poole: New Orchard Editions, * Barthorp, Michael; (1994) The British Troops in the Indian Mutiny 1857‚Äì59, UK: Osprey Publishing * Bryant, Arthur; (1950) The Age of Elegance: 1812‚Äì1822, London: Collins * Chappell, Mike; (2004) Wellington's Peninsula Regiments (2): The Light Infantry, Oxford: Osprey Publishing, * Cornwell, Bernard; (2015) Waterloo: The History of Four Days, Three Armies and Three Battles, Lulu Press, front cover * Costello, Edward; (1841) The Adventures of a Soldier, London: Henry Colburn, available online * Draper, Robin Anthony (2015).

Biography Keiichi Tanaami was born in 1936 as the eldest son of a textile wholesaler in Tokyo. He was 9 years old when Tokyo was bombed during the Great Tokyo Air Raid of World War II in 1945. Images seared into the back of his mind at this time would become major motifs in his art works: roaring American bombers, searchlights scanning the skies, firebombs dropped from planes, the city a sea of fire, fleeing masses, and his father's deformed goldfish swimming in its tank, flashes from the bombs reflecting in the water. \\"I was rushed away from my childhood, a time that should be filled with eating and playing, by the enigmatic monstrosity of war; my dreams were a vortex of fear and anxiety, anger and resignation. On the night of the air raid, I remember watching swarms of people flee from bald mountaintops. But then something occurs to me: was that moment real? Dream and reality are all mixed up in my memories, recorded permanently in this ambiguous way.\\" Tanaami took to drawing from a young age, and as a junior high school student he often spent time at the studio of leading postwar cartoonist Kazushi Hara with the intention of becoming a cartoonist himself. After Hara's sudden death, however, he turned to the pioneering field within manga of graphic novels, and went on to study to become a professional artist at Musashino Art University. Word of his talent spread quickly during his time there and in 1958, as a second year student, he was awarded the Special Selection at an exhibition held by the authoritative illustration and design group of the time. After graduating he took a job with an advertising agency, but quit before one year was up due to the numerous private commissions he was receiving. During the '60s he busied himself as a successful illustrator and graphic designer while also actively participating in the Neo-Dada organization, one of the defining art movements of postwar Japan. In the latter half of the '60s he immersed himself in making video art, the newest medium in the art scene at the time. \\"In the 1960s, the Sogetsu Art Center in Akasaka regularly held events that traversed many diverse genres. There were happenings staged by Yoko Ono, videos by Nam June Paik and experimental films from America. It was around that time that I heard about the [Sogetsu] Animation Festival (1965). I wanted so badly to make an animation, so I convinced Y≈çji Kuri's Experimental Animation Studio to help me create 'Marionettes in Masks' (35 mm, 8 minutes). I continued to make animations after that, with works such as 'Good-by Marilyn' (1971), 'Good-by Elvis and USA' (1971), 'Crayon Angel' (1975) and 'Sweet Friday' (1975).\\" In 1967, Tanaami took his first trip to New York City. There he came face to face with the works of Andy Warhol, shining brightly amidst the whirlwind of prospering American consumerism, and Tanaami was struck by the new possibilities of art within the world of design. \\"Warhol was in the process of shifting from commercial illustrator to artist, and I both witnessed and experienced firsthand his tactics, his method of incision into the art world. His strategies were identical to the strategies employed by advertising agencies. He used contemporary icons as motifs in his works and for his other activities put together media such as films, newspapers and rock bands. In other words, Warhol's sole existence was selling his works to the art market. I was shocked by this, and at the same time I embraced him as the perfect role model for myself. Like Warhol, I decided not to limit myself to one medium, to fine art or design only, but instead to explore many different methods.\\" At the height of psychedelic culture and pop art, Tanaami's kitschy, colorful illustrations and design work received high acclaim in both Japan and abroad. \\"NO MORE WAR\\", his prize-winning piece from the 1968 antiwar poster contest organized by AVANT-GARDE Magazine, in addition to his album cover art for legendary bands The Monkees and Jefferson Airplane and other such works left a major footprint on the path to introducing psychedelic and pop art to Japan. Furthermore, his series of erotic paintings featuring Hollywood actresses done in the early '70s became an important body of work that declared Tanaami as the Japanese artist with a witty eye on American culture. In 1975, Tanaami became the first art director of the Japanese edition of Playboy, Monthly Playboy, and went to New York once again to visit Playboy's head office. The editor there took him to Andy Warhol's Factory. Tanaami's works from this period, mostly in the mediums of film and print, were provocative and experimental. His films in particular received wide critical acclaim, appearing in the International Short Film Festival Oberhausen in Germany (1975, 1976), the New York Film Festival (1976), and the Ottawa International Animation Festival in Canada (1976). The vanguard nature of his work led the police to shut down his 1976 exhibit \\"Super Orange of Love\\" at Nishimura Gallery for inspection on the opening day. In 1981, at the age of 45, he suffered a pulmonary edema and for a time hovered at the edge of life and death. Throughout the '80s and '90s, Tanaami created many works centered around the theme of \\"Life and Death\\" based on the experience. For example, the pine tree form that appears frequently in Tanaami's works comes from a hallucination he experienced during his illness. Similarly, the cranes, elephants and naked women that appear along with spirals and miniature garden- like architectural forms are characteristic of his works from this period. In 1999, a retrospective of Tanaami's works from the '60s was held at Gallery 360¬∞ in Tokyo. The exhibit was praised highly by Yamataka Eye (Boredoms) and KAWS, cultural leaders of the new generation born after the '60s, and as a result, Tanaami's works once again became popular amongst youth culture. Since 2005, Tanaami has been presenting new works that fall in the realm of fine art. In these works, he continues to manifest images from his personal memories and from his dream world -- personified goldfish, deformed characters, rays of light, helical pine trees, fantastical architecture, young girls -- through the various mediums of painting, sculpture, film and furniture. Tanaami has worked as a professor at Kyoto University of Art and Design since 1991, where he has helped bring up young new artists such as Tabaimo.

Timeline In the narrative of I Maccabees, after Antiochus IV issued his decrees forbidding Jewish religious practice, a rural Jewish priest from Modiin, Mattathias the Hasmonean, sparked the revolt against the Seleucid Empire by refusing to worship the Greek gods. Mattathias killed a Hellenized Jew who had stepped forward to take Mattathias' place in sacrificing to an idol as well as the Greek officer who was sent to enforce the sacrifice. Afterwards, he and his five sons fled to the wilderness of Judah. After Mattathias' death about one year later in 166 BCE, his son Judah Maccabee led an army of Jewish dissidents to victory over the Seleucid dynasty in guerrilla warfare, which at first was directed against Hellenized Jews, of whom there were many. The Maccabees destroyed Greek altars in the villages, circumcised boys and forced Hellenized Jews into outlawry.Nicholas de Lange (ed.), The Illustrated History of the Jewish People, London, Aurum Press, 1997, Judah's nickname \\"Maccabbeus,\\" now used in popular culture to describe the Jewish partisans as a whole, is taken from the Hebrew word for \\"hammer\\".The Maccabees/Hasmoneans: History & Overview (166‚Äì129 BC) Jewish Virtual Library The revolt itself involved many battles, in which the Maccabean forces gained notoriety for their use of guerrilla tactics and their speed and mobility, in contrast to the slow and bulky Seleucid army. After the victory, the Maccabees entered Jerusalem in triumph and ritually cleansed the Temple, reestablishing traditional Jewish worship there and installing Jonathan Apphus, Judah's youngest brother, as high priest. A large Seleucid army was sent to quash the revolt, but returned to Syria on the death of Antiochus IV. Beforehand, Judas Maccabbeus made an agreement with Rome and became allied, tying the hands of the weaker Seleucid Empire. Its commander Lysias, preoccupied with internal Seleucid affairs, agreed to a political compromise that revoked Antiochus IV's ban on Jewish practices.

In the First and Second Books of the Maccabees, the Maccabean Revolt is described as a response to cultural oppression and national resistance to a foreign power. Modern scholars, however, argue that the king intervened in a civil war between traditionalist Jews in the countryside and Hellenized Jews in Jerusalem. As Joseph P. Schultz puts it: > \\"Modern scholarship ... considers the Maccabean revolt less as an uprising > against foreign oppression than as a civil war between the orthodox and > reformist parties in the Jewish camp.\\" Professor John Ma of Columbia University argues that the main sources indicate that the loss of religious and civil rights by the Jews in 168 BCE was not the result of religious persecution but rather an administrative punishment by the Seleucid Empire in the aftermath of local unrest, and that the Temple was restored upon petition by the High Priest Menelaus, not liberated and rededicated by the Maccabees.Ma, John. \\"Re-examining Hanukkah\\", The Marginalia Review of the Book, July 9, 2013 Sylvie Honigman of Tel Aviv University advances similar arguments. Linda Zollschan, \\"Review of Sylvie Honigman, 'Tales of High Priests and Taxes'\\", in Bryn Mawr Classical Review, 2015.08.07  Aftermath  All five sons of Matthias died violent deaths: Judas and Eleazar died in battle, Jonathan was betrayed and killed by the Seleucid general Tryphon, Simon was killed at a feast in Jericho by his son-in-law Ptolemy and John Gaddi was seized and killed by the sons of Jambri from Medeba. After the success of the Maccabean Revolt, kings of the Hasmonean dynasty continued their conquest to the surrounding areas of Judea. Those who remained of the Jewish party favoring Hellenistic influence, forced to submit to Mosaic Law, repeatedly called upon the Seleucid Empire for assistance. At the time, however, the Seleucid Empire was weakened by political infighting and other wars, including against Ptolemaic Egypt, reducing their ability to reconquer Judea. In one particular instance, however, Jonathan Apphus (son of Mattathias) was convinced by Tryphon to dismiss 40,000 of his men and meet him for a \\"conference\\", which turned to be a trap. Jonathan was captured and later executed, against a deal Tryphon had made with Jonathan's brother Simon for Jonathan's liberation, in exchange for one hundred talents and Jonathan's two sons as hostages. Simeon was later murdered by his son-in-law, Ptolemy son of Abubus. Afterwards, Simon's third son, John Hyrcanus, became ruler and High Priest of Israel. Legacy The Jewish festival of Hanukkah celebrates the re-dedication of the Temple following Judah Maccabee's victory over the Seleucids. According to Rabbinic tradition, the victorious Maccabees could only find a small jug of oil that had remained pure and uncontaminated by virtue of a seal, and although it only contained enough oil to sustain the Menorah for one day, it miraculously lasted for eight days, by which time further oil could be procured.Talmud, Tractate Shabbat See also *Jewish military history *List of conflicts in the Near East *Second Temple period References External links *Maccabean Revolt at Oxford Bibliographies *Maccabean Revolt at the Aish HaTorah website Category:160s BC conflicts Category:2nd century BC in the Hasmonean Kingdom Category:2nd-century BCE Judaism Category:Coele-Syria Category:Jewish rebellions Category:Jewish religious nationalism Category:Rebellions against empires Category:Rebellions in Asia Category:Religion-based wars Category:Rebellions in ancient Greece Category:Wars involving the Seleucid Empire Category:Wars of ancient Israel ","title":"Maccabean Revolt"},{"id":"13660153","text":"Szczytnica () is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Warta Boles≈Çawiecka, within Boles≈Çawiec County, Lower Silesian Voivodeship, in south-western Poland.

It provided retail and commercial banking services to individuals and businesses in Belgium, together with related financial products such as insurance and asset management. It was formed by the merger of two existing Belgian banks Banque de Bruxelles and Banque Lambert in 1975 making it at that time the second largest Belgian bank. It was sold to ING Group in 1998 who renamed the subsidiary ING Belgium. History =Banque de Bruxelles= Banque de Bruxelles was founded in 1871 and grew steadily over the ensuing six decades, acquiring interests in other banks in Belgium's major cities. In 1931, these interests were combined in a single business which operated in traditional banking and in the management of industrial concerns based mainly in Belgium and Africa. Following the reform of the Belgian banking sector in 1934‚Äì35, the commercial banking activities were transferred to a new company formed on 30 January 1935 under the same registered name. As required by the reform, this transfer separated the banking and holding company functions. =Banque Lambert= Banque Lambert had its origins in the banking house founded by the Lambert family, financiers in Belgium since the country's independence in 1830. After 1945, Banque Lambert rapidly developed its services and network, notably through the merger of a number of privately owned banks. =Merger= What had been planned as an absorption of Banque Lambert by the Banque de Bruxelles became a merger in 1975, with Banque Lambert headed by Baron Leon Lambert having a position of strength. This was after Banque de Bruxelles was hit by a loss of several billion Belgian francs after one of its traders took a position that went wrong. =Take over= The bank was purchased by the Dutch ING Group in 1998 and subsequently renamed ING Belgium. Headquarters The headquarters of BBL (now an office of ING Group) was the Bank Lambert building on Marnixlaan 24, Brussels. This modernist building was the only European building designed by the American architect Gordon Bunshaft making it one of the most important modernist architectural buildings in Belgium.

The first two editions created an uproar and in less than a year it was banned. A new Spanish edition was allowed in 1946. This novel is fundamental to the generation of tremendismo (named from tremendo, \\"awful, tremendous\\"), which focuses on the treatment of its characters and is marked by extended and frequent violent scenes. The novel is in fact considered the first novel of this style of writing, but also contains themes of extreme realism and existentialism: the characters live in the margins of society and their lives are submersed in anguish and pain; the archetype of this theme is found in the protagonist of the novel, Pascual Duarte, who has learned that violence is the only way to solve his problems. The Family of Pascual Duarte has various narrators, the main being Duarte, who recounts his history in a rural dialect. The protagonist is from Extremadura and his life unfolds between 1882 and 1937, years in which the social and political structures of Spain were marked by extreme instability. This time is one of the most agitated periods of time under the historic constitution. The novel has a clear religious theme, despite the author having never been devoted, and the references to God throughout it are numerous. Characters * Pascual Duarte: the narrator-protagonist. His life is full of pain and bad luck. He is a man of impulse and no conscience, which leads him to murder without scruples and as a consequence to spend his life in jail. * Rosario: Pascual's sister. She has total control over their father. She leaves their house and probably begins to work as a prostitute. * Esteban Duarte: Pascual's father. He dies from a rabid dog bite. * Lola: Pascual's first wife. She loses two sons, the first to a miscarriage caused by riding a horse, and the other, Pascualito, 11 months after his birth. * Mario: Pascual's half-brother on his mother's side, son of Rafael. He dies at a young age. * Rafael: the lover of Pascual's mother. He is cruel, especially to his son Mario. * Pascual's mother: a perverse, cruel and alcoholic woman. She hits her children and is unfaithful to her husband, Esteban. Finally, Pascual kills her for all that has happened. * Engracia: the witch of the town. She often visits Pascual's house and is present for many of the sicknesses that Pascual's family has to endure. * El Estirao: a pimp who lives off of his prostitutes. Pascual resents him profoundly for dishonoring his sister and wife, and ultimately kills him. * Don Manuel: the priest of the town. Pascual goes to see him when he is about to get married. * Lurue√±a: the priest of the prison. He has a good relationship with Pascual and is with him in the moments before his very death. * Esperanza: Pascual's second wife and niece of Engracia. She was in love with him even before he married Lola, and the two can get married after he gets out of prison. * Don Conrado: the director of the prison. A good man who helps Pascual to leave prison for the first time. Plot The first- person narrator-protagonist Pascual Duarte, while awaiting execution in the condemned cell, tells the story of his family life and his homicidal past, culminating in matricide. He claims, amongst other things, that Fate is controlling his life and whatever he does nothing will ever change. As aforementioned, the book could be said to explore a Spanish version of Existentialism: like in Albert Camus's L'√©tranger, Pascual is seen by society as an outsider, unable or unwilling to follow its norms. His autobiographical tale shows some of the tremendously harsh peasant reality of rural Spain up to the beginning of Franco's regime.

History =Early wars= Drawing by a soldier depicting the Battle of the Plains of Abraham in September 1759 The regiment was raised by Colonel Robert AnstrutherLate Lieutenant-Colonel of the 26th Regiment of Foot, Beatson, p. 426 as the 60th Regiment of Foot in 1755 for service in the Seven Years' War. It was re-ranked as the 58th Regiment of Foot, following the disbandment of the existing 50th and 51st regiments, in 1756. The regiment embarked for North America in spring 1758 for service in the French and Indian War and saw action at the Siege of Louisbourg in June 1758, the Battle of the Plains of Abraham in September 1759, the Battle of Sainte-Foy and the subsequent Siege of Quebec in April to May 1760. It then took part in the final and decisive campaign between July and September 1760 when Montreal fell. The regiment then moved to the West Indies and, although eight companies of the regiment were captured by the French en route, it took part in the Battle of Havana in summer 1762 during the Anglo-Spanish War. After returning to England later that year it was posted to Gibraltar in 1770 and took part in the Great Siege in the early 1780s. It adopted a county designation as the 58th (Rutlandshire) Regiment of Foot in August 1782. =Napoleonic Wars= Richard Lambart, 7th Earl of Cavan, Colonel of the regiment during the Napoleonic Wars The Battle of Plattsburgh in September 1814 The regiment embarked for the West Indies in late 1793 and fought at the capture of Martinique in February 1794 during the French Revolutionary Wars. After returning to England in 1795, it was deployed, under the command of Colonel William Houston, in the Capture of Minorca in November 1798. The regiment then embarked for Egypt for service in the French campaign in Egypt and Syria: it saw action at the Battle of Abukir in March 1801, the Battle of Alexandria later that month and the Siege of Cairo in June 1801. A second battalion was raised in 1804 to increase the strength of the regiment. The 1st battalion was deployed to Sicily in 1805 for service in the Napoleonic Wars and saw action at the Battle of Maida in July 1806. It then moved to Calabria in Italy, where it participated in a raid on shipping at Diamante in September 1808. It was deployed to Portugal in spring 1812 to serve under the Marquess of Wellington in the Peninsular campaign. During this campaign it fought on the East Coast of the Peninsula at the Battle of Castalla in April 1813 and the Siege of Tarragona in June 1813. It then embarked for North America for service in the War of 1812 and saw action at the Battle of Plattsburgh in September 1814.

One company was commanded by Captain Adam Ferguson. During the autumn of 1810 the newly formed \\"Fighting 3rd Division\\" led by General Thomas Picton, had the 2nd Battalion of the 58th Foot placed under its command and ordered it to move to a defensive position at the Lines of Torres Vedras. The battalion then advanced with the 3rd Division and in April 1812 saw action at the Battle of Salamanca in July 1812, the Siege of Burgos in September 1812 and the Battle of Vitoria in June 1813. It then pursued the French Army into France and saw action at the Battle of the Pyrenees in July 1813, the Battle of Nivelle in November 1813 and the Battle of the Nive in December 1813 as well as the Battle of Orthez in February 1814.

In December 1846, during the Whanganui campaign, 180 soldiers from the regiment and four Royal Artillery men were landed at Whanganui with two 12-pounder guns and began fortifying the town, building the Rutland Stockade on a hill at the town's northern end and the York Stockade towards the south. The establishment of the garrison heightened Te Mamaku's expectations of government intervention, and he vowed he would protect settlers but fight the soldiers.Belich, p.73‚Äì74 On 16 April 1847, after a minor chief of the Wanganui people was accidentally shot by a junior army officer, about 500 or 600 heavily armed MƒÅori formed a taua (war party) that swept down the Whanganui River, plundering and burning settlers' houses and killing and mutilating a soldier from the 58th Regiment who ventured out of the town. When a fire broke out in Auckland, New Zealand, in 1858, eventually destroying an entire city block, the men of the 58th Regiment were instrumental in firefighting efforts under the command of Colonel Robert Wynyard. Although some men from the regiment chose to settle in New Zealand, the regiment returned home in 1859. The regiment was deployed to India in 1864 and remained there until 1874 when it returned to England. It was sent to South Africa in 1879 for service in the Anglo-Zulu War and saw action at the Battle of Ulundi in July 1879. It also fought at the Battle of Laing's Nek in January 1881 and the Battle of Majuba Hill in February 1881 during the First Boer War. At the Battle of Laing's Nek it was the last regiment to carry its regimental colours into battle and Lieutenant Alan Richard Hill won the Victoria Cross. As part of the Cardwell Reforms of the 1870s, where single-battalion regiments were linked together to share one depot and recruiting district in the United Kingdom, the 58th was linked with the 48th (Northamptonshire) Regiment of Foot, and assigned to district no. 29 at Gibraltar Barracks in Northampton. On 1 July 1881 the Childers Reforms came into effect and the regiment amalgamated with the 48th (Northamptonshire) Regiment of Foot to form the Northamptonshire Regiment.

Early life Ritambhara was born as Nisha in a lower class, lower caste home at Doraha town in Ludhiana district of Punjab. She got her diksha from Swami Paramanand, at the age of sixteen and having became his disciple, followed him to his ashram in Haridwar and then, in his tours across India, while being primarily trained in oratory. She entered the Sangh Parivar as a member of the Rashtriya Sevika Samiti, the women's arm of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Activism Rithambara gained public prominence through her roles in the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP). In order to justify the involvement of ascetics (incl. herself) in mainstream politics, she went for a reconstruction of Hinduism through selective reading of Bhagvad Gita. = Hate speeches = During 1989-1992, Rithambara disseminated several public-speeches that urged for waging a war against Muslims; cassettes of those vitriolic outbursts were played at numerous temples and public places in India. Filled with rage and shrillness, the speeches heavily borrowed from gendered imagery; portraying the Hindu nation as a female body undergoing desecration by non-Hindus (and thus losing her morality), she drew parallels with rapes of Hindu women during partition and appealed to Hindu masculinity for reclaiming their lands, attracting large numbers of men, in the process. Vividly organic and sexual imagery were used as well, from equating the Muslims with lemon in milk to comparing them with flies, who were allegedly mass-breeding to out-populate the Hindus. With highly selective and vague historical sketches and blended in with ample mythology, they subsumed various classes and castes under a common banner of Hindu nationalism; some scholars have identified this agglomeration as the most valuable objective, fulfilled by Rithambara and associate women. Rithambara has been widely noted to be the single most powerful voice behind the whipping up of anti-Muslim sentiments across the nation, in the run-ups to the demolition of Babri Masjid; there was an overwhelming sense of passion, urgency and spontaneity, oft-accompanied by dramatic physical posturing, which instilled a non-rational collective feeling, among the audience. She was one of the three key women leaders of the movement, the other two being Uma Bharati and Vijayaraje Scindia; their leadership was largely responsible for the involvement of women in the movement and the form it took. Scholars note that she operated far outside the traditional boundaries of feminine domains.  Election campaigns  Rithambara's skills at oratory made her a star-campaigner for Bharatiya Janata Party in both the 1989 and 1991 Lok Sabha elections and several state- legislature elections. = Demolition of Babri Majid = Rithambara was present during the demolition, cheering the crowd whilst standing atop the terrace of the Masjid. Three days after the demolition, she was arrested on grounds of inciting communal tension.  Legal Trials  The Liberhan Commission that probed the Babri Masjid demolition held Sadhvi Ritambhara along with sixty-eight others of being individually culpable for leading the country \\"to the brink of communal discord\\" for their role in the demolition of the Babri Masjid on 6 December 1992. A CBI court has framed criminal charges against Rithambara in May, 2017. On 30 september 2020, she along with other 32 accused people, acquitted in the Babari Masjid Demolition Case by CBI special court. =Later activities= She retreated from her public role, soon after the demolition and kept a relatively low profile for a few years. In 1993, Sadhvi Rithambara attempted to establish an ashram near Vrindavan and Mathura on land that the Uttar Pradesh BJP government had granted her for a minimal fee. However, the proposal fell through as the Kalyan Singh-led government was dismissed, and she was not allowed to take possession of the land by the subsequent Mulayam Singh Yadav led state government. In 2002, the state government led by Chief Minister Ram Prakash Gupta granted 17 hectares of land in the area, valued at Rupee 200 million, to her Paramshaktipeth trust for 99 years for an annual fee of one rupee for this philanthropic cause. Besides cultivating devotion in women, the Vrindavan Ashram has also imparted training in karate, horse-riding, handling air guns and pistols, with the stated aim of relieving the women from their traditional societal roles and making them confident and self-reliant. She also runs ashrams for unwanted infants, ladies and widows in Indore, Delhi and Himachal Pradesh. In April 1995, Rithambara was arrested in Indore for inciting communal passions, after she referred to Mother Teresa as a \\"magician\\", in the course of a speech denouncing Christian missionaries, who she alleged were converting Hindus. Rithambara's address sparked off a riot and led to several arson, leading to the arrest of 169 people. During the 1995 Gujarat elections, she returned back to the campaigning fold for BJP and alleged about a Hindu-phobic attitude of Congress (I); this helped in mobilizing public electoral sentiments, especially that VHP was banned in Gujarat. She was arrested, soon after.

Under the Childers Reforms it amalgamated with the 30th (Cambridgeshire) Regiment of Foot to form the East Lancashire Regiment in 1881.Swinson, p. 158 History =Early history= The regiment was raised in the counties of Leicestershire and Northamptonshire by Sir Charles Montagu as the 61st Regiment of Foot in 1755 for service in the Seven Years' War. It was re-ranked as the 59th Regiment of Foot, following the disbandment of the existing 50th and 51st regiments, in 1756. Shortly after its formation, the regiment moved from England to Ireland, where it performed garrison duty until 1763. In that year the 59th Foot sailed to Nova Scotia where they remained until 1772 when they stationed in Boston, Massachusetts. The 59th were in Boston when the American War of Independence broke out, and suffered severe casualties. The remains of the regiment returned to England in 1776 to reform. In 1782, the closing stages of the Anglo Spanish War, the 59th were assigned to the Gibraltar garrison, remaining there for ten years. From 1792-1794 the regiment was based in England and the Channel Islands. In 1782 all regiments of the line without a royal title were given a county designation and the regiment became the 59th (2nd Nottinghamshire) Regiment of Foot (the 45th Foot being designated the 1st Nottinghamshire). =French Revolutionary Wars= With the outbreak of war with revolutionary France, the 59th formed part of the British force dispatched to Flanders, arriving in 1794. The campaign was a major reverse for the British and their allies, and the regiment was evacuated back to England in 1795. Later in 1795 the 59th Foot sailed to the West Indies, where they were to remain for seven years. They were stationed in Saint Vincent, where they suppressed uprisings by the Maroons. They returned to England in 1802. =Napoleonic Wars= Batavia, capital of the Dutch East Indies, with citadel in the background. In August 1804, while stationed in England, a second battalion of the 59th Foot was raised. The 1st Battalion sailed in the following year for the Cape of Good Hope, while the 2nd Battalion was to remain on garrison duty in England, Ireland and the Channel Islands until 1808. The Cape of Good Hope, which had been captured by the British in 1795, had been returned to the Dutch under the Treaty of Amiens. On 7 January 1806 the 1st Battalion of the 59th was part of a brigade that landed at the Cape, and within two days the Dutch forces had surrendered. Although the regiment suffered only light casualties (two dead and six wounded) this was to be the 59th's first battle honour. The 2nd Battalion, meanwhile, sailed for Spain in 1808. On 16 January 1809 it took part in the Battle of Corunna, a British tactical victory which allowed for the evacuation of their forces from the Iberian peninsula. From England, the battalion was dispatched to the Netherlands in July 1809, taking part in the fruitless Walcheren Campaign. The unit was to remain in England and Ireland until 1812. From the Cape, the 1st Battalion sailed to India. In November 1810 the battalion took part in the invasion of Mauritius. In the following year they invaded Java in the Dutch East Indies. They remained in Java until 1815, when they returned to India. In 1812 the 2nd Battalion returned to Spain. They took part in the Battle of Vittoria (June 1813), the Siege of San Sebasti√°n (July - August 1813), the Battle of the Bidassoa (October 1813), the Battle of Nivelle (November 1813) and the Battle of the Nive (December 1813). From France the 2/59th had sailed to Ireland. When Napoleon returned to France, triggering the \\"Hundred Days\\", the battalion was part of the British force dispatched to Belgium. While they were present in the Waterloo area, they did not take part in the hostilities. Having formed part of the army of occupation in France, the 2nd Battalion returned to England in 1816, where they were disbanded. =The Victorian era= Sir Frederick Philipse Robinson, colonel of the regiment in the 1830s Bombardment of Canton December 1857 On the disbandment of the 2nd Battalion, the 1st was redesignated simply as the 59th (2nd Nottinghamshire) Regiment of Foot. The unit moved from India to Ceylon in 1817, returning to India in the following year, where it fought in the Third Anglo-Maratha War. In 1825-1826 they took part in the siege and capture of the Jat fortress of Bharatpur (awarded as the honour \\"Bhurtpore\\"). The regiment returned to England in 1829. For the next twenty years the 59th was engaged in garrison duties in England, Ireland, Malta and the West Indies. In 1849 they sailed to China to become part of a small force enforcing the terms imposed on China following the First Opium War. In 1856 Britain deemed the terms of the treaty to have been broken, and the Second Opium War commenced. In January 1858 the 59th Foot, along with members of the Royal Marine Light Infantry and the Royal Navy occupied the city of Canton. In 1858 the 59th Foot moved to South Africa, subsequently returning to the United Kingdom in 1861. From 1867 - 1878 the regiment again served in India and Ceylon. From India the 59th crossed into Afghanistan in November 1878 as part of an invasion force, seeking to stem Russian influence in the region. In April 1880 they fought in the Battle of Ahmed Khel. Later in 1880 the 59th Foot returned to England. =Amalgamation= As part of the Cardwell Reforms of the 1870s, where single-battalion regiments were linked together to share a single depot and recruiting district in the United Kingdom, the 59th was linked with the 30th (Cambridgeshire) Regiment of Foot, and assigned to district no. 51 at Burnley Barracks in Lancashire. On 1 July 1881 the Childers Reforms came into effect and the regiment amalgamated with the 30th (Cambridgeshire) Regiment of Foot to form the East Lancashire Regiment with the 59th Foot becoming the 2nd Battalion of the East Lancashire Regiment. Following a series of amalgamations, the lineage of the 59th is now continued by the Duke of Lancaster's Regiment.

There have been countless cases throughout human history where commissioned military officers and enlisted personnel‚Äîas individuals or small groups‚Äîhave chosen to question and disobey the orders of their superior officers or the supreme leader of the state. Forms of dissent Dissent by military officers falls into two main categories: violent and non-violent. In essence, when a military officer, military leader chooses to oppose the orders given to him by his superior officers or national leader, he/she must decide whether his counter-action will be violent or non-violent in nature and in aim. Violent or forcible dissent or opposition among military officers against their superiors or national authority is further broken down into the following categories: * Assassination * Coup d'√©tat * Sabotage Non-violent actions which are designed to dissent from the command authority come in the following formats: * Refusal to execute orders * Refusal to deploy or mobilize * Conscientious objection * Disinformation * Espionage * Defection * Leaking of information to the press * Jumping the chain-of-command (appealing to a higher military authority) * Modifying or changing original orders Dissent versus conscientious objection Conscientious objection commonly refers to those who are being drafted into military service, who are not currently in military service. However, there are cases in history where an officer or enlisted member of the military has volunteered for military service (or is drafted) and they find later on that they do not agree with their government's war policies or orders. Dissent in the case of war crimes There are countless examples in recent history where military officers have refused to execute the orders of their superiors because they felt their military was party to war crimes. Several German generals during World War II either refused orders, modified orders, or mounted coups or assassination attempts against the German leader Adolf Hitler. Many of these generals were highly respected by the German people and within the German High Command, notably Erwin Rommel, Claus von Stauffenberg, and Otto von St√ºlpnagel. With respect to recent history, United States and UK involvement in the War in Iraq has produced notable dissenters who, in their words, feel that war crimes have been perpetrated by American and British forces in Iraq. Ehren Watada and Malcolm Kendall-Smith‚Äîan American officer and British officer, respectively‚Äîhave been court martialed for refusing to deploy with their units. Both Watada and Kendall-Smith dissent on the grounds that their respective governments are party to war crimes in Iraq.

Individuals who are developing breasts are at Tanner stage I and II. It is intended to be worn during puberty when the breasts are not yet large enough to fit a standard-sized bra. Training bras often provide minimal or no support, and may serve aesthetic purposes to fulfill cultural norms and local beauty standards. Training bras are usually made of a lightweight material. They are unlined and feature a soft, elastic bra band and soft bra cups. Some have begun wearing sports bras as their first bra, which are similar in construction.Breasts and Bras Prior to the marketing of training bras in the 1960s, a preteen or young teen in Western countries usually wore a camisole. Receiving one's first bra may be seen as a long- awaited rite of passage in her life signifying her coming of age. Bras for pre-teens and those entering puberty were first marketed during the early 20th century, and spiked in the 1950s and 1960s.  Styles  Training bras are usually a lightweight, soft-cup design, unlined, and may resemble a crop top. They are often made of a mixed cotton spandex or cotton Lycra fabric with thin straps and elastic under the growing breasts to hold the garment in place. Training bras may be sold in small, medium, and large sizes, and may be used to conceal nipples and breast buds under outerwear. Some are built into camisoles. They are made in a variety of colors and prints, including lace. As the breasts continue to develop, usually around Tanner stage III, regular bras are available in sizes 30AAA to 38B. The initial training bras offer little if any actual support. Some styles are padded to hide developing breast buds or to increase the perceived size of the breasts.  History  Prior to the 1950s, girls in Western countries typically wore undershirts until their breasts were large enough to fit an adult bra. During the 1940s and 1950s, western media created a \\"mammary fixation\\" that shaped teen perceptions of breast size. Boys noticed girls who were more \\"busty,\\" and particularly American girls were more aware of breast size and their weight. Popular American culture in the 1950s was notable for its focus on full-breasted women like Lana Turner and Jane Russell. The emphasis on the female figure came from several sources: girls wanted bras at an earlier age than ever before, while their mothers felt they should help their daughters develop a \\"good\\" figure; doctors who valued maternity over all other female roles; and companies who saw a profit in persuading girls and their parents that adolescent breasts needed support. In some social circles, a girl's ability to fill a bra became central to her status and sense of self. During the 1950s, doctors in the United States wrote that teen girls needed to wear a bra to prevent sagging breasts, poor circulation, and stretched blood vessels. In magazines like Seventeen and Compact, adolescent girls were encouraged to purchase undergarments like \\"Bobbie\\" bras, Formfit girdles, and \\"Adagio\\" by Maidenform that were \\"teen-proportioned\\". It became common in the 1950s for pre-teen girls in the United States to begin wearing training bras even though their breasts were too small to actually require support. The American Academy of Pediatricians published Puberty: Information for Boys and Girls in 2002. In it, they advised girls: The author points out that young girls are socialized to be more concerned about what other people think about their wearing a bra rather than their own feelings. As a result, young girls may be anxious to acquire their first training bra before their breasts actually need support, if only for social purposes. Girls are then faced with the challenge of keeping current and wearing the latest, fashionable bra. Some young girls avoid wearing a bra, fearing an end to their childhood freedoms, such as going topless. Girls who develop breasts earlier than their peers may be sensitive to comments and teasing. Because bras are built to manufacturers' standards, if the girl's body does not conform to the shape and size of the bra, she may blame herself. Firm, upright breasts are typical of youth. As such, they may not physically require the support of a bra. A Pencil test, developed by Ann Landers, has sometimes been promoted as a criterion to determine whether a girl should begin wearing a bra: a pencil is placed under the breast, and if it stays in place by itself, then wearing a bra is recommended; if it falls to the ground, it is not. Oleg Cassini made a provocative \\"Room at the Top Bra\\" in nylon and Lycra spandex for Peter Pan. In the early 1960s, bra makers marketed to girls 13‚Äì19, and later in '60s they targeted pre-teen girls age 10‚Äì12. New labels like Teenform, Teencharm, and Heaventeen catered to their market. Some companies' advertisements showed girls waist up wearing only a bra. Mercy Dobell, editor of Corset and Underwear Review, wrote that \\"the bra has joined lipstick and 'heels' in becoming one of the beloved symbols of growing up. Mass media encourages teens and tweens to begin wearing lingerie at a younger age, before or as soon as their breasts begin to develop, as a way to advertise their sexuality. The Debevoise Company in 1904 ran an advertisement for the \\"bosom supporter\\" and named it \\"brassiere\\" for the New York advertisement copy. The term brassiere is a Norman French word to describe a child's undershirt.https://www.encyclopedia.com/sports-and- everyday-life/fashion-and-clothing/clothing-jewelry-and-personal- adornment/brassiere Two weeks after the advertisement, the Norman French term \\"brassiere\\" became popular in the United States of America.  Social issues  The design of some training bras do not provide actual support of any kind and may serve aesthetic purposes to fulfill cultural norms and local beauty standards.Science Proves That Wearing Bras Is Bad For Your Health Young pubescent girls may have ambivalent feelings around the experience of buying and wearing their first bra. Some girls avoid wearing a bra because it means they must deal with teasing and other issues with the onset of puberty. Other girls welcome the experience of being able to show the appearance of a bra through their clothes. The young girl may feel pressured to wear a bra before she actually needs any support so she can \\"fit in\\". Once she begins to wear a bra, she may also be pressured to wear clothing that makes her appear older than she is. Girls may experience the opportunity to begin wearing a bra with mixed feelings. On one hand, they may feel \\"grown up\\", but with that status comes a host of expectations about keeping up with the latest styles or colors. Some girls hesitate to accept that some of their childhood freedoms, like going without a shirt or engaging in certain kinds of boyish activities, may be ending. Some girls are embarrassed about wearing a bra and resist parental pressure to take this step, turning the event into a potentially traumatic experience. If a girl is one of the first or one of the last among her peers to begin wearing a bra, she may be teased. Some welcome and others dislike the new attention they receive because they are wearing a bra. Because bras are mass-produced to fit industry standards, a young girl may not understand that an ill-fitting bra is not her fault and may blame herself, thinking something is wrong with her body. = Opposition to training bras = Training bras and the age at which girls first wear bras is sometimes controversial. Some people regard training bras as a way to sexualize young girls, and that training bras serve no functional purpose, that businesses benefit financially from, and even encourage, precocious sexuality in girls by exploiting their fears about self-image and social norms. Still, others recognize developing tissue in breasts as sensitive and, at times, needing cover to maintain comfort, even if only psychological, for the wearer. Bra opponents believe that training bras are used to indoctrinate girls into thinking about their breasts as sexual objects. In their view, bras are not functional undergarments but simply exist to make the body more sexually appealing. They believe that training bras exploit young girls and encourage precocious sexuality. Within Western cultures that place great value upon youth, bras are marketed to emphasize their ability to preserve a youthful appearance. The design of fashionable rather than solely functional bras has been influenced by changing fashions in outerwear and undergarments. The bra is sometimes viewed as an icon of popular culture that eroticizes girls' breasts as sexual objects.  Marketing to young girls  In 2006, Target stores began stocking a range of bras for three- to four-year-olds, Bratz bras for three- to four-year-olds, Saddle Club bras for four- to six-year-olds, and a lightly padded Target brand bra for eight- to 10-year-olds. Australian retailer Big W's added a Just Girls padded bra for eight- to 10-year-olds and a My Little Pony bandeau bra for two- to three-year-olds, and Bonds in February 2006 marketed the \\"My First T-Shirt Bra\\" for ages eight and up.

History The location of the junction was originally on the Wednesbury Canal, a branch of the Birmingham Canal which had been authorised by Act of Parliament in 1768. Because there were collieries at Wednesbury, the branch and the section of the main line from it to Birmingham was opened first, in 1769, and a lucrative trade in coal developed. Between the junction site and Birmingham was a ridge of land, and the six Spon Lane Locks were situated to the east of the site, to raise the line from to the summit level of . At Smethwick, another six locks dropped the canal to the same level, known as the Birmingham Level. The rest of the main line left Spon Lane Locks between the third and fourth lock, at the Wolverhampton Level, and maintained that level to Wolverhampton, where it dropped through twenty locks (later increased by one) to reach the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal at Autherley Junction. This section was completed in 1772. The locks up and over the Smethwick summit caused problems with congestion and with water supply, and in the 1790s, a new cut was made at the Wolverhampton Level, which removed the need for three of the locks at both ends of the summit. This did not alleviate the problem entirely, and in 1825 the engineer Thomas Telford was commissioned to improve the main line. His canal, like others he built, cut across country in as straight a line as possible, using embankments, cuttings and tunnels where necessary to maintain a level. His new main line left the old one at Factory Locks, where three locks dropped the canal to the Birmingham Level, and followed a straight path to Pudding Green Junction, where it intersected the Wednesbury Canal. The old line of that canal between the intersection and Bromford Junction was widened and straightened, and became part of the main line, leaving a shortened Wednesbury Old Canal. To avoid the locks over Smethwick Summit, Telford built a huge cutting, up to deep in places, slightly to the south of the original line. The old line from the top of the remaining three locks at Spon Lane was carried over it at Stewart Aqueduct. Two junctions were created to maintain the connections, Bromford Junction at the west end of the cutting and Smethwick Junction at the east end. The bypass was opened on 18 December 1829, and when the new main line was completed, it reduced the length of James Brindley's winding contour canal by to . Location Spon Lane bottom lock, with the new main line to the right. To the west, the canal is level for to the foot of Factory Locks, passing Pudding Green Junction and the Wednesbury Canal after . To the east it is level to its terminus at Worcester Bar, a distance of . The branch to Spon Lane Locks also heads east, running almost parallel to Telford's cut, and the bottom lock of the three is just a short distance along it. There are two cast iron towpath bridges at the junction, both made at Horseley Ironworks in Tipton. The one over the Spon Lane Locks Branch has an elliptical arch, with abutments made of brick and sandstone dressings. Each side is made in two parts, which are bolted together. It carries the inscription \\"Horseley Iron Works 1829\\", and is a grade II listed structure. The bridge over the new main line is of similar design, but the lattice-work sides were manufactured in three sections, joined by bolts, the middle section of which carries the inscription \\"The Horseley Company Tipton 1848\\". The Spon Lane Locks are also grade II listed.

He was the thesis advisor of future Nobel laureate Gerhard Ertl. The Heinz Gerischer Award of the European section of The Electrochemical Society is named in his honour. Academic career Gerischer studied chemistry at the University of Leipzig between 1937 and 1944 with a two-year interruption because of military service. In 1942, he was expelled from the German army because his mother was born Jewish; he was thus found ‚Äúundeserving to have a part in the great victories of the German Army.‚Äù The war years were difficult for Gerischer, and his mother committed suicide on the eve of her 65th birthday in 1943. His only sister, Ruth (born in 1913), lived underground after escaping from a Gestapo prison and was subsequently killed in an air raid in 1944. In Leipzig, Gerischer joined the group of Karl Friedrich Bonh√∂ffer, a member of a distinguished family, whose members were persecuted and murdered because of their opposition to Nazi ideology. Bonh√∂ffer descended from an illustrious chemical lineage of Wilhelm Ostwald (1853‚Äì1932) and Walther Hermann Nernst (1864‚Äì1941). He kindled Gerischer‚Äôs interest in electrochemistry, supervising his doctoral work on periodic (oscillating) reactions on electrode surfaces. Gerischer completed his doctoral thesis in 1946. He followed Bonh√∂ffer to Berlin where his Ph.D. supervisor had accepted the directorship of the Institute of Physical Chemistry at Humboldt University. There he also became the department head at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry in Berlin-Dahlem (later the Fritz Haber Institute). Gerischer himself was appointed as an ‚ÄúAssist√§nt‚Äù; in 1970 he would return to the Fritz Haber Institute as its Director. With the Berlin Blockade and the prevailing economic conditions, the post-war research was carried out under extremely difficult conditions. Gerischer met his future wife, Renate Gersdorf, at the University of Leipzig where she was doing her diploma work with Prof. C. Weygand. They were married in Berlin in October 1948. In 1949 Gerischer moved his young family to G√∂ttingen to join Bonh√∂ffer as a Research Associate at the newly established Max Planck Institute for Physical Chemistry. In Berlin and G√∂ttingen and especially during the period from 1949 to 1955 Gerischer was interested in electrode kinetics and developed instruments and techniques for their study. It was he who developed the electronic potentiostat, the most widely used instrument of electrochemists. He also monitored fast electrode processes by double potential step and AC modulation. This work laid the foundation for a mechanistic interpretation of electrode reactions and had a lasting impact on our understanding of electrode kinetics. It was recognized by the newly minted Bodenstein Prize of the Deutsche Bunsen-Gesellschaft, which Gerischer and Klaus Vetter jointly received in 1953. He was appointed in 1954 to the position of Department Head and Senior Research Fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Metal Research in Stuttgart. A year later, he received the Habilitation from the University of Stuttgart for his comprehensive study of the discharge of metal ions in corrosion. The years 1954‚Äì1961 in Stuttgart were prolific and it was here that Gerischer began his work on semiconductor electrochemistry. It began with a short note on the electrochemistry of n-type and p-type germanium; a study that grew out of a seminar on solid state physics at the university, where the recent results of Brattain and Garrett on germanium were discussed. Gerischer recognized the theoretical implications of semiconductor electrochemistry in charge transfer and its potential applications in photochemistry and photovoltaic devices. His papers considered the differentiation between Faradaic reactions of electrons and holes (1959), the theory of electron tunneling at semiconductor-electrolyte interfaces, solution Fermi levels, and densities of states. He extended his studies to metal electrodes which he studied with his electronic potentiostat (1957), to stress corrosion (1957), to hydrogen evolution and hydrogen adatom formation (1957), to fast electrode processes (1960) and to the reaction kinetics of water dissociation, which he probed by the microwave pulse method (1961). His work was recognized by his appointment as Associate Professor (‚ÄúExtraordinariat‚Äù) in Electrochemistry at the Technical University in Munich in 1962‚Äì63 followed by his promotion to full professor in 1964 and his appointment as Director of the Institute of Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry. The 1964‚Äì1968 period witnessed a flurry of studies from his group on photoelectrochemistry and photosensitization on electrode materials such as ZnO, CdS, GaAs, silver halides, anthracene, and perylene. In 1969‚Äì1970 he was named Dean of Natural Sciences at the Technical University in Munich. Gerischer returned to Berlin in 1970 to assume the directorship of the Fritz Haber Institute, where he continued his studies of electrode kinetics, semiconductor electrochemistry, and photoelectrochemistry. After becoming Emeritus Director of the Institute, he worked with Adam Heller in 1990‚Äì1991 at the University of Texas at Austin on the rate-controlling role of adsorbed oxygen in titania-assisted photocatalytic processes. His honors and awards included the Olin Palladium Award of the Electrochemical Society (1977), Centenary Lectureship, the Chemical Society, London (1979), DECHEMA Medal, Frankfurt (1982), Electrochemistry Group Medal, The Royal Society of Chemistry, London (1987), Galvani Medal, The Italian Chemical Society (1988), and the Bruno Breyer Medal, The Royal Australian Chemistry Institute (1992).

Next he was appointed health minister and chairman of the environmental protection committee in 1982. His tenure as health minister lasted until 1995. _National Claims for the Hawar Islands_ As one of the highest ranking Bahrainis educated and trained as a lawyer, Al Arrayed advised Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa and his government on the emirate's legal battle with Qatar over the Hawar Islands. In that international dispute, Al Arayyed submitted to the International Court of Justice that Bahrain is sovereign over the Hawar Islands, including Janan and Hadd Janan. Bahrain, as a result of the work and advocacy by Minister Al Arrayed and its other legal advisers, ultimately prevailed at the ICJ, and these islands were recognized by the community of nations as belonging to Bahrain. _Other Cabinet Positions_ Al Arrayed served as municipality minister from 1999 to November 2002. He was appointed Minister of Justice on 11 November 2002. His term lasted until 2005 and he was replaced by Mohammed Ali Sitri.

He did incredible things.\\" stated Walther Gerlach in an interview with T.S.

In: Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences 37 Suppl. (2007), 73‚Äì120. He was later forced to recant all five of the papers he had published in 1935, admitting that his findings and experiments had been fictions. There is evidence that most if not all of his earlier experimental results were forged as well. Canal ray experiments In 1926 Rupp's canal ray experiments seemed to corroborate Einstein's theories on wave‚Äìparticle duality. He published these results in a paper that was printed next to a theoretical paper on the same subject by Einstein, who evidently accepted Rupp's alleged findings as confirming his (Einstein's) theoretical model. Rupp's experimental results were later shown to have been falsified (although subsequent experimental work re-confirmed Einstein's model). Exposure of fraud Although the validity of Rupp's experimental results had been challenged by other workers in the field repeatedly throughout his career, it was not until 1935 that his misdeeds were fully exposed. In 1935 experimentalists Walther Gerlach and Eduard R√ºchardt published a corrected version of Einstein's mirror diagram in an article that argued that Rupp had falsely claimed to have carried out the rotated mirror experiment. Some fellow physicists at the AEG labs grew suspicious of Rupp when he claimed having accelerated protons at 500 kV, something he could not have the technical facilities to achieve. Rupp had to publicly retract five publications from the previous year. He attached a psychiatric diagnosis by Dr. Emil von Gebsattel that said he had written them under the influence of \\"dreamlike states\\" caused by psychasthenia. Rupp never worked again as a physicist, and all other physicists ceased to refer to any of his alleged results.

Under the Childers Reforms it amalgamated with the 99th (Lanarkshire) Regiment of Foot to form the Wiltshire Regiment in 1881. History =Formation, Louisbourg and Carrickfergus= Carrickfergus Castle The formation of the regiment was prompted by the expansion of the army as a result of the commencement of the Seven Years' War. On 25 August 1756 it was ordered that a number of existing regiments should raise a second battalion; among those chosen was the 4th Regiment of Foot. The 2nd Battalion of the 4th Regiment of Foot was formed on 10 December 1756 and renumbered as the 62nd Regiment of Foot on 21 April 1758. Because of a lack of available marine units, four companies of the regiment were assigned to Admiral Edward Boscawen's fleet as marines. In this capacity, they took part in the Siege of Louisbourg in June 1758. Following the capture of Louisbourg, the regiment participated in General James Wolfe's campaign to capture attack on Quebec. The regiment made a diversionary landing at Beauport to confuse the French. Although the siege of Louisbourg was the regiment's first battle, it was more than a century before the War Office recognized the part they played. For decades, commanders of the regiment petitioned the War Office for the Louisbourg honour, which had been granted to the other eleven regiments present during the siege. However, the War Office continually refused, stating that there was no record of the regiment being present. This was true because the records which showed they were present were not held in the War Office. By acting as marines, they had been on the Royal Navy's books and thus the records verifying their part in the battle were held by the Admiralty. The regiment finally received the Louisbourg honour in 1910. The rest of the regiment was assigned to Ireland and eventually assigned as the garrison for Carrickfergus Castle in Carrickfergus, County Antrim.Rudolf, p. 537 On 23 February 1760, a French force of approximately 600 men conducted an amphibious assault and laid siege to the castle. The castle's defences were in a state of disrepair with a 50-foot breach in the wall.Bartlett, p. 226 Under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel John Jennings, the four under-strength companies, approximately 200 men in all, withstood three assaults on the castle. In addition to being outnumbered, the garrison was short of ammunition, having to melt down their buttons to make bullets. By the time the French made their third attack, the defenders had expended all their ammunition and were left with rocks and bayonets. After the third attempt was beaten back, Colonel Jennings was forced to seek terms. After meeting with the French commander, Jennings and his men were allowed to surrender the castle, give their parole, retaining their arms and colours. The French, in return, promised not to plunder the town of Carrickfergus.United Services Magazine, p. 317 Although the regiment surrendered the castle, the French squadron which had landed the force was destroyed by the Royal Navy in an action near the Mull of Galloway. An investigation of the defence of Carrickfergus proclaimed that the men \\"behav'd like Lyons\\".Bartlett, p. 227 The Irish Parliament voted a thanks to the Regiment and Carrickfergus presented the officers with silver cups. In 1761, part of the regiment was sent to Germany to join the British forces serving on the continent. In 1763, the regiment was reunited and deployed to the West Indies where it remained until it was sent to Canada join General William Howe's forces.United Services Magazine, p. 318 =American Revolutionary War= Painting depicting a soldier from the grenadier company and an officer of the same regiment. Given the date when the painting was created, 1772 or 1773, as well as the facings, lace and hats, it appears that the two men are from the 62nd Regiment of Foot. John Anstruther who commanded the regiment during the American Revolutionary War The regiment returned to North America in 1776, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel John Anstruther. Anstruther would command the regiment from 1773 until retirement in 1782. Initially dispatched to Canada, the regiment took part in the Canadian campaign during the American Revolutionary War. The regiment's flank companies would be detached and take part in the Battle of Trois-Rivi√®res in June 1776.Jones, p. 74 The regiment's companies were reunited to support the British drive to clear the Americans from the rest of Canada, including the Battle of Valcour Island in October 1776.Jones, p. 159 Following its participation in the Canadian campaign of 1776, the regiment was assigned to serve as part of Major-General John Burgoyne's forces. The regiment served under Burgoyne at the Battle of Saratoga in September 1777. The regiment was brigaded with the 9th, 20th, and 21st regiments under the command of Major- General James Inglis Hamilton. The regiment surrendered along with the rest of the force and most of the regiment remained imprisoned until 1781 when they were repatriated to England. In 1782, now under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Campbell, the regiment was given, for the first time, the county title \\"Wiltshire\\". =Napoleonic Wars= In 1791, at the start of the French Revolution, the regiment was sent to the West Indies. In 1795, the regiment transferred to Jamaica. The regiment spent most of 1796 fighting in a British invasion of Saint-Domingue (now Haiti). As with the rest of that British expedition, the regiment suffered heavily from yellow fever.United Services Magazine, p. 319 After transferring men to other units, the cadre returned by ship to England in 1797. In 1799, the regiment was expanded into a two battalion regiment. However, with the Treaty of Amiens in 1802, the 2nd battalion was disbanded. When hostilities resumed, a second battalion was once again raised in 1804. Initially, the second battalion was raised for limited service; however the rank and file volunteered for additional services. In 1808, the 2nd battalion was assigned to garrison Jersey, the 1st battalion having been dispatched to Sicily in 1809. The 1st battalion participated in a raid under General John Stuart resulting in the destruction of the magazines at Ischia and Procida. In 1811, elements of the 1st battalion participated in another raid on the Italian mainland. Three companies were landed at Palinuro. For three days, they engaged a French force of approximately 1,000, and in the process destroyed three batteries and captured a French convoy. Detachments of the 1st battalion were used on gunboat duty operating out of Messina. These army crewed gunboats managed to capturing a French privateer and retaking two of her prizes.United Services Magazine, p. 321 In 1812, the 1st battalion was transferred to eastern Spain to support Wellington's forces on the Peninsula. The 2nd battalion, along with the 2nd battalion of the 47th Regiment of Foot and the 2nd battalion of the 84th Regiment of Foot, was attached to Major- General Lord Aylmer's independent brigade during Wellington's offensive across the Pyrenees beginning in 1813. The 2nd battalion then moved on in preparation for the Battle of Bayonne when the war ended. The 2nd battalion was then sent to Ireland after a brief period of occupation duties in France. In 1814, after spending time in Spain, 1st battalion was assigned again to an expedition to Italy. The battalion landed at Livorno before marching on Genoa. Like many other units of the British Army, upon Napoleon's abdication, the 1st battalion was ordered to North America to fight against the United States in the War of 1812. Neither of the battalions of the regiment were present at the Battle of Waterloo. The 1st battalion was sent to the West Indies, while the 2nd battalion was sent to France for occupation duties after the conclusion of the Hundred Days. In 1816 the 2nd battalion was disbanded and its officers put on half-pay. Following the Napoleonic Wars, the regiment returned to Halifax, Nova Scotia. It remained there until 1823 when it was rotated to Ireland. The regiment remained in Ireland until 1830.United Services Magazine, p. 322 =The Victorian era= Depiction of the 62nd Regiment at the Battle of Ferozeshah in December 1845 by Henry Martens. The picture shows the 62nd, based on the buff colour of the flag and of the facings of the British regulars shown, in action, most likely on the second day. The figures in the foreground are most likely members of the regiment's light company. In 1830, the regiment was deployed to India. Arriving in September 1830, the regiment was initially garrisoned at Bangalore. After two relatively quiet years in India, the regiment participated in putting down the abortive Bangalore Mutiny. The next twelve years passed relatively quietly for the regiment. At the end of 1844, the regiment was ordered to Ferozepore. There they joined the British East India Company forces gathering there. From March until December 1845, the regiment garrisoned the area as tensions between British-controlled India and Sikhs escalated. In December 1845, hostilities began in the First Anglo-Sikh War. On 21‚Äì22 December 1845, the regiment fought in the Battle of Ferozeshah. There the British-Company forces, under the command of General Hugh Gough, were successful in a hard-fought battle where the regiment suffered heavy casualties, including 18 out of 23 officers and 281 out of 580 other ranks. The regiment had been part of an attack on the strongest part of the Sikh lines. However, they were unable to carry the position at bayonet point and were forced to retreat with the rest of their division.United Services Magazine, p. 323 By the end of the first day of battle, no officers were left to take charge of the regiment. Command of the regiment devolved to its sergeants and non-commissioned officers. In honor of their leadership, 21 December became a regimental anniversary. Although the honor for Ferozeshah would be considered one of the regiment's crowning moments, it did not come without controversy. In his report of the battle, the divisional commander reported that the regiment was \\"panic-struck\\" during the fighting and that was the cause of its losses. This was contradicted by General Gough's report. In the end, Gough's version was supported by Parliament, the Duke of Wellington, and the army staff at Horse Guards. Although diminished by its losses at Ferozeshah, the regiment also fought at the Battle of Sobraon in February 1846. There they served in General Robert Dick's Division, participating in the main bayonet assault against the Sikh defences once Gough's forces ran out of artillery ammunition. Despite the regiment's exploits at Ferozeshah and Sobaron being among the regiment's proudest honours, the tour in India was also the sight of one its greatest embarrassments. On two separate occasions, the regiment lost its colors. At first, they were lost when the boat carrying them sank in the Ganges in 1842. The second time, after they were recovered, they burned when the same boat caught fire in 1847.Rutt, p. 185 The regiment remained in India for another two years. In that time, the regiment was garrisoned at various stations in India, in addition to performing ceremonial duties for visiting dignitaries. The regiment returned to England in 1847 before being sent to Ireland in 1854. =Crimean War= Photograph of the interior of the Great Redan after the fall of Sevastopol. For the next few years the regiment served in Ireland, assigned to the garrison at Fermoy. In January 1854, with war brewing in the Black Sea, the regiment was put on notice for service in Crimea.United Services Magazine, p. 324 The regiment saw action in the Crimean War as part of the Second Division. The regiment participated in the Siege of Sevastopol in winter 1854. On 8 September 1855, the regiment was among the battalions which took part in the failed assault of the Redan bastion. Once again, the regiment suffered heavy casualties, including half of its officers and senior non-commissioned officers. =Canada, Ireland, India, Aden and Amalgamation= The regiment returned to Canada in 1857 and remained there until 1864 when it came home. A year later, the regiment returned to Ireland and engaged the Fenians in an action at Kilmallock while defending some police barracks in March 1867. Two years later, the regiment returned to India and traveled through the Punjab in July 1879.See India List for July 1879, s.v. Surgeon P J O'Sullivan. The regiment then transferred to Aden in 1880. As part of the Cardwell Reforms of the 1870s, where single-battalion regiments were linked together to share a single depot and recruiting district in the United Kingdom, the 62nd was linked with the 99th (Lanarkshire) Regiment of Foot, and assigned to district no. 38 at Le Marchant Barracks in Devizes. On 1 July 1881 the Childers Reforms came into effect and the regiment amalgamated with the 99th (Lanarkshire) Regiment of Foot to form the Wiltshire Regiment.

It aired on November 5, 2007. Plot As the episode opens, Takezo Kensei ties Hiro to a board, facing a haze of opium smoke, preventing Hiro from using his powers. Whitebeard had offered Kensei anything he wanted to capture Hiro and to lead his army. He chose to rule half of Japan and take Yaeko as his princess. Soon after, while their guards are distracted, Yaeko frees herself and takes the opium away from Hiro. As the guards return, Hiro uses his newfound ability to instantly blow an opium high, teleporting himself, Yaeko, and Yaeko's father to safety. Later in the night, he materializes in White Beard's armory where he plans on destroying the guns, only to find Kensei waiting for him. Though Hiro still has faith in him, Kensei attacks Hiro, provoking a sword fight. In the fight, a lantern is tipped over and the fire spreads to the gunpowder. Realizing they are in mortal danger, Hiro offers his hand to Kensei in order to escape, which Kensei refuses. Left with no choice, Hiro teleports away just before the tent explodes and later finds Kensei's helmet in the smoldering ruins from the fire. When meeting with Yaeko, he cautions that in Kensei's final trial, he has to cut out his own heart to save her life and all of Japan. Hiro realizes he must return to his own time, and with a final kiss, he is gone. Meanwhile, Ando sees the charred mask on his desk, turning around to see Hiro smiling at him. Their reunion, however, is dampened when Ando tells Hiro of his father's murder during his absence. In Ukraine, Noah Bennet snaps photos of Isaac Mendez paintings and phones to tell Mohinder Suresh he has them after which he lights them all on fire. Mohinder hangs up the phone with Bennet as alarms blare. Nathan Petrelli and Matt Parkman arrive with details on their encounter with Matt‚Äôs father, Maury Parkman. They say Maury is coming to kill Bob next, which causes Bob to begin evacuation procedures at the Company facility. Peter Petrelli and Caitlin, still a year in the future in 2008, wander the streets of New York City, but the streets seem deserted; everyone has been evacuated by Homeland Security. An armored car speeds toward them and men in hazmat suits grab them, asking if they are sick or infected. After he and Caitlin are hosed down, Peter asks what's going on. The officer in charge of Peter's admission to the quarantine facility shows him a storage room full of body bags through a window with a biohazard symbol in its corner, confirming the painting Isaac had done of him in the pictures Noah Bennet destroyed. The officer reveals that people in the general population are being affected by the Shanti virus and 93% of the world's population are dead while the rest are living in quarantine zones hoping for a cure to be found. Later he meets his mother, who he does not recognize despite mentions of his brother and the fact that he's the most powerful of all the heroes due to his ability to mimic abilities. Motivated by Angela's demands, he utilizes Parkman's mind reading ability and is able to rebuild some of his lost memories (specifically those relating to his mother). With flashbacks ensuing in his head, Peter finally remembers her and they share a tearful embrace. While being escorted through the facility by his mother, Peter sees Caitlin in a deportation line - he attempts to rescue Caitlin, but accidentally time travels back to the building in Montreal, leaving her behind. Claire Bennet wakes up finding West in her kitchen preparing waffles for breakfast. When Claire's mom leaves the room, she scolds West for stopping by the house. He shows her a newspaper article about the drunk cheerleader claiming she saw a flying boy, and Claire tells West they have to be more careful. Claire and West make out on the couch, but she can't stop looking at his tracking marks. They get up to go to the kitchen. When West turns around, he sees Mr. Bennet arrive home. He grabs Claire and runs outside, where she reveals that it was her father who abducted him. Scared and confused, West believes Claire deliberately led him into a trap and flies away. Bob forces Mohinder to bait Maury Parkman so he can inject him with the virus. Mohinder worries that this might put the entire population at risk. Niki offers to \\"persuade\\" him to take the virus but Bob tells Matt he has the same abilities as Maury; anything one's brain controls, Matt can control as well, making him the only one who can counter Maury. Matt apologizes to an unconscious Molly Walker, adding that he doesn't have his father's abilities like Bob said. When Matt says, \\"I love you, Molly,\\" there's a blip on her monitor. Nathan asks Bob about \\"Adam Monroe,\\" one of the founding members of the Company. He tells Nathan about the early days of the Company, when Adam convinced them they all belonged together to make the world a better place. Bob says that the \\"visionary\\" Adam is the one trying to kill them and he's using Maury as his \\"blunt weapon\\", to kill those in the Company. Years before, Adam talked about holocausts, plagues, and punishing humanity to save the world, thoughts shared by Mr. Linderman, a \\"disciple\\" of Adam. They locked Adam up and threw away the key, but he escaped two weeks before. Bob tells Nathan that Peter is alive and somehow involved with Adam Monroe. In the hall, Mohinder frets to Niki Sanders that it is morally unacceptable to give Maury the virus. Niki says no one will die, emphasizing that the Company saved her. When Mohinder leaves, she turns around and sees a vision of D.L. Hawkins who tells her she is a killer and by the end of the day, she will kill everyone. When she leaves the hall, Maury Parkman emerges from a door. Mohinder catches Niki talking to D.L., who is not really there; an unseen Maury is manipulating her mind. Mohinder tries to help, but she punches him in the face, revealing how Mohinder ends up with his nose broken. Bob shows Nathan a video of Peter taken at the Company facility. As they talk, Niki punches the door open (realizing another of Isaac's eight paintings) as Matt goes to find his father, only to walk into a dream world where Maury keeps Molly imprisoned. Matt calls for his father, and Maury appears, brought to the nightmare via Matt's newly realized abilities. In the other room, Niki cannot fight off Maury's parasitic attachment to her mind and stabs herself with a syringe containing the virus. Matt summons all of his strength, grabs Molly, and walks out of the nightmare, leaving Maury trapped in what Matt realizes is Maury's own nightmare. Matt comes to in Molly's room where she wakes up to find Maury collapsed on the ground. Mohinder gives Niki an infusion of his own blood to eradicate the virus in her system. However, when it does not work, Mohinder realizes that his blood no longer possesses humoral immunity and that the new strain of the virus is now completely incurable. Bob says they will keep Maury sedated and destroy every last vial. Bob shows Mohinder Claire's file and says that she may be the only way to save Niki. He also tells Mohinder that Bennet killed Company operative Ivan. Mohinder confesses that he has been working with Bennet to take down the Company. Bob says there is a storm coming and that Claire's ability could cure the virus, before presenting him with the gun seen in the painting. Bennet comes home and slaps the newspaper story about the drunk cheerleader in front of Claire, yelling at her for risking exposure. \\"It's not safe here, anymore,\\" Bennet says. \\"Pack your bags... we're leaving.\\" Instead of obeying, Claire angrily refuses to leave and runs upstairs. Meanwhile, back in Montreal, Peter attempts to teleport back to the future to save Caitlin, but is unable to access his time powers. Suddenly distracted by a noise coming from behind him, Peter swings around and looses a bolt of electricity. A hand appears from behind a painting and catches the bolt, leaving the flesh charred and blackened, but instantly regenerates a moment later. Takezo Kensei appears from behind the wall, revealing himself to be the mysterious Adam Monroe. Peter still doesn't recognize who Adam is. Adam comments to Peter, \\"We are going to change history.\\" Critical reception Until Season 3, Out of Time was the lowest rated episode of Heroes. It averaged only 9.87 million viewers in its original airing. In the 18-49 demographic, \\"Out of Time\\" earned a 4.9/11 ratings share. Sean O'Neal of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C+. Robert Canning of IGN scored the episode 8 out of 10. References External links * *Beaming Beeman - Season 2, Episode 7 - Director's blog on the filming of this episode.

She was constructed at Toulon between 1666 and 1669 under the direction of Rodolphe G√©d√©on and served as flagship of the French fleet in the Mediterranean. While intended when first built to serve as the flagship of Fran√ßois de Bourbon- Vendome, Duc de Beaufort, for the Cretan campaign of 1669, she was not ready in time and she saw no service until 1677. She underwent reconstruction at Toulon from December 1676 to April 1677; four of her 24-pounder guns were replaced by four 36-pounders on the lower deck, two more 18-pounders were added on her middle deck, and two 6-pounders were removed from her quarterdeck, thus keeping her as a 104-gun ship. She then sailed from Toulon on 11 May 1677, under the command of Abraham Duquesne, to Messina in Sicily, at the head of a small squadron to support rebels opposing Spanish rule there. On returning to Toulon, she saw no further sea service until taken out of service in 1691. On his visit to Toulon in 1683, the English naval engineer Edmund Dummer described the Royal Louis as \\"a great ship and glorious in her first carving, no doubt; but to my judgment not of good proportion, nor good workmanship, her figure under water I know not, nor is that above to be admired\\". She was removed from service in 1691, and taken to pieces at Toulon in 1697, having been replaced by a new First Rank ship of the same name.

The season lasts from October 2007 to March 2008. Australian Cricket Team The national team reached the semi- finals of the one major international tournament during the season, the World Twenty20 in South Africa, and will also play a number of international matches during tours. Australia are confirmed to host six Test matches, 11 One-day Internationals and two Twenty20 Internationals, and play seven One-day Internationals abroad, all in a series with India. In addition, tours of Pakistan in March and West Indies in April are on the ICC Future Tours Programme, but no schedule has been confirmed. Pura Cup The Pura Cup is scheduled to begin on 12 October with the four-day match between Queensland and Tasmania. After a home and away round robin league, where each team plays 10 first class matches, the two top teams qualify for the five-day final, to be played between 16 March and 20 March. One Day Domestic The One Day Domestic Cup began on 10 October with last season's finalists Queensland losing to Tasmania by 89 runs under the Duckworth-Lewis method. As in the Pura Cup, the top two teams after the home and away rounds, which were Tasmania and Victoria, faced off against each other in the final at Bellerive Oval on 23 February. In a tense, rain-affected game, Tasmania just squeezed past Victoria by one wicket under the Duckworth-Lewis method. Twenty20 Domestic The KFC Twenty20 Big Bash has been expanded again this season, from 13 to 16 matches in total, so each state plays each other once. The tournament opens on 31 December and lasts until 13 January, coinciding with the second Test between Australia and India. Last season each team would only play four games, and could thus not meet all teams during the round robin stage, but this has now been corrected. Victoria, two-time Twenty20 champions, will, however, play three away games.

As a player, he scored 79 goals from 379 appearances in the Football League playing for Barnsley, Bury, Oxford United and Scunthorpe United. As a manager, he took charge of Lincoln City twice, Grimsby Town, Rotherham United and Boston United. Managerial career Kerr managed Lincoln City from July to December 1977. In July 1978 he became first team coach of Grimsby Town. In 1979 he became their manager and The Mariners won the Third Division championship in 1980 in Kerr's first season in charge. They finished 7th in the Second Division the following season after challenging for promotion, with the side third in the table with seven games remaining, and a return to Division One after a 33-year absence looked very much on the cards, but the club's form fell away afterwards, with them winning only one more game. That form was not maintained the following season despite a good start, and with Grimsby bottom of the league Kerr was sacked on 11 January 1982 to make way for his assistant, David Booth. He was appointed manager of Rotherham United on 21 March 1983 but was unable to save the club from relegation to the Third Division. He remained in charge for another two years, first avoiding relegation and then challenging for promotion, being third in November and December, before finishing mid-table. In November 1983, Rotherham knocked out first division Southampton in the League Cup. In June 1985, Kerr returned to Lincoln where despite the presence of Phil Turner and Neil Redfearn in midfield, the side was relegated to the Fourth Division. He remained in charge the following season, which began well with the Imps as high as 7th in the New Year. An inexplicable collapse in form followed and Kerr left the club in March, before Lincoln became the first club to be relegated from the Football League to the Conference. He later managed Boston United and was a scout. Media career He is currently an expert summariser on BBC Radio Humberside. He usually co-commentates on Scunthorpe games and occasionally on Grimsby matches.

The book illustrated many odd-looking and unknown plants from the New World, and was designed as a reference work on medicinal plants for the use of physicians and apothecaries.  Biography  right Illustration from A Curious Herbal Illustration from Herbarium Blackwellianum = Aberdeen = Elizabeth Blachrie was the daughter of a successful Scottish merchant in Aberdeen and was trained as an artist. She secretly married her cousin, Alexander Blackwell (1709‚Äì47), a Scottish doctor and economistScots in Sweden - Eighteenth Century and settled in Aberdeen where he maintained a medical practice. Although his education was sound, his qualifications were questioned, leading to the young couple‚Äôs hasty move to London, fearing charges that Alexander was practicing illegally. = London = In London, Alexander became associated with a publishing firm, and having gained some experience, established his own printing house, despite not belonging to a guild nor having served the required apprenticeship as a printer. He was charged with flouting the strict trade rules, and heavily fined, forcing him to close his shop. =Prison= By now Blackwell was destitute. Because of Alexander‚Äôs lavish spending and the fines that had been imposed, the couple were heavily in debt - Alexander found himself in debtor‚Äôs prison. With her husband in gaol, a household to run, a child to care for, and with no income, the situation was desperate. She learned that a herbal was needed to depict and describe exotic plants from the New World. She decided that she could illustrate it, and that Alexander, given his medical background, could write the descriptions of the plants. As she completed the drawings, Blackwell would take them to her husband‚Äôs cell where he supplied the correct names in Latin, Greek, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, and German. Unlike her husband, Blackwell was untrained in botany. To compensate for this, she was aided by Isaac Rand, then curator of the Chelsea Physick Garden, where many of these new plants were under cultivation. At Rand‚Äôs suggestion, she relocated near the Garden so she could draw the plants from life. In addition to the drawings, Blackwell engraved the copper printing plates for the 500 images and text, and hand- coloured the printed illustrations. The first printing of A Curious Herbal met with moderate success, both because of the meticulous quality of the illustrations and the great need for an updated herbal. Physicians and apothecaries acclaimed the work, and it received a commendation from the Royal College of Physicians. A second edition was printed 20 years later in a revised and enlarged format in Nuremberg by Dr. Christoph Jacob Trew, a botanist and physician, between 1757 and 1773. Revenue from the book led to Alexander‚Äôs release from prison. However, within a short while debts again accumulated, forcing the couple to sell some of the publication rights to the book. Alexander also became involved in several unsuccessful business ventures, and eventually left the family to start a new life in Sweden. = Sweden = Alexander Blackwell arrived in Sweden in 1742 and carried on with agricultural experiments he had started when in Aberdeen. These included the breeding of horses and sheep, and dairy management. His achievements were recognised, and he was appointed court physician to Frederick I of Sweden. Blackwell attempted to strengthen the diplomatic ties between Great Britain, Denmark and Sweden. As Great Britain had no ambassador in Sweden, he contacted a Minister in Denmark. On circumstantial evidence he was accused of conspiracy against the Crown Prince. He was tried and sentenced to be decapitated. He remained in good spirits to the last - at the block, having laid his head wrong, he remarked that since it was his first beheading, he lacked experience and needed instruction. On 9 August 1747 he was executed as his wife was leaving London to join him. Little is known of Blackwell's later years. She was buried on 27 October 1758, and her grave is at All Saints Church in Chelsea, London.Elizabeth Blackwell - National Library of Scotland She remained loyal to Alexander throughout, even sharing royalties with him from the sale of additional book rights. Blackwell has a genus of plants named after her, Blackwellia of the class Dodecandria Pentagynia. There are six sub species of Blackwellia; Blackwellia Panticulata, Blackwellia Glauca, Blackwellia Nipaulensis, Blackwellia Axillaris, Blackwellia Siralis, Blackwellia Padifolia. These species are native to R√©union, Mauritius, Nepal, Madagascar, Peru and China respectively.The Gardeners Dictionary, Volume 1  Featured at the British Library  Blackwell's \\"A Curious Herbal\\" has featured on the British Library website as a \\"classic of botanical illustration.\\" The book is available to view online using the Turning the Pages system.Turning the Pages, the British Library  Publications  * A curious herbal: containing five hundred cuts, of the most useful plants, which are now used in the practice of physick engraved on folio copper plates, after drawings taken from the life / by Elizabeth Blackwell.

Instead of an embassy, the diplomatic mission is generally called a high commission. History and terminology In the British Empire (most of which became the Commonwealth), high commissioners were envoys of the Imperial government appointed to manage protectorates or groups of territories not fully under the sovereignty of the British Crown, while Crown colonies (British sovereign territories) were normally administered by a governor, and the most significant possessions, large confederations and the self-governing dominions were headed by a governor- general. For example, when Cyprus came under British administration in 1878 it remained nominally under the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire. The representative of the British government and head of the administration was titled high commissioner until Cyprus became a Crown colony in 1925, when the incumbent high commissioner became the first governor. Another example were the high commissioners for Palestine. A high commissioner could also be charged with the last phase of decolonisation, as in the Crown colony of the Seychelles, where the last governor became high commissioner in 1975, when self-rule under the Crown was granted, until 1976, when the archipelago became an independent republic within the Commonwealth. =Other usage= As diplomatic residents (as diplomatic ranks were codified, this became a lower class than ambassadors and high commissioners) were sometimes appointed to native rulers, high commissioners could likewise be appointed as British agents of indirect rule over native states. Thus high commissioners could be charged with managing diplomatic relations with native rulers and their states (analogous to the resident minister), and might have under them several resident commissioners or similar agents attached to each state. In regions of particular importance, a commissioner-general was appointed to have control over several high commissioners and governors, e.g. the commissioner-general for South-East Asia had responsibility for Malaya, Singapore and British Borneo. The first high commissioner of India to London was appointed in 1920; he had no political role, but mostly dealt with the business interests of 'Indian Federation'. The first agent of the Indian government was appointed to South Africa in 1927.Lorna Lloyd, Diplomacy with a difference: the Commonwealth Office of High Commissioner, 1880‚Äì2006 (Volume 1 of Diplomatic studies), Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 2007. , p. 131 Although not a dominion, the self-governing colony of Southern Rhodesia was represented in the United Kingdom by a high commission in London, while the United Kingdom similarly had a high commission in Salisbury. Following the Unilateral Declaration of Independence by the government of Ian Smith in 1965, the Rhodesian high commissioner, Andrew Skeen was expelled from London, while his British counterpart, Sir John Johnston, was withdrawn by the British government.Sir John Johnston, Daily Telegraph, 25 October 2005 =Governors also acting as high commissioners= The role of high commissioner for Southern Africa was coupled with that of British governor of the Cape Colony in the 19th century, giving the colonial administrator in question responsibility both for administering British possessions and relating to neighbouring Boer settlements. Historically, the protectorates of Bechuanaland (now Botswana), Basutoland (now Lesotho) and Swaziland were administered as high commission territories by the Governor-General of the Union of South Africa who was also the British high commissioner for Bechuanaland, Basutoland, and Swaziland until the 1930s, with various local representatives, then by the British high commissioner (from 1961 ambassador) to South Africa, who was represented locally in each by a resident commissioner. The British governor of the Crown colony of the Straits Settlements, based in Singapore, doubled as high commissioner of the Federated Malay States, and had authority over the resident-general in Kuala Lumpur, who in turn was responsible for the various residents appointed to the native rulers of the Malay states under British protection. The British Western Pacific Territories were permanently governed as a group of minor insular colonial territories, under one single, not even full-time, Western Pacific high commissioner (1905‚Äì53), an office attached first to the governorship of Fiji, and subsequently to that of the Solomon Islands, represented in each of the other islands units: by a Resident Commissioner, Consul or other official (on tiny Pitcairn Islands a mere chief magistrate). The high commissioner to New Zealand ex officio is the governor of the Pitcairn Islands. =Dominions= The first dominion high commissioner was appointed by Canada as its envoy in London. Previously, Sir John Rose, 1st Baronet, a Canadian businessman resident in London and former Canadian finance minister, had acted as the personal representative of the Canadian prime minister Sir John A. Macdonald, from 1869 to 1874 and then was given the title of Financial Commissioner from 1874 until 1880. Alexander Mackenzie, while he was prime minister, appointed Edward Jenkins a British Member of Parliament with links to Canada, to act as the government's representative in London as agents-general (1874‚Äì1876), followed by former Nova Scotia premier William Annand (1876‚Äì1878). When Macdonald returned to power in 1878 he requested to elevate the position of financial commissioner to resident minister, but was denied the request by the British government who instead offered to allow the designation of high commissioner. The Canadian government appointed Alexander Tilloch Galt as the first high commissioner of Canada to the United Kingdom in 1880. New Zealand appointed a high commissioner in 1905, in place of a resident agent-general who had been appointed since 1871. Australia did the same in 1910, and South Africa in 1911.\\"What's in a name?\\" ‚Äì The curious tale of the office of high commissioner, by Lorna Lloyd The British government continued not to appoint high commissioners to the Dominions, holding that the British government was already represented by the relevant governor-general or governor. This arrangement began to create problems after the First World War with Dominions expecting a greater degree of control over their external and foreign affairs and beginning to challenge the constitutional role of their governors-general. In Canada, matters came to a head during the King‚ÄìByng affair of 1926, when the governor-general refused the advice of the Canadian prime minister to dissolve parliament and call elections, as would normally apply under the Westminster system. The incident led to the Balfour Declaration made at the Imperial Conference of 1926 that established that governors-general in the independent Dominions were not the representatives of the United Kingdom government but the personal representatives of the monarch. In 1930, Australia broke another tradition by insisting that the monarch act on the advice of the Australian prime minister in the appointment of the governor-general, and insisted on the appointment of Sir Isaac Isaacs, the first Australian-born person to serve in the office. The practice became the norm throughout the Commonwealth. The first British high commissioner to a dominion was appointed in 1928 to Canada. South Africa received a British high commissioner in 1930; Australia in 1936; and New Zealand in 1939. The first high-ranking official envoy from one dominion to another was appointed by South Africa to Canada in 1938.Lorna Lloyd, Diplomacy with a difference: the Commonwealth Office of High Commissioner, 1880‚Äì2006 (Volume 1 of Diplomatic studies), Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 2007. , p. 58 Yet, because of various procedural complications, only in 1945 was South African envoy to Canada designated officially as high commissioner. New Zealand appointed a high commissioner to Canada in 1942, and a high commissioner to Australia in 1943. In 1973, the then Australian Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, proposed that the title be replaced with that of ambassador, but other Commonwealth members in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean indicated a preference for keeping the separate title and status of high commissioner, and the matter was not pursued further.Lorna Lloyd, Diplomacy with a difference: the Commonwealth Office of High Commissioner, 1880‚Äì2006 (Volume 1 of Diplomatic studies), Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 2007. , p. 261 Current practice The Tanzanian High Commission in London. Tanzania and the United Kingdom are both members of the Commonwealth of Nations. As sixteen Commonwealth members, known as the Commonwealth realms, share the same monarch as head of state (currently Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II), diplomatic relations between these countries are traditionally at a governmental level. In diplomatic usage, a high commissioner is considered equivalent in rank and role to an ambassador. A high commissioner from one Commonwealth realm to another carries a simple and often informal letter of introduction from one head of government (prime minister) to that of another, host country, while ambassadors carry formal letters of credence from their head of state addressed to the host country's head of state. The difference in accreditation is also reflected in the formal titles of envoys to Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth states: e.g., British high commissioners to the Commonwealth countries are formally titled \\"The High Commissioner for Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom\\", whereas British ambassadors to non-Commonwealth countries are known as \\"Her Britannic Majesty's Ambassador\\". For historical reasons, high commissioners are also appointed even in the case of republics in the Commonwealth and indigenous monarchies (e.g. the kingdoms of Tonga, Swaziland, etc., who have monarchs other than the reigning British monarch) within the Commonwealth. In this case, letters of commission are usually issued by one head of state and presented to the other. However, some Commonwealth governments may choose to use the more informal method of issuing prime-ministerial letters of introduction, while other governments have opted instead for letters of credence. Instead of embassies, the diplomatic missions of Commonwealth countries are called high commissions, although it is possible for a country to appoint a high commissioner without having a permanent mission in the other country: e.g. the British high commissioner in Suva, Fiji, is also accredited as high commissioner to Kiribati, Tuvalu and Tonga. Zimbabwe, as a Commonwealth country, traditionally had high commissioners in other Commonwealth countries. When it withdrew from the Commonwealth, it changed the style of its high commissions to embassies. Outside the capital, practice is less standard. Subordinate commissioners or deputy high commissioners may be appointed instead of consuls, and the commissioner's mission may be known as a consulate, commission or deputy high commission. Historically, in British colonies, independent Commonwealth countries were represented by commissions. For example, Canada,Colonial Reports Report on Sarawak, Great Britain, Colonial Office 1961, page 7 AustraliaLosing the Blanket: Australia and the End of Britain's Empire, David Goldsworthy Melbourne University Publish, 2002, page 28 and New ZealandExternal Affairs Review, Volume 6, New Zealand. Dept. of External Affairs 1956, page 41 maintained commissions in Singapore, while following its independence in 1947, India established commissions in Kenya,Indian Coffee: Bulletin of the Indian Coffee Board, Volume 21, Coffee Board, 1957, page 202 Trinidad and Tobago,Caribbean Studies, Volume 16, Institute of Caribbean Studies, University of Puerto Rico, 1977, page 22 and MauritiusThe Establishment and Cultivation of Modern Standard Hindi in Mauritius, Lutchmee Parsad Ramyead, Mahatma Gandhi Institute, 1985, page 86 which became high commissions on independence.

For example, the British Sovereign receives high commissioners before ambassadors, and sends a coach and four horses to fetch new high commissioners to the palace, whereas new ambassadors get only two horses. High commissioners also attend important ceremonies of state, such as the annual Remembrance Sunday service at the cenotaph in Whitehall (commemorating Commonwealth war dead) and royal weddings and funerals.

History =Formation= Robert Abercromby, founder of the regiment, by George Romney Siege of Bharatpur in January 1805 The regiment was raised in Stirling by Colonel Robert Abercromby for service in India as the 74th (Highland) Regiment of Foot in October 1787. In accordance with the Declaratory Act 1788 the cost of raising the regiment was recharged to East India Company on the basis that the act required that expenses \\"should be defrayed out of the revenues\\" arising there. First assembled in June 1788, the regiment proceeded to England and embarked for India arriving there by the end of the year.Leask, p. 95Stewart, p. 241 It saw action at the Siege of Seringapatam in February 1792 during the Third Anglo-Mysore War.

JSTOR. 4 March 2009. Bentinck established a new constitution under which the Sicilians gained an autonomy they had never experienced before. The constitution set up the separation of the legislative and executive powers and abolished the feudalistic practices that had been established and recognised for the past 700 years. Bentinck went on to lead an Anglo-Sicilian force, involving the regiment, which raided the Calabrian coast in February 1813. The regiment transferred to the Ionian Islands in July 1814 and to Gibraltar in 1821 before returning to England in 1823. =The Victorian era= The Capture of Delhi, 1857 Hong Kong, 1869 The regiment embarked for the Cape Colony in 1830 and took part in the Sixth Xhosa War in December 1834.Theal, p. 262 It returned home in 1843 and then embarked for India again in 1849. The regiment, as part of the first storming column, led a bayonet charge at the Siege of Delhi in June 1857 during efforts to suppress the Indian Rebellion. It was also engaged at the Siege of Lucknow in November 1857 and formed the funeral party for Major-General Sir Henry Havelock later that month before going on to take part in the Capture of Lucknow in March 1858. The regiment returned home in 1862 and was renamed the 75th (Stirlingshire) Regiment of Foot later in November 1862. It was deployed to Gibraltar again in 1867, to Hong Kong in 1868 and to Singapore in 1869 before returning to the Cape Colony in 1870. It returned home again in 1875. As part of the Cardwell Reforms of the 1870s, where single-battalion regiments were linked together to share a single depot and recruiting district in the United Kingdom, the 75th was linked with the 39th (Dorsetshire) Regiment of Foot, and assigned to district no. 39 at Dorchester Barracks in Dorchester.

HONK!, also known as HONK! Fest, is a festival of activist street bands held annually on Columbus Day weekend in Somerville, Massachusetts. Each year since 2006, an all-volunteer organizing community invites more than 25 bands from around New England, North America, and the world to participate in this free three-day event that showcases acoustic and ambulatory bands playing free music in public spaces. Since its inception, it has inspired additional HONK! festivals in other locations. Description HONK!s so far have been staged in Somerville, Massachusetts; Seattle, Washington; Austin, Texas; Providence, Rhode Island; New York, New York; Eugene, Oregon; Montpelier, Vermont; Spokane, Washington; Rio de Janeiro, S√£o Paulo, Bras√≠lia, Brazil; and Wollongong, NSW, Australia. Although each festival is locally organized and there is no central HONK! authority, they share common features. Each HONK! invites twelve to over thirty bands, who play multiple sets in outdoor public spaces over the course of two or three days. These shows are free to attend. Some HONK!s also feature a parade. The festivals are volunteer-run and get support from local sponsors. The bands invited to play at HONK! share common characteristics: they are ambulatory, they use instruments that can be simultaneously carried and played, and they utilize little or no electronic amplification. As a result, the bands are able to play while moving. There is no generally agreed-upon label for this type of band; labels in use include \\"activist street band,\\" \\"radical marching band,\\" and \\"community street band.\\" Dead Music Capital Band playing at the Honk! festival in Austin, TX. 2013 Although many of the bands that play at HONK! have the phrase \\"marching band\\" in their names, they bear only superficial resemblance to a traditional marching band. Traditional marching band characteristics derive from their military history: they tend to feature regimented, synchronized movement and matching uniforms, and play music that has been composed and arranged in advance, with the goal of presenting the band as a cohesive unit without any differentiation between individual members. Band members are typically drawn from and affiliated with some larger organization, such as a school. A HONK!-style street band, on the other hand, more often tends to encourage the individuality of its members: it may have a theme to its garb rather than a uniform, with individual members free to implement that theme in a manner of their own choosing; similarly, its music may offer more chances for improvisation. Many HONK! bands incorporate traditional marching band instrumentation, sometimes augmented with other instruments or vocalists; others use instrumentation drawn from non-Western music traditions, such as those of a Brazilian samba school. A HONK! band may exist for a specific purpose‚Äîsome perform primarily at activist events, for instance‚Äîbut they are typically autonomous entities not affiliated with another organization. History The longest-running HONK! has taken place in Somerville, Massachusetts' Davis Square neighbourhood every October since 2006. It was begun by a committee of members from a Somerville activist band, The Second Line Social Aid and Pleasure Society Brass Band, who saw the need for a gathering of like-minded souls interested in applying the joy of music to the work of promoting peace, social justice, and civic engagement. Since 2007, it has included a parade titled \\"Reclaim the Streets for Horns, Bikes and Feet!\\" The parade features the bands along with other non-musician participants, including puppeteers and visual artists such as the Bread & Puppet Theater and organizations that promote transportation alternatives and environmental and social justice, such as Bikes Not Bombs. Other HONK! Fests HONK NYC! was born in 2007 when The Pink Puffers (Rome, Italy), Environmental Encroachment (Chicago), and March Fourth (Portland, Oregon), visited New York City following that year‚Äôs HONK! in Somerville. Events around the city included a dinner party at the space The Change You Want to See on Havermeyer Street, hosted by members of Brooklyn‚Äôs Hungry March Band. This set up a tradition of creating events for bands that wanted to visit NYC and play gigs after HONK! fest. In 2008, Titubanda from Rome were presented in parties, parades, parks, and rallies. In 2009, the name BONK! Brooklyn HONK Festival was adopted and used through 2011. The festival was renamed as HONK NYC! In 2012. In addition to small parades and free outdoor gigs, HONK NYC also has ticketed nighttime events in clubs and warehouse spaces. Starting in 2008, HONK! Fest West has been held every spring in Seattle.HonkFest West official site, accessed 12 April 2009. In its second year, HONK!

Subsequent years have used South Congress instead of East Sixth.Official Page HONK!TX website HONK! Fest Eugene (PKA Yonk!) was founded in June 2015 when local Brazilian percussion ensemble Samba Ja hosted SambAmore (Arcata, CA), Environmental Encroachment (Chicago), Junkadelic (Australia) along with local bands Kef, The Beatcrunchers, and High Step Street Band on 2 outdoor stages. Since then it has been held every year in the Whiteaker neighborhood of Eugene, Oregon the week following HONK! Fest West in Seattle. It features traveling groups from Seattle's festival as well as local percussion and brass ensembles. In 2017 the festival changed names from Yonk! to Honk! Fest Eugene and grew into a 2-day festival and retreat for touring bands.

She was designed and built at Brest Dockyard by L√©on-Michel Guignace.  Career  In 1780, Royal Louis was under Beaussier de Chateauvert. She took part in the Battle of Cape Spartel on 20 October 1782 under Beausset, with Verdun de La Crenne as flag captain, although she did not engage. She was renamed R√©publicain in September 1792. Under this name, she took part in the Third Battle of Ushant, being the last ship of the French rear. She was attacked, totally dismasted, and struck her colours; however, the British failed to possession, and she returned to Rochefort. On 24 December 1794, she took part in the Croisi√®re du Grand Hiver. As the fleet exited Brest harbour, she ran aground with the loss of 10 men. Her crew abandoned ship, and the wreck was destroyed in a tempest a few days later.

The chain is part of the Casual Dining Group, who also own Caf√© Rouge and Las Iguanas. History Bella Italia started life as two small restaurant chains - Pastificio and Pizzaland - which were part of the Grand Metropolitan group. In 1990, Michael Guthrie (former Chairman of Mecca Leisure Group) formed BrightReasons and bought the Pizzaland and Pastificio chains from Grand Metropolitan for ¬£20m in February 1991, rebranding Pastificio to Bella Pasta in the process. In February 1993, BrightReasons purchased 43 Pizza Piazza and Prima Pasta restaurants from Rank Organisation for ¬£20.25m, bringing their total number of restaurants to 165. In May 1994, BrightReasons started preparing for a stock market flotation, and the group was expected to be valued at between ¬£70m-¬£100m. This was subsequently announced in September, however, in November 1994, the planned flotation was postponed. In November 1996, BrightReasons was put up for sale after suffering a particularly tough trading period in 1995. In November 1996, BrightReasons was acquired by Whitbread for ¬£46m, but was sold off less than six years later for ¬£25m to Tragus Holdings (later renamed Casual Dining Group). In December 2002, the Bella Pasta chain was rebranded as Bella Italia and the first fully branded restaurant opened in Leeds. In September 2012, Bella Italia joined the Nectar loyalty card reward scheme as a redemption partner. In September 2013, Bella Italia began a partnership with the Gourmet Society, offering their members discounts on production of a Gourmet Society restaurant discount card. In light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, in May 2020 Bella Italia's owner Casual Dining Group announced that it was working with advisors on next steps for the overall business as a prudent measure to protect the company whilst planning for the future. In July 2020, Casual Dining Group was placed into administration with 35 Bella Italia outlets set to close. Branches in Plymouth, Newbury and Luton Airport permanently closed as administrators began selling off the group's assets. Cuisine The menu combines pizza and pasta, which is their main focus, with a range of grill and speciality dishes. The food is complemented by some Italian wines - many from smaller producers - beers and soft drinks. Tipping and minimum wage In 2009 the company was found to be threatening to dismiss waiting staff who do not get customers to pay tips on credit cards rather than in cash. Credit card tips were used by the company to subsidise wages (which are usually the legal minimum) whereas cash tips go directly to waiting staff. In line with changes to tipping legislation, which came into effect on 1 October 2009, Tragus Ltd reviewed and updated its policies to ensure that all tips, after a 10% deduction for administrative and other costs paid by credit or debit card, were distributed through the payroll system to restaurant staff. In 2015, Bella Italia amended its policy to ensure all employees are permitted to keep all tips and service charges paid in cash and are free to share their tips with colleagues if they so wish. Their employees are required to declare the income generated from cash tips to HM Revenue & Customs for tax purposes. When tips or service charges are paid for by credit card or debit card, the restaurant does take a 2.5% administration charge to cover bank fees before distributing the remainder in full to employees. All restaurant employees are paid tips in addition to the National Minimum Wage. Environmental record In November 2015 the chain received the worst rating of all restaurants surveyed in an assessment of the sustainability of its seafood. After working closely with the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), Bella Italia came second in Fish2Fork's analysis of the fish sourcing policies of high street restaurants in 2017. Philanthropy In June 2012, Bella Italia began officially supporting The Children's Society by donating some of the profit from a selected dish on the menu to the charity. In 2013, Bella Italia officially partnered with Comic Relief, the British charity founded in 1985 that aims to \\"bring about positive and lasting change in the lives of poor and disadvantaged people.\\" See also * List of Italian restaurants References External links Category:Restaurant groups in the United Kingdom Category:Italian restaurants Category:Companies that have entered administration in the United Kingdom ","title":"Bella Italia"},{"id":"13661070","text":"Map of Georgia highlighting the Athens‚ÄìClarke County metropolitan area.The Athens‚ÄìClarke County Metropolitan Statistical Area, as defined by the United States Census Bureau, is an area consisting of four counties - Clarke, Madison, Oconee, and Oglethorpe - in northeastern Georgia, anchored by the city of Athens.

The regiment served in the West Indies, South Africa and the Peninsular War, and after the end of the wars with France spent much of the nineteenth century in colonial garrisons. Among other service, the 83rd fought in the Ceylon Great Rebellion of 1817‚Äì18, the Canadian Rebellions of 1837, and the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Under the Childers Reforms, the regiment amalgamated with the 86th (Royal County Down) Regiment of Foot to form the Royal Irish Rifles in 1881. History William Fitch and His Sisters Sarah and Ann Fitch by John Singleton Copley The regiment was raised in Dublin by Major William Fitch as the 83rd Regiment of Foot, in response to the threat posed by the French Revolution, on 28 September 1793. The regiment was quartered in the newly completed Custom House while it formed, and at the end of the year was assigned to serve as part of the regular garrison in Dublin in the Royal Barracks. A second battalion was raised in October 1794, but was quickly separated to become the 134th (Loyal Limerick) Regiment of Foot.Memoirs, p. 13 At its formation, the regiment wore scarlet uniforms - the traditional red coats of line infantry - with yellow facings. The regiment did not have any formal title - the Dublin name would not be added for many years - but was nicknamed \\"Fitch's Grenadiers\\", due to the small size of many of its recruits.Farmer, p. 201 =West Indies and South Africa= The regiment sailed for England, and in mid-1795 was sent overseas to the West Indies, where half of the regiment fought in the Second Maroon War on Jamaica for eight months. Among the seventy dead from the campaign was Lieutenant-Colonel Fitch, who was succeeded in the colonelcy of the regiment by Major-General James Balfour. The other half of the regiment was sent to garrison Santo Domingo, where it took heavy losses through disease; the remnant of this detachment returned to rejoin the main body in Jamaica in 1798. The regiment remained on garrison duty until 1802, when it was ordered back to England. Most of the remaining men were drafted to other garrison units - mostly the 60th and 85th Foot - before departure. During these seven years, around 900 officers and men had died, almost all from disease, from an original strength of around 1100.Memoirs, pp. 14-15 No battle honours were awarded for the regiment's service in the West Indies, though the 83rd was one of a number of infantry regiments to apply unsuccessfully for a \\"West Indies\\" honour to be awarded for the overall campaign.Baker, p. 239 The regiment spent a few months in England, rebuilding its strength, and then garrisoned Jersey during 1803-1805; in 1804 a second battalion was raised in Sussex, drawing a large number of men from the 3rd Royal Lancashire Militia.Memoirs, pp. 16-17 In 1805, the 1st Battalion of the 83rd was assigned to a force sent to capture the Dutch colony at the Cape of Good Hope, and saw service at the Battle of Blaauwberg in 1806, for which it was awarded the battle honour Cape of Good Hope.Memoirs, p. 16; Baker, p. 262 It would remain as a garrison there for the next decade, until 1817, receiving occasional drafts from the 2nd Battalion.Memoirs, p. 16 =Peninsular War= The Battle of Talavera, July 1809, where the regiment suffered heavy casualties The 2nd Battalion remained on home service until 1809, with garrison postings in England, Jersey, and Ireland. In 1808 it was raised to an establishment of 1000 men, rather than the lower home service establishment of 600, and in early 1809 was ordered to sail for Corunna, in Spain, for service in the Peninsular War. It was recalled while at sea, following the British defeat at the Battle of Corunna, and then sailed successfully for Lisbon, arriving safely in Portugal on 6 April 1809. It was put under the command of Brigadier Alan Cameron, alongside the 1st Battalion of the 9th Foot.Memoirs, pp. 17-19 The battalion advanced north into Portugal with the main force of the army, whose first objective was the recapture of Oporto. In the Second Battle of Porto, the light company crossed the river by boat and captured the seminary, a strategically located building, while the main force entered the town from a different direction. The defenders were surprised while withdrawing, and took heavy casualties.Memoirs, p. 19 The force pursued the French army into Spain, with the 83rd's brigade engaging and routing the French rear-guard at Salamonde on the 16th before breaking off the pursuit. The force then was garrisoned along the Tagus River, where it suffered heavily from illness spreading among the men.Memoirs, pp. 19-20 On 27 and 28 July, the army was deployed at the Battle of Talavera, where the 83rd formed part of the central division; despite being exposed to heavy fire from French artillery, it held its position until the French infantry had approached to around thirty metres, and then made a bayonet charge to scatter the attackers. The battalion's casualties were very heavy, with seventy men killed including the commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon, and another 295 wounded, and the 83rd was withdrawn to Lisbon to rest and receive reinforcements. It was later awarded the battle honour Talavera for its part in the battle.Memoirs, pp. 20-23 The battalion spent October 1809 to September 1810 in Lisbon, when it rejoined the army as part of the left brigade in Picton's 3rd Division. It arrived in time for the Battle of Bussaco on 26/27 September, where it was only lightly engaged but still received the battle honour Busaco, and retreated along with the army to Torres Vedras, where it spent the winter.Memoirs, pp. 23-25 The army advanced out of the fortress in March, and the 83rd was involved in a number of the skirmishes fought with the retreating French army through the spring of 1811. In May, it fought at the Battle of Fuentes d'Onor, where its defence of the village was mentioned in Wellington's despatches, and the regiment was awarded Fuentes d'Onor as a battle honour. It was then deployed at the siege of Badajoz and the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo, where on 25 September it helped drive off a large French relief force. The siege of Ciudad Rodrigo ended when the fortress was stormed on 19 January 1812. The light company of the 83rd led the attack on the right flank, while the main body of the battalion provided covering fire for the central attack. The battalion lost four dead and fourteen wounded, and was awarded the battle honour Ciudad Rodrigo.Memoirs, pp. 25-26 The army then returned to besiege Badajoz, where the 3rd Division successfully stormed the fortress in early April. The 83rd played a major role in the attack on La Picurina, an outpost of the fortress, on 25 March, and in the main assault on 6 April. On the 6th, they led the division's attack, scaling the walls of the castle and securing the gates against a French counter-attack, but at the cost of a third of the force involved (40 killed, 87 wounded). The officers leading the attack were promoted, and the regiment was awarded the battle honour Badajoz.Memoirs, pp. 26-29 Through the summer of 1812, the British army advanced into Spain, fighting a major engagement at the Battle of Salamanca on 22 July; here, the 83rd's division counterattacked a large body of French troops spread out in marching order, capturing three thousand prisoners. The regiment was awarded the battle honour Salamanca.Memoirs, pp. 29-30 In the following year's campaign, the battalion saw service at the Battle of Vittoria, on 23 June 1813, where it led the 3rd Division's crossing of the River Zadara. The 83rd saw heavy fighting, with 35 dead and 78 wounded; after the battle, medals were awarded to two senior officers, the regiment was awarded the battle honour Vittoria, and the commander of the 83rd's brigade personally gave a one-guinea bounty to a large number of men as a mark of their bravery. Following the battle, the battalion briefly served at the siege of Pamplona before being assigned to secure the flank of the army, where it was lightly engaged on 27 & 28 July.Memoirs, pp. 31-33 Following the French defeats at San Sebastien and Pamplona, the British army advanced into France in late 1813. The first major fighting after crossing the border was the Battle of Nivelle on 10 November, where the 83rd received the battle honour Nivelle for its services and . It later saw service during the passage of the Gave d'Oloron and at the Battle of Orthez on 27 February 1814. At Orthez, the battalion lost 11 killed and 39 wounded. After the fighting, it received the formal thanks of Colonel Keane, commanding the brigade, and the battle honour Orthez; the commander of the light company, Captain Elliott, received a brevet promotion and a medal for his services. The advance continued through the following months, with the 83rd fighting at Vic-en-Bigorre, on 19 March, where it lost 7 killed and 18 wounded. The final battle of the campaign was the Battle of Toulouse on 10 April; the 83rd was only lightly involved in the fighting, but was nonetheless awarded the battle honour of Toulouse.Memoirs, pp. 33-36 After the close of hostilities, the 2nd Battalion was garrisoned in France until 1 June, when it left Bordeaux to return to England. It was then sent to Ireland in July 1814, with the depot rejoining them in November. The battalion transferred to Dublin in 1815, when all officers on active service were sent to join the 1st Battalion in South Africa, and then moved to detached duty in Armagh through 1816. It was finally disbanded in April 1817, with around 390 men posted to join the 1st Battalion, then under orders for garrison duty in Ceylon. 186 men were discharged, mostly wounded and unfit for further service.Memoirs, pp. 36-37 =Ceylon= In October 1817, the regiment, now reduced to a single battalion, was ordered from the Cape of Good Hope to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) for garrison duty. While they were in transit, the Third Kandyan War broke out, and on arrival the 83rd was sent directly into the hills for active service. Over the year and a half of active duty, the regiment lost only twelve men to combat, but 121 to disease and illness; a further 91 died from long-term effects over the following year. The regiment was also reduced progressively in size, to 750 men in 1818, and under 650 in 1822.Memoirs, pp. 39-40 In early 1824 the 83rd was ordered to return to England, but after the Anglo-Burmese War broke out in March this order was cancelled, and it remained in Ceylon, though with an increased establishment of 850 men. Finally, in December 1825, it sailed for England; over the nine years in Ceylon, over five hundred men had died of illness. It arrived in England in May 1826, over twenty years since the original 1st Battalion had left for South Africa. Shortly after its arrival, the commanding officer retired, and was succeeded by Henry Dundas MP, a line officer in the regiment.Memoirs, pp. 40-43 =Canada= This illustration shows an officer of the 16th Foot circa 1845; the 83rd would have had a visually very similar uniform, with yellow cuffs and facings. After a year in Glasgow, the regiment returned to Ireland, where it was dispersed among a number of stations for several years. In the winter of 1833-34, it concentrated in Dublin, and in February 1834 was ordered to Canada. Here, it garrisoned Halifax, with detachments on some outlying islands. In June 1837, following political unrest in Lower Canada, it moved to Quebec, and in December to Montreal. They arrived here two days before the Battle of Saint-Eustache, where they were one of three government regiments engaged in defeating the Patriote militia.Memoirs, pp. 43-46 Two companies were detached for service in Upper Canada, one of which saw action in February at the Battle of Windsor, a skirmish close to the American border against rebel militia. It fought again a week later at the Battle of Pelee Island, in early March. Both actions were successful. In May, the main body of the regiment moved to Kingston, Upper Canada. In November, a detachment of the regiment, patrolling aboard HMS Experiment on Lake Erie, intercepted a Patriot force near Prescott, and besieged them in a windmill while awaiting reinforcements. The resulting Battle of the Windmill was the 83rd's last major engagement in Canada, with one man killed in action, and effectively ended the \\"Patriot War\\". The regiment remained in Canada until 1843, when it was ordered home.Memoirs, pp. 46-49 The regiment arrived in England in July 1843, and was dispersed to stations throughout the Midlands and Yorkshire for two years, followed by stations around Ireland for a further three years, with a period spent at Richmond Barracks in Dublin. In December 1848 it was reinforced for foreign service, to a total strength of 1131 officers and men, and sailed for India in the spring of 1849. Since arriving in England, the regiment had been rearmed with percussion muskets, and had had a new colonel, Major-General Sir Frederick Stovin.Memoirs, pp. 49-51 =India= After arrival in India, the 83rd was split into two wings, stationed at Poona, Kurrachee, Hyderabad, and Bombay. The regiment reunited at Camp Deesa in Gujarat in January 1856.Memoirs, pp.52-56 In May 1857, the regiment was alerted for active service after reports of mutinies among Indian units in Bengal and northern India. The bulk of the regiment was marched to Nusseerabad in June and July, with companies at Ajmere, Neemuch, and Ahraedabad, as well as a small group of invalids, with women and children, at Mount Aboo. The headquarters remained at Deesa. During August, detachments of the 83rd disarmed Indian soldiers from the 12th Regiment Native Infantry at Nusseerabad, and fought briefly with a squadron from the mutinying 2nd Bombay Light Cavalry at Neemuch. The invalid force at Mount Aboo was also attacked by a group of men from the Jodphur Legion.Memoirs, pp. 56-57 In September, the detachments began pushing outwards to restore British control. The force at Ajmere was reinforced by a second company as well as local forces including a troop of the Bombay Horse Artillery, and advanced towards Awah. They were met by heavy resistance, and fell back after an unsuccessful attack on 18 September. The force at Neemuch later attacked the village of Nimbhera (captured on 20 September) and the fort at Jeerun (occupied and demolished 24 October), before being themselves besieged by Indian troops. The siege lasted fifteen days, 9‚Äì23 November, before the garrison was relieved by a force sent from Mhow.Memoirs, pp. 57-59 Through November and December the regiment concentrated at Nusseerabad, and after the headquarters had arrived from Deesa, it moved to attack the fortress at Awah. The siege began on 19 January 1858, and the fortress was abandoned on the night of the 23rd; the defences were destroyed. The regiment then joined the two brigades assembled to attack Kotah; the siege lasted 22‚Äì30 March, when the city was captured by three columns, one led by the 83rd. The regiment returned to Nusseerabad at the end of the month, where it was re-equipped with new Enfield rifles.Memoirs, pp. 59-63 In June and July a large portion of the regiment was sent to protect Jaipur and Tonk from rebel forces retreating from Gwalior, with battles fought at Sanganer on 8 August and Kotharia on the Banas River on 14 August.Memoirs, pp. 64-66 A similar detachment was sent east again in January and February 1859, fighting at Seekur and Koshana, during the close of the campaign.Memoirs, pp. 66-68 The regiment was awarded the battle honour Central India for its services in India,Baker, p. 274 and officers and men who had served in the field in Rajputana were awarded the Indian Mutiny Medal as well as six months batta (pay and allowance).Memoirs, p. 66 In late 1859, it was granted the \\"County of Dublin\\" title, formalising its traditional relationship with the city.Memoirs, pp. 69-70 =Garrison service= In 1860 the regiment moved to Belgaum, in southern India, and returned to England in early 1862. It remained here for four years, in various stations, and was briefly called out due to rioting around the 1865 general election.Memoirs, pp. 73-75 In 1866 it moved to Ireland, where it was re-equipped with Snider-Enfield rifles, and in 1867 was sent to Gibraltar. From here, in 1870, it returned to India, initially stationed at Pune and then at Deesa and Karachi.Memoirs, pp. 75-77 As part of the Cardwell Reforms of the 1870s, where single-battalion regiments were linked together to share a single depot and recruiting district in the United Kingdom, the 83rd was linked with the 86th (Royal County Down) Regiment of Foot,Memoirs, p. 77 and assigned to district no. 63 at Victoria Barracks, Belfast. The 83rd began to prepare to return to Britain in late 1880, drafting volunteers who wished to remain in India to other units. The order was countermanded in January 1881, however, three weeks before the scheduled sailing date, and the regiment was sent instead to South Africa for service in the First Boer War. It sailed on HMS Crocodile and arrived in the theatre in March, where it was employed on rear-area labouring duties.Memoirs, p. 79 =Amalgamation= In July 1881, as part of the Childers reforms, the regiment was amalgamated with the 86th Foot to form the Royal Irish Rifles. The 83rd, as the senior regiment, became the 1st Battalion of the new regiment. While the new regiment retained an Irish identity, the link with Dublin was broken, and the depot remained at the 86th's home in Belfast, where it was linked with militia units drawn from County Down, County Antrim, and County Louth.Memoirs, pp. 79-80 The Royal Irish Rifles would go on to serve in the Boer War and First World War, after which their name was changed to the Royal Ulster Rifles. Following Irish independence in 1922, the regiment was retained in the British Army, and served in the Second World War and Korean War. It was reduced to a single battalion after the war, and amalgamated with the other two Northern Irish regiments into the Royal Irish Rangers (27th (Inniskilling), 83rd and 87th) in 1968.History of the Royal Irish Rangers The Rangers were then merged with the home-service Ulster Defence Regiment in 1992 to form the Royal Irish Regiment, itself since reduced to a single battalion.The Royal Irish Regiment Battle honours Battle honours won by the regiment were: * Cape of Good Hope 1806 * Peninsular War: Talavera, Busaco, Fuentes d'Onor, Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz, Salamanca, Vittoria, Nivelle, Orthes, Toulouse, Peninsula * Central India Colonels of the Regiment Colonels of the Regiment were: =William Fitch's Regiment of Foot= *1793‚Äì1795: Col.

It was first published by Ballantine Books. Omert√† follows the story of Don Aprile's adopted \\"nephew\\" Astorre Viola. Publication Puzo never saw the publication of Omert√†, but the manuscript was finished before his death, as was the manuscript for The Family. In a review originally published in the San Francisco Chronicle, Jules Siegel, who had worked closely with Puzo at Magazine Management Company, speculated that Omert√† may have been completed by \\"some talentless hack.\\" Siegel also acknowledges the temptation to \\"rationalize avoiding what is probably the correct analysis ‚Äì that [Puzo] wrote it and it is terrible.\\" Plot summary The book begins with the death of Don Vincenzo Zeno in Sicily. On his deathbed, Don Zeno left the care of his infant son Astorre to his old follower, Don Raymonde Aprile. Don Aprile lives in New York, where he is known as a fair but merciless Mafia head. Aprile is a widower who does not want his children to follow him in illicit business. To save them, he sends them to private boarding schools and only sees them on holidays. Astorre is the favorite of his children, Aprile considering him his nephew, and Astorre is picked as the one who must protect the family after Aprile dies. Aprile decides to take Astorre, a young and bright child, to Sicily one summer. One day while the Don and Astorre are walking the streets of Sicily, a small cosca kidnaps them. The captors treat the Don and Astorre well, but they want a ransom. Aprile warns the kidnappers to let him go. \\"The rest of your lives will be miserable if you do not.\\" The cosca does not realize how powerful Aprile is. In the middle of the night, Bianco, a friend of the Don, rescues Aprile and Astorre. Aprile wants to kill the kidnappers, but Astorre asks him not to. Aprile gives in, but makes the men his loyal servants. When Astorre turns 16, he has a romantic affair with Nicole, the Don's youngest child and only daughter. Aprile orders the boy to move to London, to attend college and stop the affair. Nicole is upset by this, but Astorre obeys his uncle without argument. Astorre stays in London for a year with Mr. Pryor, a banker friend of the Don, and then returns to Sicily, staying for ten years and serving under Don Bianco, an old friend, fellow Don Zeno follower, and protector of Aprile. During his time in London, he meets a young woman named Rosie, with whom he begins a romantic relationship, which he continues during his time in Sicily, until he finds out that she has not been faithful to him. When Astorre comes back, having completed his training, Aprile decides it is time to retire from his dangerous business. He settles all his accounts and pays off all of his associates keeping only his ten international banks, which are completely legitimate. Aprile instructs Astorre that when he dies the banks should not be sold. Aprile writes in his will that Astorre owns 51% of all voting stock in the bank, with the Don's children owning the rest. The interests from the bank will go to Astorre and the children evenly. In the meanwhile, Aprile starts a macaroni importing business for Astorre. Valerius, Aprile's oldest son, invites his family to his son's communion. After the communion commences two men execute Aprile in a drive-by shooting. Without any public authorities securing the area, the killers are able to escape and, in spite of Aprile's power, there is no subsequent investigation into his death. Timmona Portella, controlling the only significant criminal organization remaining in New York, along with his international partners, tries to negotiate with the Don's children and Astorre to purchase the banks from them in order to launder drug money. However, Astorre, holding the majority share, consistently declines their offers, following the Don's instructions and claiming that he has found a love for the banking industry. At first, Aprile's children want to be as removed as possible and want to sell the banks thinking Astorre naive and innocent due to his good-natured and friendly demeanor, and while baffled that their father left him the majority share, want to protect him. As time passes, though, they come to see that their father had meant for his banks to secure their futures in their respective careers, and that they had done so thus far, with Valerius a high-ranking military officer, Marcantonio a prolific TV producer, and Nicole a successful lawyer in a prominent law firm. They also start to see that there is more to their \\"cousin\\" than they thought, and begin to suspect the reason why Aprile left him in charge. Drawing upon his years of training, Astorre methodically seeks each of the people responsible for the death of his uncle and had been trying to get control of his banks, consulting old friends of Aprile for advice. At times during these consultations, the friends suggest selling the banks to avoid all the trouble that Astorre is going through even to stay alive, but are impressed when he politely rejects the idea, seeing in him determination and strength that they themselves lacked. Astorre finds each of the people involved in Aprile's murder, from the hitmen to those who ordered the attack, and is able to eliminate them without detection by the authorities. Two years later, Nicole has taken over as general manager of the banks, and her brothers are working on a film for TV recounting the life of their father, with Astorre as a consultant to help them with some of the details. Astorre eventually decides to move to Sicily permanently, and there marries Rosie. They have their first child, whom they name Raymonde Zeno, after Astorre's two fathers, and they consider the day that they will bring their son back to America. Reception The novel received varying reviews. In Time magazine, R.Z. Sheppard said \\"This posthumously published novel by the author of The Godfather has more tasty twists than a plate of fusilli\\", and \\"this deft and passionate last novel by the Balzac of the Mafia\\", while Michiko Kakutani wrote in The New York Times \\"Fact is, the more I think about it, the more this book gives me agita.

Course and features The river is formed by the confluence of the North West River and North East River, and flows generally south by east before reaching the river mouth and emptying in the Southern Ocean. The river descends over its course. Etymology The river was named after the boom of the stuns'l, sailors slang for studding sail located on the outside of the square rigging of a sailing ship, after Robert Fisher and others found a stun'sail boom at its mouth on 7 November 1836. Loss of Montebello  The river's name came to some prominence when the French merchant ship Montebello went aground near the Stunsailboom Station in the early hours of Sunday, 18 November 1906.http://nla.gov.au/nla.news- article5115269 The Advertiser, Friday 23 November 1906 The ship collided with a reef not far from shore. A sailor, Louis Yrebot, swam at great peril with a small line to shore. Increasingly stronger lines followed and a flying fox was established between a large boulder on the shore and the mizzen mast of the stricken ship. All the remaining crew, including a badly injured sailor from an earlier accident, were transferred safely to shore via the flying fox. Five of the French sailors then made their way through remote and wild countryside and stumbled upon Tilka Hut. Here they were almost immediately found by local lad Percy May, a wallaby trapper, who happened to be passing while delivering a letter to one of the two Tilka sisters, Carlina and Christina, on Stunsailboom Station. The Tilka Sisters looked after the sailors while Percy May made a dramatic journey on horseback, that required swimming two rivers, to raise the alarm in the town of Kingscote. Several landmarks remain today as evidence of the wreck including the Stunsail Boom River Station shearing shed that is fabricated from original timbers which bear marks of marine origin, notably their rounded edges and bleached appearance; and also remains of the Montebello's steam boiler are wedged between granite rocks on the foreshore at Shelly Beach, the first of several small coves on the inhospitable southern coast to the west of the river mouth.

He was born in Port of Spain, Trinidad and is openly gay. Fung is a professor at OCAD University. He earned an undergraduate degree at the University of Toronto, and received a MEd in sociology and cultural studies at University of Toronto. Fung's work in video explores the role of Asian men in gay pornography, while addressing the intersections between colonialism, immigration, racism, homophobia, and AIDS. Many of his works have been presented at venues in Canada and the United States of America. Fung is an activist and founded the Toronto-based organization Gay Asians of Toronto in 1980.Gay Asians of Toronto. (1998). Gay Asians of Toronto Membership Brochure. Canadian Lesbian and Gay Archives,Toronto. In 2019, he was presented the Bonham Centre Award from The Mark S. Bonham Centre for Sexual Diversity Studies, University of Toronto, for his contributions to the advancement and education of issues around sexual identification. Early life and family Fung produced a short documentary titled My Mother's Place (1990), a tribute to his mother Rita. The documentary records Rita's Chinese-Trinidadian childhood, and the family's immigration to Canada, while focusing on the formation of Fung's complex identity in the process of coming out to his family. Professional career Fung has been published several times in magazines such as Asiandian and Fuse. Early on in his career Fung worked as an animator for community video production, and later became a staff producer at Rogers Cable. After directing his first film, Orientations, Fung joined the DEC Film and Video distribution in 1984 and assisted in Toronto's anti-racism film festival, Colour Positive. Initially studying at the Ontario College of Art and Design, Fung left school and worked as a video animator at Lawrence Heights, a public housing area in Toronto. Working with the Lawrence Heights community, Fung produced his own work and trained residents to produce their own videos . These works were aired on the Lawrence Heights community television channel. Fung produced his first independent video, Orientations: Lesbian and Gay Asians in 1984. He produced several videos that won awards and were screened in numerous venues and archived in various locations such as the London Institute of Contemporary Art, Chicago's Art Institute, and the Getty Gallery in Los Angeles. Fung teaches at the Ontario College of Art and Design. He was the Chancellor's Visiting Associate Professor at University of California Irvine, a visiting assistant professor at State University of New York Buffalo and a visiting scholar at the Mass Communications Research Centre, Jamia Millia Islamia in New Delhi. Before working at Ontario College of Art and Design, Fung was the coordinator of the Centre for Media and Culture in Education at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education at the University of Toronto. Fung served as a member on the editorial boards of Fuse and Amerasia. He is a member of the Caribbean Contemporary Arts in Trinidad, Toronto's Images Festival, the Racial Equality Committee of the Canada Council for the Arts, and the Toronto Arts Council. Fung is a programmer for the Inside Out Lesbian and Gay Film and Video Festival. A former Rockefeller Fellow at the Center for Media, Culture and History at New York University, Fung has lectured across North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. He has written and published on aspects of culture and identity. Influences =AIDS = Richard Fung, along with video activists Gregg Bordowitz, Jean Carlomusto, Alexandra Juhasz, and James Wentzy, shared a goal of looking back at the historical developments in AIDS activism and its normalization in North America. Richard Fung's video essay Sea in the Blood (2000) allowed him to show his audience the seriousness of AIDS, documenting his experience of having a close family member battling thalassemia and a partner fighting AIDS. Richard's relationship to thalassemia came about via his sister Nan, and his relationship to AIDS via his partner, Tim McGaskel. Sea in the Blood is a reflection on race, sexuality, and disease, revolving around two trips that significantly affected his life. During the first trip, in 1962, Fung traveled from Trinidad to England with his sister Nan to meet an eminent hematologist interested in her disease. His second trip took place in 1977 when Fung and his partner, Tim McGaskell, made a pilgrimage from Europe to Asia. Nan died before Richard and Tim could return home. Fung's personal accounts are riddled with love, loss, and AIDS. He aimed to avoid sentimentality and lure the audience to feel as he does, through his video essay. Richard uses blood to symbolize HIV/AIDS and thalassemia, as thalassalemia is an inherited blood disorder and HIV/AIDS is a viral blood infection that passes from individual to individual. =Asian homosexuality = During the breakout of AIDS in the United States, those surrounding Fung in Canada often said there was no real danger to gay men in their country. Little did Fung know, a plethora of Asian men around him were HIV+, and some even died. Focusing specifically on racism and AIDS in the Asian community, Fung realized that their side was being ignored in the narrative that has primarily been about white gay men. Fung attributes this obliviousness to the stereotype that Asian men in general are not sexual beings, and therefore cannot be homosexual. The degree at which social stigma takes place is bringing about the sort of shame and seclusion that has ravished the community during this time period. Steam Clean (1990) is a video commissioned by the Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC) of New York, and the AIDS Committee of Toronto. This work focuses on the discourse of sexual performance, and the intersectional nature of identity and political practice. Steam Clean shows two men having sex in a steam room. Fung aims to encourage the practice of safe sex in the lives of the gay Asian community. The sauna is instructional porn used to create a space that guides viewers into what may feel like a seminar room, for the discussion of safe sex by young community educators. Fung's use of the sauna as a setting is what some may call \\"homoscape,\\" which are streams of cultural material moving back and forth from national boundaries of perceived stabilities. His use of the sauna was aimed not only as a space of sex, but as a \\"narrative [for] conventions and expectations, [where] the conjugal drive is resolved.\\" Fung's focus is to direct the viewer towards the '\\"ethnoscape\\" and \\"homoscape\\" on the premise of how they overlap in a dynamic way \\"of rootedness, coalition, and intervention\\". =Homosexual Asian men and pornography= Through his pieces such as Orientations (1984) and Looking for My Penis (1991), Fung points out how the production of mainstream pornography caters to white viewers. Such constructions reveal power relations emphasizing white supremacy. Fung highlights how mainstream gay porn is more readily available to Asian men than independent productions, disproportionately affecting how gay Asian men view their sexuality. In his video Orientations, Asian men are constructed as sexual subjects as rather than sexual objects. In this Fung addresses Asians as taking charge of their sexuality and sexual interests. Looking For my Penis (1991) explores the importance of having different representations within mainstream commercial porn. Print pornography is often the first introduction to gay sexuality, especially for gay Asian men who are economically and socially disadvantaged, isolated and without support. Current commercial gay porn caters predominantly and almost exclusively to white viewers. Fung points out how this constructs gay identity as exclusively white. =Race, homosexuality, and family= Growing up in Trinidad, Fung attended a Catholic-based school which solidified his views about race and class and its effects in any given society. He moved for secondary school and Canada for university. In Canada Fung met his future partner, Tim McGaskell, at a Marxist study group. The family expectation that Fung would be an architect did not become reality. He attempted to study industrial design but instead entered the photoelectric arts department at the Ontario College of Art. In many of Fung's works relating to his family, such as Sea in the Blood (2000), he explores how lesbians and gay men experience being exiled by kinship. The coming-out process provokes fraught relationships between members of LGBT and their families and the AIDS pandemic contributes to an environment of exclusion and disappointment. Fung's works focus widely on queers of colour, drawing predominantly from personal experiences as an Asian homosexual. In My Mother's Place (1990), Fung addresses his relationship with his mother and is made up of disclosures of what to reveal and what to hint at, eliminating details while refraining from committing to lies; being both \\"inside and outside\\" the frame of kinship. The queer figure of inside/outside evokes \\"the structures of alienation, splitting, and identification which together produce a self and an other, subject and an object, an unconscious and a conscious, an interiority and an exteriority ... but the figure inside/outside, which encapsulates the structure of language, repression, and subjectivity, also designates the structure of exclusion, oppression, and repudiation\\". Queer theorist Jos√© Esteban Mu√±oz writes about In My Mother's Place in his book Disidentifications: Queers of Color and the Performance of Politics. According to Mu√±oz, Fung's performances can be understood as \\"autoethnography\\" due to their employment of tactics like \\"postcolonial mimicry\\" and \\"hybridity\\". In Fung's Sea in the Blood, he documents his painful negotiation between having to choose between his blood family and his chosen family (relationship with his partner Tim). Most of Fung's videos touch on his family use a style of predominantly personal narration and an impassive scientific account that illustrates how intimate family histories are shaped by race, ethnicity, and colonialism. His videos pull on subtle imagery, such as the use of waves and the sea (Fung on the beach with Nan as a child and later swimming with his lover Tim). The use of waves and the sea are fluids symbolizing not only the blood as a bearer of illness (Nan's rare blood disease thalassemia and Tim's battle with AIDs), but as a site of pleasure, barriers, and his family's immigration to Canada. In Fung's essay, \\"Programming the Public\\", he explores the politics of addressing the audience in his works. Highlighting how gender- or race-based programming must weigh the \\"phenomenal pleasure of collectively consuming identity-based programs addressing 'you' against the challenge of achieving 'mixed' and formally varied programs that construct new horizons of reception and attract new audiences.\\" Exploring the conflicts between genders, ethnicities, racial differences and divergent communities of tastes, Fung touches on how presentation of film and video and its reception reflect paradoxes of identity, access, and power. Audience reception is then rooted in ones' status and language, reflecting a hierarchical ladder of differences based on gender, race, and class.

It is one of the simplest members of a large class of N-nitrosamines. It is a volatile yellow oil. NDMA has attracted wide attention as being highly hepatotoxic and a known carcinogen in lab animals. Occurrence =Drinking water= Of more general concern, NDMA can be produced by water treatment by chlorination or chloramination. The question is the level at which it is produced. In the U.S. state of California, the allowable level is 10 nanograms/liter. The Canadian province of Ontario set the standard at 9 ng/L. The potential problem is greater for recycled water that can contain dimethylamine. Further, NDMA can form or be leached during treatment of water by anion exchange resins. NDMA's contamination of drinking water is of particular concern due to the minute concentrations at which it is harmful, the difficulty in detecting it at these concentrations, and to the difficulty in removing it from drinking water. It does not readily biodegrade, adsorb, or volatilize. As such, it cannot be removed by activated carbon and travels easily through soils. Relatively high levels of UV radiation in the 200 to 260 nm range breaks the N‚ÄìN bond and can thus be used to degrade NDMA. Additionally, reverse osmosis removes approximately 50% of NDMA. =Cured meat= NDMA is found at low levels in numerous items of human consumption, including cured meat, fish, beer, and tobacco smoke. The pathway for NDMA formation involves nitrous acid produced from sodium nitrite, which is used to cure meat. NDMA arises by the combination of nitrous acid and dimethylamine derived from the degradation of dietary protein in the lower gut. =Rocket fuel= Unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine, a rocket fuel, is a highly effective precursor to NDMA: :(CH3)2NNH2 \\\\+ 2 O ‚Üí (CH3)2NNO + H2O Groundwater near rocket launch sites often has high levels of NDMA. Regulation =United States= The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) determined that the maximal admissible concentration of NDMA in drinking water is 7 ng/L. The EPA has not yet set a regulatory maximal contaminant level (MCL) for drinking water. At high doses, it is a \\"potent hepatotoxin that can cause fibrosis of the liver\\" in rats. The induction of liver tumors in rats after chronic exposure to low doses is well documented. Its toxic effects on humans are inferred from animal experiments but not well-established experimentally. It is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002) and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities that produce, store, or use it in significant quantities. It was found as an impurity in valsartan and other angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) confirmed levels of NDMA and/or N-Nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) exceeding the interim acceptable intake limits, and the affected medicines are being recalled as of November 2019. The FDA is also requesting makers of antacids that include ranitidine, such as Zantac, to recall their products because unacceptable levels of NDMA form in ranitidine over time, especially when these antacids are stored where it is warmer than room temperature. The FDA has further requested that the makers of metformin extended release (ER) recall their products due to unacceptable levels of NDMA. = European Union = In July 2020, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued an opinion requiring companies to take measures to limit the presence of nitrosamines in human medicines as far as possible and to ensure levels of these impurities do not exceed set limits. Nitrosamines are classified as probable human carcinogens (substances that could cause cancer). The limits for nitrosamines in medicines have been set using internationally agreed standards (ICH M7(R1)) based on lifetime exposure. People should generally not be exposed to a lifetime risk of cancer exceeding 1 in 100,000 from nitrosamines in their medicines. EU regulators first became aware of nitrosamines in medicines in mid-2018, and took regulatory actions, including recalling medicines and stopping the use of active substances from certain manufacturers. A subsequent CHMP review of sartan blood pressure medicines in 2019, led to new requirements for the manufacture of sartans, while its review of ranitidine recommended in 2020, an EU-wide suspension of ranitidine medicines. Chemistry The C2N2O core of NDMA is planar, as established by X-ray crystallography. The central nitrogen is bound to two methyl groups and the NO group with bond angles of 120¬∞. The N-N and N-O distances are 1.32 and 1.26 √Ö, respectively. NDMA forms from a variety of dimethylamine-containing compounds, e.g. hydrolysis of dimethylformamide. Dimethylamine is susceptible to oxidation to unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine, which air-oxidizes to NDMA. In the laboratory, NDMA can be synthesised by the reaction of nitrous acid with dimethylamine: :HONO + (CH3)2NH ‚Üí (CH3)2NNO + H2O The mechanism of its carcinogenicity involves metabolic activation steps resulting in the formation of methyl diazonium, an alkylating agent. Metabolic activation of NDMA relevant to its cancer-causation. As a poison Several incidents in which NDMA was used to intentionally poison another person have garnered media attention. In 1978, a teacher in Ulm, Germany, was sentenced to life in prison for trying to murder his wife by poisoning jam with NDMA and feeding it to her. Both the wife and the teacher later died from liver failure.Ein teuflischer Plan: Tod aus dem Marmeladeglas (in German).Karsten Strey: \\"Die Welt der Gifte\\", Lehmanns, 2. Edition p. 193 (in German). Also in 1978, Steven Roy Harper spiked lemonade with NDMA at the Johnson family home in Omaha, Nebraska. The incident resulted in the deaths of 30-year-old Duane Johnson and 11-month-old Chad Shelton. For his crime, Harper was sentenced to death, but committed suicide in prison before his execution could be carried out. In the 2013 Fudan poisoning case, Huang Yang, a postgraduate medical student at Fudan University, was the victim of a poisoning in Shanghai, China. Huang was poisoned by his roommate Lin Senhao, who had placed NDMA into the water cooler in their dormitory. Lin claimed that he only did this as an April Fool's joke. He received a death sentence, and was executed in 2015. In 2018, NDMA was used in an attempted poisoning at Queen's University in Kingston, Canada.https://www.thewhig.com/news/local-news/man-admits-poisoning-fellow- researcher-in-kingston?  Drug contamination  In 2018, and then again in late 2019, various brands of valsartan were recalled because of contamination with N-nitrosodimethylamine. In 2019, ranitidine was recalled across the world due to contamination with NDMA. In December 2019, the FDA began testing samples of the diabetes drug metformin for the carcinogen N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA). The FDA's announcement followed a recall of three versions of metformin in Singapore, and the European Medicines Agency's request that manufacturers test for NDMA. In September 2019, the carcinogen N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) was discovered in ranitidine products from a number of manufacturers, resulting in recalls. In April 2020, it was withdrawn from the United States market and suspended in the European Union due to these concerns.

The Pyramid Play is a defensive play in American football, where a defensive player is hoisted up by two other players in an effort to block a place kick attempt by the opposing team. The play was created and implemented by the 1933 Oregon State Agricultural College team (now known as Oregon State University). Origin The play originated as a playful prank during an OSAC practice session. While the offense was practicing a place kick, the pranksters decided to give it a shot. Their prank was actually successful at blocking the kick. This success did not go without notice. OSAC's head coach, Lon Stiner, decided that maybe his boys had discovered something and decided to add the play to the team's repertoire. Implementation The Pyramid Play was first used unsuccessfully in a game on October 28, 1933, against Washington State College (now Washington State University) without much fanfare. The play was used again on November 11, 1933, against the University of Oregon during the annual Civil War game at Multnomah Stadium, now Providence Park. The Beavers had a 6'5\\" (1.97 m) center named Clyde Devine and two 6'2\\" (1.88 m) tackles named Harry Fields and Ade Schwammel. The two tackles hoisted Devine upon their shoulders. With the combination of their height and Devine's long arm span, they succeeded in blocking one of Oregon's two kicks. The play is \\"probably the most notorious on-field shenanigan\\" in the history of the Civil War game. Oregon State also successfully used the play again to help defeat the Fordham Rams 9-6 on November 18, 1933 at the Polo Grounds. Publicity Oregon Journal staff photographer Ralph Vincent managed to capture the use of the play in the 1933 Civil War with his Graflex camera. Instantly, Vincent, his photo, and the OAC Beavers were thrust into national attention. The photo quickly appeared in the Saturday Evening Post and other eastern newspapers. Discussion of the play heated up quickly with sportswriters arguing whether the play was good or not for the game of football. Some simply labeled the play a 'sports trick'. During World War II, it was reported that Nazi Germany distributed copies of the image around Europe as an example of the ‚Äúbrutality of American sports.‚Äù After effects The NCAA decided to ban the use of the play upon the conclusion of the 1933 season. That ruling is still in effect.

Riding horses can be any breed, but are generally warmbloods or Thoroughbred crosses. The breeding and showing of riding horses is overseen by the British Show Horse Association. Showing the riding horse The ideal riding horse should be somewhere between a hack and a hunter and should show quality, substance, good bone, correct conformation, presence and true action. =Division of classes= Riding horses are divided into two sections: * Small riding horse: Mare or gelding four years old or over, exceeding 148 cm (14.2 hands high), but not exceeding 158 cm (15.2 hands high). * Large riding horse: Mare or gelding four years old or over, exceeding 158 cm (15.2 hands high). =Show= Classes are judged on type, ride, manners and conformation. Horses in the class are asked to perform a walk, trot, canter and (conditions permitting) gallop together. The judge will then ride the horses and then may require individual performances, called \\"shows,\\" from the competitors. Individual shows should not exceed 1 minutes, and should include walk, trot, canter, gallop, rein back, stand still and demonstrate obedience to the leg. Riding horses can be shown ridden astride or sidesaddle. =Turnout= Riding horses are shown in brown tack, with a coloured browband. Double bridles or pelham bits are used. Saddles should be straight-cut to show off the animal's shoulder. (This style is called an \\"English showing saddle\\" in some places, to distinguish it from both the \\"Forward Seat\\" and the \\"Dressage\\" saddle). Manes should be plaited, tails pulled and legs and faces trimmed. Riders should wear tweed jackets and riding hats, cream or buff breeches, a cream shirt with a tie and tall black riding boots. Show canes are generally carried. For evening championships riders should wear a black or navy jacket with a white or cream stock, fastened with a pin, plus a top hat. Racehorse To Riding Horse The Racehorse to Riding Horse class was introduced to the Horse of the Year Show in 2006. The format of the class is as for a traditional riding horse class, although horses which are good examples of a show hunter or show hack may also enter. To be eligible, horses must be full thoroughbred and registered in the Weatherbys General Stud Book. The horse must have been in training as a racehorse, but need not necessarily have raced. They must also be over four years old, and stand taller than 15 hands high (hh). Turnout and rider wear should conform to the appropriate class - competitors showing their horses as riding horses should wear navy jackets and hats, while those showing their horses as hunters should wear tweed jackets. Competitors qualifying for the evening performance at the Horse Of The Year Show should wear black or navy jackets and a top hat. Comparable classes in other nations The Riding horse class is roughly comparable to the English pleasure-type class known as \\"Hunter Under Saddle\\" in the United States, though in the USA judges do not ride the horses nor are they asked to perform individually.

During his playing career, Terry appeared professionally (predominantly as a defender) for five different clubs and earned five international caps in the process for the Republic of Ireland. Playing career Mancini was born in London, and was originally named Terry Seely. His father (who was Irish) died when Terry was seven and his mother remarried, changing his surname to that of his stepfather. He began his career with Watford, joining the club in 1960 before being released midway through the 1965-66 season. After a 20-month spell in South Africa playing for Port Elizabeth City, he returned to London in November 1967 to join Leyton Orient. He spent four seasons with Orient, winning a Third Division medal in 1969-70. In October 1971 he signed for Queens Park Rangers, and helped them to promotion to the First Division in 1972-73. Although born and brought up in England, after a chance conversation with QPR teammate Don Givens, Mancini found out that through his Irish father, he could play for the Republic of Ireland. He won his first cap against Poland in 1973 and went on to win five in total. Mancini later reported that when he first appeared for the Republic of Ireland, he did not realize that the band was playing the Republic's national anthem, having never heard the tune before. Memorably for him, Mancini‚Äôs one international goal came at the Maracana in a friendly against Brazil ahead of the 1974 FIFA World Cup. He was sent off on his last appearance, a 3‚Äì0 win over the Soviet Union national football team in October 1974. He was signed by Arsenal in October 1974 for ¬£20,000. He made his debut against West Ham United, on 26 October 1974 played for Arsenal for two seasons, recording 62 appearances. However, after Arsenal's worst performance in over forty years in the league (17th) in 1975-76, Arsenal manager Bertie Mee resigned. Mancini was deemed surplus to requirements (being nearly 34) by Mee's replacement Terry Neill, and he was released on a free transfer in September 1976. He joined Aldershot and played a single season with them. He ended his career in the NASL, playing one summer with the Los Angeles Aztecs before returning to England As well as playing, during the early 1970s Mancini was an occasional presenter of London Weekend Television's The Big Match, when the programme, in an attempt to distance itself from the more staid Match of the Day, experimented with using current players as presenters. On the 6th. of November, 1974, he judged the 'Children's Photograph Competition', in London, with Kenneth Williams, and others. Williams' diary entry for that day includes: \\" When he (Mancini) left, he said to me ' I could stay here all night taking to you...I'd like to meet you again...this could go on forever as far as I'm concerned'. I was pleased and flattered and touched. More than I've been for years\\":('K.Williams' Diaries':Harper Collins:1993). After retiring from the game in 1977, Mancini coached several teams, before eventually leaving football altogether and running a variety of businesses.

At its completion in 1957, the bridge was the easternmost crossing of the Yangtze, and was often referred to as the \\"First Bridge of the Yangtze\\". The bridge extends 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) from Turtle Hill in Hanyang, on the northern bank of the Yangtze, to Snake Hill in Wuchang, on the southern bank of the Yangtze. Plans for the bridge's construction were first made in 1910. A total of four exploratory surveys were made between 1913 and 1948 to identify a suitable site, but economic limitations and the combination of World War II and the Chinese Civil War prevented the bridge's building until the 1950s. Actual construction began in September 1955 and was completed in October 1957. The upper level of the bridge is a two-way, four-lane automobile highway. The lower level is a double-track railway on the Beijing-Guangzhou railway line. History =Background= The Wuhan metropolis is an amalgamation of three cities situated at the confluence of the Han River and the Yangtze: Wuchang, located on the southern bank of the Yangtze, Hanyang, located on the northern bank of the Yangtze and the west bank of the Han, and Hankou, located on the northern bank of the Yangtze and the eastern bank of the Han. Wuhan lies at the heart of Central China and is a hub from transportation between the Central Plain in northern China and the trading ports of Guangzhou and Hong Kong in southern China. The Beijing-Wuhan railway line went into full service in 1906, followed in 1936 by the Wuhan-Guangzhou railway line. Between that time and the bridge's completion in 1957, railway cars travelling between northern and southern China had to be ferried over the Yangtze on barges, a laborious and dangerous practice. =Early planning= Early formulations of plans for a railway bridge over the Yangtze at Wuhan were put forward by Zhang Zhidong in the late 19th century. In May 1912, railroad engineer Jeme Tien Yow was made head of the Wuhan-Guangzhou railway association by the Beiyang Government. While working on the Wuchang railroad station, Jeme incorporated plans for connection of the Beijing and Guangzhou lines into the railroad's construction. In 1913, Peking University professor of engineering George Miller brought Xia Changchi (), Li Wenji (), and 13 other Chinese engineering students to Wuhan to do surveying for a possible bridge location. At the same time, Peking University President Yan Fu submitted the initial proposal for bridge construction to the Department of Transportation. The earliest designs for the bridge were modeled after the Forth Bridge, near Edinburgh, which had been completed in 1890. Although their work never proceeded past the planning phase, the area identified in the 1913 surveys proved to be an excellent site, and is the location where the bridge was eventually built.(Chinese) Ling Hong- hs√ºn ÂáåÈ¥ªÂãõ, Chung-kuo t'ieh-lu chih ‰∏≠ÂúãÈêµË∑ØÂøó (\\"China Railroad Monograph\\"), Taipei: Shih-chieh shu-chu (1963), 416-420. Sun Yat-sen's treatise The International Development of China, published in 1919, emphasized the economic importance of finding a suitable location for building a bridge over or a tunnel under the Yangtze along the Wuhan railway line. At the time, Sun wrote, \\"There ought to be a tunnel constructed under the first turn of the Yangtze at Wuhan to connect the two banks. Moreover, there ought to be a tunnel or bridge at the mouth of the Han River to link the three cities of Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang together into one metropolis.\\"(Chinese) Wu Zhiling Âê¥‰πãÂáå, Wang Xie Ê±™Âã∞, \\"Wuhan chengshi guihua sixiang de bainian yanbian Ê≠¶Ê±âÂüéÂ∏ÇËßÑÂàíÊÄùÊÉ≥ÁöÑÁôæÂπ¥ÊºîÂèò\\" (\\"100 Years of Evolution in Wuhan Metropolis Planning Thought\\"), Chengshi Guihua Xuekan ÂüéÂ∏ÇËßÑÂàíÂ≠¶Âàä 2009.4, 182. However, contemporary work on the railway bridge over the Yellow River at Zhengzhou sapped China of its limited bridge-building resources. =Construction= Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge under construction in 1956 In 1949, shortly after the Chinese Communist Party's victory in the Chinese Civil War and its founding of the People's Republic of China, former Peking University engineering student Li Wenji, by then 63 years old, and bridge engineer Mao Yisheng () submitted a proposal to the new government for the construction of the Wuhan bridge as \\"a memorial to the success of the new democratic revolution.\\" Li and the others were invited to the first Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in September 1949 to participate in discussions on the bridge's construction. The proposals were accepted, and a bridge committee was created in January 1950. Li was able to participate in the first year of the planning and building work before he became ill and died in August 1951. Between 1950 and 1953, three conferences were held to discuss the plans, designs, and construction of the bridge as they developed. In February 1953, Mao Zedong traveled to Wuhan to receive reports on the project's progress, and was taken to the Yellow Crane Tower to view the proposed bridge site. On 1 April 1953, Zhou Enlai approved the creation of the Wuhan Great Bridge Engineering Bureau, which was responsible for overseeing the design and building of the bridge, with Peng Min () as bureau chief and party secretary and Wang Juqian () as chief engineer. Chinese engineers in the 1950s were still heavily reliant on Russian expertise on major projects. Between July and September 1953, Chinese engineers brought a large number of the bridge's plans and blueprints to Moscow for consultation with Soviet engineers. In July 1954, the State Council of the People's Republic of China gave approval for a 28-person delegation of Soviet engineers, led by Konstantin Sergeyevich Silin (1913-1996), to travel to China and assist the Chinese with the bridge's design and construction. Construction officially began on 1 September 1955. Silin had predicted that using pressured-air caissons would be impractical due to the Yangtze's unpredictable water level, which made drilling holes for the bridge's supports much more difficult. The cantilever bridge design was used, and construction proceeded for over two years. Mao Zedong returned to Wuhan on 6 September 1957 to inspect the nearly- completed bridge, and was able to walk from the Hanyang side to the Wuchang side. The bridge formally opened to public traffic on 15 October 1957. On January 31, 2018, Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, visited Wuhan and took pictures on the Wuchang District side of the Yangtze River at the First Yangtze River Bridge.http://www.dzwww.com/xinwen/guoneixinwen/201802/t20180201_16992854.htm See also * Wuhan#Completion and opening-to-traffic of the First Yangtze River Bridge * Yangtze River bridges and tunnels References Category:Bridges in Wuhan Category:Bridges over the Yangtze River Category:1957 establishments in China Category:Major National Historical and Cultural Sites in Hubei Category:Bridges completed in 1957 Category:Double- decker bridges Category:Road-rail bridges in China ","title":"Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge"},{"id":"13661485","text":"The Second Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge (, Wuhan Changjiang Er Qiao) is a bridge across the Yangtze River in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.

History The bridge was completed in 1995 with four lanes of traffic capable of handling 50,000 vehicles per day. The bridge featured a median reserved for a branch line of the then planned Wuhan Metro Line 1. By the 2000s, due to growth in population of Wuhan, actual traffic demand using the bridge averaged 100,000 vehicles per day, peaking at 190,000 daily vehicles. The metro line reservation was removed in 2003 when the bridge was renovated and expanded to six lanes. With the opening of the Erqi Yangtze River Bridge downstream in 2011 typical traffic using the Second Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was 120,000 vehicles per day.

Martini Camionette from approximately 1907. 1929 Martini FUS Coup√©. Martini-Six variants. Various Martini models. Share of the Nouvelle SA des Automobiles Martini, issued 6. July 1915 Martini was a pioneer Swiss automobile manufacturer, in operation 1897 to 1934. History =The beginning= In 1897, Swiss businessman Adolf von Martini, son of Friedrich von Martini, the inventor of the action used in the Martini‚ÄìHenry rifle, built an experimental rear-engined car. He followed this with V4 cars of 10 hp (7.5 kW) and 16 hp (12 kW) in 1902. Since Swiss cantons were unusually hostile to cars, the company had to rely more than most on exports, and demand from abroad proved sufficient to justify building a factory in Saint-Blaise in 1904; von Martini relied on a licence from Rochet-Schneider of France, using an armored wood chassis and mechanically operated valves. Promptly, his British sales agent, Captain H. H. P. Deasy, set off in a 16 hp on a 2,000-mile (3,200 km) trek through the Alps, which followed his earlier stunt of driving a cog-wheeled Martini up a mountain railway; his praise in both cases was effusive. By 1906, Deasy was sole salesman. That summer, with a 20 hp and a four-cylinder 40 hp available, Deasy made an ill-advised challenge to Rolls-Royce (which had a six-cylinder engine); Deasy, and (more importantly) Martini lost the 4,000-mile (6,400 km) \\"Battle of the Cylinders\\". For 1907, there was also a chain driven 28 hp, and an entry in the Kaiserpreis rally, where the marque placed thirteenth and fifteenth. In 1908, showing the rapid pace of change, shaft drive was standard, in 12 hp, 16 hp and 20 hp models (all still four cylinder engines, however). That year's Coupe de Voiturettes saw 1086-cc (66 ci) inlet-over-exhaust SOHC-engined Martinis seventh, eighth, and tenth, enough for the team victory. The racer was marketed as a 1909 road car, the 10/12, and new monobloc construction was standard across the line. Yet the engineers could not make up their minds; in 1910, they reverted to side valves, and in 1913, switched to sleeve valves for the 25/35, while there was a prototype sixteen-valve four for the marque's last racing attempt. The years leading up to the World War were Martini's best, with annual production hovering around 600 cars, placing the company at the head of the Swiss automobile industry. While foreign manufacturers were already making inroads, the war years kept Martini in the black as they delivered large numbers of vehicles to the Swiss Army. =Inter-war era= The post-war recession, however, crippled Swiss exports including those of Martini. Martini was one of a very few manufacturers to restart production, with a mildly warmed over pre- war design as the TF 15/45 PS. A conventional four-cylinder of 3.6 liters displacement, it was wholly outdated in spite of a high standard of finish, with sales beginning at a low pace and then steadily sinking. Swiss manufacturers, with only a tiny domestic market, had been heavily export- dependent but external markets vanished in the harsh economic climate of the early 1920s. In June 1924 the nearly bankrupt Martini company was taken over by the Steiger brothers of Burgrieden, Germany. The Steigers relocated to Switzerland, having seen the writing on the wall for their German company which closed down in 1926, forcing the Steigers to sell their home to satisfy the creditors. The old TF soldiered on until 1925, but at the 1926 Geneva Motor Show Walther Steiger was able to show the new Martini-Steiger FU six- cylinder car.von Fersen, p. 90 This had a sidevalve engine of 3.1 litres and was a fully modern automobile albeit without any technical advances. It entered production in 1927, along with the larger (4.4 litres) FUS model. While sold as the \\"Martini Six\\" at home, the \\"Steiger\\" (meaning \\"Climber\\", suitably enough for a Swiss car) part of the name was emphasized in export markets where it was the \\"Steiger-Martini.\\" Steiger's Alpine Chamois buck was incorporated into the logo and was also used as a hood ornament. The Martini Six, while of a mainstream design, maintained Martini's high quality and workmanship standards and was an accordingly expensive car. Only a few hundred were built from 1927 until 1930, with the lion's share being sold at home in Switzerland.von Fersen, p. 92 The FU and the FUG engine shared a , with a or an bore for the smaller and larger engine, respectively. Power outputs were at 3000 and 3200 rpm. The larger version proved considerably more popular and a series of revisions beginning in 1929 were mainly applied to the 4.4-liter version. The updated versions were sold as the Martini FUS and FN (and the smaller-engined FUN) with various improvements. Already in 1929 the updated FUS gained a four-speed gearbox, all-wheel brakes, and twin Zenith carburettors. In 1931 the FUN and FN versions were discontinued, but next year's NF model was a modernized version of the earlier FN. During the Great Depression it quickly became clear to Martini that their existing six-cylinder cars were too expensive for the times. Accordingly, Martini signed a contract with Wanderer in 1930 to license build their recently updated six-cylinder car, a lighter, smaller, and cheaper proposition. This was badged Martini KM but it did not sell as well as hoped, likely the result of being a rather heavy car with low peak power and a weak chassis. The KM differed from the W11 only in minor details such as a marginally longer wheelbase and larger tread, altered gearing, and by using Scintilla lights and magneto rather than Bosch ones. The KM was likely intended only as a stopgap vehicle, as Walther Steiger had charged his old friend and engineer Paul Henze to develop an all-new front-wheel-drive car. This design however, barely even reached the drawing boards as a result of the financial state of Martini - and that of the world. The larger FUS was built alongside the KM until the smaller car was discontinued in 1932. This was also when the updated 4.4-liter NF was presented. Derived from the FU it offered many technological advances such as a worm drive rear axle, a fully synchronized gearbox, hydraulic shock absorbers and hydraulic four-wheel brakes, as well as modern styling thanks to a low-slung chassis. This, however, was not enough to save the company. The NF soldiered on until 1934 before just fading away, Martini with it. =Post- automobile history= The Martini company also manufactured bookbinding machinery. They were purchased by Hans M√ºller and the company was renamed M√ºller Martini. The original factory is still in use today, and has a 1917 Martini car on display in the lobby of their Bookbinding Academy.

The three main objectives of the programme are linked to the internationalisation of students, staff, curricula and research; ensure an influence on the development of practice in SEN and inclusive education; and to develop international collaborative networks, projects and research. Erasmus Mundus comprises three actions: * Joint programmes * Partnerships * Attractiveness projects Erasmus Mundus Joint Programmes Under Action 1, Erasmus Mundus supports Joint Programmes (Masters Courses and Joint Doctorates) that are operated by consortia of higher education institutions from the EU and (since 2009) elsewhere in the world. They provide an integrated course and joint or multiple diplomas following study or research at two or more higher education institutions. Erasmus Mundus funds a number of scholarships for students and academics studying or teaching on Erasmus Mundus Masters Courses. Since 2010, fellowships have also been available for doctoral candidates following one of the Joint doctorates. Scholarships cover participation costs, subsistence costs, and insurance for the duration of the study period. Many students also have the right to a contribution to travel costs. Erasmus Mundus partnerships Under Action 2, Erasmus Mundus Partnerships bring together higher education institutions from Europe and from a particular region in the world. Together, the partnerships manage mobility flows between the two regions for a range of academic levels‚Äîundergraduate, masters, doctorate, post-doctorate‚Äîand for academic staff. Scholarships cover participation costs, subsistence costs, insurance for the duration of the study period, plus a contribution to travel costs. A partnership usually has a legalistic dimension and is based on some formal agreement and close cooperation between two or more parties such as higher education institutions and may involve businesses, non-profit organisations or non-governmental organisations. Partners have specified rights and responsibilities. A collaboration, often described as an ‚Äòauthentic partnership‚Äô exists where people identify their common interests and work jointly with others especially in an intellectual endeavour. They often share their professional skills to support the community. An alliance usually referred to as a ‚Äòstrategic alliance‚Äô, is a close association of nations or other groups, formed to advance common interests or causes. These strategic partnerships seem to have blurred edges and though they are slightly different, they can all be used to describe some aspect of the Erasmus Mundus MA/Magistr in Special Education which was developed as a result of policy guidelines and funding from the European Commission. Erasmus Mundus Attractiveness Projects Under Action 3, Erasmus Mundus funds projects to enhance the attractiveness and visibility of European higher education worldwide. Activities focus on the international dimension of higher education, often targeting a particular region or academic discipline.

Injured after that race, he retired to stud at Claiborne Farm near Paris, Kentucky where he became a successful sire. His descendants include leading sire in North America Tapit and multiple American Classic winners such as Tonalist and California Chrome. Background Pulpit was bred in Kentucky by Claiborne Farm, who purchased his fifth dam, Knight's Daughter, in 1951. Knight's Daughter produced Hall of Fame inductee Round Table for Claiborne in 1954 and his full sister Monarchy in 1957. Monarchy founded a successful female family, most notably through the full sister's Preach and Yarn, both by Mr. Prospector out of Monarchy's granddaughter Narrate. Preach, herself a Grade I winner, produced twelve winners from fourteen foals. Her most successful offspring was Pulpit, whose sire was the 1992 American Horse of the Year A.P. Indy. Racing career Pulpit was unraced as a two-year-old. He made his first start in January 1997, and immediately made an impact by winning his first three starts, including the Grade 2 Fountain of Youth Stakes at Gulfstream Park in Florida. After finishing second in the Grade 1 Florida Derby, Pulpit dominated his next start, the $700,000 Blue Grass Stakes at Keeneland Race Course in Kentucky.

Running in the 1997 Kentucky Derby, Pulpit finished fourth behind Silver Charm, Captain Bodgit and Free House. He suffered an injury to his left hind leg during the race and was retired to stud duty shortly thereafter. Stud career Much like his sire, A.P. Indy, Pulpit proved to be a very successful stallion. As of September 4, 2013, he had produced 861 foals of racing age, with 672 of those starting races and 470 winning. His foals have earned more than $60 million. Pulpit also has the distinction of being the grandsire of the 2014 Kentucky Oaks winner Untapable, 2014 Kentucky Derby and 2014 Preakness winner California Chrome and 2014 Belmont winner Tonalist.

Copyright ¬© 1996, 2000, 2003 by Oxford University Press Early life Edmund O'Rourke was born in Dublin around 1814. He entered the theatrical world as a child, however he did not achieve fame until he was over 40. The first half of his working life was spent playing in repertory theatre in Ireland and the provinces of England. While working as a jobbing actor, he published his first volume of poems ‚Äì Man's Mission ‚Äì in 1852. Midlife success O'Rourke finally achieved success at the age of 41, when he performed two very diverse roles in Hamlet and the comedy Three Fingered Jack on the same night at the Adelphi Theatre in Liverpool in 1854. He received such rave reviews that he never had to tour the provinces again. Two years later he changed his stage name to Edmund Falconer and wrote his first successful play, The Cagot or Heart for Heart. It was the start of his second career, that of a London dramatist. Heart for Heart was performed with great success for the first time at the Lyceum Theatre, London, under Charles Dillon's management, on 6 December 1856. The Athenaeum newspaper commented that 'the dialogue is remarkable for noble sentiment, although the verse is not always correct' (13 Dec 1856). His next piece was A Husband for an Hour, produced at the Haymarket Theatre in June 1857.Victorian Sensation by Michael Diamond, published by Anthem Press Writing and theatre management The year 1858 saw Falconer translate Victor Hugo's Ruy Blas, which was performed at the Princess Theatre in late 1858. During that same year, he began a profitable collaboration with Michael William Balfe by writing the libretto for his much- loved opera The Rose of Castille. He was later to write librettos for several of Balfe's most successful productions, including Satanella, which was produced at Covent Garden on 20 December 1858, and the popular song Killarney, which remained a concert hall favourite well into the 20th century. Falconer, who was said to have had boundless energy, also turned his attention to theatre managing. It was on 26 August 1858 with F. B. Chatterton that he took over the Lyceum Theatre in London. Falconer was not above using his position to stage his own plays. The first was Extremes, a comedy of manners, which was performed on his opening night of 26 August. A reporter for The Times reviewed the show and said: \\"The characters are sharply defined and exactly of a kind to be perfectly intelligible to a large audience.\\" Several more of Falconer's own pieces soon followed, including Francesca in March 1859. Falconer gave up his management of the Lyceum after just a couple of years, although he resumed the role once more in 1861. Yet more of his own plays soon followed, including Woman, Love Against The World in August 1861 and Peep o' Day in November 1861. It is for Peep o' Day, a stage-version of John Banim‚Äôs novels John Doe and The Nowlans, that Falconer is probably best remembered. It contained a scene in which the heroine is saved from live burial and ran until December 1862. Meanwhile, he contributed two comedies to the Haymarket Theatre, too, Family Wills and Does He Love Me?, both starring Amy Sedgwick. Acting success It was not until 1860 that Falconer managed to dominate the London stage with his acting skills, rather than his writing. In the first production of Boucicault's The Colleen Bawn he played the part of Danny Mann, the villain of the piece. The melodrama, staged at the Adelphi Theatre in July 1860, proved hugely popular and ran for 231 nights. Indeed, the show has recently enjoyed revived critical attention. Falconer made ¬£13,000 in profit during his time as manager at the Lyceum, which he used in 1862 to buy a joint lease for the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London, with Frederick Balsir Chatterton. Between 1863 and 1865 he wrote and produced Bonnie Dundee, Nature's above Art, Night and Morning, and Love's Ordeal. He also wrote The O'Flahertys and Galway-go- bragh, a dramatization of Lever's Charles O'Malley, in which he took the part of Mickey Free. Falconer's attempts, however, to popularise Shakespeare at the theatre proved a dreadful failure. Gambling on the Bard to turn a profit, he directed productions of Macbeth, As You Like It, Henry IV and Romeo and Juliet. Despite hiring good actors, audiences were small and, by February 1866, he had lost his money. Falconer was arrested for failing to pay his mounting debts later that month and, on 26 April 1866, he was declared bankrupt and sent to prison. He remained in custody for several weeks, with his debts thought to total around 7,000 guineas.The Times, Friday, 4 May 1866; pg. 11; Issue 25489; col E Falconer attempted to revive his fortunes by penning a five-act drama, Oonagh, following his release, which was staged at Her Majesty's Theatre, London, in November 1866. It was such a failure, however, that it closed ten days later. By now desperately short of money, he decided to travel to America, where his play Peep o' Day had made him famous. Final years Falconer spent three successful years in America, where he acted on Broadway and continued with his writing, creating three new dramas. One of his greatest fans was Mark Twain, author of Tom Sawyer, as can be witnessed in letters written by Twain. Such was his US success, that publications of his plays went through several editions. He also married an American woman, who was his third wife. Falconer eventually returned to London in 1871, following the success of another of his plays, A Wife Well Won, which was staged at the Haymarket Theatre, London, in his absence. A successful production of Eileen Oge at the Princess Theatre, London, followed later in 1871, which featured his song Killarney. Falconer retired from the stage and writing soon after. He died at his home at 28 Keppel Street, Russell Square, London, on 29 September 1879 and was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery. In a report on his death, the Manchester Guardian newspaper revealed that although Falconer \\"had made what could be called a colossal fortune\\" out of Peep O' Day, the dramatist \\"died penniless.\\" Members of his gentlemen's club, the Savage Club, opened a subscription to pay for his funeral and help out his young widow.The Bury and Norwich Post, and Suffolk Herald (Bury Saint Edmunds, England), Tuesday, 7 October 1879; pg. 2; Issue 5076 Falconer's works * 1852: Man‚Äôs Mission: A Pilgrimage to Glory‚Äôs Goal (poem) * 1855-1860: The Power of Love (ballad) Words-Falconer/music by M.W.

Indeed, it was a favourite of Leopold Bloom, the hero of James Joyce's Ulysses (1922) In the novel, Bloom thinks quite a lot about the opera, and it features as one of the motifs of the Sirens episode (Chapter 11). Joyce even thinks up a dreadful pun on the title; one of the characters asks which opera has the same name as a train's tracks, and the answer is 'Rows of Cast Steel'. The pun crops up at various points throughout the novel. Bibliography * Irish Literature Companion. The Concise Oxford Companion to Irish Literature.
