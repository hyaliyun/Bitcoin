Developed originally for trout fishing, it is sometimes regarded as the supreme fishing sport, owing to its difficulty in both manual dexterity and understanding of the fish in its environment. The fish and the dry fly Fly angler on the Firehole River, USA Fly fishing for trout can be done using various methods and types of flies. Trout mostly feed near the bed of the stream, where wet flies and especially nymphs are used. They typically only come to the surface to feed when there is a large bug hatch during which thousands of aquatic insects grow wings and leave the water to mate and lay eggs. Particularly during the summer months and on smaller mountain streams, trout also often feed on terrestrial insects such as ants, beetles and grasshoppers when they fall onto the water surface. It is on these surface-feeding occasions that the dry fly can be an effective lure. At certain times, salmon will also rise to a fly on the surface and dry flies may also be used to fish for them.Dodd, G. L. Ashley; \\"Dry Fly Fishing for Salmon and Sea Trout\\", in Hunter (1926). The aim of dry-fly fishing is to mimic the downstream drifting of a real fly on the surface of the water. To be successful it requires both manual skill and a good knowledge of the fish and its surroundings. It is also a pleasurable occupation on a slow, dreamy Summer's day. Because of this it gained a reputation as the aristocrat of angling sports, superior to all other kinds of angling.Dunne, J. W.; The Fly on the Water, in Hunter (1926). Angling technique Fly fishing on the Gardner River in Yellowstone National Park, USA Dry fly fishing uses a line and flies that float. They are joined by a fine 3 to 5 meters long leader, typically of nylon monofilament line, which is tapered so that it is nearly invisible where the fly is knotted, and the angler can replace the last meter or so of nylon as required. Most of a trout's food is carried to it on the current, so they tend to face upstream with their attention focused into the current. Trout fishermen therefore prefer to begin downstream of the fish's suspected lie and work upstream into the current. Trout can see a wide area around them, so the angler must stay not only downstream of the fish, but also as low to the ground and as far from the bank as possible, moving upstream with stealth.Dunne (1924) Trout tend to strike their food at current \\"edges\\", where faster- and slower-moving waters mix. Obstructions to the stream flow, such as large rocks or nearby pools, provide a \\"low energy\\" environment where fish sit and wait for food without expending much energy. Casting upstream to the edge of the slower water, the angler can see the fly land and drift slowly back downstream. The fly should land softly, as if dropped onto the water, with the leader fully extended from the fly line. The challenge in stream fishing is to place the fly with deadly accuracy, within inches of a protective rock for instance, to mimic the behaviour of a real fly. When done properly, the fly appears to be just floating along in the current with a \\"perfect drift\\" as if not connected to the fly line. The angler must remain vigilant for the \\"take\\" in order to be ready to raise the rod tip and set the hook. Due to rivers having faster and slower currents often running side by side, the fly can overtake or be overtaken by the line, thus disturbing the fly's drift. Mending is a technique whereby one lifts and moves the part of the line that requires re-aligning with the fly's drift, thus extending the drag free drift. The mend can be upstream or downstream depending on the currents carrying the line or fly. To be effective, any mending of the fly line should not disturb the natural drift of the fly. Learning to mend is often much easier if the angler can see the fly. Unlike wet fly fishing, the \\"take\\" on a dry fly is visible, explosive and exciting.Halford (1889), p.45. Right from the beginning, anglers often prefer dry fly fishing because of the relative ease of detecting a strike and the instant gratification of seeing a trout strike their fly. Nymph fishing may be more productive, but dry fly anglers can become addicted to the surface strike. Once a fish has been caught and landed, the fly may be wet and no longer float well. Flies can sometimes be dried by \\"false\\" casting back and forth in the air. With care, a small piece of reusable absorbent towel, an amadou patch or a Chamois leather may be used. A used dry fly which refuses to float may be replaced with another similar or identical fly while the original dries out more thoroughly, rotating through a set of flies. After drying a fly may need a fresh application of water-repellent fly \\"dressing\\" liquid. Dry flies A dry fly is designed to land softly on the surface of the water without breaking it and becoming wetted. It need not be inherently buoyant. They are often oiled or treated with another water repellent. Dry flies are generally considered to be freshwater flies. A dry fly may be of the imitation or attractor type. Imitations typically represent the adult form of an aquatic or terrestrial insect, such as the elk hair caddis, a caddisfly imitation.Jardine, Charles, Flies, Ties, and Techniques, Ivy Press, East Sussex, p. 6, p. 56, p.60, 2008 The small blue winged olive is another common fly, for which several imitators have been designed. A beginner may wish to begin with a fly that is easier to see, such as the Royal Wulff attractor or a mayfly imitation such as a parachute adams. The \\"parachute\\" on the parachute adams helps the fly to land as softly as a natural on the water and has the added benefit of making the fly very visible from the surface. Being able to see the fly easily is helpful to the beginner. A translucent fly seen from underneath with sunlight shining through it looks very different to a fly when out of the sun. Some dry flies, especially imitators, are especially designed to mimic this effect. J. W. Dunne developed a technique of painting the shaft of the hook white and wrapping it in translucent artificial silk, which he then oiled.Ransome, Arthur; Readers' Guides: Fishing, National Book League/Cambridge, 1955. (2003 reissue, p.8.) Salmon flies, such as the Parks' Salmonfly, are usually larger than trout flies. History Dry fly fishing first became a serious sport in the 19th century, with the publication by Frederic M. Halford of two books: Floating Flies and How to Dress Them and Dry-Fly Fishing in Theory and Practice. His artificials were designed to imitate real flies but they only did so under limited conditions. This led J. W. Dunne to develop a theory of trout vision, and from it a series of imitators intended for use in sunny weather, which he published in 1924 as Sunshine and the Dry Fly. Meanwhile G. E. M. Skues had begun promoting wet nymph fishing. He went on to popularise the use of attractors, designed to goad the fish rather than to fool it. Skues' approach outraged the traditionalists who favoured the dry fly and in 1938 the Flyfishers' Club staged what amounted to an inquisition hearing against him. However Skues' approach proved more effective in the majority of situations.Jennings (2010). Dry fly fishing has remained a popular sport.

He was a key figure in the development and implementation of government policies affecting cities, particularly during the Whitlam Government. Early life Stretton was born in Cambrai Private Hospital, St Kilda East, son of Victorian judge Len Stretton. He was educated at Mentone Grammar School and Scotch College, Melbourne for his secondary school years. He subsequently enrolled at the University of Melbourne for his undergraduate education. However, the ongoing Second World War interrupted his studies and he served in the Royal Australian Navy. He enlisted as a rating on 5 May 1943 having declined a commission. Stretton was posted to numerous supply depots and ships throughout his service, including HMAS Penguin in Sydney and two corvettes based out of Darwin. As a result of his, he did not complete his studies at Melbourne. Upon his demobilisation on 8 February 1946, he successfully enrolled as a Rhodes Scholar to study history at the University of Oxford. His application was supported by Sir Robert Menzies who wrote highly of him. Career He graduated Oxford with a Bachelor of Arts in 1948 and became a fellow in history at Balliol College. During this time, he also spent a year tutoring and reading history at Princeton University. Stretton remained at the College until he took up a position as Professor of History at the University of Adelaide in 1954, becoming the youngest professor in Australia at the time. He stepped down from this position in 1968 and was appointed Visiting Research Fellow with the University's Department of Economics. Upon his retirement from the University in 1989, he was awarded both with the title of emeritus professor of history and an honorary doctorate. He taught modern history and economics but wrote chiefly about town planning, housing policies, and social scientists' ways of explaining complex historical processes. He served as the deputy chair of the South Australian Housing Trust for 17 years at the behest of then-South Australian Premier Don Dunstan. Influences and ideas Stretton published several books on a wide range of topics. His first, The Political Sciences, was published in 1969 during his tenure as a Visiting Research Fellow at the Australian National University. He put forward ideas on the importance of urban development for the economic development of Australia which were heavily influenced by his study and personal experience of the National Capital Development Commission. =Ideas for Australian Cities= One of Stretton's first and best-known works, Ideas for Australian Cities, was privately published in 1970. It was widely-read and stirred considerable interest in the ideas that he presented. Stretton argued that the Australian suburb, much denigrated among professional architects and planners, was preferable to the agglomeration of large metropolises. He stressed its social benefits and smaller scale for creating a sense of community. He sought to approach urban issues from a historical and sociological perspective rather than a purely modernist or technical focus. He postulated that diversity of people within a city was essential for a successful living environment. However, he did not consider that increasing density was the best way to achieve this goal due to the loss of vegetation and social cohesion that he considered important. Because of his background in sociology and history, he was an early modern advocate of concepts now considered part of post-modernist planning methods. This included social considerations such as planning for children and encounter. He was able to tie in these ideas with his main contentions on the advantages of suburbs to health and wellbeing. At the time of the book's publication Australia was undergoing significant social and political change, culminating in the election of the socially-progressive Gough Whitlam as Prime Minister of Australia in 1972. Stretton was employed as a consultant to both state and federal governments over the period of the Whitlam Government's term and eventually worked with the newly established Department of Urban and Regional Development. This allowed him to have a significant impact on urban policies of the Whitlam Government over the course of his term in office. Legacy Hugh Stretton died after a long illness 18 July 2015, aged 91. His passing was mourned in many Australian newspapers, academic journals and other publications, with the Sydney Morning Herald calling him \\"one of Australia's leading public intellectuals\\". His work had a profound effect on discourse in Australia across many different fields. His writing, activism and teaching are credited with raising important contemporary issues and leading important public debates across many decades. Stretton's willingness to assist both state and federal governments with policy development in a wide range of roles brought many of his ideas into the mainstream thinking and actions of bureaucracies throughout recent Australian history. The Stretton Centre was established by the University of Adelaide in 2014 and the Government of South Australia as an institute to integrate industry, workplace and urban development.

Life  Ritlers was born in the canton of Valais. He went to the local primary school in his place of birth, Naters. Because of bullying, he was forced to change to a school in Brig. In his free time he often assisted his father in his work, who was a foreman, wanting to follow his father's profession when older. During his apprenticeship as a mason, he learnt that he had an allergy to cement and had to quit the course. But he discovered his passion for photography and began photographing everything that crossed his way. He moved to Lucerne as it was one of the few locations where photography apprenticeships were offered. When Ritler accidentally photographed a film set producing an army propaganda film for the Swiss national exhibition \\"Expo 64\\", the paper Blick became interested in hiring Ritler as a journalist. The chief editor of the time, Werner Schollenberger, invited Ritler to write for the paper. Ritler was hesitant due to the reputation of Blick as a tabloid. He eventually accepted the job offer for one year only initially. Eventually he would work for Blick for forty years. The journalist managed to become something of an intermediary between the more conservative people of central Switzerland and the modern Zurich team of Blick. Ritler's character attracted a considerably amount of curiosity and trouble; on occasion he was chased by farmers with pitchforks, his tyres were slit, he received death threats and for a while was only able to work under police protection. One of Ritler's attributes is his curiosity for the \\"people behind the headlines\\", such as in the case of the chainsaw vigilante where Ritler was keen to find out more about the person behind the story. Ritler was only interested in real news. Because of that, he often held interviews after conferences, not during. When the Kapellbrücke was on fire, Ritler was there. At the age of 64, Ritler was retired early (one year before the regular Swiss retirement age) and had to leave Blick. He had a number of job offers and finally accepted the offer of Tele Tell, where he is now working as a video-journalist. For the first time, Ritler is working for TV. Within this young team, Ritler has a reputation for being a \\"total professional who knows central Switzerland like no one else\\" and who has an \\"eye for the perfect picture\\".

He returned to design the titles for Skyfall (2012) and Spectre (2015). Early life He attended Orange Hill Grammar School in north-west London, which became Mill Hill County High School. Career Kleinman formed Bazooka Joe, a rock band, with John Ellis and friends from Orange Hill Grammar School, Burnt Oak, London. The band played extensively throughout the 1970s. In 1975 it was supported by the Sex Pistols, playing for the first time at St Martin's School of Art, London. Bazooka Joe had a varied changing line up of musicians, notably Adam Ant and Arabella Weir, Mark Tanner (Sculptor), Chris Duffy (photographer). Prior to Bond films, Kleinman directed music videos for musicians such as Madonna, Fleetwood Mac, Paula Abdul, Simple Minds, Wang Chung, Adam Ant and many others. His 1989 James Bond-inspired video for Gladys Knight's title song to Licence to Kill led to him being chosen as the replacement when regular Bond title designer Maurice Binder died in 1991. In addition to the titles, Kleinman also directed the music video for Sheryl Crow's Tomorrow Never Dies title song. Kleinman has directed many television commercials for companies ranging from Smirnoff's Sea and Guinness' noitulovE, to pieces for Levi's, Johnnie Walker, Durex and Audi. He also directed the iconic Boddington’s commercials featuring Melanie Sykes. Kleinman also directed Harry Enfield and Paul Whitehouse in Smashie and Nicey, End of an Era. James Bond Kleinman's appointment as title designer for the James Bond films placed greater emphasis on the use of modern technologies (such as computer generated images) into the creation of the series' title sequences, as well as an arguably greater emphasis on the integration of elements of each film's respective plots within the musical sequences. To elaborate: * The titles for GoldenEye feature a two-faced woman, an allusion to the god Janus, the namesake of a character and his terrorist organisation in the film. The sequence also includes imagery of the usual scantily clad women tearing down Soviet monuments, physically destroying Communist iconography, which bridges the gap between the cold open pre-credits sequence/teaser set during the Cold War and the remainder of the film, set after the fall of the Soviet Union. A key sequence later in the film is set in a Russian dumping ground full of such damaged and redundant statues of Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin. * Tomorrow Never Dies title sequence turns the Bond women into anthropomorphic symbols of technology, specifically circuitry and communications to illustrate the plot's concerns with the power of the mass media. Satellites in orbit becoming diamonds is reminiscent of Binder's sequence for Diamonds Are Forever. * The titles for The World Is Not Enough feature, appropriately, images of the globe, massed ranks of pumping oil derricks and the usual silhouettes of women actually forming from oil, making use of the rainbow effect of oil on water, and reflecting the storyline's central theme of the exploitation of the natural resource. * Die Another Day's titles further integrate plot elements by advancing the story (something not literally seen since Dr. No 's titles) by illustrating Bond (Pierce Brosnan) being tortured during his lengthy imprisonment in North Korea, complete with beatings, dunkings and scorpion stings. For the first time, the traditional shapely women are represented negatively as 'elementals' – water, electricity and extremes of hot and cold all employed in the torture. * For the titles of Casino Royale, the women are entirely absent – for the first time since Dr. No – on request by director Martin Campbell. Kleinman's unique sequence replaces the characteristic silhouettes of naked 'lovelies' with angular ones of men (achieved via rotoscoping) – specifically Bond in silhouette and a series of colourful attackers whom he dispatches as he works his way to Double-0 status, again advancing the plot. It is all set against a stylised background of casino and card-game symbolism to reflect the central theme and the poker game scenes in the film, and is reminiscent of the original paperback cover for the novel. The only women to appear are the film's Bond girl, Vesper Lynd, glimpsed as the pack's Queen of Hearts among the cross-hairs/roulette wheels, and HM The Queen on British £10 bank notes. The sequence concludes with a focus on Bond's (Daniel Craig) ice-cold blue eyes. * After being absent for Quantum of Solace, Kleinman returned to design the titles for Skyfall. This features the return of the scantily-clad silhouetted women, although in a sparing role and nowhere near the number seen in title sequences prior to Casino Royale. There is, again, a repeating emphasis of Bond's blue eyes, and a sniper wound in Bond's chest (accidentally inflicted in the pre-credits sequence by Eve Moneypenny). The remainder features Bond moving through multiple surreal environments, including a graveyard, a hall of mirrors, a riverbed, and Skyfall itself (the Bond family estate). Chinese lanterns (representing the portion set in Shanghai), target circles from an indoor shooting range with Bond's face, and the film's principal villain, Silva, also make an appearance; the sequence also features Silva's calling card, a red skull. The final portion recalls the film's title, with the sky quite literally falling: pistols, swords and daggers rain down on an apocalyptic rendition of the graveyard, before the sequence again concludes, as in Casino Royale, with a close zoom on Bond's eyes. *Kleinman once again returned to direct the title sequence of the twenty-fourth Bond film, Spectre.http://jamesbondnorge.no/?p=2820 The sequence contains a heavy emphasis on the Octopus of the SPECTRE logo, with the tentacles appearing in nearly every scene in the sequence symbolising the control of the organisation in Bond's life. Imagery of previous Bond villains and friends appear including Raoul Silva, Le Chiffre, Vesper Lynd and M as played by Judi Dench all being reflected on shattered glass. Several scenes from the film appear in the sequence with tentacles appearing from the shadows, a further sequence showing the funeral scene with tentacles replacing the church also appears with Franz Oberhauser appearing as the source of the tentacles. More Kleinman talents are not limited to music and directing, he is an exceptional artist and illustrator. His wife Judy, is also very gifted: an actress, fashion designer, organic garden designer and gardener. She has brought back wild flower meadows at their home with the resulting increase of associated fauna. His Sister Judith Kleinman, is a professional double bass player and teaches the Alexander technique at the Royal Academy of Music (along side her husband and fellow bass player Peter Buckoake), the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and is a co-director of the London Centre for Alexander Technique. Author of many seminal books on the technique. She has also had several double bass works written specially for her. After Bazooka Joe, Daniel formed, Danny and the Nogoodniks in the late 70's with Chris Duffy (Photographer); Daniels's brother Matthew (Sax ex The Method); cousin Keith Cockburn (Sax, ex The Sting-Rays, The Wigs, now a senior Doctor and still playing Sax, Double Bass and Singing when not saving lives); Mark Tanner (Drums ex Bazooka Joe, Havanan Lets Go, Tropical Fish, also Heavy Metal Sculptor); John Mackie (Drums ex Stuka); John Singleton (Trombone ); Barry Taylor (Guitar), Tony Cross (Trumpet Alexandra Technique teacher and freelance classical player), Garry (Raggy) Lewis (Bass, ex Stuka, Band of Garys, etc.), Kika Mirylees (Singer, Actor and Farnham councillor), Gilly (Singer, actress), Lorraine Whitmarsh (Singer and Dancer, ex Hot Gossip, Sponooch). For several years, The Nogoodniks toured Camden Town, Kentish Town and London pubs, music venues and colleges. The Bull and Gate was always packed once or twice a month for several years. One week they were on the cover of Time Out, on the BBC2 Riverside art's show and had a record deal with Stiff records, two weeks later, the deal was canceled when Stiff was taken over, Daniel went to the US to make Pop Videos and commercials. Some of the Nogoodnicks, formed the Northern Soul band The Fabulisics (some years before the Commitments) who still play (just) when they can get together.

Robert Douglas was son of Robert, an illegitimate son of Sir George Douglas of Lochleven, brother of William, fifth Earl of Morton. He was educated at University of St Andrews, graduating with an M.A. in 1614. He was licensed as a church minister about 1617. Almost immediately afterwards he was engaged as chaplain to one of the brigades of Scottish auxiliaries co-operating with Gustavus Adolphus in the Thirty Years' War. During that period he is said to have had no other book to read but the Bible, and committed nearly the whole of it to memory. Returning to Scotland he became minister of Second Charge, Kirkcaldy, in 1628. He was a member of Assembly in 1638, and was translated, in 1639 to the Second Charge of St Giles, Edinburgh. In 1641 he was removed to the Tolbooth Parish. He was Moderator of Assembly in 1642 (and also in 1645, 1647, 1649, and 1651). In 1643 he was elected a commissioner to the Assembly of Divines at Westminster. In 1644 he was chaplain to one of the Scots Regiments in England. In 1649 he was again minister of St Giles, and assisted in the presentation of the Solemn League and Covenant to Parliament. In 1650 he was one of the ministers who waited on Charles II. at Dunfermline, to obtain his signature to a declaration of religion; when Charles refused to sign, and a serious division of the Church ensued. Douglas became a leader of the Resolutioners, the moderate party. On 1 January 1651 he preached at the coronation of Charles II. at Scone. Sent prisoner to London by Cromwell in 1653, he was soon released. In 1654 he was summoned to London (with others) to consult with the Protector upon the affairs of the Church of Scotland. In 1659 he preached the sermon at the opening of Heriot's Hospital. In 1661 he preached before Parliament. After the Restoration he was offered the Bishopric of Edinburgh, but indignantly declined, and remonstrated with Sharp for accepting the Archbishopric of St Andrews. On 27 June 1662 he was translated to Greyfriars, Edinburgh, but refusing to conform to Episcopacy, he was deprived on 1 October of the same year. He was admitted as an \\"indulged minister\\" to Pencaitland on 2 September 1669, and died (buried 6th) February 1674. \\"No man,\\" it was said, \\" contributed more to the Restoration, and received less benefit from it.\\" Life He was son of George Douglas, governor of Laurence, Lord Oliphant; the father was said to be an illegitimate son of Sir George Douglas of Lochleven, brother of Sir William Douglas, 6th Earl of Morton. Sir George helped Mary Queen of Scots to escape from Lochleven in 1567, and at the end of the seventeenth century the Scottish historians stated that Queen Mary was the mother of Sir George's illegitimate son. Gilbert Burnet states, in the manuscript copy of his 'History of his own Time' in the British Museum, that the rumour that Robert Douglas was Queen Mary's grandson was very common in his day, and that Douglas 'was not ill-pleased to have this story pass.' Wodrow (Analecta, iv. 226) repeats the tale on the authority of 'Old Mr. Patrick Simson,' and suggests that it was familiar to most Scotchmen. But the report may be a Whig fiction fabricated about Queen Mary to discredit the Jacobites of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. He was educated at the University of St Andrews, where he took the degree of M.A. in 1614. Gustavus Adolphus at the Battle of Breitenfeld (1631) He became minister of Kirkaldy in 1628, and a year later was offered a charge at South Leith, which he declined. He became chaplain to one of the brigades of Scottish auxiliaries sent with the connivance of Charles I to the aid of Gustavus Adolphus in the Thirty Years' War. Gustavus landed in Germany in June 1630; Robert Wodrow, in his 'Analecta,' gives several anecdotes, showing how he appreciated Douglas's advice. Returning to Scotland, he was elected in 1638 member of the General Assembly, and in the following year was chosen for the second charge of the High Church in Edinburgh. In 1641 he was removed to the Tolbooth Church, and in July of the same year preached a sermon before the Scottish parliament. In the following year he was chosen moderator of the general assembly—a post he also held in 1645, 1647, 1649, and 1651—and in 1643 he was named one of the commissioners of the Westminster Assembly. In 1644 he was chaplain to one of the Scottish regiments in England, an account of which he gives in his 'Diary.' In 1649 he was retransferred to the High Church, and with other commissioners presented the Solemn League and Covenant to the parliament, and was appointed a commissioner for visiting the universities of Edinburgh, Aberdeen, and St Andrews. In the following year he was one of the ministers who waited on Charles II at Dunfermline to obtain his signature to a declaration of religion; but as this document reflected on his father, Charles refused to sign it. The result was a division in the Scotch church on the matter, Douglas being a leader of the resolutioners, the party which preferred to treat the king leniently. The Church of Scotland was now unhappily split into two contending sections. Old friends who had fought side by side in earlier days became opponents, and there was much bitterness and occasionally misrepresentations, due in some cases to misunderstandings, exaggerated reports or false rumours. Of the Resolutioners, Robert Douglas was, by head and shoulders, the acknowledged leader. His ministerial supporters included David Dickson, Robert Baillie, and James Wood. Among the Protesters the most outstanding ministers were James Guthrie, Samuel Rutherfurd, Andrew Cant, Patrick Gillespie, and John Livingstone; and, of the elders, Wariston and Sir John Cheisly; the two most strenuous fighters being Guthrie and Wariston. In January 1651 Douglas officiated at the coronation of Charles II at Scone, preaching a sermon in which he said that it was the king's duty to maintain the established religion of Scotland, and to bring the other religions of the kingdom into conformity with it. Douglas was sent prisoner to London by Oliver Cromwell, when he suppressed the Scotch royalists, but was released in 1653. In 1654 he was called to London with other eminent ministers to consult with the Protector on the affairs of the Church of Scotland. Douglas was now the acknowledged leader of the moderate presbyterians or 'public resolutioners,' and retained the position till the English Restoration, which he largely helped to bring about. In 1659 he joined with the other resolutioners in sending James Sharp to London to attend to the interests of the Scottish church, and Wodrow (Sufferings of the Church of Scotland) gives most of the correspondence which took place between them. In this year Douglas preached the sermon at the opening of Heriot's Hospital. After the Restoration Douglas was offered the bishopric of Edinburgh if he would agree to the introduction of episcopacy into Scotland, but declined the office, and remonstrated with Sharp for accepting the archbishopric of St. Andrews. He preached before the Scottish parliament in 1661, and 27 June 1662 was removed to the pastorate of Greyfriars Kirk. For declining to recognise episcopacy Douglas was deprived of this charge on 1 October 1662. In 1669 the privy council licensed him as an indulged minister to the parish of Pencaitland in East Lothian. He died in 1674, aged 80.

Directed by Michel Brault, it is a partly fictionalized account of the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837 and 1838 which sought to make Lower Canada, now Quebec, a republic independent from the British Empire.  Description  It features the fictional character of François-Xavier Bouchard and the factual character of François-Marie-Thomas Chevalier de Lorimier. The music was composed by François Dompierre. Film director Pierre Falardeau says that Telefilm Canada initially used the approval of Brault's movie as an excuse to deny funds for the movie February 15, 1839. This incited him to write a second Elvis Gratton movie instead. The main protagonist is Patriote François-Xavier Bouchard. The latter comes back to Lower Canada in the autumn of 1838 after having escaped to the United States (as a number of Patriotes did indeed), after the first uprising, in that year. As soon as he returns, despite the exhortations of his family, he joins François-Marie-Thomas Chevalier de Lorimier for another attempt.

Raymond de Lacrosse joined the Navy in 1779 as a Garde marine. He rose to enseign in 1782, to lieutenant in 1786, and to capitaine de vaisseau in 1792. He was military governor of Saint Lucia in 1792 - 93. In 1795, he was sent to Martinique and Guadeloupe to crush revolts. On his return to France, Lacrosse was arrested. Freed, he was attached to the planned invasion of Ireland in late 1796, commanding the 74-gun Droits de l'Homme. The invasion failed, and on her journey back, the Droits de l'Homme fought the Action of 13 January 1797 against two English frigates, the Indefatigable under Sir Edward Pellew and the Amazon. Lacrosse was wounded and his ship was lost when she ran aground. Despite the loss of his ship, Lacrosse was made contre-amiral. In 1799, he was sent as ambassador to Spain, and notably negotiated the forcible return of émigrés to France, he was offered the Ministry of Marine, which he declined. In 1802, the First Consul Bonaparte made him General captain of Guadeloupe. On 1 November 1801, Lacrosse was captured by rebels, as he was leading a reconnaissance out of Pointe-à-Pitre. Pelage, the leader of the rebels, brought him aboard a Danish ship. Lacrosse set out for Dominica, where he joined the expedition led by General Antoine Richepanse, and returned with it to Guadeloupe. When Richepanse died, Lacrosse took command and managed to crush the rebellion and restore slavery. Lacrosse sailed back to France aboard the frigate Didon. Lacrosse did not know that the Peace of Amiens had ended and hostilities had resumed with the British. Off Brest, he ran into twelve British ships of the line blockading the port. He managed to evade the blockading fleet, capturing the corvette Laurier in the process. He reached Spain, left his prize in Santander, and returned to France. Napoléon made him préfet maritime and gave him command of the flotilla intended to ferry troops for an invasion of England. Lacrosse was made commander of the Légion d'Honneur at the founding of the Order. When Admiral Bruix died in 1805, Lacrosse succeeded him as commander-in-chief of the navy. Lacrosse retired in 1815 and died in his hometown of Meilhan on 10 September 1829.

Aunty Genoa was born on the island of Oʻahu in the Kakaʻako district of Honolulu and grew up in Lā'ie. She was an icon in Hawaiian music and a mainstay on the Hawaiian music scene for more than 60 years. She captivated local and visitor audiences alike. She had a large repertoire of traditional Hawaiian standards and Hapa Haole tunes. Many local artists include Aunty Genoa Keawe among their influences. In 2005, she received an honorary doctorate (Doctor of Humane Letters) from the University of Hawai‘i. Early life Genoa Leilani Adolpho's early years were full of moving about. She was born in 1918 in Kakaako in a stable. In her childhood her family moved about several occasions. Before she was ten years old she'd already lived on Kauai for several years and had moved back to Kakaako. By the time she was about 10 years old, her family had moved to Laie. This move to Laie would help facilitate the phenomenal music career that would highlight her life. Aunty Genoa always loved to sing ever since she was a little girl. In Laie she received her early musical training as a member of a local Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints Church choir. It was in choir that she built up her repertoire, knowledge and appreciation of music. She attended school until the 8th grade. She and her husband, the late Edward Puniwai Keawe-Aiko, whom she married in 1935, had twelve children. Keawe was a lifelong member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Career She began performing music professionally prior to World War II at officers' clubs and at bandstand shows in Kailua. Eventually Aunty Genoa landed a radio show on KULA singing with John Kameaaloha Almeida. Much like most other musicians, Aunty Genoa could not make a living solely on music. She also made money in her early years as a lei seller and as a taxi driver. Her long and illustrious musical career had taken her throughout the islands and around the world. She had played at luaus, lounges, bars, and on numerous radio and television shows. Aunty Genoa had taken great pride in preserving \\"na mea Hawaii\\". She learned to speak Hawaiian through her mother-in-law, who spoke Hawaiian as her first language. She arguably has perhaps the widest repertoire of traditional Hawaiian meles. Like many old-time Hawaiian singers and musicians she plays her music by ear. She had been recording music professionally since 1946. Her original record label was with the 49th State Hawaii record company. She then went on to record with Hula Records. After a falling out with the company she founded her own record label, Genoa Keawe Records, to record her music and the music of her family and friends. Along with the band, who had often been known as Aunty Genoa's Hawaiians, she helped to perpetuate Hawaiian music. Keawe is a recipient of a 2000 National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the United States' highest honor in the folk and traditional arts. Death After years of health complications, Genoa Keawe died in the morning of February 25, 2008, at the age of 89. References  Further reading  * Burl Burlingame and Robert K. Kasher.

It is the last stage of school education. To sit for the exam, students are required to finish 2 years of pre-school education, 10 years of basic education, and 2 years of secondary academic or vocational education(tawjihi year). Subjects in the exam include Arabic, English, Mathematics, Physics, Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Geology, Civil Studies and Islamic studies (unless Christian). Only those who pass the exam with a good mark may apply to proceed to university. For example, to be accepted to study medicine you must take the scientific stream in the last 2 years of the secondary education and get a mark not less than 85 degree out of 100 in Tawjeehi exam. http://www.admhec.gov.jo/Files/BSCUnivMajorsForPrint.pdf  Jordanian Tawjihi Equivalency  Foreign secondary education programs such as GCE/IGCSE/GCSE, SATs, and International Baccalaureate require to have Tawjihi-equivalency, so that the student could later work in Jordan or proceed to a higher education in Jordan. Upon graduation, the ministry of Higher Education transforms the Grades/Marks of these foreign educational programs, into the same marks used in grading Tawjihi students. However, even after the equivalency transformation, non-Tawjihi graduates are not allowed to compete with Tawjihi graduates for public university places. For non-Tawjihi graduates, there is a set quota of 5% of places. Most graduates of foreign programs end up paying international fees to get a place in their desired faculty. Regarding the system used to transform exam results of foreign education programs into the Tawjihi scale, which is a percentage out of 100, some see the system is fair and in fact over lenient with non-Tawjihi graduates, while others see it as unfair. Below is a summary of the requirements of the Ministry of education to receive an equivalency to the Jordanian Tawjihi. = GCE/IGCSE/GCSE equivalency = General conditions: *You should provide the Ministry with a proof that you have completed 12 years of schooling. *You must pass six O-levels and or IGCSE/GCSE subjects and two A-level subjects. Passing grades are as follows: **O-level/IGCSE/GCSE : A, B, C and D. **A-level/AS : A, B,C,D, and E *For Arab students one of the eight subjects should be Arabic language at either the O or A level. The following Arabic subjects are accepted for the equivalency: **Modern Arabic. **Classical Arabic. **First Language Arabic. **Arabic 9164. :The Ministry of Education will not accept the subject of Arabic as a Second Language for the equivalency purposes. It will consider acceptance if the student was enrolled in an English language medium school outside Jordan for the majority of his/her scholastic years. The Ministry will consider case by case to grant the equivalency. *In order to gain a Science Stream Tawjihi equivalency the following is needed **six subjects at the IGCSE or \\"O\\" level exams including: ***two science subjects ***One subject Arabic language **two subjects at the A-level including: ***Obligatory subject: ****one full A-level Math, OR ****2 AS's mathematics, OR ****A-level in physics ***Optional subject: ****a full A- level in any science,OR ****2 AS's in two Sciences *Literary stream: to gain Tawjihi equivalency the following is needed: **six passes in IGCSE or “O” level exams including: ***one subject in Mathematics ***one subject in Computer Studies/Information Technology **two subjects at the A-level including: ***Obligatory subject: ****one full A-level must be in Arabic ***Optional subject: ****A full A-level in any literary subject or ****two AS’s in any two literary subjects or ****one AS in a literary subject and one AS in a scientific subject. *At the advanced level Computing is considered a science subject. At the ordinary level Computer Studies and Information Technology are considered as science subjects. *Co- ordinated Science: for Tawjihi equivalency purposes the Ministry of Education has agreed to equate the Co-ordinated Science as two subjects. *AS levels: The Ministry of Education has agreed that two AS subjects are equivalent to one A level for Tawjihi Equivalency purposes. To receive an equivalency for a science subject the two AS subjects should be science subjects (i.e. AS Biology + AS Chemistry). If one AS is a science subject and the other is a literary subject (i.e. AS Math. + AS Arabic) then it equals one A level towards the literary stream. The student should check with the university they are applying to whether they require a full A level or not. *The Ministry of Education will consider the same subject in two levels as two separate subjects (O level Biology and A level Biology). *The candidate may re-sit the exam as many times as he/she needs before obtaining the equivalency.

Light browns are layers of surface dust greys and blues are layers of water and carbon dioxide ice. Regular geometric cracking is indicative of higher concentrations of water ice. The main feature of the Planum Boreum is a large fissure or canyon in the polar ice cap called Chasma Boreale. It is up to wide and features scarps up to high. By comparison, the Grand Canyon is approximately deep in some places and long but only up to wide. Chasma Boreale cuts through polar deposits and ice, such as those present at Greenland. Planum Boreum interfaces with Vastitas Borealis west of Chasma Boreale at an irregular scarp named Rupes Tenuis. This scarp reaches heights of up to 1 km. At other places, the interface is a collection of mesas and troughs. Planum Boreum is surrounded by large fields of sand dunes spanning from 75°N to 85°N. These dune fields are named Olympia Undae, Abalos Undae, Siton Undae, and Hyperboreae Undae. Olympia Undae, by far the largest, covers from 100°E to 240°E. Abalos Undae covers from 261°E to 280°E and Hyperboreale Undae spans from 311°E to 341°E. See also List of extraterrestrial dune fields. =Ice cap= False color HiRISE view of water ice layers in Olympia Rupes, believed by scientists to be preserving climate conditions of Mars dating back millions of years. Depicted width: Planum Boreum is home to a permanent ice cap consisting mainly of water ice (with a 1 m thick veneer of carbon dioxide ice during the winter). It has a volume of 1.2 million cubic kilometres and covers an area equivalent to about 1.5 times the size of Texas. It has a radius of 600 km. The maximum depth of the cap is 3 km. The spiral troughs in the ice cap are formed by katabatic winds that entrain surface ice eroded from the equator-facing sides of the troughs, likely aided by solar ablation (sublimation), which is then redeposited on the colder pole-facing slopes. The troughs are roughly perpendicular to the wind direction, which is shifted by the Coriolis effect, leading to the spiral pattern. The troughs gradually migrate towards the pole over time; the central troughs have moved about 65 km in the last 2 million years. Chasma Boreale is a canyon-like feature older than the troughs, and in contrast is aligned parallel to the wind direction. The surface composition of the northern ice cap in middle spring (after a winter's accumulation of seasonal dry ice) has been studied from orbit. The outer edges of the ice cap are contaminated with dust (0.15% by weight) and are mostly water ice. As one moves toward the pole, the surface water ice content decreases and is replaced by dry ice. The purity of the ice also increases. At the pole, the surface seasonal ice consists of essentially pure dry ice with little dust content and 30 parts per million of water ice.

The outer diameter of the cloud is roughly , and the inner hole or eye is across. The cloud is thought to be composed of water-ice, so it is white in color, unlike the more common dust storms. It looks like a cyclonic storm, similar to hurricane, but it does not rotate. The cloud appears during the northern summer and at high latitude. Speculation is that this is due to unique climate conditions near the northern pole. Cyclone-like storms were first detected during the Viking orbital mapping program, but the northern annular cloud is nearly three times larger. The cloud has also been detected by various probes and telescopes including the Hubble and Mars Global Surveyor. When Hubble Space Telescope viewed it in 1999, it was thought to be cyclonic storm.

The defeat of the rebellion meant that the state could never be properly established. History =Origins= A British colony since 1760, Canada was divided in two distinct entities in 1791: Lower Canada, mainly inhabited by the descendants of the colonists of New France, and Upper Canada, mainly inhabited by British colonists and American Loyalists who established themselves as refugees of the American Revolution. Each entity had its own elected assembly. The Francophones, who were the majority in Lower Canada, wished to take into their own hands important decisions regarding the administration of the colony. However, a massive frustration emerged because the assembly was soon restricted to an aesthetical role, a rubber-stamp; the real legislative and executive power was concentrated in the hands of the Governor-General, chosen by London, who often misunderstood or belittled the interests of the people of Lower Canada, which were at times contradictory to those of the British colonial authorities. The unstable political situation, lack of individual ministerial responsibility of the colonial government; as well as the economic crisis and the recent independence of the United States and of Latin American states led the people of Lower Canada, in the autumn of 1837, to the Lower Canada Rebellions. The poorly armed, untrained and outnumbered Patriotes were quickly defeated by the British Army. The survivors sought refuge in the United States. =Founding Fathers= On 2 January 1838, Robert Nelson as well as a good number of refugees such as Louis-Joseph Papineau, O'Callaghan, Chartier, Rodier, Malhiot, Côté, Bouthillier, Davignon and Gagnon assembled at Middlebury in Vermont to plan a military invasion of Lower Canada. The Patriotes present voted in favour of the quick establishment of a Provisional Government and launched an attack from the safety of the United States. Some voted against this venture, such as Papineau, who judged it doomed from the start without the help of a military power such as the United States or France. This led to some disagreement between the two rebel leaders. =Declaration of Independence and 1838 Invasions= The first invasion of Lower Canada was attempted on 28 February 1838. The six to seven hundred rebels, led by the two doctors Coté and Nelson, left Vermont with the goal of crossing the border. They soon arrived at a camp situated approximately 1.5 kilometers from the border and Robert Nelson was given the rank of General of the Army and elected President of the Republic of Lower Canada. Nelson then read the Declaration of Independence of Lower Canada, which was very progressive for the time. Lower Canada was unilaterally declared an independent Republic and its people declared absolved of all allegiance to the British crown. The state laid down enjoyed provisions such as the Separation of Church and State, equal rights for all citizens, abolition of the feudal seigneurial system, abolition of the death penalty, liberty of the press and most notably the equality of the French and English languages including official bilingualism. Unfortunately for the rebels, they were quickly beaten back by the British army, and the American government, feeling the British pressure, decided to stay neutral, not permitting such an invasion to be mounted from their territory. Nelson and Coté were arrested at the border and charged for violations of neutrality, then released. They took this as a lesson in organization and secrecy, noting they could never hope to match the British army in open warfare with their small numbers and resources. This led to the creation of a guerrilla organization named the Frères chasseurs under the guise of a hunting club, with the goal of overthrowing the governments of Upper and Lower Canada and to establish sovereign, democratic republican institutions in their place. Its organization was hierarchical and was led by a \\"Great Eagle\\" (equivalent to a Major-General. He led \\"Eagles\\" who each represented a district of the province and led a company. The \\"Eagles\\" chose two men as \\"Beavers\\" (equivalent to a Captain) who in turn each had under their orders 5 \\"Snowshoes\\" (Corporals). Each of the \\"Snowshoes\\" led 9 men with the title of \\"Hunters\\". It was financed by supporters in Lower Canada and the United States. Wild rumours began to roam regarding the numerical strength of the rebels. John Colborne spoke of tens of thousands, others believed that each parish of Lower Canada had their recruiting office. An insurrection was planned for 3 November 1838. On that day the rebels assembled along the border, at Lacolle, Napierville and Chateaugay. Some impatient groups did not wait for Nelson's orders and began attacking piecemeal. At Beauharnois a group occupied a seiugneurie and another seized a steamship to convert it into a warship. The initial plan was to seize Beauharnois, Chateaugay, la Prairie, St-Jean, Chambly, Boucherville and Sorel. Nelson, commanding 800 men, was to go up the Richelieu valley to capture St-Jean and advance to Montreal. Montreal, Trois-Rivières and Quebec City would be successively attacked, drawing upon increasing amounts of manpower and weapons as the population would join them. Nothing went according to plan. In Montreal, authorities quickly responded and arrested many local leaders. Other Patriotes, seeing that the promised weapons failed to arrive, marched to the Native reservation of Kahnawake to seize the Natives' arsenal. They failed and many were made prisoner to be delivered to the British. An American ship which was to deliver weapons was intercepted by a group of Loyalist volunteers. Other weapons which had been hidden at Rouse's Point in the United States were seized by American authorities. Apprehending that the operation was failing, he led his men onwards to Odelltown. In Lacolle, a rumour said that Nelson had tried to run away during the night only to be caught by his men, the doctor convincing them that he was merely inspecting the troops. On 10 November, they attacked Odelltown. The colonial militia was quickly reinforced and the rebels had to pull back. Defeated, they retreated to the United States. Nelson himself had fled before the battle was over. =Epilogue= Later that year, Nelson met many leaders of the Patriot movement in Swanton, Vermont, and began to plan border skirmishes to draw the United States into a conflict with the British Empire. However, the 1842 Webster-Ashburton Treaty destroyed the last hopes of getting American assistance to liberate the French Canadians from British colonialism. Ruined, destitute, and his reputation broken, he refused to return to Lower Canada despite an amnesty and stayed in the United States, forsaking politics until his death in 1873 in Staten Island. Legacy Lower Canada experienced during and after the rebellions great hardships and oppression and exploitation that would last until the Quiet Revolution, including a systematic program of assimilation; the mandatory use of English in all public matters and business; as well as an economic recession. The Rebellions lead to many more conflicts most notably the 1845 Rebellion Losses Bill which caused enraged Orangist and Tory Anglophones to Burn the Building of Parliament in Montreal, which lead to the construction of Ottawa. A large number of people were drawn to the promise of a better life in the United States to form the large majority of the French American community, concentrated mostly in the industrial north. The 1837 and 1838 Rebellions received increased interest following the rise of the Quebec independence movement and many of their symbols are used today to represent Québécois nationalism. The 1838 attempt at separation is often overshadowed by the much more violent, general insurrection that occurred a year earlier.

The difference between street crime and white-collar crime is that street crime is often violence that occurs in a public area whereas white-collar crime is non- violent crime conducted by governments or private industries for the purpose of financial gain. According to London's Metropolitan Police Force, \\"Robbery, often called 'mugging', and thefts from victims in the street where their property is snatched and the victim is not assaulted is also considered 'street crime'.\\" Other examples of street crime include pickpocketing, the open illegal drugs trade, prostitution in the form of soliciting outside the law, the creation of graffiti and vandalism of public property, and assaults. As a generic term, street crime may include all of these, as well as offenses against private properties such as the stealing of hub caps. The majority of street crimes, as portrayed by various news media, are initiated by criminals seeking quick financial gains. However, they can also be carried out by organized individuals with a common goal of profiteering. On the other hand, not all of these instances are considered by the FBI to be \\"organized crimes\\" due to the random nature of the crimes themselves. The term \\"organized crime\\" does not often include organized street crimes. An organized crime is often a major business, consisting of many individuals associated for the common goal of criminal profiteering. In contrast, street crimes are normally conducted by hastily and loosely formed groups of individuals with the common goal of gaining illicit money through immediate criminal acts.  Economic and social impact  In 2016, the government allocated $31.8 billion on the Justice Department, where that money was utilized to incarnate criminals, police them and enforce the law and defend the interests of the United States. This not only takes a toll on the government's budget but as well as the taxpayers and multiple other organizations where money is being deducted in order to imprison criminals. In order to compensate for the increased budget for the Department of Justice often taxes are increased, and oftentimes individuals spend money to prevent encountering crime. Other factors impact those who are victims of these crimes, where they are spending money on medical care, property damages and oftentimes loss of a steady income for their families. Areas of urban decay, characterized by abandoned buildings and cars, unkempt vacant lots, and broken windows tend to attract the homeless and increasing criminal activity. Instead of helping to improve these areas, which can be done by communities, often time the areas start out with minor offenses but often become major events. \\"A second factor is that increasing public concern about the safety of the streets has generated vigorous demands for more police protection and a growing public recognition of the limited capacity of many police agencies to mount an effective program of crime control and prevention. Crime seems to be getting out of hand, engulfing new neighborhoods and erupting in riotous assault, looting, and arson in the central slum areas of the big cities. A statistical report that did not show more crime under such conditions would seem puzzling indeed to the ordinary citizen. A cyclical pattern has been set in motion where the increasing public readiness to accept an accurate portrayal of the full dimensions of the crime problem meets an increased willingness to supply it. As the iceberg of crime rises to the surface of public visibility the need to bring new and more sophisticated resources to bear on the law enforcement task will become increasingly evident.\\" The sociological impact of crime cause societies to feel unsafe and demand the government protect its people from criminals thus fueling the mass incarceration policy within the United States. There has been a steady increase in individuals who have been incarcerated, ideally this benefits societies but crime has exponentially increased over the last decade due to fear. Because individuals fear to live in communities where small crimes are prevalent often these areas are overlooked and crime rates increase.  Social influences on street crime  The motivation for street crimes has been explored by multiple studies, including a study cited by Iowa State University, where 55 street crime culprits were interviewed in order to determine the social links tied to street culture. After interviewing those who participated in approximately 101 occurrences of street crimes, among the principal reasons for these crimes, including assault and robbery, were determined to be for societal status and recognition and thrill and excitement. The cultural viewpoint behind street crimes is built on the foundation that the intention of committing these acts comes from shared societal norms that support and reinforce violence. Street crimes are often amplified by the expansion and creation of gangs that propagate and reinforce these types of street culture behaviors. Other factors that lead to street crimes are poverty, unemployment, and parental neglect. Crime rates in areas that are characterized by higher rates of unemployment and poverty are estimated to be greater than other well-developed areas. There is a greater probability of unemployed adolescents not only being offenders but also victims of violence and street crimes. In addition, people with low self- control have a higher chance of committing street crimes. When individuals have low self-control, they tend to make decisions without thought, which, leads to street crimes. Another underlying cause of street crime stems from parents who deal with more financial or social pressures as they are at a higher risk of practicing poor parental techniques such as insufficient disciplinary actions, neglect, and ineffective supervision. Such parental actions are likely to increase the likelihood of teenage participation in street crimes.

Ferrie was born in Irvine, Ayrshire, Scotland in 1777 and set up a cotton printing shop there in 1792. He moved to Glasgow in 1799. After expanding rapidly until around 1815, his business experienced some financial setbacks. While rebuilding his business, he set up an import-export business with William Cormack in Montreal; he also built a ship to handle the company's trade. He moved to Montreal with his family in 1829 so that he could keep better control of the business. Ferrie opened a branch in Hamilton in Upper Canada; his sons, Colin Campbell and Adam Jr., managed the operation there. Additional branches were opened in Preston, Brantford, Nelson and Dundas. Ferrie was a member of the Montreal Committee of Trade and helped form its successor, the Montreal Board of Trade, in 1842. He was appointed to the municipal council for Montreal in 1840 and, in 1841, to the Legislative Council of the Province of Canada. Besides his involvement with politics, he also invested his time in the less fortunate members of the community, helping to aid victims of cholera, mainly new immigrants, and forming a cooperative bakery so that bread could be purchased at reasonable prices. Ferrie helped form the City Bank of Montreal and held shares in the Gore Bank at Hamilton. He left Montreal for Hamilton in 1853 and died there in 1863.

Directed by Pierre Falardeau, it is about the incarceration at the Pied-du-Courant Prison and the execution by hanging there of Patriote participants of the Lower Canada Rebellion. Those rebels sought to make Lower Canada, now Quebec, a republic independent from the British Empire. It features as characters the historical figures François-Marie-Thomas Chevalier de Lorimier, his wife Henriette and Charles Hindelang. Synopsis In the aftermath of the failed 1837–38 rebellion in Lower Canada, 800 rebels are held in the Prison de Montréal. The film opens on February 14, 1839, the day when leader Marie Thomas Chevalier De Lormier (Luc Picard) and his comrade-in-arms (Frédéric Gilles) are told they will be hanged in 24 hours. Director Pierre Falardeau makes no doubt about where his sympathies lie; however, 15 février 1839 is as much about human beings confronting death as it is polemic, and there are tender scenes when De Lormier's wife (Sylvie Drapeau) visits him one last time. Pierre Falardeau said that Telefilm Canada approved Michel Brault's 1999 movie Quand je serai parti... vous vivrez encore as an excuse to initially deny funds for 15 février 1839. Release and awards It released in the United States by Lionsgate on January 26, 2001. It won four Prix Jutra for Actor (Luc Picard), Supporting Actress (Sylvie Drapeau), Art Direction and Sound.

The South Yorkshire Junction Railway was a railway which ran from Wrangbrook Junction on the main line of the Hull and Barnsley Railway to near Denaby Main Colliery Village, South Yorkshire. It was nominally an independent company sponsored by the Denaby and Cadeby Colliery Company but was worked by the Hull and Barnsley Railway. History The S.Y.J.R. received its Act of Parliament on 14 August 1890, and opened for goods traffic on 1 September 1894 and for passengers on 1 December the same year. The passenger service lasted less than 9 years, the last trains running on 1 February 1903. Intermediate passenger stations were at Sprotborough and Pickburn and Brodsworth. The Hull and Barnsley Railway was absorbed into the North Eastern Railway in 1922 and then to the London and North Eastern Railway at the Grouping. Infrastructure The line was over 11 miles in length, with many embankments and cuttings, it also had steep uphill grades in the northerly direction at parts, including a 1 in 100 rise after Denaby, and another steep rise near Wrangbrook, 3miles long being between built at a grade of 1 in 100 or 1 in 112. It crossed the Great Northern and Great Central Joint line 2.5 miles after Wrangbrook junction, a short tunnel \\"Cadeby Tunnel\\" was required around 1.5 miles from the Denaby end, being about 250-yards long. A branch to Brodsworth colliery was added in 1908 from Pickburn. Closure Goods traffic lasted longer than passenger traffic. Most of the line, including the branch which served Brodsworth Colliery, was closed on 7 August 1967. A short stub remained after this date, extending northwards from Lowfield Junction, the line's southern connection with the Great Central Railway's Doncaster- Sheffield line just west of Conisbrough station. This section ran to sidings serving a limestone quarry operated by the Steetley Dolomite company. It saw its last main line traffic in July 1975, although it continued to be used as a link by the National Coal Board to transfer traffic between Cadeby Colliery and Denaby Main Colliery, where the N.C.B. had wagon repair facilities, until the collieries closed in 1986.

A 2008 estimate placed 43 genera in the family, but recent work has increased this number to 97. Phylogeny Molecular phylogenetic analysis of multigene DNA sequence data indicates the taxon Clavicipitaceae is paraphyletic, and consists of three well-defined clades, at least one of which is shared with members of another fungal family (Hypocreaceae). The evolution within the Clavicipitaceae is marked by interkingdom host jumping, and the range of this large and heterogeneous fungal group spans mutualistic plant symbionts, as well as parasites of plants, insects, and other fungi. Significance Many of its members produce alkaloids toxic to animals and humans. One of its most infamous species is Claviceps purpurea, which has historical significance as the cause of St. Anthony's fire, also known as ergotism. Ergotism is caused by ergot alkaloids, such as ergotamine and ergocristine, which are chemical derivatives of lysergic acid.

Kennedy. Mortal Error was published by St Martin's Press in hardback, paperback, and audiobook. Menninger is also the author of And Hell Followed With It: Life and Death in a Kansas Tornado, which won a Kansas Notable Book Award in 2011. Background and overview AR-15 rifle that accidental shooting theorists say killed Kennedy. Donahue first became interested in the story of the assassination of John F. Kennedy after participating in a re-creation of the shooting as one of eleven invited marksmen and sharpshooters. He demonstrated that it would have been possible for Lee Harvey Oswald to have fired three shots in the time specified by the Warren Commission, and was the only one of the eleven to better the 5.6-second window. However the experience highlighted to Donahue other concerns regarding the Warren report, and in particular the fact that the testimony of ballistics experts seemed to have been completely omitted from the Commission's evidence gathering. Conducting his own investigation, Donahue eventually decided that the bullet that struck Kennedy in the head had in fact been fired by United States Secret Service Special Agent George Warren Hickey Jr. (March 24, 1923 to February 25, 2005) from an AR-15 rifle carried in the car immediately following the President's vehicle. The proposed series of events is as follows: After the first shot which hit the street was fired, Hickey turns completely around and acquires Oswald on the sixth floor of the school book depository building. His turned head is documented in an AP photograph by James Altgens. Hickey reaches for the AR-15 under the seat, releases the safety and begins to lift the gun. The second shot is fired by Oswald, hitting the president and Texas Governor John Connally. The president's car and the follow-up car containing Hickey suddenly speed up. This is attested to by Secret Service agent Clint Hill. Agent Hickey, who is unstable because he is standing on the cushion of the seat, rather than the floor of the car, begins to fall back due to the acceleration of the vehicle, pulling the trigger of the AR-15. The gun is pointed toward Kennedy at that instant, and the bullet strikes him squarely in the back of the head. In parallel, he believes Oswald's second shot through Kennedy's neck may have already critically wounded the president before the third shot was fired. Donahue was encouraged in his investigations by Ralph Reppert, a reporter for the Baltimore Sun. In 1977, Reppert published Donahue's theory in two articles, which appeared on Sunday, May 1, and the following Sunday, with the second article accompanied by an editorial. These two men were keen to collaborate on a book on the subject, ... Reppert and Donahue agreed the next logical step would be to write a book. (Mortal Error 1992 paperback edition p. 121) but this was cut short by Reppert's ill health and subsequent death.In theory, at least, there was still the prospect of the book in collaboration with Reppert. In those heady days following the publication of the Sun article, both men had been in full, excited agreement that a book would be the next logical step. (Mortal Error 1992 paperback edition p. 188) Donahue later also approached author John Davis in the hope that a book would still be written.Much to Howard's delight, Davis said he was very interested in the theory and the possibility of doing a book. (Mortal Error 1992 paperback edition p. 211) The original copyright of Mortal Error read \\"Copyright 1992 Bonar Menninger and Howard Donahue\\"Mortal Error 1992 paperback edition flyleaf but some later editions did not mention Donahue's copyright. The Acknowledgements section (dated January 21, 1992) begins \\"Special thanks to Nick Beltrante for a great news tip, the late Ralph Reppert for showing the way, Howard and Katie Donahue for casting their lot with me ...\\". Donahue's reconstruction of the trajectories of the shots that struck Kennedy and Governor Connally supported the single-bullet theory for the second shot. Donahue decided that the \\"impossible trajectory\\" suggested by the Warren Commission was only necessary because there was an error in their positioning of Connally. He also concluded that this was Oswald's second shot, the first having missed owing to the misalignment of the rifle's telescopic sight but with a ricochet fragment slightly wounding Kennedy, and that Oswald had not fired a third shot, the third cartridge case found at the scene having been a slightly bent and empty one kept in the rifle's chamber.Mortal Error, Neither Donahue nor Menninger commented on whether the Warren Commission's key finding, that Oswald acted alone, was correct or not. Menninger notes that the theory is consistent with Oswald being involved in a conspiracy.p. 146 Of course, Donahue's understanding of the fatal shot in no way precluded the possibility that Oswald was involved in some kind of conspiracy. The term \\"cover-up\\" is mentioned in the book, rather than conspiracy. Synopsis The book takes the overall form of a narrative, in which Menninger describes Donahue's enquiries over twenty-five years. Chapter 1, A Chance Telephone Call, describes the events that led to Donahue's interest in the assassination, and a brief biography up until that point. Chapters 2 and 3, The Warren Report and The Critics, then give the context and summary of the report, and a detailed summary of its critics as of 1968. Chapter 4, The Single Bullet Theory presents Donahue's analysis of the shot which, according to the Warren Commission, struck both Kennedy and Connally, and suggests that the \\"magic bullet\\" trajectory is only necessary because the estimated position of the Governor was wrong. One of Oswald's shots could therefore have caused both men's injuries as claimed, but there remain other unanswered questions. Chapter 5, The Head Shot describes Donahue's analysis of the shot that hit Kennedy in the head, using the Warren Commission evidence (particularly the official autopsy report), stills from the Zapruder film and other photos, and holes drilled in a plaster skull. Numerous questions arise surrounding the completeness and even accuracy of the autopsy report. Chapter 6, A Fortuitous Encounter, describes Donahue's first correspondence with the Secret Service, and reviews the conclusions that led to his approaching them. He then by chance meets Dr. Russell Fisher, who led the Clark Panel which reviewed the autopsy in 1968, and who provides a copy of its report and many insights into details of the autopsy report and problems with the material provided to the panel. The suspicion of an accidental discharge by a Secret Service agent grows. Chapter 7, Kennedy's Unknown Wound, describes Donahue's conclusion that Kennedy suffered a scalp wound from a ricochet fragment from Oswald's first shot, using the material provided by Fisher. This resolves some problems with the timing of the reactions of Kennedy and Connally. Chapter 8, Murphy's Law, resumes the story of Donahue's career as his expertise and reputation as an expert witness grows. Chapter 9, The Discovery, describes more of Donahue's career, and his discovery of a photo showing a Secret Service agent holding a weapon that could have produced the kind of wound Kennedy suffered (the photo eventually used on the cover of the book). This revives his interest in publishing an article on his findings. Chapter 10, Breaking News, describes the first publication of Donahue's conclusions in articles by Ralph Reppert, and attempts to contact Hickey. Questions are asked regarding the nature of the cover-up, and particularly about whether Robert Kennedy was involved in it. Chapters 11 to 13 describe Donahue's experiences with the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations. Chapter 14, The AR-15, describes the ill health and death of Reppert, the reporter who wrote the articles that broke the story, which ends their proposed collaboration on a book on Donahue's theory and puts the book proposal on hold. The story of the AR-15 is told, with comparisons to the M-1, AK-47, M-14, and M-16, and some very critical assessments of the adoption of the M-14 and M-16. Chapter 15, The Final Breakthrough, presents more ballistics, especially estimating the size of the head shot entry wound and its relevance. John Davis, another possible author for the book, is contacted and is at first enthusiastic. Howard gives up his Masters studies in forensics but becomes increasingly employed as an expert witness despite this. Chapter 16, Hope Dies Hard, gives a brief history of the Secret Service, their nightmare assignment guarding Kennedy, and their reaction to the shooting. There follows Hickey's involvement in the Warren Commission and statements by him and other agents. Donahue's conversation with one notable conspiracy theorist is also described. Chapter 17, Today, is a recap as of spring 1991, describing reactions from Secret Service agents and others to the theory, and more attempts to contact Hickey. An afterword headed Note from the Publisher describes more attempts to contact Hickey, and to discuss the theory with the Secret Service and others, and why the decision to publish the book was taken. There are several appendices: * Appendix A: Testimony and Written Statements by Secret Service Agents Regarding Events of November 22, 1963 * Appendix B: 1968 Panel Review of Photographs, X-Ray Films, Documents, and Other Evidence Pertaining to the Fatal Wounding of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas * Appendix C: Excerpts from Interviews Conducted by the House Select Committee on Assassinations with Drs. Humes, Petty, Angel, Baden, Boxwell, and Loquvam * Appendix D: Trajectory Analysis from the House Select Committee on Assassinations Hearings Finally, there are chapter by chapter endnotes giving sources and their bibliographic details,pp. 335–350 and an index.pp. 351–361 Reception Reaction to Mortal Error has been mixed. James Balducki of the Associated Press cited that Donahue's \\"scrupulousness\\" made his theory of the JFK assassination plausible. Balducki praised the book, saying \\"Menninger interprets the story with a sharpness and fluidity that never unravels amid the surge of detail\\". David Pietrusza called Donahue's theory unusual due to him not tying the assassination to Mafia, CIA, or FBI, but that there were \\"still problems with Donahue's theory\\". The Hamilton Spectator criticized Mortal Error as \\"missing the mark\\". Pre-publication orders topped 100,000, but the book caused little impact at the time. Menninger commented in 2013 that it might be because Donahue's theory was \\"equally disliked by both conspiracy theorists and supporters of the Warren Commission.\\" Howard Donahue died in 1999. In The Smoking Gun documentary, his daughter Colleen Donahue Lorenzen remembers her father being surprised that his work aroused so little interest. At the time of his death, Donahue was working on another book on the same topic.http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1999-12-21/news/9912210051_1_donahue- ballistics-expert-warren-commission retrieved 16 December 2013 According to his daughter, Colleen Donahue Lorenzen of Riderwood, Mr. Donahue was working on a related book at his death. \\"He had discovered a TV tape in a German archive that showed the assassination from a different angle as well as a Secret Service agent standing up in a car.\\" In 2013, Australian journalist and former police detective Colin McLaren published a book and documentary both titled JFK: The Smoking Gun, examining and supporting Donahue's theory. =Lawsuit= Prior to the publication of the book in 1992, both the publisher and the author contacted Hickey to invite his participation in the book and offering him a chance to respond to the allegations. In 1995 Hickey sued St. Martin's Press over the claims made in Mortal Error. The suit was eventually dismissed in 1997 on the grounds that Hickey had waited too long after the book's initial publication to file against the publisher. Hickey refiled suit when the paperback edition was published, and later settled with St Martin's Press in 1998 on undisclosed terms. Sources state that Hickey died in either 2005 or 2011.

It was Masyanya who brought fame to Oleg Kuvaev. Masyanya, an amusing and touching heroine of the witty flash-animated series that first appeared in the Russian Internet on October 22 2001, has become nearly a cult figure. Oleg Kuvaev started everything on his own: he made up the characters and the stories, drew the flash-animated cartoons, recorded the sound, and uploaded the series (each of them about 3–4 minutes long) in the Internet. Biography Oleg Igorevich Kuvaev was born on 6 February 1967 in Saint Petersburg (Leningrad). He studied first at a school specializing in the English language, then at school majoring in physics and mathematics. Afterwards there were a number of higher institutions (including the Leningrad Institute of Aviation Instrumentation,http://2701.spb.ru/ind2601.html Kuvaev in the end of 1980sAcademy of Arts) and service in the Soviet Army. Then, he changed a lot of professions and places, mostly active as a painter and sculptor for more than 10 years, till the times of \\"Big Worldwide Web\\" come. From 1987 he was mainly into painting and sculpture, and from 1997 he turned to computer graphics. Kuvaev worked as a designer in several studios, in \\"computer gaming\\" industry as 3D animator and modeler, as web-designer, even java-programmer, in his free time experimenting with various computer technologies including freshly appearing vector animation (macromedia flash). In 2001 he founded “Mult.ru” studio to promote Masyanya. At this point it was just ten short rough-made cartoons about hooligan girl from Saint Petersburg. But it was successful. This resulted in epidemic masyanization of the whole country, which is perhaps the major achievement of Kuvaev. Full of fresh indigenous humor (sometimes caustic and absurd but still kind at bottom) the series about Masyanya appealed to the young generation whose life, interests and problems they actually focused on, at the same time embodying an alternative to commercial mass-culture. The popularity of Masyanya made Oleg Kuvaev expend much effort fighting for the copyright to his own creation between 2003-2005\\\\. Oleg was forced to fight in the forefront of struggling for copyright laws in Russia which was the stronghold of piracy at this time. Many Russian companies have illegally profited from Masyanya and, worse, have at times distorted the essence of the personage. For example, Oleg Kuvaev had to apply to court to compel the closing of the shoddy commercial talk show At Masyanya’s broadcast at the Russian pop-music TV channel Muz-TV that was using this character illegally, without permission. And finally Oleg and his team has won three such trials on copyright proving that the \\"times are changing\\". Until quite recently Oleg Kuvaev worked as the art-director and owner of “Mult.ru” studio. Besides Masyanya, the studio has released three more animated cartoons series: Eji and Petrutchoe, Six and a Half and Magazinchik Boe. Just like Masyanya they could be downloaded from the Internet free of charge and were translated in different TV-channels across Russia. Also numerous advertising cartoons, illustrations and even radio-shows were produced. Masyanya brought the studio about most of the income in merchandise and mobile services. The studio received copyright charges from companies that used the brand. Ice cream, cookies, DVDs, T-shirts and much more merchandise with Masyanya’s brand now were produced legally. Mobile operators were selling pictures, videos and ring-tones from Masyanya plentiful, which brought stable income. Despite this, suddenly, in the middle of 2006 Oleg Kuvaev closed all projects he was working on, left the studio, the city and the country, with almost no response whatsoever as the other workers of Mult.ru had kicked him out from his own company. Now he lives in Ramat Gan, Israel with his wife, Polina and his son and daughter. All studio projects are closed except his first and favorite - Masyanya. To the middle of 2008 there are summary more than 150 episodes of cartoon released. And new episodes still appearing made by Oleg Kuvaev himself as in the beginning of the whole story.

Usually classes are only loaded on demand. The Java run time system does not need to know about files and file systems because of classloaders. Delegation is an important concept to understand when learning about classloaders. A software library is a collection of related object code. In the Java language, libraries are typically packaged in JAR files. Libraries can contain objects of different types. The most important type of object contained in a Jar file is a Java class. A class can be thought of as a named unit of code. The class loader is responsible for locating libraries, reading their contents, and loading the classes contained within the libraries. This loading is typically done \\"on demand\\", in that it does not occur until the class is called by the program. A class with a given name can only be loaded once by a given classloader. Each Java class must be loaded by a class loader. Furthermore, Java programs may make use of external libraries (that is, libraries written and provided by someone other than the author of the program) or they may be composed, at least in part, of a number of libraries. When the JVM is started, three class loaders are used: # Bootstrap class loader # Extensions class loader # System class loader The bootstrap class loader loads the core Java librariesThese libraries are stored in Jar files called rt.jar, core.jar, server.jar, etc. located in the \`/jre/lib\` directory. This class loader, which is part of the core JVM, is written in native code. The extensions class loader loads the code in the extensions directories (\`/jre/lib/ext\`, or any other directory specified by the \`java.ext.dirs\` system property). It is implemented by the \`sun.misc.Launcher$ExtClassLoader\` class. The system class loader loads code found on \`java.class.path\`, which maps to the \`CLASSPATH\` environment variable. This is implemented by the \`sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader\` class. User-defined class loaders The Java class loader is written in Java. It is therefore possible to create your own class loader without understanding the finer details of the Java Virtual Machine. Every Java class loader has a parent class loader, defined when a new class loader is instantiated or set to the virtual machine's system default class loader. This makes it possible (for example): * to load or unload classes at runtime (for example to load libraries dynamically at runtime, even from an HTTP resource). This is an important feature for: ** implementing scripting languages, such as Jython ** using bean builders ** allowing user- defined extensibility ** allowing multiple namespaces to communicate. This is one of the foundations of CORBA / RMI protocols for example. * to change the way the bytecode is loaded (for example, it is possible to use encrypted Java class bytecode). * to modify the loaded bytecode (for example, for load-time weaving of aspects when using aspect-oriented programming).  Class Loaders in Jakarta EE  Jakarta EE (formerly Java EE and J2EE) application servers typically load classes from a deployed WAR or EAR archive by a tree of classloaders, isolating the application from other applications, but sharing classes between deployed modules. So-called \\"servlet containers\\" are typically implemented in terms of multiple classloaders.  JAR hell  JAR hell is a term similar to DLL hell used to describe all the various ways in which the classloading process can end up not working.https://web.archive.org/web/20130601002059/http://incubator.apache.org/depot/version/jar- hell.html Three ways JAR hell can occur are: * Accidental presence of two different versions of a library installed on a system. This will not be considered an error by the system. Rather, the system will load classes from one or the other library. Adding the new library to the list of available libraries instead of replacing it may result in the application still behaving as though the old library is in use, which it may well be. * Multiple libraries or applications require different versions of library foo. If versions of library foo use the same class names, there is no way to load the versions of library foo with the same classloader. * The most complex JAR hell problems arise in circumstances that take advantage of the full complexity of the classloading system. A Java program is not required to use only a single \\"flat\\" classloader, but instead may be composed of several (potentially very many) nested, cooperating classloaders. Classes loaded by different classloaders may interact in complex ways not fully comprehended by a developer, leading to errors or bugs that are difficult to analyze, explain, and resolve.http://articles.qos.ch/classloader.html The OSGi Alliance specified (starting as JSR 8 in 1998) a modularity framework that aims to solve JAR hell for current and future VMs in ME, SE, and EE that is widely adopted. Using metadata in the JAR manifest, JAR files (called bundles) are wired on a per-package basis. Bundles can export packages, import packages and keep packages private, providing the basic constructs of modularity and versioned dependency management. To remedy the JAR hell problems, a Java Community Process — JSR 277 was initiated in 2005. The resolution — Java Platform Module System — intended to introduce a new distribution format, a modules versioning scheme, and a common modules repository (similar in purpose to Microsoft .NET's Global Assembly Cache). In December 2008, Sun announced that JSR 277 was put on hold. The Java Module System was later rebooted as \\"project Jigsaw\\" which was included in Java 9.

In India, they are found in Namsai district and Changlang district of Arunachal Pradesh. Smaller numbers can be found in Lakhimpur district, Dhemaji district and Munglang Khamti village in Tinsukia district of Assam and possibly in some parts of China. Khamtis have a population of 100,031 out of which 40,005 live in Arunachal Pradesh and 60,026 in Assam. However, in Myanmar their total population is estimated at 200,000 people. The Tai Khamtis who inhabit the region around the Tengapani basin were descendants of migrants who came during the century from the Hkamti long region, the mountainous valley of the Irrawaddy. The Khamti possess South East Asian features. The Tai-Khamti are followers of Theravada Buddhism. The Tai-Khamti have their own script for their language, known as 'Lik Tai', which was originated from the Shan (Tai) script of Myanmar. Their mother tongue is known as Khamti language. It is a Tai language, closely related to Thai and Lao.  Society  The Khamti society is divided into classes, each signifying distinct status in the social hierarchy. The chiefs occupy the highest positions, followed by the priests, who wield considerable influence over all ranks. In the past, the slaves constituted the lowest rank.  Culture  = Lifestyle and customs = The Tai-Khamti are very strong believers of Theravada Buddhism. Houses have a prayer room, and they pray every morning and evening by offerings flowers (nam taw yongli) and food (khao tang som). They are peace-loving people. Houses of the Tai-Khampti are built on raised floors with thatched roofs. The roofs are constructed so low that the walls remain concealed. Wooden planks are used for flooring, and the walls are made of bamboo splices. The Khamti are settled, agriculturists. They use a plough (thaie) drawn by a single animal, either an ox or a buffalo (or even an elephant in olden days). The Khamti raise crops such as paddy rice (khow), mustard/sesame seeds (nga) and potato (man-kala). Their staple food is rice, usually supplemented by vegetables, meat and fish. They drink a beer made from rice (lau) as a beverage that is not served during festivals. Some of the well-known dishes are khao puk (made out of sticky rice and sesame seeds), khao lam (bamboo rice), paa sa (fresh river fish soup with special herbs), paa som, and nam som among others. Beef is considered taboo. = Language and script = Khamti is a Southwestern Tai language spoken in Myanmar and India by the Khamti people. It is a Daic language, specifically Kadai, Kam-Tai, Tai, Southwestern, Northwest branch. The language seems to have originated around Mogoung in Upper Myanmar. It is closely related to Thai and Lao languages. Currently, there are about 200,000 Khamti speakers in Myanmar and 130,00 in the northeastern part of India (Arunachal Pradesh and Assam areas). Three dialects of Khamti are known: North Burma Khamti, Assam Khamti, and Sinkaling Khamti. Speakers of Khamti are bilingual, largely in Assamese and Burmese. The Tai Khamtis have their own writing system called 'Lik-Tai', which closely resembles the Northern Shan alphabet of Myanmar with some of the letters taking divergent shapes. Their script is evidently derived from the Lik Hto Ngauk script since hundreds of years ago. There are 35 letters including 17 consonants and 14 vowels. The script is traditionally taught in monasteries on subjects like tripitaka, Jataka tales, code of conduct, doctrines and philosophy, history, law codes, astrology, and palmistry etc. The first printed book was published in 1960. In 1992 it was edited by the Tai Literature Committee, Chongkham. In 2003 it was again modified with tone marking by scholars of Northern Myanmar and Arunachal Pradesh. = Dress = The traditional Khamti dress of men is a full-sleeved cotton shirt (siu pachai) and multi-coloured sarong (phanoi). The women's dress consists of a long sleeve shirt (siu pasao), a deep-coloured long sarong (sinn) made from cotton or silk, and a coloured silk scarf (phamai). Married woman wear in plain black long wrap-around sarong (sinn) and above that a shorter green wrap-around cloth (langwat). Their jewelry consists of bright amber earrings, coral, beaded necklaces and gold ornaments. The Khamti men usually tattoo their bodies. The Khamti tie their hair into a large knot, which is supported by a white turban (pha-ho). The chiefs wear a long coat made of silk. The hair is drawn up from the back and sides in one massive roll, measuring four to five inches in length. An embroidered band, the fringed and tasseled ends of which hang down behind, encircles the roll. = Arts = The Khamti are renowned for their craftsmanship. Their sword is known as pha-nap. Their priests are known to be amateur craftsmen, who use wood, bone or ivory to carve religious statues. It is believed that by shaping ivory handles of weapons they will evince great skill. Their weapons include poisoned bamboo spikes (panjis), spear, bow and arrow, sword, and shield, usually made of rhinoceros or buffalo hide. The Khamti also have firearms which resemble old flint muskets and horse pistols. The sword is carried on the front of the body so that its hilt can be grasped in the right hand if needed. = Dance and drama = The dance \\"Ka Poong Tai\\" is one of the main dramatic art forms of the Tai Khamtis. Unlike many forms of traditional Arunachali dance, the Khamti dance is a dance drama, expressively and elegantly reflect the rich culture of the Khamti Buddhists. The traditional folk dances of the Tai Khamtis have their roots in Southeast Asian countries like Thailand and Myanmar. The community has many folk dances and each dance has a religious background. Some of the popular Tai Khamti dance dramas are: * Peacock Dance: Kaa Kingnara Kingnari is a prominent dance among the Tai Khamti. It is a Buddhist belief in nature which depicts the slow and gracious dance of mythical half-human and half-peacock that existed in the Himalayas. * CockFight Dance: Kaa Kong Tou Kai is a popular dance of Tai Khamti tribe of Arunachal Pradesh. It is performed by two or four people who wear a headgear shaped like the head of the cock, accompanied by the beats of drum (kongpat), cymbals (paiseng) and a set of gongs (mong-seeing). This dance usually shows a fight between two cocks and is inspired by the ancient tradition of entertaining the king with a cockfight. * Deer Dance: According to the legendary story, deer-dancing (kaa- toe) in the month of October (Nuen-Sip-Eit) is a celebration of the light festival based on the story of the spirits of the people and animals welcoming the return of Buddha after his preaching and thanksgiving to his mother and other spirits. This dancing of Ka-Toe is a Buddhist belief and religious in nature. * Demon Dance: The demon dance Kaa Phi Phai is another prominent dance and is performed on important social and religious occasions. The theme of this dance revolves around the attainment of the enlightenment by Lord Buddha despite attempts of 'Mara', the king of evil spirits to disturb deep meditation of the Lord. Kaa Phi Phai symbolises the victory of the holy over the evil and marks the Buddha's attainment of 'Nirvana'. =Festivals= Sangken is the main festival of Khamti. It is celebrated on 14 April. The true colors of secular India are at the Sangken festival where people irrespective of their tribe, caste, culture, race, etc., participate in the rituals. The main attraction of the festival is splashing clean water, which is the symbol of peace and purity. The images of Buddha are taken out and after the ceremonial bath. The procession is accompanied by drums, dances, and enjoyment. This holy bath of is an auspicious event. The celebration takes place for three consecutive days. During the celebration, the locals make homemade sweet and distribute them. The exchange of gifts is a common trait of the festival. There are festivals other than Sangken celebrated throughout the year. Some of the festivals are Poi-Pee-Mau (Tai Khampti New Year), Mai- Kasung-Phai, Khoa-Wa, Poat-Wa, etc. References  External links  * Ethnologue Profile * Buddhist temple gutted in fire * Significance of Poi Pee Mau * Taikhampti Namsai blog * TaiKhampti Youth website Category:Tribes of Arunachal Pradesh Category:Tribes of Assam Category:Ethnic groups in Myanmar Category:Buddhist communities of Myanmar Category:Buddhist communities of India Category:Social groups of Assam Category:Ethnic groups in Northeast India Category:Ethnic groups in South Asia ","title":"Khamti people"},{"id":"7723919","text":"Mikhail Roginsky (; 14 August 1931 - 5 July 2004) was a Russian painter.

Geography Elberton is located in southeastern Washington at . The nearest cities are Spokane and Pullman in Washington, Moscow in Idaho, and the Lewiston/Clarkston metropolitan area that spans the two states. It is in the middle of the Columbia River Plateau, in a region called the Palouse. History Elberton was first settled by C.D. Wilbur. The townsite was platted in 1886, and named by S.M. Wait for his deceased son Elbert. Elberton was incorporated as a fourth class town on 24 April 1896. It grew to have a population of 500 and at one time had a sawmill, a flour mill, a railroad (the Oregon-Washington Railroad and Navigation Company) that passed through and the world's largest prune dryer. A major fire started in the town in the 1930s and due to the Great Depression, many of the businesses and homes destroyed by the fire were too costly to rebuild. The fire, along with the Depression hurt the town greatly and it started to decline in population, with people packing up what they could carry and abandoning their homes that they could no longer afford to keep and maintain. In November 1966, residents of Elberton voted 15–5 in favor of dis-incorporation. Elberton became part of unincorporated Whitman County, Washington again within four years, when the county acquired the property of the town. Currently, about 15 people live in the area that once was Elberton. Many of the homes and buildings have gone or are partially collapsed, with only their foundations and perennial gardens that still bloom to serve as a reminder of what once was. Visitors coming through the Palouse ghost town can enjoy the few buildings, homes, and landmarks that still remain today, such as the fully intact United Brethren Church and the Elberton Cemetery. They may also read about the town's birth and death from the small plaque that was erected on the town's site.

The Mushroom label, is not to be confused with the Australian label of the same name, and was master minded by Vic Keary from the late 1960s from Chalk Farm Studios in Belmont Street, London. History Alisha Sufit was born in Hampstead, London, England. She attended the Arts Educational School in London, where she studied dance and drama. She went to Chelsea College of Art, London, to study painting and etching, and then to the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, France, after which she began performing in clubs and colleges around the UK, singing her own compositions plus traditional folk songs, self-accompanied on acoustic guitar and Appalachian dulcimer. She is also a visual artist, author and poet. In 1971, Sufit joined with ex Chelsea School of Art fellow student Jim Moyes plus two musical friends to form the psychedelic progressive folk-rock band, Magic Carpet. The line-up consisted of Sufit (vocals, guitar), Clem Alford (sitar, esraj, tamboura), Jim Moyes (guitar) and Keshav Sathe tabla, Indian percussion. The Magic Carpet band made an eponymous album released in 1972 on the UK Mushroom label, described as one of the first Indian-influenced psychedelic folk albums of the era. After a launch at the 100 Club in London, a performance at Cleo Laine and Johnny Dankworth's Stables Theatre Wavendon, radio airplay on Pete Drummond's Sounds of the Seventies on BBC Radio, plus several club and festival appearances, the group disbanded in 1972. During the 1970s and 1980s, Sufit performed solo and was also supporting artist alongside numerous musicians including The Enid, Fairport Convention, Terry Reid, the guitarist Davey Graham (also known as Davy Graham), The Incredible String Band, amongst others. She was invited to appear at the Incredible String Band's I.S.B. Convention concert in Leeds in 1994. Some fifteen years after its release, the Magic Carpet album began to receive acclaim, the original LP now a sought-after collectable on the international vinyl market, reissued on CD and limited edition vinyl by Magic Carpet Records (UK). In 1993, Sufit released the album Alisha Through the Looking Glass, on CD and heavy-weight EMI audiophile vinyl. The album included contributions by Ray Warleigh (saxophone), Bernard O'Neill (bass), Magic Carpet percussionist Keshav Sathe (tabla), Mamadi Kamara (congas and percussion), Chris Haigh (fiddle) and Alan Dunn (accordion). In 1994, Sufit released the album Love and the Maiden, recorded in 1974, a signed limited edition CD with sleeve notes by UK guitarist Davey Graham. In 1996, Magic Carpet sitarist Clem Alford and Sufit collaborated again to record the album Once Moor, subtitled Magic Carpet II, featured in Sound on Sound magazine. In 1999, she contributed two tracks to the compilation album Women of Heart and Mind, a collaboration of women singer-songwriters, and in 2005 she was included in the compilation CD and vinyl album Many Bright Things, contributing her own composition \\"Silver Witch\\", accompanied on mandolin and bass by Frank Defina. In 2008, she was invited to join the live band The Amorphous Androgynous on tour for the Creation of Peace free festival in Kazan, Tatarstan and a performance in Moscow, plus for the following year in Kiev, Ukraine, Green Man Festival, The Electric Picnic and the HMV Forum, London. She sang lead vocals on The Amorphous Androgynous Oasis reissue of Falling Down and was also invited to sing lead vocals on The Amorphous Androgynous' \\"Let It Be track\\" on the Let It Be Revisited album issued on CD and vinyl by Mojo magazine in 2010.

The Ritchey-Chrétien reflecting telescope is notable for the design of telescope mount. Instead of the typical mounting where the telescope moves on two rotating axes, the mirror end of the telescope is supported by six extensible struts, an arrangement known as a Stewart platform. This configuration allows the telescope to move in all six spatial degrees of freedom and also provides strong structural integrity. As a result, the ratio of bearing pressure and its own weight is very high. Furthermore, the six-leg structure allows for a very precise positioning and repeatability. The disadvantage of the system is that controlling and aiming a hexapod-mounted telescope is much more complex than with conventional telescope mounts. The mounting was designed by engineers of the company Vertex, in collaboration with astronomers of the Astronomy Institute of the Ruhr University Bochum (AIRUB) in Germany. Led by Prof. Rolf Chini, the HPT was thoroughly tested at AIRUB. In 2006, it was moved to its new location on Cerro Armazones Observatory in the Atacama Desert in Chile. AIRUB, in collaboration with the Astronomy Department of the Catholic University of the North (UCN), is developing an observatory there. A new control building was built next to the HPT on the summit of Cerro Murphy, a subsidiary peak of Cerro Armazones. Together with the Landessternwarte Heidelberg-Königstuhl, AIRUB developed the Bochum Echelle Spectrograph for the Optical (BESO) for the HPT. It is a copy of the Fiber-fed Extended Range Optical Spectrograph (FEROS) operated by the European Southern Observatory.

The Chabad members refused all offers of help from religious and political organizations; they insisted on going on the land. Adapting themselves to modern agricultural methods ... To them it was a point of honor to live as they were taught. This meant subsisting only on what they earned by their own toil\\".Jewish Observer and Middle East Review, 3 July 1959 Kfar Chabad, which is located just outside Lod and about 8 km southeast of Tel Aviv, includes agricultural lands as well as numerous educational institutions.

He made his main investigations and cartographic work in Venezuela and Colombia, thereby creating for both countries a complete set of maps and statistics after the tumultuous years following independence from the Spanish Empire. Biography Codazzi was born in the Italian city of Lugo. Since young he appreciated the ideals of the French Revolution and, after his studies at the military academy \\"Scuola di Artiglieria\\" of Pavia, actively served in the Napoleon Army. With the defeat of Napoleon in 1815 Codazzi moved away from Italy and after some travels went to Venezuela, where he offered his military knowledge to Simon Bolivar.Biography (in Italian) Successively he received the task of mapping the area of the Maracaibo Lake and the borders between Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador. The Venezuelan government named him Colonel and ordered the creation of an Atlas of Venezuela, a task that gave him international fame (in Paris Codazzi was awarded in 1842 the Legion of Honor by the King of France, on behalf of the French Academy of Science). Agustin Codazzi meanwhile took the Venezuelan citizenship from president José Antonio Páez and became Governor of Barinas, a region of southwestern Venezuela. In those years his academic activity of geographer was continuously interrupted by his duties as a military commander, suffocating many revolts. Codazzi even promoted the creation in the 1840s of the Colonia Tovar, a small German settlement in the Venezuelan central mountains that still exists today and has become one of the main tourist attractions near Maracay. With the fall of Páez, after a military insurrection, Codazzi was forced to escape to Cúcuta (Colombia), where he continued his geographic and mapping activity with military duties for the Colombian government. In 1852 Codazzi did a scientific and cartographic inspection of Panama for the British government: in 1854 - even if with no official mention of Codazzi's work — the Panama Canal project was done following exactly his indications and route. Codazzi died of malaria in February 1859 at the small town of Espíritu Santo in the Colombian mountains, in the arms of his friend Manuel María Paz, while he was mapping the area for the Comisión Corográfica. The town where he died has been renamed \\"Aldea Codazzi\\", and now is a city with a population of nearly 70,000 inhabitants. Venezuela honored the memory of Agustin Codazzi placing his remains inside the National Pantheon of Venezuela in 1942, where he is considered one the Heroes of Venezuela. Colombia's national geographical and cartographical institute, a government agency, is named after Agustin Codazzi (Instituto Geográfico Agustin Codazzi).

It is an extension of the evaluation function to defer evaluation until the position is stable enough to be evaluated statically, that is, without considering the history of the position or future moves from the position. It mitigates the effect of the horizon problem faced by AI engines for various games like chess and Go. Human players usually have enough intuition to decide whether to abandon a bad-looking move, or search a promising move to a great depth. A quiescence search attempts to emulate this behavior by instructing a computer to search \\"volatile\\" positions to a greater depth than \\"quiet\\" ones to make sure there are no hidden traps and to get a better estimate of its value. Any sensible criterion may be used to distinguish \\"quiet\\" positions from \\"volatile\\" positions. One common criterion is that moves exist in the position that can dramatically change the valuation of the position, such as captures in chess or Go. As the main motive of quiescence search is to get a stable value out of a static evaluation function, it may also make sense to detect wide fluctuations in values returned by a simple heuristic evaluator over several ply, i.e. a history criterion. The quiescence search continues as along as the position remains volatile according to the criterion. In order to get the quiescence search to terminate, plies are usually restricted to moves that deal directly with the threat, such as moves that capture and recapture (often called a 'capture search') in chess. In highly \\"unstable\\" games like Go and reversi, a rather large proportion of computer time may be spent on quiescence searching. The horizon effect The horizon effect is a problem in artificial intelligence which can occur when all moves from a given node in a game tree are searched to a fixed depth. Threats and opportunities beyond the search depth will remain undetected. This can result in the peculiar ploy of a program making delaying moves that degrade the position until it pushes a threat beyond the search depth or \\"horizon\\". By the time the threat must be dealt with, the position has become too degraded to be salvageable. Quiescence search attempts to mitigate this issue by extending the search depth in volatile positions where the heuristic value may have significant fluctuations between moves. Pseudocode This pseudocode illustrates the concept algorithmically: function quiescence_search(node, depth) is if node appears quiet or node is a terminal node or depth = 0 then return estimated value of node else (recursively search node children with quiescence_search) return estimated value of children function normal_search(node, depth) is if node is a terminal node then return estimated value of node else if depth = 0 then if node appears quiet then return estimated value of node else return estimated value from quiescence_search(node, reasonable_depth_value) else (recursively search node children with normal_search) return estimated value of children References Category:Game artificial intelligence Category:Computer chess Category:Articles with example pseudocode ","title":"Quiescence search"},{"id":"7724223","text":"Messiah is an extreme metal band from Switzerland.

It was designed by Emil Fahrenkamp and was built in 1930–31.  Building and design  In 1929 a competition was held between five architects to determine the designer of a prestigious new office block to house the headquarters of the mineral oil company, and Royal Dutch Shell subsidiary, Rhenania-Ossag. The victor was the German architect and professor Emil Fahrenkamp (1885-1966). After almost two years in construction, Shell-Haus opened in 1932. At the time the building was noted for its modernist design, for its striking wave-like facade, and for being one of the first steel-framed high-rise buildings in Berlin. In retrospect it is regarded as Fahrenkamp’s masterpiece and one of the most significant office block designs of the Weimar Republic. Shell-Haus' simple graceful forms are stylistically reminiscent of the German modern realist movement New Objectivity, but Fahrenkamp also incorporated more traditional aspects to his design. The most eye-catching feature of Shell-Haus is its main facade, which jumps forward in six gentle waves whilst at the same time increasing in height from six levels (five at the back) to ten. The building itself comprises four wings situated around a four-sided inner courtyard.  History  Before the building of Shell-Haus, the Tiergarten section of Berlin was primarily the location of expensive, elegant and luxurious private residences. Afterwards, and after World War II, the area housed more offices, with some of the former townhouses and villas gone and others having been converted to office use. The street itself became a significant connecting thoroughfare. During the Second World War Shell-Haus was used by the naval high command and the cellars were converted into a makeshift hospital. Despite the upper floors being damaged in the Battle of Berlin at the close of the war, Shell-Haus was one of Berlin’s few great edifices to survive the widespread destruction of the city relatively unscathed. After clearing away the war damage, in 1946 the Berlin electricity board BEWAG made Shell-Haus its head office. In 1958 Shell-Haus was designated an historical monument in order to protect it. However, this acknowledgement of its architectural importance did not save the building from post-war dilapidation, and it remained in a degraded state for many years to follow. Between 1965 and 1967, the Shell-Haus site was extended northwards with the construction of two similarly steel- framed buildings designed by the German architect Paul Baumgarten. Being comparatively conventional and unremarkable in design, they were not included under the original building’s historical monument protection, and a 1995 application to rectify this was squashed.  Renovation  When the subject of the building's long overdue restoration was raised in the 1980s progress was hampered by a dispute over the investment needed that continued into the mid-1990s. Renovation work had been carried out on the courtyard façade in the early 80s but this had failed to meet the required standards. In 1995 Bewag moved out of Shell-Haus in readiness for the renovation project. In 1997, after 13 years of discord, the restoration work began. At the time the total cost was estimated at around 50 million deutschmarks.Bewag saniert Shell-Haus, Berliner Zeitung, 11. Juli 1997 but by the time work was completed in February 2000, the expenditure had escalated to around 80 million marks.Bonjour, Shell- Haus, Berliner Zeitung, 5. April 2000 A major contributory factor to the considerable expense was the need to reopen the Longarina quarry near Rome,Longarina , Roman Travertine quarry owned by company CIMEP in Tivoli, in order to supply the appropriate travertine rock for the building façade. The expenditure and painstaking detail invested in Shell-Haus did not go unrewarded – the year 2000 saw the renovation work awarded the monument preservation prize, the Ferdinand von Quast Medal. In March 2000 the Berlin energy supplier GASAG became the new owner and occupant of Shell-Haus. Admirers and detractors Shell-Haus has several high-profile fans including the acclaimed German film director Wim Wenders - who featured the building in his 1970 directorial debut Summer in the City - and the architect Meinhard von Gerkan, who said that for him it was the most beautiful building in Berlin.Interview in der Berliner Morgenpost, 3 January 2007 On the other hand, one of the only times on record that Adolf Hitler inveighed against a specific building in Berlin, as opposed to modern urban architecture in general, was when he insulted Fahrenkamp with \\"You're the man who committed the crime of the Shell Building.\\" Despite this criticism, Fahrenkamp received some commissions for exhibition buildings, and had dealings with Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels, Hermann Göring, the head of the Luftwaffe and the Four Year Plan, and Albert Speer, Hitler's favorite architect and later Minister of Armaments and War Production.

The Kaysi were represented by the Jumblat and Arslan families and the Yemeni by the Hamdan and Al-Atrash families. And the other part stayed in Lebanon, and ruled Al Mnasef region, which contained many villages, and made Deir Koushe as their home village. and then moved to Bater, Chouf District; after Sheikh Bashir Jumblat, their relative, asked them to go and stay there, by an order from Prince Bashir Shehab, because of their daily fights/wars with their neighbors Al Nakad (which they wanted to be the leaders in Mnasef).

It was led by members of the Civic Union (which would later give rise to the modern Radical Civic Union) against the presidency of Miguel Juárez Celman (of the National Autonomist Party).

Yrigoyen, de la Ley Sáenz Peña al Golpe de Estado. Buildup Near the end of 1889, general discontent (mainly due to high inflation) encouraged the Civic Union (led by Aristóbulo del Valle and Leandro Alem) to attempt to oust President Miguel Juárez Celman, whose conservative rule, like those of previous presidents, had been marked by electoral fraud and corruption. Uprising and repression The uprising was led by a civil revolutionary junta and by General Manuel J. Campos. It counted on the indirect support of General and former President Julio Argentino Roca and on the lack of opposition by General Bartolomé Mitre. The uprising started on 26 July 1890 at the Buenos Aires Artillery Park. It met with swift repression on the part of the government forces, led by generals Carlos Pellegrini (the Vice-President), Roque Sáenz Peña, and Nicolás Levalle. Lacking initiative and ammunition, the revolutionaries were defeated in a matter of days, but the image of the government had suffered. Senator Pizarro demanded the resignation of the entire Executive Branch and the Senate, presided by General Roca, but President Juárez Celman was the only one to accept. Vice-President Pellegrini took office in his stead, to complete the remaining two years of his presidential term. Goals and results The Revolution of the Park was intended as a means to \\"avoid the ruin of the country\\" by bringing down \\"a government that represents illegality and corruption\\", according to its Manifesto. The revolutionary junta rejected \\"living without voice or vote..., witness the disappearance of rules, principles, guarantees..., tolerate the usurpation of our political rights..., and keeping those in power who have wrought the disgrace of the republic\\", and denounced that \\"there is no republic, no federal system, no representative government, no administration, no morality. Political life has turned into a for-profit industry.\\" Manifesto of the Revolution of the Park in Spanish Wikisource. The success of the revolution was limited to the resignation of Juárez Celman, who had been notorious for his corruption and abuse of power. The key elements outlined in its Manifesto, however, continued to be present in Argentine politics, as shown by the series of uprisings: Revolution of 1893 and Revolution of 1905.

It stands on the watershed between Mardale and Kentmere and is the highpoint of the south-eastern ridge of High Street, midway on its course to Harter Fell. Topography The head of the Kentmere valley lies to the south-west of the fell with rough slopes leading down over scree to Kentmere Reservoir. Mardale Ill Bell sends out a short grass-topped spur, Lingmell End, which splits the head of the valley into two. The north- eastern face of Mardale Ill Bell forms the craggy backdrop to Blea Water. This perfect corrie tarn is the deepest in the Lake District at 207 ft.Blair, D: Exploring Lakeland Tarns: Lakeland Manor Press (1993) Its outflow feeds Haweswater, joining with that of a second tarn, Small Water. Between the two, Mardale Ill Bell throws out the rocky spur of Piot Crag. Two tiers of crag drop down to the confluence at Mardale Waters. South-east of the summit a rough narrowing ridge drops to Nan Bield Pass at 2,100 ft, before rising again over rocky steps to Harter Fell. Nan Bield was the ancient trading route between Kentmere and the now drowned village of Mardale Green, submerged by the raising of Haweswater in the 1940s.

These each provide refuge for one person in extremis, entrance being via crawling. North-west from Mardale Ill Bell the grassy ridge crosses a wet depression and then expands into a wide plateau, triangular in plan. High Street and Thornthwaite Crag are at the other two corners, with the Roman road crossing north to south. Summit The summit has two large cairns on grass, the northern one being the top.

They got their name from the similarity of their, often, prominent proboscis that looks like the beak of a snipe.Snipe Fly (Family Rhagionidae) uwm.edu, 1 July 2014 Description Rhagionidae are medium-sized to large flies with slender bodies and stilt-like legs. The mouthparts are adapted for piercing and many species are haematophagous as adults, while others are predatory on other insects. They are typically brown and yellow flies, and lack bristles. The larvae are also predatory and are mostly terrestrial, although some are aquatic.Watson & Dallwitz Snipe flies in the genus Rhagio are sometimes called \\"down-looker\\" flies after their habit of perching head-downward on tree trunks. Classification Rhagio mystaceus \\"down-looker fly\\" Chrysopilus thoracicus mating - Female(top) and Male(bottom) The family is contained in Brachycera infraorder Tabanomorpha, and several of its constituent groups have been recently elevated to family rank. Atherix (and related genera) now comprise the Athericidae, Vermileo (and related genera) now comprise the Vermileonidae, and the genera Austroleptis and Bolbomyia are each now the sole members of their own families (Austroleptidae and Bolbomyiidae). The subfamily Spaniinae was sometimes accorded family rank, but this is not accepted in the most recent revisionary classification.Kerr, P.H. 2010: Phylogeny and classification of Rhagionidae, with implications for Tabanomorpha (Diptera: Brachycera).

Its nearest English equivalent is a hard act to follow. The difficulties alluded to may be both practical and psychological in nature, and are sometimes related to the aspect of the situation that no one really cares how you are doing, as the surroundings might have spent all their attention forces and enthusiasm admiring and applauding your predecessor. The etymology of this eponymous idiom relates to the Norwegian ski jumper Bjørn Wirkola. Since Wirkola would be the a priori and a posteriori star of any event he participated in, spectator attention and excitement levels were building up in the minutes leading up to any of his ski jumps, with appropriate crescendo and forte fortissimo culmination during his flying through the air – inadvertently causing the next participant, regardless of fame, nationality or ability, to jump in and into the vacuum of tired spectator silence. Other countries have similar expressions: for example in Australian popular culture the equivalent is \\"batting after Bradman\\" , in reference to Australian cricketer Don Bradman who was considered the greatest batsman in the history of Test cricket.

R. Tatlock. Henry Alken (The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs, Vol. 37, No. 212, - Nov 1920) pp. 247-254. His most prolific period of painting and drawing occurred between 1816 and 1831. Life Alken was born on 12 October 1785 in Soho, Westminster, and baptised on 6 November at St James's Church, Piccadilly. He was the third son of Samuel Alken, a sporting artist. Two of his brothers were George and Samuel Alken the Younger, also an artist. In 1789, the Alken family moved from Soho to 2, Francis Street East, Bedford Square. Young Henry first studied under his father and then with the miniature painter John Thomas Barber Beaumont (1774–1841), also known as J. T. Barber.Henry Thomas Alken (Painting in England: 1700-1850, Collection of Mr and Mrs. Paul Mellon) In 1801, Alken sent a miniature portrait of Miss Gubbins to the Royal Academy Exhibition. He exhibited a second miniature at the Royal Academy before abandoning miniature painting and taking on painting and illustrating. Early in his career, he painted sporting subjects under the name of \\"Ben Tally-O\\".Ralph Neville,Old Sporting Prints in The Connoisseur magazine, 1908 Alken married Maria Gordon on 14 October 1809 at St Clement's Church, Ipswich. On 22 August of the following year later the couple's first son was baptised. Alken went on to father five children, of whom two were artists, Samuel Henry, also a sporting artist, known as Henry Alken junior, and Sefferien junior. From about 1816 onwards Alken \\"produced an unending stream of paintings, drawings and engravings of every type of field and other sporting activity,\\"See text at Donald A. Heald (antique books) under Alken, Henry Thomas, \\"Illustrations to popular songs\\". and his soft-ground etchings were often colored by hand.Arthur M. Hind.A History of Engraving From the 15th Century to the Year 1914. When Alken was 26, he and his young family lived over a shop in Haymarket that belonged to print publisher Thomas McLean of the \\"Repository of Wit and Humour.\\" McLean paid Alken a daily wage of thirty shillings, considered a good income at the time. Alken died in April 1851 and was buried in Highgate cemetery. Although fairly affluent for most of his career, he fell on hard times towards the end of his life and was buried at his daughter's expense. Work Alken worked in both oil and watercolor and was a skilled etcher.Child's Gallery: Painting Annual His earliest productions were published anonymously under the signature of \\"Ben Tallyho\\", but in 1816 he issued The Beauties & Defects in the Figure of the Horse comparatively delineated under his own name. From this date until about 1831, he produced many sets of etchings of sporting subjects mostly coloured and sometimes humorous in character, the principal of which were: Humorous Specimens of Riding 1821, Symptoms of being amazed 1822, Symptoms of being amused 1822, Flowers from Nature 1823, A Touch at the Fine Arts 1824, and Ideas 1830. Besides these he published a series of books: Illustrations for Landscape Scenery and Scraps from the Sketch Book of Henry Alken in 1823, New Sketch Book in 1824, Sporting Scrap Book and Shakespeare's Seven Ages in 1827, Sporting Sketches and in 1831 Illustrations to Popular Songs and Illustrations of Don Quixote, the latter engraved by John Christian Zeitter. Alken provided the plates picturing hunting, coaching, racing and steeplechasing for The National Sports of Great Britain (London, 1821).Henry Thomas Alken. The National Sports of Great Britain (New York: D. Appleton, 1903). Alken, known as an avid sportsman,is best remembered for his hunting prints, many of which he engraved himself until the late 1830s. (Charles Lane British Racing Prints pp. 75–76). He created prints for the leading sporting printsellers such as S. and J. Fuller, Thomas McLean, and Rudolph Ackermann, and often collaborated with his friend the sporting journalist Charles James Apperley (1779–1843), also known as Nimrod.Alken, Henry. \\"Military Duties, Occurrences etc. etc.\\" (London: Thomas McLean, c. 1820-30). Nimrod's Life of a Sportsman, with 32 etchings by Alken, was published by Ackermann in 1842. In many of his etchings, Alken explored the comic side of riding and satirized the foibles of aristocrats, much in the tradition of other early 19th century omthe oldest of the great foxhound packs in Leicestershire.Fox Hunting and the Ban (icons.org.uk) A collection of his illustrations can be seen in the print department of the British Museum.

Early life  Bashlachev was born in Cherepovets, Soviet Union, the son of Nikolai Bashlachev and Nellie Bashlacheva. In 1977, Bashlachev graduated from Cherepovets High School in Cherepovets, and worked as a painter at the Cherepovets Metallurgical Plant with his father. In 1978, he resigned from the plant to enroll at the Ural State University in Yekaterinburg (then called Sverdlovsk) as a journalism major. Bashlachev graduated in 1983.Bashlachyov's biography at reproduktor.net (Russian)  Career  In early 1983, Bashlachev wrote \\"Griboyedov Waltz\\", which was the first song he had written. Throughout the 1980s, Bashlachev wrote and composed music. After he graduated at the Ural State University, Bashlachev left Sverdlovsk and returned to Cherepovets, where he worked for a year with the newspaper The Communist. There, he wrote articles about the power plant, and, later, about cafés. In May 1984, Bashlachev attended the Leningrad Rock Festival in Leningrad. There, he bought an acoustic guitar which he had taught himself to play. In September, he played some of his songs at his friend Leonid Parfyonov's apartment in Leningrad. Over the years, he would play several flat concerts. It is worth noting that rock music was censored in Russia during the 1970s and the 1980s. To get around this, musicians played for small audiences at their homes or at the homes of their friends. These gatherings were called \\"kvartirniks\\". In October, Bashlachev met music journalist Artemy Troitsky, who invited Bashlachev to Moscow to write and compose music.http://www.russianliterature.org/people/b/bashlachev.htm In December 1984, Bashlachev settled in Leningrad. In March 1985, Bashlachev along with Yuri Shevchuk played at the Leningrad Rock Festival. The two performed before an audience of six hundred concertgoers at the Leningrad Veterinary Institute in Leningrad. A recording of this concert was released under the title of \\"Kochegarka\\". Officially a worker at a coal boiler station, popularly known as Kamchatka (it also served as an underground rock venue), Bashlachev became a member of the Leningrad Rock Club. In June 1987 he performed at the Leningrad Rock Festival for the second and final time, and was awarded there Nadezhda (Hope) prize.Bashlachev's biography at the Russian Rock A-Z / russrock.ru  Death  Grave of Alexander Bashlachev. Shortly before his death, Bashlachev had difficulties with writer's block, rarely writing new songs and tending to avoid performing old ones. His last song, entitled \\"Cherry\\", was written in August 1987. He also became more isolated as his depression grew more severe. On February 17, 1988, Bashlachev died after falling from the window of the ninth floor of an apartment on Kuznetsov Avenue in Leningrad. The most likely cause of his death, though unverified, was suicide. He was buried at the Kovalevskoye Cemetery in the Leningrad Oblast. Bashlachev's son, Yegor, was born to his girlfriend Anastasia Rakhlina a few months after his death.

Biography Laslett was the son of a Baptist minister and was born in Bedford on 18 December 1915. Although he spent much of his childhood in Oxford, he was educated at the Watford Grammar School for Boys. He began a degree course in history at St John's College, Cambridge, in 1935 and graduated with a double first in 1938. He stayed in Cambridge for some time, conducting historical research, then in 1940 joined the Fleet Air Arm.John Dunn, Tony Wrigley, ‘Thomas Peter Ruffell Laslett (1915–2001)’, Proceeds of the British Academy, Volume 130, Biographical Memoirs of Fellows IV, edited by P. J. Marshall, pp. 109–129, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2005. After a period working on protection of Arctic convoys, Laslett then learned Japanese at the School of Oriental and African Studies, joined the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve as a lieutenant and worked on decoding Japanese naval intelligence. He was stationed first at Bletchley Park and later, after VE Day, in Washington, DC. It was at Bletchley Park that he met his future wife, Janet Crockett Clark, whom he married in 1947.Richard Smith, 'Laslett, (Thomas) Peter Ruffell (1915–2001)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edition, Oxford University Press, January 2005; online edition, May 2006 Laslett was demobilised in 1945 and returned to Cambridge, initially spending time at Peterhouse as a protege of Herbert Butterfield. In 1948, he was awarded a research fellowship at St John's College, based on his pre-war postgraduate research into Robert Filmer. His editing of Filmer's political writings resulted in the 1949 publication titled Patriarcha and Other Political Writings that, according to historian J. G. A. Pocock, was the work by which Laslett provided the initial inspiration for the \\"Cambridge School\\" of the history of political thought, the methods of which are now widely practised. Laslett combined such academic activity with a lifelong concern to engage a wider audience. He worked simultaneously as a BBC radio producer for the Third Programme. One product of this desire to reach a wider audience was his pathbreaking and highly popular book The World We Have Lost: England Before the Industrial Age (1965; US edition, 1966), issued in a second edition in 1971 and in a retitled third revised edition, The World We Have Lost: Further Explored (1983; US edition, 1984). Simon Mitton credits Laslett with having launched in 1948 the radio broadcasting career of the astronomer Fred Hoyle.Mitton, Simon, Fred Hoyle a life in science, p. 125, Aurum Press, 2005. In 1953, having earlier discovered and begun research into a substantial proportion of the library of John Locke, privately held at a shooting lodge in the Scottish Highlands, Laslett earned an appointment as a university lecturer in history at Cambridge and was elected a fellow Trinity College; thereafter, his involvement with the BBC declined and in 1960 ended. He worked with the philanthropist Paul Mellon and various institutions to negotiate the purchase and transfer of the library to the more suitable and accessible environs of the Bodleian in Oxford. He continued work in the history of political theory, demonstrating (against the accepted account) that Locke's Two Treatises of Government had been written prior to the English Glorious Revolution of 1688–9, remarking that the \\"Two Treatises is an Exclusion Tract, not a Revolution Pamphlet.\\"Laslett, \\"Introduction,\\" in John Locke, Two Treatises of Government (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), p. 61. He published an edition of the treatises in 1960, subsequently reprinted many times, which is now recognised as the definitive account of these pillars of modern liberal democracy. From 1957 he founded and co-edited Philosophy, Politics and Society, a series of collections on political philosophy. Laslett took up an entirely different line of historical research from the early 1960s. Trying to understand 17th-century listings of the inhabitants of Clayworth and Cogenhoe, Northamptonshire, he became persuaded of the need to pursue historical demography more systematically. In 1964, Laslett and Tony Wrigley co-founded the Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure. With funding from the Social Science Research Council, the Cambridge Group worked alongside amateur volunteers on local records, and established the journal Local Population Studies. Laslett's practical reformism found an outlet from the 1960s in his efforts, together with Michael Young, to develop the Open University. In 1963 he ran a series of five programmes on Anglia Television, the \\"Dawn University\\", which attracted a great deal of attention although the funding had to wait two more years until Harold Wilson took up the idea. Laslett was Reader in Politics and the History of Social Structure at Cambridge University (the title reflecting his own unusual mix of historical interests) from 1966 until retirement in 1983. At this point, his interests turned to the historical understanding and practical betterment of the elderly. Laslett played a pivotal role in founding the University of the Third Age in 1982. He died on 8 November 2001, aged 85, and was interred at Wolvercote Cemetery in Oxford, and was survived by his wife, Janet, and two sons. His library of early printed books by and about Filmer, Locke, and political thought (including political economy) was sold by Quaritch in 2006.

The one surviving manuscript, dated between 970 and 990,See Woolf 1955, p.1 is preserved in the Exeter Book between the poems The Phoenix and The Wanderer. Juliana is one of only five Old English poetic texts that describe the lives of saints. (The others include Elene, Andreas, and Guthlac A and B.)See Fulk 2003, p. 97 Juliana is Cynewulf's second longest work, totaling 731 lines. However, due to damage to the Exeter Book over time—such as staining, charring, and the loss of pages---there are two gaps in the text of Juliana, amounting to a loss of 130 to 140 lines. Through comparative analyses, it has been determined that no more than a single page worth of material could be missing from either gap, and it is therefore very likely that a single sheet, which would have been folded in the middle to form two pages, was accidentally lost when the original manuscript was being bound. Cynewulf's \\"Juliana\\" is presented entirely in Old English alliterative verse and is transmitted in a late West-Saxon dialect. Cynewulf likely derived the poem from earlier Latin accounts of the same story—similar to those appearing in the Acta sanctorum or the Martyrology; however, it is likely that Cynewulf was adapting his version from an unknown Latin source that has since been lost.See Frederick 2005, p. 61 Summary The Juliana story takes place during the Diocletian persecution and was probably first set in writing during the rule of Constantine I.See Woolf 1955, p.11 The story begins by illustrating the harsh life for Christians under the rule of Galerius Maximian, describing various acts of violence visited upon Christians. Juliana is introduced as the daughter of Africanus of Nicomedia, who has promised Juliana's hand in marriage to Eleusias, a wealthy senator and friend of Maximian. Although Juliana was born a pagan, she has converted to Christianity, and so she vehemently resists being married to the pagan Eleusias, not wanting to violate the relationship she shares with God. When she publicly voices her dissatisfaction, Eleusias becomes outraged and insists that he has been publicly insulted. Africanus, upon hearing of this, becomes similarly outraged, believing his daughter has embarrassed him by refusing the hand of a man of much higher status. As a result, Africanus declares that Eleusias is free to punish Juliana in whatever way he wishes. Eleusias proceeds to have Juliana stripped naked, hung from a tree by her hair, whipped, and beaten with rods for over two hours. Then she is thrown into prison. While in prison, Juliana is visited by a demon pretending to be an angel of God, who tries to trick her into blasphemy. Juliana, being the epitome of unwavering Christian faith, doesn't fall for the charade and prays to God for guidance. A voice tells her to reach out and grab the demon, and Juliana obeys. This point forward contains the bulk of the story, in which Juliana and the demon have a lengthy war of words, with Juliana clearly dominating. She holds the demon and forces it to confess all of its wicked deeds several times over, ostensibly humiliating him forever in the kingdom of Hell. After her victory over the visiting demon, Eleusias comes back for Juliana and seems to offer her a chance to change her mind. Not surprisingly, Juliana refuses him once again, and just as scathingly as before. Eleusias then attempts to have Juliana burned alive in hot lead. Yet, even though he has Juliana placed in the fire, not a spot on her body or clothes is touched by the flames. Angrier than ever, Eleusias finally resolves to have Juliana beheaded, for which she becomes a Christian martyr. Assessment The entire story as told by Cynewulf deviates little from the Latin source he likely used, with the same “progress of action” and “phraseology” observed in both texts. However, there are some unsubtle differences worth mentioning. One is that the character of Eleusius is portrayed in Cynewulf's text with a much more sinister and intolerant manner to his behaviour.See Fulk 2003, p.100 In the Acta Sanctorum, Eleusius is presented as an “easy-going man,” willing to accept Christianity just as long as he is not baptized: a practice that would compromise his position as a powerful senator. In Cynewulf's version, however, Eleusias eagerly worships the heathen gods, and his faith in the “devil- inspired idols” is equitable to Juliana's faith in her own Christian God. Thus, Cynewulf polarizes Juliana and Eleusius in a way that is analogous to the conflict of good and evil.See Wolf 1955, p.15 In fact, Cynewulf may have been trying to play on an Anglo-Saxon idea of a social construct called a dryht.See Frederick 2005, p.62-63 The argument goes that, according to Anglo- Saxon ethos, a good king is a provider who earns the loyalty of those he governs. Cynewulf could have used this notion to illustrate a clear difference between Juliana's God (the “good king”) and Satan\\\\pagan gods (the \\"bad king\\"). This is evident in the fact that Juliana is repeatedly guided and protected (with the one exception of the beheading) while the demon, an agent of Satan, is coerced into serving his master and is offered no guidance or protection. A further difference to be noted between Cynewulf's Juliana and its counterpart in the Acta Sanctorum include the author's omission of Juliana's insistence that she will only marry Eleusius if he becomes a prefect. This was likely left out by Cynewulf to show Juliana as a polished saint and further magnify her polarization to Eleusius. There is also an important stylistic difference attributed to the adaptation efforts of Cynewulf; namely, the importing of military or battlefield language into the story.See Frederick 2005, p.70-71 Although this is a recurring theme in both Latin and Old English literature, the military language does not appear in the Latin counterparts, such as the Acta Sanctorum, and so it is believed that Cynewulf probably wove it in for two possible reasons: the first being to make Juliana easier to relate to; the second, to create the metaphor that Juliana's spirit was a sort of impenetrable fortress, impervious to the attacks of Satan and his demonic henchmen.See Frederick 2005, p.73 It is said that Cynewulf's Juliana seems to lack the emotional vigour and imagination of some of the poet's other compositions.See Bradley 1982, p.302 The language is thought to be “less elaborate,” but still maintains the rhetorical cunning that Cynewulf is accustomed to.See Magennis 2005 As in his Elene, the Old English tradition of placing the characters and events of the story in a heroic setting is upheld; Juliana is celebrated as a martyr who defeats the advances of the devil. The idea of a woman figuring prominently in a tale such as this was not new to Anglo-Saxons. Germanic literature often permitted women to play instrumental roles in the heroic setting of events. For instance, through Bede's writings we hear of such women providing the stimulus for political and religious developments in Britain.See Bradley 1982, p.301 Notes References *Bradley, S.A.J, ed. and tr. 1982.

History The Cameri theater was founded with the purpose of promoting local theater, in contrast to Habima Theater, which had roots in Russian theater. The Cameri presented works about the daily life of persons in the fledgling state of Israel. Cameri is the theater where the Israeli nationalist play He Walked Through the Fields premiered just two weeks after the state of Israel was formally established in May 1948. He Walked Through the Fields, written by Moshe Shamir, was later adapted to film starring Moshe Dayan's youngest son Assi Dayan. The Cameri, Tel Aviv's municipal theater, stages up to ten new productions a year, in addition to its repertoire from previous years. The theater has 34,000 subscribers and attracts 900,000 spectators annually. In 2003, the Cameri moved into the Tel Aviv Performing Arts Center complex, adjacent to the New Israeli Opera, the Municipal Library and the Tel Aviv Museum of Art. The new theater has five auditoriums: Cameri 1, the largest auditorium, has 930 seats; Cameri 2 has 430 seats, the Black Box seats 250, and the Rehearsal Hall seats 160. Cameri interior The Cameri's social action programs include the Peace Foundation, which brings together young Israelis and Palestinians to watch theater performances, and Theater in Education, which brings high school students, university students and special needs audiences to the theater. The Cameri also offers ticket subsidies for senior citizens and simultaneous translation of its productions into English, Russian and Arabic. The director general of the Cameri, Noam Semel, founded the Institute of Israeli Drama, which promotes Israeli theater in Israel and abroad.

Life He was the third son of Joseph Bridgett, a silk manufacturer of Colney Hatch, and his wife Mary (born Gregson). He was born at Derby on 20 January 1829. His parents were baptists, and Bridgett was educated first at Mill Hill School and then at Nottingham; but in 1848 he was admitted to Tunbridge School, and on 20 March 1845 was baptised into the Church of England. He was in the sixth form at Tunbridge from 1845 to 1847, proceeding thence as Smythe exhibitioner to St. John's College, Cambridge, where he was admitted pensioner on 23 February 1847. He intended taking orders in the Anglican church, but in 1850 he refused to take the oath of supremacy necessary before graduation, and was received into the Roman Catholic Church by Father Stanton at the Brompton Oratory. For six years he studied on the continent; he joined the Redemptorist Order, and in 1856 was ordained priest. Mission work is the chief function of the order, and as a missionary Bridgett was very successful. In 1868, he founded the Confraternity of the Holy Family attached to the Redemptorist church at Limerick. Bridgett, however, found time for a good deal of literary and historical work, and produced several books of value, dealing mainly with the history of the Reformation. His earliest work was The Ritual of the New Testament, 1873, 8vo. In, he published Our Lady's Dowry, which reached a third edition in 1890. His largest work was his History of the Holy Eucharist in Great Britain, 1881, 2 vols. 8vo. In 1888, he published a Life of Blessed John Fisher (2nd edit. 1890); in 1889 The True Story of the Catholic Hierarchy deposed by Queen Elizabeth; and in 1891 The Life and Writings of Sir Thomas More. He also edited the Sermons (1876) of Bishop Thomas Watson (1513-1584); Lyra Hieratica. Poems on the Priesthood, 1896 ; and wrote The Discipline of Drink; an historical inquiry into the principles and practice of the Catholic Church regarding the use, abuse, and disuse of alcoholic liquors, 1876, Historical Notes on Adare, Dublin, 1885, 8vo, and Sonnets and Epigrams on Sacred Subjects, London, 1898, 8vo. He died of cancer at the monastery of St. Mary's, Clapham, on 17 February 1899, and was buried on the 21st in the Roman Catholic cemetery at Mortlake.

The group was formed in 1989 by Frith and they performed extensively across North America and Europe for the next ten years, including at the 14th Festival International de Musique Actuelle de Victoriaville in Victoriaville, Quebec, Canada in May 1997. They recorded their first album, Ayaya Moses in 1996, and released a live album, Upbeat in 1999. The quartet experimented with guitar music, composing and performing their own material, improvising, and re-arranging existing guitar pieces by other composers. Their music varied from \\"tuneful and pretty, to noisy, aggressive and quite challenging.\\" History The quartet comprised four \\"avant-garde\\" guitarists and composers: Englishman Fred Frith from Henry Cow, French Canadian René Lussier from Conventum, and United States musicians Nick Didkovsky from Doctor Nerve and Mark Stewart from Bang on a Can. Frith had been collaborating with Lussier on various projects since the early 1980s, had performed regularly with Stewart, and had produced Doctor Nerve's album, Armed Observation (1987). Frith originally created the quartet in 1989 to perform a composition for four electric guitars, \\"The As Usual Dance Towards the Other Flight to What is Not\\" that he had previously written for, but not performed in, Les 4 Guitaristes de l'Apocalypso-Bar. The original quartet, Lussier, Didkovsky, Mark Howell and Frith, recorded the composition in April 1992 and it was released on Frith's Quartets album in 1994. Later Stewart replaced Howell and the group became known as the Fred Frith Guitar Quartet. The quartet's first album under its new name was recorded in Radio-Canada's Studio 12 at Maison Radio-Canada in Montreal in July and November 1996, and was released on Lussier's own Ambiances Magnétiques label. The CD consisted of three pieces composed by Italian Olivia Bignardi and Québécois Claude Vivier; a piece composed by each member of the group; and a collection of improvised suites by the quartet.

Wrigley and Peter Laslett co-founded the Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure in 1964. Wrigley's scholarly works focus on demographic history, and the long-term causes and effects of urbanization and industrialization. Among his many publications, Wrigley is known for the book Continuity, Chance and Change, published in 1988, in which he explained why Malthus was wrong about the law of diminishing returns slowing population growth. His most celebrated work, however, is The Population History of England, 1541-1871, published in 1981 with co-author Roger S. Schofield. Wrigley completed undergraduate and postgraduate courses at Peterhouse, Cambridge between 1949-1958. He was elected as a Fellow of Peterhouse in the latter year and held office until 1979, when he became an Emeritus Fellow there and also Professor of Population Studies at the London School of Economics. He ceased the professorship in 1988 to become a Senior Research Fellow at All Souls College, Oxford and returned to Cambridge as Professor of Economic History for the period 1994-1997.

Background In late November 1931, Imperial Japanese Army commander in chief General Shigeru Honjō dispatched 10,000 soldiers in 13 armored trains, escorted by a squadron of bombers, in an advance on Jinzhou from Mukden. This force advanced to within 30 kilometers of Chinchow when it received an order to withdraw. The operation was cancelled by Japanese War Minister General Jirō Minami, due to the acceptance of modified form of a League of Nations proposal for a \\"neutral zone\\" to be established as a buffer zone between the Republic of China proper and Manchuria pending a future China-Japanese peace conference by the civilian government of Prime Minister Wakatsuki Reijirō in Tokyo. However the two sides failed to reach a lasting agreement. The Wakatsuki government soon fell and was replaced by a new cabinet led by Prime Minister Tsuyoshi Inukai. Further negotiations with the Kuomintang government failing, the Japanese government approved an increase in the military forces in Manchuria. In December, the rest of the 20th Infantry Division, along with the 38th Mixed Brigade of the 19th Infantry Division were sent into Manchuria from Korea while the 8th Mixed Brigade, 10th Infantry Division was sent from Japan. Following the defeat of General Ma Zhanshan in Heilongjiang province, and in anticipation of reinforcements, a new Japanese offensive was launched in Manchuria on December 21. General Honjo insisted that his troops were moving out \\"to clear the country of bandits,\\" and added that the Chinese evacuation of Chinchow was \\"absolutely imperative\\". Most of the \\"bandits\\" were actually the organizing Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies but some real bandits were also exploiting the chaos following the collapse of the Chinese government and its Northeastern Army following the Mukden Incident and the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. Japanese advance While the other Japanese forces and collaborationist Manchurian troops spread out from their bases along the South Manchurian Railway rail lines to clear the countryside, from Mukden, the Japanese headquarters in Manchuria, the brigades of the 12th Infantry Division advanced southward in the night, supported by squadrons of Japanese bombers to force the Chinese to evacuate Jinzhou. The Japanese estimated the Chinese at Jinzhou had 84,000 defenders, with 58 artillery pieces placed to support two separate systems of entrenchments defending the city. The Chinese first defensive line, 20 miles north of the city, was a series of trenches aimed to stop the Japanese advance at the Taling River Bridge on the Peiping-Mukden Railway. The Chinese had a second line of earthworks and entrenchments completely encircling Jinzhou to fall back on if the Japanese forces broke through the first line. Japanese Lieutenant General Jirō Tamon's troops cautiously advanced south from Mukden. The temperature was 30 below zero, and Japanese forces were camouflaged in white. Japanese reconnaissance aircraft reported a force of at least 3,000 Chinese \\"bandits\\" waiting to defend Panshan County. Brushing aside these Chinese skirmishers in a series of minor clashes, Tamon prepared to meet and crush the first serious Chinese resistance, expected at Goubangzi, 50 kilometers north of Jinzhou. By the evening of December 31, 1931, the Japanese advance guard was fifteen kilometers from Jinzhou on the banks of the Taling river. General Tamon halted briefly to bring up the rest of his 2nd Division, for the final drive on Jinzhou. The Japanese War Office announced in a radio broadcast \\"The Battle of the Taling River\\", setting up microphones behind the Japanese lines, arranging an elaborate hookup to broadcast the sound of firing to Tokyo, but then had to call off the broadcast when the Chinese retreated without giving combat. Japanese forces occupied Jinzhou on January 3, 1932, with the local populace waving Japanese flags homemade during the night to appease the conquerors. Aftermath On the Chinese side confusion reigned. The old government of Chiang Kai-shek at Nanjing had resigned and a new one under Premier Sun Fo had been formed. Additionally, Marshal Zhang Xueliang's defenders were in disorderly retreat toward the Great Wall, leaving only a small garrison to protect the few government functionaries who remained behind. At Nanjing Eugene Chen, the new Kuomintang Foreign Minister, asserted that his government had never ordered evacuation of Jinzhou, but, on the contrary, had ordered Marshal Zhang repeatedly to stand his ground. Nine Chinese generals in various parts of China denounced Premier Sun Fo's new government, blaming it for the humiliating loss of Jinzhou without a struggle. The day after the fall of Jinzhou, the Imperial Japanese Army occupied Shanhaiguan, thus completing its military control over south Manchuria.

The film is about a dispute between a number of people about a unique but possibly toxic tree growing in an unnamed forest. The film is largely seen from the point of view of Goro Yabuike (Kōji Yakusho), a police negotiator who has been relieved of his duties following his failure to prevent the death of an important hostage. He stands in the middle of the conflicting opinions about the future of the tree, and has to decide which course to commit himself to. Plot Goro Yabuike is a hostage negotiator. He attends an incident where an MP is being held at gunpoint. The captor's ransom note reads \\"Restore the Rules of the World\\". When Yabuike has a chance to shoot the hostage-taker he hesitates. The captor kills the MP, and is in turn killed by the police. Afterwards Yabuike explains that he thought he could help both men. He is suspended from duty. He is dropped off in the middle of a mysterious forest. He comes across various people who are in a dispute about an apparently unique tree named 'Charisma' growing in a clearing in the forest. Jinbo believes the plant is toxic will eventually kill the whole forest. She wants to poison the tree so that the forest can be restored to its original condition. Kiriyama, a former sanatorium patient, wants to protect the tree, even if this leads to the death of the rest of the forest. Other military figures want to take the tree away for a collector. Yabuike becomes the central figure in the dispute, somehow able to decide what will happen. After the tree has been stolen by the milias, recaptured by Kiriyama with Yabuike's help, and burned by Jinbo, a new, bigger tree appears, possibly similar to Charisma. Yabuike mulls over the two choices he faces: saving the individual tree, or saving the whole forest. He decides that the dichotomy is a false one. First that life and death are part of the same force, and second that every tree is a special tree and together they are a forest, but simultaneously no tree signifies anything more than any other. Ultimately some will live and some will die and some will be killed and some will be saved. When the head of the militia takes Jinbo hostage, Yabuike has no hesitation in shooting, though not killing, him. The final scene shows Yabuike making his way back to the city to seek treatment for the injured militia. In the distance, the city can be seen in flames.

Release Charisma was shown at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival. It was later released in Japan on February 26, 2000. Reception Kris Nelson of Dreamlogic.net gave the film a favorable review, noting that \\"the soundtrack is perfect\\". The film has been interpreted by some as an allegorical tale about the structure of Japanese society, and the tension between the importance of individuality on the one hand, and the importance of the group on the other. It is also possible to discern an ecological message.

He moved to stone as a medium, and spent the years from 1982 to 1987 in Pietrasanta, Italy, studying carving in the studio of Sem Ghelardini. While still in Italy, Clayton accepted a commission for four sets of five marble cows from for the Trammell Crow Company, a large Dallas real estate development concern. Three of the sets now stand in Texas at the Arboretum at Great Hills in Austin, at Founder's Park in Las Colinas in Irving, and at Trammel Crow Park in Dallas. The fourth set is at One Park Plaza in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. A sculpture of a half completed cow, emerging from stone, sits in the front yard of Clayton's former home in Dallas. The cows at these sites stand where live cows actually grazed in the recent past. In fact, the models for the sculptures were made in 1980 from cows standing on the hill where the Las Colinas cows now appear to graze. Each cow required four tons of marble. The cows at the Arboretum site are much loved by children. Clayton maintained a workshop in Dallas and was a member of the Stone Carvers Guild.

Taxonomy In 1996, it was determined that Akysis is the sister group to all other akysids, then only including Parakysis, Acrochordonichthys, and Breitensteinia. However, it was acknowledged that the genus Akysis was poorly-sampled at the time and may be deemed non-monophyletic in the future. In 1998, it was recognized that the large genus Akysis includes two species groups. The first species group was the Akysis variegatus group, for species more closely related to the type species; the other group was the pseudobagarius group for species more closely related to the formerly-named Akysis pseudobagarius; the authors recognized it as conceivable that the groups represented two genera, but tentatively retained the species in a single genus. Since then, the genus Pseudobagarius was erected for this species group, leaving only members of the A. variegatus group in the genus Akysis. In 2007, Laguvia manipurensis was redescribed to the genus Akysis as part of the A. variegatus group. Distribution These fish are found in fast-flowing streams in Southeast Asia. This area is bordered by the Irrawaddy River drainage to the west, the Barito River drainage to the east, the Lancangjiang (upper Mekong) drainage to the north, and the Citarum River drainage to the south. Akysis have been reported from Java, Sumatra, Borneo, Tenasserim, Thailand, Myanmar, and, most recently, the distribution of Akysis has been discovered to include India. Description These small catfish can be distinguished by their general colouring of yellow markings on a brown background. Fishes of the genus Akysis are diagnosed by having tough leathery skin covered with tubercles which are arranged in longitudinal rows along the sides, the anterior margin of the pectoral spine with a notch visible dorsally, the nasals with expansions beyond the canal-bearing teeth, and no palatal teeth. These fish are distinguished from the members of the genus Pseudobagarius by a number of characteristics: these species have a terminal mouth; the posterior and anterior nostrils being smaller and located further apart with a distance between the base of the nasal barbel and anterior nostril; the anterior nostrils are situated at the tip of a short tube; and the caudal fin is truncate or emarginate rather that forked. The maximum adult size of Akysis species is less than 70 millimetres (2.8 in) SL. Ecology Catfishes of the genus Akysis are small cryptically-coloured species. Akysis are small secretive fishes that occupy a variety of habitats. Most species typically inhabit clear swift-flowing upland streams with sandy or rocky substrates. Some species are reported from the muddy side and main channels and deltas of large rivers. In smaller streams they may be found hiding in leaf litter and woody debris, in patches of live vegetation such as Cryptocoryne affinis, or in shallow riffle areas under coarse gravel or larger stones. Species of Akysis also are reported from the shallow margins to the bottom depths of large rivers where they are usually taken in trawls together with decaying vegetation.  Species  There are currently 24 recognized species in this genus: * Akysis bilustris Ng, 2011 * Akysis brachybarbatus Chen, 1981 * Akysis clavulus Ng & Freyhof, 2003 * Akysis clinatus Ng & Rainboth, 2005 * Akysis ephippifer Ng & Kottelat, 1998 * Akysis fontaneus Ng, 2009 * Akysis fuliginatus Ng & Rainboth, 2005 * Akysis galeatus Page, Rachmatika & Robins, 2007 * Akysis hendricksoni Alfred, 1966 * Akysis heterurus Ng, 1996 * Akysis longifilis Ng, 2006 * Akysis maculipinnis Fowler, 1934 * Akysis manipurensis (Arunkumar, 2000) * Akysis microps Ng & Tan, 1999 * Akysis pictus Günther, 1883 (Burmese stream catfish) * Akysis portellus Ng, 2009 * Akysis prashadi Hora, 1936 (Indawgyi stream catfish) * Akysis pulvinatus Ng, 2007 * Akysis recavus Ng & Kottelat, 1998 * Akysis scorteus Page, Hadiaty & López, 2007 * Akysis variegatus (Bleeker, 1846) * Akysis varius Ng & Kottelat, 1998 * Akysis vespa Ng & Kottelat, 2004 * Akysis vespertinus Ng, 2008 References Category:Akysidae Category:Fish of Southeast Asia Category:Fish of Myanmar Category:Freshwater fish of China Category:Fish of Cambodia Category:Freshwater fish of India Category:Freshwater fish of Indonesia Category:Fish of Laos Category:Freshwater fish of Malaysia Category:Fish of Thailand Category:Fish of Vietnam Category:Catfish genera Category:Taxa named by Pieter Bleeker Category:Freshwater fish genera ","title":"Akysis"},{"id":"7724597","text":"Monument aux Patriotes, by Alfred Laliberté The Pied-du-Courant Prison is a prison museum in Montreal, Quebec, Canada near the Saint Lawrence River and the Jacques-Cartier Bridge.  Overview  Plans for third floor of the prison c.1838 The original plan for a prison in Montreal was designed by Quebec architect George Blaiklock in 1825 to replace the prison at Champ de Mars (built in the first decade of the 19th Century), but John Wells ultimately designed the building (after a prison in Philadelphia, likely the Eastern State Penitentiary built in 1829) that was finally opened a decade later. The building was built to house over 276 prisoners, but held over 1500 prisoners from the 1837-1838 rebellion. The prison operated from 1836 to 1912 as a city prison in Montreal and housed prisoners and hangings following the Lower Canada Rebellion in 1838. Picture of main prison wing The prison was replaced by Bordeaux Prison and was vacant from 1912 to 1921. In 1921 it was acquired by and became the headquarters of the Société des alcools du Québec, the provincial-owned liquor board in Quebec. The main prison building was altered with the Gable roof on the front of centre block removed, a fourth floor added (replacing roofing) and new wing added to the rear (by SAQ). The west wall in the front was demolished leaving the gate and east wall intact. Prisoners being hanged at front of prison, 1839 It saw the incarceration and execution by hanging of several Patriotes who had fought the Lower Canada Rebellion. Because of this, it also houses a museum on the history of the Patriotes and a gathering is usually held there on National Patriote Day. Upon the front of its site is found the Monument aux Patriotes by sculptor Alfred Laliberté. The whole of Pierre Falardeau's film February 15, 1839 happens at the Prison.  Monument aux Patriotes  The monument is located in the Place of the Patriots, which is in front of the Société des alcools du Québec offices and the site of the old Pied-du-Courant Prison. The work of Alfred Laliberté, the Monument aux Patriotes was unveiled on June 24, 1926.

He was born in Kaskaskia, Illinois in 1773, the son of Philippe- François de Rastel de Rocheblave, and moved to Montreal with his family after the American Revolution. Like his father, he entered the fur trade and he worked for his father at Detroit. He helped found the XY Company in 1798 and looked after the Athabasca department as a wintering partner. He was put in charge of the Red River department after the company merged with the North West Company in 1804; he was later put in charge of the Athabasca and then Pic departments. In 1811, he was named manager for the new South West Fur Company. During the War of 1812, he was named captain of the Corps of Canadian Voyageurs and served as major in the militia after the war.

It was later improved upon by Nawab Wajid Ali Shah, the last native ruler of Oudh, during the first half of the 19th century, who used it as his summer villa. The garden has a small pavilion in the middle, which was likely the scene of innumerable performances of the Ras-lilas, and Kathak dances, music and poetic 'mehfils' and other cultural activities which the last Nawab had a great appreciation for, indeed possibly too great a one as history has judged him to have been over-fond of his leisure interests.

From Edward Hawkshaw's Album of Indian Photographs, titled: \\"1883 Secundra Gate, Lucknow\\" \\"The 93rd Highlanders storming the Secundra Bagh\\" National Army Museum, London (NAM 1987-06-12) During the Indian Rebellion, the Sikander Bagh was used as one of many strongholds of sepoy mutineers during their siege of the British Residency in Lucknow. It stood in the way of the Commander-in-Chief Sir Colin Campbell's planned route to relieve the besieged Residency. On the morning of 16 November 1857, whilst passing by its eastern side in a southerly direction, in a sunken lane, the British force was surprised and stopped in its tracks by overwhelmingly heavy fire coming from the Sikander Bagh. A staff officer remarked to a comrade \\"If these fellows allow one of us to get out of this cul-de-sac alive, they deserve every one of them to be hanged\\".Remark quoted in Blackwood's Magazine, (quoted in Kaye & Malleson, vol.4, p.128/9) The cavalry were jammed together, unable to advance, and the high banks on either side seemed to offer an impassable barrier to artillery. However Blunt of the Bengal Horse Artillery led his troop and \\"conquering the impossible\\",The narrative in this passage follows Kaye & Malleson, p128 brought them with their guns into an open space to the east of the Sikandar Bagh, galloping through enemy fire. Here he unlimbered with remarkable coolness and self-possession. The six guns opened fire on the Sikandar Bagh. Sappers and miners demolished part of the earth banks which allowing two 18-pounder heavy guns of Travers's battery of the Artillery Brigade to be brought up out of the lane.Kaye & Malleson, 1889, p.121 After half an hour of bombardment from a range of only , an aperture was created in the south-east angle of the wall in a bricked-up doorway, \\"an ugly blind hole\\", about square and off the ground. Although only large enough to admit a single man with difficulty it was immediately rushed under heavy fire by some of the 93rd Highlanders and some men of the 4th Punjab Infantry (4th P.I.) under Lieutenant McQueen, 14 managing to enter the Sikaddar Bagh. At the same time the rest of the 4th P.I. under Lieutenant Paul assaulted the gateway. The gate was in the process of being closed by the mutineers, when Subadar Mukarab Khan, 4th P.I., a Pathan of Bajaur, one of the leading men of the attack, thrust his left arm and shield between its folds, thus preventing it being shut and barred. Though his left arm was wounded, he still managed to keep his shield between the folds by holding it with his right hand until the door was forced. This took place whilst Lt. McQueen's party and some of the Highlanders, who had entered by the breach, came from the rear of the many defenders of the gateway. After a long hand-to-hand struggle the British forced their way in greater numbers into the Sikandar Bagh through the gate, and through the breach which had been enlarged by the sappers. Slowly forced back, the main body of about 2,000 mutineers took refuge in a large 2-storied building and the high-walled enclosure behind it. The 2 doors to the enclosure were assaulted by the 4th P.I. Lt. McQueen led the assault against the right gate, and Lt. Willoughby tackled the left. The defenders had expected an attack from the opposite quarter and had bricked up the door to their rear and in doing so blocked their retreat. After a long struggle they were all slain, no quarter being given.13th Frontier Force Regimental History, 2005, pp.20-21 With cries such as \\"Cawnpore! You bloody murderers\\", it was clear that the British attackers blamed these mutineers for the slaughter of European civilians earlier in the Mutiny, including women and children, particularly during the Siege of Cawnpore, which caused outrage throughout British India and in Britain.Trotter, Lionel James. The History of the British Empire in India, 1844-1862, chap. 7: \\"The rebels died hard by the hands of men still maddened with the fearful memories of Cawnpore\\" Lord Roberts who witnessed the assault later recalled: \\"'Inch by inch they were forced back to the pavilion, and into the space between it and the north wall, where they were all shot or bayoneted. There they lay in a heap as high as my head, a heaving, surging mass of dead and dying inextricably entangled. It was a sickening site, one of those which even in the excitement of battle and the flush of victory, make one feel strongly what a horrible side there is to war. The wounded men could not get clear of their dead comrades, however great their struggles, and those near the top of this ghastly pile vented their rage and determination on every British officer who approached, by showering upon him abuse of the foulest description\\".Field Marshal Lord Roberts, Years in India 1897, page 182. Those killed or wounded during the assault included 9 officers and 90 men of the 93rd Highlanders, and 3 officers and 69 men from the 4th Punjabi Infantry.Regimental History, 2005, p.21 Diagram of assault Storming of Sikandar Bagh, 16 November 1857 Key:After diagram in Regimental History, 2005, p.22/23 (1) Position of 18-pounder guns; (2) Breach made in wall; (3) Gateway; (4) Bastion stormed from inside by 4th.

The 4th Punjab Infantry remained quartered in the Sikandar Bagh until Lucknow was evacuated by the British 11 days later on 27 November, while the Commander-in-Chief and his staff occupied a site to the west of the gate, under the south wall, from 18 to 22 November.Regimental History, 2005,pp.21,22/23 In early 1858 Felice Beato photographed the Sikandar Bagh, showing skeletal remains strewn across the grounds of the interior. These were apparently disinterred or rearranged to heighten the photograph's dramatic impact. Victoria Crosses awarded It is said that more Victoria Crosses were awarded for that single day than ever, many for the assault on the Sikandar Bagh. The recipients were as follows: ;53rd Regiment of Foot * Private Charles Irwin - among the first to enter, elected by privates * Private James Kenny - bravery and bringing up ammunition under fire, elected by privates * Lieutenant Alfred Ffrench - one of the first to enter the building, elected by officers ;90th Regiment of Foot Sgt Samuel Hill and Major John Guise - for going to the aid of wounded, elected by the regiment ;93rd Regiment of Foot (Sutherland Highlanders) *Captain William Stewart - elected by the officers *Colour Sergeant James Munro - for rescuing Captain Walsh *Sergeant David Mackay - elected by the privates *Sergeant John Paton - elected by the NCOs in the regiment *Lance Corporal John Dunlay *Private Peter Grant - ;1st Madras (European) Fusiliers *Private John Smith ;1st Bengal (European) Fusiliers *Lieutenant Francis Brown - for assisting a wounded soldier ;HMS Shannons Naval Brigade *Lieutenant Nowell Salmon *Lieutenant Lieut Thomas Young - for, with William Hall, keeping their battery of guns firing after the other gun crews were casualties *Leading Seaman John Harrison *Foretop Captain William Hall *Able Seaman Edward Robinson Memorials of the assault Articles such as cannonball, swords and shields, parts of muskets and rifles, dug out of the garden over the years are now displayed in the NBRI Exhibition and scars from cannonball on the old walls of the garden still bear witness to the event. Another visible reminder of the battle is the statue, erected some years ago in the old campus of the garden, of Uda Devi, a Pasi (a Dalit community) lady, who fought side by side with the besieged mutineers. Attired in male battle dress, she had perched herself atop a tree in the garden, gun in hand, and kept the British attackers at bay until her ammunition was exhausted, upon which she dropped dead to the ground, her body riddled with bullets. As far as the legend goes Uda Devi was one of the female bodyguards of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah. She was fiercely dedicated. Trained in martial Arts and espionage she also learned the art of guerrilla warfare and fought with her gun till the last bullet. The British were also surprised and stunned by her marksmanship until she was spotted by the soldiers, who fired relentlessly at her till she died from her wounds.

Games of Giò Leonardo, including those against Ruy López de Segura, are recorded in the Codexes of Polerio. The first published mention of Polerio is from 1634 in Il Puttino by Alessandro Salvio.SALVIO NAPOLITANO, DOTTOR ALESSANDRO: IL PVTTINO Altramente detto, IL CAVALIERO ERRANTE DEL SALVIO , Sopra il gioco de'Scacchi, con la sua Apologia contra il Carrera, diuiso in tre Libri.

According to Salvio, Polerio accompanied Giovanni Leonardo on his way to Madrid until Genoa.Salvio/Walker: \\"After prolonging his visit yet a few days, the Puttino then sailed for Spain, with Giulio Cesare da Lanciano, but passing Naples by the way, halted for a short space of time at Genoa. ... So Leonardo departed for Marseilles, leaving his friend and follower, Giulio Cesare, at Genoa, as a medium of correspondence with his secretly betrothed bride.\\" http://mark_weeks.tripod.com/chw04c15/chw04c15.htm After returning to Rome around 1584,Sanvito 2005 Polerio became a chess player and writer in ordinary of Giacomo Boncompagni,in terms of the hand of Polerio: \\"Dedica a Iacomo Buoncompagno\\" (Codice Vaticano Boncompagni Ludovisi 3) see Baffioni, Lanciano, 1993 Duke of Sora and son of Pope Gregory XIII (born Ugo Boncompagni). Polerio wrote a number of codexes in which a lively international chess dialogue is described involving the exchange of ideas among players in Italy, Portugal, and Spain. In these codexes, besides new ideas regarding chess openings, Polerio describes some of his own matches. In Il Puttino, Salvio mentions that, starting in 1606 from \\"Città di Piazza\\", \\"Geronimo Cascio, on his way to Rome, beat Giulio Cesare (Polerio), companion of Il Puttino, the best in Rome,recalling the dates of life of Giovanni Leonardo, the sentence could mean that Salvio considered Polerio as the best player of Rome in 1606–07 in the house/court of his Excellence Giacomo Boncompagni, Duke of Sora.\\"see also Baffioni, 1993 (p. 12) The Codexes of Giulio Cesare Polerio The first systematic investigation of the Codexes of Polerio was published by Antonius van der Linde in 1874.in Das Schachspiel des XVI. Jahrhunderts. Nach unedirten Quellen bearbeitet, Verlag von Julius Springer, Berlin 1874 The subject of the investigations by Van der Linde can be found at the Bibliotheca Van der Linde- Niemeijeriana, part of the Koninklijke Bibliotheek, National Library of the Netherlands. The current systematics of the Codexes of Polerio has been performed and published by Alessandro Sanvito in 2005.SANVITO, ALESSANDRO: I codici scacchistici di Giulio Cesare Polerio e Gioacchino Greco, Messaggerie Scacchistiche, , Brescia, 2005 Impact of Polerio on chess history and theory (before 1874) The systematic organisation of overall seven Codexes, described and called A-G by Van der Linde, and attributed to Polerio in 1874, had major impact on the further description of chess history, and history of chess theory. A relevant part of the work of Van der Linde was to compare Codexes of Polerio and Gioacchino Greco even superfine. According to this investigation, most of the analytic work of Polerio was mediated outside of Italy, up to 1874, via Gioacchino Greco. More recent work by Peter J. Monté compiling game scores from all sixteenth and seventeenth century manuscripts reveals where Greco copied Polerio and where he carried the games further.Monté 2014, pp.439-530 Impact of Polerio on chess terminology (after 1874) =Polerio Gambit= On p. 186 of \\"Das Schachspiel des XVI. Jahrhunderts\\" van der Linde wrote in 1874: \\"D. Polerio-Gambit 224 1\\\\. e2-e4 e7-e5 2\\\\. f2-f4 e5-f4: 3\\\\. Sg1-f3 g7-g5 4\\\\. Lf1-c4 g5-g4 5\\\\. 0-0! g4-f3: 6\\\\. Dd1-f3: e cosi ancor che habbia perso un pezzo resta con buonissima postura di poter uencere il gioco sapendo guidarlo à presso, il che sarebbe superfluo inogni modo se si uolesse mostrare la fine di tutti giochi, e per questo basta insino à un certo che, tanto che si conosca apartemente il uantagio del gioco, si come per la postura di dette giochi ogni giudicioso giocatore lo potrà facilmente cognoscere.\\"reference made to C, Nr. 12 = nowadays 3 in Sanvito 2005, as well as \\"12. Gambitto.\\" p. 87–88 in Baffioni 1993) ... in modern terms: \\"Polerio Gambit: 1. e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4.Bc4 g4 5.0-0! gxf3 6.Qxf3 +/−\\" Exactly this move order was also found later even in a second Polerio Codex discovered and described by J.A. Leon in 1894.(10,- (224)) or 6 according to Sanvito 2005. Of note is that the position after 1.e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3.Nf3 g5 4.Bc4 g4 5.0-0 gxf3 6.Qxf3 may be considered by most recent grandmasters as a forced win for White – provided that 5.0-0 would mean \\"free castling\\", i.e. bringing the White King from e1 to h1. Actually, Polerio did claim 5.0-0 gxf3 6.Qxf3 to be favourable for White although the white king of Polerio did stand, after 5.0-0, on h1 but not on g1 (i.e. castling as defined in our days). However, in 1874, the move order 1.e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3.Nf3 g5 4.Bc4 g4 5.0-0!The exclamation mark summarizes the general view on the move in about 1874, or 19th century in general. was already occupied by the term \\"Muzio Gambit\\". This term derives from a translation of a work of Alessandro Salvio, supposedly the third book of the reprint of 1723, by Sarrat in 1813.The works of Damiano, Ruy-Lopez, and Salvio on the game of chess, by J. H. Sarratt, Damiano, Ruy López de Sigura, Alessandro Salvio, Printed for T. Boosey, 1813 Original von Oxford University On page 209 Jacob Henry Sarratt (translated) and wrote: \\"SALVIO states that the following Gambit was sent to him by Signor Muzio, ...\\"of note is that Sarrat on is reporting page 359 of the work of 1813 on several games from a treatises published 1769, all with \\"5. K to Rook's square\\". These games compare very well with those reported on p. 217 ff. of the work of the Opera d'Autore Modenese in 1769. Actually, Alessandro Salvio never stated this. Rather, in the third book of the Il Puttino he wrote that Signor MutioMuzio is a revision of the spelling occurring in the reprint of 1723 d'Alessandro did see that Geronimo Cascio did play the move order (with free castling, also called \\"Italian method\\" of castlingref. for the usage of the term \\"Italian method of castling\\"). With p. 165,linked is actually the version of 1828, which is, however, nearly identical with the version of 1821, compare also the living dates of Jacob Sarratt vol. 2, of the 1821 edition of A New Treatise of the Game of Chess the term Muzio Gambit was coined by Jacob Henry Sarratt. And with the latter work of Sarrat, in 1821 the modern theory of the \\"Muzio Gambit\\" with castling according modern rules started – an idea and a position already Polerio analysed in 1579/80. Thus, Antonius van der Linde, changed the view on the historical development of the move order 1.e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3.Nf3 g5 4.Bc4 g4 5.0-0 in 1874, most notably in the last editions of the Handbuch. Thereafter, a trend can be seen to call this move order either with hyphenated terms such as Muzio–Polerio, Polerio–Muzio, or simply Polerio Gambit. Such a terminology is both in honour of Giulio Cesare Polerio and partially misleading since the major body of the theory of this opening was generated in the time span in- between 1821 and 1874. The number of games played by Adolf Anderssen, Paul Morphy, and Wilhelm Steinitzsee e.g Steinitz vs. Anderssen, 1862 with 1.e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3.Nf3 g5 4.Bc4 g4 5.0-0 or 5.d4 in the time span 1821–1874 was already rather high. The rules for Chess opening nomenclature, and their historical development, should be taken into account while assessing van der Linde's claim of 1874 \\"D. Polerio-Gambit\\". =\\"Polerio Gambits and Variations\\"= In 1874, Van der Linde suggested as well (p. 188) to rename the move order 1.e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3.Nf3 g5 4.Bc4 Bg7 5.h4 h6 6.d4 d6 7.Nc3 c6 8.hxg5 hxg5 9.Rxh8 Bxh8 10.Ne5!? into \\"Polerio's second Gambit\\". This suggestion is based on the observation that \\"im Handbuch (1864, S.. 366, § 3)\\" this move order is called \\"das Gambit des Calabresen\\". This is a rather interesting observation since in the \\"Handbuch\\" in its 2nd edition as of 1852, on p. 205 it is mentioned that the move order 1.e4 e5 2.Bc4 f5 can be found \\"at the Calabrese\\". That's a rather wise wording since both 1.e4 e5 2.Bc4 f5 and 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 f5, according to Codexes of Polerio, occurred in games of \\"Gio. Leonardo\\" (games 236–238, p. 190 in van der Linde). Both Giovanni Leonardo and Gioacchino Greco were from Calabria, the first from Cutro, the second from Celico. Notes  References  * Polerio (G. C.).

For many decades the state underwent bitter political violence. Government West Bengal is governed through a parliamentary system of representative democracy, a feature the state shares with other Indian states. Universal suffrage is granted to residents. There are two branches of government. The legislature, the West Bengal Legislative Assembly, consists of elected members and special office bearers such as the Speaker and Deputy Speaker, who are elected by the members. Assembly meetings are presided over by the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker in the Speaker's absence. The judiciary is composed of the Calcutta High Court and a system of lower courts. Executive authority is vested in the Council of Ministers headed by the Chief Minister although the titular head of government is the Governor. The Governor is the head of state appointed by the President of India. The leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the Legislative Assembly is appointed as the Chief Minister by the Governor, and the Council of Ministers are appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Chief Minister. The Council of Ministers reports to the Legislative Assembly. The Assembly is unicameral with 295 Members of the Legislative Assembly, or MLAs, including one nominated from the Anglo-Indian community. Terms of office run for five years, unless the Assembly is dissolved prior to the completion of the term. Auxiliary authorities known as panchayats, for which local body elections are regularly held, govern local affairs. The state contributes 42 seats to the Lok Sabha and 16 seats to the Rajya Sabha of the Indian Parliament.  History  The area's early history featured a succession of Indian empires, internal squabbling, and a tussle between Hinduism and Buddhism for dominance. Ancient Bengal was the site of several major Janapadas (kingdoms), while the earliest cities date back to the Vedic period. The region was part of several ancient pan-Indian empires, including the Mauryans and Guptas. It was also a bastion of regional kingdoms. The citadel of Gauda served as the capital of the Gauda Kingdom, the Buddhist Pala Empire (eighth to 11th century) and Hindu Sena Empire (11th–12th century). From the 13thcentury onward, the region was ruled by several sultans, powerful Hindu states, and Baro-Bhuyan landlords, until the beginning of British rule in the 18thcentury. The British East India Company cemented their hold on the region following the Battle of Plassey in 1757, and Calcutta served for many years as the capital of British India. The early and prolonged exposure to British administration resulted in an expansion of Western education, culminating in developments in science, institutional education, and social reforms in the region, including what became known as the Bengali Renaissance. A hotbed of the Indian independence movement through the early 20thcentury, Bengal was divided during India's independence in 1947 along religious lines into two separate entities: West Bengal, a state of India, and East Bengal, a province of Pakistan which later became independent Bangladesh. Congress rule (1947–1962) =Princely state merge with West Bengal= In 1950, the Princely State of Koch Bihar merged with West Bengal after King Jagaddipendra Narayan had signed the Instrument of Accession with India.Dr. Sailen Debnath, ed. Social and Political Tensions In North Bengal since 1947, . In 1955, the former French enclave of Chandannagar, which had passed into Indian control after 1950, was integrated into West Bengal. Portions of Bihar were subsequently merged with West Bengal. During Roy's Chief Minister-ship very few manufacturing industries were set up in the state. In 1954, when Dr. B. C. Roy was the Congress chief minister, a massive food crisis overtook the state. There was a near-famine condition in Bengal. United Front (1967–1969) After the state legislative elections held in 1967, the CPI(M) was the main force behind the United Front government formed. The Chief Ministership was given to Ajoy Mukherjee of the Bangla Congress. =Naxalbari uprising= In 1967 a peasant uprising broke out in Naxalbari, in northern West Bengal. The insurgency was led by hardline district-level CPI(M) leaders Charu Majumdar and Kanu Sanyal. The Naxalbari movement was violently repressed by the West Bengal government. During the 1970s and 1980s, severe power shortages, strikes and a violent Marxist-Naxalite movement damaged much of the state's infrastructure, leading to a period of economic stagnation. The Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971 resulted in the influx of millions of refugees to West Bengal, causing significant strains on its infrastructure. The 1974 smallpox epidemic killed thousands. West Bengal politics underwent a major change when the Left Front won the 1977 assembly election, defeating the incumbent Indian National Congress. The Left Front, led by Communist Party of India (Marxist), has governed for the state for the subsequent three decades. =1969 Assembly election= Fresh elections were held in West Bengal in 1969. CPI(M) emerged as the largest party in the West Bengal legislative assembly.Indian National Congress had won 55 seats, Bangla Congress 33 and CPI 30. CPI(M) allies also won several seats.ECI: Statistical Report on the 1969 West Bengal Legislative Election But with the active support of CPI and the Bangla Congress, Ajoy Mukherjee was returned as Chief Minister of the state. Mukherjee resigned on March 16, 1970 and the state was put under President's Rule. Congress rule (1972–1977) Indian National Congress won the 1972 assembly election, and its leader Siddhartha Shankar Ray became the chief minister. During this period, the then Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi proclaimed nationwide Emergency in 1975. This period was marked by large scale violence as the police force battled with the naxalites and ultimately crushed the movement in the state. Left Front rule (1977–2011) In the 1977 election of the state legislature, the Left Front, headed by Communist Party of India (Marxist), won 243 seats thereby gaining a majority. The first Left Front government was established with Jyoti Basu as the Chief Minister. =Major incidents= 1979 Marichjhanpi Massacre The massacre in Marichjhanpi, which took place under CPI(M) rule in Bengal between January 26 and May 16, 1979, relates to the forcible eviction of refugees who had fled from East Pakistan thereby leading to the death of a sizable population among them. After leading the Left Front government for consecutive five terms, Jyoti Basu retired from active politics and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was appointed as his successor. Five years later, the Left Front came back to the power with Bhattacharjee again assuming the office of the Chief Minister. The state's economic recovery gathered momentum after economic reforms in India were introduced in the early 1990s by the central government, aided by election of a new reformist Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya in 2000. As of 2007, armed activists have been organizing terrorist attacks in some parts of the state, while clashes with the administration have taken place at several sensitive places on the issue of industrial land acquisition. Singur Tata Nano controversy Nandigram violence The Nandigram violence was an incident in Nandigram, West Bengal where, on the orders of the Left Front government, more than 4,000 heavily armed police stormed the Nandigram area with the aim of stamping out protests against the West Bengal government's plans to expropriate of land for a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) to be developed by the Indonesian-based Salim Group. The police shot dead at least 14 villagers and wounded 70 more. The SEZ controversy started when the government of West Bengal decided that the Salim Group of IndonesiaFor more information on the Salim Group please see Sudono SalimAsia WeekFar Easter Economic Review October 1998 would set up a chemical hub under the SEZ policy at Nandigram, a rural area in the district of Purba Medinipur. The villagers took over the administration of the area and all the roads to the villages were cut off.

It is a subsidiary of the Go South Coast sector of the Go-Ahead Group. History Preserved Solent Blue Line branded Bristol VR Solent Blue Line branded Wright Cadet bodied DAF SB120 in May 2008 Solent Blue Line was formed by Southern Vectis in May 1987 to compete with Southampton Citybus on some of its major routes with some Bristol VRTs. In October 1987 Solent Blue Line purchased the Hants & SussexCompanies House extract company no 3203900 Hants & Sussex Omnibus Limited business from Basil Williams and the Eastleigh and Southampton routes which had previously been part of Hants & Dorset, from Stagecoach in Hampshire. This expanded the fleet from 16 to 115 buses. New buses began to be purchased with Leyland Olympians for the Southampton to Winchester service and minibuses for the Eastleigh to Winchester service. Some services were operated under franchise by Brijan Tours and Marchwood Motorways. From here the network expanded until in 2003 the network underwent a change, involving a new name and the launch of the Bluestar brand soon after, as a name for their premier services (Please Note: due to archiving problems, the text is white and therefore not visible without highlighting the text) with Bluestar services one and two launching in 2004, the three and four service launching a year later and the Waterside services eight and nine having fully launched by 2006. In July 2005 Solent Blue Line was included in the sale of Southern Vectis to the Go-Ahead GroupRecommended Cash for Southern Vectis plc Go-Ahead Group 11 July 2005 and subsequently the head office functions of the company were consolidated with those of the other Go South Coast companies, Southern Vectis and Wilts & Dorset, in Poole.

The fleet has recently undergone several updates, including the introduction of a smartcard system called the key, the introduction of free Wi-Fi internet to all buses, and USB charging points. In June 2017, all Bluestar and Unilink buses accept contactless payment, as part of a £1.6m investment from Hampshire County Council. Bluestar has also been one of the test sites for new air filter technology which removes and captures particulates from the atmosphere.https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/27/uks-first-air- filtering-bus-launches-in-southampton A test has been done in September 2018 for 100 days and has claimed to have cleaned 3.2 million cubic metres. It is planned that these will be fitted onto buses nationwide on Go Ahead's buses.https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/jan/24/air-filtering-bus-to- launch-across-six-regions-in-the-uk To accompany this, they have also installed solar panels onto the roof of the test bus to see if the filter can be made to run on its own power. 16 more buses have been installed with solar panels to reduce maintenance costs and fuel consumption. There are 6 buses with the air filter, including the original with the prototype air filter installed on ADL Enviro200 MMC types, wearing the Bluestar \\"breathe\\" branding. Brands Mercedes-Benz Citaro in Bluestar livery in April 2010 The company itself holds the original name of Solent Blue Line, however none of the buses it operates use this branding, the last few buses using this branding was incorporated into the Bluestar network in 2008. As a result, a number of sub brands are used for the bus services. =Bluestar= Bluestar was originally launched in 2004 running the main routes with destinations outside of Southampton. However, since 2008 the service has become the main brand for the company. The vast majority of these services terminate in Southampton, with the exception of services 7 (Lordshill to Sholing via City Centre), 17 (Adanac Park to Weston via City Centre) and 18 (Millbrook to Thornhill via City Centre) which go through the city, and service 5 (Boyatt Wood - Eastleigh - North Baddesley - Romsey) thus not going near the city centre. In addition to these services, Services 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12 and 16 also operate under the Bluestar brand. =QuayConnect= QuayConnect bus at the Red Funnel terminal, Town Quay The QuayConnect shuttle service runs a service around the city of Southampton, stopping at Southampton Central railway station, Westquay Shopping Centre and Town Quay, for the Hythe Ferry and the Red Funnel ferries to the Isle of Wight. The service was started as City-Link, under the previous operator, Enterprise, but the operation was taken over by Bluestar on 28 September 2008. The first two buses used on the service were Dennis Darts inherited from Enterprise, and were repainted in a new two-tone blue livery with the interiors re branded. In May 2016 the service was re-branded as QuayConnect with a new red and white livery featuring the newest Red Jet which came into service for Red Funnel shortly after. Originally the service was free to use for all passengers, but a change in May 2014 saw fares introduced for all except Red Funnel ticket holders. The frequency of the service was also cut down to every 30 minutes, but with a duplicate bus running on some morning services and a 15-minute frequency between 4-7pm, or when local events take place in Southampton or the Isle of Wight, such as Cowes Week or Bestival. The service was upgraded with an ADL Enviro400 City in November 2018, replacing the original East Lancs Myllennium Dart. =Unilink= The Unilink service is run under contract by Bluestar, on behalf of the University of Southampton. The contract was extended for a further ten years in December 2017 and the company ordered 32 new buses for the Unilink fleet. =New Forest Tour= Solent Blue Line 908 The New Forest Tour is a circular open-top bus service running around the New Forest, between Lyndhurst, Brockenhurst, Lymington, Beaulieu and Exbury. It commenced in 2004, using distinctively branded yellow and orange Bristol VRs (in the same livery as the old Southern Vectis open-top services). The service was reversed in 2005, to run in the opposite direction. For the 2006 season, two low-floor East Lancs Myllennium bodied Volvo B7TLs from Wilts & Dorset were used, retaining the Wilts & Dorset livery but with \\"New Forest Tour\\" vinyls added. In 2007 the buses passed to Solent Blue Line and were repainted in a new green and orange livery, with ponies on the side. Again, this is similar to the Southern Vectis livery which that company uses on their open-top buses. Past brands =Baby Bluestar= Optare Solo in Baby Bluestar livery in May 2008 Between 2008 and 2010, Bluestar used Baby Bluestar branding for their local services. There have been twelve Baby Bluestar services, of which the H1, H2, T3 and T4 all still run, albeit under the Bluestar name. Five of the other services have since been dropped and reverted to the normal Bluestar services. =Nightstar= The Nightstar services used to run on Friday and Saturday nights and were aimed at people who had a night out in Southampton. All services began at Leisure World, Southampton and made their way past other large clubs before completing its route. These routes generally followed those of their daytime number counterparts with additional stops to take into account destinations served by other routes. In January 2013, all but the Unilink U1N ceased to run due to council funding cuts. =Red Rocket= Plaxton Pointer bodied Dennis Dart in Red Rocket colours with a subsequently added Baby Bluestar logo in August 2008 Red Rocket was launched on 3 September 2006 as a high frequency network centred on Eastleigh, extending to Winchester in the north and Hamble-le-Rice in the south. Red Rocket services were either withdrawn or re-branded to Baby Bluestar on 24 February 2008, to enable Solent Blue Line to trade under the Bluestar name. There were originally eight Red Rocket routes, lettered to avoid confusion with the Bluestar and Solent Blue Line service in operation at the time. =Solent Shuttle= East Lancs E Type bodied Volvo Olympian in Solent Shuttle livery in November 2008 The Solent Shuttle was an express bus link that ran between Portsmouth and Southampton. The service itself was established in 1976 as a joint venture between Hants & Dorset and Southdown Motor Services, between passing on to other operators including Southampton City Bus, First Hampshire & Dorset and Tellings-Golden Miller; First branded the services as the 727 and the 747 while Tellings-Golden Miller branded it the Solent Clipper, under the service names the X27 and the X47. Solent Blue Line took over the service, but ran into difficulties following the cessation of funding from Portsmouth and Southampton City Councils. The service was due to close on 2 June 2007, but by popular demand and with the support of pensioners associations in both cities, the service continued on a two-hourly basis. However, the service ceased two years later on 21 February 2009. =Beep Bus= Northern Counties Palatine bodied Volvo Olympian in Beep! Bus livery in September 2008 The Beep! Bus service operated between Eastleigh, Boyatt Wood, Velmore and Southampton between 8 October 2008 and February 2009. The service operated in direct competition with the rival Velvet B service operating on the same route and timetabled three minutes behind those of the Beep bus. Initially the service was registered with VOSA as a Wilts & Dorset route to begin on 15 September 2008, but this was later cancelled and replaced with an identical Bluestar registration. The service began a full week before its registration date to match the start date of Velvet's service, but was unable to take fares and so operated as a free service until their start date a week later. Normal fares were slightly lower than Velvet's on some journeys but local journeys were more expensive. Bluestar operations director Andrew Wickham said that the decision was \\"a business decision pure and simple\\", adding that they \\"are not scared of competition\\" but Velvet were \\"deliberately creaming off\\" some of their passengers. The rival Velvet service ended on 10 January 2009 because of low passenger numbers. Soon after, Bluestar announced their intention to withdraw Beep! Bus from February 2009, ironically one year after they withdrew the Red Rocket B service. =Do the Docks= ECW bodied Bristol VRT in 'Do the Docks' livery in June 2007 The 'Do the Docks' tour was an open-top bus tour of Southampton docks, using open-top buses from the New Forest Tour and a debranded Wilts & Dorset Leyland Olympian. The service changed on 29 July 2007 as a result of low passenger numbers following poor weather during the 2007 summer season, with the service losing its \\"turn up and hop on\\" format and becoming a chartered service.Docks Tour - Service changes The route saw a brief reprieve in April 2008, when the service ran for two days on 26 and 27 of that month, as part of the Caribbean festival in Southampton. As Solent Blue Line no longer had the open-top buses for the routes, a hired Southern Vectis open-top bus was used. Incidents and investigation Plaxton Pointer bodied Dennis Dart in November 2008 In March 2007 whilst being used as a rail-replacement bus a double-decker member of the Red Rocket fleet drove under a low bridge at Barnham causing the top to be ripped off, in addition to minor damage to the bridge. It is now with Southern Vectis as an open-topper. A similar incident occurred at Romsey in May 2015, when a double-decker bus had its roof removed after colliding with a railway bridge In July 2009, the MP for Eastleigh Chris Huhne asked for an investigation into allegations of anti-competitive behaviour of Bluestar against Velvet's over their implementation and subsequent removal of extra services, which operated between Eastleigh and Fair Oak, to rival Velvet's service, the Fair Oak Flyer. In the early hours of 22 March 2011, a car drove into the front right of a Bluestar bus on route 2 between Southampton and Fair Oak, resulting in a single fatality of the car driver, and injuries to the car passenger, the bus driver was treated for shock. Only one passenger of the 10 on board the bus were treated for minor injuries. At around 16:30 on 7 February 2012, a Marchwood Motorways Mercedes-Benz Citaro caught fire on Calmore Roundabout, Totton. The bus was being driven Not In Service by a mechanic at the time - there were no injuries but the bus was destroyed. A similar incident occurred on 9 October 2020 at around 17:30 with an East Lancs Omnidekka bodied Scania N94UD on the M27, heading towards Fareham. The smoke from the fire could be seen from as far as the Isle of Wight. On 3 April 2012, two buses on service 18 collided at the junction of Little Lances Hill and Peartree Avenue in Bitterne. The leading bus had to brake sharply to avoid another vehicle and the second bus ran into the back of it. Three passengers were slightly injured.

It was translated from a Latin text and is the longest of Cynewulf's four signed poems. It is the last of six poems appearing in the Vercelli manuscript, which also contains The Fates of the Apostles, Andreas, Soul and Body I, the Homiletic Fragment I and Dream of the Rood. The poem is the first English account of the finding of the Holy Cross by Saint Helena, the mother of Emperor Constantine. The poem was written by Cynewulf some time between 750 and the tenth century. It is written in a West Saxon dialect, but certain Anglianisms and metrical evidence concerning false rhymes suggest it was written in an Anglian rather than Saxon dialect. It is 1,321 lines long.  Cynewulf  Cynewulf's signature, which is always in runes, appears on Christ II, Juliana, The Fates of the Apostles and Elene. The dialect in his poems suggests that he was either Mercian or Northumbrian. He was probably most active around the late 8th and early 9th centuries, though there is other research to support that he was active between the late 9th and late 10th centuries. Cynewulf's true identity is still unknown, but there have been efforts to narrow down the list of possible poets. The four most favored candidates are Cynewulf, who was the bishop of Lindisfarne in Northumbria in around 783; Cynulf, a priest (ca. 803); Cynewulf, the father of Bishop Cyuneweard of Wells, who died in 975; and Cenwulf, an abbot of Peterborough Abbey in around 1006). There is not enough evidence to support any of these claims.  Manuscript  Elene is contained in the Vercelli Book, appearing on fol. 121a-133b.  Plot summary  The story is loosely based on historical events and takes place within an anachronistic setting that amalgamates wars of the fourth-century involving the Romans, the Huns and the Franks. Elene fits into a subgenre of inventio, the search for sacrosanct relics of the saints. Cynewulf's source for the legend of St. Helena's Finding of the Cross was probably the Acta Cyriaci and a version of it is written in the Acta Sanctorum for May 4. The poem begins with Constantine, emperor of Rome, riding out to battle the Huns and Hrethgoths. He is a mighty king made strong by God, though he is not aware of the Christian God yet. He sees a vision in the sky and he is told that he will halt his enemies with the symbol that is shown to him by the heavens. The battle begins and Constantine reveals the symbol that he was shown, a cross. The cross sends his enemies running in all directions and they are easily defeated by the Romans. Constantine returns home and addresses an assembly on whether they know the meaning of the symbol that saved his people. Only the wisest know that the cross is the symbol of the Lord in Heaven, Jesus Christ. Constantine is baptized and becomes a devout Christian, due to his experience. He learns from the Bible how and where Christ was killed, so he orders Helen, his mother, to lead an army to the land of the Jews to find where the true cross is buried. She leads an army of men onto a ship and begins the journey to Israel. Once in the city of Jerusalem, she calls an assembly of sage Jews and scorns them for having condemned Jesus to death, leaving them wondering what they have done to anger the queen. Judas tells his fellow Jews that he knows the queen searches for the cross. Judas was brought up on Christian teachings, and his brother Stephen was stoned to death for being a Christian. The Jews refuse to help Helen find the cross, so she threatens them with death. Frightened, they hand over Judas. He also refuses to tell her where it is, so she locks him in a dark prison for seven days without food. On the seventh day he cries out that he cannot take the torture any longer and will reveal where the cross is. He leads the queen to the hill where Jesus was crucified. Judas converts to Christianity in a passionate speech to God acknowledging Jesus as his Savior. God gives Judas a smoke sign in the sky, which convinces him of his new-found belief. He digs and finds three crosses. A crowd forms, but no one knows which of the three was the cross of Christ. They set the crosses up in the city hoping that Christ would show them the truth. A corpse is brought forth, and each cross is held over him. The third cross brings him back to life. Satan appears in grotesque form angry that he has had a soul stolen from him. Judas cleverly argues with Satan with his new faith, but Satan leaves with a threat that he will raise up a king to retaliate. Helen sends word home to Constantine, who tells her to build a church on the hillside where the crosses were found. She encases the true cross in gold and jewels and places it in the church. Judas is baptized and puts away his false religion. He is appointed to priesthood and is renamed Cyriacus because of his rebirth. Helen then decides she needs to find the nails that held Christ up on the cross. Cyriacus searches for them, and God again gives him a sign in the form of fire to show where they are buried. Helen receives the gift with tears of joy, and the Holy Spirit fills her with the gift of wisdom and forever protects the saint. She goes to a wise man to find out how she should use the nails, and he advises her to use them in the bit of Constantine's horse so that he would always be victorious in battle. The epilogue of the poem is devoted to the personal reflection of Cynewulf and his interpretation of Doomsday. Cynewulf tells of how he has experienced a spiritual metamorphosis. His depiction of the Last Judgement resembles a sort of Purgatory where people are divided into three groups, two of which undergo cleansing to reach salvation, while the third is damned to eternal Hell.  Analysis  Helen is not the typical passive Old English heroine. She is strong and autonomous, more like the women in Old Norse literature rather than the Graeco-Roman saints. Old Norse heroines are strong, assertive, and persuade physically instead of verbally. Cynewulf purposely wanted his audience to view Helen as a strong individual. He does not include her death in the poem as the Latin version does and he does not have her submitting to Constantine and Cyriacus as she does in the Latin version. In fact it is the opposite. We see Cyriacus completely submitting himself to Helen: hæfde Ciriacus / eall gefylled swa him seo æðele bebead, / wifes willan (line 1129b), ('Cyriacus had completely done as the noble woman bade him to do, the will of the woman'). Helen can be understood as an allegory of the Christian Church and its mission to lead men to salvation through acceptance of the Cross. Literally, her mission is to find the true cross, but allegorically, her mission is to evangelize the Jews. Helen is referred to as a warrior queen and she has an army of warriors, but they never fight. The warriors are there to subjugate a powerful enemy, which could be Satan or non- believers. Judas and Helen are an allegory for the relationship of the Church with its members. Judas's dialogue reveals him to be of the human condition; he has the capacity for saintliness and wickedness. Anti-Semitism is a topic of discussion for scholars regarding the poem: Elene's oppressive tactics towards the Jewish elders are rewarded in the end.See Fulk 2003, p.99 A Marxist argument can also be made when looking at how Judas eventually submits to his oppressor. He arises from the pit as a heroic-type figure and it seems the reins of authority Elene exercises only do good in the end. It is contended that this justifies the authority of royalty in Cynewulf's time.See Klein 2006 In terms of symbolism, the good-bad dichotomy, which is prevalent in Old English verse, finds itself in the oppositions of light and dark imagery in the poem. For instance, it is observed in the poem that Judas spends seven nights in a pit, and the 'darkness' can be seen to convey his obstinacy in refusing to see the 'light' of Christianity.See Greenfield 1965, p.114 and Klein 2006 Along with alliteration, which is a key part to all Old English poetry, there are also places in the poem where Cynewulf applies rhyme in order to emphasize certain words, such as in the battle scene (50-55a): Ridon ymb rofne, ðonne rand dynede, camp wudu clynede, cyning ðreate for, herge to hilde. Hrefen uppe gol, wan ond wælfel. Werod wæs on tyhte. Hleopon hornboran, hreopan frican, mearh moldan træd.'' ('They rode about the famous one; then the shield dinned, the battle-tarp clanged, the king advanced with a troop, a battalion to the battle. The raven yelled from above, dark and greedy for carrion. The troop was on the march. The horn-bearers ran, the heralds called out, the horse trod the earth), In this example, the rhymes emphasize the din of voices and the crash of weapons, which builds excitement throughout the battle scene.

Breed According to NK News, international kennel clubs consider Pungsan dogs as \\"little more than a local Spitz-type variant of Siberian huskies, only less physically impressive and with behavioral issues\\". History During the 2000 inter-Korean summit, North Korean leader Kim Jong- il made a gift of two Pungsan dogs (associated with the North) to South Korean president Kim Dae-jung. In return, Kim Dae-jung gave two Jindo dogs (associated with the South) to Kim Jong-il.Wei Du, \\"Inter-Korean summit: What gifts will Moon Jae-in, Kim Jong Un bring for each other?\\", Channel News Asia (April 26, 2018).

They initially lived in the Blue House, the residence of the South Korean president, before being moved to the Seoul Zoo, where they gave birth to 15 puppies before both dying at age 13. During their lives, the dogs were accorded special status as guests of the state. At their Pyongyang summit in 2018, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un gave two Pungsan dogs to South Korean President Moon Jae-in. The male was named Songkang, and the female was named Gomi. Gomi gave birth to six puppies within two months afterwards, leading Moon to remark that she must have been pregnant when she was given to him.

Biography  = Youth of a revolutionary = Born to a family of a teacher and a seamstress in Suzdal, Russia, Aleksei Gastev enrolled into the Moscow Pedagogical Institute, but was expelled as a result of his participation in a revolutionary meeting. He joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1901. An active participant in the Russian Revolution of 1905, Gastev was the leader of a fighting squad in Kostroma and agitated workers to strike in the Northern Russian cities of Yaroslavl, Ivanovo-Voznesensk and Rostov. During this time, Gastev was closely associated with the Bolshevik faction of the Party. He frequently corresponded with Lenin and Krupskaya on matters of party policy in 1903-1904 and reported to Lenin on the general strike in Ivanovo-Voznesensk in 1905. As a result of his revolutionary activism, Gastev was arrested by the authorities and exiled to various parts of Northern and Eastern Russia in at least three separate incidents. He was nevertheless able to escape from his exiles each time, living illegally in Russia and usually managing to find his way abroad. In 1907 Gastev dissociated himself from the activities of the Bolshevik faction. = Industrial and trade-union work = From 1901 until 1917 Gastev divided his time between exiles, escapes and work in Russian or European factories. His experience as a factory worker led him to develop a rather practical approach to Marxism. Revolution for Gastev meant empowering workers by allowing them to control everyday matters related to work- processes. Gastev became involved in the work of the Petersburg Union of Metal Workers, one of the most influential trade-unions in Russia, in 1907. In 1908 he got work with the Vasileostovskii Trolley Depot. Here he was chosen to monitor wear and tear on the transmission belts and sprockets and analyse the repair process of the trolley cars. It was here that he first thought of developing a \\"science for the social construction of enterprises\\". =Exile= In 1910 he was again arrested but when he was sent to Siberia, he escaped to Paris, where he worked for the motor-car manufacturer Clément-Bayard. Here he first became familiar with quality assurance which was carried out in a particularly thorough fashion. By 1912 he was working for Citroën where he witnessed the application of assembly line production which André Citroën was introducing following a visit to the Ford plant in the United States. At that time, he became familiar with French Syndicalism and adopted many of the views of that movement, seeing trade unions as a chief means of confronting capitalism by bringing concrete improvements into the lives of workers. By 1913 Gastev had joined the Circle of Proletarian Culture with Anatoly Lunacharsky, Fedor Kalinin, Pavel Bessalko and Mikhail Gerasimov. 'The rehabilitation of Bogdanov' by John Biggart in Bogdanov and His Work: A Guide to the Published and Unpublished Works of Alexander A.Bogdanov (Malinovsky), 1873-1928 1998 p. 7 In 1917-1918 Gastev won election as the Chairman of the Central Committee of the newly created All-Russian Union of Metal Workers. He actively participated in the 1918 Conference of the Union. = Scientific management = A cyclogram of cutting metal with a chisel and hammer. Aleksei Gastev in the laboratory of the Central Institute of Labour In 1920, Gastev became the founder and Director of the Central Institute of Labour (C.I.T.) () in Moscow, which he referred to as his \\"last work of art\\". The organization of the Institute was encouraged by Lenin, who promised to allocate the initial funding of the project. The institution developed scientific approaches to work management, which in practical terms amounted to methods of training workers to perform mechanical operations in the most efficient way. Some simple repetitive operations, like the cutting of materials with a chisel, were studied in great detail. Recommendations on setting up the work processes efficiently were published. According to Figes (1996), Gastev \\"As the head of the Central Institute of Labor, established in 1920, he carried out experiments to train the workers so that they would end up acting like machines. Hundreds of identically dressed trainees would be marched in columns to their benches, and orders would be given out by buzzes from machines. The workers were trained to hammer correctly by holding a hammer attached to and moved by a hammering machine so that after half an hour they had internalized its mechanical rhythm. The same process was repeated for chiseling, filing, and other basic skills. Gastev's aim, by his own admission, was to turn the worker into a sort of 'human robot' (a word, not coincidently, derived from the Slavic noun robota meaning work). Since Gastev saw machines as superior to human beings, he thought this would represent an improvement in humanity.\\"Figes, Orlando, 1996, A People's Tragedy: The Russian Revolution 1891-1924. Platon Kerzhentsev criticised Gastev's Taylorist approach for adopting a \\"narrow base\\" by focusing on the worker rather than looking at the more general aspects of how production should be organised in a socialist society. In 1921 the Central Council of Scientific Organization of Labor (SOVNOT) was set up with both factions involved. In 1924 the All-Russian Scientific Management Conference was held in Moscow, where both Gastev and Kerzhentsev argued their case. The conference came down on Gastev's side, although Kerzhentsev argued that the CIT had wasted three years. =Ustanovka= In 1928, in an effort to increase the funding of the CIT, Gastev organized the Ustanovka (\\"Setup\\") as a social enterprise (joint-stock company) which audited the work of industrial enterprises and provided recommendations on efficient organization of their work processes on a commercial basis. Here Gastev applied his ideas on education, based on his concept of \\"social engineering\\", meaning the creation of training methods based on the physiological and psychological study of humans in the work process, using both observational and experimental methods. This led to the creation of the \\"setup method\\" (установочный метод), which viewed the conditioning of human faculties as a basis for reform of the educational system in its entirety. The term \\"setup\\" (установка) implied the formation of personal automated behaviors through \\"biological setups\\", \\"cultural setups\\", etc. Gastev's methods were used in intensive trainings of qualified workers and were highly successful. = Poetry = Gastev's Poeziia rabochego udara, (Poetry of the worker's blow), was the first book published by Proletkult in 1918. Most of Gastev's poems may be fairly labeled prose poetry. The rhythm is usually not organized enough to qualify for verse, the rhyme is absent, the poems are written in the form of prose pieces. However, the use of metaphor, lyrical expressiveness, and repetitiveness of syntax undoubtedly make Gastev a true lyrical poet, with influences ranging from Verhaeren and Walt Whitman to the Russian Futurists. Gastev's poetry energetically celebrates industrialization, announcing an era of a new type of human, trained by the overall mechanization of everyday life. In the 1920s Gastev abandoned his literary work completely, dedicating himself to his scientific management research. However, many of his later publications on non-poetic topics are written in the expressive language of prose poems. = Arrest and death = On September 8, 1938 Gastev was arrested on false charges of \\"counter- revolutionary terrorist activity\\". He was detained in a Moscow prison and sentenced to death by a speedy trial on April 14, 1939. There was no defense attorney and no possibility to appeal against the decision, as was common during the Great Purge. On April 15, 1939 Gastev was shot to death in the suburbs of Moscow. October 1, 1941, the date of Gastev's death given by some sources, is based on false information given by the authorities to Gastev's family prior to 1991. No reliable information about Gastev's fate after his arrest was available until the KGB archive, where the interrogation and trial documents were kept, became accessible to relatives in the early 1990s. =Legacy= Gastev's legacy is commemorated by the Gastev's CupThe Project of the Year:The Gastev Cup accessed 27 April 2012 by the \\"Lean Forum.

Originally an order for one of the most difficult emergency repair jobs aboard a sailing ship, it became a euphemism for authorized celebratory drinking afterward, and then the name of an order to grant the crew an extra ration of rum or grog. History Braces are the lines that control the angle of the yards. On square-rigged ships, the mainbrace was the longest line in of all the running rigging.Kusk Jensen: \\"Handbuch der praktischen Seemanschaft auf traditionellen Segelschiffen\\", 1998, p. 172 (orig. 1924) It was common to aim for the ship's rigging during naval battles. If the mainbrace was shot away, it was usually necessary to repair it during the engagement; the ship was unmaneuverable without it and would have to stay on the same tack. Even repairing it after the battle was a difficult job; the mainbrace ran through blocks, so it could not be repaired with a short splice or a knot. Splicing in a large run of hemp was strenuous work, and generally the ship's best Able Seamen were chosen to carry out the task under the supervision of the Boatswain (\\"bosun\\"). On completion of the task, it was customary for the men to be rewarded with an extra ration of rum. The Boatswain would take a sip from the ration of each of the men he had selected for task. Eventually the order to \\"splice the mainbrace\\" came to mean that the crew would receive an extra ration of rum, and was issued on special occasions: after victory in battle, the change of a monarch, a royal birth, a royal wedding or an inspection of the fleet. In cases where the whole fleet was to receive the signal, it would be run up with a lift of flags or signalled by semaphore. A sailor on board HMS York measures out tots of rum for the ship's company A ration of rum a day was standard issue in the Royal Navy until 1970, when concerns over crew members operating machinery under the influence led to the rum ration being abolished. Restrictions were placed on those who could \\"splice the mainbrace\\": any man or officer over the age of 18 who desired to take it received an extra issue of one-eighth of a pint of rum. Lemonade was issued those who did not wish for the rum. The rum was mixed with water to make grog for all ratings below Petty Officer. Only ratings marked \\"G\\" (for Grog) in the ship's books could draw rum, grog or lemonade when the mainbrace was spliced and no payment in lieu was available. Those under 20 were marked \\"U.A.\\" (for under age) in the ship's book; they were similarly barred from drawing the daily rum ration. \\"T\\" stood for Temperance (for those of Temperance Movement). The issue of rum to wardroom and gunroom officers was stopped in 1881 and ended for warrant officers in 1918; splicing the mainbrace was the only time that officers could be issued with rum. Other navies abolished the grog allowance far earlier (the United States Navy after the American Civil War), but the order persisted, allowing the crew to take another drink in place of rum or grog; in 1845 it is recorded as being substituted for the more rowdy \\"Crossing the Line\\" ceremony. The Royal New Zealand Navy was the last navy to issue junior and senior ratings a daily tot of rum, issuing its last daily rum ration on 1 March 1990. Today the Royal Canadian Navy is more generous with the allowances, allowing crew members to take of spirits compared with the allowed by the Royal Navy, although the Royal Navy does make allowance for paucity of supplies, permitting two cans of beer to be issued if commercial spirits are not available. The order \\"Splice the Mainbrace\\" was still popular with some of the U.S. Navy's submarine fleet during WWII. On ,Eugene B. Fluckey, 1992, \\"Thunder Below!: The USS Barb Revolutionizes Submarine Warfare in World War II\\" a skipper on combat patrols in WWII, during the boat's 8th and 9th missions in 1944, did in fact announce on the 1MC \\"Splice the Mainbrace\\" after each successful attack and sinking of a Japanese ship. On Barb 's 8th combat patrol, the skipper promised the sinking of 5 ships; Barb delivered. After each sinking the Skipper had a special cake made and each sailor was granted a shot of rot gut whiskey. On the 9th patrol, the Skipper was able to sneak 24 cases of beer aboard which was distributed after each of Barb's successful attacks. Permission to issue the order to splice the mainbrace is heavily restricted; the Royal Navy allows only the Queen, a member of the Royal Family, or the Admiralty Board to do so; the Royal Canadian Navy permits the Queen, the Governor General of Canada, or the Chief of the Defence Staff to issue it. When the Mediterranean fleet received the order from the Prince of Wales (the future Edward VIII) in 1932 it was the first time it had happened since 1918; it was accompanied by the order to \\"Mend and make clothes\\", another archaic signal which grants the crew a half-day holiday. Ships in most of the victorious fleets received the order at the end of the Second World War; one ship received the order while still under attack. King George VI issued the order in 1949 to the crew of after the Yangtse Incident. It was ordered on the day of Queen Elizabeth's coronation in 1953, on 29 July 1981 for the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer and of Prince William's birth on 21 June 1982, when \\"Splice the Mainbrace\\" was celebrated in the Fleet just one week after the end of the Falklands War. Nowadays, when rum is no longer issued daily, the order is somewhat more freely given: the Queen issued it after her Golden Jubilee celebrations in 2002, after the Trafalgar 200 Fleet Review in 2005, and after her Diamond Jubilee celebrations in 2012. In Canada, the order was most recently given by Queen Elizabeth II on 29 June 2010 at the conclusion of the International Fleet Review for the occasion of the Royal Canadian Navy's 100th Anniversary.

History  The Virginia Museum of Transportation began its life in 1963 as the Roanoke Transportation Museum located in Wasena Park in Roanoke, Virginia. The museum at that time was housed in an old Norfolk & Western Railway freight depot on the banks of the Roanoke River. The earliest components of the museum's collection included a United States Army Jupiter rocket and the N&W; J Class Locomotive #611, donated by Norfolk & Western Railway to the City of Roanoke where many of its engines were constructed. The museum expanded its collection to include other pieces of rail equipment such as a former DC Transit PCC streetcar, and a number of horse-drawn vehicles including a hearse, a covered wagon, and a Studebaker wagon. In November 1985, a flood nearly destroyed the museum, and much of its collection. It forced the shutdown of the facility and the refurbishment of #611. In April 1986, the museum re-opened in the Norfolk and Western Railway Freight Station in downtown Roanoke as the Virginia Museum of Transportation. The museum has earned that title, being recognized by the General Assembly of Virginia as the Commonwealth's official transportation museum. The Norfolk & Western steam locomotives No. 611 and No. 1218 were originally property of the city of Roanoke due to the museum's original charter. On the April 2, 2012, VMT's 50 Birthday, the city officially gave the locomotives to the museum. The Norfolk and Western Railway Freight Station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. The station consists of two clearly identifiable sections, both of which were completed in 1918. They are the two-story, fifty-bay-long, freight station proper which was built parallel to the railroad tracks and now is oriented south, and the one- story-with-basement brick annex that formerly housed the offices of the Shenandoah and Radford divisions of the Norfolk and Western.

A later E95 model was developed with an inclined-engine. AMC produced AJS and Matchless brands at the time. Racing history The motorcycle was originally designed by AJS to be supercharged, as were a number of pre-war racing bikes, but the FICM banned supercharging in 1946. The motor was then worked on to allow it to perform without a supercharger. Jock West first rode the machine at the 1947 Isle of Man TT where he experienced teething problems relegating him to a 15th place, although he recorded the third fastest lap time of the race. Leslie Graham then rode the bike to victory in the inaugural 1949 FIM 500cc world championship. This was the only World Championship win for AJS. Despite this victory, the bike is often cited as unreliable, and not living up to its promise. Mechanicals = Engine = E95 Porcupine engine The E90S Porcupine engine was a unit construction, aluminium alloy, 500 cc, DOHC twin, with horizontal cylinders and heads, to give the bike a low centre of gravity. A later version of this motor was named the E95, re-engineered to have its cylinders inclined at 45 degrees for better cooling and easier carburettor installation, and is claimed to have produced 55 bhp @ 7600 rpm The gear drive for the camshafts was on the right of the motor, while the gear primary drive was on the left. The geared primary drive meant that the motor ran \\"backwards\\". The cam gear drive also drove a jackshaft at the rear of the cylinders, which drove an oil pump, a fuel pump, and (via a chain drive) a Lucas magneto. The four-speed gearbox output was on the right. As originally designed, the E90S was to be supercharged, with the blower mounted above the gearbox, and driven by the clutch. The loss of the supercharger meant that the design was compromised, lacking sufficient flywheel effect, which caused problems with magneto failure. The main initial change was to reduce the valve angle to 90 degrees for a more compact combustion chamber. It had rubber mounted twin GP carburettors, inclined at 49 degrees, with an unusual float tank system used rather than float bowls. Plain bearings were used for the big end bearings and the centre main bearings. The outer main bearings were rollers. One problem cited for the engine is the use of non parallel valves with conventional rockers. The 1947 model engine was mostly made of alloy, but, as an experiment, the head was cast in silver for increased thermal efficiency. Due to the softness of silver, it had to be alloyed to make it hard enough for racing use. By the time this was achieved the thermal efficiency gains were lost, and the experiment was abandoned. There is dispute as to whether the silver cylinder head went beyond feasibility-study stage. = Frame = The Porcupine used \\"Jam-pot\\" shocks and Teledraulic race forks. The E90 model had an open frame. The E95, introduced in 1953, had a loop type frame with the motor mounted lower. Only four E95 Porcupines were built. The AJS Porcupine today Team Obsolete have restored a 1954 AJS Porcupine E95, using an ex-Tom Arter MKII motor, which features a unique Jack Williams built up roller bearing crankshaft. They use it for exhibition and historic racing. Tom Arter put a complete 1954 E95 AJS Porcupine up for auction, and it sold for $228,620. A 1954 AJS E95 Porcupine was sold post-auction at Bonhams in 2011, for $675,000 (plus fees).

It was first published in 1928 by Oxford University Press and was edited by Percy Dearmer, Martin Shaw and Ralph Vaughan Williams. It became a widely used source of carols among choirs and church congregations in Britain. History Vaughan Williams was a noted composer and arranger of music in the Anglican Church and a founder member of the English Folk Dance and Song Society. He was a scholar of English folk-song and his music was greatly influenced by traditional folk forms.Frogley, Alain. \\"Williams, Ralph Vaughan (1872–1958)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, retrieved 10 October 2015 Vaughan Williams had collaborated with Percy Dearmer on the production of the English Hymnal, which was published in 1906, and as with this hymnal, The Oxford Book of Carols favoured traditional folk tunes and polyphonic arrangements of carols, instead of the Victorian hymn tunes that Vaughan Williams considered to be over-sentimental and Germanic in tone. Vaughan Williams in particular drew on music from his own childhood and his scholarship of English folk music, and was driven by his conviction that the music of ordinary people should be valued. Editions The Oxford Book of Carols has been reprinted many times. It was re-engraved and reset in a slightly larger format in 1964, at which time some of the medieval carols were re-edited. The most recent impression is dated 26 January 1984 and is still in print. The New Oxford Book of Carols was published in 1992 by OUP. Anthologists Hugh Keyte and Andrew Parrott make few references to OBC in their Introduction and their aim appears the same as Dearmer's in 1928. The enormous task was shared by both sets of anthologists and Keyte and Parrott issued The Shorter New Oxford Book of Carols in 1993.

For these actions, he was incarcerated at the Montreal Pied-du-Courant Prison and was hanged at the site by the British authorities. de Lorimier was born in Saint-Cuthbert, Lower Canada. Trial and execution On January 11, 1839 de Lorimier and three of his comrades (two of whom managed to escape before being executed; the other was Chevrier Bénard) appeared before the British Council of War. Refused his request for a trial in a civilian court, de Lorimier apparently effectively defended himself and challenged the crown's evidence. However, Jean-Baptiste-Henri Brien, one of his co-accused and terrified of the scaffold, signed a confession incriminating de Lorimier and others and the British authorities, having failed to seize the main leaders of the rebellion, arguably pursued his death to make an example. On January 21 de Lorimier and his companions were found guilty of high treason and sentenced to be hanged which took place on February 15, 1839, together with Charles Hindelang, Amable Daunais, François Nicolas and Pierre-Rémi Narbonne. The day before, de Lorimier wrote his political testament: > I die without remorse; in the insurrection I only desired the well-being and > independence [from Britain] of my country. My views and my actions were > sincere and were innocent of any of the crimes which dis-honor mankind, and > which are too common when released passions boil up... In spite of so many > mishaps, my heart still keeps its courage and its hopes for the future; my > children and my friends will see better days. Looking tranquilly ahead, I am > sure that they will win freedom. That is what fills me with joy when all > around me is sorry and desolation... I leave behind me children whose only > heritage is the memory of my misfortune. Poor orphans, it is you who are to > be pitied, you whom the bloody and arbitrary hand of the law strikes through > my death. You will have no gentile and affectionate memories of happy days > with your father. When you are old enough to reflect, you will see in your > father a man who has paid on the scaffold for actions such as have > immortalized other happier men. The only crime of your father was his > failure.Quoted in Margaret Fairley, The Spirit of Canadian Democracy, > Progress Publishing, Toronto: 1945, pgs 46-47.

It was founded as an Evangelical Christian ex-gay organisation that sought to change gay people to straight, but subsequently rejected the idea that sexual orientation could or should be changed and now exists as a pro-gay evangelical Christian ministry.

The group used to be affiliated with the ex-gay movement and was once a member of Exodus International.News article in The Advocate, March 13, 2001, at . In 2002, the organisation abandoned those views and its affiliation with the ex-gay movement.http://www.courage.org.uk/articles/article.asp?id=5 At the time of its founding, the group's efforts were considered progressive, because it reached out to gay people rather than condemning them to hell. = Shift in direction = By 2000, Jeremy Marks and the leadership of Courage UK recognised a change was needed. The expectation of the ex-gay teaching did not equal the results they saw. Gay participants trying to become straight through the organisation became severely depressed and attempted suicide; Marks observed that only those who accepted that they were gay and found a partner were happy and successful. The teaching that gay people must get into a heterosexual relationship or remain celibate now seemed questionable to Marks. This was not only from an experiential viewpoint, but also from a theological change.News article in UCNews, the newspaper of the United Church of Christ, July–August 2003, at . In 2001, Jeremy Marks wrote in the journal Lesbian and Gay Christians, \\"I have come to the conclusion that we have been quite wrong to dismiss all same sex love (other than platonic) as sinful\\"; the group's change of position was motivated by the belief that the Bible says man should not be alone and that a loving God would not deny gay people the opportunity to love. Marks' comments on the Courage UK websiteCourage - The Way Forward for Courage clarify the group's change of course: > A Change of Heart is the Priority > While recognising the social pressure to become 'normal' (i.e. > heterosexual), fifteen years experience revealed that God's primary concern > is not to change the sexual orientation of his gay and lesbian disciples, > but to help them find wholeness in Christ - becoming secure, assured of his > love and acceptance, set apart to follow Jesus faithfully and responsible in > building relationships with one another. As a direct result of the New Approach, Courage took a \\"sabbatical\\" from Exodus International. Courage was also forced to resign from the Evangelical Alliance.

It is a five-section piece that spans lines 440–866 of the Christ triad in the Exeter Book (folios 14a-20b), and is homiletic in its subject matter in contrast to the martyrological nature of Juliana, Elene, and Fates of the Apostles. Christ II draws upon a number of ecclesiastical sources, but it is primarily framed upon Gregory the Great’s Homily XXIX on Ascension Day. The poem is assigned to a triad of Old English religious poems in the Exeter Book, known collectively as Christ. Christ comprises a total of 1664 lines and deals with Christ's Advent, Ascension and Last Judgment. It was originally thought to be one piece completed by a single author, but the poem is now broken up into three parts.  Background  The poem Christ was originally thought to be one piece completed by a single author. Almost all scholars now break the poems into three parts: Christ I is focused on Advent, Christ II, on the Ascension, and Christ III primarily dealing with Doomsday. The poems are the first items in the Exeter Book which is a rather large manuscript that has 123 (some sources argue 131) folios contained in it. The Exeter Book has been at the Exeter Cathedral Library since 1072 where it was donated by Bishop Leofric. No one is exactly positive where the Exeter Book originated. Some argue it was written in a monastic institution in Exeter in the 7th century while others state it originated in Canterbury or Glastonbury. The book contains 123 leaves, or 246 pages, with a few random missing pages because the book was unbound for a long period of time. Many other pages have holes from burns, cuts by a knife, and stains by a pot of liquid. Christ is the longest poem by far in the book if one looks at it as an entirety. Christ II has some similar themes to the rest of the Christ poem but it is also very different. All three poems have a unique identity and narrative voice that differs from the others. Christ II is clearly based on the 29th homily that Pope Gregory the Great wrote. Pope Gregory the Great was well known for being the father of Roman Christianity in England, believed to have started the constitution of liturgy, and the compilation of musical service-songbooks used in the church. Gregory focused the end section of his homily on why angels didn't wear white robes at the Incarnation but did at the Ascension.  Author  Cynewulf receives credit for writing Christ II, but his inspiration came from the 23rd Psalm and a homily written by Pope Gregory. Cynewulf is one of the two only named Anglo- Saxon poets. His name is found as Cyniwulf, Cynewulf, and Cynwulf; he is also responsible for at least Christ II, Juliana, The Fates of the Apostles, and Elene. Scholars believe that Cynewulf did not write before 750 because he used an e instead of an i which was not established until that time. Most would assume that he was not writing after the 10th century either. Some research showed that Cynewulf's Elene corresponded with a portion of a book that was dedicated to Charlemagne as Emperor around 800. Even though there are no certain dates to when Cynewulf lived or the Exeter Book was compiled, there is a general theory about when they were inspired. Cynewulf has been greatly studied by scholars to figure out where he exactly lived as well. Some think Cynewulf is from Dunwich because he knew a lot about the sea, but there has never been any hard evidence that verified any of these hypotheses. It has been suggested that Cynewulf was a thegn or retainer to a lord at probably a younger point in his life, and he certainly did not come from noble birth. Cynewulf positively learned the Latin rudiments so many assume that he probably attended the Minster School of York. Most people would also believe that he was either a monk or a priest, and possibly even both. He was a normal orthodox believer of his time who agreed with Gregory the Great on everything except for Purgatory. Cynewulf praised the Trinity as being three separate but combined parts, thought sinners may obtain a pardon from hell if they repent and turn from their sins, and assumed saints could intercede in earthly matters. Cynewulf's identity is still largely unknown, but we can be positive that he placed his signature in four separate poems. Cynewulf signed his poems using runes which come from the Germanic alphabet that Anglo-Saxons used before switching to the Roman alphabet. A rune can stand for an actual letter or for the word of its name. The first rune cen(c) stands for ‘torch’ while yr(y) represents ‘bow’. These words are sometimes substituted in order to make more grammatical sense so it can be extremely difficult to search and find Cynewulf's signature. At the end of The Fates of the Apostles, Cynewulf signs his names F, W, U, L, C, Y, N. It is assumed that he did this to show that he was a sinner like everyone else or to relate to the Biblical idea that ‘the last shall be first’. Summary Christ II begins by stating how important it is for men to seek out the truth and where it came from. Christ was born of the Virgin Mary in Bethlehem. After he was crucified and rose from the dead he spent forty days on earth before ascending back to heaven. Before Christ left he said to gathered people, “Rejoice in spirit! I shall never leave you, but I shall always continue in love towards you and give you power and remain with you for ever and ever so that by my grace you will never be wanting in virtue.” After Christ had given his speech, a large number of angels appeared above the temple. They asked the people why they were just standing around and waiting. The angels explained to the people that they were there to escort Christ back to his home in heaven. The people were warned to be ready for the time when Christ would return to judge everyone for the deeds that they have committed. The clouds surrounded Jesus and the angels and joy rang out throughout all of heaven. But the people who had just witnessed this were very sad because of their loss. Men and women were crying and everyone's hearts were heavy. It is extremely important that we praise God for all the blessings he has bestowed on us. People need to thank the Lord for food, possessions, weather and shelter, along with the sun and moon. Praise needs to be given for the dew and rain which supply the earth. Most of all, God needs to be thanked for the salvation that he freely gives us a chance to have. Now we no longer need to suffer in the pain and misery we once had. Long ago, the prophet Job called the Lord's son a bird who would not be understood by many people. The bird flew from his home and came to earth in human form. After all of his work had been done by the grace of God he flew (ascended) back to his home in heaven. There the Lord created mansions for his people. He also instilled wisdom in the minds of his followers and gave others the gift of singing. The Lord also blessed some with skilled fingers for playing the harp or the ability to write down languages. He stands as an upright tree that one can cling to in a time of need. The Lord is willing to give man many gifts, including wisdom, if he can cast his own pride aside. After Christ had returned to heaven, many of his church followers faced tough oppression. Pagan governments were in charge and they didn't allow them to worship. The pagans destroyed and burned God's temple and killed many. The Lord will redeem His people and all the problems that they have faced. King Solomon gives hope to the people when he sang, “(the Lord) will garland the hills and heights with his glory; he will redeem the world, all earth’s inhabitants, by that glorious spring.” The poem then focuses on the six leaps that Christ has already made. His first leap () was when he descended to the earth through the Virgin Mary.Christ II, lines 720-723a. The second spring () was when he was born in the manger.Christ II, lines 723b-726a. His third leap (), Christ ascended the cross (he on rode astag).Christ II, lines 726b-728a. His fourth spring () was when he abandoned the cross () and entered the tomb.Christ II, lines 728b-730a. His fifth leap () was when he went to hell before his resurrection.Christ II, lines 730b-736a. The sixth leap () was when the Lord ascended into the heavens with the joyous jubilation of the angels.Christ II, lines 736b-738a. The motif of Christ's leaps derives from Pope Gregory’s \\"Twenty-ninth Homily on the Gospels\\" (or \\"Ascension Homily\\") of . The motif is a mystical interpretation of the Song of Solomon (Canticles 2.8) and is found as early as the third century in the work of Hippolytus.James W.

During the Han dynasty (202 BC – AD 220), this was a pass through which the Silk Road passed, and was the one road connecting Central Asia with East Asia (China), the former called the Western Regions. Just to the south was the Yangguan pass, which was also an important point on the Silk Road. Although the Chinese guan is usually translated simply as \\"pass\\", its more specific meaning is a \\"frontier pass\\" to distinguish it from an ordinary pass through the mountains. Yumen guan 玉門關 and Yang guan 陽關 are derived from: yu 玉 = 'jade' + men 門 = 'gate', 'door'; and yang 陽 = 'sunny side', 'south side of a hill', 'north side of a river,' and guan 關 = ‘frontier-passes’.

Their motto is \\"Pick on someone your own caliber\\". History Inspired by a Salon.com article written by Jonathan Rauch,Rauch, Jonathan. \\"Pink Pistols\\" Salon (website) (March 14, 2000). Krikket (aka Doug Krick), a libertarian activist from Illinois while living in Massachusetts, founded the Pink Pistols in July 2000. The organization had at least 45 chapters, as of October 2014. Those chapters are located in 33 states and three countries that are principally made up of gun-owning LGBT individuals, though neither status is mandatory for membership. The political orientation of the Pink Pistols is considered unusual due to the popular perception in the United States of firearms ownership as a \\"conservative issue\\" and sexuality as a \\"liberal issue\\". However, there is nothing within either of these two single issues that is mutually exclusive and a variety of other pro-gun organizations exist for groups not typically associated with gun rights (for example, the \\"Democrats for the Second Amendment\\").Berger, Knute. \\"Gays & guns\\" , Seattle Weekly (October 9, 2006). Pink Pistols' activities include firing range visits and political activism. The group occasionally produces report cards on politicians, rating their position on issues of interest to members. According to pinkpistols.org: The Pink Pistols' symbol consists of an overhead view of a picto-person aiming a handgun in an isosceles stance superimposed on a pink triangle. The pink triangle, now a gay pride and gay rights symbol, was originally a badge that homosexual concentration camp victims were forced to wear during the Holocaust. According to spokesperson Gwen Patton, \\"We don't want people to hurt us, we want people to run away from us, and the best way we have found to do that is to be armed.\\"McKay, Holly. \\"Gay gun activists: Growing LGBT push to support the Second Amendment\\", Fox News (October 1, 2014). Patton has also stated that, \\"the Pink Pistols tend to get a better response from firearms supporters than from homosexuals\\".Marech, Rona. \\"SAN FRANCISCO / Gay group defends right to arms / Pink Pistols oppose ballot issue backed by supervisors\\", San Francisco Chronicle (February 3, 2005). The group's membership increased from 1,500 to 4,500 in the week after the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting. As of June 24, 2016, the membership is over 7,000, and there are 36 chapters around the country. The group experienced a further rise in interest following Donald Trump's election to the presidency later that year. By April 2017, the group claimed a membership of over 9,000. On September 23, 2018, trans woman Erin Palette became the new president of the Pink Pistols.

In the Netherlands it was planted notably along the Westlandsgracht in Amsterdam where it still survives, although upper branches are often killed by Coral-spot Fungus. Heybroek, having observed in 1957 its wind-resistance in Schleswig-Holstein, included Hoersholm elm in his breeding programme (see 'Hybrid cultivars' below).

This 'N That did not repeat those details, and therefore contained very little information about the period before 1962, and concentrated on Davis's acting career of the 1970s and 1980s. Much of her writing concerned her recent illness and recovery from a major stroke. Background This 'n That was published after her daughter B. D. Hyman's memoir My Mother's Keeper (1985), in which Hyman depicted Davis as an alcoholic, overbearing shrew. Davis referred to Hyman in her book with pride and affection throughout, with the bulk of it having been written prior to the publication of Hyman's memoir; however, a final chapter was in the form of a letter addressed \\"Dear Hyman,\\" in which Davis expressed her sense of betrayal. Davis and Hyman reportedly remained estranged until Davis' death in 1989. The tensions between the two women were widely reported during the marketing of both books.

The Saints released their first single in 1976. Bands playing subgenres or offshoots of punk music, such as local hardcore acts, still have a strong cult following throughout Australia. Fans started to form bands, both punk and dissimilar in sound, beginning a distinct Brisbane punk scene, one of the first in the world. By 1977, other bands were starting to form in Sydney, under the influence of local and overseas punk acts. These bands and other Australian and overseas punk acts were strongly supported by public radio stations. The Young Charlatans had formed in Melbourne out of the ashes of earlier bands. During the late 1970s, former members of Radio Birdman contributed to several new Sydney bands. The Quick and the Dead, who played in Perth during 1979-81, pioneered a sound closely related to Oi!. 1973–1976 The Saints were one of Australia's first punk bands. The earliest incarnation of the Saints was formed by Ed Kuepper (guitar) and Chris Bailey (vocals) in Brisbane, Queensland in 1973. They shared a background in immigrant families (Kuepper's German and Bailey's Irish), and an admiration for high energy 1950s and '60s music, such as the Detroit rock of the Stooges and MC5. Queensland at the time was controlled by the conservative, authoritarian Country Party democratic government of Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen – an environment with plenty of inspiration for creative and alienated young people. The result was a frenetic, pulsating sound, topped with Bailey's sardonic lyrics. Unable to get regular gigs, they played at a house in inner city Petrie Terrace, where they soon attracted unwanted attention. Police arrested fans for trivial offences, often in a brutal fashion, but their approach only created more interest in the punk scene. The Saints gigs' got bigger and their fans started to form bands, both punk and dissimilar in sound, beginning a distinct Brisbane punk scene, one of the first in the world. During 1974, Radio Birdman formed in Sydney, led by another immigrant, Detroit-born medical student Deniz Tek. They also shared an interest in the Stooges and MC5, albeit with a result arguably more akin to Hard rock than Punk. Their dynamic live shows soon gained a fanatical following at inner city venues. Many art rock bands, like Melbourne's Boys Next Door, formed by Nick Cave and Mick Harvey at their school in 1974, later attended gigs by the Saints and Radio Birdman, and would adopt elements of their sounds. In Perth – a geographically isolated city with social and political similarities to Brisbane – young musicians like Kim Salmon, Dave Faulkner and James Baker were also influenced by the Detroit bands, as well as New York proto-punk figures like Lou Reed and the New York Dolls. Salmon led the Cheap Nasties, and then the Scientists, before embarking on a solo career (and is regarded as a pioneer of grunge). Baker was in a short-lived act called the Geeks, before forming the Victims with Faulkner in 1977. They recorded an acclaimed single, \\"Television Addict\\", before breaking up. Baker later joined the Scientists. Faulkner gravitated towards poppier sounds. (In 1981, he and Baker founded a successful Retro rock act, the Hoodoo Gurus.) In mid-1976, the Saints recorded and distributed copies of their single \\"(I'm) Stranded\\", which met nearly no critical or public response in Australia. In the UK, however,Sounds magazine received a copy, and declared it: \\"single of this and every week\\". As a result, the band was signed to a three-album contract with EMI. Later the same year they recorded their first LP, which was also called (I'm) Stranded. Hampered by poor production and the indifference of radio stations, the LP failed commercially. In December the Saints moved to Sydney. Radio Birdman released an EP (\\"Burn My Eye\\") and an album (Radios Appear) with better production values, but with similar commercial results to the Saints' endeavours. Punk takes off, 1977–80 By 1977, other bands were starting to form in Sydney, under the influence of local and overseas punk acts. The early Sydney punk scene centred around the Sydney inner city suburbs, and the Grand Hotel in Haymarket in particular. Among the first was the Last Words, from Liverpool in Sydney. (They recorded their first single \\"Animal World/Wondering Why\\" in 1977.) Other Sydney bands in 1977 included the Hellcats (featuring Ron Peno, later lead singer of the Died Pretty), the Psychosurgeons (later known as Lipstick Killers), Johnny Dole & the Scabs and the Thought Criminals (who featured Steven Phillip, later of Do-Re-Mi and John Hoey, who was also later in Died Pretty). These bands and other Australian and overseas punk acts were strongly supported by public radio stations, especially 2JJ. Punk bands like the Reals (featuring Ollie Olsen) and the Babeez (later known as the News) were also being formed in Melbourne. In Brisbane, the Survivors (who showed a 1960s influence), the Leftovers (diverse influences), Razar (contemporary British punk) and the Fun Things (Detroit rock) all followed in the wake of the Saints. After the British punk scene took off in 1977, both the Saints and Radio Birdman moved to the UK. This proved to be disastrous for both bands. Neither of them fit in with, or were inclined to adjust to aspects of the London scene at the time, such the now-established punk fashion in clothes. Radio Birdman were dumped when their record company got into financial difficulty, and soon broke up. Later recordings saw the Saints adopt soul, blues and jazz influences, although their most successful single, \\"This Perfect Day\\" – which reached number 34 in the UK pop charts – was typical of the band's musical style. After another acclaimed single, \\"Know Your Product\\", and second and third albums failed to make an impression, EMI dropped the Saints. (Kuepper left in 1979 and Bailey began to pursue a more mainstream musical direction.) Last Words later followed their predecessors to the UK and also failed to make a strong impression. By the end of 1977, the \\"supergroup\\" Young Charlatans had formed in Melbourne out of the ashes of earlier bands. Ollie Olsen, Rowland S. Howard (guitar, later in the Birthday Party), Jeff Wegener (drums, former member of the Saints, later in the Laughing Clowns) and Janine Hall (later in the Saints). The band recorded the first version of the Howard song \\"Shivers\\" (made famous by the Boys Next Door and hard rockers Screaming Jets). In Sydney, a Birdman offshoot, the Hitmen, had started to gig and Ian Rilen formed the longevitous X. Entrepreneurs began to realise the potential of the growing scene and Michael Gudinski launched the Melbourne-based Suicide Records, which in May 1978 released a compilation, Lethal Weapons. The album included tracks by the Boys Next Door, Teenage Radio Stars (featuring future Models members Sean Kelly and James Freud, and also La Femme members bassist Graham Schiavello and drummer Pete Kidd), JAB (ex-experimental rockers from Adelaide, featuring Bohdan X and synthesizer player Ash Wednesday), the Survivors and X-Ray-Z (former pub rockers from Adelaide). However the royalty rate offered by Suicide was low and both the News and Young Charlatans decided not to get involved. Keith Glass launched the Melbourne-based Missing Link Records, which between 1978–80 released La Femme's singles & Album,Chane Chane (vocals), Brett Walker (guitar), Graham Schiavello (bass), and Pete Kidd (drums). They were the first independent band on Countdown and opened \\"Suburban pub rock\\" to local punk bands. Keith Glass also managed the Boys Next Door and released all their music through to the change to the Birthday Party. Australian chart success eluded all of these bands in the late 1970s. Radio programmers were conservative and unenthusiastic about punk. The above artists who eventually found success either did so overseas, or after a remove of several years in Australia, and/or in different bands. 1979-91 During the late 1970s, former members of Radio Birdman contributed to several new Sydney bands: the New Christs, the Visitors, the Passengers (featuring Angie Pepper) and the Screaming Tribesmen. Two distinctive, long-lasting Sydney bands, the Celibate Rifles and Lime Spiders, were formed in 1979. Meanwhile, other Sydney groups like X and feedtime carried the punk energy of their forebears into nascent noise rock territory. In Melbourne, post-punk sounds began to take over, typified by the \\"little band scene\\". By the early 1980s, only a handful of bands were still playing songs with classic punk sounds, such as the Cosmic Psychos and the satirically-inclined Painters and Dockers. Melbourne's La Femme were a fascinating meld of late Seventies influences: punk, new wave, glam and hard rock. Their 1978 debut single Chelsea Kids is one of the all-time classic Australian singles and their only LP: La Femme, is arguably one of the best to come out of Melbourne's late 1970s punk/new wave scene (which included Models and the Boys Next Door). It contains many fine examples of the band's confident, swaggering glam-infused punk-metal sound. Lead singer Chane Chane was a charismatic, hyperactive front man, a refreshing personality with a strong audience rapport. Guitarist Brett Walker was a real live flashy guitar hero for the times, coming on like a punk-metal Mick Ronson by pealing off large chunks of dense power riffing when other guitarists were still going plink-plonk. The thuggish rhythm section of Peter Kidd and Graham Schiavello played it mean and hard, providing the relentless, driving beat. La Femme could well have made it into the big league if they’d wanted but swimming against the commercial tide seemed to be their raison d'être. In many ways they were their own worst enemies. An unwillingness to play the pop star game and the serious drug addiction, among other things, perhaps ended up compromising the band's drive. For an inner-city band with so much potential, in the end they really did give it away. They toured constantly, built up a huge support base on the suburban pub circuit, scored several prestigious support gigs, made three appearances on Countdown (one of the first punk/new wave/alternative bands to do so), released one of the great Melbourne punk albums and yet they never rose above being a cult attraction. The Quick and the Dead, who played in Perth during 1979-81, pioneered a sound closely related to Oi!. They attracted media attention resulting from the behaviour of some fans, including violence and the use of Nazi regalia. Some Brisbane punk rock bands prolonged their unique punk direction from the Seventies, that was in part due to Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen's continued use of the Queensland Police against perceived threats to the government. The Boys Next Door, renamed the Birthday Party in 1980 and featuring Nick Cave, were pioneers in incorporating \\"darker\\" elements into their image, with connections to the genres of gothic rock, horror punk and deathrock. Other prominent examples included Brisbane bands Vampire Lovers and Mystery of Sixes. A fourth generation of bands, such as the Hard-Ons (from Sydney) and Exploding White Mice (from Adelaide), also emerged. Former members of the Celibate Rifles and Lime Spiders formed the Eastern Dark, a short-lived but well-regarded act.Australian hardcore punk acts also emerged, such as Massappeal, who began gigging in Sydney during 1985. From Brunswick emerged the smooth distorted sound of the Zorros with their single from Missing Link records \\"Too Young\\" reaching Number 3 in Radio RRR charts. The Zorros would play hard and fast and pack out many venues. Punk revival since 1991 By the early 1990s, the success of grunge music, American punk veterans and revivalists, as well as local bands like the Hybernators, the Speed Demons, the Meanies, Frenzal Rhomb, and Screamfeeder led to the formation of punk-influenced bands such as the Living End, Jebediah, Bodyjar, 28 Days, Dreamkillers, Four Zero One Four, Align, and Guttersnipes. Punk revival scenes began in various cities around Australia. In one of these cities (Melbourne) punk has seen a resurgence in recent years. Along with straight up punk bands like Dixon Cider, Scrayfish, the Half Pints, Let's Jump Ship and the Flying Rats forming, there have also been the emergence of folk punk bands like Gentleman's Riot, Mutiny and Catgut Mary and skate punk bands such as Bombs Are Falling and Postscript . The reforming of many earlier punk bands from the 1980s (such as Bastard Squad and Depression) has also been prominent. The Late 2000s has also seen a resurgence in street punk across the Australian east coast with bands like No Idea (VIC), the Scam(QLD), the Lost Cause (QLD), Deputy Dipshit (QLD), the Worst (VIC), Stay Down (TAS), Wot Rot (VIC) and many more leaving their mark. Vans Warped Tour successfully returned to Australia in 2013 after an 11-year hiatus, however many DIY grass roots events stepped up to fill the gap.

It is a remake of the 1912 hand-colored, black-and- white film The Miracle, which was in turn a production of the 1911 pantomime play, The Miracle, written by Karl Vollmöller and directed by Max Reinhardt. The 1959 film version for Warner Bros. was shot in Technirama and Technicolor, with an original score by Elmer Bernstein. The film was shot in the Los Angeles area, the Gypsy camp sequence was shot in the Santa Susana Mountains around Calabasas, California.https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/52959?sid=fa883d61-525f-4224-838c-43951eee4e2d&sr;=1.0336008&cp;=1&pos;=1 Plot Teresa (Carroll Baker), a postulant at the convent of Miraflores in Salamanca, Spain, is an orphan taken in by the sisters there. She enjoys the convent life, despite being a handful for her superiors. She sings worldly love songs to the other postulants and reads secular stories and plays such as Romeo and Juliet. Still, she has a lively devotion to Christ and to His Blessed Mother. A statue of the Madonna, in fact, is held in high regard by Teresa as she goes about her duties. When the British march through the town on their way to battle Napoleon, Teresa is drawn to a handsome captain (Roger Moore) she sees while he waters his horse. After a defeat at the Battle of Salamanca the British regiment limps back to the convent which the Mother Superior offers as a hospital for the wounded. Here Teresa learns more about the young captain who had attracted her interest. He is Michael Stuart, he finds Teresa fascinating, and before long he and Teresa find themselves falling in love. Recovered, the soldiers march out of the convent grounds to be billeted in the nearby town of Miraflores. The seventeen-year-old Teresa is filled with desire for Michael and begins to question her calling. Returning to duty, Michael asks Teresa to marry him; she hesitates, but runs after him. They kiss and Michael proposes that they meet at the town's inn if she wants to leave the religious life and marry him. Teresa is in a quandary. In the chapel she begs for guidance. When no tangible sign is forthcoming she strips off her postulant's habit, wraps a cloak about herself and dashes off into the night to meet with Michael in the town. At this point the miracle occurs. The cherished statue of the Virgin Mary comes to life, dons the discarded habit, and secretly takes Teresa's place at the convent. A thunderstorm roars up as the statue of the Holy Mother steps off its pedestal, but it is the last rain the people of the valley will see for several years. A period of drought begins in the surrounding countryside, seriously damaging the local crops. (The townspeople are convinced that the beneficent intercession of the Virgin Mary has caused the area to flourish, and their belief seems to contain an element of truth for the drought beginning with the disappearance of the Blessed Mother's statue.) The French return to the town and ravage the people. Teresa is nearly raped by a French sergeant, but is saved by a band of gypsies. One of them is a handsome young man for whom the French have offered a reward, calling him Guido the Gypsy (Vittorio Gassman). He is the gypsies' leader. He has Michael's watch, which he gives Teresa when she reacts to the tune that plays when the case is opened (Michael had shown her the watch before.). Guido's brother, Carlito (Carlos Rivas), had remarked that he took it from a dead Englishman. Hearing this Teresa is aghast. When the gypsy named Flaco (Walter Slezak) mentions that he had seen the girl at the convent, he laughingly says, \\"A Christian gypsy - that's a joke.\\" As the other gypsies also laugh, Teresa, now angry with God, denounces Christianity as a lie that deceives its believers. To make her point she rips off a necklace with a crucifix and throws it to the ground, screaming that she is no Christian. What Teresa doesn't know is that Michael has been captured and taken to a prison camp. After some time he escapes and returns to the convent to take Teresa with him to England to marry her. He's too late, the Mother Superior informs him, \\"Teresa is now the Bride of Christ,\\" meaning that she has taken her final vows and is now a fully professed nun. Michael pushes past her only to find \\"Teresa\\" in full habit - actually the Virgin Mary impersonating her - in a procession singing \\"Ave Regina Coelarum\\" (\\"Hail, Queen of Heaven\\"). Disillusioned, he leaves to return to duty. Meanwhile, Teresa, believing Michael dead, falls in love with Guido. The resentful Carlitos, is eaten up by envy and jealousy. On the eve of their wedding, Guido is betrayed to the French by Carlitos. A detachment of soldiers sweeps the gypsy camp pushing Carlitos before them to show them the way. The soldiers shoot a number of men, including Guido. After the French captain tosses a bag of gold to Carlitos, he is in turn shot to death by La Roca, the two men's mother (Katina Paxinou) for betraying his brother. In agony La Roca turns on the despondent Teresa as the cause of this disaster and banishes her from the camp. Flaco decides to act as Teresa's protector as they begin to wander Spain together. Coming to Madrid, Teresa flirts with Cordoba (Gustavo Rojo), a bullfighter while being pursued by the wealthy Count Casimir (Dennis King) who finances her career as a singer. The bullfighter is gored in the bullring while smiling at her, deepening Teresa's belief that she the cause of his death as, she believes, she was for Michael and the two gypsy brothers, \\"I'm bad luck to anyone who shows me any kindness or affection,\\" as she once told Flaco. She also abandons the portrait Casimir had commissioned from \\"my friend, Goya,\\" leaving him in despair when he discovers her sudden departure. During the next four years Teresa travels the Continent becoming a celebrated singer. In Belgium on a concert tour, a special ball is being prepared for the British officers stationed there before they again meet the armies of Napoleon, now escaped from Elba. In her carriage, Teresa catches sight of a British colonel - it is Michael. The two lovers attend the ball. On the terrace Teresa asks Michael why, after his escape, he did not come back for her. But he did, Michael tells her. In fact he is surprised to see her, considering that he had seen her in nun's habit after taking final vows. She persuades him that he must have hallucinated this while he was lying ill at the prison camp. Michael agrees. At the same time he does recall that the statue of the Madonna had disappeared. This news distresses Teresa even more; because she had so loved the statue. Just then word comes to Colonel Stuart that Michael's uncle, the Duke of Wellington, has called all officers to join their ranks. The ball had been allowed to go on as a ruse to fool all the spies infesting Belgium (this is an actual historical event). Michael asks Teresa to pray for him. Teresa has now come to a crossroad. Because she believes herself cursed she is terrified that Michael will die in battle for having loved her. She goes to a church to pray. There she makes her peace with God, asking Him to keep Michael safe so that he may return to his own people, and not to her. Leaving word with the parish priest, she decides to return to the convent and leaves with Flaco in a coach. The next day, Michael leads the cavalry charge that finally breaks the ranks of Napoleon's soldiers. A cannonball explodes near him. Wellington sees Michael fall from his horse. Bodies litter the field but Michael comes to his senses. Picking up his helmet, he sees where shrapnel has torn a slice across it. It appears that Michael has been saved through divine intervention. Michael returns to Teresa's flat. She has sent the priest to tell him of her decision and to deliver a letter to him in which Teresa begs Michael not to follow her. She must return to her true vocation. In anguish Michael asks the priest for his spiritual guidance, knowing that he must respect Teresa's choice and do what is right by letting her go. Back in Salamanca Teresa finds the region suffering a drought \\"for four years now,\\" as a woman tells her - ever since the statue of Mary disappeared. Bidding farewell to Flaco, Teresa enters the chapel she'd left so long ago and prays. Weeping, she prostrates herself on the floor as the Blessed Virgin enters, pauses to bless her, and then returns to the pedestal that had been for so long vacant. When she looks up, Teresa finds the statue returned to its pedestal and gazes on it in awe. Immediately, a thunderstorm erupts, the drought is over. The joyous people of the town come to the chapel of the convent, including Flaco. As the nuns assemble for prayer, they are struck with the realization that the statue of the Virgin Mary is back in its place and Teresa is kneeling in front of it, properly habited, firmly in prayer. Everyone is struck by what is considered the miraculous reappearance of the statue and join in singing Mozart's beautiful motet, Ave verum corpus.

In 1912 Reinhardt sold the world-wide film rights to Joseph Menchen, who produced the first authorised film of The Miracle in December 1912. Menchen sold the US, Canadian and all-Americas film rights to A. H. Woods for $25,000, who showed the film in New York City in 1913. A 1924 Reinhardt co-production with Morris Gest in New York starring Lady Diana Cooper aroused interest in a re-make by Metro-Goldwyn Pictures with Menchen's involvement. However, Woods sold his rights to First National Pictures, whose ownership was established in a judgement of the New York Supreme Court in First National Pictures, Inc. and Woods v. Metro-Goldwyn Pictures & Menchen et al., October 1927. Warner Bros. acquired a majority interest in First National in 1928, and along with it the film rights to The Miracle. Various scripts were written over the intervening years by ,Steindorff was a German essayist, translator, playwright and journalist. He worked under the pseudonym Ulrich S. Carrington after emigrating to the US in 1933.He was an uncredited scriptwriter for Chetniks! The Fighting Guerrillas. Source: Wolfgang Reinhardt, and James Hilton, among others. The film was scheduled for filming in 1942, and was to have been presented in a four-hour version produced by Wolfgang Reinhardt, son of Max Reinhardt. However, the project was shelved until 1958, when a script from Frank Butler was announced as film-able. The movie was to be shot in the Cinemiracle process in association with National Theatres, but this did not happen. While the original play and film had been set in medieval times, this version was set during the Napoleonic era in Spain – its climax involved the Battle of Waterloo, with Torin Thatcher making a cameo appearance as Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington (Napoleon is never seen in the film). =Casting= Following her success in Baby Doll, Carroll Baker turned down parts in God's Little Acre and Too Much, Too Soon. Warner Bros put her under suspension for refusing the latter; she agreed to play The Miracle for the studio, in part because the role was \\"sympathetic\\" and similar to a \\"feminine Faust\\". It is possible that Carroll Baker was selected to star in the production as a way for Warner Brothers to make peace with the Catholic Church in the United States and \\"rehabilitate\\" her reputation in the eyes of the Church. The Legion of Decency, a Catholic film review board, had denounced Baker's suggestive performance in Baby Doll four years earlier, placing that film on its \\"Condemned\\" list. Such a drastic classification had seldom been given to any domestic releases due to the strict enforcement of the Motion Picture Production Code in the film industry. Francis Cardinal Spellman, then archbishop of New York, had even gone so far as to threaten excommunication to any Catholic going to see Baby Doll. The film's poor box office reflected the Catholic boycott. Roger Moore was signed by Warner Bros to a long-term contract. =Shooting= Filming took place between July and November 1958 in part on location at the Santa Susana Mountains. \\"Our director was a humorless jerk,\\" recalled Baker later. \\"Roger [Moore] took so much abuse from Irving Rapper that I was appalled, but he took it like a man and went on to do a very professional job.\\"\\"Carroll Baker Interview\\" Roger Moore Official Site accessed 15 Oct 2014 Rapper later said the \\"main trouble\\" on the film \\"was casting. The girl who played the nun [Baker] was thrust on me without a test. I was furious. I was floored. The whole thing was unspeakably bad because of her. I didn't even talk to her.\\" \\"I was difficult,\\" admitted Baker. \\"I always wanted things my way. I wanted things to be artistically wonderful, and when I worked with a bad director when I did with The Miracle, I was jumping all over him and saying, \\"No, you can't do that\\" and \\"No, you're not going to have me do this.\\" I was very difficult. He worked with Bette Davis and she was difficult, so I guess the studio thought he would be able to handle me. Obviously I was more difficult than Bette Davis.\\" It was Katrina Paxinou's first film in Hollywood since appearing in For Whom the Bell Tolls 15 years earlier. \\"All the people I know are gone,\\" she said during filming. \\"Where are they? The whole personality of Hollywood has changed. It's not colourful anymore; it's a dull neutral.\\" Reception Not presented as a pantomime but as a regular epic, the 1959 film was panned by critics, and had the misfortune to be released to theatres the same week as MGM's widescreen remake of Ben-Hur starring Charlton Heston – one of the most successful epic films of all time. Even worse, Warner Bros. had earlier that same year released The Nun's Story, a film starring Audrey Hepburn in which the main character was also a nun having doubts about her vocation, as in The Miracle. The Nun's Story had been a commercial and critical smash hit, gaining several Oscar nominations. Both that film and The Miracle were produced by Henry Blanke, and most likely, one drew unfavorable comparisons with the other. It was not released in Great Britain until December 26, 1960, accompanied by a large advertising campaign for its ABC circuit release. Carroll Baker claims the film made money at the box office but says she disliked it so much she bought out her contract with Warner Bros. This cost her a considerable amount of money and she later wrote that she regretted the decision. =Home video= The film, which was originally shot in wide screen Technirama and Technicolor and projected with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio was issued on videocassette in a cropped 4 x 3 Pan and Scan transfer in 1997, appearing on DVD in a Korean subtitled version. Warner Archive have been intending to release a restored 2.35:1 wide screen DVD transfer of the film for some time, but their plans have been delayed due to technical problems with the original film elements.

The department is under the Transport and Housing Bureau. The Transport Department was created on 1 December 1968 as a separate department within the Hong Kong Government. Prior to 1968 it was assigned to the Transport Office under the Colonial Secretary's department. History The Transport Office was founded in 1965 within the Colonial Secretariat, initially with a staff of 23. The office was set up in response to the territory's worsening traffic problems, and was modelled after the systems in Britain and other Commonwealth countries, with the new department taking responsibility for vehicle registration and driver licensing. In 1968, it was spun off as a separate government department, and was renamed as the Transport Department. In 1974, the department's headquarters moved from the Blake Block on Queensway to the new Murray Road Multi-storey Car Park Building. Around the same time, the department's Chinese name changed from \\"\\" to \\"\\" to avoid confusion with the similar Chinese name of the Traffic Branch of the Royal Hong Kong Police. The department's role expanded significantly in April 1982, when it absorbed the Traffic and Transport Branch of the Highways Office of the former Public Works Department. Units that moved to the Transport Department at this time were responsible for traffic engineering, traffic control and surveillance, road safety, and traffic surveys. In 2019, the Transport Department headquarters moved from Immigration Tower to the new West Kowloon Government Offices in Yau Ma Tei.

Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) also known as core-binding factor subunit alpha-1 (CBF-alpha-1) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the RUNX2 gene. RUNX2 is a key transcription factor associated with osteoblast differentiation. It has also been suggested that Runx2 plays a cell proliferation regulatory role in cell cycle entry and exit in osteoblasts, as well as endothelial cells. Runx2 suppresses pre- osteoblast proliferation by affecting cell cycle progression in the G1 phase. In osteoblasts, the levels of Runx2 is highest in G1 phase and is lowest in S, G2, and M. The comprehensive cell cycle regulatory mechanisms that Runx2 may play are still unknown, although it is generally accepted that the varying activity and levels of Runx2 throughout the cell cycle contribute to cell cycle entry and exit, as well as cell cycle progression. These functions are especially important when discussing bone cancer, particularly osteosarcoma development, that can be attributed to aberrant cell proliferation control.  Function  = Osteoblast differentiation = This protein is a member of the RUNX family of transcription factors and has a Runt DNA-binding domain. It is essential for osteoblastic differentiation and skeletal morphogenesis. It acts as a scaffold for nucleic acids and regulatory factors involved in skeletal gene expression. The protein can bind DNA both as a monomer or, with more affinity, as a subunit of a heterodimeric complex. Transcript variants of the gene that encode different protein isoforms result from the use of alternate promoters as well as alternate splicing. The cellular dynamics of Runx2 protein are also important for proper osteoblast differentiation. Runx2 protein is detected in preosteoblasts and the expression is upregulated in immature osteoblasts and downregulated in mature osteoblasts. It is the first transcription factor required for determination of osteoblast commitment, followed by Sp7 and Wnt-signaling. Runx2 is responsible for inducing the differentiation of multipotent mesenchymal cells into immature osteoblasts, as well as activating expression of several key downstream proteins that maintain osteoblast differentiation and bone matrix genes. Knock-out of the DNA-binding activity results in inhibition of osteoblastic differentiation. Because of this, Runx2 is often referred to as the master regulator of bone. = Cell cycle regulation = In addition to being the master regulator of osteoblast differentiation, Runx2 has also been shown to play several roles in cell cycle regulation. This is due, in part, to the fact that Runx2 interacts with many cellular proliferation genes on a transcription level, such as c-Myb and C/EBP, as well as p53/ These functions are critical for osteoblast proliferation and maintenance. This is often controlled via oscillating levels of Runx2 within throughout cell cycle due to regulated degradation and transcriptional activity. Oscillating levels of Runx2 within the cell contribute to cell cycle dynamics. In the MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cell line, Runx2 levels are a maximum during G1 and a minimum during G2, S, and mitosis. In addition, the oscillations in Runx2 contribute to G1-related anti- proliferative function. It has also been proposed that decreasing levels of Runx2 leads to cell cycle exit for proliferating and differentiating osteoblasts, and that Runx2 plays a role in mediating the final stages of osteoblast via this mechanism. Current research posits that the levels of Runx2 serve various functions. In addition, Runx2 has been shown to interact with several kinases that contribute to facilitate cell-cycle dependent dynamics via direct protein phosphorylation. Furthermore, Runx2 controls the gene expression of cyclin D2, D3, and the CDK inhibitor p21(cip1) in hematopoietic cells. It has been shown that on a molecular level, Runx associates with the cdc2 partner cyclin B1 during mitosis. The phosphorylation state of Runx2 also mediates its DNA-binding activity. The Runx2 DNA-binding activity is correlated with cellular proliferation, which suggests Runx2 phosphorylation may also be related to Runx2-mediated cellular proliferation and cell cycle control. To support this, it has been noted that Runx is phosphorylated at Ser451 by cdc2 kinase, which facilitates cell cycle progression through the regulation of G2 and M phases. Schematic of Runx2 Levels During Cell Cycle Progression Pathology = Cleidocranial dysplasia = Mutations in Runx2 are associated with the disease Cleidocranial dysostosis. One study proposes that this phenotype arises partly due to the Runx2 dosage insufficiencies. Because Runx2 promotes exit from the cell cycle, insufficient amounts of Runx2 are related to increased proliferation of osteoblasts observed in patients with cleodocranial disostosis. = Osteosarcoma = Variants of Runx2 have been associated with the osteosarcoma phenotype. Current research suggests that this is partly due to the role of Runx2 in mitigating the cell cycle. Runx2 plays a role as a tumor suppressor of osteoblasts by halting cell cycle progression at G1. Compared to normal osteoblast cell line MC3T3-E1, the oscillations of Runx2 in osteosarcoma ROS and SaOS cell lines are aberrant when compared to the oscillations of Runx2 levels in normal osteoblasts, suggesting that deregulation of Runx2 levels may contribute to abnormal cell proliferation by an inability to escape the cell cycle. Molecularly, It has been proposed that proteasome inhibition by MG132 can stabilize Runx2 protein levels in late G1 and S in MC3T3 cells, but not in osteosarcoma cells which consequently leads to a cancerous phenotype. Regulation and co-factors Due to its role as a master transcription factor of osteoblast differentiation, the regulation of Runx2 is intricately connected to other processes within the cell. Twist, Msh homeobox 2 (Msx2), and promyeloctic leukemia zinc-finger protein (PLZF) act upstream of Runx2. Osterix (Osx) acts downstream of Runx2 and serves as a marker for normal osteoblast differentiation. Zinc finger protein 521 (ZFP521) and activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) are cofactors of Runx2. Furthermore, in proliferating chondrocytes, Runx2 is inhibited by CyclinD1/CDK4 as part of the cell cycle.  Interactions  RUNX2 has been shown to interact with: * AR * ER-α * C-Fos, * C-jun, * HDAC3, * MYST4, * SMAD1 * SMAD3, and * STUB1. miR-133 and CyclinD1/CDK4 directly inhibits Runx2.

The village and the manor house are mentioned in the Domesday Book in 1086 - with the entry reading: Malpertesselle/Maperteshale: Gilbert FitzSolomon. The Manor House belonged to the De Meppershall family for nearly 300 years following 1086; however, the present house is early 17th century. Until 1844 Meppershall was partially in Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire. The detached portion of Hertfordshire was transferred to Bedfordshire in 1844, following the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844. Meppershall manor house St. Mary's church dates back to the Normans. The Parish Records of St Mary, Meppershall, have been published on CD by the Parochial Church Council.Parochial Church Council Information February 2011. Before the advent of greenhouses, Meppershall was a very poor community with large families living in two up, two down type thatched cottages built of brick with stone floors. However so many greenhouses were built in the village that it was known as \\"glass city\\" growing salad crops for local markets and shipped further afield via the railway. As well as farming the village earned its income from coprolite digging. Coprolite is the fossilised dung of pre- historic creatures, which when ground and treated with sulphuric acid produces a superphosphate fertiliser. To extract it a long trench was dug on one side of a field. The overlaying clay was then dug out until the nodule bed was reached. If the depth of clay to be removed was more than eight to nine feet, the trench was made in two or three steps and as the nodules were taken out, so the trench was re-filled with the earth already removed. The nodule bed was shovelled into barrows and taken to the washing mill. This consisted of a circular iron trough with a pivot in the centre to which a set of travelling rakes was attached, these being dragged round by horses and a constant stream of water was kept running through the trough until the clay washed off. The dirty water then was drained off and the nodules carted away. The coprolite was worth about £3 a ton in 1890, yielding some 300 tons per acre. A good fossil digger could earn as much as £2 a week. This industry has also died out.

It was originally developed for food canning and has found applications in cosmetics, producing salmonella-free feeds for animals (e.g. poultry) and pharmaceuticals. History In 1895, William Lyman Underwood of the Underwood Canning Company, a food company founded in 1822 at Boston, Massachusetts and later relocated to Watertown, Massachusetts, approached William Thompson Sedgwick, chair of the biology department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, about losses his company was suffering due to swollen and burst cans despite the newest retort technology available. Sedgwick gave his assistant, Samuel Cate Prescott, a detailed assignment on what needed to be done. Prescott and Underwood worked on the problem every afternoon from late 1895 to late 1896, focusing on canned clams. They first discovered that the clams contained heat-resistant bacterial spores that were able to survive the processing; then that these spores' presence depended on the clams' living environment; and finally that these spores would be killed if processed at 250 ˚F (121 ˚C) for ten minutes in a retort. These studies prompted the similar research of canned lobster, sardines, peas, tomatoes, corn, and spinach. Prescott and Underwood's work was first published in late 1896, with further papers appearing from 1897 to 1926. This research, though important to the growth of food technology, was never patented. It would pave the way for thermal death time research that was pioneered by Bigelow and C. Olin Ball from 1921 to 1936 at the National Canners Association (NCA). Bigelow and Ball's research focused on the thermal death time of Clostridium botulinum (C. botulinum) that was determined in the early 1920s. Research continued with inoculated canning pack studies that were published by the NCA in 1968. Mathematical formulas Thermal death time can be determined one of two ways: 1) by using graphs or 2) by using mathematical formulas. =Graphical method= This is usually expressed in minutes at the temperature of . This is designated as F0. Each 18 °F or 10 °C change results in a time change by a factor of 10. This would be shown either as F10121 = 10 minutes (Celsius) or F18250 = 10 minutes (Fahrenheit). A lethal ratio (L) is also a sterilizing effect at 1 minute at other temperatures with (T). :L = 10^{(T - T_\\\\mathrm{Ref})/z} where TRef is the reference temperature, usually ; z is the z-value, and T is the slowest heat point of the product temperature. =Formula method= Prior to the advent of computers, this was plotted on semilogarithmic paper though it can also be done on spreadsheet programs. The time would be shown on the x-axis while the temperature would be shown on the y-axis. This simple heating curve can also determine the lag factor (j) and the slope (fh). It also measures the product temperature rather than the can temperature. : j = {jI \\\\over I} where I = RT (Retort Temperature) − IT (Initial Temperature) and where j is constant for a given product. It is also determined in the equation shown below: :\\\\log g = \\\\log jI - {B_B \\\\over f_h} where g is the number of degrees below the retort temperature on a simple heating curve at the end of the heating period, BB is the time in minutes from the beginning of the process to the end of the heating period, and fh is the time in minutes required for the straight-line portion of the heating curve plotted semilogarithmically on paper or a computer spreadsheet to pass through a log cycle. A broken heating curve is also used in this method when dealing with different products in the same process such as chicken noodle soup in having to dealing with the meat and the noodles having different cooking times as an example. It is more complex than the simple heating curve for processing. Applications In the food industry, it is important to reduce the number of microbes in products to ensure proper food safety. This is usually done by thermal processing and finding ways to reduce the number of bacteria in the product. Time-temperature measurements of bacterial reduction is determined by a D-value, meaning how long it would take to reduce the bacterial population by 90% or one log10 at a given temperature. This D-value reference (DR) point is . z or z-value is used to determine the time values with different D-values at different temperatures with its equation shown below: :z = \\\\frac{T_2 - T_1}{\\\\log D_1 - \\\\log D_2} where T is temperature in °F or °C. This D-value is affected by pH of the product where low pH has faster D values on various foods. The D-value at an unknown temperature can be calculated knowing the D-value at a given temperature provided the Z-value is known. The target of reduction in canning is the 12-D reduction of C. botulinum, which means that processing time will reduce the amount of this bacteria by a factor of 1012. The DR for C. botulinum is 0.21 minute (12.6 seconds). A 12-D reduction will take 2.52 minutes (151 seconds). This is taught in university courses in food science and microbiology and is applicable to cosmetic and pharmaceutical manufacturing. In 2001, the Purdue University Computer Integrated Food Manufacturing Center and Pilot Plant put Ball's formula online for use. References *Downing, D.L. (1996).

The screenplay, by Jimmy Sangster, was adapted from Bill MacIlwraith's 1966 play. Plot One- eyed Mrs. Taggart is an emasculating woman whose husband, a successful building contractor, has been dead for ten years. Joining her for the traditional annual celebration of her wedding anniversary are her three sons: eldest Henry is a transvestite; middle son Terry is planning to emigrate to Canada with his shrewish wife Karen and their five children; and youngest Tom, a promiscuous philanderer whose many past relationships have ended at his mother's insistence, arrives with his pregnant girlfriend Shirley in town. Throughout the day and evening, the domineering, evil, vindictive, manipulative matriarch does everything in her power to remind her children who controls the family finances and ultimately their futures.

Background Founded in 1863 by Takasugi Shinsaku, the Kiheitai militia consisted of 300 men, who came from all social classes, including farmers, merchants, samurai and others. Most were from Chōshū, but a few volunteers were from other domains. The Kiheitai was known for its discipline, and use of western-style weapons and military techniques. It was partly funded by the Chōshū domain, but gained the rest of its financial support through donations by wealthy merchants and farmers. Kiheitai followed a developing trend which had been spearheaded by the shogunate following the Convention of Kanagawa to form military units based on ability rather than hereditary social status. Shinsengumi, a Kyoto- based, pro-Tokugawa police force, was founded in the same year as Kiheitai, and was also composed of people from a broad variety of social classes. Battles The Kiheitai militia saw action in the Bombardment of Shimonoseki in 1864, during which the fleets of Great Britain, France, the Netherlands, and the United States fired upon the Chōshū port city of Shimonoseki, and subsequently landed troops. As the military arm of the pro-reform faction within the Chōshū domain, the Kiheitai helped overthrow the pro-bakufu faction in the Chōshū civil war, repulsed the Second Chōshū expedition sent by the Tokugawa bakufu in 1866. Around the same time, the Second Kiheitai was formed in the Suō Province. Takasugi died of tuberculosis in 17 May 1867, his Kiheitai militia was taken over by his protégé Yamagata Aritomo. The Kiheitai militia played an important role in the Boshin War, which led to the Meiji Restoration. Disbandment The Kiheitai was disbanded in 1868, with total enlistment of 622 men since 1863. The success of the socially mixed unit and its Western armaments and tactics was an important influence on the development of the Imperial Japanese Army, and on the later system of universal military conscription in Japan. Other usage The forces defending Aizuwakamatsu during the Boshin War, and the forces of Saigō Takamori in the Satsuma Rebellion also used the term kiheitai to describe themselves.  Kiheitai in media  * The Kiheitai appeared in an expansion of Creative Assembly's Total War: Shogun 2, Fall of the Samurai as special units of the Chōshū Domain. They are featured as an elite unit, having below-par statistics with other late game elite infantry but requiring less money and time to recruit and maintain, and can be recruited on unlimited number unlike other elite units. * In Rurouni Kenshin the Kiheitai is seen in a number of flashbacks as the title character, Kenshin, was recruited into the force by Takasugi Shinsaku himself. * In Gintama the Kiheitai also appears as a terrorist faction led by Gintoki's old friend turned enemy, Shinsuke Takasugi, who is loosely based on Takasugi Shinsaku.

He was accused of promoting the \\"taxation\\" of the illegal drug trade in Colombia to raise funds for the FARC.Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs He had been formally sentenced in absence for the deaths of 13 policemen and 18 soldiers, 18 kidnappings and the deaths of a judge, a physician, three judicial auxiliaries, the ex-minister of Culture Consuelo Araújo, the congressman Diego Turbay and his mother, Catholic monsignor Isaías Duarte, Governor of Antioquia Guillermo Gaviria, the Colombian ex-minister Gilberto Echeverri, 11 members of the Valle del Cauca Assembly and at least four other persons. Most of these persons were kidnapped before their deaths. Gaviria, Echeverri and Araújo were killed by shots in the head when Colombian military forces stormed the camps where they were held by guerrilla insurgents. He was also found responsible for bombing Club El Nogal in Bogotá where 36 people were killed. The Government of Paraguay had asked for his extradition for his participation in the kidnapping and death of Cecilia Cubas, daughter of the ex-president of Paraguay, who was kidnapped on September 21, 2004, and whose body was found in an abandoned house in February 2005. Before his death the United States Department of State was offering a reward of up to US$5 million for information leading to his arrest. He was also included in Interpol's \\"red list\\".Muere el guerrillero de las FARC con mayor proyección internacional. Diario 2001. Consultado el 01/03/2008. Colombian authorities believed that Raúl Reyes moved through the southern Colombian frontier, especially in Putumayo Department, along the border with Ecuador. In late 2006, his possible presence in Ecuadorian territory was denounced by Colombian President Álvaro Uribe, while Ecuador's authorities rejected the claim, admitting only temporary FARC \\"infiltrations\\". Colombian Army General German Galvis repeated this claim in October 2006. Negotiations with Wall Street In June 1999, during peace negotiations with the government of Andrés Pastrana, Reyes met in the Colombian savannah with Richard Grasso, then chairman of the New York Stock Exchange. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss investment opportunities for the FARC. The two men were photographed in an embrace which became known as the \\"Grasso abrazo.\\"http://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/0202/feb12fab54a8589b4b0e.jpeg Death Reyes was killed during a Colombian military operation in Granada, Putumayo Department, on March 1, 2008, against an encampment situated near Santa Rosa de Sucumbíos, on the Ecuadorian side of the border along the Putumayo River. Previously, in February 2008, the FBI and DEA had assisted the Colombian government in tracing a satellite phone call made by Reyes to Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez in which they discussed the release of hostages. Reyes’ location was traced to an encampment located a mile across Colombia’s southern border in neighboring Ecuador — the government of which had earlier denied reports of Reyes’ presence.

According to the Ecuadorian government the attack happened from the border inside Ecuador’s territory, and it was a planned air strike followed by the incursion of Colombian troops transported by helicopters. The attack left a total of 20 guerrilla members dead in Ecuadorian territory, many of them wearing underwear or sleeping clothes. According to Ecuadorean president Rafael Correa, the Super Tucanos war planes entered in Ecuador's territory and struck while flying north, followed by troops who came by helicopters and completed the attack. The Ecuadorean president announced that a diplomatic note would be sent in protest, claiming that the action was a violation of Ecuador's airspace. Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez called the attack \\"a cowardly murder\\", and reacted by moving troops near the border with Colombia and recalling all personnel from the Venezuelan embassy in Colombia,Chavez laments killing of FARC commander saying that doing something similar inside Venezuela would be a \\"cause for war\\". Eventually the dispute did not escalate beyond a war of words. Diplomatic meetings and an apology from Colombian president Álvaro Uribe resolved the crisis a week later. Aftermath Colombian government officials have seized documentsArticle en \\"El Tiempo\\" newspaper (Bogotá, May 4, 2008 – in Spanish) that, according to a spokesman for EX Colombian President Álvaro Uribe, show Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa \\"has a relationship and commitments with FARC\\", and, according to the Colombian National Police Director Oscar Naranjo, Reyes had met Ecuador's minister of internal security to discuss an \\"interest in making official relations with the FARC\\". According to Colombian authorities, the three laptop computers seized were found to hold extensive information about the FARC, their operations and connections. The Colombian government handed over the three PCs and their ancillary devices to a team of Interpol experts, for a period of two weeks. Interpol's analysis had a limited scope, toward the sole objective of certifying whether the information was or was not altered in any way by the Colombian government, and not to examine the contents of the documents themselves. The Interpol report concluded that the key documents were unharmed and unmodified, but noted that the devices had been operated and accessed without write protection after their seizure. Over 3,500 files had date stamps indicating they had been created or modified in the future and the report concluded that \\"these files were originally created prior to March 1, 2008 on a device or devices with incorrect system time settings.\\"Venezuelanalysis.com, May 16, 2008, Interpol's Report Confirms that the Supposed FARC Computers Were Manipulated The Interpol's list of information recovered from the devices mentions over 30,000 written documents and more than 7,000 e-mail addresses. On June 15, 2008, Interpol issued a new press release in response to a statement by Ecuador's Foreign Ministry that the international organization considered to be incorrect. The press release stated that \\"[Ecuador] inaccurately suggests that Interpol had not established whether the eight seized exhibits forensically examined by Interpol's computer forensic experts had been recovered by Colombian authorities on March 1, 2008 from a FARC camp or belonged to Raul Reyes. In fact, based on a review of all the information and material provided by Colombia, including a classified oral briefing, Interpol was able to satisfy itself, and clearly stated in its report, that the seized computer exhibits it was requested to forensically examine were taken from the FARC terrorist camp on March 1, 2008 and belonged to Raul Reyes.\\" Interpol also added \\"that validating the contents of the computer exhibits were not manipulated after their seizure by Colombian authorities is not in any way, shape or form the same as saying that the contents of the user files are true and accurate. Interpol therefore objects to those who suggest that Interpol's report validates the source and accuracy of any particular document or user file contained therein.\\" On March 16, 2010 Hugo Chávez admitted having had a meeting with Reyes at an indeterminate date during Pastrana's government.

House Select Committee on Assassinations Downing was appointed Chairman of the House Select Committee on Assassinations by Carl Albert, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. The Committee was tasked to look into evidence that was not available to the Warren Commission during its investigation of the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Upon his retirement from Congress in 1977, Louis Stokes succeeded Downing as Chairman. Downing stated before and after the HSCA's investigation that he believed there was a conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy. He pushed for a House committee to investigate the assassination nearly two years before its formation. In August 1976, he released affidavits from two men who stated that Richard Nixon approved the plan of a right-wing Cuban exile to \\"eliminate\\" left-wing Cuban exiles after the Bay of Pigs invasion. Downing said that their statements raised the possibility that right-wing Cubans killed Kennedy. Downing said that he was skeptical that Lee Harvey Oswald could accurately fire a bolt- action rifle within a short span of time, and he believed video footage of the assassination showed that Kennedy was struck from the front and the rear. According to a theory provided by Downing, one which he said was without evidence and based on speculation, anti-Castro Cuban exiles killed Kennedy due to his failure to support them after the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion. Downing stated that they expected pro-Castro Cubans would be blamed for the assassination in retaliation for the attempted assassination of Fidel Castro by United States agents. Downing said: \\"I am firmly convinced, I am sincerely convinced, that more than one person was shooting at President Kennedy in Dallas that day. It is so obvious to me.\\" Downing described JFK, Oliver Stone's 1991 film about the assassination of Kennedy, as \\"implausible\\". He said: \\"It's impossible to tell where fact stops and fiction starts, it blends in so well.\\" Prior to the investigation, James J. Kilpatrick described Downing as \\"a man of exception integrity and common sense\\" yet \\"not altogether unbiased in the matter of Kennedy's assassination\\". Robert P. Gemberling, head of the FBI's investigation of the assassination for thirteen years after the release of the Warren Commission's report, said in 1976 that Downing and his successor, Henry B. Gonzalez, had \\"preconceived conspiracy theories\\".

It was incorporated by an Act of Parliament on 6 August 1897, which authorised the building of a line between Brierley Junction, on the main line of the Hull and Barnsley Railway, to junctions with the Great Northern Railway and the Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway south east of Doncaster. Although the line was considered an independent company it was worked by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR). It opened in sections over 7 years from 1902. History and description Construction was complete by 1908-9 the work being carried out by contractors Naylor Bros., Gates and Hogg, Henry Lovatt, and Whittaker Bros. At first, only goods traffic was carried. Passenger trains came to the line on 3 June 1912 running between Wakefield Kirkgate and Edlington with intermediate halts serving Ryhill, Grimethorpe, Great Houghton, Goldthorpe and Thurnscoe, Harlington and Denaby. The LYR amalgamated with the London and North Western Railway on 1 January 1922; the combined organisation (also known as the London and North Western Railway) absorbed the DVR on the same day. It duly passed to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway on 1 January 1923. Passenger services ceased on 10 September 1951, the last trains having run on 9 September. Goods traffic continued but several changes were made to the track layout. The lines between (near) Grimethorpe Colliery and Brierley Junction and from Grimethorpe Colliery and Edlington were closed on the opening of a new connection from the Midland Railway's main line near Houghton in 1966. The Dearne Valley connection to Yorkshire Main Colliery at Edlington was removed in May 1972, the colliery being served by a connection to St. Catherine's Junction on the South Yorkshire Joint Railway, the junctions here being rebuilt in connection with the Doncaster area re- signalling in early May 1977.

Origin of Islamic China According to traditional Chinese Muslim accounts, the history of Islam in China began when four Ṣaḥābā—Sa‘d ibn Abī Waqqās (594–674), Ja'far ibn Abi Talib, and Jahsh preached in 616/17 and onwards in China after coming from Chittagong-Kamrup-Manipur route after sailing from Abyssinia in 615/16. Sa‘d ibn Abi Waqqas again headed for China for the third time in 650–51 after Caliph ‘Uthman asked him to lead an embassy to China, which the Chinese emperor received warmly. The Huaisheng Mosque is one of the oldest mosques in the world, traditionally believed to have been built by Sa\`d ibn Abi Waqqas. =China-Arab Trade relations= Trade existed between pre-Islamic Arabia and China's South Coast, and flourished when Arab maritime traders converted to Islam. It reached its peak under the Mongol Yuan Dynasty. China's long and interactive relationship with the various steppe tribes and empires, through trade, war, subordination or domination paved the way for a large sustained Islamic community within China. Islamic influence came from the various steppe peoples who assimilated in Chinese culture. Muslims served as administrators, generals, and other leaders who were transferred to China from Persia and Central Asia to administer the empire under the Mongols. Muslims in China have managed to practice their faith in China, sometimes against great odds, since the seventh century. Islam is one of the religions that is still officially recognized in China. = History = According to the historical accounts of Chinese Muslims, Islam was first brought to China by Sa'd ibn abi Waqqas, who came to China for the third time at the head of an embassy sent by Uthman, the third Caliph, in 651, less than twenty years after the death of prophet Muhammad. The embassy was led by Sa\`d ibn Abī Waqqās. Emperor Gaozong, the Tang emperor who received the envoy then ordered the construction of the Memorial mosque in Canton, the first mosque in the country, in memory of the prophet. Hui legends seem to confuse the 651 visit with the initiation of Islam as early as 616/17 by earlier visits of Sahabas. While modern historians tend to argue that there is no evidence for Waqqās himself ever coming to China, they do believe that Muslim diplomats and merchants arrived in Tang China within a few decades from the beginning of Middle Ages (Hijra). The Tang Dynasty's cosmopolitan culture, with its intensive contacts with Central Asia and its significant communities of (originally non-Muslim) Central and Western Asian merchants resident in Chinese cities, which helped the introduction of Islam. Tang dynasty The Great Mosque of Xi'an, one of China's oldest mosques Arab people are first noted in Chinese written records, under the name Ta shi in the annals of the Tang Dynasty (618-907) (Ta shi or Da shi is the Chinese rendering of Tazi—the name the Persian people used for the Arabs). Records dating from 713 speak of the arrival of a Da shi ambassador. The first major Muslim settlements in China consisted of Arab and Persian merchants.Israeli (2002), pg. 291 Despite conflict between the Tang and the Abbasids during the Battle of Talas in 751, relations between the two states improved soon after. In 756, a contingent probably consisting of Persians and Iraqis was sent to Kansu to help the emperor Su-Tsung in his struggle against the rebellion of An Lushan. Less than 50 years later, an alliance was concluded between the Tang and the Abbasids against Tibetan attacks in Central Asia. A mission from the Caliph Harun al-Rashid (766-809) arrived at Chang'an.Gernet, Jacques. A History of Chinese Civilization. 2. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1996. It is recorded that in 758, a large Muslim settlement in Guangzhou erupted in unrest and the people fled. The community had constructed a large mosque (Huaisheng Mosque), destroyed by fire in 1314, and constructed in 1349-51; only ruins of a tower remain from the first building. During the Tang Dynasty, a steady stream of Arab (Ta'shi) and Persian (Po'si) traders arrived in China through the silk road and the overseas route through the port of Quanzhou. Not all of the immigrants were Muslims, but many of those who stayed formed the basis of the Chinese Muslim population and the Hui ethnic group. The Persian immigrants introduced polo, their cuisine, their musical instruments, and their knowledge of medicine to China.  Song dynasty  Many Muslims went to China to trade, and these Muslims began to have a great economic impact and influence on the country. During the Song Dynasty (960-1279), Muslims in China dominated foreign trade and the import/export industry to the south and west.BBC Religion and Ethics ISLAM Origins In 1070, the Song emperor, Shen-tsung (Shenzong) invited 5,300 Muslim men from Bukhara, to settle in China. The emperor used these men in his campaign against the Liao empire in the northeast. Later on these men were settled between the Sung capital of Kaifeng and Yenching (modern-day Beijing). The object was to create a buffer zone between the Chinese and the Liao. In 1080, 10,000 Arab men and women migrated to China on horseback and settled in all of the provinces of the north and north-east.Israeli (2002), pg. 283-4 The Chinese materia medica 52 (re-published in 1968-75) was revised under the Song Dynasty in 1056 and 1107 to include material, particularly 200 medicines, taken from Ibn Sina's The Canon of Medicine. The Arabs from Bukhara were under the leadership of Prince Amir Sayyid \\"So-fei-er\\" (his Chinese name). The prince was later given an honorary title. He is reputed of being the \\"father\\" of the Muslim community in China. Prior to him Islam was named by the Tang and Song Chinese as Dashi fa (\\"law of the Arabs\\") (Tashi or Dashi is the Chinese rendering of Tazi—the name the Persian people used for the Arabs). .Israeli, Raphael (2002). Islam in China. United States of America: Lexington Books. . He renamed it to Huihui Jiao (\\"the Religion of the Huihui\\").Israeli (2002), pg. 284 =Pro-Mongol Muslims= Pu Shougeng, a Muslim foreign trader, stands out in his work to help the Yuan conquer Southern China, the last outpost of Song power. In 1276, Song loyalists launched a resistance to Mongol efforts to take over Fuzhou. The Yuanshih (Yuan dynasty official history) records that Pu Shougeng \\"abandoned the Song cause and rejected the emperor...by the end of the year, Quanzhou submitted to the Mongols.\\"In abandoning the Song cause, Pu Shougeng mobilized troops from the community of foreign residents,who massacred the Song emperor's relatives and Song loyalists.Pu Shougeng and his troops acted without the help of the Mongol army. Pu Shougeng himself was lavishly rewarded by the Mongols. He was appointed military commissioner for Fujian and Guangdong Yuan dynasty The Yuan Dynasty of China continued to maintain an excellent relationship with other nomadic tribes of Mongolia. The Mongol rulers of Yuan Dynasty elevated the status of foreigners of all religions versus the Han, Khitan, and Jurchen, and placed many foreigners such as Muslim Persians and Arabs, Turkic Christians, Jews, Tibetan Buddhist Lamas, and Buddhist Turpan Uyghurs in high-ranking posts instead of native Confucian scholars, using many Muslims in the administration of China. The territory of the Yuan was administered in 12 districts during the reign of Kublai Khan with a governor and vice-governor each. According to Iranian historian Rashidu'd-Din Fadlu'llah, of these 12 governors, 8 were Muslims; in the remaining districts, Muslims were vice-governors.Islam the Straight Path: Islam ... - Google Book Search at books.google.co.uk At the same time the Mongols imported Central Asian Muslims to serve as administrators in China, the Mongols also sent Han Chinese and Khitans from China to serve as administrators over the Muslim population in Bukhara in Central Asia, using foreigners to curtail the power of the local peoples of both lands. The state forced massive numbers of Central Asian Muslims to move into China during the Yuan period. In the fourteenth century, the total population of Muslims was 4,000,000.Israeli (2002), p. 285 It was during this time that Jamal ad-Din, a Persian astronomer, presented Kublai Khan with seven Persian astronomical instruments.Zhu (1946) Also, The Muslim architect Yeheidie'erding (Amir al- Din) learned from Han architecture and helped to design and construct the capital of the Yuan Dynasty, Dadu, otherwise known as Khanbaliq or Khanbaligh.http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/data/minorities/Hui.html The Hui ethnic minority In the mid-14th century, the Ispah Rebellion against the Mongol Yuan led by Chinese Persian Muslims broke out in South Fujian. After the rebellion was suppressed the local Han Chinese in Quanzhou turned against Semu people and great misery was brought upon Muslim population. Quanzhou itself ceased to be a leading international seaport. Genghis Khan and the following Yuan emperors forbade Islamic practices like Halal butchering, forcing Mongol methods of butchering animals (similar to Jhatka, and believed by Buddhists to induce less suffering) on Muslims, and other restrictive degrees continued. Muslims had to slaughter sheep in secret. Genghis Khan directly called Muslims and Jews \\"slaves\\", and demanded that they follow the Mongol method of eating rather than the halal method. Circumcision was also forbidden. Jews were also affected, and forbidden by the Mongols to eat Kosher. Toward the end, corruption and the persecution became so severe that Muslim generals joined Han Chinese in rebelling against the Mongols. The Ming founder Zhu Yuanzhang had Muslim generals like Lan Yu who rebelled against the Mongols and defeated them in combat. Some Muslim communities had the name in Chinese which meant \\"barracks\\" and also mean \\"thanks\\", many Hui Muslims claim it is because that they played an important role in overthrowing the Mongols and it was named in thanks by the Han Chinese for assisting them. Dadu would last until 1368 when Zhu Yuanzhang, the founder of the Ming Dynasty and future Hongwu Emperor, made his imperial ambitions known by sending an army toward the Yuan capital.Ebrey, Patricia Buckley. The Cambridge Illustrated History of China. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999. The last Yuan emperor fled north to Shangdu and Zhu declared the founding of the Ming Dynasty after razing the Yuan palaces in Dadu to the ground. The city was renamed Beiping by the Ming in the same year. Ming dynasty Chang Yuchun was a Muslim Ming Dynasty general who greatly contributed to overthrowing Mongol rule.Cheng Ho and Islam in Southeast Asia By Tan Ta Sen, Dasheng Chen, pg 170 Muslims continued to flourish in China during the Ming Dynasty. During Ming rule, the capital, Nanjing, was a center of Islamic learning.Looking East: The challenges and opportunities of Chinese Islam The Ming dynasty saw the rapid decline in the Muslim population in the sea ports. This was due to the closing of all seaport trade with the outside world. However it also saw the appointment of Muslim military generals such as Mu Ying who campaigned in Yunnan and central Shandong. These two areas became leading centers of Islamic learning in China. The emperor Zhu Yuanzhang was the founder of the Ming Dynasty. Many of his most trusted commanders were Muslims, including Hu Dahai, Mu Ying, Lan Yu, Feng Sheng and Ding Dexing. The Ming Dynasty also gave rise to the famous Muslim explorer Zheng He. Muslims in Ming dynasty Beijing were given relative freedom by the Chinese, with no restrictions placed on their religious practices or freedom of worship, and being normal citizens in Beijing. In contrast to the freedom granted to Muslims, followers of Tibetan Buddhism and Catholicism suffered from restrictions and censure in Beijing. =Integration= Both Mongol and Central Asian Semu Muslim women and men of both sexes were required by Ming Code to marry Han Chinese after the first Ming Emperor Hongwu passed the law in Article 122. Immigration slowed down drastically, however, and the Muslims in China became increasingly isolated from the rest of the Islamic world, gradually becoming more sinicized, adopting the Chinese language and Chinese dress. During this period, Muslims also began to adopt Chinese surnames. Other Muslims, who could not find a Chinese surname similar to their own, adopted the Chinese character most similar to their own - Ma (馬) for Muhammad, Mai for Mustafa, Mu for Masoud, Ha for Hasan, Hu for Hussain and Sa'I for Said and so on. The Hui, Salar, and Dongxiang are Muslims in China who use Chinese surnames. As a result, the Muslims became \\"outwardly indistinguishable\\" from the Chinese.Israeli(2002), pg. 292 In addition to names, Muslim customs of dress and food also underwent a synthesis with Chinese culture.The Islamic modes of dress and dietary rules were maintained within a Chinese cultural framework. In time, the immigrant Muslims began to speak local dialects and to read in Chinese.  Qing dynasty  Qing Dynasty (1644–1911) was ruled by the Manchus. In the Qing Dynasty, Muslims had many mosques in the large cities, with particularly important ones in Beijing, Xi'an, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, and other places (in addition to those in the western Muslim regions). The architecture typically employed traditional Chinese styles, with Arabic-language inscriptions being the chief distinguishing feature. Many Muslims held government positions, including positions of importance, particularly in the army. As travel became easier, there were many exchanges between China and the outside world. Around this time, Chinese Muslims also became the first Muslims in New Zealand (See Islam in New Zealand). Sufism spread throughout the Northwestern China in the early decades of the Qing Dynasty (mid-17th century through early 18th century).Gladney (1999) The most important Sufi orders (menhuan) included: * The Qadiriyya, which was established in China Qi Jingyi (祁静一), also known as Hilal al-Din (1656–1719), student of the famous Central Asian Sufi teachers, Khoja Afaq and Kjoja Abd Alla. He was known among the Hui Sufis as Qi Daozu (Grand Master Qi). The shrine complex around \\"great tomb\\" (da gongbei) in Linxia remains the center of the Qadiriyya in China. * The Khufiyya: a Naqshbandi order. * The Jahriyya: another Naqshbandi menhuan, founded by Ma Mingxin. Gunners of the Dungan revolt =Ming loyalist Muslims= When the Qing dynasty invaded the Ming dynasty in 1644, Muslim Ming loyalists in Gansu led by Muslim leaders Milayin and Ding Guodong led a revolt in 1646 against the Qing during the Milayin rebellion in order to drive the Qing out and restore the Ming Prince of Yanchang Zhu Shichuan to the throne as the emperor. The Muslim Ming loyalists were supported by Hami's Sultan Sa'id Baba and his son Prince Turumtay. The Muslim Ming loyalists were joined by Tibetans and Han Chinese in the revolt. After fierce fighting, and negotiations, a peace agreement was agreed on in 1649, and Milayan and Ding nominally pledged alleigance to the Qing and were given ranks as members of the Qing military. When other Ming loyalists in southern China made a resurgence and the Qing were forced to withdraw their forces from Gansu to fight them, Milayan and Ding once again took up arms and rebelled against the Qing. The Muslim Ming loyalists were then crushed by the Qing with 100,000 of them, including Milayin, Ding Guodong, and Turumtay killed in battle. The Confucian Hui Muslim scholar Ma Zhu (1640-1710) served with the southern Ming loyalists against the Qing. =Dungan and Panthay Revolts= During the time, the Muslims revolted against the Qing Dynasty, most notably in the Dungan revolt (1862–1877) and the Panthay rebellion (1856-1873) in Yunnan. One million people died in the Panthay rebellion,Damsan Harper, Steve Fallon, Katja Gaskell, Julie Grundvig, Carolyn Heller, Thomas Huhti, Bradley Maynew, Christopher Pitts. Lonely Planet China. 9. 2005. several million people died in the Dungan revolt. However, Muslims in other parts of China proper like in the east and southern provinces who did not revolt, were not affected at all by the rebellion, and experienced no genocide, nor did they seek to revolt. It was reported that Muslim villages in Henan province, which was next to Shaanxi, were totally unaffected and relations between Han and Hui continued normally. The Hui Muslim population of Beijing was unaffected by the Muslim rebels during the Dungan revolt. Elisabeth Allès wrote that the relationship between Hui Muslim and Han peoples continued normally in the Henan area, with no ramifications or consequences from the Muslim rebellions of other areas. Allès wrote, \\"The major Muslim revolts in the middle of the nineteenth century which involved the Hui in Shaanxi, Gansu and Yunnan, as well as the Uyghurs in Xinjiang, do not seem to have had any direct effect on this region of the central plain.\\" Many Muslims like Ma Zhan'ao, Ma Anliang, Dong Fuxiang, Ma Qianling, and Ma Julung defected to the Qing dynasty side, and helped the Qing general Zuo Zongtang exterminate the Muslim rebels. These Muslim generals belonged to the Khafiya sect, and they helped Qing massacre Jahariyya rebels. General Zuo moved the Han around Hezhou out of the area and relocated them as a reward for the Muslims there helping Qing kill other Muslim rebels. In 1895, another Dungan Revolt (1895) broke out, and loyalist Muslims like Dong Fuxiang, Ma Anliang, Ma Guoliang, Ma Fulu, and Ma Fuxiang suppressed and massacred the rebel Muslims led by Ma Dahan, Ma Yonglin, and Ma Wanfu. A Muslim army called the Kansu Braves led by General Dong Fuxiang fought for the Qing dynasty against the foreigners during the Boxer Rebellion. They included well known Generals like Ma Anliang, Ma Fulu, and Ma Fuxiang. In Yunnan was noted that the Qing armies only massacred the Muslims who had rebelled, and spared Muslims who took no part in the uprising. The Ush rebellion in 1765 by Uyghurs against the Manchus occurred after Uyghur women were gang raped by the servants and son of Manchu official Su-cheng. It was said that Ush Muslims had long wanted to sleep on [Sucheng and son's] hides and eat their flesh. because of the rape of Uyghur Muslim women for months by the Manchu official Sucheng and his son. The Manchu Emperor ordered that the Uyghur rebel town be massacred, the Qing forces enslaved all the Uyghur children and women and slaughtered the Uyghur men. Manchu soldiers and Manchu officials regularly having sex with or raping Uyghur women caused massive hatred and anger by Uyghur Muslims to Manchu rule. The invasion by Jahangir Khoja was preceded by another Manchu official, Binjing who raped a Muslim daughter of the Kokan aqsaqal from 1818–1820. The Qing sought to cover up the rape of Uyghur women by Manchus to prevent anger against their rule from spreading among the Uyghurs. The Manchu official Shuxing'a started an anti-Muslim massacre which led to the Panthay Rebellion. Shuxing'a developed a deep hatred of Muslims after an incident where he was stripped naked and nearly lynched by a mob of Muslims. He ordered several Muslim rebels to be slow sliced to death. Tariq Ali wrote about the real incident in one of his novels, claiming the Muslims who had nearly lynched Shuxing'a were not Hui Muslims but belonged to another ethnicity but nevertheless the Manchu official blamed all Muslims for the incident. In addition to sending Han exiles convicted of crimes to Xinjiang to be slaves of Banner garrisons there, the Qing also practiced reverse exile, exiling Inner Asian (Mongol, Russian and Muslim criminals from Mongolia and Inner Asia) to China proper where they would serve as slaves in Han Banner garrisons in Guangzhou. Russian, Oirats and Muslims (Oros. Ulet. Hoise jergi weilengge niyalma) such as Yakov and Dmitri were exiled to the Han banner garrison in Guangzhou.Yongwei, MWLFZZ, FHA 03-0188-2740-032, QL 43.3.30 (26 April 1778). In the 1780s after the Muslim rebellion in Gansu started by Zhang Wenqing 張文慶 was defeated, Muslims like Ma Jinlu 馬進祿 were exiled to the Han Banner garrison in Guangzhou to become slaves to Han Banner officers.

Republic of China  1939, Northwest China, Chinese Muslim fighters gather to fight against the Japanese The Hui Muslim community was divided in its support for the 1911 Xinhai Revolution. The Hui Muslims of Shaanxi supported the revolutionaries and the Hui Muslims of Gansu supported the Qing. The native Hui Muslims (Mohammedans) of Xi'an (Shaanxi province) joined the Han Chinese revolutionaries in slaughtering the entire 20,000 Manchu population of Xi'an. The native Hui Muslims of Gansu province led by general Ma Anliang sided with the Qing and prepard to attack the anti-Qing revolutionaries of Xi'an city. Only some wealthy Manchus who were ransomed and Manchu females survived. Wealthy Han Chinese seized Manchu girls to become their slaves and poor Han Chinese troops seized young Manchu women to be their wives. Young pretty Manchu girls were also seized by Hui Muslims of Xi'an during the massacre and brought up as Muslims. The Manchu dynasty fell in 1911, and the Republic of China was established by Sun Yat Sen, who immediately proclaimed that the country belonged equally to the Han, Hui (Muslim), Meng (Mongol), and the Tsang (Tibetan) peoples. This led to some improvement in relations between these different peoples. The end of the Qing dynasty also marked an increase in Sino-foreign interaction. This led to increased contact between Muslim minorities in China and the Islamic states of the Middle East. A missionary, Claude Pickens, found 834 well-known Hui who had made hajj between 1923 and 1934. By 1939, at least 33 Hui Muslims had studied at Cairo's Al-Azhar University. In 1912, the Chinese Muslim Federation was formed in the capital Nanjing. Similar organization formed in Beijing (1912), Shanghai (1925) and Jinan (1934).Gladney (1999), pg. 457 Academic activities within the Muslim community also flourished. Before the Sino-Japanese War of 1937, there existed more than a hundred known Muslim periodicals. Thirty journals were published between 1911 and 1937. Although Linxia remained the center for religious activities, many Muslim cultural activities had shifted to Beijing.Gladney (1999), pg. 458 In the first decade of the 20th century, it has been estimated that there were 20 million Muslims in China proper (that is, China excluding the regions of Mongolia and Xinjiang).Counting up the number of people of traditionally Muslim nationalities who were enumerated in the 1990 census gives a total of 17.6 million, 96% of whom belong to just three nationalities: Hui 8.6 million, Uyghurs 7.2 million, and Kazakhs 1.1 million. Other nationalities that are traditionally Muslim include Kyrghyz, Tajiks, Uzbeks, Tatars, Salar, Bonan, and Dongxiang. See Dru C. Gladney, \\"Islam in China: Accommodation or Separatism?\\", Paper presented at Symposium on Islam in Southeast Asia and China, Hong Kong, 2002. Available at http://www.islamsymposium.cityu.edu.hk . The 2000 census reported a total of 20.3 million members of Muslim nationalities, of which again 96% belonged to just three groups: Hui 9.8 million, Uyghurs 8.4 million, and Kazakhs 1.25 million. Of these, almost half resided in Gansu, over a third in Shaanxi (as defined at that time) and the rest in Yunnan. In 1911, the provinces of Qinhai, Gansu and Ningxia fell to Muslim warlords of the family known as the Ma clique, including Ma Bufang and Ma Chung-ying. During the Second Sino- Japanese war the Japanese followed what has been referred to as a \\"killing policy\\" and destroyed many mosques. According to Wan Lei, \\"Statistics showed that the Japanese destroyed 220 mosques and killed countless Hui people by April 1941.\\" After the Rape of Nanking mosques in Nanjing were found to be filled with dead bodies.They also followed a policy of economic oppression which involved the destruction of mosques and Hui communities and made many Hui jobless and homeless. Another policy was one of deliberate humiliation. This included soldiers smearing mosques with pork fat, forcing Hui to butcher pigs to feed the soldiers, and forcing girls to ostensibly train as geishas and singers but in fact made them serve as sex slaves. Hui cemeteries were destroyed for military reasons. Many Hui fought in the war against Japan. The Hui Muslim county of Dachang was subjected to slaughter by the Japanese. On 10 February 1938, Legation Secretary of the German Embassy, Rosen, wrote to his Foreign Ministry about a film made in December by Reverend John Magee about the Nanking Massacre to recommend its purchase. Here is an excerpt from his letter and a description of some of its shots, kept in the Political Archives of the Foreign Ministry in Berlin.

Immediately after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, Ma Bufang arranged for a cavalry division under the Muslim General Ma Biao to be sent east to battle the Japanese. Ethnic Turkic Salar Muslims made up the majority of the first cavalry division which was sent by Ma Bufang.还原真实的西北群马之马步芳骑八师中原抗日 Muslims affiliated with the Kuomintang moved to Taiwan after the Chinese Civil War. In the Kuomintang Islamic insurgency, Muslim Kuomintang National Revolutionary Army forces in Northwest China, in Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, Xinjiang, as well as Yunnan, continued an unsuccessful insurgency against the communists from 1950 to 1958, after the general civil war was over. Early communist era (1949-1990) The People's Republic of China was founded in 1949. Through many of the early years there were tremendous upheavals which culminated in the Cultural Revolution. During the Cultural Revolution urban youths were encouraged to move to the countryside to \\"tame the wilderness\\" and many chose Xinjiang, inadvertently diverting Muslim influence. During that time, the government also accused Muslims, Buddhists, Christians and all other religions in China of holding \\"superstitious beliefs\\" and promoting \\"anti-socialist trends\\".Israeli (2002), pg. 253 Mosques were often defaced, destroyed or closed and copies of the Quran were destroyed along with Chinese temples, Christian churches, Buddhist monasteries, and cemeteries by the Red Guards.Goldman, Merle (1986). Religion in Post-Mao China, The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science. 483.1:145-56 In 1975, in what would be known as the Shadian incident, there was an uprising among Hui in what was the only large scale ethnic rebellion during the Cultural Revolution. In crushing the rebellion, the PLA massacred 1,600 Hui with MIG fighter jets used to fire rockets onto the village. Following the fall of the Gang of Four, apologies and reparations were made. Chinese Muslims say that the Soviet Union was worse in regards to its treatment of Islam than China during the \\"ten black years\\" (of the Cultural Revolution).ALLÈS & CHÉRIF- CHEBBI & HALFON 2003, p. 12. With economic reform after 1978, health care in China became largely private fee-for-service due to the introduction of capitalist reforms which abolished the free socialist health care. This was widely criticised by Muslims in the North West, who were often unable to obtain medical support in their remote communities. Subsequently, with the advent of Deng Xiaoping in 1979, the Chinese government liberalised its policies toward Islam and Muslims. New legislation gave all minorities the freedom to use their own spoken and written languages; develop their own culture and education; and practice their religion.bbc religion and ethics ISLAM Integration More Chinese Muslims than ever before are allowed to go on the Hajj.New Encyclopedia of Islam, pg. 622-25 China banned a book titled \\"Xing Fengsu\\" (\\"Sexual Customs\\") which insulted Islam and placed its authors under arrest in 1989 after protests in Lanzhou and Beijing by Chinese Hui Muslims, during which the Chinese police provided protection to the Hui Muslim protestors, and the Chinese government organized public burnings of the book.Beijing Review, Volume 32 1989, p. 13. Gladney 1991, p. 2.Schein 2000, p. 154.Gladney 2004, p. 66.Bulag 2010, p. 104.Gladney 2005, p. 257.Gladney 2013, p. 144.Sautman 2000, p. 79.Gladney 1996, p. 341.Lipman 1996, p. 299. The Chinese government assisted them and gave into their demands because Hui do not have a separatist movement, unlike the Uyghurs, Hui Muslim protestors who violently rioted by vandalizing property during the protests against the book were let off by the Chinese government and went unpunished while Uyghur protestors were imprisoned.Gladney 2004, p. 232. Tensions between Hui Muslims and Uyghurs arise because Hui troops and officials often dominated the Uyghurs and crush Uyghur revolts. Xinjiang's Hui population increased by over 520 percent between 1940 and 1982, an average annual growth of 4.4 percent, while the Uyghur population only grew at 1.7 percent. This dramatic increase in Hui population led inevitably to significant tensions between the Hui and Uyghur populations. Some Uyghurs in Kashgar remember that the Hui army at the Battle of Kashgar (1934) massacred 2,000 to 8,000 Uyghurs, which causes tension as more Hui moved into Kashgar from other parts of China. Some Hui criticize Uyghur separatism and generally do not want to get involved in conflict in other countries. Hui and Uyghur live separately, attending different mosques. China today Under China's current leadership, Islam is undergoing a modest revival and there are now many mosques in China. There has been an upsurge in Islamic expression and many nationwide Islamic associations have been organised to co-ordinate inter-ethnic activities among Muslims. In most of China, Muslims have considerable religious freedom, however, in areas like Xinjiang, where there has been unrest among Uighur Muslims, activities are restricted. China is fighting an increasingly protracted struggle against members of its Uighur minority, who are a Turkic people with their own language and distinct Islamic culture. Uighar separatists are intent on re- establishing the state of East Turkistan, which existed for a few years in the 1920s.Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, China feared potential separatist goals of Muslim majority in Xinjiang. An April 1996 agreement between Russia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, however, assures China of avoiding a military conflict. Other Muslim states have also asserted that they have no intentions of becoming involved in China's internal affairs.Gladney (1999), pg. 471 China fears the influence of radical Islamic thinking filtering in from central Asia, and the role of exiles in neighbouring states and in Turkey, with which Xinjiang's majority Uighur population shares linguistic ties.bbc religion and ethics ISLAM China today BBC - Religion & Ethics - Islam in China (650-present): China today at www.bbc.co.uk In 2007, anticipating the coming \\"Year of the Pig\\" in the Chinese calendar, depictions of pigs were banned from CCTV \\"to avoid conflicts with ethnic minorities\\". This is believed to refer to China's population of 20 million Muslims (to whom pigs are considered \\"unclean\\"). In response to the 2015 Charlie Hebdo shooting Chinese state-run media attacked Charlie Hebdo for publishing the cartoons insulting Muhammad, with the state-run Xinhua advocated limiting freedom of speech, while another state-run newspaper Global Times said the attack was \\"payback\\" for what it characterised as Western colonialism and accusing Charlie Hebdo of trying to incite a clash of civilizations. Different Muslim ethnic groups in different regions are treated differently by the Chinese government in regards to religious freedom. Religious freedom is present for Hui Muslims, who can practice their religion, build Mosques, and have their children attend Mosques, while more controls are placed specifically on Uyghurs in Xinjiang. Since the 1980s Islamic private schools (Sino-Arabic schools (中阿學校)) have been supported and permitted by the Chinese government among Muslim areas, only specifically excluding Xinjiang from allowing these schools because of separatist sentiment there. Although religious education for children is officially forbidden by law in China, the Communist party allows Hui Muslims to violate this law and have their children educated in religion and attend Mosques while the law is enforced on Uyghurs. After secondary education is completed, China then allows Hui students who are willing to embark on religious studies under an Imam.ALLÈS & CHÉRIF-CHEBBI & HALFON 2003, p. 14. China does not enforce the law against children attending Mosques on non-Uyghurs in areas outside of Xinjiang. Hui Muslims who are employed by the state are allowed to fast during Ramadan unlike Uyghurs in the same positions, the amount of Hui going on Hajj is expanding, and Hui women are allowed to wear veils, while Uyghur women are discouraged from wearing them and Uyghurs find it difficult to get passports to go on Hajj. Hui religious schools are allowed a massive autonomous network of mosques and schools run by a Hui Sufi leader was formed with the approval of the Chinese government even as he admitted to attending an event where Bin Laden spoke.Savadove, Bill. 2005. \\"Faith Flourishes in an Arid Wasteland; Muslim Sect in Ningxia Accepts Beijing's Authority and Is Allowed to Build a Virtual Religious State.\\" South China Morning Post, 17 August. Uyghur views vary by the oasis they live in. China has historically favored Turpan and Hami. Uyghurs in Turfan and Hami and their leaders like Emin Khoja allied with the Qing against Uyghurs in Altishahr. During the Qing dynasty, China enfeoffed the rulers of Turpan and Hami (Kumul) as autonomous princes, while the rest of the Uyghurs in Altishahr (the Tarim Basin) were ruled by Begs.Rudelson & Rudelson 1997, p. 31. Uyghurs from Turpan and Hami were appointed by China as officials to rule over Uyghurs in the Tarim Basin. Turpan is more economically prosperous and views China more positively than the rebellious Kashgar, which is the most anti-China oasis. Uyghurs in Turpan are treated leniently and favourably by China with regards to religious policies, while Kashgar is subjected to controls by the government.Rudelson & Rudelson 1997, pp. 46-7.Central Asia Monitor 1993, p. 19. In Turpan and Hami, religion is viewed more positively by China than religion in Kashgar and Khotan in southern Xinjiang.Mackerras 2003, p. 118. Both Uyghur and Han Communist officials in Turpan turn a blind eye to the law and allow religious Islamic education for Uyghur children.Svanberg & Westerlund 2012, p. 202.Rudelson & Rudelson 1997, p. 81. Celebrating at religious functions and going on Hajj to Mecca is encouraged by the Chinese government, for Uyghur members of the Communist party. From 1979-1989, 350 mosques were built in Turpan.Rudelson & Rudelson 1997, p. 129. Han, Hui, and the Chinese government are viewed much more positively by Uyghurs specifically in Turpan, with the government providing better economic, religious, and political treatment for them.Svanberg & Westerlund 2012, p. 205. The Uyghur terrorist organization East Turkestan Islamic Movement's magazine Islamic Turkistan has accused the Chinese \\"Muslim Brotherhood\\" (the Yihewani) of being responsible for the moderation of Hui Muslims and the lack of Hui joining terrorist jihadist groups in addition to blaming other things for the lack of Hui Jihadists, such as the fact that for more than 300 years Hui and Uyghurs have been enemies of each other, no separatist Islamist organizations among the Hui, the fact that the Hui view China as their home, and the fact that the \\"infidel Chinese\\" language is the language of the Hui. Hui Muslim drug dealers are accused by Uyghur Muslims of pushing heroin on Uyghurs. Heroin has been vended by Hui dealers. There is a typecast image in the public eye of heroin being the province of Hui dealers. Hui have been involved in the Golden Triangle drug area. =Tibetan-Muslim sectarian violence= In Tibet, the majority of Muslims are Hui people. Hatred between Tibeans and Muslims stems from events during the Muslim warlord Ma Bufang's rule in Qinghai such as Ngolok rebellions (1917–49) and the Sino- Tibetan War, but in 1949 the Communists put an end to the violence between Tibetans and Muslims, however, new Tibetan-Muslim violence broke out after China engaged in liberalization. Riots broke out between Muslims and Tibetans over incidents such as bones in soups and prices of balloons, and Tibetans accused Muslims of being cannibals who cooked humans in their soup and of contaminating food with urine. Tibetans attacked Muslim restaurants. Fires set by Tibetans which burned the apartments and shops of Muslims resulted in Muslim families being killed and wounded in the 2008 mid-March riots. Due to Tibetan violence against Muslims, the traditional Islamic white caps have not been worn by many Muslims. Scarfs were removed and replaced with hairnets by Muslim women in order to hide. Muslims prayed in secret at home when in August 2008 the Tibetans burned the Mosque. Incidents such as these which make Tibetans look bad on the international stage are covered up by the Tibetan exile community. The repression of Tibetan separatism by the Chinese government is supported by Hui Muslims. In addition, Chinese-speaking Hui have problems with Tibetan Hui (the Tibetan speaking Kache minority of Muslims). The main Mosque in Lhasa was burned down by Tibetans and Chinese Hui Muslims were violently assaulted by Tibetan rioters in the 2008 Tibetan unrest. Tibetan exiles and foreign scholars like ignore and do not talk about sectarian violence between Tibetan Buddhists and Muslims. The majority of Tibetans viewed the wars against Iraq and Afghanistan after 9/11 positively and it had the effect of galvanizing anti-Muslim attitudes among Tibetans and resulted in an anti-Muslim boycott against Muslim owned businesses. . Since the Chinese government supports and backs up the Hui Muslims, the Tibetans deliberately attack the Hui Muslims as a way to demonstrate anti-government sentiment and because they have a background of sectarian violence against each other since Ma Bufang's rule due to their separate religions and ethnicity and Tibetans resent Hui economic domination.  Islamic education  Jingtang Jiaoyu was a system of Islamic education developed during the Ming dynasty among the Hui, centered around Mosques. The Arabic and Persian language Thirteen Classics were part of the main curriculum.ALLÈS & CHÉRIF- CHEBBI & HALFON 2003, p. 13. In the madrassas, some Chinese Muslim literature like the Han Kitab were used for educational purposes.Chinese Muslim literature Liu Zhi (scholar) wrote texts to help Hui learn Arabic.Gibb 1954, p. 771. Persian was the main Islamic foreign language used by Chinese Muslims, followed by Arabic.Murata, pp. 13-14. Hui Muslim Generals like Ma Fuxiang, Ma Hongkui, and Ma Bufang funded schools or sponsored students studying abroad. Imam Hu Songshan and Ma Linyi were involved in reforming Islamic education inside China. Muslim Kuomintang officials in the Republic of China government supported the Chengda Teachers Academy, which helped usher in a new era of Islamic education in China, promoting nationalism and Chinese language among Muslims, and fully incorporating them into the main aspects of Chinese society.Mao 2011.

Hui Muslims from the Central Plains (Zhongyuan) differed in their view of women's education than Hui Muslims from the northwestern provinces, with the Hui from the Central Plains provinces like Henan having a history of women's Mosques and religious schooling for women, while Hui women in northwestern provinces were kept in the house. However, in northwestern China reformers started bringing female education in the 1920s. In Linxia, Gansu, a secular school for Hui girls was founded by the Muslim warlord Ma Bufang, the school was named Shuada Suqin Wmen's Primary School after his wife Ma Suqin who was also involved in its founding.Jaschok & Shui 2000, p. 96. Hui Muslim refugees fled to northwest China from the central plains after the Japanese invasion of China, where they continued to practice women's education and build women's mosque communities, while women's education was not adopted by the local northwestern Hui Muslims and the two different communities continued to differ in this practice.Jaschok & Shui 2000, p. 97. General Ma Fuxiang donated funds to promote education for Hui Muslims and help build a class of intellectuals among the Hui and promote the Hui role in developing the nation's strength.Matsumoto 2004, After secondary education is completed, Chinese law then allows students who are willing to embark on religious studies under an Imam.

The group had wanted 35022 Holland America Line, but it was sent to Woodham Brothers scrapyard in South Wales, before they could purchase it, so the group purchased Clan Line instead. Clan Line was one of the first preserved locomotives to participate in steam specials, and in 1974 hauled its first revenue-earning train in preservation from Basingstoke to Westbury. Its sister engine 35022 Holland American Line was eventually rescued from Barry Scrapyard in 1986. In the 1990s, 35028 Clan Line was chosen as the locomotive to haul the Belmond British Pullman using preserved Pullman carriages, with tours around Kent, Surrey, Oxford, Bath and Bristol. In September 1994, it was the first steam locomotive in the United Kingdom to be fitted with air brakes.Clan Line returns like a breath of fresh air The Railway Magazine issue 1123 November 1994 page 7 In the early 2000s, when the locomotive went for overhaul, LNER Class A3 4472 Flying Scotsman took over those trains. As of January 2015, Clan Line is based at Stewarts Lane TMD, Battersea. It returned to mainline operation in October 2006, when it resumed British Pullman duties and hauling the occasional enthusiast specials, although in 2012, the locomotive was used on a number of Cathedrals Express trips, filling in for locomotives that were not available for the tours. 35028 Clan Line was the first Merchant Navy class locomotive to operate on the mainline in preservation.

It was one of a handful of permanent Canal Zone townships, built to house employees of the Panama Canal and their dependents. The name Gamboa is the name of a tree of the quince family.  Location  The old single lane bridge with its traffic light Gamboa is located on a sharp bend of the Chagres River at the point which feeds Lake Gatun. Just south of Gamboa, Lake Gatun and the Chagres meet the Culebra Cut (Gaillard Cut) where the Canal cuts through the Continental Divide. Thus, though Gamboa is closer to the Pacific side of Panama, its watershed is on the Atlantic side. A single lane iron and wood bridge that crossed the Chagres and was the only road access to Gamboa for most of its history. This bridge is still intact today, but in October of 2018 a new 2-lane bridge was completed near the original site. http://thebulletinpanama.com/2018/10/canal-inaugurates-new-gamboa-bridge/ Gamboa's Post Office, 61 Gaillard Hwy The former Gamboa Elementary School Gamboa's McGrath Field, seen from Maltby Pl. Gamboa's Swimming Pool, 65 Maltby Place Goethals Boulevard, Gamboa  History  Gamboa was built near the site of the former village of Santa Cruz. Three miles further up the Chagres river was the town of Las Cruces, where 19th-century travelers and cargo disembarked from river barges to take the overland Las Cruces trail by mule. After the completion of the Panama Railroad in 1855, the railroad ran near the area, but made no stops and no PR maps list any towns in Gamboa's present location. Present-day Gamboa was built in 1911, during Canal construction. It was initially populated by \\"silver roll\\" (i.e., Afro-Antilleans and other non-US, non-white) workers and their dependents. These initial settlers, counted at around 700, had previously lived in the construction areas between the former towns of Tabernilla and Gorgona, which were covered by Lake Gatun as Canal construction advanced. No Americans were counted amongst the town's first inhabitants. By 1914, at the conclusion of Canal construction activities, Gamboa's population decreased to 173 and the town consisted of a police station, a four-family house which had been brought in from the former town of Empire, and a two-family house brought from the former town of Culebra, and several old railroad box cars used to house silver roll employees. The first commissary, operated by a division of the Panama Canal Company/Canal Zone Government, also operated out of three box cars. After many years of studies and debates, and lobbying by Dredging Division Superintendent John G. Claybourn, the Panama Canal Company moved its Dredging Division from the town of Paraíso to Gamboa in 1936. In 1933, when a three-man board appointed by Canal Zone Governor J.L. Schley studied the feasibility of moving the Dredging Division to Gamboa, the population was 251, including just 10 Americans. The first Dredging Division families began moving into the newly built town of Gamboa in September 1936. Within a year, the town's population jumped to 1,419 and by 1942, the town reached its peak population—3,853. The new residents of Gamboa built their civic center with their own hands and funds. It was initially used as a USO to entertain troops stationed in nearby hills, but later became headquarters of the Civic Council. The Civic Council and Gamboa's residents also built the Gamboa Golf and Country Club, on the Gamboa Ridge, overlooking the Chagres river. The men in the town hammered, sawed and poured concrete while the women brought picnic lunches and tended barbecues. The Club was officially opened on January 1, 1939 and eventually included a 9-hole golf course. Gamboa, like most Canal Zone towns, had its own commissary, post office, school, churches (five of them), railroad station, fire station and gas station. For much of the town's history, Gamboa's non-US, non-white population lived in a separate part of town called Santa Cruz. This included 50 families moved from La Boca in October 1954 when that town was depopulated and converted into a white housing area. Not all Gamboans worked for the Dredging Division. Because of its remote location and distance from other Canal Zone towns, Gamboa was seen as less desirable than some of the other Panama Canal Company/Canal Zone Government's townships, and since housing in the Canal Zone was assigned based on seniority, many of the new arrivals to the \\"Zone\\", as it became known to its residents (Zonians), were initially assigned housing here before becoming eligible for housing in other towns. U.S. military personnel and their dependents lived in Gamboa during the 1940s due to the shortage of housing on the local military bases. U.S. personnel continued living in Gamboa until the total withdrawal of U.S. troops from Panama in 1999. Over time as the Panama Canal Company/Canal Zone Government began to transfer operations to Panama following the 1977 Panama Canal Treaties, some of the services offered in Gamboa were shut down. The most visible closures were the commissary and movie theater, which were boarded up throughout the 1980s. The demise of the Panama Railroad in the late 1980s further cut the town off from the rest of the Canal area. Gamboa's elementary school was built in 1937 by the Panama Canal Company/Canal Zone Government Division of Schools. It consisted of 3 classrooms, a library, and principal's office upstairs, with a kindergarten classroom underneath. The school was transferred to the Department of Defense Dependents Schools (DoDDS) in 1979 after the abolition of the Canal Zone and its government. That school year, its total enrollment was 115. Three U.S. grade school teachers were employed and classes were paired up, with first and second grade sharing one room, third and fourth grade sharing a room, and fifth and sixth grade sharing the third classroom. A physical education teacher was also employed for the school's gymnasium, which was inside a separate building. Since December 1980, a small space underneath the school has operated as a mini-shopette. Total enrollment for the 1987-1988 school year was down to 53. In June 1988, with a projected enrollment of just 40 students for the 1988-1989 school year, DoDDS closed the Gamboa Elementary School. Starting in 1988, all students were bused to Balboa Elementary. Following Operation \\"Just Cause\\" in December 1989, the school building was used as a local headquarters for U.S. Military Police. Gamboa's golf course became a Boy Scout camp for several years, but remained inactive in the last years of the Treaty reversion period.  Gamboa today  A well-preserved example of a typical Panama Canal Zone house in Gamboa (2011). The town of Gamboa is still inhabited, but as a shadow of its former self, maintained, but without the vibrancy and civic spirit it once enjoyed. Many of its houses are not inhabited and several public buildings are underutilized. It remains the primary headquarters of the Dredging Division of the Panama Canal Authority (formerly PCC). The Dredging Division's docks are used by light ferries to reach the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) facilities at Barro Colorado Island. Gamboa is home to caymans, crocodiles, iguanas, and several hundred bird species. Given its location at the \\"end of the road\\" and the single road connecting it to the rest of the Canal Zone, Gamboa is adjacent to significant tracts of relatively undisturbed rainforest. A trail that follows an old pipeline (\\"Pipeline Road\\") is considered one of the best birding hikes in Panama. It is one of the premiere bird watching sites in all of Central America.Angehr, Engleman & Engleman (2008). A Bird-finding Guide to Panama. Panama Audubon Society. Cornell University Press. Many amateur birdwatchers join ornithologists for yearly bird counts held near Gamboa by the Audubon Society of Panama. The old Spanish colonial era Las Cruces Trail used to carry precious metals and supplies between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans passes near Gamboa, though parts of it are now underwater.  In popular culture  In the movie The Tailor of Panama the character played by Pierce Brosnan stays at the Gamboa Rainforest Resort, and has a meal at a waterside restaurant in Gamboa. In the background of the opening shot of this sequence, you can see the iron and wood bridge that leads to Gamboa, with an ocean liner behind it. The Gamboa Rainforest Resort is a 5-star hotel located in Gamboa. The Resort has developed 2 Indian reservations (Embera and Wounaa) an aerial tram to visit the jungle canopy, and many other attractions which now draw many people to the otherwise sleepy town.

Written by Terry Dempsey and produced by Rick Jarrard, \\"Daydreamer\\" was Cassidy's second and final No.1 single in the UK Singles Chart, spending three weeks at the top of the chart in October and November 1973. The song was a double-A side with a cover version of Harry Nilsson's \\"The Puppy Song\\" on the B-side. The single was the 10th best selling single in the UK in 1973. The song also appears on David Cassidy's 1973 UK No.1 album Dreams Are Nuthin' More Than Wishes. Cilla Black recorded a version of this song in 1974. The French singer Claude François also recorded a version of this song called \\"Le mal aimé\\" which was a hit in France. The song's only chart appearances in the US were by C.C. & Company and Gino Cunico in 1976. C.C. & Company’s soul-flavored version (produced by Mike Theodore and Dennis Coffey) entered the Hot 100 on January 3, 1976, and made it to #91 six weeks later. Cunico’s cover, on Arista Records, which hit No. 43 on the Billboard Easy Listening Chart, added a bridge repeating the phrase \\"ain't that a shame\\", echoing the lyrical variation introduced by Cilla Black in her 1974 treatment of the song.

Stop-loss policies take effect after a certain threshold has been exceeded in claims. Overview Insurance companies themselves, as well as self-insuring employers, purchase stop-loss coverage for a premium to protect themselves. In the case of a participant reaching more than the specific (or \\"individual\\") stop-loss deductible ($300,000, for example), the insurer will reimburse the insured (the company, not the participant) for the remainder of the claim to be paid over that deductible amount. There is also typically an aggregate- claims deductible, which is applied to all paid claims combined. For all claims at or below their specific stop-loss level, if the sum of these are more than the aggregate stop loss level, then the insurer will reimburse the insured for the difference. Insurance companies and health and benefits consultants typically use mathematical models analyzing historical claims data to project expected stop loss premiums into the future to control for stop loss coverage costs and estimate the value of coverage PEPM (per employee per month) or PEPY. In health insurance Companies providing health insurance for their employees through a self-insured plan often subscribe to stop loss policies in order to protect themselves against catastrophic claims. The organization which takes the insurance policy is called the insured and the employees and other people who are covered through the policy are called participants. Most of the time there is an annual limit for the stop loss amount for each participant and an aggregate amount for each policy year. The premium is calculated for each employee for each month. The premium is based on the number of participants, age of the participants and various other information. Examples At Lloyd's of London, Personal Stop Loss (PSL) is a type of insurance policy which limits the losses of names all of whom did (and some of whom still do) underwrite with unlimited liability. Provided that the PSL responds to the claims made on it, the unlimited liability thereby becomes to some extent limited. PSL policies are not always available at all. Some are available as \\"mutuals\\" and, in the event that the market suffers large losses, may be unable to respond to any great extent.

Named after the backdraft which occurs in some fire situations, this drink produces a similar condition on purpose using flammable alcoholic drinks and an enclosing container, such as an upside down pint glass. Below is a typical procedure for producing one variation of the Backdraft drink. The combination of warm alcohol, followed by inhaling vaporized alcohol, and then finishing with a highly spiced warm alcohol, makes the drinking of this drink difficult, and while it tends not to have an immediate effect (since it is drunk quickly), the warmth of the alcohol and the vapor, make the concentration and absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream quicker than other drinks, and produces a more profound impact. The procedure listed below is a typical illustration of how the drink is presented, and the steps used to produce the backdraft effect. The alcohols listed can be substituted with others, as there are various recipes. However, the steps of this procedure are required to be taken in this order to produce what is known as a classic backdraft drink. Classical Backdraft Preparation A classic Backdraft is prepared by pouring equal amounts of Drambuie and Grand Marnier into a snifter.Drinknation.com: Backdraft recipe The mixture is set alight, and after a few seconds, extinguished by having the imbiber seal the top of the glass with their hand, although often a coaster or saucer is used instead. Once the flame is out, a straw is inserted, keeping as much of the seal intact as possible to contain the vapors. Both the liquid and the vapors are then consumed through the straw. Drambuie and Grand Marnier will be extremely difficult to ignite, if not impossible, so backdrafts are commonly done with 1 part Grand Marnier and 1 part 151. Alternate \\"Shooter\\" Backdraft preparation The procedure is as follows: #A saucer is placed on a counter or table. #A shot glass is placed in the center of the saucer, filled with Sambuca #A pint glass is filled with 1-2 shots of Cointreau. Swirl this in the glass to coat the sides #The Cointreau is lit and allowed to burn until the sides of the glass become warm to the touch #The lit Cointreau is poured into the shot glass, igniting the Sambuca #Cinnamon (or black pepper in the case of a Pepperdraft) is sprinkled into the flaming alcohol from about 1/3 of a meter (1 foot) above the shot glass. The finely powdered spice will ignite in the flame. > Important: All the while the pint glass must be kept upside down above the > flames to catch the alcohol vapor coming off the burning liquids. #When approximately 3-6 good shakes of cinnamon have been dispensed, the pint glass is lowered over the flaming liquid. > Note: the liquid on the outside of the inverted pint glass will still burn > and needs to be gently blown out. The upside down pint glass is smaller than > the coffee cup saucer, and will thus seal to the saucer extinguishing the > flames inside #As the alcohol cools inside the pint glass it will try to suck the alcohol on the outside back into the upside down pint glass. This backdraft effect is the origin of the drink's name. #The pint glass is removed and 2-3 ice cubes are placed into it. The opening of the pint glass is immediately sealed with the palm of the bartender's hand. #The pint glass is shaken: this has the effect of cooling the alcohol vapors and causing them to condense on the ice cubes, the walls of the glass and the air inside the glass. #Preparation is now complete. The drinker first downs the shot or drinks it through a straw. Then the straw is slipped through the bartender's fingers into the pint glass, whereby the drinker \\"drinks\\" the condensed alcohol - actually mainly inhaling the alcohol vapors inside the glass. Finally, the drinker uses the straw to suck up the spirits which have collected in the saucer. The combination of ingested and inhaled alcohol makes this drink extremely potent. The ice cubes (and the layer of condensed alcohol on them) may be eaten if desired. Backdraft physics When a gas is heated, its volume increases. It will displace cooler gases as it expands. If this is done in a partially enclosed space, and the vessel allowed to be full of hot gas, when the heat is taken away, the gases cool and as they do, the amount of liquids that the gas can hold will decrease. Therefore, most of the moisture and alcohol held in the gas will condense. As the gas cools, it decreases in volume, and the pressure drops. Thus when the flaming alcohol in a backdraft is covered with a pint glass over a saucer, the dense, cold air is replaced with less dense, warm air with a lot of alcohol vapour held in it. As the oxygen flow to the fire is restricted, the remaining oxygen is used up and the fire in the pint glass goes out, removing the heat source. The alcohol-laden warm air now in the glass cools and begins to create a pressure difference. The air outside the pint glass forces its way into the partially evacuated pint glass and is responsible for pushing any liquid at the outside bottom of the pint glass further inside (as the seal of the glass and the saucer is not perfect) as it begins to equalise the pressure difference. Once the majority of the liquid is inside the upside down pint glass, sometimes further air can be seen to bubble up into the glass. At some point an equilibrium will occur, where the pressure difference between inside and outside of the glass is equal to the pressure of the column of liquid held up inside, and this will hold the liquid inside the glass. Sometimes, when a good seal is made, the pressure difference between the inside and the outside of the glass exerts a great enough force that when the glass is lifted, the saucer will remain stuck to its underside. When the pint glass is removed, ice is immediately added, thus causing the condensation of the alcohol vapour, creating a white mist in the glass by a process fairly similar to the formation of contrails. By covering the glass with the hand, this vapour is trapped until it is extracted by the process of inhalation, usually through a straw.

A tin ceiling is an architectural element, consisting of a ceiling finished with plates of tin with designs pressed into them, that was very popular in Victorian buildings in North America in the late 19th and early 20th century. They were also popular in Australia where they were commonly known as pressed metal ceilings or Wunderlich ceilings (after the main Australian manufacturer Wunderlich). They were also used in South Africa. History Tin ceilings were introduced to North America as an affordable alternative to the exquisite plasterwork used in European homes. They gained popularity in the late 1800s as Americans sought sophisticated interior design. Durable, lightweight and fireproof, tin ceilings were appealing to home and business owners alike as a functionally attractive design element that was readily available. Important critics such as John Ruskin, George Gilbert Scott, Charles Eastlake and William Morris debated the implications of faux materials. These critics believed it was morally wrong and deceptive to imitate another material and blamed the degradation of society towards the \\"art of shamming\\" rather than honesty in architecture. Nevertheless, tin ceilings lasted longer than plaster ones and were easier to clean. They encapsulated ideas of democracy, making such decoration available to the middle class majority who supported the machine production. Decorative metal ceilings were first made of corrugated iron sheets, appearing in the United States by the early 1870s. It was during the late Victorian era that thin rolled tin-plate was being mass-produced. Tinplate was originally made from dipping iron in molten tin in order to prevent rust. Later, steel replaced iron as the more cost-effective solution. Tinplate was not the only sheet metal used to make stamped ceilings. Copper, lead (known as ternplate) and zinc were other common architectural metals in the industry. Between 1890 and 1930, approximately forty-five companies in the United States marketed metal ceilings; most were in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York, located along railroad lines that served as the main routes for delivering the pressed metal products directly to contractors. The Wheeling Corrugating Company out of Wheeling, West Virginia, became the leading tin ceiling manufacturer in the late 1800s. At that time, Wheeling Corrugating was a large steel mill that also made products from their steel sheets such as roofing and siding. Sheets of tin were stamped one at a time using rope drop hammers and cast iron molds. Using this method of production, metal was sandwiched between two interlocking tools. The top tool, or \\"ram,\\" was lifted up by a rope or chain, then dropped down onto the bottom die, smashing into the metal that was underneath and permanently embedding intricate patterns into the tin. Someone who saw the merit of this modern machine for its artistic potential was Frank Lloyd Wright. In his articles, \\"The Art and Craft of the Machine\\" and \\"In the Cause of Architecture,\\" the series published by Architectural Record, Wright elaborates on his modern theory of science and art and the role of the machine in the future of art. Tin ceiling in a private music room, Queensland, Australia, 1906 Tin ceilings were traditionally painted white to give the appearance of hand-carved or molded plaster. They were incorporated into residential living rooms and parlors as well as schools, hospitals and commercial businesses where painted tin was often used as wainscoting. In the 1930s, tin ceilings began to lose their popularity and steel materials became scarce because of the effort to collect scrap metal during WWII. Many sheet metal companies began making other products in order to stay in business. In the 21st century, some renewed interest has been shown in tin ceilings. The increase in interest has stemmed from businesses that were renovating and an interest to return to the nostalgia of the turn of the century. Still to this today there exists a manufacturing company by the name of W.F. Norman Corporation that produces original tin ceilings and ornaments from the same rope drop hammers as it once did in 1898. Several other companies offer conventional tin ceilings as well as panels made to fit into a drop-ceiling grid. Restoration Tin ceilings were built to last, and in the absence of prolonged moisture damage leading to corrosion, they usually did; however, the wear and tear over the hundred years since the heyday of tin has led to a burgeoning restoration industry. Magazines such as The Old-House Journal were created to offer articles about restoration, repair and installation practices for historic preservation of tin ceilings. Environmental hazards from the lead paint used on turn of the century tin ceilings mean that this is a job for experts in the field. Often restoration is achieved by simply stripping old paint, treating the metal with a protective base coat, patching minor damaged areas, and repainting. In some cases, where small sections of a ceiling have been damaged, partial restoration is needed. Panels can be easily replaced through companies that still manufacture original design components. If, however, a ceiling requires a historic pattern that is no longer in production, good quality panels from the existing ceiling may be used to create a mold and new customized tin can be pressed. If full restoration is needed, meaning no part of the existing ceiling remains structurally sound, a professional can help design a new ceiling appropriate for the period and structure using existing molds or creating reproductions based on photographic evidence or architectural drawings. This latter method can be extremely expensive, and is not cost effective, due to the cost of making a custom mold for the panel and usually the metal trim that was also used with the original project. More detailed information for repair and replacement of decorative metal ceilings can be found in the National Park Service Technical Preservation Services. Modern adaptation Several companies now offer hand-painted finishes for metalwork, as well as a more permanent look that can be achieved with powder-coated finishes. For the low end of the market, imitation panels are pressed from plastic or aluminum. Tin is now fashionably used for art work, back splashes, cabinet faces, wainscoting and much more. For over 100 years the tin panel was made with nail rails around the outside of the panel, designed to overlap each other. Panels were nailed into wood furring strips which were prevalent prior to the invention of plywood. Today, nail up panels can be easily brad nailed or hand nailed, into plywood without the need for the original furring strips. There is also a patented interlocking tin panel that will screw directly into existing drywall/popcorn/plaster ceilings, without the need for extensive plywood installation. Tin panels today are made in and sizes for easier handling and one-person installation. Today, most tin ceiling manufacturers actually use recycled blackplate steel in a thickness of only .010 or 1/100th of an inch. There are some manufacturers who also use actual tin plated steel, which is simply the blackplate steel with a thin coating of bright tin plate adhered to the base metal. Other manufacturers utilize aluminum, as it is rustproof and will last a lifetime. This finish is also an option with dropped ceilings.

Career =Early life= Munjal was born in 1923 at Kamalia, district Toba Tek Singh in unpartitioned Punjab, British India. Kamalia is now in Pakistan. He was from a simple middle-class Arora/Khatri family. After completing his formal education, he worked at the Army Ordnance Factory, before moving his base to India after partition. =Hero Cycles= In 1954, Hero Cycles moved up the value chain by making a shift from supplying to manufacturing handlebars, front forks and chains. In 1956, the Punjab Government issued tender notices for twelve new industrial licenses to make bicycles in Ludhiana. Munjal and his brothers participated in the bid and won the contract. Hero Cycles was registered as a large-scale industrial unit. with capital partly financed by the Government of Punjab. In 1961, Rockman Cycles Industries was established to manufacture bicycle chains and hubs. Under Munjal's leadership, Hero Cycles was the first company to export bicycles on such a large scale. In 1975, the company had become the largest bicycle manufacturer in India. By 1986, Hero Cycles entered the Guinness Book of Records as the largest manufacturers of bicycles in the world. =Hero Honda= Before entering into a joint venture with the Honda Motors, Munjal started a Majestic Auto and started manufacturing of the Hero Majestic Moped. To manufacture motor cycles in 1984, the Hero Group started a joint venture with Hero Honda and established a plant at Dharuhera, Haryana. The Hero Group became so large that by 2002 it had sold 8.6 million bicycles, and was producing 16,000 motorcycles a day. =Hero MotoCorp= After the Hero Honda Motors joint venture broke up in August 2011, Hero's board of directors agreed to pay royalties to Honda to continue to produce the Hero Honda until 2013, due to the popularity and ubiquity of the Hero Honda brand in the Asia Pacific region as Hero Honda Brand was trusted among the best in the Product reliability and customer satisfaction. The separation gave an opportunity for Hero to expand its market globally with the name Hero MotoCorp. Previously, it had not been permitted for Hero Honda to sell their bikes outside the Asia Pacific and in countries where Honda operated. In the first week of August 2013, the company recorded a benchmark never before reached by an Indian two- wheel vehicle industry manufacturer, by producing 50 million bikes.

Early life  Fukuoka was born in Tosa District in present-day Kōchi Prefecture, and served the Yamauchi daimyō of Tosa as a domain official. Together with fellow Tosa samurai Gotō Shōjirō, he went to Kyoto in 1867 to convince shōgun Tokugawa Yoshinobu to return power peacefully to the Emperor, thus bringing about the Meiji Restoration.  Meiji statesman  After the Meiji Restoration, while serving as a San'yo (senior councillor), he helped draft the text of the Charter Oath which set the tone and direction for the new Meiji government. In the new government, he concurrently served in a variety of offices, including Political system Affairs Officer and Parliament System Examination Officer. It was in this capacity that he was afterwards, asked to help draft the Seitaisho, which set up the organizational structure of the early Meiji government. In 1870, Fukuoka was transferred back to Kōchi and focused on the reforms of domain's administration, just prior to the abolition of the han system. In 1872, Fukuoka re-entered the central government as Taifu (Senior Vice Minister) of Education and of Justice, but resigned in 1873 due to his opposition to the government policy with regards to the Seikanron debate on the invasion of Korea In 1880, Fukuoka returned to the government as a member of the Genrōin and later served as Minister of Education, Sangi (Councillor), chairman of the Sanjiin (legislative advisory council).

The colour centre in humans is thought to be located in the ventral occipital lobe as part of the visual system, in addition to other areas responsible for recognizing and processing specific visual stimuli, such as faces, words, and objects. Many functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in both humans and macaque monkeys have shown colour stimuli to activate multiple areas in the brain, including the fusiform gyrus and the lingual gyrus. These areas, as well as others identified as having a role in colour vision processing, are collectively labelled visual area 4 (V4). The exact mechanisms, location, and function of V4 are still being investigated.  Primary visual cortex  The primary part of the visual cortex, (V1), is located in the calcarine sulcus, and is the first cortical area involved in visual processing. It receives visual input from the lateral geniculate nucleus, which is located in the thalamus. V1 sends the visual information received from the LGN to other extrastriate cortex areas for higher order processing. This higher order processing includes the recognition of shapes, motion, and colour. V1 has multiple areas that are colour-sensitive, which indicates that colour processing is not limited to one area. According to a paper by Dr Robert Shapley, V1 has an important role in colour perception. fMRI experimental results showed that V1 has two kinds of colour sensitive neurons: single-opponent and double-opponent cells. These cells are integral in the opponent process of interpreting colour signals. Single-opponent neurons respond to large areas of colour. This is advantageous for recognizing large colour scenes and atmospheres. In comparison, double opponent cells respond to patterns, textures, and colour boundaries. This is more important for perceiving the colour of objects and pictures. The double-opponent cells are receptive to opposite inputs from different cone cells in the retina. This is ideal for identifying contrasting colours, such as red and green. [1] Double-opponent cells are particularly important in computing local cone ratios from visual information from their receptive fields. Single opponent colour-sensitive neurons can be divided into two categories depending on the signals they receive from the cone cells: L-M neurons and S/(L+M) neurons. The three types of cone cells, small (S), medium (M), and long (L), detect different wavelengths across the visible spectrum. S cone cells can see short wavelength colours, which corresponds to violet and blue. Similarly, M cells detect medium wavelength colours, such as green and yellow, and L cells detect long wavelength colours, like red. L-M neurons, also called red-green opponent cells, receive input from long wavelength cones opposed by input from medium wavelength cones. S/(L+M) neurons receive input from S-cells and is opposed by a sum of the L and M-cell inputs. S/(L+M) neurons are also called blue-yellow opponent cells. The opposition between the colours allows the visual system to interpret differences in colour, which is ultimately more efficient than processing colours separately. Higher order visual processing A visual field map of the primary visual cortex and the numerous extrastriate areas. The primary visual cortex V1 sends visual information to the extrastriate cortical areas for higher order visual processing. These extrastriate cortical areas are located anterior to the occipital lobe. The main ones are designated as visual areas V2, V3, V4, and V5/MT. Each area can have multiple functions. Recent findings have shown that the colour centre is neither isolated nor traceable to a single area in the visual cortex. Rather, there are multiple areas that possibly have different roles in the ability to process colour stimulus. = Visual area V4 = The lingual gyrus is the hypothetical location of V4 in macaque monkeys. In humans, this area is called hV4. The fusiform gyrus is the hypothetical location of V4α, a secondary area for colour processing. Anatomical and physiological studies have established that the colour centre begins in V1 and sends signals to extrastriate areas V2 and V4 for further processing. V4 in particular is an area of interest because of the strength of the colour receptive fields in its neurons. V4 was initially identified in macaque monkey visual cortex experiments. Originally, it was proposed that colour was selectively processed in V4. However, this hypothesis was later rejected in favour of another hypothesis which suggested that V4 and other areas around V4 work together to process colour in the form of multiple colour selective regions. After identification of V4 as the colour-selective region in macaque monkeys, scientists began searching for a homologous structure in the human cortex. Using fMRI brain imaging, scientists found three main areas stimulated by colour: V1, an area in the ventral occipital lobe, specifically the lingual gyrus, which was designated as human V4, or hV4, and another area located anteriorly in the fusiform gyrus, designated as V4α. The purpose of V4 has changed dynamically as new studies are performed. Since V4 responds strongly to colour in both macaque monkeys and humans, it has become an area of interest to scientists. The V4 area was originally attributed to colour selectivity, but new evidence has shown that V4, as well as other areas of the visual cortex, are receptive to various inputs. V4 neurons are receptive to a number of properties, such as colour, brightness, and texture. It is also involved in processing shape, orientation, curvature, motion, and depth. The actual organization of hV4 in the cortex is still being investigated. In the macaque monkey, V4 spans the dorsal and ventral occipital lobe. Human experiments have shown that V4 only spans the ventral portion. This led to distinguishing hV4 from the macaque V4. A recent study from Winawer et al. analysing fMRI measurements to map the hV4 and ventral occipital areas showed variances between subjects used for hV4 mapping was at first attributed to instrumentation error, but Winawer argued that the sinuses in the brain interfered with fMRI measurements. Two models for hV4 were tested: one model had hV4 completely in the ventral side, and the second model had hV4 split into dorsal and ventral sections. It was concluded that it was still difficult to map the activity of hV4, and that further investigation was required. However, other evidence, such as lesions in the ventral occipital lobe causing achromatopsia, suggested that the ventral occipital area plays an important role in colour vision. = V4α = The search for the human equivalent of V4 led to the discovery of other areas that were stimulated by colour. The most significant was an area anterior in the ventral occipital lobe, subsequently named V4α. Further fMRI experiments found that V4α had a different function than V4, but worked cooperatively with it. V4α is involved in a number of processes, and is active during tasks requiring colour ordering, imagery, knowledge about colour, colour illusions, and object colour. = V4-V4α complex = The V4 and V4α areas are separate entities, but because of their close proximity in the fusiform gyrus, these two areas are often collectively called the V4-complex. Research into the V4-complex discovered that different chromatic stimulations activated either the V4 or the V4α area, and some stimulation parameters activated both. For example, naturally coloured images activated V4α more powerfully than V4. Unnaturally coloured images activated both V4α and V4 equally. It was concluded that the two sub-divisions co- operate with each other in order to generate colour images, but they are also functionally separate. A study by Nunn et al. on the activation of the V4-complex in people with visual synaesthesia from hearing spoken words was used to predict the location of the colour centre. Synaesthesia is the phenomenon where a sensory stimulus produces an automatic and involuntary reaction in a different sensation. In this study, people who would see colours upon hearing words were studied to see if the colour reaction could be traced to a specific cortical area. fMRI results showed that the left fusiform gyrus, an area consistent with V4, was activated when the subjects spoke. They also found a simultaneous activation of V4α. There was little activity in areas V1 and V2. These results validated the existence of the V4-complex in humans as an area specialized for colour vision. = V2 prestriate cortex = V2, also called the prestriate cortex, is believed to have a small role in colour processing by projecting signals from V1 to the V4-complex. Whether or not colour selective cells are present in V2 is still being investigated. Some optical imaging studies have found small clusters of red-green colour selective cells in V1 and V2, but not any blue-yellow colour selective cells. Other studies have shown that V2 is activated by colour stimuli, but not colour after images.[8] V4 also has feedback on V2, suggesting that there is a defined network of communication between the multiple areas of the visual cortex. When GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter, was injected into V4 cells, V2 cells experienced a significant decrease in excitability.  Research Methods  fMRI showing activity in the primary visual cortex V1. Functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI for short, has been key in determining the colour selective regions in the visual cortex. fMRI is able to track brain activity by measuring blood flow throughout the brain. Areas that have more blood flowing to them indicates an occurrence of neuronal activity. This change in blood flow is called haemodynamic response. Among the benefits of fMRI includes dynamic, real-time mapping of cortical processes. However, fMRI cannot track the actual firing of neurons, which happen on a millisecond timescale, but it can track the haemodynamic response, which happens on a seconds timescale. This method is ideal for tracking colour selective neurons because colour perception results in a visual after-image that can be observed in the neurons, which lasts about 15 seconds. Sakai et al. used fMRI to observe whether activation of the fusiform gyrus correlated with the perception of colour and the after image. The subjects in the Sakai study were placed in the fMRI machine and were subsequently subjected to various visual stimuli. A series of three images were shown to subjects while fMRI was used to focus on the haemodynamics of the fusiform gyrus. The first image was a pattern of six coloured circles. The next two images were achromatic. One of the images had a grey cross, and the other image had the same six circles as the first image, except they were six shades of grey that correlated with the coloured images. The subjects were cycled between the circle and cross images. During the cross images, the subjected perceived an after-image. The results of the experiment showed that there was a significant increase of activity in the fusiform gyrus when the subject viewed the colour image. This provided more evidence to the existence of the colour centre outside of the primary visual cortex.  Cerebral achromatopsia  Cerebral achromatopsia is a chronic condition where a person is unable to see colour, but they are still able to recognize shape and form. Cerebral achromatopsia differs from congenital achromatopsia in that it is caused by damage to the cerebral cortex as opposed to abnormalities in the retinal cells. The search for the colour centre was motivated by the discovery that lesions in the ventral occipital lobe led to colour blindness, as well as the idea that there are area specializations in the cortex. Many studies have shown that lesions in the areas commonly identified as the colour centre, such as V1, V2, and the V4-complex lead to achromatopsia. Cerebral achromatopsia occurs after injury to the lingual or fusiform gyrus, the areas associated with hV4. These injuries include physical trauma, stroke, and tumour growth. One of the primary initiatives to locating the colour centre in the visual cortex is to discover the cause and a possible treatment of cerebral achromatopsia. Simulation of cerebral achromatopsia. The extent of the symptoms and the damage is different from person to person. If a person has complete achromatopsia, then their entire visual field is devoid of colour. A person with dyschromatopsia, or incomplete achromtopsia, has similar symptoms to complete achromatopsia, but to a lesser degree. This can occur in people who had achromatopsia, but the brain recovered from the injury, restoring some colour vision. The person may be able to see certain colours. However, there are many cases where there is no recovery. Finally, a person with hemiachromatopsia see half of their field of vision in colour, and the other half in grey. The visual hemifield contralateral to a lesion in the lingual or fusiform gyrus is the one that appears grey, while the ipsilateral visual hemifield appears in colour. The variance in symptoms emphasizes the need to understand the architecture of the colour centre in order to better diagnose and possible treat cerebral achromotopsia.

In a career which lasted from July 1934 until September 1935 he was undefeated in nine races. The leading British two-year-old of 1934, he went on to take the Triple Crown in 1935 by winning the 2000 Guineas Stakes, Epsom Derby and St. Leger Stakes. He was retired to stud at the end of the year. After a promising start to his stud career in Britain he was exported to the United States, where he had moderate success before being exported again to Argentina. Background Bahram was a bay horse with a white star and strip foaled at the HH Aga Khan III's stud farm on The Curragh, Ireland. He was by the highly successful stallion Blandford, who sired four Derby winners and was British Champion sire on three occasions. His dam, Friar's Daughter, was inbred to St Simon in the third and fourth generations. Friar's Daughter won one small race, but was a good broodmare who produced eleven winners of over £58,000'Pryor, Peter, The Classic Connection, Cortney Publications, Luton, 1979 including Dastur, who finished runner-up in all three legs of the Triple Crown in 1932. Bahram stood 16.2 hands high, had a good temperament, and was described by equine experts as having flawless conformation. The Aga Khan originally registered the colt as \\"Bahman\\" but renamed him in honour of his cousin, who was killed in the torpedoing of the SS Sussex in 1916. Bahram was trained by Frank Butters for the Aga Khan at Newmarket in England. His regular rider was the veteran jockey Frederick Fox (1888–1945). Racing career =1934: two-year-old season= Bahram made his debut in the valuable National Breeders Produce Stakes at Sandown Park Racecourse in July for which he started a 20/1 outsider. He won by a neck from his more fancied stable companion Theft, who had won the Windsor Castle Stakes at Royal Ascot in a result which reportedly stunned the crowd. Later in July, Bahram won the Rous Memorial Stakes at Goodwood before being sent to York for the Gimcrack Stakes in which he ran lazily and had to be driven out to win by a length from Consequential. In the autumn he was sent to Newmarket where he won the Boscawen Stakes before contesting the Middle Park Stakes, one of the year's most prestigious races for juveniles, which he won in a record time of 1:11.2. In the Free Handicap, a rating of the season's best two-year-olds, Bahram was awarded top weight of 133 pounds, a pound ahead of his stable companions Theft and Hairan. =1935: three-year-old season= The Aga Khan in 1936 By the spring of 1935 Bahram had grown into a handsome, impressive horse with a placid, lazy temperament. He missed an intended run at Newmarket's Craven meeting in April and made his first appearance of the season in the 2000 Guineas. Ridden by Freddie Fox he started at odds of 7/2 in a field of sixteen runners. He won \\"comfortably\\" by one and a half lengths from Theft, with Sea Bequest two lengths away in third. A month after his win at Newmarket, Bahram started 5/4 favourite for the Derby at Epsom. The race was run in bright sunshine, despite previous heavy rain, and was attended by a crowd estimated at 500,000 including King George V who was celebrating his Silver Jubilee. Bahram was towards the rear of the field in the early stages but was always travelling well. Fox moved him up to third place at Tattenham corner before accelerating into the lead early in the straight. He won very comfortably by two lengths from Robin Goodfellow and Field Trial, with Theft in fourth. Later in June, Bahram started at odds of 1/8 in the St. James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot and won from Portfolio. In August, Bahram's training was delayed by the \\"coughing epidemic\\" which struck many British stables in late summer. At Doncaster in September, Bahram started 4/11 favourite for the St. Leger Stakes in his bid to become the first winner of the traditional Triple Crown since Rock Sand in 1903 (Pommern, Gay Crusader and Gainsborough had won wartime \\"Triple Crowns\\" but these included substitute races run at Newmarket). Since Rock Sand, four colts had attempted the feat but St. Amant (sixth in 1904), Minoru (4th in 1909), Manna (tenth in 1925) and Cameronian (tenth and last in 1931) had all been well-beaten at Doncaster. He was ridden by Charlie Smirke, Fox having sustained serious injuries in a fall the previous day. Bahram won very easily by five lengths from Solar Ray, with Buckleigh a further three lengths away in third.Ahnert, Rainer L. (editor in chief), “Thoroughbred Breeding of the World”, Pozdun Publishing, Germany, 1970 After the race Smirke claimed that Bahram could have won carrying \\"12 Stone and two riders\\". Assessment On Bahram's retirement, he was described as the \\"Horse of the Century\\" by his owner, an assessment with which the Daily Mail concurred, although The Times regarded him as inferior to Windsor Lad. In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Bahram the twenty-eighth best horse of the 20th Century and the seventh best Derby winner, behind Sea-Bird, Hyperion, Mill Reef, Nijinsky, Shergar and Windsor Lad. Bahram was reportedly even lazier at home than he was on the racecourse, making him a difficult horse to assess. His trainer, Frank Butters, admitted that \\"I never knew how good he was\\". Stud record At the end of the 1935 racing season Bahram was retired to Egerton Stud in Newmarket where he stood at a service fee of 500 guineas per mare. With just two crops racing, Bahram became the second leading sire in 1940 and leading juvenile sire of 1941. Among his English progeny were Big Game (2000 Guineas and Champion Stakes), Persian Gulf winner of the Coronation Cup and sire of the Derby winner Parthia, Turkhan, winner of the 1940 St. Leger Stakes and Irish Derby and Zabara, and the winners of 469 races. Bahram was also the damsire of Noor who competed successfully in England as well as in America where he would be inducted into the United States' National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. Following the German occupation of France during World War II, the Aga Khan fled France to the safety of Switzerland, and in September 1940, sold Bahram for £40,000 to an American syndicate made up of Walter P. Chrysler Jr., Alfred G. Vanderbilt II, James Cox Brady, Jr. and Sylvester Labrot, Jr. In 1941, the horse was brought to Vanderbilt's Sagamore Stud in Maryland then to Walter Chrysler Jr.'s North Wales Stud in Warrenton, Virginia. However, there was considerable resentment amongst British breeders against the Aga Khan for selling to overseas buyers all five of his Derby winners, particularly the three from the Blandford line, Bahram, Blenheim and Blenheim's son, Mahmoud. All of them were considered a severe loss to British breeding stock. In the US Bahram sired the winners of 660 races worth two million dollars. In 1946 Bahram was sold for a reported $130,000 to a stud farm in Argentina where he met with only modest success before his death at 24 years of age in 1956.

Attempts to make a living from catching and selling rabbits and breeding chinchilla rabbits were abandoned when he found he could make a better living writing articles and books.The Island, Lockley R, p82 He began to study migratory birds from 1928, establishing the first British bird observatory in 1933,The Natural History of Wales, Condry, W M, p249 and carrying out extensive pioneering research on breeding Manx shearwaters, Atlantic puffins and European storm-petrels.Skokholm and Skomer Nature Reserves Report for 1976 He was encouraged to record the exact incubation and fledging period of the Manx shearwater by Harry Witherby, the then editor of British Birds.The Island, Lockley, R.

He described his research in several books, including Dream Island (1930), Island Days (1934) and I Know an Island (1938). The work brought him to the notice of a wider circle of conservationists and naturalists, among them Peter Scott and Julian Huxley.Obituary: R. M. Lockley  The Independent (London) Lockley's notable scientific monograph Shearwaters is a result of a twelve years' study. He founded the Pembrokeshire Bird Protection Society which later became the West Wales Field Society. He urged the broadening of the activities of the original Society and the extension of its area to include the whole of West Wales and it was at his insistence that the West Wales Field Society was incorporated as the West Wales Naturalists' Trust.The WWNT and its Nature Resources 1975 With Julian Huxley he made one of the first professional (BFI) nature films, The Private Life of the Gannets (1934), which won an Oscar.http://www.newnaturalists.com/authors/pages/r-m-lockley.aspx Post war Lockley continued farming on the mainland when Skokholm was used by the military during the Second World War.

As chairman of the West Wales Field Society, he also led an unsuccessful campaign against the building of a large oil refinery at Milford Haven. His belief that successive British governments were not sufficiently aware of the threat to the landscape from industrial development led to his decision to emigrate to New Zealand in 1970, with his third wife. There he continued to write, mostly about islands and birds, but also novels, and to travel among the islands of Polynesia and in the Antarctic. Lockley was awarded an Honorary MSc by the University of Wales in 1977, in recognition of his distinction as a naturalist.Orielton.

His ashes were scattered from the boat Dale Princess, in the waters just off Skokholm Island in 2000.

It was collected by Leo Frobenius and published in his collection Speilmanns- Geschichten der Sahel (vol. 6, 1921). The English translation is by Douglas Fox, published in African Genesis (first printed 1937). This lyrical epic narrative tells the story of a prince that becomes a griot. Gassire is a prince who would be the successor of his father, but his father is very powerful. Gassire wants to be king very badly, and becomes a mighty warrior to demonstrate his strength. Gassire consults an old wise man who tells him that Gassire will abandon his quest to be king to play the lute. He also tells him that he will not be king and other people will become king after the death of his father, and the empire will fall. He hears the sound of the lute, and has one made for him because he loves the sound so much. When he tries to play the lute, it does not produce any sound. He hears that it can only be played if he goes into battle. He then hears that his sons must go to battle for the lute to play; in battle, seven of his sons die, but the lute will still not play. The people exiled him because of his violence and disregard for his family. He went into the desert with his one remaining son, his wives, and a few loyal friends. He finally can play the lute when he sings of the empire and the story provides lessons to all the people who listen. While the story has enchanted readers since it first appeared, it should be approached with dire caution. Frobenius attributes it to the Soninke people of West Africa, the people associated with the Empire of Wagadu or Ghana, and the name Gassire is in fact the Soninke word for a bard/singer (known as griots elsewhere in Western Africa). While many of the stories Frobenius collected can be confirmed by modern research in the oral tradition, this story stands alone and no analogue has yet been reported.

The film is based on the 1927 play Monsieur Lamberthier by Louis Verneuil. The screenplay was written by John Collier and Joseph Than. It stars Bette Davis, Paul Henreid, and Claude Rains, who had also appeared together in the highly successful Now, Voyager (1942).. Plot Christine Radcliffe is seen running in the rain up the stairs of a large symphony hall in which a concert is already underway with a performance of the Haydn cello concerto in D. Her eyes fill with tears as she recognizes the cellist on stage: Karel Novak who spent the war trapped in neutral Sweden. After his performance, Novak is mobbed by well-wishers, and a student reporter questions him about his favorite composers. Novak lists some famous ones, then adds, \\"And, of course, Hollenius.\\" Novak returns to his dressing room and as the concert is heard resuming after intermission with Schubert's Unfinished Symphony Christine enters and their eyes meet in his mirror. The couple embraces while Christine cries, \\"I thought you were dead. I saw them kill you.\\" Karel and Christine return to her apartment. Karel becomes suspicious of the rare artwork on display and the fur coat hanging in the closet. Christine has told Karel that she is living a precarious existence as a pianist but this conflicts with the evidence in the apartment. He confronts her, but frightens himself with his own vehemence and apologises to her, then says he's leaving. She stops him with the confession she lowered herself to taking \\"rich, untalented pupils\\" who gifted her with the suspicious items. They marry, but the composer Alexander Hollenius makes a dramatic entrance at their wedding reception. It is evident he is jealous, and the stress leads him to break a wine glass without deliberate intent. Hollenius soon gives Novak a manuscript score of his new cello concerto, which Novak agrees to perform at its premiere. It becomes apparent to Christine that a cellist in the orchestra, Bertram Gribble, is being tutored in the solo part by Hollenius. Suspecting the sabotage of her husband's career, she unsuccessfully attempts to bribe Gribble into not co-operating. Friction develops between Novak and Hollenius, and the composer angrily breaks off a dress rehearsal on the grounds of Novak's temperamental behavior. On the evening of the premiere, Christine visits Hollenius, who threatens to tell Novak of their love affair. Distraught, Christine shoots him dead. Another conductor, Neilsen, takes the place of the absent Hollenius, and the performance is a great success. While well-wishers wait, Christine confesses everything to her husband, and they leave the concert hall together. As they walk out a lady says, \\"Oh, Christine, you must be the happiest woman in the world,\\" which eventually elicits a wan smile from Christine. Cast * Bette Davis as Christine Radcliffe * Paul Henreid as Karel Novak * Claude Rains as Alexander Hollenius * John Abbott as Bertram Gribble * Benson Fong as Jimmy, Hollenius' servant Production The film was based on a play Monsieur Lamberthier by Louis Verneuil, which was first performed in Paris in 1927. It opened on Broadway as Jealousy on October 22, 1928 at Maxine Elliott's Theatre, as a two-hander (a play with only two main characters), with Fay Bainter and John Halliday. It was turned into a film, also titled Jealousy (1929), with Jeanne Eagels and Fredric March, and directed by Jean de Limur. The play was presented again on Broadway on October 1, 1946 under the title Obsession at the Plymouth Theatre, with Eugenie Leontovich and Basil Rathbone. Warner Bros. originally purchased the play as a vehicle for Barbara Stanwyck and Paul Henreid. According to TCM, Davis wanted Deception to be a two-character film, like the play. In the play, the character played by Rains is a voice on the phone. The 1929 film is set in Paris, and the characters are the owner of a dress shop, the young artist she marries, and the elderly boulevardier who bought the dress shop for her. The young man confesses, and the play ends with the expectation that he will get off easily. Glenn Erickson observes: “ In the original play the Karel Novak character is the one moved to violence at the conclusion, so Deception may be a case of a play distorted by the needs of the Hollywood Star Vehicle. Also gumming up the works is the Production Code, which wasn't about to accept a woman finding happiness after admitting to years of unmarried sex.” The working title of the film was “Her Conscience,” but Davis objected. The title “Jealousy” was not available. Paul Henreid says he enjoyed working with Bette Davis again but did not get along with Irving Rapper, the two men barely speaking to each other. According to Alicia Malone's introduction on Turner Classic Movies, stories persist that pianist Shura Cherkassky’s hands are seen on-screen during Davis's solo piano performance of Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 23, Opus 57 in F Minor (Appassionata), but the fact is that Davis rehearsed so thoroughly that she was able to synchronize with the recorded playback perfectly on the first take. Indeed, Malone adds, Davis wanted to become proficient enough to play live for the camera, but director Irving Rapper told her that it was not worth the effort, because no one would believe it. Henreid's cello playing was dubbed by Eleanor Aller, who was pregnant with her son Frederick Zlotkin, who is now a noted cellist. Her father, Gregory Aller, coached Henreid in plausible bow movements. For some scenes, Henreid’s arms were tied behind him, and two cellists put their arms through the sleeves of a specially designed coat. Hollenius' Cello Concerto was written by Erich Wolfgang Korngold, who composed the music for this film. Korngold subsequently expanded this material and published it as his own cello concerto. Near the beginning of the film, an eager student Jerry Spencer (Richard Erdman) asks Karel “Which of the living composers should I admire?” Karel demurs, but when asked who he likes best, he replies: “Stravinsky when I think of the present, Richard Strauss when I think of the past, and of course, Hollenius, who combines the rhythm of today with the melody of yesterday.” The last is an apt description of and probable tribute to Korngold. Bette Davis found out that she was pregnant during filming. Reception =Critical response= Despite the earlier success of Davis, Henreid, Rains and director Rapper, and generally positive reviews, Deception proved to be an expensive exercise for its producers. With high production costs and modest cinema patronage, it became the first Bette Davis film to lose money for Warner Bros. Film critic Dennis Schwartz generally liked the film, writing, \\"Irving Rapper (Shining Victory/Now, Voyager/Rhapsody in Blue) helms this labored romantic melodrama, a remake of the early talkie 1929 Jealousy that was also based on a Louis Verneuil play. It's written by John Collier and Joseph Than ... With classical music filling the background, cheesy soap opera dialogue in the forefront, histrionics taking over the concert hall, none of the characters being likable and Bette Davis as hammy as ever, this preposterous opera-like tale is amazingly enjoyable as straight theatrical drama that is nevertheless campy and could easily have been treated as comedy.\\"Schwartz, Dennis. Ozus' World Movie Reviews, film review, August 4, 2010. Accessed: July 11, 2013. Glenn Erickson notes that “The real fun is watching Claude Rains sink his teeth into a worthy role... Rains is always great when playing intense, articulate men imposing their will on others and his Hollenius is quite a creation. The haughty composer pauses more than once to tell Christine outright where she's going wrong, explaining to her how she makes it easy for him to control her. Rains' character is by far the most interesting, so it's no surprise that fans credit him with running away with the picture.” =Box office= According to Warner Bros. records, the film earned $2,132,000 domestically and $1,130,000 in foreign markets. =Accolades= The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2005: AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores – Nominated Home media On April 1, 2008, Warner Home Video released the film as part of the box set The Bette Davis Collection, Volume 3 before it was released as an individual DVD on July 12, 2015.

Looney Tunes cartoon, directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on August 27, 1955, and stars Bugs Bunny. The short is based on Robert Louis Stevenson's 1886 novella Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. The cartoon pits Bugs against Dr. Jekyll, who continues to turn into Mr. Hyde. The title is a play on the expression \\"neither hide nor hair.\\" Plot Bugs comes out of his rabbit hole in a city park every morning because a kind gentleman keeps coming to feed him a carrot (\\"Well, here I go again with the 'timid little rabbit' routine. It's shameful, but - eh, it's a living!\\"). At first feigning the on-all-fours posture of a real rabbit, Bugs eventually stands up and confides that he would rather simply go home with the gentleman as a \\"pet\\", since it would be easier for both of them. As the gentleman brings Bugs home, he remarks that it is strange that Bugs calls him \\"Doc\\" because, \\"I happen to be a doctor.\\" The camera then pans up to show that the name above the apartment is none other than Dr. Jekyll. Inside the house, Bugs gets used to his new surroundings. Going into a room with a door marked \\"laboratory\\" in search of a carrot for Bugs, Dr. Jekyll sees the fizzing, red potion that he knows he should not drink, but he gives in and drinks the potion anyway (\\"Oh, I'm so ashamed!!\\"). He then transforms into Mr. Hyde, with a monstrous green face and glowing red eyes. When Bugs sees him, he initially thinks he is a sick person who needs to see the doctor, he sits Hyde in a chair, but as he goes to get the doctor, Hyde swings an axe at Bugs, chopping a lamp in half. Bugs quickly realizes that this cackling, knuckle-dragging, axe-swinging monster is not someone to be heckled. Bugs runs away, calling out for the doctor. Soon the monster reverts to Dr. Jekyll. Bugs, still thinking that Hyde might benefit from seeing a doctor, tries leading Jekyll to the patient. On the way, the doctor changes into Hyde. After yelling for Jekyll again, then seeing that suddenly Hyde is gone and the doctor is back, Bugs decides they should hide in a storage room. Once more, Dr. Jekyll transforms into Mr. Hyde and Bugs, having reinforced the door, tears it open and escapes. Bugs heads for a closet and, seeing the doctor in the hallway, waves him inside and shuts the door. In the dark, another change occurs and Bugs flees, running into the laboratory. At this point, once he is the doctor again, Jekyll decides that he's going to pour the rest of the formula down the drain. He goes into his laboratory, but finds the beaker empty. He asks Bugs if he drank the potion; Bugs acts insulted at the idea and leaves (\\"I am going back to the park! There is no question of my integrity there.....\\"). Walking back to his park, Bugs transforms into a monstrous green rabbit, confirming Jekyll's suspicion that Bugs did drink the potion. The people at the park who are busy feeding the pigeons see the transformed Bugs and run away screaming. Bugs (who, unlike Dr. Jekyll, retained his usual personality and is unaware of the change in his appearance) wonders aloud, \\"Now what's eating THEM? Hmph! You'd think they never saw a rabbit before!\\" He chews on his carrot as the cartoon irises out. Allusions * In the cartoon, Bugs sits down at a piano, places a candelabra upon it, and utters the phrase, \\"I wish my brother George was here\\". The reference was to Liberace, who had a brother named George that was also his conductor on TV. It also references Liberace's personal appearances during the 1950s. Liberace's feature film debut Sincerely Yours, also produced by Warner Bros., was released around the same time as this cartoon. * The piano piece that Bugs plays is the Minute Waltz (Bugs pronounces \\"minute\\" as if to mean tiny) by Chopin, or as Bugs calls him \\"Choppin'.\\" * When Bugs first sees Mr. Hyde, he says Ralph Kramden's line to him, \\"You...are a mental case!\\" Appearances The cartoon is available on the Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 2 DVD box set. You can play Hyde Bugs in the Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal video game.

Archaeological evidence unearthed recently pinpoints the core area of Oiasso in the old quarter of Irun (Gipuzkoa) by the Spanish-French border, where harbour and bath remains have been discovered. However, two other focuses in Cape Higuer and hermitage Ama Xantalen (necropolis and mausoleum) point to a wider complex outside the main nucleus. Actually, some authors note that the name Oiasso may have applied to the whole valley, arguing that the very name of the Bidasoa River may stem from Latin \\"via ad Oiasso\\", eventually rendering Bidasoa in Basque. Furthermore, it is widely assumed that the name for the town Oiartzun some 10 km away may have developed from Oiasso. A Roman road linked this spot to ancient Pompaelo all the way through the Saltus Vasconum (the Vasconian wilderness), with the road being built to connect the Vasconian main town to the mines of Arditurri set in the massif of Aiako Harria. Romans showed an early interest on them on account of the ore (largely silver and copper) they could extract from them, using the port and factories of Oiasso to process and dispatch the freight away. A museum was founded recently in Irun to cater for the interest the vestiges unveiled have aroused and for tourism. Earlier it was misidentified with current San Sebastián, that is still nicknamed la bella Easo (\\"The beautiful Easo\\", a Hispanization of Oiasso).

It is the official summer residence of the King of Norway.Bygdøy kongsgård (Store norske leksikon)  History  = Middle ages = The estate originally belonged to the Cistercian monastery on Hovedøya. At the end of the thirteenth century, Bygdøy was purchased from the Hovedøya monastery by King Haakon V of Norway as a gift for his wife, Queen Euphemia of Rügen. Their daughter, Ingeborg of Norway, later returned the island to the monastery. It was acquired by the king during the Protestant Reformation to supply Akershus Fortress and garrison. The King would also use the estate for hunting and a hunting lodge. A zoological garden was set up by King Christian IV of Denmark-Norway. = Current estate = The current main building was erected in 1733 as a summer residence and maison de plaisance for the Danish Governor of Norway, Christian Rantzau (1684-1771). King Christian Frederick lived on the estate in 1814 after he was forced to give up the throne and before he left for Denmark. Following the establishment of the Swedish-Norwegian Union, King Charles III purchased the remaining estate grounds from the Norwegian government in 1837. King Oscar I would later erect the palace Oscarshall close to the estate grounds while his son, King Charles IV, later sold much of the estate back to the government. King Oscar II, the last king of the union, invested considerably in the estate and constructed six villas which functioned as both residences and guest houses (only one of these villas exists today). King Oscar II also established the world's first open-air museum on the estate in the year 1881, a museum which in 1907 was overtaken by the Norwegian Museum of Cultural History. = Recent years = After the election of King Haakon VII in 1905, the King and Queen Maud lived their first year in Norway at the estate while the Royal Palace in Oslo was refurbished. Queen Maud created new English landscape and rock gardens on the estate grounds with the help of Charles Edward Hubbard. The royal family would later use the estate as a summer residence, a tradition which was continued by King Olav V and later King Harald V.Royal residences in Norway (Tor Dagre) A comprehensive restoration of the main building and gardens began in 2004. The buildings and gardens have undergone extensive refurbishments and the estate is again set to be the regular summer residence of Harald V and Queen Sonja .Bygdø Kongsgard (The Royal House of Norway) As a birthday present when the king and queen turned 70 in the year 2007, the Norwegian government restored a statue of Herman Wedel-Jarlsberg, which was erected by King Charles IV and unveiled in 1845, while also restoring the original buildings in the Dronningberget-park which is close to the estate.

The primary recruiters of under the age of 18 children are the rebel LTTE movement and the Karuna group (a break-away faction of the LTTE working with Sri Lanka Forces). LTTE recruitment Before 2007 the LTTE was accused of recruiting thousands of children into their ranks. The LTTE has been accused of knowingly recruiting and using child soldiers as front-line troops. Amid international pressure, LTTE announced in July 2003 that it would stop conscripting child soldiers, but both UNICEF and HRW have accused it of reneging on its promises, and of conscripting Tamil children orphaned by the tsunami. UNICEF claimed that LTTE recruited at least 40 children orphaned by the tsunami. However, from the beginning of 2007 LTTE agreed to release all of the recruits under the age of 18. =2007= According to UNICEF, between November 1, 2006 and August 31, 2007, 262 children were recruited by the LTTE; this figure includes 32 children who were rerecruited after being released. This number shows a significant decrease in recruitment as compared to the previous 12-month period, which saw the LTTE recruit 756 children, of whom 97 were rerecruits.Associated Press of Pakistan - Sri Lankan rebels still recruiting child soldiers : UN chief The LTTE promised that it would release all of the recruits under the age of 18 before the end of the year. On 18 June 2007, the LTTE released 135 children under the age of 18. On 22 October 2007, UNICEF claimed that at least 506 child recruits (under the age of 18) still remained under the LTTE. UNICEF further noted that there had been a significant drop in recruitment of children by the LTTE.Sri Lanka: Amnesty International urges LTTE to live up to its pledge to end child recruitment  Amnesty International Furthermore, a report released by the LTTE's Child Protection Authority (CPA) in 2008 reported that fewer than 40 child soldiers, under the age of 18, still remained in their forces.LTTE PS: Status of UNICEF database on underage LTTE members In January 2008, the LTTE claimed that they had stopped child recruitment. Despite the LTTE claims according to the UNICEF a total of 594 children aged between 12 and 18 years surrendered to armed forces during the end of the war. TMVP Paramilitary Recruitment and Sri Lankan Army Involvement More recently, TMVP known as the Karuna Group (A Tamil paramilitary group which supports the Sri Lankan government), has been held responsible for the abduction of children according to UNICEF and Human Rights Watch. Allan Rock, who is a special advisor to the UN Special Rapporteur for Children and Armed Conflict Dr. Radhika Coomaraswamy, alleged that government forces had forcibly rounded up young Tamil children to fight with Col Karuna's group. Colonel Karuna, while categorically denying any involvement in abducting children, questioned Rock's impartiality, stating that Allan Rock is a former politician with links to the LTTE who had previously helped the LTTE in Canada. Civilians have also complained that the TMVP is continuing to abduct children, including some in their early teens, for use as soldiers. Allan Rock vowed that he had \\"credible evidence\\" for the accusations. The government of Sri Lanka and the Government newspaper Daily News asked Mr. Rock to produce substantive proof that Sri Lankan soldiers collaborated in child soldier recruitment. The new report by the United Nations stated that TMVP still recruits children. The UN further noted that children have been abducted in places like Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps in Sri Lanka.

The road travels northward, much of it along the shore of Lake Michigan before reaching its terminus at the entrance to Ludington State Park. The roadway has been in the state highway system since the late 1920s. It has been realigned a few times, most recently in the late 1990s. Route description M-116 begins in Ludington at the intersection of James Street and Ludington Avenue. It is at this intersection where US 10 turns southward and heads to the Ludington–Manitowoc ferry docks. From here, M-116 continues westward along Ludington Avenue through a mixed commercial area for about one- half mile (0.8 km) before turning north on Lakeshore Drive. The road continues as North Lakeshore Drive through resident areas and passes the Lakeview Cemetery. Before passing the Lincoln Hills Golf Club, M-116 crosses a narrow section of Lincoln Lake and then curves westward towards the shore of Lake Michigan as it approaches the state park. The route runs along the coast of Lake Michigan for the remainder of its route, through an area of sand dunes, until reaching its northern terminus at the entrance to Ludington State Park. Ludington State Park is bound to the west by Lake Michigan, the north by sand dunes and to the east by Hamlin Lake. As such, M-116 provides the only road access to the park from the south. The park encompasses offering biking, hiking, fishing, tubing, boating and ice skating in the winter. The park is also home to the tall Big Sable Point Lighthouse, built in 1867, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Big Sable Point Lighthouse The highway is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT), which is responsible for maintaining and constructing transportation infrastructure in the state, including highways. As part of this role, the department periodically conducts surveys on their highways to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2009, MDOT calculated that 7,377 vehicles used the southern section of M-116 daily near the US 10 junction. On the north end, only 859 vehicles used the roadway near the state park entrance each day. The highway has not been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. In December 2014, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder authorized a portion of the highway in Ludington State Park between Little River and Big Sable in Mason County to be named \\"The Paul K. Butterfield II Memorial Highway\\", in honor of that Michigan State Police Trooper who was murdered during a traffic stop there in 2013. The ceremony to do so took place in early February 2015. History M-116 was first designated in May or June 1928 from the north city limit of Ludington north to the Sable River, but not all of it was built and open to traffic. It was extended southerly in 1931 into the city of Ludington to US 10. There was a new alignment closer to the lakeshore opened in early 1933. The northern end was extended in late 1935 to encompass the Big Sable River bridge. The last change to the routing was made in 1998 when US 10 was shifted to follow James Street instead of William Street to the car ferry docks. At that time, M-116 was extended east along Ludington Avenue to end at James Street.

Because of its production potential and popularity as a vegetable in various cuisines, it can be raised as a cash crop. Origin The elephant foot yam is used as food in Island Southeast Asia, Mainland Southeast Asia, South Asia, New Guinea, Oceania, and Madagascar. Its origin and center of domestication was formerly considered to be India, where it is most widely utilized as a food resource in recent times. But a genetic study in 2017 have shown that Indian populations of elephant foot yams have lower genetic diversity than those in Island Southeast Asia, therefore it is now believed that elephant foot yams originated from Island Southeast Asia and spread westwards into Thailand and India, resulting in three independent domestication events. From Island Southeast Asia, they were also spread even further west into Madagascar, and eastwards to coastal New Guinea and Oceania by the Austronesian migrations, though they may have spread south into Australia without human intervention. Description =Flowering= The plant blooms annually around the beginning of the rainy season. The flower bud emerges from the corm as a purple shoot, and later blooms as a purple inflorescence. The pistillate (female) and staminate (male) flowers are on the same plant and are crowded in cylindrical masses as an inflorescence. The top part is responsible for secreting mucus that gives off a putrid, pungent smell that is used to attract pollinating insects, the middle part of the inflorescence contains staminate, and the base of the inflorescence contains pistillate. The stigmas of the female flowers will be receptive on the first day of the bloom, when the pungent smell draws pollinating insects inside, and the inflorescence closes, trapping them for a night to allow the pollen deposited on the insect to be transferred to the stigmas. Later in the second day, the female flower is no longer receptive to pollens, the male flowers start to bloom, and the inflorescence opens again. This allows the pollen to be deposited on the emerging insects to pollinate other flowers, while preventing the pollen from the same inflorescence fertilising itself, preventing inbreeding. In 24–36 hours, after the first bloom of the inflorescence, the inflorescence's female flowers start developing into berries bright red fruiting bodies, and other parts of the inflorescence start wilting away. The berries are red when ripe and are not quite round, being subglobose or ovoid. While the flowers are in bloom they also produce heat. They die after five days.

It is usually eaten as mashed or fried or added to curries and, more rarely used in pickle or to make Ol chips. In Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat, It is called Suran. In Bihar, it is used in oal curry (i.e. Elephant Foot curry), oal bharta or chokha, pickles and chutney. Oal chutney is also called Barabar chutney as it has mango, ginger and oal in equal quantities, hence the name barabar (meaning \\"in equal amount\\"). In Chhattisgarh, it is called Zimmikanda. It is eaten as curry and is a delicacy among people of Chhattisgarh. In Tripura, it is called Batema and prepared by making a paste with sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) and water to remove its raphides (calcium oxalate needles). The paste is shaped into buns and boiled with water containing baking soda, after which the water is discarded. The buns are then cut into pieces and combined with fresh garlic paste and mosdeng (a spicy paste of dried fish/shrimp and chili). Also, the leaves and stems are eaten by chopping them into pieces and frying. In Southern India, especially Kerala, it is known as Chena (ചേന), the tuber has been a part of people's diet for centuries. In Tamil it is called kaaraa karunai kizangu( காறாக்கருணைக் கிழங்கு), chénaikkizangu (சேனைக்கிழங்கு). It is mainly served as steamed pieces (പുഴുക്ക്) along with traditional chutney made of green chilli, coconut oil, shallots and garlic although the curry preparation is also common as a side dish for rice. It is made into a thick chutney (masiyal, மசியல்), typically eaten as an accompaniment with a rice dish. It has served as the main source of carbohydrates especially during the famine-stricken days of the region in the past along with the more popular tapioca. The flower bud before it blooms is also used for making curry. All parts of the flower can be used for making different types of side dishes. =As medicine= The elephant-foot yam is widely used in Indian medicine and is recommended as a remedy in all three of the major Indian medicinal systems: Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani. The corm is prescribed in those systems for a variety of ailments. The tuber is reported to be useful in treatment of piles.

The term derives from the \\"whiteout\\" weather condition where a snowstorm causes loss of vision, and refers to the way one's skin turns pale during and after a fainting or vomiting episode. While fainting is usually only a problem for those with low blood pressure, it can become possible for those without hypotension to faint after using cannabis or other drugs which have the short-term effect of lowering the blood pressure. Whiteying is perceived by the stoner subculture as the result of using too much cannabis within too short a period of time. This is known as greening out. In fact the factors that usually facilitate fainting are tiredness, lack of fluids, and food, a hot and humid environment, as well as natural hypotension. They are just as important as the amount of cannabis involved. Moreover, of note is that a frequent occurrence of these symptoms is likewise preceded by the consumption of cannabis or hashish mixed with tobacco and that the initial symptoms of nicotine poisoning are similar in scope.https://forum.grasscity.com/threads/is-a-whitey-tobacco-related.1265785/  Is a whitey tobacco related?

He bequeathed 100,000 marks (equivalent to 1,000,000 pounds in 1997 money) to the first person to prove Fermat's Last Theorem. He was the younger of two sons of a banker, Joseph Carl Theodor Wolfskehl. His older brother, the jurist Wilhelm Otto Wolfskehl, took over the family bank after the death of his father. From 1875 to 1880 Paul Wolfskehl studied medicine at the Universities of Leipzig, Tübingen and Heidelberg. In 1880 he received his doctorate from the Heidelberg University. At about this time, he began to suffer from multiple sclerosis, which eventually forced him to pursue another career. From 1880 to 1883 he studied mathematics at the universities of Bonn and Bern. In 1887 he habilitated at the Technische Hochschule Darmstadt and became a Privatdozent for mathematics at the university. There are a number of theories concerning the prize's origin. The most romantic is that he was spurned by a young lady and decided to commit suicide, but was distracted by what he thought was an error in a paper by Ernst Kummer, who had detected a flaw in Augustin Cauchy's attempted proof of Fermat's famous problem. This rekindled his will to live and, in gratitude, he established the prize. This story was traced by Philip Davis and William Chinn in their 1969 book 3.1416 and All That to renowned mathematician Alexander Ostrowski, who supposedly heard it from another, unidentified source. Another, more prosaic story claims that Wolfskehl wanted to leave as little as possible to his shrewish wife. Yet another story, told in \\"The man who loved only numbers\\" by Paul Hoffman, tells that Wolfskehl actually missed his supposed suicide time because he was in the library studying the Theorem. Upon realizing that, he concluded that the contemplation of mathematics was more rewarding than a beautiful woman so he decided not to kill himself. He bankrolled the Theorem because it \\"saved his life\\". On June 27, 1997, the prize was finally won by Andrew Wiles. By then, due in part to the hyperinflation Germany suffered after the end of World War I, the award had dwindled to £30,000. The play From Abstraction by Robert Thorogood is based on the life of Paul Wolfskehl. It was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 1 November 2006 and 29 August 2008.

The battle Weeks before, Coligny had lifted the siege of Poitou and positioned his army in hopes of gaining an advantage over the approaching Royalist forces. However, a flanking maneuver by Saulx-Tavannes forced him to reposition his forces. This coincided with Henry's objective to keep Coligny's army from joining Gabriel, Comte de Montgomery's forces. The battle consisted of multiple charges by the royal forces, during which Coligny was wounded in the jaw, forcing Louis of Nassau to take command. Henry was subsequently unhorsed during a charge, but was saved by his bodyguards. Philibert, Margrave of Baden-Baden, who commanded the Royalist Germans, was killed during a cavalry charge. Nassau, in turn, charged the Swiss pikemen but made no headway. A final charge by Swiss pikemen shattered the Huguenot landsknechts line, in which over half were killed. As a result, three thousand Huguenots surrendered. Nassau and the rest of the cavalry were able to withdraw in good order. Aftermath Henry then besieged Saint-Jean-d'Angély from 16 October to 2 December. Coligny regrouped, marched east into the Rhone and, months later, marched towards Paris.

Although, this was the bloodiest day of the bombing, it was also the last. Consequences NATO missile hit the area between two apartment buildings and elementary school \\"Svetozar Marković Toza\\". =Impact on civilians= The civilians of Novi Sad were greatly affected by the bombing of their city. The city's oil refinery was bombarded daily, causing severe pollution and widespread ecological damage. Direct impact The bombing caused civilian deaths and injuries. Those who were not directly physically harmed suffer from consequences for their physical health caused by ecological damage as well as permanent consequences for psychological health caused by almost 3 months of trauma and fear. Due to the NATO attacks, many in Novi Sad were left jobless. Notably, NATO were accused of failing to give \\"effective advance warning\\" of attacks which may affect civilians, as required by Protocol I. One such attack where NATO was accused of this was the bombing of the Ministry of Education in Novi Sad, premises which administered social welfare programmes. Impact on infrastructure Liberty Bridge destroyed in NATO air strike. The NATO bombing left the city without any of its three Danube bridges, communications, water, and electricity, which severely impaired the day to day living of the residents of Novi Sad. All three bridges have been rebuilt as of 2018 Žeželj Bridge. Water supplies (including drinking water) for parts of the city were cut off as a result of the bombing. One attack cut off water supplies to 40,000 people in Petrovaradin, and severely disrupted water supplies to 300,000 people in Novi Sad. Services were restored only after two years, partially due to funding from Britain, one of the countries which bombed targets in the city in 1999. Impact on environment Refinery hit by NATO missile. Smoke from bombed Novi Sad's refinery. The bombing of Novi Sad had implications for the environment. A United Nations study (the BTF ‘Industrial Sites’ and ‘Danube’ missions) found that there were serious environmental issues, \\"requiring immediate action\\", some of which resulted from the bombing. The bombing of Novi Sad's refinery caused fires which burned 50,000 tons of crude oil, sending toxins and carcinogens into the air and contaminating groundwater. The BTF study was complicated by the heavy pollution that existed before the bombing, with the group noting that \\"the enforced shutdown of the refinery may even have led to local improvements in the aquatic environment, due to a possible reduction in chronic pollution\\". Once all the samples for Novi Sad (Danube Mission) were collated, \\"based on field observation and results from sample analysis, the BTF concluded that there was no evidence of significant adverse impacts on the Danube aquatic environment as a result of air strikes on Novi Sad refinery. It is thought that most of the oils and oil products released were burned and that no significant volume entered the river\\". The BTF study also found that prior to the air strikes, local technicians helped minimise the potential harmful effects of air strikes by \\"removing oil products that could be harmful to human health if spilt or burnt, such as transformer oil containing PCBs. Production was also accelerated to use up as much as possible of the crude oil, intermediate products and additives, and the final products were shipped to other locations. The remaining oil was mixed with gasoline, so that the tanks would ignite if hit, rather than leak into the soil and groundwater\\". Local scientists also studied the impact of the bombing. \\"NATO didn’t use chemical weapons during the bombing\\", said Dr. Zorka Vukmirović, a leading environmental physicist, \\"But indirectly it caused the effects of chemical weapons use. If you release so many hazardous substances, major air pollutants and carcinogens in the vicinity of big cities like Belgrade and Niš, it is obviously a deliberate action against the civilian population\\". Not until 2003, the Danube river was declared clear again. It took four years of work by the Danube Commission to remove the debris of bombed bridges and ordnance. The clearing of the debris was not only important for Novi Sad, but for European states (Hungary & Romania) who were economically impacted by the blockade of river traffic to the Black sea caused by the bombing. The views of the respective parties NATO was accused of committing war crimes due to the nature of some of the bombing raids. Some Novi Sad residents found it ironic that Novi Sad was so heavily targeted by NATO due to the fact that during the time of the bombing, the city was ruled by the local Democratic Opposition, which was against the regime in Belgrade. Therefore, some citizens of Novi Sad were not able to understand why the city was targeted heavily for the events in Kosovo. A press release one year on from the bombing by then NATO Secretary General Robertson, claims that NATO encountered complications from Yugoslav military use of civilian buildings and human shields. NATO officials have \\"expressed deep regret at any civilian casualties it caused\\". NATO claims that the bombing of targets such as bridges was aimed at impairing the Yugoslav Army's command and control structure. However, the efficacy of the campaign and choice of targets was brought into question by human rights groups, after bridges of no conceivable strategic relevance to the military situation in Kosovo were bombed, including a bridge which led to Hungary, a NATO country. MAICL argued that the civilian deaths caused were clearly disproportionate to the military benefits in response to NATO's justification of actions.

EPSSs can help an organization to reduce the cost of training staff while increasing productivity and performance. They can empower employees to perform tasks with a minimum amount of external intervention or training. By using this type of system an employee, especially a new employee, will often not only be able to complete his or her work more quickly and accurately, but, as a secondary benefit, will also learn more about the job and the employer's business. An EPSS is best considered when *workers require knowledge to achieve individual performance in a business environment *skilled performers are spending a lot of time helping less skilled performers *new workers must begin to perform immediately and training is impractical, unavailable or constrained *employees need to be guided through a complex process or task that cannot be memorized. These situations often occur when new systems (e.g. customer relationship management, enterprise resource planning) are introduced, upgraded or consolidated, and in certain call centres when agents must perform using complex systems, processes or products. Components There are different views about the components and characteristics of EPSS. For example, from Barker and Banerji’s (1995) point of view, an EPSS has four functional levels, which should be brought together: #the user interface shell (the human computer interface) and the database #generic tools (help system, documentation, text retrieval system, intelligent agents, tutoring facility, simulation tools and communication resources) #application-specific support tools #a target application domain (schools, particular business settings, military, etc.).  Advantages  #Reducing the complexity or number of steps required to perform a task #Providing the performance information an employee needs to perform a task #Providing a decision support system that enables an employee to identify the action that is appropriate for a particular set of conditions  Definitions  In Electronic Performance Support Systems, Gloria Gery defined EPSS as: > an integrated electronic environment that is available to and easily > accessible by each employee and is structured to provide immediate, > individualized > on-line access to the full range of information, software, guidance, advice > and > assistance, data, images, tools, and assessment and monitoring systems to > permit > job performance with minimal support and intervention by others. Also, in 1991, Barry Raybould gave a shorter definition:An EPSS Case Study: Prime Computer, Barry Raybould. 1991, Ariel PSS Corporation. > a computer-based system that improves worker productivity by providing on- > the-job access to integrated information, advice, and learning experiences. From a business perspective, a former Nortel Networks executive, William Bezanson (2002) provided a definition linked to application usability and organizational results:Performance Support Solutions: Achieving Goals Through Enabling User Performance. William Bezanson, 2002, Trafford Publishing > A performance support system provides just-in-time, just enough training, > information, tools, and help for users of a product or work environment, to > enable optimum performance by those users when and where needed, thereby > also enhancing the performance of the overall business.  EPSS versus online help  An EPSS must be distinguished from a traditional online help system. Online help usually supports a single software application and is not necessarily focused on the entire range of job tasks (which may involve multiple applications), but just that specific software. With online help, cross-referencing is often not available and the information provided is limited and rarely combined with procedures or complex tasks. Perhaps most critically, on-line help cannot be customized to the user or the job task; in fact, the same software screen may require different inputs depending on the user and job task. Online help is also not contextual to the user's current situation and requires users to search through for the solution to their problem.  EPSS versus e-learning simulations  EPSS must also be differentiated from e-learning simulations that replay a series of steps on- demand within a software application. Simulations are more closely associated with on-demand training, not just-in-time support, because of the longer time considerations, complexity, and media restrictions for playing a simulation. An EPSS can be considered a part of the e-learning category, as it is on- demand learning, and notes that the EPSS modality fits more within the informal learning definition.  EPSS versus knowledge management  In his book, Bezanson points out that \\"knowledge management\\" is the noun corresponding to the verb of \\"performance support\\". The knowledge documented in the system plays a critical role in any EPSS system. This concept was originated by Raybould (1997)The Five Phases of Migration from Training to Knowledge Management, Barry Raybould, CBT Solutions July/August 1997 who separates out the repository, delivery and infrastructure aspects of the EPSS from the knowledge base it contains. In fact, Bezanson emphasizes the advantage that an LMS (learning management system) will interface with the EPSS to supply the knowledge base, content-courseware, or other tracking capabilities that an EPSS may require if the LMS precedes the implementation of the EPSS.  EPSS versus training  EPSS's role in the future of training and work have been noted by followers of the trend towards more informal learning systems driven by knowledge management systems. Tony O'Driscoll (1999) summarizes: > As the pace of technological change speeds up, many jobs will require > constant adaptation, because of new information and new task requirements. > In this context, the distinction between learning and work will disappear. A > trend toward integrating training with on-the-job activities will be a > result. This trend will extend itself to the point that training, as a > distinct function, will no longer be the primary learning vehicle for many > types of jobs. Works will use on-the-job information systems instead. To this day, analysts such as Forrester's Claire Schooley and Bersin & Associates' Chris Howard write similarly themed articles based on their research in informal learning, technology and training.

The play launched the career of the author's wife Maria Carmi, who went on to star in 25 silent films. Plot Vollmöller's play wordlessly tells the story of a wayward nun who deserts her convent with a knight, influenced by the music of an evil minstrel. A statue of the Virgin Mary comes to life and takes the physical place of the nun (as a type of Doppelgängerin), who makes her way through the world and its many vicissitudes. She is eventually accused of witchcraft, but escapes. Finally, the nun returns to the convent with her dying infant, and is forgiven as the statue of the Madonna resumes its place. History Charles B. Cochran, writing about Max Reinhardt in his autobiography, Showman Looks On: \\"Our first close association was with the creation of The Miracle, which arose from a suggestion made to him by me in the café at Budapest that he should produce for me a mystery play of the Middle Ages.... At the café table Reinhardt gave me a letter of introduction to Karl Vollmoller who, on my suggestion, prepared a scenario. It was accepted, and I worked in close collaboration with Max Reinhardt, Ernst Stern and Engelbert Humperdinck, until it was produced at Olympia in 1911.\\" The play first appeared as a vast spectacle-pantomime directed by Max Reinhardt at the London Olympia on 21 December 1911, with principal actors, cast and musical performers numbering around 1,700. The music was specially composed by Engelbert Humperdinck, who suffered a stroke while conducting one of the performances at the indoor arena. Thereafter the production toured continental Europe, ending in Berlin at the on 13 May 1914. The play was revived on Broadway in 1924 after a tour of Detroit, Milwaukee and Dallas. The New York version, which opened January 16, 1924 at the Century Theatre was produced by Morris Gest, and starred Rosamond Pinchot as the Nun and Lady Diana Cooper and Maria Carmi alternating nightly in the role of the Madonna.New York Times, January 24, 1924. Spanish versions The play has its origins in a 12th- century legend which Spanish writer José Zorrilla y Moral turned into a dramatic poem entitled Margarita La Tornera (Margarita the Gatekeeper). The poem differs from The Miracle in resetting the story in 19th-century Spain, as the 1959 film would do, and in not letting the reader know that the statue has taken the nun's place in the convent until nearly the very end. Zorrilla's poem was made 1909 into an opera (Margarita la tornera) by Spanish zarzuela composer Ruperto Chapí. It was his last work before his death. The poem was also loosely adapted into a Spanish film, Milagro de amor, directed by Francisco Múgica in 1946. Film versions The play was adapted into film three times. The original authorized version was a British financed, full- length, hand-colored, black-and-white film The Miracle, filmed in Austria in 1912. In the same year an unauthorized German version was filmed, titled Das Mirakel. In 1959 the play was adapted to film a third time, by Warner Brothers, again titled The Miracle, directed by Irving Rapper.

The written sign developed from the drawing of an arrow, since the words meaning \\"arrow\\" and \\"life\\" were pronounced similarly in the Sumerian language. With the determinative UZU 𒍜 \\"flesh, meat\\", UZUTI, it means \\"rib\\". This homophony is exploited in the myth of Ninti (𒊩𒌆𒋾 NIN.TI \\"lady of life\\" or \\"lady of the rib\\"), created by Ninhursag to cure the ailing Enki.

Each building is 3½ stories tall, and overlooks a picturesque pond and woods to the west; a parking lot packed with trucks and industrial equipment on the south; and nineteenth century housing on Beverly Heights to the north.  Significance  Nathan Starr, Sr., a scythe manufacturer, purchased land on the West (no Coginchaug) River in Staddle Hill in 1799. Joined by his son, Nathan Jr. in 1812, Starr began the first of a long series of government contracts to produce swords, pistols, and eventually rifles. They constructed a factory here in 1812, which is probably the easternmost building sited by the pond. After Nathan Sr's death in 1821, his son carried on the business until 1845. During this period some 70,000 arms of varied kinds were made here, as well as a number of commemorative swords for national heroes, such as Andrew Jackson. From 1845 to 1864 the factory was relatively inactive. In the latter year the Russell Manufacturing Company bought the property; in 1865 they erected the building immediately to the west of the original plant in a similar height, scale, material, and style. This was an auxiliary operation, complementing the main South Farms factories; Russell conducted manufacturing here for some ninety years. A plumbing products firm and then a lighting fixture company ran short- lived manufacturing operations here; the facilities were vacant in the late 1960s. Joseph J. Vinci bought the property in 1971. Several small businesses currently operate here, including a cabinetmaker, garment shop and welding outfit. The Starr Mill is an archetypical nineteenth century mill: a tall, many-windowed brick building beside a mill pond. There have been few major exterior alterations. Rounded-arched brownstone sluiceways (now bricked up) run beneath the building. On each end of the building three gable end chimney stacks terminate in the attic. Artifacts from former functions of the mill abound. A late 19th century turbine lines in the water near the southeastern corner of the earlier building. This complex is a well-preserved and significant industrial site which has been successfully adapted to light manufacturing uses. The buildings are presently used for mixed use of retail, office, artist studios, professional service space and storage. The structures are well maintained.

Remington reports that 107,345 rifles were manufactured in .22 Short or .22 Long Rifle. A similar rifle is currently being sold by Browning Arms Company (the Browning SA-22 Browning 22 Semi-Auto rifle). The Remington Model 241 (and indeed all the semi-automatic .22 rifles based on John Browning's design) is a takedown design in which the barrel can be easily separated from the receiver to shorten the rifle's length for ease in transporting. When Remington brought out the Model 241 in 1935 it replaced the Model 24 which, although of slightly smaller size (and having a few other differences), was also based on John Browning's semi-automatic .22 rifle design. The Remington Model 241 is very similar to the Browning SA-22 with the significant difference being the way in which the barrels are adjusted so that they fit snuggly against the receivers when the rifles are fully assembled. This barrel tightening feature is made necessary due to their takedown designs (a means must be provided so that the barrel is sufficiently tight when coupled to the receiver and yet not so tight as to make disengaging the barrel from the receiver overly difficult). Whereas the Browning SA-22's barrel tightening is accomplished with an adjusting ring at the base of the barrel (and can easily be seen) where it butts up against the receiver - the Remington Model 241's barrel tightening mechanism uses a dual-sided nut (with an interrupted-screw thread in the interior and a full thread cut into the exterior) riding inside the threaded hole in the front of the receiver (only visible when the barrel is separated from the receiver). Selecting how deeply the dual-sided nut sits in the receiver (with the dual- sided nut's exterior thread meshing with the thread cut into the hole in the front of the receiver) controls how tightly the barrel fits against the receiver when it is attached (the rifle is assembled). Persons wishing to make adjustments to the Model 241's barrel tightening mechanism must become familiar not only with the use of the dual-sided nut (that fits in the hole in the front of the receiver) but also how that nut is locked in-place (so that it will not accidentally turn once it has been set as desired). What appears to be a flat blade screw head on the right side of the Model 241's receiver, that can easily be mistaken as a screw to lock the dual-sided nut in place, is actually a cosmetic affectation on what has sometimes been described as a 'slug' (instead of having threads on its sides as would a screw it has smooth sides). While the slug does indeed press (inside the receiver) against the outside of the dual-sided nut (and thus keeps the dual-sided nut from rotating) it does not have its pressure against the outside of the dual-sided nut adjusted by rotating (as it would were it a screw) but instead the slug is held pressing against the outside of the dual-sided nut by first being simply pushed against the outside of the dual-sided nut (by pressing down on the slug's flat blade screw head appearance on the right side of the receiver) and then a screw (the actual locking-screw) presses against the side of the slug (inside the receiver) and thus prevents it from moving. That locking-screw is oriented such that it comes in (to press against the side of the slug) from the direction of the front face of the receiver (and so is only visible when the barrel is separated from the receiver). To adjust the Model 241's barrel tightness it is necessary to first loosen the dual-sided nut so that it can rotate and thus have its depth within the receiver changed. To loosen the dual-sided nut requires that the 'slug' pressing against it be loosened and to accomplish that the locking-screw (accessible from the face of the receiver when the barrel is removed) must be backed-out so that it isn't pressing against the slug. The slug is then jiggled (by a gentle rocking action on the false screw head of the exterior appearance of the slug - no attempt should be made to rotate the slug as if it were a screw as it has a machined appearance meshing with the outer threads of the dual-sided nut) and that will be sufficient so that the slug disengages (within the receiver) from the outside of the dual-sided nut (so the dual-sided nut is then free to be adjusted). The Model 241's elegant barrel tightening mechanism can be damaged if these steps are not followed.

The conjecture states that if a continuously differentiable map on an n-dimensional real vector space has a fixed point, and its Jacobian matrix is everywhere Hurwitz, then the fixed point is globally stable. The conjecture is true for the two-dimensional case. However, counterexamples have been constructed in higher dimensions. Hence, in the two- dimensional case only, it can also be referred to as the Markus–Yamabe theorem. Related mathematical results concerning global asymptotic stability, which are applicable in dimensions higher than two, include various autonomous convergence theorems. Analog of the conjecture for nonlinear control system with scalar nonlinearity is known as Kalman's conjecture.

He taught at the American University of Beirut (AUB) in Lebanon from 1980–84, where he met his wife and where his two sons John and Mark were born. From 1984–94 he was based in Swansea where he was a consultant for the oil industry. He did fieldwork in a number of African and Asian countries and wrote numerous synthesis volumes on the geology of different countries. In the late eighties, he began writing in his spare time. He had two novels, Heart of Stone and Rock of Refuge, published under the pseudonym of John Haworth. In 1994, he was asked to return to Lebanon to rebuild the Department of Geology at AUB and lived there with his family until 1998. During that time he carried out both teaching and researchWalley (1998) Some outstanding issues in the geology of the Lebanon and their importance in the tectoic evolution of the Levantine region, Tectonophysics, Vol 298, p37–62 duties was also involved in setting up a large environmental project in the Bekaa with A Rocha Lebanon. In 1998, he returned to the United Kingdom and began to make a new career in writing and editing, in particular for the Christian market. He retained his geological interests, however, and led field trips for Wheaton College, Illinois. In September 2004 he started teaching again, geology and geography, at Gorseinon College, now Gower College Swansea. He taught geology and environmental science there full-time while writing in his spare time. In summer 2014 Chris took the opportunity to take early retirement from teaching in order to take up the voluntary position of Mediterranean Conservation Science Coordinator with www.arocha.org. To do this more effectively, he and his wife moved to the south of France, where they are based between the two A Rocha France centres of Courmettes (Alpes-Maritimes) and Tourades (near Arles). He has a particularly strong link with the Domaine des Courmettes. Author As John Haworth, he wrote two thrillers, which were published in the United States by Crossway; and have also been translated into Swedish and German: Heart of Stone and Rock of Refuge. These are now available under his own name as Kindle ebooks. Under his own name, he wrote The Lamb Among the Stars series. The first two volumes, The Shadow at Evening and The Power of the Night, were republished by Tyndale in October 2006 as one hardback volume: The Shadow and Night. The next in the series, The Dark Foundations, was published at the same time. The last volume, The Infinite Day was first published by Tyndale in May 2008. Chris has also co-authored a number of non-fiction books, particularly The Life: A Portrait of Jesus (Authentic, 2003), with J. John.

In 374/3 BC, he succeeded his (presumed) father Evagoras I. Nicocles continued the philhellenic politics of his father. Nicocles died probably together with Straton of Sidon during the revolt of satraps (362 to 360 BC v. Chr.). He was followed as the Cypriot king of Salamis by his son Evagoras II. Some authors have proposed that Nicocles had participated in the conspiracy to which his father Evagoras fell a victim. But there is no authority for this supposition. Rather this idea seems to have arisen as a means of explaining the strange error made by Diodorus in considering Nicocles as the eunuch who assassinated Evagoras.Diod. xv. 47, intpp. ad loc. Little is known of the reign of Nicocles, but it appears to have been one of peace and prosperity. Based on statements of his panegyrist Isocrates (who addressed two of his orations to him and has made him the subject of another), under his rule his kingdom flourished, he replenished the treasury, which had been exhausted by his father's wars, without oppressing his subjects with exorbitant taxes, and behaved in all respects as the model of a mild and equitable ruler.Isocrates, Nicocles, p. 32 Isocrates also extols him also for his interest in literature and philosophy,Isocrates, Evagoras, p. 207 and provides proof of this by noting that Nicocles rewarding Isocrates for his panegyric with the magnificent present of twenty talents (Vit. X. Orat. p. 838, a.). The orator also praises him for the purity of his domestic relations; although Theopompus and Anaximenes of Lampsacus (ap. Athen. xii. p. 531) state that he was a person of luxurious habits who had vied with Straton, king of Sidon, in the splendour and refinement of his feasts and other sensual indulgences. Theopompus and Anaximenes of Lampsacus also state that Nicocles ultimately perished as the result of a violent death, but neither the date nor the circumstances surrounding this event are recorded.

Osborn's original plays are The Vinegar Tree, Oliver Oliver, and Morning's at Seven and among his several successful adaptations, On Borrowed Time has proved particularly popular. He wrote the screenplays for East of Eden (1955) and South Pacific (1958), among other films.  Career  Born in Evansville, Indiana, he grew up in Michigan where his father was a Baptist minister. He went on to graduate from the University of Michigan. At the university, he formed a lasting friendship with Poet-in-Residence Robert Frost and earned a B.A. in English and an M.A. in psychology. Following a brief stint as a student of George Pierce Baker, the noted teacher of dramatic form and founder of the Yale School of Drama at Yale University, he made his debut on Broadway in 1928 with the play Hotbed. His next play A Ledge was produced the following season. In 1930, Osborn found singular success on Broadway with a comedy titled The Vinegar Tree that starred Mary Boland. He contributed the comedy Oliver Oliver to the 1934 Broadway season, and in 1984 that play won critical acclaim at the Long Wharf Theater and the Philadelphia Drama Guild with Boyd Gaines in the title role. On the opening night in New Haven, the audience gave Oliver Oliver a standing ovation; and Osborn, who suffered macular degeneration, quipped, \\"I thought they were standing to get their coats.\\"Recollection of Kent Paul, Director of Tomorrow's Monday and The Vinegar Tree (Off Broadway) June 10, 2017 Although often noted for his adaptations, Osborn's 1939 comedy, Morning's at Seven, became one of Osborn's most enduring original works. It was revived on Broadway in 1980, directed by Vivian Matalon, featuring a cast including Teresa Wright, Maureen O'Sullivan, Nancy Marchand and Elizabeth Wilson. It was hailed by Harold Clurman \\"as one of the best American comedies\\" Harold Clurman Review The Nation May 3, 1980 page 541 Morning's at Seven has been presented several times on television, including a version directed by Matalon. In 2002, the Lincoln Center Theater mounted a well-received production with Elizabeth Franz, Frances Sternhagen, Piper Laurie and Estelle Parsons as the four sisters. The play received numerous nominations for awards, as did the acting ensemble, with Elizabeth Franz cited in particular Osborn's dramatization of On Borrowed Time has had three productions on Broadway, Joshua Logan directed the premiere in 1938 with Dudley Digges, Frank Conroy and Dorothy Stickney leading the cast. The 1953 revival featured Victor Moore, Leo G. Carroll and Beulah Bondi; and in 1991 George C. Scott directed himself, Nathan Lane and Teresa Wright in the play. The 1939 MGM movie of On Borrowed Time stars Lionel Barrymore, Cedric Hardwicke and Bobs Watson and Beulah Bondi. Osborn's rich contribution to the American theater includes the adaptations A Bell for Adano (1944); Point of No Return; The World of Susie Wong; The Innocent Voyage; and an original verse play, based on Greek myths, Maiden Voyage. Paul Osborn had a gift for friendship: Al Hirschfeld, Elia Kazan, Robert Frost. Frost, while becoming America's most noted poet, remained a close friend, intrigued by theater and travelling to New York for Osborn's first nights. Frost hoped to write a play in collaboration with his former student. Tomorrow's Monday, a somewhat autobiographical play, was written in 1935-36. It was first produced at the Brattleboro Theatre in Vermont, in the summer of 1936 and had its New York premiere fifty years later at the Circle Repertory Company in the fall of 1985. According to Kent Paul, who directed that production, Al Hirschfeld, the New York Times theater artist, remarked to his friend Osborn, \\"I like Tomorrow's Monday even more than Morning's at Seven.\\" Elia Kazan, in his autobiography A Life, credits Osborn with guiding him to the section of the novel East of Eden to film as well as discovering James Dean for the film. In his documentary A Letter to Elia, Martin Scorsese argues that the little known Wild River, which stars Montgomery Clift, Lee Remick and Jo Van Fleet, is among Kazan's finest achievements. Osborn's screenplay for Wild River is an outstanding literary achievement, providing scope for Kazan's directorial imagination. Rodgers & Hammerstein and the director Joshua Logan first asked Osborn to write the book for South Pacific when it was done for the stage (Logan himself finally did it), and achieved their objective when Osborn agreed to make the screenplay. Paul Osborn and his wife Millicent, a fiction writer, lived in New York City. Before their marriage in 1939 (Osborn's second), Millicent Green had had a successful career as an actress on Broadway, in the 1928 production of Machinal with Clark Gable and in Street Scene (1931), a performance that is captured in a Hirschfeld drawing included in his book with Brooks Atkinson, The Lively Years 1920 - 1973 (Morning's at Seven is one of the plays cited and discussed.) Problems with his eyesight left Osborn virtually blind his latter years when he dictated a lengthy memoir that he never finished \\"because I can't read it\\". The memoir remains unpublished. Among his screenplays would be the adaptation of John Steinbeck's East of Eden (1955) and Wild River (1960) for his friend Elia Kazan, South Pacific (1958) and Sayonara directed by Joshua Logan, as well as Madame Curie (1943), The Yearling (1946), and Portrait of Jennie (1948). He had received Academy Award nominations for the screenplays for Sayonara and East of Eden, and Writers Guild of America nominations for South Pacific, Sayonara and East of Eden. Osborn received a Tony Award for Best Broadway Revival in 1980 for Morning's at Seven. In 1982, two years after the Tony for Morning's at Seven, Osborn won the Laurel Award for Screenwriting Achievement from the Writers Guild of America.

It is especially popular in the eastern Indian states of Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal, the South Indian state of Kerala, and the Northeast Indian states, especially Assam. Pithas are typically made of rice flour, although there are some types of pitha made of wheat flour. Less common types of pitha are made of palm or ol (a local root vegetable). Preparation Pithas are primarily made from a batter of rice flour or wheat flour, which is shaped and optionally filled with sweet or savory ingredients. When filled, the pitha's pouch is called a khol (literally \\"container\\") and the fillings are called pur. For stuffed vegetable pithas, ingredients such as cauliflower, cabbage, radish, or potato are usually fried, baked, or steamed, and then mashed, cooled, and formed into small balls to stuff into the pithas. Sweet pithas typically contain sugar, jaggery, date juice, or palm syrup, and can be filled with grated coconut, fried or roasted sesame seeds, cashews, pistachios, sweetened vegetables, or fruits. Sweet pithas are also often flavored using cardamom or camphor. Depending on the type of pitha being prepared, pithas can be fried in oil or ghee, slow-roasted over a fire, steamed, or baked and rolled over a hot plate. Pithas are often eaten during breakfast, as a snack with (often with tea), and in dinner or lunch. Although there are many sweet varieties that are reserved for desserts or holidays. Regional variation Pithas vary considerably across the regions of the eastern Indian subcontinent. =In Assam= In Assam, pitha is a special class of rice preparation generally made only on special occasions like Bihu. Assamese pithas are often made from bora saul, a special kind of glutinous rice, or xaali saul, or sun-dried rice. Some pithas commonly found in Assam include the following: *কাঁচি পিঠা Kachi pitha (lit. \\"Sickle pitha\\"): a pan baked pancake made from bora saul and filled with sesame seeds, ground coconut, dried orange rind, and jaggery. The sickle is known as \\" Kachi\\" in Assamese and hence the name. * ঘিলা পিঠা Ghila pitha (lit. \\"knee pitha\\"): a fried pitha made from bora saul and jaggery. Salt can also be used instead of jaggery for a savory variant. * চুঙা পিঠা Sunga pitha: a special pitha made with both xaali saul and bora saul, which are mixed with water and jaggery and churned thoroughly before being placed in a young bamboo tube corked with banana leaf and roasted in fire. The resulting tube-shaped cake is then cut into pieces and served with hot milk. * টেকেলি পিঠা Tekeli pitha (lit. \\"earthenware pitha\\"): a special pitha made with both xaali saul and bora saul, mixed with coconut, sugar, and powdered milk. Ground cardamom and dried orange rind can also be added. The pitha is steamed in an earthenware pot or a kettle set on a hearth. *উহোৱা পিঠা Uhuwa pitha: Rice flour of Xaali Saul and Bora Saul is mixed with jaggery or salt and water and churned thoroughly. The paste is rolled into small balls and flattened and then boiled in water. It is served with tea and also can be eaten with milk. *কেটলি পিঠা Ketli pitha: The method of preparation, as well as the substance, is as same as tekeli pitha, but a kettle is used here instead of the earthenware. That’s the reason it is called Ketli pitha (Ketli in Assamese means kettle). Here the kettle-cork is kept upside down on the kettle and the substance is put on it. It usually takes less time to be baked than tekeli pitha takes. *তিল পিঠা Til pitha: This is made with sesame and rice. The rice flour is spread in a circle on a pan, basically made of cast iron and heated. The roasted sesame seeds are placed in the circle along with sugar or jaggery and rolled. These are cylindrical shaped, more like a cigar. *তেল পিঠা Tel pitha: The pitha is fried in oil. *নাৰিকল দিয়া পিঠা Narikol diya pitha *সুতুলি পিঠা Xutuli pitha *ধূপ পিঠা Dhup pitha, also known as Bhapa pitha *ভাপতদিয়া পিঠা Bhapotdiya pitha *লখিমী পিঠা Lakhimi pitha *তৰা পিঠা Tora pitha *মুঠিয়া পিঠা Muthiya pitha *খোলাচাপৰি পিঠা Kholasapori pitha *লস্কৰা Laskara *আঙ্গুলি পিঠা Anguli Pitha: In Assamese language, ‘anguli’ means finger while ‘pitha’ is a type of rice cake. ‘Anguli Pitha’ has got its name from the fact that the pithas are shaped like fingers.https://www.farmtorasoi.com/anguli-pitha/ =In Odisha = Manda Pitha In Odisha, Pithas () are special delicacies in an Odia home. On traditional festivals, sweet pithas form a part of the celebrations.Pithas are also routinely prepared and served in Odia homes in normal days. The pitha may be broadly put in the category cakes. Some Odia pithas include the following: *Arisa Pitha (): deep-fried pitha made from rice flour with jaggery or sugar. *Manda Pitha (): steamed pitha made from rice flour, often with grated coconut and jaggery/sugar filling or fresh cheese (chhena) filling. *Kakara pitha (): very popular fried pancake made from wheat flour/semolina, often with a sweet coconut filling. *Enduri Pitha (): pitha made from rice flour and black gram, often with a jaggery and coconut or cheese filling, steamed in a turmeric leaf. Enduri pitha is a special delicacy of the Prathamastami festival. *Chakuli Pitha (): thin/thick pancake (set dosa) made from fermented rice and black gram, often eaten for breakfast. Thinner varieties are called saru chakuli, and resemble plain dosas.

Its crust is slightly burnt, while the inside is soft and white, mostly during Raja Parba. *Ruka Pitha (): After the leftover of arisa paste, water is added to it to make it thin and pour it into oil which is known as \\"Rukeiba\\" not \\"Andaleiba\\" and hence Ruka pithaa is made. It is softer than arisa at the middle of it and very crispy at the corner. *Chitau piṭha (): fried pancake made from rice flour, coconut, and milk, often offered in pujas to Lord Jagannath on Chitalagi Amabasya (or Chitau Amabasya). *Gaintha godi (): Small balls made of rice flour dipped in seasoned sweet milk. *Karanji (): A dumpling made of maida and stuffed with coconut, cashew raisins and fried in ghee. *Malpua (): Sweetened deep-fried batter of a mixture of bananas and flour *Suji Kakara Pitha (): A sweet dish made of suji with coconut stuffing *Tala Pitha (): A sweet dish made of palm fruit and rice batter *Chunchipatra Pitha (): A pitha made by sprinkling the batter onto a kadai/pan and putting a stuffing made of grated coconut, jaggery/sugar, elaichi. =In Bihar= Pitha (Devanagari: पिट्ठा) is also the part of Bihari cuisine particularly in Mithila region of Bihar. Mainly the rice flour pitha is popular in Bihar and two varieties of stuffed (sweet or salty stuffing) or unstuffed pitha are consumed. =In Bangladesh, West Bengal, Tripura= Puli Pitha Taal Pitha Bhapa pitha While some pitha can be made at any time of the year in Bengal (Bangladesh and Indian states of West Bengal, Tripura and Assam’s Barak Valley), there are special pitha strongly associated with harvest festivals such as Nabanna ( nôbanno, literally \\"new rice\\" or \\"new food\\") and the Poush parbon or Makar Sankranti, celebrated on January 14 every year.

Watered-rice also known as pakhala along with sabzi (bhaja in Odia) and a pair of chilled mango slices. The vegetables in 'bhaja' may vary. Here, there are potatoes and pointed gourds seasoned with spices. This lunch is often preferred to beat the summer heat in Eastern India. Odisha pakhala Dahi pakhala (curd pakhala) Pakhaḷa with curd, lemon and sautéed in cumin Pakhaḷa () is an Odia term for an Indian food consisting of cooked rice washed or a little fermented in water. The liquid part is known as toraṇi. It is popular in Odisha, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Assam, Chhattisgarh, and Tamil Nadu. In Tamil Nadu it is called Pazhaiya Sadam. The Bengali name for this dish is panta bhat, in Chhattisgarh it's called bore bhat,http://www.rkmp.co.in/general-domain/rice-in-human- nutrition/pakhal in Jharkhand linguistic communities use names like paani bhat, paakhaal or pakhala, and in Assam it's called poita bhat.http://www.telegraphindia.com/1110804/jsp/northeast/story_14328967.jsp It is a preparation that is had during summer, although many families and communities eat it throughout the year, especially for lunch. People who toil in the sun such as farm hands have it as it replenishes the salt and water lost by the body. A traditional Odia dish, it is prepared with rice, curd, cucumber, cumin seeds, fried onions and mint leaves. It is popularly served with dry roasted vegetables—such as potato, brinjal, badi and saga bhaja or fried fish. Etymology The term \\"pakhala\\" is derived from Pali word \\"pakhaleiba\\" () as well as Sanskrit word \\"Prakshāḷaṇa\\" (Sanskrit: प्रक्षाळन) which means \\"washed/to wash.\\" The word pakhaḷa was used in the Odia poems of Arjuna Das in his literary work Kaḷpalata (1520-1530 AD). March 20 is celebrated as Pakhala Dibasa. History It is unknown when pakhaḷa was first included in the daily diet of Eastern India, but it was included in the recipe of Lord Jagannath Temple of Puri circa 10. Pakhaḷa is eaten in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent (including Nepal and some parts of Myanmar). To beat the heat, this dish is cooked and cooled in a bowl with full of plain water. Odisha, West Bengal, Assam, and Chhattisgarh also have this dish in their cuisine. To promote this food, 20 March is celebrated as Pakhala Dibas or day. Classifications *Jeera Pakhaḷa is made by adding fried cumin with curry leaves to pakhaḷa.Jeera PakhalaJeera Pakhala *Dahi Pakhaḷa is made by adding curd with pakhaḷa.Dahi Pakhala Badi chura is taken as a side dish with pakhala. *Garama pakhaḷa (hot pakhaḷa) is generally made by adding water instantly after making rice or with warm rice. *Basi pakhaḷa (basi in Oriya means \\"stale\\") is made by fermenting rice by adding water which is generally kept overnight and eaten in the next day. It is also known by the names basi amana or basyam (literally meaning stale cooked rice). Preparation The dish is typically prepared with rice that is cooked and allowed to cool. Cook normal rice, then cool it. Pour water in a bowl and add rice to it. In a pan, heat a pinch of oil, add mustard seeds, curry leaves, dry red chili and fry well. Add this chhunka or tadka into the pakhala bowl with sour curd. One can add mint leaves and raw salt to enhance the taste. To add more zing, one may opt for fish fry or sukhua poda (dry fish fried), saga bhaja, badi chura (a regional food item made up of batter of urad or black gram by drying under sunshine as small nuts and then fried to serve) and much more. Cumin seeds are fried, ground into a fine powder and added to curd with coriander leaves and salt. It is sometimes served with a fish fry and spinach. =Traditional preparation= Pakhaḷa is slightly fermented rice. The rice is cooked, water is added with little bit of old pakhal (something similar to making curd using milk and old curd). Pakhaḷa tastes best when served after 8 to 12 hours after preparation; in this case, no old pakhal is required to be added to the rice as fermentation usually happens after 6 hours of keeping rice in water. The Pakhala by itself tastes a bit sour, but also paste of green chilli, Green Mango and Ginger is added to give the Pakhala a little bit hot and sweet flavour. Generally burnt potato or aloo poda (boiled is also used) and other fried vegetables or fried fish is served with pakhaḷa. Modern-day variation is to add curd instead of fermenting it. Pakhala Dibasa (Universal Pakhala Day) 20 March is declared Pakhala Dibasa (Universal Pakhala Day) by Odias worldwide. People eat Pakhala and promote the dish.

The show follows the exploits of MI5's counter-terrorism group, Section D. The character is played by British actor Raza Jaffrey. Zafar (usually called Zaf) is introduced in the last episode of series 3, and he appears throughout series 4 and 5. The character is last seen in the first episode of series 6. Description The BBC's Spooks website depicts Zaf as a loyal team member, devoted to his job and the protection of the UK. He has a quick wit, sometimes bordering on facetiousness. He enjoys being in the field rather than behind a desk and he excels in undercover work, but he can be \\"foolhardy, and his risk assessment [is] sometimes weak.\\" He gets along well with section chief Adam Carter, whom he \\"hero worship[s].\\"\\"Personnel File: Zafar Younis\\", BBC Spooks website. Retrieved 22 March 2011. To quote Raza Jaffrey, \\"Zaf is very good at his job. . . . He's hugely ambitious, but knows how much of a sacrifice a career with the intelligence service is. . . . He trusts Adam implicitly and the two have a great rapport. He doesn't always agree with [Adam] but he would lay down his life for him, just as he would for any of the team.\\"\\"Raza Jaffrey is Zafar Younis.\\" BBC Press Office, Spooks Press Pack. 1 September 2005. Retrieved 22 March 2011. The BBC Press Pack for series 4 attributes to Zaf a Muslim background but notes that he is not particularly devout. He is, however, said to be sensitive to indications \\"that either he or his culture is being patronised or misrepresented,\\" and he despises those who use their religion as an excuse for special pleading or facile rhetoric.\\"Raza Jaffrey is Zafar Younis.\\" BBC Press Office, Spooks Press Pack. 1 September 2005. Retrieved 22 March 2011. Episodes In the episode in which Zaf is introduced, \\"The Suffering of Strangers,\\" MI5 officers Fiona Carter and Danny Hunter are being held hostage by terrorists. Zaf is an MI6 officer who had worked with Adam Carter (played by Rupert Penry-Jones) before Adam transferred to MI5. Zaf assists in saving Fiona's life, but Danny is killed by the terrorists. With Danny's death, Adam asks Zaf to join Section D. Midway through series 4, the show gains another new character, the recruit Jo Portman, played by Miranda Raison. There is promise of a growing relationship between Jo and Zaf, but this is never fully developed. At the start of series 6, Zaf is kidnapped by a band of mercenaries, and his colleagues are left uncertain of his ultimate fate. His last onscreen words are telling Adam \\"Go\\". It is not until episode 10 that they learn that he was tortured for a paying client, then sold to terrorists in Pakistan, subjected to further torture, and killed. Raza Jaffrey After leaving the series, Raza Jaffrey became a member of the cast of the BBC drama Mistresses, playing Hari Dhillon, husband of one of the four female leads.

He was born at Market Drayton, Shropshire, but lived most of his life in Lancashire and was primarily associated with Blackburn Rovers F.C. He was a leading referee from the earliest days of organised football, and when well into his 60s officiated in the Gold medal match of the 1920 Olympic Games football tournament in Antwerp. On 21 April 2008 it was announced that his grave at Blackburn Municipal Cemetery had been restored to its former glory, the costs having been met by Blackburn Rovers. Administrative work Lewis was educated at Shrewsbury School where he began to play football. He was a strict teetotaller worked alongside Old Salopian Arthur Constantine in bringing about the formation of Blackburn Rovers F.C. in 1875, and actually played in the first side fielded by the club. He also contributed to the foundation of the Lancashire FA in 1878, and later became a vice-president of the Football Association and the Football League. Refereeing career Lewis had established himself as a notable referee within the domestic game in England and earned the nickname 'Prince of Referees'. He was three times appointed the referee in the FA Cup Final (1895, 1897 and 1898). He refereed the 1898 FA Cup Semi-finals between Southampton and Nottingham Forest; the first match ended in a 1–1 draw. The replay at Crystal Palace was played in a blizzard. After a scoreless first half (in which Joe Turner missed a penalty for Southampton), in the second half the Saints were on top when, with ten minutes left to play, referee Lewis stopped the match for a time and the players left the pitch. No sooner had the game restarted than the weather worsened but Lewis decided that the match should continue. Southampton's goalkeeper George Clawley had his eyes \\"choked with snow\\" and conceded two goals in the final minutes of the game. Despite Southampton's protests the F.A. decided that the result should stand - this was perhaps not surprising as Lewis was by then an eminent member of the F.A. board. He was given charge of the 1908 Olympic final at White City, London between Great Britain and Denmark which passed by without incident. 1920 Olympic Final Lewis had already refereed the semi-final between the host nation Belgium and the Netherlands on Thursday 31 August before being appointed for the final on Saturday 2 September 1920. That Lewis was appointed match referee may be seen to be surprising in hindsight, given his age (then 65), but the Belgian national newspaper L'Action Nationale wrote an editorial on 4 September 1920 which read: \\"Mr. Lewis refereed the game magnificently on Thursday and yet Czechoslovakia are now disqualified\\". As it transpired, the final was played in a poor spirit: with Belgium leading 2–0 in the 40th minute courtesy of a Robert Coppee penalty in the 6th minute and a Henri Larnoe goal in the 30th minute that was disputed but allowed to stand, Karel Pešek, the Czechoslovakia and Sparta Prague captain, pulled his team from the field in protest after Lewis had ejected Czech left-back Karel Steiner for assaulting Coppee. 15 minutes later, after Lewis had awarded the match and the gold medal to Belgium, the home crowd, led by Belgian soldiers, invaded the field. The Czech delegation made the following statement in regard to their protest: \\"2. The majority of the decisions of the referee Mr. Lewis were distorted and it was obvious that it gave the public the wrong impression in regard to our game. Also both Belgian goals were the result of incorrect decisions of the referee and we seek a rigorous investigation on that point.\\" They had also complained about the inclusion and performance of an English linesman, Charles Wreford-Brown, and the provocative influence of the troops lining the field. The Czech protest was dismissed, and their team was disqualified. As a consequence, the tournament for the bronze medal was changed to one for the silver and bronze medals.

It was built by the Belz Hasidic community with financial help from its supporters and admirers around the world. Planning In the 1980s, Rabbi Yissachar Dov Rokeach, the fifth Belzer Rebbe, spearheaded plans for the huge synagogue to be erected in the Kiryat Belz neighborhood of Jerusalem. The building, designed with four entrances accessible to each of the four streets of the hilltop neighborhood, would be an enlarged replica of the structure that the first Belzer Rebbe, the Sar Shalom, built in the town of Belz in 1843. It would include a grandiose main sanctuary, smaller study halls, wedding and bar mitzvah halls, libraries, and other communal facilities. Construction Funds for the ambitious, multimillion-dollar project were raised among Belzer Hasidim and were supplemented by various fundraising projects throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The original synagogue in Belz, dedicated in 1843. Like the original synagogue, which took 15 years to complete, the new Belz synagogue that now dominates the northern Jerusalem skyline also took 15 years to construct. It was dedicated in 2000. Its main sanctuary seats 7,000 worshippers. The ornate wooden ark, an item for the Guinness World Records, is 12 meters high and weighs 18 tons. It has the capacity to hold 70 Torah scrolls. Nine chandeliers, each standing at high and wide, each contain over 200,000 pieces of Czech crystal. In stark contrast to the majestic synagogue, the simple wooden chair and shtender used by Rabbi Aharon Rokeach when he came to Palestine in 1944 stand in a glass case next to the ark. Building layout The large interior of the synagogue can accommodate 7,000 worshippers. People learning in the beis medrash. The main sanctuary is used only on Shabbat and Jewish holidays, while weekday services take place in the underlying smaller rooms of the complex. Under the main sanctuary are multiple floors. The floor directly under the main sanctuary hosts a large number of small synagogue rooms known as shtieblach, where services for Shacharit, Mincha and Maariv are held up to every 10 minutes. In an adjacent wing is also a large hall used for tishen. Below the shtieblach are multiple floors with dormitory-style sleeping quarters for Belzer Hasidim from outside of Israel, who come to be with the Rebbe for Jewish holidays such as Rosh HaShana, Yom Kippur and Sukkot. There are also large rooms for other functions, such as Seudah shlishit on Shabbat afternoons, weddings and bar mitzvah celebrations. A separate two-story house for the Belzer Rebbe stands adjacent to the synagogue. Here the Rebbe maintains his office and receives guests, as well as resides with his family. The second-floor balcony of the house faces the large, outdoor courtyard of the synagogue, where Hasidim gather for outdoor addresses by the Rebbe and for large celebrations under a giant tent, such as the bar mitzvah banquets for the Rebbe's grandsons in 2008Eichler, Rabbi Yisrael.

The forces met outside Jarnac between the right bank of the Charente River and the high road between Angoulême and Cognac. Marshal Gaspard de Tavannes, superior in cavalry, crossed the Charente by the bridge at Châteauneuf and was successful in defeating the Huguenots due to his execution of surprise attacks, coming unexpectedly from the south.A brief summary of the tactics at Jarnac may be found in Arthur Whiston Whitehead, Gaspard de Coligny, Admiral of france (1904) pp 202-08. The Huguenots made a last stand at Triac and were ultimately defeated, with both their leaders captured in the fray and murdered in the aftermath. Under the leadership of Gaspard de Coligny, however, a significant portion of the Huguenot army managed to escape. Minor participants on the Huguenot side were the English volunteer Walter Raleigh and Louis of Nassau. Aftermath On 25 June, the two armies met again at the Battle of La Roche-l'Abeille, resulting in a Protestant victory. The Battle of Moncontour in October of the same year would provide the Catholics with a more definitive victory.

In 2006 Barrie McDermott was included in the Southstander.com Hall of Fame. Background McDermott was born in Oldham, Lancashire, England. Playing career =1990s= A native of Oldham, McDermott started out with his hometown club Oldham before transferring to Wigan where he won a championship and was first picked to play for Great Britain. He had originally wished to join the army but was unable to do so after an accident with an air rifle that caused him to lose an eye. His early career wasn't short of controversy and he has been described as notorious, mostly due to his aggressive style of play. During the 1994 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France McDermott played in all three Ashes Tests against Australia, Great Britain losing the series. Barrie McDermott played as a substitute in Wigan's 1994–95 Regal Trophy victory, a 40-10 win over Warrington, and in the 1995–96 Final, a 25-16 victory over St. Helens. McDermott joined Leeds in 1996. He missed the Rhinos' 1998 Super League Grand Final defeat bt Wigan. He played in Leeds' first Challenge Cup Final win for 21 years against the London Broncos in 1999. He scored a try at a crucial time in Leeds' 52–16 win, which was a record scoreline. In this game Leroy Rivett set a Challenge Cup record by scoring 4 tries. McDermott was a Great Britain international, winning 17 caps. He also earned a single cap for England. =2000s= McDermott went on to represent Ireland at the 2000 Rugby League World Cup, and went on to earn 15 caps over the years.

At the start of Barrie's last season with Leeds, he won the 2005 World Club Challenge. The Rhinos won the World Club Challenge against the then National Rugby League champions the Canterbury Bulldogs. They won the trophy in front of a record crowd for a World Club Challenge held in Britain. There was a 37,028 strong crowd at Elland Road. The Rhinos looked like they were going to go onto more success in 2005 as they reached the Challenge Cup Final for the 4th time in 6 years. They were leading 24–19 with a couple of minutes to go when disaster struck as they conceded a Paul Cooke try which Danny Brough converted to give the men from the east coast the trophy, winning by a point 25–24, The Rhinos' season went from bad to worse as they slipped up in the league allowing St. Helens to finish top of the table. The Rhinos finished 2nd and so played Saint Helens at Knowsley Road for the right to go to old trafford and play in the Grand Final. The Rhinos won and so reached their second consecutive Grand Final. They had to wait and see who they would play in the Grand Final. Saints played Bradford in the Grand Final Eliminator to see who would play the Rhinos at Old Trafford. The Bulls won so it was a repeat of the 2004 Grand Final – however it wasn't to be a fairytale for the Rhinos and Barrie as the Bulls won the match 15–6. Barrie played in 2 Grand Finals, 3 Challenge Cup Finals and a World Club Challenge. He won 1 Grand Final winners ring, a Challenge Cup winners medal and a World Club Challenge winners medal.

Content The treaty severely curtailed many of the rights granted to the French Protestants in the previous Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. Based on the terms of the treaty, all Huguenots were granted amnesty for their past actions and the freedom of belief. However, they were permitted the freedom to worship only within the three towns of La Rochelle, Montauban, and Nîmes, and there only privately within their own residences; Protestant nobles with the right of high-justice were permitted to celebrate marriages and baptisms, but only before an assembly limited to ten persons outside of their family.Jouanna, p.213.

Although it is geographically part of the Loyalty Islands, administratively it belongs to L'Île-des-Pins municipality of New Caledonia.  History  There is evidence that the island had prehistoric inhabitants. Graves, shell and bone tools, as well as stone markers indicate the presence of a permanent population at some point. The island is the topic of several oral traditions from Maré and the Isle des Pines, the two closest inhabited islands. Speculation amongst the overseers of the Guano mining operation suggested that shipwreck or other castaways had also occupied the island.Walpole, A “Mystery Island” in Southeast New Caledonia? by Christophe Sand, 2004 British captain Butler is credited for discovery of the island in 1794 and he named it after his ship Walpole. From 1910 through 1936 guano was mined on the island and about 150,000 tonnes were exported to New Zealand. The island is only visited by scientific naturalist research missions.

The language is based on F-logic and the theory of stratified logic programs. The engine is an Eclipse plug-in for the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF).  History  Tefkat was one of the sub-projects of the Pegamento project at the Distributed Systems Technology Centre (DSTC), Australia. Although the project was already underway, the most active research occurred for the submission of a response to the OMG's MOF 2.0 Queries / Views / Transformations Request for Proposals. Tefkat was open-sourced before the closure of the DSTC in June 2006.  Brief Description  Tefkat defines a mapping from a set of source metamodels to a set of target metamodels. A Tefkat transformation consists of rules, patterns and templates. Rules contain a source term and a target term. Patterns are simply named composite source terms, and templates are simply named composite target terms. These elements are based on F-logic and pure logic programming, however the absence of function symbols means a significant reduction in complexity. Tefkat has two more significant language elements: trackings and injections. Trackings allow arbitrary relationships to be preserved in a trace model. Injections allow the identity of target objects to be specified in terms of a function symbol. Thus injections are similar (but more powerful) to QVT's keys, which specify a target object's identity to be a function of its type and some of its properties. The declarative semantics of a Tefkat transformation is the perfect model of traces and targets that satisfies all the rules. A more imperative semantics of a Tefkat transformation is the iterated least fixed-point of the immediate consequence of each rule. Due to stratification, these semantics are equivalent and unambiguous. Tefkat does not use explicit rule-calling; all (non-abstract) rules fire independently from all others, however rules can be loosely coupled using trackings, injections, rule extension and/or rule superseding.  Concrete Syntax  Tefkat has an SQL-like concrete syntax designed to concisely convey the intent of each rule, pattern or template. RULE ClassToTable FORALL Class c { name: n; } MAKE Table t { name: n; } ;  Compliance  The Tefkat language is defined in terms of (E)MOF 2.0, however the engine is implemented in terms of Ecore, the EMOF-like metametamodel at the centre of EMF. The language is very similar to the Relations package of QVT, however it is not strictly compliant.

It was historically known as Connecticut General Hospital for the Insane. It is a historic district that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. The historic district includes late 19th and 20th century revival and late Victorian architecture. When listed on the National Register, the district included 27 contributing buildings. Also included were 25 non- contributing buildings. and  History  The Connecticut Hospital for the Insane was formally opened in Middletown in 1868. Two years earlier, Middletown had granted the site to the State for the establishment of an asylum to accommodate Connecticut's mentally ill. By 1896, four groups of buildings had been erected and the institution was one of the largest of its kind in the country. The site is still used as a psychiatric care facility, operated by the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services. The State has indicated that it wishes to demolish up to 24 buildings on the campus. Facilities Located in the South Farms district, Connecticut Valley Hospital consists of a large concentration of early and contemporary buildings. The site, landscaped with broad lawns and large shade trees, is at the top of a hill and offers panoramic views of the city. Silver Street and Bow Lane pass thorough the property which is bordered by Eastern Drive, to the west. Small drives, leading from these streets, traverse the property's grounds. The hospital consists of approximately eighty structures complemented by south and east of the main site. It includes large institutional buildings constructed of brick and brownstone, frame and brick residences, and a number of maintenance buildings. The majority of these form a large group centered on Shew Hall. This site contains approximately 200 acres. It comprises many distinctive structures that evidence different periods of the institution's development. Shew Hall, the original hospital structure, was built in 1867. It functions as the administrative building and is the focal point of the institution. This large structure is named in honor of the hospital's first superintendent, Dr. Abram M. Shew. Designed by Addison Hutton of Philadelphia, it was constructed in the Second Empire style. The building was remodeled in 1939, when the interior was updated and a flat roof bordered by a parapet was installed on the main section. The three large wings display mansard roofs and details that are indicative of the main section's former appearance. Stanley Hall, built around 1879, was also designed in the Second Empire style. It was the hospital's maximum security facility in prior years. Stanley Hall was dismantled and removed some time after 1999. Woodward Hall, erected around 1886, is in the Queen Anne style. It has an irregular profile that is accentuated by many ells. The structure exhibits multiple roofs capped by numerous chimneys, wide turrets, and large, gabled dormers. The interior has been recently remodeled. The Queen Anne style section of Woodward Hall was torn down in 2007, and there are tentative plans to develop a garden where it once stood. The \\"newer\\" section of Woodward Hall (built in the early 20th century at the same time Weeks Hall was built) still stands and houses the geriatric wards. Weeks Hall, built in 1896, was also constructed in the Queen Anne and, in addition, had features that suggested the influence of the Jacobethan Revival. Its appearance, similar to that of Woodward Hall, was highlighted by prominent, steeply pitched gables and floral designs in terra cotta. The interior sections and roofs of the western side of Weeks Hall collapsed in the 21st century, but the exterior walls remained standing until the structure burned on September 21, 2010. Smith Home, constructed about 1909, is designed in the Colonial Revival style. It has a cross-gabled roof crowned by a slender, distinctive tower. The main entrance displays fluted pilasters and a large fan in relief above the door. Currently unoccupied, the structure once housed hospital employees. Other notable early buildings are located on the grounds. The police station, a distinctive cottage, was erected in 1895. Shepherd Home and Russell Hall are two similar structures that were built in the 1920s; they exhibit large, ornate porticoes which are classical in design. There are also a number of small residences, constructed during the late nineteenth century, that have served as living quarters for the staff. Smith Home and Shepard Home once provided housing for nursing staff. Russell Hall once was used as the on-campus medical hospital. This site reflects the history associated with the care and treatment of the mentally ill in Connecticut. The buildings, reminiscent of different eras of the hospital's past, document its progressive growth and comprise a diverse collection that contributes to the architectural variety of Middletown.

About 130 species in 10 genera have been described worldwide. They are rarely collected. Family description For terms see Morphology of Diptera. Adult asteiids are minute to small (1–3 millimeters) thin-bodied and delicate (often weakly sclerotized) flies, with yellow-black or dark colours. The wings are relatively long and transparent. The head is rounded, the male almost always with distinct interfrontal stripes. The arista may be bare or pubescent but usually has a zigzag of longer and shorter alternating rays. The postvertical bristles are weakly developed, divergent or parallel or totally absent. Ocellar bristles may be present or absent. There is one orbital bristle on each side of the frons (Shtakel'berg] (0–2 pairs of frontal bristles). Interfrontal bristles may be present as may scattered interfrontal setulae. Vibrissae may be absent or present. On the mesonotum are one to two pairs of dorsocentral bristles. The costa is entire, without interruptions; the subcosta is reduced; posterior basal wing cell and discoidal wing cell are fused; anal cell of wing and anal vein of wing are absent. Tibiae lack a dorsal preapical bristle. See Biology Adults are often found on flowers and low vegetation but have been collected at windows indoors and on tree wounds. In one genus (Leiomyza) adults are found on mushrooms and bracket fungi. Adults of the species Astiosoma rufifrons Duda are attracted to wood ash after bonfires especially at evening. Larval biologies are unknown, but adults have been reared from fungi (Leiomyza), stalks of Cannabis sativa, flower buds, and dried reed stems. Sabrosky (1987) suggested that the larvae may be scavengers in the frass of other insects. Species Lists * Palaearctic *Nearctic * Japan One species Identification (Literature) Sabrosky, C.W., 1943.

The size of the unit varied; originally a Fähnlein could consist of as many as 1,000 soldiers, but numbers were generally less, around 500. It was sub-divided into sections or Rotten (singular: Rotte) of between 6 and 12 men.  Origin and usage  The Fähnlein, meaning \\"small banner\\", consisted of small number of soldiers that were organized under a single banner, hence the unit's name. Rotte comes from the Middle Latin word rupta which means \\"dispersed troop\\". The word \\"company\\", which was used throughout Europe, superseded Fähnlein in the 17th century, even in German- speaking regions. It was later used by the scouts and Wandervögel as well as by the Deutsches Jungvolk during the Nazi era. Rotte was later also used in the organisational structure of the SS and has survived into the Bundeswehr.  History  By the Middle Ages, the Fähnlein was already the administrative unit with military forces, especially in the infantry. It initially had 400 to 600 men, sometimes up to 1,000. In France it usually consisted of 300 men. Georg von Frundsberg had 380 Landsknechte. However, these numbers were target strengths, which were almost never attained. Thus, the actual strength of the French Fähnlein for a long time was no more than 100 to 200 men. The regiments of different armies had very different numbers of Fähnlein: * 18 Fähnlein at Frundsberg * 12 Fähnlein in a French Legion * 10 Fähnlein in the Imperial Troops during the Schmalkaldic War The Fähnlein consisted of a mix of archers, pikemen and halberdiers. In the 17th century, some Fähnleins or fänikor would have a strength of only 100 to 200 men, and it was at this time that the designation \\"company\\" came into widespread use. = Germany = In Germany, a Fähnlein was the subordinate formation within a Landsknecht regiment. Each Fähnlein consisted of several Rotten (singular: Rotte). As a formed unit, a Fähnlein consisted of around 400 Landsknechte, commanded by a captain (Feldhauptmann, Hauptmann or Kapitän). A Rotte consisted of eight to twelve Landsknechte or six Doppelsöldner and was led by a Rottmeister. It equates roughly to the modern section or fireteam. At the beginning of the 17th century, i.e. before the Thirty Years' War a Fähnlein in Germany was supposed to have the following strength: * 100 pikemen * 160 musketeers * 20 halbardiers * 20 swordsmen (Rundtartschiere) Under Charles V the staff of a German Fähnlein was as follows: * 1 captain (Hauptmann) * 1 lieutenant (Leutnant, Lieutenant, Locotenens or Leutinger) * 1 ensign (Fähnrich) * 1 sergeant (Feldwebel) * 1 chaplain (Kaplan) * 1 quartermaster sergeant (Fourier) * 1 guide (Führer) * 2 Gemeinwebel * 1 or 2 drummers (Trommler) or fifers (Pfeifer) * 2 so-called trabants to guard the captain * 1 translator (Dolmetscher) * 2 runners (Jungen) for the captain and the ensign * 1 cook (Koch) * 1 mounted rider (Knecht) for the captain This structure was also called the prima plana (Latin for \\"first sheet\\") because these appointments were on the first page of the muster lists. = Sweden = Roughly the same organization was used in Sweden, where each province raised a number of fänikor, which were organized into a provincial regiment. Many of the regiments of the Swedish Army of today trace their origins back to the fänikor of the 16th century. The fänika was led by a Kapten, the equivalent of a Captain. The corresponding cavalry unit was called ryttarfana (rider banner).  Ensigns  The military rank of Fähnrich (Germany) or Fänrik (Sweden) was held by the ensigns or low ranking officer who carried the banner (German Fahne, Swedish Fana) of the Fähnlein or fänika. The Spanish army has a similar formation called a Bandera (flag, banner).

SQL Anywhere was known as Sybase SQL Anywhere prior to the acquisition of Sybase by SAP.  Features  SQL Anywhere can be run on Windows, Windows CE, Mac OS X, and various UNIX platforms, including Linux, AIX, HP-UX and Solaris. Database files are independent of the operating system, allowing them to be copied between supported platforms. The product provides several standard interfaces (ODBC, JDBC, and ADO.NET) and a number of special interfaces such as PHP and Perl. The engine supports stored procedures, user functions (using Watcom SQL, T-SQL, Java, or C/C++), triggers, referential integrity, row-level locking, replication, high availability, proxy tables, and events (scheduled and system events). Strong encryption is supported for both database files and client-server communication.  Uses  SQL Anywhere is used in several contexts, including as an embedded database, particularly as an application data store. For example, it is used in Intuit QuickBooks, in network management products, and in backup products. Its ability to be used with minimal administration is a distinguishing feature in this role. It can be used as a database server for work groups or for small or medium-sized businesses. It can also function as a mobile database. It includes scalable data synchronization technology that provides change-based replication between separate databases, including large server-based RDBMS systems.  Technologies  SQL Anywhere Server is a high performing and embeddable relational database-management system (RDBMS) that scales from thousands of users in server environments down to desktop and mobile applications used in widely deployed, zero-administration environments. Ultralite: UltraLite is a database-management system designed for small- footprint mobile devices such as PDAs and smart phones. Mobilink: MobiLink is a highly-scalable, session-based synchronization technology for exchanging data among relational databases and other non-relational data sources. QAnywhere: QAnywhere facilitates the development of robust and secure store- and-forward mobile messaging applications. SQL Remote: SQL Remote technology is based on a store and forward architecture that allows occasionally connected users to synchronize data between SQL Anywhere databases using a file or message transfer mechanism.  Differences between SAP ASE and SAP Sybase SQL Anywhere  SQL Anywhere databases are designed for a full range of functionality including enterprise servers, embedded applications, desktop servers, remote offices, and mobile applications. The SQL Anywhere database is designed to be self managing, requiring no DBA to constantly maintain the database system. Everything is in the box with SQL Anywhere. SQL Anywhere is a lot cheaper: purchase price, licensing fees, AND the price you won't have to pay for all the technical support. Especially because you only have one thing to buy. _The SQL Anywhere database is light weight, but still offers full enterprise features such as:_ * High Availability * Database Clustering * Snapshot Isolation * Materialized Views * Built-in Web Services Server * Self- tuning Query Optimizer _SAP ASE is a fully featured enterprise database server designed specifically for mission-critical data management systems and ASE offers features such as:_ * High Availability * Encrypted Columns * Advanced Security * Distributed Transactions * Content Management * Data Partitioning For example, SAP ASE is having multiple components for respective functionality and expensive compared to SQL Anywhere: if you want to replicate data between Oracle and ASE, you have to buy ASE, then you have to buy Replication Server, then you have to buy the Oracle version of something call \\"Replication Server Options\\". With SQL Anywhere, MobiLink is in the box, and so is the interface for Oracle. And the docs are all in one Help file too.

The Edict of Amboise, also known as the Edict of Pacification, was signed at the Château of Amboise on 19 March 1563 by Catherine de' Medici, acting as regent for her son Charles IX of France. The treaty officially ended the first phase of the French Wars of Religion. Moreover, the treaty restored peace to France by guaranteeing the Huguenots religious privileges and freedoms. Though the Edict was not as generous as the Edict of Saint-Germain (January 1562), it still allowed open and unregulated Protestant services in the private households of noblesPart of the Catholic establishment's fear of Calvinism was as an agent of radical grass-roots reforms (see Jonathan Powis, \\"Order, religion, and the magistrates of a provincial parlement in sixteenth-century France\\", Archiv für Reformationsgeschichte 81 [1980:180-96]).

The Parlement of Paris, which had expelled its Huguenot members, resisted registering the Edict—as did the provincial parlements— but capitulated after remonstrances, adding the proviso that the Edict was to have limited application until the King should achieve his majority, when a national council would decide the religious question. When the King announced his majority (17 August 1563, shortly after his thirteenth birthday), he chose the provincial Parlement of Rouen as the unprecedented site of his lit de justice and published at the same time a more comprehensive version of the Edict.

The Braford is red like a Hereford with white underbelly, head, and feet. It is stockier than a Hereford, though, getting the stockiness from the Brahman. The Braford is primarily used for beef, but sometimes used for rodeo. Brafords were developed both in Australia in 1946 and in Florida in 1947. There is two lines of pure Braford, australian and american Braford. Brafords have heat and insect resistance because of the increased number of sweat glands and oily skin inherited from their Brahman heritage. They have been known to be of an ornery disposition, though this may be due to their raising, any predisposition toward being difficult is still a subject of debate. They are often used in Rodeos due to their massive bulk and bone density, hardiness, heat endurance, and arguably their ornery disposition. They do well in warm climates though they have been raised in northern climates and seem to do well there as well, likely due to their great bulk.

After the Second World War, the club reformed as Kilmory United and played until 1955. The club reformed in 1977, the players being school leavers and some more experienced players who had come to live in the Mid Argyll area. This team disbanded in 1994 due to team raising difficulties. The present Kilmory Camanachd Club was re-formed in 1998 Kilmory have won the following major trophies since 1977, Division Two Fraser Cup in 1978–79, 1985–86, 1988–89, 1991–92 and 1999–00; Bullough Cup in 1979 and 1992. After the reformation of the club in 1977, the club also formed a second team which took the name Furnace, one of the most famous names in shinty. Furnace Shinty Club Furnace won the Camanachd Cup in 1923 without conceding a goal to any team, a feat not repeated until Newtonmore in 2013. It was also an example of Furnace using early sports science to deduce that their final opponent Newtonmore's stamina was due to their backgrounds as gameskeepers and shepherds; Furnace started doing road running to build up their leg strength.. Furnace joined with Inveraray as Lochfyneside and twice reached but lost in Camanachd Cup Finals - 1949 and 1953.

The club's second team restarted in 2008 and will compete in the Bullough Cup. Kilmory Today The club won South Division One in 2004 but lost to Strathglass in a playoff for promotion to the National League. The club struggled in the 2011 season, avoiding relegation by beating Aberdour in the penultimate game of the season. This was a disappointing year after a successful 2010 that saw them reach third in the league. The 2018 season has been fairly good with only 2 defeats (9/05/18) so far this season.

John Prince (1643–1723), vicar of Totnes and Berry Pomeroy in Devon, England, was a biographer. He is best known for his Worthies of Devon, a series of biographies of Devon-born notables covering the period before the Norman Conquest to his own era. He became the subject of a sexual scandal, the court records of which were made into a book in 2001 and a play in 2005. Origins John Prince was born in 1643 in a farmhouse (now called Prince's Abbey) on the site of Newenham Abbey, in the parish of Axminster, Devon. He was the eldest son of Bernard Prince (died 1689) (to whom John erected a monument in Axminster Church) by his first wife Mary Crocker, daughter of John Crocker,Courtney, William Prideaux. \\"Prince, John (1643–1723)\\", Dictionary of National Biography, London, 1885–1900, Volume 46. of the ancient Crocker family seated at Lyneham House in the parish of Yealmpton, Devon. Lyneham was,Pevsner, p.553 After HeleVivian, p.254 the second earliest known home of the Crocker family, one of the most ancient in Devon according to the traditional rhyme quoted by Prince himself which he called \\"that old saw often used among us in discourse\\":Prince, 1810 edition, p.274 Crocker, Cruwys,Cruwys of Cruwys Morchard and Coplestone,Coplestone of Copplestone When the Conqueror came were at home John Prince had a family connection to his great contemporary John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough (1650–1722). Prince's father Bernard Prince had married secondly (as her second husband) to Jane Drake,Vivian, p.296 a daughter of Philip Drake of Salcombe, third in descent from John Drake of Axmouth, father of John Drake (died 1558) of Ash, in the parish of Musbury. Jane was thus 3rd cousin of Sir John Drake (died 1636) of Ash, the father of Sir John Drake, 1st Baronet (died 1669), whose sister was Elizabeth Drake, mother of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough (1650–1722).Vivian, pp. 292–297 Sir John Drake, 1st Baronet (died 1669) was John Prince's godfather, and one of Prince's Worthies was Sir Bernard Drake (died 1586) of Ash, son of John Drake (died 1558). Career He was educated at Brasenose College, Oxford, and became curate of Bideford. He then became minister of St. Martin's Church in Exeter. He was vicar of St Mary's Church, Totnes from 1675 until 1681, when, at the invitation of the Duke of Somerset, he was made vicar of Berry Pomeroy, a post he held for over forty years. Here he seems to have authorised much building work, as the church and vicarage have several period features. The Worthies of Devon While at Berry Pomeroy, Prince worked on his magnum opus: a biography of his home county's many notable figures, which he probably finished in 1697. The book ran to 600 pages, with woodcuts to illustrate the 191 biographies, and he struggled to get it published because most publishers able to handle such a large book were based in London or Oxbridge. Funding was also a problem, as a scandal (see below) had temporarily deprived him of his living. The printer was forced to advertise for subscribers, while the book languished for four years. It was first published in 1701 under the title (no doubt inspired by the Worthies of England (1662) by Thomas Fuller (1608–1661)):Prince, 1810 edition, Title page > Danmonii Orientales Illustres: or, the Worthies of Devon. A work, wherein > the lives and fortunes of the most famous divines, statesmen, swordsmen, > physicians, writers, and other eminent persons, natives of that most noble > province from before the Norman Conquest, down to the present age, are > memorised, in an alphabetical order out of the most approved authors, both > in print and manuscript. In which an account is given, not only of divers > very deserving persons, (many of which were never hitherto made publick) but > of several antient and noble families; their seats and habitations; the > distance they bear to the next great towns; their coats of arms fairly cut; > with other things, no less profitable, than pleasant and delightful. The Dumnonii, Danmonii or Dumnones were a British Celtic tribe which inhabited Dumnonia, the peninsula now containing in its west the county of Cornwall and in its east Devon. Prince's Latin title signifies \\"Illustrious Eastern Dumnonii\\". It is evident that Prince was over-ambitious in his work. The alphabetical entries from A to H fill half the book, while L to Z are squeezed into the final quarter, as money problems took their toll on his inclusions. A second volume, detailing 115 entries chosen by Prince to redress the balance, was never published, though a manuscript exists in the Devon Record Office. This manuscript was discussed, and its biographies listed, by J. Brooking-Rowe in an article in the 1900 volume of the Transactions of the Devonshire Association. Editions A further edition was published in 1810 by Edward Upham, Exeter and Longman and Hurst, Rees and Orme, London, printed for Rees and Curtis, Plymouth. It was inscribed to \\"The Right Hon. Hugh, Earl Fortescue, Viscount Ebrington and Baron Fortescue of Castle Hill, Lord- Lieutenant and Custos Rotulorum of the County of Devon\\", whose \\"ancestors claim a distinguished place\\" in the work. It was funded by subscription, with a list of subscribers included after the list of contents. Marriage Prince married Gertrude Salter (1644–1725), youngest daughter of Anthony Salter, a physician of Exeter, by his wife Gertrude Acland, a daughter of John Acland (died 1641), of the parish of St Olave, Exeter, Mayor of Exeter in 1627. Prince included in his \\"Worthies\\" an uncle and a great-uncle of his wife. John Acland was the 2nd son of Baldwin Acland (died 1572) of Hawkridge, Chittlehampton, a junior branch of the later prominent Acland family which originated at Acland, Landkey, North Devon, later seated at Killerton.Vivian, p.7, pedigree of Acland of Exeter Gertrude Acland's eldest brother was Baldwin Acland (1607–1672), Treasurer of Exeter Cathedral, whom Prince made one of his \\"Worthies of Devon\\", which biography he termed a \\"slender monument to the memory of a good man and a worthy divine\\".Prince, 1810 edition, p.8 Gertrude's mother was Elizabeth Duck, sister of Nicholas Duck (1570–1628), Recorder of Exeter, whom Prince also made one of his Worthies, whose biography also contained a substantial biography of her other younger brother Arthur Duck (1580–1649), a lawyer and MP.Vivian, pp. 7, 309 =Sexual scandal= In 2001 Todd Gray published the court depositions of Prince's church trial as The Curious Sexual Adventure of the Reverend John Prince,Gray, Todd (2001) The Curious Sexual Adventure of the Reverend John Prince. Exeter: Mint Press which awakened interest in Prince. It was while serving as vicar of Berry Pomeroy that a scandal occurred. In April 1699, Prince arranged a meeting with a local woman, Mary Southcote, in the back room of an inn. Their dalliance was witnessed through a broken window, they were interrupted, and a court case followed later that year. However, despite many statements against him, Prince was allowed to keep his post (from which he had been suspended), as the main witnesses were deemed to be unreliable. He returned to Berry Pomeroy and lived out his years as vicar. A plaque in St Mary's Church in Totnes states that he was well connected, and it is possible that the trial was set up by his enemies. The records of the trial were hitherto unpublished, partly due to the coarse language used by some of the witnesses; it was not until the modern age that such language became less shocking and could be included in a popular work. In 2005 the book was adapted as a play, The Tale of John Prince, which was performed by the South Devon Players theatre company in 2006, at two venues relevant to the story: The Seven Sisters Hotel in Totnes (next door to the former site of Angel's inn); and also in Berry Pomeroy Church.

Later, ministerial institutes were incorporated into the Battle Creek College curriculum. By the 1910s Arthur G. Daniells began to make calls for more ministerial education. These attempts were not realized until the beginning of the \\"Advanced Bible Training School\\" on the campus of Pacific Union College in 1934. The fledgling Seminary moved to the campus of Washington Missionary College in 1937 and renamed the Seventh-day Adventist Theological Seminary.  Organization  The Seminary consists of seven departments: Christian Ministry, Church History, Discipleship and Religious Education, New Testament, Old Testament, Theology and Christian Philosophy, and World Mission. A number of study centers and institutes are also attached to the Seminary: Center for Youth Evangelism (CYE), North American Division Evangelism Institute (NADEI), Institute for Jewish-Christian Study, Institute of Archaeology, the Institute of World Mission, Christian Leadership Center, and the Greek Manuscript Research Center.  Enrollment  In 1961 the Seminary had an enrollment of 129. By 2007 the Seminary's enrollment had increased to 768 students. The Seminary offers professional and academic programs. Professional programs include the Master of Divinity, the MA in Pastoral Ministry, the MA in Youth and Young Adult Ministry, the Doctor of Ministry, and the Doctor of Missiology. Academic programs include the MA (Religion), the MA (Religious Education), the Doctor of Philosophy (Religion), the Doctor of Philosophy (Religious Education), the Doctor of Philosophy (Biblical and Ancient Near Eastern Archaeology), and the Doctor of Theology. Three of these programs are offered at various sites in the U.S. and overseas (MA (Religion), MA in Pastoral Ministry, and the DMin). As of 2010, its total enrollment is over 1200 students.  Horn Archeological Museum  In 1970 the Seminary opened up an archeological museum. The core collection of several hundred items came from Siegfried H. Horn and other donors. The museum was named in honor of Dr. Horn in 1979.  Presidents and Deans  The Advanced Bible School (1934-1937) was the forerunner of the Seventh-day Adventist Theological Seminary. In addition, the SDA Theological Seminary became part of Potomac University from 1957-1960, which in 1960 merged with Emmanuel Missionary College, in Berrien Springs, Michigan, to become Andrews University.

It has Specialist School Status in the areas of English and Humanities. As of 2014, it also includes a Studio school site. History The upper school on Bexton Rd was opened as a secondary modern school for boys and girls on 13 November 1953. The lower school on Westfield Drive was built as a separate school for girls and opened on 26 April 1966. In 1973 the two schools combined to form one comprehensive co- educational establishment known as Knutsford County High School.The Story of Knutsford by Charles R Bennett Over 2011-12, work was being performed on the lower site to remove asbestos that was built into the walls. Knutsford High School became Knutsford Academy on 1 April 2012 after gaining Academy status. This brought with it a complete uniform change. Instead of the previous Blue polo shirt and jumper, the current uniform consists of a blue blazer, embroidered with the Academy Logo, with a striped tie. Years 7-9 wear a tie with stripes highlighted by light blue outline whereas students in years 10-11 wear a more simplistic tie. The school has a full traditional sixth-form facility, running alongside or as an alternative to the Studio. Buildings There are two main sites to the school, lower and upper school. The Upper Site also has the new Studio School building. Between the two sites there is a public walkway known as the link path. Students in years 7 to 8 are taught in the lower school building. At year 9 the students begin at upper school. Lower school was once known as middle school as it was considered the middle stage of education back when students were expected to find work after their final year at the school - upper school being the last stage of education. The upper school building is joined to the Knutsford Leisure Centre providing sporting facilities for the P.E department. Outside both buildings are fields with multiple football pitches and multiple tennis courts and a three-pitch astroturf pitch. As of 2014, the Upper Site features a \\"Studio School\\" , headed by Nicola Hall, who was brought in especially for the job. George Osborne, member of Parliament for Tatton, was there to officially start the construction of the new site. The site was opened officially on 22 January 2015 by George Osborne. Technology Knutsford Academy offers technology available for CAD (Computer Aided Design), Computer Graphics and physical construction design, with hardware including over 100 individual Apple macs. Those available to all upper students and most teachers have white mac books (most running OSX Tiger or Windows XP) or Notebooks. These were replaced 2013-14 with Toshiba Laptops. For students, there are over two hundred general use ICT computers across both sites. Most computers are able to use industry- standard software, such as Adobe Creative Suite 6, or CS6. In 2014, Microsoft Office 365 was in the process of starting to replace the existing Office 2013 software. The school also has laser cutters for cutting out CAD work and numerous other wood working devices.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1982. The building is also on the NRHP as a contributing property of the Main Street Historic District.. Structure The building is made of limestone using a structural system of load bearing masonry. It was designed by the Office of the Supervising Architect under James A. Wetmore and built by W. H. Frissell & Co. of New York City.  Relationship to surroundings  This fine, two-story example of the Renaissance Revival style is located on the south west corner of Court and Main Streets facing the Connecticut River. Across Court Street to the north is the massive Liberty Bank building and to its south across a parking lot; is the Bank of America building. Together these three buildings give this section of the central business district a solid and classical look.  Significance  In 1911, the United States Government decided to build a new post office facility in Middletown. Preparations for construction began shortly thereafter. The selection of the building's location was a topic of much controversy. The government finally chose this location, federally owned since 1841, in the center of Middletown's commercial and financial district. Contemporary sources indicate that the new post office was a source of civic pride for the citizens of Middletown. Its facade of smooth limestone distinguished it in a city center where brick and Portland brownstone were the common building materials. The classical facade displays a two-story arrangement of arched windows and pilasters supporting an elaborate entablature. The interior features a large two story open lobby. The old post office ceased operation in 1977, ending 136 years of federal use of that site.  Current use and condition  Liberty Bank uses this building as office space and keeps the building in good condition.

In graph theory, an intersection graph is a graph that represents the pattern of intersections of a family of sets. Any graph can be represented as an intersection graph, but some important special classes of graphs can be defined by the types of sets that are used to form an intersection representation of them. Formal definition Formally, an intersection graph G is an undirected graph formed from a family of sets :Si, i = 0, 1, 2, ... by creating one vertex vi for each set Si, and connecting two vertices vi and vj by an edge whenever the corresponding two sets have a nonempty intersection, that is, :E(G) = {{vi, vj}  Si ∩ Sj ≠ ∅}. All graphs are intersection graphs Any undirected graph G may be represented as an intersection graph: for each vertex vi of G, form a set Si consisting of the edges incident to vi; then two such sets have a nonempty intersection if and only if the corresponding vertices share an edge. provide a construction that is more efficient (which is to say requires a smaller total number of elements in all of the sets Si combined) in which the total number of set elements is at most n2/4 where n is the number of vertices in the graph. They credit the observation that all graphs are intersection graphs to , but say to see also . The intersection number of a graph is the minimum total number of elements in any intersection representation of the graph. Classes of intersection graphs Many important graph families can be described as intersection graphs of more restricted types of set families, for instance sets derived from some kind of geometric configuration: * An interval graph is defined as the intersection graph of intervals on the real line, or of connected subgraphs of a path graph. * An indifference graph may be defined as the intersection graph of unit intervals on the real line * A circular arc graph is defined as the intersection graph of arcs on a circle. * A polygon-circle graph is defined as the intersection of polygons with corners on a circle. * One characterization of a chordal graph is as the intersection graph of connected subgraphs of a tree. * A trapezoid graph is defined as the intersection graph of trapezoids formed from two parallel lines. They are a generalization of the notion of permutation graph, in turn they are a special case of the family of the complements of comparability graphs known as cocomparability graphs. * A unit disk graph is defined as the intersection graph of unit disks in the plane. * A circle graph is the intersection graph of a set of chords of a circle. * The circle packing theorem states that planar graphs are exactly the intersection graphs of families of closed disks in the plane bounded by non-crossing circles. * Scheinerman's conjecture (now a theorem) states that every planar graph can also be represented as an intersection graph of line segments in the plane. However, intersection graphs of line segments may be nonplanar as well, and recognizing intersection graphs of line segments is complete for the existential theory of the reals . * The line graph of a graph G is defined as the intersection graph of the edges of G, where we represent each edge as the set of its two endpoints. * A string graph is the intersection graph of curves on a plane. * A graph has boxicity k if it is the intersection graph of multidimensional boxes of dimension k, but not of any smaller dimension. * A clique graph is the intersection graph of maximal cliques of another graph * A block graph of clique tree is the intersection graph of biconnected components of another graph characterized the intersection classes of graphs, families of finite graphs that can be described as the intersection graphs of sets drawn from a given family of sets. It is necessary and sufficient that the family have the following properties: *Every induced subgraph of a graph in the family must also be in the family. *Every graph formed from a graph in the family by replacing a vertex by a clique must also belong to the family. *There exists an infinite sequence of graphs in the family, each of which is an induced subgraph of the next graph in the sequence, with the property that every graph in the family is an induced subgraph of a graph in the sequence. If the intersection graph representations have the additional requirement that different vertices must be represented by different sets, then the clique expansion property can be omitted. Related concepts An order-theoretic analog to the intersection graphs are the inclusion orders. In the same way that an intersection representation of a graph labels every vertex with a set so that vertices are adjacent if and only if their sets have nonempty intersection, so an inclusion representation f of a poset labels every element with a set so that for any x and y in the poset, x ≤ y if and only if f(x) ⊆ f(y).

Since the nitrogen component of air is not heated, fuel consumption is reduced, and higher flame temperatures are possible. Historically, the primary use of oxy-fuel combustion has been in welding and cutting of metals, especially steel, since oxy-fuel allows for higher flame temperatures than can be achieved with an air-fuel flame. There is currently research being done in firing fossil-fueled power plants with an oxygen-enriched gas mix instead of air. Almost all of the nitrogen is removed from input air, yielding a stream that is approximately 95% oxygen. Firing with pure oxygen would result in too high a flame temperature, so the mixture is diluted by mixing with recycled flue gas, or staged combustion. The recycled flue gas can also be used to carry fuel into the boiler and ensure adequate convective heat transfer to all boiler areas. Oxy-fuel combustion produces approximately 75% less flue gas than air fueled combustion and produces exhaust consisting primarily of CO2 and H2O (see figure). Economy and efficiency The justification for using oxy-fuel is to produce a CO2 rich flue gas ready for sequestration. Oxy-fuel combustion has significant advantages over traditional air-fired plants. Among these are: * The mass and volume of the flue gas are reduced by approximately 75%. * Because the flue gas volume is reduced, less heat is lost in the flue gas. * The size of the flue gas treatment equipment can be reduced by 75%. * The flue gas is primarily CO2, suitable for sequestration. * The concentration of pollutants in the flue gas is higher, making separation easier. * Most of the flue gases are condensable; this makes compression separation possible. * Heat of condensation can be captured and reused rather than lost in the flue gas. * Because nitrogen from air is absent, nitrogen oxide production is greatly reduced. Economically speaking this method costs more than a traditional air- fired plant. The main problem has been separating oxygen from the air. This process requires much energy, nearly 15% of production by a coal-fired power station can be consumed for this process. However, a new technology which is not yet practical called chemical looping combustion can be used to reduce this cost. In chemical looping combustion, the oxygen required to burn the coal is produced internally by oxidation and reduction reactions, as opposed to using more expensive methods of generating oxygen by separating it from air. At present in the absence of any need to reduce CO2 emissions, oxy-fuel is not competitive. However, oxy-fuel is a viable alternative to removing CO2 from the flue gas from a conventional air-fired fossil fuel plant. However, an oxygen concentrator might be able to help, as it simply removes nitrogen. In industries other than power generation, oxy-fuel combustion can be competitive due to higher sensible heat availability. Oxy-fuel combustion is common in various aspects of metal production. The glass industry has been converting to oxy-fuel since the early 1990s because glass furnaces require a temperature of approximately 1500 degrees C, which is not attainable at adiabatic flame temperatures for air-fuel combustion unless heat is regenerated between the flue stream and the incoming air stream. Historically, glass furnace regenerators were large and expensive high temperature brick ducts filled with brick arranged in a checkerboard pattern to capture heat as flue gas exits the furnace. When the flue duct is thoroughly heated, air flow is reversed and the flue duct becomes the air inlet, releasing its heat into the incoming air, and allowing for higher furnace temperatures than can be attained with air-fuel only. Two sets of regenerative flue ducts allowed for the air flow to be reversed at regular intervals, and thus maintain a high temperature in the incoming air. By allowing new furnaces to be built without the expense of regenerators, and especially with the added benefit of nitrogen oxide reduction, which allows glass plants to meet emission restrictions, oxy-fuel is cost effective without the need to reduce CO2 emissions. Oxy-fuel combustion also reduces CO2 release at the glass plant location, although this may be offset by CO2 production due to electric power generation which is necessary to produce oxygen for the combustion process. Oxy-fuel combustion may also be cost effective in the incineration of low BTU value hazardous waste fuels. It is often combined with staged combustion for nitrogen oxide reduction, since pure oxygen can stabilize combustion characteristics of a flame. Pilot plants There are pilot plants undergoing initial proof-of- concept testing to evaluate the technologies for scaling up to commercial plants, including * Callide A Power Station in Queensland Australia * Schwarze Pumpe Power Station in Spremberg, Germany * CIUDEN in Cubillos del Sil, Spain * NET Power Demonstration Facility = White Rose plant = One case study of oxy-fuel combustion is the attempted White Rose plant in North Yorkshire, United Kingdom. The planned project was an oxy-fuel power plant coupled with air separation to capture two million tons of carbon dioxide per year. The carbon dioxide would then be delivered by pipeline to be sequestered in a saline aquifer beneath the North Sea. However, in late 2015 and early 2016, following withdrawal of funding by the Drax Group and the U.K. government, construction was halted. The unforeseen loss of the federal CCS Commercialisation Programme, along with decreased subsidies for renewable energy, left the White Rose Plant with insufficient funds to continue development.

It is one of the most important landmarks in the town because of its religious significance, as it is located near the Saint George Monastery. Al-Fawwar is basically a small grotto which is entered by going down a few steps where water is released from a few openings. The spring is known for flowing sporadically with random time intervals, the spring might not flow in days or even months. Loud sounds emitted from the underground would usually signal that the spring will flow and are heard minutes before the it starts flowing. The water would usually keep on flowing for a few hours, sometimes a day or two and the water would spread to smaller springs. This phenomenon is explainable though, the water at the opening traps the air and under high pressure the air pushes the water and causes this random strong flow of water. People regard this event as a good sign of good luck and are always happy when this happens. The spring is surrounded with many restaurants, cafeterias and hotels. Thousands visit the Al-Fawwar spring every year, mainly tourists and visitors visiting the monastery. This spring was called \\"Sabte\\" during the reign of the Roman emperor Titus in Syria.

Neil Genzlinger's review in the New York Times was dismissive, focusing on the legendary status of Eartha Kitt, who plays but a minor role, stating that she was \\"really [the] only one character worth mentioning\\".

Production history From 1955 to 1969, 15,347 of these 594 cc shaft-drive, opposed twin motorcycles were built. The R69 was produced from 1955 to 1960, the R69S was produced from 1960 to 1969,Falloon, page 15 and the 42 hp R69US was produced from 1968 to 1969.Falloon, page 19 These models were designed as relatively high powered, high compression sport bikes, although the Earles fork R69 and R69S came with sidecar lugs installed on the frames. These lugs were deleted from the telescopic fork \\"US\\" models. The low compression R60/2, produced from 1955 to 1960, was designed primarily for sidecar use, though it was popularly used as a solo bike, along with the 30 hp R60US, which was produced between 1968 and 1969. The sport-oriented R69S, R69US, and R69 succeeded the plunger-framed 1951 to 1955 R68, which had an engine very similar to that in the later R69. The R69US models, with telescopic forks, which were used later on the BMW R-/5 series motorcycles, were introduced in the United States for the 1968 model year and then continued for 1969. Front and rear side reflectors, demanded by the U. S. Department of Transportation, were introduced only for the 1969 model year, along with a DOT sticker that was placed on the rear fender. The previous Earles fork continued to be offered during these years. In June 1962, Cycle World magazine published a review of the R69S.

It is designed to enhance oxygen delivery to damaged tissues. Through a collaborative agreement, Oxycyte (under the development code name of ABL-101) is now being developed by Aurum Biosciences Ltd, with an initial indication in acute ischemic stroke. Product When used as an intravenous emulsion, Oxycyte can carry as much as five times more oxygen than hemoglobin, making it an effective means of transporting oxygen to tissues and carrying carbon dioxide to the lungs for disposal.Oxygen Biotherapeutics, Inc. Corporate website. Like all PFC-based products, Oxycyte is not a complete blood substitute. Because Oxycyte is a PFC, and not based on hemoglobin, it does not have the safety issues associated with hemoglobin-based products; there have been no adverse events in company clinical trials that were related to Oxycyte. Tenax believes that Oxycyte has a very favorable risk-benefit profile for its potential indications. Aurum Biosciences has received Wellcome Trust HICF funding to take Oxycyte into a phase IIa clinical trial in stroke patients. This work will investigate both therapeutic potential and its ability to enhance the diagnostic potential of MRI in stroke.

She was a professor of Hindi language and literature at the department of Middle Eastern and Asian Languages and Cultures (MEALAC) at Columbia University, New York. She wrote predominantly about the experiences of Indians in the South Asian diaspora, focusing on psychological and 'interior' cultural conflicts. Unlike other prominent Indian American novelists she wrote mainly in Hindi rather than in English. She has been widely translated into English, French, Dutch and other languages by artists, academics, and students. She was an actress in India in the 1960s and early 1970s. In the United States she appeared on such shows as True Crime: New York City, Third Watch, and Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, and in movies such as The Guru (2002) and ABCD (1999). She was the mother of the actress Purva Bedi. In 2007 she was awarded 100,000 rupees by Uttar Pradesh Hindi Sansthan for her contributions to Hindi language and literature. In January 2006 she was honored by Sahitya Academy in Delhi for her contributions to Hindi literature. She died on 20 March 2020 at the age of 74.सम्‍मानित कथाकार और उपन्‍यासकार सुषम बेदी का निधन Early career Bedi began her writing career in high school and college, entering local competitions and writing articles and stories for magazines. She also worked as an actress and commentator on Indian television in the late-1960s and 1970s. She attended Delhi University and Panjab University in India and taught Hindi literature. Her PhD dissertation was published in 1984 as Innovation and Experimentation in Contemporary Hindi Drama by Parag publications in India. From 1974 to 1979 she wrote for The Times of India as one of their correspondents from Brussels, Belgium. In 1979 she came to the United States with her husband. Academic career Bedi was involved in exploring questions of identity, authenticity, and transformation, in her cultural criticism and academic work, and these themes are reflected as well in her fiction writing. She was the author of eight major Hindi language novels, as well as collections of Hindi short stories and poetry. These have been widely translated and have been the subject of academic dissertations and debates on the South Asian diaspora experience. She was also involved in Hindi language pedagogical research and developed original reading and listening comprehension materials in Hindi. Many of these materials are available on the internet. Her \\"Using Authentic Materials in the Language Classroom: A Case in Hindi\\" was included in the anthology Teaching and Acquisition of South Asian Languages (University of Pennsylvania Press). From 1990 to 1991, she contributed to a BBC weekly program, Letters from Abroad, in which she discussed day to day issues about life in New York. Fiction writing Her most well-known novel is Havan (1989), which was translated into English by David Rubin and published by Heinemann International under the title The Fire Sacrifice in 1993. Her novels and short stories often feature female protagonists who are in the process of negotiating new identities which are neither fully old nor new, often finding identity and strength in the impurities in their lives. Bedi's narrative focus tends to be on the negotiative and transformative process itself, the pain and tragedy of cultural loss, but also the sense of hope and opportunity in forging new and stronger identities if one is willing to endure the transformative process. Her works are thus located squarely in the South Asian diaspora and immigrant experience.

Fred C. Ellis (1885–1965) was an American editorial cartoonist. He is best remembered as one of the leading radical artists of the 1920s and 1930s as an artist for various publications of the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA), including stints on the staff of the CPUSA's daily newspaper. Biography =Early years= Fred Ellis was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1885. He left school after eighth grade to take a job as an office boy for Frank Lloyd Wright. He worked later in an engraving shop and an ice cream factory before becoming a \\"trucker\\" at a meat factory, transporting prepared meat from refrigerators to railway cars for shipment around the country. In 1905, the 20-year-old Ellis was among 20,000 Chicago packinghouse workers who went out on strike, with the truckers seeking a pay raise from the $1.98 the workers were then averaging per 12-hour day. The strike proved to be a failure, ended by the economic pressure exerted through the hiring of strikebreakers, and Ellis and his mates ultimately returned to work only to see their pay cut further. Despite the poor rate of pay, Ellis nevertheless managed to save $100 over a three-year period, which he chose to invest in his education. Having a proclivity for drawing, Ellis enrolled in the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts where he studied art for two months, quitting after his finances were depleted. =Artistic career= After leaving school Ellis became a sign painter, specializing in the painting of large outdoor signs. He ultimately worked for 21 years at this trade. In 1919, while working as a sign painter for the General Outdoor Advertising Company, Ellis slipped and fell five stories from a scaffold outside of a Chicago building, breaking 32 bones when he hit the asphalt below. Ellis's convalescence proved to be extensive, including six weeks in the hospital followed by two years during which he was forced to use crutches and a cane. During this period of recovery, Ellis became familiar with a new weekly magazine published by the Chicago Federation of Labor called The New Majority — a publication which reprinted radical drawings by such leading political artists of the day as Art Young and Boardman Robinson. The injured sign painter began to work as a cartoonist, submitting his first political art to The New Majority. Prominent communist labor leader William Z. Foster was the circulation manager of The New Majority at this time, and it was through him that Ellis made contact with the Workers Party of America, which he joined in 1924.Alfred Durus, \\"Fred Ellis: Artist of the Proletariat,\\" International Literature, issue 1935-2. Ellis drew extensively for the Communist movement from 1923 onward, contributing material to The Daily Worker. The Liberator, the Labor Herald, and other publications. In 1927, Ellis moved to New York City to become staff cartoonist of the Workers (Communist) Party's official newspaper, The Daily Worker. From 1930 to 1936, Ellis lived and worked in Berlin and Moscow, where he drew for Pravda, Izvestiya, and the English-language Moscow Daily News.M.R.R., \\"Fred Ellis Papers: An Inventory of His Collection at Syracuse University,\\" Special Collections Research Center, Syracuse University Library, Syracuse, NY, November 2006. In 1936 he returned to his job at the Daily Worker and taught at the American Artists School, a progressive independent art school directed by Harry Gottlieb whose board included many prominent left wing artists such as William Gropper as well as photographer Margaret Bourke-White. Ellis retired in 1955. =Death and legacy= Fred Ellis died in 1965. Ellis's papers are held by Syracuse University in Syracuse, New York. The material includes more than 250 original cartoons, a sketchbook with more than 200 sketches, letters, newspaper clippings, photographs, and other material.

His best-known work, Stella, was the first Haitian novel. Born in Cayes, he served as Secretary to Jerome Maximilien Borgella and later participated in a revolt against President Soulouque. Exiled to Saint Thomas, it was there that he wrote the novel Stella. Marlene Daut has recently revealed in Tropics of Haiti: Race and the Literary History of the Haitian Revolution in the Atlantic World, 1789-1865, that three Haitian journalists and writers from the early twentieth-century, Ulrick Duvivier, Frédéric Marcelin, and Louis Morpeau, suspected or more likely erroneously believed that Stella was actually authored by Bergeaud's wife (413-14, ftn. 2).

It can also involve adapting the same literary work in the same genre or medium just for different purposes, e.g. to work with a smaller cast, in a smaller venue (or on the road), or for a different demographic group (such as adapting a story for children). Sometimes the editing of these works without the approval of the author can lead to a court case. It also appeals because it obviously works as a story; it has interesting characters, who say and do interesting things. This is particularly important when adapting to a dramatic work, e.g. film, stage play, teleplay, as dramatic writing is some of the most difficult. To get an original story to function well on all the necessary dimensions—concept, character, story, dialogue, and action—is an extremely rare event performed by a rare talent. Perhaps most importantly, especially for producers of the screen and stage, an adapted work is more bankable; it represents considerably less risk to investors, and poses the possibilities of huge financial gains. This is because: * It has already attracted a following. * It clearly works as a literary piece in appealing to a broad group of people who care. * Its title, author, characters, etc. may be a franchise in and of themselves already. Film Works of literature have been adapted for film from the dawn of the industry. Some of the earliest examples come from the work of Georges Méliès, who pioneered many film techniques. In 1899, he released two adaptations—Cinderella based on the Brothers Grimm story of the same name and King John, the first known film to be based on the works of Shakespeare. The 1900 film Sherlock Holmes Baffled, directed by Arthur Marvin featured Arthur Conan Doyle's detective character Sherlock Holmes intruding upon a pseudo-supernatural burglary. The film, considered the first detective movie, ran for only 30 seconds and was originally intended to be shown in hand-cranked Mutoscope machines. Méliès' 1902 original science-fiction feature A Trip to the Moon was based loosely on two popular novels of the time: Jules Verne's From the Earth to the Moon (1865) and H. G. Wells' The First Men in the Moon (1901). The first of many adaptations of the Brothers Grimm tale Snow White was released in 1902 while the earliest surviving copy is the 1916 version. 1903 saw the release of Alice in Wonderland directed by Cecil Hepworth and Percy Stow, the first movie adaptation of Lewis Carroll's 1865 children's book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. The first feature-length film to be shot entirely in Hollywood was Cecil B. DeMille's first assignment, The Squaw Man, in 1914, which was the first of three movie versions (all directed by DeMille) based on Edwin Milton Royle's 1905 play of the same name. Since the early days of the genre, major films have been largely adapted: * Novels: Gone With the Wind (1939), From Here to Eternity (1953), and The Godfather (1972) were all adapted from novels of the same name. * Plays: Casablanca (1942), Streetcar Named Desire (1951), and Equus (1977) were all adapted from stage plays. * Short stories: The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (1947), Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961), The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter (1968), Shawshank Redemption (1994), and Brokeback Mountain (2005) were all made from short stories. The most celebrated of the early adaptations is Erich von Stroheim's Greed, a 1924 adaptation of the 1899 novel McTeague by naturalist writer Frank Norris. The director intended to film every aspect of the novel in great detail, resulting in a 9½-hour epic feature. At studio insistence, the film was cut down to two hours and was considered a flop upon its theatrical release. It has since been restored to just over four hours and is considered one of the greatest films ever made. One book that has been adapted very frequently (in one form or another) is Charles Dickens' 1843 Christmas story A Christmas Carol, which has around 20 film adaptations to date. Process Plagiarism occurs in every genre, and throughout history, but such literary rights violations can be challenged in court. In the case of Hollywood films, judgments for the plaintiff can run into the millions of dollars, but these have typically been for outright theft of a screenplay idea rather than for fraudulent adaptations (see Buchwald v. Paramount). Because of the importance of telling a story with a limited number of characters, short stories often make better sources for adaptable material than do novels. For the stage, in addition, theater audiences tend to accept and prefer works of a more conceptual, thought-based nature, meaning their preferences need to be considered when selecting a work for adaptation, but also when determining how best to adapt it. The stage imposes physical limits of size and technology. Not every illusion that can be made to appear real on the movie screen can be made to appear so on stage.

The self-builder's input into this process varies from doing the actual building work to contracting out all the work to an architect or building package company. Motivation Social workers visiting a self-made renovation project of low-cost housing (Brazil) People build individual homes for all sorts of reasons. An important reason, above all in poor countries, is that they might not be able to afford their housing on the open market. Another motivation of self-builders can be the wish to create something tailored to their family's requirements and/or their lifestyle. Methods Cathedral of Justo Gallego Martínez. Without architectural studies, he has been able to self build this in only 40 years (Mejorada del Campo, Spain). Self-builders create their homes through a variety of methods – and seldom build it entirely themselves. In rich countries a lot of them employ an architect to come up with the design of the new home and contract a builder to construct it; others use so-called 'package' companies to provide a one-stop solution. Many others find themselves managing building sites and dealing directly with planners, tradespeople and materials suppliers.  Extent  Self-build in its wider meaning is an ordinary practice in many developing countries. It is also common among certain religious communities like The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church)”Mormons help people build homes in Visayas”, Manila Standard Today or subcultures such as 'hippies'. Usually ecovillages are realised through self-building techniques. In most developed countries self-build is regulated by the public administration, while in developing countries self-build is sometimes supported by NGOs or international organisations like, for instance, United Nations Volunteers. = Ghana = In 2010 the World Bank estimated that self- build housing (also described as self-help or self-provided housing) was supplying more than 95% of Ghana's total housing stock, and that it was contributing with around 300 billion USDs per annum to the national economy. Self-build is not just practised by the poorer households but also by middle- income citizens. Most of Ghana's post-colonials governments like Nkrumah's have been implementing state-run housing schemes because their socialist- oriented agendas avoided to promote self-help housing in order not to boost private ownership by individuals or families. In 2009 the Government of Ghana, in its Draft National Shelter Policy, recognized the importance of self-help and self-build housing and other non-conventional approaches to housing, even if not as a priority. = Italy = In Italy self-build has been, for some decades after World War II, a common practice among the lower class, widely used in squatting areas like the Borgate Romane (Rome) or the suburbs in the north of Naples and around Palermo. Nowadays self-build is rather used as a partial support to house building where the construction of the structural parts (foundation, walls, roof ....) is committed to professionals companies.L'alternativa autocostruzione: una proposta delle cooperative; Rosario Pavia, in La Metropoli \\"spontanea\\": il caso di Roma : 1925–1981, sviluppo residenziale di una città dentro e fuori dal piano, Edizioni Dedalo, 1983; on-line versione: books.google.it (accessed on 9 July 2014) Another application field for self-build in Italy is the support to disadvantaged ethnic groups like Sinti. In some middle-sized cities like Ravenna and Padova masonry classes and build materials were offered to people living in gypsies equipped areas in order to help them to improve their huts.Padova: \\"Progetto Sperimentale di Autocostruzione del Comune di Padova co-finanziato dal Ministero del Lavoro e delle Politiche Sociali\\", 2 April 2010; on-line: operanomadipadova.blog.tiscali.it (accessed on 9 July 2014) In the early 1980s self-build also entered the Italian university programmes: in the architecture faculty of Politecnico di Torino Giorgio Ceragioli introduced in his course of Architectural technology the Laboratorio tecnologico di autocostruzione (Latec), a laboratory where students were allowed to practice several self- build techniques.Programme of the 'course in 'Tecnologia dell'architettura of Politecnico di Torino; didattica.polito.it (accessed on 9 July 2014) = Mexico = In Mexico a very rapid urbanization occurred between 1940s and 1970s, attracting much migration from rural areas. During this period government programmes were not able to ensure enough housing and also the private production was unattractive due to the low wages of a large part of the population. It is estimated that even after the creation of two national housing funds, FONHAPO and INFONAVIT, just 1/5 of the effective demand was satisfied. In this difficult situation, many irregular settlements developed, and some researcher and politician started to sustain that supporting and improving self-build processes rather to fight them was a possible solution to the popular housing issue. So during 1970s public policy started to support low-income self-builder offering them services, core units and in some cases land-ownership regularization. These schemes were criticised by orthodox Marxists, persuaded that ensuring proper housing to people was a government duty and that lack of houses was a structural product of capitalism. Anyway, self-built accommodation became the most common form of housing and, in Mexico City area, it increased from 14% in 1952 to 60% in 1990. Later on, the public policy priority shifted from house production to enhancement of real-estate market, local infrastructures and improvement of existing houses. = United Kingdom = The term 'self build' is specifically used in the UK and Ireland when an individual obtains a building plot and then builds their own home on that plot. The term doesn't necessarily refer to completing the work yourself - more usually, self-build is defined as the act of 'commissioning' a bespoke home.http://www.self-build.co.uk/what-self-build It's estimated that there are between 10,000 and 20,000 self builds in the UK every year. This is less than 10% of all the homes built annually but may constitute as much as 1 in 3 new detached homes built in the UK. Over the years, self-builders have been at the forefront of advances in-house design and technology, being responsible for the dramatic uptake in recent years in eco-features such as solar power and heat pumps; underfloor heating; open plan design and smart home technology. These are features that take many years to filter through to commercial housing developments. There is also an increasing drive for people to self- build overseas, either as investments, holiday homes, retirement homes or relocation. Individual houses can take all forms from the traditional to the radically modern, and the term is also used to refer to people who create individual homes out of old buildings. Current Issues Self-build housing in Pennsylvania. The main impediment to the UK self-build market is the shortage of building plots available to the self-builder, high land prices and the restrictive planning regime. in 2008 the National Self Build Association (NaSBA) was established to order to put pressure on relevant bodies, including the Government, to remedy this situation. The founding members of NaSBA are Bath and District Self Build Association, Build It magazine, BuildStore, Potton/Kingspan, Architecture Verte and Ecomotive. The Association changed its name to the National Custom & Self Build Association (NaCSBA) in July 2014 – borne out of a desire to officially welcome the custom build community.http://www.nacsba.org.uk/about-us Since 2016, local authorities in England are required to maintain a register of people and groups who want to build their own home.

Logogram Publishing, Los Angeles (Cal.) 2006. was a Sumerian title designating the ruler or prince of a city-state. Originally it may have designated an independent ruler, but in later periods the title presupposed subordinance to a lugal. For the Early Dynastic Period (about 2800–2350 BCE), the meaning of the titles en, ensi and lugal cannot be differentiated clearly: see lugal, ensi and en for details. Ensí may have originally been a designation of the ruler restricted to Lagash and Umma.Horst Klengel (Hrsg.): Kulturgeschichte des alten Vorderasiens. Akademie Verlag, Berlin 1989. The ensi was considered a representative of the city-state's patron deity.Saggs, H. W. F. 1988, The Greatness That Was Babylon (revised edition) In later periods, an ensí was normally seen as subordinate to a lugal. Nevertheless, even the powerful rulers of the Second Dynasty of Lagash (c. 2100 BCE) such as Gudea were satisfied with the title ensí. During the Third Dynasty of Ur (about 2100–2000 BCE) énsi referred to the provincial governors of the kingdom. These exercised great powers in terms of government, tax revenue and jurisdiction, but they were supervised, installed, and dismissed by the lugal of Ur. Although the office could be inherited, all ensí had to be endorsed by the lugal. No independent foreign policy or warfare was allowed.Dietz Otto Edzard: Geschichte Mesopotamiens. C.H.

The AC joint is located at the outer end of the clavicle where it attaches to the acromion of the scapula. Symptoms include pain which may make it difficult to move the shoulder and often a deformity. It is most commonly due to a fall onto the front and upper part of the shoulder when the arm is by the side. They are classified as type I, II, III, IV, V, or VI with the higher the number the more severe the injury. Diagnosis is typically based on physical examination and X-rays. In type I and II injuries there is minimal deformity while in a type III injury the deformity resolves upon lifting the arm upwards. In type IV, V, and VI the deformity does not resolve with lifting the arm. Generally types I and II are treated without surgery, while type III may be treated with or without surgery, and types IV, V, and VI are treated with surgery. For type I and II treatment is usually with a sling and pain medications for a week or two. In type III injuries surgery is generally only done if symptoms remain following treatment without surgery. A separated shoulder is a common injury among those involved in sports, especially contact sports. It makes up about half of shoulder injuries among those who play hockey, football, and rugby. Those affected are typically 20 to 30 years old. Males are more often affected than females. The injury was initially classified in 1967 with the current classification from 1984. Cause Acromion-clavicle disjunction (left shoulder) — note that the shoulder is lower and the \\"piano key\\"; the scar on the photograph and the screws on the radiography are ostheosynthesis material from a former trauma repair, without any connection with the present trauma. Separated shoulders often occur in people who participate in sports such as football, soccer, horseback riding, hockey, lacrosse, parkour, combat sports, rowing, rugby, snowboarding, skateboarding, crack the whip, cycling, roller derby and wrestling. The separation is classified into 6 types, with 1 through 3 increasing in severity, and 4 through 6 being the most severe. The most common mechanism of injury is a fall on the tip of the shoulder or also a fall on an outstretched hand. In falls where the force is transmitted indirectly, often only the acromioclavicular ligament is affected, and the coracoclavicular ligaments remain unharmed. In ice hockey, the separation is sometimes due to a lateral force, as when one gets forcefully checked into the side of the rink. Mechanism Right shoulder with AC ligaments The acromion of the scapula is connected to the clavicle by the superior acromioclavicular ligament. The coracoclavicular ligaments connect the clavicle to the coracoid process. The two ligaments that form the coracoclavicular ligaments are the trapezoid and conoid ligaments. These three ligaments add support to the shoulder joint. There are four types of soft tissue disruptions that may cause acromioclavicular separation: * The conoid and trapezoid ligaments may tear at any location * The lateral clavicle may ride upward after being avulsed from its periosteum * The acromioclavicular ligaments may be torn * The conoid- trapezoid ligament origin may avulse from the coracoid Diagnosis Diagnosis is based on physical examination and an x-ray. A physical examination can identify point tenderness, pain at the AC joint with cross-arm adduction, and pain relief with an injection of a local anesthetic. The cross-arm adduction will produce pain specifically at the AC joint and will be done by elevating the arm to a 90° angle, flexing the elbow to a 90° angle, and adducting the arm across the chest. The pain in the shoulder is hard to pinpoint due to the shared innervation of the AC joint and the glenohumeral joint. An injury to the AC joint will result in pain over the AC joint, in the anterolateral neck and in the region in the anterolateral deltoid. X-ray indicates a separated shoulder when the acromioclavicular joint space is widened (it is normally 5 to 8 mm). It can be classified into 6 types. =Type I= A Type I AC separation involves direct trauma to the shoulder causing the injury to ligaments that form the joint, but no severe tearing or fracture. It is commonly referred to as a sprain.An examination using radiography (a type of medical imaging) will show up as normal. =Type II= A Type II AC separation involves complete tearing of the acromioclavicular ligament, as well as a partial tear of the coracoclavicular ligaments. This often causes a noticeable bump on the shoulder. This bump is permanent. The clavicle is unstable to direct stress examination. On radiographs, the lateral end of the clavicle may be slightly elevated by pressing on the sternal aspect of the clavicle forcing the acromial end down, and by releasing, it may pop back up eliciting a piano key sign due to the tearing of the AC. Severe pain and loss of movement are common. =Type III= Type 3 AC joint separation on plain X ray In a Type III AC separation both acromioclavicular and coracoclavicular ligaments are torn without significant disruption of the deltoid or trapezial fascia. A significant bump, resulting in some shoulder deformity, is formed by the lateral end of the clavicle. This bump, caused by the clavicle's dislocation, is permanent. The clavicle can be moved in and out of place on the shoulder. A radiographic examination, will show the results as abnormal. Pain with motion can be severe. =Type IV= This is a type III injury with avulsion of the coracoclavicular ligament from the clavicle, with the distal clavicle displaced posteriorly into or through the trapezius and may tent the posterior skin. A displaced clavicle is easily seen on a radiograph. It is important to evaluate the sternoclavicular joint also, because there can be an anterior dislocation of the sternoclavicular joint and posterior dislocation of the AC joint. This injury is generally acknowledged to require surgery. =Type V= This is a more severe form of a type III injury, with the trapezial and deltoid fascia stripped off of the acromion as well as the clavicle. This is type III but with exaggeration of the vertical displacement of the clavicle from the scapula. Distinguishing between Type III and Type V separations based on radiographs is difficult and often unreliable between surgeons. Type V is manifested by a 2- to 3-fold increase in the coracoclavicular distance. The shoulder manifests as a severe droop, secondary to downward displacement of the scapula and humerus due to loss of the clavicular strut. This injury generally requires surgery. =Type VI= This is type III with inferior dislocation of the distal end of the clavicle below the coracoid. This injury is associated with severe trauma and frequently accompanied by multiple other injuries. The mechanism is thought to be severe hyperabduction and external rotation of the arm, combined with retraction of the scapula. The distal clavicle is found in 2 orientations, either subacromial or subcoracoid. With the subcoracoid dislocation, the clavicle becomes lodged behind the intact conjoined tendon. The posterior superior AC ligaments, which often remain attached to the acromion, get displaced into the AC interval, making anatomic reduction difficult. The tissue needs to be surgically cleared and then reattached after reduction. Most patients with type VI injuries have paresthesia that resolves after relocation of the clavicle It is extremely rare and generally only involved with motor vehicle collisions. This requires surgery. Classification type 1 of AC separation.pngClassification type 1 is the most common type Classification type 2 of AC separation.pngClassification type 2 Classification type 3 of AC separation.pngClassification type 3 Classification type 4 of AC separation.pngClassification type 4 Classification type 5 of AC separation.pngClassification type 5 is rare Classification type 6 of AC separation.pngClassification type 6 is rare Treatment Treatment of a separated shoulder depends on the severity of the injury. When beginning treatment, the first steps should be to control inflammation, and to rest and ice the joint. Anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen may also relieve pain and inflammation. The joint should be iced every four hours for fifteen minutes at a time. One can wear a sling until the pain subsides; then simple exercises can be started. =Non-surgical= Type I and type II shoulder separation are the most common types of separated and rarely need surgery. However, the risk of arthritis with type II separations is greatly increased. If it becomes severe, the Mumford procedure or distal clavicle excision can be performed. Most non-surgical treatment options include physical therapy to build up the muscles and help stabilize the joint. Literature regarding long-term follow-up after surgical repair of type III injuries is scarce, and those treated nonoperatively generally do quite well. Many studies have come to the conclusion that non-surgical treatment is as good as or better than surgical treatment, or that anything attained because of surgery is quite limited. It appears that after a while, the body \\"remodels\\" the joint, either expanding the distal clavicle or causing it to atrophy. There may also be the potential that surgical repair may be less painful in the long run. Once the pain has eased, range-of-motion exercises can be started followed by a strength training program. The strength training will include strengthening of the rotator cuff, and shoulder blade muscles. With most cases the pain goes away after three weeks. Although full recovery can take up to six weeks for type II and up to twelve weeks for type III. Those who do have a separated shoulder will most often return to having full function, although some may have continued pain in the area of the AC joint. With the continued pain there are some things that maybe causing it. It may be due to an abnormal contact between the bone ends when the joint is in motion, the development of arthritis, or an injury to a piece of the cushioning cartilage that is found between the bone ends of this joint. =Surgical= Type IV, V, and VI shoulder separations are very uncommon but always require surgery. There is some debate among orthopedic surgeons, however, about the treatment of type III shoulder separation. Many with type III shoulder separation who do not undergo surgical treatment recover just as well as those who do receive it, and avoid the added risks that surgery may present. Those who opt out of surgery also have faster recovery times and are able to return to work or sports sooner. Some studies suggest early surgical treatment of type III separation may benefit laborers and athletes who perform overhead motions. The potential benefit of surgical treatment for type III remains unproven. There have been many surgeries described for complete acromioclavicular separations, including arthroscopic surgery. There is no consensus on which is best. There has been a focus on attempting to restore horizontal, as well as vertical, instability. A review found that although horizontal stability can be more reliably restored with additional acromioclavicular joint reconstruction (in addition to coracoclavicular ligament reconstruction), there is no clear advantage with respect to outcomes. A common surgery is some form of modified Weaver-Dunn procedure, which involves cutting off the end of the clavicle portion, partially sacrificing the coracoacromial ligament and suturing the displaced acromial end to the lateral aspect of the clavicle for stabilization, then often some form of additional support is introduced to replace the coracoclavicular ligament(s). Variations of this support includes grafting of tendons from the leg or the use of synthetic sutures or suture anchors. Other surgeries have used a Rockwood screw that is inserted initially and then removed after 12 weeks. Physical therapy is always recommended after surgery, and most patients get flexibility back, although possibly somewhat limited. After one does have surgery, a sling should be worn to support and protect the shoulder for a few days. For the first couple physical therapy visits, the treatment will focus on controlling the pain and swelling. Type of treatment can include, ice and electrical stimulation, massage, or other hand on treatment to help ease the pain and muscle spasm. After about four weeks range of motion exercises can be started. Passive exercises are done which the shoulder joint is moved but the muscles stay relaxed. After about six to eight weeks active therapy is started. Such exercises can include isometric strengthening which works the muscles without straining the healing of the joint. After about three months, more active strengthening will be incorporated which focus on improving the strength and control of the rotator cuff muscles and the muscles around the shoulder blade. The exercises that the therapist gives the patient to be done at home should be done to be able to get a better recovery in the long run. =Physical therapy= File:Dumbbell-lateral-raises-1.pngStrengthening the shoulder joint.

This is generally inefficient and such systems are often considered to be examples of an anti- pattern.  Examples  Examples are visible in plugin-based software such as some text editors and web browsers which often have developers create plugins that recreate software that would normally run on top of the operating system itself. The Firefox add-on mechanism has been used to develop a number of FTP clients and file browsers, which effectively replicate some of the features of the operating system, albeit on a more restricted platform. In the database world, developers are sometimes tempted to bypass the RDBMS, for example by storing everything in one big table with three columns labelled entity ID, key, and value. While this entity-attribute-value model allows the developer to break out from the structure imposed by an SQL database, it loses out on all the benefits, since all of the work that could be done efficiently by the RDBMS is forced onto the application instead. Queries become much more convoluted, the indexes and query optimizer can no longer work effectively, and data validity constraints are not enforced. Performance and maintainability can be extremely poor. A similar temptation exists for XML, where developers sometimes favor generic element names and use attributes to store meaningful information. For example, every element might be named item and have attributes type and value. This practice requires joins across multiple attributes in order to extract meaning. As a result, XPath expressions are more convoluted, evaluation is less efficient, and structural validation provides little benefit. Another example is the phenomenon of web desktops, where a whole desktop environment—often including a web browser—runs inside a browser (which itself typically runs within the desktop environment provided by the operating system). A desktop within a desktop can be unusually awkward for the user, and hence this is generally only done to run programs that cannot easily be deployed on end user systems, or by hiding the outer desktop away. The Specification Pattern creates logic objects that are combined with And() functions, which are difficult to organize into groups with Or() clauses. This is normally easier to accomplish with basic boolean conditional statements.  Effect  It is normal for software developers to create a library of custom functions that relate to their specific project. The inner-platform effect occurs when this library expands to include general purpose functions that duplicate functionality already available as part of the programming language or platform. Since each of these new functions will generally call a number of the original functions, they tend to be slower, and if poorly coded, less reliable as well. On the other hand, such functions are often created to present a simpler (and often more portable) abstraction layer on top of lower level services that either have an awkward interface, are too complex, non-portable or insufficiently portable, or simply a poor match for higher level application code.  Appropriate uses  An inner platform can be useful for portability and privilege separation reasons—in other words, so that the same application can run on a wide variety of outer platforms without affecting anything outside a sandbox managed by the inner platform. For example, Sun Microsystems designed the Java platform to meet both of these goals.

Collins Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopedia. (Foreword by The Rt Hon. The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs). Published in 1994. Pages 162 - 163. History =Origins of the clan= The Hannays are from the ancient princedom of Galloway. The name appears to have originally been spelt Ahannay but its origin is uncertain. It could derive from the Scottish Gaelic Ultimately Irish Gaelic O'Hannaidh or Ap Shenaeigh. =Wars of Scottish Independence= In 1296 Gilbert de Hannethe appears on the Ragman Rolls submitting to Edward I of England. This could be the same Gilbert who acquired the lands of Sorbie. The Hannays were suspicious of Robert the Bruce's ambitions and instead supported the claim of John Balliol. Balliol was descended from the Celtic Princes of Galloway through his mother, Lady Devorgilla. =15th & 16th centuries= Sorbie Tower, ancient seat of Clan Hannay. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the Hannays extended their influence over the surrounding area including the building of Sorbie Tower which remained the seat of the Clan Chief until the seventeenth century. =17th century= At the beginning of the 17th century the Clan Hannay was locked in a deadly feud with the Clan Murray of Broughton. It resulted in the Hannays being outlawed. The consequences of this were that many Hannays emigrated to Ulster, where the name is still found in large numbers in County Antrim, County Down and County Armagh. Patrick Hannay had a distinguished military career and was patronised by Queen Elizabeth of Bohemia, daughter of James VI of Scotland and sister of Charles I of England. After the death of Queen Anne who was the wife of James VI in 1619 Patrick Hannay composed two eulogies and in return had many published on his own death, one of which said: 'Go on in virtue, aftertimes will tell, none but Hannay could have done so well'. Possibly the best known Hannay was James Hannay, the Dean of St Giles' in Edinburgh who had the claim to fame of being the target of Jenny Geddes' stool. In an infamous incident in 1637 the Dean had begun to read the new liturgy when with a cry of \\"Thou false thief, dost thou say Mass at my lug?\\" was heard and a stool came flying from the congregation, thrown by an incensed Jenny Geddes. The incident began a full-scale riot which took the town guard to control. Sir Robert Hannay of Mochrum was created a Baronet of Nova Scotia In 1630. From the Sorbie roots the Hannays of Grennan, Knock, Garrie and Kingsmuir also evolved. The modern Clan Hannay In 1582, Alexander Hannay, a younger son of the chief, Hannay of Sorbie, purchased the lands of Kirkdale which were in the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright. His son was John Hannay of Kirkdalewho established the line which is today recognised by the Lord Lyon King of Arms as the chief of the name and arms of Hannay. A younger son of Hannay of Kirkdale was Alexander Hannay who was a professional soldier, administrator and adventurer, who amassed a substantial personal fortune in 18th Century India, rising to the rank of colonel. His elder brother was Sir Samuel Hannay of Kirkdale who succeeded to the title and estates of his kinsman, Sir Robert Hannay of Mochrum, Baront. The next Baronet was Sir Samuel Hannay who entered the service of the Habsburg Emperors and built himself a mansion on his family lands. It is this mansion which is said to have provided the inspiration for Walter Scott's novel, Guy Mannering. Sir Samuel died in 1841 and the estate passed to his sister, Mary, and from her to her nephew, William Ransford Hannay, from whom the present chief is descended.

The school was founded in April 1936 at 131 West 14th Street. Its founders and board of directors included members and former members of the John Reed Club such as William Gropper, as well as contributors to the New Masses and the Daily Worker, and notable artists such as Margaret Bourke-White and Louis Schanker. Harry Gottlieb was its first director. The school emphasized art that was not only technically excellent but also alive to the social and class realities of the day, and stressed socially relevant content. A statement from the school's brochure of 1936 reads, :\\"The American Artists School established [as] its fundamental premise...that the student must be developed as an independent thinker at the same time he is trained to be a competent artist. We believe that America contains infinite painting material, and that the student who learns to understand and appreciate it cannot but evolve into a socially constructive artist.\\" The school suffered from financial difficulties and closed in the spring of 1941; however, the significant role it played in integrating art and society in the thirties was recognized by both the liberal and radical press.  Personnel  Students at the school included Jacob Lawrence, Theodoros Stamos, Lucille Wallenrod, Ad Reinhardt, Elaine de Kooning, Jack McLarty, Harry Shoulberg, Milton Resnick, and Fay Kleinman. Teachers included the sculptor Joseph Konzal, the cartoonist Fred Ellis, Philip Evergood, Milton Hebald, Sol Wilson, Louis Schanker and Francis Criss.

Originally a folk-song type, it became a flamenco style in the 19th century. It is not normally used for dance, as it is generally interpreted with no regular rhythmic pattern, as a \\"cante libre\\". It has a very rich melody with virtuous flourishes and use of microtones. Its guitar accompaniment is normally played in open position first inversion giving E for the tonic, which can be transposed by using a capo.  History  =Origins= Malagueñas derive from local variety of the Fandangos, a type of dance that, with different regional variations and even different names, became very popular in great part of Spain in the 18th century. Although nowadays malagueñas are a typical instance of \\"cante libre\\", performed at libitum and normally not used for the dance, folkloric fandangos were originally sung and played at a fast speed, with a rhythmic pattern in , to accompany dance. Some of these primitive fandangos from Málaga, called Verdiales are still performed nowadays at folkloric gatherings by large non- professional groups called \\"Pandas\\", which use a high number of guitars, \\"bandurrias\\" (a sort of mandoline), violins, and tambourines. =Development= Towards the second half of the 19th century, some interpreters gave the first steps in transforming this folkloric songs into real flamenco. They slowed it down (although still keeping the eastern fandango rhythm pattern known as \\"abandolao\\"), they enriched the melody with flourishes and ornaments and reduced accompanying instruments to a single guitar. In this process, they were probably influenced by other flamenco styles, but modern research also suggests that the influence of Opera, Zarzuela and other classical music styles also played a part in this development. The oldest malagueña of this type that has been preserved to our days is probably the Jabera . This was first mentioned by writer Serafin Estébanez Calderón, probably in the 1840s. According to this contemporary witness, this type of malagueña would have been created by an artist known as La Jabera. This early malagueña type still preserved a rhythmic pattern as those of later artists like Juan Breva. Most of the malagueña types were created in the last decades of the 19th century. The third step in the evolution was the total loss of a rhythmic pattern. This development was brought forward by singers like Antonio Chacón, Enrique el Mellizo and guitarists like Ramón Montoya, none of whom had been born in the area of Málaga, so they had not grown in contact with the original folkloric fandangos. They were in a sense, creators of a completely new style, fashioned by professional or semi-professional artists. =Malagueña styles= Some of the traditional malagueña styles (melodic schemes) more frequently performed are listed below. Many though, have been omitted as they are rarely performed or are just variations of other main styles. 1\\\\. Juan Breva. He recorded three of his malagueña styles personally in the early 20th century. 2\\\\. Enrique el Mellizo. It is often said that he derived his malagueña from the preface to the catholic mass. After his influence, the rhythmic pattern of the malagueña guitar accompaniment was lost and it became a \\"cante libre\\". Among the interpreters of this style who helped to establish it we may mention El Niño de la Isla, Aurelio Sellé, Manolo Caracol and Pericón de Cádiz. Each of them has added personal touches to the Malagueña, so it is difficult to know which one resembles the original model most. 3\\\\. José Alberto \\"El Canario\\". He created one style of Malagueña. 4\\\\. Antonio Chacón. He was the most prolific creator of malagueñas and the styles he created are probably the most frequent in recordings. The number of the malagueñas he created varies, though, as some have been attributed to him only by tradition. Some of these styles can often be seen as simple variations. Most of these styles were already recorded by him between 1909 and 1928. 5\\\\. La Trini. Her legacy was preserved by singers like Sebastián el Pena. Antonio Chacón created a personal variation of one of her styles.  The guitar in the malagueña  Originally the guitar was, together with other instruments, already part of the accompaniment of folkloric fandango of Málaga. At that time its function was merely rhythmic and limited to the use of one technique, the strumming pattern called \\"abandolao\\". As malagueñas slowed down their tempo and professional guitarists came into place, short solos and ornaments were incorporated. The great revolution of the malagueña guitar playing came together with its transformation into a \\"cante libre\\": flamenco virtuosos like Ramón Montoya started introducing classical guitar techniques like arpeggio, scales, tremolo, and enriched it with a wider variety of chord positions. They also started introducing short guitar solos in between verses, called falsetas in the flamenco jargon, following the model of other flamenco songs. Malagueña is rarely performed as a guitar instrumental piece and very rarely danced. Musical analysis The singing develops on a major mode (tonic, subdominant, dominant), resolving in the corresponding Phrygian mode of the same scale. The Phrygian mode is used for the short interludes after of before verses. The usual progression is the typical of all fandangos: *First line of singing: G7, C Major *Second line: C Major, C7, F Major *Third line is just a repetition of the first *Fourth line: C Major, G7 *Fifth line: G7, C Major *Sixth line: C Major, C7, F Major, G Major, F Major, E Major To this typical progression other transition chords can be added. For example, D7 is often used in the transition to G Major. A minor often appears in guitar interludes (or even during the singing, as in the case of the Malagueña del Mellizo). These chords can also be transported by using a capo on the guitar, maintaining the same chord positions. Its melodies are normally lyric in style and very ornate. Malagueña has traditionally been favoured by mellow voices, but there are many exceptions to this rule. Quite often, flamenco singers, after singing several verses of malagueña in \\"cante libre\\" style, link directly with the more vivid styles of Fandangos abandolaos.

The village is under the control of Morocco. The Moroccan passport control stamp bears the name of Bir Gandouz, a nearby village. Morocco sees this frontier post as the southernmost barrier protecting the European Union. The area between the Moroccan frontier post and the Mauritanian frontier is seen by Morocco as a no man's land and by the Polisario as part of the Saharawi Republic. In January 2015, the Polisario established a military presence in La Güera on the seaside, but apparently did not yet start controlling passports of people transiting to Mauritania. Since February 2017, the Gendarmerie Nationale (الدرك الوطني) started to hoist flags and turn back Moroccan lorries showing the contour of Morocco including Western Sahara. The importance of Guerguerat to Morocco lies in two aspects: Moroccan exports of vegetables to Mauritania (especially to Nouadhibou) run through this border station and it is the only way for Moroccans to leave their country by land without a visa to another country. The importance of Guerguerat to the SADR lies in the fact that this is the only location where it can exert pressure on Morocco by isolating it from Mauritania.

After the failure of the first uprising of 1837, the Frères chasseurs organization was founded in 1838 by Robert Nelson, Cyrille-Hector- Octave Côté (the vice president), Edmond-Élisée Malhiot, Antoine Doré, Julien Gagnon, Louis-Guillaume Lévesque, François Mercure, François Lemaître, Célestin Beausoleil and David Rochon. In September, it was composed of at least 35 lodges. The Frères chasseurs attempted to invade Lower Canada from the United States to defeat the British army and its volunteers. On 22 February 1838, president Robert Nelson declared the independence of Lower Canada. Bishop Jean-Jacques Lartigue obtained information about the group and communicated it to John Colborne, who in turn used it to quell the Frères chasseurs. Members of the Frères chasseurs such as François-Marie-Thomas Chevalier de Lorimier were executed at the Pied-du-Courant Prison by the British authorities for their actions.

The team debuted in a preview included in the pages of two other Eclipse publications, The New DNAgents #9 and Miracleman #8, before debuting in its own book. For its initial eight issues, The New Wave was published bi- weekly as a 16-page book. Beginning with issue 9 through the end of the 13-issue run the book became a full-sized monthly.Faerber, Jay. \\"Under the Influence\\"; Dynamo 5: Sins of the Father #3 (August 2010); Page 26 Publication history The series was co-created and written by Mindy Newell. The initial art team included penciller Lee Weeks and inker Ty Templeton. Issue #6 featured fill-in artist Erik Larsen, before he rose to fame on Marvel Comics' Spider-Man. Issue #13 was drawn by Eric Shanower. The first five issues of the series depicted the team's origin, and is set on a space station owned by a corporation headed by a CEO with plans for world domination. During the course of the story, the extraterrestrial Tachyon is teleported onto the station, by scientist James Holmes, with whom Tachyon bonds. Dot, a spy with the power to shrink, sneaks aboard the station on a government mission. Circus acrobat Polestar stows away after a romantic interlude with a space shuttle pilot, while Avalon, Holmes' teenage witch daughter, and her boyfriend, the telekinetically powered Impulse, are brought there by the CEO to use as leverage against Holmes. Megabyte, one of the CEO's robot guards, switches sides and assists the others to foil the CEO's plot. After deciding to stay together as a team, issues 7 - 9 depicted the team traveling to the mystical realm of Avalon, during which the titular character's mother is revealed to be the Lady of the Lake of Arthurian legend. Subsequent single issues focused on The Volunteers, a group of superhumans with ties to Dot, Polestar's life in the circus, a \\"very special issue\\" about teen pregnancy, and Tachyon's sense of alienation. Following the cancellation of the regular book, The New Wave returned in a two-issue \\"micro-series\\" called The New Wave versus The Volunteers. The book was rendered in 3-D in addition to non-3D format. Following the bankruptcy of Eclipse Comics, its properties were purchased by Todd McFarlane, including the rights to the New Wave characters. The supporting character Heap has been re-imagined as an antagonist to McFarlane's character, Spawn. Cast * Avalon - teenage daughter of the legendary superhero \\"The Lady,\\" Avalon is a powerful witch. * Dot - a freelance spy with the power to shrink herself and, while small, fly and fire bio-electric blasts. * Impulse - Avalon's neighbor, he is telekinetic. * Megabyte - a robot programmed with the brain patterns of a physically disabled teenage boy. * Polestar - a circus acrobat, she carries a telescoping pole for hand-to-hand combat. * Tachyon - blue-skinned, blue-haired extra-dimensional being with superhuman strength and the power of flight. Supporting cast included James Holmes, Avalon's father and a scientist who was partially responsible for bringing Tachyon from his home dimension, and The Heap, a Golden Age character similar to Marvel's Man-Thing. Influence Writer Jay Faerber, who first discovered The New Wave after he began frequenting a comic book store called Gema Books as a high school freshman, has cited the book as a seminal influence on him and his writing, citing its experimental biweekly, 16-page format, its emphasis on character depth over physical combat, and the originality of the character's personalities and motivations.

Naming  According to Irish academic Paul Tempan, the \\"white peak\\" in the Irish language name derives from the abundance of quartzite rock in the summit of Benbaun. Tempan notes that Benbaun is the \\"Mont Blanc\\" of Connemara.  Geography  Benbaun is the highest mountain of the Twelve Bens range, which is situated in the Connemara National Park in west Galway. Benbaun lies at the centre of the range and is situated in the middle of a long east-west ridge that to the west includes the major Bens of Benfree () , Muckanaght () , and Bencullagh () , and the minor Ben of Maumonght () , and its subsidiary peak of Maumonght SW Top . To the east is a long flat 3.5-kilometre ridge at the end of which lies the minor Ben of Knockpasheemore () to the far eastern end. A deep col to the south, known as Maumina (), connects Benbaun to the summit of Bencollaghduff , and to the southern Bens of the \\"Glencoaghan Horseshoe\\" which forms around the Glencoaghan River. Another deep col to the north, known as Maumnascalpa connects Benfree and Muckanaght to the northern Ben of Benbrack , which sits on its own small massif with the subsidiary peaks of Knockbrack , and another peak named Benbaun, at . Benbaun sits at the apex of two major glaciated U-shaped valleys. To the east is the Gleninagh Valley (), from which the Gleninagh river flows. This valley is bounded by two large long north-easterly rocky spurs, and the southern spur contains \\"Carrot Ridge\\" (), an important area for rock-climbing in the Bens, with climbs varying from Diff (D) to Very Severe (VS) and ranging from 150 to 320 metres in length. To the south-west is the large valley of the Owenglin river which is bounded by several major Bens on each of its sides. Benbaun's prominence of qualifies it as a P600, and a Marilyn, and it also ranks it as the 41st-highest mountain in Ireland on the MountainViews Online Database, 100 Highest Irish Mountains, where the minimum prominence threshold is 100 metres.  Hill walking  The most straightforward route to climb Benbaun either via the pass of Maumina by walking up the Gleninagh valley, or by staying on higher ground by first summiting Knockpasheemore and then traversing the 3.5-kilometre ridge to the summit; both routes total over 9-kilometres and 4–5 hours of walking. Because Benbaun lies off the very popular 16–kilometre 8–9 hour Glencoaghan Horseshoe, it gets fewer visits despite being the tallest Ben in the range. However, Benbaun sits close to the apex of three other well-regarded \\"horseshoe climbs\\" of equivalent difficulty in the Bens: Gallery File:Bencullagh, Muckanaght & Benbaun from Bencollaghduff.jpg(l-to-r) Bencullagh, Muckanaght and Benbaun, viewed from Bencollaghduff File:Intersection of Benbaun, Bencollaghduff and Benbreen (from Muckanaght).jpgIntersection of Benbaun, Bencollaghduff and Benbreen, viewed from Muckanaght File:Derryclare, Bencorr & Benbaun from lower south ridge of Letterbreckaun.jpg(l-to-r) Derryclare, Bencorr, and Benbaun, viewed from Letterbreckaun File:Benbaun.JPGBenbaun (left) and the long easterly ridge to Knockpasheemore (right) File:Benfree & Benbaun from Muckanaght.jpgBenfree (left) and Benbaun (right), viewed from summit of Muckanaght Bibliography  See also *Twelve Bens *Mweelrea, major range in Killary Harbour *Maumturks, major range in Connemara *List of Irish counties by highest point *Lists of mountains in Ireland *Lists of mountains and hills in the British Isles *List of P600 mountains in the British Isles *List of Marilyns in the British Isles *List of Hewitt mountains in England, Wales and Ireland References External links *MountainViews: The Irish Mountain Website, Benbaun *MountainViews: Irish Online Mountain Database *The Database of British and Irish Hills , the largest database of British Isles mountains (\\"DoBIH\\") *Hill Bagging UK & Ireland, the searchable interface for the DoBIH Category:Marilyns of Ireland Category:Hewitts of Ireland Category:Mountains and hills of County Galway Category:Highest points of Irish counties Category:Mountains under 1000 metres ","title":"Benbaun"},{"id":"7727405","text":"Baselios Thomas I (born 22 July 1929) is a Syriac Orthodox Catholicos of India (Maphrian) and regional head of the Jacobite Syrian Christian Church, the Syriac Orthodox Church in India. He was enthroned on 26 July 2002 by Syriac Orthodox Patriarch Ignatius Zakka I Iwas, Patriarch of Antioch and All the East in a ceremony held in Damascus, Syria. The office of the Maphrian had been vacant from 1996 (date of death of Baselios Paulose II Catholicos to 2002. Childhood Catholicos Baselios Thomas I was born in the Cheruvillil family of Vadayambadi in Puthencruz to Mathai and Kunjamma on 22 July 1929. Early part of the life of Mor Baselios Thomas I was of sufferings. Though he belonged to an aristocratic family, by the time he was born the family had seen bad days. As a child he had frequent bouts of illness which affected his education. His mother used to take the young boy frequently to the nearby Malekurishu Dayro where the relics of late Patriarch St. Elias III had been interred. Priesthood His priestly formation was under the guidance of Mor Philoxenos Paulos (later Catholicos Baselios Paulose II) who ordained him korooyo in 1952 and mshamshono at Kadamatom Church in 1957. In 1958, he was ordained priest by Mor Yulius Elias Qoro in September 1958 at Manjinikkara. He is the 43rd priest from the Cheruvillil family. C.M. Thomas served as the vicar of St. Peter's church, Puthencruz from 1959 while also serving churches at Mookkannur, Vellathooval, Keezhumuri, St. Peter's & St. Paul's Orthodox Church - Fort Cochin, Valamboor and later at Calcutta and Trichur. In 1960, while vicar at Puthenkurish, he played a key role in rebuilding the church; parishioners fondly recollect their priest working with them during the reconstruction. From 1967-74, he served as the organizing secretary of Kolenchery Medical Mission Hospital. In 1970, he served as the organizer for the North Indian mission at Bhilai and in 1974 as the secretary of the Pourasthaya Suvishesha Samajam. Since his ordination as korooyo, at age 24, Thomas was active in preaching the gospel in the remote parts of Kerala. From his vision and zeal to spread the gospel arose the St. Paul's prayer fellowship and the Puthencruz gospel convention which is held annually from 26–31 December. Episcopacy Baselios Thomas I, Catholicos of India, during Hasha at St. George Jacobite Church Al-Ain, Abu Dhabi - United Arab Emirates Fr C.M. Thomas was elected to the episcopate by the Malankara Jacobite Syrian Christian Association meeting at Karingachira St. George Church in January 1974 and was consecrated, under the name of Mor Dionysius, metropolitan of the Angamali Diocese, the largest Syriac Orthodox diocese, by Mor Ignatius Ya\`qub III on 24 February 1974 at Damascus along with Geevarghese Mor Gregorios (Perumpally Thirumeni). The two metropolitans played a significant role in leading the church during the crisis of the seventies. After the passing away of Mor Gregorios Geevarghese in February 1999, Mor Dionysius assumed the Presidency of the Malankara Syrian Orthodox Church Synod and was elected Catholicos-Designate at the delegates meeting held at Puthenkurishu on 27 December 2000 and again by the Jacobite Syrian Christian Association constituted under the newly formed constitution on 6 June 2002.

As the head of the Jacobite Church in India the Catholicos presides over the Holy Episcopal Synod of Malankara Church which includes all the Metropolitans of the Syrian Orthodox Church in India. He was also the Metropolitan Trustee of the Jacobite Syrian Christian Church. In 2019, he has relinquished his administrative duties and resigned as \\"Metropolitan Trustee\\" position and will remain as Catholicos of India. Past 90 years, the Catholicos had offered to step down from both positions, but Patriarch of the Universal Syriac Orthodox Church Ignatius Aphrem II had asked him to continue as Catholicos. In August 2019, Joseph Mar Gregorios, Metropolitan of the Kochi diocese of the Jacobite Syrian Orthodox Church, was unanimously elected metropolitan trustee of the Church at a meeting of the Jacobite Syrian Christian Association at the Patriarchal Centre, Puthencruz near Kochi, which is also the headquarters of the Syriac Orthodox Church in India. There were \\"no other candidates\\" for the position. The Catholicate office of Mor Baselios Thomas I functions and resides at the \\"Mor Ignatius Zakka I Centre\\" also known as Patriarchal Centre. Intensifying the protest against the forcible takeover of the many Jacobite-run churches, the Jacobite faction of the Malankara Church headed by Catholicos Baselios Thomas I and metropolitan trustee Joseph Mar Gregorios has launched a sit-in satyagraha in Kochi and further protests. Protests centered around St. Mary's Church, Piravom and spreading to St. Thomas Church (Marthoma Cheriyapally) in Kothamangalam imminently under threat for transfer to the Orthodox factions affiliated with the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church as per the Supreme Court verdict of July 2017.

Hosted by author Truman Capote, the ball was in honor of The Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham. Impulse Truman Capote decided in June 1966 to throw a lavish party. He was at the height of his popularity as an author and as a public figure following the publication of his non-fiction novel, In Cold Blood, earlier that year. For the first time Capote had the financial resources to host a party he deemed worthy of the friends he had cultivated in high society. According to Capote's friend, the writer and editor Leo Lerman, Capote had declared in 1942 on a journey to the writer's colony Yaddo that when he, Capote, became rich and famous he would throw a party for his rich and famous friends. Capote always discounted the story but through constant repetition it became part of the ball's legend.Davis, p. 16 Capote's friend, author Dominick Dunne, had given a black and white ball in 1964 for his tenth wedding anniversary. Capote attended with Alvin Dewey and others he had met while researching In Cold Blood.Dunne, quoted in Plimpton, p. 249 Capote was also inspired by the \\"Ascot scene\\" from the film My Fair Lady in which the women were all dressed in black and white.Clarke, p. 370 Planning After deciding to throw the party, Capote had to select a guest of honor. Throwing the party for himself would have been viewed by his society friends as vulgar. Rather than selecting from amongst his stable of beautiful society women he called his \\"swans\\", Capote chose The Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham. \\"Truman called me up that summer and said, 'I think you need cheering up. And I'm going to give you a ball.'...I was...sort of baffled....I felt a little bit like Truman was going to give the ball anyway and that I was part of the props.\\"Graham, quoted in Plimpton, p. 248 For his venue, Capote chose the Grand Ballroom of the Plaza Hotel in New York City. Capote had long held a deep affection for the Plaza, even setting the opening scene of his attempted first novel, Summer Crossing, in a Plaza dining room.Davis, p. 79 Capote enlisted Evie Backer, who had decorated his apartment at United Nations Plaza, for the event's decor. Initially Capote planned to cover the ballroom's white and gold walls with heavy red drapes but Backer and Capote's friend Babe Paley convinced him to abandon this idea.Davis, p. 157 Instead he brought in the color with red tablecloths. Rather than flowers, Capote had the tables adorned with gold candelabra wound with smilax and bearing white tapers. The night's menu, to be served at midnight, consisted of scrambled eggs, sausages, biscuits, pastries, spaghetti and meatballs and chicken hash, a specialty of the Plaza and one of Capote's favorite dishes. To drink Capote laid in 450 bottles of Taittinger champagne. Capote spent a total of $16,000 on the ball.Gathje, p. 133 Guest list Capote purchased a black-and-white composition book and spent most of July sitting by his friend Eleanor Friede's pool compiling his initial guest list.Clarke, p. 369 Capote carried the book with him everywhere he went for the next three months, constantly adding and deleting names.Davis, p. 124 Among the guests were Katharine Graham, Lady Bird Johnson, Andy Warhol, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Gloria Vanderbilt, Babe Paley, Billy Baldwin, Harry Belafonte, the Maharani of Jaipur, Frank Sinatra, Candice Bergen, Gloria Guinness, Lee Radziwill, Brooke Astor, Mia Farrow, and the Italian Princess Luciana Pignatelli (wearing a 60-carat diamond borrowed from Harry Winston). November 28, 1966 Before the ball, many of the guests attended one of sixteen small private dinner parties that Capote's friends had been drafted to host. After the ball The Black and White Ball was credited with starting an immediate upsurge in masquerade and costume parties. It has been described as \\"a pinnacle of New York's social history\\".Nowell, p. 29 Six days after the ball, on the December 4 episode of the television panel show What's My Line?, panelist Arlene Francis wore the mask she had worn at the party, transformed into a blindfold. The wearing of blindfolds during the show's special Mystery Guest segment was customary on the part of the panel. Re-creations Princess Yasmin Aga Khan hosted a Black and White Ball in 1991, commemorating the 25th anniversary of the original. The ball, held in a tent outside Tavern on the Green, was a charity event that raised $1.4 million for the Alzheimer's Association. In anticipation of selling the contents of the Plaza Hotel, Christie's Auction House recreated the Black and White Ball in 2006 at Rockefeller Center. The event followed Capote's dress code, schedule and menu exactly and the Peter Duchin Orchestra, which had played the original, played the recreation. TV chef Ina Garten recreated a scaled-down version of the event for a themed dinner party on her daytime cookery show Barefoot Contessa. She served chicken hash followed by French toast and truffles for dessert, in keeping with the black and white theme of Capote's party. Notes References * Clarke, Gerald (1988). Capote: A Biography.
