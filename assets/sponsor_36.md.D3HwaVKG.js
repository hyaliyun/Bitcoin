Since the arrival of European settlers Cuba has suffered from deforestation as a result of more and more forest area being taken over by humans to use them for agricultural production. Also cutting down trees for firewood and to obtain materials for building has contributed to the loss of forests and extinction of some species. Environmental awareness has since increased in Cuba and in the late 1990s and in the 2000s Cuban government has started new programs to protect the environment and to increase forest coverage. Satellite Image of Cuba Environmental causes Soil degradation and desertification are the main causes of environmental problems. In addition, Cuba has other issues such as deforestation, water pollution, the loss of biodiversity, and air pollution. Soil degradation and desertification are produced by the lack of good farming techniques and natural disasters. Deforestation is killing the forest, for example, cutting down trees. Water pollution is the contamination of water caused by different industries.United Nations Environment Program. Conference on Water, Report of Cuba. Volunteer Hydraulic. 2001; 13(39): 47‚Äì59. Also, the loss of biological diversity is caused by the extinction of different animal species. Lastly, air pollution largely caused by the increasing number of ‚Äúold‚Äù cars that fill Cuba‚Äôs streets. Matanzas Environmental solutions One of the main solutions used by Cuba to regulate the environmental problem was creating an Environmental Educational program. The reason why Environmental Education program helped with the regulation of environmental problem was because Cuban people became more educated on observing the environment. For example, the community was contributing to neighborhood clean-up techniques. The government created new methods to prevent the destruction of the environment, such as organic farming versus using chemicals to treat the lands. Designated areas were built for garbage and industrial waste instead of dumping them into the Havana Bay.

Born in Brooklyn, New York in 1911, he obtained a bachelor's degree from the City College of New York (CCNY) in 1931 and a Ph.D. at Cornell University in 1937, where he worked with the Nobel laureate James B. Sumner. In 1936 he published a paper showing that the photosynthetic flagellate Euglena had a nutritional requirement for a substance extracted from animal tissue. At that time this was considered to be improbable and the paper was rejected by several American journals before eventually being published in Europe.Hutner, S.H. 1936. The nutritional requirements of two species of Euglena. Arch. Protistenkunde 88, 93-106. Years later it was discovered that the required factor was vitamin B12, or cyanocobalamin. He developed a nutritional assay method for vitamin B12 using Euglena that was used for many years in hospitals to test for B12 levels in blood, eventually being replaced by other methods Hutner, S.H. Provasoli, L., Stokstad, E.L., Haffman, C.E., Bell, M., Franklin, A.L., Jukes, T.H. 1949. Assay of anti-pernicious anemia factor with Euglena. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 70, 118-120. After graduating from Cornell, he joined an independent research laboratory, the Haskins Laboratories founded by the physicist Franklin Cooper and the entomologist and geneticist Caryl Haskins. Initially this was based in Massachusetts, near M.I.T., but then it moved to a building on East 43rd Street in New York City, where Hutner was joined by a newly arrived Italian scientist, Luigi Provasoli, who had spent time in the laboratory of Andre Lwoff in Paris. In New York, during the 1940s through the 1960s, Haskins Labs became known for studies of protistan nutrition and the development of culture media and culture assay methods. Hutner was one of the first to appreciate the importance of organic complexing agents in trace metal nutrition of cells . This had significant implications for the development of culture media and also in the understanding of microbial ecology.Hutner, S.H., Provasoli, L. Schatz, A. Haskins C.P. 1950 Some approaches to the study of the role of metals in the metabolism of microorganisms. Proc. Am. Phil Soc. 94, 152-170 With his colleague Luigi Provasoli he showed that photosynthetic organisms could be ‚Äòbleached‚Äô by the antibiotic streptomycin ‚Äì an early clue of the endosymbiotic hypothesis about the origin of chloroplasts from a prokaryotic ancestor.Provasoli, L., Hutner, S.H., Schatz, A. 1948. Streptomycin-induced chlorophyll-less races of Euglena. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 69, 279-282 At 43rd St., Hutner became known for nurturing young students at a time when this was not a typical pattern, and the lab served as an incubator for many talented high school and undergraduate students. Some went on to become productive scientists, including the two Nobel laureates, Joshua Lederberg and David Baltimore. While full-time at the lab, Hutner also spent several years on the faculties of Columbia University and Fordham University in this period. He also edited, with Lwoff (and later in a second edition with Michael Levandowsky), a multivolume compendium, the Biochemistry and Physiology of Protozoa, that was for many years a standard reference;Lwoff, A. (Ed.) 1951. Biochemistry and Physiology of Protozoa, 1st Ed., Vol. 1. Academic Press, N.Y.Hutner,S.H., Lwoff, A. (Eds.) 1955. Biochemistry and Physiology of Protozoa, 1st Ed., Vol. 2.

Biochemistry and Physiology of Protozoa, 2nd Ed., Vols. 1-4. Academic Press, N.Y. In 1970 the lab was required to leave its quarters at 43rd St. Cooper and Provasoli went to Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, but Hutner preferred to remain in New York and moved his part of the lab to Pace University in Lower Manhattan, where he became a professor. Cooper developed the New Haven lab into an institute for the study of speech, language, and reading. It remains today an independently chartered nonprofit organization under the name of Haskins Laboratories, while maintaining close ties with Yale University and University of Connecticut. In New York, Hutner's component, focused on microbiological research, has become a department of Pace University and is also named Haskins Laboratories, but the two identically named laboratories no longer have formal ties. At Pace the lab became a center for metabolic studies of protistan parasites, as well as studies of behavioral ecology and sensory physiology of free-living protists. Under the leadership of Hutner's student, Cyrus Bacchi, the former led to development of the antiparasitic drug eflornithine (alpha- difluoromethylornithine),Bacchi, C.J., Nathan, H.C., Hutner, S.H., McCann, P.P., Sjoerdsma, A. 1980. Polyamine metabolism: a potential chemotherapeutic target in trypanosomes. Science 210, 323-334 widely used today against African sleeping sickness (trypanosomiasis). Work on antiparasitic drugs continues today under the direction of Nigel Yarlett. Hutner was a founding member of the Society of Protozoologists (now the International Society of Protistologists) serving as its president in 1961-2, and was for many years on the editorial board of the Journal of Protozoology (now the Journal of Eukaryotic Microbiology). In 1977 an issue of the journal was dedicated to him.Levandowsky, M. (Ed.) 1977. A collection of papers dedicated to Seymour H. Hutner. J.

It is threatened by the loss of the wetland habitat in which it grows.Oxypolis canbyi. The Nature Conservancy. It is a federally listed endangered species of the United States. Description This rhizomatous perennial herb grows up to 1.2 meters in maximum height. The narrow, hollow leaves resemble quills. The inflorescence is a compound umbel of many small flowers with white petals and red-tinged green sepals.USFWS. Oxypolis canbyi Five-year Review. September 2010. Blooming occurs in August and September,Oxypolis canbyi. Center for Plant Conservation. sometimes lasting until October. The plant has a scent similar to dill. The stems extend along the ground as stolons, rooting at nodes. It can then produce a colony of many erect stems all belonging to one plant, spreading vegetatively. Ecology The larva of the black swallowtail butterfly (Papilio polyxenes asterius) feed on the plant. They eat the stem, separating the inflorescence and sometimes preventing sexual reproduction; however, the plant more often reproduces asexually via cloning. Conservation status There are about 53 documented populations of this plant, mainly in South Carolina and Georgia. There is one population each in Maryland and North Carolina. The species has been extirpated from Delaware. Most populations are small. The plant grows in a variety of wetland habitat types, including bays, sloughs, wet savannas, and ponds. Other plants in the habitat may include Ilex myrtifolia, Nyssa biflora, Taxodium ascendens, Pinus serotina, Stillingia aquatica, Rhynchospora tracyi, Rhynchospora inundata, Manisuris rugosa, Rhexia aristosa, Polygala cymosa, Pluchea rosea, Lobelia boykinii, and Hypericum denticulatum. The main threat to this rare species is the destruction and alteration of its habitat. Wetlands across the coastal plain of the southeastern US have been dredged, drained, and used for agriculture, including silviculture operations. This process has altered the water regime, both on the surface and in the groundwater table, which in turn has affected the flora. In some cases, shrubs have invaded areas where they were naturally excluded in the pristine habitat. The dropwort grows best in open, unshaded areas that have no canopy. Conservation activities have included the removal of shrubs and trees, including sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua) and persimmon (Diospyros virginiana), that had been encroaching on the wetland and shading out the herb layer.

The purpose of the work was to create a folk art project for the 21st century that demonstrated the ritual nature, skill and culture of Huichol beadwork. Beadwork is a traditional Huichol craft that began by decorating bull horns, then gourds, masks, and jaguar head figures. Originally the craft was done with seeds, but is today done with plastic and glass beads. The craft is still evolving and the beadwork can be found on various modern materials, such as glass, stone, ceramics and metal. Traditionally, the beads are affixed with a kind of wax that comes from Campeche. The work View of a decorated fender The work was created by eight artisans from two Huichol families, the Bautistas from state of Jalisco and the Ortiz from the state of Nayarit. The artisans worked under the direction of Francisco Bautista to decorate the chassis and interior of the vehicle in an exclusive design. For the artisans, the car was not only a source of employment, but also a way to promote their art and craftsmanship. The artisans clocked 4,760 hours using 2,277,000 beads that weighed ninety kilograms and fastened with sixteen kilograms of resin that can withstand 200¬∞ Celsius. The project at the Hospicio Caba√±as in Guadalajara lasted over seven months and began in May 2010. At a later stage, work continued at the Centro Estatal para las Culturas Populares e Ind√≠genas in Nayarit. The final touches were placed on the car at the Museo de Arte Popular in Mexico City.

She is played by American actress Maggie Q. The series follows Nikita's efforts in bringing down Division, a secret agency that trained her into becoming an agent and assassin, but betrayed her by killing Daniel Monroe, a civilian she fell in love with. She recruits Alexandra Udinov (Lyndsy Fonseca) into helping her destroy Division from within. Q was in talks to appear on the series as the title character in February 2010, and it was her first time working on a television series. She was chosen for the role because series creator Craig Silverstein believed Q had qualities that would fit the character: \\"beautiful, who could fight,\\" and be believable with a gun. The actress meanwhile was intrigued by the original Nikita film and Luc Besson's creation of a flawed female character. The series also deals with Nikita and Michael's romantic tension, then relationship, described by the fans as \\"Mikita.\\" The character and Q's portrayal garnered mostly positive reactions from critics. Q performs her own stunts of the series. Character arc Orphaned as a teenager, Nikita turns to drugs and crime. She comes across a halfway house run by Carla Bennett (Erica Gimpel) and temporarily gets clean until she relapses and murders a police officer. Nikita is arrested and sentenced to death. She attracts the attention of Division, a secret American agency that recruits young criminals by faking their deaths and then train them to become assassins. For three years, Nikita was trained under Michael (Shane West), and committed assassinations. After she begins a relationship with civilian Daniel Monroe (Sebastien Roberts), Nikita learns that Division has become corrupt under the leadership of Percy (Xander Berkeley). In one mission, Nikita is part of a team to assassinate a family of Russian oligarchs; the Udinov family. Nikita defies Division by saving the life of the daughter, Alexandra. After Division kills Daniel as it is against their policy for agents have relationships, she becomes a rogue agent intent on stopping Division, tracks down Alexandra (Lyndsy Fonseca), who had since become a drug addict and sex slave, and saves and trains her. Nikita arranges Alex to be arrested for murdering a man Division was targeting. Inside, Alex helps Nikita stop Division's illegal missions. During the first season, Nikita gains some allies to aid in her fight against Division, including Owen Elliot (Devon Sawa), a guardian to one of Division's several black boxes; hard drives contain files of Division's missions, until Percy tried to have him killed, CIA analyst Ryan Fletcher (Noah Bean) who was investigating black operations invisible to the United States government, and eventually her trainer Michael, after he learns Percy was responsible for the deaths of his wife and daughter. The two would be in a relationship for the rest of the series' run. By the first-season finale, Alex learns that Nikita killed her father and leaves her to become a free agent for Amanda (Melinda Clarke), Division's psychologist who overthrew Percy to lead Division with the help of Oversight, a group of American politicians who ensure that Division's existence remains secret from the public (Alex would later return to fight alongside with Nikita again midway through season two). Michael is discovered to be working with Nikita and the two end up on the run together with a black box. In the second season, Nikita and Michael team up with Seymour Birkhoff (Aaron Stanford), a Division computer programmer who left the agency to avoid Amanda. In \\"Looking Glass\\", Nikita learns that during an operation, Michael impregnated his asset, Cassandra Ovechkin (Helena Mattsson) and eventually tells him he has a son. The couple's relationship faces some tension due to that development, but they appear to reconcile after Michael decides to put Cassandra and his son Max (who calls her \\"The Gun Lady\\") behind him. In the meantime, Nikita learns about the existence of Oversight, and reunites with Carla Bennett, who is revealed to be one of the founders of Division, until her death. \\"Wrath\\" explores Nikita's dark side when she is captured and tortured by Nicholas Brandt, an arms dealer Nikita tortured during her days in Division. Nikita confesses to Michael that \\"there is evil\\" in her, but Michael assures her it is only a part of her. After the two are rescued, the ordeal brings Michael and Nikita closer. The two eventually sneak into Division and kill Percy after he has regained control of it. In the third season, Ryan takes charge of Division to clean up its own mess by recalling all the agents at which point President Kathleen Spencer (Michelle Nolden) will grant the agents freedom (as all were recruited against their will). However, Nikita later learns the President will have Division terminated should they fail. Nikita and others work to find rogue agents who refused the recall order, nicknamed the \\"Dirty Thirty\\", until her efforts are focused on Amanda, who is also on the run and later working with a company nicknamed \\"The Shop\\", who developed sophisticated technologies, some of which was used by Division. Michael and Nikita become engaged, but their relationship faces further tension after Nikita cuts off his right hand to save his life. An advanced prosthetic is eventually discovered, but it is later revealed to have been laced with nano-cells that would kill Michael unless Nikita assassinates Spencer. When Michael lies to her that a cure has been found, Nikita stands down. However Spencer shoots herself in the head (she is later revealed to be a double by The Shop; the real Spencer was captured and imprisoned). Framed for her death, Nikita becomes that most wanted person in the United States. She goes on the run, but leaves Michael behind. Characterization =Creation and casting= Maggie Q plays the series' eponymous character. The CW was looking to create a female-driven action series. Creator Craig Silverstein discussed with Warner Bros. about the previous incarnations of Nikita (the original 1990 film, and La Femme Nikita) and wished to make the current television series look fresh. Silverstein wanted to follow Nikita after she left the agency, as that chapter was yet to be told in the previous incarnations. He also believed it would have done the original story justice. Also, he wanted to include a highlight of Nikita's original story in the pilot to earn the title, and then move on from there. Silverstein described Nikita's transition in a Collider interview; \\"It's a dark fairytale. This girl is taken from one life, her identity is erased, she's put in another life and she's transformed. It's like Alice in Wonderland. She's told, \\"Eat this, drink that, steal this, kill that,\\" and she's not told why. And, she begins to find her own identity through that. It's just a great story.\\" On February 2010 it was announced that Maggie Q was in talks to play the title character of Nikita. Q's casting would mark the highest-profile series role for an Asian actress on a broadcast drama series. Q was drawn to the series because she was intrigued by the original film and Luc Besson's creation of an incredibly flawed female. According to the actress the process of her casting took about four to five days. In describing Q's casting, Silverstein stated; Appearing on Nikita would be Q's first television role. During an interview with IGN, Q explained that she had not been on television before \\"not because I didn't want to. I just never thought about it,\\" adding \\"When this came up, everything just felt right. I knew McG and when Wonderland came on he was like, 'This is you, we're not doing this without you.' and I went 'That's very sweet!' So it felt right.\\" =Development= Because the CW is a fashion-orientated network, there were times Nikita had to be dressed in a certain way to get her noticed by her targets. Q liked the idea, but at the same time wanted Nikita's dress sense to be \\"toned down a bit\\" because she is an assassin. In one scene in particular Q had to wear a red bikini in the pilot, which \\"mortified\\" her. She added \\"that red bikini was the bane of my existence. You're not going to see me in a bikini again, that's for sure. [...] I was like, 'Danny, can you put me in a one-piece?,' and he gave me that red bikini. I was like, 'That's not a one-piece. That's a two-piece with a string.'\\" However, Q did not have to cover her tattoos like she had to in the films, as it was in keeping with who the character is; a hardcore, street kid. Q performs her own stunts in the series. The actress liked to have her character \\"be able to do her own thing,\\" as it is an action series where females play lead roles; during her film career, she noted \\"but in movies, alongside big action men, we've always got to take a step back and let the men shine. And in this, it's about the women who know what they're doing.\\" At some point Q set up a three-week long training period for the rest of the cast to make their fight scenes in the series believable; she had her partner, an action director, bring his stunt team to train them. In filming the stunts she was already used to working in an environment where filming in television would be faster than in American films, because of her time starring in films in Asia, which usually took two to six weeks. One of the more prominent aspects of Nikita's character development since the beginning of the series is her relationship with Michael, and has been dubbed by fans as \\"Mikita\\". Unlike other works on film and television, Silverstein did not play the traditional \\"Will They/Won't They?\\" game between the two characters. Co-star Shane West stated \\"It's not hard to bring Michael and Nikita together,\\" but it is \\"really hard to keep them apart...We're barely into the season yet, so why not keep teasing?\\" When the first season started airing, West also expected that their romance would come, citing Michael and Nikita's past relationship while she was working with Division. Now that the two are together by the end of the first season, in the second season Silverstein wanted something to happen to get in their way, saying that no new tension would make the relationship boring, adding \\"I don't think you can just have them happy and in love, kicking ass together forever.\\" Reception Nikita and Maggie Q's portrayal of the character was met with generally positive reactions from television critics. Nikita was included in TV Guides lists of \\"TV's Sexiest Crime Fighters\\" and \\"TV's Toughest Ladies\\". Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times felt that Q was suited for the role, stating \\"she has a solemn, exotic beauty and hauteur that echo the heroine's self-possession and cool relentlessness,\\" adding \\"Nikita is noticeably more hard-boiled and less girlish than the undercover agent played by Jennifer Garner on Alias, or the C.I.A. rookie that Piper Perabo plays on Covert Affairs.\\" Troy Patterson of Slate felt that \\"Ms. Q's Nikita is only half so crush-worthy as Bionic Woman's Jaime Sommers or Dollhouse's what's-her-name, but her predicament is no less tasty.\\" Robert Bianco of USA Today believed Q's performance was \\"a fairly sizable incentive\\" to watch the show, adding she \\"combines stunt-fighting chops and lithe beauty with an unusual-for-the-genre air of somber intelligence. Her Nikita is not above cracking a joke, but it's clear from Q's eyes and bearing that she has suffered at the hands of evil men, and she's not going to take it anymore.\\" Alan Sepinwall of HitFix believed that Q \\"carries herself in a way that makes it believable she could be a hard-core killer, and she has the requisite dramatic chops and charisma for the part.\\" Maureen Ryan of AOL TV said \\"Maggie Q, has real charisma and presence; she invests Nikita's drive to bring down the secretive Division with potent energy. You have to believe that Nikita would devote her life to wreaking vengeance on the people she views as her former captors, and you also have to buy her as a butt-kicking, gun-toting action heroine who also looks great in a cocktail gown. Maggie Q makes all those things look easy.\\" Some other critics however, did not react so warmly towards Q's Nikita. Chris Conaton of PopMatters felt that Q \\"seems to be a good choice for the title role,\\" but noted that the pilot did not call attention to the character's background. That said Conaton stated \\"it's still something of a novelty to build a TV series around an Asian American lead‚Äîthough plenty of recent ensemble and reality TV shows have featured prominent cast members of Asian descent.\\" Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe felt that Q was \\"too much of a sad sack,\\" adding \\"Q doesn't seem able to layer any other emotions over her cold resolve,\\" and compares the character to \\"a little bit like [Saturday Night Live character] Debbie Downer.\\" Mary McNamara of The Los Angeles Times believed that while Nikita \\"provides some sizzle,\\" her emotions \\"run that famous distance from A to B, as do virtually [every other character].\\" Before the show started airing, Q posed for several billboard posters. However, they were met with some controversy for being revealing, and several locations across the United States, including in areas of Chicago, Los Angeles and New York, refused to allow them to be put up, as they were located near churches and schools. Rick Haskins, the marketing executive for the CW, stated \\"we've been down this road a few times with some of our campaigns.\\" References Category:Nikita (TV series) Category:Fictional Asian-American people Category:Fictional Vietnamese people Category:Fictional female assassins Category:Fictional mercenaries Category:Television characters introduced in 2010 Category:Fictional career criminals Category:Fictional secret agents and spies Category:Fictional women soldiers and warriors Category:Action television characters Category:Female characters in television ","title":"Nikita Mears"},{"id":"32088065","text":"The Shooting Star State Trail is a multi-use recreational trail in southeastern Minnesota, USA.

Biography Weems was born in Tennessee, the son of Joseph Burch and May Elizabeth Rye Weems. When he was a child, he and his six brothers and one sister were orphaned. He received an appointment to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis in 1908. At the Academy, he excelled at various sports, and was an All-American center on the Navy football team. (Later, he was selected for the 1920 U.S. Olympic wrestling team; however, there is no record of him actually competing at the Games.) He graduated in the class of 1912 and was commissioned an ensign. He specialized in navigation and taught at the Academy. In 1915, he married Margaret Thackray. In 1927, Weems was sent to the Aircraft Squadron Battle Fleet, before being assigned to the tanker USS Cuyama as its executive officer from 1928 to 1930. He retired for the first time in 1933 with the rank of lieutenant commander. Weems returned to active service in 1942, serving in World War II as a convoy commander, for which he was awarded a Bronze Star. He was promoted to captain in 1945 and retired the following year. With the dawn of the space age, he was called upon to teach space navigation at the Naval Academy from 1961 to 1962. The Weems had two sons and a daughter, Margaret. Both sons predeceased him. Major Philip van Horn Weems, Jr. was killed in the southwest Pacific in 1943, while Lieutenant Commander George Thackray \\"Bee\\" Weems died while testing an airplane in 1951. Philip Van Horn Weems died on June 2, 1979, at the age of ninety. Navigational contributions Weems and his wife established the Weems School of Navigation in 1927. After Charles Lindbergh completed his celebrated solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean, the Navy assigned Weems to teach him celestial navigation for a month in 1928. Fred Noonan, Amelia Earhart's navigator on her last flight, considered him his mentor. After his first retirement, Weems wrote several books; Air Navigation (1931) was particularly well received, and was awarded a gold medal by the Aero Club of France. In 1935, he patented the Mark II Plotter. Another invention was the Second Setting Watch - by adding a rotating 60-seconds bezel which could be locked in place, Weems created a simple way of allowing troops to align their watches' seconds hands with each other and thus co-ordinate separate military actions to the second. In old movies, when an officer tells his men \\"synchronise your watches\\", they are turning their Weems bezels. But according to the Institute of Navigation, \\"his proudest achievement\\" was the Star Altitude Curves, which simplified finding one's position; it was adopted by the Army Air Corps prior to World War II. Honors In 1953, Weems was awarded the Magellanic Premium, an honor given for contributions to navigation, astronomy or natural philosophy. It has been awarded only 33 times to 40 people since it was established in 1786. In 1960, Weems received a gold medal from the American Institute of Navigation. The institute also created an annual award named after him. In 1968, the National Geographic Society awarded him the John Oliver la Gorce Medal. Mount Weems in Antarctica is named in his honor. His papers are held by the Tennessee State Library and Archives.

The Folkerts SK-2 was the basis for the aircraft, with a slight upscaling in size with a larger Menasco C6-S engine. The SK-3 was a midwinged conventional aircraft with retractable landing gear. The fuselage was long and slender. The thin wings used spruce spars, plywood covering, and incorporated split flaps. The fuselage was welded steel tubing with aircraft fabric covering, built in two parts that were bolted together. The manual retractable landing gear used a single lever, rather than earlier crank systems. There were two forward fuel tanks, a main, and an auxiliary of mounted behind the cockpit.

It took its name from a large spring that formerly flowed near the town. Springville is the site of the Springville Free Methodist Church, built in 1891. Businesses in the town include two large gas stations serving highway travelers, and a large mobile home park. Springville is part of the Michigan City Area Schools school district. The Springville area was originally almost entirely forest, but is now a mixture of forest and farmland. The town stands on a low hill that divides the watershed of Trail Creek from the Galena River, which rises a short distance to the east in the Springfield Fen, which provides habitat for a variety of rare plants and animals. History Springville was first settled in 1833, and platted on August 19, 1835. It lay on the Michigan Road, an important early road which ran from the Ohio River to Michigan City, Indiana. In the mid-19th century, it was the site of businesses including a mill, sawmill, schoolhouse, tannery, shoemaker and general store, as well as both Baptist and Methodist congregations. Springville also had a post office from 1835 to 1863. During the 1840s, many locals hoped that Springville would become the county seat. The town's ambitions of becoming a location of importance ended, however, when the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway passed through LaPorte instead of Springville. In the 1850s, a company was organized in Springville to build a plank road from Michigan City to South Bend, but this too was unsuccessful. Later, however, the LaCrosse Division of the Pere Marquette Railroad, running from New Buffalo to LaCrosse was built through the town and stopped at Springville. The Pere Marquette right-of-way was ultimately acquired by the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad, and was abandoned in the late 20th century.

It is found in Europe, India, and possibly North America. The cap and gills are white. The whitish stipe has no ring. Taxonomy, naming, and classification The species was originally described as Agaricus albus by Jacob Christian Sch√§ffer in 1774, and reclassified as Gyrophila alba by mycologist Lucien Qu√©let in 1886. It was given its current binomial name by German Paul Kummer in 1871. The British Mycological Society has listed \\"white knight\\" as its common name. The generic name derives from the Greek trichos/œÑœÅŒπœáŒøœÇ 'hair' and loma/ŒªœâŒºŒ± 'hem', 'fringe' or 'border', while the specific epithet is the Latin adjective albus \\"white\\". The fungus is classified in the section Lasciva of the genus Tricholoma, characterised by species with a strong odor and acrid or bitter taste; an older classification has it placed in section Inamoena. Marcel Bon named the variety Tricholoma album var. thalliophilum to account for those mushrooms that differed by staining blue-green with thallium oxide and sulfoformol; in the absence of additional differentiating characters, some later authors have questioned the taxonomical value of this characteristic. Description The cap is wide and white with a pale yellow tinge, and more yellow or ochre in the centre as the fruit body ages. Convex with a slight boss, the cap is broadly conical in shape with inrolled margins. The white to pale yellow or ochre-tinged stipe is high and 0.8‚Äì1.5 cm wide and has no ring. There is no ring or volva. The mushroom has a prominent unpleasant sweet smell reminiscent of honey and radishes, and has an acrid and disagreeable taste. The thick gills are widely spaced with finely serrated edges. The spore print is white, the oval or oblong spores 5‚Äì7 Œºm long by 3.5‚Äì5 Œºm wide. Ecology, habitat and distribution Tricholoma album is found across Europe, the fruit bodies appearing between August and December, in association with oak (Quercus) trees, with which they form a mycorrhizal relationship. Experiments have demonstrated that inoculating blue pine (Pinus wallichiana) and deodar (Cedrus deodara) seedlings with the fungus increases plant height and shoot and root biomass. The mushroom can be encountered growing in sizeable fairy rings. The presence of the mushroom in North America has not been confirmed. It has been reported from India in 2010.

Located at Portglenone in County Antrim, the rock was used during the mid-seventeenth century in an isolated location for Catholic Mass. These times were a period dominated by the Penal Laws and known as the Penal Times. History =Ahoghill & Portglenone Parishes= Portglenone Parish was formerly part of Ahoghill Parish, with this Mass rock at one end of the area. Some of the parish priests who would have said Mass here included: * Fr. Henry O'Duffin (ordained by St. Oliver Plunkett in 1678) was appointed in 1704 after being registered as a parish priest with seventeen others in Co. Antrim. * Fr. Shield (a Franciscan from Cranfield) succeeded him until he was appointed Bishop in 1725. * Fr. Stephen Grant was here from 1725 to 1771. * Fr. John Cassidy (from Ballymacpeake) served from 1771 to 1819. During this time the church at Aughnahoy was built as the main church in the extended parish. * Fr. Peter McNally (1819-1825). * Fr. Patrick O'Neill (1825-1832). * Fr. John Lynch (from Portglenone, 1832-1847) helped to erect the present church in Ahoghill which opened in 1837. * Fr. John McCourt (1847-1886) presided over the building of the church in Cullybackey In 1866, Portglenone became a separate parish with Fr. McConnell as the first parish priest. He died in 1876 having helped erect the present church and school. The church was opened and dedicated the \\"Church of the Blessed Virgin, Mary Immaculate\\" on 10 September 1871. =Modern day= In the 20th century, Mass was celebrated at the rock on at least three occasions: * 1920: Following a mission held in the parish, The Irish News reported on 2 June 1920; \\"The close of the Mission brought a rather unique celebration on Monday morning when Mass was celebrated at the Old Altar in the Largy. This rude and secluded old structure hidden away remotely from the human eye proved a beacon light of the ancient faith of our forefathers in the valley of the Bann for almost two centuries\\". * 1971: After the ordination of Fr Tom McDonnell, Mass was celebrated here before he travelled to Kenya in Africa to begin his missionary work. *1996: The Silver Jubilee of Father McDonnell's ordination was marked with a parish Mass at the Old Altar. As of the 21st century, two Masses have been said so far at the rock: * 2000: The new millennium was welcomed and celebrated on 17 September 2000 with Mass on the Holy Ground. * 2011: The 40th Anniversary of Fr Tom McDonnell's Ordination was celebrated on Sunday 12 June 2011.

Filmmaker Laurence Trimble, who had often directed Turner while they were at Vitagraph Studios, was head of production for Turner Films, which had its studios at Walton-on-Thames. Little is known about the production, apart from its being shot in authentic locales in Dorset. After the film's premiere on 16 November 1915, at a private screening at London's West End Cinema, the press response was favorable. The Times wrote that Hardy \\"can have little reason to complain of the way in which his work has been handled. ‚Ä¶ One feels that the country in which the action is laid is really the Wessex of the novel and that the farm, the cattle, the sheep are the genuine ones over which Gabriel Oak watched with such care.\\" In February 1916, the five-reel feature film was given a general release in Britain. On 19 June 1916 the film was released in the United States, the first of six Turner productions to be distributed in the U.S. by Mutual Film. The production was panned in a Variety review, which criticized the narrative as hard to follow and deemed the 30-year-old Turner as \\"no longer qualified physically to portray the roles of the simple ingenue type\\". The reviewer concluded, \\"Far from the Madding Crowd is one of those stories of the type that appeared a decade to two ago in The Fireside Companion, intended primarily for consumption in the scullery and pantry by the maids and the cook and the picture carries the same atmosphere.\\" Hardy does not appear to have seen the film, although he wrote program notes for its premiere. The film's success in Britain prompted him to write his publisher that he was \\"glad to hear that Far from the Madding Crowd comes out so well.\\" By 1920 Hardy had changed his opinion, saying that it \\"seems to have been a failure\\". No boxoffice records are available to determine the film's financial success. Turner Films ceased production after Trimble and Turner returned to the U.S. later in 1916.

Along with mortality rate, natality rate is used to calculate the dynamics of a population. They are the key factors in determining whether a population is increasing, decreasing or staying the same in size. Natality is the greatest influence on a population‚Äôs increase. Natality is shown as a crude birth rate or specific birth rate. Crude birth rate is used when calculating population size (number of births per 1000 population/year), whereas specific birth rate is used relative to a specific criterion such as age. By calculating specific birth rate, the results are seen in an age-specific schedule of births.  Definitions  *Natality Rate ‚Äì number of births per 1000 individuals per year. *Absolute Natality ‚Äì the number of births under ideal conditions (with no competition, abundance of resources such as food and water, etc.). *Realized Natality ‚Äì the number of births when environmental pressures come into play.  Animal natality  Specific birth rate is used when calculating animal natality. The criterion used is age. Animal natality is expressed as an age-specific schedule of births. This is represented by the quantity of young/unit of time by females in various age classes. The age-specific birth schedule will count females that have only given birth to females. Showing the number of females that have been born relative to the previous generation will show how much of that generation may have the ability to reproduce. To construct the age-specific schedule, the average number of females born must be calculated. A survivorship column must also be included to construct a fertility table. Taking the survivorship column and the mx values from the life table, the number of offspring will be shown, giving us the natality rate. = Larger implications = Calculating natality of animals such as these polar bear cubs can help with preservation efforts. Calculating Natality for Animals has become an important part of the research for preservation of species. Studies have been conducted to determine whether a species may be going extinct because of climate or availability of resources. Measuring the natality of a species during extreme conditions such as drastic climate shift or a decrease in prey density will show scientists the measures that need to be taken to keep that species alive. Studies have been conducted about the Polar Bear population in Svalbard, Norway from 1988 to 2002 (Derocher 2005). As the average adult ages of both female and male increased, the natality rate decreased. Due to this observation, there was an interest in discovering why. The study was able to correlate the density of ringed seals, which are the polar bears‚Äô main prey, to the low natality rates.  Plant natality  Plants‚Äô natality is more difficult to determine than animals. The factors that make it difficult to measure are: *Seed production of individual plants varying year to year. *Seed production will also vary age class to age class. *The seeds will become dormant for long periods of time before germinating Plant natality is an uncertain factor to measure. The time it takes for a plant to germinate its seeds may be extended over too long of a time period for accurate measurement.  Natality in humans  Calculating and concluding the natality rate of humans is similar to animals. Age-specific schedules are constructed when determining growth rate. It can be used to find the effects that environmental chemicals/toxins have on women of a childbearing age (Axelrad 2010). Birth rates are helpful in making government policies regarding population growth. The birth rate is an item of concern and policy for a number of national governments. Some, including those of Italy and Malaysia, seek to increase the national birth rate using measures such as financial incentives or provision of support services to new mothers. Conversely, other countries have policies to reduce the birth rate, for example, China's one child policy. Measures such as improved information about and availability of birth control have achieved similar results in countries such as Iran.  Calculations where natality is a factor  *Natality rate: number of births/unit of time/Average Population *For wildlife management: N1 = N0 + (B ‚àí D) + (I ‚àí E) Where: **N1 = number of individuals at time 1 **N0 = number of individuals at time 0 **B = number of individuals born **D = number of individuals that died **I = number of individuals that immigrated **E = number of individuals that emigrated between time 0 and time 1. *Intrinsic rate of increase: (dN/dt)(1/N) = r **r= intrinsic rate of increase **(dN/dt) = rate that population increases **N = population size  References  Axelrad, Daniel A., J.

Biography Fernando Ni√±o de Guevara was born in Toledo, Spain in 1541, the son of Rodrigo Ni√±o, Marquis of Tejares. An uncle, also named Fernando Ni√±o de Guevara (d. 1552), was Archbishop of Granada from 1542 to 1552. He studied law at the University of Salamanca. He then moved to Cuenca, Spain, where he became archdeacon of the cathedral. In 1570, he became an oidor in Valladolid. He became a member of the Council of Castile in 1580. On 3 December 1599 he was appointed Grand Inquisitor of Spain. During his tenure as Grand Inquisitor, the Spanish Inquisition burned 240 heretics, plus 96 in effigy. 1,628 other individuals were found guilty and subjected to lesser penalties. On 10 Oct 1599, he was consecrated bishop by Pope Clement VIII with Camillo Borghese, Cardinal-Priest of Santi Giovanni e Paolo, and Alfonso Visconti, Bishop of Cervia, serving as co-consecrators. In 1600 he had a portrait painted by El Greco. On 30 April 1601 he was also appointed Archbishop of Seville. Fernando Ni√±o de Guevara engaged the Jesuits in a dispute about the nature of papal authority. As a result, Pope Clement VIII prevailed on Philip III of Spain to induce him to resign as Grand Inquisitor in 1602. He did, however, retain his duties as Archbishop of Seville. In this capacity, he called a synod in 1604 in order to suppress the confraternities and replace them with similar institutions dominated by clerics. He died, probably in Seville, on 8 January 1609. He is buried in the Convent of San Pablo in Toledo. Episcopal succession While bishop, he was the principal consecrator of: *Tom√°s de Borja, Bishop of Malaga (1600); *Juan Bautista Acevedo Mu√±oz, Bishop of Valladolid (1601); *Juan de la Sal, Titular Bishop of Hippo Diarrhytus and Auxiliary Bishop of Seville (1603); and *Francisco de Vera-Villavicencio, Titular Bishop of Madaurus and Auxiliary Bishop of Seville (1603).

He helped to the liberation of Buenos Aires during the first British invasions of the R√≠o de la Plata, commanding the ship \\"La Vizca√≠na\\". He was wounded during the battle, and promoted afterwards. Romarate fought as well in the defense of Buenos Aires against the ill-fated second invasion.

He rejected as well the May Revolution, which succeeded in deposing the viceroy. When the Primera Junta took government, Romarate moved back to Montevideo. He also refused support to the mutiny of √Ålzaga, a Royalist plot eventually suppressed by the Buenos Aires government. Montevideo declared war to Buenos Aires, and Romarate fought in the naval blockade imposed to the city. During the battle of San Nicol√°s, he defeated a rudimentary flotilla, which was sending reinforcements to Manuel Belgrano in the Paraguay campaign.

Pfann is known for his development of zone melting which is essential to the semiconductor industry. As stated in an official history of Bell Labs, \\"Timely invention of zone refining by W.G.Pfann ... was a major contribution that helped bring the impurities in germanium and silicon under control.\\"S. Millman editor (1983) A History of Engineering and Science in the Bell System, volume 4: Physical Sciences, p 580, Bell Labs  Early life  Pfann was born in Brooklyn, New York City. Showing unusual facility with materials, in 1935, when he was only eighteen years of age, he started with the Chemical Research Department of Bell Labs. He had no college degree at that time, but attending night school at Cooper Union led to a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering in 1940. Pfann was involved in William Shockley's efforts with Bell Labs to use semiconductors to make devices to replace vacuum tubes. The early efforts used germanium. They made high back-voltage germanium rectifiers in 1945. Pfann devised one of the first point-contact transistors: \\"Specifically, W.G. Pfann had modified the Western Electric 1N26 shielded point-contact (silicon) diode to include two spring-loaded cat whisker point contacts, making a three-electrode configuration with good electrical amplifying properties. This configuration became known at the Type A transistor.\\"F.M. Smits (1985) A History of Engineering and Science in the Bell System, volume 6: Electronics Technology, p 12, Bell Labs, He and Walter Brattain developed the process of \\"forming\\" these transistors to make them more uniform.William Shockley (1950) Electrons and Holes in Semiconductors, ¬ß4.5a The Forming Process, p 108, Van Nostrand and Company Pfann also invented a method of bonding fine gold wires to germanium that made the device functional. \\"The quiet, unassuming man grew steadily in everyone's esteem as he made one valuable contribution after another to the semiconductor research effort.\\"  Breakthrough  The zone melting process that Pfann is known for revolutionized engineering possibilities: \\"The purity that can be attained by zone refining was absolutely unprecedented in the history of materials processing. Impurity levels of a few parts per million had previously been considered excellent; Pfann's technique improved on this by factors of over 1,000.\\". In 1952, Pfann published the revelatory article \\"Principles of Zone- Melting\\" in the Transactions of the American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers. This article applied zone melting in two industrial processes: purification of a solvent material (called zone refining), and production of a uniform distribution of a solute in an ingot (called zone leveling). Three appendices described mathematical models of the processes in zone melting. In 1958, Pfann published the first edition of his text Zone Melting with John Wiley. A second edition appeared in 1966, and in 1978 publisher Robert E. Krieger of Huntington, New York issued the third edition. In 1962, the journal Science published a short digest of the zone melting method by Pfann. This article concludes by treating the slightly larger topic of temperature gradient zone melting. Pfann describes how and why a drop of gold on a germanium slab moves toward the hottest spot. He says this method was used to \\"make complex p-n junction shapes for special transistors\\". He observes the motion of brine on sea ice and proposes the purification of sea water. Further he notes the relation to the physics of geological formations. Later years In 1973 Pfann was the first to receive the Gordon E. Moore Medal for Outstanding Achievement in Solid State Science and Technology. Pfann was elected to the National Academy of Sciences (U.S.) in 1975. In 1976 the American Institute of Physics awarded him the James C. McGroddy Prize for New Materials.

Early life Guro was born in St. Petersburg on January 10, 1877. Her father was Genrikh Stepanovich Guro, an officer in the Imperial Russian Army of French descent. Her mother Anna Mikhailovna Chistyakova was a talented amateur artist. Guro spent her childhood in the village of Novosely near Pskov and at her father's estate in Luga. She inherited a government pension and property in Finland from her father, using both to support her artistic career. Her sister, Ekaterina Guro, was also a writer. Career Guro and Matyushin. From 1890 to 1893 she studied art at the Society for the Encouragement of the Arts in St Petersburg. From 1903 to 1905 she studied in the private studio of Jan CiƒÖgli≈Ñski where she met her future husband Mikhail Matyushin (they were married in 1906). In 1905 she published her first short story, in an anthology of contemporary Russian writers. One year previously, in 1904, she illustrated the Russian translation of a book of fairy tales by the French writer George Sand. In 1906 she and Matyushin moved to the art school of Elizaveta Zvantseva, where Guro worked under Mstislav Dobuzhinsky, L√©on Bakst and Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin. In 1908 she left the school and established her own studio. By 1908 her home was an important meeting place for discussions on art and literature. Little Deer by Guro, 1908/09 Her first book of prose, poetry, and drama The Hurdy-Gurdy came out in 1909. In 1910 she contributed to the journal Trap for Judges, one of the first publications of the Russian Futurists. She also contributed to the second volume of Trap for Judges in 1913. Guro and her husband subsidized both issues. In 1911 Guro's manuscript of a book of fairy tales she had been planning to publish was lost by her publisher, along with the illustrations she had done for it. Her second book Autumnal Dream was published in 1912. Guro is well-known for her fascination with the contrast between the urban world and nature, once writing in a short story about the psychology of people based in cities. Her fascination appears to have begun with the way a city looks, for example its street lights and gilded windows, but eventually, she became tired of the subject in about 1910, when the very theme was growing popular with her Cubo-Futurist colleagues. According to Matyushin, she would now stay in the countryside from Spring until Autumn. Last days In 1913 she continued to write and paint, even though she was suffering from leukemia. She died the same year at her country house in what was formerly Uusikirkko, Finland. At the time of her death she had nearly completed a major work The Poor Knight. Several poems and two works of prose were published posthumously, in the collection The Three and in the journal Union of Youth, in 1913. Her third book The Little Camels of the Sky was published in 1914.

The Moorish Revival building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. Sometimes referred to as the \\"West Coast Apollo\\", the Lincoln Theater was one of the most significant establishments along the Central Avenue Corridor that became the cultural and business hub of the African American community in Los Angeles from the 1920s to the 1950s. For more than 30 years, the Lincoln featured live theater, musical acts, talent shows, vaudeville, and motion pictures, including live performances by the leading African-American performers of the era, including Lionel Hampton, Duke Ellington, the Nat King Cole Trio, and Billie Holiday. The Lincoln Theater was managed and directed by Jules Wolf The theater was converted to use as a church in 1962 and continues to be used for religious services. Design and construction The Lincoln Theater was built between 1926 and 1927 at a cost of $500,000. The theater was built in the style of a grand movie palace with a large stage, orchestra pit, and seating for 2,100 persons. The building was designed by architect John Paxton Perrine (1886‚Äì1972), who is known for his design of Southern California movie palaces in the 1920s, including the California Theater (1926, San Diego), the Roosevelt Theater (1926, Hawthorne), the Fox Redondo Theater (1927, Redondo Beach), and the California Theatre (1928, San Bernardino). The Lincoln was considered by the California Eagle, \\"the finest and most beautiful theater in the country built exclusively for race patronage.\\" The Lincoln Theater is considered an outstanding example of Exotic Revival and Moorish Revival architecture. The front facade is divided into three symmetrical bays with the theater's entrance at the bottom of the central bay. The facade is marked by decorative ceramic tile above arches in the side bays and columns that are capped by onion-shaped capitals and lance- shaped spires. The area in the central bay above the marquee is decorated with layers of arches and columns that were intended to create \\"the overall impression of a step-back tower in low relief\\". The Central Avenue Corridor In the 1910s and 1920s, large movie theaters were opened in Downtown Los Angeles in the Broadway Theater District. However, African Americans were either excluded from these theaters altogether or restricted to \\"colored only\\" seating areas. During the 1910s and 1920s, a number of cultural and business institutions catering to the African-American population of Los Angeles opened along a one-mile stretch of South Central Avenue. These included Dreamland Rink, the Murray Pocket Billiard Emporium and Cigar Stand, the 28th Street YMCA, Second Baptist Church, Sidney P. Dones Company (offering real estate, insurance and legal services), the California Eagle newspaper, the Dunbar Hotel, and the Lincoln Theater.Flamming, Bound for Freedom: Black Los Angeles in Jim Crow America, pp. 121‚Äì122. The area, known as the Central Avenue Corridor, became the cultural and economic hub of the African-American community in Los Angeles from the 1920s through the 1950s. The Lincoln was the largest of several theaters along the Central Avenue Corridor offering entertainment to the African-American community. Three of the others (the Tivoli, Angelus and Hub Theaters) have since been demolished. A fourth, the Globe Theater, has been substantially altered. Early years The Lincoln Theater opened in October 1927. The \\"Chocolate Scandals\\" and Curtis Mosby's Dixieland Blue Blowers provided the entertainment at an invitation-only premiere on October 6, 1927. Though catering to the African-American community, the Lincoln became popular with the city's white audiences as well. In May 1928, Los Angeles Times columnist Lee Shippey wrote of the Lincoln: > It is a big, well-appointed theater in which all of the actors and almost > all of the auditors are negroes. But many white people crowd in, too, > because the chance to see negro actors of real ability appearing for their > own people rather than appearing as negroes from the white man's point of > view is one that doesn't come to one in every city. The Lincoln Theater's house company, known as the Lafayette Players, attracted Hollywood celebrities, including Charlie Chaplin, Irving Thalberg, Janet Gaynor, and Fanny Brice, to performances at the Lincoln. Notable performers who appeared at the Lincoln in the late 1920s include Nina Mae McKinney (known as \\"The Black Garbo\\"), Evelyn Preer (known in the African-American community as \\"The First Lady of the Screen\\"), Clarence Muse, Elsie Ferguson, Laura Bowman, Abbie Mitchell, Charles Sidney Gilpin, and the house band, Mosby's Blue Syncopators providing \\"'hot' music while a chorus of twenty-four dusky beauties ... strut to its tunes.\\" The \\"West Coast Apollo\\" From the 1930s to the 1950s, the Lincoln featured live theater, concerts, talent shows, vaudeville, and film. One historical account noted that the Lincoln \\"offered stunning stage shows and packed in black audiences on Saturday and Sunday nights.\\" The Lincoln was the site of performances by many of the leading African-American performers of the era, including Lionel Hampton, Duke Ellington, the Nat King Cole Trio, Billie Holiday, Lena Horne, Louis Jordan, Pigmeat Markham, Fats Domino, and B.B. King. The Lincoln was sometimes called the \\"West Coast Apollo\\" because it featured many of the same acts as Harlem's Apollo Theater. Concerts at the Lincoln in the post-World War II era attracted diverse audiences that included the likes of choreographer Alvin Ailey, activist Eldridge Cleaver, and songwriter eden ahbez. It was outside the Lincoln in the late 1940s that a bearded ahbez wearing sandals handed the song \\"Nature Boy\\" to Nat King Cole's road manager. Conversion to church use In 1962, the Lincoln Theater was sold to the Southern California First Jurisdiction of the Church of God in Christ and became known as \\"The Crouch Temple\\" operated by Bishop Samuel M. Crouch. The theater was later operated as the Iglesia de Cristo Ministries Juda. In 2009, the theater was deemed to satisfy the registration requirements set forth in a multiple property submission study, the African Americans in Los Angeles MPS. Other sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009 pursuant to the same African Americans in Los Angeles MPS include the Second Baptist Church, 28th Street YMCA, Prince Hall Masonic Temple, Angelus Funeral Home, 52nd Place Historic District, 27th Street Historic District, and two historic all-black segregated fire stations (Fire Station No. 14 and Fire Station No. 30).

A two-track CD single was released in Germany on August 24, 2012. Song background The song is about Brendan Mullen, founder of The Masque, a small punk rock club which was an important part of the early L.A. punk scene. Mullen was also a longtime friend of the Chili Peppers and one of the first music promoters to give the band their start. In 1983, Anthony and Flea had a demo tape and took it to a popular L.A. club, Club Lingerie. There they had their first encounter with Mullen, who was the booker for the club. They played Mullen their tape while they danced around to the song for an opening spot for the Bad Brains, who were an influence to the band and kings of the punk rock scene at the time. Many years later Mullen was working with Blackie Dammett on the Chili Peppers biography, Red Hot Chili Peppers: An Oral/Visual History when he died suddenly after suffering a stroke in 2009 and was unable to complete work on the book though it eventually was finished by Mullen's long-time companion Kateri Butler and designer/musician John Curry, who had been friends with Brendan since the Masque days and was a member of The Flyboys. The book was released in 2010. Flea responded to Mullen's passing by writing a two-page article in the Los Angeles Times. According to a July 2011 interview with singer Anthony Kiedis, Mullen died on the first day of rehearsals for the album. Kiedis said he received a text message about the death and he informed the band when he got to rehearsals. Without talking, the band quickly started to play music and the jam, which was the basis for the song, came right away. Kiedis stated that the song has the feel of a death march but ultimately \\"the song is more of a celebration than a bummer.\\" Kiedis describes his favorite part of the song being the bridge, which is much darker and there is a feeling of falling into the unknown abyss of dying.http://anthonykiedis.net/info/wp- content/uploads/2011/07/Q-302-RHCP-September-2011-81.png Guitarist Josh Klinghoffer described the song as being part acoustic mourning, part galloping hard-rock send-off.http://download.wbr.com/rhcp/RHCP_rs.pdf Despite getting no radio airplay, fans voted the song tenth best of the year in the Rolling Stone Top 10 Reader's Poll of 2011. In an interview with Billboard, published March 6, 2012, Chad Smith announced the song would be the band's next single. Structure The song is written in 4/4, beginning with an acoustic guitar introduction, which is then sung over by vocalist Anthony Kiedis. The song gradually builds, introducing electric guitars, drums, and bass, reaching full instrumentation in the first chorus. The drumbeat makes heavy use of tom-tom drums. In the chorus following the bridge, bassist Flea plays an improvised melodic bassline. The song ends with the chorus structure being repeated several times, while Flea and Chad Smith solo over it. Music video The video was directed by Marc Klasfeld, who also directed the music videos for \\"The Adventures of Rain Dance Maggie\\" and \\"Monarchy of Roses\\". The band shot scenes for the video in New Orleans on May 21, 2012 and through their website, invited fans to be part of the video by sending in their photo and info. If selected they would appear in the video. The main concept for the video was to shoot it in a Jazz Funeral style, which involved musicians playing in a marching band formation throughout the funeral procession. In the first part of the video the funeral band plays as the Red Hot Chili Peppers perform while being driven along on a black Ford Pickup Truck Hearse. The final act of the video sees the band performing at McDonoghville Cemetery in Louisiana, where they perform against a backdrop of burning letters that reads ‚ÄúDeath Song‚Äù. The video made its premiere on June 28, 2012 at rollingstone.com. The length of the song in the video version is edited by over 2 minutes compared to the album version. On August 16, 2012, the full-length music video was released.  Live performances and promotion  Despite being a single, the song has only been performed four times live with Kiedis often struggling on some of the lyrics.

Established as the 553d Reconnaissance Squadron in 1967 at Otis AFB, Massachusetts. Moved to Thailand as an electronic warfare squadron to detect vehicles along the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Indochina. If enemy vehicles could be detected then stopped, then a major quantity of enemy supplies into South Vietnam would be halted. The \\"electronic fence\\" concept envisioned using Navy sonobuoys delivered along the Ho Chi Minh Trail by air, with special receivers in the 553d Reconnaissance Wing EC-121 aircraft to pick up the signals. The EC-121 would, when in range, automatically relay the signals picked up to the Infiltration Center at Nakhon Phanom RTAFB. Several target areas along the Ho Chi Minh Trail were outside of the range of the relay equipment; during out of range flights the signals were processed manually by the crew on board the EC-121R, then radioed via High Frequency Single Side Band radio directly to Seventh Air Force Headquarters in Saigon, South Vietnam.

CRC Press, London. . was an important figure in the aerodynamics field and is known worldwide for his two compendiums of aerodynamic knowledge, Fluid-Dynamic Drag and Fluid-Dynamic Lift. He is also notable for his design work on the pioneering STOL aircraft, the Fieseler Fi 156 Storch. Education Dr. Hoerner studied mechanical engineering at the Technical University of Munich, earning a Dipl.Ing. and he earned a degree as Dr.-Ing. in aerodynamics at the Institute of Technology at Braunschweig. Finally, he obtained a degree as Dr.-Ing.-habil. from the TH Berlin.[Hoerner 1965] Career Initially, he served as research assistant at the Deutsche Versuchsanstalt fur Luftfahrt (DVL, near Berlin). After this, he worked as an aerodynamicist at the Fieseler Corporation, where he worked on the aerodynamic design of the Fieseler Fi 156 Storch STOL aircraft. From there, he went to Junkers, where he worked as the head of design aerodynamics, before going to Messerschmitt, where he worked as a research aerodynamicist during World War II. After the war, he was \\"invited\\" (Operation Paperclip) to emigrate to the United States, where he worked in aerodynamics at Wright Field in Ohio. Eventually, he ended up working as a specialist in aerodynamics and hydrodynamics in the field of naval architecture at Gibbs & Cox, Inc. in New York City.[Hoerner 1965] Contributions In 1945 and 1946, Dr. Hoerner prepared a manuscript for the book Aerodynamic Drag. The technical publishing houses in New York City were not confident enough to bring a book as specialized as this to the market. As a result, he published the book himself in 1951, using a photo-offset process and sold copies of the book by mail order from his home.[Hoerner 1951] The book got very good reviews and demand was steady. In 1958 it was reissued as Fluid-Dynamic Drag. With the rapid progress in aerodynamics over the years, he prepared an update to the book, which was published in 1965.[Hoerner 1965] As before, the book was self- published by Hoerner Fluid Dynamics. This book contains documentation of the worldwide knowledge (at the time) of the sources of aerodynamic drag and the means to quantify aerodynamic drag. While substantial knowledge on this subject has been learned since 1965, this book is often the starting point in work where aerodynamic drag must be calculated. The US Navy Office of Naval Research gave Dr. Hoerner a contract in the mid-1960s to write a companion volume Fluid-Dynamic Lift. Co-authored with Henry V. \\"Hank\\" Borst, this book was published by Hoerner Fluid Dynamics in 1975. Unfortunately, Dr. Hoerner died before publication. This book, like its companion, contains documentation of the worldwide knowledge on the generation of aerodynamic lift and is still used heavily.[Hoerner 1975] Personal life Dr. Hoerner was married to Liselotte A. Hoerner. After his death, she continued the mail order business, selling copies of both books to engineers around the world.[Hoerner 1975]  References  ; Bibliography * Hoerner, Dr. Sighard F., Aerodynamic Drag, Otterbein Press, Dayton Ohio, 1951. * Hoerner, Dr. Sighard F., Fluid-Dynamic Drag, Hoerner Fluid Dynamics, Bricktown New Jersey, 1965. * Hoerner, Dr. Sighard F. and Borst, Henry V., Fluid-Dynamic Lift, Hoerner Fluid Dynamics, Bricktown New Jersey, 1975.

The site covers an area of 28,740 hectares, and it is located just outside the major town of Ada and to the west of the Volta River estuary. It was designated as Ramsar wetland site of international importance number 566 on June 22, 1988. In 2011, UNESCO approved the Songor Biosphere Reserve as part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves.UNESCO announcement , \\"18 new Biosphere Reserves added to UNESCO‚Äôs Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Programme\\", published 30 June 2011 Among several other important functions, it acts as habitat and/or breeding ground for several notable species.The Ramsar Sites Database, , \\"Songor Lagoon Ramsar Information Sheet\\", retrieved 13 January 2011 Physical features The site itself is a closed lagoon that is continually refilled by seepage, runoff, creeks, and streams. It is characterized by high salinity levels and surrounded by mudflats that are inundated for most of the year. The soil is a tropical gray earth type with an unconsolidated sand, clay, and gravel composition. Up to a depth of 80 cm, visibility allows for a clear view of the bottom of the lagoon. Hide tide occurs at a depth of 1.98 m; at this point, water from auxiliary creeks can flow into the lagoon. Low tide occurs at 0.11 m. Average temperature, rainfall, and humidity are 23-33 ¬∞C, 750 mm, and 60% respectively. The elevation varies between 15 m near the coast and up to 75 m above sea level.The Ramsar Sites Database, , \\"Songor Lagoon Ramsar Information Sheet\\", retrieved 13 January 2011 Flora Although Sesuvium and mangrove species dominate the area, the florae are largely segregated within the site. The lagoon and mudflats are populated by Paspalum vaginatum, Cyperus articulatus, Sesuvium portulacastrum, and Elocharis mutate. Adropogon guyanus, Heteropogon contortus, and Azadirachta indica are common around the catchment areas while Rhizophora racemosa and Avicennia africana are found along the creeks.The Ramsar Sites Database, , \\"Songor Lagoon Ramsar Information Sheet\\", retrieved 13 January 2011 The last two mangrove species are considered to be of particular value. While Rhizophora racemosa is not considered threatened by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and Avicennia africana has not been evaluated, populations are believed to be in decline. Locals have implemented mangrove restoration projects in the past because they acknowledged that mangroves contribute to the abundance of fauna by providing shelter; the efforts met with varying degrees of success.Rao, A.S., , \\"A comparison of two mangrove restoration projects in Ada, Ghana\\", retrieved 13 January 2011 Fauna Several endangered and noteworthy animal species inhabit the Songor Lagoon. In fact, some intensive research is focused on the sea turtles that nest in the area. The three species that frequent the beaches are: Dermochelys coriacea, Chelonia mydas, and Lepidochelys olivacea.The Ramsar Sites Database, , \\"Songor Lagoon Ramsar Information Sheet\\", retrieved 13 January 2011 All three species are classified as threatened by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.The IUCN Red List of Endangered Species, , \\"Red List search\\", retrieved 13 January 2011 Of marine species, manatees are also known to inhabit the waters surrounding the site. The lagoon additionally acts as an important waypoint for European migratory birds that winter in Ghana. The most commonly seen genera/families are Recurvirostra, Sternidae, and Tringa. Because the site has been known to exceed a bird population of 100,000 in the European winter, with migratory terns, sandpipers, stilts, plovers, and other waterfowl adding to the local population, the Songor Lagoon is regarded as one of Ghana‚Äôs most important wetland sites (second only to Keta Lagoon.Briggs, P. 2009. \\"The East Coast: Songor Lagoon Ramsar Site\\" in Ghana: The Bradt Travel Guide, \\"Songor Lagoon Ramsar Information Sheet\\", retrieved 13 January 2011) People The Songor Lagoon is of particular cultural and utilitarian value to the local people living in and around Ada. Reeds, fuel wood, tilapia, crab, and other game are harvested from the site on a mainly subsistence basis The Ramsar Sites Database, , \\"Songor Lagoon Ramsar Information Sheet\\", retrieved 13 January 2011 while salt is extracted for widespread distribution to Togo, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Nigeria.Ghana Districts, , \\"Dangme East Mining Sector\\", retrieved 13 January 2011 Several clans in the area, the Adabiawe, Lomobiawe, Dangbebiawe and Tekperbiawe clans, depend on salt extraction as their primary source of revenue, producing approximately 900,000 metric tons of salt per year.Ghana Districts, , \\"Four Clans that own Ada Songhor Salt Lagoon have appealed to Government to expedite action on the release of the Ada Songhor Salt Lagoon concession to them to operate\\", retrieved 13 January 2011 In addition to harvesting the natural products of the lagoon, the local people use the land around the lagoon for cattle grazing, road development, and farming cassava, maize, tomatoes, okra, pepper, beans, onions and watermelons.Ghana Wildlife Division, , \\"National Parks: Songor Lagoon\\", retrieved 13 January 2011 The lagoon is also viewed as a sacred cultural site for some. A small section of the site, called the Yomo lagoon, has been spared from land cultivation for the salt mines. This decision was made in deference to a sect of local people who consider the Yomo lagoon to be a consecrated area.Ghana Districts, , \\"The Ministry of Lands, Forestry and Mines in conjunction with Minerals Commission has prepared a land use plan for Ada Songhor Lagoon Area with the vision to transforming it into a major salt producing area in the country\\", retrieved 13 January 2011 Additionally, several community leaders of Ada have indicated that the natural habitat surrounding the town has been traditionally protected for generations. Aside from granting the lagoon and Volta estuary recognition as some of the few places left on earth where sea turtles still nest, the people of Ada believe that these sites are powerful places where human, animal, and other spirits meet. Ecotourism Songor Lagoon‚Äôs complement of rare and diverse species makes it a popular tourist attraction. Birders are probably the lagoon‚Äôs most avid ecotourists, attracted to the thousands of birds that migrate to the site in the European winter. The area‚Äôs two bird watching platforms, one in Pute and one in Lolanya, host the birders while they observe and photograph varieties such as sandwich, black, royal, roseate, and little terns, black- winged stilts, ringed plovers, curlew sandpipers, spotted redshanks, and greenshanks. The lagoon‚Äôs second most popular ecotourist attraction is its guided sea turtle walk program. The walks are managed by the Ghana Wildlife Division, with the best months to see turtles being August through March. The walks are conducted at night, between 23:00 and 2:00, when sea turtles are likely to be seen nesting on the beach. However, as all sea turtle species are threatened, the Wildlife Division officers often remind tourists that a turtle sighting is a rare event and cannot be guaranteed to occur during the walk.Briggs, P. 2009. \\"The East Coast: Songor Lagoon Ramsar Site\\" in Ghana: The Bradt Travel Guide, \\"Songor Lagoon Ramsar Information Sheet\\", retrieved 13 January 2011 Other visitors prefer to tour the site by boat, readily booking trips privately or through the Manet Paradise Hotel. These excursions often afford birders a more diverse viewing at Crocodile Island, where little egrets, western reef herons, and cormorants are known to breed; the island is also acclaimed for its basket-weaving industry. Another attraction that can only be reached by boat is Sugar Cane Island, which offers tours of its rum distillery. Additionally, boats can be commissioned through the Manet paradise hotel for deep-sea fishing trips, which generally last all day.Briggs, P. 2009. \\"The East Coast: Songor Lagoon Ramsar Site\\" in Ghana: The Bradt Travel Guide, \\"Songor Lagoon Ramsar Information Sheet\\", retrieved 13 January 2011 Threats and possible consequences The main threats to the site exist as varied forms of excessive utilization. Some common cases are over-fishing, extreme harvesting of mangroves, extensive drainage and cultivation for farmland, heavy grazing by cattle and livestock, and an unsustainable level of salt winning. These threats are difficult to neutralize because the human communities surrounding the lagoon are largely poor and over-populated. In effect, the local people are dependent upon their harvesting of the lagoon for survival. Although ecotourism provides an ecologically friendly source of income, the practice is not extensive enough to sustain the local communities. Additional threats originate from the use of pesticides and herbicides, the damming of creeks and channels for the purpose of expanding infrastructure, and rubbish dumping.The Ramsar Sites Database, , \\"Songor Lagoon Ramsar Information Sheet\\", retrieved 13 January 2011 These threats can and, in some instances, have had dire consequences. The breeding cycles of nesting species, like the several sea turtle species hosted by the lagoon, can be disturbed by exaggerated human activity. Furthermore, the eggs of such species are often trampled by grazing cattle and livestock. Another realized effect of human exploitation is the apparent shrinking of the lagoon, which can be easily observed in the satellite photo comparison shown at the opening of this article. Further disturbance of the lagoon could result in not only the loss of species that inhabit the site, but also the loss of nutritive and moderating benefits provided by the site. Aside from purifying ground water, acting as a reservoir for nutrients, and supporting the local food chain, the lagoon regulates water flow, staggers and lessens the effects of flooding, and disperses the extreme erosive forces exerted on the shore by the Atlantic Ocean.The Ramsar Sites Database, , \\"Songor Lagoon Ramsar Information Sheet\\", retrieved 13 January 2011 See also * Keta Lagoon References External links * Songor Biosphere Reserve in the UNESCO database of biosphere reserves * Songor Wetland in the Ramsar database of wetlands of international importance Category:Ramsar sites in Ghana Category:Lagoons of Ghana ","title":"Songhor Lagoon"},{"id":"32089306","text":"Ezra Schabas, (April 24, 1924 ‚Äì October 12, 2020) was a Canadian musician, educator and author. He was active in Canada's musical life beginning in 1952, when he emigrated from Cleveland with his family. During his time in Canada, he was a leading musical educator, clarinetist, and administrator in Toronto's musical institutions. He wrote several books on Canadian and American musical history, and he was appointed to the Order of Ontario and made a Member of the Order of Canada.  Early life and education  Schabas was born in New York City in April 1924 to Jewish parents, Minnie Anker and Hyman Schabas.Ezra Schabas obituary He attended the Juilliard School for clarinet, where he studied with clarinetist Arthur Christmann. The interruption of World War II led Schabas to leave Juilliard in 1943 with an Artist Diploma to serve with the US Army forces in France and Germany. While overseas, he attended the Nancy Conservatory before returning to New York City in 1946. Upon his return, Schabas completed his Bachelor of Science at Juilliard in 1947, followed by a Master of Arts at Columbia University in 1948. For the next few years, he studied in a variety of places, including the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, NY, the American Conservatory at Fontainebleau, France, as well as clarinet in New York with David Weber and in Paris with Gaston Hamelin. Between 1948 and 1950, he taught at the University of Massachusetts and from 1950 to 1952 at Western Reserve University in Cleveland, before moving to Toronto to be a freelance clarinetist and concert manager at the Royal Conservatory of Music. He became a Canadian citizen in 1967.  Career  After relocating to Toronto in 1952, Schabas became a director of the Royal Conservatory of Music, one of Canada's most esteemed music education institutions that has trained artists including Oscar Peterson, Glenn Gould and Sarah McLachlan. During his eight-year tenure at the Conservatory and afterwards, Schabas's clarinet pupils included Brian Barley, Paul Grice, Howard Knopf, Timothy Maloney, Peter Smith, and Patricia Wait. As a concert manager, he helped find engagements for young artists such as Jon Vickers and Lois Marshall. In 1960, Schabas helped to found the National Youth Orchestra of Canada, a musical organization dedicated to discovering and nurturing talented young Canadian musicians, and he was the Orchestra's first administrator. That same year, he was appointed to the University of Toronto's faculty of music. He became the head of the performance and opera department from 1968 to 1978. In 1966, the Ontario Arts Council and the Ontario Federation of Symphony Orchestras commissioned him to report on Ontario Orchestras, which subsequently served as a blueprint for Ontario's orchestral development for the next thirty years. Schabas collaborated with the Ontario Arts Council again in 1968 to establish the University of Toronto Conductors' Workshop. In 1972, Schabas was one of the founders of Orchestras Canada and was elected its first president. Having continued teaching at the Faculty of Music and Royal Conservatory of Music throughout his time at the National Youth Orchestra and Orchestras Canada, in 1978 Schabas was made Principal of the Conservatory, a position he held until 1983. During his time as Principal, he developed training programs for gifted children and pre-university teenagers. In 1980, he launched the Orchestral Training Program for professional musicians at the Conservatory, which received funding from Employment and Immigration Canada to help young Canadians find work in Canadian orchestras. That same year, he founded the Association of Colleges and Conservatories of Music, serving as its first president from 1980 to 1984. Schabas followed up his time as Principal by returning to the University of Toronto's faculty of music in 1983, only to retire the following year. In 1985, he was named professor emeritus. From 1987 to 1990, Schabas again drew upon funding from Employment and Immigration Canada, the Ontario Arts Council and the Association of Canadian Orchestras to direct \\"Musical Performance and Communication.\\" This unique professional training program at the University of Toronto sought to help classical musicians find new and better ways of attracting and communicating with audiences.  Musician and author  Not only a teacher and administrator, Schabas performed and conducted in Canada, the United States and overseas. He worked as a freelance clarinetist for the CBC Orchestra until 1960 and played in a number of ensembles around Toronto, including the Toronto Woodwind Quintet from 1956 to 1960. As an educator, he spoke at conferences in Europe, Asia, South America, Canada and the US and was a frequent consultant and juror for the Canada Council for the Arts, the Ontario Arts Council, and Canadian Heritage, among others. He wrote three biographies on musicians and two on musical institutions, winning the 1995 City of Toronto Annual Book Award for Sir Ernest MacMillan: The Importance of Being Canadian. From 1996 to 1998, he also acted as president of The Arts and Letters Club of Toronto and in 2000 was elected director-general of the Canadian Encyclopedia of Music.  Personal life  Schabas lived in Toronto and was married to Ann (Fairley) Schabas, the former dean of the Faculty of Library and Information Sciences at the University of Toronto. She is the daughter of Margaret Fairley, a notable Canadian activist and writer, and Barker Fairley, a well-respected Canadian artist and German literature scholar. They had five children: academic William Schabas, former Ontario Chief Medical Officer of Health Richard Schabas, academic Margaret Schabas, transportation executive Michael Schabas and Ontario Supreme Court Justice Paul Schabas. He had twelve grandchildren, and eleven great-grandchildren. He died in Toronto, Ontario in October 2020 at the age of 96.  Awards  Schabas was awarded the Canadian Centennial Medal in 1967, appointed to the Order of Ontario in 1996, and made a Member of the Order of Canada in 2000. In 2002, he was appointed a Fellow (Honoris Causa) of the Royal Conservatory of Music, was presented with the Golden Jubilee Medal by the Governor General, and made a lifetime member of the Toronto Musicians Association. In 2012, he received the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Medal.

History Incision started back in February 2008, when four small town boys with each a vision of what their sound should be like, straight up classic hard rock. Some changes to the line-up the band rolled into 2009. They kicked off with playing their first gig in a local bar where the boys first performed live and felled the pressure of it all, With still just a few months as a complete band they had performances all over the province Noord Holland (Netherlands). Mid-way through the year complications arose which resulted in the departures of some band members which left them stranded. With enough writing down and a new year ahead they found them self‚Äôs back in action with a new member and some new ideas on the table. With some problems of not having a real singer they are searching for someone to take on that role. One month away from a big gig for them as a small band they were lucky to find the proper replacement. New music which was written could finally be completed and a batch of new gigs was planned down through the remainder of 2010. A promising start off 2011 also brought some problems with differences in musical directions which resulted in another line-up change. But charged with the opportunity to open for: Oliver Dawson‚Äôs Saxon(UK). With new energy and the mentality to shift into a higher gear the band got booked throughout 2011 and things were getting hot. People started to get notice of them and their new show and look. Half way through the year again there came some problems along with in the band which resulted in the departure of one of the members. Within a month a new replacement was found and they were ready to rock again. With a new member to strengthen the band they worked on their performances and closed the year off in full force. At the start of 2012 they hit the studios and recorded their first demo, which was released on March 3. Still going strong they continue on performing and trying to better themselves which each show they play. Throughout 2012 the band kept on touring but also began to write new material for on the road and future releases. With Roy on board as a full-time writer the band's style has changed and the songs are getting better with time! At the end of the year Incision was asked to perform on a benefit for a festival that is collecting as much as possible to help fight the war against baby deathtolls across the globe, and with that gig Dani left the band on a beautiful note by performing in one of the hottest places of Hoorn (Noord Holland) Manifesto!

It was written by Krista Vernoff and directed by Ed Ornelas. The episode was originally broadcast on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in the United States on September 24, 2009. In \\"Good Mourning\\", the physicians are seen dealing with the revelation that a dead John Doe is their beloved co-worker Dr. George O'Malley (T. R. Knight), and dealing with the aftermath of Dr. Izzie Stevens' (Katherine Heigl)'near-death experience. Further storylines include Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) and Stevens trying to decide whether or not to donate O'Malley's organs and Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) being offered Dr. Richard Webber's (James Pickens, Jr.) chief of surgery job. The episode was the first part of the 2-hour season 6 premiere, the second being \\"Goodbye\\", and took place at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital. \\"Good Mourning\\" was the first episode that Knight did not appear in, following an early release from his contract, and Jessica Capshaw's (Dr. Arizona Robbins) first episode in which she received star-billing, having been upgraded from a recurring-star. Mitch Pileggi reprised his role as a guest star, in addition to Debra Monk, Shannon Lucio and Zoe Boyle. \\"Good Mourning\\" opened to positive critical reviews, with particular praise directed towards Ramirez's performance. The original episode broadcast was ranked at #1 for the night with in the United States 17.03 million viewers, and a 6.7/17 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. Plot The episode opens to a voice-over narrative from Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), explaining the K√ºbler-Ross model, that is the 5 stages of grief. At the conclusion of season 5's finale, Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) and Dr. George O'Malley (T. R. Knight) both flatlined, from cancer and being dragged by a bus, respectively, and the opening of the episode reveals Stevens to have been revived, while O'Malley has been pronounced brain dead. O'Malley's former wife Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) informs her colleagues that he has died, and suffers an emotional breakdown, hyperventilating. O'Malley's death had been implied in the first episode when he asks \\"We're gonna survive this, right?\\" with Grey answering nothing. It is unknown whether or not O'Malley is an organ donor, and the chief of surgery Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) calls O'Malley's mother, Louise (Debra Monk), as she is his next of kin. Following Stevens's resuscitation, she is unaware that O'Malley has died, and her husband Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) decides not to tell her, with fear that she might go into circulatory shock and lose consciousness again. Pediatric surgeon Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw) is introduced to a patient, with body pain, whom she diagnoses with growing pains. Louise O'Malley arrives at the hospital, and asks Torres to decide if O'Malley's organs will be donated. The victim of a speedboat accident, Clara Ferguson (Zoe Boyle), arrives at the hospital in an ambulance, with both of her arms and one of her legs amputated. She is attended to by plastic surgeon Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), who informs her that her cut-off arms can be reattached. The hospital's president, Larry Jennings (Mitch Pileggi), explains to neurosurgeon Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) that Webber has not been substantially completing his role as chief of surgery, and offers Shepherd the job. Karev reveals O'Malley's death to Stevens, and Torres seeks her help in deciding whether or not to donate O'Malley's organs. Stevens opinionates that O'Malley would give all his organs, and the two come to a mutual conclusion that donation is the correct option. Prior to the harvesting of his organs, O'Malley's former mentor Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) is uneasy about donating his organs, but soon comes to terms with the situation. Several days later, at O'Malley's funeral, the woman O'Malley saved, Amanda (Shannon Lucio) is shown hysterically crying while Karev, Stevens, Meredith, and Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) are laughing‚Äîunable to deal with their true emotions. After the funeral, O'Malley's former best friend Dr. Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) is designated the job of emptying out his locker, but breaks down. Bailey subsequently discharges Stevens, and Robbins's body pain patient returns, with chronic pain, though Robbins is unable to diagnose him. Torres approaches Webber, seeking information as to whether or not her application to become an attending surgeon has been accepted. Webber explains that the job is no longer available, as the surgeon who was going to retire, ultimately did not. Torres becomes enraged, saying that the current surgeon who has the job is a dinosaur, and storms out while yelling: \\"I'm a superstar\\". The episode closes with Lexie consoling the speedboat victim, Ferguson. Production \\"Good Mourning\\" is the first episode T. R. Knight did not appear in. Zoe Boyle portrayed Clara Ferguson. \\"Good Mourning\\" was written by Krista Vernoff and directed by Ed Ornelas. Joe Mitacek edited the episode and Donald Lee Harris served as production designer. Featured music includes Sweet Honey in the Rock's \\"Wade In The Water\\" and Joy Williams's \\"Speaking A Dead Language\\". \\"Good Mourning\\" is the first episode not to feature Knight's character, George O'Malley. Knight was released from his contract at the conclusion of season 5, following a disagreement with series creator Shonda Rhimes over lack of screen-time for his character. When asked to make a 'flashback' appearance in season 6, Knight declined. Vernoff offered her thoughts on the death of O'Malley: \\"It's heartbreaking. I fell in love with George, like many of you did, in season 1. He was impulsive, big-hearted, and yeah, it's that heart that had him jump in front of a moving bus to save a life. It's a devastating end to a beloved character, but I would argue with anyone who said it wasn't a fitting end.\\" In the episode, Shepherd was offered the position of chief of surgery, but postponed his decision, due to Webber being his friend. Vernoff offered her insight on this: The scene in which O'Malley's colleagues were laughing at his funeral was one of Vernoff's favorite scenes. She added: \\"Shonda gave me smart notes that enhanced the writing and then the wonderful director Ed Ornelas and the amazing DP Herb Davis and the whole crew that support them made it visually beautiful and then the actors‚Ä¶ damn, did they all bring their A game to this scene. And then there are the editors and music folks and the people who color correct everything and mix the sound‚Ä¶ It's a collaboration. What it takes to make good TV is a huge coming together of a great many artists. What it takes to make great TV is all that plus a little magic and a little luck. And that‚Äôs what I feel like we had with this scene. It's so funny and so bittersweet and so, so sad.\\" Reception = Broadcasting = \\"Good Mourning\\" was originally broadcast on September 24, 2009, on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in the United States. It was viewed by a total of 17.04 million people, in its 9:00 Eastern time-slot. The episode was the series' second least-viewed season premiere, up to that point, just ahead of the season 1 premiere‚Äî\\"A Hard Day's Night\\". In comparison to the previous episode, \\"Good Mourning\\" made a 0.08% decrease in terms of viewership. However, the episode's viewership ranked first in both its time- slot and the entire night, beating out CBS's juggernaut CSI. In addition to being a success in viewership, the episode also did well in ratings. \\"Good Mourning\\"'s 6.7/17 Nielsen rating ranked first in its time-slot and the entire night, for both the rating and share percentages of the 18‚Äì49 demographic. The episode also received a rating of 10.9/18 in the 18-34 demographic, beating out CBS's The Mentalist, and ranking #1 in the ratings and shares for the demographic. = Critical Reception = Sara Ramirez's performance was highly praised by several critics. The episode opened to positive critical reviews, and aired back-to-back with the next episode, \\"Goodbye\\", as a 2-hour season premiere special. Alan Sepinwall of NJ.com commented on the 2 episodes being conjoined into 1 week: \\"I keep going back and forth on whether it was a good idea to do that, or if we'd have been better off spacing out the tearful speeches over 2 weeks. That isn't to say that there shouldn't have been tears, or speeches. George's death, no matter how marginal he had become last season, is and should be a huge event in the lives of these characters. Had the show raced through Elizabeth Kubler-Ross's famous 5 stages of grief, it would have rang false, as if everyone making the show was in a hurry to move past the events of the wildly-uneven fifth season. My problem is, when you put 2 episodes back-to-back, those rhythms - the pace at which the acts build to emotional crescendos and then briefly recede - start to become too predictable, and it sucks some of the life and emotion away.\\" Sepinwall also praised Wilson's, Ramirez's, and Chambers' performances, in addition to the laughing at O'Malley's funeral. Michael Pascua of The Huffington Post also praised Ramirez's performance, calling her \\"the most genuine character\\". Although he enjoyed Ramirez's performance, Pascua was critical of the rest of the episode, writing: \\"The funeral wasn't as sad as I thought it would be. There were so many pre-episode pictures up that I thought the funeral would take up half the show, then it was 5 minutes and it wasn't sad at all. The core-group walked away and Izzie spread the giggles. She laughs at the fact that she has cancer, like this was all some really badly-written show. Oh wait, it is!\\" Kelly West of TV Blend was also critical of the episode, writing: \\"I don't think based on the first episode that we can say that Grey's is headed in a new direction, nor do I think the writers are making much of an effort to bring the series back to the greatness that were its earlier seasons. That said, this is Grey's Anatomy and with that comes the usual drama, sex, love and whacky medical mysteries thrown in the mix to keep things moving. If that's what you‚Äôre looking for, I think you'll enjoy the season premiere just fine.\\" Glenn Diaz of BuddyTV noted that the special foreshadowed a \\"very dark\\" season, adding: \\"The talk between George's mom and one of the surgeons [Torres] proved to be one of the more heart-breaking scenes in an episode, that in itself is heartbreaking enough.\\" References External links *\\"Good Mourning\\" at ABC.com *\\"Good Mourning\\" at TV.com * Category:2009 American television episodes Category:Grey's Anatomy (season 6) episodes Category:Television episodes about funerals ","title":"Good Mourning (Grey's Anatomy)"},{"id":"32089331","text":"Camp Methodist Church Camp is an unincorporated community in Fulton County, Arkansas, United States.

The episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 13, 2011. The episode was written by Holly Schlesinger and directed by Boohwan Lim. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed by 4.10 million viewers in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Melissa Bardin Galsky and Larry Murphy. Plot Linda arrives back at the restaurant after shopping for materials for a bed and breakfast she is going to operate out of the Belchers' apartment. Bob disagrees with this business venture, not only because his children have to move into his room so that the customers can sleep in their rooms, but also because Linda puts in all of her efforts to entertain guests, and if Linda feels her efforts are not appreciated enough, she snaps. Linda becomes angry and she denies Bob's claims, saying she is a very good hostess. Tina and Gene have to move into their parents' room, so that the guests can sleep in the children's rooms. An Indian-British entomologist named Javed Fazel (Larry Murphy) sleeps in Tina's room, while Ed Samuels and his wife Nora (Melissa Bardin Galsky) sleep in Gene's room. Linda forces the guests to participate in bed and breakfast events such as telling each other embarrassing moments. However, Javed, Ed and Nora aren't enjoying it, and wish they were at a different bed and breakfast. Linda is annoyed by the guests' incompetence, while Louise is happily going to sleep in her room on her own. The next morning, Bob is relieved to get back to work to avoid the guests, and talks to Teddy about it. Teddy praises the bed and breakfast to Linda and she suggests that he should be her guest (and the only perfect guest) by using Louise's room as his room. Bob is unsure about Louise's reaction to it, as she would possibly murder Bob and Linda, explaining that at one time when Linda vacuumed in there, she refused to talk to both Bob and Linda for over a week. Linda moves Teddy into Louise's room and Louise loses her temper, meanwhile Linda drags Louise over the floor and Louise says to Teddy, \\"I will see you in Hell, Teddy, I will see you in Hell!\\" as she vows vengeance to Teddy. During a wine and cheese mix, Linda forces Javed to join but he has to watch his insects mate with the queen (Tina comes along with him to watch) and Louise threatens Teddy that he has one hour to leave her room or she'll retaliate. An hour later, Louise sprays Javed's synthetic queen beetle pheromones on Teddy's pillow while a surprised Linda discovers the Samuels are performing BDSM in bed. While her family is asleep, Louise sneaks out of the bedroom (having spent some time standing over the bed) and releases Javed's beetles into Teddy's room. Teddy wakes up, unaware of the beetles covering his face, and scares the family and Javed with his appearance. Linda blames Louise for the incident and grounds her, sending her to Linda's room and locking the door. Teddy barely reacts to it, mentioning that his only fear is of costumed characters, due to an incident where a man dressed up as a seal was having an affair with his ex-wife. Louise overhears what Teddy said through the air vent and calls a costumed character company to order dozens of them to arrive at the restaurant. Linda upgrades Teddy to platinum status, locks the other guests inside their rooms (the Samuels were going to leave) until her ice cream social, and orders Bob to make a bacon burger for Teddy. The costumed characters arrive at the restaurant, causing a terrified Teddy to beat them up. Bob settles it and explains the incident to Linda, and reprimands her for locking the unappreciative guests in their rooms. However, Linda reveals that she lost the key. Knowing she picks locks, Linda apologizes to Louise, and asks her to unlock the guests' doors. Louise unlocks Javed's room (who is unaware that the door was locked the whole time), and Linda discovers that the Samuels are stuck after attempting to climb down out of the window. Linda helps them in, though only after forcing them to leave their e-mail addresses and recommend the bed and breakfast to their friends. Everything becomes settled as the guests leave, the costumed characters leave and also get paid by Bob, and Teddy overcomes his fears by going out with an owl costumed person (whom he first thinks to be a woman, but is really a man). Reception In its original American broadcasting, \\"Bed and Breakfast\\" was viewed by an estimated 4.10 million viewers and received a 2.5 rating/7% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, a drop from the last episode. Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode B+, saying \\"Remember back at the very beginning of The Simpsons, when Bart was the main character? He got all the t-shirts, he got all the catch-phrases, and who could forget this on their Top 40 radio stations? Rather quickly, the Simpsons' creative team realized that Homer, not Bart, was their star. Something similar might be happening with Bob's Burgers, where Bob, who is not in any way a bad character, is typically overshadowed by his ridiculously funny children.

He broke the pole vault world record in 1932 and competed at the 1932 and 1936 Olympics, placing fourth and fifth, respectively. Athletic career Graber studied at the University of Southern California (USC), where he was coached by Dean Cromwell. As a sophomore in 1931 Graber won the pole vault at the IC4A championships and tied for first at the NCAA championships, helping the USC Trojans to team titles in both meets. At the IC4A meet in Philadelphia men's pole vault was the last event and Graber's meeting record of 14 ft in (4.28 m) secured the Trojans a narrow victory over Stanford University. Graber was only the fifth athlete in the world to jump 14 feet or more in a competition, and the only one to do so that year. Graber's NCAA jump of 13 ft in (4.22 m) was also a meeting record; the Trojans won that team title by a much more comfortable margin, scoring a record points and beating Ohio State by 46 points. Graber repeated as IC4A champion 1932, although this time he only tied for first. He was unable to defend his NCAA title as the Trojans didn't compete in that meet. The American team for the Olympics in Los Angeles was selected at the Olympic Trials in Palo Alto, with the top three qualifying. Both Graber and Stanford's Bill Miller cleared 14 ft in (4.31 m), a fraction of an inch better than Lee Barnes's world record of 14 ft in (4.30 m). Graber then cleared 14 ft in (4.37 m) to obliterate the record; he said afterwards \\"it was the first time this year that I have been able to follow one good vault with another.\\" The record established Graber as the leading favorite for the Olympics, but he underperformed and only jumped 13 ft in (4.15 m), placing fourth behind Miller, Japan's Shuhei Nishida and the other American entrant, George Jefferson. Graber won his third IC4A title in 1933 in a five-way tie for first place. He also tied for first place at the NCAA meet, jumping 13 ft in (4.24 m) to break his own meeting record. In 1934 he was national champion indoors and tied for the title outdoors. He almost broke his own world record in April 1935 at Santa Barbara, clearing a bar supposedly at 14 ft in (4.41 m), but it was subsequently found that the take-off point had been two inches (5 cm) higher than the point of measurement and the record could not be ratified. Entering the Olympic year of 1936, Graber was considered a leading candidate for his second Olympic Games. At the Olympic Trials at Randalls Island in New York City he cleared 14 ft 3 in (4.34 m), tying for first place with Bill Sefton and Earle Meadows. Meadows and Sefton both being USC undergraduates, it was the first time in the history of the Trials that one university had claimed the top three. George Varoff, who had been the favorite after breaking the world record the previous week, only cleared 14 ft (4.26 m) and didn't qualify for the team. Graber was again a leading Olympic favorite, but again he failed to medal; at the Olympics he only managed 13 ft in (4.15 m) and placed 5th.

It is said that they originated in the city of Monterrey in the Mexican state of Nuevo Le√≥n. The pointy boots have risen to popularity at the same time as \\"Trance music\\" and the boots have become a preferred footwear for the all-male troupes that dance to the electronic music.

Following their creation, the trend had expanded to parts of the United States where large numbers of Monterreyen migrants live, particularly in Dallas, Texas, but also in Tennessee, Mississippi and Oklahoma.  Design  The pointy boots are made by elongating the toe of normal boots by as much as , causing the toes to curl up toward the knees. The boots are then further modified according to the wearer's personal taste. Alterations incorporate paint and sequins and can go as far as adding flashing LED lights, disco balls and even mirrors.

Much later Suquamish was converted to a commercial fishing vessel and was registered as a Canadian vessel under the name Terry. Nomenclature Suquamish was named after the town of Suquamish, which in turn was named after the Suquamish tribe, whose most famous member was Chief Seattle. Suquamish was also known as ‚ÄúHyak's pup‚Äù, after a much larger steamboat of the Kitsap County Navigation Company. Design and construction Suquamish was designed by Lee and Brinton and built at the John Wilson shipyard in Seattle. Suquamish was of all wooden construction, long, beam, depth of hold, a draft, 75 gross tons and 51 registered tons.Newell, ed., McCurdy Marine History, at page 237. Suquamish cost $24,704 to construct.Public Service Comm'n vs. Anderson Steamboat Co., Case No. 4348, published in Eighth Annual Report of the Public Service Comm'n of Washington (1918), at page 150. (accessed 06-06-11).U.S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Navigation, Annual List of Merchant Vessels of the United States (1922) The vessel carried 180 passengers. In 1922 Suquamish was reported as requiring a crew of five. As built, propulsion was provided by a 180-horsepower Nelseco four-cycle, six-cylinder, vertical single-acting diesel engine, built by the New London Ship & Engine Building Company, of Groton, Connecticut. The engine ran at 350 revolutions per minute, giving the vessel a speed of 14 miles per hour. The cost for fuel and lubricating oil averaged only 24 cents per hour. Suquamish carried a supply of fuel oil for two weeks, although there was space for a month's supply. Only one man was required for handling the engine, although on account of the fact that the vessel was in operation from 6 am to 8 pm., two engineers were required to stand alternate watches.International Marine Engineering, Vol 20, (October 1915), at page 469 (accessed 06-14-11). Ceremonial launching Aware of the significance of the name, Warren L. Gazzam (1864-1861), president of the Kitsap County Transportation Company invited members of the Suquamish nation as well as pioneer settlers to the launching on April 28, 1914, which included an address in Chinook Jargon. The vessel was christened by Blanche Thompson, a great-great-granddaughter of Chief Seattle.  Career Suquamish was built for and originally owned by the Kitsap County Transportation Company (‚ÄúKCTC‚Äù), which operated the vessel between Pier 3, Seattle (now Pier 54) and Poulsbo, Washington, making three round trips a day, with 14 landings on each trip. These 42 daily landings tested the endurance of the boat, as the clutch and reverse gears were constantly in use at these landings and the vessel was worked many times under the strain of a spring line tied to the wharves. In 1915, it was reported that Suquamish was satisfactory and economical as compared with the steam-driven KCTC vessels. The vessel was re-engined in 1922 with 125 horsepower Gulowsen- Grei diesel.Newell, ed., McCurdy Marine History, at page 327. In 1923, KCTC had Suquamish on the Fletcher-Bay-Brownsville-Manzanita route.Kline and Bayless, Ferryboats ‚Äì A Legend on Puget Sound, at page 111. In 1930, the Puget Sound Navigation Company (‚ÄúPSN‚Äù), the dominant passenger and ferry concern on Puget Sound, secured a mail contract for the San Juan Islands. PSN put the steamers Monticello and Mohawk on the route, but there wasn't enough business to sustain two steamers of their size, and so PSN secured the use of Suquamish from KCTC. Suquamish was placed on a route running from Bellingham to San Juan Island, where it made a connection with Mohawk. Suquamish was also used on holiday excursions. The mail contract expired in December 1930, and Suquamish was returned to KCTC.Newell, ed., McCurdy Marine History, at page 400. Suquamish was out of service and idle from about 1931 to 1938. In 1935, PSN acquired KCTC and the entire KCTC fleet, including Suquamish. PSN sold Suquamish to the Lake Washington Shipyard, which in turn, in late 1938, sold Suquamish to R.G. Gibson.

They are the oldest registered LGBT-specific charity in Canada, becoming registered in 1984. The organization serves gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, Two-Spirit, non- binary, queer, questioning, intersex, asexual, QTBIPoC (queer, trans, black, indigenous, people of colour), of all ages within the National Capital Region. They provide a number of services including support groups, education, research, advocacy and community space. Organization history One of the founding members of Kind Space (PTS), Barry Deeprose in 2002 wrote a history of the organization. The forwards starts off as: :\\"In 1984 a group of directors from the Board of Gays of Ottawa set out to create a non-profit organization with charitable status called Pink Triangle Services in the hopes that such recognition would enable an organization to more-easily raise funds. In the spring of that year the corporation was founded and was granted charitable status under the Income Tax Act, a first for Canada. In the ensuing fifteen years Pink Triangle Services (or PTS as it quickly became known) has flourished and grown, in many ways fulfilling the vision of the founding members. :Those fifteen years also brought tremendous changes to the gay and lesbian community. AIDS decimated a generation of gay men, while at the same time in Canada gays and lesbians won legal rights of which an earlier generation scarcely dreamed. I have had the privilege of being associated with PTS from the beginning and it remains close to my heart. There is no doubt in my mind that it continues to provide much-needed services to the gay, lesbian, and bisexual community.\\" Until the 2000s Kind Space was run by a working Board of Directors and was funded primarily by individual donations from those communities. Starting in the 2000s the organizational structure changed to become a policy and governance Board of Directors while the first agency Executive Director was hired. Another major change that occurred in the 2000s was more focus was attributed to less served members of the community including bisexuals, trans people and those who solely identify as queer. This was also influenced by the decrease of stigma towards gays and lesbians in the broader community that lead to a court ruling making same-sex marriage in Ontario legal in 2003. A bisexual women's group started at KInd Space which evolved into BiAmore for bisexuals of all genders years later. And in 2004 Trans Youth Ottawa started a group for transgender and transsexual youth and young adults which ran until 2009 and Gender Quest a group for all trans adults started in 2005 and still operates today. In 2005 the board of directors added trans, two-spirit and queer to the letters patent to state their official commitment to those communities. = Rebranding and Restructuring = After years of financial troubles which resulted in the temporary layoff of the organizations executive director, Kind Space began to restructure the organization and repair its reputation. In 2015, Kind Space won a 100,000 rebranding package from Stiff and changed its name from Pink Triangle Services - PTS to Kind Space. Following the rebranding, the organization partnered with Planned Parenthood Ottawa to share office space. In 2017, the organization celebrated being debt free for the first time in several years.  Programs and services  The programs of Kind Space offers support, education, and resource programs. =Support programs= Historically flagship programs of Kind Space are peer support groups. Over the years Kind Space has seen many groups come and go based upon need. Current support groups include: * QTY ‚Äì Queer Trans Youth: A peer-led discussion and support group for LGBTTQIA youth, ages 25 and under. * Cafe Q: A low-pressure hangout space, participants enjoy them during board games, video games, and lounging on couches. * High School Student Alliance: Focused on empowering youth to make systemic change within schools, that is reflective of their needs as queer and trans youth. * The Men's Group: This peer-led social group is for men of all ages, cultures, abilities, and orientations. * QPoC-It: A space to celebrate the diversity of our cultures and have our voices speak out about the concerns of QTBIPoC * Polybilities: This is an open forum for exploring relationship dynamics beyond the standard societal norms. * BiAmore: A comfortable space to gather and talk about issues related to being bisexual, pansexual, bi-curious and questioning. * Gender Quest: This is a diverse, peer-led support group for those at any stage of transition. * Ace/Aro Spectrum: For anyone questioning their identity as asexual, aromantic, demisexual, demiromantic, greysexual, or elsewhere within the spectrum. =Educational programs= Historically, Kind Space has focused on education and advocacy work since its founding. Financial troubles have previously restricted Kind Space's education program, however the program has recently been revitalized. Skills for the Revolution, a grassroots, peer-led program aimed at empowering and equipping is aimed at helping queer and trans communities build knowledge and hands on experience of fundamental life, advocacy, and community-building skills to deconstruct oppressive structures. This program centres healing, emotional, and restorative justice. =Resource programs= Kind Space offers several resources: * Dr. Kelly McGinnis Library, which offers a large selection of queer and trans specific literature. * Space Rentals * Celebrating Self * Support in accessing other community resources * Referrals * Letters Of Support ‚Äì Refugee Hearings * Manajiwin ‚Äì Body-Positive Fitness  References  Category:LGBT community centres in Canada Category:LGBT culture in Ottawa Category:Organizations based in Ottawa Category:Charities based in Canada ","title":"Kind Space"},{"id":"32089748","text":"Jan Pisk√°ƒçek (born September 11, 1989) is a Czech professional ice hockey defenceman.

Fadda's lineage, the most prominent second to the Carlos Gracie lineage, still survives through his links with today's teams such as Nova Uni√£o, Grappling Fight Team,Jiu Jitsu, BJJ Heroes as well as Deo Jiu- Jitsu (Deoclecio Paulo) and Equipe Mestre Wilson Jiu-Jitsu (Wilson Pereira Mattos). Biography =Early life= Fadda was born in Bento Ribeiro, a suburb in the north of Rio de Janeiro to a family of Sardinian immigrants from Ardauli, Sardinia. At the age of seventeen, while in the Brazilian Marines, he began to study jiu jitsu under Luiz Fran√ßa, a black belt under Mitsuyo Maeda. Maeda was an expert jud≈çka with direct lineage to the founder of judo, Kan≈ç Jigor≈ç, who had travelled around the world as a prize fighter while also teaching the locals his self-defence techniques. After settling in Bel√©m in 1917, Maeda had continued to teach jiu jitsu to a select group of students (including Fran√ßa and Carlos Gracie). By 1942, Gracie Jiu-Jitsu was becoming well known in Brazil, although the price of tuition was too high for most residents of Rio. Fadda had received his own black belt from Fran√ßa and soon started teaching jiu jitsu free of charge in unorthodox locations such as public parks and beaches, often without the aid of crash mats, aiming to spread the art of jiu-jitsu to the poorer folk. Fadda also saw jiu-jitsu as a way to help people with physical or mental disabilities, especially the city's numerous polio victims. With no real income from his teaching he was forced to advertise in the obituary section of the local newspaper. Despite being regarded by the Gracie family as an outcast, Fadda managed to open his own academy on the outskirts of Rio on January 27, 1950. He and his students began specialising in the use of footlocks, an often ignored part of the jiu-jitsu curriculum. =Challenge to the Gracie school= In 1955, Fadda felt confident that his school was ready for the next step and issued a challenge to the Gracies through the media: \\"We wish to challenge the Gracies, we respect them as the formidable adversaries they are but we do not fear them. We have 20 pupils ready for the challenge\\". H√©lio Gracie accepted the challenge and the two teams fought at Gracie's academy. What transpired at the challenge, however, is a cause of dissension among sources. According to a newspaper, 14 fights took place, with 7 wins for Gracie's academy, 4 draws and 3 wins for Fadda's academy.Academia Gracie vs Academia Fada: the actual results at Diario da Noite, January 24th, 1955. According to other sources,Marcial Serrano, O Livro Proibido do Jiu Jitsu Volume 3 among them Reila Gracie's biography of Carlos Gracie,Reila Gracie, Criador de uma Dinastia - Carlos Gracie Sr., 2008 Fadda's team emerged victorious, making good use of their knowledge of footlocks in which the opposition was lacking. Also, Jos√© Guimar√£es, one of Fadda's pupils, choked Gracie's \\"Leonidas\\" unconscious. =Second challenge to the Gracie school= The next year, at the low card of the event which hosted one of the matches between Valdemar Santana and Carlson Gracie, the two schools competed again against each other.Extracted from O Globo This time, the Gracie students were wary of their footlock expertise, shouting derisively \\"sapateiro!\\" (\\"shoemaker!\\") whenever a Fadda student tried one of their foot techniques. Nonetheless, the Fadda academy won the contest without controversy. After the challenge, Fadda said an interview for the Revista do Esporte: \\"We put an end to the Gracie taboo\\".Headlines of the event =Later life= Oswaldo Fadda attained the rank of ninth degree red belt. The 9th degree red belt is the highest rank awarded to any currently living practitioner of Brazilian jiu-jitsu. The red belt was given only to the pioneers of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and the Gracie brothers: Carlos, Oswaldo, George, Gaston and Helio. Ever humble, he lived out the rest of his life in his Bento Ribeiro suburban home, suffering from Alzheimer's disease in his later years. He died of pneumonia on April 1, 2005 at the age of 84.  The Fadda family  After immigrating from Ardauli, Sardinia to Minas Gerais, Brazil, Oswaldo's father, Battista Fadda, Brazilianized his name to Jo√£o Baptista Fadda; and added the \\"Baptista Fadda\\" to all his children's names. Oswaldo Fadda's brother Humberto was also a jiu-jitsu instructor and ran the Cascadura branch of Academia Fadda. The Fadda family is represented in today's jiu-jitsu by Master H√©lio Fadda, the son of Humberto Fadda who was named after H√©lio Gracie.H√©lio Fadda √© homenageado no Rio at Revista Tatame In 2009, an event was held in Paracambi in honour of H√©lio Fadda.Alexandre Paiva at BJJ Heroes Lineage Kano Jigoro ‚Üí Tomita Tsunejiro ‚Üí Mitsuyo Maeda ‚Üí Luiz Fran√ßa ‚Üí Oswaldo Fadda See also *List of Brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioners References Category:Brazilian practitioners of Brazilian jiu-jitsu Category:2005 deaths Category:1921 births Category:Sportspeople from Rio de Janeiro (city) Category:Brazilian people of Italian descent Category:Brazilian male judoka Category:Martial arts school founders ","title":"Oswaldo Fadda"},{"id":"32089829","text":"Casey Bond (born October 5, 1984) is an American actor, film producer and retired professional baseball player. He is most noted for playing Chad Bradford in the 2011 film Moneyball. Before becoming an actor, Bond played as an outfielder within the San Francisco Giants organization. Bond attended Birmingham‚ÄìSouthern College and Lipscomb University, playing college baseball for both schools, before he was drafted by the Giants in 2007. After playing in minor league baseball for two seasons, the Giants released Bond in 2009. Rather than continue to pursue his baseball career, Bond chose to become an actor. In addition to Moneyball, Bond has appeared in Nashville, Ring the Bell, Undrafted, My Many Sons, I Saw the Light, Gene Simmons Family Jewels and various other films and commercials.

After his junior year at Birmingham-Southern, the school's president decided to move the Panthers' athletic programs from Division I to Division III, which required the team to take a hiatus for a season. This ultimately ended the baseball program at Birmingham-Southern as most players left to find a new program where they would be able to continue their college careers. Bond transferred to Lipscomb University in Nashville, Tennessee, where he continued his college baseball career with the Lipscomb Bisons baseball team, competing in the Atlantic Sun Conference in NCAA's Division I. In his senior year, Bond started all 58 games on the Bisons' schedule and finished the season with a .326 batting average. He registered the tenth-most hits and third-most stolen bases in Lipscomb history for a single-season. The San Francisco Giants drafted Bond as a center fielder in the 25th round of the 2007 Major League Baseball Draft. They had intended to draft Bond in the 24th round, but instead selected Brock Bond, a second baseman from the University of Missouri, due to a clerical error. Bond played in the Giants' minor league system for two seasons. He debuted in professional baseball for the Arizona Giants of the Rookie-level Arizona League in 2007. Bond played for the Salem-Keizer Volcanoes of the Class A-Short Season Northwest League in 2008, where he had a .246 batting average and 15 stolen bases in 68 games played.

As Bond considered whether or not to sign with another baseball team after being released by the Giants, the agent set Bond up with an audition for a television commercial for One-A-Day Men's Vitamins. Bond flew to Los Angeles and was cast in the commercial. Becoming a member of the Screen Actors Guild, Bond next appeared as the \\"Handsome Handyman\\" in Gene Simmons Family Jewels before being given a role in Moneyball. Bond was cast in the 2011 film Moneyball as Chad Bradford, a submarine-style pitcher. Bond contacted Ben Zobrist, who he had previously worked out with and who was a former teammate of Bradford's, and Zobrist introduced them. Bond has taken acting classes with Larry Moss. He has appeared on the hit television show Nashville as \\"Gil Martin.\\" It has been released that Bond is slated to play the role of \\"Tommy Dorehty\\" in the upcoming film Undrafted,\\" which will be released sometime next year. It has also been rumored and confirmed that Bond is attached to play the role of \\"Country\\" in the film titled Diamonds Down Under. He has also appeared in commercials for Dick's Sporting Goods, Adidas, Nike, Inc., Blue Bunny, and others. Bond has formed his own production company, called Higher Purpose Entertainment, and is producing an independent film about Lipscomb Bisons men's basketball coach Don Meyer under the working title My Many Sons, along with production partner Brad Wilson. He is expected to have a role in the movie. Bond has been cast to play the lead role of Jerry Meyer in the film, son of Coach Meyer, played by Judge Reinhold.

The Greninger chart is a simple trigonometric tool to determine g and d for a fixed sample-to-film distance. (If one uses a 2-d detector the problem of determining g and d could be solved mathematically using the equations which generate the Greninger chart) A new chart must be generated for different sample to detector distances. (2s is 2q for the diffraction peak and tan m is x/y for the Cartesian coordinates of the diffraction peak.) The Greninger chart gives directly the two angles needed to plot poles on the Wulff net.

He used architect Mecca Masjid of Hyderabad and royal architect of Sultan Abdullah Qutub Shah. There is a chapter in the royal records called the \\"Gulzar-e-Asafia.\\" It mentions that when the royal architect was building Mecca Masjid, he was given one damri/damdi (coin) out of every rupee spent on it. The sum of money thus collected was used by Musa Khan to construct the Toli Masjid. Hence, this masjid is also called Damri Masjid.Toli Masjid in Hyderabad India Architecture Detailed stucco work on the front facade The mosque is built on a raised platform with a high plinth, divided into two halls, the outer one having five-arched openings, among five outer arches the central arch is the largest and most decorated. The central arch is a bit wider and more ornate than the remaining four. The inscription in the prayer hall reveals that Musa Khan (who played an important role in the accession of the last Qutb Shahi Sultan, Abul Hasan Qutb Shah to the throne of Golconda) built the mosque. The Musa Burj (bastion) of the Golconda fort is also his work.

Telling fictional stories of the United States Navy, it was a sister title of the other Charlton war comics Fightin' Army, Fightin' Air Force, and Fightin' Marines. Regular contributors to Fightin' Navy included penciler Bill Molno and inker Vince Alascia, both of whom worked on the book during nearly all of its run. Other notable contributors included the Charlton regulars Ken Battefield, Sam Glanzman, Joe Gill, Dick Giordano, Rocke Mastroserio, Charles Nicholas, and Tony Tallarico. Editor Pat Masulli helmed the book for most of its run.  Publication history  As with many comic book titles published at the time, Fightin' Navy did not start with issue number one; it was a renaming of a series called Don Winslow of the Navy, which published four issues, numbered #70‚Äì73, from March‚ÄìSeptember 1955. (The Don Winslow title originated with Fawcett Comics, which published 69 issues from 1943 ‚Äî 1951.) The first issue of Fightin' Navy was #74, published in January 1956. Early issues sported the tagline \\"Exciting Sea Battle Stories.\\" The title ceased publication with issue #125, dated May 1966. Nearly twenty years later, in August 1983, Charlton briefly revived Fightin' Navy, publishing reprints from previous issues as well as the former Charlton titles Navy War Heroes and Submarine Attack, in issues #126‚Äì133. Finally, in October 1984, as the entire Charlton line ceased publishing,\\"Charlton Comics Suspends Publication,\\" The Comics Journal #94 (Oct. 1984), p. 18. Fightin' Navy was cancelled. Altogether, the title published 60 issues.  Features  Almost all of the stories in Fightin' Navy take place during World War II, telling tales of American ships battling the Japanese and the Germans.

The temple is dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. The Thai Poosam festival celebrated in January is an important event for Hindus.  Temple history and design This is an ancient temple built by Parantaka Chola who reigned from c. 907 to c. 955. = Founding = In earlier days, the place was a forest of Kadamba trees. In legend, a trader on his way had to stay here at a night. About midnight, he saw a fire ball splitting light, in the midst of which was a Shivalinga being worshipped by Devas and Rishis. The trader informed the Chola king of what he saw. The Chola king rushed to the spot, along with Kulasekhara Pandiyan, who was his guest then. They saw an old man walking there with a red sugarcane as his walking stick. He showed the king the place where the Shivalinga was hiding and disappeared in the form of a fire ball. When they looked in an easterly direction where the old man disappeared, they saw Lord Dhandayuthapani on a hill. In ecstasy, the kings built a temple for Lord Ekambareswara and a temple for Lord Dhandayuthapani, according to the history of the place. = Design= The temple is famous for its Kubera sculpture showing the Lord of Wealth on His Fish vehicle, installed in 12 places in the temple to represent the 12 signs of the zodiac. When viewed from an elevated position, it is said that the idols combined together looks like the OHM letter shape. According to Vedic scholars from Tiruvannamalai, no temple in India has such Kubera installations. People come to the temple to worship Kubera for wealth. There are 10 pillars in the inner corridor (prakara) of the temple producing 10 different musical sounds if tapped with a dry sandal stick. There is a Vinayaka shrine in the west hall of the western corridor. Lord Vinayaka is adored as Varaguna Ganapathi. Lord Varaguna Ganapathi graces in the inner corridor with the five headed NƒÅga (snake). Lord Muruga graces with His consorts Valli and Deivanai holding His Vel in a Vel shaped frame. The shrine of Mother Kamakshi is on the northern side-Kubera corner. There is also a sculptural marvel in the temple on the western Dwarapalaka pillar carved with such rare skill, having a sculpture of one head showing both a bull and elephant when looked at from different angles. The main tower, Rajagopuram, is 100 feet tall visible up to a distance of 10 kilometers. The rays of Sun fall on Lord Ekambareswara on 19, 20 and 21 of Panguni month (March-April). =Kuberar temple= The Kuberar temple is inside the compound of Ekambareswarar temple and was built in 2012 by Mr M. Ramasamy, Additional Inspector General of Registration (Retd) who was born in Chettikulam, and his wife Shakunthala Ramasamy. Lord Kubera is the leader of Yatchars who are here to help mankind and procure wealth. Kubera is very much devoted to Shiva. Kubera's wife's name is Chitrakala. Father -Viswara and mother Swathi. Kubera is assisted by sanganidhi and padmanidhi to offer wealth to mankind. The Kubera has control over nine Nidhis. Lord Balaji borrowed money from Kubera for his marriage as a loan. Kubera performed severe penances invoking the blessings of Shiva. Shiva gave darshan to Kubera with his wife Parvathi. Shiva rewarded Kubera by the following: 1.One of the guards of eight dishas guarding northern disha 2\\\\. The lord of wealth and material 3.King of Alagapuri 4.Friendship of Shiva And hence doing pooja to Kubera will enrich one's life. The most auspicious period to worship Kubera is on Thursdays between 15 October and 15 November each year. Chettikulam Kubera is sitting with his wife Chitrakala on fish and also with nine Nidhis to bless devotees.  Festivals  The ten-day Thaipoosam and Brahmmotsavam in January-February is the longest and important festival of the temple with special pujas and the presiding deity coming in car procession. On the 9th day, Panchamurthis and Mother Kamakshi come in procession in two separate Rathas in the streets of Chettikulam. Aadipooram in July-August, Vinayaka Chaturthi in August- September, Navarathri in September-October, Surasamharam and Deepavali in October-November, Tirukarthikai in November-December, Margazhi festival and Tirvadhirai in December-January, Sivarathri in February-March and Chitra Poornima in April-May are other festivals celebrated in the temple. Monthly Pradosham days, 13th day either from New Moon or Full Moon day, Pongal falling mostly on 14 January, Tamil and English New Year days are other festive days of special pujas to Lord and Mother drawing huge crowd. Prayers and thanksgiving  A huge number of devotees pray to Kubera, the Lord of Wealth seeking prosperity, besides seeking fruitful marriage talks and child boon. The temple is highly revered as an abode of solution for various problems faced by devotees in matters of health, litigations, recovery of lost things, trade etc. Devotees perform special abishek (thanksgiving) to Lord and Mother with milk, curd, lime fruit juice, sandal, oil, green coconut offering vastras and they also undertake some kind of fasting. Some do charities. The nivedhana offered to Lord and Mother is distributed to the devotees.

The area of the district is . Its administrative center is the urban locality (an urban-type settlement) of Bereznik. Population: The population of Bereznik accounts for 35.9% of the district's total population. Etymology The district is named after Pavlin Vinogradov, a Bolshevik and an active participant of the October Revolution and the Russian Civil War. In 1918, Vinogradov was sent to Arkhangelsk and eventually charged with the organization of the Bolshevik resistance to British and American troops. Vinogradov died in combat at the village of Shidrovo, now within the area of the district. History The area was originally populated by the Finno-Ugric peoples and then colonized by the Novgorod Republic. After the fall of Novgorod, the area became a part of the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Historically, it was a part of Vazhsky Uyezd, a vast area including almost all of the river basin of the Vaga. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, the area was included into Archangelgorod Governorate. In 1780, the governorate was abolished and transformed into Vologda Viceroyalty. Vazhsky Uyezd was split, and the area of the current Vinogradovsky District became a part of the newly established Shenkursky Uyezd. In 1796, Shenkursky Uyezd was transferred to Arkhangelsk Governorate. The area was known as Podvinsky Stan. During the Russian Civil War, battles between British and American troops and the Bolshevik troops took place on the territory of the modern district. The battles also involved the Northern Dvina Flotilla, which acted on the Northern Dvina. Shenkursky Uyezd remained in Arkhangelsk Governorate until 1929, when several governorates were merged into Northern Krai. On July 15, 1929, the uyezds were abolished, and Shenkursky Uyezd was split into Shenkursky, Bereznikovsky, and Rovdinsky Districts. Bereznikovsky District became a part of Nyandoma Okrug of Northern Krai. In the following years, the first-level administrative division of Russia kept changing. In 1930, the okrug was abolished, and the district was subordinated to the central administration of Northern Krai. In 1936, the krai itself was transformed into Northern Oblast. In 1937, Northern Oblast was split into Arkhangelsk Oblast and Vologda Oblast. In 1940, Bereznikovsky District was renamed Vinogradovsky District and remained in Arkhangelsk Oblast ever since. Geography The district is located on both banks of the Northern Dvina; the left-bank part of the district is considerably smaller than the right-bank one. The whole of the district belongs to the basins of the Northern Dvina River and its major tributaries. The main tributaries of the Northern Dvina within the district are the Vaga (left) and the Vayenga (right). The eastern part of the district belongs to the basin of the Pinega via its major left tributaries, the Yula and the Pokshenga. Almost the whole of the district is covered by coniferous forests (taiga). The exception are the meadows in the floodplains. Divisions =Administrative divisions= As an administrative division, the district is divided into thirteen selsoviets and one urban-type settlement with jurisdictional territory (Bereznik). One locality which previously had urban-type settlement status, Rochegda, was downgraded in status to that of a rural locality in 2005. The following selsoviets have been established (the administrative centers are given in parentheses): *Boretsky (Gridinskaya) *Kitsky (Vazhsky) *Konetsgorsky (Konetsgorye) *Morzhegorsky (Rodionovskaya) *Osinovsky (Osinovo) *Rochegodsky (Rochegda) *Selmengsky (Selmenga) *Shastozyorsky (Uyta) *Shidrovsky (Shidrovo) *Topetsky (Topsa) *Ust-Vayengsky (Ust-Vayenga) *Vayengsky (Vorontsy) *Zaostrovsky (Yakovlevskaya) =Municipal divisions= As a municipal division, the district is divided into one urban settlement and eight rural settlements (the administrative centers are given in parentheses): *Bereznikovskoye Urban Settlement (Bereznik) *Boretskoye Rural Settlement (Selmenga) *Kitskoye Rural Settlement (Vazhsky) *Morzhegorskoye Rural Settlement (Khetovo) *Osinovskoye Rural Settlement (Osinovo) *Rochegodskoye Rural Settlement (Rochegda) *Shidrovskoye Rural Settlement (Shidrovo) *Ust-Vayengskoye Rural Settlement (Ust-Vayenga) *Zaostrovskoye Rural Settlement (Yakovlevskaya) Economy =Industry= The basis of the economy of the district is timber industry, which in 2010 was responsible for 95% of the district production. Food industry, including milk production, is also developed to some extent. =Agriculture= Agriculture specializations include cattle production, as well as growing of potatoes and vegetables. Agriculture in the district suffered heavily from the economic crisis of the 1990s, from which it has not recovered. =Transportation= One of the principal highways in Russia, M8 connecting Moscow and Arkhangelsk, crosses the district from south to north. The Northern Dvina and the Vaga are navigable within the boundaries of the district. Culture and recreation The district contains twelve objects classified as cultural and historical heritage by the Russian Federal law, and additionally seventy-one objects classified as cultural and historical heritage of local importance. Most of these are wooden rural houses, churches, and bridges built prior to 1917. Of the four ensembles protected at the federal level only one survives, *Seletsky Pogost is an all-wooden ensemble of St. Iliya Church (1798), Church of the Erection of the Cross (1802‚Äì1808), and the bell-tower (1800). *Kalezhsky Pogost was an ensemble of two wooden churches - St. Nicholas Church (1773), St. Demetrius Church (1890), as well as the wooden bell-tower (1745), in the village of Kalyi. Burned down in 2006, it no longer exists. *Church of the Nativity of the Theotokos (1726) in the village of Yakovlevskaya. Burned down in 1989, it no longer exists. *The ensemble of wooden St. Joachim and St. Anna Church (1726) and St. Vasily Church (1700); no longer exists. The only museum in the district is Vinogradovsky District Museum in Bereznik, open in 1970.

Palazzo dell'Arengo is a monumental palace located on Piazza Arringo, also called Piazza dell'Arengo (Square of the People's Assembly), in the town-center of Ascoli Piceno, Marche, central Italy. The facades of the Duomo of Ascoli Piceno, the Baptistry of San Giovanni Battista, and the Episcopal palace also face the square, which is now decorated with two oval fountains. History The structure is formed by the fusion two distinct buildings, the Palazzo del Comune with its ground floor arched portico built during the 12th to 14th centuries, and the Arringo built in the late 12th century. During the 15th century, both palaces were acquired by the Apostolic Camera, which converted this to the seat of the papal governor of the city, a function it served until 1564. In 1610 Giambattista Cavagna, architect of the Sanctuary of Loreto, refitted the buildings with a common fa√ßade, although the works started only in 1695 under a renewed design by Giuseppe Giosafatti, and was complete only in 1745. The palace's fa√ßade was erected with travertine blocks, with a five-arcaded portico in the center supported by rusticated pilasters. The upper stories have idiosyncratic window frames. The first floor has alternating rounded and triangular window pediments supported by female caryatids, while the upper floor has male atlases supporting ionic capital volutes. The lower portal gives access to the 13th century main hall: this is a three-nave room with eight bays covered by cross-vaults, supported by cylindrical columns. It was known as fondachi, and was used by the Ascoli citizens as judiciary hall, market and storage hall. The section of the former Palazzo Arringo contains the Pinacoteca Civica (Municipal Art Gallery). This portion of the building was refurbished in the 17th and 18th centuries. The gallery was instituted in 1861 after the suppression of the religious orders led to the central concentration of many works of art.Tourism guide by the Province of the Marche.

He served as a professor and rector at Lund University. During 1833-59, he led the restoration work of Lund Cathedral. Rydbeck, p. 506 Biography Brunius was born at Tanum parish in Tanum Municipality in V√§stra G√∂taland County, Sweden. He was the son of the vicar Gomer Brunius and his wife Mariana Rodhe. He studied at Lund University, where he became a candidate in philology in 1813, a candidate in philosophy in 1814, a master of philosophy in 1814. He became an associate professor of Greek language at Lund University in 1815 and extra regular assistant professor in 1816, assistant professor in 1820. He became professor of Greek in 1824 filling the vacancy created when Esaias Tegn√©r (1782‚Äì1846) became Bishop of the Diocese of V√§xj√∂. Brunius also served as rector in 1831 and 1841 and retired as professor emeritus in 1858.Rydbeck, p. 506f Brunius spent most of his career in the study of art, architecture and antiquities and as a working architect. The focus in classical scholarship in the age in which Brunius worked was on the practical mastering of the languages. However beyond a few Latin poems, his contributions within his academic discipline were insignificant and had mostly ceased by the time he received his professorial chair.Rydbeck p. 508 Together with professor Johan Gustaf Liljegren (1791‚Äì1837), Brunius co-authored the first part of Nordiska fornlemningar, published in 1819 as well as a work on petroglyphs. Brunius later produced the first systematic investigation of mediaeval art and architecture in current Sweden, writing substantial works on the history of art in Scania and on the island of Gotland.Rydbeck p. 512 In his architectural work, Brunius wanted to revive the mediaeval styles; Romanesque as well as the more fashionable Gothic, which he preferred over the more recent Baroque and Rococo styles. His career as an architect began with his work on Lund Cathedral in collaboration with Stockholm based architect Axel Nystr√∂m (1793‚Äì1868). The Cathedral had for some time been in severe need of restoration and Nystr√∂m was given the job in 1832.Rydbeck p. 509-510 Brunius had a keen interest in draughtsmanship dating from childhood.Rydbeck p. 507 He had been elected a member of the Lund Cathedral assembly (domkyrkor√•d) in 1831 and was later elected chairman. He was entrusted with the task of supervising the work on the Cathedral, which took more than 25 years to complete. Brunius designed or restored a number of other buildings in Lund, including the Bishop's House and a house for himself, as well as a large number of parish churches and other buildings in the surrounding province of Scania.Rydbeck p. 509-510 Personal life In 1829, he was married with Maria Charlotta Tillander (1804-1883).

She was a daughter of White Thunder, a well- respected medicine man of the Cheyenne tribe. She was married to an Anglo- American trader named William Bent, with whom she had four children. Owl Woman was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame for her role in managing relations between Native American tribes and the Anglo-American men. Background =Native American tribes of the central plains= In the 1820s, the central plains area in which several Native American tribes lived had been subject to political and economic turmoil resulting from the Mexican War of Independence. The Arkansas River delineated the border, with Mexico to the south and the United States northwards. There were many opportunities for trade alliances, in part to replace those that had involved the now-deposed Spanish governors, and there was also encroachment on the area by the United States as that nation pursued its policy of manifest destiny.Hyde (2011), pp. 156-159. The area was also subject to turmoil as Native American plains tribes of the central and southern plains sought to define or redefine their territory. Tribes moved to new lands within the plains for various reasons: they may have been displaced in their previous land, had internal disputes that caused them to relocate, sought better hunting or gathering grounds, or sought land that was most conducive to their way of life. The Comanche, Kiowa, Cheyenne and Arapahoe were among the disputing tribes.Marker, p. 43. The Cheyenne likely moved into the plains in the 17th and 18th century from Minnesota and by the mid-1800s lived with the Arapaho north of the Arkansas River in land near Bent's Fort in Colorado.Hyde (2011), pp. 155, 162-163. Like other Native American tribes, the Comanche came to the grasslands of southern plains for a better life which put them at odds with other tribes. In an agreement reached with the Cheyenne, \\"The Great Peace of 1840\\", they agreed to stay south of the Arkansas River and the Cheyenne and Arapaho above it. =William Bent and the Santa Fe trail= 1845 Santa Fe Trail and native tribal lands William Bent, a white trader from St Louis, came to the Arkansas River region towards the end of the 1820s.Hyde (2011), p. 147. By around 1832, although possibly as late as 1834,Hyde (2011), p. 160. a permanent trading post called Bent's Fort, which was a substantial adobe construction capable of accommodating 200 people,Halaas, Masich, p. 12. had been built on the northern \\"Mountain Route\\" of the Santa Fe Trail and was open for business. The location of this building was determined after discussions with the Cheyenne and was not far from La Junta, near to land occupied by the Cheyenne and Arapahoe tribes. It became an important center of trade, principally in buffalo robes but also in numerous other goods, including horses and mules.Grinnell (1923) p. 33 The fort was operated in partnership with his brother, Charles, and Ceran St Vrain, a fur trader who had already established significant trading contacts in New Mexico.Halaas, Masich, pp. 23, 55.National Park Service, p. 4. Sometimes referred to as Fort William,Hyde (2011), p. 155 it was in \\"the perfect place at the perfect time\\" for someone looking to make money from trading and, for example, a gallon of brandy bought in St Louis for 2 could be sold at the fort for 25.Hyde (2011), p. 161. Hyde has dated the moment that White Thunder realized a common interest with Bent. In November 1833 they talked together as a meteor shower lit up the sky over the plains. Many Cheyenne who were gathered with them believed that this celestial event was a signal of the end of the world and it was subsequently referred to as \\"the Night the Stars Fell\\". White Thunder saw it as a new beginning and sought both a truce with the Pawnees and the return of the Sacred Arrows of the Cheyenne which had been captured by the Pawnee during a battle. Partially successful, he returned from his solo, unarmed visit to the Pawnee village with two of the arrows and an agreement for peace. He also realized that a formal marital alliance with Bent, and in particular the children that would result from such a relationship, would represent another element of the new beginning, of peace for the Cheyenne and indeed the region. Bent had already learned the language of the CheyenneHalaas, Masich, p. 23. and he was known as Little White Man by the native tribes. He and his brothers had been given native names upon their first meeting with Cheyenne in the area, which had been a convivial occasion during which their respect for the Cheyenne protocols had set a firm base for their future development of the fort and trading. =Life at Bent Fort and the Cheyenne village= Bent's Fort in 1848 The fort and the area immediately outside it was a multi-cultural, multilingual center with permanent inhabitants from many nations and also visitors, including the temporary camps of native tribes such as the Sioux, Apache and Kiowa, as well as Comanche and Cheyenne. It was the hub of a trading area that encompassed a 500-mile radius and was visited each year by hundreds of wagons traveling the Santa Fe trail. Hyde writes in Empires, Nations and Families that \\"Bent's Fort was the one spot on the Santa Fe trail where exchanges with Indians were welcomed and encouraged, and the effects of those conversations on both sides were far- reaching ... archeological evidence tells us that people sat in the courtyard together and smoked‚Äîa lot\\". Bent managed trade to and from the fort: he provided a safe zone in the area and a supply of goods for its store, as well as facilitating the movement of buffalo robes back to St. Louis for sale.Halaas, Masich, p. 27. Sitting on the Santa Fe trail, Bent's Fort was a resting stop for travelers, some staying as much as three weeks. From fall through spring the fort was busy with people wishing to trade and travelers to rest and restock their supplies. Visitors and employees included: Mexicans, Native Americans, and European travelers and trappers. There were also three African American slaves owned by the Bents. Up to 100 employees needed to support the fort and trade included: clerks, guards, traders, teamsters, trappers, a tailor, blacksmith, carpenter and herders. Caravans took goods to trade with regional Native American tribes.Grinnell (1913), pp. 170-172, 178, 184.Grinnell (1923), p. 24. The fort was usually relatively empty during the summer months and during that period Bent would often be riding the six-month journey on the trail to and from Westport, Missouri in order to trade the goods gathered over the previous winter and replenish the stocks of the fort for the forthcoming hunting season.Grinnell (1923) pp. 24-27. While Bent and the trains were away the fort managed with a skeleton crew of herders, clerks, traders and laborers for Native Americans and travelers.Grinnell (1913), p. 177. William and Charles owned African slaves Andrew and Dick Green and brought them from Missouri to assist in the running of the fort. Dick Green's wife, Charlotte, a negro cook who described herself as the only female American womanSimmons, pp. 51-52. to George Ruxton at the time of his visit in 1848 as \\"de only lady in de whole damn Injun country\\". She was notorious for her cooking among fur traders and travelers. One person called her a \\"culinary divinity\\". Bent's Fort held dances regularly; Charlotte was described by Colonel Henry Inman as \\"the center of attention, the belle of the evening. She knew her worth and danced accordingly.\\" Dick was released from slavery by George and William Bent after his heroic efforts in a battle in 1847 at Taos after the death of Charles Bent. Dick, who has been stationed with Charles Bent in Santa Fe, made his way north with American soldiers to Bent's Taos home. He bravely led a skirmish against a group of Taos Pueblo and other people. Dick was severely wounded but survived a trip back to Bent's fort. Charlotte, who Simmons claims was also Charles and William's slave, left the fort with her husband.Lavender, p. 171, 313, 319 File:Recreation room at Bent's Old Fort IMG 5707.JPGA view inside Bent's Old Fort File:Outside view, Bent's Old Fort, CO IMG 5704.JPGA view outside Bent's Old Fort =Bent's Fort role in negotiating tribal relationships= In the period immediately prior to the marriage of Owl Woman to Bent both the Cheyenne and the Arapahoe had become eager to work with the incoming trade caravans, and notably those associated with Bent. Unlike many other tribes in the area, they saw these caravans as an opportunity for enrichment rather than as a threat. The Cheyenne in particular had reason to favor Bent because he had on one occasion intervened to protect them against Comanche raiders. However, the disparity in how the long-settled and the recently settled tribes viewed the influx of new traders exacerbated intertribal rivalries and resulted in White Thunder making a decision that was calamitous for both his tribe and his reputation. In 1833 he led the Cheyenne into a fight with the Pawnees, the outcome of which was not merely a considerable loss of life but also the loss of the four arrows. This symbolic capture by the Pawnees represented a huge loss of respect and status for White Thunder and his tribe.Hyde (2011), p. 163. Bent had been doing much to negotiate a resolution to the intertribal disputes, as well as raids on settlers and traders. An uneasy truce had developed which, in its turn, had enhanced his own status and trading position. Anne Hyde has described the overall situation that came to exist in the area as being similar to that prevailing in northern California, a \\"negotiated community ... Only constant renegotiation and the conscious creation of community through family ties, diplomacy, warfare, and dinner made it operate in a surprisingly stable way.\\"Hyde (2011), p. 199. The trading environment improved after 1840, when Bent's Fort became the site of a truce between the Comanche, Apache and Kiowa tribes on the one hand and the Cheyenne and Arapahoe on the other, creating what Hyde describes as \\"network of enormous significance.\\"Hyde (2011), p. 355. The Comanche, in particular, had for many years protected their territory to the south of the Arkansas River against almost all who attempted to move into it. They had built up their power with a deep knowledge of their territory, shrewd trading arrangements, and their willingness to indulge in raids against those who threatened or breached those arrangements. Indeed, their grip on the territory to the south of the river was one of the reasons why Bent's Fort had been constructed on the opposite side. Although they had continued to assert their power after Mexican independence, the influx of displaced tribes from elsewhere, the westward push of white settlers and the development of the Santa Fe Trail meant that there were many bloody battles and much loss of life. These culminated in a Comanche raid on the fort and its surroundings in 1839 and a retaliatory raid by the Cheyenne. Realizing that long-term peace was preferable to reciprocating attacks, this was agreed and the formalization of the arrangement at the fort over several weeks during the summer of 1840 saw Bent playing a central role as host to the various camps and their celebrations.Hyde (2011), pp. 168-169Grinnell, pp. 41-44. Hyde has said that George Ruxton subsequently observed, in 1848, how the council room at the fort was used, \\"Chiefs of the Shain, Kioway and Araph√≥ sit in solemn conclave with the head traders, and smoke the \\"calumet\\" over their real and imaginary grievances.\\"Ruxton, p. 440 Biography Owl Woman, whose date of birth is unrecorded, was the oldest daughter of White ThunderHalaas, Masich, p. 24. and Tail Woman. She had at least two younger sisters, Yellow Woman and Island.Halaas, Masich, p.39. Her father was an influential Cheyenne leader who acted as the tribe's \\"Keeper of the Arrows,\\"Halaas, Masich, p. 290. four arrows thought to have a sacred or medicinal role. The prestige of his position as a spiritual leader or medicine man was reflected on to his daughters.Varnell, p. 8.Halaas, Masich, pp. 14, 23, 290. The Cheyenne were a nomadic plains tribe who followed and hunted buffalo. They were described as \\"tall, well built with even features\\" and regarded as \\"honorable, intelligent, honest and clean\\".Dexter, pp. 4-10. =Marriage= It was not uncommon at this time for white men living in the area, usually working as traders or trappers, to take a Native American wife. Often these relationships lasted only until the men left the frontier territory, but while they existed they were of mutual benefit. Bent and Owl Woman's relationship, however, was a partnership that ultimately \\"resulted in children, wealth and power.\\"Deverell, p. 313. From Bent's point of view, marriage to a Cheyenne would not merely provide him with female companionship and a social escort for functions held at the fort but, perhaps more importantly, reinforce an alliance with the tribe that would be a useful adjunct to his burgeoning trading activities. From the perspective of White Thunder, it would bolster his tribe's already friendly relationship with Bent and thus provide protection for them, and on a more personal level it would re-establish some of his prestige within the tribe itself.Hyde (2011), pp. 163-164.Halaas, Masich, pp. 23-25. To observe the formal rituals of the Cheyenne, he obtained consent from White Thunder to court Owl Woman. So much as talking to a Cheyenne girl was considered to be courtship by the tribe and, as such, it was necessary to obtain the permission first in order not to cause offence. There were other pre-courtship rituals, such as an exchange of ponies between the two men, and during the courtship itself Bent and Owl Woman were always chaperoned by Yellow Woman, in accordance with the Cheyenne belief in remaining celibate until marriage. To signal Bent's request to marry Owl Woman, he arrived at White Thunder's camp with horses and gifts and smoked a peace pipe of tobacco with Owl Woman's father in a ritualistic ceremony. Although Owl Woman wanted to marry Bent, the decision for the couple to marry was made by White Thunder by joining William Bent's hands with Owl Woman's hands. This signified both the acceptance of Owl Woman as William Bent's wife, but also an agreement for William Bent to also accept Owl Woman's sister Yellow Woman.Dexter, pp. 11-15. The couple married in a Cheyenne ceremony in 1835,Hyde (2011), p. 164. per Britney Nelson of the Colorado Historical Society, or as others claim by 1837. As a part of the ritual, Owl Woman was carried into a lodge which was constructed for them in the Cheyenne village near the fort,Halaas, Masich, p. 13, 26. while Bent dispensed largesse in the form of numerous gifts.Hyde (2011), pp. 164-165. Bent later became a \\"Cheyenne sub-chief\\", having attained tribal membership with his marriage to Owl Woman.Hoig, p. 15. =Living arrangements= ;Bent's Fort and the Cheyenne village The couple each spent time at their partner's residence: the lodge created for Owl Woman and Bent's quarters within the fort, which were furnished according to their backgrounds. Owl Woman did not prefer to stay the fort, where her room was dark and near the loud, smoky blacksmith shop. The horses and pack animals were also loud and smelly. On the other hand, her lodge was quiet and lit through the parchment-like paper of the roof. Horses grazed on the hills. In the lodge built for Owl Woman and Bent, a shrine-like area held sacred and religious items. Supplies were stowed away, including cooking utensils, food, clothing, bedding, riding gear and weapons.Halaas, Masich, pp. 26-27. By the 1840s two of Owl Woman's younger sisters, Island and Yellow Woman, joined them, in accordance with tribal custom for successful men. In 1845 Yellow Woman bore William a boy named Charley, or Pe-ki-ree meaning White Hat in Cheyenne.Varnell, p. 9.Lavender, p. 323. In April Bent left the fort for the six-month supply train journey to Missouri.Grinnell (1923), p. 25. During the summer months his family went back and forth between the fort and the nearby Cheyenne village and were in the fort by autumn.Grinnell (1923), p. 20. ;Big Timbers The only surviving daguerreotype from Solomon Nunes Carvalho's journey West in 1853 depicts a view of the Cheyenne village at Big Timbers. A pair of figures stand to the left; drying hides hang on the right. Courtesy of Library of Congress. Seasonally the Cheyenne moved down the Arkansas RiverLavender, p. 254. to Big Timbers. Alongside the Arkansas River for Big Timbers was a prime location for hunting buffalo, a major source of food for the Cheyenne.Halaas, Masich, pp. 11, 42, 60. The tribe also lived on roots and berries. Big Timbers was their desired camp site in the winter.Halass, Masich, pp. 59-60. According to Hyde, Owl Woman and her children traveled with her tribe to Big Timbers during the winter months and were at the fort itself during the summer. During the Cheyenne's winter visit to Big Timbers, Bent accompanied his family with goods for trading. At Big Timbers, Bent lived according to Cheyenne custom when he lived with them in a more casual, unstructured way of life. While Bent's Fort life was somewhat structured with William having a leadership role. =Role at the fort= Within a short time after the marriage the couple were, according to Hyde, \\"the central business and social leaders of the region\\", having combined their familial and trading connections with the various tribes, the traders, and the authorities of both New Mexico and the US Army to considerable effect.Hyde, p. 162. They were both active peacemakersBataille, Lisa, p. 230. among the natives, explorers, and settlers who visited the fort: Mexican traders, American explorers, African slaves, hunters and trappers and members of many area Native American tribes. Owl Woman worked in the fort and often managed the supply trains.Nelson. Her position enabled her to deter predatory tribes who might have designs on the trade caravans, this [reputedly] being achieved by her flashing a signal using a mirror. It was while at the fort in 1845 that topographical engineer Lieutenant James W. Abert asked Owl Woman to sit for him as the subject of a watercolor painting. He described that: =Children= The real fruit of the marriage was always anticipated to be the children, of whom they raised four together. These were named in English and Cheyenne:Hyde (2011), p. 165.Varnell, pp. 9-10. * Mary, named for Bent's favorite sister, was born January 22, 1838. Her Cheyenne name was Ho-ka. * Robert, named for Bent's youngest brother, was born about 1840 - 1841. His Cheyenne name was Octavi-wee-his. * George, was born July 7, 1843, named after Bent's brother. George was also named Ho-my-ike. * Julia or Um-ah was born in 1847 and her English name was that of Bent's oldest sister. Life at the fort, called the \\"mud castle of the plains\\", reflected the heritage of both parents. The children's clothes included linen shirts and soft-leather moccasins. There they ate on fine china and, according to Cheyenne custom, slept on the ground in soft hides. The furnishings and household goods included items from America, Mexico and international locations.Deverell, pp. 314, 313. Children enjoyed pumpkin pie and pancakes made by the Charlotte, a slave in service to the Bents. Chipita, the French-Mexican wife to a Bent worker, made taffy for the children; She performed housekeeping and laundry services at the fort.Halaas, Masich, p. 45. Owl Woman's mother taught the children to be respectful and courteous of their elders. Discipline was given through stern glances and waving fingers by his mother and his aunts. In their multi-cultural environment, the children learned to speak many languages; George learned how to speak Cheyenne, English, Spanish, Comanche, Kiowa and Arapaho. The boys learned to ride horses bareback, control the horses actions through softly worded commands, hunt and to be warriors. The girls learned how to perform chores, like gathering wood, fetching water, and picking berries. Halaas, Masich, pp. 39-40. Girls were also taught to be gracious, generous hosts.Halaas, Masich, p. 42. George Bent recalled of his childhood at the fort: Life for the Bent family changed dramatically over six years after Owl Woman's death. In 1849 a cholera epidemic swept through the Cheyenne tribe killing up to half of the people, including the children's grandmother, Tail Woman.Grinnell (1923), p. 20-21. Demand in fur declined, with a resulting drop in William Bent's business at the fort. In 1853 Bent established a stone fort in the Big Timbers area.Grinnell (1913), pp. 156-157. From 1854, subsequent to the death of Owl Woman, George was sent away to be educated at a school run by an Episcopalian in Westport, Missouri, causing him to be separated from his family for much of the time.Hyde (2011), pp. 151-152. Death and posthumous recognition The death of Owl Woman from complications of the birth of Julia, (who was born in 1844) in 1847 was not witnessed by Bent as he was away at that time. Bent mourned deeply for Owl Woman. Her sister Island took responsibility for raising Bent and Owl Woman's children.Halaas, Masich, p. 62. Owl Woman, described as \\"a most estimable good woman of much influence in the tribe\\",Varnell, p. 10. had worked to manage and improve relations between Native American tribes and the white man during her life. Hyde notes that Their vision did not last, being overtaken by wider events as the years passed by, but the contribution of Owl Woman was recognized posthumously. She was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 1985.Owl Woman, Colorado Women's Hall of Fame.

Early life Fortescue was born in 1610 at his father's seat of Fallapit, South Devon. High Sheriff In 1642 he was appointed sheriff of Devon. It was an object of considerable importance to the king to secure as sheriffs trustworthy men of local influence, and the selection of so young a man as Fortescue, whose father was still living, implies that he had already secured himself a reputation for courage or ability. In the beginning of December 1642 Fortescue summoned the posse comitatus of the county to meet him at Modbury, in order to join Sir Ralph Hopton, who was then marching from Cornwall to besiege Plymouth. About two thousand men answered the summons and assembled on 6 Dec, intending on the next day to join the main army, whose headquarters were at Plympton, only three miles distant. During the night Colonel Ruthven, commanding the parliamentary forces at Plymouth, organised a sortie from that town of some five hundred dragoons, who, avoiding the village of Plympton, fell upon Fortescue's train-bands at Modbury. The raw recruits dispersed at the first alarm, and the troopers at once occupied the village. They then proceeded to Modbury Castle, a seat of the Champernowne family, fired the house, broke in and took prisoner Fortescue himself, his brother Peter, Sir Edward Seymour and his eldest son, M.P. for Devonshire, Arthur Basset, ‚Äòa notable malignant,‚Äô and a number of other gentlemen. The victorious cavalry then marched to Dartmouth, whence they despatched their prisoners by sea to London.Remarkable Passages newly received of the great Overthrow of Sir Ralph Hopton, at Mudburie. With the taking of the High Sheriffe, &c.; 1642 On his arrival in London, Fortescue was sent to Windsor Castle: an inscription on the wall of a small chamber, close to the Round Tower, consisting of his name with a rude cut of his coat of arms and the words ‚ÄòPour le Roy C.,‚Äô serves to identify the room in which he was imprisoned. He was afterwards transferred to Winchester House and, before the end of 1643, was exchanged or released. Siege of Fort Charles On 9 Dec 1643 Fortescue received a commission from Prince Maurice to repair ‚Äòthe Old Bull-worke near Salcombe, now utterly ruined and decayed,‚Äô and to hold it for the king. The fort of Salcombe, or Fort Charles as it was renamed by Fortescue, stands on a rock at the entrance of Salcombe harbour near Kingsbridge, approachable from the land at low tide, but completely surrounded by the sea at high water. An interesting manuscript account of the details of the rebuilding, fortifying, and victualling the place is printed in Lord Clermont's ‚ÄòHistory.‚Äô The inventories of provisions given in this account show that nothing necessary for the support of the garrison during a prolonged siege was neglected: more than thirty hogsheads of meat, ten hogsheads of punch, ten tuns of cider, two thousand ‚Äòpoor jacks,‚Äô six thousand dried whiting, and six hundredweight of tobacco, are among the items of the provisions supplied, while such entries as ‚Äòtwenty pots with sweetmeats, and a good box of all sorts of especially good dry preserves,‚Äô one butt of sack, and ‚Äòtwo cases of bottles filled with rare and good strong waters,‚Äô show that Fortescue did not forget to provide for the table of the officers' mess. The garrison consisted of eleven officers, Sir Charles Luckner being second in command, and two of Fortescue's brothers serving under him, a chaplain, a surgeon, two laundresses, and forty-three non-commissioned officers and men. Of these one was killed during the siege, three were wounded, and two deserted. The fort was occupied in November or December 1644, and in January 1645/6 a force was sent from Plymouth who erected a battery of three guns in a commanding position on the mainland, exactly opposite and slightly above the small promontory on which the fort is situated. The siege lasted until May 1646, when Fortescue capitulated to Colonel Ralph Weldon, then in command of Plymouth. He obtained very favourable terms for the garrison, the articles of surrender stipulating that the whole force should be allowed to march out with all the honours of war and proceed in safety to their own homes; Fortescue himself and the other officers obtaining permission to remain at home unmolested for three months, at the end of which time they were free either to make their peace with the parliament or to go abroad from any port they should select.Articles agreed one betweene Sir Edmond Fortescue, Governor off Fort Charles and Major Pearce, &c.; 7 May 1646 Fortescue carried away with him the key of Fort Charles, which still remains in the possession of his descendant. Later life Unwilling or unable to come to terms with the parliament, Fortescue made his way to Delft, where he lived during the brief remainder of his life. In the ‚ÄòPropositions of the Lords and Commons for a peace sent to His Majesty at Newcastle‚Äô in July 1646, he is included in a list of persons who are to be removed from ‚Äòhis majesty's councils and to be restrained from coming within the verge of the court, bearing any public office or having any employment concerning the state‚Äô.Rushworth, Collections, pt. iv. vol. i. p. 309 Private life Fortescue died in January or February 1647, at the early age of thirty-seven, and was buried in the ‚ÄòNew Church‚Äô of Delft. He had married Jane, daughter of Thomas Southcote of Mohuns Ottery, and had a son Edmund, created a baronet in 1664, and three daughters. There is a portrait of Fortescue at Fallapit House, and a Dutch engraving, a facsimile of which is given by Lord Clermont.Lord Clermont's Hist. of the Family of Fortescue; Kingsbridge and Salcombe historically and topographically described.

The band is known for their blending of a number of genres including American folk, country, and bluegrass. History The Fucking Buckaroos were formed in San Francisco, CA in 2004 by Tim Sandberg, Thomas Puhek, and Sean Taylor. Originally a three piece acoustic act, the band added Ricky Pugh and Andrew Appleton to the line up in fall of 2004. In 2005, the band solidified its current instrumentation including guitar, mandolin, banjo, bass, and drums. They released an EP titled \\"When Cops Rode Bulls\\" the same year on Fort Faxon records, named after the house on Faxon avenue in San Francisco where Ricky and Andy lived. In 2007, the band released a full-length, self-titled CD. To support the album, the band launched a month and a half-long tour that spanned the US, Canada, and Mexico. In 2009, the band released a split 7\\" vinyl-only record with Tijuana-based psychobilly band Los Helldandys, titled \\"Popular Romance.\\" In 2010, their version of Swingin' Utters \\"Fruitless Fortunes\\" was included on the Untitled 21: A Juvenile Tribute to the Swingin' Utters. Over a two-week time period which spanned the weeks surrounding New Year's Day of 2012, the Buckaroos played a series of shows in Mexico, including Tijuana, Mexico City, and Oaxaca. While in Mexico City, the band played a landmark show for inmates at a youth detention center, known as a Reclusorio. In 2013, the Buckaroos embarked on a three-week tour of Germany and Belgium to promote \\"II\\" and their upcoming releases. In late 2013, the Buckaroos went on an extended hiatus, with Pugh moving to Nashville seeking \\"a place with less overhead and good music,\\" and Sandberg having his first child. Before calling a break, the group recorded several songs to be released in two parts. The first part, \\"Puro Pinche Pari\\" EP, was released in 2015, and includes a cover version of the Los Tigres del Norte song \\"Contrabando Y Traici√≥n,\\" and \\"Fiesta\\" by The Pogues.

He was the eldest son of William Fortescue of Cookhill, and grandson of Sir Nicholas Fortescue, Groom Porter to Henry VIII, to whom the Cistercian nunnery of Cookhill, on the borders of Worcestershire and Warwickshire, was granted in 1542. Fortescue, who was throughout his life a zealous Roman Catholic, for several years harboured at Cookhill the Benedictine monk, Augustine Baker. In 1605, after the Gunpowder Plot and the rising of the Roman Catholics of Warwickshire, Fortescue underwent several examinations, and fell under some suspicion on account of a large quantity of armour found in his house. His name appears twice in the Calendar of State Papers in connection with the plot. A letter from Chief-justice Anderson and Sheriff Warburton to the Privy Council states that Fortescue of Warwickshire, though summoned to appear before them, had not come forward to be examined. A declaration by himself says that the armour in question has been in his house for five years, and adds that he has not seen Wintour, the conspirator, for eight years, and was not summoned to join the rising in Warwickshire. He succeeded in clearing himself from these suspicions and lived at Cookhill unmolested until about 1610, when he was appointed a commissioner of James's household and of the navy. He was knighted in 1618, and in the same year, on the death of Sir John Poyntz (formerly Morice) of Chipping Ongar, he obtained the lucrative and honourable post of Chamberlain of the Exchequer, which he held until May 1625, when he resigned it. During 1622 and 1623 his name appears as serving on royal commissions, to inquire into the state of the plantations of Virginia and of Ireland, into the depredations committed by pirates on the high seas, and on royal grants of lands. Fortescue died at his house in Fetter Lane on 2 November 1633, and was buried in the private chapel of Cookhill, where his tomb may still be seen. He married Prudence, daughter of William Wheteley of Holkham, Norfolk, by whom he had five sons, William, Francis, Edmund, Nicholas, John, and two daughters.

His father was throughout his life a member of the Roman Catholic Church, and his sons were brought up in that religion. It is probable that the memory of Sir Adrian Fortescue, who had late in his life become a member of the Order of St. John, was cherished among his kinsmen, who adhered to the faith for the sake of which they believed him to have died a martyr, and it may be assumed that this feeling inspired Nicholas with the ambition to resuscitate the order, which had completely died out in England. In 1637 he went to Malta, furnished, if we are to believe Pozzo, the historian of the order, with a direct commission from Queen Henrietta Maria, who, \\"in her zeal for the restoration of the true religion\\" in her adopted country, desired to revive the English branch of the order. Fortescue was received as a Knight of Malta in 1638, and his project was favourably reported upon to the Grand Master, the Pope, and Cardinal Barbarini, protector of the order, by a commission appointed to investigate the matter. The chief difficulty, which proved insuperable, was to procure the sum of twelve thousand scudi, to be expended in buildings, fees, and other expenses necessary to the refoundation of the order in England. The negotiations extended over some years, during which time Fortescue travelled to and from England several times. During one of his journeys he was a guest of the English College at Rome, where, as the Strangers' Book of the college shows, he dined with John Milton, like himself travelling abroad. In 1642 the scheme was finally abandoned, owing, says Pozzo, to the \\"impious turbulence of the English people, which overthrew alike the cause of holy religion and of its royal patroness\\". Sir Nicholas, with his brothers William and Edmund, joined the royal army. According to the Loyal Martyrology he was slain in a skirmish in Lancashire while advancing with Prince Rupert's army to the relief of York; but it is more probable that he was killed at the Battle of Marston Moor, since he was buried at Skipton on 5 July 1644. The following character of Sir Nicholas is given in Lloyd's Memoirs of Excellent Personages: :\\"Sir Nicholas Fortescue, a knight of Malta, slain in Lancashire, whose worth is the more to be regarded by others, the less he took notice of himself; a person of so dextrous an address that when he came into notice he came into favour; when he entered the court he had the chamber, yea the closet of a prince; a gentleman that did much in his person, and, as he would say, let reputation do the rest; he and Sir Edmund Fortescue were always observed so wary as to have all their enemies before them and leave none behind them\\". The allusion to Sir Edmund may refer to Sir Edmund Fortescue of Fallapit; but it seems more probable that it relates to Edmund, brother of Sir Nicholas, who held a post at court as Keeper of Sewer (overseer) to the queen.

It also detects other treponematoses. In the test, gelatin particles are sensitized with T. pallidum antigen. Patient serum is mixed with the reagent containing the sensitized gelatin particles. The particles aggregate to form clumps when the patient serum is positive for syphilis. In other words, the patient's serum contains antibodies to T. pallidum. A negative test shows no clumping of gelatin particles. This is a type of specific treponemal test for syphilis. A similar specific treponemal test for syphilis is the Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay or TPHA. TPHA is an indirect hemagglutination assay used for the detection and titration of antibodies against the causative agent of syphilis, Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum. In the test, red blood cells (erythrocytes) are sensitized with antigens from T. pallidum pallidum. The cells then aggregate on the surface of a test dish if exposed to the serum of a patient with syphilis. It is used as a confirmatory test for syphilis infection. A negative test result shows a tight button or spot of red blood cells on the surface of the test dish.

It tells the story of Franklin Franklin, played by Matt Lucas, who by mistake kills his landlord, Mr. Olivetti, played by Peter Stormare. The cast co-stars Dolph Lundgren, Johnny Knoxville, James Caan, Billy Crystal, Juno Temple, Rebel Wilson, Saffron Burrows and Amanda Plummer. The screenplay was written by Chris Millis and adapted from his own novella. The film premiered at the South by Southwest Film Festival on March 10, 2012. Plot Franklin Franklin is a hairless, overweight, eccentric social misfit and compulsive hoarder obsessed with Switzerland, who walks around wearing little more than briefs and mismatching socks and lives on a diet consisting of Moxie soda and pickles with mustard. Living alone in an almost bare apartment in a rundown building complex in Southern California populated with other eccentrics, including cynical stoner Tommy Balls, neurotic geriatric recluse Mr. Allspice, and aspiring dancer Simone who lives with her mother ‚Äì both of whom may or may not be prostitutes. At an earlier point, Franklin's landlord Mr. Olivetti accidentally died after slipping on spilled mustard caused by sneezing fits when receiving fellatio from Franklin over frequent unpaid rent. In an effort to get rid of Olivetti's body, Franklin takes it to Olivetti's house and tries to stage it as a suicide, implementing an unlikely over-array of suicide methods. Attempting to dump Olivetti's pickup truck in the outskirts of town results in Franklin being robbed (of both his brother's watch and Olivetti's truck) and assaulted by two very dimwitted muggers. The next day, Franklin wonders why he hasn't gotten his weekly audiotape from his institutionalized brother Bernard, whom Franklin almost idolizes as Bernard is handsome, charismatic and popular and included Franklin in his social life. Unknown to Franklin, Bernard has died of an inoperable brain tumor and among Bernard's effects is an envelope holding a key to a locker containing a recorded message revealing that Bernard stole from his employer and has left Franklin a savings in a Swiss bank account and a passport in a new identity. Meanwhile, fire investigator Burt Walnut, and other detectives examine Olivetti's body, and quickly conclude that it's staged due to Franklin's amateurishness, and put a lookout for his pickup truck. Walnut, visiting the apartment complex, meets Balls and Allspice and becomes suspicious of Franklin. Walnut is estranged from his wife (who was having an affair with his cousin), and learns that Allspice's wife died around the time as Olivetti's wife, 13 years ago. Working at his convenience store, Balls shatters Simone's dancing dreams with his brutal honesty; upset, she hides in the restroom. Balls is then held up by Franklin's muggers, who shoot Balls in the torso when startled by Simone. Franklin returns to his apartment, but seeing the police, keeps on driving. Walnut discovers that Allspice has committed suicide, (likely upset over the death of Olivetti as Allspice revealed that they were close friends) and when answering a phone call by Franklin, is asked to adopt Franklin's dog (also named Bernard). Walnut informs Franklin of the muggers' arrest, calling them Olivetti's murderers, remarking of Olivetti that \\"some might say that he had it coming to him.\\" Although innocent, Franklin takes his Switzerland flight (dressed in shorts and button up shirt), sitting next to Dr. Sage Mennox, a self-help author whom Bernard obsessed over. Franklin tells Dr. Mennox that his brother had died, and was not insane (as Mennox had previously asserted), but had actually been impaired by a fatal brain tumor \\"the size of a racquet ball\\". Mennox is taken off guard by this, and Franklin (who has held a grudge against him for belittling Bernard, his hero, in the past), slyly remarks that they would be stuck together, in this awkward situation (on Mennox's part), for the duration of a very long flight.

It was co-financed by Sense And Sensibility Ventures and Silver Nitrate. According to director Jonas √Ökerlund, it was important for him that the production had a strong element of spontaneity; he therefore did not focus solely on the film like he had with his previous features, but also made 34 commercials and five music videos the same year. Small Apartments was made largely with the same crew √Ökerlund uses in his other projects. The first actor to be cast was Matt Lucas in the lead. =Filming= Photography took 20 days and ended in April 2011. Music The soundtrack, by Per Gessle of Roxette, was released on 17 April 2013. Release The film premiered at the South by Southwest Film Festival on 10 March 2012. =Home media= It was released on home media on 19 February 2013. Reception =Critical response= John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that \\"Small Apartments might crumble if not cemented by a compellingly weird performance by Little Britain's Matt Lucas\\", and that \\"even the scene-chewingest performance here (Peter Stormare as the sleazoid landlord, seen in flashback) augments the whole instead of drawing attention from it\\". DeFore also complimented Billy Crystal, writing that his performance \\"roots the picture to its ostensible genre while reminding us how engaging the actor can be when he's appearing not to try.\\" References External links Small Apartments on Rotten Tomatoes Category:2012 films Category:American films Category:Films directed by Jonas √Ökerlund Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:American comedy films ","title":"Small Apartments"},{"id":"32090881","text":"Coleophora amygdalina is a moth of the family Coleophoridae that is endemic to Tajikistan.

The film is a crossover of the films Commissioner (1994), The King (1995) and Bharathchandran I.P.S. (2005). Plot A Pakistan military group under Maj. Abu Jalal Rana (Rajiv Kumar) trespasses Indian waters, targeting New Delhi. The plan, however, is intercepted by Dr. Emma John of Intelligence Wing as she informs it to her senior Padmabhushan Dr. Sudarshan (Nedumudi Venu). Before they can tell the home minister, however, they are killed by two cops, who are joined by a senior police officer, Shankar Ramdas (Devan). Unbeknownst to them, Ali Imran, a photojournalist manages to take pictures of the scene onto his camera. Meanwhile, Kishore Balakrishnan (Vijay Menon), the senior analyst at the agency, sets off to see Swami Chandramoulishwar (Saikumar) at his ashram demanding for the information he passed before. However, Swami was able to suffocate him before pushing him into the Yamuna river. The next day, the bodies of Kishore, Dr. Sudarshan, and Dr. Emma are all found in the river and riverside. Since both the bodies of the doctors are seen in an intimate position, the police conclude that Kishore killed the two out of jealousy, and then killed himself right after by drowning himself into the river. However, G.K (Janardhanan), the central home minister assigns Joseph Alex I.A.S (Mammootty) to investigate the death of Dr. Sudarshan. He is represented as THE KING with a Lion.Consequently, he goes to the forensic director and analyst to ask him to give a fresh report and include the facts that they have excluded deliberately before. After seeing a mysterious man in black leather jacket walking away from his car, Joseph gets a call from Nanda (Samvrutha Sunil), the daughter of the home minister and a news journalist. She shows him the picture of a cop holding a gun towards someone inside a white car. Imran (Kishore), the owner photo has a gut feeling that he has seen Dr. Sudarshan in that car. On the other hand, Mr. Bharath Chandran IPS (Suresh Gopi), an Inspector-general of police from Kerala cadre, who is on deputation in the Central Home Ministry, is assigned to assist Joseph in probe. He is represented as THE COMMISIONER with a Tiger. Both of them are able to get Shankar arrested, but Shankar is soon killed by a henchman of Swami in court. Later on, Joseph is called into the PMO to tell that he is off the case now. He retorts and is able to be continue with the case after convincing the PM. He states that if something were to happen to the PM, the nation will suffer huge financial loss. The expenses is what Joseph is concerned about rather than the PM's life. Because of this, Swamiji gets pissed off that he decides to assassinate the PM through Rana. In this way, Raman Madhavan (Jayan Cherthala), the National Security Advisor (India) will be the next PM after ensuring support from many coalition party leaders. Meanwhile, ACP Arjun captures the PA coming out of Swami's ashram by disguising as the driver. However, although the PA is taken into custody, the Pakistan army men pretending as Delhi Police comes in and asks for PA's custody. The next thing they do is to draw the gun out and shoot ACP Arjun on the head. In the ensuing fight, Ubaid manages to kill several Pakistan officers, but Rana shows up and kills both Ubaid and the PA. Enraged, Bharath storms into the ashram, but is held at gunpoint by Swami's men. Nevertheless, Joseph appears right in time to save Bharath from getting killed, by killing one of Swami's men. Swami, and Raman Madhavan later at night, is taken into custody. When both of them are about to be taken to the location of the ISI agents, however, the people who accompanied them are shot dead in front of the building. Minutes later, Bharath and Joseph arrive into the dilapidated cottage with a team of commandos. There, they confront Rana, and both Joseph and Bharath draw their guns to shoot him 3 times respectively. Afterward, Joseph comes close to Rana and quips at him before sticking a flag pole (with the national flag of Pakistan on it) into his chest while chanting \\"Bharath Mata ki Jai\\". They also lock Swami and Raman Madhavan in a car. The bomb explodes after, killing both Swami and Madhavan. Then they go back to the Prime Minister's office, and though initially furious, the Prime Minister greets them for fulfilling their mission.

These films were successful at the box office during their period. Therefore, the 2012 film The King and the Commissioner is a film based on the two films mentioned. In addition, the lead actors in two different films were joined together with Renji Panicker as the scriptwriter. The 2012 film marks Mammootty's fourth film and Suresh Gopi's tenth film. Moreover, it also marks the comeback of Shaji Kailas-Renji Panicker duo after a gap of 16 years. The film was earlier reported to be a successor to the three films namely The King, Commissioner, and its sequel Bharathchandran I.P.S. in 1995, 1994, and 2005 respectively. However, Kailas reportedly said that the film features a new plot in a new background, wherein the lead characters in Panicker's films and his are coming together. =Casting= The project was finalized after a long period of discussion since the relationship between the two lead stars was not so warm. The movie had its spate of controversies during casting itself. In fact, the director was even planning to replace Suresh Gopi with Prithviraj. Nevertheless, it has been said later that the duo buried the hatchet and agreed to shoot the film.\\"Action Replay\\". The New Indian Express. IBN Live. 6 January 2012. Retrieved 12 January 2012. In addition, Shaji Kailas and Anto Joseph had initially announced that Reema Sen will play a role in the film, second to the lead heroine Samvrutha Sunil. However, Kannada actress Sanjanaa was later signed to play this role. Moreover, veteran actor and psychiatrist Dr. Mohan Agashe debuts in Malayalam in a cameo in the film. It was Mammootty, whom Agashe had known from the time he was shooting for Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, who suggested his name. =Filming= The shooting began in Trivandrum on 6 June 2011. Mammootty joined the set on 13 June. After one round of shooting in Trivandrum, the shooting shifted to Kochi and then to Delhi. Some scenes were also shot in Kozhikode. It is reported that the shooting of the film was going on in Kochi, when the income tax raids at Mammootty's residence took place. Mammootty had to be present before the investigators and the filming was delayed to a few days. It is also reported that the ill-health of Suresh Gopi was another reason for scrapping the shooting of the film. He is said to have reduced 15 kilos to look thinner, which led him to face health problems and take a leave from filming. Reception =Critical reception= Rediff.com rated the film 2 out of five stars and said \\"It's high on nostalgia but The King And The Commissioner has nothing new to offer says.\\" * Sify rated the film as disappointing and said \\"A better script, more believable characters, some real trimming and a modern style could have done wonders for The King and The Commissioner. But in the current form it succeeds in reminding about the earlier movies, though it is painfully long at more than three hours.\\". * IndiaGlitz rated the film 5 out of 10 points and said the film is \\"stuffed with all the cliches of Ranji-Shaji films\\". * Nowrunning rated the film 2 out of 5 and said \\"'The King and the Commissioner' does try to make up for its very serious loss of a sense of intrigue by going in for those flashy cuts and chic looks.\\" The film ended up as a box-office disaster.

It includes the recording, visualization, storage, analysis and sharing of digital recordings of heart or lung sounds. The recordings are obtained using an electronic stethoscope or similarly suitable recording device. Computer-aided auscultation is designed to assist health care professionals who perform auscultation as part of their diagnostic process. Commercial CAA products are usually classified as clinical decision support systems that support medical professionals in making a diagnosis. As such they are medical devices and require certification or approval from a competent authority (e.g. FDA approval, CE conformity issued by notified body). Benefits of CAA Compared to traditional auscultation, computer- aided auscultation (CAA) offers a range of improvements beneficial to multiple stakeholders: * CAA can yield more accurate and objective results and is likely to outperform the auscultation skills and subjective interpretation of humans. * With the use of CAA, auscultation is no longer a method reserved for specialists and physicians. For instance, nurses and paramedics can easily be instructed to use CAA systems correctly on their patients. * CAA opens up new opportunities for telemedicine. Real-time tele-auscultation can help specialists located anywhere in the world to diagnose rare conditions observed in patients in developing countries or remote areas. * CAA opens up new opportunities for health monitoring and health management. * CAA allows analysis findings to be documented electronically. The results can be stored and retrieved as needed and possibly included in electronic patient records. * Standardized auscultation data derived from CAA can help national payers and providers implement more efficient and cost-effective screening programs. * CAA can be used for teaching and training purposes with medical and nursing students. Functional principle In a CAA system, sounds are recorded through an electronic stethoscope. The audio data is transferred to an electronic device via Bluetooth or an audio cable connection. Special software on that device visualizes, stores and analyzes the data. With some of the more sophisticated CAA systems, the CAA analysis yields results that can be used to objectify diagnoses (decision support system). Components in a CAA system The components of a CAA system depend on its complexity. Whereas some of the simpler systems provide only visualization or storage options, other systems combine visualization, storage, analysis and the ability to electronically manage said data. =Electronic stethoscope= Electronic stethoscopes (also digital stethoscopes) convert acoustic sound waves into digital electrical signals. These signals are then amplified by means of transducers and currently reach levels up to 100 times higher than traditional acoustic stethoscopes. Additionally, electronic stethoscopes can be used to filter out background noise, a feature that can be safety-relevant and facilitate more accurate diagnoses. Whereas sound amplification and filtering are the main functions of an electronic stethoscope, the ability to access the sounds through external means via Bluetooth or audio cables makes them an ideal sound-capturing device for CAA systems. =Device running Graphical User Interface= Devices that can be used to connect to an electronic stethoscope and record the audio signal (e.g. heart or lung sounds) include PC, laptop and mobile devices like smartphones or tablets. Generally, CAA systems include software that can visualize the incoming audio signal. More sophisticated CAA systems include live noise detection algorithms, designed to help the user achieve the best possible recording quality. Graphical user interface of the eMurmur CAA system showing the incoming signal in real time. This CAA system includes live noise detection algorithms that ensure that the recorded signal is of sufficient quality. =Analysis software= A key feature of CAA systems is the automated analysis of the recorded audio signals by signal processing algorithms. Such algorithms can run directly on the device used for making the recording, or be hosted in a cloud connected to the device. The degree of autonomy of currently available analysis algorithms varies greatly. While some systems operate fully autonomously, early PC-based systems required significant user interaction and interpretation of results, and other analysis systems require some degree of assistance by the user like manual confirmation/correction of estimated heart rates. The mobile device based result screen of the eMurmur CAA system, showing the AHA classification, murmur analysis results (no murmur, innocent or pathologic murmur, additional descriptive data), heart rate, and playback option of the recordings. The laptop based SensiCardiac CAA software program, showing the recorded heart sounds and ECG signal, as well as the analysis results. =Storage of auscultation based data= Recorded sounds and associated analytical and patient data can be electronically stored, managed or archived. Patient identifying information might be handled or stored in the process. If the stored data classifies as PHI (protected health information), a system hosting such data must be compliant with country-specific data protection laws like HIPAA for the US or the Data Protection Directive for the EU. Storage options for current CAA systems range from the basic ability to retrieve a downloadable PDF report to a comprehensive cloud-based interface for electronic management of all auscultation-based data. =Cloud-based user interface= The user can review all their patient records (including replaying the audio files) via a user interface, e.g. via a web-portal in the browser or stand-alone software on the electronic device. Other functionalities include sharing records with other users, exporting patient records and integration into EHR systems. CAA of the heart Computer-aided auscultation aimed at detecting and characterizing heart murmurs is called computer-aided heart auscultation (also known as automatic heart sound analysis). =Motivation= Auscultation of the heart using a stethoscope is the standard examination method worldwide to screen for heart defects by identifying murmurs. It requires that an examining physician have acute hearing and extensive experience. An accurate diagnosis remains challenging for various reasons including noise, high heart rates, and the ability to distinguish innocent from pathological murmurs. Properly performed, the auscultatory examination of the heart is commonly regarded as an inexpensive, widely available tool in the detection and management of heart disease. The auscultation skills of physicians, however, have been reported to be declining. This leads to missed disease diagnoses and/or excessive costs for unnecessary and expensive diagnostic testing. A study suggests that more than one third of previously undiagnosed congenital heart defects in newborns are missed by their 6-week examination. More than 60% of referrals to medical specialists for costly echocardiography are due to a misdiagnosis of an innocent murmur. CAA of the heart thus has the potential to become a cost- effective screening and diagnostic tool, provided that its underlying algorithms have been clinical tested in stringent, blinded fashions for their ability to detect the difference between normal and abnormal heart sounds. =Heart murmurs and CAA= Heart murmurs (or cardiac murmurs) are audible noises through a stethoscope, generated by a turbulent flow of blood. Heart murmurs need to be distinguished from heart sounds which are primarily generated by the beating heart and the heart valves snapping open and shut. Generally, heart murmurs are classified as innocent (also called physiological or functional) or pathological (abnormal). Innocent murmurs are usually harmless, often caused by physiological conditions outside the heart, and the result of certain benign structural defects. Pathological murmurs are most often associated with heart valve problems but may also be caused by a wide array of structural heart defects. Various characteristics constitute a qualitative description of heart murmurs, including timing (systolic murmur and diastolic murmur), shape, location, radiation, intensity, pitch and quality. CAA systems typically categorize heart sounds and murmurs as Class I and Class III according to the American Heart Association: * Class I: pathological murmur * Class III: innocent murmur or no murmur More sophisticated CAA systems provide additional descriptive murmur information like murmur timing, grading, or the ability to identify the positions of the S1/S2 heart sounds. =Heart sound analysis= The detection of heart murmurs in CAA systems is based on the analysis of digitally recorded heart sounds. Most approaches use the following four stages: # Heart rate detection: In the first stage, the heart rate is determined based on the audio signal of the heart. It is a crucial step for the following stages and high accuracy is required. Automated heart rate determination based on acoustic recordings is challenging because the heart rate can range from 40-200bpm, noise and murmurs can camouflage the peaks of the heart sounds (S1 and S2), and irregular heartbeats can disturb the quasi-periodic nature of the heartbeat. # Heart sound segmentation: After the heart rate has been detected, the two main phases of the heartbeat (systole and diastole) are identified. This differentiation is important since most murmurs occur in specific phases during the heartbeat. External noise from the environment or internal noise from the patient (e.g. breathing) make heart sound segmentation challenging. # Feature extraction: Having identified the phases of the heartbeat, information (features) from the heart sound is extracted that enters a further classification stage. Features can range from simple energy-based approaches to higher-order multi-dimensional quantities. # Feature classification: During classification, the features extracted in the previous stage are used to classify the signal and assess the presence and type of a murmur. The main challenge is to differentiate no-murmur recordings from low-grade innocent murmurs, and innocent murmurs from pathological murmurs. Usually machine- learning approaches are applied to construct a classifier based on training data. =Clinical evidence of CAA systems= The most common types of performance measures for CAA systems are based on two approaches: retrospective (non-blinded) studies using existing data and prospective blinded clinical studies on new patients. In retrospective CAA studies, a classifier is trained with machine learning algorithms using existing data. The performance of the classifier is then assessed using the same data. Different approaches are used to do this (e.g., k-Fold cross-validation, leave-one-out cross-validation). The main shortcoming of judging the quality (sensitivity, specificity) of a CAA system based on retrospective performance data alone comes from the risk that the approaches used can overestimate the true performance of a given system. Using the same data for training and validation can itself lead to significant overfitting of the validation set, because most classifiers can be designed to analyse known data very well, but might not be general enough to correctly classify unknown data; i.e. the results look much better than they would if tested on new, unseen patients. ‚ÄúThe true performance of a selected network (CAA system) should be confirmed by measuring its performance on a third independent set of data called a test set‚Äù. In summary, the reliability of retrospective, non-blinded studies are usually considered to be much lower than that of prospective clinical studies because they are prone to selection bias and retrospective bias. Published examples include Pretorius et al. Prospective clinical studies, on the other hand, are better suited to assess the true performance of a CAA system (provided that the study is blinded and well controlled). In a prospective clinical study to evaluate the performance of a CAA system, the output of the CAA system is compared to the gold standard diagnoses. In the case of heart murmurs, a suitable gold standard diagnosis would be auscultation-based expert physician diagnosis, stratified by an echocardiogram-based diagnosis.

This implies that labour income is taxed at higher rates than capital income, and that the value of the tax allowances is independent of the income level. The dual income tax system deliberately moves away from the comprehensive income tax (global income tax) system which taxes all or most (cash) income minus deductions (net income) according to the same rate schedule. The dual income tax was first implemented in the four Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden) through a number of tax reforms from 1987 to 1993. The dual income tax is therefore also known as the Nordic tax system or the Nordic Dual Income Tax. History The dual income tax was first proposed by the Danish economist Niels Christian Nielsen in 1980. He suggested that the comprehensive income tax should be replaced by a system involving a flat rate of tax on capital income - at the level of the corporate income tax rate - combined with progressive taxation of the taxpayer's total income from other sources.S√∏rensen (1994), page 60. The proposal was taken up by a committee appointed by the Savings Bank Association (Sparekasseforeningen) that in the early 1980s prepared a discussion paper for a tax reform. Niels Christian Knudsen, now the president of the Savings Banks Association, contacted in June 1984 the Minister of Finance Isi Foighel and made him aware of the committee's proposal. The discussion paper was subsequently to serve as the basis for the tax ministers negotiations with the opposition on a tax reform.Kallestrup (2003) The Danish minority government did propose a dual income tax in the spring of 1985, but the opposition was reluctant to give up the idea of progressive taxation of capital income. The final tax reform of 1987 included some amount of progressive taxation of capital income, but the top marginal tax rate on capital income (56 percent) was less than the top marginal tax rate of labour income (68 percent). It was thus not a pure dual income tax that was introduced in Denmark in 1987, but the Danish tax system moved considerably away from the comprehensive income tax. S√∏rensen (1994), page 60.

It combines aspects of investigative journalism and explanatory reporting. Analytic journalism can be seen as a response to professionalized communication from powerful agents, information overload, and growing complexity in a globalised world. It aims to create evidence-based interpretations of reality, often confronting dominant ways of understanding a specific phenomenon. It is distinctive in terms of research practices and journalistic product.Ross, Steven S. (2005). ‚ÄùTeaching Computer-assisted Reporting on South India\\": pages 303-318 in Rajan, Nalini (edt)(2005). Practising Journalism: Values, Constrains, Implications, New Delhi: Sage At times, it uses methods from social science research.Adam, G. Stuart & Roy Peter Clark (ed.) (2006). Journalism. The Democratic Craft, New York: Oxford University Press. The journalist gains expertise on a particular topic, to identify a phenomenon that is not readily obvious. At its best, investigative journalism is deeply analytic, but its intent is primarily to expose. Analytic journalism's primary aim is to explain. It contextualizes its subject by describing background, historical details, and statistical data. The goal is a comprehensive explanation that shapes audience perception of the phenomenon. Analytic journalism aspires to collect disparate data and make connections that are not immediately apparent. Its effectiveness is often in the analysis between the facts rather than the facts themselves and is critically engaged with other arguments and explanations.Argument-Explanation Complementarity and the Structure of Informal Reasoning. Informal Logic 30 (1): pages 92-111. Available at: http://www.phaenex.uwindsor.ca/ojs/leddy/index.php/informal_logic/article/view/419/2364 [p. 20]) In this way, analytic journalists attempt to give a deeper understanding of an issue.  What do analytic journalists use  As analytic journalism attempts to transcend regular news reporting‚Äîwhich primarily relays facts‚Äîanalytic journalists must use critical methods that help them present information in a way that distinguishes it from simple event-driven hard news. Analytic journalism often applies the scientific method of testing and retesting of hypotheses against the evidence. Assumptions are systematically tested by verifying, affirming, and altering hypotheses. Analytic journalists attempt to construct new frames or angles that reconfigure understanding. They help bring the background into the foreground and \\"...making it thereby available for conversation and collective notion.\\"Schudson, Michael, 2008. Why democracies need an unlovable press, Cambridge: Polity Press: pages 16-17 The legitimacy of the author's voice is created by the coherent assembly of facts and evidence.McCroskey, James C. (2005). ‚ÄúEthos A Dominant Factor in Rhetorical Communication‚Äù, pp. 82-107 in James C. McCroskey. An Introduction to Rhetorical Communication//, 9th ed, Boston: Allyn & Bacon.)  Additional definitions  According to Adam and ClarkAdam, G. Stuart & Roy Peter Clark (ed.) (2006). Journalism. The Democratic Craft, New York: Oxford University Press: page 300 Analytic journalists should retrieve and adapt methodologies from other disciplines to enlarge journalism so that it incorporates knowledge and methods generated by historians, social scientist, anthropologists, and critics. The Institute of Analytic Journalism employs a rather general definition and positions it within a critical approach: \\"critical thinking and analysis using a variety of intellectual tools and methods to understand multiple phenomena and to communicate the results of those insights to multiple audiences in a variety of ways.\\" A more pragmatic definition, suggested by Johnson, points out the necessary variables of analytic thinking: \\"Frame the appropriate question, find and retrieve appropriate data, use appropriate analytic tools, show what you know with story-appropriate media.\\"Johnson, Tom (2006). No, it is not \\"All about story\\" presentation in Durban, South Africa: page 68. Available at: http://www.slideshare.net/jtjohnson/no-it-is-not-all-about-story De Burgh compares analytic journalism with news reporting: \\"News reporting is descriptive and news reporters are admired when they describe in a manner that is accurate, explanatory, vivid or moving, regardless of medium. Analytic journalism, on the other hand, seeks to take the data available and reconfigure it, helping us to ask questions about the situation or statement or see it in a different way.\\"de Burgh, Hugo (ed.) (2008/2000). Investigative journalism: page 14 Therefore, de Burgh sees the role of analytic journalists as follows: \\"The duties if today‚Äôs journalist can be divided roughly into three basic functions: Hunter-gatherer of information, Filter, and Explainer. Only in our role as ‚Äòexplainer‚Äô, as storyteller, do journalists appear to have a reasonable secure position. To ‚Äòexplain‚Äô, they have to more than ‚Äòreport‚Äô‚Ä¶ what a Prime minister or a general has to say.\\"  How analytic journalism supplements other forms of journalism  While investigative journalism aims at exposing, analytic journalism aims at explaining. Following a trail of evidence, investigative journalism is more inclined to follow a particular guilty party, while analytic journalism is more inclined to follow that evidence to broaden understanding of the issue or phenomenon. Analytic journalism focuses on creating meaning out of information that may not be hidden but dispersed. Analytic journalism incorporates different journalistic approaches, strategies, and genres. The graphic below illustrates the unique characteristics of analytic journalism. It illustrates how analytic journalism draws from multiple, but not all, journalistic disciplines.

The purpose of the establishment was to enhance the scientific research carried out in Greece and to provide more opportunities for creative research by Greek scientists. After the war, the palace attempted to establish basic social welfare and education institutions with the aim of legal, political and social prosperity and the social development of Greece. At the same time it seeks to justify and promote the royal institution.Œ§œÅŒπŒ±ŒΩœÑŒ¨œÜœÖŒªŒªoœÇ Œ£Œ∫ŒªŒ±Œ≤ŒµŒΩŒØœÑŒ∑œÇ, ¬´ŒôœÉœÑŒøœÅŒπŒ∫œå œÉœáŒµŒ¥ŒØŒ±œÉŒºŒ± Œ≥ŒπŒ± œÑŒ∑ŒΩ ŒØŒ¥œÅœÖœÉŒ∑ Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÑŒ∑ŒΩ œÄŒøœÅŒµŒØŒ± œÑŒøœÖ Œï.Œô.Œï¬ª, ŒïŒ∏ŒΩŒπŒ∫œå ŒäŒ¥œÅœÖŒºŒ± ŒïœÅŒµœÖŒΩœéŒΩ: 1958‚Äì2008 ŒäŒ¥œÅœÖœÉŒ∑-œÄŒøœÅŒµŒØŒ± -œÄœÅŒøŒøœÄœÑŒπŒ∫Œ≠œÇ, ŒëŒ∏ŒÆŒΩŒ±, 2008, œÉŒµŒª.12 Scientific research up to that time was carried out by universities and the Academy of Athens, so the most important efforts outside the NHRF were the establishment of the Greek Atomic Energy Commission (1954) and later \\"Democritos\\" (1961). =Background information= In 1947, the Palace in Greece, represented by the successor to the royal throne Paul, founded the Royal National Foundation with the aim of undertaking various educational activities.Œ§œÅŒπŒ±ŒΩœÑŒ¨œÜœÖŒªŒªŒøœÇ Œ£Œ∫ŒªŒ±Œ≤ŒµŒΩŒØœÑŒ∑œÇ, ¬´ŒôœÉœÑŒøœÅŒπŒ∫œå œÉœáŒµŒ¥ŒØŒ±œÉŒºŒ± Œ≥ŒπŒ± œÑŒ∑ŒΩ ŒØŒ¥œÅœÖœÉŒ∑ Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÑŒ∑ŒΩ œÄŒøœÅŒµŒØŒ± œÑŒøœÖ Œï.Œô.Œï¬ª, ŒïŒ∏ŒΩŒπŒ∫œå ŒäŒ¥œÅœÖŒºŒ± ŒïœÅŒµœÖŒΩœéŒΩ: 1958‚Äì2008 ŒäŒ¥œÅœÖœÉŒ∑-œÄŒøœÅŒµŒØŒ± -œÄœÅŒøŒøœÄœÑŒπŒ∫Œ≠œÇ, ŒëŒ∏ŒÆŒΩŒ±, 2008, œÉŒµŒª.13 It included palace officials, bank and chamber executives and prominent public figures. At that time conditions in America and Europe were favorable for scientific research, while Greek scientists abroad were calling for the organization of scientific institutions in Greece, which would encourage their repatriation and enhance domestic research. Yagos Pesmazoglou envisioned the development of research in Greece during his university years at Harvard. Moreover, he played a key role when he was General Director at the Ministry of Coordination (1951-1955). He moved in that direction when he set up the Bank of Greece's Directorate of Economic Studies in 1955 for the purpose of preparing financial studies. In 1958, Pesmazoglou met King Paul and presented his ideas for setting up a research center. The second person to share these ideas was Konstantinos Dimaras, General Director at the Ministry of Coordination in 1951 and General Director at the State Scholarship Foundation (ŒôŒöŒ•). Another contributor to this effort was Charalambos Potamianos, a deputy commander, former aide to the king and also a member of the administration of the Royal National Foundation. Furthermore, the participation of Leonidas Zervas, a professor of organic chemistry at the University of Athens and then a visiting researcher in the U.S., was important. Pesmazoglou corresponded with Zervas and sent him drafts of the Foundation's Organization and Zervas replied with his observations. Pesmazoglu tells him that the \\"Kaiser Wilhelm Institut\\" and the \\"Center de la Reaserhe Scientifique\\" are modeled on. Among those wishing to participate were Xenophon Zolotas, Konstantinos Dimaras, Caesar Alexopoulos, Ioannis Saregiannis and Evangelos Papanoutsos. Pesmazoglou was also in touch with Waldemar Nielsen, a spokesman for the Ford Foundation, with the aim of financially supporting the establishment.

The foundation's Board of Directors entrusted the study of the buildings to Dimitris Pikionis and Konstantinos Doxiadis. The reason for the direct assignment was that Zervas and Dimaras had proposed to undertake the study a mixed group of architects: three well-known and distinguished and three young people of the best.

The building permit was approved on April 22, 1964. The building was auctioned in March with invitations from 15 contractors, but the tender was canceled as unprofitable. Finally, the project was undertaken by Theoharis Economou and G. Georgiou and G. Balkabassi SA. The foundation was established on May 10, 1965. The building was completed after 3.5 years and was received on October 25, 1968. In 1990 a 6th floor was added to the building.

The director of the institute is Maria Christina Chatziioanou, since 2013. The Institute's research objectives are the historical documentation and interpretation, the diffusion of new knowledge, and the training of young scholars, thus contributing to national self-awareness and active presence in the international scientific community. The individual sections that make up the institute are: Section of Neohellenic Research Originally named \\"Center for Modern Greek Studies\\", it was founded on May 11, 1960 by an act of the Board of Directors of the then Royal Research Foundation and began operating in December of the same year. It was originally housed in Alexandra Michael Mela's privately owned apartment at 4Vasilissis Sofias Street. Since the winter of 1967 it has moved to the fifth floor of the newly completed NHRF building. In 1989 it was renamed the Institute for Modern Greek Studies. The Section of Neohellenic Research studies the history of Modern Hellenism from the 15th to the 20th century. It develops programs and projects organized in three main disciplines: History of Culture, Economic and Social History, Political History. Specific subjects emerging from the above are the history of ideas, institutions and ideology, modern Greek literature and historiography, religious art, the history of sciences, Ottoman studies, historical demography and geography, cartography, travel and consular networks, business history, modern political history. His scientific activities include the production of print and digital publications, the creation of electronic applications of historical content, the organization of conferences and the development of an international network of collaborations on contemporary issues. The directors of the section since its establishment were Michael Laskaris (1960-1962), Konstantinos Dimaras (1962-1972), Dionysios Zakythinos (1971-1975), Deputy Director Manusos Manusakas (1975-1980), Loukia Drarou (1981-1995), Vassilis Panagiotopoulos (1995-2000) Paschalis Kitromilides (2000-2012) and Taxiarchis Kolias (2012-2013). In the first twenty years of the sector's activity, New Hellenism is autonomous as a research field and attempts to \\"inventory the country's intellectual treasures at national level\\".Œ†Œ±œÉœáŒ¨ŒªŒ∑œÇ ŒöŒπœÑœÅŒøŒºŒ∑ŒªŒØŒ¥Œ∑œÇ, ¬´ŒôŒΩœÉœÑŒπœÑŒøœçœÑŒø ŒùŒµŒøŒµŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫œéŒΩ ŒïœÅŒµœÖŒΩœéŒΩ¬ª, ŒïŒ∏ŒΩŒπŒ∫œå ŒäŒ¥œÅœÖŒºŒ± ŒïœÅŒµœÖŒΩœéŒΩ: 1958‚Äì2008 ŒäŒ¥œÅœÖœÉŒ∑-œÄŒøœÅŒµŒØŒ± -œÄœÅŒøŒøœÄœÑŒπŒ∫Œ≠œÇ, ŒëŒ∏ŒÆŒΩŒ±, 2008, œÉŒµŒª.69 Thus the main directions were the inventory of Greek bibliographical production, cataloging and publishing of archival material, bibliographic and literary interests. From 1980 to 2000, it integrates economic and social history, historical geography and demography, the history of institutions, the history of technology and the history of modern Greek art. The Institute's research horizons have been enriched by the convening of international scientific meetings. The Center for Modern Greek Studies has been slow to acquire a scientific journal of its own, and its collaborators have published their work in the journal \\"The Eranist\\" of the Hellenic Enlightenment Study Group. In 1981 he acquired \\"Tetradia Ergasias\\".ŒîŒ∑ŒºŒÆœÑœÅŒ∑œÇ ŒëœÄŒøœÉœÑŒøŒªœåœÄŒøœÖŒªŒøœÇ, ¬´Œü Œö.Œò.ŒîŒ∑ŒºŒ±œÅŒ¨œÇ Œø ŒåŒºŒπŒªŒøœÇ ŒúŒµŒªŒ≠œÑŒ∑œÇ œÑŒøœÖ ŒïŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫Œøœç ŒîŒπŒ±œÜœâœÑŒπœÉŒºŒøœç (ŒüŒúŒïŒî) Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÑŒø ŒöŒ≠ŒΩœÑœÅŒø ŒùŒµŒøŒµŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫œéŒΩ ŒïœÅŒµœÖŒΩœâŒΩ (ŒöŒùŒï)¬ª, ŒëŒΩœÑŒØ, œÑœá.850 (9 Œ£ŒµœÄœÑŒµŒºŒ≤œÅŒØŒøœÖ 2005), œÉŒµŒª.38 Section of Byzantine Research The Institute of Byzantine Research was first established under the name of the Byzantine Research Center on May 11, 1960 by an act of the Board of Directors of the then Royal Research Institute and started operating in December of the same year. His successors were Dionysios Zakythinos (1960-19750), Manusos Manusakas (1976-1980), Chryssa Maltezou (1980-1995), Nikolaos Economidis (1995-2000), Evangelos Chrysos (2000-2005) and from in 2006 to 2012 Taxiarchis Colias.Œ§Œ±ŒæŒπŒ¨œÅœáŒ∑œÇ ŒöœåŒªŒπŒ±œÇ,¬´ŒôŒΩœÉœÑŒπœÑŒøœçœÑŒø ŒíœÖŒ∂Œ±ŒΩœÑŒπŒΩœéŒΩ ŒïœÅŒµœÖŒΩœéŒΩ¬ª,ŒïŒ∏ŒΩŒπŒ∫œå ŒäŒ¥œÅœÖŒºŒ± ŒïœÅŒµœÖŒΩœéŒΩ: 1958‚Äì2008 ŒäŒ¥œÅœÖœÉŒ∑-œÄŒøœÅŒµŒØŒ± -œÄœÅŒøŒøœÄœÑŒπŒ∫Œ≠œÇ, ŒëŒ∏ŒÆŒΩŒ±, 2008, œÉŒµŒª.96-123 Since its inception, the sector has been designed to enhance research and promote the history and culture of Byzantium and medieval Hellenism. An additional goal is to explore Byzantine relations with medieval Europe, the Balkans and the Eastern Mediterranean. Testimonials from written sources, literary and archival, artwork and archaeological finds form the basis of the research. The department's activity is organized into programs that implement a variety of projects covering a wide range of research fields and specialties, publishing sources and highlighting archival collections (such as the Archives of Mount Athos and Patmos Monasteries). The Department of Byzantine Studies is one of the most important and authoritative centers of Byzantine studies internationally. Section of Greek and Roman Antiquity Founded in 1979, the Section of Greek and Roman Antiquity‚Äîoriginally called \\"Center of Greek and Roman Antiquity\\" (ŒöŒïŒ°Œë)‚Äîhas as its object the political, economic, social and cultural phenomena and events of Greek and Roman Antiquity, with the aim of renewing and promoting archeological studies through the collection and publication of primary evidence and synthetic studies. Aims and actions The Institute for Historical Research investigates the political, economic, social, and cultural history of Hellenism and the areas where Hellenism was active, from prehistoric antiquity to modern times. In addition, it aims to develop scientific activities aimed at the creation and dissemination of new knowledge as well as the training of new researchers with the ultimate aim of scientific research of Greek history, the establishment of Greek national self-knowledge and the promotion of international scientific cooperation in the fields of. The Institute's infrastructure comprises specialized Libraries of the Sectors, micro-libraries, folders, archives and electronic databases.

During a thriving economy in Maribor after the World War II, the club was financially supported by the local engineering industry company Metalna Maribor and the vehicle manufacturer TAM, both based in Tezno. Between the end of the World War II in 1945 and the independence of Slovenia in 1991, Kovinar spent a total of 18 years in the Slovenian Republic Football League. In 1961, they helped the newly-formed NK Maribor by giving them some players and sports equipment. After the \\"Ball\\" (≈Ωoga) affair, when NK Maribor was pushed back to the third Yugoslav division and a lot foreign players left the club, Kovinar again helped them by giving players.

On 1 April 1933 he left the University of Jena and moved to Berlin as the successor to economist Max Sering at the University of Berlin. During his first year in Berlin, Dietze came in contact with many leading politicians including Hanns Kerrl and Roland Freisler.Blesgen p.124 Dietze wasted little time establishing himself as an opponent of the Nazi regime, joining the Confessing Church and consistently voicing his disapproval of the policies of Reich Minister of Food Richard Walther Darr√©. As a result, the Institute for Agricultural and Housing Engineering was closed by the Nazis in 1934. As President of the Verein f√ºr Socialpolitik, Dietze acted directly against the Nazi Regime by granting a Jewish doctoral candidate his doctorate in 1935. After moving to Freiburg im Breisgau in 1936 to replace Karl Diehl at the University of Freiburg, Dietze became increasingly active in the Confessing Church's opposition to the Nazis. He was arrested and held in captivity by the Gestapo for two weeks in 1937 after a conflict with the \\"German Christians\\" in which he informed visitors attending the church of the arrest of the Confessing Church's pastor and subsequent replacement with a pastor for the \\"German Christians.\\"Blesgen p. 125 In 1938 Dietze worked with Adolf Lampe and Walter Eucken to found the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Erwin von Beckerath, which would later become the Freiburger Kreis. Through this group Dietze would come into direct contact with Carl Friedrich Goerdeler and Dietrich Bonhoeffer. After the failure of the 20 July Plot, Dietze was arrested for his relationship with Goerdeler and Bonhoeffer and was charged with high treason. He was imprisoned in Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp and at Zellengef√§ngnis Lehrter Stra√üe 3 in Berlin. His impending conviction and death sentence were impeded only by the collapse of the Third Reich, making him one of the few political prisoners who avoided being executed in the Pl√∂tzensee Prison.Blesgen, p. 128 Post-war After returning to Freiburg on 17 June 1945, Dietze resumed teaching at the university and served as its Rector from 1946 until 1949. During this time he founded a research establishment for agricultural politics and sociology, of which he was the president until his death. In 1948 Dietze received an honorary doctorate in Theology from the University of Heidelberg for his commitment to Christian lifestyle and ethics in the field of economics. He became a member of the advisory council to the Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection in 1950 and served as president of the Evangelical Church in Germany from 1955 until 1961. In 1958 and 1961 he was awarded a Bundesverdienstkreuz. In 1960 Dietze was appointed a Doctor of Agriculture by the agricultural faculty at the University of Bonn. Dietze died on 18 March 1973 at the age of 81 in Freiburg im Breisgau. Further reading * Blesgen, Detlef J.

Woman and shooting team is wearing white with red bibs. Opposing team is wearing blue with purple bibs. On the club, national and international level, men's netball teams exist, but attract less attention than women's netball. Mixed teams are not uncommon in Australia and are very popular. Men's national teams do exist in Brunei, Canada, England, Fiji, Hong Kong, India, Isle of Man, Jamaica, Kenya, Malaysia, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Singapore and the UAE. In 1997, in England male participation comprised 0.7% of the total netball playing population within schools. Unlike women's netball at elite and national levels, men's and mixed gendered teams in countries like Fiji, Australia and New Zealand are largely self-funded. When administrators attend conferences for men's and mixed gendered netball, they also have to pay most of their own costs. History Netball started to become popular for male players in Australia during the 1980s as men started to watch the sport that their wives and girlfriends were participating in. In Australia, the sport began to be played with the appearance of mixed gendered social teams. In 1985, the first Australian Championship were held in Geelong. The levels contested included: Open, Open Reserves, 21 and Under, 19 and Under, 17 and Under and Masters. The South Australian Mens Netball Association was founded in 1998. In 2000, the national organisation basically collapsed because of a lack of interest. In 2001, the South Australians tried to recreate the national organisation under their own state organisation, calling it the Australian International Mens and Mixed Netball Association. The new organisation held its first Australian Championships in 2002 for men's and mixed teams. In 2003, New Zealand entered a national team in the Open Mens Division and won. In 2004, New Zealand and Fiji sent teams to compete in the Australian Mixed and Men's National Championships. On 6 August 2004, the men's national organisations for Fiji, Cook Islands, New Zealand and Australia attended a meeting where they agreed to form the International Men's and Mixed Netball Association. The following day, the organisation's first official meeting was held. The group decided that the International Men's and Mixed Challenge in August 2006 would be the first event they would organise, and that the event would be held in Fiji. The 2009 International Challenge Men‚Äôs and Mixed Netball Tournament was held in the Cook Islands. Currently, the International Federation of Netball Associations only recognises women's netball. The 2011 International Challenge Men‚Äôs and Mixed Netball Tournament was run by the Western Australian Men's and Mixed Netball Association (WAMMNA). It is the major international competition for men's and mixed gendered national netball teams. In the 2011 competition held in April, men's national teams from Samoa, Fiji, Australia, New Zealand and the Cook Islands are a few that will compete. In 2017 the Australian Championships, held on the Gold Coast, were live streamed for the first time. There were nearly 140,000 viewers around the world who viewed the last 43 matches on the final four days of competition. The 2017 Asian Men's Netball Championship, held in Putrajaya, Malaysia, was live streamed on Facebook. India won the final over Pakistan 51-50 in a thrilling match, while Singapore beat Malaysia 50-48 to win the bronze medal. Hong Kong finished fifth. The 2018 Australian Championships will take place in Sydney at Genea Netball Centre from April 1-7. The 2018 Trans Tasman Cup will be contested between Australia and New Zealand across four divisions (U20, U23, Open Mixed and Open Men's) from October 23-28 at Priceline Stadium in Adelaide. On 26 June 2019, the New Zealand Men's Netball side competed in their first televised match, beating the Fiji Women's team, the Pearls, 93-19.

It was built in 1684 for Lady Mary Calveley. After Lady Mary's death the estate passed by marriage to the Leghs of Lyme. In 1818 it was remodelled for Thomas Legh, and further alterations have been carried out during the 20th century. The house and estates in excess of around Aldersey, Aldford, Golborne David and Handley were put up for sale in 1827 to satisfy a judgement in the Court of Chancery. The hall and at least some of the lands were bought by George Woolrich, who then attempted to sell some parcels of it. In 1830, Woolrich tried to lease out the hall itself. Edward Davies Davenport was living there by 1835. The house is constructed in rendered brick with stone quoins. It stands on a stone plinth, has hipped roofs in Welsh slate, and three brick chimneys. The entrance front has three storeys, and is symmetrical with seven bays, the bays at the ends being slightly set back. The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner describes it as being \\"absolutely plain\\". Inside the house is a broad staircase with double twisted balusters, and newels carved with coats of arms, including those of Lady Mary. One of the rooms in the upper floor has an overmantel carved with the Calveley arms. The hall is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building.

Morag founded the Jewish Oral Traditions Research Center at the Hebrew University and served as the head of Ben Zvi Institute for the study of Jewish communities in the East for several years. He was a member of the Academy of the Hebrew Language and the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities, and a fellow of the American Academy of Jewish Research.  Family  Morag was born in Petah Tikva, in Mandate Palestine in 1926. Both his parents were teachers at Netzah Israel religious school in Petah Tikva. The family later moved to Ramat Gan, where Morag grew up and his younger brother Amotz was born. Young Shlomo MoragShlomo Morag's father, Rabbi Moshe Aryeh Mirkin, wrote an 11 volume commentary of Genesis Rabbah. Morag's mother, Sarah Mirkin (n√©e Margalit) founded charitable organizations for the benefit of children and women immigrants. She was elected as head of WIZO's branch in Ramat Gan, from which she resigned after struggling for equal voting rights for women, and not only for separate women's parties. She joined the General Zionists' women organization and from 1954 she served as a member of Ramat Gan's city council. Shlomo Morag dedicated his book, \\"the Hebrew Language Tradition of the Yemenite Jews\\", to his parents. Shlomo Morag's brother, Amotz Morag, was a professor of Economics and wrote for the Davar and Ashmoret newspapers. He wrote articles and books on economic issues. He also wrote short stories, some of which were collected after his death by Shlomo Morag.  Academic career  Shlomo MoragMorag commenced studying at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem in 1943. In 1955 he received his PhD for his thesis on the Hebrew pronunciation of the Yemenite Jews, which he wrote under the supervision of his teachers, Shelomo Dov Goitein, Hans Jakob Polotsky and Naftali Herz Tur-Sinai. Other teachers who influenced him were Joseph Klausner, David Baneth and Hanoch Yelon. He later joined the faculty of the Hebrew University and served as a professor at the department of Hebrew Language until he retired in 1994. Morag taught at Tel Aviv University and Bar-Ilan University as well. Morag's works focus on Semitic linguistics and specifically on the Hebrew language. He researched the oral traditions of Hebrew and dedicated a major part of his work to the oral traditions of the Yemenite Jews: the Yemenite Hebrew and the Yemenite Aramaic traditions. Shlomo Morag receiving the Bialik Prize = Awards = * In 1966, Morag was awarded the Israel Prize in Jewish studies, for his book \\"The Hebrew Language Tradition of the Yemenite Jews\\". He was the youngest person to receive this prize at the time. * In 1989, he was the co-recipient (jointly with Shmuel Abramski) of the Bialik Prize for Jewish thought. He received the prize for his book \\"Babylonian Aramaic: The Yemenite Tradition\\".  Works  = The Hebrew Language Tradition of the Yemenite Jews = The base for this book, for which Morag received the Israel Prize, was his PhD thesis. In this book he describes the Yemenite Hebrew, the traditional reading of the bible and the Mishnah. Morag distinguishes the Yemenite tradition from other Hebrew oral traditions for several reasons: * It is the only tradition that has a clear affinity to the Babylonian Hebrew tradition. This affinity is manifested in characteristics such as the use of one vowel whereas the Tiberian Hebrew tradition differentiate two vowels: patach and segol. * It is the only oral tradition that regularly differentiate between the Biblical Hebrew tradition, which generally adheres to the Tiberian tradition (though influenced by the Babylonian tradition that was previously the accepted tradition in Yemen), and the Mishnaic Hebrew tradition, which is mostly Babylonian (but influenced from the Tiberian tradition of the Bible). * This tradition maintains distinctions that were lost in other oral traditions, such as the Begadkefat phenomenon and the pronunciation of shva na. Shlomo Morag recording two Yemenite rabbis for the Jewish Oral Traditions Research Center In his book, Morag describes the phonetic and phonological characteristics of the Yemenite tradition, and examines the effects of different Yemeni Arabic dialects on the oral traditions of Yemenite Jews from different areas of Yemen. = Babylonian Aramaic: The Yemenite Tradition = This book, for which Morag was awarded the Bialik Prize, describes the phonology and morphology of the Yemenite tradition of the Aramaic of the Babylonian Talmud. The book is based on the reading tradition of Sana'ani Jews, as recorded mainly at the Jewish Oral Traditions Research Center at the Hebrew University which Morag founded. According to Shlomo Morag, the Yemenite tradition is the best reading tradition of the Jewish Babylonian Aramaic: * Its transmission is reliable and it preserved the phonological and morphological characteristics distinguishing it from reading traditions of texts in other Aramaic dialects: Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan. * There is a considerable correspondence between this tradition and the tradition of an important manuscript of the book Halachot Psukot, which exhibits a rather archaic tradition and uses the Babylonian vocalization. This correspondence also demonstrates the Babylonian elements in the Yemenite tradition. In his book, Morag brings evidence against the claim that the Talmud was not commonly taught in Yemen, and points out the Yemenite manuscripts of the Babylonian Talmud and their value for determining the characteristics of the Yemenite tradition.

It was built at the suggestion of Kim Eun-sung (citizen of Seoul City) in 2006. Seoul City made this island by Build- Transfer-Operate (BTO). It has 3 islands: Gavit, Chavit, and Solvit. Yevit is part of Sebitseom, but is not an island itself, but rather, it's an on-land multimedia art gallery complementing the three floating islands. Background Sebitseom, covering a combined area of 10,421„é° (Gavit: 4,881„é°, Chavit: 3,477„é°, Solvit: 1,271„é°, Yevit: 792„é°), was set to open as a private equity consortium in September 2011 containing convention halls and performance and display areas, along with commercial areas (e.g. restaurant, caf√©s, etc.), but due to managerial conflicts, the plan was indefinitely postponed. In September 2009, however, roughly $86 million (USD) were invested into Sebitseom (then-named Flo Some or ÌîåÎ°úÏÑ¨) to build the lobbies, decks, and rooftops of each island. As of May 2011, 47% of Some Sevit is owned by Hyosung Group; 10% is owned by Jinheung Company, an affiliate of Hyosung Group; and 29% is owned by SH Construction. Some Sevit has been managed and operated by a manufacturing firm named CR101. Monthly expenses on upkeep and rentals reach around $970,000 (USD) or an annual expense of roughly $11.6 million. The projected expenses is estimated to be over $268 million (unadjusted for inflation) during the next 25 years.

When it was reported that the show would focus on fur items, the Seoul government demanded fur to be excluded from the show \\"in response to protests from anti-fur activists about this use of a public venue.\\" In response to government demands, Fendi cited the lack of time left until the show (there were only weeks left before the show) and the time and money they had already spent in preparation. In response to the protest, however, Fendi decided to diminish the show's focus on fur by introducing a greater variety of items, such as shoes, bags, and other accessories. Earlier in the year, a popular SBS TV program, \\"TV Animal Farm,\\" aired an episode bringing awareness to the fur industry and to the living conditions of animals farmed for fur. It depicted actual footage of the process of collecting fur from live animals and shocked viewers, which may have impacted the number of protesters against the fashion show. Characteristic of each island * Gavit (Í∞ÄÎπõÏÑ¨, ‰Ω≥Â≥∂, Island 1, Vista): It is an island of performing arts.

The company's name, which had been previously \\"Asya Finans Kurumu Anonim ≈ûirketi\\" (Asya Finance Incorporated Company), was changed into \\"Asya Katilim Bankasi Anonim ≈ûirketi\\" (Asya Participation Bank Inc.) on December 20, 2005. Bank Asya, with an initial capital of TRY2 million and paid up capital of TRY900 million, had a multi-partnered structure based on domestic capital. At the end of 2009, Bank Asya‚Äôs total assets reached TRY14 billion. Bank Asya rose by 47 places in the ‚ÄúTop 1000 World Bank Ranking‚Äù of ‚ÄúThe Banker‚Äù Magazine in 2010, rising to 473 from 520. At the same time, Bank Asya ranked 403rd on ‚ÄúThe Banker‚Äôs Top 500 Banking Brands‚Äù. Bank Asya has also become the largest participation bank in Turkey. Bank Asya carried out its activities with 182 branches, 2 national and 1300 foreign correspondent banks besides the head office units as of May 2011. The bank has been strongly tied to the controversial G√ºlen movement, led by the Islamic cleric and preacher Fethullah G√ºlen, and is widely considered to be founded and operated by his followers. By the end of 2013, the relationship between the Gulen movement and the ruling AK Party soured, and the Gulen movement was declared a national security threat. Consequently, Bank Asya lost a large fraction of its deposits and its lucrative contracts with government agencies. Its net income plummeted 81% in the second quarter of 2014. Its stock is currently suspended from trading by BIST (Istanbul Stock Exchange), due to uncertainties regarding its ownership structure. Two separate acquisition deals (by Qatar Islamic Bank and by Turkish state owned Ziraat Bank) fell apart. Finally, on August 25, 2014, Moody's downgraded the bank with the statement \\"During this period, the bank's net income declined by 81% compared to last year. Additionally asset quality also deteriorated. These sharp deterioration trends in financial fundamentals resulted in lowering the bank's rating.\\" On 22 July 2016, the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BDDK) cancelled Bank Asya's banking permissions as part of the 2016 purges.

The field was discovered in 1970 by Signal-Amoco Consortium. The field is currently managed by the Saltpond Offshore Producing Company (SOPCL), Ghana's oldest producer of crude oil. Location The oil field is located west of Ghana's capital, Accra, in the Central region of Ghana. It is located about off the coast of Saltpond in the northern-central area of the Takoradi Arch, in water depth of . It extends over an area of . History =Original development= Saltpond Oil Field was discovered in 1970 after the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC) licensed Signal-Amoco Consortium to operate in Ghana's territorial waters. The initial appraisal of the field showed that the well would produce of oil. In 1976 Amoco relinquished the concession, citing the field as non-commercial. The concession was reassigned to Offshore Hydrocarbons Ltd., which later entered into a development farmout with Agri- Petco of the United States. In 1977-1978 Agri-Petco drilled six appraisal wells from a centrally located jackup rig called Mr. Louie. After the drilling, the jack-up was converted into a production unit and the field was put onstream in October 1978. In 1984, the field was reassigned to Primary Fuels Inc., which took over the operation for a year. In July 1985 GNPC took over the operation of the field. From 1978 to 1985 the maximum oil production was of oil. When operation stopped in 1985, the volume of production was . The estimated percentages of oil and gas that had been obtained from the field at the time of shutdown were 10.4% and 25%, respectively, with three of the six wells unable to produce oil. =Operation resumption= On 18 January 2000, GNPC entered into an agreement with Lushann International of Houston, Texas, for the rehabilitation of the Saltpond Oil Field and the implementation of the rig-less workover proposal. Lushann International contracted Eternit Universal Ltd. of Nigeria for the financing of the rehabilitation works. In August 2000, rehabilitation works commenced with the repair of the Mr. Louie platform. In 2002, Oildata's programme of rig-less workover discovered obstructions in the wells which prevented workers from reaching the bottom of most of the wells. When the workover was completed, only two wells were able to produce between of oil. Lushann International was also granted the right to develop up to 400 MW of power generation facilities to commercialize natural gas from the Saltpond Field. In 2002, the Government of Ghana began re-negotiating the agreement between GNPC and Lushann-Eternit Energy Ltd. The negotiations ended in 2004 with a new agreement in which GNPC's stake was increased from 40% to 45%, with Lushann-Eternit Energy Ltd. having 55%. The new agreement led to the creation of the Saltpond Offshore Producing Company, which markets the oil from the fields on the world market. The rig-less workover could not sustain high production, resulting in a drop of about . In 2005, operations were suspended so the rig-less workover could be replaced. Operations resumed in April 2006 with an increase in production to from two wells. In 2008, the diesel-fired generating plant was replaced by a natural gas-fired plant for utilization of natural gas from the field. This reduced production cost on the fields. A new storage vessel, MT Bonsu, was purchased for storage of oil from the field. It replaced the previously leased storage vessel MT African Wave, which had become dangerous to operate. By other sources, the reason for termination of the leasing contract was the inability of SOPCL to pay its outstanding bills. On 10 June 2010, GNPC announced that it pulls out of the Saltpond Offshore Producing Company. Reserves and production The estimated initially resource in place was of oil, of gas condensate, and of natural gas. After the field's operations were shut down in 1985, GNPC commissioned various geological and engineering studies to improve its knowledge of the nature of the field and to ascertain if long-term redevelopment was feasible. In 1986, Braspetro conducted a study in which an estimated and of natural gas was reported still in the field. Another study by Oil-data Wireline Services of Nigeria in 1999 recommended a rig-less workover for the redevelopment of the field. The cumulative production from beginning of operations to the shut-in in 1985 was of oil and of natural gas. The field currently produces about of oil. Incidents In April 2003, the storage vessel MT Asterias, operating at the Saltpond Oil Field, was alleged to have gone missing with of oil. It was seized by its owner, the Nigerian company Ocean & Oil Limited, due to non- payment of freight charges by Lushann International. According to authorities of Ghana, Lushann International was not paid any royalties, carried interests, training allowances and annual surface rentals which were mandatory under the petroleum laws of Ghana. In 2011, SOPCL was accused for leasing storage space in the MT Bonsu to its unidentified major off taker, who allegedly used MT Bonsu to bring in crude oil imported from other West African countries but supplied to the refinery at a high rate by claiming that the crude oil is imported from Brazil.

He served in the Boer War in 1898, joining the Natal Horse as a trooper. He was promoted to a captain and was awarded the King's and Queen's medals. In 1908, he resigned his commission after marrying Frances Hazard of Long Island, and moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada in 1909. There he founded a tanning company with business associates. However, he was called to military duty against with the outbreak of World War I and was a founding member of the Fort Garry Horse regiment, serving under the Canadian forces on the Western Front from 1914 to 1916 in France, during which he was promoted from captain to major. After the war he was again promoted to lieutenant-colonel and was the head of Bayonet Fighting. His sporting expertise saw him appointed head of physical training with the Canadian Air Force and in the same position in the UK for the RAF, which saw him awarded an MBE in January 1918. He later became based in Victoria, British Columbia and London. Mayes (standing left) and the 1913 Davis Cup Team Mayes was a good all-round sportsman, participating in polo, tennis and shooting on an international level. He excelled at tennis, and his hard-court play was reported to be his strongest surface and he enjoyed much popularity as a tennis player. Mayes was on the 1913 Canadian Davis Cup team along with J. F. Foulkes, Robert Powell and Bernie Schwengers. It was Canada's first entry into the Davis Cup and they reached the final of the Cup only to be defeated by the United States in the summer of 1913 at Wimbledon where the Cup was being held.

Such fields are also sometimes called multi-dimensional local fields. On the usual local fields (typically completions of number fields or the quotient fields of local rings of algebraic curves) there is a unique surjective discrete valuation (of rank 1) associated to a choice of a local parameter of the fields, unless they are archimedean local fields such as the real numbers and complex numbers. Similarly, there is a discrete valuation of rank n on almost all n-dimensional local fields, associated to a choice of n local parameters of the field.Fesenko, I.B., Vostokov, S.V. Local Fields and Their Extensions. American Mathematical Society, 1992, Chapter 1 and Appendix. In contrast to one-dimensional local fields, higher local fields have a sequence of residue fields.Fesenko, I., Kurihara, M. (eds.) Invitation to Higher Local Fields. Geometry and Topology Monographs, 2000, section 1 (Zhukov). There are different integral structures on higher local fields, depending how many residue fields information one wants to take into account. Geometrically, higher local fields appear via a process of localization and completion of local rings of higher dimensional schemes. Higher local fields are an important part of the subject of higher dimensional number theory, forming the appropriate collection of objects for local considerations. Definition Finite fields have dimension 0 and complete discrete valuation fields with finite residue field have dimension one (it is natural to also define archimedean local fields such as R or C to have dimension 1), then we say a complete discrete valuation field has dimension n if its residue field has dimension n‚àí1. Higher local fields are those of dimension greater than one, while one-dimensional local fields are the traditional local fields. We call the residue field of a finite-dimensional higher local field the 'first' residue field, its residue field is then the second residue field, and the pattern continues until we reach a finite field. Examples Two-dimensional local fields are divided into the following classes: *Fields of positive characteristic, they are formal power series in variable t over a one- dimensional local field, i.e. Fq((u))((t)). *Equicharacteristic fields of characteristic zero, they are formal power series F((t)) over a one- dimensional local field F of characteristic zero. *Mixed-characteristic fields, they are finite extensions of fields of type F, F is a one-dimensional local field of characteristic zero. This field is defined as the set of formal power series, infinite in both directions, with coefficients from F such that the minimum of the valuation of the coefficients is an integer, and such that the valuation of the coefficients tend to zero as their index goes to minus infinity. *Archimedean two-dimensional local fields, which are formal power series over the real numbers R or the complex numbers C. Constructions Higher local fields appear in a variety of contexts. A geometric example is as follows. Given a surface over a finite field of characteristic p, a curve on the surface and a point on the curve, take the local ring at the point. Then, complete this ring, localise it at the curve and complete the resulting ring. Finally, take the quotient field. The result is a two-dimensional local field over a finite field. There is also a construction using commutative algebra, which becomes technical for non-regular rings. The starting point is a Noetherian, regular, n-dimensional ring and a full flag of prime ideals such that their corresponding quotient ring is regular. A series of completions and localisations take place as above until an n-dimensional local field is reached. Topologies on higher local fields One-dimensional local fields are usually considered in the valuation topology, in which the discrete valuation is used to define open sets. This will not suffice for higher dimensional local fields, since one needs to take into account the topology at the residue level too. Higher local fields can be endowed with appropriate topologies (not uniquely defined) which address this issue. Such topologies are not the topologies associated with discrete valuations of rank n, if n > 1. In dimension two and higher the additive group of the field becomes a topological group which is not locally compact and the base of the topology is not countable. The most surprising thing is that the multiplication is not continuous, however, it is sequentially continuous which suffices for all reasonable arithmetic purposes. There are also iterated ind pro approaches to replace topological considerations by more formal ones.Fesenko, I., Kurihara, M. (eds.) Invitation to Higher Local Fields. Geometry and Topology Monographs, 2000, several sections. Measure, integration and harmonic analysis on higher local fields There is no translation invariant measure on two-dimensional local fields. Instead, there is a finitely additive translation invariant measure defined on the ring of sets generated by closed balls with respect to two-dimensional discrete valuations on the field, and taking values in formal power series R((X)) over reals.Fesenko, I. Analysis on arithmetic schemes. I. Docum. Math., (2003), Kato's special volume, 261-284 This measure is also countably additive in a certain refined sense. It can be viewed as higher Haar measure on higher local fields. The additive group of every higher local field is non-canonically self-dual, and one can define a higher Fourier transform on appropriate spaces of functions. This leads to higher harmonic analysis.Fesenko, I., Measure, integration and elements of harmonic analysis on generalized loop spaces, Proceed. St. Petersburg Math. Soc., vol. 12 (2005), 179-199; AMS Transl. Series 2, vol. 219, 149-164, 2006 Higher local class field theory Local class field theory in dimension one has its analogues in higher dimensions. The appropriate replacement for the multiplicative group becomes the nth Milnor K-group, where n is the dimension of the field, which then appears as the domain of a reciprocity map to the Galois group of the maximal abelian extension over the field. Even better is to work with the quotient of the nth Milnor K-group by its subgroup of elements divisible by every positive integer. Due to Fesenko theorem, this quotient can also be viewed as the maximal separated topological quotient of the K-group endowed with appropriate higher dimensional topology. Higher local reciprocity homomorphism from this quotient of the nth Milnor K-group to the Galois group of the maximal abelian extension of the higher local field has many features similar to those of the one-dimensional local class field theory. Higher local class field theory is compatible with class field theory at the residue field level, using the border map of Milnor K-theory to create a commutative diagram involving the reciprocity map on the level of the field and the residue field.Fesenko, I., Kurihara, M. (eds.) Invitation to Higher Local Fields. Geometry and Topology Monographs, 2000, section 5 (Kurihara). General higher local class field theory was developed by Kazuya Kato and by Ivan Fesenko. Higher local class field theory in positive characteristic was proposed by A. Parshin.

He was a deputy judge and junior solicitor in his early career, and after the Second World War he was a secretary in the Compensation Department of the Ministry of Justice. The Compensation Department was tasked with returning or otherwise compensating for items that had been confiscated during the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany. Torgersen was also present at the Nuremberg Trials of 1945 and 1946, and wrote the process document Germany's Crimes against Norway together with Finn Palmstr√∏m.Entry for Germany's Crimes against Norway in BIBSYS From 1948 to 1962 Torgersen was an assistant secretary in the Ministry of Justice.

He fought for the Parliamentary army in the English Civil War. Whitehead was baptised on 15 January 1594, the eldest son of Sir Henry Whitehead of Norman Court, Hampshire and his first wife Anne, daughter of James Weston, the chancellor of the Diocese of Lichfield. He was educated at Brasenose College, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1610, and was awarded BA in 1612. He studied law at the Inner Temple in 1613 and travelled abroad between 1614 and 1617. In 1628 he was elected Member of Parliament for Lymington and sat until 1629 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament for eleven years. Whitehead inherited the family estates at Shirley and Hill on the death of his father in 1629. In 1635 he was appointed High Sheriff of Hampshire when he had the task of collecting ship money for the county. He wrote to the council complaining of the backwardness of the county, and imprisoned a constable who failed to certify the defaulters and who argued that the money \\"would never be gathered during his lifetime\\". Nevertheless, he was ordered to collect the arrears, which stood at ¬£404. : 'Parishes: Millbrook', A History of the County of Hampshire: Volume 3 (1908), pp. 427-432. Date accessed: 15 June 2011 In April 1640, Whitehead was elected Member of Parliament for Hampshire in the Short Parliament. He was re-elected MP for Hampshire for the Long Parliament in November 1640. Whitehead became a faithful adherent of Parliament during the Civil War, possibly soured against the King's cause because of his experience with collecting ship money. He was one of the colonels of regiments in the Parliamentary army of Hampshire and Sussex, together with Richard Norton, Onslow, Jarvis, and Morley. Ruins of Bishop's Waltham Palace In 1643 Whitehead was appointed to extract large sums of money from Royalists on pain of imprisonment at Portsmouth, and is said to have remarked that he \\"had been at a great charge to build a cage at Portsmouth where many Hampton birds should sing very suddenly.\\" Under the command of General William Waller he was present at the siege of Basing House at the beginning of 1644. He also besieged Bishop's Waltham Palace, and obtained its surrender with the help of Major-General Richard Browne's London brigade. He was given permission \\"to pull down the house if he chose.\\" In June 1644 the House of Commons instructed him and others to sequestrate the estates of Papists and delinquents valued at less than ¬£12,000 within London and Westminster in order to pay off arrears to the garrisons of Portsmouth and of Hurst Castle, Southsea Castle and Calshot Castle. Whitehead was married three times. His first wife, by a marriage settlement dated 1 August 1621, was Margery Culliford, daughter of John Culliford of Encombe, Dorset. The couple had three sons and eight daughters, among whom were Henry, Richard's heir and MP for Portsmouth in 1660 and Stockbridge from 1679 to 1680, and Richard, who sat for Stockbridge in 1659 and 1660. Richard remarried c.1640 to Lucy, daughter of Robert Dove, vicar of St Neots, Huntingdonshire between 1616 and 1622. Lucy was the widow of Richard Organ of Lambourn, Berkshire. Richard Organ had died by 1638. The couple had no children, with Lucy dying in 1652. Richard Whitehead then married Cecilia, daughter of Richard Browne of Betchworth Castle, Surrey. Cecilia had been twice married already, and was the widow of firstly Robert Edolph of Hinxhill, Kent, and secondly of Sir Francis Knollys of Reading, Berkshire. Richard Whitehead died c. 1663. His will, dated 22 December 1659, was proved on 17 May 1664. His third wife outlived him, dying in 1677.

The Nazis imprisoned her in 1942 and she died in Auschwitz. Deborah (Desir√©e) Lifchitz (at times spelled Lifschitz, Lifszyc or Livchitz) was born in Kharkiv, Russia in 1907. In 1919, following the October Revolution, her family left Kharkiv, first to Crimea and from there in 1920 to Warsaw. In 1927 Deborah left Poland for Paris, where she studied Oriental languages and specialized in the Semitic languages of Ethiopia. Upon her graduation she joined the Mission Dakar Djibouti to Africa. There she met with the Beta Israel (Jews of Ethiopia). After her return to Paris, Deborah received a position at the Africa department of the Mus√©e de l'Homme in Paris and in 1935 she was member of Mission du Mus√©e d'Ethnographie du Trocadero to French Sudan (Mali). From Mali she brought back two museum pieces of Dogon art currently displayed in the Louvre and the Quai Branly museums. Deborah Lifchitz wrote one book and several articles, which are still considered milestones in the research of Ethiopian languages. She received her French nationality in 1937. When the Nazis entered Paris, Deborah stayed in the city, and after losing her jobs because of the racial laws she was taken in by her colleague Michel Leiris. In February 1942 she was arrested by the French police, taken to French concentration camp, and from there to Auschwitz where she died later that year. According to the testimony of Marcel Cohen she was gassed. During her studies and work at the Mus√©e de l'Homme, Deborah Lifchitz studied and collaborated with the greatest anthropologists and Africanists in Paris of the day, among them Michel Leiris, Wolf Leslau, Marcel Griaule, Marcel Mauss, Marcel Cohen, Paul Boyer, Paul Rivet, Georges Dum√©zil, Denise Paulme, with whom she wrote many articles, and more.

It is part of his first cantata cycle in Leipzig.  History and words  Bach composed in his first year in Leipzig for St. John's Day, soon after he had taken up his position as Thomaskantor. He had delivered an ambitious cantata in 14 movements, , in the first service as cantor on 30 May 1723. In comparison, his first cantata for a saint's feast day in five movements is small scale. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from the Book of Isaiah, \\"the voice of a preacher in the desert\\" (), and from the Gospel of Luke, the birth of John the Baptist and the Benedictus of Zechariah (). The unknown poet took some phrases from the Gospel, such as the beginning of movement 2, \\"\\" (Praise be to the Lord God of Israel), as in the canticle. The poetry follows the thought that Jesus, born of a woman (), is predicted to redeem sins, which are represented by the image of the serpent. The poetry concludes with the request to sing praises like Zechariah, fulfilled in the closing chorale, the fifth stanza of Johann Gramann's \\"\\" (1549).  Scoring and structure  The cantata in five movements is scored like chamber music for four vocal soloists (soprano, alto, tenor and bass), a four-part choir only in the closing chorale, clarino, oboe da caccia, oboe, two violins, viola, and basso continuo. The clarino only doubles the melody of the chorale. # Aria (tenor): # Recitative (alto): # Duet aria (soprano, alto): # Recitative (bass): # Chorale:  Music  Different from his first cantatas performed in Leipzig, Bach begins the cantata not with a chorus, but with an aria. Possibly Bach looked at the canticle of Zechariah as an individual's song of praise. The aria is accompanied only by the strings, sometimes a solo violin, sometimes a dense texture of all strings. The following recitative, referring to St. John and Jesus in the course of redemption, ends in an arioso on the lines (to delight with grace and love, and to lead to the kingdom of Heaven in true remorse). This arioso is accompanied by an ostinato movement in the continuo in \\"a semiquaver, quasi-Alberti figuration\\". The following duet, accompanied by an obbligato oboe da caccia (the first recorded use of the instrument), achieves a dense texture because the voices and the oboe operate in the same range, often in homophony. The middle section of the da capo structure is again in two different parts. The first part leaves the \\"three beats in a measure\\" of the opening section for \\"common time\\", four beats. A canon of the voices is accompanied by its beginning motif played both in the oboe and the continuo. The second part returns to the 3/4 but again in new material, endless jubilating runs and repetitions, expressing the joy that \\"we have, praise God, experienced\\". The following recitative ends again in an arioso, when it comes to the request to sing praises like Zechariah. At this point the melody of the following chorale is already present in the bass voice on the words \\"\\" (and voice unto him a song of praise). The closing chorale is a general song of praise. Bach did not simply set the melody for four parts, as usual. Instead, he finally used all instruments and voices together. The oboe doubles the violin, a clarino (slide trumpet) comes in for its only appearance, doubling the soprano, the choir is embedded in a concerto of the orchestra. This chorale fantasia setting anticipates the closing chorales of Bach's Christmas Oratorio and Ascension Oratorio, composed more than a decade later.

The first beam engines did not generate power by rotating a shaft but were developed as water pumps, mostly for draining mines. By coupling this pump with a water wheel, they could be used to drive machinery. The steam engine was not, as widely held, the cause of the Industrial Revolution, but rather arose as a result of it. The primary power source of the Revolution, certainly in the 18th century, was the water wheel, not the steam engine.  The need for an independent prime-mover  = Blowing engines = The origins of the water-returning engine begin with blowing engines used to provide the draught for blast furnaces and smelters. Although early furnaces may have been powered by human- or animal-powered bellows, once the Industrial Revolution began the new enlarged furnaces were blown by water wheel-powered blowing houses. Smelters are most economically located near the source of their ore, which may not have suitable water power available nearby. There is also the risk of drought interrupting the water supply, or of expanding demand for the furnace outstripping the available water capacity. In 1754 one furnace in the Weald was so drought-stricken that its manager considered hiring workmen to turn the wheel as a treadmill. = Rolling mills = As well as an inability to work in periods of drought, the amount of water available could also vary the power of machinery powered by it. The amount and type of work to be carried out by heavy industries could be influenced by the seasonal availability of water. In 1785 Kirkstall Forge near Leeds wrote to a customer, 'It will be convenient for us just now to roll a few tons because we have a full supply of water--and we cannot manufacture thin plate so well when our water is short.' This variation in water wheel power according to the water available also led to developments in water wheel design, Rennie's venetian- blind 'hatch' allowed a controlled water flow, whatever the depth of the mill leat, and unlike a simple sluice could always offer the greatest head possible. Problems of water supply would affect ironmasters for some time to come. In the 1830s, the young Alfred Krupp was still beset by problems with water shortage in the Berne brook, driving the hammers of his Gusstahlfabrik. Owing to a lack of finance, it was not until 1836 that Alfred was able to build a steam hammer, independent of this water supply.  Water-returning engines  These restrictions led to the very earliest form of steam engine used for power generation rather than pumping, the water-returning engine. With this engine, a steam pump was used to raise water that in turn drove a water wheel and thus the machinery. Water from the wheel was then returned by the pump. These early steam engines were only suitable for pumping water, and could not be connected directly to the machinery. The first practical examples of these engines were installed in 1742 at Coalbrookdale and as improvements to the Carron Ironworks on the Clyde in 1765. Richard Ford at Coalbrookdale first tried using horse pumps in 1735. The first engines were atmospheric beam engines to either Newcomen, Smeaton or Watt's systems. A cylinder was provided on opposite sides of the beam, one as the working cylinder supplied with steam and the other as the pumping cylinder. The engines were single-acting, the power stroke being downwards at the power cylinder, and the pump being a simple upward-acting bucket pump. The Watt engines were of Watt's early single-acting atmospheric designs. By the time of his later thermodynamic improvements, he had also developed his sun and planet gear and could offer engines that rotated directly. A large single-acting engine, Resolution, was built at Coalbrookdale and by the time it was delivered in 1782, it had already been obsoleted by these further developments. Despite this, the engine worked successfully for almost forty years. As well as blowing furnaces, the rotary output of the water wheel was also used to drive mills and factory equipment, by use of lineshafts. In 1765 Matthew Boulton considered using a Savery engine to power the waterwheel of his Soho Manufactory. He went so far as to build a model of this engine and sought the advice of both Benjamin Franklin and Erasmus Darwin on the subject. By 1768 though, the promise of Watt's beam engine convinced him to wait, even though it would be several years until Watt's Kinneil engine was brought South and rebuilt at Soho. In 1777 Boulton and Watt built a new engine, Old Bess, for their use. The engine still survives in the Science Museum. Water-returning engines were superseded by the rotative beam engine, that could power rotating machinery directly.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 21, 1978, and represents a significant period in the settlement and ranching of the Guadalupe Mountains. History The ranch was built about 1876 by the Rader Brothers in the Guadalupe Mountains next to Frijole Spring and comprises seven buildings: the ranch house, a bunkhouse, a barn, a double outhouse, a springhouse, a shed, and a school house. With the exception of the barn and school house, the buildings are constructed of local stone rubble, and all buildings are surrounded by a stone rubble wall. The complex represents the most complete early ranching operation in the Guadalupe Mountains. The ranch was built in close proximity to several other springs, whose surrounding area was inhabited by Native Americans from prehistory. The Rader brothers, the first settlers on the southeast side of the mountains, left the area in the late 1880s. The Herring family of North Carolina occupied the ranch for a time between the late 1880s and 1895, with Herring daughter Ida marrying George W. Wolcott in 1888. The Wolcotts moved to Midland, Texas in 1895. The Smith family occupied the previously vacant ranch from 1906, calling it \\"Spring Hill Ranch.\\" The Smiths expanded the ranch and operated a truck farm, expanding the farm house and building the bunkhouse and school house. They invested in a hydraulic ram to pump water and installed a carbide lamp system in the house, later changing to electric lights operated by a wind generator. The Smiths operated a post office at the site from 1916 to 1942. John Smith sold the ranch to Judge Jesse Coleman Hunter of Van Horn, Texas for $55,000 in 1942 and moved to Hawley, Texas. Hunter assembled the \\"Guadalupe Mountains Ranch\\" of , producing, among other things, mohair wool. The ranch house was the home of ranch foreman Noel Kincaid from 1942 to 1969. Hunter began to advocate the region for a national park in 1925. Hunter's son, J.C. Junior, inherited the ranch in 1945 and continued his father's work, expanding the ranch to , eventually selling the land to the National Park Service in 1966 for $1.5 million. National Park The ranch buildings were used by the National Park Service as employee residence and utility buildings from 1969 to 1980. From 1983 to 1991 the house was a Park Service operations center. The house was restored in 1992 and is an interpretive center and museum, known as the Frijole Ranch Cultural Museum.

Upon the latter's return, Anderson, together with Harding Smith, was joint chairman of the UDA until he stood down in the spring of 1973. In the battle between Harding Smith and East Belfast brigadier, Tommy Herron for the succession to the leadership, a compromise candidate, Andy Tyrie, was appointed as chairman. UDA formation Anderson, a Protestant glazier from the Crumlin Road area of Belfast, was an early member of a loyalist vigilante group, the Woodvale Defence Association (WDA). Anderson's base of operation was the mid-Shankill, which runs parallel to the Crumlin Road, where he garnered a reputation as a good organiser and worked closely with Billy Hull.McDonald, Henry & Cusack, Jim (2004). The UDA ‚Äì Inside the Heart of Loyalist Terror. Dublin: Penguin Ireland. p. 19 Anderson was present at the September 1971 meeting where the Woodvale Defence Association merged with other vigilante groups to form the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). At this meeting Hull was chosen as chairman of the new group with Alan Moon of the lower Shankill vice-chairman; although before long Anderson replaced Moon in this role.McDonald & Cusack, p. 20 Moon, who had become reluctant to be involved in vigilantism since the group's formation, willingly stepped aside and ended his association with the UDA soon afterwards.Steve Bruce, The Red Hand, Oxford University Press, 1992, p. 50 The structure of this new movement soon took shape with a thirteen-man Security Council established in January 1972 as a reaction to a Provisional IRA bomb the previous month at the Balmoral furniture showroom on the Shankill which killed four people including two infants. Anderson was one of the members of this Council.McDonald & Cusack, p. 22 Leadership In April 1972, the organisation's leader, Charles Harding Smith and leading UDA member John White were arrested in London for gun-trafficking.Taylor, Peter (1999). Loyalists. London: Bloomsbury Publishing Plc. p.103 A temporary de facto leadership assumed control and Anderson became the acting chairman of the UDA. Under his command, the UDA was structured along British Army lines into battalions, companies, platoons and sections. The organisation drew more members, becoming the largest loyalist paramilitary organisation in Northern Ireland. Unlike its principal rival, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), the UDA was legal. Anderson's own rank in the organisation was Major General; he served in its B Company, 2nd Battalion, West Belfast Brigade.McDonald & Cusack, p. 25 At the end of May 1972, Davy Fogel, leader of B Company and Harding Smith's second-in-command, erected the first UDA roadblocks and street barricades, making Woodvale, the area under Fogel's command, a no-go area. This was done with Anderson's approval and enthusiastic support.Wood, Ian S. (2006). Crimes of loyalty: a history of the UDA. Edinburgh University Press. p.8 The operation attracted a great deal of media and press coverage, resulting in much publicity for the UDA. Anderson had been one of a number of leading UDA figures to discuss a settlement of the issue with British Army representatives on the ground, where amongst the offers made was the possibility of joint UDA-Army patrols on the Shankill.McDonald & Cusack, p. 29 That summer the UDA marched through the streets of central Belfast in a massive demonstration of strength. Anderson was part of a deputation from the \\"United Loyalist Council\\", an umbrella loyalist group comprising the UDA, Loyalist Association of Workers (LAW), members of the Orange Order, and led by the chairman of Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party, William Craig, who met with Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, William Whitelaw at Stormont on 19 December 1972. Internal power struggle In December 1972, Harding Smith and White were acquitted and returned to Belfast. Immediately after their return, a fierce power struggle ensued after Harding Smith declared to his associates: \\"I'm the boss. I take orders from no one\\".McDonald & Cusack, p. 34 Fogel was promptly ousted from the B Company command, while the formidable East Belfast brigadier, Tommy Herron, appeared on the scene to challenge Harding Smith's leadership. Anderson became joint chairman of the UDA with Harding Smith.Taylor, p.114 The struggle that ensued between Harding Smith and Herron overshadowed the Inner Council and during the height of the feud Anderson often had to call a register at its meetings, so poor were the turnouts.McDonald & Cusack, p. 33 Herron and Anderson became linked and the East Belfast brigadier took to styling himself as deputy leader to Anderson, whom he treated as sole chairman.McDonald & Cusack, p. 38 By spring 1973, however, Fogel had already returned to his native England, and Anderson decided to stand down. He publicly announced his resignation as joint chairman in March 1973, in part because he was a fairly law-abiding individual who sat uneasily with violently chaotic figures like Harding Smith and Herron. It had been Anderson who had been one of the main thinkers behind the UDA's motto \\"Law Before Violence\\" although this was ditched shortly after his resignation in favour of \\"Quis separabit\\".McDonald & Cusack, p. 64 As a compromise candidate between the rival factions of Harding Smith and Herron, Andy Tyrie, commander of West Belfast Brigade's A Company, was chosen as the UDA's chairman. He would soon become the UDA's Supreme Commander, a position he held until an attempted car bombing brought about his retirement in March 1988.Taylor, p.200 Subsequent activity Anderson retained his UDA membership but no longer took an active role in the organisation. Notwithstanding this, however, he was still viewed by the Provisional IRA as a legitimate target. On 19 November 1974, as Anderson was in his glazier's shop with Billy Hull (who had also scaled back his active involvement in the UDA despite retaining his membership), an IRA gunman entered and shot both men several times. Neither man was killed in the attack.McDonald & Cusack, p. 90 A call to the BBC initially led to the attack being described as the work of Ulster Young Militants, the youth wing of the UDA, but this proved to be a hoax and the attack was later shown to have been carried out by Provisional IRA members from Ardoyne.Bruce, The Red Hand, p. 102 References Category:Ulster Defence Association members Category:People from Belfast Category:1931 births Category:Living people Category:Irish unionists Category:Glaziers ","title":"Jim Anderson (loyalist)"},{"id":"32092370","text":"Coleophora heringi is a moth of the family Coleophoridae.

Resolution =Observations= The Security Council noted that the Cypriot government had agreed to the continued presence of UNFICYP on the island. A solution to the conflict was down to the Cypriots themselves, and there was a unique opportunity to achieve a lasting settlement. There was progress in the peace talks though the Council remained concerned that progress was slow and at the \\"unacceptability\\" of the status quo. It welcomed the implementation of confidence-building measures by both Cyprus and Northern Cyprus and encouraged further crossing points to be opened along the Green Line. The Council remained convinced that a durable settlement of the Cyprus dispute would be beneficial for all Cypriots and the situation in the buffer zone would improve if both sides accepted the 1989 aide-m√©moire used by the United Nations. It was convinced that undermining the credibility of the United Nations was detrimental to the peace process. Furthermore, the Council welcomed progress in demining activities, the efforts of the Committee on Missing Persons, and agreed that the active participation of civil society groups and bi-communal contacts was essential to the political process. There was a need to focus public messages on the \\"way ahead\\". =Acts= The resolution welcomed the progress of negotiations and the prospect of progress in the near future towards a settlement. In this regard, it called on the two Cypriot leaders to intensify negotiations, improve their atmosphere, and increase the participation of civil society. Furthermore, both sides were called upon to participate in consultations on the demarcation of the buffer zone and the 1989 aide-m√©moire.

It a block away from the Palazzo Fioravanti. Description It was begun in 1320 by Vinciguerra d'Astancollo Panciatichi, a rich Ghibelline (later Guelph) banker, as a fortified private residence. Vinciguerra had been exiled from the town by Cialdo de Cancellieri during 1278 to 1312, and during part of this interval, he served King Phillip the Fair as a mercenary general in Normandy. He returned in 1313-1314 to fight on the side of the Ghibelline Uggocione and was victorious in the Battle of Montecatini in 1315, allowing him to return to Pistoia.Tour entries for Pistoia.Pistoia e il suo territorio: Pescia e i suoi dintorni: guida del forestiero, by Giuseppe Tigri, Tipografia Cino, Pistoia (1853): page 226. The palace has a stone fa√ßade with three floors. The ground floor has wide arches, while lower with arches) ending with a large overhanging cornice. A few remaining original Guelph merlons along the roofline, can be seen on the eastern side. An uncommon feature of Italian contemporary architecture were the squared windows, which were more widespread in French Gothic architecture or in Aosta Valley at the time. The interior houses a portico with a garden, a large staircase leading to the first floor, which has a hall with wooden ceiling, and a loggia. History This palace is notable for the inhabitants and visitors over the centuries. In 1057, it was occupied by Bellino di Pancio. Attanai returned to this house in 1187 from the second crusade and left for the third in 1219. In 1261, Astancollo, count of Lucciano became head of the Ghibelline faction in Pistoia; but five years later, after the defeat in the Battle of Benevento of the Ghibelline army led by King Manfred of Hohenstaufen, led to a mass expulsion of the fraction from Pistoia, including Vinciguerra. Martino Panciatichi lived here, he is known as the Ghibelline warrior who blocked the re-entry of Fillipo Tedici into Pistoia, slaying and decapitating Tedici at a bridge near San Marcello Piteglio. Putatively a sculpted head on display in the church of Sant'Andrea represents Tedici, who was despised by Pistoians for having betrayed and sold their city to the bellicose leader of Lucca, Castruccio Castracani. Also living in this house was Giovanni Panciatichi, who in 1329 mended the disputes between his family and that of the Cancellieri. Factions led by the latter family burned this palace a number of times during the 15th and 16th centuries. In 1409, Corrado, the son of the above Giovanni, allowed for his palace to host Pope Alexander V, who had come to pray before the relics of St Atto. As subsequent owner, Andrea di Gualtieri, allowed Lorenzo il Magnifico, in 1478 to stay here while the plague raged in Florence. The Gualtieri family, loyal to the Medici, housed various members and supporters of that Florentine family at the house. In 1579, the house came into the property of the Cellesi family, who had received the title of \\"bal√¨\\" of the Order of Saint Stephen.Tigri, pages 227-228. Palazzo Panciatichi was damaged by an Allied aerial bombing in 1943 and remained abandoned until its restoration in 1965-1967. It currently houses the council of the province of Pistoia.

A parahoric subgroup is a proper subgroup that is a finite union of double cosets of an Iwahori subgroup, so is analogous to a parabolic subgroup of an algebraic group. Iwahori subgroups are named after Nagayoshi Iwahori, and \\"parahoric\\" is a portmanteau of \\"parabolic\\" and \\"Iwahori\\". studied Iwahori subgroups for Chevalley groups over p-adic fields, and extended their work to more general groups. Roughly speaking, an Iwahori subgroup of an algebraic group G(K), for a local field K with integers O and residue field k, is the inverse image in G(O) of a Borel subgroup of G(k). A reductive group over a local field has a Tits system (B,N), where B is a parahoric group, and the Weyl group of the Tits system is an affine Coxeter group. Definition More precisely, Iwahori and parahoric subgroups can be described using the theory of affine Tits buildings. The (reduced) building B(G) of G admits a decomposition into facets. When G is quasisimple the facets are simplices and the facet decomposition gives B(G) the structure of a simplicial complex; in general, the facets are polysimplices, that is, products of simplices. The facets of maximal dimension are called the alcoves of the building. When G is semisimple and simply connected, the parahoric subgroups are by definition the stabilizers in G of a facet, and the Iwahori subgroups are by definition the stabilizers of an alcove. If G does not satisfy these hypotheses then similar definitions can be made, but with technical complications. When G is semisimple but not necessarily simply connected, the stabilizer of a facet is too large and one defines a parahoric as a certain finite index subgroup of the stabilizer. The stabilizer can be endowed with a canonical structure of an O-group, and the finite index subgroup, that is, the parahoric, is by definition the O-points of the algebraic connected component of this O-group. It is important here to work with the algebraic connected component instead of the topological connected component because a nonarchimedean local field is totally disconnected. When G is an arbitrary reductive group, one uses the previous construction but instead takes the stabilizer in the subgroup of G consisting of elements whose image under any character of G is integral. Examples *The maximal parahoric subgroups of GLn(K) are the stabilizers of O-lattices in Kn. In particular, GLn(O) is a maximal parahoric. Every maximal parahoric of GLn(K) is conjugate to GLn(O). *Similarly, the maximal parahoric subgroups of SLn(K) are the stabilizers of O-lattices in Kn, and SLn(O) is a maximal parahoric. Unlike for GLn(K), however, SLn(K) has conjugacy classes of maximal parahorics.

Work rate is generally indicated by the distance covered by a player during a match. An example of a player with a high work rate is Xavi, a former midfielder for Barcelona and Spain. During the final of the 2010‚Äì11 UEFA Champions League, Xavi ran almost 12 km, more than any other player in the game. The same is true of the final of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, when he covered a distance of 14.98 km (including extra time). A high work rate is valued because players with this characteristic will be able to play a more active role in defending and attacking throughout a match. Conversely, players are sometimes criticized for low work rate; for instance, ESPN Soccernet correspondent Sam Limbert highlighted a poor work rate as one of the weaker qualities of Arsenal midfielder Den√≠lson Pereira Neves. However, some experts, such as former Brazil and S√£o Paulo youth coach Carlos de Lorenzi, warn against the danger of equating high work rate with high talent.

Thornton also stars alongside Robert Duvall, John Hurt, Kevin Bacon, Ray Stevenson, Frances O'Connor, Ron White, and Robert Patrick. The film had its world premiere at the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival in February 2012. The film was released in limited release on September 13, 2013. One of the locations in which the movie was shot is Cedartown, Georgia, USA. Exterior home shots were filmed in Troup County, Georgia, while additional scenes were shot in Decatur, Georgia. For the Greek Revival home, the interior shots were filmed at The Bailey-Tebault House located in Griffin, Georgia. Plot The film is set in 1969 Morrison, Alabama. The Caldwell family includes three World War II veterans‚Äîbrothers played by Thornton, Bacon and Patrick‚Äîtheir sister Donna (LaNasa), and a patriarch, Jim Caldwell (Duvall), who is a World War I veteran. The Caldwells are involved in a cultural clash with the Bedfords, a family which includes Phillip (Stevenson), a World War II veteran, his sister Camilla (O'Connor), and their father Kingsley (Hurt), also a World War I veteran. The Bedfords are a London family in Morrison for the funeral of Kingsley's wife, who is the ex-wife of Jim Caldwell and the mother of Caldwell's children. Duvall described the film in an interview as \\"putting Tennessee Williams in the back seat\\". The film's title refers to the automobile in which movie star Jayne Mansfield was supposedly decapitated in 1967. When a nearby town has a side show displaying the vehicle, Jim Caldwell takes Kingsley Bedford along to gawk at the grisly artifact. Cast Critical reception , the film holds a 35% approval rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 37 reviews with an average rating of 5.42 out of 10. The website's consensus reads, \\"Jayne Mansfield's Car assembles an impressive number of talented actors, but the screenplay ‚Äî co- written by director and star Billy Bob Thornton ‚Äî never gives them much of anything to do.\\" Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 48 out of 100, based on 18 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Lou Lumenick of the New York Post gave credit to the film's \\"star-laden\\" cast, commending the presences of Duvall, Hurt and Thornton but was critical of its \\"overlong\\" runtime. PopMatters contributor J.C. Macek III found criticism in Thornton's unfocused direction of the multiple stories and the screenplay being more suited for a mini-series than a condensed two hour film filled with vignettes. He did however gave praise to the performances for adding substance to their given arcs, singling out Bacon, O'Connor and White as the highlights. Norm Schrager from Paste commended Thornton's direction for bringing out great performances from the cast and his scenes having competent execution but felt the film overall suffered from \\"a distinctive lack of cohesiveness\\" throughout the script in its handling of plot concepts and themes, concluding that, \\"[T]here‚Äôs something here. It just needs a clearer road to travel.\\" Alonso Duralde of TheWrap also voiced problems with Thornton and Epperson's screenplay, calling it \\"too sprawling and [too] tidy\\" with its generational family drama and misuse of plot devices towards the third act. Claudia Puig of USA Today felt the familial themes were elevated by \\"intriguingly impressionistic cinematography and a strong ensemble cast\\", but criticized the characterization of both families for containing stereotypical rednecks and stuffy aristocrats that conduct \\"tedious monologues and theatrical speechifying\\" and the misuse of the film's title for lacking \\"insight and depth.\\" She concluded that: \\"Self-indulgent, heavy-handed and lumbering, Jayne Mansfield's Car is not a wreck, but it's certainly a vehicle for boredom.\\" References External links  * Category:2012 films Category:American films Category:American drama films Category:English- language films Category:Films directed by Billy Bob Thornton Category:Films set in Alabama Category:Films set in the 1960s Category:Films set in 1969 Category:Films shot in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Jayne Mansfield Category:2012 drama films ","title":"Jayne Mansfield's Car"},{"id":"32092689","text":"Coleophora crypsiphanes is a moth of the family Coleophoridae that is endemic to Sri Lanka.

Trail pheromones often serve as a multi purpose chemical secretion that leads members of its own species towards a food source, while representing a territorial mark in the form of an allomone to organisms outside of their species.E.O. Wilson and M. Pavan. 1959. Source and Specificity of chemical releasers of social behavior in the dolichoderine ants. Psyche 65: 41-51 Specifically, trail pheromones are often incorporated with secretions of more than one exocrine gland to produce a higher degree of specificity.E.O. Wilson. 1962. Chemical communication among workers of the fire ant Solenopsis saevissima (Fr. Smith). 3. The experimental induction of social responses. Anim. Behav. 10:159-164. Considered one of the primary chemical signaling methods in which many social insects depend on, trail pheromone deposition can be considered one of the main facets to explain the success of social insect communication today. Many species of ants, including those in the genus Crematogaster use trail pheromones.  Background  In 1962, Harvard professor Edward O. Wilson published one of the first concrete studies constructing the groundwork for the notion of trail pheromones. Claiming an odor trail is deposited by the sting apparatus of the hymenopteran Solenopsis saevissima which results in a pathway from the colony to a food source, this study encouraged further investigation of how this chemical is laid, how it affects communication between species within and outside of its own, the evolution of the semiochemical, etc. Fire ants are an example of a social insect species who depend on trail pheromones to obtain food for their colony.  Mechanism  The pheromone is synthesized in the same region as venom, or other primary hormonal departments within the organism. Often, trail pheromone synthesis occurs in the ventral venom gland, poison gland, Dufour's gland, sternal gland, or hindgut.Chapman, R.F. 1998. The insects Structure and Function. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK.. When secreted, the pheromone is dropped in a blotch-like fashion from the foraging organism onto the surface leading to the food source. As the organism proceeds to the food source, the trail pheromone creates a narrow and precise pathway between the food source and the nesting location, which another organism of the same species, and often the same nest, follows precisely. Commonly, an organism, when initially laying down the trail may renew the trail a number of times to demonstrate the value of the food source while running in tandem.M.Moglich, U. Maschwitz, and B. Holldobler. 1974. Tandem calling: A new kind of signal in ant communication. Science (Wash.) 186: 1046-1047. Once the trail is laid, other members of the species will recognize the chemical signal and follow the trail, and each individually renew the trail on the way back to the home source. While this pheromone is constantly deposited by its members, the chemicals diffuse up into the environment propagating its message. Once the food source runs out the organisms will simply skip the task of renewing the trail on the way back, thus resulting in the diffusion and weakening of the pheromone.M.S. Blum 1970 . The chemical basis of insect society. In Chemicals controlling Insect Behavior. M. Beroza, Ed Academic, New York, pp. 61-94 Studies have shown that with quality of food, distance from nest, and amounts of food, the strength of the trail pheromone may vary. Often the foraging individual may synthesize the trail pheromone as a mixture of chemicals produced by different glands which allows such specificity. While members of the same species who discovered the food constantly renew this trail pathway, as the chemical is secreted into the environment as a signal for food in their umwelt, the very same chemical can often be interpreted as a territorial mark for outside species.  Ecological significance  Trail pheromone deposition from an organism is correlated with its environment. In the event where a food source is identified and a trail pheromone is deposited, certain wildlife may flock towards or away from the trail causing temporary or dispersal of the population or individual. With relocation of wildlife, surrounding plant life may change as well; for example, pollen attached to the migrating organism is also relocating, thus may potentially regenerate in different patches. = Abiotic factors affecting trail pheromones = *Temperature **When the foraging organism's optimal foraging temperature is present, the organism will be more likely to search for food. Often, the further temperature falls out of this range, the less likely foraging will occur, thus, the less likely trail pheromones will be deposited. *Season **alongside with temperature, foraging occurs more during some seasons than others. With a change in season comes additional factors: a change in predators organism to avoid, change in food supply, and change in light availability. Often foraging organisms choose preference over such factors. *Humidity **If it is too humid or not enough, organisms may choose not to forage *Other chemicals **Other surrounding chemicals may interfere with strength of pheromones. = Biotic factors affecting trail pheromones = *Surrounding animals **Although the pheromone may diffuse off as a territorial representation of the foraging organism, that does not secure the safety of the organism.D.J. McGurk, J frost, E.J. Eisenbraun, K. Vick, W.A. Drew, and J. Young. 1966. Volatile compounds in ants: Identification of 4-methyl-3-heptanone from Pogonomyrmex ants. J Insect Physiol. 12:1433-1441 In fact, this act may do the opposite and attract competing wildlife. With more surrounding predators, or competitors, comes more difficulty with foraging for a food source. Especially in cases were food is scarce, surrounding organism. Depending on the cost vs benefits tradeoff, an organism, in a situation where it may need the food supply, may be willing to risk the dangers to obtain it. Also, with more predators or competitors out there, the risks of foraging increase. *Surrounding plants **Factors such as type and abundance of surrounding plants in an environment may certainly affect the degree of trail pheromone potency. Plants residing in close proximity to the odor trail may emit an abundance of chemicals which can either mask, change, or possibly even help propagate the signal. Additionally, areas saturated with plant life may block or alter trail pheromone diffusion.

Alexander Easson and Charles Clark at the Dens Works in Dundee. By the mid-1850s he had gone into partnership with William Ritchie (c.1818-1902) and their firm, Messrs. Ritchie, Simpson & Co., which began with flax spinning mills in Maxwellton and Hawkhill. Later the firm had works in Ward Road, Nelson Street and Lower Pleasance. A decade later the firm had diversified into jute manufacturing. Simpson‚Äôs increasing prosperity by that time enabled him to move to Seafield House in fashionable Broughty Ferry. (Grove Academy was later built on the site of this house). He began also to rival local patrons in the arts. However, a downturn in trade in the 1870s brought an end to his partnership with Ritchie. He struggled on with his manufacturing business and eventually retired in 1886. Thereafter he devoted himself to his arts patronage.  Arts patronage  Simpson supported artistic talent and befriended painters such as William MacTaggart, George Paul Chalmers, W. Q. Orchardson, Sam Bough, James Cassie and Alexander Fraser.Dundee Year Book, 1892, p.79. He was strict in what he expected from these artists. \\"No Simpson landscape was usually considered complete without the interpolation of a human or animal motif, from boys fishing to cattle grazing.\\"Helen Smailes. \\"Dundee‚Äôs Forgotten Maecenas? G. B. Simpson and the Patronage of Modern Scottish Art\\", p. 33. In 1867, Simpson was appointed convener of the committee which organised an art exhibition during the visit of the British Association to Dundee. Simpson was also an ardent collector of books and all kinds of objets d'art. He had a collection of rare books dating from the fifteenth to the 18th centuries and in October 1879 he displayed this collection in Dundee Museum for benefit of his fellow citizens. His collections of coins and medals were sold off in a sale lasting five days.Dundee Year Book, 1892, p. 79. A collection of Simpson's correspondence with George P. Chalmers and Edward Pinnington is to be found in the Royal Scottish Academy's George B. Simpson Collection.Cf.

The adjacent building on the left is the former Rank Hovis Premier Mill The Millennium Mills is a derelict turn of the 20th century flour mill in West Silvertown on the south side of the Royal Victoria Dock, between the Thames Barrier and the ExCeL London exhibition centre alongside the newly built Britannia village, in Newham, London, England. The Mills are currently undergoing a major renovation as part of a ¬£3.5billion redevelopment of Silvertown. Along with Millennium Mills, there remains a small section of the now destroyed Rank Hovis Premier Mill and a restored grade II listed grain silo, labelled the 'D‚Äô silo. Described by the Evening Standard in 2009 as a \\"decaying industrial anachronism standing defiant and alone in the surrounding subtopia\\", the Millennium Mills has become a well-loved icon of post-industrial Britain and has made its way into many aspects of popular culture, being used as a backdrop in films and television shows such as Ashes to Ashes, London's Burning and Derek Jarman's The Last of England. Millennium Mills is also a destination for Urban Explorers despite high security, dangers of structural weakness, ten-storey drops and asbestos, and there are many reports and internal photos of the site. History Rebuilt Millennium Mills, 1934 Main centrifugal dressing machine floor, Spiller's Millennium Mills, Royal Victoria Dock, London, 1934 During the early half of the 20th century, the Royal Victoria Dock became an essential part of industrial Britain and London's largest centre of flour milling. The rail and water transport links made it an ideal location for business as well as a centre for international trade and commerce. The Cooperative Wholesale Society (CWS) was the first of the large nationwide milling companies to establish a flour mill in the area, with the opening of the Silvertown confectionery in 1901. Joseph Rank Limited would soon follow with the establishment of the Premier Mill at the Royal Dock in 1904. Vernon & Sons were the last to set up in the area when they built Millennium Mills. These mills, operated by Britain's three largest milling companies, converted imported grain from overseas into flour for the London market and were the first in the Port of London designed to take imported grain direct from the ships. Millennium Mills was designed and built by millers William Vernon & Sons of West Float, Birkenhead in 1905 with construction overseen by W. A. Vernon, the principal's son. The mills were extensive, featuring two plants, equipped by Henry Simon Ltd, that had a capacity of 100 sacks per hour. W. A. Vernon described the mills in a single word as \\"palatial\\". Vernon and Sons named the mill after their most successful product, a flour variety which they called \\"Millennium Flour\\" after winning the \\"Miller Challenge Cup\\" at the 1899 International Bakers Exhibition. The flour had been selected from \\"the best wheats of the world\\" and was put through a carefully designed industrial process. The victory gained Vernon and Sons \\"world-wide fame\\" and dominance in the English flour market. Millennium Flour was aimed at the rising 20th- century masses, proving particularly popular in the mining districts, where it was known to make \\"beautiful white bread sandwiches\\". The erection of Millennium Mills at the Royal Victoria Dock meant that this new flour could be brought to the Southern England market. All of these mills were partially destroyed in 1917 by the Silvertown explosion at Brunner Mond's munitions factory on the North Woolwich Road that was manufacturing explosives for Britain's World War I military effort. The Brunner Mond works was about 100 yards east of where Millennium Mills stood, and the adjoining grain silos and flour warehouses were amongst the 17 acres of buildings that the Port of London Authority estimated were affected. In 1920, Vernon & Sons was taken over by Spillers Limited at which time the Millennium Mills was acquired. Spillers was an established flour milling business founded in 1829, which subsequently went into the production of dog food and animal feeds by 1927. The Spillers name remains prominent on the east and west wings of the building. Millennium Mills was rebuilt as a 10-storey concrete art deco building in 1933. Many port mills throughout the country sustained severe damage from bombing in the Second World War; almost 75 per cent of the national capacity was concentrated at the ports, which made them primary targets for air attacks. In London, Spillers' Millennium Mills as well as Rank's Premier Mills were substantially destroyed. Between 1945 and 1950 the ports underwent large-scale post-war reconstruction despite a deficit of raw materials and strict licensing. At this time Millennium Mills was rebuilt, including a windowless steel-framed infill on the west side, and was in operation by September 1953. Closure and early restoration attempts Millennium Mills frontage in 2009 The Royal Docks closed in 1981, and many businesses relocated to Tilbury. The London Docklands Development Corporation (LDDC) was in discussion in the 1990s with the Zoological Society of London for a public aquarium on the site of the former CWS mill, but funding for it was difficult to find and the idea was eventually shelved. The Rank and CWS mills were demolished by the LDDC in the 1990s, along with the Millennium Mills' B and C silos. The D silo to the south is Grade II listed. Millennium Mills itself is locally listed by Newham Council. In 2001 a project was proposed for the redevelopment of the former docklands area with a planning request being submitted to the Local Authority in 2003. By 2007, a ¬£1.5 billion building scheme had been approved to convert the site into a mixed use development with residential, commercial, leisure and public areas. It was estimated that the scheme would be one of the largest urban regeneration projects in Europe, creating 2,000 jobs. The scheme was set to deliver 4,900 waterfront homes, with the intention of converting the Mills themselves into 400 luxury loft-style flats called Silvertown Quays. The development was also to include a new aquarium for London called Biota!, designed by Terry Farrell and Partners. The building scheme was supported by a partnership between the landowner, the London Development Agency (LDA), joint developers Silvertown Quays Limited (SQL) and the Japanese developer Kajima Urban Development International with financial backing by the Bank of Scotland. The first phase of the redevelopment was to see the Millennium Mills building developed into flats, with the demolition of the eastern and western wings, including the remains of the Rank Premier mill, leaving the main block of Millennium Mills, plus the south-western extension as a standalone tower. Planning approval was granted in 2007. However, no date was decided for work to commence. In 2009, the LDA, having seen no progress on the project, served termination notices to the SQL, setting a deadline of the 13 February 2010 for the company to secure sufficient funds for the project. When the termination notice expired and the funds were unable to be raised the LDA ended their agreements with the SQL and the Silvertown Quays development was officially cancelled. Despite discussion with SQL's main backer, the Bank of Scotland, and a new plan and revised timetable for the regeneration of the site, the London Development Agency concluded that it could not accept the new proposals. Architects Journal suggested that the area could be incorporated into a larger masterplan for the docks as part of a wider Royal Docks masterplan housing up to 30,000 people. Around 2011, the building remained derelict and was a destination for Urban Explorers who entered the site at high risk. There are many reports and internal photos of the site in this state. The Millennium Mills and Silo D site area was redeveloped as the London Pleasure Gardens and opened in 2012 to coincide with the London Olympics. Due to remain open for 3 years hosting music and arts events, the site encountered difficulties from its initial opening with negative reviews labelling the site as unfinished and unsafe with some of the advertised buildings absent and the area mostly devoid of greenery. Later events such as the Bloc Festival suffered from overcrowding and the planned number of visitors coming from the ExCeL London exhibition centre during the London 2012 Olympics never materialised. The site subsequently went into administration after only 5 weeks costing Newham council ¬£4 million. Redevelopment On 21 April 2015, Newham Council gave planning permission to The Silvertown Partnership for a new ¬£3.5billion redevelopment of the area, including Millennium Mills. The building will become a centre for start-up businesses. Part of Pontoon Dock itself will be filled in so that the land can be developed. Work began in January 2015 to clear the building of asbestos, following an initial ¬£12million grant from the government. To mark the grant, communities minister Penny Mordaunt MP and the deputy mayor of London for housing, Richard Blakeway, paid a visit to the 62 acre site. Speaking on the site, Penny Mordaunt MP said \\"There will be a lot of people working here who will be able to live in the area. This iconic building will be the centrepiece of a thriving new business district that will create thousands of new jobs and bring prosperity back to the docks.\\" The Mayor of London Boris Johnson said of the renovation: \\"The restoration of this great industrial monolith is another vital ingredient in the regeneration of London's historic Royal Docks. We want to return this site to its former glory, supporting business and enterprise and breathing new life into an area of the capital that has been dormant for decades.\\" In September 2015, the mills were open to the public as part of the Open House London weekend in which visitors were able to tour the sixth floor of the East wing, tenth floor of the main building, the East roof top and the Rank Hovis mill. As of September 2015, the Millennium Mills have been cleared of internal machinery and grain chutes which posed an asbestos risk, though the removed artefacts are planned to be donated to artists to use. Popular culture The location has featured in various media. In 1985, the former CWS mill nearby was used in the Terry Gilliam's dystopian film Brazil. The interior featured as the 'Department of Records', a vast clerks pool where the character Sam Lowry worked, and the deserted corridors of the 'Expediting Department'; the grim passageways and stairwells, as well as the exterior, served as 'Shangri La Towers', the Buttle family's tower block. =Derek Jarman's The Last of England= In 1987, British film-maker Derek Jarman released his self-shot avant-garde film The Last of England, which featured Millennium Mills as a key location. There was only one week of formal shooting for the film which occurred in November at the Royal Docks, an area Jarman described as \\"miles of desolation with the odd post-modern office building.\\" In one scene it shows characters dancing on the roof of the empty Millennium Mills building. British writer and psychogeographer, Iain Sinclair talks about the use of Millennium mills in Derek Jarman's film, describing it as having \\"been christened by William Blake and delivered by Albert Speer\\"; the English Romantic poet and Adolf Hitler's chief architect. Sinclair goes on to call the mills \\"the perfect symbol for a cinematic endgame.\\" In another piece of writing, Sinclair analyses Jarman as a man who \\"saw the downriver reaches of Silvertown, with its abandoned flour mills, as a site for dervish dances and the rituals of a punk apocalypse.\\" Millennium Mills as a backdrop to the spectacular lighting and fireworks at the concert =Jean-Michel Jarre's Destination Docklands= Jean-Michel Jarre had the Millennium Mills painted white as a surface for projection of lighting effects for his 1988 show Destination Docklands. It formed one side of the backdrop, with the CWS mill in the centre and a screen supported by scaffolding on the other side. The concert coincided with the release of his album Revolutions which dealt with the theme of the industrial revolution and the transition to the information age, themes that resonated with the abandoned docklands; Jarre described the event as \\"a concert dealing with architecture\\". =Other media= Millennium Mills was a recurring filming location for the British TV series Ashes to Ashes (2008‚Äì2010). It appears as one of the first locations in the series in Episode 1. The show is set in the 1980s, and using the Mills sets the scene for the London landscape of the show before the construction of the Millennium Dome dominated the East London skyline. At the start of the 1980s the industrial East End had yet to start its transformation at the hands of the London Docklands Development Corporation, which was founded in 1981. The mills also served as the location of a rescue 'shout' in the third episode of the fifth series of London's Burning. The mills appear as the setting for the \\"Abandoned Mill\\" mission in Splinter Cell: Blacklist, although the game names them as \\"Lansdowne Mills\\". Millennium Mills was used as a location in the 2010 film Green Zone where the \\"desolate East London mill\\" provides the setting for Saddam Hussain's maze of tunnels and bunkers. Most recently the Millennium Mills featured in the urban thriller film Twenty8K.Neil Thompson Interview, ViewLondon.co.uk. Retrieved 19 March 2013. The mills also appear as the setting for a number of music videos, including \\"Ask\\" by The Smiths (1986) filmed by Derek Jarman on the north side of Royal Victoria Dock, \\"The Box\\" by Orbital (1996) featuring Tilda Swinton, \\"Fluorescent Adolescent\\" by the Arctic Monkeys (2007), \\"Take Back the City\\" by Snow Patrol (2008), \\"Build A Fire\\" by Lamb (2011), and \\"Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall\\" by Coldplay (2011). In 2013 the Millennium Mills was used to shoot scenes for the movie adaptation of The Man From U.N.C.L.E. It was also used for Danny Boyle's 2013 film \\"Trance\\". In 2016, the Millennium Mills was used for the shooting of a part of \\"YouTube Rewind: The Ultimate 2016 Challenge\\". The video by YouTube Spotlight was filmed in four different cities, so approximately a quarter of the video was filmed there. The Millennium Mills also appeared in the 2017 live-action animated comedy film Paddington 2. The mills also appear briefly in the 2018 Netflix television drama The Innocents. In 2018, the Millennium Mills was used to shoot scenes for the TV series Informer (TV series) References External links * Silvertown Official Development website * Project Silvertown: A film by Ravensbourne students *Millennium Mills photo essay at urbexforums.co.uk, Urban Exploration Forums.

Overholt (born 1942) is a health economist who has assisted many development agencies with gender issues, health economics, case writing and case method training. She is part of the team that developed the Gender Analysis Framework (1984) in cooperation with the Harvard Institute for International Development and the USAID Office of Women in Development. Career Overholt studied at the Harvard University School of Public Health, where she obtained a doctorate in Health Economics. She became a Lecturer at Harvard's School of Public Health. She has taught workshops on discussion teaching and has directed case development projects. Overholt has undertaken fieldwork in Africa and Latin America. For example, in 1981 Overholt and Richard Goldman published a study of the nutritional impact of a project to increase the productivity of small farmers by introducing a high-yielding maize. The study found that the increase in income had very little effect on increasing calorie intake and made no measurable difference to nourishment of preschool children. The same year she participated in a study of subsidized milk in Mexico. Between 1980 and 1985 Overholt was involved in development of the Harvard Analytical Framework, used to determine how to efficiently allocate resources between men and women in aid projects. Mary B Anderson and Overholt formed Collaborative for Development Action (CDA) as a small consulting company in 1985, working in the areas of health policy, primary and secondary education, rural development, alternative technologies and evaluations. Overholt was Vice President of the company. In 1986 as a consultant for the USAID Technologies for Primary Health Care (Pritech) project she undertook an evaluation of aid projects in Haiti with Polly Harrison and Maggie Huff. CDA, primarily government-funded, developed the People Oriented Planning Framework for refugee programs and was also involved in work that led to the Do No Harm, Reflecting on Peace Practice, and Corporate Engagement projects. In 1991 Overholt was co-author with James Austin and Ann Sweet of an essay called To See Ourselves as Others See Us: The Rewards of Classroom Observation. This explores the value to a teacher of taking the difficult step of bringing a colleague into the classroom to observe and provide feedback, and has been widely quoted. Overholt retired from CDA to run a small farm that supports reforestation in rural Mexico. Gender Analysis Frameworks Overholt is co-author of Gender Roles in Development Projects: A Case Book (1985) with Mary Anderson, Kathleen Cloud and James E. Austin. This book documents the Harvard Development Framework, or Gender Analysis Framework, a groundbreaking approach to allocating development aid based on gender analysis. Development of the framework began in 1980 when the World Bank Women in Development (WID) Adviser requested help from Harvard to provide training to World Bank staff. James Austin, a case-method trainer at Harvard, headed the team, and brought in Catherine Overholt, Mary Anderson and Kathleen Cloud, all of whom had WID experience. They developed the four- part framework for analyzing the division of labour between men and women, and determining their access and control of resources. The neutral, fact-based approach with its emphasis on economic efficiency played a leading role in helping aid providers to understand the importance of allocating resources to women. Over a ten-year period CDA worked with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to develop an approach for programs to assist women refugees, the People Oriented Planning Framework (POP). Overholt, Mary Anderson and Anne Brazeau co-authored A Framework for People-Oriented Planning in Refugee Situations Taking Account of Women, Man and Children: A Practical Planning Tool for Refugee Workers, published by the UNHCR in 1992. The POP is adapted from the Harvard Framework with modifications to deal with refugee situations, and attempts to overcome some of the weaknesses in the earlier framework.

LEAD develops, markets and supports a line of imaging toolkits called LEADTOOLS.  History  The company was founded by Mohammed Daher and Rich Little in the summer of 1990 as a partnership called Compression Technology and was later incorporated as LEAD Technologies, Inc. in April 1991. LEAD gained a worldwide presence in 1993 by signing its first international reseller agreement with Unirent LTD to represent LEAD in Germany, Switzerland and Austria. Two years later, it signed a publishing agreement with Bunka Orient Corporation in Sendai, Japan for the rights to localize LEADTOOLS in Japanese, and to market and support the product in Japan.  Products  LEAD was established to commercialize Daher's inventions in the field of digital imaging and compression technology. The primary product, LEADTOOLS, is a family of raster, document, medical, multimedia and vector imaging toolkits that allow programmers and developers to incorporate digital imaging technologies into applications that they are creating. In addition to selling LEADTOOLS directly to software developers, LEAD Technologies, its divisions and subsidiaries use the SDK within several end user products including ePrint, MiPACS, M¬≤Convert and FileWiggler. LeadTools eases the development of Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) which is the universal format of picture archiving and communication system (PACS). = Technology included in LEADTOOLS SDK = *DICOM and PACS. *Transforms, filters, and color conversion. *Optical Character Recognition, including document image cleanup. *3D reconstruction and 2D visualization of medical images. *Handwritten text recognition. *Medical Web Viewer Framework SDK for 2D and 3D visualizations. *Image processing functions. *Image scanning, import, display, and other basic image processing. *Interactive Annotation Objects. *Multimedia Engine.  Subsidiaries  In 2006, LEAD created M¬≤ Solutions, Inc. as a wholly owned subsidiary. M¬≤ develops, markets and supports a product line called M¬≤ Convert, which helps end users convert from one multimedia format to another. M¬≤ has primarily focused on the mobile and handheld market for people using Apple iPods and iPads, and Microsoft Windows phones.  Divisions  In 2001, LEAD created a division called Medicor Imaging. Medicor develops, markets and supports a product line called MiPACS. Medicor‚Äôs primary product, MiPACS Dental Enterprise Solution is an application for large digital dental providers such as Universities, the United States Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs. When selected for use by the VA, the primary reason was that it was the only solution able to automatically acquire images from any device, view images with templates, and save images electronically to VistA imaging.  Patents  In July 1994, Daher was awarded patent #5327254, Method and Apparatus for Compressing and Decompressing Image Data. This invention became the foundation of LEAD's product line and business ventures. In early 2017, LEAD was awarded Patent #9552527. This patent describes a robust method for detecting the orientation angle of text in an image automatically without using OCR. It determines for each individual text area within an image whether it is written horizontally, vertically, or upright. This method enhances OCR accuracy, especially for Asian text which is often written vertically or a combination of vertical and horizontal text bodies. Detecting the correct angle of the text before doing OCR, improves the speed and performance of the OCR process. In mid-2019, LEAD was awarded Patent #10318563, Apparatus, Method, and Computer-Readable Medium for Recognition of a Digital Document. This patent is about using advanced computer vision to identify elements within images. Then, artificial intelligence uses the elements found to accurately determine a type of form (i.e. W-2, W-4, 1090, etc). With this patented algorithm, filled-out form images can be distorted and vary in size and resolution without affecting performance. After recognition, AI techniques are employed to provide the precise location of each field of data. Having a precise location greatly improves the accuracy of OCR when processing the forms to extract data.

The territory raised a small number of volunteers for the Union Army, who did not fight against the Confederate States Army but instead maintained defensive positions against possible foreign naval or land attacks. Although the Indian Wars in Washington were recent, there were no Indian hostilities within the area of modern Washington, unlike the rest of the western states and territories, during the Civil War. At the start of the American Civil War, modern-day Washington was part of the Washington Territory. On March 3, 1863, the Idaho Territory was formed from that territory, consisting of the entirety of modern-day Idaho, Montana, and all but southwest Wyoming, leaving the modern- day Washington as Washington Territory. Washington Territory before the Civil War Washington Territory before the Civil War was the most remote place in the United States from the theater of conflict. Additionally Washington Territory only had peace with the local Indians for three years when the Civil War began and the few settlers there were just recovering from the fear and economic strain those wars had caused them. Also of great concern locally was the recent Pig War and continuing territorial dispute over San Juan Island that affected relations with Great Britain during the American Civil War. Politically the territory was also a stronghold for the Democratic Party with many sympathetic to the Southern cause or at least tolerant of it.CLINTON A. SNOWDEN, History of Washington: The Rise and Progress of an American State, olume Four: THE CENTURY HISTORY COMPANY, NEW YORK, 1909. Washington Territory in the Civil War =Washington Territory Volunteer Infantry= With the regular U.S. Army troops recalled from the District of Oregon to fight the Civil War in the east, soldiers were still needed to man the forts and outposts in Washington Territory. The acting governor of the territory, Henry M. McGill, issued a proclamation on May 10, 1861, in response to President Lincoln's first call for volunteers, but it met with little reply. Not until October 12, was an effective step taken to raise volunteers in the territory when Colonel Thomas A. Scott, assistant secretary of war, wrote to Justus Steinberger, notifying him that he was authorized to organize a regiment of infantry, \\"in that territory, and the country adjacent thereto,\\" and he was appointed colonel of said regiment. When Colonel Steinberger arrived on the coast, he came to Puget Sound in January 1862, and after he consulted with the legislature, and visited towns and settlements west of the mountains, he realized he could not hope to raise more than three companies, at most, in the territory. Leaving R. V. Peabody to raise a company in the Sound country, and two other officers to raise two companies east of the mountains, Colonel Steinberger returned to San Francisco. There he opened a recruiting office on March 1, 1862, and two months later had secured four companies (A, B, C and D), and had two more started, soon to be at full strength. Early in May, with the four companies then completed and mustered, he left San Francisco for Fort Vancouver, soon followed by the two other companies from California. Later two more were raised in California, making eight in all from California, in the regiment which was not withstanding known as the 1st Washington Territory Infantry Regiment. In the end only two companies of the Regiment were raised in Washington Territory, and one of these (Company F) was recruited largely from residents of Oregon. Company K, which was mustered in at Fort Steilacoom was the only Company raised only from men from Washington Territory.Clinton A. Snowden, History of Washington: The Rise and Progress of an American State, Volume Four: THE CENTURY HISTORY COMPANY, NEW YORK, 1909. pp 105-107 East of the Cascades troops could not be raised from the men involved in the frenzy of the Idaho gold rush then beginning. The Volunteer soldiers who served in Washington did not fight against the Confederacy, but instead garrisoned the few posts in Washington that were not abandoned at the beginning of the war. They also protected communications routes between the western and eastern United States in Oregon and Idaho from the Indians and against the threat of foreign intervention on the Pacific coast by Britain and France that never materialized. Three companies in the newly formed Idaho Territory were engaged in an expedition to clear the area of the Snake Indians who threatened settlers to the territory in 1863 and 1864. Washington Territorial Units in the Civil War * 1st Regiment Washington Territory Volunteer Infantry **Company F **Company H ** Company K  Threat of foreign invasion and privateers  = Naval defenses = To protect the northern approaches to the mouth of the Columbia River from possible attacks by Confederate commerce raider or the fleets of the British Empire or French Empire in 1862, a camp called Post at Cape Disappointment was established where fortifications were built and artillery emplaced to cover the river. It was first garrisoned by Company A, U.S. 9th Infantry Regiment and later by Company A, 8th Regiment California Volunteer Infantry. In 1863, a mate to Cape Disappointment, Fort at Point Adams, later Fort Stevens was established in Oregon on the south bank of the Columbia River. In 1864, Post at Cape Disappointment was renamed Fort Cape Disappointment. Despite the fears of the Union, these forts saw no action against any enemy in the Civil War. = Britain's proposal to seize the Washington Territory = On December 28, 1861, during the ongoing Trent Affair, Governor of the Colony of British Columbia James Douglas wrote to Secretary of State for the Colonies Henry Pelham-Clinton, 5th Duke of Newcastle, arguing that Britain should seize the Washington Territory while the U.S. was preoccupied with the Civil War. He reasoned because there were little to no U.S. troops stationed in the region since most other units stationed there were off to war in the East, the territory's population was scattered, and there were a few U.S. naval ships in the area. He also said the Royal Navy and Marines were powerful and could easily do the job, ending with a statement that \\"with Puget Sound, and the line of the Columbia River in our hands, we should hold the only navigable outlets of the country‚Äîcommand its trade, and soon compel it to submit to Her Majesty‚Äôs Rule.\\"Despatch to London: Douglas, Sir James to Pelham-Clinton, 5th Duke of Newcastle Henry Pelham Fiennes, 28 December 1861 British officials instead chose to pass on his proposal as so not to risk war with the United States. = Threat of privateers from Victoria, British Columbia = On March 15, 1863, a schooner, called , had been seized in the harbor of San Francisco, just as she was preparing to put to sea as a Confederate privateer. This seizure made Union men everywhere along the coast more alert for other attempts to get a vessel for the purpose. Among its papers was one letter disclosing plans for the capture of USS Shubrick but the scheme appeared to have been abandoned. However early in 1863, Allen Francis, United States consul at Victoria, British Columbia, received information that led him to believe a plot was forming, to seize Shubrick, and convert her into a Confederate privateer. In the ensuing Shubrick Incident, Shubricks Captain Pease and most of the crew, all suspected Southern sympathizers, were discharged by the Customs Collector for Puget Sound. This was accomplished on the next visit of Shubrick to Victoria, while the captain and a large part of the crew were on shore, Lieutenant Selden, second in command aboard Shubrick, threw off her mooring lines, and with only six men on board, he sailed away for Port Townsend.

When Francis discovered two British ships entering the port, one with a cargo of shot and shell and the other with iron construction, he feared they would be used by the Confederacy and alerted the Navy, which sent to patrol the waters near Victoria.

(2010). Ozo: A Story of an African Knighthood [Paperback]. Pub. Griot Press USA, Generally, in most Igbo communities, only holders of Ichi title may become candidates for Ozo title.Jeffreys, M.

Taking Ozo title is extremely expensive with the lower grades costing in excess of US$25,000 in initiation cost and up to another US$2000 in annual subscriptions. Although there is hegemony across Igboland on the notion of Ozo,Finds, M., and Onwuejeogwu, B. (1977), The Search for the Missing Links in Dating and Interpreting the Igbo‚ÄìUkwu, Paideuma, Bd. 23, pp. 169-188 categorisation and grades of Ozo titles are different across Igbo communities. For example, with the exception of the Onitsha and Delta Igbo, certain titles of the Ozo such as ‚ÄòEzeana‚Äô may not be taken until the candidate was seen to have been ‚Äòa man‚Äô.Achebe, C. (1957). Things Fall Apart, Pub. London Being that Igbo‚Äôs are gerontologic in outlook,Arth, M. (1968). Ideals and Behavior. A Comment on Ibo Respect Patterns, The Gerontologist, Vol. 8, No. 4, pp. 242-244 the basic pre-condition for such an assessment was to ascertain whether the father of a candidate was still alive. If a candidate‚Äôs father was still alive, the title could not be taken. This rule however does not apply to Onitsha Igbo‚Äôs who can take Ozo title while a candidates father is alive. In other Igbo communities, especially those in the Awka-Nri axis, some exceptions are made where the candidate completes the initiation rites into Ozo, but is referred to as ‚ÄòNze-agbala‚Äô until the father dies. Such a person may however not be allowed to dance to Ufie music which is a sacred music danced by Ozo holders on special Igbo religious festivals such as the New Yam Festival. Another major difference in taking of Ozo title in Igboland relates to the pre-requisite for the candidate to have earlier taken Ichi title ().Jeffreys, M. (1951). The Winged Solar Disk, or Ibo Ichi Scarification, Journal of the International African Institute, Vol. 21, No. 2, pp. 93-111. While taking Ozo title in most Igbo communities in the Awka-Nri axis requires the candidate to have taken Ichi title, in Onitsha, Ichi is not a recognised institution and is therefore not undertaken by the Onitsha Igbo and some of the Delta Igbo.Odukwe, M. (1985). The ozo title in Onitsha: A brief Historical Study, MA Thesis, University of Nigeria, Nsukka The Nze na Ozo society does not exist in most southern Igbo communities such as the Aro. Instead, these communities have masquerade societies such as Okonko Green, M. (1958). Sayings of the ·ªåk·ªç≈äk·ªç Society of the Igbo-Speaking People. Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, 21, pp 157-173Cookey, S.

(2010), The Age of Cultural Hybridisation: A Case Study of Okonko, Anthropologist, Vol. 12, No. 3, pp. 161-165 and Ekpe. In most parts of Igboland, there are generally two major classes of Ozo. The first is nnukwu Ozo (big Ozo). Within nnukwu Ozo, there are three grades consisting of Dunu, Dim and Ezeana. In the second class of Ozo referred to as obele Ozo (small Ozo), again there are generally three grades consisting of Eyisi, Ezuzo and Okpala.Ogbukagu, I.K. (1997). Traditional Igbo beliefs and Practices, Pub. Novelty, , p. 75. It must however be recognised that until about 1930, nnukwu Ozo had a fourth (and highest) grade of Ozo referred to as Igwe (Sky) which only the Eze Nri, the spiritual leader of the Ozo system held. This has however changed with most Igbo communities being led by a senior Ozo holder referred to as Igwe or Eze. The different grades of Ozo are not necessarily distinct based on nomenclature alone. For example, while Ozo Okpala is regarded as obele Ozo, the position is usually taken by the first son in a lineage who by taking the title becomes responsible for arbitrating internal family disputes.Odukwe, M.

The program is being developed and distributed by Intuition Software, Inc. in South Korea, and is used chiefly for structural and geotechnical analysis. The strongest point of the program is its intuitive and user-friendly usage based on graphical pre- and postprocessing capabilities. VisualFEA has educational functions for teaching and learning structural mechanics and finite element analysis through graphical simulation. Thus, this program is widely used in college courses related to structural mechanics and finite element method. Overview VisualFEA is a full-fledged finite element analysis program with many easy-to-use but powerful features, which can be classified largely into four parts: finite element processing, pre-processing, post-processing and educational simulation. All the functions are integrated into a single executable module, which is a characteristic of the program distinguished from other finite element analysis programs generally composed of multiple modules. The whole procedure from pre-processing to analysis, and to post-processing can be completed on the spot without launching one program after another, or without pipelining data from one program to another. Processing VisualFEA can solve the following types of problems. * Mechanical analysis :Truss, frame, plane stress, plane strain, axisymmetric, plate bending, shell and 3D solid :Linear, material nonlinear or geometric nonlinear analysis :Static or dynamic analysis :Construction staged analysis :Geotechnical analysis (consolidation, slope stability analysis) * Heat conduction analysis :Plane, axisymmetric and 3D volume :Steady state or transient analysis :Linear or nonlinear material model :Fire damage analysis * Seepage analysis :Plane, axisymmetric and 3D volume :Steady state or transient analysis :Confined or unconfined boundary condition * Coupled analysis :Heat conduction coupled mechanical analysis :Seepage coupled mechanical analysis Pre-processing A finite element model in VisualFEA consists of various objects: curve, primitive surface, node, element and mesh. VisualFEA has its own CAD-like capabilities of creating graphical objects without aid of external programs. VisualFEA can create structured or unstructured meshes in two- or three-dimensional space using the following mesh generation schemes. * Mapping scheme (lofting, tri-mapping, transfinite mapping, isoparametric mapping) * Sweeping scheme (extrusion, translation, rotation, twisting) * Auto mesh scheme (triangulation, tetrahedronization) * Mesh treatment (mesh carving, mesh operation, intersection, distortion) The program has the function to save the generated mesh data in text format for use by other application programs. Other pre-processing capabilities include the following items. * Definition and assignment of boundary conditions, material properties and element joints, etc. * Node number or element number optimization * Handling of element orientation, local coordinate axes Post-processing VisualFEA has various functions of visualizing the numerical data generated by solving the analysis models. The most frequently used graphical representation of the data are the contour and vector images. There are many other forms of graphical representation available in VisualFEA.J.Y.Lee and S-Y.Ahn, Interactive visualization of elasto-plastic behavior through stress paths and yield surfaces in finite element analysis, Finite Elements in Analysis and Design, 47(2011), pp496-510 * Iso-surface * Sliced plane, parallel plane, cross plane * Diagram (bending moment diagram, shear force diagram, etc.) * Curve plotting * Data probing * Animation Educational Simulation VisualFEA can be used as a tool for computer-aided education of structural mechanics and finite element method. The tools are operated with the user-created modeling data and their ensuing analysis results on the basis of finite element technology. They are devised to promote the understanding, and to stimulate the interest in the subjects by substantiating the conceptual principles and visually exhibiting the complex computational processes with the aid of interactive computer graphics. The topics covered by the educational functions are as follows. * Mathematical relationships of internal forces in rigid frames.J.Y.Lee and S-Y.Ahn, Finite element implementation for computer-aided education of structural mechanics:Frame analysis, Computer Applications in Engineering Education, 22(2014), pp387-409 * Geometric properties of an arbitrarily defined member section * Stresses on the member sections * Moving load * Mohr circle and its application to elasto-plastic yielding.J.Y.Lee, H.R.Ryu and Y.T.Park, Finite element implementation for computer-aided education of structural mechanics:Mohr's circle and its application, Computer Applications in Engineering Education, 22(2014), pp494-508 * Stress path and yield surface * Buckling * Stiffness assembly and solution process in the finite element analysis.J.Y.Lee, Interactive simulation of finite element equation processing for educational purposes, Computer Applications in Engineering Education, 23 (2015) pp157-169, DOI 10.1002/cae.21586 * Shape function and interpolation * Eigen value analysis.J.Y.Lee, H.R.Ryu, Interactive simulation of eigenmodes for instruction of finite element behavior, Computer Applications in Engineering Education, 23 (2015) pp872-886, DOI 10.1002/cae.21659 * Concept of adaptive analysis VisualFEA/CBT VisualFEA/CBT is an educational version of the programR.D.Cook and Intuition Software, VisualFEA and General User Manual, John Wiley and Son's Inc, 2001 published by John Wiley and Son's Inc. as a companion program to a textbookR.D.Cook, D.S.Malkus, M.E.Plesha, R.J.Witt, Concepts and Applications of Finite Element Analysis, 4th ed., John Wiley and Son's Inc, 2001 on finite element method.

The episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 10, 2011. The episode was written by Loren Bouchard and directed by Boohwan Lim. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed by 4.00 million viewers in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Kevin Kline, David Herman, Jay Johnston, Andy Kindler, Larry Murphy, Laura Silverman and Sarah Silverman. Plot Bob and the family are waiting at the restaurant for their eccentric landlord Mr. Fischoeder, to see if he will renew the business lease. When Fischoeder arrives he warns Bob that his business rival, Jimmy Pesto, wants to build a gift shop on the current site of Bob's restaurant. Bob is told that his lease will not be renewed unless the rent is paid within the next few days. As they are always late with payment, Bob and Linda are unsure of how they will make the deadline. Bob complains that Tina is in love with Jimmy Jr. and both Gene and Louise are friends with the twins, Andy and Ollie Pesto. These relationships are at odds with Bob's own feud with Pesto. When the kids arrive home from school, Jimmy Sr. puts a banner on his restaurant saying his restaurant is now also serving burgers. Bob and Linda head over to Pesto's to complain. Meanwhile, the kids sneak into Jimmy Pesto's and reveal that Bob's regular customers Mort and Teddy eat at Jimmy's restaurant as well. As Jimmy continues trying to get Bob's Burgers to close, the Belchers devise methods of obtaining the rent money, with Bob and Linda taking suggestions from the kids. Gene suggests live music, Tina suggests slow dancing and Louise suggests voodoo. Linda suggests putting out flyers stating that the food will be half- price. Later that night, Jimmy tastes his own burger, criticizes it, and takes it off the menu. On the day the rent is due, Louise plans to get Jimmy's hair to control his mind (through voodoo). Tina wants Louise to help her dance Jimmy Jr. back into remembering that they are dating, and Gene wants her to get him a music gig. Louise accepts the idea, but states she needs a lock of their hair (even Gene has to cut off his rat's tail). Louise makes a voodoo doll out of a potato with Tina's hair on it and asks Andy and Ollie to get their brother's hair for Tina, which they do. Louise comes back home with the twins who need to work on the voodoo dolls made out of potatoes, so Bob gets Gene and Tina to hand out the \\"half-price\\" flyers to the public. Gene and Tina return home and mention that they gave a flyer to Jimmy Pesto, who subsequently decides to sell his own food that night at half-price to customers with a Bob's Burgers flyer. This leaves Bob with no customers; even Mort's mother decides to go to Jimmy Pesto's instead of Bob's (where Mort was going to take her). As a last resort, Bob's attempts to construct the difficult-to-make burger called the Meatsiah in bite-sized pieces. Bob gets Gene to sample them at Jimmy Pesto's restaurant, as a ploy to get customers to return to Bob's Burgers to have more. Louise completes her voodoo potatoes in the basement but needs to get Jimmy Pesto's hair. Lying that the hair she wants is a donation for mustache cancer, she finds out that his restaurant's piano player is sick. Louise decides to tell Gene that he can perform a gig there. Gene arrives for his gig and Louise plays the drums with him. As Gene's wish comes true, Tina slow dances with Jimmy Jr. Linda discovers that Gene is playing his first gig so she goes there to watch. Bob finishes making his burger only to realize that his family went to Jimmy Pesto's. Bob goes over, wearing Gene's burger suit with the burgers as samples. Bob gives the customers burgers and ends up having a fight with Jimmy outside the building. Mr. Fischoeder arrives after Bob and Jimmy have stopped fighting, and he lets them and the others go to Bob's Burgers to get the rent. Bob claims that he does not have the rent money, so Mr. Fischoeder announces the restaurant lease will not be renewed. However, as he is doing so, he smells the Meatsiah burgers and tastes them. Mr. Fischoeder realizes that Bob does not care about high-volume business, but rather, cares about the quality of his food, so he lets the restaurant lease be extended under some circumstances. The episode ends with Gene playing music, and Tina slow dancing with Jimmy Jr., Then Louise realizes that the voodoo has worked, as Gene finally got to play to a live audience, Tina was finally able to dance with Jimmy Pesto's son, then Louise believed to be God. Andy and Ollie get out of the basement and dance along with the other dancing customers as Jimmy Sr. angrily walks back to his restaurant. Reception In its original American broadcasting, \\"Burger War\\" was viewed by an estimated 4.00 million viewers and received a 1.9 rating/5% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, a drop from the previous episode; and became the lowest rated episode of the season despite being the second lowest rated episode of that night, beating American Dad that night. Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+, saying \\"The minor serialization‚Äîworld-building might be a better phrase for it‚Äîof the show comes into play here.

Origins As the first surfboards were extremely large, heavy, and unwieldy by today's standards, the soul arch may have been one of the earliest tricks available to riders to demonstrate their style. The 18th century Hawaiian 'wave sliders' seen by Captain Cook's crew performing \\"dangerous maneuvers\\" with great \\"boldness and address\\" would have ridden hardwood planks with no directional fin or skeg to aid steering.  Development  As longboard design progressed, lighter balsa wood and glass fiber boards with skegs allowed greater freedom of movement, while allowing better riders to adopt more exaggerated stances. Arms raised in the air, with the hands clasped behind the head, signified control and balance; this became a common position. Combined with the difficult Hang Five and Hang Ten moves, when a rider positions at the front (or nose) of a board, a soul arch becomes a significantly more difficult trick, requiring a considerable level of skill and balance.

The yacht was first used by President Carlos P. Garcia. Specifications  The BRP Ang Pangulo was built by the Japanese yacht-building company Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries. With a high speed of 18 knots and At 77 m 254 (ft) in length, it has a capacity of up to 44 passengers and 81 crew members. History = Garcia administration = RPS Lapu-Lapu (PY-77) was built in Japan as part of that country's war reparations to the Philippines. At the initiative of President Carlos P. Garcia, Filipino naval engineers specifically designed the vessel for use as a presidential yacht. It was christened with its original name of RPS Lapu-Lapu, named after the Visayan datu, Lapu-Lapu, and commissioned into the Philippine Navy on March 7, 1959 as its flagship, a status it held until December 1961. = Macapagal administration = President Diosdado Macapagal in the following year ordered its conversion to a naval troop transport, renaming it RPS Roxas after the fifth President of the Philippines, Manuel Roxas, in rites led by his widow, Trinidad Roxas. President Diosdado Macapagal himself used another, older, presidential yacht, the RPS Santa Maria, which he renamed RPS Pag-Asa, the name by which it had also been called a decade earlier under President Ramon Magsaysay. This ship was later decommissioned by the Navy in 1993. = Marcos administration = Later the vessel was renamed RPS The President and then BRP Ang Pangulo by President Ferdinand E. Marcos, who restored its use as the presidential yacht, a status it has retained in all succeeding presidencies to the present day. After 1986 it became associated with the lavish activities of the Marcos family when the video archives of Malaca√±ang Palace were revealed to the public.https://www.latimes.com/archives/la- xpm-1986-03-11-mn-3131-story.html Among the videos released was Irene Marcos' lavish September 1985 party aboard the Ang Pangulo, which was controversial in light of the sorry state of the Philippine economy at the time, and because diplomats such as U.S. Ambassador Stephen W. Bosworth were shown participating in an event which put the profligacy of the Marcos administration on display.https://newslab.philstar.com/31-years-of-amnesia/first-family = Arroyo administration = It is in honor of these earlier periods under Presidents Magsaysay and Macapagal, and to emphasize its service to the people throughout the archipelago, that the BRP Ang Pangulo has been renamed BRP Pag- Asa by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. As it has throughout the Arroyo administration and over its 50-year life, the vessel, operated by Naval Taskforce ‚ÄúSealion‚Äù, continues at the President's instruction to carry out relief and medical missions all over the islands, aid in emergency search and rescue efforts, perform naval functions, promote tourism, culture and local products, as well as serve the presidency and the government. = Duterte administration = On May 15, 2016, presumptive president-elect Rodrigo Duterte announced his plans to sell the ship. Duterte said that the proceeds would go to war veterans, improvement of hospital facilities, and salaries for doctors \\"so they would not have to leave the country for higher-paying jobs.\\" However, after being told of the process for disposing of government and military assets by Armed Forces of the Philippines spokesperson Restituto Padilla, Duterte said that he instead plans to convert the ship into a hospital ship in the event of a conflict. The yacht was used as a 28-bed capacity isolation facility for military frontline workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Garcia.http://nine.cnnphilippines.com/news/2016/05/16/colorful-history- presidential-yacht-brp-ang-pangulo.html First called Bow No. 77, it was designed as the Presidential Yacht by Filipino naval engineers and built at the Ishikawajima Dry-Docks in Tokyo. Its keel was laid at the Harume Yard on July 16, 1958 and the vessel was launched on October 16 of that year. Sea trials were conducted under Lieutenant Commander Manuel Mandapat PN, its first commanding officer, on February 9 and 10, 1959. It was designated as the flagship of the Philippine Navy by President Garcia through an Executive Order on February 13, 1959, and delivered to the Philippine Government on February 28. It was christened RPS Lapu-Lapu (PY-77) and commissioned into the Philippine Navy on March 7. On April 2, the vessel arrived in Manila. The first presidential engagement held aboard took place on April 7, 1959, and the ship's first mission, a trade and cultural floating exposition with ports of call in Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, was carried out from April 19 to June 4, 1959. The vessel has since been extensively used for relief, emergency search and rescue, patrol, auxiliary transport and command vessel purposes in addition to performing its duties to the presidency and the government. Many distinguished persons, including General Douglas MacArthur on his sentimental journey in 1961, and numerous heads of state and government, have been aboard as official guests. Flagship status was revoked by President Diosdado Macapagal on December 31, 1961, and the vessel was renamed RPS Roxas (TP-71) on October 9, 1962, the first instance of a naval ship being named in honor of a Philippine president. It was renamed RPS The President (TP-777) by President Ferdinand E. Marcos on January 11, 1967 and renamed anew as BRP Ang Pangulo (TP-777) on July 1, 1971. Its hull number was altered to AT-25 by President Corazon C. Aquino on September 24, 1986. From 1998 to 2000, extensive refurbishment took place under President Joseph Ejercito Estrada. On March 6, 2009, the eve of its 50th commissioning anniversary, the ship was renamed BRP Pag-Asa (AT-25) by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo in fitting ceremonies celebrating an outstanding legacy of service to the Republic. On December 14, 2011, during ceremonies coinciding commission 2 newly acquired navy ships and a helicopter, the ship was renamed again as BRP Ang Pangulo (AT-25) \\"to continue the heritage and carry the honor and prestige of the Philippine presidency.‚Äù Previous presidential yachts =The Apo= It was a steam yacht built in Kinghorn, Scotland, in 1898. It was initially called the Cem but was later on renamed to The Amelia III after it was acquired by King Carlos of Portugal. In 1906, it was purchased by Henry Clay Pierce, and the name was changed to the Yacona. It was acquired by the United States Navy and commissioned in 1917. After it was decommissioned at Engineer Island, Manila, in 1921, it was transferred to the Philippine Insular Government and renamed Apo. In 1932, it was returned to the United States Federal Government. =The Cassiana/Banahaw= The Cassandra, an oil-burning yacht, was built in 1908. It was acquired by oil tycoon Edward L. Doheny and renamed the Casiana, after his first major oil well in Mexico. In 1936, the Commonwealth government acquired it for $50,000, and the ship arrived in Manila on November 25 of the same year. The name was changed to Banahaw, and it was made part of the Coast Guard service, although, primarily, it was reserved for use of the President and his family. On December 29, 1941, it sank off Fort Mills wharf, Corregidor, by Japanese bombing. =The Orchid= It was a 190-foot Manzanita Class vessel built in New Jersey. Its keel was laid in October 1907; it was launched in May 1908, and was commissioned in August 1908 to the United States Lighthouse Service, which was merged with the Coast Guard in 1939. It was called the Orchid in line with the Lighthouse Service's tradition of using flora as names for certain vessels (tenders, in particular), which was continued by the Coast Guard. With its sister ships, the Anemone, Sequoia, and the Tulip, the Orchid was transferred to the Philippines when it was decommissioned in December 1945. It was used by President Manuel Roxas. =The Apo II= It was an Admirable-class minesweeper laid down on November 24, 1943 by the Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation in Alabama. On March 16, 1944, it was launched, and on October 25, 1944, was commissioned as the USS Quest (AM-281). She received two battle stars during World War II. It was decommissioned on May 2, 1946 and struck from the Navy register on September 29, 1947. It was renamed Dalisay when it was transferred to the Republic of the Philippines on July 2, 1948. It was then renamed Pagasa, by President Ramon Magsaysay, and again to Santa Maria by President Carlos P. Garcia, after his hometown. In 1959, it was replaced by the new presidential yacht, the Lapu-Lapu, but continued to serve as the alternate yacht. With the designation TK-21, it was renamed three times by President Diosdado Macapagal as the Corregidor (1963), Pagasa (1964), and Incorruptible (1965). However, the name was reverted to Pag-Asa (1966) and finally changed to Mount Samat by President Ferdinand E. Marcos in 1967.

It is provided as an alternative to military service for conscientious objectors by Article 127 of the Finnish constitution. The service lasts for 347 days, changed from 395 days in 2008 (not retroactively applied). It can be entered into by filing paperwork indicating that one conscientiously objects to military service. History This alternative service option has existed since 1931 thanks to the efforts of conscientious objector Arndt Pekurinen, although non-religious objections were not allowed until a change of law in 1959. Until 1987, non-religious objections were examined by a Special Commission of Inquiry which was composed of a judge, a military officer, a representative of the social ministry, and a psychiatrist. Today, simply filing the correct paperwork suffices, and as such, many people opt for it simply as an alternative to military service while not having any special objections. An emergency state (in case of war, for example) still allows the usage of Special Commissions of Inquiry.  Completing service  = Applying = Alternative service can be entered into using a form. This form is submitted before service or during military service. If it is submitted during military service, the person must be released from doing military service at once. A community service location for the remaining 11 months should be chosen before entering alternative service for maximum choice. If a suitable location is not found, one will be assigned by the educational centre. = Starting service = Lapinj√§rvi Educational Center Siviilipalvelus begins with a one-month training period at the Siviilipalveluskeskus (Lapinj√§rvi Educational Center) in Lapinj√§rvi and continues with approximately 11 months of work duties at an approved non- profit organization or ministry or other government entity. A person cannot perform this service for a political party or trade union or a location from which they are earning income. = Benefits = Siviilipalveluskeskus provides for housing and food during the training-period. Housing arrangements are paid or arranged for during work duties by either KELA or the entity where the person is performing their service. The entity is responsible for paying a food allowance (or providing meals on-site) and daily allowance money to the person performing their service. 18 personal vacation days are provided by law, in addition to 20 days performance vacation days (kuntoisuusloma) may be provided at the entity's discretion. Generally three performance vacation days are given during the training period if an entity where service can be performed has been located beforehand. If needed, 12 days of paternity leave can be provided. = Interruption = A person may request up to 180 days of personal leave (HSL-loma), but this is not counted into the service period. This is generally granted on a case per case basis. A person may also be either freed or deferred for three years on medical grounds (C or E class). = Discipline = If a person completing alternative service does not perform their work duties, the following consequences may occur: #Written warning #Extension of work duties (at most 4 hours during 5 days) #Loss of daily allowance money (at most twice, for 30 days maximum) #Loss of personal holidays (at most 4 days per time) A repeated offense will result in a prison sentence equal in length to half of the remaining service time. This, however, is not marked on a person's criminal record. = Service and for-profit work = A person undergoing siviilipalvelus is fully permitted to be employed in a company while doing service, but he/she may not engage in both siviilipalvelus and for-profit work at the same company/entity. For-profit work is restricted to free time from siviilipalvelus. Finnish law forbids companies from firing employees merely because they have started siviilipalvelus, although it does not force companies to renew fixed-term contracts, which is a common occurrence.

HAT-P-32b was first recognized as a possible planet by the planet-searching HATNet Project in 2004, although difficulties in measuring its radial velocity prevented astronomers from verifying the planet until after three years of observation. The Blendanal program helped to rule out most of the alternatives that could explain what HAT-P-32b was, leading astronomers to determine that HAT-P-32b was most likely a planet. The discovery of HAT-P-32b and of HAT-P-33b was submitted to a journal on 6 June 2011. The planet is considered a Hot Jupiter, and although it is slightly less massive than Jupiter, it is bloated to nearly twice Jupiter's size. At the time of its discovery, HAT-P-32b had one of the largest radii known amongst extrasolar planets. This phenomenon, which has also been observed in planets like WASP-17b and HAT-P-33b, has shown that something more than temperature is influencing why these planets become so large. Discovery It had been suggested that a planet was in the orbit of the star HAT-P-32 as early as 2004; these observations were collected by the six-telescope HATNet Project, an organization in search of transiting planets, or planets that cross in front of their host stars as seen from Earth. However, attempts to confirm the planetary candidate were extremely difficult because of a high level of jitter (a random, shaky deviation in the measurements of HAT-P-32's radial velocity) present in the star's observations. High-level jitter prevented the most common technique, that of bisector analysis, from revealing the star's radial velocity with enough certainty to confirm the planet's existence. The spectrum of HAT-P-32 was collected using the digital speedometer on Arizona's Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (FLWO). Analysis of the data found that HAT-P-32 was a single, moderately rotating dwarf star. Some of its parameters were also derived, including its effective temperature and surface gravity. Between August 2007 and December 2010, twenty-eight spectra were collected using the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) at the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. Twenty-five of these spectra were used to deduce HAT-P-32's radial velocity. To compensate for jitter, a greater number of spectra than that the usual for planetary candidates was collected. From this, it was concluded that stellar activity (and not the presence of yet-undiscovered planets) was the cause of the jitter. Because astronomers concluded that the use of radial velocity could not, alone, establish the existence of planet HAT-P-32b, the KeplerCam CCD instrument on FLWO's 1.2m telescope was used to take photometric observations of HAT-P-32. The data collected using KeplerCam CCD helped astronomers constructed HAT-P-32's light curve. The light curve displayed a slight dimming at a point where HAT-P-32b was believed to transit its star. The astronomers utilized Blendanal, a program used to eliminate the possibilities of false positives. This process serves a similar purpose to the Blender technique, which was used to verify some planets discovered by the Kepler spacecraft. In doing so, HAT-P-32's planet-like signature was found to not be caused by either a hierarchical triple star system or by a mixture of light between a bright single star and that of a binary star in the background. Although the possibility that HAT-P-32 is actually a binary star with a dim secondary companion nearly indistinguishable from the primary companion could not be ruled out, HAT-P-32b was confirmed as a planet based on the Blendanal analysis. Because of the high jitter of the star, the best way to collect more data on HAT-P-32b would be to observe an occultation of HAT-P-32b behind its star using the Spitzer Space Telescope. HAT-P-32b's discovery was reported with that of HAT-P-33b in the Astrophysical Journal. Host star HAT-P-32, or GSC 3281‚Äì00800, is a double star; the primary is a G-type or F-type dwarf star, and the secondary is a M-type dwarf star. The system is located away from Earth. With 1.176 solar masses and 1.387 solar radii, HAT-P-32A is both larger and more massive than the Sun. HAT-P-32A's effective temperature is 6,001 K, making it slightly hotter than the Sun, although it is younger, at an estimated age of 3.8 billion years, thus begun nuclear fusion in its core not long after the Archean eon started billion years ago. HAT-P-32A is metal-poor; its measured metallicity is [Fe/H] = -0.16, which means that it has 69% the iron content of the Sun. The star's surface gravity is determined to be 4.22, while its luminosity suggests that it emits 2.43 times the amount of energy that the Sun emits. These parameters are adopted given the condition that the planet HAT-P-32b has an irregular (eccentric) orbit. HAT-P-32 has an apparent magnitude of 11.197, which makes it invisible to the naked eye. A search for a binary companion star using adaptive optics at the MMT Observatory discovered a companion at a distance of 2.9 arcseconds that is 3.4 magnitudes dimmer than the primary star. A very high level of jitter has been detected in the star's spectrum. There is a possibility that the jitter could be induced by the dimmer secondary companion. HAT-P-32's dimmer constituent probably has a mass that is under half of the Sun's mass, while it has a temperature of K. Other planets with orbital periods that are smaller than that of HAT-P-32b's orbit may be present in this system. However, when the discovery of the planet was published, not enough radial velocity measurements had been collected to determine if this was the case. Characteristics HAT-P-32b is a Hot Jupiter that has 0.941 Jupiter masses and 2.037 Jupiter radii. In other words, HAT-P-32b is slightly less massive than Jupiter is, although it is nearly twice Jupiter's size. The planet's average distance from its host star is 0.0344 AU, or approximately 3% of the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun. It completes an orbit every 2.150009 days (51.6 hours). HAT-P-32b has an equilibrium temperature of 1888 K, which is fifteen times hotter than Jupiter's equilibrium temperature.. Nonetheless, limb temperature measured in 2020 was much cooler at 1248 K. Many of the described characteristics are derived on the assumption that HAT-P-32b has an orbit that is elliptical (eccentric). The best fit for HAT-P-32b's orbital eccentricity is 0.163, denoting a slightly elliptical orbit, although the jitter effect observed in its host star has made the planet's eccentricity difficult to accurately find. The discoverers have also derived the planet's characteristics assuming that the planet has a circular orbit, although they have given preference to the elliptical model. Because of HAT-P-32b's orbital inclination with respect to Earth is 88.7¬∫, the planet is seen almost edge-on with respect to Earth. It has been found to transit its host star. The study in 2012, utilizing a Rossiter‚ÄìMcLaughlin effect, have determined the planet is orbiting at nearly polar orbit relative to the rotation of the star, misalignment equal to 85¬∞. HAT-P-32b had one of the highest radii known amongst planets at the time of its discovery. Like planets HAT-P-33b and WASP-17b, which are similarly inflated, the mechanism behind this is unknown; it is not solely related to temperature, which is known to have an effect. This is especially clear when compared to WASP-18b, a planet that is hotter than the aforementioned HAT and WASP planets, because despite its temperature its radius is far lower than that of its counterparts. It was also found that the planet radius, observed with planetary transits, varies with wavelength. Different radii for each wavelength could arise from an atmosphere where a Rayleigh scattering haze is combined with a grey cloud deck. The thick (clouds up to pressure level of 0.4-33 kPa) cloud deck and haze above it was indeed confirmed in 2020, along with detection of water in atmosphere of HAT-P-32b.
