It is a subsidiary of FirstGroup. History Jurassic Coast liveried Wright Eclipse Gemini bodied Volvo B7TL First Hampshire & Dorset was created out of various different smaller companies which were merged once FirstGroup had acquired them. In October 1995 FirstGroup purchased the bus services in Fareham, Gosport and Portsmouth operated by People's Provincial. In April 1996 FirstGroup purchased services in Portsmouth from Transit Holdings trading as Red Admiral & Blue Admiral, which in turn had taken over the Portsmouth CityBus operations under the title of Southdown Portsmouth. This operation was then put under the control of People's Provincial and the whole renamed to First Provincial. In 1997 FirstGroup purchased Southampton Citybus and after a brief period of using the Citybus name, the operation was renamed First Southampton. In 1999 First Southampton merged with First ProvincialCompanies House extract company no 2110585 First Provincial Buses Limited formerly The Provincial Bus Company Limited to form First Hampshire, later being renamed First Hampshire & Dorset. In 1999 FirstGroup purchased Southern National with the Dorset operations merged to form First Hampshire & Dorset in 2003. In 2010 The headquarters was moved from Portswood where Southampton Citybus was based to Empress Road by the River Itchen in Southampton, whilst the former depot was closed and sold off, ending 130 years of its purpose as a depot.  Divisions  First Hampshire and Dorset operate within seven different cities within the two counties and are grouped into the following divisions: = First Southampton = First Southampton run their buses using the \\"city red\\" (stylised as CITY RED) branding, which in 2014 started to replace and rebrand routes that were previously under the generic First livery. They have nine routes that cover from Totton and Millbrook to Sholing and West End with all but one route terminating at the city. The city red branding initially consisted of 30 buses, with a fleet of Volvo B7RLE Wright Eclipse Urbans and Wright Streetlites before expanding. The branding itself is reminiscent of the original Southampton Citybus operator that used to run in the city. The buses that were inherited from Southampton Citybus were either repainted or transferred to other FirstGroup divisions and by the mid 2010's any remaining step entrance buses were sold or scrapped. For a time, First Southampton had ran routes to the University of Southampton as an agreement with them for three years in 1998, under the Unilink brand. These had gas powered Duple Dartlines with the Dennis Dart chassis liveried in a mix of blue and pink colours. = First Wessex, Dorset & Somerset = First Wessex, Dorset & Somerset run services situated near the coastline. This division was created as a result of the purchase and later split of Southern National and the Dorset operations was merged into what would become First Hampshire and Dorset. They have 15 routes, of which four are branded under the \\"Jurassic Coaster\\" name. Most of the routes run close to the city centre with an exception of a few that go to Dorcester and Southwell and all but one route starts and ends in Weymouth town centre with route 7 running only around Bridport and not anywhere near Weymouth. Their fleet consists of a number of Wright-bodied and integral buses and Optare Solo SRs.  Jurassic Coaster  Jurassic Coaster is a branding given to several of the routes running along the Jurassic coast. There are four routes that run under this and out of them, only two run throughout the year. X51 runs from Dorchester to Axminster via Lee Lane, X53 runs from Weymouth to Axminster via Bridport, 501 runs from Weymouth to Portland Bill and the X54 runs to Weymouth from Poole via Lulworth Cove, all of which run on a two-hourly frequency. These are served by Alexander ALX400-bodied Volvo B7TLs and Wright Eclipse Gemini bodied Volvo B9TLs. = First Portsmouth, Fareham & Gosport = First Portsmouth, Fareham & Gosport run multiple different services within Portsea island and the Gosport Peninsula with the majority of the routes run using the Solent Branding. In this division there are 16 routes which are divided into routes in Fareham and Gosport and routes in Portsmouth. The routes in Fareham can cover from Sarisbury and Wickham to Portchester and Gosport. The majority of the routes in Fareham and Gosport either end or stop via Fareham. The routes in Portsmouth have destinations in Southsea, Eastney and Hilsea with some going into Waterloovile and Southampton. Their fleet ranges from ADL Enviro200 MMCs and Wright Streetlites to East Lancs Myllennium Lolynes and Optare Solos.  The Star  The Star (stylised as THE STAR) is one of the brands that First Portsmouth, Fareham & Gosport use which follows along the A3 that replaced the Portsdown and Horndean tram service which had been superseded by motor buses in 1935. The brand itself was started in 2008 with the creation of the A3 corridor. There are two routes under this brand: Route 7 runs along London road (A2407) from Portsmouth university via Cosham and Crookhorn before ending in Wecock Farm whilst route 8 uses the A3 starting its journey at Old Portsmouth Clarence Pier via The hard, Cosham, Purbrook and Horndean and terminating at Catherington.  Eclipse  Eclipse is one of the brands that First Portsmouth, Fareham & Gosport use which uses an unguided busway that runs from Redlands Lane to Titchbourne Way, however the full route runs from Fareham Bus Station to Gosport Ferry in an attempt to reduce congestion on the A32 and improve connectivity between the two cities. Fleet Wright Handybus bodied Dennis Dart in Southampton in September 2008 in First Provincial livery As of March 2013 the fleet consisted of 360 buses.FirstGroup Fleetlist Steve White In Weymouth, First operate a number of Wright StreetLite buses on routes 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 10 purchased between 2013 and 2014.

Wright Eclipse-bodied Volvo B7RLEs which started operation in 2008 which was subsequently replaced by Wright Eclipse Urban 2s in 2017 which were displaced to other FirstGroup divisions. Several Wright Eclipse Gemini bodied Volvo B9TLs operating mostly on route X53 between Poole and Axminster were bought in 2008. Six Scania N94UDs were bought in 2004 & 2005 operating on route X51, which had left the fleet earlier in 2020. In Southampton, First inherited a large number of Leyland Atlanteans from Southampton Citybus along with Leyland Lynxs, Leyland Olympians and gas powered Dennis Darts. All of these have now been withdrawn from the Southampton fleet. An unusual vehicle inherited from the Provincial fleet was the first ACE Cougar, one of just two built, which has also been withdrawn.http://www.provincialsociety.org/survivors/h523ctr.htm First introduced a number of bus types that are also no longer in service in Southampton; these include Volvo B7LA / Wright Eclipse Fusion bendy buses introduced in 2000 but transferred to First Glasgow in 2003 after they proved unsuitable for a number of Southampton roads,This is Hampshire.net - \\"Getting the hump\\" - Bendy buses have trouble over speed bumps former First Capital Dennis Arrows proved unpopular in Southampton and moved onto First Greater Manchester in 2006. First had operated Optare Solos on the free City-link service between Southampton Central Station, West Quay Shopping Centre and Town Quay, these left the Southampton fleet when First lost the City-link contract to Unilink, which subsequently became franchised to Bluestar in 2008. The fleet that remains in Southampton are now all Wright Streetlite buses, with the last of the Wright Eclipse Urban-bodied Volvo B7RLEs transferring to First Wessex in August 2020.

There were nine concessions in old Tianjin altogether. These concessions also contributed to the rapid development of Tianjin from the early to mid-20th century. The first concessions in Tianjin were granted in 1860. By 1943, all the foreign concessions, save the Japanese concession, had ceased to exist de facto. General context Prior to the 19th century, the Chinese were concerned that European trade and missionary activity would upset the order of the empire. Strictly controlled and subject to import tariffs, European traders were limited to operating in Canton and Macao. Following a series of military defeats against Britain and France, the Qing were slowly forced to permit extraterritoriality for foreign nationals and even cessions of Chinese sovereignty over certain ports and mineral rights. Troops of the Eight-Nation Alliance, Tianjin, 1900 Tianjin's position at the intersection of the Grand Canal and the Peiho River connecting Beijing to the Bohai Bay made it one of the premier ports of northern China. Foreign trade was approved there for the British and French by the 1860 Peking Convention. Its importance increased even further when it was connected to the Tangshan coal fields by the Kaiping Tramway, the railroad that eventually connected all of northern China and Manchuria. Between 1895 and 1900, the two original powers were joined by Japan, Germany, Russia, Austria-Hungary, Italy and Belgiumcountries without concessions elsewhere in Chinain establishing self-contained concessions each with their own prisons, schools, barracks and hospitals. The European settlements covered in all, the riverfront being governed by foreign powers. After decades, the Japanese, French, and British concessions (which were situated on the right bank of the Peiho River) became the most prosperous ones. With the overthrow of the Chinese Qing dynasty, the new Republic of China managed a restructuring of Chinese domestic and foreign relations, allowing it to recognize European states as equals. In turn, the concessions in Tianjin were dismantled in the early to mid-20th century with successful recognition of the European states of the Republic of China, which gave European property owners equality before Chinese officials. However, World War II disrupted this nascent development: the Japanese seized the concessions of powers allied against it during its occupation of the country. Soon after the war, all foreign powers relinquished their concessions in China, including in Tianjin. Austro-Hungarian concession (1901‚Äì1917) Troops of the Austro- Hungarian naval corps in Tianjin Austria-Hungary participated in the Eight- Nation Alliance that suppressed the Boxer rebellion (1899‚Äì1901). Austria- Hungary together with Italy sent the smallest force of the Eight-Nation Alliance. Four cruisers and 296 Hungarian enlisted soldiers were dispatched. On December 27, 1902, Austria-Hungary gained a concession zone in Tianjin as part of the reward for its contribution to the Alliance. The Austro-Hungarian concession zone was in area, situated next to the Pei-Ho river and outlined by the Imperial channel and the Tianjin-Beijing railway track. Its population was around 30,000 people. Order was maintained by 40 Austro-Hungarian marines and 70 Chinese militia (Shimbo). The self-contained concession had its own thermae, theatre, pawnshop, school, barracks, prison, cemetery and hospital. It also contained the Austro-Hungarian consulate and its citizens were under Austro-Hungarian, not Chinese rule. Despite its relatively short life-span, the Austrians left their mark on the area, as can be seen in the Austrian architecture in the city. The administration was done by a town council composed of local high-class noblemen and headed by the Austro-Hungarian consul and the military commander, the two of them had a majority vote. The focus of the juridical system was on smaller crimes and it was based on Austro-Hungarian law. If a Chinese person committed a crime on Chinese soil he could be tried in their own courts. Yuan's mansion in the Austro-Hungarian concession, built in 1908‚Äì1918 Austria-Hungary was, due to World War I, unable to maintain control of its concession. The concession zone was swiftly occupied by China at the Chinese declaration of war on the Central powers and on 14 August 1917 the lease was terminated, along with that of the larger German concession in the same city. Austria finally abandoned all claim to it on September 10, 1919 (Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye), Hungary made a similar recognition on June 4, 1920 (Treaty of Trianon). The former Austro- Hungarian concession renamed the \\"Second Special District\\", was placed under the permanent administration of the Chinese government. Belgian concession (1902‚Äì1931) The Belgian Concession was established in 1902 after Belgian envoy Maurice Joostens claimed the parcel in the negotiations following the defeat of the Boxer rebels. Located on the eastern bank of the Hai River (Hai He), the Belgian government and business community did not invest in development of the concession. The concession was nominal and of little value and an agreement to return the concession to China was signed in August 1929 and approved by the Belgian parliament in 1931. Main street in the Belgian concession, 1907 Much more important were contracts involving railways, electric power systems and tramways built and partly operated by Belgian private companies. In 1904, China and Belgium signed a contract with the Compagnie de tramways et d'√©clairage de Tientsin, giving the company an official monopoly for 50 years over trams and electric lighting in the city. In 1906, with the opening of the first route of the tramway system, Tianjin became the first Chinese city to have a modern public transportation system (Shanghai had to wait until 1908 to get electric tramways). The supply of electricity and lighting and the trolley business were profitable ventures. By 1914, the network covered the Chinese city as well as the Austrian, French, Italian, Japanese and Russian concessions. The Compagnie de tramways et d'√©clairage de Tientsin was taken over by the Japanese army in 1943 and the members of the Belgian staff, often with their families, were sent to internment camps. Following the end of World War II, the Chinese authorities took over the network. The Brussels-based company tried to get compensation, but the Chinese Revolution in 1949 left them without any indemnity. Two more lines were built under Chinese administration, but the network was finally closed around 1972. British concession (1860‚Äì1943) Victoria Road, British concession, 1920s British Indian troops on parade in Tianjin in the 1920s The British concession, which contained the trade and financial centres, was situated on the right bank of the river Haihe below the native city, occupying some . It was held on a lease in perpetuity granted by the Chinese government to the British Crown, which sublet plots to private owners in the same way as was done at Hankou. The local management was entrusted to a municipal council organized on lines similar to those in Shanghai. The seat of government was the stately Gordon Hall, situated on the financial street called Victoria Road (now Jiefang Lu). The British concession was blockaded by the Japanese during the Tientsin incident in June 1939, causing a major diplomatic crisis. The Japanese occupied the British concession upon their declaration of war against Britain on 7 December 1941 until the end of the war. The British concession in Tianjin was formally returned to China with the Sino-British Treaty for the Relinquishment of Extra-Territorial Rights in China, ratified on 20 May 1943, although the Chinese could not take possession until the end of the war ended the Japanese occupation. French concession (1860‚Äì1946) Bastille Day in 1911 Rue de France The French concession was established in 1860. After more than 100 years, almost every prominent building in the original concession is still extant, including the French Consulate, the Municipal Council, the French Club, the Catholic Cathedral, the French Garden and many others. Many of the bank buildings along the financial street (currently Jiefang Lu, formerly the Rue de France) are still in existence today. French armoured car in Tianjin during the 1928 troubles The villas around the Garden Road are beautiful and diverse. Many French celebrities lived in Tianjin. Among them, Paul Claudel (consul 1906 - 1909), and the natural scientist Father Emile Licent who conducted research in Tianjin from 1914 to 1939. He founded the Musee Hoang-Ho Pai-Ho (Museum of Yellow River and Peiho River) and left it 20,000 specimens of animals, plants and fossils, as well as 15,000 books. In 1998, the Tianjin government rebuilt the Tianjin Nature Museum. The dome of the French Cathedral was damaged during the Cultural Revolution: some young Red Guards climbed to the top of the dome to destroy the cross, though later the Tianjin government not only repaired the cross but also renovated the entire church. German concession (1899‚Äì1917) By the late 1870s, the German Empire was on a course of extensive economic involvement in several Chinese provinces, among them the Tianjin area. The German enclave south of the Hai River was situated between the British and one of the Japanese concessions. In July 1877 xenophobic groups threatened the life and property of German merchants in Tianjin. Local unrest intensified, mainly due to poor harvests and resulting famine, and Tianjin business interests requested armed protection. The German admiralty then dispatched the corvette SMS Luise to China. This initial show of support eventually evolved into a permanent presence in Chinese waters by initially modest German naval forces. Street in the German concession on the eve of World War I The German Boxer War Memorial, 1905 After Germany acquired the Kiautschou Bay region in 1898 with a 99-year lease, a further concession was negotiated for the Tianjin enclave and economic growth escalated with infrastructure improvements. Major trading houses and diverse enterprises established themselves, including a branch of the Deutsch-Asiatische Bank. The Boxer rebellion of 1900 initially laid siege to the foreign concessions in Tianjin, but the city was secured and used as a staging area for the eventual march on Peking by the eight-nation international relief forces. China swiftly occupied the German concession after it declared war on the Central Powers in August 1917. In 1919, the former concession, renamed the \\"First Special District\\", was placed under the permanent administration of the Chinese government. The United States 15th Infantry was billeted in the former German barracks from 1917 until 1938, departing only after the Imperial Japanese Army entered Tianjin. Italian concession (1901‚Äì1943) British and Italian units marching in Tianjin On September 7, 1901, Italy was granted a concession in Tianjin from the Chinese government. On June 7, 1902, the Italians took control of the concession, which was to be administered by an Italian consul. It became the headquarters of the Italian Legione Redenta (an \\"Italian legio\\" made of irredentist troops in the defeated Austro-Hungarian empire), that fought in 1919 against Lenin's Soviet troops in Siberia and Manchuria. The Italian World War I monument and the Piazza Regina Elena When Tianjin became in danger of being stormed by warring factions during the civil war of 1927‚Äì1928, Italian troops temporarily occupied the Second Special District to protect the city's power station and main railway station. They withdrew after a short while. In 1935, the Italian Concession had a population of about 6,261, including about 536 foreigners. The Regia Marina (Italian Royal Navy) stationed some vessels in Tianjin. During World War II, the concession had a garrison of approximately 600 Italian troops. On September 10, 1943, when Italy signed an armistice with the Allies, the concession was occupied by the Imperial Japanese Army. Later in 1943, the Italian Social Republic (RSI) ceded the concession to Wang Jingwei's Japanese-sponsored Chinese puppet state, the Reorganized National Government of China. The Italians were never to regain control over the concession and the Republic of Italy's surrender of all its rights over it by the peace treaty of 1947, was therefore a mere formality. Japanese concession (1898‚Äì1945) Asahi Road, Japanese concession The Japanese concession was initially established in 1898 in the aftermath of the First Sino-Japanese War and additional areas were added in 1900‚Äì1902 after the Boxer Rebellion. In 1937, the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) occupied the entire city of Tianjin excluding the foreign concessions. These were occupied in 1941 and in 1943. The Japanese concession ceased to exist with the capitulation of Japan in 1945. In 1924, the last emperor of the Qing Dynasty, Puyi, was forced to leave the Forbidden City in Beijing and lived in Tianjin until 1931 when he was forcibly taken by the Japanese army to Dalian. The imperial concubine Wenxiu divorced Puyi in Tianjin, which was the first time in Chinese dynastic history that an imperial concubine divorced an emperor. Russian concession (1900‚Äì1920) The Russsian consulate in Tianjin in 1912 A treaty granting a concession to the Russian Empire in Tianjin was signed 31 December 1900. Even before the official treaty was signed, the general in charge of the Russian forces in the city since the Boxer Rebellion had already laid claim to the future concession by right of conquest and Russian troops had already begun placing boundary markers. The concession, on the left bank of the Peiho River, was larger than any of the other foreign concessions, which according to the agreement was due to \\"Russian trade at Tientsin being on the increase\\". In reality, Russian economic involvement in Tientsin was insignificant and became even more so after the Russian defeat in the Russo-Japanese War. For this reason, the concession remained largely underdeveloped. The concession was divided into two non-contiguous districts (east and west). In 1920 the Chinese Beiyang government retook the land and concession from the Russian SFSR and in 1924, the Soviet Union renounced its claim on the concession. American concession (1869‚Äì1902) Postcard from the American concession Troops of the 15th Infantry on parade, 1931 The United States never requested or received extraterritorial rights in Tianjin, but a de facto concession was administered from 1869 until 1880, principally under the aegis of the British mission. In 1902 this informal American territory became part of the British concession. The United States maintained a permanent garrison at Tianjin, provided from January 1912 until 1938 by the 15th Infantry, US Army, and then by the US Marine Corps until December 8, 1941, the day the United States entered the Second World War and all territories of the US and the British Empire in Asia and the Pacific faced the threat of attack by the Empire of Japan.

Early life and education S√ºt≈ë was born into a poor peasant family in CƒÉmƒÉra»ôu (), in Cluj County, Transylvania. He received his primary and secondary school education in the Reformed College of Aiud and in the Reformed gymnasium in Cluj. After secondary school, he studied Stage Directing at the Szentgy√∂rgyi Istv√°n College of Dramatic Arts in Cluj. Career =Journalism= S√ºt≈ë quit college in order to become the editor in chief of the Falvak N√©pe weekly. He moved to Bucharest in 1951 because the editorial office was relocated there. S√ºt≈ë could not identify himself with the political environment of the 1950s in the capital and returned to T√¢rgu Mure≈ü, Transylvania, in 1954, where he edited Igaz Sz√≥, a literary magazine. He held this post till 1957, after which he edited Uj √âlet, an illustrated magazine, till 1989. =Literature= S√ºt≈ë's first work (A Letter to a Romanian Friend) was published by the Hungarian-language Vil√°goss√°g journal in Cluj, when he was 18. His writing career ranged across genres, with short stories (F√©lrej√°r√≥ Salamon, 1955), satire (Pomp√°s Gedeon, 1967), historical drama (Egy l√≥csisz√°r vir√°gvas√°rnapja, 1974; Csillag a m√°gly√°n, 1974; Szuzai menyegzo, 1981), and myth and folklore (K√°in √©s Abel, 1977; Advent a Hargit√°n, 1987). The dramas, in particular, probed the duty of the individual, confronted by arbitrary authority, to preserve his dignity and identity even at the cost of his life. He served as vice-president of the Writers' Association of Romania between 1974 and 1982. From 1980, aiming to curb his dissent against the Nicolae Ceau≈üescu regime's repression of Romania's Hungarian minorities, Andr√°s S√ºt≈ë's works were banned from publication and presentation. Consequently, between 1980 and 1989 he could publish only in Hungary. During this period, he and his family were constantly harassed by the authorities and the Securitate. =Politics= A committed Communist, S√ºt≈ë was Member of the Great National Assembly, the parliament of Communist Romania, between 1965 and 1977. But his observations of the fate of the indigent Romanian and Hungarian villagers in Transylvania under forced collectivisation in the 1950s and his discontent with the increasing centralisation of political power brought him disfavour from the Ceau≈üescu government. Increasing, too, was his opposition to the regime's pressure to \\"homogenise\\" the various nationalities in the country, such as restrictions against the use of the Hungarian language. By the time of Ceau≈üescu's removal from power in 1989, S√ºt≈ë was a well-known public figure, respected for his support of the rights of the Hungarian people in Romania. =Awards= In 1979, S√ºt≈ë was awarded the Herder Prize. He has also received G√°bor Bethlen Prize (1990), and the Kossuth Prize (1992). Later life S√ºt≈ë had his eye gouged out during the 1990 ethnic clashes of T√¢rgu Mure≈ü, and had to undergo treatment in Hungary. He died on 30 August 2006 in Budapest, where he was undergoing treatment for cancer.

Grapevines and photovoltaic panels (r.) rely on the sun at Cooper Vineyards in Louisa, Virginia, the first winery on the East Coast and the second in the country awarded the fourth and highest, Platinum certification by Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is a green building certification program used worldwide. Developed by the non-profit U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) it includes a set of rating systems for the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of green buildings, homes, and neighborhoods which aims to help building owners and operators be environmentally responsible and use resources efficiently. History Development of LEED began in 1993, spearheaded by Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) senior scientist Robert K. Watson. JD Polk co-founder of Solar Cells Inc (First Solar) also contributed to the guidelines set forth in the initial formation, as did long time solar advocate Lawton Chiles the Gov of Fla at the time. As founding chairman of the LEED Steering Committee, Watson led a broad-based consensus process until 2007, bringing together non-profit organizations, government agencies, architects, engineers, developers, builders, product manufacturers and other industry leaders. The LEED initiative was supported by a strong USGBC Board of Directors, chaired by Steven Winter from 1999 to 2003, and very active staff, including Nigel Howard. At that time, USGBC's Senior Vice President of LEED, Scot Horst, became chair of the LEED Steering Committee before joining USGBC staff. Early LEED committee members also included USGBC co-founder Mike Italiano, architects Bill Reed and Sandy Mendler, builders Gerard Heiber and Myron Kibbe, and engineer Richard Bourne. As interest in LEED grew, in 1996, engineers Tom Paladino and Lynn Barker co-chaired the newly formed LEED technical committee. From 1994 to 2015, LEED grew from one standard for new construction to a comprehensive system of interrelated standards covering aspects from the design and construction to the maintenance and operation of buildings. LEED also has grown from six volunteers on one committee to 119,924 staff, volunteers and professionals. LEED standards have been applied to approximately 83,452 registered and certified LEED projects worldwide, covering around 13.8 billion square feet (1.28 billion square meters). Many U.S. federal agencies, states, and local governments require or reward LEED certification. However, four states (Alabama, Georgia, Maine, and Mississippi) have effectively banned the use of LEED in new public buildings, preferring other industry standards that the USGBC considers too lax. Unlike model building codes, such as the International Building Code, only members of the USGBC and specific \\"in-house\\" committees may add to, subtract from, or edit the standard, subject to an internal review process. Proposals to modify the LEED standards are offered and publicly reviewed by USGBC's member organizations, which number almost 6660. USGBC's Green Business Certification Inc. (GBCI) offers various accreditation to people who demonstrate knowledge of the LEED rating system, including LEED Accredited Professional (LEED AP), LEED Green Associate,and since 2011, LEED Fellows, the highest designation for LEED professionals. GBCI also certifies projects pursuing LEED. Rating systems LEED has evolved since 1998 to more accurately represent and incorporate emerging green building technologies. The pilot version, LEED New Construction (NC) v1.0, led to LEED NCv2.0, LEED NCv2.2 in 2005, and LEED 2009 (previously named LEED v3) in 2009. LEED v4 was introduced in November, 2013. Until October 31, 2016, new projects could choose between LEED 2009 and LEED v4. New projects registering after October 31, 2016 have been required to use LEED v4. LEED 2009 encompasses ten rating systems for the design, construction and operation of buildings, homes and neighborhoods. Five overarching categories correspond to the specialties available under the LEED professional program. That suite currently consists of: Green Building Design & Construction *LEED for New Construction *LEED for Core & Shell *LEED for Schools *LEED for Retail: New Construction and Major Renovations *LEED for Healthcare Green Interior Design & Construction *LEED for Commercial Interiors *LEED for Retail: Commercial Interiors Green Building Operations & Maintenance *LEED for Existing Buildings: Operations & Maintenance Green Neighborhood Development *LEED for Neighborhood Development Green Home Design and Construction *LEED for Homes (The LEED for Homes rating system is different from LEED v3, with different point categories and thresholds that reward efficient residential design. These Guidelines were also adopted by the DOE Net Zero Energy Homes Project JD Polk Brought to the DOE 2005 LEED also forms the basis for other sustainability rating systems such as the Environmental Protection Agency's Labs21. =LEED 2009= Abad Nucleus Mall, at Maradu, Kochi, is India's first LEED certified gold-rated green mall.After four years of development, aligning credit across all LEED rating systems and weighing credits based on environmental priority, USGBC launched LEED v3, which consists of a new continuous development process, a new version of LEED Online, a revised third-party certification program and a new suite of rating systems known as LEED 2009. Under LEED 2009, there are 100 possible base points distributed across six credit categories: \\"Sustainable Sites\\", \\"Water Efficiency\\", \\"Energy and Atmosphere\\", \\"Materials and Resources\\", \\"Indoor Environmental Quality\\", and \\"Innovation in Design\\". Up to 10 additional points may be earned: four additional points may be received for Regional Priority Credits, and six additional points for Innovation in Design (which includes exemplary performance credits for existing credit categories).Taipei 101, the tallest and largest LEED Platinum certified building in the world since 2011. Certification level Buildings can qualify for four levels of certification: *Certified: 40-49 points *Silver: 50-59 points *Gold: 60-79 points *Platinum: 80 points and above Goal of the credit system The LEED 2009 performance credit system aims to allocate points \\"based on the potential environmental impacts and human benefits of each credit.\\" These are weighed using the environmental impact categories of the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Tools for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and Other Environmental Impacts (TRACI). and the environmental-impact weighting scheme developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Prerequisites To participate in LEED 2009, a building must comply with environmental laws and regulations, occupancy scenarios, building permanence and pre-rating completion, site boundaries and area-to-site ratios. Its owner must share data on the building's energy and water use for five years after occupancy (for new construction) or date of certification (for existing buildings). Each of the performance categories also have mandatory measures in each category, which receive no points. Credit weighting process The weighting process has three steps: p. xii. # A collection of reference buildings are used to estimate the environmental impacts of any building seeking LEED certification in a designated rating scheme. # NIST weightings are used to judge the relative importance of these impacts in each category. # Data regarding actual impacts on environmental and human health are used to assign points to individual categories and measures. This system results in a weighted average for each rating scheme based upon actual impacts and the relative importance of those impacts to human health and environmental quality. The LEED council also appears to have assigned credit and measure weighting based upon the market implications of point allocation. From 2010, buildings can use carbon offsets to achieve Green Power Credits for LEED-NC (New Construction Certification) : =LEED for Homes= Additional performance categories in the LEED for Homes rating system are Locations and Linkages (recognizing the importance of transportation access, open space, and physical activity outdoors) and Awareness and Education (recognizing the need for buildings and settlements to educate occupants). These Guidelines were also adopted by the DOE Net Zero Energy Homes Project JD Polk Brought to the DOE. R&D; lead by http://EPHOT.live =LEED 2014= For LEED BD+C v4 credit, the IEQ category addresses thermal, visual, and acoustic comfort as well as indoor air quality. The thermal comfort credit applies one point to the following certification types: New Construction, Schools, Retail, Data Centers, Warehouses and Distribution Centers, Hospitality, and Healthcare. The intent of this credit is to \\"promote occupants' productivity, comfort, and well-being by providing thermal comfort.\\" Occupants' satisfaction and performance is directly affected by a building's thermal conditions as shown by laboratory and field research. Energy reduction goals can be supported while improving thermal satisfaction. For example, research has shown providing occupants control over the thermostat or operable window allows for comfort across a wider range of temperatures. =LEED Canada= In 2003, the Canada Green Building Council received permission to create LEED Canada-NC v1.0, which was based upon LEED- NC 2.0. Many buildings in Canada are LEED certified in part due to their Rainwater harvesting practices. =Process= LEED certification is granted by the Green Building Certification Institute (GBCI), which handles the third- party verification of a project's compliance with the LEED requirements. The certification process for design teams is made up of two consecutive applications: one including design credits, and one including construction credits. All of the LEED credits in each rating system are assigned to either the design application or the construction application. The design credits include those that are the purview of the architect and the engineer, and are documented in the official construction drawings. The construction credits include those that are predominantly under the purview of the contractor, and are documented during the construction and commissioning of the building. A fee is required to register the building, and to submit the design and construction applications. Total fees are assessed based on building area. Fees range from a minimum of $2,900 to over $1 million for a large project.Hughes, Timothy. (2011-01-01) The True Cost of LEED-Certified Green Buildings  Archive content from HPAC Engineering . Hpac.com. Retrieved on 2014-06-23. \\"Soft\\" costs, i.e., added costs to the building project to qualify for LEED certification, range from 1% to 6% of the total project cost. The average cost increase was about 2%, or an extra $3‚Äì$5 per square foot. The application review and certification process is handled on LEED Online, USGBC's web-based service that employs a series of active PDF forms to allow project teams to fill out credit forms and upload supporting documentation online. The GBCI also utilizes LEED Online to conduct their reviews. =LEED energy modeling= Design teams have the option of achieving points under the Optimize Energy Performance credit by building an energy model. This energy model must follow the modeling methodologies outlined in Appendix G of the ASHRAE 90.1 building energy standard. The guidelines in Appendix G require that the team make two energy models: one representing the building as designed, and a second ‚Äúbaseline‚Äù building. The baseline building must be modeled in the same location, and have the same geometry and occupancy as the design building. Depending on location (climate) and building size, the standard provides requirements for HVAC system type, and wall and window definitions. The goal of this methodology is to provide a baseline building to use as a reference point to compare the design building against. It is a way to standardize the baseline, while putting weight on important factors that heavily influence building energy consumption (e.g., location, geometry, and occupancy patterns). The number of points achieved in this credit is correlated with the percent predicted energy cost savings demonstrated by the difference between the design and baseline energy models. This method of energy modeling has been criticized for inaccurately predicting actual energy usage of LEED-certified buildings. The USGBC admits that \\"current information indicates that most buildings do not perform as well as design metrics indicate. As a result, building owners might not obtain the benefits promised.\\" =LEED for Homes Rating System= Today, increasing demand towards environmental safety forces LEED certification to play major role. The process of the LEED for Homes Rating System, available in the United States, Canada and Sweden,LEED Retrieved 16-03-2015. is significantly different from the LEED NC rating system. LEED for Homes projects are low rise residential and are required to work with either an American Provider Organization or a Canadian Provider Organization and a Green Rater. A Provider Organization helps the project through the process while overseeing the Green Raters. Green Raters are individuals that conduct the two mandatory LEED for Homes site inspections; the Thermal Bypass Inspection and the Final Inspection. Although LEED for Homes is typically viewed by the construction industry as a simpler rating system, especially when compared to LEED NC, LEED NC does not require an on-site inspection. The Provider and the Green Rater do not certify the project, but rather assist in the certification process. LEED Performance Research papers provide most of what is known about the performance and effectiveness of LEED in two credit category areas ‚Äì energy and indoor environment quality. In one study of 953 NYC office buildings, 21 LEED certified buildings collectively showed no energy savings compared with non- LEED buildings, although LEED Gold buildings \\"outperformed other NYC office buildings by 20%\\". IEQ-related studies provide two contrasting results - the first used occupant survey results in 65 LEED buildings and 79 non-LEED buildings and it concluded that occupants of LEED certified buildings have equal satisfaction with the building overall and with the workspace than occupants of non-LEED rated buildings and the second used occupant interviews and physical site measurements at 12 LEED buildings to report superior indoor environment performance compared with similar 12 conventional buildings (non- LEED). Buildings certified under LEED do not have to prove energy or water efficiency in practice to receive LEED certification points, but instead LEED uses modeling software to predict future energy use based on intended use. This has led to criticism of LEED's ability to accurately determine the efficiency of buildings. The USGBC itself says that, ‚ÄúBuildings have a poor track record for performing as predicted during design.\\" =Energy performance research= In 2009 Newsham et al. analyzed a database of 100 LEED certified (v3 or earlier version) buildings. In this study, each building was paired with a conventional \\"twin\\" building within the Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) database according to building type and occupancy. On average, LEED buildings consumed 18 to 39% less energy per floor area than their conventional \\"twin\\" buildings, although 28 to 35% of LEED-certified buildings used more energy than their \\"twin.‚Äù The paper found no correlation between the number of energy points achieved or LEED certification level and measured building performance. The Empire State Building in New York City is one of the tallest and most well-known LEED-certified buildings, certified as an existing building In 2009 Scofield published an article in response to Newsham et al., analyzing the same database of LEED buildings and arriving at different conclusions. In his analysis, Scofield criticized that Newsham et al.'s study only considered the energy per floor area instead of a total energy consumption. Scofield considered source energy (accounting for energy losses during generation and transmission) as well as site energy, and used area-weighted energy use intensities, or EUIs (energy per unit area per year), when comparing LEED and non-LEED buildings to account for the fact that larger buildings tend to have larger EUIs. Scofield concluded that, collectively, the LEED-certified buildings showed no significant source energy consumption savings or greenhouse gas emission reductions when compared to non-LEED buildings, although they did consume 10-17% less site energy. Scofield in 2013 analyzed 21 LEED-certified buildings in New York City. He found that buildings that had achieved LEED Gold used, on average, 20% less source energy than did conventional buildings. Buildings with LEED Silver or LEED Certified ratings actually used 11 to 15% more source energy, on average, than did their conventional counterparts. In 2014, Fuertes and Schiavon developed the first study that analyzes plug loads using LEED documented data from certified projects. The study compared plug load assumptions made by 92 energy modeling practitioners against ASHRAE and Title 24 requirements, as well as the evaluation of the plug loads calculation methodology used by 660 LEED-CI and 429 LEED-NC certified projects. In general, energy modelers considered the energy consumption of plug loads of equipment that are constantly running (such as refrigerators) as well as monitors and computers predictable. Overall the results suggested a disconnection between energy modelers assumptions and the actual performance of buildings. In conclusion, the study suggests LEED or ASHRAE to develop guidelines for plug loads calculations. Energy model might be a source of error during LEED design phase. Stoppel and Leite evaluated the predicted and actual energy consumption of two twin buildings using the energy model during the LEED design phase and the utility meter data after one year of occupancy. The study's results suggest that mechanical systems turnover and occupancy assumptions significantly differing from predicted to actual values. Most of the current available energy consumption analysis of LEED buildings focuses on LEED v3 (2009) or even earlier versions certified buildings instead of the newest LEED v4 (2014) certified buildings. According to Newsham et al., these analyses should be considered as preliminary and should be repeated with longer data history and larger sample buildings, including new LEED v4 certified buildings. Newsham et al. also pointed out that further work needs to be done to define green building rating schemes to ensure more consistent and substantial energy consumption reduction success at the individual building level in long term. =Water performance research= =IEQ performance research= The Center for Disease Control defines Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) as \\"the quality of a building's environment in relation to the health and wellbeing of those who occupy space within it.\\" The USGBC includes the following considerations for attaining IEQ credits: indoor air quality, the level of volatile organic compounds, lighting, thermal comfort, and daylighting and views. In consideration of a building's indoor environmental quality, published studies have also included factors such as: acoustics, building cleanliness and maintenance, colors and textures, workstation size, ceiling height, window access and shading, surface finishes, furniture adjustability and comfort. In 2013, a paper published by S. Schiavon and S. Altamonte studied LEED verses non-LEED buildings in relation to occupant IEQ satisfaction. Using occupant surveys from the Center for the Built Environment at Berkeley database, 65 LEED-certified and 79 non-LEED buildings were studied to provide an analysis of 15 IEQ-related factors in the overall building and specific workspaces. These factors include the ease of interaction, building cleanliness, the comfort of furnishing, the amount of light, building maintenance, colors and textures, workplace cleanliness, the amount of space, furniture adjustability, visual comfort, air quality, visual privacy, noise, temperature, and sound privacy. The results showed occupants tend to be slightly more satisfied in LEED buildings for the air quality and slightly more dissatisfied with the amount of light. The overall finding was that there was no significant influence of LEED certification on occupant satisfaction in consideration of the overall building and workspace ratings. The \\"Limitations and Further Studies\\" section states that the data may not be representative of the entire building stock and a randomized approach was not used in the data assessment. Based on similar dataset (21,477 occupants), in 2013, Schiavon and Altomonte, found that occupants have equivalent satisfaction levels in LEED and non-LEED buildings when evaluated independently from the following nine factors: (1) office type, (2) spatial layout, (3) distance from windows, (4) building size, (5) gender, (6) age, (7) type of work, (8) time at workspace, and (9) weekly working hours. LEED certified buildings may provide higher satisfaction in open spaces than in enclosed offices, in smaller buildings than in larger buildings, and to occupants having spent less than one year in their workspaces rather than to those who have used their workspace longer. The study also points out that the positive value of LEED certification from the aspect of occupant satisfaction may tend to decrease with time. In 2015, a study on indoor environmental quality and the potential health benefits of green certified buildings was developed by Allen et al. showing that green buildings provide better indoor environmental quality with direct benefits to human health of occupants of those buildings in comparison to non-green buildings. One of the limitations of the study was the use of subjective health performance indicators since there is a lack of definition on such indicators by current studies. G. Newsham et al. published a detailed study on IEQ and LEED buildings in August 2013. Field studies and Post-Occupancy Evaluations (POE) were performed in 12 ‚Äúgreen‚Äù and 12 ‚Äúconventional‚Äù buildings across Canada and the northern United States. On-site, 974 workstations were measured for thermal conditions, air quality, acoustics, lighting, workstation size, ceiling height, window access and shading, and surface finishes. Responses were positive in the areas of environmental satisfaction, satisfaction with thermal conditions, satisfaction with view from the outside, aesthetic appearance, reduced disturbance from heating, ventilation and air-conditioning noise, workplace image, night-time sleep quality, mood, physical symptoms, and reduced number of airborne particulates. The results showed green buildings exhibited superior performance compared with similar conventional buildings. Current latest study published in 2017, by Altomonte, Schiavon, Kent and Brager, specifically investigated whether a green rating leads to higher occupant satisfaction with IEQ. Based on the analysis of a subset of the CBE Occupant IEQ including 11,243 responses from 93 LEED-certified office buildings, this study found that the achievement of a specific IEQ credit did not substantially increase the satisfaction with the corresponding IEQ factor. In addition, the rating level and version of the certification has no impact on workplace satisfaction. There are some possible explanations. Many intervening factors in the time between design and occupancy can alter the existence or performance of the strategies that LEED awarded. IEQ certification metrics also face the challenges from substantial differences that characterize the modern workplace in terms of spatial needs, task requirements, users‚Äô characteristics, and disciplines of product design and marketing, etc. Survey participants may also misinterpret the satisfaction with an IEQ parameter, or bias with personal attitudes. The daylight credit was updated in LEED v4 to include a simulation option for daylight analysis that uses Spatial Daylight Autonomy (SDA) and Annual Sunlight Exposure (ASE) metrics to evaluate daylight quality in LEED projects. SDA is a metric that measures the annual sufficiency of daylight levels in interior spaces and ASE describes the potential for visual discomfort by direct sunlight and glare. These metrics are approved by IES and described at the LM-83-12 standard. LEED recommend a minimum of 300 lux for at least 50% of total occupied hours of the year for 55% or more square meters (square feet) of the floor occupied area. The threshold recommended by LEED for ASE is that no more than 10% of regularly occupied floor area can be exposed to more than 1000 lux of direct sunlight for more than 250 hours per year. Additionally, LEED requires window shades to be closed when more than 2% of a space is subject to direct sunlight above 1000 lux. According to Reinhart the direct sunlight requirement is a very stringent approach that can disable good daylight design from achieving this credit. Reinhart propose the application of the direct sunlight criterion only in spaces that require stringent control of sunlight (e.g. desks, white boards, etc.). =Sustainable sites research= https://www.nrel.gov/ https://www.ornl.gov/ http://www.atiinc.live =Materials and resources research= https://www.ameresco.com/?utm_source=google&utm;_medium=cpc&utm;_term=%2Bgovernment+energy+efficiency&utm;_content=%21acq%21v2%21s-b-237509904224-2515328626&utm;_campaign=Industries&gclid;=Cj0KCQjwgo_5BRDuARIsADDEntTG9ME5aFxjoKXs6KxaGhIUIEevqYzlNJA_vW6cRqTrXeQK3u5vlAUaAp0XEALw_wcB =Innovation in design research= Innovation generally needs to come with the idea of new designs and high-quality construction technology for LEED architecture. When we mention about the cultural heritage buildings, innovation made a big change in them by using the nanoparticle technology for consolidation and also conservation effects. Inheritance from the past experiences could be sufficient also for the high tech building design, regarding LEED architecture. For cultural heritage buildings, the consolidation and conservation innovations began with the idea of using calcium hydroxide nano-particles for the porous media structures. By this way, the strength and mechanical strength improvement could able to get managed. Also, some other innovation studies could be possible by using titanium, silica, and aluminum-based compounds. For the LEED architecture buildings, when the issue is innovation, the material technology and the construction techniques could be also the first issues to consider on. For the facade of the high rise buildings, such as the Empire State Building in the United States, the surface area give the opportunity to make it possible to design innovation. Empire State that has been completed in April 2013, is one of the well-known and highly reputed skyscrapers of the United States. In New York, there are also 5 other high rise green buildings; Bank of America Building (One Bryant Park), Hearst Building, One World Trade Center, The New York Times Building and Cond√© Nast Building. VOC compounds and the risk of the volatile chemical evaporation from the construction materials through to the air is another challenge to deal with. In Milan/ITALY, sustainable energy and LEED standards high rise buildings also the main issue for so well-qualified companies and university studies. On the point of the high rise skyscraper design, such as with the same idea of all the possible glass facade buildings, there is a great opportunity to consider for the innovative use of glass facade systems in terms of gaining energy from the solar technology. Also to create the \\"luminescent discovery\\" for solar concentrators as the innovation by using nanoparticle technology has been released. Anyway, photovoltaics technology in combination with the chemistry and nanotechnology could be the main idea of the innovation in each cases, in terms of solar energy, for energy star and LEED architecture buildings. LEED Gold awarded project in Istanbul/Turkey - Manzara Adalar, Kartal/ISTANBUL - a great innovation for the LEED architecture and the skyscraper technology. Before this project, Kartal region of the Asian side of the Istanbul has been known with the middle-class housing construction systems and the industrial area of Istanbul. The general architecture in Kartal seaside part was 3-4 storey housing systems and actually the most important role was the contribution to the Turkish industry with the factories that have been established in the last 35-50 years time. After the architectural competition of Kartal Urban Transformation Project, the public view of the Kartal region has been changed. Architect Zaha Hadid has won the competition with an extereme design of totally high rise buildings. This new concept of Kartal, has been the starting point of the innovations and design for the high quality building systems in this old industrial transformation region. Today, Kartal has been gained a complete innovation with the LEED Gold project of \\"Manzara Adalar\\". Some other projects that has been awarded with the LEED certificate in Turkey are, Antakya: Palladium Antakya Shopping Center - LEED Gold awarded, Istanbul: Ronesans Tower- LEED Platinum Awarded, Konya: Konya Science and Innovation Center, LEED Gold Awarded, Istanbul (Maslak): Spine Tower, LEED Gold Awarded, Istanbul: Torun Tower, LEED Gold Awarded. Extreme structures that have been awarded with the LEED certificates are: \\"Amorepacific Headquarters in Seoul\\" by David Chipperfield Architects, \\"Project: Brave New World: SFMOMA by Sn√∏hetta\\" by Sn√∏hetta in San Francisco, CA, \\"Project: UFO in a Sequinned Dress: Centro Bot√≠n in Santander\\" by Renzo Piano Building Workshop in Zusammenarbeit mit Luis Vidal + Architects, in Santander (ES), \\"Project: Vertical factory: Office building in London\\" by Allford Hall Monaghan Morris in London. =Other related research notes= A 2003 analysis of the savings from green building found from a review of 60 LEED buildings that the buildings were, on average, 25-30% more energy efficient. However, it also attributed substantial benefits to the increased productivity from the better ventilation, temperature control, lighting control, and reduced indoor air pollution. As of 2008, LEED (and similar Energy Star) buildings had mostly been evaluated by case studies. From a purely financial perspective, in 2008 several studies found that LEED for-rent office spaces generally charged higher rent and had higher occupancy rates. CoStar Group collects data on properties. The extra cost for the minimum benefit has been estimated at 3%, with an additional 2.5% for silver. More recent studies have confirmed these earlier findings in that certified buildings achieve significantly higher rents, sale prices and occupancy rates as well as lower capitalization rates potentially reflecting lower investment risk. LEED focuses on the design of the building and not on its actual energy consumption, and therefore it has suggested that LEED buildings should be tracked to discover whether the potential energy savings from the design are being used in practice. =Directory of LEED-certified projects= The U.S. Green Building Council provides an online directory of U.S. LEED-certified projects. The Canada Green Building Council provides an online directory of LEED Canada-certified projects. In 2012 the USGBC launched GBIG, the Green Building Information Gateway, in an effort to connect green building efforts and projects from all over the world. It provides searchable access to a database of activities, buildings, places and collections of green building- related information from many sources and programs, as well as, specifically provides information about LEED projects. Professional accreditation The Green Building Certification Institute describes Professional Accreditation as follows: \\"LEED Professional Credentials demonstrate current knowledge of green building technologies, best practices, and the rapidly evolving LEED Rating Systems. They show differentiation in a growing and competitive industry, and they allow for varied levels of specialization. A LEED Professional Credential provides employers, policymakers, and other stakeholders with assurances of an individual's level of competence and is the mark of the most qualified, educated, and influential green building professionals in the marketplace.\\" Credentials include the LEED Green Associate and the various types of specialized LEED Accredited Professionals (AP). Benefits and disadvantages Real estate developers have begun to use LEED certification and a building's green status as selling points LEED certified buildings are intended to use resources more efficiently when compared to conventional buildings simply built to code. However, analysis of energy and water use data from New York City shows that LEED certification does not necessarily make a building more energy or water efficient. Often, when a LEED rating is pursued, the cost of initial design and construction rises. There may be a lack of abundant availability of manufactured building components that meet LEED specifications. Pursuing LEED certification for a project is an added cost in itself as well. This added cost comes in the form of USGBC correspondence, LEED design-aide consultants, and the hiring of the required Commissioning Authority (CxA)‚Äîall of which would not necessarily be included in an environmentally responsible project, unless it also sought a LEED rating. However, these higher initial costs can be effectively mitigated by the savings incurred over time due to the lower-than-industry-standard operational costs typical of a LEED certified building. This Life cycle costing is a method for assessing the total cost of ownership, taking into account all costs of acquiring, owning and operating, and the eventual disposal of a building. Additional economic payback may come in the form of employee productivity gains incurred as a result of working in a healthier environment. Studies suggest that an initial up-front investment of 2% extra yields over ten times that initial investment over the life cycle of the building. Further, the USGBC has stated support for the Architecture 2030, an effort that has set a goal of using no fossil-fuel, greenhouse-gas-emitting energy to operate by 2030. In the progression of sustainable design from simply meeting local buildings codes to USGBC LEED (Certified, Silver, Gold and Platinum) to the Architecture 2030 Challenge, the Living Building Challenge is currently the most stringent sustainable design protocol. The LBC sets 20 imperatives that compel building owners, designers, operators and tenants beyond current USGBC LEED rating levels. LEED is a design tool and not a performance measurement tool. It is also not yet climate-specific, although the newest version hopes to address this weakness partially. Because of this, designers may make materials or design choices that garner a LEED point, even though they may not be the most site- or climate-appropriate choice available. On top of this, LEED is also not energy-specific. Since it only measures the overall performances, builders are free to choose how to achieve points under various categories. A USA Today review showed that 7,100 certified commercial building projects targeted easy and cheap green points, such as creating healthy spaces and providing educational displays in the building. Few builders would really adopt renewable energy because the generators for those energy resources, such as solar photovoltaic, are costly. Builders game the rating system and use certain performances to compensate for the others, making energy conservation the weakest part in the overall evaluation. LEED is a measurement tool for green building in the United States and it is developed and continuously modified by workers in the green building industry, especially in the ten largest metro areas in the U.S.; however, LEED certified buildings have been slower to penetrate small and mid-major markets. Also, some criticism suggests that the LEED rating system is not sensitive and does not vary enough with regard to local environmental conditions. For instance, a building in Maine would receive the same credit as a building in Arizona for water conservation, though the principle is more important in the latter case. Another complaint is that its certification costs require money that could be used to make the building in question even more sustainable. Many critics have noted that compliance and certification costs have grown faster than staff support from the USGBC. For existing buildings LEED has developed LEED-EB. Research has demonstrated that buildings that can achieve LEED-EB equivalencies can generate a tremendous ROI. In a 2008 white paper by the Leonardo Academy comparing LEED-EB buildings vs. data from BOMA's Experience Exchange Report 2007 demonstrated LEED-EB certified buildings achieved superior operating cost savings in 63% of the buildings surveyed ranging from $4.94 to $15.59 per square foot of floor space, with an average valuation of $6.68 and a median valuation of $6.07. In addition the overall cost of LEED-EB implementation and certification ranged from $0.00 to $6.46 per square foot of floor space, with an average of $2.43 per square foot demonstrating that implementation is not expensive, especially in comparison to cost savings. These costs should be significantly reduced if automation and technology are integrated into the implementation. Incentive programs Many federal, state, and local governments and school districts have adopted various types of LEED initiatives and incentives. A full listing of government and school LEED initiatives can be found online and is updated regularly. Some areas have implemented or are considering incentives for LEED-certified buildings. The city of Cincinnati, Ohio adopted a measure providing an automatic 100% real property tax exemption of the assessed property value for newly constructed or rehabilitated commercial or residential properties that earn a minimum of LEED Certified. In the state of Nevada, construction materials for a qualifying LEED building are exempt from local taxes. Pieces of construction that are deemed \\"inseparable\\" parts, such as concrete or drywall, qualify. The state of Maryland passed its High Performance Buildings Act in 2008, requiring all new public construction and renovation of buildings greater than 7,500 square feet to meet at least the LEED Silver standard, or two Green Globes. Between 2009 and 2014, the state is required to fund half of the required additional cost for public school construction or renovation to attain that standard. The state of Michigan is considering tax-based incentives for LEED buildings. Many local governments have adopted LEED incentive programs. Program incentives include tax credits, tax breaks, density bonuses, reduced fees, priority or expedited permitting, free or reduced-cost technical assistance, grants and low-interest loans. In June 2013, the USGBC announced a program called LEED Earth that refunds LEED certification fees to the first LEED-certified project in the countries that so far lack one. Notable LEED buildings Sota Construction Corporate Headquarters in Pittsburgh earned LEED Platinum in 2012.The Philip Merrill Environmental Center is recognized as one of the \\"greenest\\" buildings ever constructed in the United States at the time when it was built. Sustainability issues ranging from energy use to material selection were given serious consideration throughout design and construction of this facility. It was the first building to receive a Platinum rating through the U.S. Green Building Council's LEED Rating System, version 1.0. When it opened in 2003, Pittsburgh's David L. Lawrence Convention Center was the first Gold LEED-certified convention center and largest \\"green\\" building in the world. The convention center subsequently earned Platinum certification in 2012, becoming the only convention center in the world with certifications for both the original building and new construction. In October 2011 Apogee Stadium on the campus of the University of North Texas became the first newly built stadium in the country to achieve Platinum-level certification. In Pittsburgh, Phipps Conservatory & Botanical Gardens visitors center has received a Silver certification, its Center for Sustainable Landscapes has received a Platinum certification along with fulfilling the Living Building Challenge for net-zero energy, and its greenhouse production facility has received Platinum certification, the first and only greenhouse so certified. First Green Bank opened its LEED Platinum headquarters in Mount Dora, Florida on November 14, 2011. Also in Pittsburgh, Sota Construction Services completed construction on its new 7,500 sq. ft. corporate headquarters, which features a super-efficient thermal envelope using cob walls, along with other energy-saving features like a geothermal well, radiant heat flooring, roof-mounted solar panel array, and daylighting features. It earned a LEED Platinum rating in 2012 and received one of the highest scores by percentage of total points earned in any LEED category, making it the \\"greenest\\" building in Pennsylvania and in the top ten greenest in the world. Around 2009‚Äì2010, the Empire State Building was undergoing a $550 million renovation, with $120 million spent in an effort to transform the building into a more energy efficient and eco-friendly structure. Receiving a gold LEED rating in September 2011, the Empire State Building was at the time the tallest LEED-certified building in the United States. The Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens Bosarge Family Education Center completed in 2011 achieved LEED Platinum certification and has become known as Maine's \\"greenest building.\\" In May 2012, Soldier Field in Chicago became the first National Football League stadium certified LEED. In 2013, naked Stables Resort in Moganshan, ChinaMount Mogan became the first LEED Platinum certified resort of its size in Asia. In July 2014, the San Francisco 49ers' Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California became the first venue in the United States to earn a LEED Gold certification, setting the bar and expectations for future NFL stadiums. The Minnesota Vikings look to match and exceed the expectations set by the 49ers when they open U.S. Bank Stadium in 2016. The Cashman Equipment building is the first construction equipment dealership to receive LEED certification. It is the largest LEED industrial complex in Nevada. Caterpillar corporate has rewritten their development guidelines for new facilities based on this building. The Letterman Digital Arts Center in San Francisco's Presidio, the headquarters for various Lucasfilm companies, including visual effects house Industrial Light and Magic, earned a Gold certification. It was built almost entirely from the recycled remains of the building it replaced, the Letterman Army Hospital. The Cuyahoga County Public Library system is building newer branches so that they could be LEED Certified. In the construction of the Garfield Heights, Ohio new branch, the library used green materials, the lighting of Garfield Heights Branch lightens or dims when there is ample daylight. The glass windows have light sensors that work with lights inside the library. Also, the library uses a raised floor and has recyclable carpet tiles. Opening in September 2012, Siemens' The Crystal became the world's first building awarded LEED Platinum and BREEAM Outstanding status. Generating its own energy, using solar power and ground source heat pumps, no fossil fuels are burnt within the building. Its extensive use of KNX technologies to automate the building's environmental controls has set the benchmark for sustainable buildings. When it received LEED Platinum in 2012, Manitoba Hydro Place in downtown Winnipeg, Manitoba was the most energy efficient office tower in North America and the only office tower in Canada to receive the Platinum rating. The office tower employs south facing winter gardens to capture the maximum amount of solar energy during the harsh Manitoba winters, and uses glass extensively to maximise natural light. \\"Torre Sul\\" of \\"Green Tower Brasilias\\" received LEED Gold certification in 2014. In the public retail area on the first floor, visitors can see the largest green wall in Latin America, which is 197 feet (about 60 meters) high. In its 2017 environmental responsibility report, Apple claims its Apple Park campus will become the largest LEED Platinum building in North America when it opens in May 2017.Apple Environmental Responsibility Report 2017 It is said that the entire complex runs on 100% renewable energy (solar power and fuel cells), the air conditioning will run 70% of the year without consuming energy by using the natural air flow, and 80% of the area is open space with over 9000 drought resistant trees. Criticism In 2005, Auden Schendler and Randy Udall, respectively a LEED-accredited professional who is the director of environmental affairs at the Aspen Skiing Company and a Colorado-based environmentalist, published an article titled \\"LEED is Broken; Let's Fix It\\", in which they criticized numerous aspects of the LEED certification process, which they characterized as \\"costly, slow, brutal, confusing, and unwieldy ... that makes green building more difficult than it needs to be...\\"Schendler and Udall quoted in Owen, p.224 Schendler and Udall also identify an environmentalist fallacy which they call \\"LEED brain\\", in which the public relations value of LEED certification begins to drive the development of buildings.Schendler and Udall quoted in Owen, p. 230 Writer David Owen, in his book Green Metropolis, gives as an example of \\"LEED brain\\" the building by Gap Inc. of a green showcase building in San Bruno, California that, in itself, was a paradigm of environmentally-friendliness, but by its location, 16 miles from the company's corporate headquarters in downtown San Francisco, and 15 miles from Gap's corporate campus in Mission Bay, was actually harmful to the environment by forcing Gap employees to drive more miles, and the addition of shuttle buses between the various buildings. Owen points out that \\"no bus is as green as an elevator.\\"Owen, pp.232-33. In his book Walkable City, city planner Jeff Speck provides another example of \\"LEED brain\\": the federal Environmental Protection Agency relocated its Region 7 Headquarters from downtown Kansas City, Missouri, to a LEED-certified building 20 miles away in the suburb of Lenexa, Kansas, causing many of the agency's 627 employees to drive additional miles to and from work. Kaid Benfield of the Natural Resources Defense Council estimated that the carbon emissions associated with the additional miles driven were almost three times higher than before, a change from 0.39 metric tons per person per month to 1.08 metric tons of carbon dioxide per person per month. Speck writes that \\"The carbon saved by the new building's LEED status, if any, will be a small fraction of the carbon wasted by its location.\\"Speck, Jeff (2012) Walkable City: How Downtown Can Save America, One Step at a Time New York: North Point Press. pp.55-59. Both Speck and Owen make the point that a building-centric standard such as LEED, which doesn't sufficiently account for the location in which the building stands, will inevitably undervalue the strong positive effect of people living together in cities, which are inherently environmentally efficient, especially when compared to the automobile-oriented sprawl.Owen, pp.221-35.

NY 55 was split into NY 17A and NY 210 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. Initially, only NY 210 continued east from Greenwood Lake to Southfields; however, NY 17A was extended to Southfields by 1933, overlapping NY 210\\\\. The overlap was eliminated in 1982 when NY 210 was truncated to Greenwood Lake. Route description NY 17A at its northern terminus at exit 124 in Goshen NY 17A begins just south of NY 17 exit 124 in the village of Goshen. At the traffic light with the southern on-ramp from NY 17 eastbound, NY 207 becomes NY 17A. The route quickly climbs to some of the hillier areas south of Goshen, offering views of not only Orange County's Black Dirt Region but Pochuck Mountain and High Point to the south in New Jersey. It then slowly descends past rolling meadows and farmland until it reaches the small village of Florida, where NY 94 comes in from the west shortly after the village border. The concurrent roads then become Florida's main street. NY 17A and NY 94 heading through the stretch between Warwick and Florida Once out of the village, NY 17A and NY 94 begin to climb again, this time offering some panoramic views to the north, all the way to the Shawangunk Ridge and even the Catskill Mountains beyond them in clear enough weather. The road is surprisingly little developed in this area, with only one gas station between Florida and Warwick, its next stop, which likewise presents itself after a descent. Again, NY 17A and NY 94 serve as the bustling village's main street, longer this time and with many upscale boutiques in evidence. Many historic buildings line the road through Warwick. Near the southern end of the village, the two roads split, with NY 94 continuing toward New Jersey while NY 17A goes eastward. The road begins to climb again over the next few miles, passing a county park and finally the small Mount Peter ski area before crossing the Appalachian Trail along the ridgecrest of Bellvale Mountain. From here it once again drops down and bends in a north-south direction to reach Greenwood Lake, where NY 210 leaves to go along the side of the lake to the state line. NY 17A ends here at NY 17 in Southfields Leaving Greenwood Lake, NY 17A climbs once again to cross another ridge before descending and expanding to a four-lane with median strip to pass through Sterling Forest and reach its eastern terminus at NY 17 in Southfields. The highway formerly continued as County Route 106 (CR 106) in Orange and Rockland counties east to that route's eastern terminus at U.S. Route 9W (US 9W) and US 202 in Stony Point. CR 106 was once part of NY 210 before it was truncated to NY 17A in Greenwood Lake. History East of Bellvale, NY 17A follows the course of the Bellvale Turnpike, chartered 1810 to run from Bellvale to the Orange Turnpike. This road was still called the Monroe Turnpike by at late as the 1870s. NY 17A has bypassed most of this turnpike. In the late 1920s, what is now NY 17A from Greenwood Lake to Goshen was designated as part of NY 55, a connector between NY 17 in Goshen and the New Jersey state line. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY 55 was incorporated into two longer routes: NY 210 from New Jersey to Greenwood Lake and NY 17A from Greenwood Lake to Goshen.Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book, 1930‚Äì31 and 1931‚Äì32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931). The 1930‚Äì31 edition shows New York state routes prior to the 1930 renumbering The modern routing of NY 17A between Greenfield Lake and Southfields was originally only part of NY 210, which continued past NY 17 and into Rockland County. NY 17A was extended east to Southfields by 1933, completing the alternate loop of NY 17 and creating an overlap with NY 210. In 1980, ownership and maintenance of NY 210 between NY 210 and the Rockland County line was transferred from the state of New York to Orange County. Two years later, all of NY 210 in Rockland County was given to the county. NY 210 was truncated to its current northern terminus in Greenwood Lake following the latter swap, eliminating the overlap with NY 17A.

Sengier is credited with giving the American government access to much of the uranium necessary for the Manhattan Project, much of which was already stored in a Staten Island warehouse due to his foresight to stockpile the ore to prevent it from falling into a possible enemy's hands. For his actions he became the first non-American civilian to be awarded the Medal for Merit by the United States government.  Early life  Born in Kortrijk, Sengier graduated in 1903 as a mining engineer from the University of Leuven and joined the Union Mini√®re du Haut Katanga (UMHK) in 1911 as it was beginning to exploit copper mines in Katanga Province in the Belgian Congo. The UMHK was owned jointly by the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale de Belgique, a Belgian investment company, and the government of the Belgian Congo.  World War II  In May 1939, Sengier, then director of both the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale and the UMHK, learned about the potential of uranium from English chemist Sir Henry Tizard, who warned him that he held \\"something which may mean a catastrophe to your country and mine if this material were to fall into the hands of a possible enemy.\\" Shortly thereafter, he was approached by a group of French scientists led by Fr√©d√©ric Joliot-Curie, who asked whether Sengier would be willing to participate in their efforts to create a uranium fusion bomb. Although he agreed to provide the necessary ore, the project foundered when France was invaded by Germany. Sengier understood that uranium, a by-product that had until then been stored without being used, could become a crucial resource in times of war. Uranium was discovered in Shinkolobwe as early as 1915, and extraction began in 1921. Uranium ore from Shinkolobwe was very rich (it contained up to 65% of uranium); in comparison, Canadian ore contained only 0.02%. In September 1940, Sengier ordered that half of the uranium stock available in Africa‚Äîabout 1,050 tons‚Äîbe secretly dispatched to New York. At the start of the war, Sengier himself traveled to New York to conduct Union Mini√®re worldwide operations from there. At first, the UMHK's uranium stockpile remained in a Staten Island warehouse. = Manhattan Project = Kenneth Nichols in 1945 In September 1942, Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Nichols met Sengier in his New York office. Nichols had been ordered to find uranium by the head of the Manhattan Project, General Leslie Groves. He asked if the Union Mini√®re could supply uranium ore, and Sengier's answer became history: \\"You can have the ore now. It is in New York, a thousand tons of it. I was waiting for your visit.\\" Nichols had heard of the ore from the State Department and Louis Rosen, but was surprised at the amount: 1,200 tons, of which 100 tons was to go to Canada immediately for refining by Eldorado Mining and Refining in Port Hope, Ontario. Nichols and Sengier negotiated a contract, and the Staten Island stockpile was transferred to the United States Army. Since Tizard had informed him about uranium's potential a couple of years earlier, Sengier had a pretty good idea why Nichols had shown up to inquire about his ore deposits, something Nichols elaborated on during a 1965 Voices of the Manhattan Project interview by the journalist Stephane Groueff: In his book 1962 book about the Manhattan Project, Now It Can Be Told, Groves wrote that \\"as a Belgian, Sengier appreciated fully the absolute necessity of an Allied victory.\\" Nichols, when questioned about Sengier's motives, stated: The Shinkolobwe mine had been closed since 1937, and had fallen into disrepair and flooded. The Army sent a squad from its Corps of Engineers to restore the mine, expand the aerodromes in L√©opoldville and Elisabethville, and build a port in Matadi, on the Congo River. The army also secured the remaining ore (3000 tons) in Shinkolobwe, which was shipped to the United States. In his 1987 book, The Road to Trinity, Nichols wrote: The agreement between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Belgium lasted 10 years and continued after the war. The uranium agreements in part explain Belgium's relative ease in rebuilding its economy after the war, as the country had no debt with the major financial powers.  Personal life  Sengier was described by author John Gunther in his book Inside Africa as \\"a tallish man, somewhat portly, with pale skin, white hands, a fringe of shinily white hair, and a short silver mustache clipped with sharp neatness\\", further stating that he \\"conveys that pleasant sense of benevolence which comes to an extremely successful man of affairs, after his major work is done.\\" Nichols described meeting Sengier for the first time in 1942: \\"At that time he was in his sixties, and he always impressed me as very white. Sort of a plump man and very sparse hair\\" and \\"a very pale face\\", and that he was \\"a very abrupt guy\\", but \\"just as polite.\\" Edgar Sengier remained director of the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale and the Union Mini√®re until 1949. He remained on the company's administrative board until 1960, before retiring in Cannes, where he died in 1963.  Recognition  Sengier receiving the Medal for Merit, 1946 In 1946, Sengier returned to the United States and was awarded the Medal for Merit for his contribution to the Allied victory by General Groves at a private ceremony in his Washington office, receiving the distinction of becoming the first non-American civilian to be awarded the medal. Due to restrictions on wartime information at the time, the initial citation merely mentioned his \\"services in supplying material\\". However, the official statement made note of Sengier's \\"sound judgment, initiative, resourcefulness and unfailing cooperation\\" which \\"contributed greatly to the success of the atomic bomb project\\". Groves noted: Despite official recognition, Sengier was content to remain unknown and successfully went to considerable lengths to preserve his anonymity. According to John Gunther \\"probably not one American in a hundred thousand has ever heard the name Edgar Sengier, nor is he well known in Europe outside of a limited circle. So far as I know, no photograph of him has ever appeared in an American newspaper or magazine of wide circulation ...\\" Sengierite, a radioactive mineral discovered in Congo in 1948 was named in his honor. = Awards and decorations = Sengier received numerous awards for his accomplishments. ; Belgium : Commander of the Order of the Crown : Grand Officer of the Royal Order of the Lion : Officer of the Order of Leopold : Officer of the Order of the African Star : Silver Medal of Belgian Gratitude ; France : Commander of the Order of the Legion of Honour : Medal of French Gratitude ; Luxembourg : Commander of the Order of the Oak Crown ; Romania : Commander of the Order of the Star of Romania ; Sweden : Commander of the Royal Order of Vasa ; United Kingdom : Honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire ; United States : Medal for Merit  See also  * Belgian Congo in World War II * Manhattan Project  References  = Footnotes = = Bibliography =    Category:20th-century Belgian businesspeople Category:20th-century Belgian engineers Category:1879 births Category:1963 deaths Category:Belgian Congo people Category:Belgian mining engineers Category:Belgian people of World War II Category:Catholic University of Leuven (1834‚Äì1968) alumni Category:Commandeurs of the L√©gion d'honneur Category:Honorary Knights Commander of the Order of the British Empire Category:Manhattan Project people Category:Medal for Merit recipients Category:Officers of the Order of the Crown (Belgium) Category:People from Kortrijk Category:Royal Order of the Lion recipients Category:Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale de Belgique ","title":"Edgar Sengier"},{"id":"3923274","text":"Augustine Henry Shepperd (February 24, 1792 ‚Äì July 11, 1864) was a Congressional Representative from North Carolina; born in Rockford, North Carolina, February 24, 1792; completed preparatory studies; studied law; was admitted to the bar and commenced practice in Surry County, North Carolina; member of the State house of representatives 1822‚Äì1826; elected to the Twentieth through Twenty-third Congresses and elected as a Whig to the Twenty- fourth and Twenty-fifth Congresses (March 4, 1827 ‚Äì March 3, 1839); chairman, Committee on Expenditures in the Department of the Navy (Twenty-first Congress), Committee on Expenditures in the Department of War (Twenty-second Congress), Committee on Expenditures in the Department of State (Twenty-third and Twenty-fourth Congresses); unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1838 to the Twenty-sixth Congress; elected as a Whig to the Twenty-seventh Congress (March 4, 1841 ‚Äì March 3, 1843); chairman, Committee on Public Expenditures (Twenty-seventh Congress); elected as a Whig to the Thirtieth and Thirty-first Congresses (March 4, 1847 ‚Äì March 3, 1851); declined to be a candidate for reelection in 1850; resumed the practice of his profession; died at \\"Good Spring,\\" Salem, North Carolina, July 11, 1864; interment in Salem Cemetery.

At a time when the theatre in London was seen as a disreputable place, the German Reed family provided family-friendly entertainments for forty years, showing that respectable theatre could be popular. The entertainments were held at the intimate Royal Gallery of Illustration, Lower Regent Street, and later at St. George's Hall, Langham Place, in London. Thomas and Priscilla German Reed usually appeared in them, together with a small group of players. They engaged talented newcomers, such as Frederic Clay, W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Law, as well as established writers like F. C. Burnand, to create many of the entertainments. Thomas German Reed composed the music for many of the entertainments himself. The German Reed theatrical revolution This form of entertainment consisted of musical plays \\"of a refined nature\\". During the early Victorian era, visiting the theatre was considered distasteful to the respectable public. Shakespeare and classic British plays were presented, but the London stage became dominated by risque farces, burlesques and bad adaptations of French operettas. Jessie Bond wrote, The German Reed Entertainments became the first respectable venue for dramatic amusement to which the public could safely bring their children, presenting gentle, intelligent, comic musical entertainment. Their example showed that respectable theatre could be popular and encouraged successors such as Gilbert and Sullivan. Forty years of entertainments =Early years= Priscilla and Thomas German Reed In 1855, the first performance of \\"Miss P. Horton's Illustrative Gatherings,\\" took place at St. Martin's Hall, with Thomas playing the piano. Mrs. Reed had been a popular performer of operetta, Shakespeare and other theatre pieces since the 1830s. The Reeds' entertainments consisted, at first, of character sketches and songs by the Reeds.Adams, p. 573 In 1856, the entertainments moved to the more intimate Gallery of Illustration. These eventually became \\"Mr. and Mrs. German Reeds Entertainments\\". They called the establishment, euphemistically, the \\"Gallery of Illustration,\\" rather than a theatre, the actors were \\"entertainers\\", and the pieces were called \\"entertainments\\" or \\"illustrations\\", eschewing the words \\"play\\", \\"extravaganza\\", \\"melodrama\\" or \\"burlesque\\". Reed himself composed the music for many of these pieces and often appeared in them, along with Mrs. German Reed. There was nothing else like this establishment in London, and the Gallery rapidly achieved popularity.\\"Obituary: Thomas German Reed\\", The Times, 26 March 1888, p. 9Woodbridge Wilson, Frederic. \\"Reed, Thomas German\\", Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press, accessed 31 January 2013 The Gallery was an intimate 500-seat theatre. The accompaniment consisted of piano at first, and later also a harmonium and sometimes a harp. At first, the entertainments utilized a cast of three; but by the mid-1860s, they had expanded to pieces with a cast of four. Often the pieces' plots involved mistaken identities and disguises. From 1860 to 1868, the German Reeds were assisted by John Orlando Parry, a pianist, mimic, parodist and humorous singer (one of George Grossmith's inspirations).The Times obituary of George Grossmith, 2 March 1912 He created a new type of musical and dramatic monologue that became popular. The earliest entertainments included Holly Lodge and The Enraged Musicians (1855); William Brough's A Month from Home and My Unfinished Opera (1857); The Pyramid by Shirley Brooks (1864); The Peculiar Family by Brough (1865); The Yachting Cruise by F. C. Burnand (1866); Our Quiet Chateau by Robert Reece (1867); and Inquire Within by Burnand (1868). As time went on, the Reeds added a dramatic pieces and brief comic operas designed for a small number of characters. Reed experimented with what he called opera di camera - small chamber operas by young composers. The German Reeds were able to attract fine young composers such as Molloy, Frederic Clay, Arthur Sullivan, Charles King Hall.Charles King Hall was a British composer and organist who supplied the music for The Happy Bungalow in 1877 and Missing in 1894, among others. and Alfred Cellier, the best scenic designers for their tiny stage, and the best young writers from Punch and Fun magazines. =Later years= Gilbert's last German Reed Entertainment, 1875 The dramatist W. S. Gilbert wrote the librettos for six entertainments presented by the German Reeds from 1869 to 1875, some of them with music by Reed himself, including No Cards, Ages Ago, Our Island Home, A Sensation Novel, Happy Arcadia, and Eyes and No Eyes. Several of these pieces had ideas in embryonic form that would later re-appear in the Savoy Operas. Ages Ago, for instance, had a gallery of portraits that come to life, an idea re-used in Ruddigore. Mrs. German Reed's performances inspired Gilbert to create some of his famous contralto roles. German Reed also mounted the first professional production of Arthur Sullivan and F. C. Burnand's Cox and Box and commissioned a second opera from the pair, The Contrabandista. Given the German Reeds' role in both Gilbert's and Sullivan's first operatic successes, one wag commented that the Gilbert and Sullivan operas were \\"cradled among the Reeds.\\"Smith, J. Donald. \\"W. S. Gilbert's Operas for the German Reeds\\", Gilbert and Sullivan Discography, 7 November 2001, accessed 7 February 2017 Arthur Cecil joined the German Reeds in No Cards in 1869, remaining for five years. Fanny Holland first performed at the Gallery in 1869 in Ages Ago and appeared in scores of the entertainments continuously until 1895, except for two years at other theatres.Stone, David. Holland (1879‚Äì80)\\", Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, 25 October 2002, accessed 7 February 2017 In 1870, Richard Corney Grain, a clever, refined, and humorous society entertainer (a great friend and rival of Grossmith's), appeared in his first Gallery entertainment, Our Island Home, soon performing his own sketches, taking over where Parry had left off. He also remained with the German Reeds until 1895 Corney Grain and Alfred Reed both died in 1895 Other German Reed entertainments included Our Quiet Chateau (1868) by Reece with music by Virginia Gabriel; Inquire Within (1868, Parry's last entertainment); Beggar My Neighbour (1870) and Number 204, by Burnand; Near Relations (1871) by Arthur Sketchley; King Christmas (1871, the first appearance by the German Reeds' son, Alfred); Charity Begins at Home (1872), with music by Alfred Cellier and words by B. C.

Wye. After the retirement of Thomas, in 1871 his son Alfred German Reed (1846-1895), also an actor, carried on the business in partnership with his mother and then with Grain. In 1874 they moved the entertainments to the St. George's Hall, Regent Street, and the German Reeds also took the entertainments on provincial tours. In 1874, Leonora Braham (who created several of the soprano heroine roles in the Savoy Operas in the 1880s) joined the German Reeds. Fanny Holland's husband Arthur Law also joined the company and wrote, as well as acted in, many of the entertainments.

It is owned by the Southern Illinois and Missouri Bridge Company, now a Union Pacific subsidiary. History The Southern Illinois and Missouri Bridge Company was incorporated in Illinois on December 28, 1900 to own the bridge and of connecting rail line. It was initially owned equally by the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad, Illinois Central Railroad, Missouri Pacific Railway, St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway, and St. Louis Southwestern Railway. Following approval of the bridge plans in 1902, limited construction activities began that year. Following litigation over right of way that prevented certain work from proceeding from May 1902 to April 1903, construction continued with the concrete arch approach structures in 1903, and the bridge superstructure itself in 1904. The legal issues \\"delayed considerably\\" the completion of the Missouri approach work, one of the main river piers, and led to an increased expense in constructing the superstructure. The bridge was dedicated in May of 1905. The designer of the bridge was Polish-American engineer Ralph Modjeski.Glomb, Jozef; Peter J. Obst (Translator) (2002) (in English). A man who spanned two eras: The story of bridge engineer Ralph Modjeski. Philadelphia: Kosciuszko Foundation. . Contractors included C. Macdonald & Co. of New York, J.S.

Colquhoun was The Boy Scouts Association Headquarters Commissioner for Wolf Cubs from 1927 to 1938 and Akela Leader (head trainer of Wolf Cub leaders), Gilwell Park. At The Boy Scouts Association's Bournemouth Conference of April 1927, Colquhoun presented a paper titled 'The position of Rover leaders' which resulted in discussion on co-ordination (i.e. who was in charge) between Wolf Cubmasters, Scoutmasters and Rover leaders that led to the establishment of the Scout Group organizational structure and new rank of Group Scoutmaster from 1 January 1928. As Headquarters Commissioner for Wolf Cubs, Colquhoun organized the first International Wolf Cub Conference at Gilwell Park in 1938. In the leadership changes following the death of The Boy Scouts Association's founder and first Chief Scout, Robert Baden-Powell, Colquhoun became Deputy Chief Commissioner in January 1942 and, in 1943, Chairman of the General Purposes Committee, the main sub-committee of the Executive Committee. In 1948 Colquhoun also became The Boy Scouts Association Headquarters Commissioner for Kindred Societies (later Headquarters Commissioner for Relationships). He and Fred Hurll, Chief Executive Commissioner of The Boy Scouts Association, were the organizers of the 1st World Scout Indaba (a gathering of Scout Leaders from around the world) which took place at Gilwell Park for a week in July, 1952. Colquhoun toured Australia and New Zealand in 1950 and 1951 to inspect The Boy Scouts Association's branches. He represented The Boy Scouts Association Imperial Headquarters and its Chief Scout of the British Commonwealth and Empire at the Second Pan-Pacific Jamboree held at Greystanes near Sydney, Australia from 29 December 1952 to 8 January 1953.

The western terminus is at the New York-New Jersey state line, where it continues as New Jersey's Route 94 for another to Columbia, New Jersey. Its eastern terminus is located at U.S. Route 9W (US 9W) in New Windsor. From Warwick to Florida, NY 94 is concurrent with NY 17A. The entirety of NY 94 is known as the 94th Infantry Division Memorial Highway. NY 94 was originally designated as NY 45 in 1930. It was renumbered to NY 94 on January 1, 1949. The portion of the route between Warwick and Florida was part of NY 55 during the late 1920s. Route description NY 94 begins at the New Jersey-New York state line in the town of Warwick as a continuation of Route 94\\\\. NY 94 proceeds northeast through a rural section of Warwick, soon crossing into a residential neighborhood after crossing the Double Kill. Paralleling the Wayawanda Creek, the route enters the hamlet of New Milford, where it junctions with the northern terminus of County Route 21 (CR 21 or Warwick Turnpike), which connects to New Jersey and Upper Greenwood Lake. NY 94 continues northeast out of New Milford and crosses a junction with CR 1A Just north of the junction, the route enters the village of Warwick and intersects with NY 17A (Galloway Road) in front of the Warwick Valley Country Club. NY 94 northbound at NY 17A in the village of Warwick NY 94 and NY 17A proceed north through Warwick as a two-lane residential street known as Oakland Avenue, crossing tracks currently used by the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway in the center of the village. North of the junction with Grand Street, NY 94 and NY 17A cross the St. Anthony Community Hospital, and leave the village of Warwick. Now outside of the village, the routes continue north as a two-lane residential road, winding south of Glenemere Lake and gaining the moniker of Seward Highway. Shortly after gaining the moniker, NY 94 and NY 17A cross into the village of Florida and changes to South Main Street. Through Florida, NY 94 and NY 17A remain a residential village street, reaching the center of the village near Bridge Street. Paralleling the former right-of-way of the Erie Railroad's Pine Island Branch, NY 94 and NY 17A reach a junction with Meadow Road, where NY 17A continues north on North Main Street and NY 94 turns northeast on Randall Street. Leaving the village of Florida (and the town of Warwick), NY 94 enters the town of Goshen, crossing through the hamlet of Randelville, paralleling Quaker Creek from a distance to the north. Winding eastward out of Randelville, NY 94 crosses into the town of Chester, gaining the moniker of Summerville Way. The two-lane road becomes a mix of rural and residential, soon reaching the village of Chester. After a turn at West Avenue, NY 94 bends into exit 126 of NY 17 and US 6 (the Quickway). After crossing the diamond interchange with the Quickway, NY 94 crosses a junction with NY 17M (Brookside Avenue). Darting east for two blocks on Academy Avenue, NY 94 turns north at Main Street and crosses through a residential section of the village. Turning into High Street, NY 94 crosses over the abandoned alignment of the Erie Railroad main line, bypassing the commercial center of the village. After passing numerous residences through the village, NY 94 soon leaves the village of Chester before crossing the Chester-Blooming Grove town line into latter town about less than a mile from the village of Chester. Turning northeast, the route crosses over Cromline Creek and reaches a junction with CR 51 (Craigville Road). NY 94 west of the village of Washingtonville in Blooming Grove Crossing northeast through the town of Blooming Grove, NY 94 parallels Saatterly Creek and the abandoned alignment of the Erie Railroad's Newburgh Branch through the hamlet of Blooming Grove. Remaining a residential roadway, the route turns north and crosses over Moodna Creek into the village of Washingtonville. Crossing over the abandoned branch, NY 94 gains the moniker of West Main Street and passes Washingtonville High School. At the junction with South Street, NY 94 reaches a junction with NY 208 (Goshen Avenue). NY 94 now turns east along East Main, remaining a two-lane residential street through Washingtonville along Moodna Creek. Turning northeast near Locust Street, the route soon leaves Washingtonville, dropping the East Main Street moniker. Continuing east out of Washingtonville, NY 94 almost immediately enters the hamlet of Salisbury Mills, crossing a junction with CR 20 (Orrs Mills Road). Remaining a two-lane residential street through Salisbury Mills, NY 94 passes south of Beaver Dam Lake and soon into the town of Cornwall. Just east of an old alignment of NY 94, the route passes the entrance to the Salisbury Mills-Cornwall Metro-North Railroad station. Crossing under the Port Jervis Line and northern end of the Moodna Viaduct, the route winds northeast through the rural parts of Cornwall. The route begins to become a more residential road as it enters the hamlet of Vails Gate. Passing north of Cornwall Central High School, NY 94 soon crosses under the New York State Thruway (I-87) and enters the town of New Windsor. Through New Windsor, NY 94 crosses into the center of Vails Gate, reaching a junction with NY 32 (Windsor Highway) and NY 300 (Temple Hill Road). East of the junction, NY 94 continues through New Windsor as Blooming Grove Turnpike. The route passes through multiple housing developments until reaching a junction with Quassaick Avenue in New Windsor. Here, NY 94 turns north onto the Quassaick, a two-lane residential street, passing east of Woodlawn Cemetery near the junction with CR 69 (Union Avenue). Continuing north through New Windsor, NY 94 reaches a junction with US 9W, where the NY 94 designation terminates and US 9W gains the Quassaick Avenue moniker. History The segment of modern NY 94 between Warwick and Florida was originally designated as part of NY 55 in the late 1920s. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY 55 was renumbered to NY 17A west of Greenwood Lake. The Warwick‚ÄìFlorida portion of the route also became part of NY 45, a new route extending from the New Jersey state line to Vails Gate via Warwick, Florida, and Washingtonville. At Vails Gate (NY 32), the road changed designations to NY 307 and continued northeast to Newburgh. NY 307 became part of an extended NY 45 by the following year. In the early 1940s, NY 94 was assigned to Chestnut Ridge Road and Main Street in Rockland County. The NY 45 and NY 94 designations were swapped on January 1, 1949, placing both routes on their modern alignments. Both NY 94 and most of New Jersey's Route 94 have been dedicated in honor of the 94th Infantry Division from World War II. In New York, the road is known as the \\"94th Infantry Division Memorial Highway\\"; in New Jersey, it is named the \\"W.W. II 94th Infantry Division Highway\\".

Argots in The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe It combined Yiddish with loanwords from many other European languages. This borrowed vocabulary was often substituted for key Yiddish words using rhyme or some other form of association. Many of the words were not derived from either Yiddish or Slavic languages, but original coinages. As with other argots, such as thieves' languages, Klezmer-loshn evolved to fill the need of members of a bounded community to speak in the presence of others without being understood. Klezmorim could speak Klezmer-loshn during and after performances, whether among Gentiles or Yiddish-speaking Jews, without being understood. This allowed them to discuss business, plan, and even mock others without getting into trouble. Its active use gradually dwindled in the 20th century, and disappeared along with the klezmer trade in Eastern Europe, especially after the Holocaust obliterated much of the Jewish population there.

Prior to its destruction, it was documented for the Library of Congress Historic American Engineering Record Survey number HAER MO-84. The bridge is named after Bill Emerson, a Missouri politician who served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1981 until his death in 1996. Planning for the four-lane structure began in June 1987, and construction began in late 1996. Several factors have been blamed for the bridge's many delays in planning and construction, including Illinois' reluctance to participate in the project, as well as issues with the bedrock of the river (this resulted in the hiring of a new contractor).

They first appeared in Green Lantern #176 (May 1984) and were created by Len Wein and Dave Gibbons. Fictional character history In their initial appearance, the Demolition Team were hired by Congressman Jason Bloch to destroy the Los Angeles branch of Ferris Aircraft. The Ferris employees were virtually defenseless against the team and their state-of-the-art weaponry provided by the Monitor. Help finally arrived in the form of the mysterious Predator who defeated the entire team unaided. It is assumed the Demolition Team were sent to prison soon after the incident. The Demolition Team returned several years later with updated technology only to be handily defeated by the Blood Pack after attacking a nuclear power plant in Germany. Hardhat later appeared committing crimes in Opal City. Rosie, together with several other scientific geniuses and cybernetic beings (Automan, Brainstorm, Doctor Cyber, Ford, and Emil Hamilton), was for a brief period part of the composite cybernetic being known as Enginehead. However (if this story is still canon), the being seems to have been divided into the individual personalities again shortly after the events of the series Enginehead 1-6 (2004). Most of the team met their end at the hands of the OMACs during the events of The OMAC Project, but Hardhat was seen alive in Infinite Crisis #7. He is participating in the 'Battle of Metropolis', which was a supervillain first step to conquer the world. Still later, Hardhat was seen among the \\"forgotten characters\\" of Limbo.

It has grown from a small, Western Australia-based gas distributor and retailer to the largest energy infrastructure company in Australia. It was bought in 2007 by a consortium including Singapore Power and various parties which include the now defunct Babcock & Brown funds. Alinta Limited was known as Westnet Infrastructure Group Limited for a time. In March 2011, due to a deleveraging transaction by the TPG Group, Alinta became Alinta Energy. Alinta Energy was acquired by Hong Kong-based Chow Tai Fook Enterprises in 2017. The successor to the retail gas business is now called Alinta Energy.  History  In January 1995, the vertical monopolist energy supplier, the State Energy Commission of Western Australia, was dis-aggregated into separate gas and electricity corporations, leading to the formation of AlintaGas. (The word Alinta is derived from the word for flame in a traditional language of the Yorta Yorta nation from Victoria.)\\"Lunch with Lou Bennett\\" by Liza Power, The Sydney Morning Herald, 1 September 2012 On 13 July 2000 legislation was passed by the Parliament of Western Australia for the sale of AlintaGas, which listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) on 17 October 2000. On 8 May 2003 AlintaGas Ltd changed its name to Alinta Limited. On 23 July 2003 through a series of complicated transactions involving Alinta, Aquila Inc, United Energy, and AMP Henderson Global, Alinta became the operator, manager and part owner of regulated energy assets in Western Australia and Victoria. In April 2004 Alinta acquired Duke Energy International's assets in Australia and New Zealand. In October 2004 a DUET/Alinta/Alcoa Consortium acquired the Dampier to Bunbury Natural Gas Pipeline from Epic Energy. On 4 October 2005 Alinta publicly floated the pipelines and power stations it acquired from Duke Energy International into a separate investment vehicle, Alinta Infrastructure Holdings (AIH) which also traded on the ASX. In October 2006 Alinta, through Alinta IH Pty Ltd (Alinta IHPL), made an offer to buy out the 80% of the shareholding in AIH that it did not already own. By 11 January 2007 Alinta had acquired 91.4%, and moved to compulsorily acquire the remainder. Alinta acquired infrastructure assets and the Agility business from AGL through a combination of merger and demerger transactions on 25 October 2006. On 9 January 2007 Alinta announced that senior executives and the Chairman were working on a management buyout proposal, with Macquarie Bank as their advisor. As a result, the chief executive officer Bob Browning resigned on 11 January 2007, and the company was clearly for sale to the highest bidder. Alinta was acquired on 31 August 2007 by a consortium comprising Singapore Power International (SPI), the largest utility company in Singapore, and Australia's second-largest investment bank, Babcock & Brown Infrastructure (BBI) and Babcock & Brown Power (BBP) with a bid of A$13.9 billion, beating out a rival bid by Macquarie Bank. Alinta was delisted from the Australian Securities Exchange in September 2007. Alinta was split into the following businesses: * Alinta, retaining the Western Australian gas retail business. Alinta Limited for a time was known as Westnet Infrastructure Group Limited. In 2017, This business now trading as Alinta Energy was acquired by Hong Kong-based Chow Tai Fook Enterprises. * WestNet Energy, which provides asset management, operational, construction and maintenance services to the owners of the AlintaGas Networks gas distribution system in Western Australia; and to the owners of the Dampier to Bunbury Natural Gas Pipeline. It is also a major contractor in overhead and underground electricity cabling. * Alinta LGA, renamed to Jemena on 4 August 2008, which manages energy infrastructure assets in the eastern states of Australia including Queensland and New South Wales, and gas pipelines and gas and electricity distribution networks in Victoria. Later, ownership of Jemena passed to Singapore Power International, and its name was changed to SPI (Australia) Assets Pty Ltd. In 2014, State Grid Corporation of China acquired a 60% stake in Jemena, and the company's name was changed to SGSP (Australia) Assets Pty Ltd (SGSPAA). The company continues to trade as Jemena. Since the restructuring Alinta has continued to grow and diversify to become one of Australia's largest energy companies. Alinta has been a key investor in Australia's renewable energy projects and plans to build the world's largest offshore wind farm, a 50 MW solar thermal plant at Port Augusta in South Australia in 2013.

His active tennis career lasted from the 1950s to mid-1970s. Early years Scott was the grandson of Dr. Eugene C. Sullivan, one of the inventors of Pyrex and chair and president of Corning Glass Works. He graduated with a BA in history from Yale University in 1960, where he was a member of Skull and Bones and lettered in tennis, hockey, soccer, and lacrosse. He earned a law degree from the University of Virginia in 1964. Tennis career Gene Scott's highest U.S. ranking as an amateur was No. 4 in 1963, whilst he reached as high as World No. 11 in 1965. At the time he was a member of the United States Davis Cup team, and was both teammate and roommate of Arthur Ashe. They remained friends and, with Charlie Pasarell and Sheridan Snyder, founded the National Junior Tennis League in 1969. He founded the magazine Tennis Week in May 1974. Later in life Scott remained among the best players in the world in his age group. He won the USTA Men's 65 Clay Court Championships held at New Orleans Lawn Tennis Club in 2002. He won the USTA Men's 65 Grass Court Championships in September 2004, and the International Tennis Federation's Men's Super-Seniors World Individual Championships in the 65 division a week later. Scott also played real tennis at New York City's Racquet and Tennis Club. Scott grew up in St. James, NY, and played varsity hockey, track, soccer, and tennis at St. Mark's School in Southborough, Mass. At Yale, Scott earned letters in hockey, soccer, lacrosse, and tennis. Scott competed in the Davis Cup in 1963 and 1965, and his 1963 singles and doubles victories helped the United States win the Cup that year. Scott also made it to the semifinals of the U.S. Championships at Forest Hills in 1967 and the quarterfinals of the French Championships in 1964. In 1963 he won the singles title at the Eastern Grass Court Championships in South Orange after a straight sets victory in the final against compatriot Marty Riessen. Although Scott remained active as a court tennis player, which he played at The Racquet Club on Park Avenue, he became one of the major figures in American tennis through his publication Tennis Week which he founded, published and edited. His editorials‚Äîperceptive, authoritative and sometimes whimsical‚Äîwere considered a must read for all the game's insiders as well as a tennis public who became educated about the game as a result of reading them. He was an educator who took pride in nurturing young writers and was not afraid to criticize their work. He was also a mentor, on and off court, to the flamboyant young talent Vitas Gerulaitis who regularly turned to Gene for advice as he rose up the world rankings. Scott ran tournaments in New York and New Jersey for many years before taking over as tournament director of the ATP Masters at Madison Square Garden. In 1990, he was asked to start up the Kremlin Cup, a new ATP event in Moscow, with a remit to produce with one million dollars in sponsorship in nine months. With some assistance from the Kremlin itself, where Boris Yeltsin, a tennis fanatic, was busy installing himself as President of Russia, Scott came up with Bayer as his first title sponsor and the tournament, played inside the vast Olympic Arena, immediately drew some of the largest crowds on the ATP tour.

Coleos are usually presented as a side attraction to a larger event, such as a religious festival. They are very popular in Venezuela and in parts of Colombia, mostly in the plains (llanos). A coleo starts with the participants and a calf or bull (this depends on the age and stature of the competitors) locked behind a trap door. The trap door leads to a narrow earthen pathway about 100 metres long with high guard rails, open at the other end. When a judge gives a signal, the calf is set loose and starts running. A couple of seconds later, the riders are released and they race to grab the calf by its tail. The rider who accomplishes this first will increase speed, dragging the calf until it finally stumbles. The object is to accomplish this in the shortest time. Coleo can be a dangerous sport, and most of the participants are male. However coleos in which all the contestants are female are not uncommon. Accidents can happen, because the riders compete aggressively and ride at high speed with minimal bodily protection. Additionally, some spectators attend coleos sitting on top of the high guard rails, and the occasional excited or drunken spectator may fall or collide with the riders or the bull itself.

It moved to Commercial Road and opened there as the Royal Portsmouth, Portsea and Gosport Hospital in 1849. It became the Royal Portsmouth Hospital in 1866. In the late 19th century it contained a 'Lock Ward' for the treatment of prostitutes under the regulations governed by the Contagious Diseases Acts 1863‚Äì1886. If identified as a 'common prostitute' by the Metropolitan Water Police attached to the dockyard, women would be compulsorily examined and if found to be infected they would be detained until pronounced 'clean'. Refusal of examination could mean detention for up to nine months in the hospital. After services were transferred to the Queen Alexandra Hospital in Cosham, the Royal Portsmouth Hospital closed in 1979. The former hospital was demolished and the site developed by Sainsbury's, who now have a superstore there. This site is now part of the development known as the Northern Quarter.

The southern terminus is at an intersection with NY 17M in the Orange County village of Monroe. Its northern terminus is located at an intersection with NY 32 and NY 299 in the Ulster County village of New Paltz. NY 208 is a two-lane road for its entire length. While connecting two bustling villages and passing through three others, it is primarily a country road and offers a variety of scenery and points of interest, from fields and meadows to a riverside stretch and orchards devoted to apples. The northern third, between Wallkill and New Paltz, boasts a near-continuous view of the Shawangunk Ridge. Route description Round Hill Elementary School =Orange County= From its southern terminus at a busy traffic light in Monroe, NY 208 quickly crosses U.S. Route 6 (US 6) and NY 17 and then stays in the shade of the southwestern corner of Schunemunk Mountain as it heads north to Washingtonville, remaining relatively straight through mostly wooded, undeveloped country with some views of the mountain. Round Hill Elementary School heralds the approach of the village. Shortly after entering Washingtonville, it intersects with NY 94\\\\. NY 208 crosses the village line rather quickly, going through some sharp curves as it enters more open farmland. Here, the highway also deviates from its northward course, heading much more westward as it picks up the headwaters of Moodna Creek and passes its source, the confluence of Otter Kill and Cromline Creek. Shortly afterwards, it again turns northward at the Sarah Wells Trail junction. Eventually the land surrounding the highway once again becomes more wooded and it goes through a short tunnel under the railroad tracks shared by Norfolk Southern and Metro-North. About a mile past the tunnel, NY 208 abruptly reaches NY 207 outside the hamlet of Rock Tavern. The two routes overlap for a hundred yards as they pass small Brown's Pond and a weir, then NY 208 once again turns left to go north alongside the pond, into some more open countryside. It passes the west boundary of Stewart State Forest, goes over a little-used rail spur, once part of the Wallkill Valley Railroad (WVRR) and then enters Maybrook, which it serves as the main street. A feature of this town is the large Yellow Freight terminal in its north end, continuing a tradition of importance in transportation that began with the village's origins as a major regional rail hub. Caboose along NY 208 at Maybrook, celebrating the village's past importance as a rail hub Shortly after leaving Maybrook, NY 208 reaches Interstate 84 (I-84). This exit, the only one for several miles in either direction on the Interstate Highway, contains several businesses. Here, for the only point on its entire length, NY 208 swells beyond two lanes with the addition of turn lanes for the interstate's onramps. There is a heavy truck presence at the NY 208/I-84/CR 99 (Neelytown Road) interchange. Several companies have built warehouse facilities on CR 99, including Home Depot, Cardinal Health and Do It Best Corporation. Also found in this area is Federal Express Freight, Yellow Freight and several other national trucking firms. North of I-84, the road remains a two-lane until it intersects with NY 17K at Scotts Corners. This intersection was redesigned and upgraded in 2008 to accommodate left and right turn lanes. Statue of President William McKinley at junction of NY 52 and NY 208 in Walden Continuing north, NY 208 goes around some mild bends past woods and fields. Here the highway offers its first view to the Shawangunks. In 2 miles (3.2 km) it reaches Walden, the largest community on NY 208 after Monroe. After crossing the old WVRR main line, now the north end of a lightly used freight spur, it becomes Orange Avenue with a mix of residential and commercial properties. In the center of town NY 52 comes in from the east at an oblique angle more like a merger than a junction; traffic at rush hour there is made more difficult by vehicles attempting to cross 52 and enter the adjacent Hess station as well as a local one-way side street. Since NY 52 comes in at a slightly lower elevation, it has the right of way, guaranteed by the stop sign greeting drivers on NY 208. The two roads make an unsigned concurrency for about two blocks of East Main Street before a traffic light separates them; traffic on NY 208 turns right, on Ulster Avenue, to continue north. This takes the traveler past some of Walden's older homes and Most Precious Blood Catholic school before finally leaving the village at the Tin Brook bridge, whereupon it almost immediately bends westward at the Lake Osiris Road junction for a short distance, curving north again when it reaches the Wallkill River. =Ulster County= The mile of highway along the Wallkill is at first wooded and curvy but then offers many pleasant riverside scenes. A burned-out former Borden Cheese factory is the last highlight before crossing the county line. This section of the river is popular with local fishermen and there are many informal parking spots available (In winters when it is cold enough for the river to freeze over, snowmobile trails can be seen on the ice). A Ulster County sheriff's substation is the first in a string of buildings that indicate the road has reached the hamlet of Wallkill. The Catskill Aqueduct and NY 208 between Wallkill and Gardiner Immediately east of the hamlet's business district, at Wallkill Library it turns right onto Main Street and takes a more easterly course out of town, past some rolling fields and John G. Borden Middle School. At the only traffic light here, the northern terminus of NY 300, it regains its northward orientation, which it will keep for its final 11 miles (17.6 km) to New Paltz. While remaining two-lane, the roadway itself is a little wider here, encouraging drivers to accelerate as the woodlots surrounding them give way to the cornfields of Wallkill and Shawangunk state prisons and the panoramic view of the Shawangunk Ridge across the river valley that continues most of the way to New Paltz (Sometimes the summit of Slide Mountain, the Catskill Mountains' highest peak, is visible over the ridge). NY 208 in apple country As the drive continues, the Catskill Aqueduct crosses and recrosses the road several times and orchards become the primary agricultural use of the adjoining land. This is one of the state's prime apple-growing regions, and several local apple farmers sell fresh-pressed cider at their stands along the road in the fall. The only traffic light along this stretch is at Ireland Corners, the slightly developed intersection with US 44 and NY 55 just east of Gardiner. It marks the midway point between Wallkill and New Paltz. North of here, even better views of the Shawangunks open up with the observation tower at Mohonk Mountain House becoming prominent to the west. The Devil's Path in the Greene County Catskills appears to the north on clear enough days. Some vineyards join the orchards along the road, reflecting a developing local wine industry. The campus of SUNY New Paltz starts to form a distinct skyline to the north, and to the east the ridgeline of Illinois Mountain complements the Shawangunks. The Shawangunk Ridge as seen from NY 208 south of New Paltz The views reach their peak at the New Paltz town line, then NY 208 descends from the rise it has reached. After some tight curves and bends, SUNY's athletic fields to the east herald entry into the village of New Paltz, where NY 208 becomes South Chestnut Street. A mile into the village, it reaches its northern terminus at a busy intersection at the edge of downtown with NY 299 and NY 32\\\\. Continuing north from here puts a driver on the latter. History The earliest of the road segments that make up NY 208 dates to 1735, when a \\"Highway Deed\\" was drawn up for a segment in the Town of Montgomery, then in Ulster County, from the Shawangunk town line to what was then the Goshen town line (today Hamptonburgh). When it came to acquire a name, it was first Walden Road. In 1950, Maybrook renamed its portion Homestead Avenue in honor of early settlers whose houses stood or had stood along the road. =Designation= NY 208 in Washingtonville NY 208 was assigned to its current routing between Monroe and Gardiner in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York.Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book, 1930‚Äì31 and 1931‚Äì32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931). The 1930‚Äì31 edition shows New York state routes prior to the 1930 renumbering The route was extended north to its current terminus in New Paltz . Prior to 1930, the entirety of NY 208 was unnumbered. When US 6 was rerouted to follow the new Quickway and NY 32 between Monroe and Central Valley in the mid-1950s, NY 208 was extended northeast from Monroe along the former routing of US 6 to Highland Mills, where it terminated at NY 32. This extension of NY 208 remained in place until April 1, 1980, when ownership and maintenance of NY 208 from Schunnemunk Street in Monroe to Highland Mills was transferred to Orange County as part of a large highway maintenance swap between the county and the state of New York. Following the swap, NY 208 was rerouted within Monroe to follow its current alignment between NY 17M and Schunnemunk Street while the former routing of NY 208 between Monroe and Highland Mills was redesignated as County Route 105. In 2006, the portion of the route between Washingtonville and New Paltz was also designated as State Bicycle Route 208. =New Jersey connection= In the 1940s, the New Jersey Department of Transportation planned to link a spur route then called Route S4B from Paramus up though Bergen County to connect with NY 208 at Monroe. The road never got any further than Oakland, but it was renumbered to Route 208 in 1953. = Traffic congestion = The congested southern end of the NY 52 / NY 208 overlap in Walden. The village of Walden noted in its 2005 Comprehensive Plan the difficulties created by the oblique intersection at the southern end of the NY 52 concurrency. Traffic on northbound NY 208 comes to a stop sign at the intersection, where NY 52 comes in from the right at a slightly lower grade and a sharp angle, with the view mostly blocked by a building. The layout of the intersection is very poor for trucks making this turn, and the congestion all these factors create has been forcing more drivers to resort to side streets, the village believed, since traffic counts have been going up on NY 52 and NY 208 but down on the concurrency. The village hoped to work with the state DOT on marking an alternate route for trucks, but as of now, no official solution has been reached.

He was Vice President of Argentina and Governor of Buenos Aires Province. He has also served two tenures as president of the Justicialist Party. He was the candidate to the presidency for the Front for Victory ticket in the 2015 general elections, and lost to Mauricio Macri in a runoff election.  Family  Scioli was born in Villa Crespo, Buenos Aires. He spent his first years in a middle class home located at the corner of Corrientes and Humboldt. His grandfather ran an electrical hardware store, which over time grew into a store selling electrical appliances that was to become the family business. Scioli has described himself as a loyal man devoted to his stable and intimate circle, and an understanding but demanding father. In 1975, his brother Jos√© Scioli was kidnapped by a cell of the Montoneros guerrilla group. Daniel Scioli, then aged 18, carried out the negotiations with the kidnappers to free his brother. Jos√© was released in exchange for a cash payment by their father. He was married to former model and entrepreneur Karina Rabolini and has an extramarital daughter, Lorena. Scioli refused to recognize his daughter, but he was eventually forced by law to recognize her. She was then accepted by Scioli as his daughter when she was 18 years old. Regarding this issue, he says, \\"It helped me to grow and to give me peace of mind. My relation with Lorena improved my life, and that‚Äôs why now I can also enjoy Father‚Äôs Day\\".  Education  Scioli attended Colegio Ward‚Äôs primary school in Villa Sarmiento, where he lived until he was 17 years old. For his secondary schooling, he graduated from the Escuela Superior de Comercio Carlos Pellegrini with a diploma in commercial expertise, having attained one of the three best grade averages. He started studies in marketing at the Universidad Argentina de la Empresa (U.A.D.E.) in Buenos Aires; in October 2015 he graduated finishing his final exams. Scioli and Ricardo Orosco, head of the UADE, were denounced for a possible degree forgery, as several topics of study approved by him are no longer part of the scheduled studies.  Sports career  His interest in sports began at the Villa Crespo club. He took part in swimming, tennis, basketball and a form of badminton, representing his city in each. His passion for offshore powerboat racing took off when a friend invited him for a ride in a powerboat. Some time later he competed in his first Offshore Powerboat race in Mar del Plata, in which he finished last. \\"This made me very angry, so I decided to train until I started winning, and finally ended up as the world champion,\\" he states. Scioli started to compete in offshore powerboat racing in 1986 in 1987 he joined the Italian powerboat designer, builder and engineer Fabio Buzzi who ran FB Design, one of the most successful powerboat racing teams in the world. On December 4, 1989 he lost his right arm in an accident whilst racing on the Paran√° river in the 1000 km Delta Argentino race. A wave produced by an oil tanker is believed to have overturned his boat. A fitted prosthesis enabled Scioli to pursue his love of offshore powerboat racing. Even with this handicap he won many offshore powerboat racing championships in various categories. On board La Gran Argentina, a Fabio Buzzi-designed FB 55, Daniel Scioli was a three-time winner of the World Superboat USA Championship and captured 4 European titles. The boat's hull was modified in 2000 into a long- distance record setter. Scioli went on to set the Miami-Nassau-Miami record with an average speed of 100 mph.  Business career  In the field of business his activity was linked to the electrical appliances market. In 1991 the Swedish company Electrolux, which had left the Argentine market on account of the country‚Äôs instability, nominated him as the agent of its brand for Argentina. In 1994 Scioli encouraged the firm to re-establish in Argentina, an effort which gave rise to Electrolux Argentina, of which he became the director, a post he held until 1997.  Political career  Scioli's running mate, Alberto Balestrini, President Kirchner and Scioli celebrate the victory of the Scioli-Balestrini ticket in the 2007 race for the Governor of the Province of Buenos Aires, the nation's largest. Scioli‚Äôs political career took off in 1997, when he ran for a seat in the Argentine Chamber of Deputies on behalf of the Justicialist Party in the City of Buenos Aires. He won that election and on December 10 of that year he became a Deputy in the Argentine Congress. He was nominated president of the Sports Committee of the House for a two-year tenure, a nomination that was renewed for another two-year period on the basis of a unanimous vote. Having been re-elected as a Deputy in 2001, in December 2001 he became a minister as the Secretary of Sports and Tourism. In 2003 the formula Kirchner-Scioli running on the Front for Victory ticket won the presidential election. Thus Scioli became Argentina‚Äôs Vice-President and the President of the Senate. In 2007, upon N√©stor Kirchner's retirement as President, Daniel Scioli was elected Governor of the Province of Buenos Aires, considered one of the most influential political jobs in Argentina. Following disappointing results for the ruling Front for Victory (FPV) in the June 28, 2009, mid-term elections, Scioli replaced Kirchner as President of the Justicialist Party (to which the FPV belongs).Clar√≠n: Scioli estren√≥ su liderazgo peronista Scioli was the FPV candidate in the 2015 Argentine presidential election, and was endorsed by incumbent President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner. The initial polls pointed him as a favourite, with some predicting he would win enough votes to win outright and avoid a ballotage. However, he only narrowly won the first round, forcing him into a ballotage against Buenos Aires mayor Mauricio Macri. The ballotage round was held on November 22.

Biography His studies focused on the early history of Islam and the Caliphate. Among his other works, he completed Julius von Mohl's translation of Ferdowsi's Shahnama, with the French title Livre des Rois. This was the first European translation of the pivotal work made available to a wide audience. Barbier de Meynard also translated numerous works by al-Masudi, ibn Khordadbeh and other Caliphate-era historians. He studied the history of Zoroastrianism, editing the Dictionnaire G√©ographique de la Perse, and wrote about the then-nascent Bah√° º√≠ Faith. He was involved in the editing of the 19th-century edition of Crusader sources in Arabic with French translations, the Recueil des Historiens des Croisades. Barbier de Meynard was elected a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1895.

At its inception, the institution was known as the Acad√©mie royale de m√©decine (or Royal Academy of Medicine). This academy was endowed with the legal status of two institutions which preceded it ‚Äî the Acad√©mie royale de chirurgie (or Royal Academy of Surgery), which was created in 1731 and of the Soci√©t√© royale de m√©decine (or Royal Society of Medicine), which was created in 1776.  Background  Academy members initially convened at the Paris Faculty of Medicine (or Facult√© de M√©decine de Paris). Four years later, the Academy acquired its own headquarters, in the form of a mansion in the rue de Poitiers, where it was located until 1850. The office was then relocated to a vaulted hall of the Hospital of Charity on rue Saint Pierre. Their current facility on Rue Bonaparte was designed by the French architect Justin Rochet, and was constructed between 1899 and 1902. In addition to Medicine, the Academy has also been known to concern itself with access thereto.https://onpes.gouv.fr/academie-nationale-de-medecine.html As of 2020, Maurice Tubiana is the president of the Academy.  Renaming  The institution name has been changed several times since its creation. The following provides a timeline for the various names taken on by the institution: * Acad√©mie Royale de M√©decine (1820 - 1851); * Acad√©mie Imp√©riale de M√©decine (1852 - 1947); * Acad√©mie Nationale de M√©decine (1947‚Äìpresent).  Edict  The edict of 1820 (formally known as Ordonnance de 1820) was signed by Louis XVIII. The edict issued the following missions to the Acad√©mie Royale de M√©decine: \\" This Academy is especially instituted to respond to all requests coming from the government on all subjects that may concern public health, and mainly on epidemics, diseases specific to a country, epizooties, diverse fields of legal medicine, propagation of antivariolic vaccination, appraisal of new and secret, internal as well as external, medications, natural or man-made mineral waters, etc...\\" \\"The Academy will moreover take charge of the works of the Companie royale de m√©decine and the Acad√©mie Royale de chirurgie in all fields of study or research which can contribute to the improvement of the art of healing.\\" Consequently, all registers and papers belonging to the Companie royale de m√©decine and the Acad√©mie Royale de chirurgie and related to the tasks assigned to the Academies, will be transmitted as Archives to the new Academy.\\"  Notable members   External links  * Official site * Bulletin de l'Acad√©mie nationale de m√©decine in Gallica, the digital library of the BnF.

The sensor is usually located on the butterfly spindle/shaft, so that it can directly monitor the position of the throttle. More advanced forms of the sensor are also used. For example, an extra \\"closed throttle position sensor\\" (CTPS) may be employed to indicate that the throttle is completely closed. Some engine control units (ECUs) also control the throttle position electronic throttle control (ETC) or \\"drive by wire\\" systems, and if that is done, the position sensor is used in a feedback loop to enable that control.McKay, D., Nichols, G., and Schreurs, B., \\"Delphi Electronic Throttle Control Systems for Model Year 2000;Driver Features, System Security, and OEM Benefits. ETC for the Mass Market,\\" SAE Technical Paper 2000-01-0556, 2000 Related to the TPS are accelerator pedal sensors, which often include a wide open throttle (WOT) sensor. The accelerator pedal sensors are used in electronic throttle control or \\"drive by wire\\" systems, and the most common use of a wide open throttle sensor is for the kick-down function on automatic transmissions. Modern day sensors are non contact type. These modern non contact TPS include Hall effect sensors, inductive sensors, magnetoresistive and others. In the potentiometric type sensors, a multi-finger metal brush/rake is in contact with a resistive strip,Garrick, R.D., Sensitivity of Contact Electronic Throttle Control Sensor to Control System Variation, Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Technical Paper, 2006-01-0763, April 2006. while the butterfly valve is turned from the lower mechanical stop (minimum air position) to WOT, there is a change in the resistance and this change in resistance is given as the input to the ECU. Non contact type TPS work on the principle of Hall effect or inductive sensors, or magnetoresistive technologies, wherein generally the magnet or inductive loop is the dynamic part which is mounted on the butterfly valve throttle spindle/shaft gear and the sensor & signal processing circuit board is mounted within the ETC gear box cover and is stationary. When the magnet/inductive loop mounted on the spindle which is rotated from the lower mechanical stop to WOT, there is a change in the magnetic field for the sensor. The change in the magnetic field is sensed by the sensor and the voltage generated is given as the input to the ECU. Normally a two pole rare-earth magnet is used for the TPS due to their high Curie temperatures required in the under-hood vehicle environment. The magnet may be of diametrical type, ring type, rectangular or segment type. The magnet is defined to have a certain magnetic field that does not vary significantly with time or temperature.

He made a total of 433 Football League appearances for Crystal Palace and Ipswich Town. Early life Bailey was born in Epsom, Surrey, the fifth child in a family of thirteen. During World War II, he was evacuated to Somerset, and was educated in Weston-super-Mare, before returning to his native Surrey at the age of 15. He played for Tottenham Juniors; however, it was a long way to travel from Epsom to North London, so he joined nearby Crystal Palace as an Amateur. During his National Service, he served in Germany, where he represented B.A.O.R., also reaching the quarter finals of the Army Cup. Playing career Bailey signed professional terms in June 1949 and made his League debut against Torquay United at the age of 17 when Palace lost 3‚Äì1. However, he did not make regular appearances until after his Army service. Bailey missed only one match in the 1953‚Äì54 season and was granted a benefit, along with Jack Edwards in 1954. He was signed for Ipswich Town, by Alf Ramsey, on the day before the transfer deadline in March 1956, and came into the League side in the Easter local derby match with Norwich City at Carrow Road. He conceded two goals in the first three minutes. Despite this start, he soon displaced George McMillan as the Town's regular 'keeper, and won Championship medals in the First, Second, and Third Divisions of the Football League. He became a qualified M.C.C. coach and F.A. coach. During the summer, he played cricket for Ipswich and East Suffolk, one of the leading clubs in Suffolk, for whom he kept wicket. He also ran the Ipswich footballers' darts team, which played weekly matches against local clubs. His son, Gary Bailey, was a goalkeeper for Manchester United and helped them win two FA Cups in the 1980s, and was also capped twice by England, before retiring due to injury in 1987. Roy Bailey, Larry Carberry, John Elsworthy, Ted Phillips, and Jimmy Leadbetter became the first players to have won First (now Premier League), Second (now Football League Championship), and Third Division (now Football League One) Championship medals with the same club; a feat that is only equaled by Leicester City's Andy King in 2015‚Äì16 season after Leicester City F.C. won the Premier League, having also previously won League One, and Championship with Leicester. He moved to South Africa in 1964 on retiring as a player, and lived there until he died in April 1993 at the age of 60.

He was a U.S. Representative from North Carolina, and later a signer of the Texas Declaration of Independence and Texas Secretary of the Navy. Early life Potter was born in Granville County, North Carolina near Williamsboro (now part of Vance County, North Carolina). His early education was in the common schools. He served as a midshipman in the United States Navy from 1815 to 1821. Potter subsequently studied law, was admitted to the bar, and practiced in Halifax, North Carolina and Oxford, North Carolina. Career Potter was a member of the North Carolina House of Commons in 1826 and 1828. He was elected as a Jacksonian to the Twenty-first Congress and the Twenty-second Congress. He served from March 4, 1829, until his resignation in November 1831, after he attacked and castrated two men, whom he believed to be having adulterous relationships with his wife. He again served as a member of the state House of Commons from 1834 until his expulsion in January 1835 either for \\"cheating at cards\\" or \\"for brandishing a gun and knife during a fight over a card game\\". Potter moved to Harrison County, Texas, in 1835 and settled on a farm overlooking Caddo Lake, near Marshall, Texas. In Texas, he continued his political career, becoming a member of the Convention of 1836 which issued the Texas Declaration of Independence on March 2, 1836. During the Texas Revolution Potter was Secretary of the Navy in the cabinet of interim President David G. Burnet. He represented the Red River District in the Texas Congress in 1837-1841. He participated in the Regulator- Moderator War in East Texas as a leader of the Harrison County Moderators. Death and legacy On March 2, 1842, Potter's home was surrounded by a band of Regulators led by William Pinckney Rose.

She continued to serve the Navy after the war's end until decommissioned in 1898 after the end of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Construction USS Catskill‚Äîa single-turreted monitor‚Äîwas launched on December 16, 1862 by Continental Iron Works, Greenpoint, New York; outfitted at New York Navy Yard; commissioned on February 24, 1863, Commander George Washington Rodgers in command; and reported to the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. Civil War operations officers of USS Catskill posing on deck and atop the turret while the ship was in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina, circa 1865. Note the Dahlgren 12-pounder deck howitzers. =Assigned to the South Atlantic blockade= Catskill reported for duty at Port Royal, South Carolina on March 5, 1863, and for the remainder of the war operated off Charleston, South Carolina. Catskill was damaged by Confederate gunfire during the 7 April attack on Fort Sumter that demonstrated both the strengths of well-defended fortifications and the limitations of monitor-type ironclads. That began the lengthy series of operations against the strongly fortified and stoutly defended harbor. From July‚ÄìSeptember 1863, Catskill repeatedly took part in attacks on the batteries and forts protecting Charleston from the sea. Rodgers was killed in action on 17 August, while directing the fire of his ship against Charleston's forts. The ship was hit by Confederate gunfire on several occasions, but skillful work by her crew‚Äînow under the command of Lieutenant Commander Edward Barrett‚Äîreturned her to action without returning for repairs. Catskill destroyed the grounded blockade runner Prince Albert off Fort Moultrie on August 9, 1864. When Charleston was evacuated on 18 February 1865, she boarded and took possession of the grounded blockade runner, Deer, and later in that day raised the flag over another grounded steamer, Celt. Post‚ÄìCivil War service Relieved from duty, Catskill cleared Charleston on July 13, and sailed to the Philadelphia Navy Yard, where she was decommissioned on 26 July. Here she remained in ordinary until 1873. During that time, she was briefly renamed Goliath (June 15 ‚Äì August 10, 1869). Repaired at New York during 1874 and 1875, Catskill joined the North Atlantic Squadron, with whom she cruised along the northeast coast from March 4, 1876 ‚Äì November 5, 1877. From 1878 to 1895, Catskill was in ordinary at various anchorages in Virginia, and from 1895 to 1898 in ordinary at Philadelphia's League Island Navy Yard. Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War service Upon the outbreak of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Catskill was recommissioned for patrol duty in New England waters. This lasted from April 16 ‚Äì September 22, 1898, after which Catskill returned to League Island until sold on 4 December 1901.

A party leader may be the same person as the parliamentary leader, or the roles may be separated. Terminology In many countries, the position of leader of a political party (that is, the organisational leader) and leader of a parliamentary group are separate positions, and while they are often held by the same person, this is not always or automatically the case. If the party leader is a member of the government, holds a different political office outside the parliamentary body in question, or no political office at all, the position of parliamentary leader is frequently held by a different person. In English, the leader may be referred to as a \\"parliamentary chairman\\", \\"group leader\\" or simply \\"parliamentary leader\\", among other names. Examples =Canada= A parliamentary leader is chosen in Canadian politics to lead their caucus in a legislative body, whether it be the House of Commons or a provincial legislature. They serve as interim legislative leaders, when a party leader either has no seat in the legislative body, during a transition period preceding, or following a leadership contest. =European Parliament= Each of the seven political groups of the European Parliament has its own group leader. The groups within the European Parliament are often very broad, so the position of the group leader is a unifying one‚Äîthey may help to consolidate MEPs with similar outlooks ahead of important votes. The groups are organisationally separate from a European political party, and multiple parties often ally as a single group, thus the distinction between a party and a parliamentary leader is usually strict. =Germany= In German politics, leaders of the major parties have often been heads of government of the various states rather than members of the national parliament. Hence, the position of parliamentary leader in the federal parliament (Germany also has 16 state parliaments) is often occupied by a different person. The parliamentary leader has the supreme responsibility for coordinating the work of the MPs representing his or her party. Even when the party leader is a member of the national parliament, the parliamentary leader can be a different person. For instance, Friedrich Merz was parliamentary leader while Angela Merkel was party leader for some years while the CDU was in opposition. If the party leader is the Chancellor or a member of the government, another person always is the parliamentary leader. =United Kingdom= In British politics, the leader of a party is typically the same person as the parliamentary leader. The leader may not fully control the party bureaucracy. The leader may be chosen by members of parliament (MPs) from among their number, or elected by the wider party membership at a party conference, but once elected must retain the support of the parliamentary party. Similarly, the position of prime minister may be given to the parliamentary leader (viz. party leader) of the largest political party in parliament, with the expectation they will be able secure and retain the confidence of a majority of MPs. Some smaller parties have parliamentary leaders in the national parliament (in Westminster) who are separate from the party leaders‚Äîthe party leader may hold office in a devolved (sub-national) parliament or assembly. =Australia and New Zealand= In Australian and New Zealand politics, the party figure commonly described as \\"leader\\" is usually an MP responsible for managing the party's business within parliament. Party constitutions will typically distinguish between the parliamentary leader and the organisational leader (who typically is outside of parliament), with the latter often termed a \\"federal president\\" or \\"party president\\". The two roles are organisationally distinct even if close cooperation is expected.

In the solid state AmO2 adopts the fluorite, CaF2 structure. It is used as a source of alpha particles. Historical use Synthesis of americium dioxide involves precipitating/water a solution of americium in hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution as described by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The demand for americium dioxide stems from the difficulty of storing the element americium as a liquid in the hydrochloric acid solution because the alpha radiation and hydrochloric acid decomposes storage containers over time. To solve the liquid storage problem, Oak Ridge National Laboratory devised a synthesis to turn liquid americium-acid solution into a precipitated form of americium for safer handling and more efficient storage. Synthesis (1960) Synthesis of americium dioxide as described by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory includes making a solution of americium in hydrochloric acid by adding americium to hydrochloric acid, then neutralizing the acid as using ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH). After neutralization using ammonium hydroxide, a saturated oxalic acid solution was added to the now neutralized solution. This causes large americium oxalate crystals to begin to grow; once complete precipitation is achieved, oxalic acid is then added, once again, to attain a slurry. The slurry of americium oxalate and oxalic acid is next agitated before the americium oxalate is filtered out, washed with water, and is partially dried by allowing air to flow through it. Oak Ridge National Laboratory researchers noted that the americium oxalate that was filtered out has a \\"dusty rose color\\" appearance. The americium oxalate is then added to a platinum boat to undergo calcination. The americium oxalate precipitate is dried in a furnace and will begin to decompose at 350 ¬∞C. When decomposition begins to occur, the oxalate will turn into the desired black americium dioxide; to ensure no oxalate remains in the newly forming dioxide, the oven temperature is increased and held at 800 ¬∞C then slowly allowed to cool to room temperature. Americium-aluminium alloys Americium-aluminium alloys can be formed by melting americium dioxide with aluminium and an additional fluxing agent. The created alloy can undergo neutron irradiation to produce other transuranic nuclides.

His unique guitar and voice make them among the most haunting blues recorded. After much speculation and dispute, he has been identified as Joe Holmes (1897, McComb, Mississippi ‚Äì 1949, Sibley, Louisiana), a self-taught guitarist from Mississippi. Identity The Mississippi blues artist Big Joe Williams took a fancy to the name King Solomon Hill and laid claim to it in interviews with Bob Koester, stating that the Hill sides were his first recordings. This story was published by Samuel Charters in his pioneering history The Country Blues. Williams had not known Blind Lemon Jefferson, so he claimed that the song \\"My Buddy Blind Papa Lemon\\" was about another singer. In a footnote, Charters admitted that the story was open to question, as the style, especially the singing, on the King Solomon Hill sides was so different from Williams's usual style.Charters, Samuel B. (1959). The Country Blues. Rinehart. English ed., Michael Joseph, 1960. p. 137. In his later work The Bluesmen, Charters dismissed Williams's story and commented on the strong resemblance between King Solomon Hill and Sam Collins, which led some blues enthusiasts to believe that they were the same man.Charters, Samuel (1967). The Bluesmen: The Story and the Music of the Men Who Made the Blues. Oak. pp. 126‚Äì128. The identification of Hill as Joe Holmes was made by the prominent blues scholar Gayle Dean Wardlow and strongly contested by another prominent blues scholar, David Evans. Wardlow eventually found four informants who had known Joe Holmes and identified his voice on the records of King Solomon Hill. One informant lived in a section of Sibley, Louisiana, known as Yellow Pine, within which is a community formerly known as King Solomon Hill, centered on a hill on which stood King Solomon Hill Baptist Church. A retired postal worker confirmed that King Solomon Hill would have been a valid postal address in 1932. The community is now known as Salt Works. No informant remembers Holmes using the name King Solomon Hill, so Wardlow concluded that Paramount Records chose to use his address as his recording name.Wardlow, Gayle Dean (1998). Chasin' That Devil Music, Searching for the Blues. Miller Freeman Books. . p. 211. Originally published as \\"One Last Walk up King Solomon Hill\\", Blues Unlimited, no. 148 (Winter 1987). Biography Holmes was born near McComb, Mississippi, in 1897. In 1915 he followed his brother to northern Louisiana, where he married Roberta Allums. In 1920 he returned to McComb with his wife and their child, Essie. There he played with the most famous local blues musician, Sam Collins, known locally as \\"Salty Dog Sam\\" and on record as \\"Cryin' Sam Collins\\". When interviewed by Wardlow, Roberta recalled seeing her husband playing with Collins, whom she recognized from a publicity image for Black Patti Records. One year later, Roberta and Essie returned to Sibley, while Joe pursued his musical career, initially in McComb and then as an itinerant, returning periodically to Sibley. One town he played in was Minden, Louisiana, where he had a friend, George Young. In 1928 Blind Lemon Jefferson passed through Minden, and Holmes and Young left with him for Wichita Falls, Texas. Holmes later celebrated his brief partnership with Jefferson on his record \\"My Buddy Papa Lemon\\". At that time he befriended Willard Thomas, known as Ramblin' Thomas, who became his favorite musical partner. Holmes would often travel to Shreveport, Louisiana, to play with Thomas.Wardlow 1998, pp. 3‚Äì4. Originally published in 78 Quarterly, no. 1 (1967). Little evidence exists of his life outside of music. He was described as a heavy drinker. He died of a cerebral hemorrhage in Louisiana in 1949. Recording In 1932, while performing in Minden, Holmes was invited to record for Paramount. Wardlow speculated that the Paramount sales manager Henry Stephany stopped at Minden en route from Birmingham, Alabama, to Dallas on the recommendation of Ben Curry (possibly the same man as Bogus Ben Covington), a friend and fellow musician who had moved from Arcadia, Louisiana, to Birmingham. In any case, somebody representing Paramount took Holmes to Birmingham, where he met up with Ben Curry and other Alabama musicians: the blues singer Marshal Owens and a gospel quartet, the Famous Blue Jay Singers of Birmingham. The musicians travelled to the Paramount recording studio in Grafton, Wisconsin, and recorded at least twenty-eight titles, six of them by Holmes and issued under the name King Solomon Hill. It has been speculated that the recording session occurred about January 1932, but Roberta Allums stated that it was in the spring.Wardlow 1998. pp. 4‚Äì5, 212‚Äì213.Dixon, Robert M. W.; Godrich, John; and Rye, Howard (1997). Blues and Gospel Records 1890‚Äì1943. 4th ed. Oxford University Press. . Fourteen records were issued, three by King Solomon Hill, but Paramount was on the edge of bankruptcy, pressing and shipping only small numbers of records. Holmes took three discs with white labels back to Sibley, but his friends and family never saw any discs with a Paramount label. His friend John Wills did not believe they were \\"real records\\". Until persuaded by Wardlow, he believed that Holmes had paid to have them recorded privately.Wardlow 1998. pp. 212‚Äì213. Few copies survived. One of the three, Paramount 13125, with \\"My Buddy Papa Lemon\\" and \\"Times Has Done Got Hard\\", was long believed to be lost, until a copy was discovered in 2002.Classic Blues Artwork from 1920s.

It is a rewrite by Jack Nitzsche and Russ Titelman and bears only a passing resemblance to \\"The Gone Dead Train\\" as performed by King Solomon Hill.

Description Bacopa caroliniana is a perennial creeping herb. The leaves of this plant are succulent, smell of lemon if crushed, and are relatively thick. Leaves are oblanceolate and are arranged oppositely on the stem. The flowers are blue, with five petals. It grows to . It will grow above the water if given the chance with similar but waxy leaves and will even flower underwater occasionally, though the flowers soon rot. Emerse flowers don‚Äôt set seed on their own, thus it requires cross pollination. Cultivation Its ability to grow in water makes it a popular aquarium plant. It can even grow in slightly brackish conditions. Propagation is through cuttings. It grows easily in the aquarium. The color of the leaves will vary, depending on the amount of light. The leaves will turn bronze or even almost red under high light levels. In the wild it grows in bog or semi- submersed conditions, adapting well if flooded and fully submerged. It can be grown in or by the pond in warmer locales (or in shallow dishes or as a house plant if kept sufficiently damp) and will grow all year round, but is frost tender (though it will normally grow back from the roots if damaged) and appreciates a light shade. In the aquarium it needs good lighting to grow strongly but will survive in even fairly low-light levels.

(Link is to the original high-resolution scanned image.) Giles Mompesson (c. 1583 ‚Äì 1663) was an English office holder and courtier who sat in the House of Commons between 1614 and 1621, when he was sentenced for corruption. He was officially a \\"notorious criminal\\" whose career was based on speculation and corruption. His name came to be regarded as a synonym for official corruption, because he used nepotism to gain positions for licensing businesses by which he pocketed the fees. In the reaction against Charles I, Mompesson's name was invoked as a symbol of all that was wrong with aristocracy. Sir Giles Overreach, the anti-hero of Philip Massinger's 1625 play A New Way to Pay Old Debts, is based on Mompesson.  Licensing monopoly Mompesson was born in Wiltshire. He grew up into a small, swarthy individual with black hair. He entered Hart Hall, Oxford in 1600, but left without a degree the next year for Lincoln's Inn; he later departed there without becoming a lawyer. In 1606 or 1607, he married Katherine, the daughter of the late Sir John St. John, who had been one of the most prominent men in Wiltshire. Through the influence of his brother-in-law, Sir John St John, 1st Baronet, Mompesson became a Member of Parliament for Great Bedwyn in Wiltshire in 1614. Another daughter of John St. John (and thus Mompesson's sister-in- law) married Edward Villiers, the half-brother of George Villiers, and Mompesson's connection to George Villiers was the key to his later despotism. George Villiers became James I's favourite (and alleged lover), rising to the rank of Duke of Buckingham by 1616, and Mompesson was quick to use his family connections. His infamous career was tied directly to that of George Villiers and James I. In 1616, Mompesson used his influence to propose to Villiers that there be a commissioner of inns. Justices of the peace were in charge of granting licences to taverns, but there was ambiguity about inns. While Fulke Greville, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, disapproved of the legal standing of Mompesson's plan, Sir Francis Bacon, then the Attorney General, felt that it was within the king's powers, and Villiers urged the king to press the exchequer to approve the plan. Mompesson thus became one of three commissioners of inns in 1617. The fines that he could levy against inn- keepers out of compliance were left to his discretion, and the fees that he could charge to license an inn were similarly up to his own judgment. His only constraint was that four-fifths of the money was to go to the Treasury. On 18 November 1616, James knighted Mompesson, giving him more authority when dealing with innkeepers. Mompesson's performance of his job was aggressive and avaricious. He expanded his brief to license taverns, which was clearly the historical realm of the Justices of the peace, and he trespassed into the jurisdiction of the Justices in other ways as well. Justices of the Peace were responsible for keeping the domestic peace, and Mompesson would allow taverns closed for ill repute and bad behaviour to reopen if they paid him a stiff bribe/fee. In 1617, Mompesson proposed to Villiers and received a scheme to raise ¬£10,000 in four years by selling decayed timber from royal estates. For performing this public service, he was to receive ¬£1,000 personally in the first year, with another ¬£1,000 due at the end of four years. Evidence would later show that he made over ¬£10,000 profit beyond what he gave to the Treasury, as well as the ¬£2,000 due to him. By the next year, his reputation was such that there was a backlash. Mompesson was given a second monopoly, to investigate the production of gold and silver thread and to charge licensing fees to those who produced it. Furthermore, Mompesson was given the power to imprison those found guilty of producing gold and silver thread without a licence. He immediately set about extorting money from goldsmiths in London. In 1619, Mompesson obtained a position as a surveyor of the profits of James I's New River Company, with a ¬£200 annuity taken from the royal profits. In 1620, Mompesson was granted a licence to make charcoal from coal and, finally, a licence to find and recover \\"concealed\\" Crown lands (i.e., property over which the Crown's rights as landlord had fallen into abeyance or had not yet fully been realised). Any lands he discovered valued at less than ¬£200 were his to keep, and those above were to be regulated, with fees, rents, and charges for ingress and egress. Naturally, Mompesson undervalued the lands he \\"found,\\" consistently discovering them to be under the ¬£200 threshold, and farmers were at high risk.  Backlash, trial, and banishment  The sentiment against Mompesson was very high in 1620, and Bacon warned Villiers to take away Mompesson's licensing of inns, in particular. Buckingham, however, continued to support him. Mompesson was re-elected MP for Great Bedwyn in 1621. In February 1621, the House of Commons and House of Lords began investigating him on separate matters, with Commons investigating the inn licensures and Lords the gold thread. Among other damning evidence, there was one account of one of Mompesson's agents showing up at a tavern, claiming emergency, begging for a place to sleep, and then, the next morning, prosecuting the tavern keeper for running an unlicensed inn. Sir Edward Coke found that Mompesson had prosecuted over 3,320 inns and taverns on regulations dating back to Henry VIII. Lords found that Mompesson had been guilty of extortion. Mompesson's response was to admit his guilt and plead for mercy. He then attempted to blame Bacon for finding the inn scheme legal in the first place. Commons preferred charges to Lords, waiting sentencing, and Mompesson was ordered to attend every day and to be guarded by the Sergeant-at-Arms. On 3 March 1621, Mompesson fled to France. A Royal Proclamation was issued demanding his apprehension. The next week, the sentence came down. Mompesson was ordered to pay a ¬£10,000 fine, lose his knighthood, and ride down the Strand facing backwards from his horse, and then be imprisoned for life. A few days later, they added banishment for life to the penalty. Further, he was decried as an eternally notorious criminal. His wife, Katherine, stayed in England. She petitioned Charles I for relief, asking that her husband be allowed to return to dispense with his estate, since it was entangled. Commons ordered that all of Mompesson's gains be forfeit, except for the New River annuity, which would go to Katherine. The fine devolved to John St. John. In 1623, Charles gave Mompesson three months to be in England, a period which was later extended. The House of Commons ordered him out of the country on 8 February 1624, but he was back in the country soon after. He lived in Wiltshire in retirement for the rest of his life. Katherine died in 1633. Mompesson erected a monument to her in St Mary's, the parish church of Lydiard Tregoze, Wiltshire. Forest of Dean riots Mompesson was again using his family connections through his sister-in-law Barbara Villiers around 1631, this time employed as her agent managing an area of newly enclosed lands in her possession at the Forest of Dean. Such enclosures and grants of former Royal forest were commonly made to courtiers in return for substantial sums of money, as a means to bolster Charles I's finances independent of Parliament. The lands were worked for iron ore and timber. During riots aimed at destroying the enclosures and returning the lands to common in 1631, an effigy of the \\"odious projector\\" Sir Giles was thrown into the iron ore pits and buried as they were filled in by the rioters. Another agent in his employ was shot at and his house burnt. p62-63 Last years During his later years, his name was not forgotten by Parliamentarian forces. He was a Royalist during the English Civil War and visited the king, though he did not take part. His own will was tested in court and proved on 3 August 1663, so he died some (probably short) time before that date.  References  * Lee, Sidney and Sean Kelsy. \\"Giles Mompesson\\".

Description In software applications that modify information stored on disk, this generally involves flushing any outstanding writes; see buffering. With telecom applications, this generally involves allowing existing callers to finish their call but preventing new calls from initiating. Example Perhaps the best known support for this was incorporated into Microsoft Shadow Copies which was introduced in Microsoft Windows Server 2003. For an application to be quiesced during the shadow copy process, it must register itself as a writer and it is responsible for putting itself into a quiescent mode upon notification. Vendor schemes Various database and application vendors implement schemes to provide support for this feature including: * Symantec's Livestate ‚Äì now includes a quiesce process, as does VMware's VI3 snapshot and VCB features. Symantec supports Exchange and SQL. * VMware support ‚Äì IO system * IBM DB2 LUW supports a Quiesce command that is used to indicate a state for which all users have been locked out of a database or an instance (of databases) so that administrative tasks can be performed. * IBM DB2 for z/OS, OS/390 and IBM i Operating System has a utility command called QUIESCE, used in order to make it write all data belonging to a certain database (a logical entity in a DB2 subsystem) from the buffers, helping utility programs get DRAIN access on the datasets quickly. * IBM DB2 for z/OS and OS/390 also supports a command SET LOG SUSPEND that technically speaking, stops it from writing to the log, in fact freezing any database activity (except for most queries). This mode is used sometimes for snapshot type backup schemes, thus only lasting for less than a second, ensuring backed up data is in a consistent state.

Career After graduating from Harvard, Houghton began work in the blowing room of B Factory at Corning Glass Works (now Corning Incorporated) in 1921. In 1926, he became assistant to the president and two years later was elected executive vice-president. In 1930, he became president and at the death of his father in 1941 chairman of the board. After leaving this position in 1961 he went on to serve as chairman of the executive committee from 1961 to 1964. He was then named chairman of the board again from 1964‚Äì1971.

The film stars Mickey Rooney as Hart and Tom Drake as Rodgers, along with Janet Leigh, Betty Garrett, Ann Sothern and numerous musical stars. It was the second in a series of MGM biopics about Broadway composers; it was preceded by Till the Clouds Roll By (Jerome Kern, 1946) and followed by Three Little Words (Kalmar and Ruby, 1950) and Deep in My Heart (Sigmund Romberg, 1954). The film is best remembered for featuring the final screen pairing between Rooney and Judy Garland, and for the lavish showcasing of the Rodgers and Hart catalogue of songs. The script, as in many similar films of the era, was heavily fictionalized. It sanitized Hart's complex psychological problems and self-destructive behavior, which led to the break-up of the writing partnership and contributed to Hart's early death. In keeping with cultural taboos of the time, the film also completely ignored Hart's homosexuality. (Thanks to the same taboos, The New York Times reviewer Bosley Crowther ridiculed the film's inaccurate portrayal of Hart but did not specify what was inaccurate.) The introduction to the film is staged as if composer Richard Rodgers were actually playing himself. Actor Tom Drake appears alone in character, identifies himself as Rodgers and tells the audience it is about to see the story of his collaboration with Lorenz Hart. (Contemporary posters from the film featured the faces of most major cast members, including Rooney, but did not show the face of Drake, and his name was in smaller type than those of the other main stars.) Though the film performed very well at the box office, it proved to be quite an expensive production and, as a result, barely recouped its cost in its first release.H.

They struggle to achieve success, however, and Dick ultimately leaves the business to sell children's apparel. Larry becomes impressed with singer Peggy Lorgan McNeil, personally and professionally. But when a show by him and Dick is finally bound for Broadway, his promise to Peggy to play the starring role is ruined because Joyce Harmon is hired to play the part. Dick is attracted to Joyce, but is judged too young to be involved with her, then too old for another woman he meets, Dorothy Feiner. A string of hit songs and shows follows, but Larry seems unable to enjoy the success. After fighting depression, things begin looking up for Larry as soon as Judy Garland agrees to do a movie with Rodgers and Hart music in it. Larry buys a home in California but can't shake his sorrow, even after Dorothy marries Dick and invites Larry to share their home.

Early years James Russell Miller was born near Frankfort Springs, Pennsylvania, on the banks of the Big Traverse, which according to his biographer, John T. Faris, is a merry little mill stream which drains one of the most beautiful valleys in the southern part of Beaver County. His parents were James Alexander Miller and Eleanor Creswell who were of Irish/Scottish stock. Miller was the second child of ten, but his older sister died before he was born. James and his sisters attended the district school in Hanover Township, Beaver County, Pennsylvania until, when James was about fourteen, his father moved to a farm near Calcutta, Ohio. The children then went to the district school during the short winters and worked on the farm during summer. In 1857, James entered Beaver Academy and in 1862 he progressed to Westminster College, Pennsylvania, which he graduated in June 1862. Then in the autumn of that year he entered the theological seminary of the United Presbyterian Church at Allegheny, Pennsylvania. The Christian Commission The Christian Commission was created in response to the disastrous First Battle of Bull Run. On 14 November 1861, the National Committee of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) called a convention which met in New York City. The work of the United States Christian Commission was outlined and the organization completed the next day. In March 1863, Miller promised to serve for six weeks as a delegate of the United States Christian Commission, but at the end of this time he was persuaded to become an Assistant Field Agent and later he was promoted to General Field Agent. He left the Commission on 15 July 1865. The Pastorate Miller resumed his interrupted studies at the Allegheny Theological Seminary in the fall of 1865 and completed them in the spring of 1867. That summer he accepted a call from the First United Presbyterian Church of New Wilmington, Pennsylvania. He was ordained and installed on 11 September 1867. Rev. Miller held firmly to the great body of truth professed by the United Presbyterian Church, in which he had been reared, but he did not like the rule requiring the exclusive singing of the Psalms, and he felt that it was not honest for him to profess this as one of the articles of his Christian belief. He therefore resigned from his pastorate to seek membership in the Presbyterian Church (USA). In his two years as pastor, nearly two hundred names were added to the church roll. The Old and New School Presbyterian Churches were reunited as the Presbyterian Church (USA) on 12 November 1869, and Miller became pastor of the Bethany Presbyterian Church of Philadelphia just nine days later. When he became pastor at Bethany the membership was seventy five and when he resigned in 1878 Bethany was the largest Presbyterian church in Philadelphia, having about twelve hundred members. Rev. Miller then accepted the pastorate of the New Broadway Presbyterian Church of Rock Island, Illinois. In 1880 Westminster College, his alma mater conferred on him the degree of Doctor of Divinity and later in the same year came the invitation to undertake editorial work for the Presbyterian Board of Publication in Philadelphia. Hence Dr. Miller had to resign the Rock Island, Illinois pastorate. In Philadelphia, Miller became interested in the Hollond Mission and eventually became its pastor. During the sixteen months of the pastorate the church membership grew from 259 to 1,164 and Sunday School membership climbed from 1,024 to 1,475. On 29 October 1899, St. Paul Church in West Philadelphia was organized with sixty-six members. Miller was chosen temporary supply and became pastor in 1906. Miller remained pastor until the year of his death, 1912. The church at that time had 1,397 members. Family On 22 June 1870, Miller married Miss Louise E. King of Argyle, New York, whom he had met two years earlier. They had three children, * William King, * Russel King, a fairly well known music teacher and composer, and * Mary Wannamker Miller who married W.B. Mount. Editor and author Miller began contributing articles to religious papers while at Allegheny Seminary. This continued while he was at the First United, Bethany, and New Broadway churches. In 1875, Miller took over from Henry C. McCook, D.D. when the latter discontinued his weekly articles in The Presbyterian, which was published in Philadelphia. Five years later, in 1880, Miller became assistant to the Editorial Secretary at the Presbyterian Board of Publication, also in Philadelphia. When Dr. Miller joined the Board its only periodicals were *The Westminster Teacher *The Westminster Lesson Leaf *The Senior Quarterly *The Sabbath School Visitor *The Sunbeam *The Presbyterian Monthly Record During his tenure at the board the following periodicals were added: *The Junior Lesson Leaf in 1881 *The German Lesson Leaf in 1881 *Forward in 1882 *The Morning Star in 1883 *The Junior Quarterly in 1885 *The Lesson Card circa in 1894 *The Intermediate Quarterly circa 1895 *The Question Leaf circa 1996 *The Blackboard circa 1898 *The Home Department Quarterly in 1899 *The Primary Quarterly in 1901 *The Normal Quarterly in 1902 *The Bible Roll in 1902 *The Beginners Lessons (forerunner of The Graded Lessons) in 1903 *The Primary Teacher in 1906 *The Graded Lessons from 1909 to 1912 **for Beginners **Primary **Junior **Intermediate **Senior *The Westminster Adult Bible Class in 1909 The Sabbath School Visitor ‚Äî the Board's oldest periodical ‚Äî became The Comrade in 1909. From 1880, when James Miller first joined the Board to 1911, when he effectively retired because of ill health, the total annual circulation grew from 9,256,386 copies to 66,248,215 copies. Dr. Miller's first book, Week Day Religion, was published by the board in 1880, the year he joined the Board. Books Miller's lasting fame is through his books. Many are still in publication. John T.

Psions in the Saga of the Skolian Empire  Psion is a term describing people with empathic and in some cases telepathic abilities. Psions can detect emotions, and even individual thoughts, depending on the strength of the psion and the proximity of those around them. They are also susceptible to the emotional suffering of people who are near them, and can suffer emotional scars from other psions who project their pain naturally. To survive the ongoing emotional attacks, psions are trained to put up barriers around their minds, both to protect themselves from unwelcomed feelings and thoughts and to prevent projecting onto others. = Origin of psion capability = There are several hundred genes that result in psionic abilities. The more such genes a psion possesses, the stronger psionic abilities he/she manifests. However, many of these genes are closely linked to recessives that may lead to severe abnormalities and deformities in any children produced. As a result, the stronger the psion parent, the more likely it is that a child will be either deformed or most often never born, the fetus dying in the early stages of pregnancy. This is why psions are very rare. Their genes are recessive, and survive genetically by producing strong pheromones that draw psions together. Telepathy and empathy in Asaro's novels are mediated by two microscopic brain structures, the Kyle Afferent Body (KAB) and Kyle Efferent Body (KEB). The KEB works by modulating the wave functions of some of the particles within it in a way that models, on a much smaller scale and with a low degree of precision, the electrochemical patterns (i.e. thoughts and emotions) of the brain surrounding it. The KAB detects such signals from the KEBs of other nearby psions via quantum entanglement, establishing matching patterns. \\"Parastructures\\" surrounding the KEB and KAB feed information about a sender's brain activity into the KEB, and interpret the quantum patterns in the KAB back into emotions and thoughts in the receiver. = KAB Rating = The term KAB Rating stands for Kyle Afferent Body Rating, and is also called 'Kyle Rating. It refers to the strength of a psion's empathic and telepathic abilities and is measured on a scale from 0 to 10, based on a logarithmic inverse of how many people it would take to find an individual with a given mental strength. Most humans rate between 0 and 2 on this scale, which denotes absent or marginal empathic and telepathic abilities. A three or higher indicates an empath; a six denotes a telepath. There is also a group of psions who have a rating too high to be measured numerically. Those are called \\"Rhon\\". They are extremely rare and to be born Rhon a child must get the full set of psion genes from both parents. In practice, the term Rhon refers to members of Ruby Dynasty, the ruling family of Skolian Empire, as Rhon not related to them are not known.  The Rhon project  The Rhon project was instigated to genetically engineer extremely powerful psions. The project was led by the prominent geneticist Hezahr Rhon. The initial project of Dr. Rhon was actually undertaken to prevent the suffering of psions by attempting to modify their brains so they wouldn't receive the pain of others. The attempt took a nightmarish turn for worse, spawning a race of human beings whose Kyle organs are hardwired to interpret pain signals from normal telepaths as orgasmic pleasure called \\"transcendence\\". When he realized what his creations were, Dr. Rhon wanted to destroy them, but they murdered him first and destroyed his work. As a result, there arose a race of people known as Aristos whose members are the ultimate anti-empaths, sadists utterly devoid of compassion save for a very few characters (Corbal Xir, Calliope Muze, and Tarquine Iquar) who have undergone surgery to remove their ability for transcendence. The Aristo nature is characterized not only by their cruelty but also by power-hunger and sense of superiority. Their leader Eube Qox, founded the Eubian Concord and his descendants presently rule it. Due to their need for transcendence, Aristos started to breed psions, using them as pleasure slaves, so called providers. Their main goal was to produce an extremely strong psion, who could serve them as an ultimate provider, because the stronger a provider's psionic abilities, the stronger pain signals he produces while tortured and the greater pleasure an Aristo experiences. The first actual Rhon psions were a pair of siblings meant to be bred to each other to found a pre-eminent line of providers. They were created from genetic samples of long dead members of the once so powerful Ruby Empire's ruling caste, who were known for their great empathic and telepathic abilities. The male half of the pair, name unknown, committed suicide upon realizing his intended purpose. The female, Lahaylia Selei, killed her captors and escaped. Lahaylia then founded the Skolian Imperialate. Later she discovered a natural Rhon from a nearly dead race of Ruby colonists, named Jarac Skolia, and took him as her consort. However, since this history is rather unnoble, the story as told in the Skolian Empire omits the involvement of the Aristos in creating the Rhon psions.  Kyle Web  The Kyle Web, also known as the psiberweb, is an instantaneous interstellar communication network powered by Locks. The psiberweb can be thought of as similar to the Internet. Unlike the Internet, the psiberweb, rather than existing in real physical form, transmits information through \\"Kyle space\\", also known as \\"psiberspace\\". A theoretical physicist by training, Asaro uses the concepts of the Hilbert space described by the harmonics to create the universe called Kyle space.Article about Asaro's work at Physics Central, an online publication of the American Physical Society. Spherical harmonics (see also Spherical Harmonic) are an orthonormal set of eigenfunctions used in many areas of math and physics, including quantum mechanics and electromagnetics. By directly applying the rules that define Hilbert spaces described by the angular wave functions that solve the Laplace Equation, the author invents a universe where \\"location\\" is based on quantum wave functions rather than position and time, and where a psion's thoughts determined their location in Kyle space. = Lock = The Locks are three powerful sentient machines created by the ancient Ruby Empire. They are located at points of disruption in normal spacetime caused by an intersection with Kyle space, which manifests as a great column of light called a \\"Kyle singularity\\". The ancient technology which created the Locks has been lost, but the Skolian Empire has deduced some of its functioning. Their three known remaining Locks are located on the Orbiter space habitat (headquarters of the Skolian military), the planet Raylicon (origin of the Ruby Empire), and on the Onyx platform. The psiberweb is crucial to the defence of the skolian Empire. Access and control of the psiberweb is what gives the Skolian Empire its equal strength to the more powerful and more numerous Trader empire. Only the Rhon psions have sufficient Kyle Rating to interface with the Locks. In exceptional cases Rhon can even receive emotions over big distances (even through space), mostly when they are closely related to the sender. Less powerful psions called telops can also access and use the Kyle Web, but cannot construct or maintain it. It is possible for a Rhon psion to physically enter psiberspace via a Lock, as the Ruby Pharaoh Dyhianna Selei and her son Taquinil did to escape a Eubian attack on the Orbiter. Inexperienced psions suffer potentially fatal headaches upon entering a Lock. Dyhianna eventually emerged from psiberspace on a random planet, but Taquinil's whereabouts remain unknown at the time of the novel Catch the Lightning. = Triad = Rhon psions can act as Keys to the psiberweb, engaging the Locks to create and maintain psiberweb links. The Locks can support only a limited number of Keys. This limit is determined by a psiberspace law equivalent to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, in that no more than one personality of a specific type can be joined to the Locks at any given time. If two persons of the same type were to join the psiberweb simultaneously, one is likely to die, as Kurj did to Jarac. Rhon psions that \\"join\\" the Locks are considered members of the Dyad or Triad, depending on the context of the novel in the series. A Dyad is formed by two complementary personalities, and a Triad is formed by three such. The Dyad or the Triad when acting together forms the full executive authority that governs the Skolian Empire together with an elected parliament, the Assembly. The different Keys that can exist, (depending which time period the particular novel occurs in), are the Assembly Key, the Military Key, and the Web Key. Each of these Keys has a line succession that is hereditary, though all the members of the Skolia family are in each of the lines at various points due to issues of consanguinity. ; Assembly Key The personality powering the Assembly Key is required to have a peerless intellect and a piercing analytical mind. Therefore, the person who is the Assembly Key takes the sobriquet of the \\"Mind of Skolia\\", or the style of Ruby Pharaoh, with at least the executive powers of chief-of-state. The Selei branch of the Rhon produces the Assembly Key with following line of succession: Lahaylia, then Dyhianna, with Taquinil the designated successor. ; Military Key The personality powering the Military Key is required to be robust, ruthless, agile, forceful, and uncompromising. Therefore, the person who is the Military Key takes the sobriquet of the \\"Fist of Skolia\\", or the style of Imperator, with the executive power of commander- in-chief of all armed forces in the Imperialate. The Skolia branch of the Rhon produces the Military Key: Jarac, Kurj, Althor Valdoria Skolia, Sauscony Valdoria Skolia, and Kelric Valdoria Skolia. ; Web Key The personality powering the Web Key is not required to have any great intellectual or organization skill, merely large amounts of willpower and emotional strength. The person who is the Web Key takes the sobriquet of the \\"Heart of Skolia\\". The only one so far who has ever been the Web Key was Eldrinson Althor Valdoria. Eldrinson perceives psiberspace as a sea.

He was born in Belfast, at the time part of the country of Ireland. As an international, Baird was also called up by both Ireland teams ‚Äì FAI XI and the IFA XI ‚Äì but only played for the latter. Playing career =Club career= After a successful career with Linfield, where he won an Irish League title and Irish Cup, Baird was signed by Manchester United in January 1937 for a fee of ¬£3,500. He joined a struggling side and could do little to prevent United from being relegated at the end of the 1936‚Äì37 season. However the following season, together with Johnny Carey, Jack Rowley, Tommy Breen, Stan Pearson and Tommy Bamford, he helped United gain promotion back to the First Division. Together with Bamford, he finished as United's joint top goalscorer that season, both players scoring 15 goals each. Baird then joined Huddersfield Town in September 1938 and while there helped them reach the semi-final of the FA Cup in 1939. During the Second World War, Baird served in the RAF and guested with several clubs, including his former club Linfield and Ipswich Town, who he would eventually sign for when the war finished. At the time Ipswich were playing in the English Third Division South. Baird made his debut for Ipswich on 31 August 1946 in an away game against Leyton Orient. He went on to make 216 league appearances for Ipswich, scoring six goals. He also played a further 18 games and scored a further goal for them in the FA Cup. Baird retired as a player during the 1951‚Äì52 season, making his final appearance for Ipswich at Crystal Palace on 20 October 1951. He subsequently became a coach at the club. =Irish international= When Baird was playing there were, in effect, two Ireland teams, chosen by two rival associations. Both associations, the Northern Ireland-based IFA and the Irish Free State-based FAI claimed jurisdiction over the whole of Ireland and selected players from the whole island. As a result, several notable Irish players from this era played for both teams. However each association challenged the selection policy of their rival and Baird found himself caught in the middle of one of several disputes. In May 1938, Baird, together with Jackie Brown and Walter McMillen, was one of three Northern Ireland-born players called up by the FAI XI to play in two friendlies against Czechoslovakia and Poland. However the IFA objected and Baird subsequently received a telegram from the English FA ordering him not to accept the offer on the grounds he was not born in the Irish Free State. Baird was bitterly disappointed at missing the chance of an international debut and was keen to play for financial reasons as much as anything. He was neutral about the dispute and was willing to play for either team. However facing suspension from the English FA, he eventually declined the FAI offer. While playing for Huddersfield Town, Baird subsequently made his only appearance for the IFA XI on 16 November 1938, in a 7‚Äì0 defeat to England at Old Trafford. The Second World War effectively put an end to Baird's international career. Earlier while playing for Linfield, Baird also represented the Irish League XI on two occasions in 1936. He scored on his debut against the Scottish League XI at Ibrox and then later assisted them to a 3‚Äì2 win against the English League XI.

The episode's teleplay was written by Jed Seidel and Diane Ruggiero, from a story by series creator Rob Thomas, and was directed by Marcos Siega. The episode premiered on UPN on February 15, 2005. The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a high school student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, Veronica and her father Keith (Enrico Colantoni) take opposing sides when Veronica's world history teacher, Mr. Rooks (Adam Scott) is accused of sexual assault on a student.  Synopsis  Immediately after the previous episode, Logan (Jason Dohring) appears at Veronica's door and asks Veronica to help find his mother, Lynn (Lisa Rinna), whom he believes is alive. Veronica agrees to help out. The next day in class, Veronica participates in a fun and unorthodox world history review with a teacher, Mr. Rooks. However, the fun is disrupted when Carrie Bishop (Leighton Meester) tells the teacher that she's not pregnant and that he can \\"have [his] key back.\\" Veronica talks to the teacher, but he denies that he ever touched Carrie. Meanwhile, Wallace Fennel (Percy Daggs III) steals Carrie's school file while Veronica asks Duncan (Teddy Dunn) for the name of his practitioner, wanting to find out what meds he was taking. Veronica angrily confronts Carrie about her lying. Veronica walks into Mars Investigations, when she learns that Keith has been hired by Carrie's parents, pitting father and daughter against each other. Later, Cliff McCormack (Daran Norris) fake interviews the woman who saw Lynn's suicide, and Logan blows up at her. Veronica visits Mr. Rooks's home, where she finds out the details of the parent-teacher conference a few months earlier: it was simply about grades on the midterm paper. However, Mr. Rooks does not have a lawyer for the hearing. Keith presents some increased evidence for his side to Veronica. Logan gives a tabloid newspaper to Veronica, which states that Lynn Echolls is still alive. Veronica interviews the woman who wrote the story, but the woman turns out to be a crazed fan. Logan is finally convinced that his mother is dead. Weevil (Francis Capra) tells Veronica about a freshman who says that Lynn Echolls jumped. Veronica talks to Mr. Rooks about his previous firing (which Keith attributed to sexual assault). Veronica tells Carrie about the fault in her story‚Äîthat she was actually at a track meet the day she claimed to have had sex with Mr. Rooks. Veronica steals Duncan's medical records and finds out that Abel Koontz (Christian Clemenson) shared a doctor with the Kanes. At the school hearing, Mr. Rooks is acquitted when Carrie's text message evidence is debunked after Veronica shows that it is incredibly easy to create fake text messages. Veronica visits Mr. Rooks's house, where she notices several of the details that Carrie mentioned about his house. Veronica researches Duncan's medication, which she finds is used to treat a form of epilepsy which can cause violent fits and memory blackouts. Duncan researches the winner of the Extemporaneous Speaking Competition, a competition which Mr. Rooks was involved in, and Veronica visits her. It turns out that that girl, Susan (Christine Lakin), was the one who slept with Mr. Rooks and that she is pregnant. However, Carrie tried to make her story known. Weevil brings the freshman who talked about Logan's mom to Logan and Veronica. The boy was shooting a movie on a bridge and saw a body jumping from the bridge at 4:37 PM, exactly the time Lynn Echolls probably jumped from the bridge. However, a few minutes later, Veronica notices that Lynn Echolls's missing credit card has just been used. Later, Veronica sees that Mr. Rooks has resigned. Veronica talks to Abel Koontz, and she reveals a key piece of information: Abel Koontz was dying, so he decided to go to jail because he's going to die anyway, suggesting that he's a proxy for an unknown person.  Arc significance  *Veronica finds a video that apparently shows Lynn Echolls falling from the bridge and shows it to Logan, but then gets a report that one of Lynn's credit cards has been used. *Veronica finds out that Abel Koontz is dying. *Veronica finds out that Duncan has type IV epilepsy.  Music  In addition to the series's theme song, \\"We Used to Be Friends\\", by The Dandy Warhols, the following music can be heard in the episode: *\\"Don't Stand So Close to Me\\" by The Police (sung by several girls to Carrie Bishop to mock her) *\\"Tulips\\" by Bloc Party *\\"Worried About You\\" by The Rolling Stones  Production  The episode was written by three regular writers‚Äîseries creator Rob Thomas, Jed Seidel, and Diane Ruggiero. This is Thomas's fifth writing credit for the series, after \\"Pilot\\", \\"Credit Where Credit's Due\\", \\"Return of the Kane\\" (story), and \\"Drinking the Kool-Aid (story). In addition, the episode is Seidel's fourth writing credit, after \\"Meet John Smith\\", \\"The Girl Next Door\\", and \\"Silence of the Lamb\\" and Ruggiero's fourth writing credit, after \\"The Wrath of Con\\", \\"The Girl Next Door\\" (teleplay), and \\"An Echolls Family Christmas\\". As a joke, three of the episode's guest stars' last names are also names of chess pieces‚ÄîCarrie Bishop, Susan Knight, and Mr. Rooks. Among the episode's guest stars are Adam Scott, who would later become known for his role on Party Down (which was co-created by Veronica Mars writers and producers Rob Thomas, John Enbom and Dan Etheridge), and Leighton Meester, who would later become famous for her role on Gossip Girl as Blair Waldorf. Lead actress Kristen Bell provided the anonymous voiceover for Gossip Girl. 11 years after this episode aired, Bell and Scott would later appear together on the comedy series The Good Place.  Reception  = Ratings = In its original airing, the episode received 2.70 million viewers, ranking 107th of 115 in the weekly rankings. = Reviews = Television Without Pity gave the episode an \\"A\\". Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, gave a positive review. He noted Veronica's increased presence in the episode. \\"Veronica's a busy bee in this episode, making time to dominate the A, B, and C-plots.\\" Also, the reviewer praised the character development in the episode, stating that \\"[b]ut again, it's the character work that makes this episode stand out. Thanks to having three different plots, all using Veronica, it has a constant narrative drive.\\" Price Peterson of TV.com wrote positively of the episode as well. In the reviewer's verdict, he wrote, \\"This was just a good episode of Veronica Mars.

It reaches a height of and accelerates from 0 to in 1.9 seconds. It is the fastest roller coaster in the UK, and the second tallest after the Big One at Blackpool Pleasure Beach.  Ride experience  After passengers are securely restrained, the launch sequence begins when the brake fins are retracted as the train attaches to the catch car. Overhead, a series of five red lights illuminate one by one in a horizontal row as a recording states, \\"Place your heads back, face forwards, hold on tight and brace yourself.\\" Shortly after, a second row of green lights begin to illuminate as the American-accented announcer in the recording enthusiastically shouts \\"Three, two, one ... Go, go, go!\\" The train accelerates to in 1.9 seconds into a steep, vertical top hat element. The train then turns 90 degrees to the left as it crests the top hat. It makes another 90-degree left turn as it descends down the other side of the element. After bottoming out, the train enters an airtime hill, which produces a brief sensation of weightlessness before the train enters the magnetic brake run and returns to the station.  Rollbacks  As with many Intamin Launch Coasters, Stealth experiences occasional rollbacks, which occur when a train is unable to complete the course, specifically failing to make it over the top hat element as a result of energy loss. Occurrences are rare, and there is a braking system in place on the launch side of the track to safely bring the roller coaster back to a complete stop. However rollbacks are safe, and all staff/engineers are trained to safely evacuate guests off the train.

The song was published in 1954. The words are adapted from the Bible (Ruth 1:16-17) (King James Version). The most popular version was recorded by Les Paul and Mary Ford. Other versions were made by Perry Como (for his album When You Come to the End of the Day), Bing Crosby in a medley on his album On the Sentimental Side (1962), George Morgan (see below), Mahalia Jackson (included in her album Great Songs of Love and Faith {1962}) and Leonard Cohen. The recording by Les Paul and Mary Ford was released by Capitol Records as catalog number 2928. It first reached the Billboard magazine charts on October 6, 1954, and lasted 9 weeks on the chart, peaking at number 14. \\"Whither Thou Goest\\" was recorded by George Morgan and released in early 1957 on a 12-inch Columbia 33 1/3 R.P.M. long play album entitled Morgan, By George!. The Columbia standard \\"Red Label\\" LP was recorded prior to the advent of stereo in monophonic high fidelity in 1956 and was released in the winter of early 1957. The LP contains three other songs of much stronger gospel origins, \\"Oh, Gentle Shepherd\\" by well-known songwriter Cindy Walker; \\"Mansion Over the Hilltop\\" and \\"Jesus Savior, Pilot Me\\". George Morgan's version of \\"Whither\\" is only two minutes and 13 seconds long on the LP and is performed in a medium-slow tempo at 3/4 metre and is composed mostly of lead guitars, a violin, muted rhythm cymbal, acoustic bass and a small background singing group containing a soprano singer who backs Morgan quite strongly in the mix. It is the second song on side B of the Columbia LP containing 12 songs in all. Though a \\"pop\\" song, radio stations across the United States continue to program George Morgan's version as a gospel selection to this day. The song was performed live by Leonard Cohen since 1988 and was released on his album Live in London (2009). Additional Compositions of Ruth James Dunne released a new composition of this story on September 10, 2019, entitled \\"Whither Thou Goest, I Will Go.\\" His version begins with Naomi, who's emotional outburst of despair precipitates the first response from Ruth of the title line. The song is structured as a duet debate that ultimately ends with their reconciliation. The words from the Book of Ruth, Chapter 1, are used for the lyrics with some artistic license. For example, a chorus was added to explain \\"how\\" Naomi and Ruth reconciled, which is not explained in the Book of Ruth. That reconciling factor, proposed by James Dunne, is that of a third-party - the Lord. Upon that, Naomi and Ruth agree.

Musical career Takeshi was born in Yokohama, Japan. Not much is known about his childhood, just that he was a big YMO fan and joined the pre-Mad Capsule Markets band Berrie in 1985 after vocalist Kyono and guitarist Minoru Kojima had advertised for a bass guitarist. Since he has been in The Mad Capsule Markets, his style of bass guitar playing has evolved into more than the straight punk bass he used to play. From 1996, when lead guitarist Ai Ishigaki left, Takeshi's bass became the main centerpiece of the band and was more experimental in its use, as he experimented by tuning down his bass to give it more of a Rap-Metal effect. By the time of the Digidogheadlock and OSC-DIS albums, he had mastered the guitar and synthesizer (although it is stated that he probably played most of the piano parts on the early albums), started using many effects pedals, and had a similar sound to Tom Morello's style of guitar playing. He has gone under many pseudonyms, such as Kure Takeshi (his name in Berrie), Kurejii Takeshi, (his name on Humanity), CraÔø• (the name he used from 1991‚Äì1997), and Takeshi \\"Ôø•\\" Ueda (on the albums 4 Plugs and Digidogheadlock). With The Mad Capsule Markets currently on hiatus, Takeshi has been working on his clothing line Fuzz Rez Zweep.  AA  Ueda has released his first album, #1, in February 2009 with the band AA= (standing for \\"all animals are equal\\").AA= Official Website May 4, 2011 AA= also features vocalist Takayoshi Shirakawa (of Back Drop Bomb), guitarist Minoru Kojima (also known as Shin Murohime, previously of The Mad Capsule Markets and die in cries) and drummer Nobuaki Kaneko (of Rize). In September 2009 AA= released a live DVD of the tour to support #1 called Tour #1. A second album, #2, followed in June 2010. In 2011 they released their third album, #3, again followed by a tour DVD Tour #3 ver.1.0+2.0 in 2013. In the same year they released their next album, split into two half-length volumes, # and 4.

Written by Phil Klemmer and John Enbom and directed by Guy Bee, the episode premiered on UPN on February 22, 2005. The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a high school student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, Veronica is hired by a Russian mail-order bride who requests her help in finding a long-lost love. Meanwhile, Veronica must help her friend, Meg (Alona Tal) deal with a secret admirer while simultaneously guiding Logan (Jason Dohring) through the possibility that his mother, Lynn (Lisa Rinna) may still be alive.  Synopsis  Veronica talks to Logan about his mom's credit card use. Meanwhile, Duncan organizes a 1980s-themed dance. While they are talking, Meg (Alona Tal) walks up and tells her that she has a secret admirer. Meg asks for her help. Veronica walks into Mars Investigations, where a woman named Katerina asks Veronica to find her fianc√©. Katerina explains the situation‚Äîthey met online, but they have lost touch, and she thinks that he is in Neptune. Veronica asks Wallace to track one of the two boys who possibly texted Meg, and he agrees. The next day, Meg receives some flowers from her secret admirer. Veronica reports back to Katerina that they haven't found Tom (her fianc√©), but Katerina agrees to pay more. Veronica places a fake casting call to pinpoint Tom, which she does. Logan's mom's credit card shows up with another charge at a hotel. Logan and Veronica attempt to enter the room in which her mother is staying. They are denied access, but Logan decides to stake out the place until the situation is resolved. Veronica visits the flower shop, but the staff member is unhelpful. Veronica finds out that Tom's dog is named Steve and decides to track the dog down. Veronica contacts local animal hospitals and eventually finds one with a Catahoula Leopard Dog named Steve. She pretends to want to breed \\"her dog\\" with Steve, the dog's owner refuses to speak to her. Veronica visits Leo D'Amato (Max Greenfield), who agrees to call the numbers that the vet called. Meg goes to a party, but they find nothing in terms of her secret admirer. Logan continues to camp out in the hotel lobby. After Veronica appears, Logan sees someone who he thinks is his mom. However, it turns out to be Logan's sister Trina (Alyson Hannigan), with whom Logan has a tumultuous relationship. After Trina leaves, Logan breaks down crying in Veronica arms after realizing that his mother really is gone. On Keith's own insurance fraud case, he is being followed by a group of men in a silver Chevrolet. Keith eventually steals the car, also seeing that it belongs to someone named Yevgeny Sukarenko. Veronica goes back to the flower shop, bringing a sketch artist to aid the owner's memory. Leo gets back to Veronica and mentions three names. Veronica recognizes the third name and is about to call Katerina back with the news before Keith stops her. It turns out that \\"Katerina\\" is actually Yelena Sukarenko, the wife of the criminal who is actually trying to track down Tom because he testified against her husband and has changed his identity through the Witness Protection Program. Under Keith's instructions, Veronica tells Yelena a fake address. Yevgeny and his associate go into the fake address (the model home of Meg's party), where they are promptly arrested by Keith, Leo, and others. Veronica receives the copy of the sketch of the secret admirer (Duncan), although she doesn't tell Meg this. However, at the dance, Veronica allows Duncan to approach Meg. Veronica goes back to her car and breaks down until Leo appears and invites her back into the dance. Soon, the two see Logan, drunk and acting strange, charging through the room in a dress shirt and briefs. Leo kisses Veronica. Veronica receives several calls from an unknown number, which is actually a pay phone that her mom, Lianne (Corinne Bohrer), likely used. She goes to the pay phone and finds her mom. She tries to get her out of the bar before seeing Clarence Wiedman (Christopher B. Duncan) looking at them.  Cultural references  A variety of cultural references are made in the episode, particularly to pop culture in the 1980s: *The 1980s-themed dance is named after \\"Total Eclipse of the Heart\\". *Wallace and Veronica jokingly describe themselves as Best Friends Forever. *Logan compares Veronica to Jim Rockford from The Rockford Files. *Keith refers to The Love Boat. *Logan calls the hotel manager Jeeves. *Trina Echolls jokingly calls Logan and Veronica the Brat Pack. *Logan insults Trina by saying that she would take a role as an extra in CSI. *In his drunken state, Logan references \\"Everybody Have Fun Tonight\\" by Wang Chung. *Logan also states that \\"[he's] gonna party like it's 1999\\" referencing the song \\"1999\\" by Prince.

The work was compiled and arranged by Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the seventh Rabbe of Chabad, from the talks and letters of the sixth Chabad Rebbe, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn. The work was published in 1943. For each day, the calendar prescribed sections of Chumash, Tehillim, and Tanya for study that day; this practice is known in Chabad as Chitas (◊ó◊™\\"◊™). Each day's portion of Chumash is studied with the corresponding Rashi commentary. Hayom Yom contains a biographical overview of the seven Chabad Rebbes. In Hayom Yom many of Chabad customs were first published.Miller, Chaim. Turning Judaism Outward: A Biography of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson the Seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe. Kol Menachem. 2014. Page 436. The sixth Chabad Rebbe, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn described Hayom Yom as a ‚Äútruly chasidic cultural work.‚Äù Format The calendar was designed for the Chabad Hasidic year extending from 19 Kislev of the year (5703) to 18 Kislev of the following year (5704). Any teaching or narrative recorded in the first person relates to the sixth Rebbe, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn. Each mention of ‚Äúmy revered father‚Äù or ‚Äúmy revered grandfather‚Äù refers to the fifth and fourth Rebbes of Chabad, Rabbi Shalom Dovber Schneersohn and Rabbi Shmuel Schneersohn (Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak's father and grandfather). Each day's entry also noted historical events that happened on that day, or Lubavitcher customs associated with that day, and/or a short inspirational thought for the day, generally taken from the works of the sixth Lubavitcher Rebbe, Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn. In describing this work, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak wrote: \\"A book that is small in format ... but bursting with pearls and diamonds of choicest quality ... A splendid palace of Chasidism.\\" The calendar was never reissued for subsequent years, but has been reprinted many times, and is still studied.  Name  The calendar's name is taken from the words used to open the recital of the daily psalm in the Jewish morning prayer service, which begins \\"Today is the nth day of the week...\\"  Editions  A number of English translations of Hayom Yom have been published. An adaptation of Hayom Yom for children with illustrations entitled A Diamond a Day was published in 2015. A two volume commentary on Hayom Yom was authored by Chabad Rabbi Michoel Seligson. Usage In some Lubavitcher congregations, the entry for each day is read aloud after the morning service. This practice serves to provide words of guidance and inspiration as one prepares to leave the synagogue. This post- prayer reading seems to be a more common practice in Chabad communities in North and South America, and less common in Israel. Teachings Hayom Yom expounds the Chabad Hasidic theological principle of \\"continuous creation\\" as an injunction of practicality: > \\"God created the universe and all physical objects ex nihilo, \\"something > from nothing.\\" Jews must transform \\"something into nothing.\\" They must > transform materiality into spirituality‚Ä¶ This is an obligation upon every > specific individual.\\" References External links * Hayom Yom on Chabad.org (English) Category:Chabad-Lubavitch texts Category:Jewish mystical texts Category:Jewish philosophical and ethical texts Category:Books by Menachem Mendel Schneerson ","title":"Hayom Yom"},{"id":"3924102","text":"Recognition of prior learning (RPL), prior learning assessment (PLA), or prior learning assessment and recognition (PLAR), describes a process used by regulatory bodies, adult learning centres, career development practitioners, military organizations, human resources professionals, employers, training institutions, colleges and universities around the world to evaluate skills and knowledge acquired outside the classroom for the purpose of recognizing competence against a given set of standards, competencies, or learning outcomes. RPL is practiced in many countries for a variety of purposes, for example an individual's standing in a profession, trades qualifications, academic achievement, recruitment, performance management, career and succession planning. Methods of assessing prior learning are varied and include: evaluation of prior experience gained through volunteer work, previous paid or unpaid employment, or observation of actual workplace behavior. The essential element of RPL is that it is an assessment of evidence provided by an individual to support their claim for competence against a given set of standards or learning outcomes. RPL is sometimes confused with Credit Transfer, assessments conducted in order to recognize advanced standing or for assigning academic credit. The essential difference between the two is that RPL considers evidence of competence that may be drawn from any aspect of an applicant's professional or personal life. Credit Transfer and advanced standing deal primarily with an evaluation of academic performance as it relates to a particular field of study and whether or not advanced standing may be granted towards the gaining of additional qualifications. Some academic institutions include Credit Transfer within their overall RPL umbrella, as the process still involves assessment of prior learning, regardless of how achieved.  Terminology  RPL is known by many names in different countries. It is APL (Accreditation of Prior Learning), CCC (Crediting Current Competence), or APEL (Accrediting Prior Experiential Learning) in the UK, RPL in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, and PLAR (Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition) in Canada (although different jurisdictions within Canada use RPL and RCC (Recognition of Current Competence). France has a more sophisticated system in which assessment is known as Bilan de competences, Bilan des competences approfondi, or Validation de Acquis des Experiences (VAE). The United Nations UNESCO organisation has a \\"Global Convention on the Recognition of Higher Education Qualifications Project\\" to standardize terminology and definitions used in Higher Education. History RPL has been the mainstay of all assessments conducted under national vocational education and training systems since the late 1980s and continues to evolve as different vocational education and training (VET) systems evolve. The concept of RPL can be traced back to the earliest guilds when master craftsmen inspected the work of apprentices in order to determine their competence against the high standards demanded of the different professions of the period. This process was continued during the Industrial Revolution when the first formal apprentice programs were established and realistic workplaces created to train young men and women in the skills and knowledge required of their trade. It was first introduced into the UK by Susan Simosko, a consultant with the National Council for Vocational Qualifications, who adapted it as the central element of all competency-based assessments. Simosko was employed by the British government to provide support to the creation of the National Vocational Qualifications (NVQ) and Scottish Vocational Qualifications (SVQ) systems during the late 1980s and early 1990s. She introduced and managed the Access to Assessment Initiative project which introduced the concept of Accreditation of Prior Learning as an important pathway for employed and unemployed people to gain formal recognition of their skills and knowledge against standards demanded of employers across the United Kingdom. Other countries adopted the same processes when developing their own competency- based vocational education and training systems, some aligned solely with the need to assess competence in line with the needs of private and public sector organizations, and others as a critical element of the assessment of skills and knowledge in order to grant vocational qualifications. The National Training Board in Australia was one of the first outside of the UK to develop such a system as a framework for the transition towards the implementation of new apprentice programs and workplace training and assessment under the National Training Reform Agenda. RPL was incorporated under the National Framework for the Recognition of Training and has since remained an important element of all competency-based assessments. In 2015 the Canadian Association for Prior Learning Assessment (CAPLA) released guidelines for the Recognition of Prior Learning that serve to guide and enhance the assessment of learning through RPL across contexts, contribute to organizational effectiveness, and promote labour force development. Informed by stakeholders, Quality Assurance for the Recognition of Prior Learning in Canada enhances understanding of Quality Assurance issues and good practice. ‚ÄúThe manual benefits anyone working with, or on behalf of, applicants, candidates, clients, learners, or any individuals who seek: employment, professional licensure, trade certification, career coaching or counselling, job promotion or change, professional development, academic access, or advanced standing.‚Äù [4] Benefits RPL is a very simple and straightforward process of assessing someone's skills or knowledge, regardless of where and how these were learned. Unlike other forms of assessment it doesn't judge someone's evidence of competence solely by the credentials or qualifications they have achieved, although this can form part of their claim. Nor does it consider where a person worked, their age, gender or physical attributes. What RPL does is allow people to demonstrate that they are capable of undertaking specific tasks or working in certain industries based on evidence of skills and knowledge gained throughout their life. RPL is similar to criterion-referenced assessment ‚Äì assessment of skills and knowledge against certain criteria. However, while such criteria are generally less descriptive than those used in competency standards, they are outcomes-based (i.e., the outcome of somebody doing something, such as the outcome of writing is a letter, or the outcome of making something which results in an end product), not process-based such as learning. In teaching or traditional training, the criteria against which formative and summative assessments are conducted is known as teaching or training objectives. (Sometimes these are also referred to as learning objectives but these are really the outcome the learners seeks to achieve, not the teacher or trainer.) They may be written in different ways but in all cases they include the behaviour to be observed, the conditions under which such behaviour is to be performed, and the standards or criteria which the performance must meet. These are the standards to be achieved as a result of the learning or training activity. Methodology A prerequisite for RPL is a clear standard against which knowledge, performance and behaviour can be assessed. The standard may be identical to that which is used for defining the desired outcomes for formal training programmes for the same competence, and should unambiguously specify the minimum acceptable requirements for a person to be assessed as competent. Knowledge is often assessed by written or oral examination. Performance of skills is frequently assessed by direct observation of the performance of the skills and procedures in the working environment, but for some skills such as emergency responses, simulations are often used. Behavioural competence and attitude may be assessed by direct observation, inference from observation, formal examination or combinations to suit the circumstances. Checklists are often used to ensure that standard procedures are carried out in the correct order and without omitting important steps. It may be a requirement that the assessments are documented and recorded as evidence that they have been completed. See also  References 4\\\\.

Early years  Kyono claims that in his earlier years he was an MTV junky, in high school he started listening to Japanese punk like Gauze, The Stalin, Inu, and Aburadako. Then he ventured out into overseas punk like Crass and The Pop Group. Kyono's also states that the first record that he bought wasn't very 'punk inspired' as it was Electric Light Orchestra's Secret Messages. Taken from The Crazy Pill Bazaar Fansite, URL last accessed 04-28-07 In 1985 he started the Boowy inspired punk group Berrie with his high school friend Minoru Kojima (aka Shin.), and the group later was joined by bassist Takeshi Ueda and Seto. The group first a show in their senior year of school and were ventured out to Tokyo and Shinjuku. His image at this time was very punk and glam inspired and would often switch from a loud abrasive punk voice to very melodic. = The Mad Capsule Markets years = After Berrie had opened for the likes of The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Berrie became The Mad Capsule Markets. The early incarnation of mad was still very much Boowy inspired, as Kyono and the band were still very interested in the band. After years of further punk inspired material, the heavy 4 Plugs album was released. This was a big change for Kyono, as he had been listening to the likes of Fear Factory and hip hop music. Kyono's voice had become slightly gruffer, he often rapped rather than sang, and he sported skateboarder-esque clothing and a no longer had long hair. This style (and musical) change was well received by the fans, and Kyono's music taste became eclectic over the years. = Later years = Since the release of OSC DIS, his popularity as a vocalist increased, and he contributed vocals to several of Joujouka's songs, Sasori's Sasori and The Crystal Method's Weapons Of Mad Distortion (which was featured during the Dracula/Blade fight scene in Blade: Trinity). When The Mad Capsule Markets were put on hiatus on 31 March 2006 (Kyono announced this on his birthday) Kyono created the WAG DUG unity website where he often posts diary entries of his latest DJ livesets in Japan and work on other projects, such as the wag dug clothing line. His recent musical activity includes appearing on the Death Note movie soundtrack with a song he contributes vocals to called HAKAI (Deathtroy). This track also features Sid Wilson of Slipknot fame.  Wagdug Futuristic Unity  In 2007, Kyono released a mini album Nu Riot under the name of Wagdug Futuristic Unity. The album is considered as Kyono's solo project and not a new band as it featured guest appearances as opposed to a constant line up throughout the tracks. Guest appearances include; Shitdisco, Ultra Brain, Motor, DJ Starscream and Cycheouts G. In June 2008, Kyono announced that a full length album Hakai will be released on July 23, 2008. The first single will be \\"Systematic People\\" and will feature Ryo of Maximum the Hormone. \\"Systematic People\\" has also been used as the opening theme for the anime series Kurozuka (novel). In the same fashion as Nu Riot, the album will have guest appearances. This time, they include Justice, Chino Moreno (of Deftones), Ceephax, Numanoid vs. Mazda, funky gong (of joujouka), and the return of Sid Wilson and Ultra Brain. Wagdug Futuristic Unity has since released the follow up albums Ram The Crush and RAW as an actual band as opposed to the digital hardcore sound earlier material has had, and as from 2012-2013, Kyono has collaborated with the likes of DJ Baku to release the collaborative album \\"Unknown Music Allianz\\" and is a member of the Metalcore super group T.C.L (The Chunk Legend) which featured former Undown members TORUxxx and Yamada, to release the album Tremendous CLassixx.

It was a subsidiary of Delhaize America, the U.S. division of international food retailer Delhaize Group. Its headquarters was in Salisbury, North Carolina.\\"Contacts .\\" Delhaize Group. Retrieved on May 17, 2012. Bottom Dollar Food sold an assortment of both private brands and national brands at low prices. To curtail costs, the grocer offered customers the option to buy bags to sack their groceries, and also used alternative display and stocking techniques, such as cut cases on shelves. History Bottom Dollar was created by parent Delhaize America at the same time as the upscale chain Bloom in 2004. The first Bottom Dollar Food opened in High Point, North Carolina, on September 21, 2005, and eventually there were around 30 stores in North Carolina, Virginia and Maryland before the expansion into other states in 2010. Beginning in October 2010 in King of Prussia, PA, Bottom Dollar Food opened 19 stores in the Delaware Valley and Lehigh Valley areas. The first store in Philadelphia was opened on April 15, 2011. Some industry analysts believed those markets were already overstored with discount competitors such as Aldi, PriceRite and Save-A-Lot. A Philadelphia area competitor was quoted as saying :‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always challenging to be the last guy to get in the game, but unlike the other limited assortment discounters already in the market, Bottom Dollar really didn‚Äôt present itself as a deep discounter. I believe its mix of private label products with significant branded offerings sent a confusing message to shoppers. Were they trying to become a price-driven operator with decent but not great retails, or a small supermarket with good prices? Their message never seemed to connect.‚Äù In January 2012, Delhaize announced that it would close six and convert 22 others of the original southern Bottom Dollar stores to Food Lion supermarkets as part of a restructuring; the Bloom brand was also retired.Food Lion‚Äôs owner closing 126 stores, retiring Bloom banner, Washington Post, January 12, 2012List of Food Lion and other stores to be shuttered by Belgian supermarket chain Delhaize Group, Washington Post, January 12, 2012 The restructuring resulted in the Bottom Dollar name disappearing outside of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. In late February 2012, Bottom Dollar expanded into Pittsburgh and Youngstown, Ohio, neither of which have the parent Food Lion chain and are dominated by Giant Eagle. In these markets, Bottom Dollar also competed with various SuperValu-supplied stores (including low-price Save-A-Lot), Aldi, and Walmart. In spring 2013, in order to cut costs, Bottom Dollar started to require a quarter to use a shopping cart. When the quarter was inserted, the cart would be unlocked from the other carts. When the cart was returned, the customer was refunded their coin, effectively costing the customer only the time to return the cart. This was a practice also used by Aldi. Though ubiquitous in Europe, where both Aldi and Bottom Dollar's parent company Delhaize Group are headquartered, it is rare in American stores which often have employees return carts left in parking areas. In August 2014, it was learned that Delhaize wanted to sell all 66 of its remaining Bottom Dollar stores Forty-six of the stores were located in the Delaware Valley and Lehigh Valley in southern New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and 20 in the Pittsburgh-Youngstown corridor of Pennsylvania and Northeast Ohio. Bottom Dollar stores were reported to range in size from 16,848 square feet (Ambler, PA) to 30,352 square feet (Catasaqua Road, Allentown, PA), an average store being about 20,000 square feet, with weekly sales volumes from $296,800 (North Broad Street, Philadelphia, PA) to $103,000 (East Windsor, NJ), the average sales being around $150,000 weekly. Although 10 of the New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania stores were company-owned, most stores were leased, with leasehold rents are in the $10‚Äì12 per square foot range. On November 5, 2014, Delhaize Group announced they were selling the Bottom Dollar chain to Aldi, with plans to close the stores by early 2015. The stores were scheduled to close on January 15, 2015, but closed three days early on January 12 due to all the stores selling out their inventory quicker than expected.All Bottom Dollar stores closed today The Vindicator (01/13/2015) Aldi hasn't announced whether or not it will reopen any of the locations, although Pittsburgh mayor Bill Peduto is reportedly in talks with Aldi to reopen a Bottom Dollar location as an Aldi in the Pittsburgh neighborhood of Garfield, as there is no other grocery store in the neighborhood.Pittsburgh-area Bottom Dollar stores close earlier than planned WPXI (01/13/2015) Delhaize finalized the sale of the shuttered locations to Aldi on March 27, 2015,Bottom Dollar future still unknown The Vindicator (03/27/2015) with plans to reopen 30 of the locations purchased as Aldi,BREAKING NEWS  ALDI to sell or sublease four Bottom Dollar locations in Valley The Vindicator (03/27/2015) including the aforementioned location in Pittsburgh's Garfield section.Aldi to convert, reopen nine former Bottom Dollar stores in Pittsburgh region Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (03/27/2015) The remaining locations‚Äîall of which are near existing Aldi locations‚Äîwill either be flipped or sublet by Aldi.

The band's original lineup consisted of vocalist Mark Hennessy, guitarist Grant Fitch, bassist Charles Bryan, and drummer Peter Fitch. They released two studio albums ‚Äì Dragline and Death To Traitors, the B-side and outtake collection Keep The Last Bullet For Yourself and the EP Home Is A Strange Place before disbanding in 2000. On two occasions they have reunited.  History  Paw was formed in 1990 in Lawrence alongside Kill Creek and Stick. Their work from this era can best be characterized as aggressive rock with melodic undertones, or 'Southern rock' as Hennessy explained in an MTV interview. They were frequently cited by industry insiders as potentially \\"the next Nirvana\\" and a bidding war erupted to sign them. The band signed a three-album deal with A&M; Records during the height of the grunge wave, and released their first album, Dragline, in 1993. Their most well-known songs are from this period which received moderate rotation on the radio and on Headbanger's Ball, MTV's hard rock/heavy metal showcase. Music videos were made for the hits \\"Jessie\\", \\"Couldn't Know\\" and \\"Sleeping Bag\\". Paw toured the UK in 1993 supporting Tool with Headswim (months after Tool's UK support slot with Rage Against the Machine), introducing the band to an audience outside of America. The band recorded two sessions for BBC Radio 1's rock show in 1993 (during which they played the Reading Festival). Their songs \\"Jessie\\", \\"Pansy\\" and \\"The Bridge\\" (plus an alternate version of the video of the first) were used in the 3DO, PC, Sega Saturn and PlayStation versions of the video game Road Rash. In 1995, the band released its second album, Death To Traitors, on A&M; Records. During this period, the band evolved by adding more instrumental and country elements to soften their hard rock edge. The band toured Europe and the UK in early 1995, as well as touring Australia in October 1995. While the album received favorable reviews from the press, sales were less successful, and Paw was dropped by A&M; in 1996, before their contract was fulfilled. In 1998, Grant Fitch, Peter Fitch and Dan Hines formed the band Palomar and released the album World Without Horses. A reviewer described Palomar as \\"a gentler and more melodic sound than Paw.\\" Paw also released a full-length compilation of B-sides and rarities entitled Keep The Last Bullet For Yourself on their own label, Outlaw Records. Paw still played together during this period, and both World Without Horses and Keep The Last Bullet For Yourself were released on these shows. In 2000, founding members Hennessy and Fitch signed Paw with Koch Records and released the mini-album Home Is A Strange Place the same year. The new album incorporated a more pronounced southern rock element. After that they split.  Post-Paw activities  Hennessy's book of poetry, Cue the Bedlam (More Desperate with Longing Than Want of Air), was published in December 2005 by Unholy Day Press. He joinen on vocals with Mike Ratzo (bass guitar, vocals and guitar), Justin Parr (drums), Brody Buster (guitar, harmonica and keys), Heather Lofflin (vocals and guitar), James Garvic (bass guitar and guitar) and Kurt Nesbitt (bass guitar) in The Diamond Heart Club in Lawrence, from 2006-2007. They reformed under the name 1950 D.A. (without Garvic and Nesbitt) and made a 6-song EP called Low Like Planes. Around the web can be found a song by The Diamond Heart Club, under the name of \\"Track 5\\", which is instead \\"Return To Zero\\" later redone by 1950 D.A. In 2008, after being scheduled on the same bill between their post-Paw bands, Hennessy and Fitch returned and played together on June 6, 2008, at the Revival Tent at the Wakarusa Festival in Clinton Lake, Kansas. The band played its first headlining reunion show in Lawrence on Saturday, October 4, 2008, at The Bottleneck. Grant Fitch and Jason Jones formed The New Franklin Panthers, in Lawrence. They have released on Bandcamp Hot Dogs Are Cool: In III Movements on February 1, 2008 and the Circus Act EP (with Dan Hines) on January 13, 2011. Grant self-released Gman Rides Again on July 26, 2012 and re-released World Without Horses (under the name Grant Finch and Palomar). Grant is currently occupied as a Production Manager on a number of productions, including the television series The Inspectors, and the 2018 thriller Faceless, and runs a production company, Electrical Odyssey. In 2014, Mark Hennessy started Godzillionaire (with Michael Dye, Cody Romaine and Benjamin White). After releasing some demos they released in 2016 $mall ¬¢hange and in 2017 the EP the great dEPression. In November and December 2017 they took offline their sites while on legal litigation with the lawyers of the Godzilla's copyright owners, but on January 5 the band announced the litigation was over and they can still use their name. Mark Hennessy announced he would perform the whole Dragline album at The First Annual Corn King Music and Arts Festival in September. Although it was not a Paw reunion (as it was misunderstooded by fans) but a tribute by his band Godzillionaire (now a quintet with Dan Duncan), this is the actual first time he performed Paw songs since he formed Godzillionaire (and since the last Paw reunion).

Written by Diane Ruggiero and directed by Michael Fields, the episode premiered on UPN on March 29, 2005. The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a high school student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, Veronica investigates the mysterious disappearance of Neptune High's mascot, a parrot named Polly, and eventually goes undercover at Neptune High's rival, Pan High. Meanwhile, in flashbacks, Veronica deals with the aftermath of finding her mother (Corinne Bohrer).  Synopsis  Veronica searches through her stuff and finds a microphone in a pencil sharpener, suggesting that Clarence Wiedman (Christopher B. Duncan) was tracking her. Veronica waits for Wallace (Percy Daggs III) after a basketball game until Principal Clemmons pulls her aside. Principal Clemmons asks Veronica to find the school's mascot, a bird named Polly, which has recently been stolen. Veronica agrees to help under certain conditions. The principal and others think that a rival high school, Pan High, took the bird. Wallace is becoming increasingly popular and abandons Veronica at lunch. Veronica goes undercover at Pan High, but their basketball players act as surprised as Neptune's at the parrot stealing. In addition, Veronica receives news that the Pan High mascot has also been stolen. Flashing back to where the previous episode left off, Veronica confronts her mother about her feelings for Jake Kane (Kyle Secor). Lianne says that she knows Jake Kane is innocent because they were together at the time of the murder. Veronica asks Leo for the tapes of Lilly's (Amanda Seyfried) murder investigation. Back in the past, Lianne informs Veronica that the meeting was to \\"protect her.\\" Undercover at the school, everyone sees people congratulating a nerdy looking boy, Wilson on stealing the parrot, while Neptune sends a package of goat meat to the cafeteria. Veronica talks to Wilson and flirts with him, asking if he would give her a tour of Rest Stop 15 (a place where students go to park, buy and sell, etc.). Veronica catches the boy's locker combination and calls Weevil (Francis Capra) with the parrot information, and lets Weevil know of the plan to meet at Rest Stop 15. Upon arriving at Rest Stop 15, Wilson is confronted by Weevil. Wilson says that the parrot in the picture is not Neptune's mascot. Back in the past, Lianne says that she does not know Veronica's real father is, and that a paternity test would be needed. Leo (Max Greenfield) brings back the Lilly Kane investigation tapes to Veronica. At Neptune High, Veronica sits with Wallace and his new friends. Later, Wallace leads Veronica to a truck with a goat in it. Veronica listens to the interrogation tapes, and she hears Keith (Enrico Colantoni) talking to Jake Kane. Veronica sends Wallace to deliver a \\"gift\\" to Clarence Wiedman's assistant. Veronica listens to Keith's interrogation of Celeste Kane (Lisa Thornhill). That night, Veronica goes on a date with Leo before she sees Meg (Alona Tal) with Duncan (Teddy Dunn) on a double date with Jake and Celeste at the same restaurant. Flashing back one more time, Lianne reveals Celeste's knowledge of the affair. Veronica points out a mistake in Jake and Celeste's story‚ÄîLianne says they were at the hotel for 20 minutes, while Jake said they were there for 2.5 hours. Meanwhile, a Pan High student in a mask shows the Neptune people over TV that he has the parrot. The student demands that Wallace does not play or else Polly will die. Veronica talks with Meg, who says that the thug must have put in the announcement the night before. The two examine the photograph, and Veronica sees a basketball number on the person's sneakers. Veronica steals both the mascots back and frames the actual culprit‚Äîa Neptune boy who stole the parrot so he could kick Wallace out and go back to being a starter so that he could continue sabotaging his team's chances of winning the basketball game and ensure winning bets against Neptune. Veronica checks her mother into a rehabilitation center. Veronica talks to her father about her discovery that Abel Koontz (Christian Clemenson) is someone's proxy. Veronica takes out the pencil sharpener and states fakery that she knows who collected Abel Koontz's accounts. Veronica, assuming that Wallace has delivered the \\"gift\\" (which he did and had a microphone in it), listens. Clarence Wiedman asks his assistant to call Amelia DeLongpre, and Veronica finds out that Amelia is Abel Koontz's daughter.  Cultural references  A variety of cultural references are made in the episode: *Veronica references the Wildlife Alliance and the film Valley Girl. *Veronica misquotes an Academy Award speech of Sally Field. *Veronica says that the Neptune High vending machines carry Orangina. *Veronica calls herself a \\"human Google\\". *Lianne reminds Veronica about a time when she wanted to have Cyndi Lauper's haircut. *When Lianne tells Veronica that her meet-up with Jake Kane was just to talk to him, Veronica snippily replies \\"On the day all the Starbucks were closed.\\" *Wallace says that the goat ate his Air Jordans. *Veronica references the 1976 supernatural horror film Carrie. *Richie compares Rest Stop 15 as a cross between Inspiration Point, a location in Happy Days, and Tijuana. *Veronica chooses the alias \\"Betty\\" at Pan High School, which is a reference to the often at-odds characters Betty and Veronica in Archie Comics. As \\"Betty,\\" she says she is a transfer student from Riverdale. *Polly, the mascot of Neptune High, was also a reference to the sister of Betty from Archie Comics.  Arc significance  *Lianne Mars doesn't know who Veronica's father is‚Äîit could be Jake or Keith. *Lianne says that she was with Jake at the time of Lilly's murder, but that Celeste barged in. However, Celeste was only there for twenty minutes. *Veronica gets the interrogation tapes of Jake and Celeste. They both claim they were at a hotel for two and a half hours, but their stories conflict. *Veronica finds that Clarence Wiedman bugged her room, so she bugs his office and learns that Abel Koontz has a daughter, Amelia DeLongpre.  Music  The following music can be heard in the episode: *\\"Pick Up The Phone\\" by The Notwist *\\"You And Your Kind\\" by The Brown Mountain Lights *\\"A Chorus Line\\" by Ultramagnetic MC's *\\"Rabbit\\" by The Fire Marshals of Bethlehem *\\"Nothing Is Wrong\\" by The Brown Mountain Lights *\\"Fall Behind Me\\" by The Donnas *\\"Headphonland: The Gangster Chapter\\" by Mice Parade  Production  The episode was written by regular writer Diane Ruggiero and directed by Michael Fields. This episode marks Ruggiero's fifth writing credit for the show as well as Fields's second directing credit (after \\"The Wrath of Con\\"). The episode's title is a joking reference to two characters from Archie Comics: Betty Cooper and Veronica Lodge. At Pan High, Veronica calls herself \\"Betty\\" and says that she is a transfer from \\"Riverdale High\\", the name of a school and town in the comic strip. In addition, this episode features appearances by several recurring characters, including Veronica's mother Lianne (Corinne Bohrer), Duncan's parents, Celeste (Lisa Thornhill) and Jake Kane (Kyle Secor), Leo D'Amato (Max Greenfield) and Meg Manning (Alona Tal).  Reception  = Ratings = In its original broadcast, the episode received 2.33 million viewers, ranking 113th of 121 in the weekly rankings. = Reviews = The episode received mixed to positive reviews. Television Without Pity gave it a \\"B+\\". Price Peterson, writing for TV.com, gave a mixed to negative review. \\"Okay, so I got slightly bored with all the mascot stuff.\\" He also criticized the discovery of Abel Koontz's daughter, calling it \\"far-fetched.\\" However, the reviewer also wrote that \\"still though, the mythology reveals were pretty great.\\" By contrast, Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave a more positive review, praising the characterization of Veronica and Wallace as well as the movement of the Lilly Kane case. \\"But as much momentum as the Lilly Kane murder plot is picking up, I'm happy with the case-of-the-week here, too, as trifling as it may be. I like it because it's a Wallace-centered episode, probably the strongest showcase for Percy Daggs III we've had yet.\\"  References   External links  *\\"Betty and Veronica\\" at Mars Investigations * Category:2005 American television episodes Category:Veronica Mars (season 1) episodes ","title":"Betty and Veronica (Veronica Mars)"},{"id":"3924147","text":"The Missouri National Recreational River is a National Recreational River located on the border between Nebraska and South Dakota. The designation was first applied in 1978 to a 59-mile section of the Missouri River between Gavins Point Dam and Ponca State Park. In 1991, an additional 39-mile section between Fort Randall Dam and Niobrara, Nebraska, was added to the designation. These two stretches of the Missouri River are the only parts of the river between Montana and the mouth of the Missouri that remain undammed or unchannelized. The last 20 miles of the Niobrara River and 6 miles of Verdigre Creek were also added in 1991. The Missouri National Recreational River is managed by the National Park Service, with headquarters located in Yankton, South Dakota. Visitor centers are located at Ponca State Park, Niobrara State Park and the Lewis and Clark Visitor Center at Gavins Point Dam, overlooking Lewis and Clark Lake. It lies in parts of Boyd, Cedar, Dixon, and Knox counties in Nebraska, and Bon Homme, Charles Mix, Clay, Union, and Yankton counties in South Dakota. History Wreck of the steamer North Alabama.People have lived along the river for some 10,000 years.MNRR Cultural Site Archeologists have found their tools and weapons, homes, foods, religious, and ceremonial objects. The River is one of three historic east- west corridors, similar to the Oregon and Santa Fe trails. It was a pathway of American Indians, Lewis and Clark, trappers and traders, steamboat captains, and settlers. French and Spanish traders preceded Lewis & Clark's 1804 expedition. The Yellow Stone was the first steamboat to sail this stretch of the river in 1832 on the way to Fort Union Trading Post. The 1858 Treaty with the Yankton Sioux opened the southeastern portion of the Dakota Territory to white settlement. The Homestead Act of 1862 encouraged immigration into the region. During steamboat era, the Missouri was characterized by shifting channels, numerous braided channels, chutes, sloughs, islands, sandbars, and backwater areas. Well over 300 steamboats sank in the river between 1819 and 1920. By the mid-20th century, extensive flooding prompted the passage of many flood control measures. The Flood Control Act of 1944, (the Pick-Sloan Plan) created the Fort Randall and Gavins Point dams, causing major changes to the river's hydrology and habitats. Flora and fauna Along the river there are two major plant communities. The floodplain forest includes willow and cottonwood. The bluffs are covered by elm and oak. The annual floods create a variation of floodplain vegetation and succession throughout the park.MNRR Plants New deposits such as sandbars and accretions adjacent to the riverbanks are covered with the pioneer species: annual weeds, short-lived grasses, sedges, and seedling willow and cottonwood. On higher above the water table, larger willow and cottonwood trees dominate. The floodplain forest includes larger cottonwoods on the highest banks and islands. The understory in the cottonwood forest is primarily dogwood, sumac, wild grape, and poison ivy. The sparse vegetation under the mature cottonwoods consists mostly of scouring rush, Kentucky bluegrass, smooth brome, and other invasive grasses and weeds. Shown in the cross-section of shallow water around a sandbar are sand shiners (Notropis stramineus), river carpsuckers (Carpiodes carpio), and/or plains minnows (Hybognathus placitus). Above the floodplain, there is a mixed forest and agricultural fields. The forests on the adjoining bluffs are primarily hardwoods with the slopes covered by a dense growth of oak, ash, mulberry, and walnut, with burr oak as the dominant species. Wildlife is plentiful. Since the days of Lewis and Clark the larger mammals have disappeared, including the grizzly bear, bison, and elk. Small mammals, including mice, voles, bats, rats, and ground squirrels make up the bulk of the species within the park. Deer are often seen on private property along the banks.MNRR Mammals The American bald eagle has been gradually increasing throughout the park. Two other birds, the piping plover (northern Great Plains population) and the least tern (interior population), are still listed as threatened and endangered respectively. There are over 250 bird species identified within the riverway.MNR Birds =Threatened species= The National Park Service works alongside the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to help manage habitat for threatened and endangered species, especially the Piping plover, Least tern, and Pallid sturgeon. Since the establishments of the dams on the Missouri River these species and their population numbers have decreased. Habitat restoration and resource protection measures have been in place to help rebound these numbers. Often during the summer months sandbars are signed as \\"Closed\\" to help protect critical habitat, fines and other penalties can be imposed for violators.http://www.nwo.usace.army.mil/MRRP/ Things to do Map of Missouri National Recreational River Recreational and educational opportunities abound at the Missouri National Recreational River. Fishing and hunting are popular actives. Walleye and catfish are the most popular species. Canoeing and kayaking are growing in popularity, and ranger- guided excursions are scheduled often during the summer. =Parks and recreation areas= As a \\"partnership park\\", the National Park Service (NPS) works closely with local and state agencies to help manage the recreational opportunities for the public. * Goat Island, island located just downstream of Wynot, Nebraska and upstream of Vermillion, South Dakota. Development is currently under planning stages as of 2018, with development possibly including camping, trails, hunting, birding, and other public recreational opportunities. This decision was met with much objection from local river users. Public forums were held, and feedback was allegedly collected, but the plan moved on as proposed.https://home.nps.gov/mnrr/learn/management/goatisland.htm *Bow Creek Recreation Area, located near Wynot.

A related compound, clindamycin, is derived from lincomycin by using thionyl chloride to replace the 7-hydroxy group with a chlorine atom with inversion of chirality. It was released for medical use in September 1964.  Uses  Although similar in structure, antibacterial spectrum, and mechanism of action to macrolides, lincomycin is also effective against other organisms including actinomycetes and some species of Mycoplasma and Plasmodium. However, because of its adverse effects and toxicity, it is rarely used today and reserved for patients allergic to penicillin or where bacteria have developed resistance.  Clinical pharmacology  Intramuscular administration of a single dose of 600 mg of Lincomycin produces average peak serum levels of 11.6 ¬µg/mL at 60 min, and maintains therapeutic levels for 17 h to 20 h, for most susceptible gram-positive organisms. Urinary excretion after this dose ranges from 1.8% to 24.8% (mean: 17.3%). A two-hour intravenous infusion of 600 mg of Lincomycin achieves average peak serum levels of 15.9 ¬µg/mL and yields therapeutic levels for 14 h for most susceptible gram-positive organisms. Urinary excretion ranges from 4.9% to 30.3% (mean: 13.8%). The biological half-life after IM or IV administration is 5.4 ¬± 1.0 h. The serum half-life of lincomycin may be prolonged in patients with severe impairment of renal function, compared to patients with normal renal function. In patients with abnormal hepatic function, serum half-life may be twofold longer than in patients with normal hepatic function. Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are not effective in removing lincomycin from the serum. Tissue level studies indicate that bile is an important route of excretion. Significant levels have been demonstrated in the majority of body tissues. Although lincomycin appears to diffuse in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), levels of lincomycin in the CSF appear inadequate for the treatment of meningitis.  Biosynthesis  Lincomycin is an antibiotic classified as a member of the lincosamide class, which typically features a L-proline amino acid derivative linked through amide group with an eight- carbon aminothio sugar . The two units 4-propyl-L-proline and the amino- octose, are each synthesized separately, and are then condensed by LmbD protein, and then further postcondensation reactions involving cleaving of mycothiol, deacetylation, and S-methylation finally yield lincomycin. The biosynthesis of the amino acid moiety of lincomycin, starts with tyrosine which is transformed to 4-propyl-L-proline by the consecutive action of LmbB1, LmbB2, LmbW, LmbA and LmbX proteins. 4-Propyl-L-proline is activated by LmbC and loaded into LmbN, a bifunctional peptidyl carrier protein, and is ready for condensation by LmbD. The biosynthetic pathway for production of the amino-octose moiety is almost fully elucidated although the order of the steps still needs further research. Condensation through a transaldolase (LmbR) of ribose 5-phosphate (C5) with fructose 6-phosphate or sedoheptulose-7-phosphate (providing a C3 unit) forms the octose (C8). Further transformations involving isomerization (LmbN), 1-phosphorylation (LmbP), 8-dephosphorylation (LmbK), guanosine diphosphate attachment at position 1 (LmbO), 4-epimerization (LmbM), 6-oxidation (LmbL), amination (LmbS), imine reduction (LmbZ) and 8-reduction, are performed to construct the amino-octose unit. LmbT protein exchange GDP by ergothioneine and the condensation with 4-propyl-L-proline and catalysed by LmbD can occur. The amide-linked product between the amino acid and the amino- octose bound to ergothioneine is then the substrate of LmbV, which substitute ergothioneine by mycothiol. The mycothiol moiety is then cleaved by LmbE, and the product is further processed by LmbIH, LmbQ, LmbJ, LmbF and is finally sulphur methylated by LmbG, to afford lincomycin.  Spectrum of susceptibility  Lincomycin is a narrow spectrum antibiotic with activity against Gram-positive and cell wall-less bacteria including pathogenic species of Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and Mycoplasma. Lincomycin is used to treat severe bacterial infections in patients who cannot use penicillin antibiotics. Lincomycin shows weak activity against most Gram-negative bacteria. The following represents susceptibility (MIC) data for a few pathogenic bacteria: * Staphylococcus aureus - 0.2 ¬µg/mL - 32 ¬µg/mL * Streptococcus pneumoniae - 0.05 ¬µg/mL - 0.4 ¬µg/mLhttp://www.toku-e.com/Assets/MIC/Lincomycin%20HCl%20EP.pdf * Streptococcus pyogenes - 0.04 ¬µg/mL - 0.8 ¬µg/mL See also *Lincosamides  References  Category:Lincosamide antibiotics Category:Pfizer brands ","title":"Lincomycin"},{"id":"3924203","title":"Pyranose"},{"id":"3924214","text":"Cairness House viewed from the south Cairness House, south of Fraserburgh in the County of Aberdeenshire, is a country house in Buchan built in the Neoclassical style. It was constructed between 1791 and 1797 to designs by architect James Playfair and replaced an earlier house of 1781 by Robert Burn, which was in part incorporated into the Playfair scheme. Sir John Soane assisted in the final stages of the construction following Playfair‚Äôs death in 1794. The park was laid out by Thomas White, a follower of Lancelot 'Capability' Brown. The Pevsner Architectural Guide for Aberdeenshire North and Moray states that \\"Cairness House, by James Playfair 1791-97, is of international importance as the only house in Britain the design and construction of which reflected and evolved with the rapid advances in French Neoclassicism towards the end of the C18\\" and that \\"its survival is the more precious as so many of Playfair's other designs were either not built or have been lost or altered\\". History Cairness House was commissioned by Charles Gordon of Cairness and Buthlaw, a descendant of the Barclays of Cairness through his mother. The House was part of a estate that included the village of St. Comb‚Äôs and the Loch of Strathbeg. The second laird, Major-General Thomas Gordon (1788‚Äì1841), a good friend of Lord Byron, was a hero of the Greek War of Independence and wrote a celebrated history of the conflict. The Gordon family sold the estate in 1937 to the Countess of Southesk. During the Second World War, the house was rented to the Consolidated Pneumatic Tool Company of Fraserburgh to provide evacuation premises for their London head office. After the Second World War, the house was used as a farmhouse and gradually fell into serious decline. The park was destroyed from the early 1950s onwards with the mass clearance of trees in order to reclaim land for agricultural use. In 1991, the house was listed as a Building at Risk by the Scottish Civic Trust. A major long-term restoration programme of the house and grounds was instigated by new owners in 2001. In 2009, the project won the Georgian Group Architectural Awards prize for best Restoration of a Georgian country house in Britain. The Georgian Group stated that: \\"From being a moribund building at risk riddled with dry rot, Cairness is now a magnificent private home.\\" The prize was given by HRH Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester at a ceremony at Christie's,London in November 2009. Cairness House is designated a category A listed building. and the grounds are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland. Architecture Cairness House: The Hemicycle from the east. The structure is and encloses two pavilions and courtyards at the back Considered one of the finest examples of Neoclassical architecture in Britain, Cairness House shows the influence of the French architects √âtienne-Louis Boull√©e and Claude Nicholas Ledoux and has many parallels with the works of Sir John Soane. The design incorporates a complex mixture of Masonic and pagan symbols as well as many numerological and architectural conceits. It is a calendar house, and its ground plan shows an adjoining \\"C\\" and \\"H\\", variously standing for Cairness House and Charles Gordon. Constructed in finely detailed granite ashlar, Cairness House consists of a main block, flanked by two raised \\"bookend\\" wings. A tetrastyle pedimented Roman Doric porch sits to the centre, its unjointed columns hewn from menhirs taken from a nearby druids' temple. A pair of lower pavilions with representations of the Masonic Altar adjoin at the back. From these spans a huge semicircular service wing, with a central bell tower above a lunette arch, enclosing a courtyard at the rear of the house. The centre of the courtyard is dominated by a round ice house modelled on the Temple of Vesta in Rome. The main roof is surmounted by 51 cast iron chimney pots in the shape of fluted Doric columns. The interiors are boldly Neoclassical with fine examples of simulated marble walls, pendentive or coffered ceilings and Greek key friezes. The Egyptian Room was the first of its kind in Britain and contains elaborate hieroglyph plasterwork. The Entrance Hall features a columbarium fireplace with anthemion antefixes. James Playfair also drew plans for gates and a pair of small lodges for the entrance to the driveway. However, the gates and lodges were not built until 100 years later to celebrate the centenary of Cairness House. The gates, railings and lodges come under a separate Category A listing by Historic Environment Scotland. The pillars on either side of the gates feature a pair of sphinxes.

History Map of the hospitals of Paris in 1820 In 1606, Marie de M√©dicis invited the Brothers Hospitallers of St. John of God to come to France. The Abbot of Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s granted them the use of its former Saint-P√®re chapel, which they repaired. They were later given the chapel and its attached cemetery outright. In 1613, work started on the construction of major hospital structures. The old chapel was demolished and a new one was established in July 1621 by the Archbishop of Embrun. It was renovated in the middle of the 17th century, and in 1732 it received its great portal designed by the architect Jules-Robert de Cotte.Adolphe Lance, Dictionnaire des architectes fran√ßais, 1872 (full text at archive.org) The rue Turenne fa√ßade was designed by Destouches.Encyclop√©die, volume 6, p. 364. The chapel still stands at the corner of the boulevard Saint-Germain and the rue des Saints-P√®res. The French National Academy of Medicine had its offices in this chapel from 1850 to 1902. The original buildings of the H√¥pital de la Charit√© were demolished around 1935 to make place for the new Facult√© de m√©decine de Paris. The 18th-century French physician and encyclop√©diste Louis-Anne La Virotte (1725‚Äì1759) worked at the h√¥pital in 1758. In the late 18th-century, the hospital became an important institution for clinical instruction; Louis Desbois de Rochefort (1750-1786) started a bedside instruction that focused on the patient's symptoms and physical signs as diagnostic indicators, marking a major development in the history of medicine in France. Rochefort was succeeded by his assistant Corvisart in 1788, who questioned the traditional humoral theory, and employed more physical methods such as palpitation and percussion.

The nonprofit BPF is an affiliate of the international Fellowship of Reconciliation working toward global disarmament and peace, helping individuals suffering under governmental tyranny in places such as Burma, Bangladesh, Tibet and Vietnam. Currently headquartered in Oakland, California, BPF was incorporated in 1978 in Hawaii by Robert Baker Aitken, his wife Anne Hopkins Aitken, Nelson Foster, Ryo Imamura and others. Shortly after other notable individuals joined, including Gary Snyder, Alfred Bloom, Joanna Macy and Jack Kornfield. Generally speaking, the BPF has a tendency to approach social issues from a left-wing perspective and, while the fellowship is nonsectarian, the majority of its members are practitioners of Zen. BPF is currently led by codirectors Katie Loncke and Dawn Haney and a national board of seven individuals. About The Buddhist Peace Fellowship is a grassroots movement established in 1978 by Robert Baker Aitken and Anne Hopkins Aitken, along with Nelson Foster and others, on the front porch of their Maui Zendo in Hawaii. Sitting around a table, the assembled group discussed nuclear weapons and militarism within the United States in the years following the Vietnam War, finding that these issues must be addressed with compassion from a Buddhist perspective in order to bring about peace. Original members were centered primarily in Hawaii or the San Francisco Bay Area, and by 1979 the group had roughly fifty members. To stay connected, the group formulated a newsletter spearheaded by Nelson Foster which evolved into Turning Wheel‚Äîthe quarterly magazine published by the BPF. Today, Turning Wheel Media is an online home for activists and thinkers, writers and readers, a place to bring Buddhist teachings into conversation with the world. By the late 1980s the association had hundreds of members, and the headquarters had moved to office space in Berkeley, California. During this time much of their work was geared toward human rights efforts in areas of the world such as Cambodia, Vietnam and Bangladesh, working particularly hard at freeing Buddhist prisoners of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam. This period in BPF history also was marked by the hiring of a coordinator and the development of national chapters. BPF went through a turbulent period after longtime executive director Alan Senauke left at the end of 2001. After two executive directors who served less than a year and a period of no clear leadership, board member Maia Duerr was asked to lead the organisation in 2004. During her three-year tenure, the BPF stabilised its finances, and considerable effort were made to bolster its nationwide outreach and include chapters in decision-making processes. Also during this period, Duerr led two \\"Buddhist Peace Delegations\\" to Washington, D.C., to call for an end to war in Iraq. Since 2012, Co-Directors Katie Loncke and Dawn Haney have supported the organisation's \\"Radical Rebirth\\" as one focused on present-day issues of racial justice, climate change, and militarisation. > The Buddhist Peace Fellowship appeals to Westerners who have embraced > Buddhism and who also believe that their chosen path must address the > pressing issues of the day.

It provides a platform for lively debate, lifts up Buddhist perspectives on current events, guides inspired readers to groups already taking action, and brings Buddhist teachings into conversation with the world. =The System Stinks: Curriculum for Buddhist Activists= Designed to help promote collective liberation and subvert the highly individualistic bent of much mainstream dharma these days, in 2013 Buddhist Peace Fellowship began offering The System Stinks ‚Äî a collection of Buddhist social justice media named for the favourite protest sign of one of BPF's founders, Robert Aitken, Roshi. In 2013, the curriculum covered a systemic take on The Five Precepts - violence, theft, sexual misconduct, lying, and intoxication. In 2014, The System Stinks reviewed the Buddha's core teachings on The Four Noble Truths, from seasoned practitioners like Mushim Ikeda, Maia Duerr, Zenju Earthlyn Manuel, and Alan Senauke, as well as newcomers like Funie Hsu and Faith Adiele. Starting in 2015, The System Stinks will cover teachings on The Three Dharma Seals - impermanence, non-self, and liberation. Former Projects =Buddhist Alliance for Social Engagement= The Buddhist Alliance for Social Engagement (BASE) is an extension of the Buddhist Peace Fellowship established in 1995, offering training and internship programs based on the model set forward by the Jesuit Volunteer Corps for social workers, activists and human service workers. It has chapters in various cities in the United States, including Berkeley, California and Boston, Massachusetts, aiming to help professionals integrate their work with Buddhist practice. The idea behind BASE was originally conceived of by Robert Baker Aitken during discussions at a BPF meeting held in Oakland, California in 1992, although it was Diana Winston who ultimately saw this vision through. She was somewhat disheartened to find that many of the BPF members were not actively engaged in meditation, so she set out to develop a \\"training program that would integrate Buddhist practice, social engagement, and community life into one organic whole.\\" > BASE is meant to provide for lay American Buddhists the kind of > institutional support for the cultivation of socially engaged Buddhism > available to Asian monks and nuns who are part of a monastic sangha.

They oppose the implementation of capital punishment and also offer prisons information on chaplaincy opportunities. The committee's founding director was Diana Lion, who also has served as associate director of the Buddhist Peace Fellowship. > ...the BPF Prison project...is attempting to transform the prison system > through reforming the prison-industrial complex, abolishing the death > penalty, and bringing the teachings of \\"dharma\\" to those persons confined in > prisons and jails... ‚Äî =Buddhist AIDS Project= In 1993 the Buddhist AIDS Project (BAP), based in San Francisco, California was founded, a non-profit affiliate of the BPF run entirely by volunteers, serving individuals with HIV/AIDS, those who are HIV positive, their families, and their caregivers.Buddhist aids project =Think Sangha= Environmentalism =Green Sangha= Activist activities On Hiroshima Day of August 6, 2005 the Tampa, Florida chapter of BPF organised The Hiroshima Memorial in conjunction with Pax Christi, designed to raise consciousness about the issue of nuclear war.

Publication history Zookeeper first appeared in Teen Titans #13-15 (Sep. - Nov. 2004) and was created by Geoff Johns and Tom Grummett. Fictional character biography Dr. Samuel Register worked with Mark and Marie Logan in Africa. He despised their rambunctious son Garfield who constantly caused damage in his lab. He was (and still is) obsessed with people calling him \\"Dr. Register\\" and nothing else.Teen Titans vol. 3 #14 (October 2004) After Logan's parents successfully cured Garfield of Sakutia, Register went on to try to finish their work. He became mad for results and inhumanly slaughtered animals in experiments which produced grotesque mutations. This earned him the nickname \\"Zookeeper\\".Teen Titans vol. 3 #13 (September 2004) In the \\"Beast Boys and Girls\\" storyline, Register stole a sample of Sakutia to try to mutate it like Garfield's parents did. He accidentally infected himself and every kid in San Francisco, and the infection turned his skin purple. When Beast Boy was infected, the virus in him was canceled out and he was cured. Zookeeper injected venom from the Sydney funnel-web spider into Garfield and attempted to dissect and extract the cure to Sakutia from him. Cyborg and the other Titans kept Register busy while Raven healed Beast Boy. Wanting to stop Zookeeper desperately, Garfield reinfected himself with Sakutia. His powers back to speed, Beast Boy fought and defeated Zookeeper in a shapeshifting battle. He also found a way to cure the kids that were infected. Apparently, Register is immune to Sakutia like Beast Boy.Teen Titans vol. 3 #15 (November 2004) During the Villains United Infinite Crisis Special, Mammoth broke Zookeeper out of prison. He then joined Alexander Luthor, Jr.'s Secret Society of Super Villains.Villains United: Infinite Crisis Special Some time later, Zookeeper was recruited by Superboy- Prime as part of a new version of the Legion of Doom.Teen Titans vol. 3 #98 Powers and abilities Zookeeper can turn into any animal at will, just like Beast Boy. However, his side effects are different from Garfield's. His skin is purple and scaly and his eyes and hair did not change color with his skin.

One biographical portrait begins \\"Among the titans of science, Arthur Pardee is especially intriguing.\\" There is hardly a field of molecular biology that is not affected by his work, which has advanced our understanding through theoretical predictions followed by insightful experiments. He is perhaps most famous for his part in the 'PaJaMo experiment' of the late 1950s, which greatly helped in the discovery of messenger RNA. He is also well known as the discoverer of the restriction point, in which a cell commits itself to certain cell cycle events during the G1 cycle. He did a great deal of work on tumor growth and regulation, with a particular focus on the role of estrogen in hormone-responsive tumors. He is also well known for the development of various biochemical research techniques, most notably the differential display methodology, which is used in examining the activation of genes in cells. More recently he championed the acceptance and adoption of the conceptual review as a valuable approach to unearthing new knowledge from the enormous stores of information in the scientific literature. He died in February 2019 at the age of 97.Arthur B. Pardee Career Pardee received his Bachelor of Science degree from the University of California, Berkeley in 1942 while his Masters (1943) and PhD (1947) degrees were earned at the California Institute of Technology under the mentorship of Linus Pauling, who he considered to be the greatest chemist of the 20th century. Pardee did postdoctoral work at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison before returning to Berkeley as an instructor in biochemistry in 1949. In the 1950s, he was on a sabbatical with Francois Jacob and Jacques Monod in Paris. In 1961 Pardee became Professor in Biochemical Sciences at Princeton University while in 1975 he moved to Boston to become Professor of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School as well as Chief for the Division of Cell Growth and Regulation at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. In 1981, Pardee became a founding member of the World Cultural Council. Pardee became an emeritus professor at Dana-Farber in 1992. He became a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1968. PaJaMo While on sabbatical with Francois Jacob and Jacques Monod, Pardee was involved in an experiment that became known as PaJaMo. The PaJaMo experiment, and later work with his student Monica Riley showed that protein synthesis from a gene could begin almost as soon as the gene entered an E.coli cell. Prior hypotheses around the translation of genetic information into proteins had focused on ribosomes, which turned over too slowly to enable the rapid synthesis seen in PaJaMo. This led to the hypothesis that yet another RNA species existed, messenger RNA. The restriction point In the early 1970s Pardee identified that the cell cycle has a point in the 'G1 phase' where the cell, as it were, 'commits' to moving to the 'S phase'. Pardee published on this so-called 'restriction point', sometimes called the 'Pardee point', in 1974. Students Pardee's students included Allan Wilson, who gained his PhD at Berkeley under Pardee's supervision in 1961. Monica Riley was also a Ph.D. student with Pardee and contributed to his studies of mRNA.

An electric spark is an abrupt electrical discharge that occurs when a sufficiently high electric field creates an ionized, electrically conductive channel through a normally-insulating medium, often air or other gases or gas mixtures. Michael Faraday described this phenomenon as \\"the beautiful flash of light attending the discharge of common electricity\\".Faraday, Experimental Researches in Electricity, volume 1 paragraph 69. The rapid transition from a non-conducting to a conductive state produces a brief emission of light and a sharp crack or snapping sound. A spark is created when the applied electric field exceeds the dielectric breakdown strength of the intervening medium. For air, the breakdown strength is about 30 kV/cm at sea level. Experimentally, this figure tends to differ depending upon humidity, atmospheric pressure, shape of electrodes (needle and ground-plane, hemispherical etc.) and the corresponding spacing between them and even the type of waveform, whether sinusoidal or cosine-rectangular. At the beginning stages, free electrons in the gap (from cosmic rays or background radiation) are accelerated by the electrical field. As they collide with air molecules, they create additional ions and newly freed electrons which are also accelerated. At some point, thermal energy will provide a much greater source of ions. The exponentially- increasing electrons and ions rapidly cause regions of the air in the gap to become electrically conductive in a process called dielectric breakdown. Once the gap breaks down, current flow is limited by the available charge (for an electrostatic discharge) or by the impedance of the external power supply. If the power supply continues to supply current, the spark will evolve into a continuous discharge called an electric arc. An electric spark can also occur within insulating liquids or solids, but with different breakdown mechanisms from sparks in gases. Sometimes, sparks can be dangerous. They can cause fires and burn skin. Lightning is an example of an electric spark in nature, while electric sparks, large or small, occur in or near many man-made objects, both by design and sometimes by accident. History Benjamin Franklin drawing an electric spark to his finger from a key suspended from a kite string. Around 600 BC, Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus observed that amber could be electrified when rubbed with a cloth and attract other objects and produce sparks. In 1671, Leibniz discovered that sparks were associated with electrical phenomena. In 1708, Samuel Wall performed experiments with amber rubbed with cloth to produce sparks. In 1752, Thomas-Fran√ßois Dalibard, acting on an experiment proposed by Benjamin Franklin, arranged for a retired French dragoon named Coiffier in the village of Marly to collect lightning in a Leyden jarMichael Brian Schiffer, Draw the Lightning Down: Benjamin Franklin and Electrical Technology in the Age of Enlightenment. University of California Press, p 164 thus proving that lightning and electricity were equivalent. In Franklin's famous kite experiment, he successfully extracted sparks from a cloud during a thunderstorm. Uses Gas stove burner - the electric spark flame igniter is shown at the left. Spark transmitter used for ship to shore communication up to 10 km (c. 1900).\\" =Ignition sources= Electric sparks are used in spark plugs in gasoline internal combustion engines to ignite fuel and air mixtures. The electric discharge in a spark plug occurs between an insulated central electrode and a grounded terminal on the base of the plug. The voltage for the spark is provided by an ignition coil or magneto that is connected to the spark plug with an insulated wire. Flame igniters use electric sparks to initiate combustion in some furnaces and gas stoves in place of a pilot flame. Auto reignition is a safety feature that is used in some flame igniters that senses the electrical conductivity of the flame and uses this information to determine whether a burner flame is lit. This information is used to stop an ignition device from sparking after the flame is lit or restart the flame if it goes out. =Radio communications= A spark-gap transmitter uses an electric spark gap to generate radio frequency electromagnetic radiation that can be used as transmitters for wireless communication. Spark gap transmitters were widely used in the first three decades of radio from 1887-1916\\\\. They were later supplanted by vacuum tube systems and by 1940 were no longer used for communication. The wide use of spark-gap transmitters led to the nickname \\"sparks\\" for a ship's radio officer. =Metalworking= Electric sparks are used in different kinds of metalworking. Electric discharge machining (EDM) is sometimes called spark machining and uses a spark discharge to remove material from a workpiece. Electrical discharge machining is used for hard metals or those that are difficult to machine with traditional techniques. Spark plasma sintering (SPS) is a sintering technique that uses a pulsed direct current that passes through a conductive powder in a graphite die. SPS is faster than conventional hot isostatic pressing, where the heat is provided by external heating elements. =Chemical analysis= The light that is produced by electric sparks can be collected and used for a type of spectroscopy called spark emission spectroscopy. A high energy pulsed laser can be used to produce an electric spark. Laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is a type of atomic emission spectroscopy that uses a high pulse energy laser to excite atoms in a sample. LIBS has also been called laser spark spectroscopy (LSS). Electric sparks can also be used to create ions for mass spectrometry. Hazards An electric spark produced by a stun gun. At 150,000 volts, the spark can easily jump a gap greater than an inch (2.5 cm). Sparks can be hazardous to people, animals or even inanimate objects. Electric sparks can ignite flammable materials, liquids, gases and vapors. Even inadvertent static-discharges, or small sparks that occur when switching on lights or other circuits, can be enough to ignite flammable vapors from sources like gasoline, acetone, propane, or dust concentrations in the air, such as those found in flour mills or more generally in factories handling powders.An Introduction to Physical Science by James Shipman, Jerry D. Wilson, Charles A. Higgins, Omar Torres -- Cengage Learning 2016 Page 202Dust explosion electrostatics hazardshttps://powderprocess.net/Safety/Electrostatics_Risks_ATEX_DSEAR.html Sparks often indicate the presence of a high voltage, or \\"potential field\\". The higher the voltage; the farther a spark can jump across a gap, and with enough energy supplied can lead to greater discharges such as a glow or an arc. When a person is charged with high-voltage static-charges, or is in the presence of high-voltage electrical supplies, a spark can jump between a conductor and a person who is in close enough proximity, allowing the release of much higher energies that can cause severe burns, shut down the heart and internal organs, or even develop into an arc flash. High-voltage sparks, even those with low energy such as from a stun gun, can overload the conductive pathways of the nervous system, causing involuntary muscle-contractions, or interfere with vital nervous-system functions such as heart rhythm. When the energy is low enough most of it may be used just heating the air, so the spark never fully stabilizes into a glow or arc. However, sparks with very low energy still produce a \\"plasma tunnel\\" through the air, through which electricity can pass. This plasma is heated to temperatures often greater than the surface of the sun, and can cause small, localized burns. Conductive liquids, gels or ointments are often used when applying electrodes to a person's body, preventing sparks from forming at the point of contact and damaging skin. Similarly, sparks can cause damage to metals and other conductors, ablating or pitting the surface; a phenomenon which is exploited in electric etching. Sparks also produce ozone which, in high enough concentrations, can cause respiratory discomfort or distress, itching, or tissue damage, and can be harmful to other materials such as certain plastics.Management of Hazardous Energy: Deactivation, De-Energization, Isolation, and Lock-out By Thomas Neil McManus -- CRC Press 2013 Page 79--80, 95--96, 231, 346, 778, 780Electrostatic Hazards by G√ºnter Luttgens, Norman Wilson -- Reed Professional and Educational Publishing Ltd. 1997 See also *Corona discharge *Electrical breakdown *Paschen's law *Static electricity References  External links  * Szikrakis√ºl√©s (1)...(4) Electric spark (1)...(4).

The authors, both Freemasons, present a theory of the origins of Freemasonry as part of their \\"true story\\" of the historical Jesus and the original Jerusalem Church. Key points in theory The authors claim that their work proves the following: * Freemasonry can trace its roots to the death of the Egyptian king Sequenenre in 1570 B.C. at the hands of the Hyksos. * Moses merged this event with Sumerian and Egyptian mythology, symbols and philosophy, to create a putative 'royal line'. * Solomon incorporated these symbols into his temple * Jesus and the Qumran community used a ritual based on this story * The early Roman Church effectively suppressed the original beliefs of this Jerusalem Church. * The Knights Templar, discovering the Qumran communities' records in the vaults under the Temple in Jerusalem, transported them to Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland. * When Scotland became unsafe for the Templars, they incorporated their beliefs and history into the rituals of Freemasonry as it is known today. Synopsis Knight and Lomas begin by quoting Henry Ford, who was a Freemason,http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/ford_h/ford_h.html as saying \\"all history is bunk\\". They express the belief that, though Ford's statement may be abrupt, it is accurate, as history is often not a completely accurate and comprehensive account of facts, but only what the dominant or orthodox view of the time has recorded for posterity. The authors make their case through the use of dialectics. The technique requires the reader to accept a basic premise, and then proceeds in a logical order; requiring the reader to weigh the merit of each step on the way to a conclusion. If the initial premise, and each of the steps in logic towards the conclusion have merit, the conclusion can represent a legitimate, possible explanation. The authors of The Hiram Key propose a possible sequence of events that led to modern Freemasonry, although much of their narrative has been debated by historians and other researchers. A criticism of their approach by those unfamiliar with the science of \\"dialectical progression\\" is that the authors have gathered irrelevant and often unevidenced 'facts' to arrive at an equally unproven theory. Even those familiar with the application of dialectics may concede that the conclusion of such logic is only as good as its weakest link. All Historical study is based on dialectical appraisal of evidence, and all sources of information subject to interpretation as the \\"weakest link.\\" Knight and Lomas are not professional historians nor have they any qualifications in history or research, and their case is open to the criticism that they accept references that fit their theory and reject those that conflict with it. . Nonetheless they argue in the book that the foundations of the Christian religion are a distortion by the early Roman Catholic Church of the teachings of the real Jesus and his followers. They claim to have found in Freemasonry a new 'key' to unlock the secrets of civilization. This key is also the key to the origins of Christianity and, they assert, proves that many of the beliefs of modern Religion may well have come to be, at least partly, through imprecise historical interpretation. Knight and Lomas state that one of the main motivations in writing the book stemmed from a desire to ascertain the origins of Freemasonry, following their own experiences of being initiated into it. Did it arrive, fully formed at the foundation of the Premier Grand Lodge of England on 24 June 1717, or was that the first public acknowledgement of something much older? One widely held theory is that Freemasonry evolved out of guilds of stonemasons. Traditional Masonic ritual claims that one of the first Freemasons was Hiram Abiff, a widow's son from the tribe of Naphtali, who was the Architect of King Solomon's Temple. His name has never been recorded as such historically, although there is a similar character in the Old Testament of the Bible, who is not named, but is described as a widow's son, in the First Book of Kings. Although not apparently named in some translations of the bible, others, such as the Coverdale translation and the original Martin Luther translation do indeed refer to him as \\"Hiram Abiff\\" or as \\"Huram Abi\\". The word \\"abi\\" is translated as \\"father\\" or \\"my father\\" in other translations whilst the Luther and Coverdale translations treated it as a personal name. The Jewish Study Bible suggests that the word \\"father\\" is an honorific title applied to a skilled craftsman. The use of \\"abu\\" meaning \\"father\\" as an honorific is still used in the Middle East today, hence \\"Abukir\\" named after \\"Father\\" or Saint Cyril. The book's authors claim that the stonemason-origin theory could be discounted because it had so many apparent fallacies. Why would powerful and rich people have been attracted to join a fraternity that came from poor and uneducated stonemasons' Guilds? The theory of Freemasonry originating in London in 1717 is also regarded as unlikely, because there are earlier mentions of Freemasonry in other locations. The authors concluded that Freemasonry was actually as old as it claimed in its traditional ritual, dating back to the building of King Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem Knight and Lomax claim to have analysed their sources rigorously, including the Old Testament and New Testament of the Bible, ancient Jewish texts, the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Gnostic Gospels, and Masonic rituals to support their conclusions. They note the global significance of religion and that any major refutation of commonly held beliefs would meet resistance from the established and orthodox authorities in any particular religion. In support of that point Knight and Lomax cite the treatment of the Dead Sea Scrolls. They note that, 40 years after their discovery, only about half of the available material had ever been published or made available for independent review. It was not until 1991 that public access restrictions were lifted. The scrolls contained various versions of Biblical texts, all of which were more than 1000 years older than the oldest surviving Hebrew texts that were produced by Aaron ben Moses ben Asher in AD 1008. The texts of these scrolls are believed by the authors to have been written by ancestors of the same Qumran community of the Judaean hills that found them. The authors also believe that the Qumran Community were Essenes, and that they and the Nasoreans and the original Jerusalem Church were all one and the same. That is, the ancient Qumranians were the first Christians. They decided that the story of Hiram Abiff was actually based on the initiation ceremonies of the ancient kings of Egypt. They also came to the conclusion, after analysis of the New Testament, the Gnostic Gospels, and Masonic ritual, that Jesus and the original Christians were thoroughly different from what the Roman Catholic Church and orthodox Christianity has taught they were. The authors believe that Jesus did not claim to be divine, but was instead a messiah in the Jewish sense of the term, a good man and a freedom fighter, trying to liberate the Jews from Roman occupation. The authors do not claim that the Christianity is incompatible with the ideals and goals of Freemasonry. Neither do they claim that the Jewish Faith or the Muslim faith or Buddhist faith are incompatible with the tenets of Freemasonry. Although The Hiram Key highlights some inconsistent historical references within various dogmas, they do not claim dogma to be devoid of value to humanity. The book is more an examination of historical references rather than an examination of religion. Jesus did not claim to work miracles, according to the authors. When Jesus claimed to have raised Lazarus from the dead, it was intended as an allegorical reference; followers were referred to as the \\"living\\" and others were referred to as the \\"dead\\" in certain Jewish esotericism of the time. Similarly, Jesus' turning water into wine merely meant elevating people to a higher status within the framework of the sect. The authors believe that Jesus' sect, the Jerusalem Church, operated some kind of \\"quasi-Masonic\\" initiation ceremonies and develop that line of thought to claim that Jesus was thus, in a sense, a Freemason. In Chapter 5 of the Hiram Key, Jesus Christ: Man, God, Myth, or Freemason?, the authors state: \\"We realise that this is a statement that will offend many Christians, and particularly many Roman Catholics,\\" but the conclusion they came to, based upon historical context derived outside the accepted religious context, was that Jesus was a Freemason. Controversy The book contains a radical hypothesis about the origins of Freemasonry, seeking to demonstrate a heritage back through the Knights Templar to the Jerusalem Church and Pharaoic Egypt, claiming to draw on a wide range of material to support this hypothesis. The work has been subject to criticism from within the established body of masonic-research, based on: *Creeping assertion - caveats on statements are reduced as the statements are used as foundation for further development. *Lack of critical assessment of sources. *Use of symbolic ritual as a statement of historic fact. Quatuor Coronati Lodge No 2067 the principal Lodge of Masonic research under the United Grand Lodge of England, has criticised the book as Pseudohistory,Neville Barker Cryer, Ars Quatuor Coronatorum, Volume 109, 1996. and some Masonic libraries categorise the volume as fiction.

Retrieved on January 12, 2011. \\"The News Journal, 950 West Basin Road, New Castle, Delaware 19720.\\" and is owned by Gannett. History The ancestry of the News Journal reflects the mergers of several newspapers. It is dated to Oct. 1, 1866 when Howard M. Jenkins and Wilmer Atkinson started the afternoon publication Daily Commercial. In 1877, that paper was absorbed into a rival, the Every Evening, founded by Georgetown native William T. Croasdale. The Evening Journal, later owned by the Du Pont family, was founded in 1888 as a competitor to the Every Evening. The two papers merged in 1933. Another predecessor to the News Journal was the Morning Herald, founded in 1876 by Philadelphia lawyer John O'Byrne. It later became the Daily Morning News, bought by Alfred I. Du Pont in 1911. For most of the 20th century, the Du Pont family owned these two Delaware newspapers, The Morning News and The Evening Journal. Ownership of both papers was consolidated in 1919 when feuding factions of the family reconciled, forming the News Journal Company. DuPont decided to sell The News Journal Company in 1978. Gannett won the bidding war, beating the Hearst Corporation and The Washington Post Company. Gannett paid $60 million for the two Delaware papers and merged them in 1989 to form one paper, The News Journal.Confessions of an SOB by Al Neuharth. 1989. In 2010, The News Journal Company became The News Journal Media Group in an effort to collectively identify their extensive product portfolio of print, digital, video and new media. Most recent circulation statements show The News Journal daily circulation at 26,550 (Issue Date: August 21, 2019) and Sunday circulation at 39,375 (Issue Date: August 25, 2019). Coverage area The News Journal covers New Castle County most in-depth, but also offers considerable coverage of the Delaware General Assembly and the Delaware beaches. The paper also offers limited coverage of northeast Maryland and southeast Pennsylvania, mostly by means of short news briefs. The paper publishes national and international articles from wire services.

The once-daily update has evolved into as-it- happens online news coverage that often results in a couple dozen news updates per day. DelawareOnline.com was the first newspaper in the country to offer a morning and afternoon online newscast, with anchor Patty Petite. DelawareOnline.com was cited in a 2008 Wilkerson and Associates study as the site Delawareans visit first for news and entertainment. More than one million unique visitors are recorded each month. As of July 2020, the Delaware Online Facebook page had more than 200,000 followers. Community involvement The News Journal participates in the Newspapers for Education program, which provides free newspapers for area schools. On Fridays during the school year, the paper publishes an informational feature for school children, in the form of colorful, pull-out, double-truck page in the Life section. In 2006, The News Journal provided Glasgow High School a $10,000 grant to help the school's newspaper, The Dragon Fire. The News Journal also sent editors to Glasgow to help the Dragon Fire with page layout and web design. The News Journal Company also runs the Needy Family Fund, which partners with local charities to assist family in need of food and clothing. Each Christmas season, The News Journal asks readers to donate to the fund, and publishes a list of those who do.

From 2004 - 2015, it has been produced by Mattel, as of 2016, it was licensed back to Hasbro. The game is played with two teams, using cards on each side of which a topic heading is printed, followed by a list of 10 items that fall under the given topic. The object is to guess the items that were chosen for inclusion on the card, given the topic. One of the two teams, with all of its players free to speak at the same time, attempts to guess as many of the 10 listed items as it can before the timer runs out. The team receives as many points as successful guesses, plus a bonus determined by a roll of dice. The first team to get 60 points wins. A special viewer is used that prevents the card from being read (other than the topic heading) until it is placed in the viewer. This invisibility enables a team to pass. As many as 3 times during the game, a team has the option before playing or passing on the first topic offered. If the team chooses to pass, it must then accept the next topic drawn, while the other team will have to play the passed-on topic on its next turn.

This macabre account of desperate family infighting eventually leads to a tragic conclusion. Although the father in the story is a novelist, the tale concentrates far more on his family relationships than on his special concerns as a writer, though some of those concerns affect the outcome. Plot summary The narrator of the story, a somewhat naive American admirer of English novelist Mark Ambient, visits the writer at his home in Surrey. The narrator is very enthusiastic about Ambient's work, especially his latest novel Beltraffio. He meets Ambient's beautiful but chilly wife, his sickly seven-year-old son Dolcino, and his strange sister Gwendolyn. He also learns that Ambient's wife strongly dislikes her husband's novels and considers them corrupt and pagan. Dolcino eventually becomes much more ill. In order to \\"protect\\" him from what she sees as the baleful influence of his father, Ambient's wife withholds the boy's medicine. Dolcino dies, and the details of his mother's conduct are told to the narrator by Gwendolyn. The mother, grief-stricken over her role in Dolcino's final illness, dies herself after a few months. In a grimly ironic note to conclude the story, the narrator says Ambient later revealed that his wife had become partially reconciled to his novels and even read Beltraffio in the weeks before her death. Key themes When James was mulling over this story in his Notebooks, he wondered if the tale would be \\"too gruesome\\" and \\"too unnatural.\\" The double dose of mortality at the end of the story may seem extreme, but James narrates events so smoothly--even with touches of humor, especially about Ambient's bizarre, arty sister--that readers may accept the catastrophe as perhaps not inevitable but somewhat believable. In the Notebooks James said he based the story on the real-life marriage of John Addington Symonds, an English art historian, poet, and proponent of homosexuality who was constantly quarreling with his very proper wife. The contrast of an esthetic point of view, carried \\"even to morbidness\\" (to use James's own words), with a more rigid, traditionalist stance creates the story's intense atmosphere of conflict. The tragic outcome might seem perverse and even silly when considered as part of a supposedly realistic story. But at least James prepares thoroughly for the conclusion with an extensive treatment of the discord in the Ambients' marriage. Critical evaluation Critic Robert Gale, in an odd echo of James' own comments in the Notebooks, called this story \\"morbid,\\" and that verdict has found some agreement among other critics. Most commentators concede that James narrates the harsh events powerfully, and that he makes the conclusion as convincing as anybody could. Ambient's weird sister has also been much appreciated as a clever satire on the self-consciously \\"artistic\\" personality. The crux for the reader is whether Ambient's wife is really capable of showing such disregard for her son's suffering, in a wildly misguided belief that the boy is better off dead than corrupted by his father's influence. While Mrs. Ambient is shown as rather cold and overly prim, she may not be convincing as such a monster to her own child. The reservations that James himself expressed about the tale's \\"unnatural\\" plot might be all too valid.

Michael Carr of the Liberal Democrats won election at his third attempt. The seat, based largely on the market town of Clitheroe, had previously been safely Conservative but at the time the controversial Margaret Thatcher's \\"Poll Tax\\" policy was used by opposition parties against the Conservative candidate. The tax was abolished soon afterwards by Thatcher's successor John Major, who had succeeded Thatcher on her resignation in November 1990.

Early life Ngei was born at Kiima Kimwe near Machakos township, Kenya. He was the grandson of paramount chief Masaku after whom the town and the district were named. The family moved from Kiima Kimwe to a new settlement at Kangundo Division in a small village called Mbilini in 1929. This was a mountainous area with good rainfall for agriculture. His father had been converted to Christianity by the Africa Inland Mission. Ngei attended primary school at DEB Kangundo from 1932, intermediate school at Kwa Mating'i in Machakos town from 1936, and Alliance High School in Kiambu District. He then joined the army in the King's African Rifles (KAR) for a four-year stint. After that he enrolled at Makerere University in Uganda as a journalism student from 1948‚Äì1950. Anti-colonial activism The anti-colonial movement gathered momentum in Kenya in the 1940s. A political upsurge led to the Mau Mau rebellion, which involved several tribes: the Luos, Nandis, Maasai, Kamba, Kikuyus, Merus and Embus. The declaration of a state of emergency in October 1952 led to the arrest of Ngei, Jomo Kenyatta and others. Ngei earned Kenyatta's undying friendship when, during their imprisonment in Lodwar, Ngei physically stopped a colonial jailer from beating up Kenyatta by seizing the whip and challenging the jailer to beat him (Ngei) first. The \\"Kapenguria Six\\" included Fred Kubai, Bildad Kaggia, Achieng Oneko and Kung'u Karumba. The last surviving member, Oneko, died on 9 June 2007.Daily Nation, 10 June 2007: Achieng Oneko dies, aged 87 Mashujaa Day, which until recently was known as Kenyatta Day, is a national holiday in Kenya held every year to commemorate the detention of the six on 20 October 1952.Kenya Times, 23 October 2005: Kenyatta Day a sad reminder of Kenya's distorted history They were released nine years later, in 1961, two years before Kenya gained independence.The Standard, 16 August 2004: The following year Ngei established the African People's Party. Ngei's history generates much interest when examined within the context of these post-World War II protest politics that eventually ushered in independence for Kenya. These were protest politics characterised by party politics and violence as was manifested by the Mau Mau rebellion. Ngei lived and actively participated in both of these facets of Kenya's historical trajectory. He came from the Akamba people of Kenya, who were the driving force behind a political protest against the British in 1937 led by Samuel Muindi Mbingu. Government positions Ngei was the Kangundo Constituency MP from 1969 to 1990.Center for Multiparty Democracy: Politics and Parliamentarians in Kenya 1944‚Äì2007 He served throughout the Jomo Kenyatta government from 1964‚Äì1978 as a cabinet minister and in the post-Kenyatta government led by President Daniel arap Moi from 1978‚Äì1990 where he held several ministerial positions. In 1990 he was ruled bankrupt by court and consequently had to give up his parliamentary seat. Funeral Ngei died in August 2004 at the age of 81 after suffering from diabetes.The Standard, 16 August 2004: A mausoleum was built in Mbilini, Kangundo, the constituency he had served for 27 years, by the Kenyan government and unveiled in 2006.The Standard, 12 August 2006: MP accuses Government of neglecting freedom heroes On 20 October 2016, the president of the Republic of Kenya unveiled a statue in honour of Paul Ngei at Chumvi town which is in the junction that leads to Machakos from the Mombasa Highway.

The course thus allows non-law students to convert to law after university (exceptions exist for non-graduates depending on circumstances); it is also commonly known as a \\"law conversion course\\". Regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority, the course is designed as an intense programme covering roughly the same content as a Law degree LL.B (Hons) and the main goal is to allow people with a greater variety of educational backgrounds into the legal profession. Most GDL/PGDL courses award a diploma and are thus often titled Common Professional Examination (CPE). Common post-nominal abbreviations include LL.Dip (Lex. Legis Diploma), or Dip.Law (Diploma in Law). The GDL/PGDL is one (full-time) or two (part-time) years long, and successful candidates may proceed to either the Legal Practice Course (LPC) for solicitors or the Bar Professional Training Course (BPTC) for barristers. It is regulated by the Law Society of England and Wales with admissions handled through the Central Applications Board. Some law students study for four years (rather than three years, although this is usually only the case for students taking a combined law degree with the LPC, or for those whose courses include study abroad), making it possible for both non-law and law graduates of the same starting year to finish at the same time, with the CPE providing the \\"foundations of legal knowledge\\".

He is most well known for his work on modal logic, particularly his joint text with Dana Scott published posthumously (Lemmon and Scott, 1977). Biography Lemmon attended King Edward VII SchoolSchool magazine, 1947 in Sheffield until 1947, before reading Literae humaniores at Magdalen College, Oxford, as an undergraduate, and was appointed Fellow of Trinity College, Oxford, in 1957. In 1963, following a visiting professorship in Texas, Lemmon emigrated to the United States to lecture at the Claremont Graduate School (now Claremont Graduate University). Lemmon died from heart failure while climbing. Modal logic John Lemmon became interested in modal logic when Arthur Prior visited Oxford University in 1956 to give the John Locke lectures, later published as his Time and Modality (Prior 1957). Prior returned for twelve months soon after, to lead a small group including Lemmon, Peter Geach and Ivo Thomas (Copeland 2004). John Lemmon became one of the early champions of Prior's distinctive approach to tense logic, and Lemmon's later work on alethic modality and applications of modal logic to ethics bear the mark of Prior's influence. At this time, Lemmon published a treatment of alethic and epistemic modalities which introduced some systems of non-normal modal logics that have proven to have had lasting interest, the alethic system S0.5 and the epistemic systems E1‚ÄìE5 linked to the systems S0.5 and Lewis's system S2‚ÄìS5, but which lack the law of necessitation (Lemmon 1957). Lemmon was a pioneer of the modern approach to the semantics of modal logic, particularly through his collaboration with Dana Scott, but also became interested in the rival algebraic semantics of modal logic that follows more closely the kind of semantics found in the work of Tarski and J√≤nsson.

In recent times holograms have been increasingly used as trade marks in the marketplace. However, it has traditionally been difficult to protect holograms as trademarks through registration, as a hologram was not considered to be a 'trademark'. This issue was addressed by the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, which broadened the legal definition of trademark to encompass \\"any sign...capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings\\" (article 15(1)). Despite the recognition which must be accorded to holograms trademarks in most countries in other fields of the art, the graphical representation of such marks sometimes constitutes a problem for trademark owners seeking to protect their marks, and different countries have different methods for dealing with this issue. Registration of hologram marks in different jurisdictions =Canada= In Canada, hologram trademarks are generally not acceptable if they cannot be represented graphically or if they are regarded as more than one mark, see first external link. =European Union= In the European Union, Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 40-94 of 20 December 1993 (\\"signs of which a Community Trade Mark may consist\\") relevantly states that any CTM may consist of \\"any signs capable of being represented graphically...provided that such signs are capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings\\". In Sieckmann v German Patent Office (case C-273/00) the EcJ states that graphical representation, preferably means by images, lines or characters, and that the representation must be clear, precise, self-contained, easily accessible, intelligible, durable and objective. This definition generally encompasses only very simply structured holograms, and therefore an applicant for a CTM may use one photograph or some views to graphically represent their trade mark, see first external link. =United States= In the United States, the trademark manual for examination requires under 1202.14 that a hologram used in varying forms does not function as a mark in the absence of evidence that consumers would perceive it as a trademark. See In re Upper Deck Co., 59 USPQ2d 1688 (TTAB 2001), where the Board held that a hologram used on trading cards in varying shapes, sizes, and positions did not function as a mark, because the record showed that other companies used holograms on trading cards and other products as anti-counterfeiting devices, and there was no evidence that the public would perceive applicant's hologram as an indicator of source. The Board noted that \\"the common use of holograms for non-trademark purposes means that consumers would be less likely to perceive applicant's uses of holograms as trademarks.\\" 59 USPQ2d at 1693. Therefore, in the absence of evidence of consumer recognition as a mark, the examining attorney should refuse registration on the ground that the hologram does not function as a mark, under ¬ß¬ß1, 2 and 45 of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß1051, 1052 and 1127. Generally, if a hologram has two or more views, the examining attorney should also refuse registration under ¬ß¬ß1 and 45 of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß1051 and 1127, on the ground that the application seeks registration of more than one mark. In re Upper Deck, supra. See TMEP ¬ß807.01. Provided the applicant can demonstrate that the use of a hologram or moving image both serves as a mark and is not functional, an application for such a mark may be made to either register. That being said, Examining Attorneys are instructed to refuse an application for registration of a hologram if the applicant does not provide evidence of consumer recognition of the hologram as a mark. the applicant seeking registration of a hologram must submit a drawing of the mark that captures the dimensions thereof. Further, Examiners are instructed to refuse registration of any holograms that show two different images on the grounds that the application is seeking protection for two separate marks. Further, the application must include detailed written description of the mark. During publication the drawing pages for these marks are published and thereafter the drawing page is incorporated into the registration certificate which is made available at the USPTO as well as the USPTO website, see first external link.

Mukhannathun, especially those in the city of Medina, are mentioned throughout the ahadith and in the works of many early Arabic and Islamic writers. During the Rashidun era and first half of the Umayyad era, they were strongly associated with music and entertainment. During the Abbasid caliphate, the word itself was used as a descriptor for men employed as dancers, musicians, or comedians. In later eras, the term mukhannath was associated with the receptive partner in gay sexual practices, an association that has persisted into the modern day. Khanith is a vernacular Arabic term used in some parts of the Arabian Peninsula to denote the gender role ascribed to males who function sexually, and in some ways socially, as women. The term is closely related to the word mukhannath. Etymology The origins of the term are disputed. The 8th century lexicographer Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al- Farahidi connected mukhannath to khuntha, meaning hermaphrodite. Based on this etymology, he stated that the word mukhannath refers to an intersex person. According to the 9th century Arabic scholar Abu Ubayd, the term mukhannath instead derives from the verb khanatha, meaning \\"to fold back the mouth of a waterskin for drinking\\", indicating some measure of being languid or delicate. This definition attained prominence among Islamic scholars until medieval times, when the term came to be associated with homosexuality. Mentions in the ahadith Mukhannathun existed in the pre-Islamic and early Islamic eras. A number of ahadith indicate that mukhannathun were used as male servants for wealthy women in the early days of Islam, due to the belief that they were not sexually interested in the female body. These sources do not state that the mukhannathun were homosexual, only that they \\"lack desire\\". Various ahadith say Muhammad cursed the mukhannathun and their female equivalents, mutarajjilat, and ordered his followers to remove them from their homes. :The Prophet (May peace be upon him) cursed effeminate men (mukhannathan) and women who imitated men, saying: Put them out of your houses, and put so-and-so out. According to one hadith, this incident was prompted by a mukhannath servant of Muhammad‚Äôs wife Umm Salama commenting upon the body of a woman. This comment may have convinced Muhammad that the mukhannathun were only pretending to have no interest in women, and therefore could not be trusted around them. name=\\"Irregularity\\"> This story places the incident around the time of the Siege of Ta'if. However the scholars say that this only refers to those mukhanathun who are pretending and not actually lacking desire for women. As for those who are not pretending, they are allowed to enter upon women. https://www.islamweb.net/ar/fatwa/184811/ Early Islamic literature rarely comments upon the habits of the mukhannathun. It seems there may have been some variance in how \\"effeminate\\" they were, though there are indications that some adopted aspects of feminine dress or at least ornamentation. One hadith states that a Muslim mukhannath who had dyed his hands and feet with henna (traditionally a feminine activity) was banished from Medina, but not killed for his behavior. Other ahadith also mention the punishment of banishment, both in connection with Umm Salama‚Äôs servant and a man who worked as a musician. Muhammad described the musician as a mukhannath and threatened to banish him if he did not end his unacceptable career. Beyond these incidents, there are few sources elaborating upon the mukhannathun during Muhammad‚Äôs lifetime. In later eras In the Rashidun and Umayyad eras, various mukhannathun of Medina established themselves as celebrated musicians. One particularly prominent mukhannath with the laqab Tuways (\\"little peacock\\") was born in Medina on the day Muhammad died. There are few sources that describe why Tuways was labeled a mukhannath, or what behavior of his was considered effeminate. No sources describe his sexuality as immoral or imply that he was attracted to men, and he is reported to have married a woman and fathered several children in his later life. While he is described as non-religious or even frivolous towards religion in many sources, others contradict this and portray him as a believing Muslim instead. His main association with the label seems to come from his profession, as music was mainly performed by women in Arab societies. Tuways is described as the first mukhannath to perform \\"perfect singing\\" characterized by definitive rhythmic patterns in Medina. He was also known for his sharp wit and his skill with the tambourine, which had previously been associated only with female musicians. Some scholars believe that Tuways and other mukhannathun musicians formed an intermediary stage in the social class most associated with musical performance: women in pre- Islamic times, mukhannathun in the Rashidun and early Umayyad caliphates, and mainly non-mukhannath men in later time periods. While many still disapproved of the mukhannathun in general in this era, the musicians among them were nonetheless valued and prized for their skill. Some of the more well-known mukhannathun also served as go-betweens and matchmakers for men and women. While Tuways is typically described as the leading mukhannath musician of Medina during his lifetime, historical sources describe others who served a similar role providing musical and poetic entertainment. A man with the laqab al-Dalal (\\"the coquettish\\") is mentioned as one of Tuways‚Äô pupils. He is portrayed as a witty but sometimes crude man who \\"loved women\\" but did not have sex with them. Unlike Tuways, some tales involving al-Dalal do suggest that he was attracted to men. Persecution and decline While sporadic persecution of mukhannathun dates back to the time of Muhammad, their large- scale governmental persecution began in the Umayyad caliphate. This may have been prompted by \\"a perceived connection between cross-dressing and a lack of proper religious commitment\\", according to the scholar Everett K. Rowson. Some sources associate the beginning of severe persecution with Marwan I and his brother Yahya, who served as a governor under the caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, while others put it in the time of Abd al-Malik‚Äôs son, Al-Walid I. The governor of Mecca serving under al-Walid is said to have ‚Äúissued a proclamation against the mukhannathun‚Äù, in addition to other singers and drinkers of wine. Two mukhannathun musicians named Ibn Surayj and al-Gharid are specifically named as being impacted by this proclamation, with al-Gharid fleeing to Yemen and never returning. Like al-Dalal, al-Gharid is portrayed as not just \\"effeminate\\" but homosexual in some sources. Beyond these two men, relatively little is known of the mukhannathun of Mecca, compared to the more well-known group in Medina. The most severe instance of persecution is typically dated to the time of al-Walid's brother and successor Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik. According to several variants of this story, the caliph ordered the full castration of the mukhannathun of Medina. Some versions of the tale say that all of them were forced to undergo the procedure, while others state that only a few of them were; in the latter case, al-Dalal is almost always included as one of the castrated mukhannathun. Some variants of the story add a series of witticisms supposedly uttered by the mukhannathun prior to their castration: :Tuways: ‚ÄúThis is simply a circumcision which we must undergo again.‚Äù :al-Dalal: ‚ÄúOr rather the Greater Circumcision!‚Äù :Nasim al-Sahar (‚ÄúBreeze of the Dawn‚Äù): ‚ÄúWith castration I have become a mukhannath in truth!‚Äù :Nawmat al-Duha: ‚ÄúOr rather we have become women in truth!‚Äù :Bard al-Fu'ad: ‚ÄúWe have been spared the trouble of carrying around a spout for urine.‚Äù :Zillal-Shajar (‚ÄúShade Under the Trees‚Äù): ‚ÄúWhat would we do with an unused weapon, anyway?‚Äù After this event, the mukhannathun of Medina begin to fade from historical sources, and the next generation of singers and musicians had few mukhannathun in their ranks. Rowson states that though many details of the stories of their castration were undoubtedly invented, ‚Äúthis silence supports the assumption that they did suffer a major blow sometime around the caliphate of Sulayman.‚Äù By the days of the Abbasid caliph al-Mamun, the mukhannathun working as entertainment were now more associated with court jesters than famed musicians, and the term itself seems to have become synonymous with an individual employed as a comedian or pantomime. The Abbasid caliphs al-Mamun and al-Mutawakkil employed a famed mukhannath named Abbada as an actor in comedic plays. He served as a buffoon whose act depended upon mockery and \\"low sexual humor\\", the latter of which involved the flaunting of his \\"passive homosexuality\\". These characteristics would define mukhannathun in later eras, and they never regained the relatively esteemed status they held in the early days in Medina. Religious opinions The eighth-century scholar Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri stated that one should pray behind mukhannathun only in cases of necessity. Some thirteenth and fourteenth-century scholars like an-Nawawi and al-Kirmani classified mukhannathun into two groups: those whose feminine traits seem unchangeable, despite the person‚Äôs best efforts to stop them, and those whose traits are changeable but refuse to stop. Islamic scholars like Ibn Hajar al-‚ÄòAsqalani stated that all mukhannathun must make an effort to cease their feminine behavior, but if this proved impossible, they were not worthy of punishment. Those who made no effort to become less \\"effeminate\\", or seemed to \\"take pleasure in (his effeminacy)\\", were worthy of blame. By this era, mukhannath had developed its association with homosexuality, and Badr al- Din al-Ayni saw homosexuality as \\"a more heinous extension of takhannuth\\", or effeminate behavior. Ibn 'Abd al-Barr stated that mukhannathun in his era were \\"known to be promiscuous\\", and resembled women in \\"softness, speech, appearance, accent and thinking\\". These mukhannathun were the ones initially allowed to be the servants of women, as they did not demonstrate any physical attraction to the female body. Modern views While sometimes classified as transgender individuals, mukhannathun as a group do not fit neatly into any one of the prevailing categories of gender or sexuality used by modern LGBT communities. Although they were probably not predominantly cisgender or heterosexual, it cannot be said that they were simply either homosexual males or transgender women. There was too much variety between one mukhannath and the next to determine a specific label for their gender or sexual identity, and the term's meaning changed over time. Likewise, while some mukhannathun are said to have engaged in homosexuality, others did not, complicating efforts to label them gay men. According to Muhsin Hendricks: In the late 1980s, Mufti Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy of Egypt issued a fatwa supporting the right for those who fit the description of mukhannathun to have sex reassignment surgery. Tantawy seems to have associated the concept with hermaphroditism or intersex individuals. Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran issued similar fatwas around the same time. Khomeini's initial fatwa concerned intersex individuals as well, but he later specified that sex reassignment surgery was also permissible in the case of transgender individuals. Because homosexuality is illegal in Iran but transgenderism is legal, some gay individuals have been urged to undergo the surgery and transition into the opposite sex, regardless of their actual gender identity. According to the fatwa website islamqa.info: In Pakistan, the hijras are officially recognized as a third gender that is neither male nor female, a concept that some have compared to mukhannathun. Some modern Islamic authorities say that if an individual deemed a khuntha or intersex has an unclear gender, it is not permissible for him to marry a woman until a medical professional confirms that he is male.

Written by Carolyn Murray and directed by Nick Marck, the episode premiered on UPN on April 5, 2005. The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a high school student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, after finding out about Abel Koontz's (Christian Clemenson) daughter, Amelia DeLongpre (Erin Chambers), Veronica tracks her down and tells her that the Kanes are paying off her father. Meanwhile, Veronica investigates the mysterious harasser of Sabrina Fuller (Megan Henning).  Synopsis  After the revelation in the previous episode, Veronica researches Amelia DeLongpre and finds out that she lives in L.A and that all the payout money is coming to her. Meanwhile, Clarence Wiedman (Christopher B. Duncan) visits Amelia's roommate, who says that she disappeared with Veronica. Veronica takes Amelia to a secluded hotel where she will not be found. Veronica asks Amelia to fix the situation by telling people that he was paid off to cover up the murderer of Lilly Kane (Amanda Seyfried), although Amelia doesn't know that Abel is dying. Later, Veronica is dealing with midterm exams. Veronica meets another student, Sabrina, who is dealing with harassment, supposedly from an ex-boyfriend, Caz Truman (Zachery Ty Bryan). Veronica agrees to help for the money. Veronica talks to Caz, but he denies it vehemently. At Mars Investigations, Logan (Jason Dohring) gives Veronica a check for looking for his mother, but she rips the check apart. Veronica goes back to Amelia's hotel room, and Amelia tells the story of her parents' divorce. Veronica visits Sabrina and reports that she's found nothing. Later, Veronica notices a yellow truck lurking around her house and Caz is in it. However, he still denies the harassment, claiming that he's just looking out for her the same as Veronica is. Amelia asks Veronica to arrange a visitation with her father, despite the fact that she doesn't know about her father's illness. A rival detective, Vinnie Van Lowe (Ken Marino), offers to give Veronica and Keith some of his cases. Veronica goes to a ceremony for a scholarship dedicated to Lilly. Knowing what she knows now, Veronica imagines potential situations for Lilly's murder. Veronica goes to the spot where Lilly was murdered. Sabrina points out Hamilton Cho (Leonard Wu), who has recently beat out Sabrina for valedictorian, and Veronica investigates him. Veronica puts a tracker on Hamilton's car. Clarence Wiedman visits Keith (Enrico Colantoni), asking if he knows where Amelia DeLongpre is, but he denies it. That night, Veronica talks to Keith and reveals that she's still on the case, although Keith is as far along on the case as she is. Keith says that he believes that Jake Kane (Kyle Secor) called Clarence Wiedman after he discovered Lilly's body. Sabrina calls Veronica reporting a car alarm that won't stop. Veronica talks to Logan and reveals Duncan's (Teddy Dunn) epilepsy. Logan tells her that one time, Duncan, in an epileptic fit, he almost killed Jake. Veronica begins to suspect that Vinnie Van Lowe is behind the Sabrina case as she has tracked the car alarm to his ex-wife. Veronica plants a video tracker in his office, but Veronica suddenly figures out that Hamilton Cho's father hired Vinnie to harass Sabrina without his son's knowledge. In the end, Hamilton gives up the valedictorian race, but he is okay with it. Amelia has the settlement papers at her hotel before he is interrupted by Clarence Wiedman, who says that Veronica is a fraud. When Keith and Veronica go to the hotel room, they find Clarence, who says that Amelia has finalized the settlement and left. To cheer her up, Keith shows Veronica his evidence for the Lilly Kane case. Keith flashes back to his first interview with Jake and Celeste (Lisa Thornhill), where he found out that they were going through a load of laundry, despite the fact that the pair have two full-time housekeepers. Keith found a soccer uniform in the dryer, suggesting that Duncan (a soccer player) had killed Lilly and they were washing Duncan's uniform to remove the blood.  Arc significance  *Amelia DeLongpre has money, thinking that it's from a stock owned by Abel Koontz, when it's actually money Jake Kane paid him to confess. *Clarence Wiedman tracks Amelia down before she can give Veronica the papers showing Jake Kane paid Abel off and tells Amelia that her father is dying (something which Veronica did not tell her). Amelia leaves with money that Clarence gives her. *Keith tells Veronica that Jake Kane called Clarence Wiedman before he reported the murder and that as he was talking to Jake and Celeste right after the body was found, the dryer buzzed. Inside the dryer was a soccer uniform (presumably Duncan's, implicating him as Lilly's murderer).  Music  Several songs can be heard in the episode: *\\"Breakin'\\" by The Music *\\"Dangle\\" by The Daylight Titans *\\"Dragonfly\\" by M. Craft *\\"Ain't That a Kick in the Head?\\" by Dean Martin *\\"Private Eyes by Hall & Oates\\" (sung by Ken Marino as Vinnie Van Lowe)  Production  The episode was written by Carolyn Murray and directed by Nick Marck. \\"Kanes and Abel's\\" marks Marck's third directing credit (after \\"The Girl Next Door\\" and \\"An Echolls Family Christmas\\"). The episode features the first appearance by recurring character Vinnie Van Lowe (Ken Marino), who later starred in The State and Party Down, the latter of which series creator Rob Thomas co-created. In the episode, character Amelia DeLongpre (Erin Chambers) is seen watching the 1981 fantasy film Clash of the Titans, which features recurring guest star Harry Hamlin, who portrays Aaron Echolls on the show, in one of his first starring and best-known roles. The episode's title, a play on the biblical figures Cain and Abel, refers to several characters in the show‚Äîthe Kane family and Abel Koontz. Around the airing of this episode, Veronica Mars was renewed for a second season.  Reception  = Ratings = In its original broadcast, \\"Kanes and Abel's\\" received 2.78 million viewers, ranking 105th of 122 in the weekly rankings and marking an increase in 450,000 viewers. = Reviews = The episode received primarily positive reviews. Television Without Pity gave the episode a \\"B\\". Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, praised Veronica's ethical ambiguity in the episode as a story device. \\"The result to take away here is that no matter what, the structures of power are set up that our perky blonde detective heroine can't really win. She can succeed. She can get close. But achieving a satisfactory result? In the world of the '09ers, that appears to be impossible.\\" Price Peterson, writing for TV.com, gave a relatively positive review. \\"I was so relieved that this episode solved one of my biggest annoyances of the show so far‚ÄîKeith's reluctance to involve Veronica.\\" However, the reviewer also wrote that \\"[he wasn't] sure if he cared too much about Sabrina's plight.\\"  References   External links  *\\"Kanes and Abel's\\" at Mars Investigations * Category:2005 American television episodes Category:Veronica Mars (season 1) episodes ","title":"Kanes and Abel's"},{"id":"3924665","text":"Barrett Charles Brooks (born May 5, 1972 in St. Louis, Missouri) is a former American football offensive tackle.

Servers compared  Each of these DNS servers is an independent implementation of the DNS protocols, capable of resolving DNS names for other computers, publishing the DNS names of computers, or both. Excluded from consideration are single-feature DNS tools (such as proxies, filters, and firewalls) and redistributions of servers listed here (many products repackage BIND, for instance, with proprietary user interfaces). DNS servers are grouped into several categories of specialization of servicing domain name system queries. The two principal roles, which may be implemented either uniquely or combined in a given product are: * Authoritative server: authoritative name servers publish DNS mappings for domains under their authoritative control. Typically, a company (e.g. \\"Acme Example Widgets\\") would provide its own authority services to respond to address queries, or for other DNS information, for www.example.int. These servers are listed as being at the top of the authority chain for their respective domains, and are capable of providing a definitive answer. Authoritative name servers can be primary name servers, also known as master servers, i.e. they contain the original set of data, or they can be secondary or slave name servers, containing data copies usually obtained from synchronization directly with the primary server, either via a DNS mechanism, or by other data store synchronization mechanisms. * Recursive server: recursive servers (sometimes called \\"DNS caches\\", \\"caching-only name servers\\") provide DNS name resolution for applications, by relaying the requests of the client application to the chain of authoritative name servers to fully resolve a network name. They also (typically) cache the result to answer potential future queries within a certain expiration (time-to-live) period. Most Internet users access a recursive server provided by their internet service provider to locate internet hosts such as www.example.com. = BIG-IP DNS = F5 Networks product offers DNS as an authoritative server, recursive and adds additional security measures. Key advantage is to use the same application delivery controller to support DNS and application acceleration. = BIND = BIND is the de facto standard DNS server. It is a free software product and is distributed with most Unix and Linux platforms, where it is most often also referred to as named (name daemon). It is the most widely deployed DNS server. Historically, BIND underwent three major revisions, each with significantly different architectures: BIND4, BIND8, and BIND9. BIND4 and BIND8 are now technically obsolete and not considered in this article. BIND9 is a ground-up rewrite of BIND featuring complete DNSSEC support in addition to other features and enhancements. Internet Systems Consortium started development of a new version, BIND 10. Its first release was in April 2010, but ISC involvement concluded with the release of BIND 10 version 1.2 in April 2014. ISC cited a lack of resources to continue development of BIND 10, and they reaffirmed their commitment to BIND9.http://www.isc.org/blogs/isc-concludes- bind-10-development-with-release-1-2-project-renamed-bundy/ The BIND 10 codebase continues on as an open source project at http://bundy-dns.de/ (ibid.) It is not included in this comparison at this time. = Cisco Network Registrar = CNR includes a commercial DNS server from Cisco Systems usually used in conjunction with the CNR DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server. It supports high rates of dynamic update. = CoreDNS = CoreDNS is the recommended DNS serverhttps://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer- cluster/dns-custom-nameservers/ for Kubernetes and graduated from the CNCF in 2019. = Dnsmasq = Dnsmasq is a lightweight, easy to configure DNS forwarder, designed to provide DNS (and optionally DHCP and TFTP) services to a small-scale network. It can serve the names of local machines which are not in the global DNS. Dnsmasq accepts DNS queries and either answers them from a small, local cache or forwards them to a real, recursive DNS server. It loads the contents of /etc/hosts, so that local host names which do not appear in the global DNS can be resolved. = djbdns = Djbdns is a collection of DNS applications, including tinydns, which was the second most used free software DNS server in 2004. It was designed by Daniel J. Bernstein, author of qmail, with an emphasis on security considerations. In March 2009, Bernstein paid $1000 to the first person finding a security hole in djbdns. The Source code is not centrally maintained and was released into the public domain in 2007. As of March 2009, there are three forks and more than a dozen patches to add additional features to djbdns. = Knot DNS = Knot DNS is a free software authoritative DNS server by CZ.NIC. Knot DNS aims to be a fast, resilient DNS server usable for infrastructure (root and TLD) and DNS hosting services. Knot DNS supports DNSSEC signing and among others hosts root zone (K and L Root_name_servers), several top-level domains. = Knot Resolver = Knot Resolver is a caching full DNS resolver https://www.knot-resolver.cz/ from CZ.NIC, written in C and Lua and is available as free software. Knot Resolver is a sibling project of Knot DNS, each of them is independent and serves a different purpose. Knot Resolver is used by Cloudflare for 1.1.1.1, its free DNS service. = MaraDNS = MaraDNS is a free software DNS server by Sam Trenholme that claims a good security history and ease of use. In order to change any DNS records, MaraDNS needs to be restarted. Like djbdns dnscache, the MaraDNS 2.0 stand-alone recursive resolver (\\"Deadwood\\") does not use threads. = Microsoft DNS = Windows DNS Server http://www.microsoft.com/dns component of Microsoft DNS. The same software can be configured to support authoritative, recursive and hybrid mode. The software is integrated with Active Directory which makes it the default DNS software for many enterprise networks that are based on Active Directory. It also allows creating zones by the standard DNS zone file. The software comes packaged as a role in Windows Server. The server software is shipped with a command line application dnscmd,https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc756116(v=ws.10).aspx a DNS management GUI wizard, and a DNS PowerShell package. In Windows Server 2012, the Windows DNS added support for DNSSEC,https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn593694 with full-fledged online signing, with Dynamic DNS and NSEC3 support, along with RSASHA and ECDSA signing algorithms. It provides an inbuilt key storage provider and support for any third party CNG compliant key storage provider. User interface and PowerShell support for managing DNS and DNSSEC were improved as well. In the Windows Server 2016, the DNS Server supports DNS policies using which the admins can have more control over the name resolution process.https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn765484.aspx = NSD = NSD is a free software authoritative server provided by NLNet Labs. NSD is a test-bed server for DNSSEC; new DNSSEC protocol features are often prototyped using the NSD code base. NSD hosts several top-level domains, and operates three of the root nameservers. = pdnsd = Pdnsd is a caching DNS proxy server that stores cached DNS records on disk for long term retention. Pdnsd is designed to be highly adaptable to situations where net connectivity is slow, unreliable, unavailable, or highly dynamic, with limited capability of acting as an authoritative nameserver. It is licensed under the GPL. = Posadis = Posadis is a free software DNS server, written in C++, featuring Dynamic DNS update support. = PowerDNS = PowerDNS is a free software DNS server with a variety of data storage back-ends and load balancing features. Authoritative and recursive server functions are implemented as separate applications. = Secure64 DNS = DNS Authority is commercial authoritative name server software from Secure64, the company that built Genuinely Secure DNS applications and operating system and completely automated the deployment of DNSSEC. DNS Cache is scalable, highly secure recursive DNS software from Secure64 which provides built-in protection against high-volume denial of service attacks, including Pseudo Random Sub Domain (PRSD) attacks. = Simple DNS Plus = Simple DNS Plus is a commercial DNS server product that runs under Microsoft Windows with an emphasis on a simple-to-use GUI. Maintenance of the software appears to have slackened in recent years. = Unbound = Unbound is a validating, recursive and caching DNS server designed for high performance. It was released on May 20, 2008 (version 1.0.0) as free software licensed under the BSD license by NLnet Labs. It is installed as part of the base system in FreeBSD starting with version 10.0, and in NetBSD with version 8.0. A version is also available in OpenBSD version 5.6 and beyond. (Previous versions of FreeBSD shipped with BIND.) = YADIFA = YADIFA is a BSD- licensed, memory-efficient DNS server written in C. The acronym YADIFA stands for Yet Another DNS Implementation For All. It was created by EURid, which operates the .eu top-level domain.  Features  Some DNS features are relevant only to recursive servers, or to authoritative servers. As a result, a feature matrix such as the one in this article cannot by itself represent the effectiveness or maturity of a given implementation. Another important qualifier is the server architecture. Some DNS servers provide support for both server roles in a single, \\"monolithic\\" program. Others are divided into smaller programs, each implementing a subsystem of the server. As in the classic Computer Science microkernel debate, the importance and utility of this distinction is hotly debated. The feature matrix in this article does not discuss whether DNS features are provided in a single program or several, so long as those features are provided with the base server package and not with third-party add-on software. = Explanation of features = ; Authoritative : A major category of DNS server functionality, see above. ; Recursive : A major category of DNS server functionality, see above. ; Recursion Access Control : Servers with this feature provide control over which hosts are permitted DNS recursive lookups. This is useful for load balancing and service protection. ; Secondary Mode (or Slave Mode) : Authoritative servers can publish content that originates from primary data storage (such as zone files or databases connected to business administration processes)--sometimes also called 'master' servers--or can be secondary (or slave) servers, republishing content fetched from and synchronized with such primary servers. Servers with a \\"secondary mode\\" feature have a built-in capability to retrieve and republish content from other servers. This is typically, though not always, provided using the AXFR DNS protocol. ; Caching : Servers with this feature provide recursive services for applications, and cache the results so that future requests for the same name can be answered quickly, without a full DNS lookup. This is an important performance feature, as it significantly reduces the latency of DNS requests. ; DNSSEC : Servers with this feature implement some variant of the DNSSEC protocols. They may publish names with resource record signatures (providing a \\"secure authority service\\"), and may validate those signatures during recursive lookups (providing a \\"secure resolver\\"). DNSSEC is becoming more widespread as the deployment of a DNSSEC root key has been done by ICANN. Deployment to individual sites is growing as top level domains start to deploy DNSSEC too. The presence of DNSSEC features is a notable characteristic of a DNS server. ; TSIG : Servers with this feature typically provide DNSSEC services. In addition, they support the TSIG protocol, which allows DNS clients to establish a secure session with the server to publish Dynamic DNS records or to request secure DNS lookups without incurring the cost and complexity of full DNSSEC support. ; IPv6 : Servers with this feature are capable of publishing or handling DNS records that refer to IPv6 addresses. In addition to be fully IPv6 capable they must implement IPv6 transport protocol for queries and zone transfers in secondary/primary relationships and forwarder functions. ; Wildcard : Servers with this feature can publish information for wildcard records, which provide data about DNS names in DNS zones that are not specifically listed in the zone. ; Split horizon : Servers with the split-horizon DNS feature can give different answers depending on the source IP address of the query. = Feature matrix = { class=\\"sortable wikitable\\" style=\\"font-size: 85%; text-align: center; width: auto;\\" - ! style=\\"width:20em\\"  Server !

Biography Born in New York City to Catholic Russian parents, Anya Taranda became a Powers Agency model where she was signed as one of the original Breck Shampoo models. In 1932, she met composer Harold Arlen in New York City during the Broadway theatre production of Earl Carroll's Vanities. They eventually married on January 6, 1937, over the objection of their parents, because she was a Gentile and he was Jewish, but it turned out to be a successful marriage. In 1934 she appeared in her first of nine film roles, in an uncredited part as an \\"Earl Carroll girl\\" in Murder at the Vanities, based on Carroll's Broadway play. In 1951 she was institutionalized in a sanatorium for seven years after repeatedly threatening her husband and others with physical harm. She died from a brain tumor, in New York City, at the age of 55. She is interred next to her husband in the Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York.

Bradford is a city based on heavy engineering and textile industries. The Bradford North seat had been held for one Parliament by the Conservatives from 1983 to 1987, when the Labour candidate Pat Wall (a member of the Militant tendency) saw his vote split by a strong SDP challenge and by the sitting Labour MP Ben Ford standing as an Independent. (The successful Conservative, Geoffrey Lawler, had only 34.6% of the vote.) The byelection took place when Margaret Thatcher was highly unpopular and in her last month as Prime Minister. Declining support for the Conservative government (which improved after John Major succeeded Thatcher near the end of November 1990) was reflected by the fact that the Conservative candidate in this by-election only attracted just over one in six of the total votes cast just over three years after it had held the seat. The successful Labour candidate Terry Rooney became the first Mormon to be elected to the House of Commons.

Gingell moved to London to work with Stock Aitken Waterman, just as the record-producing trio began to establish their reputation for releasing 1980s pop music, from artists such as Bananarama, Kylie Minogue, Jason Donovan and Rick Astley. After the three founding members of Stock Aitken Waterman's partnership fell apart, Gingell spent some time working for Mike Stock and Matt Aitken, who had continued as a duo. In 1999, he set up his own production business with long- time friend and co-producer Barry Stone, formerly frontman of late period Romo band Belvedere Kane, whose single \\"Never Felt As Good\\" was later covered by fellow Romo band Massive Ego on their belated 2006 debut album Nite Klub Skewl. They called the company Jewels and Stone (Jewels as in Jules, an abbreviation of Julian, and Stone from Barry Stone's surname). As well as remixing songs such as Sophie Ellis-Bextor's \\"Murder on the Dancefloor\\", Boyzone's \\"No Matter What\\" and S Club 7's \\"Don't Stop Movin'\\", the duo are credited with writing and producing the Adam Rickitt hit \\"I Breathe Again\\", which reached number 5 in the UK Singles Chart in 1999, the S Club Juniors (later S Club 8) single \\"Automatic High\\", which reached number 2 in the same chart and Rachel Stevens' \\"I Said Never Again (But Here We Are)\\".

Salter also served as McCain's chief of staff for a while, although he had left that position by 2008. Salter has often been referred to as McCain's \\"alter ego\\". Early life Salter grew up in Davenport, Iowa. There he attended Roman Catholic parochial schools. Salter had a wandering upbringing and early adulthood, not settling down, working on railroad track maintenance in Iowa for four years and playing in a music group. Salter first entered politics as a speech writer for U.S. Ambassador to the UN Jeane Kirkpatrick. He later attended Georgetown University. Work with John McCain Salter first began working for McCain following a chance encounter at the 1988 Republican National Convention. During the John McCain presidential campaign, 2008 the Wall Street Journal wrote that \\"When it comes to Sen. McCain's image, Mr. Salter, 53 years old, is the campaign's chief creator, shaper and enforcer. For two decades, he has been the presumed Republican nominee's speechwriter, adviser and confidant.\\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121080096992092987 He almost left the campaign in mid-2007, when it suffered a collapse and there were many personnel shake-ups. During the latter stages of the campaign Salter frequently criticised media treatment of the candidate, which he said was consistently tilted in his rivals' favor. Some observers have credited McCain's public servant persona as a literary project due to Salter's efforts. Of their writing process, Salter said in 2008: \\"It's his voice, but I'm going inside his head to speak some psychological truth about him. I'm drawing a conclusion based on my observation of him. I always show him: 'This is what I've written. This is what I think about you. Is this fair?' \\" Observers of the two have likened their sharing to that of a Vulcan mind meld. Howard Fineman wrote in a 2008 Newsweek article: \\"McCain and Salter are stylistically similar and share a world view: they like to operate in intimate settings, with a loyal band of brothers, a clear enemy in sight and an almost joyful fatalism in the face of long odds.\\" He compared Salter's role to that of Boswell. He was portrayed by actor Jamey Sheridan in the 2012 HBO production of Game Change for his role in the latter months of McCain's unsuccessful 2008 Presidential campaign. Following the 2008 campaign loss, Salter became less of a presence in the McCain political operation. In 2020, Salter and his wife endorsed McCain's vice presidential opponent Joe Biden for president. Published works Aside from having worked on Senator McCain's staff for 19 years (as of 2008), Salter has also written, in collaboration with McCain, the books * Thirteen Soldiers: A Personal History of Americans at War (2014) * Why Courage Matters: The Way to a Braver Life (2004) * Faith of My Fathers (1999) * Worth the Fighting For (2002) * Character Is Destiny: Inspiring Stories Every Young Person Should Know and Every Adult Should Remember (2005) * Hard Call: Great Decisions and the Extraordinary People Who Made Them (2007) * The Restless Wave: Good Times, Just Causes, Great Fights, and Other Appreciations (2018) McCain has always given Salter front-cover credit for his writing work, and also splits income from the books with Salter evenly. That even split is a rarity in the political world, which often uses flat-rate ghostwriters, and allowed Salter and his wife‚Äîherself a former secretary on McCain's staff‚Äîto set up a second residence in Maine. In 2011, Mark Halperin wrote in Time magazine that Salter was the author of the anonymously written 2011 book O: A Presidential Novel. Personal life Salter lives in Alexandria, Virginia, with his wife Diane; they have two daughters. In May 2016 Salter announced he would support Hillary Clinton in the 2016 United States presidential election, rather than presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump.

Flannery, John Uri Lloyd: The Great American Eclectic, Carbondale, IL, Southern Illinois University Press, 1998. Etidorhpa was published in 1895. The word \\"Etidorhpa\\" is the backward spelling of the name \\"Aphrodite.\\" The first editions of Etidorhpa were distributed privately; later editions of the book feature numerous fanciful illustrations by John Augustus Knapp. Eventually a popular success, the book had eighteen editions and was translated into seven languages.Neil Harris, Cultural Excursions: Marketing Appetites and Cultural Tastes in Modern America, Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1990; p. 151. Etidorhpa literary clubs were founded in the United States, and some parents named their infant daughters Etidorhpa.J. K. Scudder, M.D., \\"Etidorhpa -- A Review,\\" The Eclectic Medical Journal, Vol. 57 (1897), p. 157. Concept The book purports to be a manuscript dictated by a strange being named I-Am-The- Man to a man named Llewyllyn Drury. Drury's adventure culminates in a trek through a cave in Kentucky into the core of the earth. Ideas presented in Etidorhpa include practical alchemy, secret Masonic orders, the Hollow Earth theory, and the concept of transcending the physical realm. Hollow Earth Etidorhpa belongs to a subgenre of fiction that shares elements of science fiction, fantasy, utopian fiction, and scientific (or pseudoscientific) speculation.David Standish, Hollow Earth: The Long and Curious History of Imagining Strange Lands, New York, Da Capo Press, 2006. Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth is the most famous book of this type, though many others can be cited. It imagined another world in the center of a hollow earth. Among John Uri Lloyd's generation, Edward Bulwer-Lytton's The Coming Race was popular and influential. During the next generation, Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote a series of Hollow Earth novels. Drugs Since Lloyd was a pharmacologist, his novel has provoked speculation that drug use contributed to its fantastic and visionary nature.Marcus Boon, The Road of Excess: A History of Writers on Drugs, Harvard, MA, Harvard University Press, 2002; p. 228. Substances from marijuana and opium to nightshade, henbane, jimsonweed, and psilocybin mushrooms have been suggested as possibilities,Standish, p. 218. although no real evidence on the matter is available. Synopsis Following a framing device, the book's first chapter begins the story of how Drury met the mysterious I-Am-The-Man, who reads his own manuscript account of his adventures to Drury over many sessions. The mysterious stranger, also known as The-Man-Who-Did-It, relates events that supposedly occurred thirty years earlier, during the early part of the 19th century. By his account, the speaker is kidnapped by fellow members of a secret society, because he is suspected to be a threat to their secrecy. (This was likely based on the 1826 kidnapping of William Morgan and the start of the Anti-Masonry movement.) I-Am-The-Man is taken to a cave in Kentucky; there he is led by a cavern dweller on a long subterranean journey. It becomes an inner journey of the spirit as much as a geographical trip through underground realms. The book blends passages on the nature of physical phenomena, such as gravity and volcanoes, with spiritualist speculation and adventure-story elements (like traversing a landscape of giant mushrooms). The whole ends with a summary from I-Am-The-Man and a conclusion from Drury. Subsequent editions of the book added various prefatory and supplementary materials. Possible allusions to Masonry Although the secret society is unnamed, the narrator is made to take an oath by raising his hand and repeating after a man who acts as his guide to swear, \\"To all this I most solemnly and sincerely promise and swear, with a firm and steadfast resolution to keep and perform my oath, without the least equivocation, mental reservation, or self-evasion whatever\\", a pledge reminiscent of initiatory oaths of multiple degrees in Masonry. A man the narrator encounters around the end of the novel says \\"The future is operative and speculative\\", reminiscent of \\"operative\\" and \\"speculative\\" Freemasonry and the \\"speculative science and the operative art\\" in Freemasonry.

Early life and career  Willmott was born in the mining village of Horden, County Durham, but moved to Mansfield with her family at the age of 10. She was educated in Mansfield and at Trent Polytechnic where she obtained an HNC in medical science. She worked as a medical scientist for the National Health Service at King's Mill and Mansfield Hospitals from 1969 to 1990. She was chair of Mansfield Constituency Labour Party and a member of Nottinghamshire County Council for the Leeming and Forest Town division from 1989 to 1993. She also worked as an assistant to Alan Meale (Member of Parliament for Mansfield) from 1987 to 1990. In 1990, she became political officer for the GMB trade union's Midland and East Coast region. She served as chair of the East Midlands Regional Labour Party and was second on the Labour Party list of candidates for the East Midlands region at the 2004 elections to the European Parliament. Willmott is a member of the Labour Friends of Israel and has served as vice-chair. Member of the European Parliament On 1 January 2006, she replaced the late Phillip Whitehead as a member of the European Parliament for the East Midlands following his death. Along with other Labour MEPs, she was part of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats Group in the European Parliament. In July 2006, she was elected to the position of Chief Whip of the Labour MEPs, a position she held until January 2009, when she was elected as the Leader of the European Parliamentary Labour Party (EPLP), replacing Gary Titley who had resigned the post. She was the longest serving leader of the EPLP, surpassing Barbara Castle and Gary Titley. In September 2014, she was appointed rapporteur for changes to medical devices legislation primarily triggered by scandals involving PIP breast implants and 'metal-on-metal' hip replacements. In October 2014, Willmott received the Outstanding Leadership Award from the Belgian Association of Clinical Research Professionals for her work on clinical trials legislation. She also hosted an S&D; event at the Espace L√©opold focused on improved labelling of alcoholic drinks. =Membership of Committees and Delegations= Following the 2014 election, Willmott sat (or was a substitute) on the following Committees and Delegations: * Member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. * Member of the Delegation for relations with Canada. * Substitute on the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. * Substitute on the Delegation for relations with Switzerland, Norway and Iceland. =2014 election campaign= In May 2014, Willmott launched her East Midlands campaign for the 2014 European Parliament election in Derby \\"promising to help people struggling with the cost of living\\". She said the Conservatives wanted to help energy companies and bankers. \\"Nearly 340,000 East Midland jobs depended on continued membership but the Tories hadn't said what aspects of EU membership they wanted to renegotiate or when they would do it. An EU referendum would just be a distraction when Britain was trying to improve its economy\\". She also claimed UKIP's stated objective of \\"cutting red tape\\" were really about \\"cutting people's rights at work\\". In the East Midlands where five seats were contested, Labour retained Willmott's seat and increased their share of the vote by 8%, narrowly missing out on gaining a second seat in the region. =2016 EU referendum= Although she opposed David Cameron's decision to call the referendum on the UK's membership of the EU, Willmott played a prominent role in Labour In for Britain, Labour's campaign for Britain to remain in the EU. She was critical of Cameron's proposed reforms to the EU, including changes to legislation on workers' rights, product standards and environmental protections. She argued that the five key arguments for remaining a member of the EU were on job protection and creation, employment rights, protections for consumers, cross-border security and increased influence on the world stage. Following the UK's vote to leave the EU, Willmott has argued that if the deal reached during the Brexit negotiations leads to extensive deregulation and weakening of social and workers' rights, then Labour should oppose it. In the aftermath of the referendum result, she wrote a letter on behalf of the EPLP to Jeremy Corbyn calling for his resignation as Labour leader after a party briefing document appeared to promote the work of Kate Hoey and Gisela Stuart, two key MPs in the rival Labour Leave campaign. =Retirement= Willmott announced in July 2017 that she would stand down in October and was formally replaced as MEP for the East Midlands by Leicester city councillor Rory Palmer on 3 October. She was replaced as Leader of the EPLP by her colleague Richard Corbett. She was honoured with a 'thank you' dinner on 4 November 2017 which celebrated her career and contribution to the Labour Party and European politics; the dinner was attended by Jeremy Corbyn, the Leader of the Labour Party as well as former leader Ed Miliband.

It is based on The Undersea Warship by Shunr≈ç Oshikawa and The Undersea Kingdom by Shigeru Komatsuzaki. The film is directed by Ishir≈ç Honda, with special effects by Eiji Tsuburaya and stars Jun Tazaki, Tadao Takashima, Y≈çko Fujiyama, Y≈´ Fujiki, and Ken Uehara. The film was released in Japan on December 22, 1963, and in the United States in 1965 via American International Pictures. A two-episode anime OVA titled Super Atragon, based on the same novels, was produced by Phoenix Entertainment in 1995. Plot The legendary empire of the lost continent of Mu reappears to threaten the world with domination. While countries unite to resist, an isolated World War II Captain has created the greatest warship ever seen, and possibly the surface world's only defense. While on a magazine photo shoot one night, photographers Susumu and Yoshito witness a car drive into the ocean. While speaking with a detective the next day they spot Makoto Jinguji, daughter of deceased Imperial Captain Jinguji, who is also being followed by a suspicious character. Her father's former superior, retired Rear Admiral Kusumi is confronted by a peculiar reporter, who claims contrarily that Captain Jinguji is alive and at work on a new submarine project. The threads meet when a mysterious taxi driver attempts to abduct Makoto and the Admiral, claiming to be an agent of the drowned Mu Empire. Foiled by the pursuing photographers, he flees into the ocean. During another visit to the detective, a package inscribed \\"MU\\" arrives for the Admiral. Contained within is a film depicting the thriving undersea continent (with its own geothermal \\"sun\\") and demanding that the surface world capitulate, and prevent Jinguji from completing his submarine Atragon. The UN realizes that Atragon may be the world's only defense and requests that Admiral Kosumi appeal to Jinguji. Concurrently, Makoto's stalker is arrested and discovered to be a naval officer under Jinguji. He agrees to lead the party to Jinguji's base but refuses to disclose its location. After several days of travel, the party find themselves on a tropical island inhabited only by Jinguji's forces and enclosing a vast underground dock. Eventually Captain Jinguji greets the visitors, though he is cold toward his daughter and infuriated by Kusumi's appeal. He built Atragon, he explains, as a means to restore the Japanese Empire after its defeat in World War II, and insists that it be used for no other purpose. Makoto runs off in anger, later to be consoled by Susumu. Atragon's test run is a success, the heavily armored submarine even elevating out of the water and flying about the island. When the Captain approaches Makoto that evening they exchange harsh words; again Susumu reproaches the Captain for his selfish refusal to come to the world's aid. After Makoto and Susumu are kidnapped by the reporter, and the base crippled by a bomb, Jinguji consents to Kusumi's request and prepares Atragon for war against Mu. The Mu Empire executes a devastating attack on Tokyo and threatens to sacrifice its prisoners to the monstrous deity Manda if Atragon appears. Appear the super-submarine does, pursuing a Mu submarine to the Empire's entrance in the ocean depths. Meanwhile, Susumu and the other prisoners escape their cell and kidnap the Empress of Mu. They are impeded by Manda, but soon rescued by Atragon, which then engages the serpent and freezes it using the \\"Absolute Zero Cannon\\". Jinguji offers to hear peace terms, but the proud Empress refuses. The Captain then advances Atragon into the heart of the Empire power room and freezes its geothermal machinery. This results in a cataclysmic explosion visible even to those on deck of the surfaced submarine. Her empire dying, the Mu Empress abandons the Atragon and, Jinguji and company looking on, swims into the conflagration.

Komatsuzaki also served as an uncredited designer for the film, as he had with The Mysterians and Battle in Outer Space. Screenwriter Sekizawa wrote a scene where Jinguji learned of his daughter's kidnapping and was prepared to sacrifice her in order to save the world, which triggered an argument between Jinguji and Kosumi. Director Honda choose to cut this because he saw the story as a parable of global problems rather than personal problems. Producer Tanaka also insisted that a monster, Manda, be included in the film. Honda had no idea whom to cast as the Empress of Mu but met Tetsuko Kobayashi by chance, who was working on a TV show in Toho's lot. Honda found her to be \\"hard working and very energetic\\". Kobayashi also applied the Empress' makeup herself. The film's production schedule was shorter than usual, with production beginning September 5, 1963, targeted for a December release of that same year. This resulted in effects director Eiji Tsuburaya scaling back some effects. Honda originally wanted to show towns and residual areas for the Mu Empire but did not have enough money in the budget. Release Atragon was released in Japan on December 22, 1963. It became the 13th highest grossing domestic film of the year, grossing ¬•175 million. Atragon became a popular feature on TV and at film festivals. In fact, it was so popular that it was re-released in 1968 as the support feature for Honda's Destroy All Monsters. It was also the 1964 Japanese entry at the Trieste Science Fiction Film Festival.Parish, James Robert and Michael R. Pitts. The Great Science Fiction Pictures. American International Pictures afforded the film a successful US theatrical release in 1965 with minimal changes and quality dubbing by Titra Studios. The new name Atragon, derived from Toho's international title Atoragon, is presumably a contraction of \\"atomic dragon\\", a colorful moniker for the titular juggernaut; however, AIP's dubbed dialogue refers to the Goten-go by the name \\"Atragon\\". This shortening from four to three syllables was the choice of AIP, since several European markets released the film as Atoragon (Italy) and Ataragon (France). While Atragon became Toho's first tokusatsu eiga (visual effects film) released on home video in 1982, and though the film is exceptionally popular among western tokusatsu fans, Atragon was not released on home video in the United States until Media-Blasters' DVD in 2005 (although the film was in constant television syndication in the US until the early 1980s). Media Blasters had intended to use the original Titra Studios dubbing, but Toho forced the company to use its international version. This alternate dubbed version syncs up perfectly with the Japanese video, but fans generally consider these international dubs to be inferior. Its enduring popularity in Japan is evident in the number of plastic model kits, garage kits and adult-targeted toys based on the Goten continually on the market. Other appearances Manda later appeared in the 1968 Godzilla film, Destroy All Monsters. Manda and the Gotengo, the original and an updated version, were featured in Godzilla: Final Wars. The Scottish Metal band Atragon took their name from the film. References =Bibliography= Godziszewski, Ed (1995). \\"Atragon: A Toho Classic Revisited\\". G-Fan #21: 18‚Äì33.

Tells the life of Lu√≠s da Silva, a man very stunned and confused with his own life. One day, he meets Marina, his new neighbour, a beautiful girl with whom he falls in love. From this point, the monotony of his life is abruptly changed for a voluntary thought about the family, the childhood and the present, when Juli√£o Tavares, a rich man, fell in love with Marina. The book is narrated in first person, where the protagonist is the narrator. He suffers from an existential angst ‚Äî the main themes of the story; the reader is affected by it through the character, the character through the author. Style Though the book is considered modernist, the author also makes use of Symbolism and Naturalism. His theories about romance are shown when he describes the angst of the main character, Lu√≠s da Silva: suffering, anxiety, a feeling of sickness. It's curious to say but there's an influence from the psychoanalysis, too, when the imagined disease of Lu√≠s da Silva begins to change his behavior and his sense of reality.

S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia. He is the principal character in the fifth book published in the series, The Horse and His Boy. The book's events, however, are chronologically third in the series. He also appears briefly at the end of The Last Battle, the seventh and final book in the series. Born as the eldest son and heir of King Lune of Archenland, and elder identical twin of Prince Corin, Shasta/Cor was kidnapped as an infant and raised as a fisherman's son in the country of Calormen. In The Horse and his Boy, (the events of which all occur during the reign of the four Pevensie children in Narnia, an era which begins and ends in the last chapter of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe), Shasta/Cor escapes to freedom, saves Archenland and Narnia from invasion, learns his true identity, and is restored to his heritage. Shasta's companions on his journey are the talking horses, Bree, and Hwin, and the Calormene Tarkheena, Aravis. Shasta/Cor grows up to become King of Archenland, marries Aravis, and fathers the next (and \\"most famous\\") king of Archenland, Ram the Great. Biographical summary Cor is raised under the name Shasta by a stern fisherman named Arsheesh, who lives on the coast of Calormen, a semi-arid land to the south of Narnia, beyond Archenland and the Great Desert. During his life with Arsheesh, Shasta lived a poor life and was always barefoot. Shasta believes that Arsheesh is his father until he overhears Arsheesh negotiating to sell him as a slave to a Tarkaan (a Calormene nobleman). He discovers that Arsheesh found him like a baby in a rowboat on the beach. Shasta goes to the stable and starts talking to the Tarkaan's horse there. To his surprise, the horse answers him, warning that his new master is cruel and suggesting that they escape together to Narnia, a land of freedom where nearly all the animals talk. Shasta agrees, and he and the horse, nicknamed Bree, start off that night. They encounter another pair of fugitives, a Tarkheena named Aravis and her talking horse Hwin. They make their way to Tashbaan, Calormen's capital city, where Shasta is mistaken for Prince Corin of Archenland, whom he strongly resembles. Learning that Calormen is planning to attack Archenland as a step to conquering Narnia, Shasta and his companions set off to warn Archenland. After a grueling journey, a tired and barefoot Shasta successfully warns the Archenlanders. Riding with the Archenlanders, he becomes lost in dense fog, but is then guided by the great lion Aslan through a mountain pass into Narnia, where his warning musters a force of Narnians to come to the aid of their allies. At Corin's urging, Shasta participates in the battle to defeat the Calormenes. Shasta then discovers who he really is: Prince Cor of Archenland, elder son of King Lune, Corin's twin brother, and heir apparent to the throne. When he was a baby, a prophecy predicted that he would save Archenland from a great evil, leading the enemies of Archenland to kidnap him. When his father pursued their ship, the kidnappers put the baby prince on a rowboat with a knight. This was the boat in which Arsheesh found him. The knight had died, but Aslan guided the boat to shore so that Cor could survive. The prophecy was fulfilled when he warned the Archenlanders and rallied the Narnians against Rabadash. Cor is reunited with his father and brother (his mother having died sometime before), and Aravis comes to live with them at the castle of Anvard. Cor and Aravis eventually marry, and their son Ram the Great becomes (we are told) the greatest king of Archenland. King Cor, King Lune, Queen Aravis, and Prince Corin Thunder-Fist are all mentioned as present in the second Narnia at the end of The Last Battle. Cor is a direct descendant (via Col, the second son of Frank V of Narnia) of King Frank I of Narnia, who was born on Earth in England.

He was the first Spanish rider to wear the yellow jersey in the Tour de France, and in 1956 he became the first of only three riders to win stages in the three Grand Tours in the same year. (The other two are Pierino Baffi and Alessandro Petacchi.) He won the Milan‚ÄìSan Remo classic race on two occasions and took 26 stage wins in the three Grand Tours. His twenty-stage wins in the Giro d'Italia makes him the third most successful foreign rider in the \\"Giro\\" behind Eddy Merckx (25) and Roger De Vlaeminck (22). Poblet was of short stature who had great power, he was the first Spanish rider to be a specialist in one day races in an age when Spain only produced climbers. He had a lightning fast sprint, but could also climb well, taking the Spanish Mountain championships on three occasions and the mountainous Volta a Catalunya twice. His nickname whilst riding was \\"La Flecha Amarilla\\" (the Yellow Arrow) due to the yellow kit of his Ignis team. Biography Poblet was born at Montcada i Reixac in the northern suburbs of Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. His father Enrique owned a bicycle shop in Barcelona and he encouraged his son to take up racing seriously at a young age and supplied him with all the necessary equipment. Despite turning professional in 1944, at the age of 16, Poblet‚Äôs career did not really take off internationally until 1955 when he was invited to be part of the Spanish team at the Tour de France; at that time the Tour invited national squads rather than trade teams. Poblet made an immediate effect at the Tour when he won the opening stage between Le Havre and Dieppe becoming the first Spaniard to wear the yellow jersey. He held onto the jersey in the afternoon Team time trial but lost it next day to Dutchman Wout Wagtmans. However Poblet had more glory at that year's Tour when he took the prestigious final stage into Paris at the Parc des Princes stadium. Success at the 1955 Tour ensured an invitation to the 1956 Giro d‚ÄôItalia where he took four stages, this followed three stage wins in the Vuelta a Espa√±a, he took another Tour de France stage win that year between Angers and La Rochelle to complete a grand slam of stages in Grand Tours for 1956. Only Pierino Baffi and Alessandro Petacchi have been able to repeat this.Petacchi in traditie van Baffi en Poblet. volkskrant.nl (9 September 2003) By this time Poblet was riding for the Faema team led by Rik Van Looy but he left the team early in 1957 after being told he was not going to ride Milan‚ÄìSan Remo. He signed for the Italian squad Ignis and promptly won Milano‚ÄìTorino for them; a week later he was victorious at Milan‚ÄìSan Remo.The 1957 Milan-San Remo. milansanremo.co.uk He stayed with the Ignis squad for the rest of his career. Poblet prepared meticulously for Milan‚ÄìSan Remo, designing a training course in Catalonia similar to the Italian classics parcours with a big climb similar to the Turchino Pass followed by a series of smaller hills. He finished second in 1958 behind Van Looy and then won again in 1959 after breaking away from the peloton with 400 metres to go. He came close to winning Paris‚ÄìRoubaix in 1958 coming second to Leon Van Daele and third in 1960 when Pino Cerami won. For 45 years, he was the only Spaniard ever to have got on the podium at the Roubaix Velodrome, until Juan Antonio Flecha took the third step in 2005 and second in 2007. After retirement Poblet continued to live in the Barcelona area, in 2001 the local sports arena was named after him and more than 2000 people turned out to pay tribute to him. Poblet was awarded the Creu de Sant Jordi in December 2002, one of the highest civil distinctions in Catalonia. In 2004 he was a special guest of the Vuelta a Espa√±a as it passed through Catalonia.

Born in Liverpool, England, Lavinia was the daughter of Olivia Serres and John Thomas Serres. Olivia Serres gained notoriety by claiming to be the daughter of Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn, a younger brother of King George III of the United Kingdom. In 1822 Lavinia married Anthony Ryves, a portrait painter. They were divorced in 1841. In 1844 \\"Princess Lavinia\\" tried to take Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington to court for having \\"overlooked\\", as George III's executor, a bequest of ¬£15,000 to Olivia. In 1850 Lavinia published a pamphlet requesting financial aid from Queen Victoria. In 1866, aged sixty- nine, Princess Lavinia asked the Court of Probate to declare her the legitimate granddaughter of the Duke of Cumberland and award her the ¬£15,000 bequest \\"left\\" by George III. In the process of the 1866 trial, Lavinia produced several remarkable documents attesting to her claims, and a handwriting expert testified to the authenticity of George III's and James Wilmot's signatures. Testimony was introduced that in fact the Duke of Kent had supported Olivia financially, and had spoken of Olivia as \\"my cousin Serres\\", apparently believing her story. The trial was most considered remarkable, perhaps, for the claims made by Dr. Walter Smith, Lavinia's barrister, that George III had been privately married to a Quaker, Hannah Lightfoot, and that in consequence thereof, neither George IV nor Queen Victoria had any right to the throne. Lavinia's case, however, quickly ran into difficulties: in some of the submitted documents, George III had \\"signed\\" his name as \\"George Guelph\\"; in others, William Pitt and Lord Brook had \\"signed\\" as earls before they had in fact become earls. The court found that Lavinia was the legitimate daughter of John and Olivia Serres and was not the granddaughter of the Duke of Cumberland. The court did not prosecute Lavinia for forgery: Lavinia maintained she believed in good faith that the documents left her by Olivia were genuine. It is thought that the documents were in fact forged at the behest of Olivia, rather than Lavinia, perhaps by William FitzClarence, Olivia's boyfriend, who had calligraphic talents. Lavinia continued to write pamphlets in support of her claims, and her case was reheard by the House of Lords. She died with her claims unrecognized.

He was a four-time All-Conference selection and earned All- State honors as a tight end and linebacker (1995‚Äì96), was the USA Today Wyoming Player of the Year in his final season, and earned Sportslink Player of the Year and Conference Player of the Year honors in 1996. Brett Keisel is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.http://www.deseretnews.com/top/1853/16/Brett-Keisel-Mormons-in-the- NFL-2013-season.html Keisel excelled at both football and basketball and initially wanted to go to college for basketball. He researched the statistics of players that were in the NBA at the time and found that his size wouldn't compare to those playing basketball at the professional level. He then turned his attention and athletic ability to football. Brett is the son of Connie and Lane Keisel. He has three sisters: Peggy, Kalli, and Codi; and four brothers: Tom, Lance, Chris, and Chad. He is married to his high school sweetheart, Sarah. The couple have two children. Since retirement from football, Brett and his wife Sarah have been involved with numerous charitable organizations, including the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. =\\"Da Beard\\"= Keisel began growing \\"Da Beard\\" while on a summertime hunting trip with his father. Keisel's facial hair gained fame during the end of the 2010 NFL season. Many NFL players grow \\"rally beards\\" during the playoffs to bring them good luck. His beard has its own Facebook page and Twitter account and has been mentioned repeatedly in the media during the Steelers' playoff run. In an interview on Steelers.com, Keisel explained that he had decided to grow out his beard after having a discussion about the lack of characters in the NFL. In another interview, though, to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, he said he wanted to change the team's luck, because it missed the playoffs the previous season. Keisel refers to his beard as a \\"beautiful thing\\" and \\"the greatest beard of all time\\" and has encouraged other Steelers to grow beards as well. After the Super Bowl several videos were made about Keisel's beard, including one that portrayed him as a Hasidic Jew. On February 24, 2011, \\"Da Beard\\" was removed during a ceremony titled \\"Shear the Beard\\" in downtown Pittsburgh. The event raised over $40,000 for the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC. Keisel stated that \\"Da Beard\\" would most likely return for the upcoming season. \\"Da Beard will decide when the time is right to come back,\\" he said, \\"and it will all of a sudden appear.\\" Keisel dubbed the 2011 season \\"Da Beard Revenge Tour.\\" On February 9, 2012, Keisel held \\"The Second Annual Shear the Beard Event.\\" Just as in the previous year, proceeds raised went to the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. It was announced on January 8, 2013, that \\"The Third Annual Shear the Beard Event\\" would be held on February 7, 2013, at Jergel's Rhythm Grille in Warrendale, PA, with all proceeds benefiting the cancer program at Children's Hospital. It was announced on January 14, 2014, that \\"The Fourth Annual Shear the Beard Event\\" would be held on February 5, 2014, at Jergel's Rhythm Grille in Warrendale, PA, with all proceeds benefiting the cancer program at Children's Hospital. Shear Da Beard recently celebrated its tenth and final year. Shavers such as Ben Roethlisberger, James Harrison, Cameron Heyward, and Arthur Moats have taken part in the shaving of Keisel's beard. Cancer survivor Sean Nolan has even joined in on the festivities.

First adopting the \\"Thanksgiving\\" moniker around 1999‚Äì2000, Orange played experimental folk music, often accompanying himself on guitar and self-recording his albums using analog equipment. While Thanksgiving is essentially a solo act, Orange often collaborates with other musicians in his recordings and performances. Overview =Thanksgiving (1999-2006)= Thanksgiving's debut We Could Be Each Other's Evidence was released by Vit! Vit! Recordings when Orange was just fifteen years old. In 2000 he co-founded Marriage Records with Curtis Knapp and released his second album Nothing on the label the following year. Orange was notably prolific during this period, releasing six albums (including one self-titled triple LP), three EPs and several singles under the name Thanksgiving on various labels. He also played drums in the instrumental group The Watery Graves of Portland alongside Knapp and Davis Lee Hooker, and toured and recorded with YACHT, Phil Elverum (The Microphones, Mount Eerie) and Genevi√®ve Castr√©e. =Adrian Orange & Her Band (2006-07)= In 2006 Orange released the LP Bitches Is Lord under his own name and toured the world with a nine-piece backing band, initially known as Child Slave Rebellion and later Adrian Orange & Her Band. The touring group, featuring members of LAKE, Fran√ßois & the Atlas Mountains and Rozi Plain, recreated older Thanksgiving material with new textures and instrumentation described variously as \\"rogue West African prison-funk\\"K Records: Adrian Orange & Her Band and \\"acid-tinged dub-jam nomad blues\\".Tomentosa Records: Deep Stain Doublest Dubba Dope Duba Stank Dank Tape In February 2007 the band reconvened at Dub Narcotic Studio in Olympia, WA to record a self-titled LP, released later that year on K Records. They also released the single Interdependance Dance as part of the label's long-running International Pop Underground 7\\" series. Adrian Orange & Her Band received mixed responses from critics, although Tiny Mix Tapes described the album as \\"groundbreaking\\" and Drowned in Sound praised it as \\"a vital snapshot of a singer engaged in a constant process of artistic discovery and renewal, with startling, fascinating, often wondrous results\\". =Recent projects= In late 2007 Orange adopted the moniker Lyllyys (and later AOK) and began performing with the greater Portland, OR experimental music scene including members of Rob Walmart, Jackie-O Motherfucker and White Rainbow. Around this time he contributed vocals to the LP Naked Acid by Valet and released two CDRs of free-form, electronic work. In 2011 Gnar Tapes released a double cassette of Orange's experimental recordings entitled Deep Stain Doublest Dubba Dope Duba Stank Dank Tape.

E. Rogie, recorded at Real World Studios, Wiltshire, England, in 1993‚Äì94 and released in May 1994 by Real World Records. Production was carried out by American producer Tchad Blake, who worked in an intimate fashion. In addition to Rogie's three-piece backing band, the album also features the English double bassist Danny Thompson and guitarist Alfred Bannerman. The album is characteristic of Rogie's palm-wine material, with his syncopated folk songs, finger-picked acoustic guitar playing style, sulky baritone vocals, often in the Krio language, and African call-and-response vocals. Beyond the album's central West African musical style, further influences are provided by Thompson's double bass, blues guitar licks, and African-inflected inspiration from Rogie's early influence, American yodeller Jimmie Rodgers. The songs on the album were all written by Rogie, who believed he subconsciously created songs out of catchy expressions he had thought of. The album was released one month before Rogie's death in June 1994, and received positive reviews from music critics, who complimented the album's soothing, mellow sound. The album has been considered by some writers and authors to be among the finest examples of palm-wine music. Background and recording Sooliman Ernest Rogie was born in 1926 in the town of Fonikoh, Pujehun District in southern Province Sierra Leone,\\"S. E. Rogie (Rogers), King of Palm Wine Guitar Music\\" at serogie.com and later became one of the country's most popular performers, achieving a hit single with \\"My Lovely Elizabeth\\". His musical style was rooted in the country's highlife music, but, having been influenced by country music as a child, he combined western pop and folk influences with his smooth baritone vocals and subtle, finger-picked, acoustic guitar-played melodies to create his take on palm wine music, which he named in reference to the alcoholic drink made using the naturally fermented fap from palm trees in Sierra Leone. Rogie has been credited with bringing the genre to an international audience. Seeking to escape his politically-troubled country, he emigrated to England in 1973, creating the record label Rogiephone, who issued his first album, African Lady, in 1975, although in 1988, he moved back to his native Sierra Leone. Dead Men Don't Smoke Marijuana was Rogie's final album, and was recorded for the British world music record label Real World Records. Given that the label is affiliated with the world music-celebrating WOMAD arts festival, Dead Men Don't Smoke Marijuana and the label's other albums bear the credit \\"A WOMAD Production.\\" The album was produced by Tchad Blake, whose production style on the album was described by The Beat as intimate and profoundly felt, transcending \\"mere record production\\" and instead resembling \\"a more sentient form of portraiture.\\" The album features new collaborators Danny Thompson on double bass and Alfred Bannerman on lead guitar in addition to Rogie's band, who include keyboardist Simon Clarke, guitarist and backing vocalist Emile Oogo, and Zozo Shuaibu, who contributes electric bass, percussion and backing vocals. Recording for the album began at Real World Studios, Box, Wiltshire, England, throughout September 1993. He then took a break from recording throughout the rest of 1993, returning to Sierra Leone to play a series of benefit concerts whose money raised was used to purchase food and medicine for Sierra Leoneans that had been dislocated by the rebel war which prevailed the Eastern and southern provinces. It was while in Sierra Leone that he was diagnosed with a serious heart problem. In early January 1994, he returned to London, and after taking a short rest, he returned to Real World to record the remainder of the album throughout that month. On 16 February 1994, shortly after the album's recording but prior to its release, Rogie underwent successful heart bypass surgery. Music and lyrics Danny Thompson plays double bass on the album. Dead Men Don't Smoke Marijuana contains \\"sweet,\\" syncopated folk songs in Rogie's distinctive palm-wine musical style. The record is dominated by his acoustic guitar work and singing but also backed up with the subtle percussion, double bass and keyboard work. Bret Love of AllMusic noted the atmospheric feel to the music and described the album's musical style as a fusion between the \\"back-porch vibe\\" of rustic blues, the laidback rhythms of reggae and the devotional style of Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Rogie's gentle acoustic guitar playing is in a rolling, picking style, and possesses a roots-tinged folk blues feel. While the album exudes a West African musical style, it also boasts a wider range of influences due to the rolling guitar work, the \\"loamy bottom\\" of Thompson's folk double bass, as well as guitar licks taken from iconic blues musicians such as John Lee Hooker. Rogie wrote all of the songs on Dead Men Don't Smoke Marijuana. According to West Africa magazine, Rogie explained that the songwriting \\"was done in his head. The songs formed there in the dark, like crystals.\\" Rogie explained: \\"I hear a catchy expression and I pass it on to my sub-conscious and say: 'I want a song out of this.' I believe everything useful comes from there, the subconscious mind. It is the creative power. It creates the songs, passes it back to me and says: 'Hey you, take it out. Go use it!'\\" The songs are melodically simple and sung by Rogie in a soothing baritone vocal style, often in the Krio language. The songs also feature call-and-response vocals, a characteristic traditional to African music. The songs frequently reveal the influence of American rhythmic yodeler Jimmie Rodgers, Rogie's earliest musical hero, although the influence is presented on the album in an African- inflected style. The songs on the album are said to be stylistically similar, relying on the same musical theme. The first three minutes of the title track \\"Dieman Noba Smoke Tafee (Dead Men Don't Smoke Marijuana)\\" consist of African guitar lines \\"curling around each other\\" before Rogie begins singing. Release Dead Men Don't Smoke Marijuana was released on 16 May 1994 by Real World Records in the United Kingdom. Tony Stiles designed the album packaging with consultancy from Assorted Images and art direction from Michael Coulson. The packaging is consistent with other Real World albums in that it follows Garry Mouat's identity concept for the label. Three days after the album's release, Rogie began a tour of Germany. Against the medical advice of his heart bypass surgeons, he travelled to perform in Russia, where he lost consciousness while performing onstage.\\"S. E. Rogie (Rogers), King of Palm Wine Guitar Music\\" at serogie.com He died at the age of 68 in June 1994, and was survived by his wife, two daughters and a son. While writing about the album shortly after Rogie's death, West Africa wrote that the performer \\"is ranked alongside other Sierra Leonean icons of music and culture such as Ebezener Calender, Ali Ganda, Dele Charlie, Salami Coker and Dr Oloh.\\" Critical reception Dead Men Don't Smoke Marijuana received critical acclaim; Ty Burr of Entertainment Weekly, writing shortly after Rogie's death, called the album \\"as mellow a monument as the man himself\\" and wrote Rogie's guitar style \\"has the lulling pulse one associates with a fine afternoon buzz.\\" Jazz Times wrote that the album possesses \\"[a] softly jubilant sound [that] rises up,\\" and noted that Rogie \\"wraps his baritone voice around sweet, syncopated folk songs in a style described with the term 'palm wine'.\\" Bret Love of AllMusic called the album \\"a sweet, stirring testament to an undeservedly little-known talent\\" which he hoped would immortalise Rogie following his death. He praised the album's \\"deceptively simple charms\\" and complimented the \\"atmospheric, carefree feel of the tunes\\" which he felt evoked \\"images of relaxing times on breezy beaches watching lush, tropical sunsets.\\" World Music: The Rough Guide calls Dead Men Don't Smoke Marijuana \\"a delicious piece of music-cake ‚Äì so long as you like his one tune, the basis of nearly all the tracks.\\" In The Rough Guide to World Music: Africa & Middle East, Simon Broughton and Mark Ellingham write that the album captures the \\"beauty of palmwine music\\" via its simplicity, and feel the album exudes \\"the same quiet thoughtfulness as its predecessors.\\" They conclude that the album is \\"[h]ighly enjoyable, as long as you don't mind the variations on what is basically the same theme.\\" The authors of the Bradt Travel Guides book Sierra Leone felt the album's gentle guitar playing and melodies contributed to a \\"joyful, sultry listen.\\" In his book Afropop!: An Illustrated Guide to Contemporary African Music, writer Jack Vartoogian listed the album among Rogie's \\"fine recordings of his easy, delightful songs.\\" In the 2003 book The Cambridge Companion to the Guitar, the album is listed among examples of \\"African reinvention of the guitar\\" and is described as a \\"fine-example\\" of palm-wine and highlife music. In Banning Eyre's book Africa: Your Passport to a New World of Music, the album is listed as the sole palm wine album to help readers \\"expand [their] understanding of African guitar styles.\\" Panda Bear of Animal Collective is a fan of the album, calling it \\"ripping.\\" He was gifted the album by Eric Copeland of Black Dice, and in turn showed it to Ariel Pink: \\"I remember playing it for Ariel Pink when I was on tour with him, and he said, 'This is what you guys sound like.' I was like, 'Thanks!'\\" In 2011, Rolling Stone ranked the album's title track at number 13 in their list of \\"The 15 Greatest Stoner Songs\\".

It was launched in the fall 1778 from the Province of Quebec against targets in upstate Province of New York.. Prelude On October 24, 1778, with snow already on the ground but before Lake Champlain had frozen, a fleet of ships left Ile aux Noix for the southern part of Lake Champlain. The ships were and , both of which had fought at the Battle of Valcour Island in 1776. The ships were supported by two gunboats and many bateaux. The force comprised 454 men. The British Army forces were made up of regulars from the 29th, 31st, 53rd Regiments of Foot and the Royal Artillery supported by Loyalists from the King's Royal Regiment of New York, Hessian J√§gers and about 100 Indian allies. The force was led by Major Christopher Carleton of the 29th Regiment of Foot. Attacks The fleet moved up the lake to about Crown Point on November 6, 1778, where parties of raiders were let off to attack Reymond's Mill on Beaver Creek, and Middlebury and New Haven on Otter Creek. The fleet then moved to Buttonmold Bay on November 7, where more raiding parties were sent to attack military supplies and Black powder, the town of Monkton, Vermont, and to Moore's Mill near Shoreham, Vermont, a meeting place for the Green Mountain Boys. At Moore's Mill the raiding party ran into a group of local militia, and there was a 20-minute skirmish before the local militia retired. One British soldier was wounded during this fight; American casualties are unknown. When the force returned to Ile aux Noix on November 14, Major Carleton reported the raid had destroyed enough supplies for 12,000 men for a fou-month campaign. This included 1 saw mill, 1 grist mill, 47 houses, 48 barns, 28 stacks of wheat, and 75 stacks of hay. Over 80 head of cattle were captured and brought back to Quebec. Thirty- nine prisoners were taken to Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu and forty to Quebec City over land through northern Vermont by Indians. The only Continental Army units in the area were Whitcomb's Rangers at Rutland, Vermont and Seth Warner's Green Mountain Boys at Fort Edward. The raid had been expected by the American forces but the raid was so late in the year that almost all the forces had gone into winter quarters and were not in a position to stop the raid. The British losses during the raid were 1 man killed by a falling tree, 1 bateaux lost with 17 men on the lake on the return voyage to Ile aux Noix, and 1 wounded at the fight at Moore's Mill. This raid was followed up in 1780 by multiple raids called the Burning of the Valleys, with Major Carleton leading a force down Lake Champlain again while Sir John Johnson lead a force in the Mohawk and Schoharie Valley, and Lieutenant Houghton leading a raid towards the Connecticut River in the Royalton Raid.

It separates Galston from Hornsby Heights, and is intersected by Galston Road and the heritage-listed Tunks Creek bridge at the foot of the valley. Adjacent to Tunks Creek bridge, there is a second concrete bridge that crosses Berowra Creek. The gorge itself contains many walking tracks, waterfalls and a variety of Australian flora, and is a popular spot for hikers, cyclists and rock climbers.  Description  Galston Gorge is a scenic valley containing dense bushland with numerous natural features such as waterfalls and streams accessible by established walking tracks. At the foot of the valley, the Tunks Creek Bridge crosses Tunks Creek. The bridge was constructed in 1893 as a McDonald timber truss one-way road bridge, and became heritage listed in 2000 under the 1977 Heritage Act. The second bridge, the Steel Military Bridge, is a Warren truss bridge that crosses Berowra Creek. It was installed in 1965 to provide fire-fighting vehicles with access between Hornsby and Dural. There is also a small car park located near the base of the Gorge which contains three designated car spots and the Galston Gorge track head that allows access to sections of the Great North Walk. Galston Road allows direct access between Galston and Hornsby Heights, and is the only road that extends through the entirety of Galston Gorge. Via the Gorge, travelling from Galston to Hornsby Heights takes approximately 20 to 25 minutes. Alternatively, detouring around the Gorge via Boundary Road takes approximately 40 to 45 minutes, and can increase significantly during peak hour times. From Tunks Creek Bridge to Hornsby Heights, the narrow road stretches approximately three kilometres with an average incline of 5%, and contains six tight hairpin corners. Of the five initial hairpin turns, the most gentle are the first and last, while the three in between are notoriously steep. Light vehicles or vehicle combinations greater than 11 m in length are unlikely to successfully navigate the road conditions, and heavy vehicles over 7.5 m in length are prohibited. The road contains a guard rail along the Berowra Creek side of the road to enhance its safety. The Gorge is also accessed on foot and via bike. The Galston Gorge East and Galston Gorge West climbs are both routes which are commonly taken by cyclists. The Benowie Walking Track, the Tunks Trail and the Ulolo Trail are suitable bushwalking trails that run through the Gorge. The most significant of these is the Benowie Walking Track, which forms part of the Great North Walk that extends from Sydney Cove to Newcastle. It is 25 km in length through Berowra Valley National Park and can be accessed via six separate locations, generating a variety of different walks. The track is suitable for overnight walks, as the Galston Gorge Campsite is located along the Benowie Walking Track. Although, this campground does not provide any water or facilities for campers. Features such as the Gulley Creek Falls, a small creek crossing, are also seen along the Benowie Walking Track. The Heritage Bridges Walk is an established bush- walk which begins at the constructed wetlands in Clarinda Street, Hornsby, and follows predominantly fire trails with views of the two bridges before ending at the bottom of Galston Gorge.  Local flora and fauna  Galston Gorge is also home to many native birds, mammals and reptiles. Approaching Berowra Creek, rainforest vegetation becomes dominant. Stands of Grey Myrtle Backhousia myrtifolia, ferns and water gums can be found in this area. Possums and other nocturnal marsupials also reveal themselves at night, so commuters must take extra care when driving at night due to low visibility and the tight hairpin corners. Along the Benowie Walking Track, commonly found flora includes Sydney Blue Gum, Blackbutt, She Oak, Sydney Peppermint and Smooth- barked Apple mixed with Coachwood, Blackwattle and Pittosporum. Commonly seen birds include honeyeaters, fantails, parrots, and various species of waterbirds such as the Pied Cormorant, White Faced Heron and Dusky Moorhen. More rarely, Satin Bowerbirds and Lyrebirds may also be seen. Before 2000, a population of feral chickens lived in the bushland. This population was boosted by local residents, who would leave chickens from their semi-rural properties on the Galston side of the gorge at the bottom of the valley. Steps were taken by Hornsby Shire Council to eradicate this population, however the chickens seem to have bounced back and can often be seen wandering around the parking spaces at the base of the gorge.  Traffic regulations  There are regular occurrences of traffic incidents in Galston Gorge, most commonly caused by large trucks becoming stuck at hair-pin bends, or on Tunks Creek Bridge. As of May 2018, over 100 over-length trucks have caused traffic blockages in Galston Gorge. The installation of new signage and a camera based detection system which utilises infrared technology incurs a AUD$2,270 fine to any heavy vehicle over 7.5 metres that attempts to enter Galston Gorge. A roundabout was installed on the Galston side of the Gorge to give heavy vehicles a chance to turn around and avoid heavy fines. Despite these laws, oversized trucks continue to travel through the valley. In February 2016, the new infrared scanning system alerted to an oversize truck, recorded by NSW Roads and Maritime Services as 15.2 metres long. During the vehicles' removal, two additional over-sized trucks were stopped, escorted from Galston Gorge, and later fined. In June 2018, a truck crashed into Tunks Creek Bridge, damaging the heritage site and spilling diesel on the surrounding area.

Along with his younger brother H√©lio Gracie and fellow students Luis Fran√ßa and Oswaldo Fadda, he helped develop Brazilian jiu-jitsu based on the teachings of Mitsuyo Maeda in Kano Jiu-Jitsu and is widely considered to be the martial-arts patriarch of the Gracie family. He purportedly acquired his initial knowledge of Jiu-Jitsu by studying in Belem under Maeda and his students. As he taught the techniques to his brothers, he created a martial arts family with H√©lio and with other members of the Gracie family who provided key contributions to the style and development, eventually creating their own self defence system named Gracie Jiu-Jitsu. Biography Carlos was born in Bel√©m in 1902, the first of eight children. He was a mischievous, aggressive child, prone to getting involved in brawls and getting expelled from schools. When Carlos was 15 years old, hoping to find a way for him to vent his aggression, his father Gastao took him to a professional wrestling challenge hosted in the circus he owned, where Carlos witnessed how the judoka Mitsuyo Maeda defeated a much bigger man. Impressed by the feat, he started taking classes under Maeda and his assistant Jacyntho Ferro, albeit for a short time, as his family moved to Rio de Janeiro for economic reasons. There Gracie started working as a bouncer in his father's casino until a falling out between them, and after some other jobs he became a pupil of Donato Pires dos Reis, a police hand-to-hand instructor and apprentice to Maeda. Under him, Carlos had his first formal training, learning especially self-defense- oriented techniques. He started his career on the rings by challenging judoka Geo Omori in S√£o Paulo in 1929, although he was initially rejected due to Carlos's lack of training and experience. They eventually faced off in two exhibitions (non-competitive matches) of \\"jiu-jitsu\\" (judo and jiu-jitsu were terms used interchangeably at the time in Brazil) staged as a favor to Carlos's father for the Municipal Guard in January 1930. Afterwards, Carlos and his brother George founded a small school in the city's Barrio nas Perdizes, where they brought in Omori to teach them further jiu-jitsu. Gracie claimed to have faced several \\"no holds barred\\" challenges in his school by this time. However, after Carlos was arrested and jailed for assault on three men who had supposedly insulted his girlfriend, the two brothers had to move back to Rio de Janeiro. There they joined Donato Pires's school, opened in Marquez de Abrantes in September 1930. The date of their return to Rio is both popularly and officially given as 1925, but sources of the time place it in the mentioned year. During this time, aside from both teaching and learning jiu-jitsu under Pires, Gracie dedicated himself to participate in unsanctioned prizefights in small bars, promote rooster fighting, and experiment on nutrition and dietary habits. He would claim in 1981 to have competed in amateur boxing with a 20-0 record during this time, while his relative Reila Gracie cited him as a national middleweight champion, but there's no record for those claims.Book review: Carlos Gracie: O Criador de uma Dinastia - Chapter 8. H√©lio Gracie, O Ca√ßula In June 1931, Pires moved to Santa Catarina due to his job in the Ministry of the Economy, leaving his academy in Gracie's hands. Aside from martial arts, Gracie was also interested in alternative medicine and occultism due to the death because of illness of his first girlfriend. He started working as a spiritual consultant to Bank of Brazil executive Oscar Santa Maria, a member of the Brazilian Rosacrucian Society, in which Carlos was deemed as having \\"strong mediumnic powers.\\" In exchange for funding his academy and other ventures, Carlos would put Santa Maria in contact with a supposedly Peruvian spirit named Egidio Lasjovino. Gracie was also a follower of Helena Blavatsky's theosophy. On July 3, 1931, Gracie and Jayme Ferreira celebrated a challenge event between three jiu-jitsu fighters from his academy and three capoeira fighters trained by Ferreira, echoing a street fight Carlos supposedly had years before with a capoerista named Samuel. The challenge forced the fighters to wear judogis and forbade strikes on the ground, which caused one of the capoeiristas, Coronel, to be disqualified upon hitting George Gracie. In the other two matches, Oswaldo Gracie and Benedicto Peres defeated their opponents. The event was negatively received, however, not only due to a ruleset perceived as too favorable to the jiu-jitsu side, but also to accusations that Ferreira (a Greco-Roman wrestling teacher associated to Gracie) was not a capoeira master and therefore his side could not represent the art. Famous professional wrestler and sportsman Manoel Rufino dos Santos criticized further the Gracie family, so a fight was stipulated for August 22, 1931 between him and Carlos Gracie himself to settle it down. In response to the announcement, Carlos's teacher Donato Pires said through the press that Gracie's claims to be a direct apprentice to Mitsuyo Maeda were false and thus was equally unfit to represent jiu-jitsu. This almost caused the fight to be delayed when Carlos and his brothers assaulted Donato in front of the America Hotel in Catete one day before the event. By this incident, ties to Pires were severed and the Marquez de Abrantes academy became fully a property of Gracie. The match, which was the only professional bout in Carlos's life, finally took place on the promised day. During the first two five-minute rounds, Rufino dominated the bout, forcing Carlos to defend from his guard and at one point even hit illegal strikes that were admonished by the referee. At the third, Rufino passed his guard and locked a submission hold, which Gracie avoided by diving out of the ring through the ropes. The referee ordered the match to be restarted on the center of the ring, but Gracie locked a guillotine choke in the process, causing turmoil. Carlos claimed Rufino had tapped out while his opponent denied it, so the judges deliberated for some time and decided to solve the argument by restarting the match. However, Gracie refused to fight, insisting he had already won, and thus Rufino was declared winner. The conflict then moved to the newspapers, where Rufino criticized Carlos's skill and dismissed his jiu- jitsu credentials, leading Carlos, George and H√©lio to assault him in front of his teaching place at the Tijuca T√™nis Clube on October 18. They hit him repeatedly with a steel box and immobilized him for Carlos to apply an armlock, dislocating Rufino's shoulder so badly that it needed surgery. This time the brothers were arrested and were convicted to two years and a half in prison for assault, as well as for trying to run away during the arrest, but their connections to President of Brazil Get√∫lio Vargas granted them a pardon. The same year, Carlos retired from competition and focused on teaching and managing his brothers. After moving to Fortaleza, he started teaching jiu- jitsu in the national police while he researched in the Gracie Diet. He also became a real estate investor. In 1948, he published his book Introdu√ß√£o ao Jiu-jitsu, which was mostly a nutrition and philosophy manual despite its title. Judo and Brazilian/Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Gracie Jiu Jitsu developed in Brazil in the early 1900s using techniques learned from the great Japanese Judo champion, Mitsuyo Maeda (known in Brazil as Conde Koma‚Äîthe \\"Count of Combat\\"). Maeda, who was taught by Jigoro Kano, the creator of Judo, fought hundreds of victorious challenge matches against practitioners of other styles using his Judo techniques to overcome them. Maeda had become a champion Judoka in Japan and was so highly revered by Kano he was sent around the world to spread Judo. According to reports, the young Carlos Gracie refined his system by fighting in matches that were open to all skill levels and learning from those experiences to make Jiu Jitsu more effective. Some reports claim that he advertised in newspapers and on street corners for new opponents upon whom to practice but no documented records of this exist. Gracie claimed to have fought anyone and everyone who was willing, regardless of size, weight, or fighting style. Later, his claims were challenged by his brother Jorge Gracie, who stated; \\"My brother Carlos is nothing when it comes to fighting. Carlos does not have the authority nor the competence to speak about Jiu Jitsu‚Ä¶ Who created the sporting tradition of my family if not me, in all honesty, with my career?\\" This tradition of open challenge is a part of the heritage of Gracie style of Jiu Jitsu. Carlos Gracie taught his style of Jiu Jitsu to his four younger brothers (Oswaldo, Gast√£o, Jorge, and Helio) and to his older sons (including Carlson and Carley), and they in turn taught their brothers, sons, nephews, and cousins. After Carlos retired from the ring, he managed the fight careers of his brothers and sons, continuing to challenge fighters of all styles throughout the world. This tradition of open challenge is continued by his sons, grandsons, brothers, nephews, and students. Gracie diet Carlos Gracie copied and adapted a nutritional regimen, from the Argentinean/French naturist Juan Esteve Dulin, and is now marketed as the Gracie Diet. Following the Hippocratean maxim \\"Let your food be your remedy\\", Carlos aimed this diet to a system that would primarily prevent illness on days of competition. The basic principle of the Gracie Diet is to keep blood pH level neutral by consuming only compatible nutrients at each meal. The Gracie Diet is flexible but it definitely prohibits consumption of pork and its derivatives and adopts abstinence from alcohol and tobacco. Personal life Gracie fathered 21 children, 13 of whom earned the rank of black belt in Brazilian Jiu-jitsu. At the time of his death, Gracie had twenty-one children, one hundred and six grandchildren, and one hundred and twenty-eight great-grandchildren. In 2009, Carlos's daughter Reila Gracie (mother of Roger Gracie) published a biography, Carlos Gracie ‚Äì O Criador De Uma Dinastia; its English translation is titled Carlos Gracie: The Creator of a Dynasty. H√©lio criticized Carlos' inability to commit to relationships in an interview.

(In at least one case, the double pulsar PSR J0737-3039, the companion neutron star is another pulsar as well.) Binary pulsars are one of the few objects which allow physicists to test general relativity because of the strong gravitational fields in their vicinities. Although the binary companion to the pulsar is usually difficult or impossible to observe directly, its presence can be deduced from the timing of the pulses from the pulsar itself, which can be measured with extraordinary accuracy by radio telescopes. History The binary pulsar PSR B1913+16 (or the \\"Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar\\") was first discovered in 1974 at Arecibo by Joseph Hooton Taylor, Jr. and Russell Hulse, for which they won the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics. While Hulse was observing the newly discovered pulsar PSR B1913+16, he noticed that the rate at which it pulsed varied regularly. It was concluded that the pulsar was orbiting another star very closely at a high velocity, and that the pulse period was varying due to the Doppler effect: As the pulsar was moving towards Earth, the pulses would be more frequent; and conversely, as it moved away from Earth fewer would be detected in a given time period. One can think of the pulses like the ticks of a clock; changes in the ticking are indications of changes in the pulsars speed toward and away from Earth. Hulse and Taylor also determined that the stars were approximately equally massive by observing these pulse fluctuations, which led them to believe the other object was also a neutron star. Pulses from this system are now tracked to within 15 Œºs. (Note: Cen X-3 was actually the first \\"binary pulsar\\" discovered in 1971, followed by Her X-1 in 1972) The study of the PSR B1913+16 binary pulsar also led to the first accurate determination of neutron star masses, using relativistic timing effects. When the two bodies are in close proximity, the gravitational field is stronger, the passage of time is slowed ‚Äì and the time between pulses (or ticks) is lengthened. Then as the pulsar clock travels more slowly through the weakest part of the field it regains time. A special relativistic effect, time dilation, acts around the orbit in a similar fashion. This relativistic time delay is the difference between what one would expect to see if the pulsar were moving at a constant distance and speed around its companion in a circular orbit, and what is actually observed. Prior to 2015 and the operation of Advanced LIGO, binary pulsars were the only tools scientists had to detect evidence of gravitational waves; Einstein's theory of general relativity predicts that two neutron stars would emit gravitational waves as they orbit a common center of mass, which would carry away orbital energy and cause the two stars to draw closer together and shorten their orbital period. A 10-parameter model incorporating information about the pulsar timing, the Keplerian orbits and three post- Keplerian corrections (the rate of periastron advance, a factor for gravitational redshift and time dilation, and a rate of change of the orbital period from gravitational radiation emission) is sufficient to completely model the binary pulsar timing. The measurements made of the orbital decay of the PSR B1913+16 system were a near perfect match to Einstein's equations. Relativity predicts that over time a binary system's orbital energy will be converted to gravitational radiation. Data collected by Taylor and Joel M. Weisberg and their colleagues of the orbital period of PSR B1913+16 supported this relativistic prediction; they reported in 1982 and subsequently that there was a difference in the observed minimum separation of the two pulsars compared to that expected if the orbital separation had remained constant. In the decade following its discovery the system's orbital period had decreased by about 76 millionths of a second per year - this means that the pulsar was approaching its maximum separation more than a second earlier than it would have if the orbit had remained the same. Subsequent observations continue to show this decrease. Effects Sometimes the relatively normal companion star of a binary pulsar will swell up to the point that it dumps its outer layers onto the pulsar. This interaction can heat the gas being exchanged between the bodies and produce X-ray light which can appear to pulsate, in a process called the X-ray binary stage. The flow of matter from one stellar body to another often leads to the creation of an accretion disk about the recipient star. Pulsars also create a \\"wind\\" of relativistically outflowing particles, which in the case of binary pulsars can blow away the magnetosphere of their companions and have a dramatic effect on the pulse emission.

It was first performed on 1 October 1872 at the Th√©√¢tre du Vaudeville in Paris. Bizet's music consists of 27 numbers (some only a few bars) for voice, chorus, and small orchestra, ranging from short solos to longer entr'actes. Bizet himself played the harmonium backstage at the premiere performance. Bizet's music contains several folk-like themes for the music but also incorporated three existing tunes from a folk-music collection published by Vidal of Aix in 1864: La Marcho di Rei (The March of the Kings), the Danse dei Chivau-Frus, and Er dou Guet. The score achieves powerful dramatic ends with the most economic of means.Dean W. Bizet. London, J M Dent & Sons, 1978. Still, it received poor reviews in the wake of the premiere and is not much performed nowadays in its original form. The play itself was not successful, closing after only 21 performances. It had been staged as a last-minute replacement for another play, which had been banned by the censors, and the audience was less than favourably disposed to the new play.musikmph The incidental music has survived and flourished, however. It is most often heard in the form of two suites for orchestra, but has also been recorded complete. Musical numbers (1) Overture ‚Äì the March of the Kings; L‚ÄôInnocent‚Äôs theme; Fr√©d√©ri‚Äôs theme. = Act 1 = Tableau 1: The farm at Le Castelet In the first m√©lodrame (No 2) Francet Mama√Ø, Fr√©d√©ri‚Äôs grandfather, tells the shepherd Balthazar and Fr√©d√©ri‚Äôs young brother (called ‚Äòl‚ÄôInnocent‚Äô) of Fred√©ri‚Äôs passion for a girl from Arles, while l‚ÄôInnocent, whose theme dominates this and the next two numbers, tries to talk to the shepherd about a fable about a wolf attacking a goat. The next m√©lodrame (3) links the first and second scenes of the play, as the old shepherd, Balthazar, continues telling the wolf story to l‚ÄôInnocent. The third m√©lodrame (4) accompanies an exchange between Vivette, Rose Mama√Ø‚Äôs god-daughter, and Balthazar, where the shepherd says he thinks something is stirring in l‚ÄôInnocent‚Äôs mind. In scene VIII, after a gay offstage chorus, a m√©lodrame (5), introduces the theme of Mitifio, a cow-herd; he has come to reveal that the Arl√©sienne has been another‚Äôs mistress for two years. In the m√©lodrame and final chorus (6), Fr√©d√©ri is about to go off to Arles, but Francet tells him what Mitifio said. The chorus bursts in with a reprise of (5) as Fr√©d√©ri‚Äôs theme accompanies his collapse by the well. =Act 2= Tableau 2: Alongside the pond of Vaccar√®s in the Camargue (7) sets the scene, a Pastorale (the Pastorale in the second suite) with offstage chorus and accompaniment. In M√©lodrame (8) Balthazar and l‚ÄôInnocent enter in Scene III (using the latter‚Äôs theme), and (9) marks the exit of Rose. The next m√©lodrame (10) accompanies the discovery of Fr√©deri in the shepherd‚Äôs hut, angry because everyone is spying on him. As wordless offstage chorus sing, Balthazar leaves, having failed to make Fr√©d√©ri destroy the letters from the Arl√©sienne which he reads night and day. M√©lodrame (12) is only six bars; l‚ÄôInnocent cannot recall the story he wants to tell his brother. In the next m√©lodrame (13), (Er dou guet) described as a ‚Äòberceuse‚Äô, l‚ÄôInnocent falls asleep while telling his story. A nine-bar m√©lodrame (14) evokes Rose‚Äôs desperation at Fr√©deri‚Äôs frame of mind. Tableau 3: The kitchen at Castelet The next music (the Intermezzo used in the second suite) depicts Vivette, the local girl who wants to marry Fr√©d√©ri, preparing her parcels to take on the Rhone ferry (15). After men prepare to go out shooting game Rose and the others fear that Fr√©d√©ri might kill himself. At the end of the act (16) when Fr√©d√©ri decides that Vivette can help him forget his obsession, Balthazar and Rose express their relief. This is followed by the Minuet (17) and the Carillon (18), both used in the first suite. =Act 3= Tableau 4: The Castelet farm courtyard A 6/8 Andantino M√©lodrame (19) marks the entrance of M√®re Renaud in Scene III, and in the following Adagio (the Adagietto in the first Suite) Balthazar and Renaud reminisce about old times. As all move off to eat, there is a reprise of the Andantino. Another Andantino follows the exit of Fr√©d√©ri and Vivette as they declare their love (20). The farandole (21) (Danse dei Chivau-Frus) which begins quietly and builds to a climax sees Fr√©d√©ri respond with fury to Mitifio who has come to tell Balthazar that he will run off with the girl from Arles (22). Tableau 5: The Cocoonery The farandole is heard then the March of the Kings is sung by the chorus, after which the two are combined (23); there is reprise for chorus of the March of the Kings (24). In (25) l‚ÄôInnocent ‚Äòawakens‚Äô showing he understands his brother‚Äôs problem. In m√©lodrame (26) Rose is momentarily reassured as the clock strikes three, while the Final is a powerful tutti version of Fr√©d√©ri‚Äôs theme (27) which brings down the curtain. Orchestration Two flutes (second doubling piccolo), oboe (also cor anglais), clarinet, two bassoons, alto saxophone, two French horns, timpani, tambourin (tambourin proven√ßal not tambourine), seven violins, one viola, five cellos, two double basses, piano, and an offstage harmonium to accompany the choruses. Suite No. 1 =Background= Despite the poor reviews of the incidental music, Bizet arranged his work into a suite of four movements. Now known as L'Arl√©sienne Suite No. 1, the suite used a full symphony orchestra but without the chorus. The first performance was at a Pasdeloup concert on 10 November 1872. =Movements= *I.

(This tune had also been used two centuries earlier in Jean-Baptiste Lully's Marche de Turenne.) Afterwards, the theme is repeated by various sections. After reaching a climax, the theme fades away. It is followed by the theme associated with L'Innocent (the brother of Fr√©d√©ri, the hero). The Pr√©lude concludes with the theme associated with Fr√©d√©ri himself. The second movement, resembles a minuet, while the third is more emotional and muted. The last movement, Carillon, features a repeating bell-tone pattern on the horns, mimicking a peal of church bells. Suite No. 2 =Background= L'Arl√©sienne Suite No. 2, also written for full orchestra, was arranged and published in 1879, four years after Bizet's death, by Ernest Guiraud, using Bizet's original themes (although not all of them were from the L'Arl√©sienne incidental music). The second suite is generally credited to Bizet since he wrote the themes and the basic orchestration. =Movements= *I.

The melodies are repeated by various sections throughout the first movement. In the suite, the opening section returns and concludes the piece. In the original version, the \\"central\\" section, which was a wordless chorus sung by women, ends the piece. The second movement intermezzo features utilization of low tones and begins with the wind section. Guiraud adds twelve additional bars to the concluding section. Sometime after this second suite was prepared from the L'Arlesienne music, Guiraud extracted the Intermezzo movement, added the Latin sacred text of the Agnus Dei to it, and published it as yet another \\"new\\" work of Bizet. The menuet, which is not from L'Arl√©sienne, but from Bizet's 1866 opera The Fair Maid of Perth, features solos by harp, flute, and, later, saxophone (this replacing the vocal parts of the original); it is the most subdued and emotional movement. The finale, the farandole, incorporates the theme of the March of the Kings once again. This is an expanded combination of numbers 21 and 23-24 of the original incidental music, in which the farandole appears first on its own. It is afterwards briefly combined with the march. Recordings The suites have been recorded many times. There are at least two recordings of the complete incidental music for the play, one conducted by Albert WolffOn Decca LXT5229-30, with actors Mary Marquet, Berthe Bovy, Maurice Chambreuil, Pierre Larquey, Hubert Noel and Fernand Sardou. Reissued on Accord and Naxos. and another by Michel Plasson (who has also recorded both suites).

CD Mirare 2020 Notable uses Music from the L'Arl√©sienne suites was played extensively in \\"Hammer Into Anvil\\", an episode of The Prisoner. The Carillon and Farandole were used on two episodes of Playhouse Disney's Little Einsteins. The Carillon was used in a very successful media campaign in Puerto Rico, launched in the late 1980s by the local importers of Finlandia Vodka. It featured French-born photographer Guy Paizy playing the role of a sophisticated, womanizing classical orchestra conductor. The campaign is still remembered in the island nation, almost two decades after its inception. Albanian dictator Enver Hoxha adopted the First Suite's Prelude as a military march during his reign. The Trans-Siberian Orchestra uses the theme of the Farandole for their song \\"The March of the Kings/Hark the Herald Angel\\". The Japanese group Mihimaru GT uses the theme of the Farandole for their song \\"Theme of mihimaLIVE 2\\". An American songwriter, composer, and arranger Ben Homer created a jazz arrangement \\"Bizet Has His Day\\" (from Georges Bizet's \\"Farandole\\" from L‚ÄôArl√©sienne-Suite), (1945). Jazz musician Bob James arranged and recorded a jazz version of Farandole on his album Two (1975). French choreographer Roland Petit created a ballet L'Arl√©sienne in 1974 which has been performed throughout the world, based on Daudet's short story and set against a Van Gogh landscape.List of choreographic work by Roland Petit. Official site of Roland Petit, accessed 7 October 2014. A rock version of Farandole appears in the Catherine (video game) by Atlus. The song tune is also used in a character song called England's Evil Summoning Song from an anime called Hetalia: Axis Powers and was performed by Noriaki Sugiyama, who provided vocals for Arthur Kirkland/England. According to an interview with Noriaki in Hetalia Character CD Perfect Guide, the lyrics were entirely made up by the performer as the performance went on.

He made over 300 appearances for Cardiff City in a spell disrupted by the outbreak of World War II, winning one cap for Wales in 1948. Career Born in Penrhiwceiber, Baker began his career Troedrhiw before joining Cardiff City in January 1938, after having trials at a number of clubs including Arsenal and Wolverhampton Wanderers. He made his debut for the club in a 2‚Äì0 win over Northampton Town in February 1939 as an outside- right but would make just two more appearances before the outbreak of World War II. Baker had played in 22 wartime fixtures for the club when he was called up to enlist. Baker joined the 77th HAA Regiment, which contained a number of footballers including other Cardiff City players Ernie Curtis and Billy James and embarked on a journey to North Africa by ship for deployment. However, en route, Japanese forces launched an attack on Pearl Harbor, leading the UK to declare war against Japan which saw Baker and his unit rerouted to Java where British forces suffered heavy losses and Baker was one of numerous British troops taken prisoner. He spent four years as a Prisoner of war. On the return of The Football League in 1946, Baker was converted into a wing half. The presence of Ron Burgess in his position at national level restricted Baker's appearances for Wales, winning a single cap in 1948 in a 2‚Äì0 defeat to Northern Ireland when Burgess was unavailable for selection after being chosen to play for his club in an FA Cup semi-final. He spent nine post-war years at Cardiff before leaving in 1955, having been displaced following the arrival of Colin Baker. He transferred to Ipswich Town, where he ended his playing days. After leaving Ipswich, he returned to Cardiff, where he became an ambulance driver, remaining a well recognised figure to older fans, and continued playing amateur football until 1959 for Ton Pentre in the Welsh Football League.

Description  Antarctic silverfish usually grow to about in length, with a maximum of . The maximum reported weight of this species is 200 g. Antarctic silverfish have a maximum reported age of 20 years. When alive, they are pink with a silver tint, but turn silver only after death. This Antarctic marine fish is one of several in the region that produce antifreeze glycopeptides as an adaptation against the extreme cold of Antarctic waters.  Ecology  The postlarvae, in size, feed on eggs of calanoids (Calanoida), sea snails Limacina and tintinnids (Tintinnida). The postlarvae live at depths of up to 135 m. Juveniles feeds on copepods (Copepoda), mostly on Oncaea curvata and can be found at depths of 50 to 400 m (165 to 1340 ft). Mature females may spawn for the first time at 7-9 years of age. The adults of this species can be found at depths 0-728 m. Antarctic silverfish are an important prey species for high trophic animals, such as the Adelie penguin and the Weddell seal.

Copland became part of the jazz scene in Philadelphia in the early 1960s as a saxophonist, and later moved to New York City, where he experimented with electric alto saxophone. In the early 1970s, while pursuing his own harmonic concept, he grew dissatisfied with what he felt were inherent limitations in the saxophone and moved to the Baltimore-Washington D.C. area, where he remained for a decade to retrain as a jazz pianist. He returned to New York in the mid-1980s. Early years Copland was born on May 27, 1948 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He began taking piano lessons at age seven, but stopped abruptly at the age of ten when his public school offered the option of saxophone training. Beginning his career on alto sax, Copland became part of a vibrant music scene in his hometown in the early 1960s, learning and playing with Michael Brecker, a close friend and fellow high school student. In 1965 he briefly studied harmony with Romeo Cascarino in Philadelphia and also began training in composition with Meyer Kupferman and studied saxophone with Joseph Allard, both in New York. Career In 1966, Copland moved to New York City, where he attended Columbia University. He became part of a late 1960s and early 1970s New York jazz scene that expanded from the traditional clubs into lofts around the city. During this period, Copland was, along with John Abercrombie and Glen Moore, a member of the Chico Hamilton Quartet. He experimented by adding electronic processors to his alto, culminating in the recording of Friends, an electric jazz album produced by a small New York City start-up label, Oblivion. This album, with Abercrombie, Clint Houston, and Jeff Williams, achieved a kind of cult status, earning a five-star review in Down Beat magazine. Increasingly, however, Copland was writing music with more complex chords that suggested to him an approach to music very different from his acoustic and electronic saxophone work. He came to feel that as an instrument, the saxophone was not a suitable vehicle to fully express his musical imagination. By 1973, he had decided to switch to piano. For the next decade, Copland labored in Washington, D.C. and Baltimore in relative obscurity while mastering his new instrument. During this period he underwent a kind of apprenticeship, playing with well-known musicians passing through the area who asked for him as an accompanist. Backing up different musicians one week to the next, he worked with artists such as Randy Brecker, Bob Berg, Hank Crawford, Art Farmer, Curtis Fuller, Tom Harrell, Eddie Harris, Harold Land and Blue Mitchell, Dave Liebman, Bob Mintzer, Gary Peacock, and Sonny Stitt. During this time he also led his own bands in local clubs, playing with many of the musicians who lived and worked in the area. One of these, bassist Drew Gress, later moved to New York and over the years has become one of Copland's chief musical collaborators. In the early 1980s, Copland returned to New York. For a time he returned weekly to Washington to continue private teaching and a steady trio engagement, but after a couple of years these regular visits tapered off in favor of more extensive work in New York City. During this period he worked with Bob Belden, Jane Ira Bloom, Joe Lovano, Herbie Mann, James Moody (with whom he toured for three years), John Scofield, Jim Snidero, and Dave Stryker. A busy sideman, he began to appear with his own bands in local clubs, but remained unrecorded as a leader. Acting on a tip that the Japanese label Jazz City was searching for ten American pianists, Copland sent an audition tape to guitarist/producer Yoshiaki Masuo. After listening, the producer called Copland to decline, saying that the label had already reached agreement with ten pianists. A few weeks later Masuo called back to say one pianist had dropped out, and offered Copland his first record deal. My Foolish Heart, Copland's debut disc as leader, was recorded at \\"The Studio\\" in Soho. His trio and quartet gigs and were more frequent, and as word of his trio spread, he began to play regularly at several venues around the United States, first with Peacock and drummer Bill Stewart, and later, when Stewart was no longer with the original trio, with Billy Hart. In the 1990s, on the recommendation of Peter Erskine and John Abercrombie, Copland recorded with Vince Mendoza, in the process making the acquaintance of Japanese producer Takao Ogawa. A few years later Ogawa and Copland bumped into each other in a New York studio, agreeing to meet to discuss recording possibilities. Ogawa subsequently organized and produced Stompin' with Savoy (Savoy), featuring an all-star quintet including fellow Philadelphian Randy Brecker and Bob Berg. Because of the limited distribution in the U.S. of his previous CDs, this release effectively became Copland's American debut. It garnered high praise in the American press, which cited his unique way of re- interpreting the standard repertoire, an approach which was widely copied by younger musicians later in the decade. The release led to three years of touring with the quintet in major clubs around the country. Savoy recorded three other albums, as well as a fourth CD that was never released. The Savoy jazz catalog was largely inactive in the late 1990s, and for a couple of years Copland went unrecorded. But In the mid-nineties Copland had begun touring Europe with his own groups, first in duo with John Abercrombie, and later in trios and quartets. As a result, at the beginning of the millennium several European labels took an interest and began to document his work. These recordings solidified his position as a leading and original voice on his instrument in various contexts; each disc was greeted enthusiastically by the press. His work from 2000 to 2006 can be divided into solo piano work, duos, trios, and quartets. In 2001, French producer Philippe Ghielmetti heard Copland with his trio in Paris, and invited him to record his debut solo piano album. The album featured almost all Copland originals. Three years later, Swiss producer Werner Uehlinger followed. In Poetic Motion, references to Bill Zavatsky's poem of the same title are everywhere. In Time Within Time Copland wrote his own verse, which helped unify the theme of \\"time\\" that is present in the CD title, the cover photograph, and the musical titles and content. For years, the duo in jazz was a rarely seen ensemble. Copland concentrated on this somewhat neglected format in many of his recordings between 2000 and 2005. His partners on the various projects played diverse instruments, including alto sax, soprano and tenor sax, guitar, bass, and trumpet. A final duo release from this period featured Copland in duets with another pianist with a harmonically advanced bent, the American Bill Carrothers: Perhaps the album most responsible for opening the door to wider public acceptance for Copland during the new millennium was his return to the trio format with his regular working band of the period, with Drew Gress on bass and Jochen Rueckert on drums. The album was an application of the pianist's lyrical bent to the interpretation of ballads, a song form that lends itself naturally to his style. The trio developed the rapport evident on the album through several years of steady gigs in New York, and USA and European tours. Another and very different trio, with Kenny Wheeler and John Abercrombie, was a meeting of three individualist instrumentalists and composers. This latter trio recorded twice, and also toured Europe frequently. In the nineties, Copland wrote and arranged extensively for his quintet and quartet; he returned to this format with four CDs in the 2000s. During this period Copland recorded exclusively for Pirouet. His output during this period included mostly trios, but also duos, quartets, and a quintet album. Some Love Songs recalls his earlier ballad disc Haunted Heart, with the same trio of Gress and Rueckert. Beginning with Modinha, the pianist embarked on the three-volume \\"NY Trio Series\\"; he later returned to the trio of Gress and Rueckert for \\"Some More Love Songs.\\" Discography =As leader and solo recordings= * 1988 My Foolish Heart (Jazz City) * 1992 At Night (Sunnyside) * 1992 Two Way Street with Dieter Ilg (Jazzline) * 1995 Stompin' with Savoy (Savoy) * 1996 Second Look (Savoy) * 1997 Paradiso (Soul Note) * 1998 Softly (Savoy) * 2000 Between the Lines with Tim Hagans (Steeplechase) * 2001 Double Play with Vic Juris (Steeplechase) * 2001 That's for Sure with John Abercrombie, Kenny Wheeler (Challenge) * 2001 Poetic Motion (Sketch) * 2001 Haunted Heart and Other Ballads (Hathut) * 2002 Bookends with Dave Liebman (Hathut) * 2002 Lunar with Dave Liebman (Hathut) * 2002 Songs without End with Ralph Towner * 2002 Round and Round with Greg Osby (Nagel-Heyer) * 2003 Night Call with Greg Osby (Nagel-Heyer) * 2003 Marc Copland and...

A frontal attack by British infantry supported by artillery drove Boers from a hilltop position, but the British suffered heavy casualties in the process, including their commanding general Sir William Penn Symons. Prelude Reinforcements sent to Natal by Britain immediately before the outbreak of war had moved into the northern path of the province of Natal, but not far enough forward to occupy the passes of the Drakensberg Mountains. As a result, the Boers could invade Natal from three sides. Lieutenant-General Sir George White in command of forces in Natal requested that forces at Glencoe (Dundee) be withdrawn to concentrate his forces at Ladysmith where he held the bulk of the British garrison. The Governor of Natal considered it necessary to hold the position for political and economic reasons, so he dispatched Lieutenant-General Sir William Penn Symons to take control of the troops at Glencoe. War was declared at 5pm on 11 October with the Boers invading on the 12 October. Symons commanded a brigade (four infantry battalions, part of a cavalry regiment and three companies of mounted infantry, three field artillery batteries) which occupied the coal mining town of Dundee. Coal was strategically important to the British war effort as it was needed to power the British steam locomotives. On the evening of 19 October, two Boer forces from the independent South African Republic, each numbering 4,000 men under General Lucas Meyer and General \\"Maroela\\" Erasmus closed in on Dundee. Battle Before dawn on 20 October, Erasmus' force occupied Impati Mountain north of Dundee. Meyer's men occupied the low Talana Hill east of the town at , and dragged several German manufactured Krupp field guns to the top. As dawn broke and the British spotted the Boers on Talana Hill, these guns opened fire, ineffectually. The British 16th and 69th Field Batteries galloped to within range and opened fire. Leaving the 1st Battalion Leicestershire Regiment and the 67th Field Battery to guard the camp, the British infantry, led by the 2nd Battalion Royal Dublin Fusiliers and supported in succession by the 1st Battalion King's Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC) and the 1st Battalion Royal Irish Fusiliers (RIF), moved forward to make a frontal attack, and reached the foot of the hill where they were to advance through a small wood. However they were pinned down by heavy rifle fire from the top of Talana Hill. Symons went forward to urge them on, and was mortally wounded in the stomach, although he was able to mount his horse and ride back into Dundee where he later died. Under Symons' successor, Brigadier- General James Herbert Yule, the KRRC managed to reach a small stone wall at the foot of Talana Hill, where the Dublin Fusiliers were pinned down by Boer fire. With the Royal Artillery laying down accurate fire on the summit the KRRC supported by the RIF were able to proceed up the hill. When they reached the top, they suffered casualties from their own supporting artillery. The Boers abandoned their positions on the hill. Despite the British artillery being repositioned to harass the Boer retreat, they declined to fire, worried that they might hit their own troops again. General Lukas Meyer's forces mounted their ponies and made off. A squadron of the 18th Hussars and the British mounted infantry tried to cut off their retreat, but most of the British horsemen strayed onto the slopes of Impati. General Erasmus's men, who had so far played no part in the battle due to Impati being shrouded in fog, surrounded the British mounted detachment and forced them to surrender. Aftermath The British had won a tactical victory, but at a high cost. And a copy of the British Intelligence Notes on the Dutch Republics (which underestimated the Boer numbers and armament) fell into the hands of the Boers. Yule's men were unable to contemplate attacking Impati Hill, which held Dundee's water supply. They marched and countermarched beneath the hill for two days under intermittent shellfire. Other Boer forces had cut the British line of supply and retreat. Finally the British force retreated across country at night. After an arduous four-day march of , they reached Ladysmith, where they reinforced the garrison.

Distributed by Buena Vista Distribution, the film is based on a biography by Laura Bower Van Nuys, directed by Michael O'Herlihy, with original music and lyrics by the Sherman Brothers. Set against the backdrop of the 1888 presidential election, the film portrays the musically talented Bower family, American pioneers who settle in the Dakota Territory. Walter Brennan, Buddy Ebsen, Lesley Ann Warren and John Davidson head the cast. Kurt Russell is also featured, and, in a bit part, Goldie Hawn makes her big-screen debut. Plot The Bower Family Band petitions the Democratic National Committee to sing a rally song for President Grover Cleveland at the party's 1888 convention. On the urging of Joe Carder, a journalist and suitor to eldest Bower daughter Alice, the family decides instead to move to the Dakota Territory. There, Grandpa Bower, a staunch Democrat, causes trouble with his pro-Cleveland sentiments. The Dakota residents are overwhelmingly Republican, and they hope to get the territory admitted as two states (North and South Dakota) rather than one (so as to send four Republican senators to Washington rather than two). Grandpa's actions result in family strife, including nearly costing Alice her position as the town's new school teacher. The budding romance between Joe and Alice also suffers. In the end, more ballots are cast for Cleveland, but Republican nominee Benjamin Harrison nonetheless wins the Electoral College vote and the presidency. Before he leaves office, Cleveland grants statehood to both the two Dakotas, along with Montana and Washington, evening the gains for both parties. The Dakotans, particularly the feuding young couple, resolve to live together in peace.

Practicing in their barn, the family dances among the animals and hay, boasting of their unique talents and versatility. \\"The Happiest Girl Alive\\" Alice expresses her intense emotions over receiving her latest letter from suitor Joe Carder. \\"Let's Put It Over with Grover\\" The Bowers perform this Grover Cleveland campaign song to a representative from the Democratic National Committee.The songwriters' father, Al Sherman (who was also a songwriter) wrote two songs which were used as campaign songs for two different Presidential candidates in the mid-twentieth century. In the 1948 election, Republican candidate, Thomas Dewey usurped the Al Sherman/Charles Tobias/Howard Johnson collaboration, \\"(What Do We Do On A) Dew-Dew-Dewey Day\\" for his campaign. Four years later Sherman wrote a song specifically for Dwight D. Eisenhower's campaign called \\"I Like Ike.\\" \\"Ten Feet off the Ground\\" Ecstatic at the prospect of performing at the National Convention, the family band engages in an impromptu celebration. They sing about the feeling which only music can bestow, figuratively lifting them \\"Ten Feet off the Ground\\". (This was one of two songs from the film covered by Louis Armstrong later in 1968.) \\"Dakota\\" Joe Carder entices local Missouri families, singing about the marvels of the Dakota Territory. (\\"Dakota\\" is similar in style to the title song of the Oklahoma! and was once considered as a candidate for \\"state song\\" for South Dakota.) \\"'Bout Time\\" Joe Carder expresses his devotion to Alice, telling her it's \\"'Bout Time\\" they were engaged, she responds in kind, and the two sing this duet. (This song was covered by Louis Armstrong and was later featured in the 2005 film, Bewitched.) \\"Drummin' Drummin' Drummin'\\" Grandpa Bower recounts the tale of a young drummer boy during the Civil War, inspiring all the children in the school house that they too can stand their ground and make a difference. \\"West o' the Wide Missouri\\" On election night, locals dance and celebrate their part in American expansionism West o' the Wide Missouri. \\"Oh, Benjamin Harrison\\" The Republicans in town have their own campaign song; they sing their praise for Benjamin Harrison, who is \\"far beyond comparison.\\" The original cast soundtrack was released on Buena Vista Records in stereo (STER-5002) and mono (BV-5002). Disneyland Records released a second cast album with studio singers and arrangements by Tutti Camarata, with both mono (DQ-1316) and stereo (STER-1316) versions. Neither the soundtrack or the second cast album have been released on CD or to iTunes. Production Originally planned as a two-part television show titled The Family Band, the project was based on a book by Laura Bower Van Nuys. The memoir by Van Nuys, the youngest of the Bower children, described her family's brass band, their journey out of Missouri, and their frontier life in the Black Hills. Walt Disney had asked the Sherman Brothers for their help on the project, feeling the story was too flat. The Shermans wrote the song \\"The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band\\", which was ultimately used as the title of the motion picture. After hearing the song, Disney decided to add more songs to the film and turn it into a musical. In all, the Sherman Brothers wrote eleven songs for the film, though Robert Sherman reportedly did so under protest, believing the subject matter too mundane to be made into a feature-length musical film. The film reunited Lesley Ann Warren and John Davidson as the romantic leads in a Disney live-action musical, having previously been paired in The Happiest Millionaire (1967), starring Fred MacMurray. Disney brought back Walter Brennan from The Gnome-Mobile (1967) (starring the Mary Poppins kids Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber) to play Grandpa Bower because the actor reminded Walt of his father. Theatrical release and reception The film premiered at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. Originally intended to run 156 minutes, the Music Hall requested 20 minutes of cuts. Disney responded by cutting the film to 110 minutes. Among the cuts were Westerin', sung by Calvin, and I Couldn't Have Dreamed it Better, sung by Katie. The Sherman Brothers and producer Bill Anderson objected, but the studio heads told them the cuts would be just for the Music Hall's engagement. Robert B. Sherman pointed out that the Music Hall is where New York film critics screen musical films, arguing that the cuts weakened the characters' dramatic motivation. He also predicted that those cuts would result in negative reviews. Radio City Music Hall got its way, and the 110-minute version is the only one that ever saw a release. Sherman's predictions came true when the New York Times' critic Renata Adler panned the film after seeing it at the Music Hall, calling the film \\"about as pepless and fizzled a musical as has ever come out of the Walt Disney Studios.\\"Adler, Renata (March 22, 1968). \\"Film: 'One and Only Genuine Original Family Band\\". The New York Times. 55. As of 2014, Disney has made no attempt at a reconstruction of the originally intended cut, but sheet music of the two cut songs was included in the book Disney's Lost Chords, Volume 2. =Reception from other critics= The film fared no better among most other major critics. Variety described it as \\"an overly-contrived feature which soon forgets its promise and premise and turns instead to a political mishmash of events which has little novelty.\\"\\"Film Reviews: The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band\\". Variety. March 20, 1968. 6. Charles Champlin of The Los Angeles Times wrote that the film \\"is, I am afraid, the worst Disney movie in a long time.\\" According to Champlin, there were some \\"pleasant, chirpy tunes,\\" but they \\"can't overcome the lack of any real dramatic conflict, even at the level appropriate to musical comedy, nor the lack of an interesting central character.\\" Clifford Terry of the Chicago Tribune called it \\"another Walt Disney studio production that isn't designed to appease squirmy family audiences, since it is filled with a flurry of limpid songs, Brennan's tiresome tirades, and the Warren - Davidson 'mush.'\\" Edgar J. Driscoll Jr. of The Boston Globe said the film \\"flats like a tubeless tuba ‚Äî if there is such a thing. Not that the kids won't enjoy it. They will. But for adults the sasparilla may go down the wrong way. Certainly it's no runner-up to 'Mary Poppins' or 'The Sound of Music.' Not by a long shot, though the pitch is definitely aimed that-a-way.\\" One positive review of the film came from Lou Cedrone, who remarked in Baltimore's Evening Sun newspaper that \\"the Walt Disney studios have done with 'The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band' what they tried and failed to do with 'The Happiest Millionaire.' That is, the film is pleasant in the Disney tradition and what's more, the songs and dancing, the latter choreographed by Hugh Lambert, are especially nice.\\" =Box office and television airing= Bringing in $2,250,000 in rentals, it was never reissued to theaters; instead, it aired on The Wonderful World of Disney in two parts on January 23 and January 30, 1972. Home media While a planned 1979 MCA DiscoVision release with the catalog number D18-513 was cancelled, the film was released on videotape in 1981 and on LaserDisc in 1982. Several anthology series episodes were released through this deal, and several other live-action features were part of it, but only Kidnapped ever saw a DiscoVision release. After 20 years of unavailability, the film was released on DVD on July 6, 2004. Though the transfer was not in the original aspect ratio, it included an audio commentary from Richard M. Sherman, Lesley Ann Warren and John Davidson and a 12-minute making-of featurette featuring all three. Literary sources * Van Nuys, Laura Bower (1961).

The article states that the vendors paid a $2 per month fee to use the charity's name.McFadden, Robert. \\"Small-Change Donations Going to Vendors, Not Charities, Abrams Charges.\\" The New York Times. 12 11 1992. Web. 13 February 2010 Prevention in the United States of America There are controls and laws governing charities and businesses that accept donations. The Internal Revenue Servicehttps://www.irs.gov/charities/article/0,,id=169727,00.html (IRS) with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) has regulations that can be found on their websites. The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) provides online information about avoiding charity fraud, such as fraudulent schemes that emerge in the wake of natural disasters, claiming to be providing disaster relief. The Internet Crime Complaint Center maintains a list of guidelines to avoid charity fraud when making a donation. It is advised that people should follow certain guidelines when they donate and that they should consult a list such as the one on the BBB's website. This list includes the participants in the BBB Wise Giving Alliance's National Charity Seal Program. Participants have met standards for charity accountability and may, for a fee, display the seal logo on their websites as well as any other printed documents.National Charity Seal Program Contrast with badge charity Charity fraud is distinguished from badge charity in which the charity does exist, but an inordinate percentage the funds donated are absorbed by professional fundraisers and operating expenses of the charity rather than the causes described in solicitations.

Rhodes Memorial on Devil's Peak in Cape Town, South Africa, is a memorial to English-born, South African politician Cecil John Rhodes (1853‚Äì1902). The memorial was designed by the renowned architect, Sir Herbert Baker. Location The memorial is situated at Rhodes's favourite spot on the lower slopes of Devil's Peak. Rhodes's own wooden bench is still situated below the memorial. The magnificent view facing north-east can be imagined as the start of the Cape to Cairo road, Rhodes's imperial dream of a British colonial Africa which had Rhodes as one of its greatest champions. Rhodes owned vast areas of the lower slopes of Table Mountain, most of which he gave to the nation on his death. Part of his estate was used for the University of Cape Town upper campus, part is now the Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden, while much else of it was spared from development. Architecture Physical Energy by George Frederic Watts View to the east, past the statuary.A black and white photograph of one of the eight lions that flank the stairs at Rhodes Memorial. The architect, Sir Herbert Baker, allegedly modelled the memorial after the Greek temple at Segesta although it is actually closer to the temple of Pergamon in design. It consists of a massive staircase with 49 steps (one for each year of Rhodes's life) leading from a semi-circular terrace up to a rectangular U-shaped monument formed of pillars. The memorial is built of Cape granite quarried on Table Mountain. At the bottom of the steps is a bronze statue of a horseman, Physical Energy by George Frederic Watts. Eight bronze lions by John Macallan Swan flank the steps leading up to the memorial, with a bust of Rhodes (also by JM Swan). The inscription on the monument is \\"To the spirit and life work of Cecil John Rhodes who loved and served South Africa.\\" Inscribed below the bust of Rhodes are the last four lines of the last stanza from the 1902 poem Burial by Rudyard Kipling in honour of Rhodes: : The immense and brooding spirit still : Shall quicken and control. : Living he was the land, and dead, : His soul shall be her soul! The monument was completed and dedicated in 1912. A memorial proposed by the Colonial Secretary Earl Grey never materialised: a massive \\"colossus of Rhodes\\" statue overlooking Cape Town from the summit of Lion's Head, rather like the statue of Christ overlooking Rio de Janeiro. Outdoor activities Today the memorial is part of the Table Mountain National Park. There is a well-known tea room behind the memorial, and it is a popular viewpoint and picnicking spot which is frequented by students from the University of Cape Town (UCT) as well as Cape Town residents and also tourists. It is also a starting point for walking and hiking on Devil's Peak. Around the memorial are groves of oaks and stone pines from Europe, and there are also a few remaining pockets of the original Afromontane forest nearby. Just up the slope from Rhodes Memorial there is a small forest of a famous native tree called the Silvertree. Table Mountain is possibly the only place on earth where this majestic tree grows wild and Rhodes Memorial has one of the last surviving stands. Alien fallow deer used to live in the area, although they are now being eliminated to make way for the re- introduction of indigenous antelope species. Below the memorial is a game enclosure where eland, zebra and wildebeest are kept. Rhodes Memorial is not generally used for events but does host occasional performances, an annual Easter sunrise service, and is often used as a location for filming. For safety reasons, the area is closed from sunset to sunrise. The area around the memorial Not far below the memorial are the University of Cape Town (UCT), Groote Schuur Hospital and Mostert's Mill. Above the memorial is the King's Blockhouse, and not far away is the Groote Schuur Zoo site, originally established as Rhodes's private zoo. The zoo was closed in the late 1970s, and only the lion's den now remains. Rhodes's Groote Schuur estate nearby is now a South African presidential residence. A statue of Rhodes was situated on the UCT campus, on the lower part of Sarah Baartman Hall steps overlooking the university's rugby fields. This statue had become the focus of protests in March 2015 calling for its removal. It has now been permanently removed.  Vandalism  The bronze bust of Cecil John Rhodes at Rhodes Memorial before it was vandalised. The defaced bust in 2015 - note the missing nose. The decapitated bust in July 2020. In September 2015, the bronze bust of Rhodes at the memorial was vandalised. The nose was cut off and the memorial was daubed with graffiti accusing Rhodes of being a \\"Racist, thief, [and] murderer.\\" It appeared that the vandals had attempted to cut off the whole head. The nose was later restored by a local artist and historian. In July 2020, the bust was decapitated. The head was recovered nearby and reattached on Heritage Day later that year.

He is the former head coach of the Iona Gaels men's basketball team and the UDC Firebirds men's college basketball team. Early life and collegiate career A , 280 lb center, Ruland went from Sachem High School in Suffolk County, New York, to Iona College on a basketball scholarship and played for coach Jim Valvano before Valvano left for North Carolina State University. Ruland played on the Gaels' 1979‚Äì1980 team that beat eventual national champion Louisville, 77‚Äì60, at Madison Square Garden during the regular season and compiled a 29‚Äì5 record en route to a number 19 national ranking, the best in the school's history. However, Ruland was found in violation of NCAA rules by hiring an agent, Paul Corvino, at International Management Inc. and was ruled ineligible to play his senior year at Iona. Professional career Ruland was selected by the Golden State Warriors in the 1980 NBA draft with the 25th overall pick. During the 1980‚Äì81 NBA season he instead opted to play professionally in Barcelona, Spain for a year before returning to the U.S. Before his rookie campaign, his draft rights were traded by the Warriors to the Washington Bullets, with whom he played for five seasons before being traded to the Philadelphia 76ers. He retired after five games with them in 1987 after a nagging knee injury. =Washington Bullets playing career 1981‚Äì1986= Joining the Bullets for the 1981‚Äì82 NBA season, Ruland played behind 32-year-old Spencer Haywood but had greater per-game averages than him during the same number of minutes. Seeing time at both forward and center, Ruland showed muscle at both ends of the floor and an accurate jump shot good from as far as 20 feet. A 56% shooter from the floor, Ruland registered as having the 10th-best field goal percentage in the league. The Bullets made the second round of the playoffs before losing to the Boston Celtics. Ruland's playoff averages were 17 points and 9.4 rebounds per game off the bench. Ruland took over the starting power forward spot for the 1982‚Äì83 NBA season, and continued to back up at center for Washington. His 55% shooting and 11 rebounds per game ranked him, respectively, 10th and 8th place league-wide. Leading coach Gene Shue's balanced team in scoring as well, Ruland earned a spot in the NBA All-Star Game that year. With the same record as the year before, the Bullets did not make the playoffs this time. In the 1983‚Äì84 season, Ruland surged to 22 points and four assists per game. He was third in the NBA in rebounds and fifth in shooting from the floor. The team returned to the playoffs and again lost to Boston. Ruland averaged 24 points, 13 rebounds, 8 assists, 52% from the floor and 81% from the foul line against the eventual NBA champions. For the 1984‚Äì85 NBA season, Ruland was moved to the center for the Bullets. His stats dipped slightly. He remained among the rebounding and shooting leaders, but suffered a broken bone in his foot and played just 37 games. Ruland played through the pain in the playoffs, but the Bullets lost to the Philadelphia 76ers to end a disappointing season. The brittle feet, though, like Bill Walton before him, were now a condition. He played 30 games during the 1985‚Äì86 NBA season, usually in considerable pain. In the playoffs, the Bullets opted to start towering Manute Bol at the center. Ruland added 14 points and five assists per game off the bench. But the Bullets fell to Philadelphia again. =Later career= Traded to Philadelphia for Moses Malone the following season, Ruland played in five games before getting injured and subsequently retiring. Five years later Ruland made a comeback with the Sixers, playing in 13 games during the 1991‚Äì92 NBA season before sustaining an Achilles injury involving a luggage cart which was allegedly slammed into his leg by a Boston Celtics employee outside Boston Garden. He managed to play an additional 11 games with the Detroit Pistons the following season before retiring for good in January 1993. Coaching career After his playing days, Ruland became an assistant coach under the Sixers' Fred Carter during the 1993‚Äì94 NBA season. He then returned to coach at his alma mater.https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1998/05/05/at-iona-ruland- has-made-the-transition/575c1624-c11a-4907-b3d9-1b6f6ab99fb3/ He was fired from Iona on March 21, 2007, after a 2‚Äì28 record for the 2006‚Äì2007 season. Yet during his tenure as head coach, he guided the Gaels to three 20-win seasons, three MAAC Championships and three NCAA Tournament appearances. Recruiting and injuries were blamed for the team's abysmal record during his final season. A factor for the 2‚Äì28 season was that the administration fired Ruland's assistant coaches. Ruland could not recruit for that season. Ruland's termination as a head coach came from Iona College president James Liguori while he was on a cruise. On July 16, 2007, Ruland was hired to replace Michael Cooper as the head coach of the NBA D-League's Albuquerque Thunderbirds. After coaching the Thunderbirds for the 2007‚Äì08 season, Ruland was hired as an assistant coach for the Philadelphia 76ers on August 23, 2008. New 76ers head Coach Eddie Jordan decided not to retain Ruland for the 2009‚Äì10 season. On August 18, 2009, Ruland announced that he would be the new men's basketball head coach at the University of the District of Columbia. After a late September hiring and the first season with only one win, his third year saw a 22-win season.Ruland takes college coaching job at UDC August 18, 2009 He was fired in 2013.Jeff Ruland Will Not Return as Firebirds Head Men's Basketball Coach In 2015, Ruland was hired as an advance scout for the Washington Wizards.

It had been formerly the local telephone division (LTD) of Sprint Nextel until 2006, when it was spun off as an independent company. Embarq produced more than $6 billion in revenues annually, and had approximately 18,000 employees. In 2009, it was purchased by CenturyTel, which rebranded as CenturyLink (now known as Lumen Tech) after the merger. History =Brown Telephone Company= A 2009 image of the Embarq headquarters in Overland Park, Kansas. C. L. Brown founded Brown Telephone Company in the small town of Abilene, Kansas. The company was a landline telephone company that operated as a competitor to the Bell System. Brown acquired a number of other local telephone companies, merging them under the name United Telephone Company in 1911. =United Telecom= In 1938, after emerging from bankruptcy, United Telephone Company became United Utilities. The company grew steadily through acquisitions and changed its name to United Telecommunications in 1972, at which time it provided local telephone service in many areas of the Midwest and South. United Telecom also operated many other types of businesses. In 1980 United Telecom launched a national X.25 data service, Uninet. To enter the long-distance voice market, United Telecom acquired ISACOMM in 1981 and US Telephone in 1984. =Sprint= Southern Pacific Communications Company (SPCC), a unit of the Southern Pacific Railroad, began providing long-distance telephone service shortly after the MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. FCC (Execunet II) decision late in 1978. The railroad had an extensive microwave communications system along its rights of way used for internal communications. In 1972 they began selling surplus time on that system to corporations for use as their own Private Line Network, thereby circumventing AT&T;'s then-monopoly on public telephony, later expanding to fiber optic cables laid along those same rights of way subsequent to the Execunet II decision late in 1978. Prior attempts at offering long- distance service were not approved by the Federal Communications Commission, though the company's fax service (SpeedFAX) had been permitted. SPCC was headquartered in Burlingame, California, where Sprint still maintains a technology lab on Adrian Court. As mentioned above, SPCC was only permitted to provide Private Line service and not switched services. When MCI Communications released EXECUNET, SPCC went to court with the FCC to get the right to offer switched services. The SPRINT service was first marketed to six metropolitan areas, New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, San Diego and Anaheim. The switches were located in Los Angeles and New York. A customer, required to have a Private Line connection to one of these switches in order to use the service, paid an access fee per Private Line. The customer was then billed at 2.6 cents per tenth of a minute increment. Southern Pacific Communications became part of GTE in 1982 under the name GTE Sprint. GTE had previously acquired a national X.25 provider, Telenet, in 1979. In 1986, GTE Sprint was merged with GTE Telenet, US Telecom, Uninet, and ISACOMM to form US Sprint. This was a partnership owned by GTE and United Telecom. In 1989 United Telecom purchased controlling interest in US Sprint. In 1991 United Telecom completed its acquisition of US Sprint. That same year United Telecom changed its name to Sprint due in large part to the increased brand recognition of Sprint, as a result of the successful Candice Bergen \\"Dime Lady\\" advertisement campaign. In 1983, United Telecom's Telespectrum began offering cellular telephone services in United's territories. In 1988, Telespectrum was sold to Centel for $763 million to fund United's purchase of an additional 30% of U.S. Sprint. This purchase gave United operational control of US Sprint. In 1993, Sprint merged with Centel, which allowed Sprint to provide local service in a total of 18 states and put them back in the wireless business. In late 1994 and early 1995, Sprint via Sprint Spectrum (a joint venture between Sprint and several cable companies) acquired near nationwide PCS spectrum. Later in 1995 the company began to offer wireless service under the Sprint PCS brand. On October 5, 1999, Sprint and MCI WorldCom announced a $129 billion merger agreement between the two companies. The deal would have been the largest corporate merger in history at the time. However, the deal did not go through because of pressure from the United States Department of Justice and the European Union on concerns of it creating a monopoly. In 2003, Sprint began recombining their local telecom, long-distance, wireline, and wireless business units into a new company, marketing the combined company as \\"One Sprint\\". In April 2004, the separately traded wireless tracking stock, \\"PCS\\", was absorbed into the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) \\"FON\\" ticker symbol, Sprint's former ticker symbol. (FON stood for \\"Fiber Optic Network\\", which was Sprint's bragging right, but was also a homophone of the word \\"phone\\"). This was challenged in many lawsuits by Sprint PCS shareholders claiming the stock was devalued through the ratio of 1 share of PCS stock for 1/2 share of FON stock. Sprint agreed to settle with the shareholders for $57.5 million. =Merger with Nextel and Embarq spinoff= In December 2004, Sprint announced it would acquire NEXTEL Communications, renaming itself Sprint Nextel, and planned to spin off their local telephone operations. The $35 billion deal was completed in August 2005. In February 2006, the new name and logo for the spin-off, which is called Embarq, were revealed. The spin-off was completed in May 2006. =Acquisition by CenturyTel= On October 27, 2008, Embarq announced that it would be acquired by Monroe, Louisiana-based CenturyTel, Inc. in an all-stock transaction valued at $11.6 billion, including the assumption of $5.8 billion in Embarq's debt. CenturyTel's CEO Glen Post became CEO of the combined company. On June 2, 2009, CenturyTel and Embarq announced that the combined entity would be called CenturyLink. The acquisition was completed on July 1, 2009. The change to CenturyLink took place in October 2009. Former coverage area Embarq's coverage territory included that of the former incumbent local exchange carrier companies of Carolina Telephone & Telegraph, United Telephone Company, and Centel. Embarq provided its local service in 19 states. Products pay phone Embarq focused on sales of landline telephone service, high-speed internet, and DISH Network satellite TV. Embarq offered bundled services to their customers, with the convenience of one monthly bill and offered discounts for adding additional services. Embarq telephone service was a traditional landline Plain-old telephone system (POTS). Common offerings included features such as Caller ID, Call waiting, 3-way calling, Call forwarding, Voice mail, and Anonymous call rejection. Embarq offered many long-distance plans, including unlimited domestic direct- dialed calling. Depending on market and geographical region, Embarq offered several high-speed internet technologies. Embarq covered the majority of their territory with ADSL at speeds of 768 kbit/s, 1.5 Mbit/s, 3.0 Mbit/s, or 5.0 Mbit/s as line conditions allowed. In September 2007 Embarq began offering 10.0 Mbit/s to customers in Las Vegas. Beginning in January 2008, Embarq released the 10 Mbit/s tier across their entire footprint. Embarq offered fiber-to-the-premises (FTTP) in additional markets, such as parts of Las Vegas, Nevada, North Carolina and Florida. Embarq had an established partnership with EchoStar-owned Dish Network and offered a comprehensive lineup of DISH Network services to its customers. Discounts were available when eligible DISH Network programming was bundled with other qualifying Embarq products. In addition to the DISH Network partnership, Embarq also planned to test a TV service (tentatively called Embarq TV) in the near future. Details were scarce, but the service was rumored to have been an IPTV fiber-to-the-node service similar to AT&T;'s U-verse. Testing was completed and Embarq/CenturyLink rolled out IPTV to its customer base in Jefferson City, MO in October 2009. CenturyTel is providing its IPTV feed to the Jefferson City switching office from its service in Columbia, MO. CenturyLink now offers its Prism TV service in select markets, which was based on Embarq TV. Legacy Embarq customers who have DISH Network can still bundle their service with CenturyLink, but only under a grandfather clause; new customers can only get DirecTV if Prism TV isn't available. Embarq provided wireless phone service only for business accounts; they closed residential wireless business. Embarq provided business wireless phone service throughout much of its territory. Embarq operated as a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) for Sprint PCS. Embarq utilized the CDMA band, and their handsets connect primarily to Sprint PCS towers. However, Embarq handsets were also capable of roaming onto CDMA networks from other carriers. Embarq DSL customers were offered free EarthLink services until the formation of Myembarq.com. In February 2007, Embarq customers were required to switch to Myembarq and Embarqmail.

Published by William Palmer. 1852. Incorporation of Pittston, Chapter IV p.720 He arrived near the beginning of serious tensions between the colonists and the British. A strong patriot, Colburn, a lumberman and shipbuilder, took up arms in 1775 when the revolution started, obtaining command of his local committee of safety. To bring local Indians in on the American side, he gathered the Abenaki tribes of the St. Francis. Traveling by canoe Colburn led them to Cambridge, Massachusetts for an audience with General George Washington at his temporary headquarters. A surprised Washington welcomed them with open arms and enlisted the chiefs on the spot.Fitzpatrick, John C., Ed. The Writings of George Washington, 1745-1799-Vol.3 Washington to Philip Schuyler, August 15, 1775, Note 99 When informed of a plan to capture Quebec City under the command of American Colonel Benedict Arnold, Colburn offered his services to the Continental army, complete with scouts, maps, and boats. Arnold was enthusiastic about the new support and wrote Colburn immediately: > Sir, His Excellency General Washington Desires you will Inform your self how > soon, there can be procured, or built, at Kennebec, Two hundred light > Bateaux Capable of Carrying Six or Seven Men each, with their Provisions & > Baggage, (say 100 wt. to each man) the Boats to be furnished with four Oars > two Paddles & two Setting Poles each, the expense of Building them & whether > a sufficient quantity of Nails can be procured with you. Smith (Arnold's March), pp. 96 and 97 Colburn sped to Maine, making plans for the expedition. Once home, he put his crew to work building the bateaux and procuring the foodstuffs from the local citizenry, many of them Tories unsympathetic to the patriot cause. He ordered maps and sent three scouts to explore the upper Dead River ahead of the coming army. Colburn made three trips to Cambridge during August of that year while the crews, under the supervision of his brothers, Oliver and Benjamin Colburn, and partner Thomas Agry, labored to fill the contract. They had only fifteen days to complete the task. Due to the short time frame and time of year, no dried pine was available and he was forced to cut fresh green pine to attach to the oak ribs.Smith, Justin H. Arnold‚Äôs March from Cambridge to Quebec: A Critical Study, Together with a Reprint of Arnold‚Äôs Journal. New York: G. Putnam‚Äôs Sons, 1903. Notes to pages 74-83, note 16. pp. 299,300. Ibid. Note 10, pp. 298-299. When the transports arrived on September 20, 1775, the bateaux were just about finished. With Arnold on the transport Broad Bay was a 19-year-old volunteer soldier by the name of Aaron Burr. Both were entertained in the Colburn home for three days until the army moved on upriver to Fort Western. Many legends surround the activities of Burr, but his stay with Reuben and Elizabeth Colburn is well documented. Two divisions remained at Colburn House for a week. Colburn followed the expedition with a company of carpenters, fixing the flotilla as needed. The army barely made it through to supplies in Canada, and the 600 remaining men led by Arnold later mounted an unsuccessful attack on Quebec. Most of the commanders were captured and Arnold received the leg wound that plagued him for the rest of his days. Colburn and his brothers returned to Pittston, where he continued to build ships and support the American cause for the remainder of the war. He served in the Massachusetts General Court and was a delegate to the Falmouth Convention, where he was the first to vote for statehood for Maine. That effort failed. Colburn was never paid in full the money promised him by Washington. Thus, in the winter of 1776, when he first contacted Washington about the matter, a campaign began to gain payment that would last until the last family member failed in 1856. *September 1775 Colburn received a cash payment of ¬£332 10s 6d receipted September 12, 1775 with a credit to the United States of ¬£159 10s 6d .

The Committee ruled that there was sufficient time until 1794 for the claim to have been settled until barred by the statute of limitations; and that to admit a claim after 40 years after being barred was inexpedient and that claim should not be granted.1834 American State Papers .p.667 Kenneth Roberts' 1929 novel Arundel mentions Reuben Colburn on several pages. The journals of the members of the original expedition compiled by Roberts in March to Quebec are a critical primary source for the ill-fated Arnold Expedition. A new biography of Reuben Colburn: \\"Patriot on the Kennebec: Major Reuben Colburn, Benedict Arnold and the March to Quebec 1775\\" by Colburn descendant Mark A.

On January 16, 2019, Fiserv announced a deal to acquire First Data in all-stock deal with equity value of $22 billion. Fiserv completed the acquisition of First Data on Monday July 29, 2019.https://financefeeds.com/fiserv-completes-acquisition-first-data/ History In 1969, the Mid-America Bankcard Association (MABA) was formed in Omaha, Nebraska, as a non-profit bankcard processing cooperative. Two years later, First Data Resources (FDR) was founded in Omaha, Nebraska in June 1971. It started off by providing processing services to the Mid-America Bankcard Association (MABA). In 1976, First Data became the first processor of Visa and MasterCard bank-issued credit cards. In 1980, American Express Information Services Corporation (ISC) bought 80% of First Data. The remaining 20% was purchased in 5% increments each subsequent year until June 1983. First Data Corporation was incorporated on the 7th of April, 1989. First Data Corporation spun off from American Express and went public in 1992. In 1995, the company merged with First Financial Management Corp. (FFMC) and was then organized into three major business units serving card issuers, merchants and consumers. Western Union became part of First Data as a result of the merger with FFMC. =Expansion= From 2001 through 2005, a period of expansion occurred as First Data acquired companies around the globe and in the US, including, in 2001, the acquisition of PaySys International and their VisionPLUS Payment Software System. VisionPLUS was followed by a $6.6 billion merger with Concord EFS, Inc. in 2004, which added the STAR Network and PIN-based debit acceptance at more than 1.9 million ATM and retail locations. Additional acquisitions and strategic relationships included GovOne, eONEGlobal, Paymap, Inc., and Taxware. Nevertheless, First Data eventually divested, closed down or absorbed these businesses. On January 26, 2006, First Data announced its intention to spin off Western Union into an independent publicly traded company through a tax-free spin-off of 100% of Western Union to First Data shareholders. The spin off occurred as planned on September 29, 2006. On April 2, 2007, it was announced that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) had entered an agreement to acquire First Data in one of the largest leveraged buy-outs in history, and on October 1, 2007, KKR officially took over the First Data Corporation. Ric Duques retired, and Michael Capellas, previously the CEO of MCI Inc., the president of Hewlett-Packard Company, and also the chairman/CEO of the Compaq Computer Corporation was appointed CEO. As a privately owned company, First Data's stock was taken off the New York Stock Exchange on September 24, 2007. However, the company's LBO was financed with $24 billion in debt, and it remains heavily leveraged. In June 2014, First Data raised a historic $3.5 billion private placement. $1.2 billion of the placement came from KKR; however the majority, $2.3 billion, was from hedge funds, mutual funds and institutions. With this action the company reduced total debt by $3.3 billion, improving net leverage by 1.3 turns and significantly reducing annual cash interest payments. The company continues to maintain investor relations pages on its web site and to publish quarterly financial results. Within two months of the KKR acquisition, the company laid off 1,700 employees across North America, Europe and Australia, about 6% of its workforce. First Data provided Go-Tag (contactless and mobile payment technology) stickers to delegates and media representatives at the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, who used them to buy food and beverages. These stickers possessed NFC chips which were read by First Data scanners, which through its back-end system deducted the purchase sum from the Go-Tag ID's balance. First Data also provided the trusted service manager that provisioned accounts to the new mobile Google Wallet system. First Data entered the Ireland market in a joint venture with Allied Irish Banks PLC named AIB Merchant Services on January 18, 2008. First Data also acquired ICICI Bank's merchant services business in 2009 for 4 billion Indian rupees (US$80 million). It also partnered with Bank of America in 2009 to form Bank of America Merchant Services. First Data and KKR vetted more than 60 startups before, in October 2013, announcing it had acquired POS startup Clover, cardless mobile loyalty startup Perka. and Gyft in 2014. In March 2010, Joe Forehand took over as chairman and interim CEO. In September that same year, Jonathan Judge assumed those roles until his early retirement in January 2013, after which Edward Labry covered the interim post. =Under Frank Bisignano= In April 2013, First Data's Board of Directors announced that former JPMorgan Chase Co-COO Frank Bisignano had been named Chief Executive Officer of the company. In March 2014, Bisignano assumed the role of Chairman. Upon taking office, Bisignano launched an equity ownership plan for all 24,000 of First Data owner-associates. In 2014, Bisignano promoted notable additions to the company's staff, such as Sanjiv Das, Himanshu Patel, Guy Chiarello, Cindy Armine-Klein, Andrew Gelb, Adam Rosman, Carmen Menendez-Puerto, Joseph Plumeri, Christopher Augustin and Michael Manos. In early 2014, First Data's STAR ATM Network adopted the Visa and MasterCard common application IDs for EMV-compliant debit transactions. Since joining, Bisignano has tried to \\"transform First Data into a provider of new technology for small- and medium-sized businesses\\". In June 2014, First Data introduced the Insightics solution for small and medium size businesses. Insightics is a cloud-based software that enables small and medium size businesses to monitor key business metrics. First Data created Insightics with Palantir. In August 2014, First Data expanded its presence in Brazil with Bin, the company's acquiring solution developed specifically for the local market. In September 2014, First Data announced it would provide encryption technology for Apple Pay. Apple Pay allows payment with a single touch. With its integration into First Data's STAR Network, the company became a token service provider, supporting safe POS transactions in Apple Pay. Such transactions are used in venues such as all McDonald's restaurants in the US. In October 2014, First Data announced the Enhanced TransArmor Solution for small businesses. First Data's TransArmor Solution protects payment card data throughout the transaction process, incorporating several security and compliance products into one multi-layered solution. In late 2014, First Data announced its collaboration with Capgemini to develop new solutions based on First Data's AccessPLUS and VisionPLUS products, planning to offer new technologies in the second quarter of 2015. The company also announced its partnership with Verifone, wherein merchants using integrated point-of-sale systems that process payments will have a security option when using terminals made by VeriFone Systems Inc. In 2015, Samsung announced its Samsung Pay mobile system in conjunction with First Data. Samsung Pay uses NFC to make payments at POS systems that accept First Data's technology. In February 2015, First Data reported its first profitable quarter in 29 quarters since its 2007 privatization. In July 2015, First Data acquired Transaction Wireless, a provider of gift card solutions. In September that year, First Data Corporation acquired Spree Commerce, an open source e-commerce platform. Details of the transaction were not disclosed. In the biggest U.S. IPO of 2015 according to Bloomberg, First Data planned to seek a minimum of $2.5 billion, even up to $3.2 billion (according to Bloomberg) or $3.7 billion (according to the Wall Street Journal). In October that year, First Data sold 160 million shares for $16 apiece, after offering them for $18 and $20. It raised $2.56 billion. According to Bloomberg: \\"lowering First Data's debt level will be an important step for the company because it will free up money to invest in the business\\". =2016 and 2017= First Data and Alipay announced a partnership in October 2016 to bring Alipay's mobile payment processing to the United States.Ant Financial partners with First Data and Verifone as part of its global expansion TechCrunch Later in 2017, First Data and Alipay announced the implementation of the \\"point-of-sale\\" technology,Alipay, China's top mobile payment service, expands to the U.S. TechCrunch and that Clover would be the first point-of-sale to accept the mobile payment method.First Data to Power Alipay in North America First Data In 2017 First Data announced the launch of their Integrated Solutions Group (ISG), with Edward Jackson to lead the new business segment.

Ct. App. 1991), is a Minnesota Court of Appeals case that established a lesbian's partner as her legal guardian after Sharon Kowalski became incapacitated following an automobile accident. Because the case was contested by Kowalski's parents and family and initially resulted in the partner being excluded for several years from visiting Kowalski, the gay community celebrated the final resolution in favor of the partner as a victory for gay rights. Facts and prior history Sharon Kowalski, a high school teacher of physical education and health, lived with her partner, Karen Thompson (born 1947), in St. Cloud, Minnesota, for about four years. Although Kowalski's parents were not aware of the relationship at the time, the couple had exchanged rings and named one another as insurance policy beneficiaries. On November 13, 1983, Kowalski suffered severe brain injuries in an automobile accident involving a drunk driver. The injuries left Kowalski with permanent physical disabilities, requiring her to remain in a wheelchair, and the mental capacity of a four- to six-year-old child. Both Thompson and Sharon Kowalski's father, Donald Kowalski, petitioned to be named Sharon Kowalski's legal guardian in March 1984. With the understanding that she would have visitation rights, Thompson agreed that Donald Kowalski would be named Sharon Kowalski's guardian. The court's guardianship order, issued in July 1985, gave Donald complete control over visitation. On July 25, 1985, Donald cut off Thompson's visitation rights and moved Sharon from a nursing home near Thompson's home to one a five-hour drive away. Thompson appealed the order, but the appellate court initially affirmed the order, citing testimony by Sharon's family and nursing home staff that Sharon seemed depressed and sad after her visits with Thompson and postulating that it would be in Kowalski's best interest to discontinue Thompson's visits. In a letter to the court, the Kowalski's family physician wrote: \\"Visits by Karen Thompson at this time would expose Sharon Kowalski to a high risk of sexual abuse.\\" Donald Kowalski told an interviewer: \\"Karen Thompson kicked herself out of there by being so aggressive and by driving Sharon into a deep depression. She told Sharon she was being held prisoner, that she was in a dangerous environment. If you couldn't talk and you were lying there, wouldn't that put you in a depression?\\" He denied his daughter was a lesbian. Several gay rights and civil liberties groups joined Thompson in her efforts to reestablish her visitation rights and acquire guardianship. Public awareness of the case was increased by local and international publicity, including fundraising concerts by lesbian singer and songwriter Ann Reed. Events in 21 cities marked \\"National Free Sharon Kowalski Day\\" in August 1988. Thomas B. Stoddard, executive director of the Lambda Legal, an LGBT gay rights advocacy group, commented: \\"there is no other case that approaches this one in symbolic importance\\". He said the case \\"has touched the deepest nerve in the gay community across the United States because it triggers the two deepest fears of every gay person: a fight among loved ones and denial of personal wishes.\\" In May 1988, a federal judge asked specialists to conduct a study of Sharon to determine whether she had sufficient mental capacity to express her wishes with regard to visitation, and, if so, to determine what her wishes were. During that evaluation process, Thompson was allowed to visit Sharon for the first time in several years. The Miller-Dwan Medical Center specialists determined that Sharon did have the capacity to do so, and based on their understanding of Sharon's wishes Thompson was allowed to resume limited visitation in January 1989. In March 1989, Thompson published a book about her experience with co-author Dr. Julie Andrzejewski, titled Why Can't Sharon Kowalski Come Home? In late 1988, because of his deteriorating health, Donald Kowalski asked the court appoint a new guardian. Thompson filed an uncontested petition to be named Sharon's successor guardian in August 1989. A hearing on the petition was held in August 1990. Because a Kowalski family friend, Karen Tomberlin, had contacted Sharon's attorney requesting to testify against Thompson's guardianship, the court deferred consideration of Thomson's guardianship petition until it could conduct an evidentiary hearing. At that hearing, Thompson called sixteen medical witnesses who testified about Sharon's mental state, her interaction with Thompson, and her preference in regard to visitation. Three witnesses opposed to Thompson's guardianship; Sharon's sister, Tomberlin, and another family friend, also testified. Donald Kowalski told the court that he and his wife would not visit their daughter if Thompson became guardian. Judge Robert Campbell of the St. Louis County District Court in Duluth, Minnesota, denied Thompson's petition on April 19, 1991, and named Tomberlin as Sharon's guardian. He wrote that Thompson \\"has demonstrated commitment and devotion to the welfare of Sharon Kowalski\\" and that he recognized her contributions to Sharon's therapy and counseling and understanding of her \\"medical, material and social needs.\\" He stated Sharon Kowalski's own wishes: \\"In the past two years, when asked where she would like to live, Sharon has consistently said, 'St. Cloud with Karen.'\\" He counted against Thompson's petition her disclosure of Sharon's sexual orientation \\"to Sharon's parents and the world without Sharon's consent\\" and the fact that Thompson had established \\"other domestic partnerships\\" since Sharon's accident. Thomas B. Stoddard, executive director of the Lambda Legal Defense Fund, called the decision \\"a deep offense not only to all lesbians and gay men, but to all Americans who choose their partners and households by their own terms and not the legal rules imposed by society.\\" He said: \\"Sharon chose her family. But the judge doesn't agree, so he imposed his own vision on her.\\" The case The Minnesota Court of Appeals ruled in Thompson's favor on December 17, 1991. Thompson attorney commented: \\"This seems to be the first guardianship case in the nation in which an appeals court recognized a homosexual partner's rights as tantamount to those of a spouse\\". The court began its analysis by citing the applicable guardianship statutes, which provided that the court should make a guardianship decision based on the best interests of the ward. \\"Best interests of the ward\\" is defined in the statute, but requires the court to consider the reasonable preference of the ward or conservatee if a preference can be determined. With the statute in mind, the court stated that Sharon Kowalski has stated a clear preference for Thompson to be her guardian, citing the study by the Miller-Dwan specialists. The court noted that the three witnesses opposed to Thompson's appointment were all lay witnesses with no medical training. In regard to Thompson's qualifications to serve as a guardian, the court stated that testimony from multiple witnesses established that Thompson had been loving and caring when dealing with Sharon and was able to take care of her on a day-to-day basis. Finally, the court addressed the lower court's concern that Thompson was involving Sharon in multiple gay and lesbian public events‚Äìthe case had generated considerable media attention‚Äìthat her family testified she might not otherwise choose to attend. The court said that the lower court's reliance on this in its guardianship decision was misguided, as the record indicated that Sharon enjoyed these events and even received an award at a National Organization for Women meeting. The court concluded that while a trial court has wide discretion in guardianship proceedings, the court abused its discretion in this case in denying Thompson's petition against the weight of evidence. It removed Tomberlin from Sharon Kowalski's guardianship and appointed Thompson in her place. It said: \\"All the medical testimony established that Sharon has the capacity reliably to express a preference in this case, and she has clearly chosen to return home with Thompson if possible. This choice is further supported by the fact that Thompson and Sharon are a family of affinity, which ought to be accorded respect.\\" Effects of the decision The Kowalski decision was viewed as a victory for gay rights by the gay community. The American Bar Association's Journal reported the decision under the heading: \\"Gay-Rights Victory: Minnesota woman named guardian of her disabled lesbian lover\\". A video, Lifetime Commitment: A Portrait of Karen Thompson, was produced in 1994, and three plays have been based on Kowalski's case. The case also highlighted the importance of durable power of attorney and other legal strategies for homosexual couples wishing to establish guardianship rights in comparable situations. The first Disability Pride Parade in the United States was held in Boston in 1990, and the featured speaker was Karen Thompson. Karen Thompson received several awards for her work to achieve LGBT equality, including 2012, \\"100 Women We Love\\" from Go Magazine, the Liberty Award from Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, and the 1989 Annual Humanitarian Award from the American Psychological Association. Together Thompson and Sharon Kowalski received the 1990 Woman of Courage Award from the National Organization for Women,Feminist Chronicles - 1990, accessed April 5, 2015 the 1991 Feminist of the Year Award from the Feminist Majority Foundation, and a 1990 Creating Change Award from the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. , Thompson was still making public appearances to discuss the case and the issues it raised.

Currently it is the seat of the Landtag of Lower Saxony. The first building on the site was a Franciscan friary, constructed in about 1300, which was abandoned in 1533 after the Protestant Reformation. In 1636, George, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg, began construction of a rather small late renaissance palace on the site as his residence. Elector Ernest Augustus had it enlarged and modernized and added a theatre in the late 17th century. In 1742 the north-west wing was renewed. Between 1816 and 1844, the architect Georg Ludwig Friedrich Laves fully re-built the palace. The column portico with six Corinthian columns was built during this period. During World War II, the Leineschloss burnt out entirely after British aerial bombings. King George I of Great Britain was originally buried in the Chapel of the Leineschloss, but his remains, along with his parents', were moved to the 19th-century mausoleum of King Ernest Augustus in the Berggarten of Herrenhausen Palace after World War II. Architect Dieter Oesterlen re-built the palace between 1957 and 1962. In August 2016 bones were found in the Leineschloss during a renovation project; it was believed that the bones were the remains of Philip Christoph von K√∂nigsmarck, the lover of the wife of the later king George I of Great Britain who was killed there in July, 1694.A Skeleton Found in a Castle Could Be the Key to Cracking a 17th-Century Cold Case Smithsonian Magazine, 18 October 2016Lag ermordeter Graf 323 Jahre unterm Leineschloss Hannoversche Allgemeine, 26 August 2016 However, subsequent tests proved that some of the bones were from animals, while the human bones came from at least five different skeletons.

The strict objectivity of the Bauhaus building in Dessau, which Oesterlen visited in the years before he started his architectural degree, made a lasting impression on him. Education In 1930 Oesterlen enrolled at the University of Stuttgart, where he trained under Paul Schmitthenner. The latter's conservative architectural philosophy, which later went on to be known as the Stuttgart School, was as far removed from the Bauhaus ideals as it could be. This did create a dilemma for Oesterlen. But he was also drawn to Schmitthenner's philosophy of looking at a building's design and detail as a homogeneous whole. Early career After graduating from the University Oesterlen worked for a year at Hugo Keuerleber in Stuttgart. Then he enrolled at the TH Berlin-Charlottenburg. There he initially with Heinrich Tessenowstra√üe, but changed a semester later to learning from Poelzig, who was at that time regarded as the best teacher of architecture in the Weimar Republic. His work was part of the architecture event in the art competition at the 1936 Summer Olympics.

First published by Garland publishing in 1996 (), it is 336 pages long. Bonnie Wheeler is the Director of the Medieval Studies Program at Southern Methodist University. Charles Wood is emeritus professor of history at Dartmouth College. The essays in the book are arranged in roughly chronological order, beginning with studies and investigations in Joan's own time and proceeding to those of later years. Contents * Preface (by Charles T. Wood) * Joan of Arc's Sword in the Stone (by Bonnie Wheeler). A brief discussion of Joan's sword, obtained from the church of Sainte-Catherine-de-Fierbois and its relation to other famous swords with mystic powers such as those of King Arthur (Excaliber), Roland (Durendal), El Cid (Tizona and Colada), Charlemagne (Joyeuse), and others. Wheeler discusses how such swords serve the functions of identifying, authenticating, or legitimizing the possessor, and she discusses specifically what Joan's sword meant to her (Joan) and her contemporaries, including the judges at the condemnation trial. * A Woman as Leader of Men: Joan of Arc's Military Career (by Kelly DeVries). Kelly DeVries, author of Joan of Arc: A Military Leader, addresses as his main concern the question as to why the French soldiers followed Joan? After a brief outline of Joan's military career, he argues that Joan, in contrast to other non-noble military leaders who secured a following by offering the rewards of plunder, Joan relied on her spiritual and religious example to motivate her soldiers. * Joan of Arc's Mission and the Lost Record of Her Interrogation at Poitiers (by Charles T. Wood) The lost record of the examination at Poitiers is the biggest gap in the biographical record of Joan of Arc. Charles Wood examines this matter in an attempt to discover why the records of that examination went missing, or whether in fact they were deliberately destroyed. He speculates as to why this might have been done, and how their suppression might have been undertaken out of political considerations at the time of (or before) the rehabilitation trial in the 1450s. * True Lies: Transvestism and Idolatry in the Trial of Joan of Arc (by Susan Schibanoff) * Was Joan of Arc a \\"Sign\\" of Charles VII's Innocence (by Jean Fraikin) * Transcription Errors in the Texts of Joan of Arc's History (by Olivier Bouzy) * \\"I Do Not Name to You the Voice of St. Michael\\": The Identification of Joan of Arc's Voices (by Karen Sullivan) * Readers of the Lost Arc: Secrecy, Secularity, and Speculation in the Trial of Joan of Arc (by Steven Weiskopf) * Joan of Arc and Christine de Pizan: The Symbiosis of Two Warriors in the Ditie de Jehanne d'Arc (by Christine McWebb) * Christine de Pizan's Pro-Joan Propaganda (by Anne D.

Owned by the Georgia Public Telecommunications Commission, it is a sister station to National Public Radio (NPR) member WSVH (91.1 FM). WVAN-TV's transmitter is located in Pembroke, west of Savannah and north of Fort Stewart. The station is operated as part of the statewide Georgia Public Broadcasting (GPB) television network. Although the call letters could be mistaken as a reference to SaVANnah, they are a tribute to former Georgia governor Ernest VANdiver. Like other stations in the Savannah media market, WVAN-TV also serves the southern tip of South Carolina including Beaufort and Hilton Head Island, giving that area a second option for PBS programming alongside SCETV station WJWJ-TV (channel 16).  History On September 17, 1963, WVAN-TV broadcast its first program as the fourth educational television station of the Georgia state.  Station ID  In legal identifications for GPB's television stations, each station lists two cities: one where the station is licensed, which is often a small community where the transmitter is located, and a second a typically larger city that it serves. WVAN is unusual in that it is licensed to Savannah, with its much smaller second city, Pembroke, housing the transmitter.

It is affiliated with the federal Young Liberals, and is involved in activism and campaigning alongside YL. The former President of OULD, Finn Conway is also currently Chair of Young Liberals. It is the official successor to both the Oxford University Liberal Club and the Oxford University Social Democrats, which voted to merge early in 1987, about a year in advance of the national parties. History The Oxford University Liberal Club was founded in 1913,Bloch, M., 'Jeremy Thorpe', London, 2014 with the stated aim to \\"rally progressive members of the University to the support of Liberal principles\\".Bentley, M., 'The Liberal Mind 1914-29', 174, Cambridge, 2007 Its foundation date makes it the oldest political society founded at an English university. It was formed from a merger of two older Liberal societies at Oxford, the Russell Club, and the Palmerston Club, both of which dated to at least the 1870s, and had as their goals the promotion of liberal politics. Around in the early 1900s was also a society called the 'Liberal League', founded \\"in defence of free trade\\". Originally holding premises on the corner of Cornmarket Street and George Street, open for the majority of the day, the society was modeled after the usual gentlemen's clubs of the day, before the arrival of World War One and the general reduction in the student body of Oxford. The society faced further problems in the 1920s, as around half of its members defected and joined the newly established Labour Club, as well as the New Reform Club, a pro-Lloyd George group, reflecting the division of the national Liberal Party at the time. Revitalization occurred with the coming to the fore of Harold Wilson, Treasurer in Hilary 1935, along with Frank Byers as President and Raymond Walton as Secretary. Efforts made to provide a stronger draw to the society - including the institution of a society newspaper and library - had membership treble to over 300. Membership continued to grow during and after the war, with its peak hit under the Presidency of Jeremy Thorpe in 1950, of over 1000 members. By this point, the Liberal Club had become more of a social club, including drinking events, balls, and parties, some of which are continued by the society in its modern form. Turbulence for the national party meant turbulence for the society itself, however, and the party's catastrophic collapse in the 1960s, combined with mergers throughout the late 1970s and 1980s, led to a smaller membership and a series of renamings and mergers for the society at large. After merging the Oxford University Liberal Club and the Oxford University Social Democrats in 1987, however, the society in its present structure was formed, with a smaller membership focussed more heavily on campaigning, but maintaining the social functions from its post-war heyday.  Organisation and constitution  The society is run by a committee as established under the society's Constitution, with elections taking place at the end of each term. The constitution may be changed by a majority at the Termly General Meeting or an Extraordinary General Meeting, called by Senior Officers or seven members of the society, with any member being able to submit amendments. At the Termly General Meeting the President and Treasurer must both submit reports on the state of the society and its accounts. The committee is elected each term and is made up of a President, President-elect, Treasurer, Secretary as well as a number of Junior Officers and General Committee members who oversee social events, campaigning, and the main society meeting each week, 'Spirited Discussions'. The President-elect is elected a term in advance of their term as President, the Treasurer is elected for two terms, and all other Officers and General Committee members are elected at the end of a term to serve in the next term. There are also a number of appointed committee roles, such as the LGBT+ Officer, the Women's Officer, the Social Backgrounds Officer, the Ethnic Minorities Officer, the IT Officer, the Charities Officer, the Editor and the Returning and Deputy Returning Officers. The society has an Honorary President, currently former Liberal Democrat Chief Whip and MP for North Cornwall Lord Tyler, who regularly speaks at the society and hosts an annual tour of the Palace of Westminster. There is also a Senior Member, as constitutionally required by the Proctors, who is usually a member of the academic staff who oversees the Society, signs off on the accounts and has a role within the internal disputes and disciplinary procedures. For a full list of Former Presidents, see Former Presidents of Oxford University Liberal Club and Oxford University Liberal Democrats. Role =Elections= Its members are active in local campaigns, especially in parliamentary elections. Towards the late 20th century, Oxford West and Abingdon was a Conservative-Liberal Democrat marginal. It returned Dr Evan Harris from 1997 until 2010, when he was defeated by Nicola Blackwood, a Conservative candidate. However, in the 2017 election the constituency was won by Layla Moran, thereby swinging it back to the Liberal Democrats. In neighboring Oxford East, traditionally a safe Labour seat, there was an 11.2% swing towards the Lib Dems in 2005 general election. The margin of victory for Andrew Smith in 2005 was 963 votes - a 90% decrease from 2001. However, at the 2010 general election, Andrew Smith achieved a 4.1% swing in his favour, holding the seat for Labour by a margin of 4,581 votes, and in 2015, the Liberal Democrats collapsed into fourth place, behind Labour, the Conservatives, and the Greens. =Liberal Democrats and Young Liberals= While formal affiliation does not exist, the society is associated with the Liberal Democrats and its youth wing the Young Liberals, and both past and present members of the society have been elected into roles within the federal Young Liberals.  Events  =Spirited discussions= The main event of the society is 'Spirited Discussions', which is a weekly debate and involves the discussion of two pre-announced motions of political and philosophical importance alongside drinking spirits. =Speaker events= The society organises regular speaker events with current and former liberal politicians, recent visitors have included Lord Tyler, Tom Brake MP, Paddy Ashdown, Konstantin Kuhle, Martin Horwood and Tessa Munt. =Dinners= The society usually hosts several dinner events, the most regular being a Termly Dinner at the end of each term, which is sometimes a formal dinner with guest speaker and sometimes an informal dinner with just society members. The society also hosts an annual Alumni Dinner, where former members of the University are invited and acts as a major fundraising event for the society. =Social events= The society organizes regular non-drinking events such as \\"Cold Takes\\", which involves casual discussions while eating ice cream from G&D;'s, and \\"Punting Liberally\\" which involves Punting.

The Gaelic punk scene is, in part, an affirmation of the value of minority languages and cultures.McLaughlin, N. and McLoone, M. (2000) \\"Hybridity and National Musics: The Case of Irish Rock Music.\\" Popular Music 19(2), pp. 181‚Äì199. Gaelic punk bands express political views, particularly those related to anarchism and environmentalism. History Punk in the Welsh language, particularly the bands connected with the Anhrefn record label, was an early inspiration to the Gaelic punk scene in Scotland. The Scottish rock band Runrig's first album (Play Gaelic) in 1978 is considered to be the first notable modern Scottish Gaelic-language music album;BBC ‚Äì Alba ‚Äì Airsplaoid other than Ultravox's 1984 album \\"Lament\\", which contained some Gaelic lyrics in the song Man of Two Worlds, and mid-1990s grindcore band Scatha, from Tomintoul who featured Gaelic in several of their songs, there were no further albums of modern music all in Gaelic until spring 2005, when Oi Polloi and Mill a h-Uile Rud both released all-Gaelic EPs. Mill a h-Uile Rud, based in Seattle, United States, formed in Scotland, and have played at least as many concerts in Europe as they have in the United States. All of their material is in Gaelic. They are occasionally active, although they have not released any new material in some time. Oi Polloi, from Edinburgh, Scotland started performing in English in 1981. They released a Gaelic EP, Carson?, in 2005, followed by an all-Gaelic LP, Ar Ce√≤l, Ar C√†nan, Ar-a-mach, in 2006, and the all-Gaelic LP, D√πisg!, in 2012. Their live set features a mix of English and Gaelic material, although they tend to favour the Gaelic material when they play in Scotland. At some concerts in Portree and Stornoway, all of their songs and stage banter were in Gaelic. The backgrounds of the musicians in the subgenre are diverse, from Tim (Mill a h-Uile Rud), who hails from Seattle in the United States, to Anna Rothach (Nad Aislingean and Oi Polloi), who was born and raised in South Uist. The uniting feature of all of these bands is that most of the Gaelic-speaking members have spent some time at Sabhal M√≤r Ostaig, a Gaelic college on the Isle of Skye. In DIY-punk style, the Gaelic punks started out by teaching each other the language at Gaelic for Punks classes; first held at the Edinburgh European City of Punk festival in 1997. After these individuals gained fluency, they took advantage of scholarships available at Sabhal M√≤r Ostaig, and there has been a small, but steady, stream of punks at the college ever since. The Gaelic punk band Mill a h-Uile Rud were featured in the BBC arts documentary series Ealtainn, which followed them on a tour of Europe and filmed them at concerts in the Gaelic-speaking heartland of the Isle of Lewis. The Scotsman, a national Scottish paper based in Edinburgh, regularly covers the Gaelic punk scene, and the American publications Maximum Rocknroll and Punk Planet have carried features on the subgenre. Notable releases * Carson? (2005), Oi Polloi. This vinyl EP was the release that launched the subgenre. * \\"Ce√†rr\\" (2005), Mill a h-Uile Rud.

Two examples of this type of problem are counting combinations and counting permutations. More generally, given an infinite collection of finite sets Si indexed by the natural numbers, enumerative combinatorics seeks to describe a counting function which counts the number of objects in Sn for each n. Although counting the number of elements in a set is a rather broad mathematical problem, many of the problems that arise in applications have a relatively simple combinatorial description. The twelvefold way provides a unified framework for counting permutations, combinations and partitions. The simplest such functions are closed formulas, which can be expressed as a composition of elementary functions such as factorials, powers, and so on. For instance, as shown below, the number of different possible orderings of a deck of n cards is f(n) = n!. The problem of finding a closed formula is known as algebraic enumeration, and frequently involves deriving a recurrence relation or generating function and using this to arrive at the desired closed form. Often, a complicated closed formula yields little insight into the behavior of the counting function as the number of counted objects grows. In these cases, a simple asymptotic approximation may be preferable. A function g(n) is an asymptotic approximation to f(n) if f(n)/g(n)\\\\rightarrow 1 as n\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty. In this case, we write f(n) \\\\sim g(n).\\\\, Generating functions Generating functions are used to describe families of combinatorial objects. Let \\\\mathcal{F} denote the family of objects and let F(x) be its generating function. Then :F(x) = \\\\sum^{\\\\infty}_{n=0}f_nx^n where f_n denotes the number of combinatorial objects of size n. The number of combinatorial objects of size n is therefore given by the coefficient of x^n. Some common operation on families of combinatorial objects and its effect on the generating function will now be developed. The exponential generating function is also sometimes used. In this case it would have the form :F(x) = \\\\sum^{\\\\infty}_{n=0}f_n\\\\frac{x^n}{n!} Once determined, the generating function yields the information given by the previous approaches. In addition, the various natural operations on generating functions such as addition, multiplication, differentiation, etc., have a combinatorial significance; this allows one to extend results from one combinatorial problem in order to solve others. =Union= Given two combinatorial families, \\\\mathcal{F} and \\\\mathcal{G} with generating functions F(x) and G(x) respectively, the disjoint union of the two families (\\\\mathcal{F} \\\\cup \\\\mathcal{G}) has generating function F(x) + G(x). =Pairs= For two combinatorial families as above the Cartesian product (pair) of the two families (\\\\mathcal{F} \\\\times \\\\mathcal{G}) has generating function F(x)G(x). =Sequences= A sequence generalizes the idea of the pair as defined above. Sequences are arbitrary Cartesian products of a combinatorial object with itself. Formally: :\\\\mbox{Seq}(\\\\mathcal{F}) = \\\\epsilon\\\\ \\\\cup\\\\ \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\ \\\\cup\\\\ \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\times \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\ \\\\cup\\\\ \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\times \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\times \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\ \\\\cup \\\\cdots To put the above in words: An empty sequence or a sequence of one element or a sequence of two elements or a sequence of three elements, etc. The generating function would be: :1+F(x) + [F(x)]^2 + [F(x)]^3 + \\\\cdots = \\\\frac{1}{1-F(x)} Combinatorial structures The above operations can now be used to enumerate common combinatorial objects including trees (binary and plane), Dyck paths and cycles. A combinatorial structure is composed of atoms. For example, with trees the atoms would be the nodes. The atoms which compose the object can either be labeled or unlabeled. Unlabeled atoms are indistinguishable from each other, while labelled atoms are distinct. Therefore, for a combinatorial object consisting of labeled atoms a new object can be formed by simply swapping two or more atoms. =Binary and plane trees= Binary and plane trees are examples of an unlabeled combinatorial structure. Trees consist of nodes linked by edges in such a way that there are no cycles. There is generally a node called the root, which has no parent node. In Plane trees each node can have an arbitrary number of children. In binary trees, a special case of plane trees, each node can have either two or no children. Let \\\\mathcal{P} denote the family of all plane trees. Then this family can be recursively defined as follows: :\\\\mathcal{P} = \\\\\\\\{\\\\bullet\\\\\\\\} \\\\times \\\\mbox{Seq}(\\\\mathcal{P}) In this case \\\\\\\\{\\\\bullet\\\\\\\\} represents the family of objects consisting of one node. This has generating function x. Let P(x) denote the generating function \\\\mathcal{P}. Putting the above description in words: A plane tree consists of a node to which is attached an arbitrary number of subtrees, each of which is also a plane tree. Using the operation on families of combinatorial structures developed earlier this translates to a recursive generating function: :P(x) = x\\\\frac{1}{1-P(x)} After solving for P(x): :P(x) = \\\\frac{1-\\\\sqrt{1-4x}}{2} An explicit formula for the number of plane trees of size n can now be determined by extracting the coefficient of xn. : \\\\begin{align} p_n & = [x^n] P(x) = [x^n] \\\\frac{1-\\\\sqrt{1-4x}}{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & = [x^n] \\\\frac{1}{2} - [x^n] \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sqrt{1-4x} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & = -\\\\frac{1}{2} [x^n] \\\\sum^{\\\\infty}_{k=0} {\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\choose k} (-4x)^k \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & = -\\\\frac{1}{2} {\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\choose n} (-4)^n \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & = \\\\frac{1}{n} {2n-2 \\\\choose n-1} \\\\end{align} Note: The notation [xn] f(x) refers to the coefficient of xn in f(x). The series expansion of the square root is based on Newton's generalization of the binomial theorem. To get from the fourth to fifth line manipulations using the generalized binomial coefficient is needed. The expression on the last line is equal to the (n ‚àí 1)th Catalan number. Therefore, pn = cn‚àí1.

History and culture Eyeball jewelry was developed first in the Netherlands as a radical new form of body modification in 2002. It was first designed at the Netherlands Institute for Innovative Ocular Surgery and is marketed there under the name JewelEye. The procedure is completely legal in the Netherlands, as long as it is performed by a licensed ophthalmologist under sterile conditions. In Canada, multiple provinces have passed laws banning eyeball jewelry and scleral tattooing due to potential health risks, including Ontario and Saskatchewan. Procedure Unlike subdermal implants and other new body modification procedures, the extraocular implant is currently only being performed in a medical clinic environment. The procedure is relatively quick, but it does require that both eyes be immobilized with anesthetic drops, and that the layers of the eyeball where the implant is situated must be separated by the injection of liquid. As very few people have undergone this procedure, and it is relatively new, the long term health effects are currently unknown. However, the Website of the Netherlands Institute for Innovative Ocular Surgery states that the implant does not interfere with the ocular functions, i.e. the visual performance and mobility. Additionally, patient satisfaction remains high and no side effects of the treatment have been noticed with a follow-up of more than one year. Jewelry Currently, the only supplier of jewelry for this implant is Hippocratech b.v., a company in Rotterdam, Netherlands. The implant is manufactured from a platinum alloy and is available in several basic shapes, including the Euro sign, heart, musical note, clover or star shapes, with other shapes custom made by the company upon request. The size of the jewellery is about 1/8\\" (3 mm) across.

The Volksempf√§nger (, \\"people's receiver\\") was a range of radio receivers developed by engineer Otto Griessing at the request of Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels. The purpose of the Volksempf√§nger-program was to make radio reception technology affordable to the general public. Joseph Goebbels realized the great propaganda potential of this relatively new medium and thus considered widespread availability of receivers highly important.  History  Deutscher Kleinempf√§nger, DKE 38 (built from 1938 to 1944) The original Volksempf√§nger VE301\\"VE301\\" is an abbreviation where the \\"VE\\" stands for \\"Volksempf√§nger\\" and the \\"301\\" refers to the date of 30 January 1933 ‚Äì the day of the Machtergreifung. model was presented on August 18, 1933, at the 10. Gro√üe Deutsche Funkausstellung in Berlin. The VE301 was available at a readily affordable price of 76 German Reichsmark (equivalent to two weeks' average salary), and a cheaper 35 Reichsmark model (which was even sold on an installment plan), the DKE38 (sometimes called Goebbels-Schnauze ‚Äì \\"Goebbels' snout\\" ‚Äì by the general public) fitted with a multisection tube, was also later produced, along with a series of other models under the Volksempf√§nger, Gemeinschaftsempf√§nger, KdF (Kraft durch Freude), DKE (Deutscher Kleinempf√§nger) and other brands. 1936 Nazi propaganda poster, promoting the use of the Volksempf√§nger. The translated text reads, \\"All of Germany hears the F√ºhrer with the People's Receiver.\\" The Volksempf√§nger was designed to be produced as cheaply as possible, as a consequence they generally lacked shortwave bands and did not follow the practice, common at the time, of marking the approximate dial positions of major European stations on its tuning scale. Only German and (after 1938) Austrian stations were marked and cheaper models only listed arbitrary numbers. Sensitivity was limited to reduce production costs further; so long as the set could receive Deutschlandsender and the local Reichssender, it was considered sensitive enough, although foreign stations could be received after dark with an external antenna, particularly as stations such as the BBC European service increased transmission power during the course of the war. Listening to foreign stations became a criminal offence in Nazi Germany when the war began, while in some occupied territories, such as Poland, all radio listening by non-German citizens was outlawed (later in the war this prohibition was extended to a few other occupied countries coupled with mass seizures of radio sets). Penalties ranged from fines and confiscation of radios to, particularly later in the war, sentencing to a concentration camp or capital punishment. Nevertheless, such clandestine listening was widespread in many Nazi-occupied countries and (particularly later in the war) in Germany itself. The Germans also attempted radio jamming of some enemy stations with limited success.  Technical  VE301 WN interior First introduced in 1933, the Volksempf√§nger Model VE301 used a tuned radio frequency (TRF) circuit, an economical radio receiver design common during the 1920s. The radio set was capable of reception on two bands: Langwelle (long wave) from 150 to 350 kilohertz, and Mittelwelle (medium wave) from 550 to 1700 kilohertz. The glass tuning dial was imprinted with the names of German and Austrian cities corresponding to the frequencies of broadcast stations located in them. The set employed three vacuum tubes: RGN 1064, RES 164, and AF7. Three different VE301 models were produced to suit differing power supply requirements: batteries, alternating current (AC) mains, or direct current (DC) mains. Variations in AC line current were accommodated by moving a wire on the power transformer to select 110 volt, 130 volt, or 220 volt current. Three antenna jacks were provided for antennas of differing lengths, used to optimize reception on the different frequency bands. Volksempf√§nger models produced between 1933 and 1937 used an inexpensive metal reed type speaker. The 1938 models (VE301 Dyn) added an audio output transformer and featured a more modern electrodynamic loudspeaker. Effects Much has been said about the efficiency of the Volksempf√§nger as a propaganda tool. Most famously, Hitler's architect and Minister for Armaments and War Production, Albert Speer, said in his final speech at the Nuremberg trials: Utility receiver The Volksempf√§nger \\"people's radio\\" concept has been compared to the Utility Radio or \\"Civilian Receiver\\" produced by Britain between 1944 and 1945. Unlike the Volksempf√§nger, the Utility Radio was produced primarily to remedy a shortage of consumer radio sets caused by the British radio industry's switch from civilian to military radio production. These Utility Radios followed a standardized and government approved design, and were built by a consortium of manufacturers using standard components. In popular culture *The album Radio-Activity, released in 1975, by German electronic music pioneers Kraftwerk prominently features a Volksempf√§nger, of the DKE brand (model 38), on its cover. *German band Welle: Erdball has also produced a song entitled Volksempf√§nger VE-301, which first appeared on their Die Wunderwelt der Technik album of 2002. *While living in Berlin in the 1970s, the American artist Edward Kienholz produced a series of works entitled 'Volksempf√§nger', using old radios, which at the time could be purchased cheaply at Berlin flea markets, a consequence of the large numbers that had been produced in the pre- war years.

History The daler replaced the rigsdaler in 1849. No subdivisions were issued until 1859, although a variety of coins were countermarked for use on the islands. In 1859, coins denominated in cents were introduced, with 100 cents = 1 daler. In 1904, two new denominations were introduced, the bit and franc. The four units were related as 5 bit = 1 cent, 100 bit = 20 cents = 1 franc, 100 cents = 5 francs = 1 daler. Coins were issued each denominated in two units, bits and cents, francs and cents, or francs and daler. Gold coins were struck and issued in 4 and 10 daler denominations (121,000 and 2,005 minted respectively) only in 1904. Banknotes were issued denominated in francs. The franc was equal to the French franc, with text on the reverse of the banknotes (see ) giving the value in Danish kroner and √∏re, with 1 franc = 72 √∏re. The daler was replaced by the U.S. dollar 17 years after the Danish West Indies became the U.S. Virgin Islands in 1934, with 1 dollar = 1.0363 daler. This was done through identical ordinances passed by the Colonial Councils for the municipality of Saint Thomas & Saint John and the municipality of Saint Croix, with the agreement of the US Treasury after the expiration of the charter of the National Bank of the Danish West Indies. The US dollar became legal tender on 1 July 1934, while the Danish West Indian daler coins remained legal tender until 14 July 1935 (1 year after Governor Paul Martin Pearson had proclaimed that the US government would exchange US currency for the old Danish currency at the legal rate of conversion as required under the ordinances). Coins Just before September 28.th 1850, U.S. half dollars with the years 1848,1849 and 1850 and quarter dollars with the year 1849 were stamped with a crowned FRVII for circulation in the Danish West Indies as shown in the Standard World Coin catalog of Krause & Mishler 1801‚Äì1900. One of the half dollars and the quarter dollar was sent to the Colonial Central Office in Copenhagen in 1850 - these coins are now kept in the Royal Coin Cabinet in the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen. Only these denominations with the above-mentioned years are considered genuine for circulation in Danish West Indies - and they were replaced in 1859 with new coins minted in Denmark for the Danish West Indies. Until 1878 no other denominations was known with such countermarks - but denominations from U.S., Brazilian, British, British West Indies, French, Dutch and Spanish coins were from then on known to have been stamped with vaguely similar countermarks. These coins were mostly fabricated in France to sell to coin collectors and have not been in circulation in the Danish West Indies. These fabricated denominations listed in another Krause & Mishler catalog as well as in the coin catalog Unusual World Coins ( which includes fantasy coins) are and 1 cent, , and 1 dollar from the US, and dollar from the British West Indies' anchor coinage, British farthings, and 6 pence, 1 shilling, and 1 crown, French 5 sous and franc, Mexican 8 reales, Dutch 25 cent and Spanish 4 maraved√≠es, 1, 2 and 4 reales. In 1859, coins were introduced in denominations of 1, 3, 5, 10 and 20 cents. Except for the bronze 1 cent, these coins were silver. In 1904, with the new currency system, gold coins were introduced in denominations of 4 daler (20 francs) and 10 daler (50 francs). These were followed in 1905 by denominations of , 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 40 cents. These coins also bore the denominations , 5, 10 and 50 bit, 1 and 2 francs. The , 1 and 2 cents were struck in bronze, the 5 cents in nickel and the other denominations in silver. Banknotes In 1849, the State Treasury introduced notes in denominations of 2, 3, 5, 10, 50 and 100 dalere. The Bank of St Thomas issued notes denominated in dollars between 1837 and 1889. It is not indicated on the notes which dollar this was. In 1905, the Dansk- Vestindiske Nationalbank (Danish West Indies National Bank) introduced notes in denominations of 5, 10, 20 and 100 francs, which also bore indications of their value in Danish kroner, 3.6, 7.2, 14.4 and 72 kroner.

Early life and education He was born in London on 4 July 1926, the second born son of Arthur William Tedder and Rosalinde Maclardy. His father had a military career in the Royal Air Force, that culminated in his becoming Marshal of the Royal Air Force. As his father's military appointments involved frequent changes, the Tedder family's residences also shifted. He attended schools in Surrey, Whitgift School (1934‚Äì36), Sumatra in Indonesia (1936‚Äì38) and Dauntsey's School in Wiltshire (1938‚Äì44). He suffered with disabilities in both hearing and eyesight, and was rejected as a candidate for military service in the Second World War. Tedder's early life was shaped by two significant tragedies. His older brother Dick was killed on active service in France in 1940. His mother, Rosalinde Tedder, died in January 1943 in an air crash in Egypt. His father was a witness to the air crash and was deeply affected by the death of his wife. As Tedder was unfit to serve in military action, in 1944 he went to university to study chemistry. He studied at Magdalene College, University of Cambridge for his undergraduate degree and, owing to the impact of the family tragedies, initially obtained poor grades. However, he persisted and was awarded a degree (B.A.) in 1947. He received encouragement from some of his lecturers and went on to receive both an M.A in 1951, and then his first doctorate (PhD) at Birmingham University in 1951. He undertook post-doctoral studies at Ohio State University from 1952‚Äì53. He subsequently obtained a second honorary doctorate (D.Sc.) from the University of Birmingham in 1961, and honorary Sc. D. from the University of Cambridge in 1965. Career Tedder became a lecturer in chemistry at Sheffield University in 1955, and in 1964 was appointed to the Roscoe Chair in Chemistry at Queen's College, Dundee, which in 1967 became the University of Dundee. He became Purdie Professor of Chemistry at St. Andrews University in 1969, and held the post until retiral 1989, thereafter retaining the title Emeritus Professor. In 1977 he submitted a paper to the Courts of the Universities of St Andrews and Dundee which called for the reunification of the two Universities, which had separated when Queen's College became the University of Dundee a decade earlier. Although this proposal was rejected it did lead to closer co-operation between the two institutions. Tedder became an authority on a number of topics within the field of chemistry, and was the author or co-author of some 200 technical essays and several textbooks. One of his areas of expertise concerned organofluorine chemistry, and he pioneered the use of gas-liquid chromatography at Sheffield University in the 1950s. He composed a number of technical papers on the reactivity of orthoquinones. He developed a two-stage ion-beam spectrometer. He was also recognised by his peers as an important authority in free radical chemistry. In addition to his distinguished work in chemistry, Tedder succeeded his father as baron and served in the House of Lords. Although he was apparently reluctant to perpetuate the title, he was persuaded by colleagues that the peerage system could benefit by the presence of a scientist and educator. He served on the House of Lords Committee on Hazardous Waste, and contributed to discussions in the House about matters of science and tertiary education. In 1968 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Sir Edmund Hirst, Peter Pauson, Ralph Raphael, D. W. A. Sharp, Neil Campbell, Manfred Gordon, Patrick Dunbar Ritchie and Thomas Stevens Stevens. In 1981, Tedder became a founding member of the World Cultural Council. Tedder maintained a lively interest in the Royal Air Force and attended many honorary functions related to the squadrons in which his father had served. He also followed in his father's steps in his deep reading about Oliver Cromwell, and had planned to write a book on Cromwell. Tedder was also interested in classical music and played the piano. Near the end of his life he developed Parkinson's disease (the same affliction from which his father died). He then developed Alzheimer's disease, which forced him into retirement, and he was eventually placed in permanent nursing care until his death in 1994. Family Tedder was married to Peggy Eileen Growcott, and they were the parents of two sons and a daughter. The elder son, Robin John Tedder (born 1955), is now the 3rd Baron Tedder and Master of Wine; the younger son is Andrew Tedder.

Trump Presidency In 2016 and 2017, the Journal leadership under Baker came under fire from critics, both from the outside and from within the newsroom, who viewed the paper's coverage of President Donald Trump as too timid. Particularly controversial was the Journals November 2016 front-page headline that repeated Trump's unproven claim that \\"millions of people\\" had voted illegally in the election, without noting that this statement was inaccurate. Also controversial was a January 2017 note from Baker to Journal editors, directing them to avoid using the phrase \\"seven majority-Muslim countries\\" when writing about Trump's executive order on travel and immigration; Baker later sent a follow-up note \\"clarifying that there was 'no ban'\\" on the phrase, \\"but that the publication should 'always be careful that this term is not offered as the only description of the countries covered under the ban.'\\" At a town-hall-style meeting with Journal staff in February 2017, Baker defended the paper's coverage, saying that it was objective and protected the paper from being \\"dragged into the political process\\" through a dispute with the Trump administration. Editor at large On 5 June 2018, the Journal announced that Baker would step down as editor in chief and step into the role of editor at large, effective 11 July 2018. Matt Murray succeeded Baker as editor in chief. As editor at large, Baker's regular column remained part of the news division. In June 2020, a column written by Baker in the wake of the George Floyd killing, which alleged that White people were the real victims of racism, and that most racist hate crimes were perpetrated by Black people, was criticized in a letter sent by the union representing Journal reporters, for violating rules that apply to the news division.

He played college football at Michigan State University. Early years DuPree was born and raised in Monroe, Louisiana. He played high school football at Richardson High School in West Monroe, Louisiana. He began playing as a two-way tackle. As a senior, he was switch to tight end on the offense. He contributed to the team reaching the Class 2A State Championship in the 3 years he played, helping the school winn two of them (1966-67 and 1967-68). He also played basketball. College career DuPree played collegiately at Michigan State University. He is recognized as the greatest tight end in Michigan State history, even though he had few opportunities to prove his true worth in the Spartans run-oriented offense. As a sophomore, he was named the starter at tight end. He ranked second on the team with 21 receptions for 402 receiving yards, a 19.1-yard average and 3 receiving touchdowns. As a junior, wide receiver Gordon Bowdell left for the NFL and Dupree took over as the leader of the passing offense. He led the team with 25 catches for 414 yards and 3 receiving touchdowns. As a senior, he was one of the team's co-captains and started all 11 games. Although the Spartnas ran the Wishbone T offense and he was required to focus mainly on blocking, in a team that only completed a total of 44 passes, his 23 catches for 406 yards were enough to get him noticed for All-American honors. He didn't record any touchdowns during the season. DuPree was the last tight end to lead Michigan State University in receiving, doing it in each of his last 2 seasons. He finished his collegiate career with 69 receptions (third in school history, 1,222 receiving yards, a 17.7-yard average and 6 receiving touchdowns. He also played basketball for a season, before deciding to focus on football. Professional career DuPree was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the first round (20th overall) of the 1973 NFL Draft. As a rookie, he became an immediate starter, which at the time was almost unheard-of in a Tom Landry coached team. He also had to take over for the recently retired and future hall of famer Mike Ditka, who gave him his jersey number 89. He led the team in receiving yards (392) and was second in catches (29) and receiving touchdowns (5). He set a franchise record with 3 toucdowns passsed in a single-game against the St. Louis Cardinals. In 1974, he posted 29 receptions (third on the team), 466 yards (third on the team) and 4 receiving touchdowns (second on the team). He improved in the second half of the season, when he made 20 cacthes for 360 yards and 4 touchdowns in the las 7 contests. In 1975, he was limited with injuries (including a broken finger), and although he played in all 14 games, he only had 6 starts. He was passed on the depth chart by Jean Fugett and Dupree tallied only 9 receptions for 138 yards and one touchdown. In 1976, Fugett left in free agency and Dupree regained his starting position. He had 42 catches which was a franchise record for tight ends and good for second on the team. He also compiled 680 receiving yards (second on the team) and 2 receiving touchdowns (tied for third on the team). He was named to the first of three consecutive Pro Bowls. In 1977, the Cowboys increased his blocking responsibilities and his stats suffered. He made 28 receptions (fourth on the team) for 347 yards (third on the team) and 3 receiving touchdowns (tied for second on the team). He still was voted the starter at tight end for the NFC squad in the Pro Bowl. He assisted his team to a 27‚Äì10 victory over the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XII, as the top receiver of the game (four catches for 66 yards). He also played in Super Bowl X and scored a touchdown in Super Bowl XIII; in both games the Cowboys lost against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Even though tight ends during his era were expected to block more than feature their receiving skills, his 41 career touchdown receptions was the Cowboys team record until it was broken in 2012 by Jason Witten. In the 1982 season, he helped block on Tony Dorsett's record 99-yard touchdown run against the Minnesota Vikings. He announced his retirement on March 16, 1984. Known as a superb blocker and pass receiver, DuPree was one of the top tight ends of his era. He caught 267 passes for 3,565 yards and 42 touchdowns, while also rushing for 178 yards and a touchdown on 28 carries. The durable DuPree never missed a game in his 11 seasons in the league and was part of the franchise's legacy of Pro Bowl tight ends that includes: Jim Doran, Dick Bielski, Lee Folkins, Mike Ditka, Doug Cosbie, Jay Novacek, and Jason Witten. He was also a Cowboys co-captain and recognized as the team‚Äôs NFL Man of the Year. Personal life More recently, he has become involved in many charities, including the Shriner's, as well as other inner city youth groups.

Paul Dirac thought of the idea for isotope separation and tried creating such a device in 1934 in the lab of Peter Kapitza at Cambridge. Other methods of separation were more practical at that time, but this method was designed and used in South Africa for producing reactor fuel with a uranium-235 content of around 3‚Äì5%, and 80‚Äì93% enriched uranium for use in nuclear weapons. The Uranium Enrichment Corporation of South Africa, Ltd. (UCOR) developed the process, operating a facility at Pelindaba (known as the 'Y' plant) to produce hundreds of kilograms of HEU. Aerodynamic enrichment processes require large amounts of electricity and are not generally considered economically competitive because of high energy consumption and substantial requirements for removal of waste heat. The South African enrichment plant has apparently been closed. Process In the vortex separation process a mixture of uranium hexafluoride gas and hydrogen is injected tangentially into a tube at one end through nozzles or holes, at velocities close to the speed of sound. The tube tapers to a small exit aperture at one or both ends. This tangential injection of gas results in a spiral or vortex motion within the tube, and two gas streams are withdrawn at opposite ends of the vortex tube; centrifugal force providing the isotopic separation. The spiral swirling flow decays downstream of the feed inlet due to friction at the tube wall. Consequently, the inside diameter of the tube is typically tapered to reduce decay in the swirling flow velocity. This process is characterized by a separating element with a very small stage cut (the ratio of product flow to feed flow) of about 1/20, and high process- operating pressures. Due to the extremely difficult plumbing required to link stages together, the design was developed into a cascade design technique (dubbed Helikon), in which 20 separation stages are combined into one module, and all 20 stages share a common pair of axial-flow compressors. A basic requirement for the success of this method is that the axial-flow compressors successfully transmit parallel streams of different isotopic compositions without significant mixing. A typical Helikon module consists of a large cylindrical steel vessel housing the 20 separator assemblies, along with two compressors (one mounted on each end), and two water-cooled heat exchangers. Advantages of this process are a lack of criticality concerns due to the highly diluted feedstock and suitability for batch processing. This means Helikon-type plants can be relatively small, making the technology a nuclear proliferation concern.

It is also known as alternative computing. The term of \\"unconventional computation\\" was coined by Cristian S. Calude and John Casti and used at the \\"First International Conference on Unconventional Models of Computation\\", held in Auckland, New Zealand in 1998. Background The general theory of computation allows for a variety of models. Historically, however, computing technology first developed using mechanical methods, and eventually evolved into using electronic techniques, which remain the state- of-the-art. Further development may require development of new technologies. =Computational model= =Mechanical computing= Historically, mechanical computers were used in industry before the advent of the transistor. Mechanical computers retain some interest today both in research and as analogue computers. Some mechanical computers have a theoretical or didactic relevance, such as billiard-ball computers or hydraulic ones.Penrose, Roger: The Emperor's New Mind. Oxford University Press, 1990. See also corresponding article on it. While some are actually simulated, others are not. No attempt is made to build a functioning computer through the mechanical collisions of billiard balls. The domino computer is another theoretically interesting mechanical computing scheme. =Electronic digital computers= Most modern computers are electronic computers with the Von Neumann architecture based on digital electronics, with extensive integration made possible following the invention of the transistor and the scaling of Moore's law. Unconventional computing is, according to a conference description, \\"an interdisciplinary research area with the main goal to enrich or go beyond the standard models, such as the Von Neumann computer architecture and the Turing machine, which have dominated computer science for more than half a century\\". These methods model their computational operations based on non-standard paradigms, and are currently mostly in the research and development stage. This computing behavior can be \\"simulated\\" using the classical silicon-based micro- transistors or solid state computing technologies, but aim to achieve a new kind of computing. Generic approaches These are unintuitive and pedagogical examples that a computer can be made out of almost anything. =Physical objects= = Reservoir Computing = Reservoir computing is a computational framework in the context of machine learning. The main advantage of this unconventional computation is simple and fast leaning algorithm. Hardware implementation is also possible known as 'physical reservoir computer'. Tangible computing =Human computing= Physics approaches =Optical computing= Optical computing uses light to compute. =Spintronics= =Atomtronics= =Fluidics= =Quantum computing= Chemistry approaches =Molecular computing= Biochemistry approaches =Peptide computing= =DNA computing= =Membrane computing= Biological approaches =Neuroscience= Some biological approaches are heavily inspired by the behavior of neurons. =Cellular automata and amorphous computing= Mathematical approaches =Analog computing= =Ternary computing= Ternary computing is a type of computing that uses ternary logic (instead of binary logic). =Reversible computing= =Chaos computing= =Stochastic computing=  See also  * Network computing (disambiguation) * WDR paper computer  References  Category:Classes of computers ","title":"Unconventional computing"},{"id":"3925801","text":"Kaiser effect may refer to: *Kaiser effect (cosmology) *Kaiser effect (material science) ","title":"Kaiser effect"},{"id":"3925819","text":"AnnovonSangerhausen Anno von Sangerhausen (died 8 July 1273) served as the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order from 1256 to 1273.

It is the oldest high school in the Richardson Independent School District (RISD). Background Richardson High School is the flagship high school of the Richardson Independent School District (RISD). The school has many magnet programs such as, culinary arts, theater, visual arts, tech theater, communications, robotics, law, science, and computer science. The school also has award- winning mock trial, debate, and computer science teams. In 2015, 2016, and 2017, Richardson High School was one of the few hundred schools in the state of Texas, and the only high school in RISD to earn all 7 distinctions in the STAAR state assessment. In the 2012 U.S. News & World Report rankings of the Best Schools in America, Richardson High School ranked number 711 out of 21,766 public high schools, putting it in the top 3.5% of all public high schools in the United States. RHS was also rated the 65th best in the state of Texas. In August 2006, Richardson High School was named one of three \\"best practices\\" high schools in the state of Texas. (payment required) The award granted by the National Council of Educational Accountability and the Just 4 Kids Foundation is based upon staff development, staff retention, standardized test scores and support programs for students. In May 2007, the RISD was awarded the \\"Excellence in Education Award for Large School District in Texas\\" by the HEB Foundation. Richardson High School and Richardson West Junior High played instrumental roles in the selection process and hosted the site visit committee in March 2007. In addition to the award, the RISD received a check for $100,000. The school, which opened shortly after the first public school in the city was burned down by Ross Inman in 1890, began in a two-room building on Old Pike Road, a street that is now part of Greenville Avenue. A rural school with fewer than 100 students up to 1950, the school opened its present facility in 1961. During the period of the late 1950s, RHS shared facilities with Westwood Junior High School on Abrams Road. Bill Passmore was principal during this transition into the new facility on Belt Line Road. Richardson's sports mascot is the Eagles and the team shares Eagle-Mustang Stadium (capacity 12,000) with J. J. Pearce High School. The school's student news magazine is the Talon. As of the 2018-2019 school year, the administration at RHS is led by Chris Choat, Principal; Michelle King, Associate Principal; Bill Parker, Magnet Principal; Von Ensley, Assistant Principal; Ramiro Lucio, Assistant Principal; Elise Curry, Assistant Principal; Jose Vega, Assistant Principal; and Tara McLennan, Assistant Principal.

However, the British force retreated afterwards, throwing away their advantage. Prelude General Kock, his staff, and officers of the German Corps on the eve of the Battle When the Boers invaded Natal, a force under General Johannes Kock occupied the railway station at Elandslaagte on 19 October 1899, thus cutting the communications between the main British force at Ladysmith and a detachment at Dundee. De Kock's forces consisted mainly of men of the Johannesburg Commando with detachments of German, French, Dutch, American, and Irish Boer foreign volunteers. Learning that the telegraph had been cut, Lieutenant General Sir George White sent his cavalry commander, Major General John French to recapture the station. Arriving shortly after dawn on 21 October, French found the Boers present in strength, with two field guns. He telegraphed to Ladysmith for reinforcements, which shortly afterwards arrived by train. The battle Charge of the 5th Lancers at Elandslaagte, from a drawing by Richard Caton Woodville Memorial plaque commemorating the Natal Field Artillery's participation in the battle While three batteries of British field guns bombarded the Boer position, and the 1st Battalion, the Devonshire Regiment advanced frontally in open order, the main attack commanded by Colonel Ian Hamilton (1st Battalion, the Manchester Regiment, 2nd Battalion, the Gordon Highlanders and the dismounted Imperial Light Horse) moved around the Boers' left flank. The sky had steadily been growing dark with thunderclouds, and as the British made their assault, the storm burst. In the poor visibility and pouring rain, the British infantry had to face a barbed wire farm fence, in which several men were entangled and shot. Nevertheless, they cut the wire or broke it down, and occupied the main part of the Boer position. Some small parties of Boers were already showing white flags when General Kock led a counterattack, dressed in his top hat and Sunday best. He drove back the British infantry in confusion, but they rallied, inspired by Hamilton (and reportedly, a bugler of the Manchesters and a Pipe Major of the Gordons) and charged again. Kock and his companions were killed. As the remaining Boers mounted their ponies and tried to retreat, two squadrons of British cavalry (from the 5th Lancers and the 5th Dragoon Guards) got among them with lances and sabres, cutting down many. This was one of the few occasions during the Boer war in which a British cavalry charge made contact. Some of the retreating Boers were also killed by the lancers after already clearly surrendering. The two Boer field guns fell into British hands. They were found to have originally been British and had been captured by the Boers in the aftermath of the Jameson Raid. Aftermath Battlefield at Elandslaagte The way was now clear for the British detachment at Dundee to fall back on the main British force, but Sir George White feared that 10,000 Boers from the Orange Free State were about to attack Ladysmith, and ordered the force at Elandslaagte to fall back there. The British were tired and many officers had been killed, and the retreat became a disorderly scramble. The detachment at Dundee was once again isolated, and was forced to make an exhausting detour before they could reach safety. The Boer forces re-occupied Elandslaagte two days later. General Johannes Kock was captured by the British and died from his wounds shortly after the battle. Also captured in the battle was Adolf Schiel, a German officer who had lived in South Africa since 1878. Schiel, who held the commission of Lieutenant Colonel, led a German commando in the battle. Schiel returned to Germany after the war, but died from wounds he had received at Elandslaagte in 1903. Among the British dead was Colonel John James Scott-Chisholme, commander in the Imperial Light Horse. He was killed while leading from the front and encouraging his men by waving a coloured sash. The Battle was also notable for being the first and last battle of the volunteer Hollanderkorps. The Hollanderkorps was a group of ca. 150 Dutch volunteers which had been established a mere month earlier. During the battle the Hollanderkorps suffered 9 fatalities, including Herman Coster, along with fellow officer Cars Geerts de Jonge and seven soldiers: P.J. van den Broek, H. van Cittert, J.A. Lepeltak Kieft, Jan Moora, J.Th. Rummeling, M. Schaink, and F.W. Wagner. A further 35 of the Hollanders were taken prisoner by the British. Among the prisoners was Willem Frederik Mondriaan (brother of the Dutch artist Piet Mondrian) who was wounded in the battle. Although he was able to crawl away from the battlefield he was taken prisoner by the British shortly after. He was later sent to Saint Helena as a prisoner of war, returning to South Africa in 1903. Cornelis Vincent 'Cor' van Gogh, the brother of the Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh, also fought in the battle where he was wounded and taken prisoner. He died shortly after. The Boer generals were deeply unhappy with the Hollanderkorps' performance, and it was disbanded after the battle though several hundred Dutch volunteers continued to fight in Boer regiments. The names of the deceased Hollanders, including Coster, were inscribed at a monument at the location of the battle. The monument was destroyed by vandals in 2014.

Established in 1992, many different organizations work to maintain the garden to keep it free of charge. What began as a 7-acre gift to the city in the early 1980s has now become a 53-acre public park with multiple gardens. This includes the Fuchsia Garden, Lost Meadow Trail, Native Discovery Garden, Perennial Border, Rhododendron Glen, The Urban Meadow, Waterwise Garden, Yao Garden, and Dahlia Display.  History  Entrance to the Bellevue Botanical Garden In 1981, the Shorts family's decision to donate 7.5 acres of their home to the City of Bellevue began the idea for a public space in the city. It wasn't until three years later when the Jewetts family proposed the idea of a botanical garden to Director of Parks and Community Service of Bellevue Springgate that the project began. From the years 1984-1989 during the planning of the garden, the City of Bellevue sets aside an additional 29-acres of land for this project making the total size of the garden 36-acres. Officially open June 27, 1992, the garden included the Perennial Border, the Yao Garden and the Fuchsia Garden. However, from 1993 to 2007 additional gardens have been built including the Dahlia Display, the Waterwise Garden, the Wildflower Garden, the Alpine Rock Garden, the Native Discover Garden, and the Rhododendron Glen. Development of the garden throughout the years created the purchase of an additional 17 acres in 2006 and a revision of the master plan in 2008. Through partnerships with many organizations to maintenance over the years, the Bellevue Botanical Garden has kept admissions free and celebrated their 25-year anniversary June 2017.  Featured Gardens  = Native Discovery Garden = The Native Discovery Garden highlights native plants of the Pacific Northwest. Because these plants have adapted to the environment, they require low maintenance. According to the Washington Native Plant Society, the purpose of the project was to increase the number of diverse plants. Although 90 percent of the plants are Washington specific, there were 1000 new plants of 120 different species after the renovation in July 2019. = Perennial Border = Created and maintained by the Northwest Perennial Alliance and volunteers, the Perennial Border is the largest public perennial garden in America. Designed by Charles Price, Glenn Withey, Bob Lilly, and Carrie Becker, the garden is in bloom year-round with plants that grow best in the Pacific Northwest. The American style garden features perennials, bulbs, grasses, trees, and shrubs along the stairs and paths of the garden. = Yao Garden = The Yao Garden is a Japanese themed garden that hosts plants from the Pacific Northwest, Japan, and around the Pacific Rim. Although formerly a detention for water, the space now consists of a small river stream surrounded by maples, azaleas, rhododendrons, and viburnums. Yao Garden Originally part of Kelsey Creek Park in 1971, the Yao Garden relocated as the botanical garden project began in 1990. Part of the Bellevue Sister Cities Association (BSCA) along with four other cities including Yao Japan; the organization works to cultivate relationships on an international level. Since 1977 BSCA has sponsored an exchange program between students from Bellevue and students from Japan. = Urban Meadows = Opened in March 2017, the Urban Meadow features various grasses, perennials, a wetland, and a mason bee box. Both native and exotic plant species are included in this cultivated meadow for a natural look and year-round highlights. Being a garden that was added to the Bellevue Botanical Garden collection, later on, designer Jil Stenn found a way to blend the new Urban Meadow with the surrounding gardens including the Waterwise Garden, Iris Rain Garden, and Rock Garden. Although the project had a rough start due to rainfall, it was completed before the Bellevue Botanical Garden's 25th- anniversary celebration. Contributors take pride in the colors displayed throughout the year, the animal sightings, no chemical uses in the garden, and the dedication of benches and trees to honor loved ones.  Bellevue Botanical Garden Society  Started by the same individuals that initiated the Bellevue Botanical Garden project‚ÄîBob and Iris Jewett‚Äîthe garden is run on an all- volunteer basis and collaborates with various organizations to maintain each garden. The society aims to inspire their guests in the community share about ecology and horticulture through education programs in Bellevue. Various classes and events are organized regularly including the holiday lights festival as a tangible way to teach and inspire community members.

Per student spending has continued to increase. The New York City Department of Education is the largest public school system in the United States. Among New York City public high schools are selective specialized schools. * The Bard High School Early College is one of the few, tuition-free, early college entrance programs in the nation that provides graduates with a high school diploma and an Associate of Arts degree. * Brooklyn Latin School is one of the nine Specialized High Schools in New York City. Entrance to the school requires passing the admissions test.

A small portion of land that is between Pelham and Pelham Bay Park, with a total of 35 houses, is a part of the Bronx, but is cut off from the rest of the borough due to the way the county boundaries were established; the New York City government pays for the residents' children to go to Pelham Union Free School District schools, including Pelham Memorial High School, since that is more cost effective than sending school buses to take the students to New York City schools. This arrangement has been in place since 1948. As of 1997 one student at Pelham Memorial and five students in elementary and middle school lived in this section, and New York City paid Pelham School District $15,892.86 per year for the high school student and $8,650.08 per year for the other students. () School funding lawsuit A constitutional challenge to the New York State school funding system was filed in 1993 by the Campaign for Fiscal Equity. The lawsuit, Campaign for Fiscal Equity, Inc. (CFE) v. State of New York (also known as CFE v. State of New York), claims that the state's school finance system under-funds New York City public schools and denies its students their constitutional right to a sound basic education. The Court of Appeals, New York's highest court, ruled in 1996 that the New York State constitution requires that the state offer all children the opportunity for a \\"sound basic education\\". In 2001, State Supreme Court Justice Leland DeGrasse found that the current state school funding system was unconstitutional. Governor George Pataki appealed the decision, which was overturned in 2002 by the Appellate Division. CFE appealed to the New York Court of Appeals, which again found in favor of CFE in 2003. The Court of Appeals gave the State of New York until July 30, 2004 to comply with its order. The state failed to meet this deadline, however, and the court appointed three referees who were given until November 30, 2004 to submit a compliance plan to Justice Leland DeGrasse of the State Supreme Court. Justice DeGrasse agreed with the referees' recommendations and in 2005 ruled that New York City schools need nearly $15 billion to provide students with their constitutional right to the opportunity to receive a sound basic education. Governor Pataki appealed again to the Appellate Division. In 2006, however, the Appellate Division ordered the State Legislature to consider a plan to direct between $4.7 billion and $5.63 billion to New York City schools and upheld an earlier ruling to provide about $9.2 billion in capital funds to the school system over five years. New York City's public secondary schools include: Bard High School Early College, Bronx High School of Science, Brooklyn Technical High School, Hunter College High School, LaGuardia High School, Staten Island Technical High School, Stuyvesant High School, and Townsend Harris High School.

The New York Public Library comprises simultaneously a set of scholarly research collections and a network of community libraries and is the busiest public library system in the world. Over 15.5 million patrons checked out books, periodicals, and other materials from the library's 82 branches in the 2004‚Äì2005 fiscal year. The library has four major research centers. The largest is the Library for the Humanities, which ranks in importance with the Library of Congress, the British Library, and the Biblioth√®que nationale de France. It has 39 million items in its collection. The Brooklyn Public Library is the fourth-largest library system in the country, serving more than two million people each year. The Central Library is its main reference center, with an additional 58 branches. Foreign language collections in 70 different languages, from Arabic to Creole to Vietnamese, are tailored to the neighborhoods they serve. The Queens Library is the top library system in the United States by circulation, having loaned 20.2 million items in the 2006 fiscal year. The Queens Library serves the city's most diverse borough with a full range of services and programs for adults and children at the central reference library on Merrick Boulevard in Jamaica, Queens and at its 62 branches. Collections include books, periodicals, compact discs and videos. All branches have a computerized catalogue of the library's holdings, as well as access to the Internet. Lectures, performances and special events are presented by neighborhood branches. There are several other important libraries in the city. Among them is the Morgan Library, originally the private library of J. P. Morgan and made a public institution by his son, John Pierpont Morgan. It is now a research library with an important collection, including material from ancient Egypt, √âmile Zola, William Blake's original drawings for his edition of the Book of Job; a Percy Bysshe Shelley notebook; originals of poems by Robert Burns; a Charles Dickens manuscript of A Christmas Carol; 30 shelves of Bibles; a journal by Henry David Thoreau; Mozart's Haffner Symphony in D Major; and manuscripts for George Sand, William Makepeace Thackeray, Lord Byron, Charlotte Bront√´ and nine of Sir Walter Scott's novels, including Ivanhoe. The library is currently undergoing a significant expansion designed by Renzo Piano. Museums L'Arl√©sienne (Portr√§t der Mme Ginoux), by Vincent van Gogh, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art New York City is home to hundreds of cultural institutions and historic sites, many of which are internationally known. The Metropolitan Museum of Art is one of the world's largest art museums, located on the eastern edge of Central Park. It also comprises a building complex known as The Cloisters in Fort Tryon Park at the north end of Manhattan overlooking the Hudson River which features medieval art. The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) is often considered a rival to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Brooklyn Museum is the second largest art museum in New York and one of the largest in the United States. The American Museum of Natural History, on Manhattan's Upper West Side, is one of the largest natural history museums in the world. There are many smaller important galleries and art museums in the city. Among these is the Frick Collection, one of the preeminent small art museums in the United States, with a collection of old master paintings housed in 16 galleries within the former mansion of steel magnate Henry Clay Frick. The Jewish Museum of New York, created in 1904, has a collection 28,000 objects including paintings, sculpture, archaeological artifacts, and many other pieces important to the preservation of Jewish history and culture. El Museo del Barrio, founded in 1969 on Museum Mile in East Harlem, was a creation of the Nuyorican Movement and Civil Rights Movement. In Chelsea, Manhattan, the Rubin Museum of Art is a museum dedicated to the collection, display, and preservation of the art of the Himalayas and surrounding regions, especially that of Tibet. A dinosaur replica at the American Museum of Natural History There are several botanical gardens in New York City. The New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx, with over one million living plants, was modeled after the Royal Botanic Gardens in London. The Brooklyn Botanic Garden, Queens Botanical Garden, and Staten Island Botanical Garden also exist within the city. The city contains several children's museums as well. The Brooklyn Children's Museum is a general purpose museum in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Founded in 1899, it was the first museum in the world to cater specifically to children. The museum is currently undergoing extensive renovation and expansion. The New York Hall of Science is a hands-on science and technology center with more than 400 exhibits exploring biology, chemistry, and physics. It is located in one of the few remaining structures of the 1964 New York World's Fair. Scientific research New York is a center of scientific research, particularly in medicine and the life sciences. The city has 15 nationally leading academic medical research institutions and medical centers. These include Rockefeller University, Beth Israel Medical Center, Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, Weill Cornell Medical College, Mount Sinai Medical Center (where Jonas Salk, developer of the vaccine for polio as an intern) and Mount Sinai School of Medicine, Memorial Sloan- Kettering Cancer Center, and the medical schools of New York University. In the Bronx, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine is a major academic center. Brooklyn also hosts one of the country's leading urban medical centers, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, an academic medical research institution and the oldest hospital-based medical school in the United States. Professor Raymond Vahan Damadian, a pioneer in magnetic resonance imaging research, was part of the faculty from 1967 to 1977 and built the first MRI machine, the Indomitable, there. The New York Structural Biology Center, in upper Manhattan, is a highly regarded federally funded medical research center with the largest and most advanced cluster of high-field research magnets in the United States. More than 50 bioscience companies and two biotech incubators are located in the city, with as many as 30 companies spun out of local research institutions each year. The Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) is a component laboratory of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center Earth- Sun Exploration Division and a unit of The Earth Institute at Columbia University. Current research at GISS emphasizes a broad study of global climate change. It also conducts basic research in space sciences in support of Goddard programs. Rockefeller University, located on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, is a world-renowned center for research and graduate education in the biomedical sciences, chemistry, and physics. Founded by John D. Rockefeller in 1901, the university has been the site of many important scientific breakthroughs. Rockefeller scientists established that DNA is the chemical basis of heredity, discovered blood groups, showed that viruses can cause cancer, founded the modern field of cell biology, worked out the structure of antibodies, developed methadone maintenance for people addicted to heroin, devised the AIDS \\"cocktail\\" drug therapy, and identified the weight-regulating hormone leptin. Twenty-three Nobel Prize winners have been associated with the university, an amazing figure considering that Rockefeller University houses a relatively small amount of labs. The Pfizer Plant Research Laboratory in The Bronx, built with funding from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, New York State and New York City, and named for its largest private donor, is a major new research institution at the New York Botanical Garden opened in 2006. The laboratory is a pure research institution, with projects more diverse than research in universities and pharmaceutical companies. The laboratory's research emphasis is on plant genomics, the study of how genes function in plant development. One question scientists hope to answer is Darwin's \\"abominable mystery\\"; when, where, and why flowering plants emerged. The laboratory's research also furthers the discipline of molecular systematics, the study of DNA as evidence that can reveal the evolutionary history and relationships of plant species. Staff scientists also study plant use in immigrant communities in New York City and the genetic mechanisms by which neurotoxins are produced in some plants, work that may be related to nerve disease in humans. A staff of 200 trains 42 doctoral students at a time from all over the world; since the 1890s scientists from the New York Botanical Garden have mounted about 2,000 exploratory missions across the planet to collect plants in the wild. At the plant chemistry laboratory chemical compounds from plants are extracted to create a library of the chemistry of the world's plants and stored in a DNA storage room with 20 freezers that store millions of specimens, including rare, endangered or extinct species. To protect them during winter power outages, there is a backup 300-kilowatt electric generator.

Prior to 1945 it was in Germany. It lies approximately north- east of Mierosz√≥w, south of Wa≈Çbrzych, and south-west of the regional capital Wroc≈Çaw.  Geography  Located about north-east of Mierosz√≥w, south of Wa≈Çbrzych, and south-west of the regional capital Wroc≈Çaw, Soko≈Çowsko is the largest village within the Stone Mountains of the Central Sudetes. It is situated in a deep forest-covered hollow traversed by the Soko≈Çowiec and Dziczy streams, at an altitude of above sea level. The border with the town of Mezimƒõst√≠ in the Czech Republic is about in the south. Soko≈Çowsko is surrounded by several forested mountains, predominantly made up from porphyry rocks: Sto≈ºek Ma≈Çy () in the north-west and Masyw Bukowca () in the north- east, as well as Garbatka () in the south-west, W≈Çostowa () in the south and south-east and Radosno ( in the east. The range offers numerous trails for hiking and cross-country skiing in winter.  History  It is difficult to indicate the exact foundation date of the village. The area had originally been part of the County of K≈Çodzko, acquired by Bohemia under Duke Sobƒõslav I in 1137. His successors of the P≈ôemyslid dynasty became hereditary Bohemian kings by order of Emperor Frederick II in 1212 and promoted the German Ostsiedlung. Soko≈Çowsko was probably founded about 1250 by monks of the Benedictine Order at Police, a filial monastery of B≈ôevnov Abbey in Prague. The first record of Girbrechtsdorff is documented in a 1357 deed itemising the villages within the burgraviate of Radosno castle (German: Freudenburg), that fell to the Piast Duke Bolko II the Small of ≈öwidnica shortly afterwards, whose duchy in turn was finally incorporated as a Silesian fief of the Bohemian crown in 1392. During the 15th century G√∂rbersdorf had several possessors and suffered from the Hussite Wars. Together with the southern part of the former Duchy of ≈öwidnica the village passed to the Imperial counts of Hoberg (Hochberg) at KsiƒÖ≈º, the later Princes of Pless. With the Bohemian kingdom the area fell to the Habsburg Monarchy in 1526 and was seized by Prussia under King Frederick II in the First Silesian War of 1742. From 1815 G√∂rbersdorf was part of the Prussian Province of Silesia. Brehmer's sanatorium, late 1870s G√∂rbersdorf didn't differentiate from neighbouring villages until it was visited in 1849 by Countess Maria von Colomb, a niece of Prussian General Gebhard Leberecht von Bl√ºcher. The countess, delighted by the scenery, persuaded her brother-in-law Hermann Brehmer to establish a health resort for consumptive patients. In 1854 she and Brehmer opened the world's first sanatorium for the treatment of tuberculosis at G√∂rbersdorf. The care included the Priessnitz method of hydrotherapy and also a precursory method of climatic-dietetic treatment was applied. The treatment of consumption practised by Alexander Spengler at Davos, perpetuated by Thomas Mann's novel The Magic Mountain, was modelled after G√∂rbersdorf, which at times was called the \\"Silesian Davos,\\" although perhaps Davos should be called the \\"Swiss G√∂rbersdorf.\\" The resort was relatively expensive, but well organised, and before 1888 it had both a post office and phone lines. At the same time the quantity of 730 curates well exceeded the number of inhabitants. Several further sanatoriums were established in the following years and until World War I, G√∂rbersdorf had become popular with guests from all over Europe, who had numerous mansions and even a Russian Orthodox chapel erected. At the beginning of the 20th century Scandinavian guests introduced snow skiing and a ski jumping hill was opened in 1930. = Post World War II = In 1945 G√∂rbersdorf, now belonging to Poland, was named Soko≈Çowsko in honour of the Polish internist Alfred Soko≈Çowski who had been a close co-worker of Hermann Brehmer. The now-called Grunwald sanatorium has continued to operate as a public anti-consumptive resort, while large parts of the facilities decayed. On the initiative of medical director Stanis≈Çaw Domin the treatment profile was broadened to all kind of lung diseases, later also dementia. The filmmaker Krzysztof Kie≈õlowski, whose father suffered from tuberculosis, spent several years of his youth at Soko≈Çowsko. Russian Orthodox Chapel In the 1970s the settlement was being transformed into Provincial Centre of Winter Sports, but due to lack of resources the project was not completed. Soko≈Çowsko didn't regain its village status until the beginning of the 21st century. In the recent years, some of the mansions were renovated. The Russian Orthodox Archangel Michael chapel has been rebuilt by the Catholic Renovabis organisation.

Publication history The first Dinosaur Island appeared in only one issue, Batman #35, from June 1946. The story by Bill Finger and Bob Kane, involved a \\"Dinosaur Island\\" amusement park that contained realistic-looking and functioning robotic dinosaurs. The second and definitive version of Dinosaur Island first appeared in the Spring 1960 issue of Star-Spangled War Stories #90. Created by Robert Kanigher and featuring early art from Ross Andru, this began an ongoing feature known as The War That Time Forgot. Located in the South Pacific of DC's main shared universe, it is an island populated by living dinosaurs and other various prehistoric creatures. Most of these dinosaurs were much larger than their real life counterparts, as a Pteranodon was big enough to be able to tear apart a jet, while a Brontosaurus would be big enough to overturn an aircraft carrier. The stories were set in the 1940s during World War II, and periodically American and Japanese soldiers would stumble upon the island during battle encountering the creatures there. After its debut in Star Spangled War Stories #90, the feature would return in #92 and was an ongoing series until #137 in 1968. Afterwards the feature would appear sporadically in the pages of G.I. Combat, Weird War Tales, and other DC comic books. Fictional history =First Dinosaur Island= The first Dinosaur Island is a newly constructed amusement park run by Murray Wilson Hunt. At this park, Batman and Robin agree to be part of a mock big-game hunt held by Mr. Breach. During the hunt, Murray is knocked out by a criminal named Stephen Chase who takes control of Dinosaur Island, having the mechanical dinosaurs and cavemen attack Batman. Eventually, Batman and Robin are able to turn the tide on Mr. Breach and capture Stephen Chase. Afterward, Batman gains a mechanical Tyrannosaurus as a trophy and places it in the Batcave.Batman #35 =Second Dinosaur Island= The second locale named Dinosaur Island is an uncharted Pacific island which seems to have first been discovered by Enemy Ace in 1927 when he flew Bat Lash, Biff Bradley, General Joseph Stilwell, and \\"Chop-Chop\\" (presumably the father of the Blackhawks member) to the island on a mission for Chiang Kai-shek. The island had long been a legend to the Chinese people (known as Dragon Island at the time) and was believed to hold the mystical Swords of Fan. During this mission, the adventurers encounter Vandal Savage and Miss Fear, in addition to the dangerous dinosaurs. This tale appeared in the Guns of the Dragon mini-series.Guns of the Dragon #1‚Äì4 (October 1998‚ÄìJanuary 1999) During World War II, several United States submarines seemingly disappear after encountering an area of seismic disturbances. Marines land on a nearby island hoping to find survivors, but instead, find that the earthquakes has awakened the remote island's resident dinosaur population. The prehistoric beasts had been preserved via suspended animation for centuries. With their weapons essentially useless, the squad of Marines barely escapes to tell the tale. Despite the presence of dinosaurs, the U.S. government consider the island a valuable strategic location in its war against Japan. Several expeditions and operations take place at the island. The island is also used as a proving ground for the automated soldiers designated G.I. Robot, which prove to be no match for the dinosaurs' ferocious might. The Creature Commandos, the Flying Boots, and the original Suicide Squad all take part in missions on the island during World War II. Post-War expeditions have theorized that the island exists in a state of temporal flux. Black Canary of the Birds of Prey lands on the island in modern times only to find it still inhabited by Japanese soldiers who are keeping Gunner and Sarge of \\"The Losers\\" in a P.O.W. camp. The Suicide Squad series reveals that a post-War mission to the island by Sgt. Rock (allegedly) and Bulldozer explains why they haven't aged as much since World War II due to temporal fluctuations. The veracity of this story may be in dispute, as Bulldozer later cryptically announces that Sgt. Rock died in World War II. In 2008, the Island was featured in the twelve-part series The War That Time Forgot. In 2016, Superman, his son Superboy, and Krypto were transported to the Island where they fought dinosaurs and found the remains of the Losers. Other versions =DC: The New Frontier= Writer/artist Darwyn Cooke uses the island in his out-of-continuity series DC: The New Frontier, where he connects the island with the dawn of the Silver Age. In this series, the island is portrayed as the main antagonist, a sentient being called the Centre which has existed on the Earth since before the dawn of the human race. Feeling threatened by humanity's development of nuclear weapons, the Centre decides to end all life on Earth. In New Frontier, the Centre is portrayed as a living island with the ability to hover over great distances and spawn grotesque mutant dinosaurs to attack or defend itself. In other media =Television= * Dinosaur Island is featured in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"Terror on Dinosaur Island\\". Gorilla Grodd and his followers used it as the base for their headquarters. Grodd comments that the Bahamas, West Indies, and Florida are within a 500-mile radius of Dinosaur Island. The island is also featured in the team-up with the Challengers of the Unknown in \\"Revenge of the Reach\\". In \\"Four Star Spectacular\\", Dinosaur Island appeared where Creature Commandos teamed up with Batman to thwart Ultra-Humanite when he plans to build a mind- controlled dinosaur army. After Ultra-Humanite was defeated, the Creature Commandos destroy Lt. Matthew Shrieve's footage of Dinosaur Island to keep the place a secret. * A variation of Dinosaur Island appears in the Justice League Action episode \\"Booster's Gold\\". After seeing a movie where scientists cloned dinosaurs back to life, Booster Gold starts his latest money-making venture where he brings some dinosaurs to an island near the Bermuda Triangle and established Dinosaur Island and the vacation village Booster World. When Green Arrow arrived and learned of Booster Gold's plan, it did not go well even with Green Arrow telling Booster Gold about the plan in the movie not going well as the two of them work to evade the carnivorous dinosaurs. * The third episode of the multi-part Teen Titans Go! storyline \\"Island Adventures\\", titled \\"Open Door Policy\\", has the Titans discovering that the island they are stranded on is home to a bunch of dinosaurs. They decide they can only do two things with them: Build a dinosaur themed amusement park or keep them as pets. When they choose the latter, they decide to have them compete to see which dinosaur is the best, arming them with Dino-Riders style armor and weaponry. =Film= * The Centre is featured as the main antagonist in Justice League: The New Frontier voiced by Keith David. This version is a monstrous creature born from the Earth that has the appearance of a floating island, and developed traits far beyond those of lesser beings. An organic sentient being observed the evolution of dinosaurs, the meteor shower, and the evolution of humans. It saw humans as a threat to the existence of other species and settled in the Pacific. Over the centuries, it has gained a reputation of an omnipresent spirit with no beginning nor end. Different cultures describe the same legend, the coming of an ominous, all-powerful presence and great suffering. The famous children's author, Theodore Smiesel was overcome by the Centre's telepathy and wrote \\"The Last Story\\" describing the Centre. After the book's completion, Smiesel committed suicide. After it rose in 1957, there was a steady rise in the number of mass delusions and people hearing voices in their heads and performing violent acts. It came across Paradise Island and attacked the Amazons. Wonder Woman was able to escape and warn Superman before the Centre reaches America. A collective of government officials and superheroes formed a multi-faceted plan to defeat the Centre off the coast of Florida. While they distract it with explosive payloads from outside and within, the Flash (Barry Allen) would expose it piece by piece with matter shrinking technology created by Ray Palmer. It sensed its end and attempted to make a suicide run at Cape Canaveral. Green Lantern intervened and used his newly- discovered powers to encapsulate the Centre and hurl it into space where its body implodes. The Centre is a living being the size of an island that can fly by means of energy propulsion, transform its substance to extrude tentacles and spawn giant dinosaur minions, project energy and inhale structures through its ports, and has mental powers like illusion casting, telepathy, and mind control over beings like Captain Cold. =Video Games= * Dinosaur Island appears in Lego DC Super-Villains during the level \\"The One With The T. Rex Mech\\". This version appears to combine both living and mechanical dinosaurs, as the former is seen in a cutscene and the latter constitutes the titular boss fight. Aquaman, Green Lantern, and \\"The Rookie\\" arrive on Dinosaur Island to recover a crashed Superman, wherein they fight Kalibak and the T. Rex Mech.

She was ordained by the Cumberland Presbyterian Church on November 5, 1889. Ordained ministry Woosley, a Cumberland Presbyterian from Kentucky, was ordained by Nolin Presbytery (Kentucky Synod) in that denomination on Tuesday, November 5, 1889. Although the constitution of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church did not exclude women from ordination, neither did it include them. A great controversy developed in various church judicatories over the legality of her ordination. Eventually, Kentucky Synod of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church instructed Nolin Presbytery to remove Louisa Woosley from their rolls. This the presbytery did by granting her the status of minister in transitu (\\"lettering her out\\" in presbyterian terms) to another presbytery. Clearly, although Nolin Presbytery complied with the instructions of the superior judicatory, they had denied their intent. In 1891, Woosley published her only book, 'Shall Woman Preach (1891 book)' which explained and justified her position. Louisa Woosley, with the aid of various Kentucky presbyteries sympathetic to her cause, outlasted the synodic objection to her ordination. In 1906, the partial reunion of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church with the Presbyterian Church USA removed some of the most vocal opposition to the ordination of women. Although the official position of the denomination remained unchanged, clergy women were able to participate in all levels of polity without a great deal of opposition. In 1920, the Cumberland Presbyterian denomination ruled that the word \\"man\\" as used in its constitution was to be considered as a gender neutral reference to a human being. More recently gender inclusive language came into broader use in the denomination. Almost a hundred years after Woosley's ordination, the Cumberland Presbyterian Church elected their first female General Assembly moderator, Beverly St. John, in 1988. Earlier ordinations In the entire Reformed tradition, only Antoinette Brown, a Congregationalist, can claim an earlier ordination in 1853. However, Brown's ordination was never recognized by the Congregational denomination and she later departed for the Unitarian Church. Woosley, on the other hand, was eventually recognized as a legitimate member of the Cumberland Presbyterian clergy and served in a variety of church offices for over 50 years.

The term non-silicon robot is often used to describe a robot that has some autonomous abilities. As a simple example, a non-silicon mobile robot could consist of a platform base with drive wheels and steering system connected to a series of mechanical switches arranged around the exterior of the robot so that when the robot collides with an object the switches are triggered so that it reverses direction. One of the most important areas of non-silicon robotics includes molecular and nano-scale machines.  History  Any robotic system that was built before the advent of modern electronics could be considered a non-silicon robot. Automation has been a significant component of industry for over 150 years and pre-transistor control systems of the 1930s and 1940s were fairly sophisticated. These control methods are largely forgotten. Such systems use pneumatic, mechanical and electric control systems. With some notable early exceptions (W. Grey Walter), in the modern era, non-silicon robots have been mainly confined to obscure research and purely teleoperated robots and have received relatively little attention. However, this is changing with the development of non- traditional computing technologies such as molecular computing (unconventional computing and non-silicon computing).

Plot summary  Sheridan, a gambling addict, has taken to abducting children for a man known as Mr. Wizard in order to pay off his enormous debts to a mobster who has threatened Sheridan with grievous bodily harm; Wizard has told Sheridan only that the children go \\"on a boat ride\\" (implicitly for human trafficking overseas), and Sheridan wants no further information. While lurking in a mall parking lot in his modified van, Sheridan spots his newest probable target of opportunity - a child standing near the entrance, obviously separated from his parents and distressed. Sheridan approaches him, convincing him that he has seen the child's Popsy (as the boy calls him). Continuing his standard procedure for the kidnappings, Sheridan lures the boy into his van, handcuffs him and drives off to make his delivery. On his way to the drop-off point, the boy shows unusual strength, biting Sheridan hard enough to leave two deep marks on his hand, as well as nearly ripping out the steel bar he is handcuffed to. In addition to these demonstrations of strength, the boy makes odd comments about his Popsy, such as his ability to find him and his ability to fly. By the time they are nearing their destination, night has fallen, and Sheridan sees an odd shape swoop by overhead. The boy claims this is his Popsy, and although Sheridan does not immediately believe it, he becomes nervous. Moments later, a wing covers the windshield and the door is ripped off, revealing a frightening and horrific, bat-like creature which slits Sheridan's throat and feeds his blood to the child.  Relation to other works  King states, as written in the notes section of Nightmares and Dreamscapes, that the Popsy of the title could be the very same air pilot vampire from \\"The Night Flier\\", another short story in the same collection.  Adaptations  The audiobook version of this story was narrated by actor Joe Mantegna.  Reception  Janet C. Beaulieu of the Bangor Daily News called it \\"simply wonderful\\".

Distribution The Patagonian opossum occurs further south, in Argentina, than any other living marsupial. Although distributed throughout some parts of southern Argentina, it is one of the least known mammals of South America.BIRNI-:Y. H. C . J. A. MONJEALI. C. J. PIUI.I-IPS. R. S. SIKES. AND I.

They have been spotted near Monte Phytogeographic Province, and in Patagonia Phytogeographic Province, yet there are no records of Patagonian opossums in central Patagonia, which leads mammalogists to believe that they can only live in the Patagonian steppe. There are two areas in the Patagonian steppe where these animals are often found: the province of La Pampa and Choele Choel (northern Rio Negro Province).Sauthier, Daniel Edgardo Udrizar. \\"Marsupialia, Didelphidae, Lestodelphys halli: New records, distribution extension and filling gaps.\\" Mammalia. (2007): n Form It is suggested that the Patagonian opossum may have emerged from the same ancestral group as Marmosa. They resemble each other closely. In the winter both types have similarly thickening at the base of the tails, where fat accumulates. Yet they do not share all aspects of their lifestyle; Patagonian opossums have a specialized way to gather and consume food, which is made possible by the shortening of their skull and jaws. The shortening occurs in the premolar region; this gives the Patagonian opossum increased biting power.Tate, G. H. H. 1933. A systematic revision of the marsupial genus Marmosa. Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist. 66:1-250. - 1934. New generic names for two South American marsupials. Jour. Mammal. 15:154. General characteristics The general appearance of the Patagonian opossum is similar to that of mouse opossums, except they have specialized features due to their predatorial way of life. Unlike mouse opossums, their skull has a reduced muzzle, wider zygomatic arch, as well as a crowded premolar region. Patagonian opossums have rather short fur, that are fine and soft. Their fur are usually gray, with the posterior being dark gray, the sides being a paler shade of gray, their shoulders are dark and their cheeks as well are eye region are white in color. Their ears are short, they are a pink flesh color, with the base of their ears being white. Their tails are much shorter than their head and their body.Thomas, O. 1921. A new genus of opossum from southern Patagonia. Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 8:136-139 Dentition The Patagonian opossum has generally 50 teeth. 18 incisors, 4 canines (tooth), 12 premolars, and 16 molars (tooth). Their canine is exceptionally long, and they are almost completely straight and vertical. The first pair of incisors are set aside from the other incisors, yet all of the incisors remain the same size. Incisor number 1,3,4 on the bottom jaw are curved at the base, while incisor number 2 is straight.Gabrif, Martin. \\"INTRASPECIFIC VARIATION IN LESTODELPHYS HALLI (MARSUPIALIA: DIDELPHIMORPHIA).\\" Journal of Mammalogy. 86.4 (2005): 793-803 The premolars increase in size from the first premolar to the third premolar. The first premolar is very reduced in size compare to the other premolar. The premolars also have a distinct set of cusp on them called the posterobasal cusp. Their molars are extremely long, combine all the length of the premolar and it will barely exceed the length of the first two molars. The upper molars are narrow in size, compared to any of the other living opossums. Diet Being a member of the Didelphidae (opossums), Patagonian opossums feed mainly on insects and fruits, yet insects and fruits are fairly rare in far-southern habitats. The shortage of fruits and insects in southern regions has led the Patagonian opossum to feed on mainly birds and mice. One specimen of Patagonian opossum was caught using a dead bird as bait; this led some researchers to believe that the Patagonian opossum lives totally on birds.Walker, E. P. et al. 1968.

The band released eight self-produced, sequentially numbered, ultra-low-distribution albums on cheap Radio Shack cassettes before signing to Sony's Relativity Records label, which distributed its ninth album (appropriately titled IX) in 1995. This album, Home's only release on a major label, received favorable reviews in publications such as Spin, The Village Voice and Magnet. Subsequent Home albums have appeared on independent record labels, also to generally positive reviews. Dave Fridmann of The Flaming Lips was the producer behind at least two of Home's albums. Though Home was originally regarded as a lo-fi band due to its primitive recording techniques, its releases starting with IX have largely featured a cleaner sound highlighted by guitars and various electronic keyboards. In reviewing IX, The Village Voice observed that Home's sound resembles bands from \\"the late '80s (Sebadoh, Grifters) and mid-70s (Devo, Faust, David Bowie) sprinkled with enough influences out of the bargain-bins (Elton John, Gong, David Bowie) to push the taste-envelope a smidgen closer to both prog-art and schmaltz-rock.\\" That album received a 7-out-of-10 rating from Spin. A year later, describing the band's independent album Elf: Gulf Bore Waltz, The Chicago Tribune wrote: \\"Laboring in the rock 'n' roll hinterland of Florida, the band Home has developed a refreshingly scattershot sound that wanders erratically through folky balladry, prog rock, ragged pop, and unclassifiable experimentation. Though somewhat reminiscent of indie rock obscurantists like Pavement, Home is both more ambitious and more consistently tuneful than many of its trendier peers.\\" Less charitably, The Trouser Press Record Guide opined: \\"When intently focused, Home can squeeze an agreeably synthetic, Devo- esque poptone (like 'Make It Right') from its gizmos. More often, though, Home lapses into wildly freeform freakouts (like 'Atomique') that combine electronic noise, found sound and even a bit of spoken word. ... Those endowed with short attention spans will no doubt have the easiest time making it all the way through IX.\\" The members of Home also helped found the Screw Music Forever record label and music collective. Besides releasing Home's own 7-inch singles, Screw Music also has released recordings by related bands such as Dumbwaiters, Pee Shy, Leels and the 100% Storms Ensemble. Home's 16th album, Sexteen, which the band describes as \\"a concept record about fucking,\\" was released in 2006. This album also marked the end of the band's longstanding relationship with its European label, Cooking Vinyl. During the same year, members of Home performed under the name Home Hunters during the Come The Freak On music festival at Bombshell Gallery in St. Petersburg, Florida. Home appeared on This Is Next Year: A Brooklyn-Based Compilation - Arena Rock Recording Co. - 2001 As of late 2006, Home was making preparations for its next album, Seventeen, envisioned as the soundtrack to a movie that the band members were simultaneously preparing to film.

The 27th district included parts of Santa Clara County, Santa Cruz County and Monterey County. Laird (along with Mark Leno) was one of the first two openly gay men to serve in the California legislature. Laird became one of the United States' first openly gay mayors in 1983 when he took over the mayoralty of the city of Santa Cruz, California. Early life Laird was raised in Vallejo, California, and educated in Vallejo public schools. Laird's parents were both educators. He graduated from Adlai Stevenson College of the University of California Santa Cruz in 1972 with an A.B. in Politics with general college honors, honors from the Board of Politics, and honors on an undergraduate thesis on the history of water development in California. Laird served for two years on the district staff of United States Representative Jerome Waldie, and worked during the summer of 1974 for Rep. Bill Gunter of Florida in his run for the U.S. Senate. Laird moved to Santa Cruz, California and joined the staff of the Santa Cruz County Administrator in 1974 and later served in the personnel and social services departments. City Council and Mayor In 1981, Laird received the most votes in a field of eight to be elected to a seat on the Santa Cruz City Council. He was re-elected as top vote-getter in 1985, serving until term limits ended his Council service in 1990. He was elected by the City Council to one-year Mayor's terms in 1983‚Äì84 and 1987‚Äì88.

The business closed in 2008.  History  Flagon, ruby glass, silver-gilt mounts, stones and enamels, 1858-9, John Hardman Powell, V&A; Museum no. M.39-1972 John Hardman senior, (1766‚Äì1844), of Handsworth, then in Staffordshire, England (and now part of Birmingham), was the head of a family business designing and manufacturing metalwork. He was described as the \\"opulent button maker and medallist\\".Roderick O'Donnell, The Pugins and the Catholic Midlands. In the 1830s Augustus Welby Pugin was commissioned by the Roman Catholic Bishop, Thomas Walsh, to design a suitable church to house the remains of St Chad, which had been rescued from destruction at Lichfield Cathedral during the Reformation. When the building was consecrated in 1841 as Saint Chad's Cathedral, it was the first Roman Catholic cathedral to be built in England since the Reformation. For the recently converted Catholic, Pugin, this was a commission of great importance. Saints of Praise, St Mary's Church, Washington, West Sussex Pugin first had contact with the John Hardmans during the construction of St Chad's Chapel, the forerunner to the cathedral scheme. John Hardman junior, (1812‚Äì67), left the family business in 1838 and set up on his own to manufacture ecclesiastical metalwork. Pugin employed Hardman's to provide metalwork for St Chad's Cathedral. Hardman was an enthusiastic donor, giving the rood screen to the cathedral and being recognised for his provision to various charities by the gift of the Hardman Chantry in which John Hardman senior was interred in 1844, and which remained the family burial place. From 1845, at the urging of Pugin, John Hardman entered the burgeoning industry of stained glass manufacture. He was joined by his nephew, John Hardman Powell (1827‚Äì95) who married Pugin‚Äôs daughter Anne in 1850, and claimed to be Pugin‚Äôs only pupil. Powell became the chief designer from about 1849, prior to Pugin‚Äôs death in 1852. The company took part in the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London, exhibiting the great chandelier designed for Alton Towers. Hardman and Powell collaborated with A. W. Pugin's son, E. W. Pugin, firstly in the design of the funeral arrangements of John Talbot, 16th Earl of Shrewsbury in November 1852. The collaboration between the Hardman firm and the Pugins was to continue after E. W. Pugin‚Äôs death in 1875 with the later firm, Pugin & Pugin. This collaboration lasted for three generations and was a major influence on Catholic church architecture and decoration in particular and the Gothic Revival in general. Under the management of J.H. Powell the metalwork design department split from the stained glass department in 1883 and traded under the name Hardman, Powell and Co. Powell died in 1895, passing the leadership of the firm to John Bernard Hardman, the grandson of John Hardman Snr, who headed the company until 1903 and took the firm to the Exposition Universelle, Paris. The firm continued producing stained glass in the 21st century under directorship of Donald Taunton and Patrick A. Feeny until the 1970s, and had premises at 26 Frederick Street in The Jewellery Quarter, Birmingham, Newhall Hill and Lightwoods House. A large proportion of the Hardman archive, particularly their Medieval Room, was damaged and destroyed in a fire at the Newhall Hill studio in 1970; some of the earliest and most damaged cartoons are now held in temperature controlled storage at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery. The business was closed in 2008.  Design  =Gothic Revival= David and Jubal from Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin Through the influence of A.W.Pugin, John Ruskin, and the Oxford Movement, it was considered during the mid-19th century that the only appropriate style in which a church should be built was Gothic. This fashion was combined with a general renewal within the church and a growth of Roman Catholicism. The result was that many designers in different fields tried to imitate the Medieval style in their work. This was particularly the case in the stained glass industry. Pugin, who supplied the first designs for Hardmans, was thoroughly absorbed in the Medieval and was a designer of the highest order. He produced designs of every description- churches, windows, furniture, vestments, vessels, tiles, jewellery and, for the interiors of the Houses of Parliament, Gothic thrones, Gothic hat-stands and Gothic ashtrays. With his busy regime, he increasingly relied upon his talented son-in-law, Powell, to provide the designs for stained glass. The firm had many subcontractors and designers who are not well-known but produced exceptional work under the Hardman name. For example, the Pippet family of Solihull, William John Wainwright and R.J. Hopkins.Bill Covington, 'J.A Pippet and Hardman, Powell & Company', True Principles, vol. 2 No. 3, 2001 = John Hardman Powell = Powell's stained glass recreates the elegance, the refinement, the brevity that is seen in some of the finest examples of glass, sculpture and illumination of the 13th and 14th centuries. He utilised the flowing, curving lines, the flourish of drapery, the calligraphic brushstrokes and pure colour. However, Powell's work was not, like many stained glass designers, merely imitative. His designs are original innovations in the Gothic style. The quality of Hardman's church windows, particularly in the 1850s and 1860s, was superb. The Gospel writers, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John from St Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney = Major commissions = The most famous building that the Hardmans made glass for was the new Houses of Parliament in London, for which Pugin was the interior designer. Pugin employed the Scottish firm of Ballantine and Allen to manufacture the windows that he designed for the House of Lords, but all the rest were made by Hardmans, who have maintained their relationship with that building, repairing and replacing glass damaged or destroyed during World War II. Apart from the windows created for Pugin's churches in England and Ireland, two of Hardman's major commissions were to come from Australia. In the 1860s the architect Edmund Blacket commissioned Hardmans to supply 27 windows, including a 6-light West window and a 7-light East window for St. Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney. They were installed for the consecration in 1868. In the 1880s William Wardell selected the same firm to provide windows for St. Mary's R.C. Cathedral in the same city. This building, of which the nave was not completed until the 1930s, is very much larger than St Andrew's and has three large rose windows and an enormous East window, the tracery of which was based directly on that of Lincoln Cathedral, c.1280. The design of this huge window, depicting the Coronation of the Blessed Virgin Mary is one of the pinnacles of achievement in Gothic Revival stained glass.

Donna Troy was seemingly killed by a rogue Superman android, leaving Cassie shaken and causing both teams to disband. =Teen Titans= Cassie later joined some former members of Young Justice in the newest incarnation of the Teen Titans.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #1 (2003) Early on, she was gifted with a lassoTeen Titans (vol. 3) #2 (2003) by Ares, the Greek god of war and frequent enemy of Wonder Woman and the Amazons. Despite appearing similar to Wonder Woman's lasso, Cassie's expels Zeus' lightning when used in anger.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #6 (2003) Over the course of the series, Ares often appeared to Wonder Girl to warn her about \\"the coming war\\".Teen Titans (vol. 3) #8 (2003)Teen Titans (vol. 3) #15 (2004) During her time with the Titans, Cassie also developed a relationship with Superboy, whom she had harbored feelings before and throughout Young Justice. In \\"Titans Tomorrow\\",\\"Titans Tomorrow\\": Teen Titans (vol. 3) #17‚Äì19 (2005) the Titans are thrown ten years into their future, where they encountered future versions of themselves. In this future, Cassie inherited the mantle of Wonder Woman after Diana was killed during \\"the Crisis\\". She is also referred to as \\"Ares' champion\\", and is in a relationship with Conner Kent (Superboy). It is not revealed whether they are married or merely dating. It was also during her Titans membership that she was revealed to be Zeus' daughter, a fact both Zeus and her mother kept from her for most of her life. Cassie was originally told by her mother that her biological father had died. Wonder Woman knew about Cassie's link to Zeus but chose to hide this from Cassie as well at the request of Cassie's mother. In \\"The Insiders\\",\\"The Insiders\\": Teen Titans (vol. 3) #24‚Äì25 (2005)\\"The Insiders\\":Outsiders (vol. 3) #24‚Äì25 (2005) she was beaten by Superboy as a result of his possession by Lex Luthor; though she recovered, Superboy secluded himself at the Kent farm in Smallville,Teen Titans (vol. 3) #26 (2005)Infinite Crisis #1 (2005)Supergirl (vol. 5) #2 (2005) and there had seemed to be a strain on their relationship until the events of Infinite Crisis. When the Teen Titans and the Outsiders learned that Donna Troy was still alive in The Return of Donna Troy, Cassie was among the heroes that traveled to the planet Minosyss to reunite with her. Having had false memories implanted by the Titans of Myth, Donna savagely beat Cassie, until Cassie was able to restore her true memories.The Return of Donna Troy #3 (2005) =Infinite Crisis= Teen Titans Annual #1 Cover art by Ed Benes During a battle against Brother Blood and a handful of zombie Titans, she acknowledged that her powers were fluctuating and sometimes disappearing altogether.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #30‚Äì31 (2005) Despite this, Cassie attempted to help Superboy after he was beaten to near-death by Superboy-PrimeInfinite Crisis #4 (2006)Teen Titans (vol. 3) #32 (2006) After saving him, Wonder Girl and the Titans infiltrated a LexCorp laboratory to find a way to cure Superboy.Robin #146‚Äì47 (2006) While the other Titans flew to Bl√ºdhaven following an attack from the Society, Cassie remained at Titans Tower to watch over Superboy. When he awoke, the pair of them reconnected and remembered their past in Young Justice, which seemed so much happier and easier. Conner then took Cassie to Smallville, and, afraid that it would be their last night together, they consummate their love.Teen Titans Annual #1 (2006) Ares again appears to her and informed that the reason behind her weakening power was Zeus taking back the powers he had granted to her as he left the mortal plane. Ares then offered Cassie some of his power in exchange for becoming his champion and acknowledging him as her brother.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #33 She joins Superboy and Nightwing up north, with powers returned, to assist in the assault on Lex Luthor's tower. Superboy sacrificed his life to defeat Superboy-Prime and destroy the tower, and died.Infinite Crisis #6 (2006) =The Cult of Conner= Directly after Infinite Crisis, the Teen Titans fall apart. Cassie, feeling abandoned by her best friends, leaves the Titans during the year in which 52 takes place, following Robin's departure. Cassie becomes involved in a cult heavily influenced by Kryptonian culture. She sets up an altar in Titans Tower with Kryptonian crystals and a gold figure with the Superman-insignia, which means \\"hope\\" in Kryptonian. Soon, Ralph Dibny approaches her because someone defaced the grave of his wife Sue with an upside down 'S' Shield, which in Kryptonian means \\"resurrection\\". About five days later, Cassie and her fellow cult members meet with Ralph. Cassie mentions that it was another member, Dev-Em, who led her to join. Cassie explains that the goal of the cult is to resurrect Superboy. As a test of their process, they intend to resurrect Sue Dibny. Cassie and Ralph attend a ceremony designed to resurrect Sue, but Ralph grows suspicious and with the help of other superheroes, disrupts the ceremony, destroying the Kryptonite which was essential to the process. Cassie leaves with Dev-Em, blaming Ralph for destroying her chances to resurrect Superboy. After stopping Weather Wizard in Metropolis, Cassie meets Supernova and refers to him incorrectly as Kon-El, who actually turns out to be Booster Gold in disguise. =One Year Later= During \\"One Year Later\\", Wonder Girl is seen attempting to stop Gemini of the Brotherhood of Evil from escaping S.T.A.R. Labs with valuable technology, revealing that she had been following the Brotherhood for some time. She also sports a new costume influenced by that of the late Superboy. She now wears a Golden Age Wonder Woman-themed t-shirt and denim jeans.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #34 (2006) She temporarily rejoins the team,Teen Titans (vol. 3) #35 (2006) under the suggestion of Cyborg so that they may combine forces to defeat the Brotherhood of Evil. After the Teen Titans and Doom Patrol defeat the Brotherhood of Evil, she decides to rejoin the team permanently. When she goes to tell Robin of her decision, she discovers his secretive and unsuccessful attempts to bring back Superboy. Though obsessed with having Conner back, Cassie reacts in horror and in an attempt to quell Robin's anger at Cassie, the two kiss. For a while the two refused to talk about the incident beyond coming to the agreement that it was a mistake, but they both have discussed it with others.Wonder Woman (vol. 4) #4 (2007)Supergirl (vol. 5) #11 (2007)Supergirl (vol. 5) #12 (2007) With her life in disarray, Cassie has been having difficulty with her personal life, often having major confrontations with her mother. Cassie has gained a new friendship with the recently returned Supergirl, Kara Zor-El, who has shared with her in mourning the loss of Superboy and Paradise Island.Supergirl (vol. 5) #10 (2006) Cassie was also still very furious at Wonder Woman following the events of Infinite Crisis, due to her belief that Wonder Woman abandoned her after Conner's death to play secret agent in a new civilian identity that Batman created for her after Infinite Crisis. She was also not pleased that Robin was aware of Diana's whereabouts during the year after Infinite Crisis and did not inform her about it. Diana and Cassie have not been able to discuss their past differences, leading to Cassie to turn to Supergirl and the now resurrected Donna Troy instead for emotional support dealing with Conner's death. Following the resurrection of Jericho at the hands of Raven, Wonder Girl and Robin request that Raven use the same ceremony to resurrect Superboy. Raven calmly explains that is not possible, because Jericho's resurrection was a special case: Jericho's soul was still on Earth, imprisoned inside of a computer disk, while Conner's has moved on to the afterlife. In the middle of this conversation with Robin and Raven, Wonder Girl is captured by Deathstroke's villainous Titans East after an attack by Inertia and Match. Each member of Titans East has been recruited to negate a specific Titan. Deathstroke selected Match, a Bizarro-type clone of Superboy, to counter Wonder Girl due to his strength and his warped visage as being a psychological edge against her.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #43 (2007) The Titans battle furiously against the Titans East, during which they are able to convince Batgirl and Duela Dent to switch sides. Unfortunately the team is defeated by Slade's team a second time. However, Raven, Cyborg, and Duela Dent manage to get aid from Nightwing, Donna Troy, Beast Boy, and Flash (Bart Allen). Together the Titans defeat Slade, who along with Inertia, manages to escape. During the fight Jericho possess Match, and the team is reluctant to release Match due to the danger he poses. In the Countdown limited series, Cassie attends Bart Allen's funeral and during a heated and controversial eulogy, she vows to get revenge for Bart's death. Cassie then becomes involved in the Amazon's attack on Washington D.C. Supergirl and Wonder Girl discover that their friends and family have been placed in an internment camp due to their ties to the Amazons. After a failed attempt to aid them, the two heroes agree to bring the U.S. President to Queen Hippolyta in order to stop the war. They are ambushed by a group of Amazons in the process, which causes the President to become mortally wounded. The actions of the Amazons and Wonder Girl's own involvement cause public outcry against all those who have followed in Wonder Woman's footsteps. Ultimately Cassie declares that despite her training and past that she is not an Amazon, preferring her ties to the Teen Titans over that of the Amazons.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #49 Accepting her decision, Artemis wishes her well and leaves Cassie to her devices. Wonder Girl celebrates by sharing another kiss with Robin in front of her teammates. In the months following the kiss, Cassie and Tim continue to go through 'will-they-won't-they' moments in which they both continue to question the validity of their relationship. Then following a battle against an army of future Titans, the pair decided at last to date. Unfortunately, their relationship is short-lived, as after their first official date Cassie ends the relationship, because she feels she is using Tim.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #55 (2008) This has resulted in a growing animosity between the pair, which has begun to bleed into their relationships with the other Titans. Huntress Cassie in her Amazon armor. Art by Aaron Lopresti.Wonder Girl recently appeared in a six-issue self-titled mini-series written by J. Torres and with art and covers by Sanford Greene and Nathan Massengill. In this series, Wonder Girl attempts to make up for the mistakes made by the Amazons on her own. Cassie adopts a secret identity, taking up the name \\"Drusilla\\" (the same name used by Wonder Girl in the '70s Wonder Woman television series). However, as she attempts to apprehend a group of mystical beasts left over from the Amazons' attack, she finds herself confronted by her half-brother Hercules, who claims to want to help her become a true champion of the gods and to rebuild Olympus. Cassie is reluctant to trust him. Hercules persists and chases after Cassie, taking the form of Superboy in order to get her attention. Together, Hercules and Cassie try to discover who is attacking the remaining Olympian gods. Soon into their search they are attacked by the Female Furies. Hercules stops the fight by explaining that he has allied with the Furies in hopes of rescuing the gods, or, failing that, starting a new pantheon with them. The Furies have their own plans and are only using Hercules to get to Wonder Girl. The Furies soon betray Hercules, with Bloody Mary using her bite to gain power over Hercules, forcing him to do what the Furies want. The Furies then kidnap Cassie's mother to lure her into a trap. Aided by the Olympian, Wonder Girl goes into battle, being forced to fight her own brother. The Teen Titans, Empress, Arrowette and Wonder Woman show up to help. After Bloody Mary is murdered by the New Gods killer, Hercules is freed from her spell and immediately saves Wonder Girl from being kidnapped by the Furies. Hercules goes free after he reveals he is now a demi-god and that Zeus released him to help stop \\"the Great Disaster\\". Hercules then leaves to perform certain \\"labors\\". The series ends with Cassie reconciling with Wonder Woman, who tells Cassie that she has become her own woman. Cassie is later attacked by her nephew Lycus, the son of Ares. He attempts to take her title as Ares' avatar, along with her power. Although he is successful in stealing Cassie's powers derived from Ares, Cassie discovers that she no longer needs to be blessed with powers from the gods as she willed her own innate power to surface. Cassie now possesses a high level of super- strength all her own. Robin ultimately makes the decision to leave the Teen Titans for an undetermined length of time in the aftermath of Batman R.I.P, leaving Cassie with the task of assembling and leading a new team. After an unsuccessful attempt at having Kid Devil recruit teen metahumans such as Klarion, Shining Knight, and the teen members of the Justice Society of America, Cassie eventually gains three new Titans in Static, Aquagirl, and Kid Eternity. Kid Eternity's ability to summon the spirits of the deceased briefly tempts Cassie, who considers having him summon Conner's spirit. However, she eventually decides against it, telling Eternity never to grant her such a request, even if she were to beg him.Teen Titans #71 Some months later, between the Final Crisis and the Blackest Night, Cassie becomes aware of Conner's rebirth by Brainiac 5's hand. Despite meeting him briefly at his return,Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds #5 (2009) Cassie decides to wait, until Martha Kent herself, now sheltering Conner at her place, invites Cassie for dinner, essentially granting Cassie and Conner a date. At first skeptical and fearing to end as Lana Lang, basically forgotten and replaced as Conner relocated to Smallville and gained a new circle of friends, she's touched by Conner opening his heart to her about her fears and dreams for their future life, and thus decides to tell Conner about herself and Tim Drake. Conner quickly forgives her, arguing that even if Cassie still loves him, she could not have known of his impending resurrection in the immediate aftermath of the Infinite Crisis, so she has nothing to blame. Happily, Cassie accepts to rekindle their relationship.Adventure Comics (vol. 2) #2 (September 2009) Due to personal responsibilities, neither Conner nor Bart return to the Teen Titans, though Wonder Girl still continues to lead. However, following the demise of Kid Devil, Cassie begins questioning her leadership and begins to make mistakes. During a massive battle with Cinderblock in downtown San Francisco, Wonder Girl refuses to let her team attack the villain directly, causing massive destruction to the area. The heroes continue in their fruitless stalemate until Beast Boy arrives and takes command of the team, leading to their victory. In the aftermath of the battle, Beast Boy tells Cassie that she has to stop dwelling on Devil's death or else more innocent people are going to get hurt, something she does not take kindly.Titans (vol. 2) #17 (August 2009) A few days later, Beast Boy makes the decision to move back into Titans Tower and replace Cassie as the head of the team, declaring that they need a more experienced leader to get back on track. Though Cassie initially says nothing about this, she ultimately becomes angry and tells Beast Boy that no one asked for his help, and that she can lead the team just fine. Beast Boy simply replies by saying that the Teen Titans need help, and that everyone, including Cyborg, think so.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #75-76 (September‚ÄìOctober 2009) =Blackest Night= During the events of Blackest Night, Cassie joins Kid Flash and Beast Boy as part of a small group of past and present Titans who assemble at Titans Tower. Lacking assistance from Static, Miss Martian, Blue Beetle, Bombshell, and Aquagirl (each of whom are presumably defending other cities), the team barely survives the onslaught.Blackest Night: Titans #1-3 After Dawn Granger uses her abilities to destroy the Black Lanterns, Cassie and the others travel to Coast City in order to assist Barry Allen and Hal Jordan in their battle with Nekron, the leader of the Black Lantern Corps. To the horror of the gathered heroes, Nekron uses his abilities to transform several once-dead heroes into Black Lanterns, including Superboy, Kid Flash, Donna, and Wonder Woman.Blackest Night #5 (November 2009) In the ensuing battle, Cassie is killed when Donna Troy violently tears her heart out. However, it is then revealed that the entire battle was an imagination of Wonder Woman, and Cassie is shown to still be alive.Blackest Night: Wonder Woman #2 (January 2010) When Black Lantern Conner attacks Cassie, all the while attempting to break free from the Black Ring's control, Conner manages to break the control in temporary, short lapses, which he uses to alert Cassie about the solution to his Black Ring problem. The battle moves to the fortress, where Cassie realizes what Conner was referring to when he told them to move to the Fortress of Solitude Conner's corpse, placed where he awaits his resurrection in Legion of Three Worlds. The Black Ring, confused, leaves the living Conner and tries to attach itself to his corpse, but Conner awakens his freeze breath ability, which freezes the ring, and Cassie throws it into orbit. After reconciling, the pair heads back to Coast City for the final battle with Nekron's army.Adventure Comics (vol. 2) #7 (February 2010) =Return of Conner= After this, Cassie travels to New York to confront Cyborg about Beast Boy's statements. He assures her that she is capable of leading the Titans, and she returns to the team and admits to them that she is done moping over Conner and Eddie. She then leads the team to the city of Dakota in order to rescue Static, who had been kidnapped by a superhuman gangster named Holocaust.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #79 (January 2010) After hearing about a battle between Static and Holocaust in downtown Dakota, Cassie arrives on the scene with Bombshell and Aquagirl. The three heroines are easily defeated and captured by Holocaust, who then informs them that he plans on killing them and weaponizing their powers in order to sell. Beast Boy and the other Titans arrive at the compound to retrieve their comrades, but end up being overpowered and defeated themselves. At the last second, Cyborg bursts into the compound with Superboy and Kid Flash, preparing to rescue the other Titans.Teen Titans #80-81 Cassie is soon freed, and assists Superboy in holding off Holocaust while the other Titans make their escape. In the final battle, Cassie uses her lasso to bind the villain, allowing Kid Flash to finish him off by sending him plummeting into the Earth's inner core (though thanks to his superhuman durability, Static remarks that the core would not kill him). On the plane ride back to San Francisco, Conner remarks that Cassie seems to be ignoring him, and she simply responds by telling him that he is correct.Teen Titans #82 Cassie later travels to Gotham City alongside several of her fellow Titans after Ra's al Ghul begins targeting people close to Tim Drake. She attempts to rescue Barbara Gordon from members of the League of Assassins, but arrives to find that she has already defeated the men that attempted to kill her. During the events of Brightest Day, Cassie confronts a recently resurrected Titan by the name of Osiris when he arrives at Titans Tower, looking for help from his former teammates. Cassie tries to convince Osiris to turn himself over to the police for the murdering the Persuader during 52, but he angrily brushes her off and flees before Cassie can contact the authorities. Blue Beetle asks if the Titans should go after him, but Cassie simply replies by saying that Osiris will return, and then rhetorically asks, \\"where else can he go?\\"Titans (vol. 2) #24 After a disastrous mission to another dimension in order to rescue Raven, the Titans are torn asunder. Miss Martian is rendered comatose, Static is left temporarily depowered, and Aquagirl and Bombshell are missing and presumed dead at sea. Despite her pleas for Static to stay, Wonder Girl is ultimately left with a roster consisting of only herself, Superboy, Kid Flash, Raven, and Beast Boy.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #87 A short time after this, the Titans rescue Bombshell and Aquagirl, who are both removed from the team by Wonder Girl. When asked about this decision (as well as the subsequent choice to invite the unstable Rose Wilson back into the team), Wonder Girl states that Kid Devil's death has forced her to realize that inexperienced teen heroes have no place on the team. At the same time, she admits to Conner that she is having trouble reconciling her knowledge as a leader with her fear of losing him again.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #88 =One-shot= In January 2011, Wonder Girl was given a one-shot, which was written by JT Krul, drawn by Adriana Melo, and covered by Nicola Scott. =The New 52= In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Cassie Sandsmark is reintroduced in the Teen Titans series. This version of Cassie, who dislikes being called \\"Wonder Girl\\", started out as a teenage thief, who started at the age of sixteen and lost touch with her mother, who stole a pair of enchanted bracelets from a temple before meeting Red Robin. Living in Hollywood surviving on a crime spree and bought a little house with the money she made. She first crossed paths with Red Robin after she was rescued from an organization called N.O.W.H.E.R.E, who were capturing young teenagers who were developing metahuman abilities for their own nefarious purposes. She caught the organization's attention when her exploits were attaching attention her from the media which they dubbed her \\"Wonder Girl\\". She stole a car but was later pulled by a police officer in the Pacific Coast Highway, the latter was revealed to be an agent of N.O.W.H.E.R.E. and tried to capture her but Red Robin intervened. Red Robin was tracking down N.O.W.H.E.R.E and news coverage of teenagers with abilities and their action such as in New Mexico, a Mexican teenager boy who can make energy constructs and is calling himself Bunker(comics) is arrested by state police only to later escape custody, in Westchester, New York, Bart Allen had interrupted a news coverage of a fire in an abandoned mansion to announce himself to the world. The fire department had the blaze under control but then overhears one of the fire marshals being trapped on the roof so he rushes into the flames to save him but in his haste he forgets about backdraft and opening the door to the balcony and causes a massive explosion of fire. Kid Flash, knocked unconscious, is held responsible for bringing the blaze to an uncontrollable peak. News reports emerged about of a \\"Beast Boy\\" who could shape shift into any animal, and many others such as reports of a missing Solstice (comics), a teen hero calling himself Static is seen in NYC, a boy posted pictures of a sexy orange girl with fiery hair (Starfire) in a purple bikini he spotted in Martinique on his online social media account, and photos a \\"Martian Girl\\" in a lecture by Lex Luther about aliens on earth.Teen Titans (vol. 4) #2 She is later revealed to be the daughter of Helen, an archaeologist who reputation was destroyed when Cassie stole the bracelets which resulted in the death of one of Helen's colleagues, who was Cassandra's one time love interest and mentor in stealing, and Lennox Sandsmark, a British super-soldier, who left the family when Cassie was only four years old.Teen Titans Vol 4 #13 (December 2012) As Lennox is a demigod son of Zeus, and also a half-brother of Wonder Woman, Cassie, for the first time, is related to Wonder Woman.Teen Titans Vol 4 #19 (June 2013) =Rebirth= In the Super Sons of Tomorrow crossover, the version of Cassie Sandmark from the Titans Tomorrow future briefly arrived in the present timeline of Rebirth alongside other members of the Titans of Tomorrow. In Young Justice #2, Zeus refers to Cassie as \\"the future of the pantheon of the gods\\". As part of her birthright, Zeus offers her a necklace that is said to contain immense powers. However, Cassie decides to hold off on taking this gift until she does something to truly earn it. Zeus calls her a \\"giant pain, just like her mother\\". Powers and abilities Cassandra originally received her powers from a number of mystical artifacts employed by Artemis during her time as Wonder Woman. These included the Gauntlet of Atlas and the Sandals of Hermes, which provided her with the powers of strength and speed/flight, respectively. She was eventually granted similar abilities by Zeus as \\"her fondest wish\\". Discouraged by previously shown arrogance in his children (Ares and Heracles), Zeus also blessed Cassandra's mother with the ability to take away her powers for a short time via a simple touch. Shortly after joining the Teen Titans, Ares approached her and gave Cassandra her own magic lasso. Unlike Wonder Woman's Lasso of Truth, Cassandra's is a weapon which channels Zeus' lightning when she becomes angry. When the Greek gods left the mortal plane as a result of the events of Infinite Crisis, taking Cassandra's powers along with them, Ares offered her some of his power, saying that she would be \\"more powerful than [she's] ever been\\". What this entails is not made entirely clear, though she appeared to have retained all of her former abilities. In a storyline taking place \\"One Year Later\\", Cassie was shown catching a falling jet, which she was surprised at being able to accomplish.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #40 (2006) However, while trying to stop the military from detaining her mother, Ares causes her powers to fluctuate when he believes she is wasting them on frivolous matters. In the end, Ares was not pleased with Cassandra as his champion. He returned another to take her place. During a battle with Ares' son, King Lycus, who also drew power from him, Cassie was able to cast away her connection to the war god, and tap into her own powers as a demi-god (like her brother Heracles). Her real powers increased to an even greater level of strength than before. Currently, having tapped into her own demi- goddess powers, Cassie is an Olympian powerhouse. Although, she is not as powerful as Wonder Woman or Donna Troy, Cassie is still a powerful young woman. Her lasso has apparently also changed, enabling her to turn Lycus to dust with a simple order. Cassie was trained by the Amazon Artemis and is extremely well trained in the use of various weapons and in various martial arts. She is also a very capable leader and strategist. After the New 52 reboot, Cassie's powers have changed yet again. Her powers are now derived from the \\"Silent Armor\\" that she wears, which was forged in the heart of a sun and is apparently related to the demon known as Trigon. The armor is invisible unless she summons it or is in a combat situation, but she is always able to use its powers. The armor usually appears as a glittering red bodysuit, golden gauntlets and, occasionally, a hood. The armor grants her powers similar to those of her pre-reboot counterpart such as superhuman strength (sufficient enough for her to fight against Superboy for a short time), durability (though she is still vulnerable to piercing weapons), superhuman reflexes, and the power to fly at high speeds. The armor also grants her a glowing red lasso that appears similar to barbed wire. The lasso is infinite in length, is virtually indestructible, and can drain the life force out of those wrapped in its confines. Cassie's armor also appears to have a mind of its own and has taken over her mind and body on a few occasions. It was later revealed that Cassie has divine heritage as well, as her father was revealed to be Wonder Woman's elder brother Lennox.Teen Titans #65 Other versions * Cassie played a central role in issue #54 of the Teen Titans Go! comic. She was the head of her high school's Wonder Woman fan club and had repeatedly tried to get the superhero to visit her school. Her obsession led her to steal two mystical artifacts that granted her superpowers, after which she barged into an athletic tournament on Paradise Island. This event was set up by Donna Troy to see which of the world's young female heroes might be able to replace her as Wonder Woman's partner. Cassie initially planned to defeat Donna one-on- one, but wound up saving her from an invasion by the undersea villain Trident instead. At the issue's end, Donna offered Cassie a chance to join the Titans' worldwide training program, once her mother was through punishing her for stealing the artifacts. She made a brief appearance in issue #55, sucker- punching Cyborg in his dreams. * Cassie also has a recurring role on the Tiny Titans comic by Art Baltazar and Franco Aureliani. In the first issue, she is ridiculed by her cousin Donna Troy, Dick Grayson, Cyborg (comics), and Kid Flash for wearing a T-shirt and jeans instead of a skirt with stars. However, when she returns, wearing a skirt with stars and a helmet, she finds the boys all wearing T-shirts and jeans. Her response to this is: \\"What? I did it first, y'know!\\"\\"Tiny Titans\\" #1 * In the comic tie-in to Injustice: Gods Among Us, Cassie is with the Titans when the Joker's nuclear bomb goes off. Her attire is similar to that of Wonder Woman's in the game. She is sent to spy on Conner after he is devastated by Superman's actions to see what he's up to, and finds him at the Fortress of Solitude trying to find the Phantom Zone Projector. She and the other Titans try to help Conner stop Superman, but Superman mortally wounds him. She and the Titans are sent to the Phantom Zone by Superman to save Conner's life and to stop them from interfering with Superman's plans. In the prequel to Injustice 2, they are freed from the Phantom Zone thanks to the Insurgency. As evidenced during their fight with Amazo, her relationship to her mentor, Wonder Woman, is strained due to the latter allying with the Regime (though Diana is still concerned for Cassie's well-being and had no idea about Superman sending the Titans to the Phantom Zone). In other media =Television= * In the episode \\"Paradise Lost\\" from the first season of the Justice League animated series, Wonder Woman saves a young blonde girl from a tree. When Wonder Woman returns the girl to her mother, the mother calls the girl \\"Cassie\\". This is an obvious reference to Cassie Sandsmark from the comics. * Wonder Girl appears in the Young Justice: Invasion episode \\"Happy New Year\\", voiced by Mae Whitman. She is introduced as a member of the Team's Beta Squad alongside Batgirl where they first appear to fight Lobo who was targeting U.N. Secretary General Tseng (who was actually an alien in disguise). In \\"Alienated\\" Wonder Girl and Wonder Woman were part of Delta Squad during the mission to stop the Kroloteans on Malina Island. They both took out multiple Mechs. When they learned the base was set to explode, she and the team retreated to the Bio-Ship. In \\"Beneath\\" she, Miss Martian, Bumblebee, and Batgirl liberated a group of abductees guarded by Mammoth, Icicle Jr., Devastation, Shimmer, and Psimon in Bialya. In \\"Before the Dawn\\", Wonder Girl and Alpha Squad followed a Manta-Flyer from Star City to the Reach's headquarters to rescue their captured teammates and other abductees. The operation was cut short by a Reach enforcer, who Wonder Girl dubbed as \\"Black Beetle\\". As he overpowered and easily defeated the team one by one, Cassie contacted the other heroes for help. Black Beetle pinned her against the door, and mercilessly slammed her into it repeatedly until she was down. Blue Beetle, Beast Boy and Impulse arrived. While Blue Beetle held off the Black Beetle, Impulse and Beast Boy helped the team aboard the Bio- Ship and escaped. Wonder Girl and Tim Drake became a couple shortly after the Reach invasion concluded. Wally West's death was the catalyst in giving Wonder Girl the courage to kiss him. In the third season, she tries patch things up with Tim Drake after he leaves the Team and becomes a member of the Batman Inc. Later in the season, she helps found the Outsiders (alongside Beast Boy, Blue Beetle, Static, Geo-Force, and Bart Allen). =Film= * Cassie Sandsmark makes a cameo appearance in the DC animated movie, Justice League: Throne of Atlantis. She is shown eating dinner behind the table of Superman and Wonder Woman. When Cyborg and Shazam come to fetch them via boom tube, Cassie stands up and exclaims \\"I love you, Shazam!\\" She is apparently wearing a Shazam T-shirt. * The Young Justice version of Cassie Sandsmark, along with Artemis, Zatanna, and Miss Martian, makes a cameo appearance as home viewers in Scooby- Doo! WrestleMania Mystery. =Video games= * Cassandra Sandsmark/Wonder Girl appears in DC Universe Online, voiced by Mindy Raymond.

Its chief executive is Raj Jain. In December 2017 it was announced that the Trust was to form a new healthcare organisation by combining with Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust. The new organisation, to be called the Northern Care Alliance NHS Group, would have 17,000 staff, and a combined operating budget of ¬£1.3bn covering Oldham, Bury, Rochdale, Salford and North Manchester.  History  In July 2016 the trust was to initiate an integrated care organisation which would include 440 adult social care staff transferred from the City of Salford. Mental health services were to be provided by Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust but Salford would manage the contract. It was hoped that this would deliver ¬£36 million a year in savings by 2021, largely by reducing hospital admissions, cutting management costs and removing duplication. In September 2016, the trust was selected by NHS England as one of twelve Global Digital Exemplars. It uses an Allscripts electronic patient record system which is being adopted by other NHS organisations nearby. It planned to move its electronic patient records to Microsoft Azure by March 2018. Northern Care Alliance NHS Group took over management of the trust's activities in 2017. In 2019 the trust established a 10-year partnership with Hitachi Consulting to set up a digital control centre which \\"will be able to better match patient and service user individual needs to available resources so that waste and waiting is minimised\\", at a cost of ¬£25 million. David Dalton (later Sir David) was chief executive from 2001 until April 2019, when he stepped down and was replaced by Raj Jain, who is also chief executive of the Northern Care Alliance NHS Group. Performance In 2015, the trust was one of the top performing NHS trusts in the United Kingdom.Four-hour target in the emergency department quarterly figures from NHS England Data from https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work- areas/ae-waiting-times-and-activity/ In the same year it was named by the Health Service Journal as one of the top hundred NHS trusts to work for. At that time it had 6,219 full-time equivalent staff and a sickness absence rate of 4.42%. 87% of staff recommend it as a place for treatment and 71% recommended it as a place to work. After an inspection in August 2015 the trust was one of only three in England rated \\"outstanding\\" by the Care Quality Commission. It was rated as having the highest index of digital maturity of any organisation in the English NHS in April 2016.

Garotinho believes he was reborn as an evangelical Christian following a car crash in 1994.The hunger strike of Antony Garotinho, The Guardian, May 12, 2006 He is married to Rosinha Matheus and has nine children, of whom five are adopted. Early career A popular radio anchorman, fond of amateur theater, Garotinho entered politics through grassroots activism, joining the Brazilian Communist Party and helping to reorganize the sugar-cane workers' union in Campos.Paul Freston, ed. Evangelical Christianity and democracy in Latin America. Oxford University Press, 2008, , page 168 He entered electoral politics in 1982, presenting himself as candidate for a councilman seat in the same city on the Workers' Party ticket, failing to be elected because the party's list of candidates didn't achieve the necessary threshold of ballots to have a representation in the Municipal Chamber. Afterwards, he joined the Democratic Labour Party (PDT), being elected for the state legislature (1986) and winning the Campos mayoral elections in 1988. After his term as mayor of Campos (1989‚Äì1992), during which he took some measures to support small producers and to develop alternatives to sugar cane monoculture,Yves Faur√© & Lia Hasenclever, eds., Novos Rumos para a Economia Fluminense: Oprtunidades e Desafios para o Crescimento do Interior.

Rio de Janeiro, 7 Letras/FAPERJ, 2005, he was chosen by Governor Leonel Brizola as State Secretary of Agriculture (1993‚Äì1994), presenting himself as the PDT's candidate for governor in the 1994 elections, being defeated by Marcelo Alencar (PSDB). After being reelected for mayor in 1996, he was eventually elected Governor of Rio de Janeiro State in 1998, for the 1999‚Äì2002 term of office,Cf.

He won high approval ratings, but his time in office was also marked by serious corruption allegations. From what he presented as his miraculous conversion to Protestantism in 1994, Garotinho, although not himself a Pentecostalist - he is member of a Presbyterian Church - came to stand as a spearhead of the constantly growing involvement of the Pentecostalist Churches in Brazilian politics, as well as of their bid for the Federal Executive itself.Cesar Romero Jacob, Atlas da filia√ß√£o religiosa e indicadores sociais no Brasil, S√£o Paulo: Edi√ß√µes Loyola,2003, , p. 39. Given the notorious ties between Pentecostalism and the urban unorganized poor - for which a conversion to Pentecostalism tends to stand for a newly found sense of community as well as for an aspiration at upward social mobilityLe Monde Diplomatique, Brazilian Edition, April 2005, available at \\\\- one could say that Garotinho stood for the preferential social connections created by his political mentor Leonel Brizola, differing from him in that he gave such connections a more politically conservative hue, by means of a kind of Right- wing populism in what is seem by many as simply pandering for the bare needs of the poor by means of a shallow philanthropy reduced to the concrete minimum.Cf. Candido Mendes, Lula: a op√ß√£o mais que o voto. Rio de Janeiro: Garammond, 2003, ,page 249 Others, however, consider that, conversely, one could also say that Garotinho gave evangelical politics a leftist slant,John Anderson, ed. Religion, democracy and democratization. New York: Routledge, 2006, ,page 35 in that his evangelicism is the personal choice of a recent and enthusiastic convert, who therefore acknowledges the most destitute ones by means not only of offering munificence, but of a shared identity.Paul Freston, Evangelicals and Politics in Asia, Africa and Latin America.

Prior to his teaching and officiating career, he was a three-sport athlete at the University of Northern Colorado. Dreith developed a reputation of being a no-nonsense, tough-minded official on the field. During his thirty-year career, he officiated two Super Bowls, and received a playoff assignment for twenty-eight consecutive years. College Dreith is a 1950 graduate of the University of Northern Colorado in Greeley (then known as the Colorado State College of Education), where he played baseball, basketball, and football. He was a four-time all-conference selection in baseball and two-time in basketball, and later worked as a teacher for Denver Public Schools. Officiating career Dreith was hired by the new AFL in 1960 and moved to the NFL in , following the AFL‚ÄìNFL merger. He was the referee during Super Bowl VIII and Super Bowl XV and was assigned eight conference championship games. Dreith also was an alternate official in Super Bowl II; he wore uniform number 12, which is now worn by Greg Steed. In 1983 in his typical no-nonsense fashion, in a late season game between the Steelers and Browns, Dreith ejected Jack Lambert from the game for a late hit on Brian Sipe in what turned out to be Sipe's final NFL game. Dreith is also known among football fans for his unique explanation of a personal foul penalty during a game between the Buffalo Bills and the New York Jets. After the Jets' Marty Lyons (misidentified as Mark Gastineau during Dreith's call) tackled Bills quarterback Jim Kelly to the ground and started to repeatedly punch him in the head, Dreith announced to the crowd: \\"There's a personal foul, on number 99 (Lyons actually wore 93) of the defense ‚Äî after he tackled the quarterback, he's givin' him the business down there, that's a 15-yard penalty.\\" NFL officials aren't as bad as they seem by Dan Bickley, Arizona Republic, January 18, 2006 (Last accessed Nov. 26, 2007) Dreith's call also involved an improvised hand signal of a repeated punching action. Twenty-one years later, on November 24, 2007, during a game between University of Maryland and North Carolina State University, ACC referee Ron Cherry called a personal foul, saying, \\"He was giving him the business.\\" Cherry did not use Dreith's hand signal. David Letterman stated he wanted the previous sentence to be a topic for Know Your Current Events. =Age discrimination lawsuit= By , Dreith reached the age of 65 and the league asked him to move into the instant replay booth. He refused and was demoted to line judge. Dreith was fired after the season, thus prompting him to send a complaint to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).

In 1936, the T-antenna was replaced by a 165 metre tall mast, insulated against ground. In summer 1950, the antenna mast was shortened to 120 metres, because it was too long for the new frequency and would have a bad radiation diagram.

The song was composed by bassist Phil Lesh and lyricist Robert Hunter, and sung by Lesh. In later years, the song was a favorite and the crowd would shout \\"Let Phil sing!\\" to hear the song.Kindersley, Dorling et al (2003). Grateful Dead, the Illustrated Trip. p. 124. . The song * Key: G * Time signature: 4/4 (with an occasional 2/4 measure) * Chords used: A, Bm7/A, A4, D, Am, Em, C, G, Bm \\"Box of Rain\\" is a song that is drawn from American folk and country musical roots. This is true of many Grateful Dead tunes, and most of the songs on American Beauty and their other 1970 release Workingman's Dead. As the first song on American Beauty, it was also the first Grateful Dead song released on record to feature Phil Lesh as the lead vocalist.Kindersley, Dorling et al (2003). Grateful Dead, the Illustrated Trip. p. 121. . The song also featured two musicians who are not in the band. Dave Torbert played bass, while Lesh played acoustic guitar. David Nelson (of New Riders of the Purple Sage) plays the lead guitar with a Fender Telecaster, while Jerry Garcia plays the piano. While many describe Dave Nelson's Telecaster solo as being performed on a b-bender equipped guitar, the solo was recorded before he owned one, and was performed using traditional bending technique. Bob Weir sings harmony with Lesh. Lyrics According to lyricist Hunter, Lesh \\"wanted a song to sing to his dying father and had composed a piece complete with every vocal nuance but the words. If ever a lyric 'wrote itself,' this did ‚Äì as fast as the pen would pull.\\" Lesh practiced the song driving to the nursing home where his father lay with terminal cancer. According to an interview of Hunter by Steve Silberman, as asked by Silberman, \\"The song 'Box of Rain' began as a rough vocal outline from Phil Lesh. How does that process work?\\" Hunter replied, \\"Scat singing: Dum-dum dum, da-da-da- da, bump-dum-dum-dum-dum, dee-dee-dee. I'm able to translate people's scat. I hear English in it, almost as though I write down what I hear underneath that. I hear the intention. It's a talent like the Rubik's Cube, or something like that, and it comes easily to me. Which might be why I like language poetry. I can tell from the rhythms, or lack of rhythms, from the disjunctures and the end stoppages, what they're avoiding saying ‚Äì the meaning that they would like to not be stating there, comes rushing through to me. I understand dogs. I can talk to babies.\\" Many of the lyrics to this song are reminiscent of the song \\"Ripple\\", which opens the second side of the album. Images of water abound in both, as well as references to \\"broken\\" or \\"hand-me-down\\" thoughts. According to Hunter: \\"By 'box of rain,' I meant the world we live on, but 'ball' of rain didn't have the right ring to my ear, so box it became, and 'I don't know who put it there.'\\" The line \\"moth before a flame\\" echoes several proverbs, such as \\"the fate of the moth in the flame\\"‚ÄîAeschylus, Fragments (Fragment #288). The line \\"long long time to be gone and a short time to be there\\" echoes the old-time classic \\"Little Birdie\\", which includes the line \\"I've a short while to be here, and a long time to be gone.\\" In one of Carl Hiaasen's novels, the main character is in a shelter for children stranded by a hurricane, and in a particularly tender moment, sings \\"Box of Rain\\" to the child. Performance history \\"Box of Rain\\" debuted on September 17, 1970, at the Fillmore East in New York City during the acoustic portion of the show. That performance was (perhaps significantly given the song's emotional burden for Lesh) its sole appearance for nearly two years. The Grateful Dead reintroduced it during the fall of 1972 and played it on and off for the remainder of the year and 1973 before dropping it again. Between 1976 and 1985, Lesh seldom sang with the group (confining his contributions to harmony vocals on \\"Truckin'\\") due to vocal cord damage from improper singing. Over 750 concerts after its last performance, \\"Box of Rain\\" was permanently revived on March 20, 1986 at the Coliseum in Hampton, Virginia. After that, the song was frequently played in response to chants from the audience. Before the death of Jerry Garcia, \\"Box of Rain\\" was the last song ever performed live at a Grateful Dead concert, during the final encore at Soldier Field in Chicago on July 9, 1995. Symbolically, it was the first song played at the first Fare Thee Well show at Soldier Field on July 3, 2015, bringing fans full circle. Hunter recorded the song on his Jack O'Roses album (1980).

It is somewhat shorter than Franklin and the Green Knight and Franklin and the Turtle Lake Treasure. It has since aired on Nick Jr. In the United States, Canada's Family Channel and on Comcast Video on Demand. This movie was loosely based on the book Franklin and Harriet. Plot Franklin the Turtle, his little sister, Harriet (introduced in the previous film, Franklin and the Green Knight), and their parents, Mr. and Mrs. Turtle, plan to spend Christmas with their maternal grandparents (Mrs. Turtle's parents) at Faraway Farm, a farm far away from Woodland where Mrs. Turtle grew up. As the family gets ready to leave, they sing the first and third verses of Deck the Halls. Franklin immediately becomes annoyed with Harriet when she throws a snowball at him, causing him to drop a large pile of presents. Franklin's best friend Bear and his little sister Beatrice come to collect Franklin's pet goldfish, Goldie, and Franklin accidentally leaves his favorite stuffed toy dog Sam behind. Franklin thinks that Harriet dumped Sam in the snow on purpose, when in reality Beatrice had found Sam and Bear had failed to give it back to Franklin before they left. Franklin is still annoyed with Harriet when they get to Faraway Farm, and he becomes even more annoyed when he learns that he and Harriet will be sleeping in the same room. Later that evening, his grandmother, Jenny, tells a strange story from her childhood about a reindeer. This story involves a flashback showing young Jenny and her father (Mrs. Turtle's grandfather and Franklin and Harriet's great- grandfather). Jenny admits that she might have imagined things just as Mr. Turtle takes a family portrait, in which Franklin gives a sad look because he still misses Sam. Jenny then shows Franklin Sirius outside and sings Twinkle Twinkle Little Star to him before sending him to bed. The next day, as Franklin feeds the chickens, Jenny lets him in on a little surprise - she is fixing up an old sleigh for Grandfather Turtle. Franklin decides to help, and Jenny introduces him to her neighbors, the Collies, who collect the polish for the sleigh. That night, an ice storm strikes, causing a blackout, and while Franklin is checking the attic closet for candles, he comes across the bell from Jenny's story, revealing that she was not imagining the story after all. Franklin shows the bell to Jenny the next morning (Christmas Eve), and suggests that they use the bell for his grandfather's sleigh. Jenny has Harriet help with the sleigh, but Harriet spills the beans at lunch, much to Franklin's frustration, although fortunately, his grandfather does not overhear. Later, Mr. and Mrs. Turtle go to check on the Collies while Franklin and Harriet continue to work on the sleigh. Despite Franklin telling her not to do so, Harriet rings the bell, and just like in Jenny's story, a reindeer appears. Franklin runs to the house to tell Jenny. In the process, Franklin distracts Grandfather Turtle, who slips on a puddle of ice and breaks his leg. Back in the house, Jenny examines him and tells him to rest. Grandfather Turtle comforts Harriet when she cries and when Franklin says that he feels guilty, Grandfather Turtle tells him it was simply an accident. Jenny sends Franklin and Harriet to their room while she cares for Grandfather Turtle. Franklin decides to use the sleigh to go back to Woodland and find Bear and Beatrice's mother, Dr. Bear. He eventually discovers that Harriet has come along, hidden in the back. Rosie the horse, who is pulling the sleigh, is just as surprised as Franklin, and runs away, leaving the two young turtles stranded and lost in the woods. Back at the farm, Jenny finds a note that Franklin wrote saying that he is going back to Woodland to find Dr. Bear. Mr. and Mrs. Turtle soon return home from the Collies'; they discover what has happened and they and the grandparents become worried about Franklin and Harriett. Meanwhile, Franklin angrily scolds his sister for her disobedience, which causes her to break down. Franklin then comforts and apologizes to her. Harriett then reveals that she has the bell. With Franklin's approval, she rings it, and this time two reindeer come. One of them has the same exact bell as the one Franklin and Harriet have. Franklin realizes that the bell must belong to the other reindeer and that this is why he always comes whenever somebody rings it. With the bell back, the original reindeer creates a harness seemingly out of nowhere. With the help of the two reindeer, Franklin and Harriett soon arrive at the Bears' house and fetch Dr. Bear. Back at the farm, Jenny and Mr. and Mrs. Turtle decide to split up and try to find the children. Rosie returns to the farm and they all see Franklin, Harriet, and Dr. Bear arrive by sleigh. Dr. Bear gives Grandfather Turtle a cast for his leg and also returns Sam to Franklin, much to his delight. That night, Franklin and Harriet see Santa Claus and the reindeer out the window. The film ends with Franklin and Harriet wishing each other a merry Christmas.

It was a traditional mahinga kai (food-gathering place) for local MƒÅori. An easy walking track circles the lake, which is famous for its reflected views of Aoraki / Mount Cook and Mount Tasman. Geography 1960 aerial photo of Lake Matheson from the south Lake Matheson was formed in between two moraine terraces left by the rapid retreat of Fox Glacier / Te Moeka o Tuawe approximately 14,000 years ago, at the end of the last glacial period. The retreating glacier left behind a valley and a huge slab of ice insulated by a deep layer of moraine gravel, which gradually melted and collapsed to form the lake bed. The lake is now about from the current terminus of the glacier in the Southern Alps. Moraines, outwash gravels, and river gravels dammed the valley, and the lake grew, fed by small streams and seepage; there is no major river inflow or outflow. Lake Matheson is 30 ha in area, with an approximately 1.5 km shoreline and an average depth of 12 m. The streams that feed it pass through dense native bush, and often accumulate foam after heavy rains. They carry organic matter and tannins from the forest, which colour the water a dark brown ‚Äì this is the factor that limits visibility and enhances the mirroring effect from the lake. The lake water is acidic (the pH has been recorded as low as 5.5), low in nutrients, and sometimes almost de-oxygenated. These are all characteristics of a dystrophic brown-water lake that is accumulating organic matter; in the long run, the lake will gradually fill in and become a peat bog. History Te Ara Kairaumati was traditionally a mahinga kai (food-gathering place) for MƒÅori people travelling to the coast to collect pounamu. They would stop at the lake to catch longfin eels or water birds. The lake was named Lake Matheson by the first PƒÅkehƒÅ settlers on the Cook River flats after Murdoch Matheson, a cattle farmer in the area in the 1870s. Boating on Lake Matheson, 1965 Since the rise of a New Zealand tourism industry in the early 20th century, the lake has become a popular destination for its reflections of the Southern Alps. The view includes the peaks of Mount Haast, La Perouse, and New Zealand's highest peaks, Aoraki / Mount Cook and Mount Tasman. The reflections are most visible at dawn or dusk, and the best views are in the early morning of a calm clear day, before wind disturbs the water surface or clouds form on the peaks. From the 1950s an early-morning excursion to the lake was offered by the nearby Fox Glacier Hotel; visitors would be taken by bus to the present trailhead, and embark on a 15-minute walk through the bush, without the benefit of today's bridges and tracks. This led to a rowboat, in which they were taken out to Reflection Island to wait for the ripples to subside and the famous view to appear. The iconic view across the lake became a much-reproduced image, featured on chocolate boxes, beer bottles, calendars, and souvenirs. Lake Matheson is now one of New Zealand's most photographed lakes. =Postage stamps= 1946 \\"Peace and Tranquility\\" stampViews of Lake Matheson have featured as part of at least five New Zealand postage stamp issues: * An engraving of the view was used on a ¬Ωd stamp, entitled \\"Peace and Tranquility\\", in the 1946 New Zealand \\"Peace\\" issue, to commemorate the end of World War Two * A photograph of the view was used on the 45c stamp in the 1983 \\"Beautiful New Zealand\\" scenic stamp issue * One of the six different 40c self-adhesive definitive stamps issued in 1996 in dispenser boxes in coils of 100 stamps showed a photograph of Lake Matheson. The stamp was reissued in 1998 in booklet format, and again in 2000 in coil format. * A photographic view of the lake formed the background for a $3.50 miniature sheet issued by New Zealand Post in 2001 to commemorate the Philanippon '01 Japan World Stamp Exhibition * In 2012, another photograph of the lake was used on the $3.50 denomination of the scenic definitive issue, in both self-adhesive and gummed forms  Walk  Photo-opportunity at the start of the Lake Matheson walk The area around Lake Matheson is managed as part of Westland Tai Poutini National Park by the Department of Conservation (DOC), who maintain walking tracks and access to popular viewing lookouts around the lake. An easy 2.6 km walking track circles the lake, beginning and ending at the Matheson Cafe about 5 km from Fox Glacier township. The track crosses a suspension bridge over the Clearwater River, and leads to several viewing spots, notably at the far end of the lake the \\"View of Views\\" and Reflection Island. It takes about 1¬Ω hours return. The first 20 minutes of the walk, to the Jetty Viewpoint, is wheelchair-navigable and leads to a pontoon jetty that stretches out into the lake.

As part of a $3.9 million government plan to offset this closure, the facilities at Lake Matheson were improved, linking it to the township with a cycling/walking trail from Cook Flat. A neglected track leading from the eastern side of the Lake Matheson Walk to a circuit around Lake Gault, an 8 km return trip, was upgraded to Easy status.  Flora and fauna  The lake and its small catchment is are almost entirely surrounded by native podocarp forest. Around the edge of the lake the forest is mainly composed of Hall's t≈çtara (Podocarpus laetus), southern rƒÅtƒÅ (Metrosideros umbellata), kƒÅmahi (Weinmannia racemosa), and rimu (Dacrydium cupressinum). Other forest trees include miro (Prumnopitys ferruginea), broadleaf (Griselinia littoralis), kahikatea (Dacrycarpus dacrydioides), mountain horopito (Pseudowintera colorata), and pate (Schefflera digitata). At the point where the walkway climbs higher t≈çtara becomes less common and rimu and Quintinia serrata more common. The lake contains the rare aquatic plant stout water milfoil (Myriophyllum robustum). Wetlands bordering the lake contain flax (Phormium tenax) and spike sedge (Eleocharis acuta).

Biography Galen Fox was born in Hilo, Hawaii, raised in Honolulu, and educated at the University of Hawaii‚Äôs Laboratory School and at Punahou School. Fox received a B.A. magna cum laude from the University of Redlands, a Ph.D. in Public Affairs from Princeton University, and was an International Affairs Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, New York City. Fox was elected to Hawaii's State House in November 1996 as a representative of Hawaii's 23rd District, serving the Waikiki and Ala Moana district, and was re-elected in 2000, 2002, and 2004. He served as House Republican Leader and was also a member of the Finance, Labor and Transportation committee. Sex offense On December 18, 2004, Fox was aboard United Airlines Flight 56 from Honolulu to Los Angeles. During the flight, Fox was seated next to an Asian female passenger. The woman later told investigators with the FBI that she had taken dramamine because she wanted to rest and fell asleep holding a folded airline blanket on her lap, her arms crossed over her blanket. Fox testified during his trial that after he placed his arm on the arm rest, the sleeping woman did not move her own arm from the arm rest. Later, he pressed his leg against hers. Fox claimed that he believed that because the sleeping woman did not move away, she was \\"giving him a nonverbal clue that she was sexually interested.\\" Fox then proceeded to unbutton and unzip the sleeping woman's jeans and placed his hand on her crotch. The woman awoke to find Fox fondling her and quickly confronted him. According to court transcripts, Fox apologized for touching her, then pretended to go to sleep. The woman promptly alerted her parents who sat across the aisle from her and then notified flight attendants, who moved them to other seats. Police officers and FBI agents were waiting in Los Angeles when the flight arrived. Fox was arrested and, during an interview with Special Agent Rodney G. Fung of the FBI's Los Angeles International Airport Office, Fox denied rubbing the woman's crotch or unzipping her jeans. He admitted to reaching over to touch the woman, whom he described as an attractive Asian woman, and said that he should not have been touching her. According to Fung's affidavit, Fox \\"reiterated he was only reaching to touch her hand and could not explain why he wanted to touch her hand.\\" Fox was put on trial in the Central District of California on October 20, 2005. The trial was presided over by U.S. District Judge Margaret Nagle. During the trial, Fox admitted to Nagle that he had touched the woman's thigh and crotch during the flight. Fox also admitted that the woman did not react or make any sound when he was rubbing her thigh and her crotch area, and that she did not invite his conduct nor give him consent to touch her. According to court transcripts reported on by the Honolulu Star-Bulletin, Nagle asked if Fox intended to move his hand up along her thigh, for whatever purpose, and Fox answered, \\"yes.\\" Nagle then asked Fox: \\"And you did rub her crotch. That was an intentional act?\\" Fox's answer was again \\"yes.\\" Fox was found guilty of misdemeanor sexual battery and misdemeanor abusive sexual contact with another person without their consent. Despite his admission in court and conviction, Fox denied that he had done anything wrong. According to news reports published in the Hawaii Reporter, Fox insisted that he was innocent. Fox told reporters, \\"I vigorously fought the charges against me, which I hold to be untrue.\\" In addition, Fox told KITV he hoped his conviction would remain a secret so he could serve out his term in office. He also told KITV the same story he told the Hawaii Reporter: \\"In my heart I know I didn't do it.\\" Hawaii Reporter: Hawaii Reporter Fox submitted his resignation from the Hawaii state legislature on November 1, 2005. His resignation became effective on December 1, 2005. Sentencing On January 26, 2006, Fox appeared before Nagle for sentencing. According to the Hawaii Reporter, during the sentencing hearing, Fox stated that he had \\"hoped for romance with the young woman and had touched her leg and arm, taking her complete lack of response as consent.\\" Fox also told Nagle that he was innocent, stating \\"I cannot admit to something that I did not do.\\" During the court hearing, Nagle read parts of a letter from the victim. \\"Since that flight, I have had difficulty sleeping and I have been having nightmares of Galen Fox,\\" the victim wrote. \\"I brought this case because I had the right to sleep on a plane without being groped.\\" Fox was sentenced by Nagle to three months of house arrest, three years probation and a $2,500 fine. He was also ordered to register as a sex offender and to take a psychiatric examination or sex offender treatment.

It was first released on the Sega Saturn, followed shortly by versions for MS-DOS and the PlayStation. Later releases came for Mac OS (1999), Pocket PC (2002), N-Gage (2003), iOS (2013) and Android (2015). It is the debut entry in the Tomb Raider media franchise. The game follows archaeologist-adventurer Lara Croft, who is hired by businesswoman Jacqueline Natla to find an artefact called the Scion of Atlantis. Gameplay features Lara navigating levels split into multiple areas and room complexes while fighting enemies and solving puzzles to progress. The initial concept was created by Toby Gard, who is credited as Lara's creator and worked as lead artist on the project. Production began in 1994 and took 18 months, with a budget of ¬£440,000. The character of Lara was based on several influences, including Tank Girl and Indiana Jones. The 3D grid-based level design, innovative for its time, was inspired by the structure of Egyptian tombs. The music was composed by Nathan McCree, who took inspiration from English classical music. Originally announced in 1995, the title went on to receive extensive press attention and heavy promotion from Eidos Interactive. Reception of the game was very positive, with praise directed towards its innovative 3D graphics, controls, and gameplay, and it went on to win several industry awards. The game is one of the best-selling video games for the PlayStation, with seven million units sold worldwide, and it remained the best-selling title in the Tomb Raider franchise until the release of the 2013 reboot. Lara Croft herself became a cultural icon, rising to prominence as one of gaming's most recognisable characters. Following the game's success, numerous sequels were released, beginning with Tomb Raider II in 1997. A remake set in a new continuity, Tomb Raider: Anniversary, was developed by Crystal Dynamics and released in 2007. Gameplay Lara Croft retrieves the first piece of the Scion in the Tomb of Qualopec Tomb Raider is an action- adventure video game in which the player assumes the role of archaeologist- adventurer Lara Croft, who navigates through a series of ancient ruins and tombs in search of an ancient artefact. The game is split into four zones: Peru, Greece, Egypt and the lost continent of Atlantis. A training level set in Lara's home of Croft Manor can be accessed from the start menu. The game is presented in third person perspective. Lara is always visible, and the camera follows the action by focusing on Lara's shoulders by default, but the player can take manual control of the camera to get a better look at an area. The game automatically switches to a different camera view at key points, either to give the player a wider look at a new area or to add a cinematic effect. In the Sega Saturn and PlayStation versions, players save their progress in a level using Save Crystals, while in the PC versions the player can save at any point. If Lara is killed, the player must restart from a previous save. The object of Tomb Raider is to guide Lara through a series of tombs and other locations in search of treasures and artefacts. On the way, she must kill dangerous animals and creatures while collecting objects and solving puzzles. The emphasis lies on exploring, solving puzzles, and navigating Lara's surroundings to complete each level. Movement in the game is varied and allows for complex interactions with the environment. In addition to standard movement using tank controls, Lara can walk, jump over gaps, shimmey along ledges, roll, and swim through bodies of water. Certain button combinations allow Lara to either perform a handstand from a hanging position or execute a swandive. Lara has two basic stances: one with weapons drawn and one with her hands-free. When her weapons are drawn, she automatically locks on to any nearby targets. Locking onto nearby targets prevents her from performing other actions which require her hands, such as grabbing onto ledges to prevent falling. By default, she carries two pistols with infinite ammo. Additional weapons include a shotgun, dual magnums, and dual Uzis. A general action button is used to perform a wide range of movements, such as picking up items, pulling switches, firing guns, pushing or pulling blocks, and grabbing onto ledges. Items to pick up include ammo, small and large medi-packs, keys, and artefacts required to complete a stage. Any item that is collected is held onto in Lara's inventory until it is used. Throughout each stage, one or more secrets may be located. Discovering these secrets is optional, and when the player finds one a tune plays. The locations of these secrets vary in difficulty to reach. The player is usually rewarded with extra items. Synopsis Archaeologist-adventurer Lara Croft is approached by a mercenary named Larson, who is working for businesswoman Jacqueline Natla. Natla hires Lara to acquire the Scion, a mysterious artefact buried in the tomb of Qualopec within the mountains of Peru. After recovering the Scion from Qualopec's tomb, Lara is confronted by Larson, who reveals that she is holding a piece of the artefact and Natla has sent rival treasure hunter Pierre Dupont to retrieve the other pieces. Breaking into Natla's offices to find out Pierre's whereabouts, Lara discovers a medieval monk's prayer book, revealing that the Scion was divided between the three rulers of Atlantis and that the next piece is buried beneath an ancient monastery of St. Francis' Folly in Greece. Navigating the monastery, Lara finds the tomb of Atlantean ruler Tihocan, where she kills Pierre and recovers the second piece of the Scion. From a mural, she learns that Tihocan unsuccessfully tried to resurrect Atlantis after a catastrophe struck the original land. After joining both pieces of the Scion, Lara sees a vision that reveals the third and final piece of the Scion was hidden in Egypt after the third Atlantean ruler, a traitor who used the artefact to create a breed of monsters, was captured by Tihocan and Qualopec. Making her way through Egypt to the lost city of Khamoon, Lara kills Larson and recovers the third Scion piece. Emerging from the caves, Lara is ambushed by Natla and her three henchmen, who take the Scion. Lara escapes and stows away aboard Natla's yacht, which takes her to an island holding an Atlantean pyramid filled with monsters. After dispatching Natla's henchmen and making her way through the pyramid, Lara finds the Scion and sees the rest of the vision, revealing Natla to be the betrayer. Lara faces Natla, who reveals that she intends to use her army to push forward humanity's evolution, as she believes both Atlantis and current civilisation are too soft to withstand disaster. Lara decides to destroy the Scion, and Natla's attempt to stop her sends her into a crevasse. After fighting a large legless monster, Lara shoots the Scion, setting off a chain reaction that begins to destroy the pyramid. Lara kills a winged Natla and escapes the exploding island. Development Toby Gard at the 2005 Electronic Entertainment Expo. The initial concept for Tomb Raider was created by Toby Gard, who worked for Core Design, a game development studio based in Derby, England, that had established itself developing titles for home computers and Sega consoles. It was proposed by Gard to company head Jeremy Heath-Smith during a 1994 brainstorming session for game concepts for the upcoming PlayStation console. The entire staff approved, and Heath-Smith gave Gard permission to start the project once he finished work on BC Racers for the Sega CD. The game concept was created before anything else, with the main hooks being its cinematic presentation and being a 3D character-driven experience. The initial team was Gard and Paul Douglas who worked on design and pre-production for six months, before the team expanded to six people including programmers Gavin Rummery and Jason Gosling, and level designers/artists Neal Boyd and Heather Gibson. The team wanted to mix the adventuring style of Ultima Underworld and the 3D characters shown off in Virtua Fighter. The development budget for the game at the time was approximately ¬£440,000. The production atmosphere was fairly informal. Development began in 1994 and lasted eighteen months. The team endured excessive overtime and crunch during the last stages. During production, Core Design was sold to CentreGold, which in turn was purchased by Eidos Interactive in May 1996, who became publisher for the title. When Gard first presented the idea for the game, the concept art featured a male lead who strongly resembled Indiana Jones. Heath-Smith asked for a change for legal reasons. When Gard created the initial design document, he decided to give the player a choice of genders and created a female adventurer alongside the male character. Once he realized creating and animating two playable characters would require double the design work, he decided to slim back down to one. The female character, originally named Laura Cruz, was his favorite, so he discarded the male character before development work began. After Eidos became the game's publisher, they unsuccessfully lobbied for a selectable male lead. Speaking about his approach to the concept, Gard noted that he deliberately went against publisher trends when designing both the character and the gameplay. Laura went through several changes before the developers settled on the final version, including a name change to Lara Croft after Eidos executives in America objected to the original name. The inspirations for the character of Lara Croft included the character Tank Girl, the Indiana Jones series' titular lead, and the John Woo movie Hard Boiled. Lara's notably exaggerated physical proportions were a deliberate choice by Gard, as he wanted a caricatured personification of women who could be an action icon for the younger generation. Lara's movements were hand-animated and coordinated rather than created using motion capture. The reason for this was that the team wanted uniformity in her movement, which was not possible with motion capture technology of the time. From the game's earliest stages, the team wanted the title to involve tombs and pyramids. In the early story draft, Lara would be confronted by a rival group called the \\"Chaos Raiders\\". During the Greece levels, Lara and Pierre were to have been less hostile rivals, helping each other with puzzles in the first level. Larson evolved from an Afrikaans character called Lars Kruger, who shared a similar role in the original plot. The script itself was written by Vicky Arnold, who joined in 1995 and would work on later Tomb Raider titles. Gard and Douglas created the basic story draft alongside the initial game design, then Arnold turned it into a script after joining the project. It was Arnold's job to write the dialogue, and create a cohesive narrative around the locations selected by the team members. While Lara's character design and Gard's initial concept were present, much of the additional detail was worked out by Arnold. The team kept the project deliberately simple and comparatively modest in scope. The platforming design drew extensively from Prince of Persia, with the Doppelg√§nger enemy during the Atlantis section being an homage to the Shadow Prince from that game. The high number of animal enemies was meant to ground players in the world before the more fantastical elements appeared, in addition to being easier to animate and program than human enemies. The staff were also uncomfortable with Lara killing that many humans. The initial concept gave combat prominence, but as production began the focus shifted to platforming and puzzle-solving. A plan that made it into the final product was using enemy placement to shift the atmosphere from pure action-adventure to a horror-like tone. The team consciously set the story in real archaeological locations representing several cultures. Boyd and Gibson immersed themselves in literature and history about each culture for the first three areas, respectively inspired by the Inca Empire, Classical Greece and Ancient Egypt. The Greece levels were put in after planned levels in Angkor Wat, Cambodia were dropped. The Croft Manor training level was built by Gard over a weekend. Its design was based on pictures of Georgian manor houses taken from an unspecified reference book. =Design and platforms= The title was developed for Sega Saturn, MS-DOS personal computers (PC), and PlayStation, with all three versions in development simultaneously. Gosling led programming for the Saturn version. Douglas described the game code for each title as identical, with an additional layer of specific coding to tailor the game for each platform. While Sony Europe approved the game early on, making Tomb Raider one of the earliest approved third-party products for the PlayStation, Sony America initially rejected the game's concept and asked for more and better content. Douglas blamed the response on Core Design submitting Tomb Raider too early in production. In response the development team made several changes to the game design documentation and produced a version on Sony hardware which would lead to worldwide approval by Sony. For the Saturn version, Sega negotiated a timed exclusivity deal in Europe, causing the Saturn version to release in that region ahead of other versions. Core Design and Sega made the deal during the last few months of development, so the team had to finish up the Saturn version six weeks earlier than they had planned, forcing them to work even longer hours. Following the release of the Saturn version, a number of bugs were discovered that affected all versions of the game; because of the timed exclusivity, the development team fixed these bugs for the PlayStation and PC versions. Two notable surviving bugs in all versions were the \\"corner bug\\", which allowed players to scale architecture by jumping repeatedly against a corner; and a bug which caused the game to not recognise the collection of a secret in the final level. In 1997 Core Design opened negotiations with Nintendo to release a Nintendo 64 version of the game and started work on the port in anticipation of the negotiations being successful. The planning took place between 1996 and 1997, with Douglas wanting to redesign the game mechanics to incorporate the platform's analogue stick controls. The team never received Nintendo 64 development kits, and the port was scrapped when Sony finalised a deal to keep subsequent Tomb Raider games exclusive to PlayStation until the year 2000. A third-person 3D action-adventure like Tomb Raider was unprecedented at the time, and the development team took several months to find a way to make Gard's vision for the game work on the hardware of the time, in particular getting the player character to interact with freeform environments. Tomb Raider used a custom-built game engine, as did many games of the era. The engine was designed and built by Douglas with assistance from Rummery. Rummery created the level editor, which allowed for \\"seamless\\" creation of levels. According to Rummery, the decision to build the game levels on a grid was the key breakthrough in making the game possible. It is Core Design's contention that, prior to the development of Tomb Raider, they were \\"struggling somewhat\\" with 32-bit development. The level editor program was designed so that developers could make rapid adjustments to specific areas with ease. Another noted aspect was the multi-layered levels, as compared to equivalent 3D action-adventure games of the time which were mostly limited to a flat-floor system with little verticality. The interlinking room design was inspired by Egyptian multi-roomed tombs, particularly the tomb of Tutankhamun. The grid-based pattern was a necessity due to the d-pad-based tank controls and the Saturn's quad polygon-based rendering technology. Levels were first designed using a wireframe construction, with each area at this stage having only links to other areas of a level and walls. The team then added architecture and gameplay elements like traps and enemies, then implemented the different lighting values. Due to time and technical limitations, planned outdoor areas had to be cut. The choice of a third-person perspective was influenced by the team's opinion that the game type was under-represented when compared to first-person shooters such as Doom. The third-person view meant multiple elements were difficult to implement, including the character and camera control. The camera had four pre-set angles, which seamlessly switched depending on the character's position and the level progress. For standard navigation and combat, the camera was fixed on a particular point and oriented around Lara while focusing on that object. Lara's twin pistol set-up was in place from the early prototypes. The aiming system was designed so that each gun arm had an aiming axis, with a shared \\"sweetspot\\" where both guns fired at the same target. For underwater environments, the effects were created using gouraud shading to create real-time ripple and lighting effects. =Audio= Nathan McCree (pictured 2014) acted as the composer for Tomb Raider, creating its iconic four-note main theme. The music for Tomb Raider was composed by Nathan McCree, who at the time was an in-house composer for Core Design. The main inspiration behind the score for McCree was English Classical music. This approach was directly influenced by his conversations with Gard about Lara's character. Based on this, he kept the main theme simple and melodic. The main theme used a four-note motif, which continues to appear through the series. The piece \\"Where The Depths Unfold\\", used when Lara is swimming underwater, was a choral work. They did not have the space or budget for live music recording, which was challenging for McCree as he needed to create the whole thing using synthesisers. To make the choir sound realistic, he inserted recordings of himself breathing at the right points so it sounded like an actual choir. For each track, McCree got a basic description of where the music would be used, then was left to create it. There was no time for rewrites, so each track was included in the game as first composed. Unlike most other games of the time, there was not a musical track playing constantly throughout the game; instead, limited musical cues would play only during specially-selected moments to produce a dramatic effect. For the majority of the game, the only audio heard is action-based effects, atmospheric sounds, and Lara's own grunts and sighs, all of which were enhanced because they did not have to compete with music. According to McCree, the game was scored this way because he was allotted very little time for the job, forcing him to quickly write pieces without any thought to where they would go in the game. When the soundtrack was finally applied, the developers found that the tunes worked best when applied to specific places. The symphonic sounds were created using Roland Corporation's Orchestral Expansion board for their JV series keyboards. English voice actress Shelley Blond provided the voice of Lara. She was given the job after her agent called and had her record some audition lines onto tape. She felt under a lot of pressure at the time, as Core Design had spent three months searching for the right voice. She recalled, \\"I was asked to perform her voice in a very plain non-emotive manner and in a 'female Bond' type of way. I would have added more inflection, tone and emotion to my voice but they wanted to keep it how they felt it should sound, which was quite right. My job was to bring their character to life.\\" According to Blond, she spent four to five hours recording the voice for Lara including the grunts, cries and other effort and death sounds.\`A different account attributes these sounds to Gibson, Core Design's PR Manager Suzie Hamilton, and sound designer Martin Iveson whose voice pitch was made higher. Blond would not return for any subsequent entries. In a 2011 interview she stated that her departure was due to disagreeing with \\"some things\\" within Core Design and Eidos. However, in a 2016 retrospective interview she said that she was asked to reprise her role but had to decline due to other commitments. She gave permission for her effort voice work to be reused while the character's dialogue would be voiced by Judith Gibbins. Release and versions Tomb Raider was first confirmed in 1995, although details were kept scarce by the developers. There was little attention from the press until a demo was run at the 1996 Electronic Entertainment Expo, causing the press and public to pay more attention. There was a huge amount of publicity, much of which did not involve the Core Design team at all, which prompted mixed feelings. While the scale of the game's eventual popularity was not in the team's minds, its strong reception at gaming events hinted that it would be a success. To help promote the game, Eidos hired models to portray Lara Croft at trade events. They first hired Natalie Cook, but apparently due to her unsuitability with Eidos's cross-media plans for the character, she was replaced with Rhona Mitra in 1997. Mitra served as Lara's model until 1998. The game first released for Saturn in Europe on 25 October 1996. In North America, the Saturn, PlayStation and MS- DOS versions released simultaneously on 14 November. In Europe, the PlayStation and MS-DOS versions released on 22 November. Future PC patches allowed the game to work on Windows 95. The PC version was released on Steam on 29 November 2012. The PlayStation and Saturn versions were also published in Japan in 1997 by Victor Interactive Software under the name Tomb Raiders. The Saturn version released on 14 January, while the PlayStation version released on 14 February. The PlayStation version was re-released for the PlayStation Network in North America in August 2009, and in Europe in August 2010. An attempt was made by Realtech VR to remaster the first three Tomb Raider titles for Windows, but due to not having asked permission from then- franchise owner Square Enix first, the project was cancelled. In 1997, four new levels were released in an expansion pack for the Windows version, known under the title Tomb Raider: Unfinished Business. The expansion pack also came with promotional materials for the game's sequel Tomb Raider II. In 1998, the levels were made available as downloadable content for the Windows release, and a budget version was released on 20 March 1998 containing both the original game and the additional levels under the title Tomb Raider Gold. The two new areas were dubbed \\"Unfinished Business\\", set within the ruins of the Atlantean pyramid; and \\"Shadow of the Cat\\", which saw Lara exploring a temple in Egypt dedicated to the goddess Bastet. \\"Unfinished Business\\" was intended as an alternate, more difficult finale to the game featuring more mutant enemies and a focus on complex platforming. The concept for \\"Shadow of the Cat\\" was born from a cat statue used in the Khamoon level, with the levels being themed after a cat's nine lives. Due to licensing issues, several later re-releases excluded the Gold content. The game was released for Mac OS on 16 March 1999. It was ported to the platform by Aspyr and based on Tomb Raider Gold. A port to the Pocket PC was published by Handango in July 2002. It released on the N-Gage in October 2003. Both ports were developed by Ideaworks3D. Tomb Raider was ported to iOS devices, developed and published by Square Enix. The port was released on 17 December 2013, and includes the additional levels of the Gold release. This version released on Android devices on 1 April 2015. =Nude Raider= An infamous part of Tomb Raiders history is a fan-made software patch dubbed Nude Raider. The patch, when added to an existing PC copy of a Tomb Raider game, caused Lara to appear naked. Contrary to rumour, there is no nude code in any console version of the game. During the original game's production, a suggestive cheat code was suggested to Gard and Douglas, but they strongly vetoed it. In 1999, Core Design considered taking legal action against websites that hosted nude pictures of Lara Croft, stating that \\"we have a large number of young fans and we don't want them stumbling across the pictures when they do a general search for Tomb Raider\\". In April 2004, it was falsely alleged that an insider from Eidos reported to a Tomb Raider electronic mailing list that Eidos had begun suing players using the Nude Raider patches. Eidos sent cease and desist letters to the owners of the \\"nuderaider.com\\" URL that hosted the patch to enforce its copyright of Tomb Raider. Sites depicting nude images of Lara Croft have been sent cease and desist notices and shut down, and Eidos Interactive was awarded the rights to the Nude Raider domain name. As a response to the controversy, Core Design included a secret code in the sequel; allegedly a similar nude code, it in fact blew Lara up. Reception Upon its release in 1996, the game was widely praised by video game magazines for its variety and depth of control, revolutionary graphics, intriguing environments, and use of occasional combat to maintain an atmosphere of tension. Ryan MacDonald of GameSpot summarised, \\"Take the puzzle solving of Resident Evil, the gory action of Loaded, and the 360-degree freedom most gamers only dream of, and you have Tomb Raider, the closest thing to a Super Mario 64 killer' to date.\\" The game tied with the Saturn version of Street Fighter Alpha 2 for Electronic Gaming Monthlys \\"Game of the Month\\", with their review team saying it stood out from other titles and was the PlayStation's best release at the time. Next Generation called it \\"a thought-provoking, riveting action-adventure easily on par in intensity with any of Hollywood's finest efforts\\", citing it as a landmark title and potential trend setter for that console generation. Some critics rated the PlayStation version better than the Saturn version. MacDonald wrote that its graphics were sharper and GamePro scored it half a point higher than the Saturn version in every category despite noting the former's \\"solid showing\\". However, Next Generation stated that it would not bother to review the PlayStation version because the differences between it and the Saturn version were negligible. Similarly, Electronic Gaming Monthly only reviewed the PlayStation version, and stated in a feature on the game that both versions were playable and enjoyable, while also having identical graphics. A retrospective analysis of the game by Digital Foundary referred to the Saturn version as the least enjoyable versions due to lower frame rate and poorer audio compared to other versions. Next Generation reviewed the PC version of Tomb Raider Gold, rated it three stars out of five, and stated that it was a suitable purchase for series newcomers, with old players being more likely to download the levels from the game website. Tomb Raider was Computer Games Strategy Pluss 1996 overall game of the year and won the magazine's award for the year's best \\"3D Action\\" game as well. It was a finalist for CNET Gamecenter's 1996 \\"Best Action Game\\" award, which went to Quake. Electronic Gaming Monthly named Tomb Raider a runner-up for both \\"PlayStation Game of the Year\\" (behind Tekken 2) and \\"Saturn Game of the Year\\" (behind Dragon Force), commenting that both versions had been designed to take optimum advantage of each console's capabilities. They named it runner-up for both \\"Action Game of the Year\\" (behind Die Hard Trilogy) and \\"Adventure Game of the Year\\" (behind Super Mario 64), as well as \\"Game of the Year\\" (again behind Super Mario 64). It won \\"Best Animation\\" in the 1996 Spotlight Awards. Less than a year after its release, Electronic Gaming Monthly ranked the PlayStation version of Tomb Raider the 54th-best console video game of all time, particularly citing its vast and compelling areas to explore. In 1998, PC Gamer declared it the 47th- best computer game released, and the editors called it \\"tremendous fun to play and a legitimate piece of post-modern gaming history\\". In 2001 Game Informer ranked it the 86th-best game ever made. They praised it for Lara's appeal to gamers and non-gamers alike. =Sales and accolades= At release, Tomb Raider topped the British charts a record three times, and contributed substantially to the success of the PlayStation. In the previous year, Eidos Interactive had recorded a nearly $2.6 million pre-tax loss. The success of the game turned this loss into a $14.5 million profit in a year. As one of the top-selling games of the PlayStation console, it was one of the first to be released on PlayStation's 'Platinum' series, and its success made Tomb Raider II the most anticipated game of 1997. In August 1998, the game's computer version received a \\"Platinum\\" sales award from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD), while its PlayStation release took \\"Gold\\". These prizes indicate sales of 200,000 and 100,000 units, respectively, across Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. During the first three months of 1997, Tomb Raider was the ninth-best-selling console game in the United States, with sales of 143,000 units. This made it the country's highest-selling PlayStation title for the period. Tomb Raider sold over 7 million copies worldwide. Tomb Raider, along with its successor, Tomb Raider II, were the two best-selling games in the franchise prior to the 2013 reboot. In 1999, Next Generation listed Tomb Raider as number 22 on its \\"Top 50 Games of All Time\\", commenting that, \\"Fantastic level design and art direction enabled a real feeling of exploration and accomplishment. When you played Tomb Raider, you felt like a tomb raider.\\" In 2001, GameSpot listed Tomb Raider on its \\"15 Most Influential Games of All Time\\", saying it served as a template for many 3D action- adventure games that would follow and helped drive the market for 3D accelerator cards for PCs. In 2004, the Official UK PlayStation Magazine chose Tomb Raider as the fourth-best game of all time. It won a multitude of Game of the Year awards from leading industry publications. In 1998, Tomb Raider won the Origins Award for Best Action Computer Game of 1997. In 1999, Toby Gard and Paul Douglas won the Berners-Lee Interactive BAFTA Award for best contribution to the industry for their work creating the franchise. Legacy The sequel to the game, Tomb Raider II, was in the concept stage as production of Tomb Raider was wrapping up. Under pressure from Eidos Interactive, Core Design would develop a new Tomb Raider annually between 1997 and 2000, putting considerable strain on the team. Their struggles culminated in the troubled development of Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness for PlayStation 2. Releasing to poor critical reception and lackluster sales, Eidos Interactive transferred the franchise to another development studio they owned, Crystal Dynamics, who would reboot the series in 2006 with Tomb Raider: Legend. Following the release of Tomb Raider, Lara Croft herself became a gaming icon, seeing unprecedented media cross promotion. These included commercials for cars and foodstuffs, an appearance on the cover of The Face, and requests for sponsorship from outside companies. The level of sophistication Tomb Raider reached by combining state-of-the-art graphics, an atmospheric soundtrack, and a cinematic approach to gameplay was at the time unprecedented. While Gard enjoyed working at Core Design, he wished to have greater creative control, and disliked Eidos's treatment of Lara Croft in promotional material, which focused on her sexuality at the expense of her in-game characterisation. Gard and Douglas left Core Design in 1997 to found their own studio, Confounding Factor. This prompted mixed feelings from remaining Core Design staff, who were already at work on the next title in the series. Speaking in 2004, Gard said he would have liked to produce a sequel, but noted that Lara had changed from his original concepts for her, leaving him unsure of how he would handle her. Gard would eventually return to the franchise with Tomb Raider: Legend. After the release of Legend, Crystal Dynamics created a remake of Tomb Raider using the Legend engine and continuity. Gard acted as one of the story designers, fleshing out both the main narrative and Lara's characterisation. The remake was co-developed by Crystal Dynamics and Buzz Monkey Software. Titled Tomb Raider: Anniversary, the game released worldwide in 2007 for PlayStation 2, Windows, PlayStation Portable, Xbox 360 and Wii.

Tjilbruke (also Tjirbruki, Tjilbruki) is an important creation ancestor for the Kaurna people of the Adelaide plains in the Australian state of South Australia. The lore tells of a time when all the people lived in accord with peaceful trading laws which governed all the people's lives. The law was brought to the land, and \\"Old Tjirbruki\\", who lived as an ordinary man, a keeper of the law which came from the south, after the water covered the land. Tjilbruke's dearly loved nephew was killed, for breaking the law and killing a female emu; Tjilbruke came and carried the body of his nephew down the east coast of Gulf St Vincent, after his nephew was killed while hunting. This songline pre-dates European contact, and is part of the oral history of Aboriginal Australians. The path Tjilbruke took along the coast is today known the Tjirbruki Dreaming Tracks. The site at Warriparinga (\\"windy place by the river\\") is the Gateway of Tjilbruke Dreaming. This site is situated at Bedford Park within the grounds of Warriparinga Wetland and Sturt River, a ceremonial camp site for Kaurna. In 2001 a federal government-funded reconciliation project in partnership with the City of Marion and the Kaurna community (Dixon and Williams clans) built a visitor and education centre for Indigenous and non- Indigenous people to come together and reconcile their differences in the now metropolitan suburb of Marion, South Australia. The Tjilbruke dreaming story cover 4 councils following the southern Adelaide coastline through to Rapid Bay and Cape Jervis. The trail is marked by the tears of Tjilbruke, which created the natural springs, and is marked by commemorative plaques erected during the 150th anniversary of British colonisation of South Australia. They can be found along the coast, and in close proximity to the sea shore, starting at Kingston Park and continuing south along the coast to Rapid Bay. The story of Tjilbruke tells that at sunset every night of his journey Tjilbruke would cry over his nephew's body and his tears became a spring.

A technical, persistent and effective winger, he shot to fame when his frontline partnership with Gheorghe Hagi and Florin RƒÉducioiu led the Romania national team to the 1994 FIFA World Cup quarterfinal, eliminating Argentina en route, in a match in which he scored two of Romania's three goals. Club career Born in Bucharest, Dumitrescu joined the Steaua Bucure≈üti Academy in 1977 at the age of 8 and made his way through the youth system. In April 1987, he made his debut in Liga I at the age of 18. Steaua, who had won the European Champions Cup the previous year, loaned Dumitrescu to FC Olt to gain more experience. At FC Olt Dumitrescu was a regular starter, playing as left full-back. Returning from his loan, Dumitrescu became an important part of the Steaua Bucure≈üti squad, playing alongside big names such as Marius LƒÉcƒÉtu≈ü and Gheorghe Hagi. After the 1990 World Cup in Italy, the best of his club teammates got contracts abroad, but Dumitrescu remained with Steaua and became the side's captain. With Steaua, he won the Romanian Cup in 1992, the championship in 1993 and played in the quarterfinals of the Cup Winners' Cup the same year. Impressed by his performance at the USA World Cup in 1994, the representatives of Tottenham Hotspur were keen to offer him a contract. The North London side paid ¬£2.6 million for Dumitrescu. He was later loaned out to Sevilla FC, with the La Liga side given an option to buy him during the loan. Dumitrescu had a good time in Southern Spain but the club baulked at the transfer fee Tottenham demanded. Dumitrescu returned to England. After playing in the first half of the 1995‚Äì96 Premiership season and failing to impress, Dumitrescu was sold to West Ham United, where Harry Redknapp wanted to make him the player he once was. Dumitrescu played only 10 games before encountering problems with his work permit. His contract with West Ham was broken, leaving him free agent. In the summer of 1996 he signed a contract with Club Am√©rica in Mexico and before switching to their rivals Atlante F.C. a year later. After two years in Mexico, Dumitrescu returned to Steaua Bucure≈üti in 1998. Halfway through the season he announced his retirement as a professional player aged only 29. International career In 1989, Ilie Dumitrescu made his debut for Romania, being used as a substitute in a game against Greece. Dumitrescu was part of the Romanian squad at the 1990 FIFA World Cup. At the 1994 World Cup Dumitrescu played all the five games his team played in America. He was a key player in Romania's surprise 3-2 victory over previous runners-up Argentina, scoring the first two goals and assisting the third. His first goal came in the 11th minute and came direct via an eye-catching free kick from a wide position. Argentina equalized almost instantly from a penalty but Romania regained the lead minutes later through a well-worked passing move that enabled Dumitrescu to score from close range. The victory enabled Romania to progress to the quarter-finals; a first for the Romanian national team. Career as coach Following a short-lived career as a player agent ‚Äì he had established a company called \\"Sport & Business World\\" in 1998 ‚Äì, Dumitrescu took on his first position as a manager in 2000 signing with O≈£elul Gala≈£i from Romania's Divizia A. From Gala≈£i he moved to FC Bra≈üov and then Cypriot side Alki Larnaca in 2001‚Äì02. Here he won promotion to the Cypriot First Division and his team started the season very well, beating some of the best sides in Cyprus. However at the end of the season his team finished 11th. He then took the head coach role of the Romanian Under 21 side. But Dumitrescu lasted only 6 weeks in the role. Subsequently, he took control of FCM BacƒÉu in Divizia A. However, after a disappointing season, Dumitrescu resigned in May 2003, leaving FCM BacƒÉu in the relegation zone. Dumitrescu again went to Cyprus, this time as a coach for Apollon Limassol. By playing the Italian defensive system catenaccio, they won 12 of their first 13 matches and Dumitrescu was named the best manager in Cyprus for the year 2004. Dumitrescu soon moved on to his 6th club side, being named manager of the Greek side AEK Athens FC in February 2004. His roving managerial career continued as he left AEK to join Egaleo, also from the Greek Super League. The next three years found him at three other Greek clubs: Akratitos, Kallithea and PAOK. Dumitrescu was criticised for his style of play by PAOK fans. Having joined the club in February, he resigned in October. After three years without a club he became manager of Panthrakikos in May 2009, but was sacked after only one game. He ended his coaching career at the same team he ended his playing career, FC Steaua. He had spent only 40 days there, and resigned saying that he does not want to stay where he is not wanted. After that, he no longer took any coaching jobs, and focused on running his business, a high-class restaurant in the center of Bucharest, in which he had invested some of the money earned in his sports career, has been a regular guest commentator for television stations covering football matches, and endorsed a sports bets company.

He played for the San Francisco Giants, Philadelphia Phillies, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Los Angeles Dodgers. In his major league career (2005‚Äì2010), he won 10 games and struck out 160 batters in 189 innings. High School and College Taschner attended William Horlick High School in Racine, Wisconsin. Where he was selected in the 37th round by the then California Angels. After graduating, he chose not to sign and went on to the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìOshkosh, where he posted a 7‚Äì0 record in nine games (eight starts) and a 1.53 earned run average (ERA) during the 1999 season. He struck out 79 batters in his senior season while walking only 41. Taschner was drafted again, this time by the San Francisco Giants in the second round of the 1999 Major League Baseball draft. Professional career =San Francisco Giants= Taschner was drafted again, this time by the San Francisco Giants in the second round of the 1999 Major League Baseball draft. The Giants assigned him to their short season A-level minor league affiliate, the Salem-Keizer Volcanoes of the Northwest League. Taschner earned a 3-2 record in the latter half of 1999, striking out 36 batters in 29 innings. He injured his shoulder in his last outing for Salem-Keizer. After surgery he sat out all but one month of the 2000 season for the San Jose Giants. He returned to San Jose in 2001 where he pitched 2 1/2 months making the California league all-star team. Unable to pitch in the game or the rest of the season he had surgery again, this time on his left elbow. Between the two years, Taschner posted a 6-6 record in 24 games (16 starts), striking out 94 batters in two years while pitching a total of 88 innings. However, he hit another setback in 2002, as he missed the entire season recovering from Tommy John surgery. The road to recovery was not easy for Taschner, as his record with the Norwich Navigators in 2003 was 0-6; he posted an ERA of 5.68, the highest of his minor league career to date, striking out only 46 batters and allowing 48 earned runs. Taschner's 3-1 record with Norwich in 2004 was enough to earn him a promotion to the AAA Fresno Grizzlies, where he had a 4-7 record. Taschner remained at Fresno to begin the 2005 season, but he began to work exclusively as a relief pitcher and regained the form of his early career, posting a 3-0 record and a 1.64 ERA before being called up to the major leagues for the first time. Taschner was first called up to the Giants on June 12, 2005. In his first season, he made 24 appearances as a reliever, notching a 2-0 record with 19 strikeouts and a 1.59 ERA. Taschner earned his first major league win on August 30 against the Colorado Rockies when the Giants rallied for a comeback win in the ninth inning. In 2006, he made the Opening Day roster, but was sent back to the minor leagues after posting a 34.71 ERA in 2‚Öì innings; he posted a 6-7 record with Fresno and struck out 68 batters in 49‚Öì innings. He spent more time with the Giants throughout the season as well, making 24 appearances and posting no wins with an 8.38 ERA in the major leagues. Taschner's first full season in the major leagues saw him rank third on the team in appearances. He pitched 50 innings out of the Giants' bullpen, striking out 51 batters in 63 games. He allowed a .235 opponents' batting average, which was lowest among all qualifying relievers. He also allowed only 19 hits to right-handed batters over the entire season, qualifying him as a left-handed specialist. Taschner's 2008 season yielded a strong performance, in which he allowed only 26 earned runs in 48 innings; he struck out 39 batters while walking 24. =Philadelphia Phillies= On March 27, 2009, Taschner was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies for catcher Ronny Paulino. He appeared in 24 games with the Phillies, with a 1-1 record and 4.91 ERA. In November 2009 Taschner was granted free agency after being outrighted to Triple-A.Francisco to play left, hit seventh =Pittsburgh Pirates= On December 23, 2009, Taschner signed a minor league contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates with an invitation to spring training.http://pittsburgh.pirates.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20091223&content;_id=7848732&vkey;=news_pit&fext;=.jsp&c;_id=pit On June 9, 2010, he was designated for assignment after having a 6.05 ERA in 17 appearances, with 19.1 innings, 17 strikeouts, eight walks, and one win. On June 19, 2010, Taschner declared free agency after refusing an outright assignment to the minors. =Los Angeles Dodgers= On June 27, 2010, he signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers and was assigned to the AAA Albuquerque Isotopes. He was promoted to the Dodgers on July 21. He only retired one batter while with the Dodgers. Taschner is a left-handed baseball pitcher. He appeared in just three games for the Dodgers before being designated for assignment on July 29. He elected to declare free agency instead of accepting a minor league assignment. Community Taschner is active in the San Francisco community with a variety of charities. He has worked with both the Shriner's Hospital and Habitat for Humanity during his tenure with the Giants. He has also instructed at a baseball skills clinic for children participating in the Special Olympics. Post-Baseball Career After his playing career ended, he chose to become a police officer in his home town of Appleton, Wisconsin in 2011. Him and his wife decided to raise their family in the Appleton area while he was still playing professional ball. In 2015, he became commissioner of his son's 7-8 year old league. He became the head coach at Neenah High School in July 2018 after being an assistant coach.

It is the most significant visual arts museum in the Australian state of South Australia. It has a collection of almost 45,000 works of art, making it the second largest state art collection in Australia (after the National Gallery of Victoria). As part of North Terrace cultural precinct, the Gallery is flanked by the South Australian Museum to the west and the University of Adelaide to the east. As well as its permanent collection, which is especially renowned for its collection of Australian art, AGSA hosts the annual Festival of Contemporary Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art known as Tarnanthi, displays a number of visiting exhibitions each year and also contributes travelling exhibitions to regional galleries. European (including British), Asian and North American art are also well represented in its collections. History =Establishment= The South Australian Society of Arts, established in 1856 and oldest fine arts society still in existence, held Annual exhibitions in South Australian Institute rooms and advocated for a public art collection. In 1880 Parliament gave ¬£2,000 to the institute to start acquiring a collection and the National Gallery of South Australia was established in June 1881. It was opened in two rooms of the public library (now the Mortlock Wing of the State Library), by Prince Albert Victor and Prince George. Most works on display were acquired through a government grant. In 1897, Sir Thomas Elder bequeathed ¬£25,000 to the art gallery for the purchase of artworks. =Buildings= In 1889 the gallery moved further east to the Jubilee Exhibition Building, and then to its present site in 1900, in a specially designed building (now the Elder Wing) designed by architect Owen Smythe and built in Classical Revival style by Messrs Tudgeon. Originally built with an enclosed portico, a 1936 refurbishment and enlargement included a new facade with an open Doric portico. Major extensions in 1962 (including a three-storey air-conditioned addition on the northern side), 1979 (general refurbishment, in time for its centenary in 1981) and 1996 (large expansion) increased the gallery's display, administrative and ancillary facilities further.Barbara Cooper and Maureen Matheson, The World Museums Guide, McGraw-Hill, (1973) The building is listed in the South Australian Heritage Register. , the building houses 64kWh worth of battery storage as part of the Government of South Australia Storage Demonstration project, powered by three 7.5 kW Selectronic inverters. This reduces the consumption of power from the state grid. =Governance= In 1939, an act of parliament, the 1939 number 44 Libraries and Institutes Act, repealed the Public library, Museum and Art Gallery and Institutes Act and separated the Gallery from the Public Library (now the State Library), and Museum, established its own board and changed its name to the Art Gallery of South Australia. The Art Gallery Act 1939 was passed to provide for the control of the library. This has been amended several times since. In 1967 the National Gallery of South Australia changed its name to the Art Gallery of South Australia. From about 1996 until late 2018 Arts SA (later Arts South Australia) had responsibility for this and several other statutory bodies such as the Museum and the State Library, after which the functions were transferred to direct oversight by the Department of the Premier and Cabinet, Arts and Culture section. Collection AGSA director Nick Mitzevich addressing Museums Australia conference delegates, 2012 , the AGSA collection comprises almost 45,000 works of art. Of the state galleries, only the National Gallery of Victoria is larger. It attracts about 780,000 visitors each year. Lindy Lee's sculpture \\"The Life of Stars\\" is mounted on the forecourt of the gallery, after being presented for the 2018 Biennial, Divided Worlds. Created in Shanghai in 2015, the sculpture's polished stainless steel surface reflects its surroundings during the day and radiates light at night. Over 30,000 perforated holes individually placed by Lee resemble a map of our galaxy when lit from within. The sculpture was bought by the gallery as a farewell gift for departing director Nick Mitzevich in April 2018. =Australian art= The Gallery is renowned for its collections of Australian art, including Indigenous Australian and colonial art, from about 1800 onwards. The collection is strong in nineteenth-century works (including silverware and furniture) and in particular Australian Impressionist (often referred to as Heidelberg School) paintings. Its twentieth-century Modernist art collection includes the work of many female artists, and there is a large collection of South Australian art, which includes 2,000 drawings by Hans Heysen and a large collection of photographs. Heidelberg school works include Tom Roberts' A break away!, Charles Conder's A holiday at Mentone, and Arthur Streeton's Road to Templestowe. The mid-twentieth century is represented by works by Russell Drysdale, Arthur Boyd, Margaret Preston, Bessie Davidson, and Sidney Nolan, and South Australian art includes works by James Ashton and Jeffrey Smart. The Gallery became the first Australian gallery to acquire a work by an Indigenous artist in 1939, although systematic acquisition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander art was not realised until the mid-1950s. The Gallery and now holds a large and diverse collection of older and contemporary works, including the Kulata Tjuta collaboration created by A·πâangu artists working in the north of SA. =International= European landscape paintings include works by Jacob Isaakszoon van Ruisdael, Salomon van Ruysdael, Joseph Wright of Derby, and Camille Pissarro. Other European works include paintings by Goya, Francesco Guardi, Pompeo Batoni and Camille Corot. There is a large collection of British art, including many Pre- Raphaelite works, by artists Edward Burne-Jones, William Holman Hunt, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Morris & Co.. Other works include John William Waterhouse's Circe Invidiosa (1892) and The Favourites of the Emperor Honorius (c.1883); William Holman Hunt's Christ and the Two Marys (1847) and The Risen Christ with the Two Marys in the Garden Of Joseph of Aramathea (1897); and John Collier's Priestess of Delphi (1891). Works by British portrait painters include Robert Peake, Anthony van Dyck, Peter Lely and Thomas Gainsborough. Sculpture includes works by Rodin, Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth, Jacob Epstein and Thomas Hirschhorn. The Asian art collection, begun in 1904, includes work from the whole region, with focuses on the pre-modern Japanese art, art of Southeast Asia, India and the Middle East. The Gallery holds Australia's only permanent display of Islamic art. Exhibitions and collaborations As well as its permanent collection, AGSA hosts the Adelaide Biennial of Australian Art, displays a number of visiting exhibitions each year and contributes travelling exhibitions to regional galleries.AGSA Touring Exhibitions 2011 =Adelaide Biennial of Australian Art= The Adelaide Biennial is \\"the only major biennial dedicated solely to presenting contemporary Australian art\\", and also the longest-running exhibition featuring contemporary Australian art. It is supported by the Australia Council and other sponsors. It is presented in association with the Adelaide Festival and staged by AGSA and partner gallery the Samstag Museum, as well as other venues such as the Adelaide Botanic Garden, Mercury Cinema and JamFactory. The Adelaide Biennial was established in 1990, planned to coincide with Artist's Week, which had commenced in 1982 to help counter the poor coverage of visual art in the Adelaide Festival of Arts programme at that time. The Art Gallery of New South Wales introduced an exhibition of Australian art called Australian Perspecta in 1981, which ran in alternate years with the international Biennale of Sydney, in response for the need for more forums focussing on Australian art. In its first iteration in 1990, The Adelaide Biennale set out to emulate the Whitney Biennial of American art in New York City, and was intended to complement the Sydney Biennale and the Australian Perspecta exhibitions. Then director Daniel Thomas said that they had introduced the Biennial to keep Australia up to date: the Festival attracts international and interstate visitors and it was a good time to introduce contemporary Australian art to this audience. Artists such as Fiona Hall, whose work is now in the National Gallery of Art, were showcased at the first Biennial. The exhibition today still projects Thomas' vision, with the most noticeable difference being that the current version has a theme and a catchy title. Selected events The 2014 Biennial was titled \\"Dark Heart\\", an examination of changing national sensibilities, mounted by director Nick Mitzevitch, with 28 artists exhibiting. In 2016, the gallery participated in the large \\"Biennial 2016\\" art festival with its \\"Magic Object\\" exhibitions. In 2018, the title was \\"Divided Worlds\\", which aimed \\"...to describe the divide between ideas and ideologies, between geographies and localities, between communities and nations, and the subjective and objective view of experience and reality itself\\". Venues included the Museum of Economic Botany in Adelaide Botanic Garden. It drew record crowds, with more than 240,000 people over a 93-day season under curator Erica Green. Curator for the 2020 Biennial, which was scheduled to run from 29 February to 8 June 2020, is Leigh Robb, inaugural Curator of Contemporary Art appointed in 2016. The title is \\"Monster Theatres\\", examining \\"our relationships with each other, the environment and technology\\" and featuring a lot of live art. Paintings, photography, sculpture, textiles, film, video, sound art, installation, and performance art by 23 artists are featured, including work by Abdul Abdullah, Stelarc, David Noonan, Garry Stewart and Australian Dance Theatre, Megan Cope, Karla Dickens, Julia Robinson, performance artist Mike Parr, Polly Borland, Willoh S. Weiland, Yhonnie Scarce (whose work In the Dead House was installed in the old Adelaide Lunatic Asylum morgue building in the Botanic Garen) and others. However, AGSA had to temporarily close from 25 March 2020 owing to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, so some of the exhibits were shown online, along with virtual tours of the exhibition. When the gallery reopened on 8 June, it was announced that the exhibition period would be extended to 2 August 2020. Some of the exhibits =Tarnanthi= Since 2015, AGSA has hosted and supported events connected with Tarnanthi (pronounced tar-nan-dee), the Festival of Contemporary Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art. The 2015 exhibition was said to be the \\"most ambitious exhibition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander art in its 134-year history\\". In association with the Government of South Australia and BHP, an expansive city-wide festival is staged biennially (in odd-numbered years), alternating with a focus exhibition at the gallery in the years in between. =Other notable exhibitions= 1906: The Light of the World In 1906, when William Holman Hunt's The Light of the World was on display, 18,168 visitors crammed through the gallery in less than two weeks to see it. Prizes =Ramsay Art Prize= In 2016, a new national $100,000 acquisitive art prize for artists, open to Australian artists under 40 working in any medium, was announced by the Premier of South Australia, Jay Weatherill. Supported by the James & Diana Ramsay Foundation, it is the country's richest art prize, awarded biennially. Chosen by an international judging panel, all finalists are exhibited in a major exhibition over the winter months at the Gallery. There is also a non-acquisitive Lipman Karas People's Choice Prize based on public vote, worth $15,000. 2017 In its inaugural year, over 450 young artists submitted entries. From the 21 finalists selected for the exhibition, Perth-born artist Sarah Contos, now based in Sydney, won the prize for her entry entitled Sarah Contos Presents: The Long Kiss Goodbye. Julie Fragar's 2016 painting Goose Chase: All of Us Together Here and Nowhere, which explores the story of Antonio de Fraga, her first paternal ancestor to emigrate to Australia in the 19th century, won the People's Choice Award. 2019 In 2019, 23 finalists were chosen from a field of 350 submissions. Vincent Namatjira won the main prize with his work Close Contact, 2018, a double-sided full-body representation of a man, in acrylic paint on plywood. Winner of the People's Choice Prize was 24-year-old Zimbabwean man Pierre Mukeba (the youngest finalist) for his by painting entitled Ride to Church, inspired by childhood memories of the whole family perched somewhat precariously on a single motorbike to travel to church.

After his retirement at the end of the 2000 CFL season, Williams worked as a motivational speaker. Born into an impoverished family, Williams was raised by his brother Edgar after the death of both his parents as a child, and, after Edgar's death, by an aunt. Despite his background, Williams was able to be a successful high school football player, and was able to enroll at East Carolina University. After graduating from East Carolina, Williams was signed by the Memphis Showboats of the United States Football League. While playing in Memphis, future Professional Football Hall of Famer Reggie White gave the shifty Williams the nickname \\"Gizmo\\", which would stick with him through his professional career. Williams was released by the Showboats after one season in the USFL in 1985, and signed with the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League. With the exception of a half-season with the Philadelphia Eagles in 1989, Williams would play with the Eskimos for every CFL season from 1986 to 2000. Standing a diminutive , Williams was in many ways a prototypical Canadian football kick returner. He saw some success as a receiver, breaking 900 yards receiving on two occasions, but was best known for his work as a returner. Williams soon developed a trademark of doing a flip in the air after every score, which quickly became associated with Williams in the eyes of the fans. During his career with the Eskimos, Williams set more than 20 CFL records, and is still the league's all-time leader in both punt and kickoff return yardage, and holds the record for most kick return touchdowns with 31 (26 on punt returns, two on kickoff returns and three on missed field goal returns). Perhaps his most memorable was a 115-yard missed-field-goal return for a touchdown in the 1987 Grey Cup. In 2002, Williams's #2 was put on the Edmonton Eskimos Wall of Honour. Four years later, Williams was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame with a class that included former teammate and quarterback Matt Dunigan.'Gizmo' Williams highlights Canadian Football Hall of Fame class In November 2006 he was voted one of the CFL's Top 50 players (#25) of the league's modern era by Canadian sports network The Sports Network/TSN. Williams has a family history of multiple sclerosis, which killed his mother in December 1969 when Williams was six, as well as seven of his ten siblings. Williams's father died in a house fire at Christmas of 1970. He currently is a coach for the Jasper Place High School football senior team.

Usually they are formed by folding over the front edges of the jacket or coat and sewing them to the collar, an extra piece of fabric around the back of the neck. There are three basic forms of lapels: notched, peaked, and shawl. Notched lapels, the most common, are usually seen on business suits, and on more casual jackets like blazers and sport coats.Flusser (2002). p. 83 Peaked lapels are more formal, and nearly always used on double breasted jackets, but also frequently appear on single breasted ones.Flusser (2002). p. 85 Shawl lapels are usually carried by tuxedos and mess jackets.Antongiavanni (2006). p. 172 Types of lapel =Notched lapel= A notch lapel The notched lapel (American English), step lapel or step collar (British English) is sewn to the collar at an angle, creating a step effect. This is the standard on single-breasted suits, and is used on nearly all suit jackets, blazers, and sports jackets. The notched lapel double-breasted jacket is a rare setting. The size of the notch can vary, and a small notch is sometimes called fishmouth.Antongiavanni (2006). p. 48 This was the first type of lapel to appear and is the most common one. =Peaked lapel= A peak lapel The peaked lapel (American English), peak lapel, or pointed lapel (British English), is the most formal, featuring on double- breasted jackets, all formal coats such as a tailcoatFlusser (2002). p. 234 or morning coat, and also commonly with a tuxedo (both single and double breasted). In the late 1920s and 1930s, the single breasted peaked lapel jacket was considered a very stylish design. The feature was carried into day clothing by the increasing popularity of the peaked dinner jacket.Flusser (2002). p. 84 The ability to cut peak lapels properly on a single-breasted suit is one of the most challenging tailoring tasks, even for very experienced tailors. =Shawl lapel= A shawl lapel The shawl lapel, shawl collar, or roll collar is a continuous curve. Originally seen on the Victorian smoking jacket, it is now most common on the dinner jacket or tuxedo. This similarly began as informal eveningwear, and was then made in both more and less formal versions, depending on the situation in which it was to be used. It is also commonly used on mess jackets. A Teba jacket sports a form of notch-less lapel that features an angular turn. Lapel features Lapel watch, USA, c. 1889, Cooper‚ÄìHewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum Lapels have a buttonhole on the left, which is intended to hold a boutonni√®re, a decorative flower. These are now only commonly seen at more formal events. To hold the flower properly, a loop is fixed to the back of the lapel. For symmetry, double breasted suits often have a button hole on each lapel. A lapel pin is also sometimes worn. The width of the lapel is a widely varying aspect of suits, and has changed widely over the years. Some designers maintain however that most stylish lapel width does not change, and that the lapel \\"should extend to just a fraction less than the halfway mark between the collar and shoulder line\\".Flusser (1985). ch. 2 Origin Lord Nelson in a Captain's tailcoat (1781), exhibiting a long, loosely-folded lapel with many buttons The most common style of lapel, the notched lapel, originated in older types of jackets that buttoned to the neck, by unbuttoning and turning back the upper part of the closure at an angle indoors or in hot weather, and then removing the upper buttons. The upper points are derived from the end corners of the collar. This can be duplicated by similarly turning back the closure in a modern button-to-the- neck garment such as an outdoor coat or a boilersuit. Sometimes when caught outside in bad weather in a lapelled jacket and nothing over it, its wearer may unfold the lapels and hold them that way to temporarily reproduce the ancestral to-the-neck closure. As tailcoats evolved rapidly among the wealthy during the Regency period, various styles of closure saw popularity, from fastenings at the top, the middle, or even hanging open. The turn-down collar popular on earlier garments like the frock was succeeded by long lapels folded down to below the waist (fashionably tightly nipped in). Invariably, there were long rows of buttons down the front, most of which did not fasten; in fact even into the late Victorian era, all frock coats had a long row of button holes on the lapel, long since obsolete. As buttoning styles changed, the loosely folded front of the coat correspondingly shifted shape, and the V then formed by the meeting of the fold and the collar continues now in the traditional shape of notched and peaked lapels, both of which originate from that period. Once double breasted frock coats were established, lapels were sharply creased and their form was more static, varying only in details such as height, since they were buttoned nearly to the neck by the Edwardians, then lengthened to the classic three-button shape, the two-button jacket being a further American innovation. The other significant change over that period was the use of the revers in the construction of the lapel, as the Victorians used elaborate three-part patterns to cut a fold of cloth from the lining into the front of the lapel, a universal consideration of frock coats and dress coats of the period, but abandoned in favor of the current single-piece lapels at the same time as the switch to morning coats and lounge suits. Modern lapels are largely identical in form to their 1930s counterparts. English (left) and Spanish (right). The former is the most commonly seen notched lapel Some historians of dress such as Bernard Rudofsky have ridiculed the evolution of jacket lapels into \\"vastly unnecessary flaps\\" and \\"decorative rudiments\\",Rodofsky(1947). p. 122 while others have celebrated the transformation of lapels into \\"fetishes\\" as part and parcel of fashion as expression.  Lapelless jackets Though less common among men's suits in the west, other jacket styles feature no lapels. Jackets with mandarin collars, also called stand collars, band collars, or choker collars, include Nehru jackets and various military dress uniforms, such as the British Army and US Marine Corps. Turndown collars, also called Prussian collars and ghillie collars, were once common on military uniforms and on the Mao suit.

The project was initially sponsored by the West Nordic Council and launched its web interface under the title VESTNORD in 2002. The web interface has since undergone two major revisions, in 2003 and 2008. With the last revision a decision was made to gradually convert images from the DjVu image format to the more common PDF. Hence, part of the collection can be viewed with the DjVu plugin and part with a PDF reader. The digital collection covers material from the 17th century to the early 21st century and offers users the ability to collect bookmarks on their free account for ease of use as well as do a text search on the majority of the collection.

Initially the aim was to limit access to newspapers published before 1930 to avoid questions of copyright but shortly afterwards the project made an agreement with Morgunbla√∞i√∞ to scan and publish issues which are three years old. This agreement was followed with others involving both current and defunct newspapers published in the 20th century. Newspapers published after 2000 are usually sent to the library in digital format. The general rule, depending on agreements with each publisher, is to make these available 2‚Äì3 years after their initial publication.

The island is nominally part of the City of Mackinac Island, Michigan, but is in fact overseen by the U.S. Forest Service. Round Island is adjacent to, and to some extent protects the harbor of, nearby Mackinac Island, and the estimated 900,000 tourists who visit Mackinac Island annually by ferryboat pass close by Round Island on their journeys. To Round Island's southeast lies the inhabited island of Bois Blanc. The sole building on the island (and sole land parcel that is not designated wilderness) is the Round Island Light, a lighthouse constructed in 1895 and currently under restoration. The ship channel between Mackinac Island and Round Island, lighted by Round Island Light, is called Round Island Channel. Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour can be seen sitting near the lighthouse in the 1980 movie Somewhere in Time which was filmed primarily on Mackinac Island. The lighthouse is off-limits to anyone who may visit the island. While it is rare for Round Island to see any visitors, there is a small harbor on the north shore that attracts occasional inhabitants of Mackinac Island who sail to the harbor's sandy beach for a secluded, quiet visit.

Biography and education  Tarleton Hoffman Bean was born to George Bean and Mary Smith Bean in Bainbridge, Pennsylvania, on October 8, 1846. He attended State Normal School at nearby Millersport, Pennsylvania, graduating in 1866. He received an M.D. degree from Columbian University, now George Washington University, Washington, DC, 1876. In 1883, he was awarded an M.S. degree from the Indiana University on the basis of his professional accomplishments, although he did not attend classes there. He married Laurette H. van Hook, daughter of John Welsh VanHook, a local Washington businessman, in 1878 in Washington, DC. They had one daughter, Caroline van Hook Bean (born in Washington on November 16, 1879), a noted artist who later married Bernardus Blommers, Jr. His brother, Barton Appler Bean, also became an ichthyologist and worked under him at the National Museum. Bean died in Albany, New York, on December 28, 1916.  Career and contributions In addition to his work in ichthyology, Bean was a forester, a fish culturist, a conservationist, an editor, an administrator, and an exhibitor. Growing up along the Susquehanna River in southern Pennsylvania, he presumably had an early introduction to fishes. His initial interest, however, was botany, perhaps stimulated by his acquaintance with Joseph Trimble Rothrock, a physician-scientist who had a medical practice in Wilkes-Barre, but also had taught botany at Pennsylvania State College. His focus on ichthyology probably began in the summer of 1874, when he worked as a volunteer at the Fish Commission laboratory in Noank, Connecticut. There, he first met Spencer F. Baird and a number of the young scientists who had gathered around him. First among these was George Brown Goode, who with Bean would form one of the most famous collaborative teams in ichthyology. Bean spent the next two decades in Washington working for Baird's two institutions, the National Museum and the Fish Commission, in a number of capacities. He left Washington in 1895 to become the Director of the New York Aquarium, but political problems led to his resignation in 1898. He spent most of the next eight years working on the fisheries and forestry exhibits at the world's fairs in Paris (1900) and St. Louis (1904). In 1906, he became New York‚Äôs state fish culturist, a position he held until his death in 1916 following an automobile accident. Bean is probably best known for the work in systematic ichthyology that he did while in Washington, particularly in collaboration with Goode. The pair wrote 39 papers together, culminating in Oceanic Ichthyology (1896). They were the beneficiaries of the extensive survey and collecting activities being done by Fish Commission vessels in the poorly explored deep waters off the coast of North America. Bean was also an authority on the fishes of Pennsylvania, New York, Bermuda, and Alaska. Most of his later papers dealt with fish culture, and at the time of his death he was considered the nation's premier authority on that subject. He was also a dedicated educator, from his early teaching days in Pennsylvania to his work on the great international exhibitions and his many popular articles and lectures on fishes, forestry, and conservation. Bean was a pioneer in the growth of American ichthyology in the post-Civil War years and by the end of his life was one of its most respected and honored members.

S., & Heslop-Harrison, J. (1955). The deme terminology and the units of micro-evolutionary change. Genetica, 27(1), 147-161. However, when biologists, and especially zoologists, use the term ‚Äòdeme‚Äô they usually refer to it as the definition of a gamodeme:Winsor, M. P. (2000). Species, Demes, and the Omega Taxonomy: Gilmour and The NewSystematics. Biology and Philosophy, 15(3), 349-388. a local group of individuals (from the same taxon) that interbreed with each other and share a gene pool. The latter definition of a deme is only applicable to sexual reproducing species, while the former is more neutral and also takes asexual reproducing species into account, such as certain plant species. In the following sections the latter (and most frequently used) definition of a deme will be used. In evolutionary computation, a \\"deme\\" often refers to any isolated subpopulation subjected to selection as a unit rather than as individuals.  Local adaptation  A population of a species usually has multiple demes. Environments between these demes can differ. Demes could, therefore, become locally adapted to their environment. A good example of this is the Adaptive Deme Formation (ADF) hypothesis in insects.Zandt, P. A. V., & Mopper, S. (1998). A meta-analysis of adaptive deme formation in phytophagous insect populations. The American Naturalist, 152(4), 595-604. The ADF hypothesis states that herbivorous insects can become adapted to specific host plants in their local environment because local plants can have unique nutrient patches to which insects may become adapted. This hypothesis predicts that less mobile insect demes are more likely to become locally adapted than more dispersive insect. However, a meta-analysis, based on 17 studies on this subject, showed that dispersive insect demes were as likely to become locally adapted as less mobile insects. Moreover, this study found a small indication that feeding behaviour might stimulate the local adaptation of demes. Endophagous insects were more likely to become locally adapted than exophagous insects. The explanation for this could be that endophagous insects come in more close and continuous contact to the plant‚Äôs mechanical, chemical and phenological defensive mechanisms.  Speciation and demes  Speciation could occur at the level of demes. When a deme gets geographically isolated from other demes of the same species, gene-flow between these demes will stop which could lead to speciation after a long time. This is called allopatric speciation and is generally a slow process.Carson, H. L. (1987). The genetic system, the deme, and the origin of species. Annual review of genetics, 21(1), 405-423. On the contrary, sympatric speciation can be more rapid when a species has multiple small demes.Bush, G. L., Case, S. M., Wilson, A. C., & Patton, J. L. (1977). Rapid speciation and chromosomal evolution in mammals. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 74(9), 3942-3946. This rapid speciation is both observed in plantsLevin, D. A., & Wilson, A. C. (1976). Rates of evolution in seed plants: net increase in diversity of chromosome numbers and species numbers through time. Proceedings of the National Academy of sciences, 73(6), 2086-2090. and vertebrates. Rapid speciation is explained by the ecology and social structure of demes. Species that behave more territorial, live in patchy environments and/or have a polygynous breeding system with only one reproductive male tend to have smaller deme sizes. Interbreeding between small demes is rare due to these factors. Furthermore, alleles fixate more rapid in smaller demes. Small demes could, therefore, become genetically distinct from each other. Primates, for example, have the second highest speciation rate among mammals, with one speciation event per lineage every 3 million years. However, not all primate species have a high speciation rate; this is reflected in their deme size and social structure. Guenons (Cercopithecus), for example, live together in small polygynous troops and are a quite diverse genus. On the other hand, baboons (Papio) have a much lower speciation rate. Baboons have larger deme sizes because they live in polygynous multi-male troops. These baboon demes are usually allopatric but gene-flow still exists between demes with hybridization being common. Examples Various populations of gorillas can be understood by their geographical separation and have been assessed to determine distinct and disjointed gene pools.Andrea Beth Taylor and Michele Lynn Goldsmith (2003) Gorilla Biology: A Multidisciplinary Perspective, Cambridge University Press, 508 pages , The polar bear, Ursus maritimus, is understood to have 19 identifiable demes, even though their circumpolar distribution allows some interchange among the demes.C.

It comprises four novels: Intervention, Jack the Bodiless, Diamond Mask and Magnificat. The series involves several religious and philosophical themes, including references to the work of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. The novels The series begins with Intervention: A Root Tale to the Galactic Milieu and a Vinculum between it and The Saga of Pliocene Exile (, Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1987). This was released in one volume in the UK, but in mass market paperback in the USA as two volumes: Surveillance and Metaconcert. May calls Intervention a vinculum, or link-tale, between the Saga of Pliocene Exile and the Milieu trilogy proper. However, it is a near-essential introduction to the Milieu trilogy as well as a balanced stand-alone work. Jack the Bodiless (, New York: Knopf, 1991) is the first book of the trilogy proper, followed by Diamond Mask (, New York: Knopf, 1994), and Magnificat (, New York: Knopf, 1996). Religious and philosophical themes The series includes multiple references to the work of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, including the concepts of the Omega Point and the Noosphere, which are applied to May's description of galactic mental Unity. The series title echoes Teilhard's 1957 book Le Milieu Divin. The Remillard family are Catholic, and on several occasions family members discuss their faith. The most notable example occurs in the first part of Chapter 24 of Jack the Bodiless, where Teresa Kendall explains Christianity to her unborn son. Jack the Bodiless begins with a set of quotations, including the Spanish proverb \\"God writes straight with crooked lines.\\" This proverb summarises the plot of the whole series, in which tragedies and disasters (particularly the Metapsychic Rebellion) result in ultimate good (particularly the repentance and transformation of Marc Remillard, through which the Galactic Milieu is formed). The Rebellion is thus a Felix culpa. Julian May's description of \\"metapsychic\\" abilities explicitly refers to the concepts of auras (particularly in Part III of Intervention) and chakras (particularly in discussing the feeding of the \\"Hydra\\"). Aspects of May's Universe =Alien races= The Lylmik (LIL-mik) are the oldest race in the Galaxy, having been shepherded to mental Unity or \\"coadunation\\" by the entity known as Atoning Unifex. They created the Galactic Milieu, and in turn mentored the Krondaku, Gi, Simbiari, and Poltroyans. The Krondaku (krah'n-DAH-koo) are large tentacled invertebrate \\"monsters\\", the Gi (ghee) are feathered hermaphrodites with a well-developed aesthetic sense, the Simbiari (sih'm-bee-AH-ree) are green and slimy, while the Poltroyans are small purple humanoids who most resemble human beings both physically and mentally. =Planets= Events of the novels take place on several planets: Earth; the Concilium Orb, an artificial planet constructed by the Lylmik, and the seat of the galactic Council; Hibernia, an Irish-dominated human colony; Caledonia, a Scottish- dominated human colony; Denali, a snow-covered planet popular as a holiday destination; and the cosmopolitan human colony planet of Okanagon. Apart from the home planets and colonies of the alien races, a number of other planets are also mentioned in passing. =\\"Metapsychic\\" powers= Julian May describes five categories of \\"metapsychic\\" powers in the series: creation, coercion, psychokinesis, farsensing and redaction. Each of these powers is associated with a colour, as originally described in the Saga of Pliocene Exile. Creativity is the ability to create illusions and manipulate energy. In its strongest form, it can involve permanent changes of matter from one kind to another, as when Jack creates flowers from waste. The same level of power can also be used to create mental lasers, and the \\"Metapsychic Rebellion\\" causes considerable damage with such mental weapons, produced by brains amplified with cerebroenergetic (CE) equipment. Rogi possesses creative abilities, though unreliable ones, and these occasionally help him in moments of need. Coercion is the ability of metapsychic mind control over other people. For example, in Magnificat, Denis uses metapsychic coercion to manipulate Rogi to climb Mt. Washington. Psychokinesis (PK) is the ability to move physical objects through space metapsychically. Within the series, flagrant use of this power (especially amongst non-operants) is considered immensely juvenile and d√©class√© by most operants. Farsensing is the ability to communicate with others and to sense remotely via metapsychic means, much like telepathy, clairvoyance, or remote viewing. In Intervention, the ability of farsensing (initially called \\"ultrasensing\\") to locate hidden weapons becomes geopolitically important. Finally, Redaction provides the ability for mental healing, or can be abused for mental damage. Dorothea MacDonald has very strong redactive powers. These five mental powers can be latent, meaning that, while present, they cannot be consciously used. On the other hand, operant powers are available for conscious, controlled use. Higher capabilities within operancy include Master, Grand Master, and Paramount Grand Master levels. Jack, Marc, and Dorothea are all (eventually) Paramounts. Julian May describes collaborative as well as individual mental powers. A metaconcert is a synchronised use of mental powers by more than one person, as when Jack and Dorothea tackle the geological problems of Caledonia. The ultimate extension of such collaboration is the mental Unity which the Lylmik are fostering in the galaxy. Plots of the novels =Intervention= The book follows the Remillard family of New Hampshire from the years immediately after World War II through an increasingly turbulent world, in which various \\"metapsychic\\" humans manoeuvre in secret to direct the destiny of the human race. The Remillards play a central role in this story, though the narrator, Rogatien \\"Uncle Rogi\\" Remillard, is often an alienated observer rather than a central participant. At the same time, the earth is under surveillance by representatives of a galactic culture (the \\"Galactic Milieu\\" of the series title), who monitor the human race's fitness for admission into the wider galactic community. Interwoven with this narrative are glimpses of the time after the main action of the series, drawing together threads from it and the Pliocene Exile series. Intervention climaxes with the Great Intervention, the revelation of this wider galactic society. This sets the stage for the more focused story May has to tell in the remainder of the series. This deals with the history of several family lines with strong metapsychic potential, especially the Remillards. This line begins with twins Rogatien (Rogi) and Donatien (Don), whose mother died giving birth to them. They discover that they have unusual mental abilities (which admittedly turn out to be far less than those of later generations of metapsychics). Rogi is a milder mannered man, who becomes sterile through mumps. Don is distrustful and malicious, but handsome and charming, and steals Rogi's girlfriend Marie Madeleine \\"Sunny\\" Fabr√©. From an early age, Rogi was visited by an entity he called \\"the Family Ghost\\", and it is this entity who commanded Rogi to write his memoirs. The Ghost first rescued Rogi as a child, and many years later rescued Don after Rogi tried to kill him in a rage for stealing his girlfriend. The Ghost tells Rogi that he is sterile, but would have an important role in guiding Don's key descendants. Rogi becomes close to Don and Sunny's firstborn child Denis. Denis is a precocious child, and quickly learns to master many metapsychic faculties, greatly exceeding those of Rogi and Don, in addition to excelling intellectually. Rogi becomes like a real father to him, while Don is always out getting drunk at night. Rogi and Denis start to search for people with similar powers. Don becomes jealous of Denis's powers but, through Denis's young coercion, is rendered unable to hurt him. Meanwhile, Don and Sunny raise their nine other children, including the monstrously evil second-born Victor, who terrorizes his younger siblings and suppresses their mental powers. Don focuses upon Victor as Denis grows up, seeming to shape him into a vigorous athletic counterpart to Denis's intellectual existence. The more sinister nature of Victor's influences becomes apparent in later volumes. Don reacts against Rogi's influence upon his children, but cannot overcome Denis's attachment to his uncle. Rogi leaves for a job as a hotel manager, where Denis can visit during the holidays. Rogi worries about Denis's education, as his local school is not challenging, but Don does not see education as something to invest in for his children - especially for Denis. Rogi learns of a Jesuit monastic school and manages to get Don to allow him to send Denis there. This leads to Denis attending Dartmouth College due to a new program for \\"special students\\". He becomes prominent in many fields, particularly psychology and the understanding of \\"metapsychic\\" abilities, eventually becoming the \\"Grandfather of Metapsychology\\". Subsequent research yields results in many places in the world and Denis organizes yearly meetings within the secret metapsychic community. At the same time, Victor is plotting with the sociopathic gangster metapsychic Kieran O'Connor to bring down the government with their metapsychic powers. This culminates in a showdown at the end of the book where Denis calls out to all the present and absent metapsychics of goodwill to join in a \\"metaconcert\\" against an attack by Victor and Kieran. The watching Milieu agents invisible in the sky hear this call, and the subsequent metaconcert, and therefore intervene. Victor, meanwhile, goes after Rogi who has learned too much. Through his metapsychic power of creativity, Rogi uses a mental laser to put Victor into a vegetative state. Rogi never understood how he could have overcome such a powerful metapsychic as Victor, until the Family Ghost reveals decades later that he assisted. =Jack the Bodiless= As the Milieu trilogy proper begins with Jack the Bodiless, humankind, led by the Remillard family, is awaiting acceptance into the Galactic Milieu. With Earth's government being overseen by one of the alien races (Simbiari) ultimately under the authority of the Galactic Milieu, harsh laws (including eugenics laws) are instituted, which fuels feelings of suspicion in both earth's normal and metapsychic population. Denis by now has fathered many children, the youngest of whom (Paul) is elected leader of Humanity. Marc, Paul's firstborn with his wife Teresa Kendall ‚Äî a grandchild of Don's via Rogi's former lover, Elaine, is the most powerful human metapsychic known at that time, who also has a genius-level intellect. Paul & Teresa started Marc's education while he was still in utero, which was by then becoming an accepted practice. Also born, at Victor's deathbed, was Fury. This is a sociopathic entity that has its own agenda for the Galactic Milieu and the Remillard family in particular. Fury in turn ‚Äòcreated‚Äô from the minds of five unborn metapsychic fetuses, a physical monster called The Hydra to do its bidding. Following a number of failed pregnancies Teresa has her reproductive license revoked (under the interdict, metapsychics must have permission to have children). Teresa then loses her ability to sing, and thereby loses Paul‚Äôs attention. Sometime later Teresa regains her voice and becomes illegally pregnant with the last of their children, and when Marc farsenses emotional problems over her pregnancy he visits his mother to investigate. Upon learning of his mother‚Äôs pregnancy, Marc takes it upon himself to hide Teresa and his future brother in the icy Canadian wilderness. Marc realises that Rogi is the only family member who would be empathetic enough to help, and recruits him for this purpose. Marc fakes a ‚Äúcanoeing accident‚Äù so that the Remillard family and the Magistratum of the Milieu believe them dead, and after many months in the wilderness, Rogi assists Teresa in the birth, and Jon Remillard, the future ‚ÄúSaint Jack the Bodiless‚Äù, is born. Although Jack has the outward appearance of a normal human child, his intellect and mental prowess rapidly set him apart from the rest of humankind, as does the fact that his body begins to generate inoperable and incurable tumours that are slowly overwhelming him. Despite the fact that Jack possesses each of the five higher mindpowers (also known as metafaculties) at the highest known level (Paramount Grand Master), he is incapable of effecting change in his own physiology. The Lylmik, the oldest and most powerful of the alien races in the milieu, veto his euthanasia and leave it up to Jack. An attack by Fury on Jack as he lies in his hospital room leads to an evolutionary jump in which Jack discards his physical form and metamorphoses into his final state as a disembodied brain. =Diamond Mask= The second book deals mainly with Dorothea MacDonald on the Scottish world of Caledonia. Dorothea lives with her father and her brother amid several step brothers and sisters. Dorothea's mother and other relatives are killed in an attack by the entity known as Hydra, a ‚Äúmetapsychic entity‚Äù that Fury uses as an assassin. Hydra consists of four (formerly five) metapsychics who can mind-meld into a powerful vampiric metaconcert when not leading their normal lives. After this, Dorothea realises that she is a latent metapsychic ‚Äî one with inherent potential but mental blocks that prevent her using her powers, as opposed to the ‚Äúoperant‚Äù metapsychics. However, she starts to overcome her blocks and is able to use her mind to protect and heal herself. Meanwhile, Paul Remillard is preparing for Human entry into the Milieu and is in line to become the inaugural First human Magnate of the Concillium. When his rival's wife is killed after being shoved into a trash compactor in an apparent suicide disguising her murder by Hydra, a hold is put on Human entry into the Milieu for 1,000 Galactic Days. The Krondaku investigators suspect the Remillards to be involved. Dorothea turns out to be another Paramount, with incredibly strong redactive powers and resistance to metapsychic probes and attacks. Young Marc Remillard is not able to probe her mind even when his powers are enhanced by the cerebroenergetic (CE) equipment that he has invented, although CE allows him to resist counterprobes. She even manages to slip into Denis's mind, but he quickly throws her out before she can find out much. Dorothea and Jack have a role in saving an inhabited planet from a diatreme eruption, using their paramount powers aided by CE. But her lower face is terribly deformed in this heroic act, so after this she always wears a diamond-studded half-mask, and acquires her nickname ‚ÄúDiamond Mask‚Äù. =Magnificat= By the third book in the series, Marc has matured into a highly capable metapsychic and is regarded as a Paramount. Through manipulated dreams, Marc conceives an idea called 'Mental Man' which would create a new subspecies of Man called Homo [sapiens] summus. It would use selective breeding, surgical modification, mental training (through induced pain) and technological enhancement to create hundreds of humans with the powers ‚Äî and disembodiment ‚Äî of Marc's younger brother Jack. This project has been kept highly secret for several years, but peers and competitors of Marc begin to get suspicious. He develops several increasingly powerful CE devices. These amplify a human's inherent metapsychic ability by orders of magnitude. The CE device is discussed in the debates of the Concilium, and is deemed too dangerous to be generally used. Marc disagrees, his research continues in secret although outlawed, and culminates in devices capable of 600√ó amplification. Marc's increasing ambition draws him to side with a rebel faction of the Concillium ‚Äî those that do not wish to join 'Unity' with the other races and therefore with the Galactic Mind itself. The rebel faction determinedly opposes this as they believe humans will lose their individuality and privacy and will become thralls to the other races. By this time, only two out of the original five Hydra units remain, Parnell Remillard and Madeleine Remillard ‚Äî Marc's cousin and sister (it is revealed that the Hydra heads were the unborn children present at the vigil around Victor, where Fury corrupted their infant minds). One wet night, Denis' favorite daughter, Anne Remillard ‚Äî a staunch loyalist and advocate of Unity ‚Äî visits Rogi's bookshop. She has deduced that Denis is Fury. Rogi doubts this but when Anne is attacked and nearly killed, he realises that he must inform Jack and Dorothea of the identity of Fury. The only opportune moment seems their upcoming wedding. After Rogi divulges the information on Fury/Denis to Jack and Dorothea, the Remillard dynasty assembles in order to 'exorcise' Denis. Denis is tricked into making himself vulnerable, and they attempt to remove the Fury element of his psyche. This goes disastrously wrong, and Denis/Fury vanishes. He is later realised to have \\"D-Jumped\\" ‚Äî teleported ‚Äî a first for man and most aliens, although it is revealed in the Saga of the Pliocene Exile that the Shipspouses of Lene had this ability. Marc, previously totally chaste, falls madly in love with Cyndia Muldowney, the daughter of Rory, an opponent of Paul's, and the two marry. After several events, Denis manages to briefly gain control from his Fury persona, and communicates with Cyndia. He reveals that the Mental Man babies (which were created from Marc and Madeleine's sperm and eggs) have become hundreds of Hydra by Madeleine's influence. Denis D-Jumps inside the complex and destroys all the children. Marc is dumbstruck, yet finds a way to terminate the Hydra-infested project while retaining the possibility of a new start. He mind-lasers Madeleine, aided by the CE, and has her frozen so that her ovaries may be used. Denis travels to Mt. Washington, where he has manipulated Rogi using metapsychic coercion to journey to the summit. Bad weather hits the mountain and Rogi is shepherded into a shack by his nephew. Denis persuades Rogi to kill him with his yogic technique, as he fears Fury will regain control. None of his children could manage that even though they have strong metapsychic powers, because children seem to have a block against using their powers to attack their parents. And as Denis regards Rogi as a father figure, he hopes that Fury cannot use his powers against Rogi. Rogi feebly manages to start the technique but cannot muster the power. However, Fury does regain control and tries to kill Rogi physically, since the mental block against using metapsychic powers against parent figures does indeed apply. This act of violence gives Rogi the necessary desperation to trigger his operancy, and he vaporises Denis, to his great grief. Marc in the meantime, continues his quest for Mental Man, but realises that the Metapsychic rebellion is too near for Mental Man to be present to ensure victory. Cyndia discovers Marc's plans, is horrified, and decides to remove all available sources of the new Mental Man. She acquires a sonic apparatus that will render Marc sterile, and triggers it by a telepathic command. However, Marc detects this impulse, realises what the device has done, and kills Cyndia by reflex. Paul, father of Jack and Marc, is the leader of the Pro-Unity camp, and Jack decide to campaign against the rebels. As tension builds and several children start to co-adunate, the rebels' long-laid plans move into action. Marc has equipped hundreds of individuals with his CE devices, and his colleagues arm many ships. The rebels decide to demonstrate their power by destroying a planet ‚Äî Molakar: the Krondaku planet from which the intervention was staged. Billions die in several seconds as the joined minds of the Rebels superheat the crust of the planet. A massive wave of metapsychic suffering and grief overwhelms the minds of the entire milieu. The response is not what Marc expects. Jack, Dorothea and his father, Paul, decide to confront him peacefully and will not let him take war to the galaxy. Marc decides to fight regardless, but the three pacifists call out to all the metapsychics in the galaxy to help join in Unity and stop the Rebels. One of Marc's main allies is Patricia Castellane, the Dirigent (planetary leader) of the cosmopolitan planet Okanagon. During the attack, the rebels accidentally lose control of another explosive device and it explodes, setting off Okanagon's unstable crust. The resultant geological catastrophe kills the entire population of two billion people. Jack telepathically asks his once-idolized brother, \\"What have you done?!\\" Jack and Dorothea manage to halt the rebel fleet, thanks to their ability to conjoin the powers of all the pro-Milieu operant humans. But these two and Paul die as a result. Many of the Rebels are also killed when their CEs overload, and Marc and a number of the leaders are badly hurt. The deaths of the people of Okanagon, however, propel humanity into the state of mental co-ordination (called \\"coadunation\\") which is the precursor to a benevolent joining of minds across the galaxy which the member races of the Milieu refer to as Unity. After the rebel faction is defeated, their leaders flee through a unique one- directional gate in France 6 million years back in time, to the Pliocene period. They were aided by a Lylmik who was powerful enough even to freeze Marc in his tracks, as he had done many years previously when Marc was a boy. There they stay in exile, and the events of the Saga of Pliocene Exile take place. Marc Remillard survives all those years (thanks to his \\"immortality gene\\", a trait shared by most members of the Remillard clan in differing degrees) and eventually evolves to the 3rd stage of mental evolution, where he brings purpose to the Lylmik to create the milieu. He thoroughly repents of his great evil, and becomes the enlightened leader of the same galactic society that starts the intervention, calling himself Atoning Unifex. Marc is evidently the Lylmik who appeared to his past self, and turns out to be the incorporeal \\"Family Ghost\\" who appears to Rogi for several years, driving him to finish his memoirs as a unique document of the Metapsychic rebellion. Marc, according to the family tree, passes on to the next stage of existence / evolution leaving Rogi to be healed and back in a relationship with Elaine. Some of the Lylmik have human bodies now as well and the future of what happens next is, as yet, unknown. Reception Paul Pettengale reviewed Magnificat for Arcane magazine, rating it a 9 out of 10 overall.

Compared to earlier mechanisms, it reduces fragmentation caused by allocations and deallocations. The technique is used to retain allocated memory that contains a data object of a certain type for reuse upon subsequent allocations of objects of the same type. It is analogous to an object pool, but only applies to memory, not other resources. Slab allocation was first introduced in the Solaris 2.4 kernel by Jeff Bonwick. It is now widely used by many Unix and Unix-like operating systems including FreeBSDFreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual and Linux.M. Tim Jones, Anatomy of the Linux slab allocator  Basis  The primary motivation for slab allocation is that the cost (in CPU time) of initialization and destruction of kernel data objects can outweigh the cost of allocating memory for them.Jeff Bonwick,The Slab Allocator: An Object-Caching Kernel Memory Allocator (1994) As the kernel creates and deletes objects often, overhead costs of initialization can result in significant performance drops. Object caching leads to less frequent invocation of functions that initialize object state: when a slab-allocated object is released after use, the slab allocation system typically keeps it cached (rather than doing the work of destroying it) ready for re-use next time an object of that type is needed (thus avoiding the work of constructing and initialising a new object). With slab allocation, a cache for a certain type or size of data object has a number of pre-allocated \\"slabs\\" of memory; within each slab there are memory chunks of fixed size suitable for the objects.Abraham Silberschatz et al.: Operating system concepts. Wiley: 2004. The slab allocator keeps track of these chunks, so that when it receives a request to allocate memory for a data object of a certain type, usually it can satisfy the request with a free slot (chunk) from an existing slab. When the allocator is asked to free the object's memory, it just adds the slot to the containing slab's list of free (unused) slots. The next call to create an object of the same type (or allocate memory of the same size) will return that memory slot (or some other free slot) and remove it from the list of free slots. This process eliminates the need to search for suitable memory space and greatly alleviates memory fragmentation. In this context, a slab is one or more contiguous pages in the memory containing pre- allocated memory chunks.  Implementation  Understanding the slab allocation algorithm requires defining and explaining some terms: # Cache: cache represents a small amount of very fast memory. A cache is a storage for a specific type of object, such as semaphores, process descriptors, file objects, etc. # Slab: slab represents a contiguous piece of memory, usually made of several physically contiguous pages. The slab is the actual container of data associated with objects of the specific kind of the containing cache. When a program sets up a cache, it allocates a number of objects to the slabs associated with that cache. This number depends on the size of the associated slabs. Slabs may exist in one of the following states : # empty ‚Äì all objects on a slab marked as free # partial ‚Äì slab consists of both used and free objects # full ‚Äì all objects on a slab marked as used Initially, the system marks each slab as \\"empty\\". When the process calls for a new kernel object, the system tries to find a free location for that object on a partial slab in a cache for that type of object. If no such location exists, the system allocates a new slab from contiguous physical pages and assigns it to a cache. The new object gets allocated from this slab, and its location becomes marked as \\"partial\\". The allocation takes place quickly, because the system builds the objects in advance and readily allocates them from a slab. Slabs A slab is the amount by which a cache can grow or shrink. It represents one memory allocation to the cache from the machine, and whose size is customarily a multiple of the page size. A slab must contain a list of free buffers (or bufctls), as well as a list of the bufctls that have been allocated (in the case of a large slab size). =Large slabs= These are for caches that store objects that are at least 1/8 of the page size for a given machine. The reason for the large slabs having a different layout from the small slabs is that it allows large slabs to pack better into page-size units, which helps with fragmentation. The slab contains a list of bufctls, which are simply controllers for each buffer that can be allocated (a buffer is the memory that the user of a slab allocator would use). =Small slabs= The small slabs contain objects that are less than 1/8 of the page size for a given machine. These small slabs need to be optimized further from the logical layout, by avoiding using bufctls (which would be just as large as the data itself and cause memory usage to be much greater). A small slab is exactly one page, and has a defined structure that allows bufctls to be avoided. The last part of the page contains the 'slab header', which is the information needed to retain the slab. Starting at the first address of that page, there are as many buffers as can be allocated without running into the slab header at the end of the page. Instead of using bufctls, we use the buffers themselves to retain the free list links. This allows the small slab's bufctl to be bypassed.

In his writings he refers to himself as Campanus Nouariensis; contemporary documents refer to him as Magister Campanus; and the full style of his name is Magister Campanus Nouariensis. He is also referred to as Campano da Novara, Giovanni Campano or similar. Later authors (from the 16th century on) sometimes applied the forename Johannes Campanus or Iohannes Campanus. His date of birth is uncertain but may have been as early as the first decade of the 13th century and the place of birth was probably Novara in Piedmont. He served as chaplain to Pope Urban IV, Pope Adrian V, Pope Nicholas IV, and Pope Boniface VIII. His contemporary Roger Bacon cited Campanus as one of the two \\"good\\" (but not \\"perfect\\") mathematicians indicating that Bacon considered Campanus as excellent or one of the greatest mathematicians of their time. A number of benefices were conferred upon him and he was relatively wealthy at the time of his death. He died at Viterbo in 1296. The crater Campanus on the Moon is named after him.  Published works  First page of the Latin edition of Euclid's Elements by Campanus (1482 printing) Tetragonismus idest circuli quadratura, 1503 Campanus wrote a Latin edition of Euclid's Elementa in fifteen books. This work by Campanus was very influential and was the most frequently used compilation of Euclid until the 16th century. It was based on a compilation by Robert of Chester and also includes material from: Arithmetica by Jordanus de Nemore, commentary on Euclid by Anaritius, and additions by Campanus himself. It was the first printed edition of Euclid, published by Erhard Ratdolt in Venice in 1482 as Preclarissimus liber elementorum Euclidis perspicacissimi. In the field of astronomy, he wrote a Theorica Planetarum in which he geometrically described the motions of the planets as well as their longitude. He also included instructions on building a planetary equatorium as well as its geometrical description. Campanus also attempted to determine the time of each planet's retrograde motion. The data on planets are drawn from the Almagest and the Toledan Tables of the Arab astronomer Arzachel. Campanus gave precise instructions on using the tables, and made detailed calculations of the distances to the planets and their sizes. This work has been called \\"the first detailed account of the Ptolemaic astronomical system... to be written in the Latin-speaking West.\\" A house system for horoscopes that divides the prime vertical into equal 30¬∞ arcs, or houses, is often attributed to him but the method is known to have been described by others before his time. = Bibliography = * Elementa, 1255‚Äì1259 * Theorica planetarum, 1261‚Äì1264 * Computus maior, 1268 * Tractatus de sphera, after 1268 * De quadratura circuli * De quadrante * Tres circulos in astrolapsu descriptos... * Tractatus de astrologia indicaria  References   External links  * Category:1296 deaths Category:Italian astrologers Category:Italian astronomers Category:13th-century Italian mathematicians Category:People from Novara Category:1220s births Category:13th-century astronomers Category:13th-century Italian writers Category:13th-century astrologers Category:13th-century Latin writers Category:13th-century translators Category:Medieval Italian astronomers ","title":"Campanus of Novara"},{"id":"3926892","text":"Rose Marie (1923‚Äì2017) was an American actress.

Specific types of injuries include: * Injuries to the chest wall ** Chest wall contusions or hematomas. ** Rib fractures ** Flail chest ** Sternal fractures ** Fractures of the shoulder girdle * Pulmonary injury (injury to the lung) and injuries involving the pleural space ** Pulmonary contusion ** Pulmonary laceration ** Pneumothorax ** Hemothorax ** Hemopneumothorax * Injury to the airways ** Tracheobronchial tear * Cardiac injury ** Pericardial tamponade ** Myocardial contusion ** Traumatic arrest ** Hemopericardium * Blood vessel injuries ** Traumatic aortic rupture ** Thoracic aorta injury ** Aortic dissection * And injuries to other structures within the torso ** Esophageal injury (Boerhaave syndrome) ** Diaphragm injury Diagnosis Most blunt injuries are managed with relatively simple interventions like tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation and chest tube insertion. Diagnosis of blunt injuries may be more difficult and require additional investigations such as CT scanning. Penetrating injuries often require surgery, and complex investigations are usually not needed to come to a diagnosis. Patients with penetrating trauma may deteriorate rapidly, but may also recover much faster than patients with blunt injury.

The group was founded by the influence of the purposes of the Negro Unit of the Federal Theatre Project in Harlem. It produced 19 plays before closing in 1949. Designed as a community theater group, performances were held in Harlem's Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. In 1942, ANT began its Studio Theatre training program for beginning actors. Graduates include Sidney Poitier and Harry Belafonte.  History  Hill and O'Neal started the ANT by assembling several of their own theatre friends: Howard Augusta, James Jackson, Virgil Richardson, Claire Leyba, Jefferson D. Davis, Vivian Hall, Austin Briggs-Hall, Stanley Green, Fanny McConnell, and Kenneth Manigault. Collectively, they started the group with just 11 cents. In the beginning, Hill spent his time mailing out postcards to invite as many people as he could to meetings and within just a few weeks, the group grew to thirty people. Hill approached librarians at the public library on 135th Street in Harlem, the Harlem Branch of the New York Public Library, to start producing his plays. The librarians granted Hill and the ANT permission to use their basement stage. The basement theatre held 150 seats and Hill charged 49 cents a seat. The first show they produced, \\"Hits, Bits, and Skits,\\" opened on July 17, 1940. The first major play that the ANT put into rehearsal was \\"On Strivers' Row\\" which Hill put into rehearsal after it had done so well with the Rose McClendon Players who also held performances in Harlem. \\"On Strivers' Row\\" ran for five months and in March 1941, Hill moved it to the Apollo Theatre as a musical with the lyrics of Don Burley, the music of J.P. Johnson, and the choreography of Leonard Harper. It ran at the Apollo Theatre for one week. In 1944, the ANT applied to the General Education Board of the Rockefeller Foundation for a financial grant. The proposal they submitted asked for salaries to be paid to the company's officers. It also informed the Board on the following objectives of the ANT: # To Develop an Art # To Develop a Vital Theatre # To Develop Pride and Honor The proposal resulted in a $22,000 grant-in-aid for the ANT. These objectives were also printed on programs for ANT productions. Its most successful production, Anna Lucasta, fundamentally transformed the ANT. A white author, Phillip Yordan, wrote the play about a Polish family in Pennsylvania whose daughter is a waterfront prostitute, but could not find a company to perform it. So he rewrote it to feature a black family. It was performed by the ANT in 1944. According to a notice in The Brooklyn Eagle on March 30, 1944, the sets for that initial production were designed by the American realist painter Michael Lenson, but that has not been verified. Five weeks later the play opened on Broadway. Nine New York newspaper dailies reviewed the show. They all raved and producers instantly starting fighting over who would get the rights to the play. Yordan agreed to sign a Dramatists Guild contract that would make Hill the coauthor of Anna Lucasta. This gave Hill a five percent author's royalty. The ANT itself received few royalties for Anna Lucasta and the next three ANT plays to appear on Broadway were not successful. Despite this, following the success of Anna Lucasta the ANT became less community-centered. From then on, the ANT only featured plays from established white playwrights, and young actors viewed the ANT as a means to break into Broadway productions. Hattie King Reavis served as executive secretary of the group.  Goals  The ANT had four goals that they were governed by: *1) To develop a permanent acting company trained in the arts and crafts of the theatre that also reflected the special gifts, talents, and attributes of African Americans. *2) To produce plays that honestly and with integrity interpreted, illuminated, and criticized contemporary black life and the concerns of the black people. *3) To maintain an affiliation with, and provide leadership for, other black theatre groups throughout the nation. *4) To utilize its resources to develop racial pride in the theatre, rather than racial apathy.  Constitution  When the ANT was first founded in 1940, the group created a 30-page constitution for themselves that reflected the ideals of the Federal Theater Project. The constitution also drew upon W.E.B. Du Bois's belief that African-American theatre should be by, about, for, and near African-Americans. The following is an excerpt from the constitution: \\"A People's theatre is a very valuable institution. it provides the finest outlet for class emotions that can be organized. It serves as a spur to citizen ambition provides a partly self-supporting source of work and income, and a healthy kind of occupational therapy on a national scale for thousands. Unhappily, we have been trained to think of the theatre mostly in terms of commercial enterprise that is too expensive when it is worthy, and too cheap and boring when it is not. We know it too frequently as an investment for gambling show men, or as a playground for dilettantes and escapists who are unable to withstand the hard realities of life. We need a people's theatre which shall in effect be a national theatre. The people who want a theatre will have to organize it and pay a part of the expense for both its creation and support. Realizing the reluctance of the people to assume this responsibility, the essential burden of stimulating the development of such a project rests upon the shoulders of those individuals who are willing to assume this obligation, those who feel sincerely the call in a genuine quest for the content of theatre art, and by their talent, industry, and profound respect for a theatre they shall create.\\" (American Negro Theater Constitution, 1940)  Stage productions  *Hits, Bits, and Skits (1940) *On Strivers' Row by Abram Hill (1940) *Natural Man by Theodore Browne (1941) *Three Is a Family by Phoebe Ephron and Henry Ephron (1943) *Anna Lucasta by Philip Yourdan and Abram Hill (1944) *Garden of Time by Owen Dodson (1945) *Henry Christophe by Dan Hammersmith (1945) *Home Is the Hunter by Samuel Kootz (1946) *Angel Street by Patrick Hamilton (1946) *Juno and the Paycock by Se√°n O'Casey (1946) *You Can't Take It with You by Moss Hart and George Kaufman (1946) *The Peacemaker by Kurt Unkelbach (1946) *Tin Top Valley by Walter Carroll (1947) *The Later Christopher Bean by Sidney Howard (1947) *Rope by Eugene O'Neill (1947) *The Show Off by George Kelly (1947) *Rain by John Colton and Clemence Randolph(1947) *The Washington Years by Nat Sherman (1948) *Almost Faithful by Harry Wagstaff Gribble (1948) *Sojourner Truth by Katherine G.

Belafonte said that he saw his first show in the ANT when he was given two tickets as a gratuity when he was working as a janitor's assistant for Clarice Taylor, who was in the play that night.

It is administered as an intravenous injection to give animals a quick and humane death. Generics of this product are also available under the names Euthasol, Euthanasia-III Solution and Somnasol.  Composition  The two active ingredients, phenytoin and pentobarbital are present as salts of sodium. In addition, Rhodamine B dye is added to clearly distinguish the solution. Benzyl alcohol is added to slow bacterial growth, though this does not make the solution sterile. Euthasol has the following composition: 390 mg/mL pentobarbital sodium, 50 mg/mL phenytoin sodium, 10% ethyl alcohol, 18% propylene glycol, 0.003688 mg/mL Rhodamine B, 2% Benzyl alcohol, water and sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid as needed to achieve desired pH.  Mechanism of action  This drug combination causes painless and rapid euthanasia through multiple pathways, including brain death, cessation of breathing and circulatory collapse. Brain death is observed first. Breathing generally stops within seconds. However, euthanasia may be delayed in dogs that have deficient cardiac and circulatory function. The pentobarbital component produces anaesthesia and rapid unconsciousness. A lethal dose causes loss of medullary respiration and vasomotor function. The phenytoin component produces reduced central nervous system function and cardiovascular collapse, causing hypotension.  Veterinary use  When used to euthanize dogs, intravenous injection is preferred, though intracardiac injection may be used in some circumstances, for example, if the animal is very small animal, or comatose with impaired circulatory function.  Hazards  This product is hazardous both to humans and wildlife, whether due to accidental consumption (e.g. by scavengers eating a body of an animal euthanized with Phenytoin/pentobarbital), exposure to wounds, or accidental self-injection.  Society and culture  In the US, it is classified by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) as a Schedule III substance. US federal law restricts the drug to usage by, or on the order of, a licensed veterinarian.

History Simple Kid's approach to recording involved recording to an 8-track cassette player then fed into his computer where he applied more modern techniques to create finished songs. He mixed and mastered the tracks on albums 1 and 2 on his own equipment. His style of remixing and sampling has been compared to Fatboy Slim's, although Simple Kid used his own recordings as sources. More often his sound is compared to the similarly eclectic and deliberately ramshackle Beck. Simple Kid's influences included folk, country (he prominently featured banjos and slide guitar in his work), glam rock (particularly T. Rex) and late 1960s big pop arrangements of records, such as The Beatles's White Album. Before becoming Simple Kid, McFeely was a member of The Young Offenders. Forming when he was 17, the band was composed of a group of friends from Cork, Ireland. The group attempted to release an album in America but met with failure and broke up. Television appearances included Later... with Jools Holland, Late Night with Conan O'Brien, The Late Late Show and Other Voices on RT√â. He was also the subject of a Channel 4 (4 Play) short documentary and appeared on TFI Friday with The Young Offenders. His first album was also promoted extensively in the US by DJ Nic Harcourt on KCRW's daily radio program Morning Becomes Eclectic. His second album, 2, was released by Country Gentleman Recordings in October 2006 in the UK, and by Yep Roc Records in August 2007 in the U.S. 2 was included in Mojo Magazine's top 50 albums of the year, was CD of the week in The Times culture section and had positive reviews in the NME, The Guardian, Time Out and the Independent on Sunday. Rolling Stone also featured Simple Kid as a breakthrough act for 2007. The track \\"Lil' King Kong\\" from two was featured in a Saturn automobile advertisement in the US, as well as in an advertisement in the UK for the mobile phone operator Orange. \\"Lil' King Kong\\" also featured in the film, Jumper in 2008.

He joined the Portuguese Air Force in 1942 and trained in the United Kingdom and France. Between 1951 and 1954 he was posted at the NATO joint command headquarters, while between 1954 and 1957 he was posted in Goa (then under Portuguese control) to supervise the construction of Dabolim Air Port. Subsequently, he commanded the Fifteenth Squadron 'Reyes', based in Porto (1957-1962), and the Eleventh Bomber Regiment based in Angola (1962-1966). Later he was Military Attache to South Africa from 1966 to 1970, and served (1970-1973) as Military Attache to Brazil. In 1973 he became Commander of the Second Home Front Division.

The network, and most of its affiliates, were owned by Toronto-based Corus Entertainment. Stations The network had four co-flagships: *CFOM-FM 102.9 in Quebec City for Souvenirs Garantis Classic hits programming *CHMP-FM 98.5 in Montreal (officially licensed to Longueuil) for talk programming *CKAC 730 AM in Montreal for sports talk *CINF 690 AM Montreal for all-news radio Other stations included: *CFEL-FM 102.1 in L√©vis *CIME-FM 103.9 in Saint-J√©r√¥me *CJRC-FM 104.7 in Gatineau *CHLT-FM 107.7 in Sherbrooke *CHLN-FM 106.9 in Trois-Rivi√®res On February 5, 2009, it was announced that these four stations would introduce a classic hits music format similar to the one currently used at CFOM-FM 102.9 in Quebec City, effective March 28.http://www.newswire.ca/fr/releases/archive/February2009/25/c3601.html However, according to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) website, Corus intends to continue to operate those stations under a news/talk format for CRTC regulatory purposes, as the new music programming will air only from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. weekdays and 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekends.http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2009/2009-157.htm Stations not owned and operated by Corus Entertainment can also be affiliates, such as CKRS-FM 98.3 in Saguenay, CFYX-FM 93.3 in Rimouski, CHNC-FM 107.1 in New Carlisle and CFGT-FM 104.5 in Alma. CHRC 800 AM in Quebec City was previously part of the Corus Qu√©bec network, but the station was sold in 2008 by Corus to a group of local businessmen; it no longer has any links with Corus. CKRS-FM was sold in November 2010 to a local group, Radio Saguenay; it is unknown if any Corus Qu√©bec programming still airs on that station. Creation of Radiom√©dia The Radiom√©dia network was created to succeed to the now-defunct T√©l√©m√©dia and Radiomutuel networks, which merged on September 30, 1994. This merger resulted in six AM stations closing in Quebec on that very same day at 6 p.m. (Eastern Daylight Time), and is referred to in Quebec radio circles as \\"le vendredi noir\\" (\\"Black Friday\\"). The six AM stations closed were : *CJMS 1280 AM in Montreal (Radiomutuel) *CJRP 1060 AM in Quebec City (Radiomutuel) *CKCH 970 AM in Gatineau (T√©l√©m√©dia) *CJRS 1510 AM in Sherbrooke (Radiomutuel) *CJTR 1140 AM in Trois-Rivi√®res (Radiomutuel) *CJMT 1420 AM in Chicoutimi (T√©l√©m√©dia) In each case, the station with the best signal remained open and the other one was closed. While in most markets the station that remained open was also both the oldest and the more successful according to recent BBM ratings, this was not the case everywhere‚ÄîCJTR in Trois-Rivi√®res had recently surpassed CHLN in ratings for the first time in many years, and CKCH in Gatineau (opened in 1933) had much more of a history than CJRC, which opened only in 1968. The Radiom√©dia network, along with CKAC in Montreal and CHRC in Quebec City, were now owned in equal shares by Telemedia and Radiomutuel. Telemedia retained full ownership of CHLT in Sherbrooke and CHLN in Trois- Rivi√®res, while Radiomutuel retained full ownership of CJRC in Gatineau and CKRS in Saguenay. Both companies continued to compete against each other on the FM dial, with Telemedia still owning the RockD√©tente network and Radiomutuel owning the √ânergie network, this while both FM networks were now getting their news services from the Radiom√©dia newsrooms. Change to Corus Qu√©bec After Astral Media (successor to Radiomutuel) bought all Telemedia Quebec radio properties in 2001, it was forced by the Competition Bureau to sell their AM stations due to concentration of ownership concerns. After two failed attempts (see article on CKAC for more details), a deal with Corus Entertainment was finally approved in early 2005 and took effect in May of that year. Corus Entertainment, which already owned all-news station CINF (Info 690) in Montreal, promptly renamed Radiom√©dia as Corus Qu√©bec, and simultaneously dismantled the local CKAC newsroom, even though that newsroom was much more respected by listeners than the one from Info 690. News bulletins on the Corus Qu√©bec network were now provided by CorusNouvelles, which consists of the old Radiom√©dia team outside of Montreal combined with the Info 690 team in Montreal. Production of CorusNouvelles would shift to CHMP-FM in January 2010, following the closure of CINF and its English- language sister station, CINW 940 AM.CNW Newswire: \\"AM Info690 Montr√©al and AM940 Montreal's Greatest Hits to cease operation on January 29, 2010\\", January 29, 2010. Sale to Cogeco On April 30, 2010, it was announced that all Corus Qu√©bec stations, with the exception of CKRS, will be sold to Cogeco for $80 million, pending CRTC approval.

However, Cogeco must either apply with the CRTC for an exemption from the common ownership policy, or sell off some of these (or their own) stations as they will be over the maximum allowable number of stations in Montreal, Quebec City, and Sherbrooke. On June 25, it was reported that Corus has agreed to sell CKRS to Radio Saguenay, a local business group;Corus sells Saguenay station to local buyers , The Wire Report, 25 June 2010 the sale of that station was approved by the CRTC in November 2010. The sale of the Corus Qu√©bec stations to Cogeco has been approved by the CRTC on December 17, 2010, on the condition that Cogeco-owned CJEC-FM and Corus-owned CFEL-FM and CKOY-FM (since re-called CJTS-FM) be sold to another party by December 2011.

Written by Jed Seidel and directed by John Kretchmer, the episode premiered on UPN on April 12, 2005. The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a high school student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, Veronica investigates the persistent bomb threats at her school. Meanwhile, Keith (Enrico Colantoni) begins dating Alicia Fennel (Erica Gimpel), and Veronica's relationship with Logan (Jason Dohring) progresses. \\"Weapons of Class Destruction\\" introduces the romantic relationship between Veronica and Logan, a romance that would continue on-and- off throughout the series and its subsequent film adaptation. Series creator Rob Thomas did not originally envision this relationship, but he changed his mind when he saw the chemistry between the two actors and characters. The episode received positive reviews, with discussion focusing on Veronica and Logan's first kiss. The episode has been frequently cited as one of the best in the series.  Synopsis  Veronica is kissing Leo D'Amato (Max Greenfield) outside her house. After Veronica goes back into her house, Keith announces that he has begun dating Wallace's (Percy Daggs III) mother, Alicia, making things awkward between Veronica and Wallace. Veronica notices a sign outside which says \\"KillemAll.net\\". In class, there is a fire drill, and Duncan (Teddy Dunn) says that it is the third one this week. Veronica talks to Principal Clemmons about the fire drill issue, but he doesn't give anything up to her. Later, she notices police officers with service dogs going through the building. Veronica, posing as the superintendent, calls Principal Clemmons, who reveals that the school has experienced several bomb threats. She prints the story in the school newspaper, causing chaos at school the next day. Principal Clemmons calls her in again and tells her to stop printing stories. Veronica and Wallace talk to each other while Keith and Alicia watch a movie. Alicia tries to convince Wallace to accept their relationship to no avail. After talking to Mac (Tina Majorino), another student, Pete (Michael McMillian) approaches Veronica to say that he saw two students, Ben (Jonathan Taylor Thomas) and Norris (Theo Rossi) with exploding tennis balls. Wallace places the two students under more suspicion when he tells Veronica about them, and Veronica sees a mysterious timer. Duncan and Meg (Alona Tal) approach Veronica, and she tells Meg the general overview of a case where someone has been evading capture and all the tactics they used to do so before Duncan suddenly leaves. Wallace gives Veronica the student file on one of the two students, but his high school records are clean after bullying in junior high. The other student doesn't have a file. Veronica talks to Duncan, who says he knows about her investigation. Duncan scoffs at her findings before he realizes that she suspects him in the murder, reacting with extreme rage before dashing out of the room. Ben and Norris talk about guns and bombs, leading Veronica to track Ben, eventually seeing him buying fertilizer and taking out a rifle. Ben gets into the car and orders her to drive to the Camelot motel. There, Logan appears and beats him up before it is revealed that the \\"suspect\\" is actually an ATF agent. Ben says that he is investigating Norris, but needs her help: Norris has a crush on Veronica, and Ben asks her to get close to him. As she leaves the motel, Veronica and Logan kiss unexpectedly. Veronica gets an invitation to Norris's house, but she doesn't find any weapons. Veronica calls Mac to help her break into the WiFi before she sees Pete in front of the house. The ATF searches Norris's vehicle and finds fertilizer and a rifle, despite Veronica's convictions that he is not the perpetrator. However, Veronica recognizes them as being the same ones Ben was loading into his car earlier. Veronica calls Pete, and she tells him that she knows he falsely implicated Norris (with the help of the ATF agent) because of terrible bullying in junior high. Meg tells Veronica that Duncan has disappeared after removing $10,000 from the bank. The story involving Norris is published in the newspaper, and, although it leads to all charges against Norris being dropped, it also results in the new journalism teacher's (Joey Lauren Adams) termination.  Production  Series creator Rob Thomas did not intend for Veronica and Logan to become a couple. The episode was written by Jed Seidel and directed by John Kretchmer. This episode mark's Seidel's fifth and final writing credit for the series, after \\"Meet John Smith\\", \\"The Girl Next Door\\", \\"Silence of the Lamb\\", and \\"Mars vs. Mars\\". In addition, this episode is the second directing credit for Kretchmer, after \\"Silence of the Lamb.\\" The episode also explains the departure of journalism teacher Mallory Dent (Sydney Tamiia Poitier), who made her last appearance in \\"The Girl Next Door\\", also introducing Dent's replacement, Geena Stafford, who is subsequently fired in the same episode. The episode introduces a romantic relationship between Veronica and Logan through their first kiss. Originally, Veronica and Logan were not intended to be a couple. At PaleyFest 2014, series creator Rob Thomas stated that \\"The truth is, we never had any intention at all for Logan to end up with Veronica. [Dohring] was hired to be the obligatory psychotic jackass. In the writers' room, sitting around watching dailies, we would all gather around, and it was like, 'We want to watch that. We want to watch those two onscreen together.'\\" However, Dohring and Bell found out the plan for the two characters around the filming of \\"Return of the Kane\\" or \\"The Girl Next Door\\". On the reveal, Dohring said in an interview: \\"I‚Äôm actually glad, Rob told us about episode six or seven that we would get together. We were like, ‚ÄòNo way!‚Äô But there was something going on there. We could feel it as actors. It was damn cool ‚Äì these characters had some kind of connection. So we had to start to soften it up a little bit and break the ice somewhat [between the characters]. I‚Äôm glad he gave us that heads up.\\" Lead actress Kristen Bell expressed surprise over the initial decision by saying, \\"I love working with Jason and he's such a great actor to work opposite, but sometimes, I feel it's really just weird luck. Somehow people get magic dust sprinkled on them and you don't know why. You look like you have boatloads of chemistry with someone else.\\" On the kiss itself, Dohring noted, \\"It was so funny, as an actor, to kiss this girl. I was all nervous beforehand. But you have to just let it go for the scene. It was so fun to watch [later when it aired],\\" adding that \\"a lot of that emotion was real for me.\\" The song \\"Momentary Thing\\" by band Something Happens plays during Veronica and Logan's first kiss. Series creator Rob Thomas, was not content with the kiss scene, writing that it was not how he envisioned it. \\"I wasn't actually pleased with the first Veronica/Logan kiss. Now, I may have been wrong on this front, but it wasn't what I imagined, or really what I think was described in the script. The line of description called for Logan to \\"devour\\" Veronica. I wanted it to be‚ÄîI don't know if sexual is the right word, but‚Äîhungry, or a release, or mixed with some self-loathing and confusion. Instead, it came off as singularly romantic.\\"  Reception  = Ratings = In its original broadcast, the episode received 2.30 million viewers, ranking 114th of 120 in the weekly rankings. = Reviews = The episode received primarily positive reviews, with critical attention mostly going to Veronica and Logan's relationship. Price Peterson of TV.com gave the episode a positive review, noting that \\"[o]bviously the most notable aspect of this episode was the Logan-Veronica hookup. Again, it seemed really sudden, but in the sense that they are both mercurial teenagers it seemed right, particularly when they didn't know how to handle themselves afterward.\\" Television Without Pity gave the episode a \\"B+\\", writing that \\"[Veronica] kisses Logan! You heard me! How could you not, with all the exclamation points!\\" Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, gave a mixed review. While calling the case-of-the-week \\"predictable\\", the reviewer also called Keith and Alicia's new relationship \\"perhaps the most fun\\" part of the episode. In addition, Kaiser commented on Veronica and Logan's relationship. \\"I'm not entirely sold on the relationship, either from a character point of view or a quality point of view. Obviously it's just a kiss in the heat of the moment‚Ä¶but it doesn't seem to have much motivation beyond [that].\\" IGN placed the episode 2nd in its list of the top ten Veronica Mars episodes, second to only \\"Leave It to Beaver\\". The publication praised the new Logan-Veronica dynamic and said \\"The few episodes just before this one showed the softer, vulnerable side of Logan and just when you wonder if he's really so bad, he saves the day and an innocent peck turned into a passionate embrace.\\" E! reacted to the scene by writing, \\"We seemed to experience the same whirlwind of emotions they did: The hesitance, the shock, the elation, the weirdness of how right it felt, and then, of course, the inevitable 'Oh crap, what did we just do and what does this mean?' awkwardness of it all. They, and the show, would never be the same. In the best way possible.\\" Buzzfeed ranked the episode as the 4th best Veronica Mars episode, behind \\"A Trip to the Dentist\\", \\"Leave It to Beaver\\", and \\"Not Pictured.\\" TV Line ranked the episode 6th on a similar list. Give Me My Remote ranked \\"Weapons of Class Destruction\\" as the fifth best episode of Veronica Mars, particularly noting the kiss scene between Logan and Veronica. \\"Veronica kisses Logan in a scene that was full of so much chemistry that it gave me chills. The episode ends with Veronica figuring out that Ben was setting Norris up, but, honestly, who was really paying attention at that point? Veronica and Logan had finally realized that their chemistry was undeniable!\\" Kimberly Roots, writing for TV Line, responded to the kiss scene by stating, \\"What got me ‚Äì and still gets me ‚Äì about this kiss is how much fire it has. This isn‚Äôt a drunken, convenient hook-up. This isn‚Äôt a let‚Äôs-see-how-this-goes peck. This is two people acting on years of something unacknowledged between them. We get a long moment of LoVe in action before they break apart and realize what just happened.\\" Entertainment Weekly called \\"Weapons of Class Destruction\\" one of the \\"10 essential episodes of Veronica Mars\\".

The two met while Roddenberry was making The Questor Tapes. He showed a great interest in the story, and was going to contribute to the series that was planned to follow. However, the project fell apart due to Roddenberry's conflicts with the studio. Though Roddenberry considered the series to be dead, the concept stuck with Wright, who had hopes that it could be revived. When the rights finally fell back to the Roddenberry family in the 2000s, Wright secured the option to the property and set out to produce the series, updating it while still staying true to Roddenberry's vision.

According to Variety, the movie was one of the top-grossing films of 1935. The supporting cast features Robert Armstrong and Barton MacLane. G Men was made as part of a deliberate attempt by the Warners to counteract what many political and business leaders claimed was a disturbing trend of glorifying criminals in the early 1930s gangster film genre. Although the gangster films were typically presented as moral indictments of organized crime where the criminal protagonist inevitably died, they nevertheless depicted a life of freedom, power and luxury enjoyed by gangsters in the midst of a real-life economic crisis. Foremost of these films were Little Caesar, the original Scarface, and perhaps the most memorable, The Public Enemy, in which Cagney portrayed street tough Tom Powers, the role that catapulted him to stardom. What was deemed most objectionable about these films was that law enforcement was typically portrayed as either impotent in the face of crime, or, as with Public Enemy, akin to a derelict and largely absentee father shirking his duty. Based on this interpretation, G Men supplanted the criminal protagonist with the heroic federal police officer. Most prints of this film include a brief prologue added at the beginning for the 1949 re-release (on the FBI's 25th anniversary). This scene depicts a senior agent (played by David Brian) introducing a screening of the film to a group of FBI recruits so that they may learn about the Bureau's history. Plot Newspaper ad for G Men making a connection between the film and real-life G Men in the FBI, who were tracking kidnappers in the Pacific Northwest. One year after graduation, New York City lawyer James \\"Brick\\" Davis (James Cagney) has no clients because he refuses to compromise with his ideals and integrity. His friend Eddie Buchanan (Regis Toomey) tries to recruit him as a federal agent or \\"G Man\\" (government man), but Davis is unsure. However, when Buchanan is killed while trying to arrest a gangster, Davis changes his mind, determined to bring the killer to justice. He bids farewell to his mentor, \\"Mac\\" MacKay (William Harrigan), a mob boss who financed his education to keep Davis on the right side of the law. He bids farewell to Jean Morgan (Ann Dvorak), the star of MacKay's nightclub who has feelings for Davis. Davis travels to Washington, D.C. to begin his training. A mutual dislike forms immediately between him and his instructor, Jeff McCord (Robert Armstrong) which eventually subsides as time passes, but not before McCord openly mocks and derides Davis' attempts at training . However, Davis is attracted to McCord's sister Kay (Margaret Lindsay) which strengthens his determination to remain passive despite McCord's efforts to rile him. Meanwhile, MacKay retires and buys a resort lodge out in the woods of Wisconsin. His men, free of his restraint, embark on a crime spree. Hamstrung by existing laws (federal agents have to get local warrants and are not even allowed to carry guns), the head of the G-Men pleads for new laws to empower his beleaguered men. They are enacted with great speed. Davis identifies one of the perpetrators, Danny Leggett (Edward Pawley), by his superstition of always wearing a gardenia. Not having completed his training, he can only give agent Hugh Farrell (Lloyd Nolan) tips on Leggett's habits. Farrell tracks down and arrests his quarry, but he and some of his men are gunned down, and Leggett escapes. McCord is put in charge of the manhunt and given his choice of five agents. He picks Davis, a decision that later pays dividends when Jean is brought in for questioning, Davis learns she is now married to Collins (Barton MacLane), one of the crooks. She inadvertently lets slip that the gang is hiding out at MacKay's lodge (against MacKay's will). In the ensuing wild shootout, Davis kills MacKay, who was being used as a human shield. Before he dies, MacKay forgives his distraught friend. Davis then tries to resign from the department but McCord talks him out of it by reminding him that McKay's death wasn't his fault and asks him to stay on. Only Collins gets away. McCord and Davis go to Jean's apartment to warn her. Jean is not there, but Collins is, and shoots at them. Davis pushes McCord out of the way and takes a bullet meant for him. Collins gets away. Davis ends up in the hospital (where Kay is a nurse) for his shoulder wound. Collins kidnaps Kay to use as a hostage. Jean finds out where he is hiding and telephones Davis, only to be shot by her husband. Davis bolts from his hospital bed, has some final words for the dying Jean, sneaks inside the garage and rescues Kay. Collins is shot to death by McCord as he tries to drive away. Kay escorts the still-bandaged Davis back to the hospital, vowing to \\"handle your case personally.\\" Cast James Cagney in G Men Reception In 2008, the American Film Institute nominated this film for its Top 10 Gangster Films list. =Box Office= According to Warner Bros records the film earned $1,143,000 domestically and $820,000 internationally.

The film opened in limited distribution in April 2007 in the US, was released in the United Kingdom and Ireland in August 2007, but went directly to DVD in most other markets.IMDb: Wind Chill - release dates Retrieved 2013-01-03 Plot A female student (\\"the girl\\") at a Pennsylvania university uses the campus ride share board to find a ride home to Wilmington, Delaware for Christmas. She joins a male student (\\"the guy\\"), who is driving home to Wilmington. His older car is in poor condition, with the trunk full of his possessions as he has been kicked out of his apartment. It soon becomes apparent that she is arrogant and asocial. He seems to know quite a lot about her, stating that they have a class together, although she has never noticed him. They stop at an isolated gas station, as the girl wants to use the bathroom. As the girl has just applied her pedicure, the guy offers to piggyback her to the store. While in the restroom, the girl is locked in and hears the guy and the clerk talking about how they hear her banging the door. After the girl manages to unlock the restroom door, she angrily scolds him for not helping her. Both the guy and the clerk are left puzzled over the girl's rant. The girl simply dismisses their responses and proceeds to ask the guy to leave. Before they leave, the girl hears the guy asking the clerk for directions, although he claimed to have driven the route many times. Setting off, he soon turns off the main highway down Route 606, a lonely snow-covered road through a wooded ravine which he claims is a short cut. She tells him to return to the main highway, but he refuses because in the earlier scenes, the girl while talking on the phone claimed she was bored driving on the highway hence the guy decided to drive through a scenic detour - the infamous route 606 where crosses, apparently roadside memorials, can be seen on either side of the road. As night falls, headlights come towards them in the middle of the road. The oncoming driver does not slow down, causing the guy to swerve, half burying their car in a snow drift. The guy observes that the oncoming car, which did not stop, has left no tire tracks in the snow. While the guy walks back to the gas station, the girl sees a dark figure stagger past the car. She calls out, but it ignores her. The guy returns, saying the gas station is closed, but she does not think he has been gone long enough. Huddling in the car, the guy reveals that he had been watching her for some time. As he didn't have \\"a line or a game\\", and even though he just lives ten minutes away from campus, when he saw a chance to get her alone for 6 uninterrupted hours after he saw her texting about the ride share in class, he took it. He saw the car ride as a romantic gesture, leading him to post the notice offering a ride to Wilmington. In the car, they notice a number of black-clad figures walking past the car and call after them, but they do not stop. Their faces are white and dead-looking. The guy follows them up the slope into a ruined building where they disappear. He finds frozen corpses half buried in the snow inside and also a newspaper. Meanwhile, the girl sees the lone figure again and when she touches it, burning her hand, it turns round to reveal a bloated corpse. They think help has arrived when a Pennsylvania Highway Patrol cop knocks on their window. He does not seem to understand their predicament, choosing instead to believe they were \\"parking\\". He takes the girl to the back of his patrol car, which is clearly not a modern vehicle. When he violently pushes her into the car, the guy hits the cop with a tire iron. They jerk awake, thinking it was all a dream, to find that the guy has the tire iron frozen to his frostbitten hands. The girl realizes that he was badly injured in the crash when she sees a bottle of pee with blood in the backseat. She proceeds to question the guy and he admits that he realized that himself en route to the gas station. He further admits he did not reach the gas station because he started spitting up blood. The newspaper from the ruined building is dated 23 December 1953, telling of an accident in which a young couple and a cop were killed when their cars crashed into a ravine on this road. Retired priests from a nearby home gave them the last rites. They realize that the cop is a ghost, the black-clad figures are the dead priests and the speeding car which caused them to swerve was driven by the ghostly cop. The cop keeps reappearing, always heralded by Brenda Lee's \\"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\\" on the car's radio. The girl drifts in and out of consciousness, becoming in her dreams the many other people the cop has killed. She proposes an idea to the guy to use his telephone,from his trunk of belongings, to call for help from the junction box on a nearby telephone pole. The guy seems resistant as he is concerned over her safety and they agreed on a warning system: when song appears on the radio he will honk the horn and she'll return. Before she leaves, he says \\"You know what I'll do different? ... Next time I will just walk up to you after class and say hi\\". She smiles and replies, \\"You should, definitely do that\\". They kiss before he calls out \\"Wait....\\" as the girl reassures him \\"I will be right back\\" and she leaves. She climbed up the telephone pole, connects the telephone and reaches 911, but is not sure they could hear her. Returning to the car, she finds that the guy has died. She cries out \\"You knew I was coming back\\" as she had him in her arms for the final time as a black figure is seen walking past the car. The girl then carries the guy out of the car and leaves him along a side the road. From afar the girl sees headlights approaching her. Thinking that it is the same car (i.e. driven by the ghostly cop) she hurriedly attempts to open the faulty car door but to no avail. Turns out a snow-plow driver came in response to the girl's reported incident (i.e. the 911 call went through). The girl heaves a sigh of relief as the snow-plow driver puts the guy's body on the back and calls her to get in the vehicle. While driving he tells the girl that, in the early 1950s, a corrupt cop murdered people on this stretch of road and their bodies were never found. In 1953 he ran a young couple off the road, but lost control and also died in the ravine. Frequently, around this time of year, more people die on this road. In 1961, the priests were found frozen to death in their beds. The plowman sees headlights and believes more help has arrived. Instead, the ghostly cop runs them off the road, causing the plowman to swerve in order to avoid him. The girl knew what was going to happen and she prepares for it by buckling her seat belt. True enough the swerve causes the snow-plow truck to tumble. In spite of that, the truck is not stuck; but, despite the girl's pleas, the driver gets out to help the ghostly cop not knowing who he is dealing with. The girl follows him and the pair see the two burning cars from 1953 down the ravine. They see the priests walk down to the trapped cop, but instead of helping him they pull the microphone from his police radio, leaving him to burn to death. His burned body crawls out and touches the plowman, who instantly freezes to death. She runs towards the truck and tries to start the truck, but the ghostly cop reappears. The ghost of the guy appears and hits him with a tire iron, saving her. As dawn breaks, she jerks awake and realized she is back in the car, with the guy's body next to her and there is no sign of the truck. She screams in despair but moments later the guy's ghost appears and leads her up the hill as he says, \\"I would have told you everything eventually... It will be okay, it will just be a sweet funny story we have\\" referencing back to the conversation they had while he confessed his motive for driving the girl back to Delaware. The guy leads the girl through the ruined priests' home and to the gas station, where he disappears. The girl finds herself back at the gas station. Ending scene - fire trucks, ambulance, police cars and the girl are back at route 606. The coroners are loading the guy's body on the coroner van as the girl wrapped in a blanket watched from the ambulance. A paramedic is attending to her hand injuries. She takes out her phone, looking at a picture of the guy she took earlier after he had gotten angry (because she complained over the phone about her boredom and the long journey ahead). Tears began forming in her eyes - screen turns black.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1936 to 1941. Wright was born in Eugenia Falls, Ontario, and was educated in Emerson, Manitoba and at Wesley College in Winnipeg. He worked as a customs broker. Wright also saw action in World War I, serving with the 29th Battalion of the C.E.F. from 1914 to 1919 as a machine-gunner. He first ran for the Manitoba legislature in the 1927 provincial election as a Liberal candidate in Emerson. He finished second to Progressive candidate Robert Curran, losing by 139 votes. Wright later aligned himself with a group of Liberals who opposed the party's 1932 alliance (and subsequent merger) with the Progressives. He campaigned in the 1936 provincial election as a Liberal Independent, and defeated Curran by twenty votes. Only one other Liberal Independent was elected, and Wright served on the opposition benches for the next four years. In 1940, Wright endorsed the all-party coalition government created by Liberal-Progressive Premier John Bracken. He campaigned for re-election in the 1941 election as an official Liberal-Progressive candidate, but lost to pro- coalition independent John Solomon by 701 votes.

Childhood Beatrice was the second eldest daughter of King Henry III of England and Eleanor of Provence. Beatrice's childhood was plagued by tragedy, and the stresses of her father's reign coupled with her mother's unpopularity with the English people. Her oldest brother Edward became dangerously ill when she was very young. Though he recovered, Beatrice's youngest sister Katharine died at a very young age leaving Beatrice's parents grief-stricken. Katharine, who possibly had a degenerative disease that had caused her to become deaf, died at the age of four. The English were unhappy with King Henry III owing to the influence that Eleanor and her Savoyard kinsmen exercised on the monarchy, and the Barons demanded more power. In 1263, Eleanor was sailing on a barge that was attacked by London citizens. This harsh, bitter dislike created several problems for Henry III and his family. On the other hand, Eleanor and Henry enjoyed a happy marriage, and Beatrice grew up in a loving environment, close to her siblings. Marriage and issue At one point, Henry conducted negotiations for Beatrice to marry the king of France and also rejected a proposal that she should wed the son of the King of Norway. On 22 January 1260, when she was seventeen, she married John de Dreux, heir to the duchy of Brittany. She and John II had six children: * Arthur II, Duke of Brittany (1261‚Äì1312) * John of Brittany, Earl of Richmond (1266‚Äì1334) * Marie of Brittany, Countess of Saint-Pol, wife of Guy III of Ch√¢tillon (1268‚Äì1339) * Pierre, Viscount de Leon (1269‚Äì1312) * Blanche of Brittany, wife of Philip of Artois (1271‚Äì1327) * Eleanor of Brittany, Abbess of Fontevrault (1275‚Äì1342) is an ancestor of Anne of Cleves through her daughter Blanche of Brittany. Beatrice Death Beatrice died on 24 March 1275 in London, England. Her death was once said to have occurred in childbirth, but the dates do not bear out this theory, which has been disproved in several articles. John II honoured his wife with a chantry, an institutional chapel on private land or within a greater church, which was to be finished when he died, so that he and Beatrice would be together again. Beatrice was buried at Grey Friars Church in Greenwich, London.Her burial is recorded in the London Greyfriar's register: Her husband succeeded as duke 11 years after her death, therefore Beatrice was never styled Duchess of Brittany. Historical overview Though little information is available concerning Beatrice's activities, she was an important part of English history. Her marriage to John II helped forge an alliance with France, thus placing the Earldom of Richmond under the so-called shield of England. During Henry's reign, there was much opposition to him in England. At a time when Simon de Montfort wanted to strip the king of some of his power to give more say to the barons, it was necessary for Henry to strengthen his rule via family marriages to useful people. His first daughter had married the King of Scotland, and Beatrice's marriage to John II, who controlled the Earldom of Richmond, gave Henry an additional source of power. Moreover, a substantial number of French nobles came to England and could be appointed to political positions. When Henry was crowned, very few areas within the Angevin Empire (comprising Gascony, B√©arn, Angoul√™me, Saintonge and Agenais), remained loyal to Henry. The marriage of Beatrice and John II would prove to be useful for Henry III, if only to help Henry recover Poitou. Now Henry had English security and influence on the northern border, and the instance on English overlordship. Though Henry was planning on regaining Poitou, he was defeated after his campaign. Because he could not regain Poitou, his domains were small compared to the Angevin Empire. With his various strategies, Henry III reigned over England for 56 years until his death in 1272.

Written by Dayna Lynne North and directed by Nick Marck, the episode originally aired on UPN on April 19, 2005. The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a high school student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, a student named Mandy (Claire Titelman) hires Veronica to help find her lost dog. Meanwhile, the Echolls family deal's with Trina's (Alyson Hannigan) domestic abuse, and Weevil (Francis Capra) gets arrested for breaking into the Kane home.  Synopsis  Veronica tutors Weevil in math. Weevil tells her that the word is that Duncan (Teddy Dunn) ran off because she told Duncan that he killed Lilly. Meanwhile, a girl, Mandy, loses her dog, Chester. The next day at school Logan (Jason Dohring) tells Veronica that he has no idea where Duncan went. Mandy talks to Veronica about her dog, and she agrees to help. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) tells Veronica that Weevil broke into the Kane house the previous night and was found in Lilly's (Amanda Seyfried) bedroom. Veronica visits Weevil who says that he broke in to steal back a ring he gave to Lilly. Trina talks to Aaron (Harry Hamlin) before Logan comes in and makes sarcastic comments. A lawyer appears and says that Lynn did not include Aaron and Trina in her will, while she gives Logan $115,000 and other assets. Veronica and Mandy visit the pound, but according to a classmate, Hans, the pound hasn't found the dog. Later Hans calls Veronica from the pound and tells her that Chester had been hit by a car on the highway the previous day. The next day, Veronica notices that the board near the beach is now covered with lost dog notices and deduces that dog notices with expensive rewards got their dogs back, while the others did not. Celeste (Lisa Thornhill) walks into Mars Investigations and she blames Veronica for her family's problems. Veronica tells Celeste that she'll tell her what happened with Duncan (even though she doesn't know) if the Kanes drop the charges against Weevil. Veronica posts a fake lost dog notice as bait. Logan finds out that Trina is a victim of domestic violence. Wallace tells Veronica that their parents were making out last night. Veronica gets a lead on the lost dog notice and she sends Wallace to take care of it. Wallace meets a Spanish- speaking man and Veronica secretly places a tracker on him. Veronica tracks the man and he and his friends say that they get the dogs from a \\"dog man.\\" Veronica enters a mysterious van, but Hans, the owner, denies any involvement. Weevil walks up to Veronica, indicating that he was released under Celeste's orders. Logan asks Veronica for help in tracking down Trina's boyfriend, Dylan. Aaron, seemingly oblivious, asks Trina to bring her boyfriend over that night. Veronica finds out that the man's name is Dylan Goran (Jeff Parise), who has been put under two restraining orders recently by ex-girlfriends. Dylan comes over to the house. Suddenly, Aaron grabs Dylan and starts to beat him up. Eventually, Dylan is helpless on the ground before Logan and Veronica arrive. Logan and Veronica escort Dylan to his car and he drives off the premises. Logan and Veronica talk about Lilly and Weevil, but Veronica doesn't know who she actually cared about more, but she does know that Lilly loved Logan. After talking some more, Veronica and Logan kiss again and decide to start secretly dating. Veronica talks to Mandy and they decide to visit the pound to report Hans. Veronica breaks up with Leo and reveals that she kissed Logan. However, they decide to remain friends and Leo helps them get an official search for the pound. After opening a locked door, they find all the \\"lost\\" dogs. After Mandy tases Hans, he reveals that Chester is not dead‚Äîhe was sold when they couldn't get a ransom. Later, Veronica finds out from Leo that Weevil was not just looking for a ring‚Äîhe was stalking Lilly. Keith tells Veronica that he already knew this, but had been ruled out due to an airtight alibi. Mandy and Veronica visit the woman who had bought Chester. Veronica confronts Weevil about breaking into Lilly's room; he wasn't looking for a ring, he was looking for a \\"secret message pen\\" Lilly used to have. He gives the pen to Veronica, but the pen is empty and he is evasive when Veronica asks if the pen had a message in it when Weevil found it.  Cultural references  A variety of cultural references are made in the episode: *Mandy is reading Forever by Judy Blume. *Aaron says that Los Angeles Lakers coach Phil Jackson gave him the novel Siddhartha to read. *Logan imitates Yoda. *Hans references One Hundred and One Dalmatians. *Weevil mentions Get Out of Jail Free cards from the board game Monopoly. *Trina compares Aaron's would-be role in Dylan's film to John Travolta's character in Pulp Fiction. *After watching Aaron beat up Dylan, Logan says \\"Father knows best,\\" a reference to the radio and television show of the same name.  Arc significance  *Weevil breaks into Lilly's room and steals a pink \\"spy pen\\" that Lilly used to hold secret messages. He gives it back to Veronica, but it's empty. *Keith discreetly takes hair samples from Veronica in order to test her DNA in relation to his. *Aaron's violent nature is highlighted. *Logan's claims of being abused by his father as a child are made more likely by Aaron's behaviour. Also, Aaron himself remembers being beaten and abused by his own father during childhood.  Music  In addition to the series's theme song, \\"We Used to Be Friends\\", by The Dandy Warhols, the following music can be heard in the episode: *\\"Marc\\" by Louis XIV *\\"That's Amore\\" by Dean Martin  Production  The episode features several recurring characters, including Trina Echolls (Alyson Hannigan), Celeste Kane (Lisa Thornhill), Lilly Kane (Amanda Seyfried), Leo D'Amato (Max Greenfield), and Aaron Echolls (Harry Hamlin). The episode was directed by Nick Marck and written by Dayna Lynne North and marks Marck's fourth directing credit and North's third writing credit. The title of \\"Hot Dogs\\" is a play on the kind of food, as the case-of-the-week of this episode deals with dogs. Two of the dogs seen on the noticeboard during the episode, named Shakes and Lola, are also the names of two of lead actress Kristen Bell's dogs, who are both Corgi mixes.  Reception  = Ratings = In its original broadcast, the episode received 2.48 million viewers, ranking 108th of 116 in the weekly rankings and marking an increase in 180,000 viewers from the previous episode, \\"Weapons of Class Destruction\\". = Reviews = The episode received critical acclaim. Price Peterson, writing for TV.com, gave the episode a glowing review, particularly praising the Echolls family subplot. \\"This was a real good episode, just chock-a-block with entertaining moments.

In Greek mythology, Aba was a nymph and she is presumed to be a daughter of the river Hebros. The site is now occupied in part by modern √áatalca.

The Crimean War caused a mass exodus of Crimean Tatars towards Ottoman lands. A few Crimean Tatars settled in √áatalca. In the First Balkan War the Bulgarian army had driven the Turkish forces back from the border, but the Turkish forces retreated to the prepared positions at √áatalca where on 16‚Äì17 November 1912 they defeated the Bulgarians at the \\"First Battle of √áatalca\\".Hall, Richard C.

Upon expiration of the armistice, on 3 February [O.S. 21 January] 1913, hostilities recommenced and the Second Battle of √áatalca began. It was a series of thrusts and counter-thrusts by both the Ottomans and the Bulgarians and lasted until 3 April 1913. There were a large number of journalists who reported on the military actions at √áatalca, whose accounts provide rich details about this event.

In an unsigned agreement these airbases were to be operated by the United States Air Force for the specific purpose of attacking North Vietnam with some 500 airplanes. These bases were supplied by a Naval Base near the deep-water port of Sattahip. Many American military specialists were assigned to JUSMAG-THAI in Bangkok. As many as 45,000 US military personnel were stationed in Thailand. History The RTAF command structure consists of headquarters and five groups, which are: command group, combat group, support group, education and training group, and special services group. During the 1960s Thailand experienced one of the most rapid growth rates among developing countries: more than 10% per year in GNP, and about 8% per year in real output. The First National Economic Development Plan (1961-1966) was successfully implemented. US grant economic assistance totalled about US$500 million through the end of 1970. Direct military assistance totalled another US$800 million for the same period, continuing at the rate of US$25‚Äì55 million per year. According to US government statistics, between 1950 and 1987 the US provided Thailand with more than US$2 billion in military assistance. The vast nature of this enterprise enriched Thailand at every level of society, enabling a jump in indigenous heavy construction, communications, transportation, and defense. The following categories are found in United States Government Accountability Office catalog summaries: locomotives, aeronautical ground services, Bangkok-Saraburi Highway, southern roads, development loans, technical support, civil police, village radios, agricultural development, rural health, potable water, malaria eradication, rural electrification, Chiang Mai Medical School. Additionally, there was the construction of of all-weather roads in the north and northeast, requiring 138 bridges and culverts, costing US$11 million (US$174,000 for maintenance equipment; requiring the training of 199 personnel (36 mechanics, 6 supply specialists, 97 equipment operators, 60 drivers)). War's end The end of the war resulted in all US personnel and equipment being removed by 1976 at Thai request. The Royal Thai Air Force found it too costly to operate any but Khorat and Takhli. Many of the others were turned over to the Department of Civil Aviation. *(RTN) U-Tapao International Airport-----12 41' N, 101 00' E *Ubon Ratchathani---------15 15' N, 104 52' E *Khorat (Nakhon Ratchasima) ------- *Khon Kaen----16 28' N, 102 47' E *Udon Thani ---------17 23' N, 102 47' E *Takhli------- *Nam Phong----16 39' N, 102 58' E *Nakhon Phanom------17 23' N, 104 39' E Summary of US aid The following data is taken from what appears to be a working paper summary of the United States Operations Mission (USOM) in Thailand dated 1968, found at the Cornell University Library \\"Pamphlet HC Thailand 370\\" 3-1924-007-619-574.

The company is responsible for the delivery of mail in Russia, and the issuing of postage stamps. Russian Post employs about 390,000 people and has over 42,000 post offices, with its headquarters in Moscow. In 2012 the Russian Post delivered more than 2.4 billion pieces of mail and accounted for more than 54 million parcels and more than 100 million in remittances. In March 2013 a presidential decree signed by President Vladimir Putin included the Russian Post in a list of so-called strategic enterprises. Russian Post owns 49.99% of the \\"Pochta Bank\\" (formerly Leto-Bank). Postal services in Crimea are handled by a separate company, Post of Crimea. History A 1958 stamp of the Soviet Union depicting a 16th-century mail courier, issued for the 100th anniversary of Russian postage stamps =Early history= Records mention a system of messengers in the 10th century. Early letters were carried in the form of a roll, with a wax or lead seal; the earliest known of these seals dates from 1079, and mentions a governor Ratibor of Tmutarakan. The earliest surviving cover was sent in 1391 from La Tana (now Azov) to Venice. By the 16th century, the postal system included 1,600 locations, and mail took three days to travel from Moscow to Novgorod. In 1634, a peace treaty between Russia and Poland established a route to Warsaw, which became Russia's first regular international service. =Russian Empire= A Russian Empire postman Peter the Great enacted reforms making the postal system more uniform in its operations, and in 1714 the first general post offices opened in Saint Petersburg and Moscow. ‚ÄúRegular post service‚Äù was established along the Moscow and Riga routes. In February 1714, the postal service started biweekly runs from St. Petersburg to Riga; in June of that year it started runs from St. Petersburg to Moscow. The field post office was founded in 1716, and the so-called ordinary post service in 1720, for fast conveyance of state ordinances and papers. Regular delivery of private parcels (the so-called heavy post) was organized in the 1730s and ‚Äô40s. In 1746, parcels and private correspondence were first delivered by courier, and starting in 1781 money, too, could be delivered to one's door. The earliest known Russian postmark dates from July 1765; it is a single line reading \\"ST. PETERSBOVRG\\" (in Latin letters), but the first official recommendation to use postmarks did not come until 1781. First Russian stamp, 1857 Post coaches appeared in 1820. In 1833, the St. Petersburg City Post was created, and the city was divided into 17 districts with 42 correspondence offices located in trade stores. In 1834, reception offices appeared in the suburbs (in St. Petersburg there were as many as 108). Delivery of printed periodicals was organized in St. Petersburg in 1838. The Department of Coaches and T-carts was opened in 1840 at the Moika Embankment; light cabriolets carried surplus-post, coaches delivered light post, and T-carts dealt with ‚Äúheavy\\" post. Green street mail boxes were installed in 1848, the same year stamped envelopes were issued; orange mailboxes for same day service appeared near railway stations in 1851, with the first prepaid postage stamps appearing in 1857. In 1864, the City Post started sending printed matter and catalogues, and in 1866, they sent packages. Post and telegraph office in Vladivostok, built in 1897-1899 Postal stationery made its first appearance in 1845, in the form of envelopes that paid the 5-kopeck fee for local mail in St. Petersburg and Moscow. The idea worked well, and was extended throughout Russia on December 1, 1848. Local postal systems used stamps referred to as Zemstvo stamps, from the term for local government begun under Alexander II in 1864.See, for example, . Russian Post is a founding member of the Universal Postal Union created in 1874. In 1902 Chief Postal Service was made part of the Internal Affairs Ministry and in 1917 under the Provisional Government it became part of Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs. =Soviet Union= A post office in Svapushche, Tver Oblast During the World War II, known in Russia as the Great Patriotic War, Soviet postal service was a part of the People's Commissariat for Communications of the USSR. It delivered up to 70 million parcels per month to the Soviet Army front from the rear under extremely difficult and often very dangerous conditions. In the postwar years, mail service has undergone quantitative and qualitative changes. In 1946, the People's Commissariat for Communications was transformed into the USSR Ministry of Communications. Postal service has been carried out by the Post Office, which was part of the Ministry of Communications, along with other offices of telecommunications industries. By 1950, the postal industry, destroyed by the war, was restored to the pre-war level. Post office in Voronezh In subsequent years, the network of communication enterprises was significantly expanded, especially in rural areas. In the cities a network of liaison offices, post offices and subordinate communication centres was established, combining postal, telegraph and telephone services into a single entity, with offices typically located in the same building and under single management. A huge network of mailboxes was established, installed not only in cities but also in rural areas, stations, railway sidings and at highway intersections. Further development of the postal service followed the path of mechanization and automation of mail processing, improving the organization of its transportation and delivery. For this the old postal equipment was modernized, along with development of mechanized mail processing and handling machines and equipment for container transport and postal inventory, as well as equipment for customer service. =Russian Federation= Stamps with the logo of Russian Post. In 1993 Russian Post became a part of Ministry of Communications. In 1995, the office was reorganized as the Russian Federation Postal Service, and in 1996 it was reorganized into the Department of Post in the Ministry of Communications of the Russian Federation. Russian postal enterprises had operating and commercial independence, but with strong competition from former partnering telecommunication companies. Despite the separation of industries, a unique postal network, established in prior periods and covering almost all localities in the country, has been preserved. Given the role of the Russian post in the historical development of the state, in 1994, Russian President Boris Yeltsin established the professional holiday of postal workers - \\"Day of the Russian Post\\", which is celebrated annually on the second Sunday in July. Another presidential decree in 1997 restored the heraldic traditions of Russian Post with the adding of the emblem and flag of Russia. =Loss of monopoly= In 1996, the Ministry of Communications for the first time decided to end the state postal monopoly on some postal services, resulting in Russia having commercial mailing companies. =2002 reform= A mailbox in Lipetsk Since the Soviet Union dissolved, the Federal Postal Service consisted of a network of 90 disparate entities which were mainly listed as state institutions or federal state unitary enterprises. In legal terms, they were completely independent concerns. They were linked to the Federal Postal Network only by a trunk intrazonal and inter-district transmission and delivery system. Different parts of the same system, connected by a single mechanism in adjacent regions, were in outright competition with each other, trying to lure corporate clients away from other competitors even if it involved an operating loss. There were no uniform budgeting, planning or other processes. These companies operated using outdated postal facilities representing as many as 50 different IT solutions in terms of industry technology. In accordance with the concept of restructuring the federal postal service, adopted by the government decree on 28 June 2002, the postal industry in the Russian Federation carried out the reorganization, aimed at creating a unified, efficient and competitive company ‚Äî the Federal Unitary Enterprise Russian Post ‚Äî able to make a significant contribution to the solution of urgent problems while accelerating development of the economy. By 2005 the reform was completed. =Post-reform period= In 2004 Elsag Datamat won the tender to build Russian Post's first automated sorting centre. In 2008, Andrey Kazmin, former CEO of Sberbank was appointed to the CEO of the company. In January 2009 it was announced that Kazmin was to leave his position as CEO of the Russian Post due to a financial crisis from ambitious but poorly implemented reforms. From 2009 until his ousting in the 2013 reforms the General Director was Aleksandr Kiselyov. The current CEO of Russian Post is Dmitry Strashnov. =Growing inefficiency in the 2010s= UAZ-3909) The early 2010s saw a rise in complaints. The number of parcels from foreign online retailers had been rising steadily for several years and was certain to rise further. According to Russian Post's own estimates, orders from Internet retailers are delivered to Russia mostly in ordinary or registered parcels; in 2009 there were 2.3 million, by 2012 the number had soared to 17 million. On March 6, 2012, five trucks from Germany were in queue to be unloaded at Vnukovo International Airport. At the International Post Office, 12,300 parcels, 5,300 EMS packages, and 36,000 minor incoming parcels had piled up. Another 2,000 parcels were waiting for customs clearance at Sheremetyevo International Airport. In 2012 a group of people dissatisfied with the state of affairs established the website \\"anti-Russianpost.ru\\"; its goal was to allow users to highlight instances of disappointing or unsatisfactory service from Russian Post. In the middle of March the clients of on-line retailers launched a massive spam attack on the Moscow office of the Roskomnadzor watchdog. In this period the company received up to 1,000 messages from individuals with complaints about delayed deliveries of purchases made at Internet shops. =2013 collapse and reform= In March 2013 Russian Post reported the unfavourable state of affairs. In a special message Russian Post's deputy general director, Nina Fetisova, told the Federal Communications Agency Rossvyaz and the Federal Customs Service that the processing of international mail was in a critical situation at the customs posts Vnukovo and Sheremetyevo International Airport and also at the Central International Post Office in Moscow. The director of the federal postal services of the Vologda Oblast said: \\"The reason for delays is not our own ineffectiveness, but the pressure of social factors. We have too many official functions: the delivery of pensions, of written correspondence, and subscriptions to newspapers and magazines\\". In order to improve the services, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev signed a government decree to take the Russian Post out of the sphere of competence of the Federal Communications Agency Rossvyaz, and subordinate it directly to the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media. Also, On April of that year, the General Director of the Post, Alexander Kiselyov was ousted from the office. The company's new management, in October 2013, declared an ambitious goal of doubling revenues to make the company ready for an initial public offering in 2018 by allowing it to provide banking services, reducing the number of unprofitable branches and focusing on providing deliveries from on-line retailers. In order to handle the growth of parcels, production capacity has been expanded at regional exchange centres, with the company opening new international mail processing centres in Moscow at the Kazan station and in Yekaterinburg and Novosibirsk. In addition, Russian Post agreed with foreign postal operators on pre-sorting international mail delivery by region while the mail is still in the sender's country (pre- sorting began in China, the largest source of Russian imports), which allows a reduction in the delivery time of international mail. For example, after opening an exchange centre in Yekaterinburg, a parcel from China to Sverdlovsk can be delivered in five days, including all customs clearance. In August 2013 Russian Post had launched its first regional flight in the far eastern Russian republic of Yakutia. The company held a ceremony at Yakutsk Airport to launch its second new airmail plane under a programme to expand links to remote areas, its first being a flight in the Khabarovsk Krai territory on Russia's east coast. Russian Post deputy director general Alexei Skatin said: \\"The mail must be delivered on time despite the difficult geography of the region. We are starting to improve the postal logistics in the remote regions of Russia\\". =2014‚Äì2018 development program= In late October 2013 Prime Minister Medvedev generally approved the Post's development program in a meeting with Minister of Communications Nikolai Nikiforov. Among its goals are to turn the Russian Post from a model of \\"subsidized postal operator\\" to \\"self-sustaining postal business\\", modernization of its logistics infrastructure and making its work more efficient. Companies will create eight main hubs with automated sorting and direct exchange with each other. The service area of each hub will be about a 700-km radius. The number of branches in the cities will grow, while the placement of new areas will be determined by regulation. In rural areas, there will be new formats of work: \\"letter carrier plus internal transport,\\" according to the reform. This is expected to reduce the number of unprofitable offices from 14 thousand to about 8.5 thousand, most of which are in rural areas. Also discussed in the draft is non-discriminatory access to the infrastructure of the postal service. In December 2013, the government published its draft Federal Law on Postal Communications, which is expected to be approved in Spring of 2014. In that year Russian Post was to begin deploying a unified ERP system ‚Äî a set of integrated applications that allows creation of a single environment to automate planning, accounting, control and analysis of all core business operations across the enterprise. In September 2013 Deputy Minister of Communications Mikhail Evrayev said that one of the major problems of the Russian Post was the lack of a unified information system working both at the central office and at all branches. On March 6, 2016 the Russian Post launched a new website. Structure A post office in Sochi Russian Post includes:–ü–æ–¥—Ä–∞–∑–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –∞–ø–ø–∞—Ä–∞—Ç–∞ —É–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è * central administrative apparatus, consisting of 22 units (Directorate departments, the Secretariat); * 87 branches; * 41,901 post offices. Enterprise branches are divided into 82 territorial control federal postal service and 5 specialized, which include: * The main centre-haul mail - FSUE \\"Russian Post\\"; * EMS Russian Post; * Automated sorting centres - branch office of Russian Post; * Hybrid mail centres - branch office of FSUE Russian Post; * Russian Post - FSUE Russian Post in Berlin. Branches are separate structural subdivisions, including post offices, a department for transportation of mail, and mainline and regional sorting centres. Operations Russian Post offers all traditional mail services in its 42,000 offices. In addition it offers to cash payment cards, accept utilities payments, execute cash transfers, receive and pay off consumer loans, and to sell lottery, rail, flight and theatre tickets. It also retails various products including phone cards, envelopes and, of course, postage stamps. In October 2012 the Russian Post had launched SMS notification for domestic shipments, and since December 2013 in a pilot program, Moscow clients of the Russian Post began to receive free SMS notification of passage of parcels from abroad. According to the postal operator, a notice will inform the customer about the admission of international mail at the point of issuance and will complement the traditional paper notices. In the future, the Post plans to inform the customer via SMS about all stages of the passage of parcels including delivery in Russia, customs control and admission to point of delivery. =Pochtomat= Pochtomat In late 2010 a new delivery method with automated machines called Pochtomat () which is a combination of the words \\"–ø–æ—á—Ç–∞\\", \\"post\\" in Russian, and automat, came into use. In 2011 number of those postmats were deployed in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. In April 2013 the first Pochtomat began working in Saransk and in the summer of 2013 first Pochtomat in the South Urals began in Chelyabinsk. Automatic issue of shipments is made under a special code that the recipient receives via cell phone as an SMS. By June 2013, Russian Post operated 145 Pochtomats in 60 cities. =Financial services= In August 2013 Russian Post began accepting loan payments on behalf of any Russian bank. Repayment of loan is made by postal transfer to a subsidiary of the Post, –û–û–û \\"Rapid\\", then the money is sent by bank transfer to the appropriate bank. Postal employees themselves complete a payment form for the customer, then the postal order form is printed and signed by the customer. For the usage of postal services, operators charge a fee of 1.9 percent, with a minimum of 50 rubles. =Postal kiosks= In 2011 the Russian Post launched postal kiosks based on the results of a pilot project. This began in 2011 with seven stalls of 6 square meters each. Besides sending and receiving regular and express mail, insurance and credit cards can be issued, loan payments can be made, payments for cellular communication, Internet and utilities and the purchase of railway and flight tickets. In September 2013 the Russian Post management decided to radically revise its approach to retail, and in particular refused to sell food in the offices. It was decided to expand the idea of postal kiosks, and even entered the draft of a new strategy of development of the Russian Post until 2023, which was prepared by Boston Consulting Group. In 2014 the Russian Post plans to open 10-15 new kiosks in Moscow and another 150 in other regions. =Mobile post= Beginning in the 2010s Russian Post began using Mobile Post Van, also called \\"Post on Wheels\\" () which drive with driver and post seller into remote villages where the Post office was closed due to being ineffective (small rural communities), and provides all the post services that were once were in the post office. =Regional sorting center= Russia's first automated regional sorting center opened in Podolsk, near Moscow in late 2009, using equipment of Italian company Elsag Datamat, SpA. In June 2011 another center was opened, in Saint Petersburg, which serves the Leningrad, Novgorod and Pskov Oblasts. =International exchange points= Russian Post operates 13 points of customs clearance of postal items. Until 2013, the Moscow MMPO processed up to 80% of all incoming international shipments to Russia which created much stress on the Russian Post. In order to speed up the time for delivery of international parcels, the Russian Post opened two new international postal exchange points in Yekaterinburg and Novosibirsk. The latter one can process up to two thousand international EMS- daily departures, with an area more than 2,000 square meters. The Yekaterinburg Koltsovo international postal exchange point is the first international postal exchange in the Urals Federal District. It can handle up to 20,000 parcels and small packets per day in the 3,700m facility. Until the end of 2014 Russian Post expects to reduce the Moscow point of exchange share to 55%. In addition there are exchange points in Bryansk, Samara, Orenburg, Petrozavodsk and Vladivostok. Foreign cooperation In 2009, a first formal cooperation agreement came between the Russia and Italy to work together to develop the postal system in Russia. On late November 2013 Russian Post and Poste Italiane have signed a new agreement to cooperate further in order to improve the Russian postal system. The agreement, which was signed along with their technology supplier Selex, was sealed at a trade summit in Trieste during an official visit of Russian President Vladimir Putin, following up earlier agreements between the three companies.

It is located near the district of Bakƒ±rk√∂y. The mayor is B√ºnyamin Demir (AKP). History G√ºng√∂ren is hard to distinguish from its neighbouring districts in the industrial area north of the E5 highway, districts such as Merter or the poorer parts of Bah√ßelievler. Like them it has seen a rapid and uncontrolled influx of migrants from Anatolia since the 1950s. In 1955 this was an open space with a small village named Vidos on it. Then a main road out of the city to the west was put through here and people began to build houses near the road. Most were built illegally. Today there are 237,000 crammed into a tight mass of cheap apartment blocks. The district was the site of the 2008 Istanbul bombings. G√ºng√∂ren today The housing districts of G√ºng√∂ren are slightly older and better established than other districts of 1980s migrants to the city, such as Esenler or Baƒücƒ±lar, but still consist of narrow streets lined with six or seven-storey apartment buildings with no space between them. The difference is that the buildings are slightly better-maintained and there are more shops in the streets. But still standards of living are low. Other parts of G√ºng√∂ren are faceless, nameless poorly lit muddy roads lined with factories. Crime is a problem. Certainly the industrial estates are not welcoming after dark. Lately, the municipality has started to improve the infrastructure, and has extended the tram from Zeytinburnu to improve the transportation in and out of the district. Sports The Tozkoparan Olympic Swimming Pool is one of the four Olympic- size swimming pools in Istanbul. Reaction to Recep ƒ∞vedik We are uneasy that our district is being mentioned by a character like ƒ∞vedik, proclaimed Abdullah Yƒ±lmaz, president of the Youth Council for G√ºng√∂ren District, in response to the release of the film Recep ƒ∞vedik 3 featuring a \\"red neck\\" comedy character portrayed as residing in the district, G√ºng√∂ren is a district where educated and intellectual people live. It is not right to associate G√ºng√∂ren with an impolite character who does not know any manners, he continued before stating that the council would take action to prevent the district from being mentioned in a fourth film in the series.

It has about 60 students per grade. It is part of a series of schools founded by Dr. Bruce Saari. \\"International\\" in the school's name reflects an international focus in curriculum, and it is not an international school in the usual sense. ICS is a choice school, for which an application must be submitted, and is not part of the Lake Washington School District middle-to-high school feeder system. All complete applications are entered into a lottery to select those who will be admitted. In the event that there is space available in excess of the applications submitted by in-district students, applications by out-of- district students are allowed. In recent years, there have been over 800 applications for the 65 or more spots available yielding a chance of less than 10% to be admitted. The school offers an integrated six year Humanities/International Studies core curriculum, as well as Art for 5 years, instead of the regular no art/LA/SS(Language Arts/Social Studies). Each year also has rigorous Science and Math classes. Additionally, students study Spanish, for at least four years, with the intention of achieving fluency. All classes in 9-12 grade are Honors or AP classes. The curriculum is fixed and the same for all students until Junior year when there is one elective, and Senior year when there are 4 electives. Every year in May students go on a theme-based Focus Week where they enrich themselves through travel or local activities, leaving \\"the confines of the classroom to expand their knowledge\\". The mascot for ICS is the Phoenix, and the motto is \\"Forever We Rise\\". Rankings The International Community School has been recognized as one of the best high schools in the United States, public or private. In every year since it was founded, ICS students have achieved top-tier scores on national and state achievement tests like Washington Assessment of Student Learning (WASL) test, the High School Proficiency Exam (HSPE), and Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (SBAC). 100% of students participate in AP classes with essentially all students receiving passing grades. As a result, ICS has been ranked among the top high schools in the United States in multiple rankings. From 2007 to 2014 it was selected as a Gold Medal School, ranking between 10th-30th out of the top 100 schools in US News' Best High School list. In 2014, the International Community School was ranked 13th in the nation by U.S. News & World Report. From 2008 to 2014, Newsweek selected ICS as one of the Public Elites, one of the best high schools in the U.S. In the 2012 OECD PISA evaluation, ICS was ranked as the number 1 school in Math, number 4 in reading, and number 7 in Science of all U.S. high schools participating in the evaluation. In 2005, it was selected as a No Child Left Behind‚ÄîBlue Ribbon School of Excellence.. In 2019, U.S. News & World Report ranked ICS as 76th among all high schools in the United States. Location The school is located in Kirkland, Washington, a suburb of Seattle, Washington, and serves students from the Lake Washington School District. History =Founding= The school was proposed to the Lake Washington School District by parents in 1997 and its program and policies were developed by Dr. Bruce Saari who modeled it after the Bellevue International School, where he had been program developer the previous six years. Up until July 2011, Cindy Duenas was the principal of ICS.. After the 2010-2011 school year, Duenas left to help start the new STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) school for the Lake Washington School District. She was replaced by Dr. Matthew Livingston in 2011. He was replaced in 2014 by Dr. Gregory Moncada. Moncada was replaced in 2017 by Margaret Kinney. In 2014, Andrya Packer, one of the school's humanities teachers, was selected to complete a Fulbright Scholarship in Scotland. =Expansion to modern facilities= Beginning in 2011, plans for the construction of a new 63,925 square foot building to replace the former building were created by the school's faculty and the school district. Construction of the adjacent new building began in June 2012 and finished in August 2013, prior to the start of the 2013-2014 school year. The old building was destroyed and replaced by the current soccer field and parking lot. The new facility sits on 11.2 acres of land and cost $18 million to build., LWSD Archives, Retrieved 06 June 2015 In September 2013, students entered the school with modern classrooms and laboratories. The new school includes a centralized commons nicknamed \\"The Lyceum\\" for school assemblies, theatrical performances and for use as a cafeteria. Later in the new building's first school year, bleachers were installed in the commons for better seating for the upperclassmen. The entrance to ICS' old building The old ICS building moments before demolition Admissions and enrollment =Prior to 2012= Because of the limited enrollment, before 2012 students were chosen from applicants from Lake Washington School District's 7th grade class by lottery, and there were limited opportunities for transfer into higher grades after being put on a waitlist. After the school district moved from a K-6 elementary school system to a standard K-5 elementary school in Fall 2012, which changed the admissions of ICS to be in 6th grade. The school has a grandfather clause allowing for students who are members of founding families or who had sibling in the first class of the school to be admitted without going through the lottery system. =Introduction of 6th graders= Beginning from the 2013-2014 school year and coinciding with the larger change among the school district, 6th graders were given admission to ICS. The application process and lottery were moved upward for 5th graders, and the waitlist process remained the same. There are currently only about 30 of the original students from the first 6th grade class left (there were originally over 60). They were the first ones to go to a 6th grade day camp. The same year ICS introduced a 6th grade class, a time capsule was made and was set to be opened 100 years later. =Demographics= As of 2014, ICS had an enrollment of 373 students, with minorities consisting of 47% of the total student body. The total demographic of the school can be broken down into the following: * 53% Caucasian * 36% Asian * 4% Hispanic * 0% Pacific-Islander * 7% Two or More Races The ratio of male students to female students is 46:54. Academics The school has a student-teacher ratio of 23:1, with 19 full-time teachers, and has a 98% graduation rate. =Focus Week= Every May, ICS sends its students outside the classroom environment for a week to \\"explore concepts outside those normally encountered in schools\\". Students select the Focus Week that they have interest in and are placed in a small group to meet with throughout the school year. Each group is assigned a faculty adviser who helps plan, organize, and schedule the itinerary for the week-long education experience. Focus Weeks this year include international trips to Greece, Japan, the Netherlands, and Iceland, domestic trips including New York and The Grand Canyon, and local trips, such as Circus Arts, Teacher's Assistants, Seattle International Film Festival, and Blue Ribbon Cooking. Student life =Student government= The student body of the International Community School is represented by the Associated Student Body, a group of elected who serve the student body in three key areas: facilitating dialogue between the students and the faculty, improving the quality of student life through school-sponsored events, and managing the oversight of the school's extracurricular activities. The vision of the Associated Student Body is as follows: \\"Members of the ICS ASB are servant leaders whose purpose is to build and strengthen a sense of community for all members of the ICS family. Our purpose is not just to do events, but also to live as leaders\\". =Extracurricular clubs= ICS has a variety of clubs, ranging from pre- professional clubs to drama. The school offers various honor societies, including the National Honor Society, the National Science Honor Society, and the National Art Honor Society. Students must have at least sophomore status to apply and acceptance is given based on a student's academic achievements (at least 3.0 GPA for NHS). ICS has a local Key Club (Kiwanis Empowering Youth) chapter. The program is an internationally recognized high school youth-based organization which provides opportunities for its members to become involved in the community by volunteering and serving in areas that need assistance. The ICS Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) chapter, one of the largest chapters in Washington, is recognized as a State Gold Seal Chapter. Students perform in regional, state, and national competitions that range from Economics to Graphic Design to Business Communications, and has a history of competing well. The chapter has won numerous individual and team awards on the local, state, and national level. To subsidize traveling costs to competitions, FBLA hosts fundraisers such as Tolo. Such events along with service projects allow members to gain confidence and skills required for future careers. FBLA is open to 9th-12th graders. The International Community School Mock Trial team allows students to simulate realistic jury trials. Combining debate with drama, the club prepares two 15-person teams for competitions at the regional and state level. In recent years, the Mock Trial team has continuously placed in the Top 5 at the state level. The club teaches hard-working students about civil liberties, public speaking, legal reasoning and impromptu problem-solving. While the school does not have a debate team, students who are interested in debate are encouraged to join the Model United Nations club. The club is a simulation of the United Nations that aims to educate participants about civics, effective communication, globalization and multilateral diplomacy. Every year, a delegation of students travel to compete in conferences. Many former ICS students have received honorary recognition in their part of the diplomacy simulation. A Drama program is offered after school. It produces between two and four performances a year. In 2013, a CODE Club was established to encourage young students to become more involved in computer science and programming. This has been successful in conjunction with the addition of the school's AP Computer Science program. 2015 saw the establishment of ICS' Authors' Society, a writing club meant to help students with the basics of storytelling and creative writing. Their partnerships with the Gender Sexuality Alliance (GSA) and Technology Students' Association (TSA) have yielded several publications, which provide club members with both an incentive to share their work and to make sales for the benefit of clubs and social causes. =Sports= ICS is not part of the KingCo high school division for sports and does not have any sports teams. Since ICS accepts any student in the Lake Washington School District, it is prohibited from sports competition. Should students choose participate in sports, they can do so at their \\"home school\\" (the Lake Washington School District neighborhood high school that corresponds with their home address.)

Written by Phil Klemmer and John Enbom and directed by John Kretchmer, the episode premiered on April 26, 2005 on UPN. The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a high school student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, Veronica investigates a situation involving a girl, Carmen (Natalia Barron), who is being blackmailed by her boyfriend with an explicit and revealing video. Meanwhile, Veronica and Logan's (Jason Dohring) relationship slowly becomes public, and Veronica receives some important information regarding her sexual assault case.  Synopsis  A girl named Carmen breaks up with her long-term boyfriend, Tad (Jeff D'Agostino). However, before he leaves, Tad shows her a phone which has some embarrassing video of her that she doesn't even remember when she was drunk. Veronica agrees to help retrieve her phone. Later, Veronica and Logan make out in the bathroom. Veronica and Tad both have their phones confiscated, but only Veronica gets hers back, indicating that Veronica stole it, which she did. Keith (Enrico Colantoni) notices an ad for $50,000 for the whereabouts of Duncan Kane (Teddy Dunn). The two start on the project of finding Duncan before Keith has to leave on a date. Carmen enters Mars Investigations and smashes Tad's phone, but Tad instant messages Veronica with the video again. Tad and Carmen get back together (though it is strongly implied that he is blackmailing her). A student mocks Tad for his supposed homosexuality, even though he wants to join the Navy (referencing Don't Ask, Don't Tell, which was in effect at the time). Veronica talks to Carmen again, and she has a new plan, which involves Carmen inviting Tad to a romantic walk on the beach. Weevil (Francis Capra) informs Veronica that Duncan bought a cheap car shortly before he ran away. Logan and Veronica go back to his house before Aaron Echolls (Harry Hamlin) awkwardly comes in. While Veronica is in the bathroom, Logan's friends Dick (Ryan Hansen) and Beaver (Kyle Gallner) come, leaving Veronica to escape. Aaron attempts to be helpful by giving her a ride home and returning her purse, and Aaron is generally supportive of Veronica and Logan's relationship. At the boardwalk, Carmen asks Tad to talk to Seth, an openly gay student, while Veronica takes pictures. Keith gets a lead on Duncan's stolen car, which is in Tijuana, Mexico, but Duncan does not have it. Veronica talks to Mac (Tina Majorino) and asks her to create a \\"sexually explicit website\\" involving Tad. Veronica and Carmen talk to Tad, who show him the recently created website, and Veronica says she will send the website to the Naval Academy if he doesn't break up with Carmen and deletes the video of Carmen. Logan invites Veronica on a date out, indicating that he wants to make their relationship public. Logan also says that he thinks that Aaron likes her. Veronica notices an ad in the newspaper, which says that they are seeking Lianne Mars (Corinne Bohrer), who has just been put under a notice of legal proceedings in the classified section. Veronica looks up how soon the situation with her mother is happening (which is in under an hour). Veronica tracks Keith in order to find out what the ad was for, and she follows him to a hotel before finding him with Alicia on the ballroom dance floor. At school the next day, Veronica and Carmen find out that Tad has released the video of Carmen. Veronica suggests sending the incriminating email in retaliation, but Carmen refuses to oblige with her request. Veronica takes a look at a screenshot from the video and notices the same lanterns as Shelly Pomroy's house, where she was drugged and raped a year earlier. Mac talks to Veronica about a passport she found of Roberto Nalbandion, who lives in Argentina and is likely an alias for Duncan. Veronica enlists Mac's help in time-stamping the date of the video, and it turns out that it was the same night of Veronica's rape. Clarence Wiedman (Christopher B. Duncan) confronts Alicia Fennel (Erica Gimpel) about her relationship with Keith, who tells her about Wallace's (Percy Daggs III) bugging of his office. Veronica gets Weevil and the biker gang to tie Tad to the flagpole, and she tells him that she knows about the roofies the night of Shelly Pomroy's party, where she was raped. He says that Logan gave him the drugs, which were not roofies, but GHB. At their date, Logan waits alone.  Cultural references  The episode's cultural references include: *A stuffed figure of Garfield can be seen. *Veronica says jokingly that Keith and Alicia play Bingo at Veterans of Foreign Wars on their dates. *Veronica says \\"Okely-dokely,\\" a reference to the character Ned Flanders from The Simpsons. *Veronica's teacher mentions a tin can telephone. *Keith says \\"money for nothing,\\" referencing the Dire Straits song of the same name. *The episode mentions the website eBay. *Carmen and Veronica reference the action drama film Top Gun. *Tad calls Seth Boy George. *Carmen compares her situation to that of the Star Wars Kid. *The episode mentions that Duncan aced his PSATs. *The episode makes strong references to Don't ask, don't tell.  Arc significance  *Keith discovers the Kanes are offering $50,000 to find Duncan. *Mac finds out that Duncan bought an Argentinian passport for himself. *Keith runs a missing persons notice in the paper for Lianne Mars, so that he will be eligible for divorce, which Veronica notices. *Clarence Wiedman shows Alicia Fennel the bug Veronica planted in his office and tells her to break-up with Keith or she will be fired. *Carmen can't remember the night of the party where Tad taped her. It was the same night that Veronica was raped. *Tad Wilson, while taped to the flagpole, admits that he used GHB on Carmen Ruiz and that he got it from Logan.  Music  The following songs can be heard in the episode: *\\"Gold Rush\\" by Kissinger *\\"Me and You and a Dog Named Boo\\" by Lobo *\\"Finding Out True Love is Blind\\" by Louis XIV *\\"Tu Abandono\\" by X. Herrera *\\"Let's Sail Away\\" by Josh Kramon and Jeff D'Agostino *\\"Love Is Here to Stay\\" by George and Ira Gershwin (performed by Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald *\\"Crimson and Clover\\" by Tommy James and the Shondells\\"  Production  \\"M.A.D.\\" features the first appearance of Cassidy Casablancas, portrayed by Kyle Gallner (pictured), who would later become a series regular in the second season. This episode was originally titled \\"Tit for Tad\\" before being changed to the current title of \\"M.A.D.\\" This episode features the first appearance of character Cassidy \\"Beaver\\" Casablancas, portrayed by Kyle Gallner, who was later promoted to starring status in the show's second season along with his brother, Dick Casablancas (Ryan Hansen), who also appears in the episode. The character was created so that Dick would have a younger brother who was the complete opposite of him. In the episode, Carmen likens her situation to that of Paris Hilton, who guest starred earlier in the season (the episode \\"Credit Where Credit's Due\\") as Logan's then-girlfriend, Caitlin. The episode's title is an acronym for Mutually assured destruction, a military doctrine that two sides who have stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction will be hesitant to attack each other in fear of a Nuclear holocaust. The character of Duncan (Teddy Dunn) does not appear in this episode despite being in the opening credits. The episode was co-written by Phil Klemmer and John Enbom. The episode marks Klemmer's fourth writing credit and Enbom's third writing credit (after \\"Lord of the Bling\\" and \\"Ruskie Business\\"). The episode was directed by John Kretchmer, featuring his third directing credit for the show (after \\"Silence of the Lamb\\" and \\"Weapons of Class Destruction\\".) Among the episode's many guest stars are several of the important recurring characters of the season, including Mac (Tina Majorino), Clarence Wiedman (Christopher B. Duncan), Alicia Fennel (Erica Gimpel), and Aaron Echolls (Harry Hamlin).  Reception  = Ratings = In its original broadcast, \\"M.A.D.\\" received 3.04 million viewers, ranking 100th of 113 in the weekly rankings. This episode marked an increase in 550,000 viewers from the previous episode, and it also is the second-highest rating of the series's first season (after \\"The Wrath of Con\\"). = Reviews = Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, gave the episode a positive review, praising Veronica's involvement in the main storyline. \\"Veronica is a few steps ahead of everyone in the main investigation. Going into the show, I figured that Veronica would be fairly active as a character‚Äîyou'd have to be to investigate mysteries‚Äîbut I am a bit surprised by how much she is the driving force of the main plot.\\" However, he also wrote that \\"There is no moral judgment attached by the show to Carmen's inaction, unlike Mandy last week.\\" Television Without Pity gave the episode an \\"A+\\", its third such rating for the series (after \\"An Echolls Family Christmas\\" and \\"Clash of the Tritons\\"). Conversely, Price Peterson of TV.com gave a negative review, criticizing the episode's treatment of homosexuality. \\"Are you effing kidding me with this homophobic B.C.? I realize this was 2005 which is definitely OLDEN TIME, but to have our heroine use homosexuality as a weapon against someone?

G-man is also a term used for members of G Division, essentially a British anti-rebel police unit operating out of Dublin Castle prior to Irish Independence in 1922. Colonel Ned Broy uses the term in his official testimony for the Irish Army's Bureau of Military History in their archive of the Easter Rising (1916) & the Irish War of Independence (1919‚Äì1921). Origins and use in media *According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, the term \\"G-man\\" was first used in the year 1928. *The earliest citation in the Oxford English Dictionary for the American usage of the term \\"G-man\\" was in 1930, from a biography of Al Capone by F. D. Pasley. *The nickname may have originated during the September 1933 arrest of the gangster George \\"Machine Gun\\" Kelly by agents of the Bureau of Investigation (BOI), a forerunner of the FBI. Finding himself unarmed, Kelly supposedly shouted, \\"Don't shoot, G-men! Don't shoot!\\" *The term was the basis of the title for the 1935 film G Men, starring James Cagney, which was one of the top-grossing films of that year. *Curly Howard is referred to as a \\"G-man\\" in the 1936 Three Stooges short film A Pain in the Pullman. *Kelly's surrender is dramatized in the 1959 film The FBI Story. The encounter with Kelly is similarly dramatized in the 1973 film Dillinger. The film was followed by a 1974 television film titled Melvin Purvis: G-Man. *The Spanish Rock band Hombres G got its name in 1983 from the Spanish translation of \\"G-man\\" and after the James Cagney film G Men. *In the video game franchise Half-Life, introduced in 1998, one of the main characters is a \\"sinister interdimensional bureaucrat\\" called G-Man, who speaks in a cryptic manner and places the main character Gordon Freeman into stasis at the end of the first game. *The 2011 film J. Edgar includes a reference to the surrender scene in the 1959 film The FBI Story. *In the 2011 film X-Men: First Class, Charles Xavier refers to his team as the \\"G-Men\\", but Moira MacTaggart states that they are something different, and decides to name the team \\"X-Men\\". Charles finds the name amusing and keeps it. *In the 2013 video game Grand Theft Auto V, government agents encountered throughout the game are occasionally referred to as G-men.

As such, most of his pieces are centered on his concept that \\"the human body is obsolete\\". Until 2007 he held the position of Principal Research Fellow in the Performance Arts Digital Research Unit at Nottingham Trent University in Nottingham, England. He is currently furthering his research at Curtin University in Western Australia. Performances Parasite: Event for Invaded and Involuntary Body, at the 1997 Ars Electronica Festival Stelarc at the Concordia University, Canada, in 2010 Stelarc's idiosyncratic performances often involve robotics or other relatively modern technology integrated with his body. In 26 different performances he has suspended himself in flesh hook suspension, often with one of his robotic inventions integrated. His last suspension performance was held in Melbourne in March 2012. In another performance he allowed his body to be controlled remotely by electronic muscle stimulators connected to the internet. He has also performed with a robotic third arm, and a pneumatic spider-like six- legged walking machine which sits the user in the center of the legs and allows them to control the machine through arm gestures. In 2020, a work by Stelarc entitled Reclining Stickman, a robot sculpture operated by the artist, featured in the Adelaide Biennial of Australian Art at the Art Gallery of South Australia (AGSA). However, AGSA had to temporarily close from 25 March 2020 owing to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, so some of the exhibits are being shown online, along with virtual tours of the exhibition. Stelarc performed with his sculpture in real time, as well as making the videorecording available. Third ear In 2007, Stelarc had a cell-cultivated ear surgically attached to his left arm.‚ÄúPerformer gets third ear for art‚Äù BBC News. 11 October 2007 His longtime collaborator, fellow Australian artist Nina Sellars, photographed this body modification for her piece Oblique: Images from Stelarc's Extra Ear Surgery. Pieces by both artists were included in a group exhibition that received an exhibition review in scientific journal BMJ. Works In 2005, MIT Press published Stelarc: The Monograph which is the first extensive study of Stelarc's prolific work. It includes images of performances and interviews with several writers including William Gibson, who recount their meetings with Stelarc.Smith, Marquard and Clarke, Julie Joy (2005) Stelarc: The Monograph.

Participants bet amounts of alcohol on one of four aces, much like bettors would bet money on horses at a racing track. The game requires a standard deck of playing cards.  Preparation  The horseracing game requires active participation by only one person: the announcer. The announcer prepares the field by searching through the deck, taking out the ace (horse) of each suit, and laying them face-up and side by side at one end of the table (these are \\"the gates\\"). They then shuffle the deck and lay out a variable number of cards face-down (these form the \\"links\\" of the race) in a straight line perpendicular to the row of aces. The cards thus appear to form an \\"L\\" or the two legs of a right triangle. The field is now set. Betting Before the game begins, each player makes bets based on their horse being as simple as \\"five on diamonds\\" but can get as complex as any true horse race such as Trifectas, Exactas, Daily Doubles, and others. In another variation, players may simply pick their favorite horse, and the payout is set at 20 drinks for the first-place horse, 15 for second place, and 10 for third place.Drinking Game: Horse Race description at Barmeister.com Placing a small bet on the \\"first horse out of the gates\\" is a popular bet that excites the crowd early. Penalties may be applied to bettors who bet on an ace that never leaves the starting gates. Safeguards are often instituted to prevent players from placing exorbitant bets such as \\"one hundred on hearts.\\" Such safeguards may include setting bet limits, requiring players to drink a portion of their bet before the race begins, or forcing losers to drink a portion of their bet at the end.Horse Racing description at Pinky McDrinky.com Variations exist including: *Winners distribute drinks equal to the amount they bet or double *Winners become immune to drinking. Gameplay Once all bets are in, the announcer begins the race. He flips over the top card of the remaining deck. Only the suit of this card matters; the ace of that suit moves forward to the first link. The announcer narrates the ebb and flow of the game as the betters cheer on their horse. The announcer continues flipping cards and advancing horses accordingly until one horse wins by passing the final link into the winner's circle. Variations Another variation is Faltering. Each time a horse moves up to a new link for the first time (and only the first time), the announcer flips over the card on the side of that link. The suit shown on this sideboard card must move back one space (falter).Horse Race Drinking Games Rules and Directions at DrinkingGames.com Thus in an eight-link horserace, there are eight instances of faltering that can totally change the outcome of the game. As a rule, any horse in the gates can not be knocked back any further by faltering. Another variation is Stumble in which all horses except the leader move forward one space if a designated wild card is flipped over, such as the Joker.

Kines is perhaps best known for being the first filmmaker to employ crowdfunding to partially finance a film. Biography Kines grew up in Cupertino, California. In 1989, he began studying film and experimental animation at California Institute of the Arts and graduated in 1992 with a BFA in film, with emphasis in experimental animation. After graduating, Kines moved to Los Angeles and began working full-time as a graphic designer, including a four-year stint at Paramount Pictures in Hollywood where he worked as art director for the official Star Trek and Entertainment Tonight websites.  Foreign Correspondents and the dawn of crowdfunding  In 1996 Kines began writing what would become his first feature film, Foreign Correspondents. The film went into production in 1997, was released in 1999, and received distribution in 2001. The film was shot on 35mm and had a $500,000 budget. The film stars Melanie Lynskey, Wil Wheaton, Corin Nemec and Yelena Danova and is split into two entirely separate stories, the first entitled \\"Dear Jenny\\" and the second \\"Love, Trevor.\\" After principal photography was completed, Kines and his producer did not have the money to finish the film. Kines then designed a website for the film, which raised over $125,000 in investments and donations during 1998. Kines was thus the first filmmaker in history to utilize crowdfunding to help finance a feature.Andrew Rodgers, \\"Filmmaker Uses Web To Help Finance, Cast Movie\\", Chicago Tribune, June 11, 1999Patti Hartigan, \\"Filmmaker goes Hollywood on Internet\\", The Boston Globe, May 14, 1999 Foreign Correspondents was shown at several film festivals across the world and received mostly positive reviews. reviewed by Dennis Przywara, Film Threat, February 5, 2003 It was distributed independently on DVD by Kines and his producer.

Judith O'Dea (who had starred in the classic zombie film Night of the Living Dead) also appeared in a small, non-speaking role. The film was distributed in North America in 2004 by Lionsgate Home Entertainment, who changed the title to Serial Slayer.  The Closest Thing to Time Travel  In late 2005, Kines entered a pitch in a one-minute film competition sponsored by stock photo company Getty Images. His pitch, a bittersweet sci fi-tinged tone poem entitled The Closest Thing to Time Travel, was selected as one of only 30 pitches (out of over 240 entries) to be turned into short films using Getty stock footage material. In early 2006 Kines finished his film, and when the competition was open to the public for final voting, The Closest Thing to Time Travel won Kines the Grand Prize of $10,000Screenmag, February 12, 2009 and trips to New York City, Chicago, and Bozeman, Montana, where Kines was a speaker at HATCHfest.Kines' report from HATCHfest Other Work Since 2005, Kines has been working as a freelance copywriter, creating trivia-based content for the Blu-ray releases of several major studio films, and for the well-received end credit sequence for the 2010 comedy The Other Guys.Moviefone, August 9, 2010 Kines has also written and/or directed several short films after The Closest Thing to Time Travel, including Portrait of a Pensive Lady (2008), reviewed by Felix Vasquez, Cinema Crazed, May 22, 2008 Party Pooper (2008), reviewed by Felix Vasquez, Cinema Crazed, December 13, 2008 and Ron and Nancy (2010). reviewed by Felix Vasquez, Cinema Crazed, February 24, 2010 In 2013, Kines authored and hosted an online screenwriting course on Lynda.com.Christopher Boone, \\"Need to Improve Your Screenwriting?

Written by Diane Ruggiero and directed by Marcos Siega, the episode premiered on UPN on May 3, 2005. The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a high school student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, Veronica resolves the mystery of her sexual assault a year earlier by talking to previous acquaintances and learning about the details of what happened at Shelly Pomroy's party a year earlier while she was under the influence of GHB. Meanwhile, Duncan (Teddy Dunn) returns from running away earlier, and Veronica and Logan's relationship matures as she reacts to the news that he had roofies the night of the party. The episode, which resolved Veronica's date rape, one of the main story arcs of the first season, was critically acclaimed.  Background  Although the first season primarily deals with the murder of Veronica's best friend, Lilly Kane (Amanda Seyfried), and the murder is resolved in \\"Leave It to Beaver\\", another arc running throughout the season is the story of Veronica's mysterious rape a year earlier. At that time, Veronica went to a party at a wealthy student, Shelly's, house. There, she was slipped a mysterious drink, and the next thing she knew, she woke up in an unidentified bed missing her underwear\\", indicating that she had been raped. The next day, she walked into the sheriff's department and reported the crime, where Sheriff Don Lamb (Michael Muhney) mocked her predicament and refused to conduct an investigation, leaving Veronica in tears.  Synopsis  The episode opens in Havana, Cuba. Keith (Enrico Colantoni) surprises a now-bearded Duncan (Teddy Dunn), who denies killing Lilly (Amanda Seyfried). At school, Veronica avoids Logan, but that night, Logan shows up at Veronica's door. Logan apologizes for owning GHB before Veronica informs him about her rape. Logan denies being her rapist, but Veronica says she'll punish whoever it is, even if it's Logan. Veronica talks to Meg (Alona Tal) about the party, and she mentions seeing Veronica being harassed by some boys before she left. Keith returns Duncan to the Kanes before threatening Clarence Wiedman (Christopher B. Duncan). Veronica approaches Luke (Sam Huntington) about a trip to Tijuana to pick up some GHB; he admits getting the drugs, but he says that he gave them to Dick Casablancas (Ryan Hansen). Luke states that Madison Sinclair was seen writing \\"slut\\" on Veronica's car after the party. Veronica confronts Madison, who says that she defaced Veronica's car because she made out with Dick, her boyfriend. However, Veronica doesn't remember this incident due to the effects of the drugs. Veronica attempts to barge in on a fight between Keith and Alicia over Wallace's involvement in the Wiedman case, but her intervention does nothing to defuse the situation. Veronica talks to Casey, who confirms the make out sessions with Dick and Cassidy, and Veronica was also forced to make out with Shelly for the boys' amusement. Veronica talks to Sean Friedrich and tells him about the girl-on-girl event and that Dick and Beaver took her over to a bed and argued about who should have sex with her. Veronica talks to Dick, who presents a different account of events, saying that he didn't drug her and that he found Beaver with Veronica already. Veronica approaches Beaver, who gives a set of events more similar to that of Sean. However, after Dick and Sean leave, he purports to have run away and vomited before he could bring himself to rape her. Keith says that he has to leave for an engagement in Vegas. Logan talks to Aaron, but Aaron does not even know Logan's birth date. Veronica talks to Carrie Bishop (Leighton Meester), who says that she saw Veronica having sex with Duncan. Veronica confronts Duncan, who denies the rape accusations and remembers comforting Veronica in her drugged state. Duncan says that the sex was consensual even though he knew that they were siblings, confirming Veronica's fears. Veronica talks to Wallace about the events but says that she is content with the answers she has. Keith calls a prostitute in Vegas for an unknown reason, while Veronica apologizes to Logan and tells her about the situation with Duncan. Back in Vegas, Keith talks to the prostitute, Cheyenne, about Abel Koontz, as Cheyenne and Koontz were together at the time of Lilly's murder. Veronica and Logan go into his darkened house before they realize that Aaron throws a surprise party for him, meaning that virtually the entire high school knows that they are dating. Duncan abruptly exits the now-awkward party. Madison gives Veronica a cocktail, which she calls \\"A Trip to the Dentist.\\" Noticing that something is strange, Veronica talks to Madison, who says that she spit in her own drugged drunk before unknowingly giving it to Veronica. Duncan suddenly starts smashing his car before Meg comes out and talks to Duncan, criticizing him. Logan and Veronica are making out before Logan reveals an important piece of information‚Äîthat he drugged Duncan, not knowing what was going to happen between them. Logan temporarily leaves Veronica before she notices a camera in the ceiling. She investigates further and finds a whole network of cameras, hinting that Logan was using them for some nefarious purpose. She calls Weevil to pick her up before she enters the house, finding her mother with Keith.  Arc significance  Keith finds Duncan in Cuba. After a lengthy investigation, Veronica concludes that she and Duncan had consensual sex when they were both drugged. The Kanes believe that Veronica is Duncan's sister, and Keith learns that Abel Koontz couldn't have killed Lilly. Veronica goes public with her relationship with Logan before finding a series of cameras in his bedroom. Production The episode was originally called \\"Up on the Roofie\\", referencing the episode's theme of roofies, before being changed to the final title of \\"A Trip to the Dentist\\". \\"A Trip to the Dentist\\" has the return of several guest stars from a previous single episode, including Luke (Sam Huntington) from \\"You Think You Know Somebody\\", Cole (Daniel Bess) from \\"Like a Virgin\\", Casey Gant (Jonathan Bennett) from \\"Drinking the Kool-Aid\\", Sean Friedrich (Kevin Sheridan) from \\"An Echolls Family Christmas\\", and Carrie Bishop (Leighton Meester) from \\"Mars vs. Mars\\". Within the context of the episode, these characters reappeared so that Veronica could ask them what they knew about the party where she was raped. This episode reintroduces and resolves Veronica's rape, introduced earlier in the season. However, it had been largely ignored until this point in the series. The episode was the third and final episode of the series directed by Marcos Siega, after \\"Drinking the Kool-Aid\\" and \\"Mars vs. Mars\\". In addition, the episode marks regular writer Diane Ruggiero's sixth writing credit for the show. After the episode aired, Rob Thomas called the episode \\"our high-water mark\\". Commenting on Ruggiero writing the episode, he stated, \\"She was really my right hand writing the series, and it felt good to have someone who knew the voices as well as I did. We were both in a comfort zone, both writing this show and writing with each other.\\" In one scene of \\"A Trip to the Dentist\\", Weevil (Francis Capra) accuses Logan (Jason Dohring) of having hit Lilly during their relationship. The series' writers were planning to develop that plot strand into a storyline, with it eventually being revealed that Duncan had hit Lilly in an epileptic fit. However, the storyline was abandoned in order to make time for other story arcs. Thomas commented, \\"At the end of the day, I don't want people thinking that Logan hit Lilly. I did, however, want Weevil to believe it.\\" Although Veronica concludes in this episode that she had consensual sex with Duncan while they were both under the influence of roofies, more information about the night is later revealed in the show's second-season finale, \\"Not Pictured\\", in which it is revealed that Cassidy \\"Beaver\\" Casablancas raped her. When asked whether the writers knew that Beaver would be eventually revealed as the rapist when writing \\"A Trip to the Dentist\\", Thomas responded, \\"I wish I could claim that we were that clever.\\" The writers realized that there was a moment in the episode's script where Beaver could have raped Veronica roughly a month after its airing.  Themes  The episode, and particularly its treatment of rape, has been discussed in books of essays on Veronica Mars and elsewhere. Victoria E. Thomas, writing for In Media Res, opined that Veronica frequently distances herself from her rape, noting a scene in the pilot in which she states, \\"I'm no longer that girl.\\" She regarded \\"A Trip to the Dentist\\" as a way for Veronica to heal from her rape, writing \\"Her healing is tied to finding out who raped her; a simple solution to a complex issue. This choice could mirror our present day stigma and lack of support for survivors of sexual assault, or it could simply allow the producers to erase her identity as a sexual assault survivor, leading the audience to believe that the strength of the character is not tied to her rape.\\" Sarah Whitney, in Investigating Veronica Mars: Essays on the Teen Detective Series, found the episode's portrayal of rape \\"troubling\\". She wrote, \\"On of the reasons this ending has always been problematic for me as a viewer is that it is a too-familiar script. Women are frequently told (or tell themselves) that they have \\"misinterpreted\\" sexual situations by missing cues (\\"leading men on\\") or by being \\"unclear\\" about their lack of consent. Furthermore, the episode leaves us bereft of a villain that can be nailed to the wall for forcible rape.\\"Whitney (2011), p. 157 The writer went on to state that instead of placing the blame on a single person, \\"A Trip to the Dentist\\" blamed several people for Veronica's rape.Whitney (2011), pp. 157-158 Whitney also wrote that despite that the \\"official resolution of the rape narrative denies a traditional 'whodunit' ending,\\" it makes a statement that she was raped by an \\"unfeeling class of people.\\"Whitney (2011), p. 159 James and Mona Rocha argued that while \\"Veronica showed poor judgment in the episode, the blame for her rape should not be put on her‚Äîinstead, Dick, Logan, Sean, Dick, and Cassidy (Beaver) should take the blame. Responsibility and blame aren't zero-sum reckonings, such that adding to one person's blame automatically subtracts it from someone else's.\\"Rocha (2014), p. 127 Regarding Logan, they stated that \\"she wouldn't have been raped, if not for Logan's buying the GHB.\\" On Dick, they wrote that \\"Dick didn't intend to drug Veronica, but he did intend to drug someone.\\"Rocha (2014), pp. 128-129 The pair argued that Veronica made some choices that were causally related to her rape, but they concluded that she did not deserve blame. \\"If someone like Veronica makes a bad prudential choice that causes her harm, then maybe she should blame herself, but we can't blame her for any moral wrong done to her as a result. She may have acted foolishly, but that was within her rights.\\"Rocha (2014), p. 134 Reception = Ratings = In its original broadcast, \\"A Trip to the Dentist\\" received 2.85 million viewers, marking a decrease from the previous episode and ranking 100th of 114 in the weekly rankings. = Reviews = Many reviewers commented on the plot twist involving Duncan Kane (Teddy Dunn, pictured). The episode received critical acclaim. Kenneth Nguyen from The Age commented \\"'A Trip to the Dentist', is perhaps the most complex, confronting installment thus far of a series that prides itself on being complex and confronting.\\" The reporter went on to praise the \\"expertly scripted\\" reveal and thought Diane Ruggiero's \\"command of the tightrope high-school milieu seems pretty much spot-on. It is Ruggiero's resolution of the mystery, however, that will keep fans talking. Like the best resolutions, I suppose, it raises more questions than it answers.\\" Complex gave the episode a positive review, writing that it was overshadowed by \\"Leave It to Beaver\\", but that it was also a good episode by itself as well. \\"[The date rape mystery] all comes to a head in the penultimate episode, which puts Veronica on the emotional rollercoaster until she gets to the uncomfortable truth.\\" The magazine also praised the reappearances of guest stars: \\"what really makes the episode special is the way it trots out every supporting player and case-of-the-week guest star.\\" IGN ranked the episode 4th on its list of the top ten Veronica Mars episodes, saying that \\"'A Trip to the Dentist'\\" is a heavy episode that expertly shows how different people remember the same situation. The fact that Veronica has to threaten people who were at the party into telling her the truth is frakking painful. It's made even more sad when you realize that the version she believed to be the truth actually wasn't.\\" Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave a positive review, stating that the reveal was \\"an effective narrative, and one which creates a \\"satisfying\\" resolution for the viewer as well as the character. Veronica Mars has done a good job of subverting expectations on a regular basis, but it's still a TV show, with requirements for satisfying resolutions. [...] Which is my roundabout way of saying that while I wasn't surprised by the reveal that it was Duncan Kane, I was impressed by how well it worked up to that point. It had to be Duncan or someone totally irrelevant and shocking.\\" Television Without Pity gave the episode an \\"A+\\", its fourth such rating for the series, after \\"An Echolls Family Christmas\\", \\"Clash of the Tritons\\", and \\"M.A.D.\\". Conversely, Price Peterson, writing for TV.com, gave a more mixed review, heavily criticizing the resolution to Veronica's rape case. While calling it an \\"entertaining episode\\", he said that it had an \\"appalling message.\\" He explained by writing that \\"[r]egardless of Duncan having been drugged, Veronica could not give consent to him any more than she could to the dudes who were playing puppet- girl with her during the party. Regardless of the retroactive comfort of knowing that she'd lost her virginity to someone she liked, Veronica did not remember it...That kind of psychological trauma goes away immediately?\\" Kimberly Roots of TV Line called the episode \\"cathartic\\" and that \\"we get a huge reveal from Duncan, some unintentionally very public LoVe PDA and a say- it-ain‚Äôt-so-Logan! cliffhanger that swings us right into the season finale.\\" BuzzFeed ranked the episode 3rd on its complete ranking of Veronica Mars episodes, comparing it to Buffy the Vampire Slayer--\\"both these shows have always managed a perfect balance between high school drama (gossip, futile betrayals, and short-lived romances) and extremely powerful and dark themes (sexism, rape, harassment, addiction, and domestic violence).\\" TV Line ranked the episode 2nd on a similar list, only below \\"Pilot\\". Wired called the episode a necessary episode if one binge-watched the show, writing that \\"The information she uncovers is staggeringly heartbreaking, and the way in which the show handled the arc pays off with complex, difficult confrontations.\\" References ;Works cited External links  \\"A Trip to the Dentist\\" at Mars Investigations Category:2005 American television episodes Category:Veronica Mars (season 1) episodes ","title":"A Trip to the Dentist"},{"id":"3927507","text":"Sorghastrum nutans, commonly known as either Indiangrass or yellow Indiangrass, is a North American prairie grass found in the central and eastern United States and Canada, especially in the Great Plains and tallgrass prairies. Description Indiangrass is a warm-season perennial bunchgrass. It is intolerant to shade. It grows tall, and is distinguished by a \\"rifle- sight\\" ligule where the leaf blade attaches to the leaf sheath. The leaf is about long. It blooms from late summer to early fall, producing branched clusters (panicles) of spikelets. The spikelets are golden-brown during the blooming period, and each contain one perfect floret that has three large, showy yellow stamens and two feather-like stigmas. One of the two glumes at the base of the spikelets is covered in silky white hairs. The flowers are cross-pollinated by the wind. The branches of pollinated flower clusters bend outwards. At maturity, the seeds fall to the ground. There are about 175,000 seeds per pound.

She was the first ship to bear the name. She served as Admiral Sir George Rooke's flagship at the battle of Vigo Bay on 12 October 1702. A powerful fleet of Anglo-Dutch warships had been assembled under Admiral Rooke, as Commander-in-Chief, to attack and capture C√°diz. Some footholds were gained near the city but after six weeks of vacillation the allied fleet retired ignominiously on 18 September. Rooke was not prepared to return home empty handed. On his homeward journey he learned of a valuable Spanish treasure fleet that had anchored at Vigo Bay in north-west Spain. Rooke arrived to discover that the Marquis de Ch√¢teaurenault, the French admiral, had laid a boom defence of masts across the inner harbour, covered by guns from sea and land, and had positioned his largest men-of-war to cover it. Admiral Thomas Hopsonn, aboard his flagship, the 80-gun , was ordered to break the boom while the Duke of Ormonde's troops assaulted the forts. The Anglo-Dutch fleet followed astern of Hopsonn, capturing every ship not already burnt by the French, along with considerable treasure. A total of thirty-four French and Spanish ships were captured, destroyed or driven ashore. The battle of V√©lez-M√°laga on 13 August 1704 was the only fleet action fought at sea during the War of the Spanish Succession (1701‚Äì14), and it was inconclusive. Each fleet included fifty one ships of the line and the action was fought in strict line order. The Anglo-Dutch commander-in-chief was once again Sir George Rooke, flying his flag in , while his Franco-Spanish opposite number was the Comte de Toulouse, in the 104 gun Foudrayant. Although the battle itself was indecisive and neither side lost a ship, the casualties were heavy and it put an end to the Franco-Spanish attempt to capture Gibraltar. In 1707, Somerset was part of Admiral Sir Cloudesley Shovell's fleet. She saw action during the Battle of Toulon and was present during the great naval disaster off the Isles of Scilly when Shovell and four of his ships (Association, Firebrand, Romney and Eagle) were lost, claiming the lives of nearly 2,000 sailors.Sobel, Dava, Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time, Fourth Estate Ltd., London 1998, p. 6, Somerset suffered little to no damage and finally managed to reach Portsmouth.

The ship saw action at the Battle of Toulon in 1744. Toulon was an infamous engagement and consequently no battle honour was awarded. A combined Franco-Spanish fleet that had been blockaded in Toulon for two years finally put to sea, led by Admiral de Court de La Bruy√®re. The blockading British fleet under Admiral Thomas Mathews was roughly the same size as the Franco-Spanish fleet but fearing that the enemy fleet movement was designed to force him out of position and allow a troop convoy to reach Italy, Mathews ordered his fleet to attack before forming up into line. Admiral Richard Lestock, Mathew‚Äôs second in command, appears to have deliberately misunderstood his orders, and the resulting battle was indecisive, with the British taking more damage than they inflicted. Mathews was dismissed from the Navy for failing to obey permanent fighting instructions for battle. Somerset was broken up in 1746.

Eisenhower. It reflected Eisenhower's concern for balancing the Cold War military commitments of the United States with the nation's financial resources. The policy emphasised reliance on strategic nuclear weapons as well as a reorganisation of conventional forces in an effort to deter potential threats, both conventional and nuclear, from the Eastern Bloc of nations headed by the Soviet Union. History B-52. In its narrowest sense, the New Look was the name applied to the Department of Defense budget for Fiscal Year 1955, which was the first defense budget prepared entirely by Eisenhower's own Joint Chiefs of Staff. It was based on an extensive reappraisal of U.S. military requirements that began among Eisenhower and his closest advisers immediately following his election in November 1952.Herman S. Wolk, \\"The 'New Look',\\" Air Force Magazine, v. 65, no. 8, (August 2003). It was formalized in National Security Council document 162/2 (NSC 162/2), which Eisenhower approved on October 30, 1953. Increased reliance on tactical nuclear weapons Eisenhower said of tactical nuclear weapons that \\"on strictly military targets and for strictly military purposes, I see no reason why they shouldn't be used just exactly as you would use a bullet or anything else\\". NSC 162/2 reflected Eisenhower's desire for a \\"long-haul\\" approach to security planning that would maintain a more or less constant level of military preparedness, consistent with the health of the U.S. economy.Samuel P. Huntington, The Common Defense, New York: Columbia University Press, 1961, pp. 67‚Äì68. In this respect, it differed from NSC 68, approved by President Harry S. Truman on September 30, 1950. Truman's advisers believed that Soviet military capabilities would reach a maximum relative to those of the United States and its allies in the mid-1950s.Quoted in Huntington, p. 66. Eisenhower rejected the idea that one period would be any more dangerous than another and urged his planners to think in terms of a Soviet threat that was economic as well as military. He wanted to avoid, in his own words, \\"an unbearable security burden leading to economic disaster.\\" With the costly experience of the Korean War in mind, Eisenhower was fearful that U.S. resources would be drained by Soviet-inspired regional conflicts. Covert operations The New Look Policy also embodied an increasing reliance on the use of covert operations and espionage. This was not only due to the fact that clandestine forces were cheap when compared to conventional forces, but also because covert techniques were legitimised in the context of the Cold War. The Special Atomic Demolition Munition (SADM) program, relying on small, portable nuclear weapons, also was consistent with the New Look policy. Green Light Teams, U.S. commandos trained in secret exercises in which they carried actual nuclear weapons, were set up. Their missions would have been to infiltrate targets carrying nuclear weapons, to detonate and to be exfiltrated, although the commandos often understood that they were to be sent on kamakaze missions. Annie Jacobsen, \\"Surprise, Kill, Vanish: The Secret History of CIA Paramilitary Armies, Operators, and Assassins,\\" (New York: Little, Brown and Company, 2019), p. 106 U.S. government propaganda Psychological warfare was a nonviolent technique of combatting the Soviets that especially appealed to Eisenhower, with the goal of flooding Communist states with anti-Soviet propaganda.Kenneth A. Osgood, \\"Form before Substance: Eisenhower's Commitment to Psychological Warfare and Negotiations with the Enemy.\\" Diplomatic History 24.3 (2000): 405-433. Massive Retaliation and the New Look B-47 long-range bomber was the mainstay of U.S. deterrence during most of the New Look. B-52 long-range bomber. The first models were deployed just as the New Look took shape. In order to contain defense costs, the New Look brought about a shift in emphasis from conventional military capability to \\"air-atomic\\" capability in the form of the Strategic Air Command within a scaled-down overall military establishment. Land and naval forces were cut. Continental air defense was expanded. Although strategic air power attained a lower level than the Truman administration had projected, it became the centerpiece of U.S. security thinking, embodied in the doctrine of \\"Massive Retaliation.\\" Summarized in the popular slogan \\"more bang for the buck,\\" Massive Retaliation was intended to be both a deterrent to an enemy and an economy of scale if deterrence failed.Huntington, pp. 79‚Äì80. The doctrine was proclaimed in its most absolute form by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles in a speech before the Council on Foreign Relations on January 12, 1954, in which he said, \\"Local defenses must be reinforced by the further deterrent of massive retaliatory power [emphasis added].Quoted in Bernard Brodie, Strategy in the Missile Age, (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1959, p. 248. Dulles continued: > The way to deter aggression is for the free community to be willing and able > to respond vigorously at places and with means of its own choosing. ... Now > the Department of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff can shape our > military establishment to fit what is our policy, instead of having to try > to be ready to meet the enemy's many choices. That permits of a selection of > military means instead of a multiplication of means, As a result, it is now > possible to get, and share, more basic security at less cost.Id., pp. > 248‚Äì249. McGeorge Bundy, a national security adviser to Presidents John F. > Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, states that President Eisenhower, although > initially put off by the phrase \\"massive retaliatory power,\\" not only > approved the Dulles speech, but had a hand in drafting it. McGeorge Bundy, > Danger and Survival, New York: Random House, 1988, p. 256\\\\. =Criticism of Massive Retaliation= What Dulles implied was that the United States was prepared to respond to a Soviet-backed conventional threat anywhere with a nuclear strike against the Soviet Union itself.This was not a new theme for Dulles. In a 1952 article for Life magazine, he wrote: \\"There is one solution and only one: that is for the free world to develop the will and organize the means to retaliate instantly against open aggression by Red armies, so that, if it occurred anywhere, we could and would strike back where it hurts, by means of our choosing.\\" John Foster Dulles, '\\"A Policy of Boldness,\\" Life, May 19, 1952, p. 151\\\\. Quoted in Townsend Hoopes, The Devil and John Foster Dulles, (Boston: Little, Brown & Co., 1973), p. 127\\\\. Dulles, however, was not alone in suggesting a nuclear response to a conventional threat. On January 11, 1951, at the height of the Korean War, former Secretary of the Air Force Stuart Symington, then chair of the National Security Resources Board, sent President Truman the draft of NSC 100, which proposed using nuclear weapons not only against China, which was engaged in active combat with U.S. forces, but also against the Soviet Union, which was believed to be conducting the war through China. Truman rejected the memorandum. James Carroll, House of War, Boston & New York: Houghton Mifflin Co., 2006, pp. 193, 202. Critics of Massive Retaliation such as historian John Lewis Gaddis have pointed out that the doctrine was not credible in the face of \\"less-than-total challenges\\" such as the Soviet intervention in the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, and that whatever credibility it might have had diminished steadily as Soviet strategic power grew.John Lewis Gaddis, Strategies of Containment: A Critical Appraisal of Postwar American National Security New York: Oxford University Press, 1982. Furthermore, it theoretically provided the Soviet Union with an incentive to strike first to disarm the United States. The Hungarian Revolution involved a matter internal to the Eastern Bloc, so it is unclear whether any sort of conventional military response would have been undertaken regardless. \\"New\\" New Look 1958 deployment of tactical atomic weapons in Korea. The refusal of the United States to act to prevent the defeat of France by the Communist-led Viet Minh at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, just four months after the Dulles speech, highlighted the political difficulties Eisenhower faced in balancing interference in Asia with his determination to keep the U.S. out of a \\"hot war\\". His refusal to intervene using air strikes - a tactic that he decided would have been ineffective in the scenario of Dien Bien Phu - led instead to a third option: a threat of nuclear strikes against strategic Chinese targets, in line with \\"Massive Retaliation\\". This was approved on May 26, on the condition that both congress and U.S. allies supported it. This tactic could not be relied upon to secure US interests in every case however. Defense planners, therefore, began shaping a \\"new\\" New Look marked by emphasis on strategic \\"sufficiency,\\" not superiority; on tactical nuclear weapons to fight \\"limited wars;\\" and on standing forces as opposed to reserves.See generally, Huntington, pp. 88‚Äì100. Huntington uses the term \\"New New Look.\\" So does George E. Lowe, The Age of Deterrence, Boston: Little, Brown & Co., 1964, p. 89\\\\. Apparently without access to the then- classified NSC 5440, Huntington placed the beginning of the \\"New New Look\\" in December 1955 when Department of Defense planners began budget preparations for fiscal years 1958, 1959 and 1960. The emphasis was still primarily on nuclear weapons and the justification was still that of economy, but a shift toward what would later be called \\"flexible response\\" had begun. The new approach was embodied in NSC5440 (approved as NSC5501 on January 7, 1955), finalized in December 1954, which stated: > The ability to apply force selectively and flexibly will become increasingly > important in maintaining the morale and will of the free world to resist > aggression. As the fear of nuclear war grows, the United States and its > allies must never allow themselves to get into the position where they must > choose between (a) not responding to local aggression and (b) applying force > in a way which our own people or our allies would consider entails undue > risk of nuclear devastation. However, the United States cannot afford to > preclude itself from using nuclear weapons even in a local situation, if > such use ... will best advance U.S. security interests. In the last > analysis, if confronted by the choice of (a) acquiescing in Communist > aggression or (b) taking measures risking either general war or loss of > allied support, the United States must be prepared to take these risks if > necessary for its security.Quoted in Campbell Craig, Destroying the Village: > Eisenhower and Thermonuclear War New York: Columbia University Press, 1998, > chapter 3. According to historian Campbell Craig: > NSC 5440 was a fundamental revision of the earlier BNSP [Basic National > Security Policy].

Between 300 and 400 people are believed to have died in the storm. Damage on Barbados and St. Vincent was catastrophic. Meteorological history The storm developed in the south central Atlantic from an easterly wave out of Africa. The storm steadily strengthened and reached the Windward Islands as a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane scale. The hurricane roared directly over Barbados with sustained winds in excess of 100 mph. The effect was devastating. The hurricane maintained intensity and actually strengthened to near-major hurricane force. It turned slowly north, passing close to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, St. Lucia and Martinique. Exiting the islands, still a Category 2 storm, it continued north and then curved northeast near Bermuda. The storm finally became extratropical before crossing Newfoundland, having maintained hurricane strength for 13 consecutive days.  Impact  The storm caused devastating damage throughout the eastern Caribbean islands. Barbados and St. Vincent sustained the most damage. The number of dead is unknown but the best estimate is between 300-400 people lost. No damage figures exist but the destruction was very heavy and widespread in many places. Estimates run in the millions of dollars, uninflated. In Barbados, 83 deaths and 150 injuries were reported. About 5,062 houses were completely destroyed, while 2,359 others suffered damage. Between 40,000 and 45,000 people were left homeless. Many streets were left impassable for several days, especially to vehicles. Phone service was completely disrupted as nearly all the power poles on the island were downed. The sugarcane plantations on the island also suffered crippling damage. The hurricane was compared to the ‚ÄúGreat Hurricane‚Äù of August 1831, in which roughly 1,500 people died and the island of Barbados was practically flattened. Impact was also severe on Saint Vincent. The villages of Richmond and Wallibou were a \\"complete wreck\\", with no houses remaining. In Chateaubelair, many houses were demolished, while a few were still standing after the storm, albeit with severe damage. Forty-five deaths occurred in the village. Similar impact was reported in Cumberland, with one death. Only one house was not destroyed at Barrouallie. Thirty fatalities were reported, eleven of which occurred after a church which people sought refuge in was wrecked. In Layou, only the police barracks remained standing. Throughout Saint Vincent, many people suffered injuries. Numerous large trees were uprooted and weather instruments were destroyed on the island. Nearly a foot of rain fell in just 24 hours. Dozens of boats were lost in the harbors and out at sea. The confirmed death toll for Saint Vincent was about 300. There was minimal damage in Grenadines, except for Bequia, which was severely affected. At Guadeloupe, the sloop Marie Stella capsized offshore Goyave, drowning nine people. An additional nine deaths occurred after a landslide in Trois-Rivi√®res buried two homes. On St. Lucia, impact was mostly limited to rain and landslides.

It has also been referred to as the Mary J. Steiner Egyptian Theatre or Egyptian Theatre in Park City. History The Egyptian Theatre was built on the location of the old Dewey Theatre, which collapsed under a snow load in January 1916. Construction began in 1926, and the first production, by John Alphonso Rugar (1883‚Äì1970), debuted on Christmas Day of 1926. It was built with a stage for potential vaudeville acts but was used primarily as a movie house. The design of the building was a replica of Warner's Egyptian Theatre in East Pasadena, California, and Egyptologist C.R. Berg of Seattle was consulted on the theater's theme and decor. The Christmas opening featured a performance of \\"A Wonderful Sign of a Magical Time\\". The theatre was used as a saloon, a cinema house and live performance theatre during the Great Depression, the Second World War and a period of severe local emigration in the 1950s. The theatre was eventually renamed the Silver Wheel Theatre in 1963, just in time for the town to rebound as a ski and resort city. Live theatre continued to be presented through this period, and in 1981, it became the home to Park City Performances after a renovation process. The increased diversity in productions helped the theatre carry on as an active venue well into the 1990s. The Save our Stage community group was formed during this period, and on February 14, 1998, the Egyptian Theatre reopened after the completion of a major reconstruction and refurbishment effort. The cost of the renovation is estimated to be at $1.5 Million. Significance The Egyptian Theatre was part of a national and worldwide fascination with the contemporary discovery of the tomb of King Tut in Egypt. Many cinema and performance theatres around the nation were either refurbished or constructed with the Egyptian theme in mind. The design and construction of the theatre was supervised by an Egyptologist from Seattle, WA. The result of the accurate use of the historic details was a beautiful theatre with many of the most recognizable symbols of Egypt, including the lotus leaf, scarabs, hieroglyphics and symbols of life and happiness. Originally the theatre was built to seat 400, but later renovations reduced that number to the present capacity of 310. The Egyptian Theatre was the first sound movie cinema house in Park City, Utah. The Sundance Film Festival has used The Egyptian Theatre as a cinematic house for almost as long as the festival has existed; one of its oldest and most recognizable venues. This theatre is one of only two Egyptian-style theatres in Utah. The other example is that of Peery's Egyptian Theatre in Ogden, Utah. Besides these two theaters, the Salt Lake Masonic Temple is the only other Egyptian Revival building still extant in Utah.

She was the third vessel of the Royal Navy to bear the name. Somerset was involved in several notable battles of the Seven Years' War and the American Revolutionary War. She was wrecked in a storm in 1778 when she ran aground off of Provincetown, on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Seven Years' War HMS Somerset saw action at the capture of the fortress of Louisbourg and Cape Breton Island during the Seven Years' War (a theatre known in the United States as the French and Indian War). In 1758, a British expedition under General Jeffery Amherst besieged the fortress at Louisbourg, beginning on 8 June. The British had 39 ships with about 14,000 sailors, and a further landing force of 12,870 soldiers. The fortress was defended by 10 French ships with 3,870 sailors, and another 3,920 soldiers inside the fortress itself. The 48-day siege by Admiral Edward Boscawen and General Amherst ended with the French surrender on 26 July, clearing the way for a British expedition to sail up the Saint Lawrence River to take Quebec City the following summer. The expedition against Quebec City, led by General James Wolfe, was landed by a force that included HMS Somerset. The British were victorious at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham on 13 September 1759 giving Britain control of Canada and North America's Atlantic seaboard. American Revolutionary War HMS Somerset went on to play a well documented part in the American Revolutionary War, where she served from 1774 to 1776 and again from 1777 up until her loss in 1778. =Battle of Lexington and Concord= Events might have unfolded differently on the night of 18 April 1775 had the duty watch of HMS Somerset been more alert. Colonel Paul Revere had set out that night to ride to Lexington to warn two prominent Colonial leaders, Samuel Adams and John Hancock, that their lives might be in danger. Having departed Boston by rowboat to cross the Back Bay into Charlestown, he narrowly avoided being noticed by HMS Somerset, which was anchored there. Had he been stopped, the militias of many towns would not have arrived in Concord, and the next day's battle of Lexington and Concord might have had a different outcome. As it was, Somerset's gun crews were able to keep rebel forces from following the retreating British troops to Charlestown on the evening of 19 April. Revere's exploits led to HMS Somerset‚Äôs immortalisation in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem 'The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere': > :Then he said 'Good-night!' and with muffled oar :Silently rowed to the > Charlestown shore, :Just as the moon rose over the bay, :Where swinging wide > at her moorings lay :The Somerset, British man-of-war; :A phantom ship, with > each mast and spar :Across the moon like a prison bar, :And a huge black > hulk, that was magnified :By its own reflection in the tide. =Battle of Chelsea Creek= Somerset was the backdrop to another brief but important incident during the war, the Battle of Chelsea Creek. On the night of Saturday 27 May 1775, HMS Armed Schooner Diana, under the command of Lieutenant Thomas Graves, ran aground in Chelsea Creek while attempting to keep Americans from driving British livestock from Noddle's Island in Boston Harbor, at which point the American rebels set fire to the ship. HMS Somerset's tender, Britannia (under the command of Thomas Graves' brother Lieutenant John Graves), was able to rescue the Diana's company. Lt Thomas Graves went on to serve under Lord Rodney at the Battle of the Saintes, eventually becoming Rear Admiral Sir Thomas Graves and Nelson's second-in- command at the Battle of Copenhagen. He was permanently scarred by the burns he received at Noddle's Island. He was a cousin of Admiral Thomas Graves, 1st Baron Graves who would command at the Battle of the Chesapeake in 1781 and the nephew of Admiral Samuel Graves. =Battle of Bunker Hill (Breed's Hill)= Shortly after those events, HMS Somerset served as the flagship of Admiral Samuel Graves at the Battle of Bunker Hill. Boston, under British control since 1768, was under siege by between 8,000 and 12,000 militia. On the night of 16 June 1775, several thousand militia forces began occupying the strategically important Charlestown Peninsula and fortified Breed's Hill, a position from which they would be able to bombard the British in Boston. At dawn, HMS Lively was first to spot the new fortification and the ship opened fire, temporarily halting the Americans' work. Admiral Graves, in HMS Somerset, awoke to the sound of gunfire he hadn't ordered. He ordered it stopped, only to reverse his order when he saw the works. He ordered all 128 guns in the harbour to open fire on the American position. The broadsides proved largely ineffective, since the ships were unable to elevate their guns sufficiently to reach the hilltop. The position was eventually taken by British troops, ferried across the bay under protection of the navy's guns, but at considerable cost. Loss In the autumn of 1777, HMS Somerset took part in the Siege of Fort Mifflin in which the British successfully captured the river forts on the Delaware River.McGuire, Thomas J. The Philadelphia Campaign, Volume II, Mechanicsburg, Pa.: Stackpole Books, 2007. p 205 HMS Somerset‚Äôs luck ran out at the end of 1778. She was battered by gales in August. While pursuing a French squadron, she ran aground in a 2 November 1778 gale on Peaked Hill Bars off Provincetown, Massachusetts. By the time the Somerset wrecked, Cape Codders had already suffered greatly due to the British blockade of Boston that began in 1774. Commercial fishing and whaling were virtually shut down. Some local people had engaged in privateering and smuggling along the coast, while others turned to the land for subsistence. When the giant Somerset wrecked on the Cape, there likely was a strong emotional reaction by the local populace. According to the official account of the ship's captain, George Ourry, only 21 men were lost during the wreck. Captain Ourry was forced to walk under guard to Providence, Rhode Island, where he was exchanged for two American officers. The officers and crew, numbering over 400, were escorted to Boston. Towns along the route provided militia to escort and support the prisoners. A tremendous amount of scarce war material was chopped or pried away from the wreck by local residents before the state put a guard over what remained. Eleven 18-pound and five 9-pound cannon and powder were entrusted to Colonel Revere to be used in fortifying Castle Island in Boston Harbor. Salvage of the Somerset's cargo was dangerous and difficult. Provisions in the lower hold were only accessible for a few hours a day at low tide. Severe winter storms in December finally broke apart the remains of the ship, moved it closer to shore, and eventually buried it under tons of sand at an area known locally as Dead Man's Hollow. It took several more months of bitter court proceedings to sort out who owned what in the aftermath of salvage operations. The Somerset's wreckage has been partially exposed, albeit briefly, only three times since 1788 ‚Äì in 1886, 1973 and 2010 ‚Äì by storm currents that caused part of the wreckage to be uncovered. In 2010 the National Park Service commissioned a digital survey using 3D imaging technology to accurately record the exposed timbers that were visible. It was estimated that only the lower ten percent of the ship remains, buried once again under the sand. The Somerset is protected under international law, and is the sovereign property of the United Kingdom. Remembrance The National Park Service preserves some of the large timbers from the wreck. In 2005, the park superintendent presented a few pieces of the Somerset to the commander and crew of the British navy's modern HMS Somerset (IV). HMS Somerset is remembered by a historical re-enactment society in Boston, called 'His Majesty's Ship Somerset.

The film is set in a laboratory in Papua New Guinea that releases a dangerous chemical, turning the technicians and locals into zombies. A French news reporter (Margit Evelyn Newton) and her crew land on the island to investigate. Hell of the Living Dead was a project developed by producers and given to director Bruno Mattei, who attempted to create a film similar to Dawn of the Dead but lighter in tone. It was shot in five weeks in Spain with a script that was not Mattei's first choice and a score by the band Goblin, taken from other film scores that the band had performed. The film generally received negative reviews, noting bad dialogue and its obvious derivation of 1978's Dawn of the Dead. Plot At a top secret chemical research facility called Hope Center #1, a rat causes a chemical leak and dies. As two workers investigate, the rat suddenly comes back to life and kills one of the men, who likewise revives and attacks his co-workers. Subsequently, the entire staff of the plant turn into flesh-eating zombies. A four-man team of commandos, consisting of Lt. Mike London (Jos√© Gras), Osborne (Josep Llu√≠s Fonoll), Zantoro (Franco Garafalo), and Vincent (Selan Karay), are deployed to eliminate a group of eco-terrorists who have taken hostages inside a large building at the US Embassy in Barcelona, Spain. The terrorists demand the closing of all the Hope Centers, which both the government and the military deny exist. The press, under orders of the local authorities, do not publicize the terrorists' demands or mention the disaster at Hope Center. After pumping tear gas into the building, Lt. London and his three commandos burst in, killing the terrorists. Once the mission is completed, the team loses contact with Hope Center #1. Thinking that the complex has been infiltrated by terrorists, the team flies to Papua New Guinea. There they meet journalist Lia Rousseau (Margit Evelyn Newton) and her cameraman Max (Gabriel Renom), who are investigating a series of mysterious, violent attacks on the locals. While stopping at a native village, they encounter several flesh-eating zombies. The commandos and the journalists travel through the New Guinea jungle in the commando's jeep, trying to survive while evading the zombies. The group takes refuge at an abandoned plantation, only to come under attack from the zombie residents. The flesh-eating residents kill and eat Osborne, forcing the survivors to flee. Rousseau and London's men battle their way to a beach, escape by raft, and finally arrive at Hope Center #1, where they find all of the workers either dead or roaming the facility as zombies. The zombies quickly kill Max and Zantoro, and infect Vincent. Rousseau and London learn about the experimental chemical that was accidentally released, which is causing the zombie infestation. From audiotaped notes and papers left behind in the lab's research offices, Rousseau learns that the chemical, codenamed \\"Operation Sweet Death\\", had been intended to curb the Third World population by driving it to prey on each other. Rousseau vows to tell the world, but a horde of zombies - including their now zombified comrades - close in and devour the last survivors of the team. Some time later, the zombie contagion has spread beyond the borders of the country and throughout the world. While politicians and scientists dispute the matter, a young couple in the developed world are attacked and devoured by a horde of zombies in a city park. Cast Production Director Bruno Mattei noted that the production began as a specific request from the producer. Mattei planned to make a film inspired by 1978's Dawn of the Dead, but wanted a lighter tone for the film. Mattei said that initially two screenplays were written, and that the producers rejected the screenplay that Mattei preferred. The film was Mattei's first to be made under the name Vincent Dawn, a request made specifically by the film's Spanish production side. Claudio Fragasso stated he wrote Hell of the Living Dead with Rossella Drudi, his frequent co-scripter. Fragasso felt there had been several zombie films made recently, and wanted to do something different after watching Dawn of the Dead suggesting the film would be like Soylent Green as well as envisioning the film as \\"an undead epic, a kind of Apocalypse Now\\". Among the cast was Margit Evelyn Newton as Lia. Newton recalled that she felt a great sense of responsibility at the time, playing the film's protagonist. Newton felt nervous in a scene involving nudity in front of the indigenous people. She asked that everyone be removed from the set, with only indispensable cast and crew remaining. The scene was shot in one day. Hell of the Living Dead was shot in 5 weeks. The film includes stock footage to suggest that the film was set in New Guinea. Fragasso stated that when the crew arrived in Barcelona to shoot the film they found they had no money and had to improvise and rewrite the previous script. The production had this footage from the beginning of shooting the film and had rebuilt some of the locations from the stock footage in Spain, where the film was shot. Fragasso commented on the use of stock footage in the film as producers wanted to reuse footage they had, which led to Mattei adding footage of a documentary New Guinea, Island of Cannibals into the film. Parts of the film were improvised on set, such as when a character enters a room imitating Gene Kelly in his film Singing in the Rain. The score is credited to the band Goblin, but is mostly taken from other film scores Goblin performed, such as Dawn of the Dead and Contamination. Mattei was a fan of their music and secured rights to it for the film through Carlo Bizio. Fragasso stated that the music was from other films and from their album Roller as Goblin were too expensive at the time to get for an original score. Release Hell of the Living Dead was released in Spain in November 1980 and in Italy in August 1981 and released in the United States in 1983. It was described as \\"moderately profitable\\" in Glenn Kay's book Zombie Movies: The Ultimate Guide. It has been released under several titles, including Virus, Night of the Zombies and Zombie Creeping Flesh. Critical reception In a contemporary review, Steve Jenkins (The Monthly Film Bulletin) noted that the possibility of a subversive subtext involving Third World victims corrupted by scientific research was \\"truly buried here in an orgy of flesh chewing and vomiting, as well as dialogue that beggars belief.\\" The review commented positively that the film had unexpected pleasures, such as \\"the ludicrous attempts to dub speech on to stock footage (featuring humans) and a story, low-budget UN meeting consisting of a handful of delegates hurling pieces of paper at each other.\\" From retrospective reviews, Glenn Kay (Zombie Movies: The Ultimate Guide) also noted the poor dialogue, as well as bad shot composition‚Äîwith scenes changing from day to night between cuts, slow pacing and overacting. AllMovie described the film as \\"cluelessly bad\\" with a script of \\"dreadful characterizations and dialogue,\\" noting that it would be enjoyed by fans of cult and trash cinema. John Kenneth Muir (Horror Films of the 1980s) stated the film was not enjoyable to watch and that it added little originality to the zombie genre in the vein of other films such as Return of the Living Dead and Day of the Dead. Both AllMovie and Muir noted the film's similarity to Dawn of the Dead, with Muir referring to it as \\"perhaps the most blatant rip-off of Dawn of the Dead ever produced\\". Mattei later expressed that he felt the film's dialogue was \\"pretty stupid\\" and that like all his films, he would reshoot it if possible. When asked how she felt about the film in 2013, actress Margit Evelyn Newton responded that \\"Obviously seeing it now, I would change some things. But that is okay. Virus has helped me get more work.\\" Fragasso commented on the film later saying that the film \\"designed with lots of love, but in the end it came out a test tube baby, a kind of abortion [...] But I'm satisfied with the end results.\\" See also *List of horror films of 1980 *List of Italian films of 1980 *List of Spanish films of 1980  References  =Footnotes= =Sources=    External links Category:1980 films Category:1980 horror films Category:Italian films Category:Spanish films Category:Italian horror films Category:Spanish horror films Category:Apocalyptic films Category:Films about cannibalism Category:Films about zombies Category:Films shot in Spain Category:Films directed by Bruno Mattei Category:Films scored by Goblin (band) ","title":"Hell of the Living Dead"},{"id":"3927660","text":"David Chamberlain (born December 25, 1975) is a cross-country skier from the United States.

Pascal's Hardware and Furniture was a Montreal, Quebec, Canada-based chain of hardware stores and furniture stores. History J. Pascal had long been a hardware chain only, but subsequently expanded to furniture retailing. Until the 1970s, the company's name was J. Pascal Hardware Co. After the furniture division was created in the 1980s, the company's corporate name became J. Pascal Inc. Although both operated under the trade name \\"Pascal\\", shared a common logo, the hardware and furniture chains were kept separate in terms of operations and outlets. The hardware stores were found mostly in enclosed shopping malls and commercial streets, while the furniture stores were in strip malls. J. Pascal was in business for almost 90 years and operated 26 hardware and furniture stores in the provinces of Quebec, Ontario and New Brunswick before going bankrupt on May 16, 1991. Only the flagship hardware division was closed. The spin-off furniture division would survive another three more years before closing in 1994. After Pascal went out of business, a small furniture chain started to use the name under the trademark \\"Club Meubles Pascal\\", resulting in a legal battle with J.Pascal in 1996. Throughout its existence J. Pascal remained a family business, belonging to three generations of the Pascal family. It was founded in 1903 by Jacob Pascal, and then taken over by his sons, Maxwell Pascal, Arthur Pascal, Hyman Pascal, and Cecil Pascal. =Pascal Hotel Supplies= Pascal Hotel Supplies wasn't affected by the bankruptcy of the parent company and was in operation until 2008.

The word \\"pit\\" in the movie's title refers to a foiba, indicating foibe massacres. The movie was watched by 17 million people on its first broadcast in Italy. It was the first time that a major TV event was broadcast in Italy about the dramas of Foibe and Istrian Exodus.  Plot  = People Returning = April 1945. The German army is losing the war and Tito's Yugoslav partisans are rapidly gaining ground. Giulia is a woman who earns a living by singing in a tavern in an unnamed village in what appears to be an ethnically Italian area of Istria. She had a child named Carlo six years earlier by a Slav named Novak, who has now become a partisan leader. It appears that Novak had raped Giulia, but Novak will later claim Giulia reported him to the police to get rid of him. The Italian police would rather believe an Italian woman than a Slavic man. The movie does not give a clear answer as to whose version of the story is true. Novak comes back to Giulia to claim his child, but she refuses to give him up. She attracts the attention of German soldiers and Novak must flee. Francesco is an 8-year-old child, only son of physician Giorgio Bottini and music schoolteacher Marta. He lives with his parents in the same village as Giulia and Carlo. He meets Ettore, an Alpino who is tired of war and drops his rifle in disgust when Francesco mentions that he likes heroes of war. Ettore has come back to see his girlfriend Anja again, who is Slavic and works at Don Bruno's orphanage. = New Masters = Fearing for Carlo's safety, Giulia burns all his pictures so that Novak will not be able to recognize him, and gives Carlo to Don Bruno, the local priest, who takes him into his orphanage. Meanwhile, the Germans leave the village, which is taken shortly afterwards by the partisans. Novak enters a school, interrupting a music lesson of Francesco's mother, and orders all Italian books to be burnt. From this point, Novak will usually whistle the song the children were singing at various parts in the movie, making it his leitmotiv. At the same time, Francesco's father is threatened by Bostjan, Novak's henchman, and is forced to leave his clinic because he is Italian. Don Bruno has to give Carlo to Francesco's family, because he thinks his orphanage is too dangerous for him. Francesco and Carlo become officially brothers, even if Francesco at first rejects him. = Escape = The partisans start rounding up civilians, taking away everybody including children. Eventually, Francesco's family is also captured along with Carlo. On the trucks they are loaded on, children are separated from their parents, a scene that hints at Nazi concentration camps of the same war. It turns out that Novak wants all the children of the village to check, one by one, which one will react to the sight of Marta, whom he has kidnapped and keeps in his camp. Just before Carlo's turn, Anja manages to infiltrate the camp and take away Carlo and Francesco, with Ettore's help. Carlo and Francesco lose contact with their friends and return to an emptied home village. While waiting for help, German artillery starts pounding the village, and a shell makes Carlo deaf. Believing he cannot take care for him anymore, Francesco tries to bring Carlo back to Don Bruno's orphanage. On their way there, they see a convoy of partisans transporting Italian civilians, among them Francesco's parents. The civilians are gunned down by the partisans and thrown in a foiba, into which Francesco climbs down shortly after to find his parents dead, chained in iron wire. There is also a dying dog, which the partisans apparently threw down in order to keep the dead spirits from haunting them. = The search continues = With the help of Ettore, Francesco and Carlo finally manage to reach Don Bruno's orphanage. Shortly after, Novak and his partisans reach the orphanage. Don Bruno, Anja and Ettore hide all the children, hoping that Novak will believe they have left to Italy. Novak, however, understands the priest's bluff, and orders his men to pour gasoline around the orphanage. Don Bruno, then, is forced to admit there still are children, and calls them out loud--but only the Slavic ones, thinking they do not have anything to fear from Novak. Novak, again not falling for Don Bruno's bluff, orders to set fire to the gasoline; the children have to exit, and Anja is recognized by Bostjan and captured for being a quisling. Carlo, Francesco and other two children, however, manage to escape through a conduit. Novak brings the children to his camp, again to show them to Giulia to understand whether one of them is his son. Don Bruno, when questioned, refuses to point out the child to Novak, because he considers him an assassin; Don Bruno is then kept prisoner by Novak. = Breaking out = The four children, having nowhere to go, reach Novak's camp and, whistling a code, find out that Don Bruno is in there. Francesco confronts Walter, a friend of his parents, who is still collaborating with the partisans; however, it turns out that he has been kept in the dark about Novak's ethnic cleansing. Walter offers himself to help contact Don Bruno, since he still has access to the partisans' base. He discovers that Anja and Giulia are also imprisoned in the same facility. Exiting the complex, Walter meets Francesco and Ettore, who has in the meantime escaped pursue by partisans. Ettore, disguised with a partisan's uniform, starts pouring gasoline through the base, taking advantage of the fact that most soldiers are drunk. At the same time, in the base, Bostjan rapes a helpless Anja. While Novak is interrogating Don Bruno, Ettore ignites the gasoline, causing a series of chain explosions in the base's weapon caches. While the partisans are busy trying to contain the damage, Walter liberates Don Bruno and tells him to go with the children to Gorizia by the mountains, to avoid partisan patrols. Don Bruno finds and liberates Anja, still shocked by Bostjan's rape, while Walter finds Giulia. Ettore, in the meantime, finds most of the Italian prisoners in the base and liberates them, but most of them are rapidly recaptured by the partisans. Giulia is finally reunited with her son Carlo, and together with Don Bruno, Ettore, Anja, Francesco and other children they take refuge in an abandoned coastal battery. They escape from the partisans' pursue by using a rope to reach the sea, but, to buy time and seal the door behind them, Giulia leaves them and surrenders to Novak. Walter reaches the coastal battery and confronts Novak, accusing him of genocide. Novak responds that that land is theirs, not the Italians', and that the Italians still have to pay a large debt (implied, in lives). The following morning, the children's group reaches a small boat. Anja, still struggling with the memories of her rape, does not want to leave, but Don Bruno convinces her to continue. Ettore has by now understood that something terrible has happened, even if it is not clear how much he knows. = Choice = Novak brings the remaining Italian prisoners to another foiba, and guns them down in front of Walter and Giulia, who are kept aside. He then brings Giulia to the brink of the foiba, and asks her to come back to him, telling her he still loves her. Giulia eventually smiles to him, and jumps into the foiba. Novak, shocked, orders his troops to chase the children's group, but one of his lieutenants, Drasko, protests that the Communist party's orders are to march on Trieste, not to hunt down children and priests; he eventually leaves Novak, along with a group of partisans. The children's group is meanwhile proceeding through the mountains, avoiding partisan patrols. Trying to catch a hare with a slingshot, Francesco sets off a landmine, attracting Novak's attention. The children have to waste precious time as Ettore bears them out of the minefield, and are eventually cornered by Novak's forces. Novak, knowing they can hear him, threatens to kill Walter, still his prisoner, if his son is not brought to him. As Walter yells to them not to surrender because Novak is killing all the Italians, Novak shoots him. = Memories = As the children's group continue their escape, Ettore and Don Bruno visit the graves of Ettore's former comrades-in-arms. A group of veterans from campaigns in Greece and Albania, they were betrayed by a band of partisans who had asked them to join the resistance, and killed them with a machine gun as soon as they had handed over their arms. Ettore, after remembering them, takes back his guns from a cache he had left in a building close to his comrades' graves, and symbolically returns to be a soldier. He uses some dynamite to cut down a large tree in front of Novak's jeep, being dissuaded by Don Bruno from shooting at Novak with his rifle when he had the chance. Meanwhile, the children and Anja are found by Bostjan and one of his partisans, but as Bostjan threatens to execute Anja, Ettore arrives, immobilizes Bostjan and kills the other partisan. As Bostjan tries to grab a weapon, Ettore kills him too. Anja, shocked by the memories of her rape by Bostjan that have come back, tries to commit suicide by jumping off a cliff, but Ettore succeeds in dissuading her. = Betrayal = The group reaches another village, which proves to be devoid of any people. There, they meet the Pavans, an upper-class family fleeing from Maresco. Their car (a luxury for the times) has stalled and they are stranded with their luggage. The Pavans try to protect their wealth and provisions, and do not allow their well- dressed children to talk to the others. Yet, they join the group as they do not have alternatives, trying to bring with them part of their cumbersome luggage for some time. As they march on, Carlo is soon unable to walk due to a wound in his ankle, but he has finally regained his hearing. The group has to slow down, and Mr. Pavan grows nervous. Mr. Pavan learns that Carlo is the reason Novak is stalking them, and when his turn comes to carry him, he lags behind until he has a chance to bring the child to Novak, hoping he would let them go. Novak finally meets his son, but is ambushed by Ettore. Novak proposes to let the child decide where to go, but Carlo says he wants to go back to his mother. Ettore orders Novak and his men to drop their weapons, that are picked up by three Italian soldiers that Francesco had just stumbled upon. They leave Novak and his men unarmed and alive, and they proceed. = Last stand = However, Novak surrendered easily because he knew the road to Gorizia was blocked, and that he had time to regroup. As the children's group, together with the soldiers, is forced to move towards the coastline, they find an abandoned fortress. Ettore and the Italian soldiers decide to remain there to delay the advance of Novak's soldiers, who are chasing them, accepting the implication that they will likely not survive the fight. At the abandoned fortress, Don Bruno quickly marries Ettore and Anja, since this could be their last time together. Mr. Pavan is forced to remain and fight, even if he tries to bribe his way out. When Novak and a dozen of his soldiers arrive, Mr. Pavan tries to surrender, only to be shot in the back by a partisan. Ettore and the other Italians continue to resist from their vantage position, and in the end only Novak and Ettore are left. Francesco, who has found a gun, runs back to the fortress to avenge his parents and kill Novak; Don Bruno runs after him, but arrives only in time to take the bullet from Novak's gun and save Francesco's life with his own; Ettore manages to grab a rifle and kills Novak. Ettore and Francesco find Anja and the other children in a long line of refugees bound for a merchant ship that will bring them back to Italy.  Controversy  Whether a neutral point of view being captured is dubious, as the concept of Italian fascism and its association with German Nazism and their crimes in the region are only vaguely mentioned in this war drama. Many (especially Slovenian politicians and some in the left wing of Italian politics) accused the movie of being tantamount to propaganda, presenting Italians as innocent victims and not as the former allies of Nazi Germany. Free from any obligations to real history, the Italian soldiers are pictured as those of the regular army, whereas at the time and in the region the only Italian formations could be that of the Fascist Italian Social Republic. The Italian soldiers were presented as merciful and altruistic, whereas Tito's partisans were reportedly presented as ruthless assassins and rapists, the main character among them bein obsessed with taking back the son he had had from an Italian woman raped by him years before. The director claims to have been completely free of political influences during the film's production. His defenders claim that, in the movie, previous fascist crimes are vaguely recalled but not dwelled upon in order to avoid appearing to promote the idea that one crime justifies another. They point out that both good and bad Italian characters are portrayed in the film, as well as both good and bad Yugoslavs. The movie was sharply criticized in Italy, even by the Istrian and Dalmatian associations of exiles. It has been told that this delicate subject should not have been presented in a low quality movie, and should have been an historically correct production. It has been told that this movie was a terrible idea, because it was able to reopen sharp wounds between Italy and Slovenia, and in effect the movie was not welcomed in this Country. One year later, as a reaction, Slovenia introduced a new national holiday, for the \\"Unification of the Slovenian Littoral with Slovenia\\". This time the Italian political elite criticized the \\"bad taste\\" of Slovenian officials. The movie was also used by Slovene and Croatian nationalistic movements, which claimed that the production was the \\"typical\\" Italian point of view about the problem. On the contrary, the movie collected only critics in Italy where it was defended just by its \\"political sponsor\\", the \\"Alleanza Nazionale\\" party, the real ideator of this politic propaganda action. The movie received widespread criticism from the Italian left wing of politics and Slovenian public and politicians, as it portrays historical events in the way they have been described for many decades by Italian Fascists. It has been accused of being a work of propaganda, presenting helpless and innocent Italians as victims of the mindless rage of Slavic peoples, without more than just vaguely hinting to the vastly larger atrocities committed by Fascists in Yugoslavia during World War II (see also Italian war crimes) and the oppression of the Slavic population by the Italian Fascist rule of the region (1922‚Äì1943). The movie, set in Istria (today in Croatia) had to be shot in Montenegro, because of opposition from Croatian authorities to a movie that portrayed them negatively. The portrayed scenery differs a lot from the real one. Most of the controversy is based on the good vs. evil depiction made of the conflict between Italians and Slavs, with many Italians being pictured as positive and many Slavs as evil, with the exceptions of Fabrizio, an Italian, Anja (an Italian's Slavic girlfriend) and all of the children. = Supposed fascist rhetoric = In some parts of the movie, there are quotes that could echo themes dear to the extreme right of Italy. * The movie is very clear about claiming that ethnic cleansing was a planned policy of Tito's partisans. * Another supposed quote is when Francesco berates Ettore for having stopped fighting the war: ::You coward! If you had not thrown away your rifle, if those like you had defended us, my parents would not be dead! :This resembles the rhetoric of the Italian Social Republic, where a major point of propaganda was the \\"honor\\" of not surrendering to the Allies, but continuing to fight. * When Francesco questions Ettore's authority to lead the group, Don Bruno replies that: ::[...] it's always better that decisions are taken by a soldier. :This could be interpreted as support for military dictatorships * It is also claimed that Italian soldiers are pictured as pure, generous and altruistic, even though the only armed forces they could come from were the Italian Social Republics, such as the Decima Flottiglia MAS, historically infamous for their record of war crimes. = Behaviour of Slavs = The Yugoslav partisans are attributed a large number of negative traits: in order of appearance, they: * shoot German soldiers who surrendered; * one of them rapes a woman; * one tries to take his son from his mother; * burn the Italian flag; * burn school books in Italian; * threaten Italians in order to force them to give up their jobs; * force Italians out of their village and separate parents from their children; * betray their Italian allies (Italian partisans); * murder the population of entire villages and throw the people into foibe after binding them in iron wire; * throw dogs after them for a superstition; * set an orphanage ablaze; * are drunkards; * murder civilians as a means of intimidating other Italians into submission; * murder Italian partisans who should be their allies; * betray Italian soldiers who were promised to enter the resistance, and massacre them; * they do not think twice about firing on a child with a gun. The slavs presented in a better light were Anja, girlfriend of an Italian soldier, and a few other minor characters. = Supposed antisemitism = One character, Fabrizio Pavan, is one of the antagonists. He could be interpreted as a stereotypical jew from antisemitic literature: * he hides his food from the people (of which many are hungry children) who are saving him and his family; * he is unable to perform practical tasks, such as repairing his car; * he and his wife are very attached to their money and valuables; * he tries to give a child to a Slav officer in order to buy himself freedom: sacrificing children was a common blood libel against Jews through the Middle Ages; * he is unwilling to fight even if it is to save his family because of his cowardice; * as soon as the fight begins he tries to surrender, only to be shot dead in the back; * he also has a large nose, a beard, and a darker-than-average complexion. His name, Pavan, is derived from the city of Padova. Many Jews in Italy have names derived from a city or village, which used to identify their ghetto in the Middle Ages. Yet, Pavan is very common in north-eastern Italy, among gentiles.Italian surnames, a database containing data about the occurrences of surnames in Italy. Enter Pavan under Cognome (\\"surname\\") to see its diffusion. However, the director of the movie, Alberto Negrin, is a jew. Article in Italian. Negrin stated: \\"I'm jew...\\"  Inaccuracies  In addition to the political controversy, many factual mistakes can be found in the film. = Ettore's return = It is the spring of 1945. Ettore, shaved, wearing a clean uniform of the Alpini corps, still carrying his rifle, arrives at home. The armistice was in September 1943. Where has he been all this time? = Flag = When the Yugoslavian partisans enter Francesco's village, they burn the Italian monarchic flag and raise the Yugoslavian one. However, in 1945 Istria was not under the control of the Kingdom of Italy, but was directly ruled by Nazi Germany as part of the Operational Zone Adriatic Coast. The flag that would have flown over the village would then have been either the Nazi flag, or the flag of the Italian Social Republic, the Nazi puppet state headed by Benito Mussolini. In fact, the Italian monarchic flag was the flag of an enemy state. The choice of the more politically neutral monarchic flag seems a way to hide the fact that Italians were subordinate allies of Nazi Germany. Image:Flag of Italy (1861-1946).svgThis flag was burnt in the movie. Image:War_flag_of_the_Italian_Social_Republic.svgThe war flag of the Italian Social Republic. Image:Flag of Germany 1933.svgThe Nazi flag, which would have been flown in the village. Image:Flag of SFR Yugoslavia.svgThe flag the partisans raise. = Shape of Foibe = When Francesco's parents are thrown in a foiba, Francesco descends to find them dead. However, given the shape foibe have, it is unlikely that an 8-year-old child (or even a man without a rope) could climb down in a foiba and back up unassisted. = Deportation = Some Italians from Istria have pointed out that Yugoslav partisans did not embark in mass deportations during the day, but targeted specific persons and kidnapped them during the night. There are no records of deportations of children or separation of parents and children either. = Language = All Slavs speak Italian when talking to each other; this could be a way to avoid ample use of subtitles, but Italian is used by Slavs also in those scenes where Italians are present too, and are therefore able to understand what they are saying (though Istrian Slavic population could understand Italian, most Italians had no particular knowledge of the Slavic languages). Some Slavic words can be heard in the background, but are not used in the main dialogues. Further, the Slavs refer to each other as \\"Slavs\\", rather than Croatian or Slovene. In fact, the movie completely ignores the fact that Croats and Slovenes were ethnically and linguistically distinct, and operates with a fictitious \\"Slavic\\" ethnicity throughout.

The village of √âpehy was captured on 18 September by the 12th (Eastern) Division. Prelude Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front, was not eager to carry out any offensives, until the assault on the Hindenburg Line, influenced by mounting British losses from previous battles that year, over since March, them in the past six weeks. Rawlinson was kept reined in and advised by Haig to ensure his men were well rested for the eventual attack on the Line. When news arrived of the British Third Army's victory at the Battle of Havrincourt, Haig's mind was changed. On the day following the success at Havrincourt, 13 September, Haig approved Rawlinson's plan to clear German outpost positions on the high ground before the Hindenburg Line and preparations began. Battle Very few tanks could be provided for the attack, so artillery would have to be relied upon to prepare the way but in the interests of surprise they would not be able to provide a preliminary bombardment. The would instead fire concentration shots at zero hour and support the infantry with a creeping barrage and were also made available. All three corps of the Fourth Army were to take part, with V Corps of the Third Army on their left flank and on their right the French First Army (under Debeney).Map WO 153/312 V Corps (Third Army) shows dispositions from Moislains to Ronssoy The objective consisted of a fortified zone roughly deep and long, supported by subsidiary trenches and strong points. The German 2nd Army and 18th Army defended the area. On 18 September at 5.20 am, the attack opened and the troops advanced. The promised French assistance did not arrive, resulting in limited success for IX Corps on that flank. On the left flank, III Corps also found difficulty when attacking the fortifications erected at \\"the Knoll\\", Quennemont and Guillemont farms, which were held determinedly by German troops, the village was however captured by the British 12th Eastern Division (7th Norfolk, 9th Essex and 1st Cambridge). In the centre, General John Monash's two Australian divisions achieved complete and dramatic success. The 1st Australian Division and the 4th Australian Division, had a strength of some and in the course of the day captured and thirty trench mortars. They took all their objectives and advanced to a distance of about on a front. The Australian casualties were and men The attack closed as an Allied victory, with and captured. Military History Encyclopedia on the Web ‚Äì Battle of Ep√©hy However, during the battle, all but one member of \\"D\\" Company of the 1st Australian Battalion refused to take part in an attack to help a neighbouring British unit. The protest was against the battalion being sent back into combat when it had been about to be relieved. On 21 September 119 members of the company were subsequently imprisoned for desertion; this was the AIF's largest incidence of \\"combat refusal\\" during the war and formed part of a general weakening in the force's discipline due to the stresses of prolonged combat. The charges of desertion in the face of the enemy (a crime that could mean execution by firing squad in WWI) were reduced to the lesser crime of being AWOL. All bar one soldier had their charges dropped after the armistice in November. Aftermath Although √âpehy was not a massive success, it signalled an unmistakable message that the Germans were weakening and it encouraged the Allies to take further action with the Battle of St. Quentin Canal, before the Germans could consolidate their positions. The failure of the III Corps to take their last objective ‚Äì the outpost villages, would mean that the American forces would face a difficult task due to a hurried attack prior to the battle.

It was created by cooperation between Iranian ministries, the Iran Mercantile Exchange and other state and private institutions in 2005. The history of Iran Mercantile Exchange and its links with the \\"international trading floor of crude oil and petrochemical products in the Kish Island\\" (IOB) have been published. The IOB is intended as an oil bourse for petroleum, petrochemicals and gas in various currencies other than the United States dollar, primarily the euro and Iranian rial and a basket of other major (non-US) currencies. The geographical location is at the Persian Gulf island of Kish which is designated by Iran as a free trade zone.http://www.iran-daily.com/1383/2199/html/economy.htm During 2007, Iran asked its petroleum customers to pay in non US dollar currencies. By December 8, 2007, Iran reported to have converted all of its oil export payments to non-dollar currencies. The Kish Bourse was officially opened in a videoconference ceremony on 17 February 2008, despite last minute disruptions to the internet services to the Persian Gulf regions. Currently the Kish Bourse is only trading in oil-derived products, generally those used as feedstock for the plastics and pharmaceutical industries. However, officially published statements by Iranian oil minister Gholam-Hossein Nozari indicate that the second phase, to establish trading in crude oil directly, which has been suggested might one day perhaps create a \\"Caspian Crude\\" benchmark price analogous to Brent Crude or WTI will only be started after the Bourse has demonstrated a reasonable period of trouble-free running. Due to technical problems, the oil bourse never proceeded, and the plans were finally abandoned after a vote by the Iranian Parliament on 7 January 2020. Background The three current oil markers are all US dollar denominated: North America's West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI), North Sea Brent Crude, and the UAE Dubai Crude. The two major oil bourses are the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) in New York City, and the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) in London and Atlanta. As the Oil Bourse in Kish is developed through successive stages, the plan is to establish a Petrobourse as a fourth oil market, denominated by the Iranian rial, the euro and other major currencies. Iran sits on some of the largest oil and gas reserves in the world. The bourse will offer 40 kinds of oil products. Iran produces over 25 percent of the total output of petrochemical products in the Middle East. At least 30 domestic companies and 20 foreign firms are active in the oil and petrochemical industries on Kish Island. Operations At the time of the Oil Bourse's opening on Kish, the Director of the Kish Stock Exchange, Hossein Allahdadi, said that there \\"are no limitations imposed on transactions by foreign shareholders at the Oil Bourse in Kish\\". As of 2009, the Oil Bourse was a spot market for petrochemical products mainly, with plans to introduce sharia-compliant futures contracts for crude oil and petrochemicals in the future, during the second phase. Trading takes place through licensed private brokers registered with the Securities and Exchange Organization of Iran. Any company, domestic or foreign, can list their products on the exchange for as long as they meet the listing criteria. Global standards for Islamic derivatives were set in 2010. The ‚ÄúHedging Master Agreement‚Äù provides a structure under which institutions can trade derivatives such as profit-rate and currency swaps. Timeline 2000/2001 Chris Cook, the former Director of Compliance & Market Supervision at the International Petroleum Exchange became aware in the course of an IPE disciplinary case that IPE Brant Crude Oil contract market settlement prices were being routinely manipulated by major traders and investment banks. While his complaint to UK regulators of settlement price manipulation was dismissed by the appointed Commissioner on a technicality the routine nature of settlement price manipulation subsequently became common knowledge. February 2001 Chris Cook and an Iranian colleague Mehdi Moslehi - an exchange trading technology consultant ‚Äì agreed that Iran was well placed to provide the necessary liquidity to create a Middle Eastern Benchmark contract. May 2001 Mehdi Moslehi subsequently met the Governor of Central Bank of Iran (CBI) ‚Äì the late Mohsen Nurbakhsh - in London and suggested that Iran should initiate establishment of a new Middle Eastern Oil Benchmark price. Governor Nurbakhsh requested a formal outline proposal in the form of a letter which he undertook to convey to Iran's petroleum ministry. 25 June 2001 Mehdi Moslehi wrote to Dr Nurbakhsh above suggesting that Iran consider establishing a Middle East benchmark oil price. 2003 Iran‚Äôs oil ministry decided to establish a domestic oil bourse and Minister Zanganeh appointed, Dr Mohammad Javad Asemipour as the Executive Director of Oil, Gas, Petrochemical Products Exchange Project. Dr Asemipour established a tender to select a contractor to undertake the project and as a result Wimpole Limited (Mehdi Moslehi and Chris Cook as directors) entered into a joint venture with Tehran Stock Exchange Services Company to lead what became known as the ‚ÄúWimpole Consortium‚Äù which included leading technology providers and exchange expertise. May 17, 2004 Mehdi Moslehi and Chris Cook presented the Wimpole Consortium oil exchange proposal in Tehran at the Central Bank of Iran and in June 2014 Dr Mohammad Javad Asemipour appointed Wimpole Consortium as the contractor to implement the oil bourse of Iran. August 2004 Mehdi Moslehi presented the pre- feasibility study for development of Iran Oil Bourse to Wimpole's joint venture partner Tehran Stock Exchange Services Company and the pre-feasibility study report was passed to Dr Mohammad Javad Asemipour. 2005 The newly appointed project management used the above report to request a licence for trading of bourse from Iran‚Äôs Exchange Board and the new Exchange received a licence to trade in the free zone of Kish Island in the Persian Gulf. The building and trading platform were implemented in Kish Island of Iran. The Iranian oil bourse, first reported in 2005, initially had a widely publicised opening date of March 20, 2006. which is the Iranian New Year, Nauroz. According to an April 2005 report, the Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE), the Wimpole Consortium and a private staff fund for retired petroleum workers were to form a consortium developing the exchange. January 2006 Chris Cook of the Wimpole Consortium referred to delays in the process due to the election to the presidency of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and subsequent difficulty in appointing a new oil minister acceptable both to the president and parliament. February 2006 Wimpole consortium complained that their invoices which used to receive the trading license has not paid. March 2006 the Petroleum Minister of Iran, Kazem Vaziri Hamaneh, announced that due to \\"technical glitches\\", the Bourse launch was postponed, with no new date set. However, as of April 26 Iran had restarted its move to open the oil market, and Kazem announced the bourse was set to open the first week of May. May 2006 Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance Davoud Danesh-Jafari said the Oil Ministry has a two-month deadline for presenting the Articles of Association of the Iranian Oil Bourse. Danesh- Jafari said that the euro had not yet been finalized as the legal tender of transactions in the oil bourse, and the final decision about that depends upon the Oil Ministry‚Äôs proposed IOB Articles of Association. July 2006 a building has been purchased and the projected opening date was originally slated for September 2006. On September 15, Oil Minister Kazem Vaziri-Hamaneh stated that all preparatory requirements had been arranged for launching the oil stock market in the country. However, the launch had still not occurred. December 2006 Bloomberg cited two Iranian newspapers reporting Iran's Minister of Economy Davoud Danesh-Ja'fari Iran as wanting to cut US dollar based transactions to a minimum. March 2007 The New York Times reported that China's state-run Zhuhai Zhenrong Trading, the biggest buyer of Iranian crude worldwide, began paying for its oil in euros late last year. Iranian officials have said for months that more than half the OPEC member's customers switched their payment currency away from the dollar as Tehran seeks to diversify its reserves, but news of the Zhenrong change is the first outside confirmation. Japan has also announced that it would be willing to switch to Yen from US Dollars. Iran's central banker announced in March 2007 that Iran had cut its holding of U.S.-dollar assets to around 20% of its foreign reserves in response to U.S. hostility. September 2007 Japan's Nippon Oil has agreed to buy Iranian oil using yen. December 2007 Iran stops accepting U.S. dollars for oil. January 2008 Iran's Finance Minister Davoud Danesh-Jafari told reporters that the bourse will be opened during the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution (February 1‚Äì11). February 2008 On February 4, the Iranian Cabinet approved the creation of the oil bourse in two stages - first a raw oil exchange and secondly an oil byproducts exchange. The Ministry of Finance and Economics, the Oil Ministry, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Central Bank of Iran are required to create a workgroup to coordinate the project, and the Iran Commodities Bourse Company is given the task of carrying out the project. The communique from the Cabinet states that the \\"Ministry of Finance and Economics Affairs is required to take measures in making the petrochemical byproducts bourse operational by the end of February 2008.\\" 31 December 2009 Orr Litchfield LLP the law firm who developed the contract agreement for the report sued two directors of Wimpole Ltd and recovered the unpaid their invoices from the directors of Wimpole Ltd personal assets. =Opening= February 17, 2008: The Iranian Oil Bourse was inaugurated in a video conference ceremony from the capital Tehran attended by ministers of oil, finance and economic affairs as well as chairman of Iran's Stock Exchange and a number of other officials and financial experts. The transactions will be made in Iranian rial, yen, euro and other major currencies. The Iranian Oil Bourse will probably accept Russian ruble as well. The first transaction of the IOB took place at 9:30 the following morning, when 2200 tonnes of low- density polyethylene (LD-PE), held in 100 tonne cases, were traded. November 2008: According to Chairman of Board of Directors for Iranian Oil Bourse Mehdi Karbasian ever since the launch of the first phase of the bourse, transactions worth over $1.5 billion have been made on different oil and petrochemical products.http://www.iran-daily.com/1387/3276/html/national.htm October 2009: IRNA reported that \\"National Petrochemical Company's Managing Director Adel Nejad-Salim said in the opening ceremony that all petrochemical products will be gradually offered on the market.\\" In the first phase, only petrochemical products such as polyethylene and methanol were traded on a spot basasis and in Iranian Rial. However, with the completion of the second phase, crude and by-products of oil can also be traded on the exchange in both Iranian Rial and Euro. November 2009: IME reported that \\"the international trading floor of crude oil and petrochemical products in the Kish Island was put into operation.\\" June 2011: Iran summarized the 3 phases of Kish Stock Exchange's opening roadmap early June 2011: Iran started fuel oil transaction in Kish Oil Bourse : 35,000 tons at 621.35 dollar per ton and payment was made through Euro or Dirham accounts overseas.

Series creator Rob Thomas wrote the story, and collaborated with Diane Ruggiero to write the teleplay. The season finale was directed by Michael Fields, and was first aired on May 10, 2005 in the United States on UPN. The finale concludes the storyline of Lilly Kane's murder, as Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) finally discovers the identity of the murderer after investigating the mystery with her father Keith Mars (Enrico Colantoni) throughout the season. Thomas said that the finale was more ambitious than the average episode, requiring a larger budget and more filming than usual. \\"Leave It to Beaver\\" was watched by 2.99 million American viewers on its original airing. Critical reaction to the episode was generally positive, and several critics praised Thomas' use of red herrings. Background The first season revolves around Veronica's investigation of her best friend Lilly's murder. Prior to the murder, Veronica was dumped by her boyfriend, Duncan Kane (Teddy Dunn), who was also Lilly's brother. After Lilly was killed, Veronica's father, County Sheriff Keith Mars, accused Lilly's father, popular software billionaire Jake Kane (Kyle Secor), of being involved in the murder. This provoked Neptune's wrath and Keith's ousting as sheriff in a recall election. Veronica's mother, Lianne Mars (Corinne Bohrer), developed a drinking problem and left town. Veronica's \\"09er\\" friends--wealthy students from the fictional 90909 ZIP code--forced her to choose between them and her father; Veronica chose her father. After being voted out as sheriff, Keith opens a private investigation agency, Mars Investigations, where Veronica works part-time. Veronica helps her father solve cases and conducts her own investigations on behalf of friends and acquaintances at school. Veronica discovers new evidence which suggests that Abel Koontz (Christian Clemenson), the man imprisoned after confessing to Lilly's murder, is innocent. As Veronica delves deeper into the murder case, she also works on other investigations, seeks her mother's whereabouts and deals with the aftermath of being drugged and raped during an \\"09er\\" party. Things get more complicated when Veronica falls into a relationship with Lilly's ex-boyfriend Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring), who for a time held Veronica partly responsible for Lilly's death and went out of his way to harass her. In the previous episode, Keith proves the innocence of convicted murderer Koontz, who had falsely confessed to murdering Lilly. Veronica, who believed that she had been raped the previous year at a party, discovers that she and Duncan had sex while under the influence of GHB; Duncan left that next morning because he believed Veronica was his sister. Veronica spends time with her boyfriend Logan in his pool house, but discovers a hidden video system linking to cameras focused on the bed. Veronica is shocked and goes home, only to find her mother Lianne has returned from rehab. Plot After reading a newspaper article revealing Koontz's innocence, Duncan demands the truth from his parents, Jake and Celeste Kane (Lisa Thornhill), who tell him that they arrived home one night to find Duncan covered in blood and holding Lilly's body. Cassidy \\"Beaver\\" Casablancas (Kyle Gallner) tells Veronica that on the weekend of Lilly's murder, he had gone surfing in Mexico with Logan and Dick Casablancas (Ryan Hansen), but that Logan had driven back to Neptune to see Lilly. Veronica and Keith discover that a shot glass Logan bought for Lilly in Mexico is on the list of evidence found in Lilly's bedroom and car. Talking to Keith on the phone, Veronica suggests that Logan is the murderer; she is overheard by the leader of the Latino biker gang PCHers, Eli \\"Weevil\\" Navarro (Francis Capra), who had a relationship with Lilly. Keith ends his relationship with Wallace's mother Alicia Fennel (Erica Gimpel), to give Lianne a second chance. He sues the Kanes for refusing to pay the $50,000 reward for finding Duncan; they agree to pay if Veronica signs away any future claim to their estate. Once Veronica signs, Keith shows her the DNA test that proves he is her father, meaning Veronica was never a potential Kane heir. Logan is arrested, and once released he angrily breaks up with Veronica for providing the evidence against him. He tells her that when he saw Lilly after returning from Mexico, he knew their relationship was over and wrote her a letter, which he left in Lilly's car along with the shot glass. Veronica realizes that the letter was never found, and sneaks into a dinner party at the Kane household to search Lilly's room for it. Duncan finds her in the room, and they discover several videotapes which show Lilly having an affair with Logan's father, Aaron Echolls (Harry Hamlin). Veronica concludes that when Aaron learned that Lilly had taken the tapes and she refused to return them, he killed her in a fit of rage, leading to Duncan's discovery of Lilly's body and his parents' mistaken belief that he killed her. In Lilly's room, as a hidden person watches from a closet, Veronica calls Keith and tells him that she will bring home the tapes, noting that Aaron is at the party. Before she leaves, Veronica tells Duncan that they are not related. Elsewhere, Logan drunkenly stands on a bridge railing; Weevil and the PCHers arrive and menacingly close in on him. As she drives home, Veronica discovers Aaron is in the back seat of her car, and intentionally crashes into a power pole to escape him. Although both are knocked unconscious, Veronica awakens first and flees to the back porch of a nearby house, hiding the tapes in various places as she runs. Aaron traps Veronica in a refrigerator on the porch, demanding she reveal where the tapes are, and when Keith arrives, Aaron sets the refrigerator on fire. Keith is burnt while freeing Veronica, and Aaron is hit by a truck while trying to escape. The police arrive and Keith and Aaron are taken away on stretchers as Aaron is read his rights. Jake vows to see Aaron fry for his actions and is also arrested, for obstruction of justice. Keith wakes up in hospital to find Alicia by his side. Veronica arrives home and tells her mother to leave; she knows that Lianne is still drinking and did not finish her rehab. Lianne packs her bags, taking the $50,000 Kane settlement check as she leaves. Veronica dreams about floating on pool rafts with Lilly, in a pool covered with flowers, and they say their final goodbyes. Veronica wakes up and answers the door, telling the unseen visitor, \\"I was hoping it would be you.\\" Production Rob Thomas was so impressed by Amanda Seyfried that he used her three or four more times than he initially had planned in the first season. The first season of Veronica Mars features a different \\"case of the week\\" each episode, and the season-long mystery of Lilly Kane's murder. In addition to developing a separate mystery for each episode, the writers also had to provide clues that would lead to the murder's resolution in the season finale. The murder mystery plot was planned from the beginning of the season and the killer's identity remained the same throughout production. Thomas said that at the beginning of the season, \\"I know the broad strokes, I know who did it, I know how it was done, I know the big arcs, but we're always filling in the details. Those are week to week. It's a week to week challenge in the writers room figuring out how much information we want to dole out to the audience.\\" Although series creator Rob Thomas always planned on Harry Hamlin's character Aaron Echolls as the murderer, this reveal almost didn't happen because Hamlin was almost unavailable to shoot the season finale due to a movie he had booked in Australia. However, he decided to continue on Veronica Mars instead. Although the season's plan was changed very little, Thomas said that Logan became a much bigger character than anticipated. Thomas attributed this to Jason Dohring being an engaging performer, and the crew wanting to write scenes for him. While the budget for each episode was around $1.7 million, an extra $400,000 was spent for the finale. Filming was extended by one full day with the first unit and an extra three days of filming with the second unit. Thomas promised that there would be \\"more action than you've ever seen on Veronica Mars.\\" Speaking about the episode's filming, Thomas said, \\"our final Lilly moment is just beautiful. I think Veronica and Lilly saying goodbye to each other is what people want to see. As much as who killed Lilly Kane.\\" For the finale, Thomas promised \\"80 percent total satisfaction. People will know who killed Lilly Kane. And there won't be that twist at the end that 'perhaps they didn't do it.' I'm not going to be leaving people like that. However, at the end of the episode, it gives us a pretty big cliffhanger question as well.\\" Reception =Ratings= \\"Leave It to Beaver\\" was watched by 2.99 million American viewers on its original airing, ranking number 98 out of 112 in the weekly charts. This was an increase over the pilot, which was viewed by 2.49 million American viewers. The first season averaged 2.5 million viewers per episode. =Reviews= Many reviewers praised Kristen Bell's performance in the episode, with one reviewer writing that she \\"churned out gut-wrenching, Emmy-worthy scenes.\\" Jesse Hassenger of PopMatters found the finale to be \\"breathlessly paced\\". However, the writer was also dissatisfied with the cliffhanger, and hoped that the second season would not increase the series' focus on Veronica's relationships. Hassenger wrote, \\"so far, the series has eschewed the relationship angst so common in other teen- centric shows; Neptune hearts get broken, yes, but the show never stoops to that will-they-or-won't-they dynamic. Veronica is that rare television character who's too interesting for love triangles.\\" Filip Vukcevic of IGN thought that while the resolution of the murder was satisfying, it could have been better; \\"I liked the way everything played out, but I didn't get the Sixth Sense moment I was hoping for. I wanted the season finale to blow my mind, instead all it got out of me was, 'Ah, I see. That's cool.'\\" Vukcevic wrote that the pace of the season increased exponentially, and was at its best during the final episode. Both reviewers praised Rob Thomas's use of red herrings. Vukcevic felt that \\"as the finale approaches you are led to believe that the murderer could be any one of several different people - not any easy thing to pull off convincingly. What makes good TV is audience participation. If you feel for a character or are puzzling out a mystery, you're involved. And when you're involved, you're having a good time.\\" Hassenger cited Lianne, Duncan and Logan as the main red herrings. Mike Duffy of the Detroit Free Press included the episode on his list of \\"12 season finales you won't want to miss\\", citing \\"great writing, a merrily dark sense of humor and Bell's self- assured smart-girl charm\\" as the main reasons to watch. Screenwriter and director Kevin Smith praised the \\"seat-of-your-pants\\" season finale, writing that it managed to \\"thread the needle with the Lilly Kane murder so well, it never feels marginalized or played out over 22 episodes\\". Smith compared the year-long murder mystery to that of Twin Peaks, stating that \\"unlike Peaks, when the murderer is revealed and the storyline wrapped up in the final [episode], it doesn't feel like the show's outlived its relevance; thanks to the crisp writing, the deft fleshing-out of the Mars universe and the endearing cast, you‚Äôre left wanting Veronica's story to continue.\\" Price Peterson, writing for TV.com, gave the episode an extremely positive review, writing that it was \\"stellar‚Ä¶just a perfect hour of television and a fantastic end to the season. I still can't believe how well they pulled off the mystery. I did NOT see Aaron Echolls as the killer.\\" Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave a glowing review, praising the Keith-Veronica dynamic, the conclusions to the story arcs, and the final sequence after it is revealed that Aaron is the murderer. \\"It‚Äôs also an interesting choice to have the reveal come about two- thirds of the way through the episode, and have the episode end with a dramatic chase and fight scene. Veronica has so rarely been in direct personal danger that having Aaron Echolls chase and capture her, and having Keith show up for a brutal fight and rescue, is jarring. And I think it is effective.\\" Television Without Pity gave the episode an \\"A\\". Give Me My Remote listed the episode as the third best episode of Veronica Mars, writing \\"everything about this episode is superb, from the plotlines, to the stunts, and the performances. Kristen Bell, in particular, churned out gut- wrenching, Emmy- worthy scenes.\\" IGN ranked the episode as the best episode of Veronica Mars, writing \\"Once you realize Aaron is the one, you're glued to your seat for the rest of the episode, possibly hiding behind a blanket. Getting to this reveal was worth the season-long wait.\\" BuzzFeed listed the episode as the second best episode of the series, calling it \\"one of the most intense, thrilling, and emotional episodes of the show.\\" On a similar list, TV Line ranked the episode as the fourth best episode of the show.

Prior to its acquisition by Altice, the company was the seventh largest cable operator with 1.5 million residential and 90,000 business subscribers. After Altice acquired Cablevision Systems Corporation (Cablevision) on November 30, 2016 Suddenlink was combined with Cablevision to become Altice's American division known as Altice USA. Together with Optimum, the service brand name used by Cablevision for its products, Altice USA became the United States' fourth largest cable operator with 4.6 million subscribers and the sixth largest pay tv service provider with 3.50 million subscribers. History The predecessor to Suddenlink Communications was Cebridge Communications that was formed in September 2003 by its parent company Cequel III. Cequel III was formed in January 2002 by Jerry Kent, a former CEO for Charter Communications, Charter's co-founder Howard Wood and Dan Dergstein, a telecommunications lawyer. The company invested in Classic Communications on February 10, 2003 shortly after it emerged from bankruptcy. Classic Communications was founded in 1992 by Merritt Belisle and Steven Seach and the company was taken public on October 31, 1999 and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on November 14, 2001. Classic had a total of 325,000 subscribers when Cequel III assumed management of the cable provider on February 10, 2003. Shortly after Cequel III acquired cable systems located in Texas with 27,000 subscribers from Canadian telecommunications provider Shaw Communications. In August 2003 Cequel acquired 81,000 subscribers from Alliance Communications Partners. After this acquisition Cequel formed Cebridge Connections which consisted of all the cable systems Cequel acquired up to this point. The combined company had 450,000 subscribers by the time the news was announced on September 15, 2003. Logo of Cebridge Communications from 2001-2006 The company continued to acquire smaller cable systems after it became Cebridge including 78,000 from Thompson Cablevision on January 26, 2004 expanding the company into sixteen states. The company's coverage increased to twenty-three states when it closed its acquisitions of 19,000 customers from Tele-Media on June 3, 2004 and 40,000 customers from USA Media Systems on August 19, 2004. Cebridge Connections announced it would change its name to Suddenlink Communications in a soft launch on May 1, 2006 after the company completed its acquisition of 869,000 customers from Cox Communications. The hard launch of the re-branding occurred in July after the company completed its acquisition of 250,000 customers from Charter Communications after these acquisitions the company increased its total size to 1.4 million. After Suddenlink completed its acquisition of the cable system from Charter it focused on upgrading its existing infrastructure that was deemed \\"under-served\\" by previous owners. Suddenlink completed a $600 million debt offering on November 5, 2009 which allowed the company to make significant upgrades. The result of the upgrades allowed the company to expand its HD services and increase the number of HDTV channels while its broadband infrastructure was upgraded to DOCSIS 3.0 technology allowing for faster broadband speeds across its footprint. In July 2013 Suddenlink was the first major cable provider that all technicians and installers with the company for 90 days or more had obtained at least one professional certifications from Society of Cable Telecommunications Engineers. During the same month Suddenlink and TiVo announced that Suddenlink would distribute co-branded TiVo set top boxes to its subscriber base which allows the company to provide whole home DVR services and out of home streaming of recorded content. Four years after its last acquisition Suddenlink gained 8,000 subscribers it acquired from Windjammer Communications on August 1, 2010. On April 1, 2011 Suddenlink closed its acquisition of NPG Cable from the News-Press & Gazette Company. Suddenlink would go on to complete two more acquisitions in 2014 the first was Northand Communications that closed on January 2 and New Wave Communications that closed on October 1. Actor Colin Price was selected and filmed over 100 commercials appearing as their spokesman from 2013-2016. =Acquisition by Altice= Suddenlink announced on July 18, 2012 that the company reached an agreement to be acquired for $6.6 billion by BC Partners, CPP Investment Board and Suddenlink's management team, led by Chairman and CEO Jerry Kent. Prior to this Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Quadrangle and Oaktree Capital Management were the majority holders of the company. Altice and Suddenlink announced on May 20, 2015 that Altice agreed to acquire 70% of Suddenlink in a deal valued at $9.1 billion. As part of the deal BC Partners will retain 15% voting share and 18.2% in equity while CPP Investment Board will retain 15% voting share and 11.8% in equity. At the time of the announcement Suddenlink was the seventh largest cable operator with 1.5 million residential and 90,000 business subscribers. The deal closed on December 21, 2015. Altice also announced on September 17 that year it would acquire Cablevision for $17.7 billion and completed the deal on June 21, 2016. After both deals were completed Altice USA became the fourth largest cable operator in the country with 4.6 million subscribers and the sixth largest pay television operator with 3.50 million subscribers. Altice USA announced on April 11, 2017 the company has filed for an initial public offering. The company plans to raise up to $100 million with the IPO. Altice NV the parent company of Altice USA announced on May 24, 2017 that \\"all consumer-facing brands across the globe will change.\\" Altice stated the re-branding would be complete by the second quarter in 2018. Carriage disputes Suddenlink has been involved with two high-profile carriage disputes over the years. The first was with Sinclair Broadcasting Group over two local stations it operates in the Huntington- Charleston, West Virginia designated market area (DMA). The dispute became public on June 30, 2006 and after a month-long public battle was resolved on August 8, 2006. The second involved Viacom and its cable channels Nickelodeon, MTV, Spike, TV Land. VH1 and various spin-off channels. =Sinclair Broadcasting Group= After Suddenlink completed its acquisition of cable systems from Charter Communications in 2006 the company entered into a public carriage dispute with Sinclair Broadcasting Group over two local television stations in the region. Sinclair owns and operates WCHS-TV the local ABC affiliate in the Huntington-Charleston, West Virginia DMA. Sinclair also operates the local Fox affiliate WVAH-TV which is owned by Cunningham Broadcasting and operated through a local marketing agreement (LMA) by Sinclair. The dispute impacted a total of 240,000 Suddenlink subscribers, 200,000 of which were included in the Huntington-Charleston DMA proper. The dispute also impacted 40,000 subscribers in the nearby Bluefield-Beckley-Oak Hill and Parkersburg DMAs where Charter imported the signals of WCHS and WVAH because Beckley did not have a Fox affiliate and Parkersburg lacked an ABC affiliate at the time. The agreement between Charter and Sinclair had expired prior to Suddenlink's acquisition. Both parties began negotiations in May 2006 before the acquisition was completed. Sinclair announced on June 30, 2006 it was not able to reach an agreement with Suddenlink. Sinclair argued that Suddenlink's proposals included no compensation and no response to their counteroffer. Without a retransmission consent agreement Suddenlink would not be allowed to carry the two stations on any of its cable systems. During the dispute Sinclair posted a letter on the websites of the two stations and began to notify viewers with scrolling crawl messages on the bottom of the screen encouraging them to switch to another provider like DirecTV or Dish Network. While this was a comparable solution for the Huntington-Charleston area the two satellite providers did not provide the two stations to viewers in Beckley or Parkersburg. Suddenlink subsequently filed an Emergency Retransmission Consent Complaint with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on July 5, 2006 claiming Sinclair failed to negotiate in good faith for the stations and demanded Suddenlink to stop carriage of the two stations during a Nielsen rating sweeps period. The following day Sinclair also submitted a filing with the FCC requesting the Commission order Suddenlink to cease carriage of its signals. Suddenlink claimed that Sinclair was originally asking for $4 million in fees over the three-year life of an agreement but changed the offer to a one time fee of $200 per subscriber ($40 million total) and $1 per month in subscriber fees ($2.4 million annually) in order to carry the stations after Sinclair found out how much Suddenlink paid Charter for the systems. Suddenlink claimed it informed Sinclair it was obligated to carry the stations until the end of the Nielson sweeps period however Sinclair disputed this was applicable and that the rule was to benefit broadcasters, not distributors. On July 3, 2006 Sinclair pulled the out of market signals but left the stations on in Suddenlink's Huntington-Charleston systems. On July 27, 2006 both parties agreed to a temporary extension which kept the stations on Suddenlink's systems until August 7 if an agreement was not reached. Suddenlink and Sinclair reached an agreement on August 8, 2006 and withdrew their FCC petitions. While the terms of the agreement were not made public Pete Able, Suddenlink's vice president of government relations, stated the company \\"made it very clear\\" that the $40 million fee \\"was never something we could find mutually agreeable.\\" =Viacom= Prior to October 1, 2014 Suddenlink carried cable channels from Viacom, including BET, CMT, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, Paramount Network, TV Land, VH1 and various smaller spin-off networks. The two companies were able to reach an agreement at the end of 2010 for continued carriage of Viacom's channels that was to end on September 30, 2014. Viacom had been involved in notable contract discussion in the past including a media battle with satellite provider DirecTV in 2012 which resulted in their channels being unavailable for nine days before reaching an agreement. After Viacom's channels were pulled from smaller provider Cable ONE on April 1, 2014, the cable provider replaced them with other channels. The contract negotiations became public on September 25, 2014 after five months of talks broke down between both companies. Suddenlink claimed Viacom wanted a 50% increase in fees for its programming despite its ratings decreasing. Viacom rebutted stating it attracts the greatest share of viewing of any cable provider. Suddenlink noted the majority of its customer base \\"do not want the Viacom channels\\" and did not want to pay more for Viacom's channels and wanted others instead. After the deadline passed, all Viacom channels were pulled from Suddenlink's lineup on October 1, 2014. Viacom claimed that Suddenlink rejected one of its own proposals and informed them they would drop the channels. Suddenlink maintained that Viacom rejected every proposal the company made to continue carrying Viacom's channels. Suddenlink reorganized their channel lineups to replace the Viacom channels some of the replacements were already available to Suddenlink while some were not previously available. Suddenlink replaced Viacom's channels with twenty other channels including FXX, Hallmark Movies & Mysteries, Investigation Discovery, OWN, Universal Kids, TheBlaze, Pivot and Up. Due to Suddenlink's size the company received positive reception in the media saying the decision could inspire other mid-small size operators. Six months after dropping Viacom's channels Suddenlink's then-CEO Jerry Kent stated 2%-2.5% of its video subscribers dropped their service. He also noted the some of the replacement channels were viewed more than some of the dropped channels. Despite losing some video subscribers Kent also stated \\"meeting the programmer‚Äôs demands would have been more costly. When Pivot ceased operations, Suddenlink started carried i24 News.\\" Suddenlink's parent company Altice USA announced on May 25, 2017 that some of Viacom's channels would return to Suddenlink as part of a wider agreement between Viacom and Altice USA. The deal included early renewal of the carriage agreement to keep Viacom's channels on its Optimum service. Viacom and Altice USA did not announce which Viacom channels or the date they would return to Suddenlink systems. Suddenlink has reached an agreement to bring back Viacom channels in Texas and Oklahoma. Controversial practices Starting in 2011 Suddenlink began to implement data usage limits, also known as data caps, on its broadband services on all its service plans. After exceeding the data allowance for a particular service plan an overage charge of $10 per 50 GB block is billed to the customer. Shortly after data usage limits began to roll out across Suddenlink's territory customers began to report the meter used was inaccurate. One example highlighted one user's router measured that 2.22 GB of data was used in one day while Suddenlink's meter showed 23 GB of data was used in the same period. Another user questioned a customer service representative how her equipment logged 12 GB of data used when electricity was out. By August 27, 2012, the company temporarily suspended its data usage policy while a third party was hired to validate the accuracy of its metering systems. By June 3, 2013, Suddenlink had resumed its data usage limits policy and began charging overages. After Altice completed its acquisition of Suddenlink the company added back unlimited usage plans for its top two tiers only on April 1, 2016. Altice USA and its Optimum branded services have been criticized for a policy change in where if a subscriber cancels one or all of their services before the end of their billing cycle they do not receive a refund. Altice USA has implemented this policy change for both its Suddenlink and Optimum branded services. This policy went into effect for Suddenlink subscribers on June 1, 2016 and for Optimum on October 10, 2016. On May 30, 2017, a class action lawsuit was filed against Altice USA claiming that the company illegally changed the terms and conditions of its cancellation policy and did not provide adequate notice to customers. The lawsuit also claims the company broke New York's General Business Law for deceptive practices and unjust enrichment. Altice has stated subscribers were given advance notice of the new policy and that customer service representatives are trained to tell departing customers billing continues until the end of the billing cycle so they can choose to disconnect at that time.

The squadron, known as the \\"Black Knights\\", was based at Marine Corps Air Station New River, North Carolina, and normally fell under the command of Marine Aircraft Group 26 (MAG-26) and the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing (2nd MAW). They were the last east coast CH-46 Sea Knight squadron to transition to the Osprey. VMM-264 was decommissioned on June 24, 2020. Mission Provide assault support of combat troops, supplies and equipment during amphibious operations. History =Early years= The Black Knights of HMM-264 were activated on June 30, 1959. Originally designated as Marine Medium Transportation Squadron Light 264, it was later re-designated to its present title, Marine Medium Helicopter 264, in February 1962. In the fall of 1961, the squadron was called upon to assist in the evacuation and resupply of victims of Hurricane Hattie, which hit Belize. This tasking was the first mission in a now long-standing tradition of humanitarian service. On April 28, 1965, HMM-264 conducted the Marine Corps' first night all-helicopter assault into an unsecured landing zone during combat conditions in Santa Domingo, Dominican Republic from the deck of the USS BOXER during Operation Power Pack. Between HMM-264 and the LSTs more than 600 civilians were evacuated from the Embajador Hotel.WarrenAmerican Spartans, p. 264. This event marked the first landing of U.S. Marines on Dominican soil since the early 1930s. It was also the first ship-to-shore heliborne lift over a hostile beach without supporting units ashore. Over the course of the operation, the American embassy was secured and over 1,750 American citizens were evacuated from the war-torn Dominican Republic. In May 1965, HMM-264 was the first Marine helicopter squadron to surpass 25,000 mishap free flight hours. Over the next several years, the squadron maintained its demonstrated high standard of professional excellence by logging 30,000, 40,000, and 50,000 mishap free flight hour milestones. In 1968, the squadron retired the last of its aging fleet of UH-34 helicopters, receiving in its place the Boeing-Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight aircraft. =The 1970s and 1980s= Old HMM-264 insignia. HMM-264 served as part of the Multinational Peacekeeping Force in Beirut, Lebanon in 1983. Amongst other contributions, the squadron rescued a number of Lebanese civilians stranded by snow in the Chauf Mountains, resulting in a number of squadron awards including the Defense Transportation Safety Award, the Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal, the Navy Unit Commendation, and the 1983 Chief of Naval Operations Aviation Safety Award. Throughout the early 1980s, the Black Knights were frequent visitors to the Mediterranean as the Aviation Combat Element (ACE) for deploying east coast Marine Amphibious Units supporting Landing Force Sixth Fleet (LF6F) commitments. During this period, the squadron participated in numerous exercises and contingency operations from Spain to Lebanon. In 1987, HMM-264 became the first ACE to deploy with AV-8B Harriers and elements from the Marine Air Control Group (MACG). Deployed on the USS Nassau (LHA-4), the squadron participated in Spanish, Italian, and French PHILBEXs. These additions to the ACE force list later became the norm for deploying LF6F Marine Expeditionary Units (MEU). =The 1990s= In January 1990 (some reports say May 1989), upon returning from LF6F 2-90, HMM-264 was tasked to support Operation Top Kick off the coast of Colombia. The squadron provided support throughout this event, which culminated in the Presidential drug summit in Cartagena, Colombia in February 1990. The Black Knights earned a Joint Meritorious Unit Citation for their efforts during the operation. In April 1991, the squadron was diverted from operations in Sardinia and sailed to Iskendrun, Turkey. For 92 days, the Black Knights acted as the lead aviation element for coalition efforts to provide assistance and security to the Kurdish refugees in northern Iraq as part of Operation Provide Comfort. During the first two weeks of Operation Provide Comfort, the Black Knights flew more than 1000 hours delivering more than 450 tons of relief supplies to the isolated Kurdish camps high in the mountains of Iraq. The squadron was awarded the Joint Meritorious Unit Commendation, Humanitarian Service Medal, and the Southwest Asia Service Medal with Bronze Star device. In June 1994, the Black Knights celebrated the squadron‚Äôs 35th anniversary. By August, the squadron had again reinforced and embarked aboard USS WASP as the ACE for Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force (SPMAGTF) Caribbean and subsequently deployed in support of Operation Support Democracy and Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti. On September 20, 1994, HMM-264 participated in a vertical assault of the Cap Haitian Airport and port facilities. This event marked the first Marine landing in Haiti since the early 1900s. Over the course of these operations, HMM-264 also supported a variety of missions including raids, logistical support, humanitarian service flights, and MEDEVAC support. The squadron received the Humanitarian Service Medal and the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for its support to these operations. During the spring of 1995, the squadron returned to the Mediterranean as the ACE of the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU). During this period, HMM-264 flew 99 fixed wing sorties and 36 rotary wing sorties in support of Operation Deny Flight and Operation Decisive Endeavor in Bosnia-Herzegovina. (HMM-264) transports troops out of Monrovia, at Roberts International Airport, Liberia, during Joint Task Force (JTF) Liberia in 1996 In June 1996, with 66 hours of notification, the Black Knights deployed with SPMAGTF Liberia to conduct embassy reinforcement, security, and resupply operations in the West African city of Monrovia, capital of Liberia. HMM-264 deployed four (4) CH-46E and two (2) UH-1N aircraft aboard the USS Ponce (LPD-15) and set sail across the Atlantic Ocean. Over a two-month period the Black Knights operated out of Freetown, Sierra Leone, supporting both fellow Marines and the U.S. Embassy despite austere conditions and the logistical challenges of long-distance operations. The squadron received the Humanitarian Service Medal and the Joint Meritorious Commendation Medal for its service. HMM-264 provided the first NATO TACAIR assets to operate ashore in Bosnia-Herzegovina since the signing of the Dayton Peace Accords. HMM-264 returned from another deployment in August 1998 and earned the Armed Forces Service Medal, Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, and a Meritorious Unit Commendation. HMM-264 was also selected as the Marine Corps Aviation Association, Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron of the Year for 1998. In September 1999, the Black Knights conducted a hurricane evacuation in advance of the approach of Hurricane Floyd. The squadron returned to flood ravaged North Carolina and provided support to Federal Emergency Management Agency and the citizens of North Carolina. The Black Knights conducted relief missions and facilitated the movement of congressional members and other VIPs throughout the affected area. In early December, the squadron provided support to the MV-22 Operational Test Evaluation by conducting the first shipboard interoperability training on board USS Saipan (LHA-2). =Global War on Terror= Two CH-46 \\"Sea Knights\\" soar away as they transport Marines injured in a simulated improvised explosive device attack during a level one and level two casualty evacuation exercise performed by 2nd Medical Battalion, 2nd Marine Logistics Group, at Camp Lejeune on October 31, 2007. On March 5, 2003, the squadron embarked on a planned eight-month deployment on the maiden voyage of the USS Iwo Jima (LHD-7). The squadron conducted operations in Northern Iraq, which started on 14 April 2003 and lasted two weeks. Six CH-46E and six CH-53Es flew over from the Mediterranean Sea into Irbil and Mosul Iraq. Historically, this flight is the longest self-deployed flight into land operations by any MEU. In support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, the squadron flew reconnaissance and presence flights in the northern area of Iraq. During the squadron‚Äôs deployment it was the ready ARG for over a month in the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, and exercise Djibouti-Ex in Djibouti, Africa. For two months the squadron flew in support of Joint Task Force Liberia, to stabilize post civil war Liberia until ECOWAS military forces were in place. In October, the Black Knights returned home after nearly eight months on deployment. The squadron was awarded the Humanitarian Service Medal for operations in Liberia and the new Global War on Terrorism (Expeditionary) Medal for Operations in Iraq, the Persian Gulf, and the Horn of Africa. In January 2005, the squadron departed to Al Asad, Iraq in support of OIF 04-06. While in Iraq, the Black Knights conducted casevac, VIP transport, assault support operations and participated in Operation Matador. In late August 2005, the Black Knights returned to New River, only to be tapped for a detachment to assist in the Hurricane Katrina relief efforts. The squadron was deployed as the aviation combat element of the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit in the fall of 2008. Upon their return in April 2009, they were the last east coast squadron to transition to the MV-22 Osprey.Last NC CH-46 squadron soon to have Ospreys. Since achieving operational status under the MV-22 platform, VMM-264 has performed 2 deployments in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Their first deployment in December 2010 saw a milestone for the V-22 community as an aircraft piloted by the Black Knights on February 10, 2011 broke the 100,000-flight-hour mark for the platform as a whole. The squadron deployed again a second time in January 2013 . = Ebola Virus Disease Outbreak in West Africa = In response to the increased spread of the Ebola Virus Disease in West Africa, the United States began Operation United Assistance (OUA). The need for airlift assets was promptly recognized and in October 2014, a detachment of MV-22 deployed to Monrovia, Liberia, to fill the requirements for lift until other US military assets could arrive. Within 3 days of arriving in Monrovia, VMM-264 began flying operations to support the response to the viral outbreak. Over the following weeks, VMM-264 executed a wide variety of tasks ranging from moving VIPs, carrying medical training teams, assisting NGOs, and lifting medical supplies across Liberia. VMM-264 carried numerous different dignitaries including the US Ambassador to Liberia, The US Ambassador to the United Nations, the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of Liberia, and the President of Liberia.http://m.jdnews.com/news/military/area- marines-deploy-to-liberia-1.385032 VMM-264 disbanded June 24, 2020.

The call-letters came from a sequentially assigned list, and WNAX was the last station in the state to receive a callsign starting with a W instead of K (other than sister station WNAX-FM), as additional stations in the state were established after the January, 1923 shift that moved the K/W call letter boundary from the western border of South Dakota to the Mississippi River. WNAX was purchased by Gurney's Seed and Nursery Company in 1926 and became known as \\"WNAX‚ÄîVoice of the House of Gurney in Yankton\\". The station was used to promote Gurney products and services, making Gurney's a household name.Gurney Seed and Nursery Company, Victory Horticultural Library. In 1957, Cowles Broadcasting Corporation sold the station to Peoples Broadcasting Corporation, a subsidiary of Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., which, in turn, was an affiliate of the Ohio Farm Bureau Federation. Peoples Broadcasting was then the owner of KVTV- TV (now KCAU-TV). On February 10, 1933, the Federal Radio Commission authorized an increase in daytime power from 1,000 watts to 2,500 watts. Less than two years later, December 18, 1934, the new Federal Communications Commission authorized another increase in power, to 5,000 watts. The radio station launched the careers of many stars, both local and national. Starting in the late 1920s, Lawrence Welk spent a decade performing daily without pay on WNAX. In 1939, Wynn Hubler Speece started her radio program and became known regionally as \\"Your Neighbor Lady\\". Speece was still continuing to do her Marconi Award-winning broadcast more than sixty years later when WNAX celebrated its eightieth anniversary in 2002.

All of the station's historic live recordings as well as thousands of records were destroyed. The staff of WNAX went to the station's transmitter site and continued broadcasting. Eventually, the station recovered when a new building was constructed on Highway 50 in Yankton. In 1942 the station built a tower at Yankton at , which was the tallest radio broadcasting tower at the time. The current tower is tall. Today WNAX continues many of the traditions started in 1922 with frequent news, sports, weather and farm market updates.

Playing career Paul Dalglish with the 2006 MLS Cup trophy Dalglish, son of former Scotland international Kenny Dalglish, was born in Glasgow though spent his childhood in Liverpool where his father managed Liverpool As a child, he was the team mascot for Liverpool in their famous 1989 league title decider against Arsenal at Anfield. He started his career as a youth player with Celtic before joining Liverpool, but made no appearances for either of his father's former clubs. Dalglish was then signed by his father for Newcastle United, he made 14 appearances, scoring two goals against Tranmere Rovers in the League Cup and Sheffield Wednesday in the league. After a successful loan spell, he permanently joined Norwich City in 1999 for ¬£300,000, but failed to establish himself in three years at the club. Dalglish went on to have spells with Blackpool (scoring two goals against Luton Town in the league and Barnsley in the FA Cup) and Linfield and loan periods with Scunthorpe and Wigan Athletic. After this, Dalglish considered a media career, which resulted in finding himself a small part in the movie Goal and also an interview slot on Saturday-morning Sky Sports program Soccer AM, although this was short-lived due to the resurgence of his football career. After retiring from football for 2 years, Dalglish was given a lifeline when newly appointed Livingston manager Paul Lambert signed him and, despite struggling near the bottom of the Scottish Premier League, Dalglish impressed, scoring in a narrow 2‚Äì1 defeat to Celtic. Dalglish's performances attracted the attention of Hibernian manager Tony Mowbray, and despite having originally sought a contract extension with Livingston on the final day of the January 2006 transfer window, he joined the Edinburgh club for an undisclosed fee. His first goal for Hibs was a late winner against Kilmarnock in April, and his second and final goal for the club was against Odense in the UEFA Intertoto Cup. After being sidelined with injuries, Dalglish left Hibs in August 2006 to play for Major League Soccer side Houston Dynamo. On 5 November 2006, the Dynamo defeated the Colorado Rapids 3‚Äì1 in the Western Conference final to earn a spot in its first MLS Cup as the Houston Dynamo. Dalglish scored twice and was named Man of the Match. However, he struggled with injuries and was released by Dynamo in the 2007 post-season. He had talks with a few clubs in February 2008 including Scottish club Kilmarnock, with whom he signed a contract until the end of the season. His spell was plagued with injuries again and he retired at the end of the season. Coaching career Dalglish began his coaching career in 2008 as a coach at the Houston Dynamo Academy, simultaneously acting as a director at Space City Futbol Club. On 18 November 2009, Dalglish was named the head coach of FC Tampa Bay, an expansion team in the USSF Division 2 Professional League, the second level of the United States soccer league system. The club got off to a 5-1-3 start but won only 2 of their last 21 matches to fall into last place in the USL conference. Despite their dip in form, FC Tampa Bay were still the most successful expansion team in the 2010 season. Dalglish left the club by mutual consent on 23 September 2010, and team technical director Perry Van der Beck served as interim manager for the last two games of the season. In 2012, Dalglish became the manager of the Austin Aztex, an expansion club in the USL Premier Development League (USL PDL), the fourth level of the US soccer system. The club finished in the final 8 (of 73 teams) with a final record of 10-6-2 and advanced to the conference finals. The Aztex scored the most and conceded the fewest goals in their conference. In 2013, Dalglish led the Aztex to the best regular season record in the USL PDL (15-1-2) and won the league championship. The club again scored the most goals in their division and conceded the fewest. Dalglish was named the USL PDL coach of the year. He also served as the technical director for youth powerhouse, Lonestar Soccer Club, which has developed top young MLS prospects such as Kekuta Manneh and Khiry Shelton amongst others. In 2014, Dalglish joined the coaching staff of Major League Soccer club Real Salt Lake as assistant coach to Jeff Cassar. In August 2014, Dalglish returned to the Austin Aztex as head coach and technical director. The Aztex had a difficult first year in the United Soccer League when their House Park Stadium was flooded, leaving the team to find a new location to finish the season. This proved to be too much for the Austin Aztex and the team folded at the end of the season. In November 2015, Dalglish was hired as the head coach and general manager of the NASL club Ottawa Fury FC. On 14 August 2017, Dalglish left his role at Ottawa Fury, two days after a 3‚Äì1 victory over Charlotte Independence. According to the club's president John Pugh, Dalglish had recently informed him that he intended to leave the club for personal reasons at the end of the season. After \\"soul-searching by Pugh and the rest of Fury FC management\\", Dalglish and the club came to a mutual agreement to end his contract early. Dalglish was appointed as the 2nd Head Coach in Miami FC history, taking over from Alessandro Nesta on 25 January 2018. Dalglish led the team to 1st place in the Sunshine Conference Division, scoring the most goals and conceding the fewest, which led to him being named the Sunshine Conference Coach of the Year. Dalglish then followed that up by winning the South Region Conference and then the NPSL National Championship, beating FC Motown 3‚Äì1 in the final. In 2019, it was another clean sweep for Miami FC. Dalglish led the team to 1st place in the Sunshine Conference Division, scoring the most goals and conceding the fewest, the South Region Conference and then the NPSL National Championship, beating the New York Cosmos 3‚Äì1 in the final. He was appointed Miami's general manager on 13 November 2019 and was replaced as head coach with Nelson Vargas.\\"THE MIAMI FC APPOINTS PAUL DALGLISH AS GENERAL MANAGER\\" - The Miami FC, 13 November 2019 After three losses at the beginning of the USL Championship season, Vargas was let go and replaced by Dalglish as coach.

Dingler was known by Comedy Store patrons as a \\"Potlucker,\\" aka someone who performs during the club's open mike nights, which would routinely attract 40 comics vying for only 20 spots. For the Potluck show, aspiring performers drew a number from a weathered frozen strawberry bucket - those chosen got three minutes on stage. No qualifications were necessary. The Potluck was a rite of passage for many aspiring comedians - comics who successfully performed routinely at the potluck often graduated to paying jobs. Dingler, however, performed at the potluck for nearly 27 years, doing the same material, performance after performance. He eventually became bitter, and seemingly held grudges against many Comedy Store alumni (such as Jim Carrey, Andrew Dice Clay, Jay Leno, David Letterman and Eddie Griffin) who'd successfully risen through the ranks following the same path. Long-time patrons of the Comedy Store eventually began to treat Dingler as a cult symbol, and would often do his routine along with him, often calling out his punchlines before he could. In later years, the hosts of the pot-luck shows would save Dingler's appearance for the end of the evening, when more inebriated and exuberant audiences would play along with his disturbingly hilarious act. Dingler's personal history and appearance remained a mystery to many, leading to speculation that he was possibly a millionaire playboy, homeless or a Post-Traumatic Shock Syndrome riddled Vietnam veteran. In 2004, Dingler suddenly disappeared from The Comedy Store and the comedy scene, leading to speculation that he had either died in a gutter or been murdered, but according to an article http://www.blacktable.com/munson050511.htm written by up and coming comedian Todd Munson, Gaylord Dingler was a stage name for Jeffrey Allen Kaufman, who now lives somewhere in the Mid-West. An upcoming documentary titled 'The Machine Ripped His Leg Off : The Legend of Gaylord Dingler is currently being shot by English filmmaker Kjeld Gogosha-Clark of Los Angeles based Working Class Films and Munson.

Their home ballpark was Al Lopez Field, and they were a member of the Class A Florida State League (FSL) from 1955 until 1988, mostly as an affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds. In 1988, they were sold, relocated, and renamed the Sarasota White Sox. During their run in Tampa, they won three FSL league championships, in 1957, 1959 and 1961. For the 2018 season, the FSL Tampa Yankees revived the name when they were rebranded as the Tampa Tarpons. History Tampa has had a long history of minor league baseball, beginning in 1919, when the original Tampa Smokers began play as charter members of the Florida State League. The Smokers moved to the Florida International League before both the league and the team folded in 1954, temporarily leaving Tampa without a professional baseball team. The city built Al Lopez Field in 1954, and the Tampa Tarpons became the ballpark's first tenant when they began play there in 1955 as a new member of the Class D Florida State League. The Tarpons were an independent minor league team until 1957, when they became an affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies. In 1961, they began a long affiliation with the Cincinnati Reds. They won three league championships, in 1957, 1959 and 1961. In 1964 minor league baseball was realigned, and the Florida State League became a Class A league (now Class A-Advanced). During the 1980s talk spread of a major league team coming to the Tampa Bay Area, which would threaten the viability of the Tarpons and other minor league teams in the region. Prior to the 1988 season the Reds moved their spring training from Tampa to Plant City, Florida, and moved their Class A franchise to Greensboro, North Carolina (the Greensboro Hornets). The Chicago White Sox subsequently moved their Class A affiliation to Tampa for the 1988 season, amid rumors that the major league White Sox would be moving to the area soon thereafter. That season the club, renamed the Tampa White Sox, drew 55,900 fans, seventh in the 14-team FSL, and went 35‚Äì35 in the first half before they won the western division second-half title at 36‚Äì24. They fell in the second round of the playoffs to the St. Lucie Mets 2 games to 0. The club was managed by Marv Foley and had one FSL All- Star, pitcher Jerry Kutzler. Foley won FSL Manager of the Year honors.BR Bullpen: Tampa White Sox After the 1988 season, owner Mitchell Mick sold his franchise to the Chicago White Sox, who relocated the club to Sarasota, Florida as the Sarasota White Sox. The franchise exchanged major league affiliates and nicknames several times before 2010, when they became an affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates and were moved and renamed the Bradenton Marauders. Meanwhile, Tampa was without professional baseball until the Tampa Yankees re-joined the Florida State League in 1994. After the 2017 season, that team rebranded itself as the Tarpons. Notable Tarpon alumni Many former Tarpons went on to play in the major leagues, including important members of Cincinnati's Big Red Machine of the 1970s. In 1961 Pete Rose led the first place Tarpons with a .331 batting average and 30 triples ‚Äì still a FSL record. Other Reds players from that era who started with the Tarpons include Ken Griffey, Sr., Johnny Bench, Dan Driessen, Rawly Eastwick, and Dave Concepcion. When the Reds won their next world series in 1990 with manager (and Tampa native) Lou Piniella, they again had several former Tarpons on the roster, including Tom Browning, Rob Dibble, and Paul O'Neill. Another notable former Tarpon was outfielder Randy Poffo, who gave up on a short minor league baseball career at the age of 21 after batting .232 with the team in 1974. Poffo later become much more successful in professional wrestling, where he took on the stage name \\"Macho Man\\" Randy Savage. =Notable Tarpon players and coaches= * Johnny Bench (1965) 14 x MLB All-Star, 2 x NL MVP, Baseball Hall of Fame * Bill Bonham (1980) * Tom Browning (1983) MLB All-Star * Ben Chapman (1951, MGR) 4 x MLB All-Star * Dave Concepcion (1968) 9 x MLB All-Star * Doug Corbett (1975-1976) MLB All-Star * Rob Dibble (1984) 2 x MLB All-Star * Dan Driessen (1970-1971) * Rawly Eastwick (1970) 2 x NL Saves Leader * Doug Flynn (1972) * Tom Foley (1979) * Ken Griffey, Sr. (1971) 3 x MLB All-Star * Chris Hammond (1986) * Lenny Harris (1985) * Steve Henderson (1975) * Jay Howell (1977) 3 x MLB All-Star * Tom Hume (1972) MLB All-Star * Mike LaCoss (1975) MLB All-Star * Charlie Leibrandt (1978) * Hal McRae (1965) 3 x MLB All-Star * Lee May (1961-1962) 3 x MLB All-Star * Jeff Montgomery (1984) 3 x MLB All-Star * Paul O'Neill (1983) 5 x MLB All-Star; 1994 AL Batting Title * Ron Oester (1975) * Joe Oliver (1985) * Camilo Pascual (1952) 7 x MLB All-Star * Joe Price (1978) * Gary Redus (1980) * Pete Rose (1961) 17 x MLB All-Star; 1975 World Series Most Valuable Player; 3 x NL Batting Title (1968-1969, 1973); 1963 NL Rookie of the Year; 1973 NL Most Valuable Player * Jeff Russell (1981) 2 x MLB All-Star * Mario Soto (1976) 3 x MLB All-Star * Danny Tartabull (1981) MLB All-Star * Dave Tomlin (1968-1969) * Johnny Vander Meer (1961-1962, MGR) 4 x MLB All-Star * Milt Wilcox (1968-1969) * Jim Wynn (1962) 3 x MLB All-Star * Joel Youngblood (1970) MLB All-Star Tampa Bay Rays connections In 2006 the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, embarked on a rebranding effort that would include a name change; they considered adopting the Tampa Bay Tarpons name in honor of the minor league team before making the less radical step of shortening their nickname to simply the Rays in 2008.\\"Name Could Be Big Change\\" - St. Pete Times, Jan 15, 2006Rays usher in new era with new identity  MLB.com: News The (Devil)-Rays have worn Tampa Tarpons uniforms for several \\"Turn Back the Clock\\" games: *On July 17, 1999, the Devil Rays wore 1960 Tarpons uniforms against the New York Mets, who wore uniforms reminiscent of those worn by their 1969 championship team.\\"Lots of fun at the ballpark\\" - Ocala Star- Banner, July 20, 1999 *On June 24, 2006, the Devil Rays wore 1975 Tarpon uniforms against the Atlanta Braves, who wore their 1975 road uniforms.

It is one of several historically significant buildings in the city and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. This is where Martha Bulloch Roosevelt (\\"Mittie\\"), mother of Theodore Roosevelt, 26th U.S. President, lived as a child. It is also where she married Theodore Roosevelt's father, Theodore Roosevelt, Sr. The Roosevelt family are descendants of Archibald Bulloch, the first Governor of Georgia (1730-1777). The antebellum mansion was built by Mittie's father, Major James Stephens Bulloch. He was a prominent planter from the Georgia coast, who was invited to the new settlement by his friend Roswell King. After the death of his first wife Hester Amarintha \\"Hettie\\" Elliott - mother of his son James D. Bulloch - Bulloch married the widow of his first wife's father, Martha \\"Patsy\\" Stewart Elliot, and had four more children: * Anna Bulloch * Martha Bulloch * Charles Bulloch (who died young) * Irvine Bulloch. Major Bulloch selected a ten-acre plot of land and engaged a skilled builder, Willis Ball, to design and construct an elegant Greek Revival home. The Bulloch family lived in an abandoned Cherokee farmhouse while slaves and trained laborers built the house. In 1839, Major Bulloch and his family moved into the completed house. Soon Bulloch also owned land for cotton production and held enslaved African-Americans to work his fields. According to the 1850 Slave Schedules , Martha Stewart Elliott Bulloch, by then widowed a second time, owned 31 enslaved African-Americans. They mostly labored on cotton and crop production; but some would have worked in the home, on cooking and domestic tasks to support the family. Some of the known slaves who worked in the house were \\"Maum\\" Rose (cook), \\"Maum\\" Charlotte (housekeeper), \\"Maum\\" Grace (nursemaid), \\"Daddy\\" William, \\"Daddy\\" Luke, and Henry. Birth and marriage of Martha Bulloch Fireplace mantle in the dining room, where Mittie and her husband, Theodore Roosevelt, Sr. (known as Thee), were married in front of the pocket doors on December 22, 1853 In 1835 while living in Hartford, Connecticut, James' wife gave birth to a daughter, also named Martha. She was known affectionately as Mittie. Mittie was raised at Bulloch Hall. Though the date of their initial meeting is unclear, we do know that when Theodore Roosevelt, Sr. was 19, he came to Roswell, Georgia with his friend Hilborne West, who was to marry Mittie's oldest half sister, Susan Elliott. Mittie was 15 at the time. \\"Thee,\\" as he was called, met Mittie again when she went to Philadelphia in January 1853 to stay with her sister Susan. They fell in love and began planning their wedding through letters between Mittie in Roswell and Thee in New York. They were married in the dining room of Bulloch Hall on December 22, 1853. The marriage was a gala affair with people coming for many miles and staying for a week. Mittie's friend and bridesmaid, Mrs. William Baker, left a recollection of the wedding in an interview by Margaret \\"Peggy\\" Mitchell of Gone with the Wind fame, in the Atlanta Journal, June 10, 1923. After the marriage, the couple moved to New York City. The couple lived with Thee's parents while a house, a wedding gift from them, was constructed at 28 E 20th Street. In 1856, Martha, Anna, and Irvine moved to Philadelphia to live with Martha's daughter Susan West. Anna and Martha later moved in with Mittie and Thee in New York. The Roosevelt couple became the parents of Anna; Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th President of the United States; Elliott, and Corinne. Later Elliott married Anna Rebecca Hall, and his daughter was First Lady of the United States, Eleanor Roosevelt. President Roosevelt's visit in 1905 Theodore Roosevelt visiting Bulloch Hall north of Atlanta, Georgia in 1905 Theodore Roosevelt, who had begun his presidency on reasonably good terms for a half-northerner president, had infuriated the South by inviting Booker T. Washington to dine in the White House. Consequently, he waited a few years until the episode blew over and finally visited Bulloch Hall for the first time while touring the South in 1905. He was thought to be the first sitting President of the United States to visit the South since the end of the American Civil War, however this is incorrect as William McKinley had visited the South earlier while celebrating the victory of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. President Roosevelt and his wife Edith arrived in Roswell, Georgia on October 20, 1905. At Bulloch Hall, he spoke as follows: Eleanor Roosevelt visited Roswell and Bulloch Hall several times. Her husband Franklin Roosevelt visited the house, but did not leave his car.

Written by series creator Rob Thomas and directed by John Kretchmer, the episode premiered on UPN on September 28, 2005. The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a high school student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, Veronica reveals the events that transpired over the summer after the resolution of the murder of Lilly Kane (Amanda Seyfried). Meanwhile, Veronica investigates a scam involving students' forged drug tests, and a school bus mysteriously goes off a cliff. \\"Normal Is the Watchword\\" featured several casting changes to the show, including the introduction of Kendall (Charisma Carpenter) and Gia (Krysten Ritter), as well as the promotion of three actors to series regular status. The episode received mostly positive reviews, and Thomas was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award for his writing.  Synopsis  One day before senior year, Veronica is working a job at a restaurant. Soon, a boy named Kelvin (Charles Duckworth) comes into the restaurant and says that he failed his drug test, even though he has been clean for ten months. Veronica sees an interview with her father, Keith (Enrico Colantoni), on TV, and it is revealed that he wrote a book about the Lilly Kane case. The episode then flashes back to the romantic cliffhanger at the end of season one, and it is revealed that Logan was at the door. Logan reveals that the biker gang beat him up after he kicked Weevil (Francis Capra) in the face. Although he woke up with a knife and found one of the gang members was stabbed, Logan tells Veronica that he did not stab the gang member, and Veronica believes him. However, Leo (Max Greenfield) comes and arrests Logan. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) says that he and Meg (Alona Tal) also failed their drug test. Wallace informs Veronica about the details of the drug test, and the episode flashes back to show the details of Veronica and Logan starting to date over the summer. Veronica talks to all the students who were framed in the drug test, and they all say some people might want to harm them. Veronica has become estranged from Meg, and Veronica reveals that Logan was released from prison soon after he was arrested. Veronica connects the five people who were framed to an incident where a student was publicly harassed in gym class. Keith is still dating Alicia Fennel (Erica Gimpel). Veronica and Wallace spend the night investigating students, and Veronica eventually deduces that Wallace ingested a small amount of an illegal substance, most likely in a gift basket earlier that year. In a flashback, Veronica and Logan make out in the car until the PCH bikers shoot out the car's windows. Veronica conducts a drug test on Wallace and finds that he's clean, which rules out the possibility that his food was spiked. Veronica asks Keith for help in finding out the names of a company's shareholders, and discovers that the parents of the second-string athletes who have been promoted to starting positions as a result of the failed drug tests are all shareholders in the trading company. Veronica believes that one of the lab assistants was paid off to forge the results. The previous summer, Logan was involved with an arson crime. Logan sunbathes with Dick (Ryan Hansen) and Beaver (Kyle Gallner) poolside, and they ogle at the brothers' stepmother, Kendall Casablancas (Charisma Carpenter). Veronica sets up the parents and has Principal Clemmons listen in, and it is revealed that Duncan is now dating Veronica. In a flashback, Veronica breaks up with Logan. When Logan starts to get angry, Keith barges in and makes him leave. Logan is carrying on a relationship with Kendall. On a field trip, Veronica meets Gia (Krysten Ritter). Dick arranges a limo ride home for the O-niners, but Veronica and Meg decline and take the school bus. During the ride home, Veronica talks to Meg one more time, but she is still passive- aggressive. Veronica explains to the audience that she and Duncan are dating. At a rest stop, Veronica sees Weevil and they debate about the stabbed gang member. Meanwhile, Veronica's bus drives away without her. Instead, Weevil takes Veronica on his motorcycle before they run across the limo with Duncan, Gia, and the other O-niners in it. They tell Veronica that the field trip bus full of students drove off the cliff and into the sea, and they look over at the crashed bus.  Production  When it was renewed for a second season, Veronica Mars became the lowest-rated show in network history to be renewed and the only UPN drama from the 2004-05 television season to be renewed. Starting in the second season, Veronica Mars was moved to Wednesday nights, placing it in direct competition with ABC's popular Lost. Rob Thomas said that, \\"I wish the juggernaut that is Lost wasn't our direct competition.\\" At the same time, Veronica Mars was placed after UPN's America's Next Top Model. On the date of the airing of this episode, Bell and Thomas talked to The New York Times, where Thomas commented, \\"We let Veronica say things that, if you get all day to think about it, would be the perfect retort.\\" The episode was originally titled \\"Urine Trouble\\", a joking pun on \\"You're in trouble.\\" The episode's title refers to a phrase said by both Veronica and Wallace, indicating that things are supposedly \\"normal,\\" though they are not. The episode was written by series creator Rob Thomas and directed by John T. Kretchmer. This episode marks Thomas's fourth writing credit for the series (after \\"Pilot\\", \\"Credit Where Credit's Due\\", and \\"Leave It to Beaver\\") and Kretchmer's fourth directing credit for the series. In the episode, Logan mentions that producers wanted Tara Reid to play Trina Echolls (Alyson Hannigan) in casting for the film adaptation of the Echolls' story. During casting of the role of Trina, Reid was actually almost cast in the part. In the episode, Logan makes an obscene hand gesture known as the shocker, something that the UPN censors did not notice. Before the filming of \\"Normal Is the Watchword\\", Rob Thomas informed actor Teddy Dunn, who played Duncan Kane, that he was planning to remove the character from the show. Dunn has said that he was not too upset by the news, as he almost did not return for the season at all. On his role in the season, Dunn stated, \\"And so I knew going in that I had a finite amount of episodes, so it was like any other job. It was week-to-week and then I went on my merry way.\\" The episode features a brief cameo by Julie Chen, wife of UPN executive Leslie Moonves. The cast members did not know important plot information before they received the script for the episode, including who was at Veronica's door and that Veronica and Duncan would resume dating. \\"Ashes\\" by Embrace plays during the bus crash scene. = Casting = \\"Normal Is the Watchword\\" introduces several new characters and series regulars to the show. On casting the new season, Thomas explained that he \\"conceive[d] the show as a one-year mystery\\" and decided that he needed to introduce and eliminate several characters to be able to create an \\"equally fascinating mystery\\" for the series' second season. Thomas felt that he could not bring back the Kanes and the Echolls and \\"have them all involved in a new mystery\\"; he needed \\"new blood\\". In the opening credits, three new actors are given star billing. Two of these actors, Ryan Hansen as Dick Casablancas and Kyle Gallner as Cassidy \\"Beaver\\" Casablancas, served as recurring characters in the show's first season. In addition, this episode marks the first credit of Jackie Cook, played by Tessa Thompson, despite the fact that she does not appear in the episode. Several important recurring characters of the show's second season are also introduced in \\"Normal Is the Watchword.\\" Kendall Casablancas, portrayed by Charisma Carpenter, best known for her role as Cordelia Chase on Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel makes her first appearance in the episode. During casting, Heather Graham was considered for the role. However, Graham was filming Emily's Reasons Why Not. Carpenter said that she wanted to play the role because \\"the name is really spectacular.\\" The episode also introduces the character of Gia Goodman, played by Krysten Ritter, who would later become known for her roles in Breaking Bad, Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23, and Jessica Jones. Ritter would reprise her role in the film continuation of Veronica Mars and called her role on the series \\"her first big acting job.\\" Ritter was a fan of Veronica Mars before her role on the show, and she unsuccessfully auditioned for a guest role in the first season. However, the producers enjoyed Ritter's performance, so they told her that she \\"would be on the show at some point.\\"  Reception  Series creator Rob Thomas wrote the episode and received a Writers Guild of America Award nomination for his work. = Ratings = In its original broadcast, \\"Normal Is the Watchword\\" garnered 3.29 million viewers and ranked 97th out of 112 in the weekly rankings. This was an increase over both the previous season's finale, \\"Leave It to Beaver\\", which received 2.99 million viewers, and the previous season premiere (the pilot episode), which garnered 2.49 million viewers. At the time, the episode was the highest-rated episode of Veronica Mars in the show's history. However, this ratings high would be surpassed by \\"One Angry Veronica\\". = Reviews = The episode received positive reviews. Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, gave a glowing review, saying that it had all the components that a season premiere should have. After praising many aspects of the episode, the reviewer wrote, \\"What ties it all together, though, is a storytelling form that indicates complete confidence from the show about what its viewers can deal with. It's half present-day, half-flashback. But the two different halves, combined with Veronica's voiceover, combine to present the information in pleasantly deceptive fashion.\\" Price Peterson of TV.com also gave a positive review, writing in his episode verdict that \\"It's frankly amazing how much information this episode packed into 42 minutes while still feeling breezy and funny‚Ä¶The episode also ended with that breathtakingly horrifying ending, a multiple- death shocker that served to remind me just how murder-lite Season 1 was.\\" Television Without Pity gave the episode a \\"B+\\". Alan Sepinwall wrote that the season premiere was \\"a little heavy on the exposition\\" while also commenting that the same could be said about the pilot episode. Sepinwall went on to state, \\"I'm really enjoying all the new storylines and characters.\\" Cynthia Fuchs of PopMatters, gave a positive review, noting the various new storylines and how the characters, especially Veronica, handled this new set of events. \\"Like most adolescents, Veronica understands and anticipates this mix, even if she doesn't always deal with it in the most effective way. Even if you don't want to pick sides, you're bound to be assessed as having done so. And once you're labeled‚Äî09er or not‚Äîyou can either spend your time fighting rumors or finding alternative measures. Veronica, so precociously and brilliantly aware of alternatives, makes this familiar process seem worth pondering one more time.\\" BuzzFeed ranked the episode 23rd on its ranking of Veronica Mars episodes, writing \\"take a close look at this episode; all the answers are right there.\\" On a similar list, TVLine ranked the episode 18th, writing that it was notable for its introduction of characters and the bus crash plot line. = Accolades = For his work on the episode, Rob Thomas received a Writers Guild of America Award nomination for Best Episodic Drama. However, Thomas lost at the Writers Guild of America Awards 2005 to Lawrence Kaplow for the House episode \\"Autopsy\\".

It was co-produced by Michael Rother, their bandmate in side-project Harmonia. The music on Zuckerzeit marks a shift from Cluster's abrasive early work toward a more rhythmic, pop- oriented sound. Pitchfork ranked the album number 63 on its list of the top 100 albums of the 1970s, while writer and musician Julian Cope included Zuckerzeit in his \\"Krautrock Top 50\\" list. Background Zuckerzeit was recorded following Cluster's move from West Berlin to the countryside of Forst, and came after their collaboration with Neu! guitarist Michael Rother on the 1973 Harmonia album Musik von Harmonia. The album's short instrumental tracks marked the group's shift toward a pop-oriented style which utilized cheap drum machines and synthesizers. Each track is a solo composition, with the two members recording separately on different days; The Quietus noted that \\"it is in reality two solo EPs masquerading as a joint release.\\" Rother is credited as co-producer, but his primary role was to leave the group some of his equipment, including Farfisa instruments, a four-track recorder, a stereo mixer, and an Elka Drummer One drum machine. With the latter, the group experimented with mixing up multiple preset rhythms at once, as well as running the drum machine through echo, vibrato, and wah pedals, and cutting parts of the rhythm entirely. Reception John Bush of AllMusic described Zuckerzeit as \\"an unexpected jump from the extended kosmische jams of Cluster 71 into uncharted territory [...] fusing the duo's haunted melodic sense with crisp, scratchy drum programs.\\" Andy Beta of Pitchfork described it as \\"electronic pop at its most protean,\\" and compared it to \\"a sugar overload: giddy, infectious, manic and a little queasy.\\" Peter Cauvel of Vinyl Me, Please stated that \\"even with drum machines and synths, Cluster pushed past the rigidity that defined their more successful peers in Kraftwerk, making spacier, improvisational electronic music.\\" =Legacy= In a review of Cluster's 1971‚Äì1981 box set, AllMusic's Paul Simpson called the album a \\"masterpiece [that] combined trippy drum machine rhythms with woozy, pastoral melodies, resulting in a skewed, playful vision of futuristic pop. The recording remains a watershed moment in electronic music, and is easily one of the best albums of the '70s.\\" Writer Ulrich Adelt stated that the album's \\"influence on electronic music was significant, and many more contemporary groups have copied [its] lo-fi sound.\\" Pitchfork ranked the album at number 63 on its list of the top 100 albums of the 1970s. Among its fans are Brian Eno and Julian Cope, with Cope including Zuckerzeit in his \\"Krautrock Top 50\\" list.

The song was originally intended to be a part of a rock opera called 'Quads' which was to be set in the future where parents can choose the sex of their children. The idea was later scrapped, but this song survived and was later released as a single. The song is about a family who \\"order\\" four girls, but a mistake is made and three girls and one boy are delivered instead. The boy dreams of partaking in sports and other boy-type activities, but his mother forces him to act like his sisters and refuses to believe the truth (\\"I'm a boy, I'm a boy, but my Ma won't admit it\\"). The track was produced by Kit Lambert at IBC Studios around 31 July - 1 August 1966 and released just over three weeks later on 26 August 1966 with \\"In the City\\" as the B-side. The single was successful in the British Isles, reaching number 2 in the UK Singles Chart and Number 7 in Ireland. It failed to repeat that success in the US. The original recording (released as a single) which features John Entwistle's French horn arrangement prominently in the mix is available on the album Who's Missing. The version included on most compilations, between the original 1966 release and The Who Hits 50!, is exactly the same recording, with French horns removed. A different, slower version was recorded in London in the week of 3 October 1966 and was intended for an early version of A Quick One titled Jigsaw Puzzle but was later released on Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy in 1971. Another similar version was released on a bonus disc of The Ultimate Collection in 2002 and is unique to that album. The song was performed at The Who's legendary concert at Leeds, released in album format as Live at Leeds. On the Live at Leeds album, Pete Townshend comments on the song by saying: References Category:The Who songs Category:1966 singles Category:Songs written by Pete Townshend Category:Song recordings produced by Kit Lambert Category:Decca Records singles Category:Reaction Records singles Category:1966 songs ","title":"I'm a Boy"},{"id":"3928068","text":"\\"The Reploids\\" is a horror short story by American writer Stephen King. It was published in the 1988 book Dark Visions. Plot summary A mysterious man named Edward Paladin shows up in place of Johnny Carson on The Tonight Show, but all is not what it seems. A subsequent investigation by detectives Richard Cheyney and Pete Jacoby finds strange items in his possession, hinting that he may not be from our reality. These include passes for the studio which are the wrong color and a bright blue one dollar bill with a picture of James Madison on it rather than one of George Washington, implying that Madison served as the first President of the United States instead of Washington in Paladin's universe. Relationship with other works Aberrant United States currency ‚Äî changes in color and presidents ‚Äî is also described by Father Callahan in the chapter \\"The Priest's Tale Continued (Highways in Hiding)\\" from The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla (DT5). In DT5, such differing bills are explained as originating from different co-existing universes within the Dark Tower multiverse. President Chadbourne is mentioned in both the short story and the novel.

They recorded their first single for Red Rhino, \\"The Night\\", shortly after losing their original drummer Crane, who was replaced by Howard Daniels. Daniels soon left, joining My Pierrot Dolls, and was replaced by Martin Henderson (formerly of The Last Laugh). Skeletal Family's first album, Burning Oil, recorded in four days at a cost of ¬£640, was released by Red Rhino in August 1984. It topped the UK Independent Chart, staying in the top 10 until the end of the year.Lazell, Barry (1998) Indie Hits 1980‚Äì1989, Cherry Red Books, , p. 207 The band began touring with the Sisters of Mercy during the Sisters' First and Last and Always tour. Skeletal Family released the Futile Combat album in 1985, along with the \\"Promised Land\\" single. Hurst and Henderson left the band to develop new projects. Hurst eventually teamed up with Gary Marx in Ghost Dance. Henderson joined former March Violets vocalist Simon Denbigh to create the Batfish Boys. Former Colourfield backing vocalist Katrina Phillips replaced Hurst, while Kevin Hunter replaced Henderson. John Clarke joined as a second guitarist. The group signed with Chrysalis Records and released two 1986 singles, \\"Restless\\" and \\"Just a Minute\\". The group disbanded later in the year after being dropped by Chrysalis. Trotwood and Hunter formed a new band, Say You. In 2002, Skeletal Family reformed with a line-up of Greenwood, Nowell, Taylor and Hurst. The latter had to drop out due to family commitments, replaced briefly by Phillips, and then by new vocalist Claire Bannister. They played several high profile shows, including Wave-Gotik-Treffen three times as well as the Drop Dead Festival in New York City. This line-up released an album, Sakura, in May 2005 on Gepek Records. Skeletal Family's next album, Songs of Love, Hope and Despair, featuring new bassist Johnny Lorrimer, was released by Gepek in September 2009.

He earned his fortune with insurance, banking and cement industries which were nationalized after the Carnation Revolution of 1974. After living in exile in Brazil for seven years, he returned to Portugal and rebuilt his companies. Biography Born in 1918, the eldest child and son of Carlos Montez Champalimaud (Peso da R√©gua, Godim, 13 November 1877 - Cascais, 4 May 1937), a Military Doctor, Lord of the ancestral home of Quinta do Cotto in the Douro region http://www.quintadocotto.pt/en/quinta.php (great- great-grandson in female line of French Paul Joseph Champalimaud, seigneur de Nussane, who came to Portugal and here married Clara Maria de Sousa Lira e Castro), and wife (m.

(great-granddaughter in male line of German Franz Joseph Freiherr von Sommer and wife Klara Werlein von Ascheberg, who came to Portugal during the Liberal Wars).http://www.geneall.net/P/per_page.php?id=19743 Ant√≥nio Champalimaud in a Portuguese Genealogical site He attended the La Guardia Jesuit High School before enrolling at the Faculdade de Ci√™ncias da Universidade de Lisboa to study Chemistry. Ant√≥nio never finished his college education, for at 19, after his father's death, he took over the family's construction company. Later, at the age of 28 he took over his uncle's (Henrique de Ara√∫jo de Sommer, one of Portugal most important industrialists, who had died without issue, as did two of his brothers, two of his sisters and his niece) cement business. In Cascais, Estoril, at the Igreja de Santo Ant√≥nio, on 16 December 1941 he married Dona Maria Cristina da Silva Jos√© de Mello (Lapa, Lisbon, 6 March 1920 - Lisbon, Prazeres, 25 August 2006), daughter of the major industrialist Dom Manuel Augusto Jos√© de Mello (of the Counts do Cartaxo, Counts and Marquesses of Sabugosa, Counts of S√£o Louren√ßo and Alferes-Majors of the Realm), and Am√©lia de Resende Dias de Oliveira da Silva. They had seven children together. Maria Cristina was an heir to the Grupo CUF, a company that was a conglomerate with interests in chemical, textiles, banking, insurances, shipbuilding and repairing, shipping and tobacco industries. They were divorced by 1957, after which he started competing with his ex-brother-in-law in the banking and insurance markets. His ex-wife married secondly in Lisbon, S√£o Mamede, on 29 March 1980 Amaro de Azevedo Gomes (Cascais, S√£o Domingos de Rana, 22 June 1917 - Lisbon, S√£o Mamede, 1 January 2008), without issue. He bequeathed 500 million euros to establish the Champalimaud Foundation in order to support biomedicine. The foundation also administers a yearly 1 million euro prize for outstanding research related to vision, an appropriate prize, as late in life Ant√≥nio lost his eyesight. Business Champalimaud expanded the cement business he took over from his uncle Henrique de Sommer in 1946 and expanded it in Portugal to the point of a near monopoly. He also expanded his cement industry into Africa, to the Portuguese overseas territories of Angola and Mozambique. In the early 1960s, he bought the Banco Pinto & Sotto Mayor (BPSM) and the insurance companies Confian√ßa, Mundial and Continental Resseguros. In 1969 he fled to Mexico to avoid an arrest warrant related to an inheritance case over shares of the Empresa de Cimentos de Leiria, his uncle's old company. The warrant was revoked in 1973, after which Champalimaud returned to Portugal. In 1975, a year after the Carnation Revolution, his companies were nationalized by the new government. Champalimaud first fled to France and ultimately to Brazil. Without his fortune, he restarted building his wealth, first establishing a cement company in Brazil, and later by also operating commercial farms. In 1992, Champalimaud returned to Portugal and started to buy back his old companies. In a series of transactions, Champalimaud sold the Champalimaud Group to the Banco Santander Central Hispano, BSCH, Spain's largest bank .

One part of the program aims to develop a reusable, rapid-strike Hypersonic Weapon System (HWS), now retitled the Hypersonic Cruise Vehicle (HCV), and the other is for the development of a launch system capable of accelerating an HCV to cruise speeds, as well as launching small satellites into Earth orbit.

The memo of understanding between DARPA and the USAF on Blackswift‚Äîalso known as the HTV-3X‚Äîwas signed in September 2007. The Blackswift HTV-3X did not receive needed funding and was canceled in October 2008.

Design and development =Past projects= The aim was always to be able to deploy a craft from the continental United States, which could reach anywhere on the planet within one to two hours. The X-20 Dyna-Soar in 1957 was the first publicly acknowledged program‚Äîalthough this would have been launched vertically on a rocket and then glided back to Earth, as the Space Shuttle did, rather than taking off from a runway. Originally, the Shuttle was envisaged as a part-USAF operation, and separate military launch facilities were built at Vandenberg AFB at great cost, though never used. After the open DynaSoar USAF program from 1957 to 1963, spaceplanes went black (became highly classified). In the mid-1960s, the CIA began work on a high-Mach spyplane called Project Isinglass. This developed into Rheinberry, a design for a Mach-17 air-launched reconnaissance aircraft, which was later canceled.Isinglass . astronautix.com According to Henry F. Cooper, who was the Director of the Strategic Defense Initiative (\\"Star Wars\\") under President Reagan, spaceplane projects consumed $4 billion of funding in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s (excluding the Space Shuttle). This does not include the 1950 and 1960s budgets for the Dynasoar, ISINGLASS, Rheinberry, and any 21st-century spaceplane project which might emerge under Falcon. He told the United States Congress in 2001 that all the United States had in return for those billions of dollars was \\"one crashed vehicle, a hangar queen, some drop-test articles and static displays\\".Cooper Testimony . tgv-rockets.com Falcon was allocated US$170 million for budget year 2008.Space Weapons Spending in the FY 2008 Defense Budget . cdi.org HyperSoar The HyperSoar was an American hypersonic aircraft project developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). It was to be capable of flying at around Mach 12 (9,200 mph, 14,700 km/h), allowing it to transit between any two points on the globe in under two hours. The HyperSoar was predicted to be a passenger plane capable of skipping outside the atmosphere to prevent it from burning up in the atmosphere. A trip from Chicago to Tokyo (10,123 kilometers) would take 18 skips, or 72 minutes. It was planned to use hydrocarbon-based engines outside the atmosphere and experimental jet engine technology with testing to begin by 2010. Later, the Hypersoar concept was acquired from LLNL by DARPA, and in 2002 it was combined with the USAF X-41 Common Aero Vehicle to form the FALCON program. =FALCON= The overall FALCON (Force Application and Launch from CONtinental United States) program announced in 2003 had two major components: a small launch vehicle for carrying payloads to orbit or launching the hypersonic weapons platform payload, and the hypersonic vehicle itself.

The tests provided data on flight aerodynamics and high-temperature effects on the aeroshell. Work on the HTV-2 would continue to summer 2014 to provide more study on hypersonic flight. The HTV-2 was the last active part of the Falcon program.

His Play-A-Long series of instructional books and CDs, using the chord-scale system, the first of which was released in 1967, are an internationally renowned resource for jazz education. His summer workshops have educated students of all ages since the 1960s. Career Aebersold was born in New Albany, Indiana. When he was fifteen, he played with local bands, then attended Indiana University in Bloomington while leading bands in southern Indiana and Kentucky. During the late 1960s, he taught at Indiana University Southeast and in the 1970s and 1990s at the University of Louisville. He began weeklong summer workshops for students which have spread throughout the world into countries such as Canada, England, Scotland, Germany, Denmark, and Australia. Aebersold plays saxophone, piano, banjo, and double bass. Play-A-Long series Most of the volumes in Aebersold's Play-A-Long series feature a selection of ten to twelve jazz standards, though some focus on scales, standardized chord progressions (like the blues), or original compositions by Aebersold's collaborators. The books contain charts for the tunes in question, transposed as necessary for instruments in C (treble and bass clef), as well as transpositions for B-flat and E-flat instruments. The recordings feature a professional rhythm section (typically piano, bass, and drums, occasionally including guitar) performing an improvised accompaniment (comping) to each song. Melody instruments like saxophone and trumpet are omitted, enabling a jazz student to practice the song's melody and improvise over the chord changes with accompaniment. Piano and bass tracks are panned to opposite channels so that a pianist or bassist can easily omit the recorded piano or bass part by muting the appropriate channel. Perhaps the most well-known feature of the \\"Play-A-Long\\" series is Aebersold's voice, which counts off the tempo for each track on most Aebersold recordings. Workshops For over 50 years, Aebersold has also run summer jazz workshops, historically throughout the US and internationally, and in recent years at the University of Louisville. The week-long event is billed as a place to learn jazz through hands-on experience through an intensive learning environment for musicians of varying ages and levels. The standard curriculum includes master classes, ear-training sessions, jazz theory classes from beginning to advanced, and concerts by faculty. Aebersold regularly performs and presents clinics at the jazz festival at Murray State University in Murray, Kentucky. The festival was renamed the Jamey Aebersold Jazz Festival in 2015 to honor his many years of service to the jazz program at that institution.

Private life  He was the son of native-born parents Michael Henry Cronin, farmer, and his wife Nellie Agatha, n√©e Dawson. Although of Methodist background, Mick completed his primary education at a convent-run boarding-school at Toodyay, then worked as a delivery-boy and as an apprentice to a butcher at Harvey. In 1931 he was recruited by East Perth Football Club which found him a job with a grocer in Perth. Cronin was later employed at Whitty's lottery agency and at Boans Ltd department store. In the 1930s he was also a middle-order batsman with the Subiaco Cricket Club. On 6 April 1940 Cronin married stenographer Roma Chipper at St Andrew's Presbyterian Church, Perth. That year he opened a confectionery shop at the Hurlingham Picture Theatre, South Perth. Mobilized in the Citizen Military Forces in January 1942, he served at home in the Australian Imperial Force for the duration of the war, engaged mostly in anti-aircraft activities. He was discharged with the rank of sergeant in October 1945, after which he ran snack shops in central Perth. He was a successful agent for the Scottish Amicable Insurance Co. in 1966‚Äì79. A man of natural wit and bubbly charm, sincere, honest and forthright in his manner, Cronin was popular in sporting circles and esteemed for his community work. He was a Freemason, and a lifelong non-smoker and teetotaller; he enjoyed punting on the horses and liked a game of golf. Cronin died suddenly of a ruptured aortic aneurysm on 1 September 1979 at Royal Perth Hospital and was cremated; his wife and son survived him.  Playing career  He played 164 games for East Perth from 1930‚Äì41 winning the club's fairest and best award in 1931. In 1936 Cronin was made Captain ‚Äì a role he would hold until the end of the 1940 season. A forceful, energetically dynamic performer, Cronin was just as much at home on the half forward line as in the centre, and it was as a half forward flanker that he represented the Royals in their winning grand final team of 1936. Cronin earned his first Western Australia cap against South Australia in 1933 after being selected as part of the squad for the Sydney Carnival and went on to play 12 games for his state. He was then at the peak of his form during the 1937 interstate football carnival in Perth when he put in two near best on ground performances in helping Western Australia to annihilate South Australia by 19 goals, and get to within 8 points of an all powerful 'Big V' combination. His performance earned him the inaugural Tassie Medal. In 1939, he took over as coach of the club from Jerry Dolan, steering his side to the finals. Herb Screaigh took over in 1940, but Cronin was again coaching in 1941 after a series of bad leg injuries limited his playing appearances, and adversely affected his form when he was able to front up. He was made a life member of the club in 1941.  Post-playing  After his playing career he became a league umpire and he umpired the entire 1947 WANFL finals series (in those days there was only one field umpire during a game). It was also 1947 that saw him venture to Hobart to umpire in the first post-war Australian interstate championship series. Well known for his didactic style, he taught football to juniors in Perth colleges and the South Perth district. Cronin again coached East Perth from 1951 to 1955 ‚Äì with his best successes coming in 1952 and 1953 when East Perth made it to the 1st semi final but lost. He also coached the state in 1951. His coaching may not have reaped much for the Royals, in fact his final stint came at the end of a prolonged era of frustration for the club. However under Cronin the calibre of such players as Ted Kilmurray, Paul Seal, Kevin McGill, John Watts, Ray Webster and most notable of all Graham 'Polly' Farmer joined the club. From this one would suggest that he helped lay the foundations for the East Perth golden era that would begin when Jack Sheedy took over in 1956. Benefiting from a football boom in Perth, Cronin became a dominant figure on TVW-7's weekly 'World of Football' television programme from 1965 until his death; he earned respect for his sincerity and knowledge, but aroused controversy by his frankness and dogmatism. Meanwhile, he also broadcast football matches over radio 6IX and contributed through a ghost writer to a weekly column, 'On the Back Page', in Sports Review.  Other  The West Australian Football Commission now presents the 'Mick Cronin Best Feature Story or Program' award to the best author/producer/presenter of a television feature story, documentary or program based on the WAFL or the AFL. He was inducted into the West Australian Football Hall of Fame in March 2006.

Productions began in the 1920s with Edmond Rostand's The Romancers (1926) being the final production directed by Winifred Bostwick, a long-time teacher at the school. Other shows helmed by Bostwick had included The Exchange (1922), The Man Who Married a Dumb Wife (1923) and The Knave of Hearts in 1925. Harold Butterworth was a longtime director for the club (1936‚Äì1956). Under his direction, the drama club boasted its largest membership (137 registered members in 1945), became The Troupers in 1951 and continued to present contemporary dramas. Then, after Butterworth's tenure, The Troupers presented their first \\"classic\\" play: Thornton Wilder's Our Town, also the last play performed at the then-VHS building that is now H. B. Whitehorne Middle School. A series of directors took the Troupers into Fairview Avenue's newly constructed Verona High School, where they performed such classics as The Man Who Came to Dinner (1958), You Can't Take It with You (1960), and Arsenic and Old Lace (1962). Sometime in this era, the title Troupers disappeared in favor of the more generic Drama Club. In the early 1970s, classic productions dominated: Harvey (1972, directed by Ruth Garoni), a new production of Arsenic and Old Lace (1973 and presented again in 1993) and the first production of a true Broadway musical ‚Äì Oliver!, combining the students of the high school and middle school under the music direction of long-time Verona band teacher, Harry Owens. Director Jim Walsh continued dramatic shows on alternate years with Scapino, Count Dracula, and The Good Doctor. In the early 80s, Maurice J. Moran began his 27-year tenure as drama advisor and introduced both a non-musical and musical in the same school year. The Importance of Being Earnest, Mame (1982), Grease (1984), The Fantasticks (1985), Godspell (1986), The Odd Couple, \\"Story Theater\\" and The Crucible are some examples of shows done in the 80s. In 1991, the VHS Drama Club became The Spotlight Players. In 1996, VHS joined 100 other New Jersey high schools participating in the Paper Mill Playhouse's Rising Star Awards, winning a \\"best actress\\" nomination in its first year with a repeat production of Anything Goes. New plays and classic musicals (and Star nominations) continued as the 90s closed: All in the Timing, The Canterbury Tales, and Senior Square contrasting with Gypsy, The Music Man, and Pippin. The 21st century began with what was apparently only the second VHS Shakespeare presentation thus far: A Midsummer Night's Dream. In that same year, parent volunteers organized themselves to help the performing arts as The Spotlight Players Parents Association. To raise funds for the theater program, the parents' group began the annual Verona Talent Night, which continues to give an opportunity for Verona students, adults, and friends to sing, dance, play musical instruments, or tell jokes without the need for competition. In 2002, for the first time, a completely student-produced musical was presented, Bat Boy: The Musical. The show was presented by the then-recently established local chapter of the International Thespian Society, and featured a student cast, with a student director, music director, band, and choreographer. Other productions have included Godspell, You're A Good Man, Charlie Brown, and the 2006 presentation of Musical of Musicals, being featured in The Star-Ledger's \\"Young and Talented\\" column. Another major change was the hiring of an outside director. After 30 years directing school musicals around North Jersey, Moran decided to give up that role and serve instead as a producer of the musicals. He continued to direct the non-musicals (Moon Over Buffalo in 2005, for example) but recent musicals have been directed by non-VHS faculty, with 2008's On the Town being the third production directed by Danielle Aldrich. Verona's drama program expanded in 2008, with the revamping of the theater including new seats, better acoustics, and a new lighting and sound booth. A One-Act Play Festival began in May of that year, bringing the number of theater offerings to four per year. In Fall 2016, the program relaunched with the hiring of Laurence Fry and Steven Munoz to head the program after the retirement of Fran Young. The first production put on under the new team was You Can't Take It With You by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart in November 2016. Next was the classic Cole Porter musical Anything Goes in March 2017. The next year, Fry departed the program, and it continued under Munoz with their next production, The Curious Savage by John Patrick in November 2017,Article in \\"MyVeronaNJ\\" with two of the performers being nominated for \\"Foxy Awards\\" - Ava Vasalani (Ethel Savage) for Lead Actress, and Maya Fortgang (Fairy May) for Supporting Actress. The musical that school year was CurtainsArticle in \\"MyVeronaNJ\\" in March 2018, which became the first VHS musical to participate in the Rising Star Awards since Munoz took over. That fall, the production was The Secret in the Wings, a Marry Zimmerman play, in November 2018.Article in \\"MyVeronaNJ\\" To fundraise for the program, the Spotlight Players put on a \\"murder mystery\\" dinner, where the actors, with packets of information on the mystery, would go table to table, talking to the guests about the investigation at hand.Article in \\"MyVeronaNJ\\" The dinner took place in January 2019. The next musical was The Addams Family in March 2019, which quickly became one of the more successful productions in recent years for the program,Article in \\"MyVeronaNJ\\" earning around $9,000 in ticket sales alone. On April 12, 2019, the nominations for Montclair State University's Theatre Night \\"Foxy\\" Awards were announced. VHS's production of The Secret in the Wings was nominated in five categories, including Outstanding Achievement in Choreography/Movement, Outstanding Achievement in Stage Crew, Outstanding Achievement by an Acting Ensemble of a Dramatic Stage Adaptation of a Literary Work or Film, Outstanding Production of a Drama Stage Adaptation of Literary Work or Film, and Excellence in Dramaturgy. The fall play of 2019 was the classic William Shakespeare comedic play, The Comedy of Errors, one of few Shakespearean productions ever performed at Verona High School. The production was performed on November 14, 15, and 16th, 2019. Their next production was the musical The Mystery of Edwin Drood on March 5, 6, and 7th, 2020. In addition, the Spotlight Players also presented their second annual murder mystery, \\"Once Upon a Murder\\", in January 2020 at Verona Community Center. On April 15, the nominations for the 2020 Theatre Night \\"Foxy\\" Awards were announced, and VHS's production of The Comedy of Errors was nominated in four categories - Supporting Actor in a Classical Play (Griffin Willner as Egeon), Lead Actor in a Classical Play (Aidan Callari as Antipholus of Syracuse), Lead Actress in a Classical Play (Abby Bermeo as Dromio of Ephesus), and Acting Ensemble of a Classical Play.

Prior to that, Shebarshin had served as Kryuchkov's deputy from April 1987. Early life After graduating in 1952 from high school with a silver medal, Shebarshin entered the Indian branch of the Moscow Institute of Oriental Studies. In connection with the closing of the institute in 1954, he transferred to the third course of Faculty of Oriental Studies MGIMO. In 1957, he married another classmate, a student of the Chinese Branch Nina Vassilyevna Pushkina. Upon graduation, he sent in October 1958 to work as a referent of the USSR Embassy in Pakistan. In 1962, he completed the trip to the post of third secretary of the embassy and was taken to work in the department of South-East Asian Affairs of the USSR. Pakistan Also in 1962, he was invited to join the First Chief Directorate (foreign intelligence) KGB and began a new career in the rank of second lieutenant and security officer positions. After a year training in intelligence school, was sent to work in Pakistan under diplomatic cover. The importance of Pakistan for intelligence at the time determined by the participation of the country's military-political blocs CENTO and SEATO, close ties with the United States, the conflict relations with neighboring India and rapprochement with China. Extraordinary interest is the large American colony in India: military advisers, diplomats, spies, journalists, etc. Acquisition sources in U.S. facilities was the most important task of all foreign residencies of the KGB. At the initiative of the Soviet Union, leaders of the warring parties, the President of Pakistan and the Prime Minister of India met in January 1966 in Tashkent. This was a major diplomatic success of the Soviet side, and presided at her Kosygin. For contribution to the preparation of the conference LV Shebarshin was promoted to the post. In the service characteristics indicated that LV Shebarshin \\"achieved concrete results in the recruiting work.\\" The clerical language means buying agents in the intelligence penetration of objects. India In 1968, Shebarshin returned to Moscow and took a year-long training course to improve managerial staff. In early 1971, he was sent as a deputy KGB resident in India, and in 1975, he was appointed a resident. During the trip, there was another Indo- Pakistani War, which ended the division of Pakistan and the creation of Bangladesh, along with a state of emergency in India. Close attention required activities of American representatives in India; for decades, the United States remained the main opponent of the Soviet Union and the main object of the aspirations of Soviet intelligence. Great importance in that period was India's relations with China. Job residency on the key areas were assessed positively by the Center and the political leadership of the USSR. Iran In April 1977, a six-year trip to India ended, and in late 1978, he received orders to prepare to work in Iran. Intelligence predicted the fall of the monarchy in Iran is coming true, the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, in January 1979, ran for the border. The spiritual leader of the opposition, Ayatollah Khomeini, returned to Iran and received national recognition the title of \\"Imam\\". The collapse of the monarchy marked an unprecedented intensification of the internal political struggle, degenerated into armed clashes and numerous acts of terror, undertaken by all contending parties. Losing a loyal ally and client, the Shah, he tried to regain its position in Iran, the United States, stepped up the opponents and supporters of the Soviet Union. In November 1979, students, the followers of Khomeini took \\"by storm the U.S. Embassy and hostage-taking of American diplomats, Iran's relationship with the U.S. are broken. These, however, does not mean changing the situation in favor of the USSR. The Iranian leadership was determined to prevent the growing influence of its northern neighbor. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979 has led to a noticeable cooling of the Iranian-Soviet relations and the reason for the repeated attacks on the Soviet embassy.\\" The residency suffered losses, the conditions for work with sources being extremely complex. Still, Moscow has received accurate and timely intelligence information. In 1982 was the worst event in the life of Shebarshin, treason. He escaped through Turkey to the West on a false British passport residency officer, Vladimir Kuzichkin (as it turned out later that the traitor was recruited by British intelligence in the Shah's time, and, panicked by the danger of exposure, ran). The consequences of betrayal was partly contained. A few sources, which could tell the traitor, were withdrawn from the blow, but the moral and political damage was great. Whatever the causes and circumstances of incidents, the resident is fully responsible for everything that happens at the station. On the flight AK was reported to Brezhnev. \\"Well,\\" said Leonid Ilyich, \\"is a war and a war without the loss does not happen.\\" Later life In 1983, Shebarshin returned to Moscow for a few months in the headquarters unit under the chief of the PGU VA Kryuchkov and was appointed deputy chief of information-analytical department of intelligence. In 1984 Shebarshin, accompanying VA Kryuchkov, went on mission in Kabul belligerent. Until mid-1991, he had to commit more than 20 missions in Afghanistan, to become intimately familiar, with the leaders of the country B. Karmal, Najibullah, Keshtmand etc. In 1987, Shebarshin appointed deputy chief of PGU KGB and manages intelligence operations in the Middle East and Africa. In February 1989, he replaced Kryuchkov as vice president and he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general. In September 1991, as a result of differences with the new leadership of the KGB submits a report on the resignation and dismissed from military service. At the end of that year, together with his colleagues and friends - former chief of analytical department of the KGB, Lieutenant- General Leonov and former Vice-President - Head of the Main Directorate of the KGB in Moscow and Moscow region, Lieutenant-General V.

His name is immortalized in the museum's Foreign Intelligence Service. When KGB Chief Kryuchkov was arrested following the unsuccessful August 1991 coup against Mikhail Gorbachev, Shebarshin became head of the KGB for two days. He was replaced by Vadim Bakatin, whose job was essentially to dismantle the KGB. Shebarshin returned to his post as FCD head until Bakatin announced a new FCD deputy director, Vladimir Rozhkov, without consulting him. Shebarshin resigned his post on 20 September 1991. With his friend, Nikolai Leonov, Shebarshin founded a consulting firm, the Russian National Economic Security Service (RNESS), which is based in Moscow. He committed suicide in Moscow by shooting himself with his own gun. He was 77. By that time he had survived a stroke which led to complete blindness. According to his friends and colleagues, he suffered from hard depression and lost a lot of weight, which was caused by a serious illness.An Illness Could Be The Only Cause of the Suicide Committed by the Ex-Director of the Soviet Foreign Intelligence Service // Rosbalt, 2012-04-02 (in Russian)Sergei Smirnov, The Last Soviet Intelligence Officer // Gazeta.ru, 2012-03-30 (in Russian)  See also  *Vladimir Lokhov  References   External links  *–ü–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥–Ω–∏–π –±–æ–π –ö–ì–ë (The Last Battle of the KGB) Leonid Shebarshin memories, Moscow (2013), 256 p (in Russian) ‚Äì Category:1935 births Category:2012 deaths Category:People from Moscow Category:KGB chairmen Category:KGB officers Category:Moscow State Institute of International Relations alumni Category:Soviet diplomats Category:Suicides by firearm in Russia Category:Spies who committed suicide Category:Burials in Troyekurovskoye Cemetery Category:KGB operatives in Iran ","title":"Leonid Shebarshin"},{"id":"3928276","text":"Eisenstadt (March 2008) Shmuel Noah Eisenstadt (Hebrew: ◊©◊û◊ï◊ê◊ú ◊†◊ó ◊ê◊ô◊ô◊ñ◊†◊©◊ò◊ì◊ò 10 September 1923, Warsaw - 2 September 2010, Jerusalem)Israel Prize laureate Shmuel Noah Eisenstadt dies at 87 was an Israeli sociologist.

Its earliest antecedents date to 1801. As of January 1, 2016, the daily circulation of the paper was listed as 19,000 daily Monday‚ÄìSaturday, with a Sunday circulation of 24,000. History The Williamsport Sun-Gazette was founded in 1801 as the Lycoming Gazette. At the time of the newspaper's conception, there were 131 residents in the town of Williamsport, Pennsylvania. The newspaper was started in a building in what is now the vicinity of Penn Street and Washington Boulevard. The Gazette name has been on the nameplate and masthead of a newspaper in Williamsport continuously since that time. The Sun-Gazette is the oldest continuously operating enterprise in the West Branch Valley. At over 218 years old, the Sun-Gazette is now the 10th-oldest newspaper in America and the fourth-oldest in Pennsylvania. More than 32 other newspapers have operated and closed in the Williamsport area since 1801. The Lycoming Gazette was a weekly paper from 1801 until 1867, when it was first published as a daily newspaper. The Lycoming Gazette then purchased the West Branch Bulletin, which was founded in 1860, and merged in 1869 to become the Gazette and Bulletin, which was a daily morning newspaper. A rival newspaper, the Williamsport Sun, printed for the first time on July 8, 1870, as an afternoon paper. =20th century through today= In 1955, the morning Gazette & Bulletin and the afternoon Williamsport Sun were consolidated and became the Williamsport Sun- Gazette, the area's afternoon newspaper. John E. Person Jr. served as president of the new Williamsport Sun-Gazette from 1955 to 1990. On July 1, 1990, the family-owned Sun-Gazette was acquired by another family owned newspaper group, Ogden Newspapers, which operates more than 40 newspapers throughout the United States, including the East Lycoming Shopper & News and the Muncy Luminary, both in Lycoming County. The Williamsport Sun-Gazette has been led by a series of publishers since 1990. Publishers of The Williamsport Sun-Gazette for Ogden Newspapers, Inc. since July 1, 1990, include Thomas C. Briley 1990‚Äì2000, John A. Fusco 2001, John J. Yahner Nov. 2001 ‚Äì Sept. 2007, Robert O. Rolley Jr. Oct. 2007‚Äì2008, Bernard A. Oravec 2009-2018, Robert O. Rolley Jr. 2019‚Äìcurrent. Robert O. Rolley Jr. returned to lead the Williamsport Sun-Gazette in 2019 shortly after the departure of Bernard A. Oravec, who accepted an appointment as publisher of Barash Media in State College, Pennsylvania. Rolley now serves as publisher of both the Williamsport Sun-Gazette and The Express in Lock Haven. In January 1991, the Sun-Gazette published the first Sunday edition, becoming a seven-day-a-week publication, including holidays. Prior to that time, the Grit newspaper was the Sunday paper for the area, until Grit was purchased and moved to Topeka, Kansas, in 1993, later converting to magazine format. Coincidentally, both the Sun- Gazette and Grit are now owned by Ogden Newspapers. On August 9, 1999, 130 years after the merger of the Lycoming Gazette and the West Branch Bulletin, the Sun-Gazette returned to the morning edition format. The Sun-Gazette has won numerous advertising, creative and editorial awards. It is nationally known for its coverage of the fracking industry, and also covers some news in neighboring counties, especially Clinton County, Tioga County and Sullivan County. It also covers Penn State University football and 17 local high school athletic programs. The paper offers an almost exclusively conservative point of view, mainly through its original and syndicated editorials, as well as its selective use of articles from the Associated Press. The daily local news reporting is generally fair. The Sun-Gazette often partners with the local community, through donation of advertising space in support of local civic, scholastic, and service organizations. In addition, the company offers editorial support to many Williamsport-area businesses and charities. A Community Keystone; The Official History of The Williamsport Sun-Gazette was published in July 2018. This special hardcover book contains over 500 photos and 448 pages of detailed newspaper and community history, divided into 37 chapters that cover the entire 217 years of newspaper publication in Williamsport since 1801. This book was featured on PCN's PA Books television show on November 11, 2018. Online In addition to the printed Sun-Gazette, the newspaper has an online presence at SunGazette.com, which attracts over 165,000 unique visitors and averages over 1.9 million page views per month.
