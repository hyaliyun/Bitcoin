His main work concerned the investigation of interstitial fauna and the exposition of a phylogenetic system for the animals.  Biography  Peter Ax attended the Oberschule für Jungen in Hamburg until 1944 and subsequently completed his military service. He studied biology at the University of Kiel from 1946, and graduated with a doctorate in 1950. From 1952 to 1961, he was employed as a scientific worker at the same university. He gained his habilitation in 1955, and worked as a Dozent. In 1961, he went to the University of Göttingen, where he held the chair in Morphology and Systematic Zoology. He remained there until his retirement as an emeritus professor in 1992.  Research  Peter Ax worked primarily on the micro- and meiofauna of the interstitial environment in marine sediments, and on the systematics of flatworms. He described an array of hitherto unknown species from this environment, including Diplosoma micans, the first tunicate to be found in the interstitial habitat, in 1970. In 1956 he was the first to describe the Gnathostomulida, which was also found from this habitat. Through his works such as Das phylogenetische System (1984) and the three-volume Das System der Metazoa (1995-2001), he also became known as one of the important exponents of phylogenetic systematics in Germany.  Memberships and awards  Peter Ax was the founding editor of the journal Mikrofauna marina.http://www.pfeil-verlag.de/04biol/d7557a.php He worked as a guest scientist at the Friday Harbor Laboratories of the University of Washington, at the marine biological stations in Arcachon, Banyuls-sur-Mer, and Naples, and at the Darwin Station on the Galapagos Islands.

He was selected in the first round of the 2015 NFL Draft by the Cleveland Browns. He played college football at Florida State University. Early years Erving attended Colquitt County High School, where he played as a defensive tackle. He had 98 tackles (48 solo) as a senior. College career Erving playing for Florida State in 2014 Erving played in three games as a defensive tackle as a true freshman in 2010. He recorded one tackle before a back injury caused him to have a medical redshirt. He was a backup defensive tackle and played in all 13 games as a redshirt freshman in 2011. He finished the season with 20 tackles and one sack. Erving was moved to offensive tackle as a sophomore in 2012. He started all 14 games at left tackle, protecting quarterback EJ Manuel's blind side. As a junior in 2013, Erving was a first-team All-ACC selection at left tackle, after protecting quarterback Jameis Winston's blind side, who became the youngest player ever to win the Heisman Trophy. He was also named a second-team All-American by the Associated Press. He began his senior season in 2014 as the starting left tackle, but was moved to center after Austin Barron suffered an arm injury in the fifth game against Wake Forest University. Erving made 42 consecutive starts on the offensive line during his college career. He is a member of the Florida State chapter of Phi Delta Theta fraternity. Professional career=Cleveland Browns On April 30, 2015, Erving was selected with the 19th overall pick by the Cleveland Browns in the 2015 NFL draft. Erving signed a four-year contract worth roughly $10 million, with a signing bonus of about $5 million. As a rookie, he spent time at right guard and left tackle during training camp. He appeared in 16 games with 4 starts at left guard. In 2016, after long-time starting center, Alex Mack, left the Browns via free agency, the coaching staff switched Erving from guard to center as his replacement. He sat out three games after suffering a bruised lung in the second game against the Baltimore Ravens. He started 12 games at center, but struggled with his level of play and with his shotgun snaps. He was moved to the right tackle position for the season finale in place of Austin Pasztor, but suffered an MCL injury during the game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. In 2017, he was competing for the right tackle starting position with Shon Coleman. He struggled during training camp and also suffered a calf injury. Kansas City Chiefs Cameron Erving in 2019 On August 30, 2017, Erving was traded to the Kansas City Chiefs for a 2018 fifth-round pick (#159-Daurice Fountain). He played in 13 games, making four starts (three at right guard and one at left tackle). On May 2, 2018, the Chiefs declined the fifth-year option on Erving's contract. On September 4, 2018, Erving signed a two-year contract extension with the Chiefs. Although he was considered to be at risk of making the team, he earned the starting left guard position during training camp. He appeared in 14 games with 13 starts. In 2019, he started eight games at left tackle, while Eric Fisher recovered from a sports-hernia surgery. Erving won his first championship when the Chiefs defeated the San Francisco 49ers 31-20 in Super Bowl LIV. The Chiefs declined the 2020 option on Erving's contract, making him a free agent. Dallas Cowboys On May 6, 2020, Erving signed a one-year contract with the Dallas Cowboys, to compete for the swing tackle position.

These substances are often the secretions, parts, or entire bodies of other animals or plants. The animal may chew these substances and then spread the resulting saliva mixture over their body, or they may apply the source of the odour directly with an appendage, tool or by rubbing their body on the source. The functions of self-anointing differ between species, but it may act as self-medication, repel parasites, provide camouflage, aid in communication, or make the animal poisonous. Primates Several primate species self-anoint with various items such as millipedes, leaves and fruit. They sometimes drool while doing this. Both capuchin monkeys and squirrel monkeys perform urine washing, when they deposit a small quantity of urine onto the palm of a hand and then rub it on the sole of the opposite foot. It is thought to have multiple functions including hygiene, thermoregulation and response to irritation from biting ectoparasites (such as ticks and botfly). Some strepsirrhines and New World monkeys also self-anoint the body with urine to communicate. Capuchins Wild wedge- capped capuchin monkeys (Cebus olivaceus) self-anoint with millipedes (Orthoporus dorsovittatus). Chemical analysis revealed these millipedes secrete two benzoquinones, compounds known to be potently repellent to insects and the secretions are thought to provide protection against insects, particularly mosquitoes (and the bot flies they transmit) during the rainy season. Millipede secretion is so avidly sought by the monkeys that up to four of them will share a single millipede. The anointment must also involve risks, since benzoquinones are toxic and carcinogenic, however, it is likely that for capuchins, the immediate benefits of self-anointment outweigh the long-term costs. Secretions from these millipedes also elicit self-anointing in captive male and female tufted capuchin (C. apella) and white-faced capuchin (C. capucinus) monkeys. Wild Cebus anoint more with plant parts, including fruits, whereas wild Sapajus anoint more with ants and other arthropods. White-faced capuchins in particular use more plant species at each site for anointing compared with other capuchins and may specialize in anointing as an activity independent from foraging, whereas most other capuchin species tend to eat the substances they use for anointing. Wild Cebus anoint at a higher frequency than Sapajus as occurs in captive groups. However, contrary data from captive animals there no difference in the range of sociality for anointing between Cebus and Sapajus in the wild. Capuchin monkeys at the Edinburgh Zoo rub onions and limes on their skin and into their fur as an antiseptic and insect repellent. Video of capuchins self-anointing. White-faced capuchin monkeys sometimes anoint their bodies with mud and plant matter, a natural insect repellent. With their heads and faces slathered in this mixture, these highly social primates lose their ability to recognise each other and previously friendly monkeys can become fighting foes. Spider monkeys Mexican spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) self-anoint with the leaves of three species of plants; the Alamos pea tree (Brongniartia alamosana), the trumpet tree (Cecropia obtusifolia) and wild celery (Apium graveolens). In one study, only two males in a group of 10 individuals displayed self-anointing. Only the sternal and axillary regions of the body were rubbed with the mix of saliva and plant material. There was a lack of correlation between the occurrence of self-anointing and time of day, season of the year, ambient temperature or humidity, indicating that this behaviour does not function in repelling insects and/or mitigating topical skin infections in this species. Rather, the three plant species spread an intensive and aromatic odour when crushed, indicating that self-anointing in Mexican spider monkeys may play a role in the context of social communication, possibly for signalling of social status or to increase sexual attractiveness. Lemurs Male ring-tailed lemurs have scent glands on their wrists, chests, and in the genital area. During encounters with rival males they may perform ritualised aggression by having a \\"stink fight\\". The males anoint their tails by rubbing the ends of their tails on the inside of their wrists and on their chests. They then arch their tails over their bodies and wave them at their opponent. The male toward which this is directed either responds with a display of his own, physical aggression, or flees. \\"Stink fights\\" can last from 10 minutes to one hour. Black lemurs have also been observed self-anointing with millipedes. Ungulates Several ungulates self-anoint with their own urine.Gosling, L. M. \\"A reassessment of the function of scent marking in territories.\\" Ethology 60.2 (1982): 89-118. Sometimes this is directly onto their body, or at other times, it is deposited onto the ground or into a wallow and the animal rubs its body onto the substrate. In Nile lechwe, a unique form of marking is seen with the start of mating. The male bends his head to the ground and urinates on his throat and cheek hair. He then rubs his dripping beard on the female's forehead and rump. Deer Unlike other deer species, chital do not spray urine on their bodies. Instead, male chital mark their territory by dripping urine in scrapes, and then pawing them. Sambar stags will wallow and dig their antlers in urine soaked soil and then rub against tree trunks.Deer of the world: their evolution, behaviour, and ecology. Valerius Geist. Stackpole Books. 1998. Pg. 73-77.The Deer and the Tiger: A Study of Wildlife in India. George Schaller. University Of Chicago Press. 1967. Pg. 134-148. (Midway Reprint) A stag will also mark himself by spraying urine directly in the face with a highly mobile penis, which is often erect during rutting activities. Similar urine-spraying behavior is common in other deer species, and is known as automarking. Throughout the year white-tailed deer will rub-urinate, a process during which a deer squats while urinating so that urine will run down the insides of the deer's legs, over the tarsal glands, and onto the hair covering these glands. Bucks rub-urinate more frequently during the breeding season.Karen J. Alexy, Jonathan W. Gassett, David A. Osborn and Karl V. Miller, (2001). \\"White-Tailed Deer Rubs and Scrapes: Spatial, Temporal and Physical Characteristics and Social Role\\", Wildlife Society Bulletin, 29(3): 873-878. =Elk= A self- anointing male elk Bull elk often dig holes in the ground, in which they urinate and roll their body. The urine soaks into their hair and gives them a distinct smell which attracts cows. Some deer species, including elk, can mark themselves by spraying urine on their bodies from an erect penis. One type of scent-marking behavior in elk is known as \\"thrash-urination, which typically involves palpitation of the erect penis. A male elk's urethra points upward so that urine is sprayed almost at a right angle to the penis. When urine marking, the male elk advertises this with a specialised vocalisation called the \\"bugle\\". During the last phase of the bugle, the bull rubs (palpates) his belly in rhythm with \\"yelps\\". He then directs a spray of urine towards his stomach or the ground. The hair on his stomach in front of the penis becomes soaked with urine and gains a dark brown tint. Urine spraying is a variable behaviour. It may consist of simply dribbling a few drops of urine, or, large rhythmic discharges from an erect penis. A stream may be aimed at the mane on the neck, or, a fine mist might be sprayed against the stomach. The bull usually rub/palpates during this process. The urine can be voided almost at right angles to the erect penis. When a large volume of urine is sprayed, it usually takes place at a wallow. When urine spraying, the bull lowers his head towards the ground. In this position, his mane becomes soaked as he sprays urine forwards, between his legs. Once the wallow has been created, the male elk lowers himself into the area, rolls on his side and rub his mane on the soaked area of the wallow. He rubs the side of his face, his chest, stomach, legs, and flanks, which all become caked with mud. During wallowing, the elk's penis may remain erect and he may continue to spray urine. =Red deer= Male red deer anoint their wallows with urine and roll in these in a very similar way to elk. Goats Male goats self-anoint with their urine. This is done by extending the penis, bending the haunches and extending the head backwards causing the urine to hit the mouth, throat, face and beard. This type of urination is possibly an indicator of rank and physical condition, and plays an important role in goat reproduction. Rodents The rice-field rat (Rattus rattoides) displays self-anointing behaviour in response to the anal- gland secretions of the weasel Mustela sibirica, however, they do not respond to the faeces and urine of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes). Juvenile rats born in the laboratory with no experience of weasels also display self-anointing behaviour. In this species, the self-anointing behaviour is not sex-specific or age-specific. Ground squirrels chew rattlesnake skins and then lick their fur, a behaviour likely to deter that particular predator. Hedgehogs Frothy saliva visible on the head of a juvenile male European hedgehog after self-anointing. European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) have been widely reported to self-anoint with a range of toxic and irritating substances, particularly when introduced to a new or strong-smelling substance. These substances include toad skin, tobacco, soap and faecal matter. The hedgehog chews and licks at these substances when it encounters them which produces frothy saliva-substance mix that the hedgehog then spreads onto its spines. Young hedgehogs will react to these substances and sometimes also lick substances on the spines of their mothers and self-anoint. Self-anointing has been observed in hedgehogs as young as 15 days of age, before their eyes open. In one study, indications of self-anointing were observed in more than 11% of all observations. First-year, independent young self-anointed more than adults, and male hedgehogs had more indications of self-anointing than females. Self-anointing in adults displayed a peak in the summer, while no clear pattern was observed for young. It was concluded that self-anointing is dependent on gender, age and season. Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain the function of self-anointing in hedgehogs. It may function as a form of scent camouflage, to mask their own scent with the new scent in the environment. Hedgehogs are resistant to many toxins and one theory is that hedgehogs spread toxins on their quills as added protection. Hedgehogs will sometimes kill toads (Bufo), bite into the toads' poison glands and smear the toxic mixture on their spines. Canines Several canines self-anoint. In these species, it is sometimes known as scent rolling. Domestic dogs Domestic dogs often roll in odoriferous substances, choosing items such as cow manure, a road kill, or rotten fish. Wolves Captive wolves will scent roll in a wide range of substances including animal feces, carrion (elk, mouse, pig, badger), mint extract, perfume, animal repellant, fly repellent, etc. Bears North American brown bears (Ursos arctos) make a paste of Osha roots (Ligusticum porteri) and saliva and rub it through their fur to repel insects or soothe bites. This plant, locally known as bear root, contains 105 active compounds, such as coumarins that may repel insects when topically applied. Navajo Indians are said to have learned to use this root medicinally from the bear for treating stomach aches and infections. Birds A black drongo in a typical \\"anting\\" posture The use of millipedes in self-anointing by birds has been reported for the strong-billed woodcreeper (Xiphocolaptes promeropirhyncus) in Belize, the little shrike-thrush (Colluricincla megarhyncha parvula) in Australia, the black-throated shrikebill (Clytorhynchus nigrogularis) and the jungle mynah (Acridotheres fuscus) in the Fiji Islands, the European robin (Erithacus rubecula) in England and the grey- winged trumpeter (Psophia crepitans) and the pale-winged trumpeter (P. leucoptera) in northern South America. In one study, mothballs (which contain naphthalene) were placed in a flowerbed. A common grackle picked one out, extended its left wing and rubbed the mothball up and down the length of the shaft of each of the secondary feathers. The grackle went on to rub the mothball over its secondary coverts on the ventral side and onto the propatagium area. The grackle then repeated the same rubbing actions on its right wing. The entire rubbing behaviour lasted approximately 10 minutes. European starlings also performed a similar behaviour with mothballs. During anting, birds rub insects on their feathers, usually ants, which secrete liquids containing chemicals such as formic acid. These can act as an insecticide, miticide, fungicide, bactericide, or to make the insects edible by removing the distasteful acid. It possibly also supplements the bird's own preen oil. Although it has been suggested that anting acts as a way of reducing feather parasites such as mites or in controlling fungi or bacteria, there has been little convincing support for any of the theories. Some cases of anting involved the use of millipedes or puss moth caterpillars, and these too are known to release powerful defensive chemicals. Another suggested function, based on observation of blue jays, is that the bird makes the insects edible, by discharging the harmful acid onto their feathers. The birds were found to show anting behaviour only if the ants had a full acid sac, and with subjects whose acid sacs had been experimentally removed, the behaviour was absent. Finally, it has also been suggested that anting is related to feather moulting. The metabolic products of the ants may soothe skin irritated by unusually rapid feather replacement. However, the correlation may also be attributed to the greater activity of ants in summer. Related behaviours Some birds like antbirds and flickers not only wear ants, but also consume the ants as an important part of their diet. Other opportunist ant-eating birds include sparrows, wrens, grouse and starlings. Social anointing Owl monkeys (Aotus spp.) will anoint each other in groups of two or more by rubbing their bodies against one another while self-anointing with millipedes. Social anointing has been observed anecdotally in a captive colony for almost ten years. In 24, 5-min presentations to this group, a total of 25 separate bouts of social anointing were observed. Twenty-four of 35 owl monkeys were observed to socially anoint, including all ages and both sexes, in bouts which ranged from 5–322 seconds.

Description Adetomyrma aureocuprea, only known from males, is easily separable from the other Adetomyrma males by the yellowish body color, no mesoscutal notaulus, poorly developed subpetiolar process, lack of posterodorsal projection or lobe on the paramere, short hairs on the compound eye, and vestigial parapsidal line. The males of Adetomyrma aureocuprea display remarkable morphological variation in, for example, the size of the eye and ocelli, head shape, mesonotal shape, petiolar shape, and hairs on body surface. Sympatry A. aureocuprea is completely sympatric with A. bressleri, A. caputleae, A. goblin, and A. venatrix, and has been collected within a 20 km radius of A. cilium and within a 70 km radius of A. caudapinniger. The morphological differences between all species are clear and consistent in each case of sympatric and geographically close localities, even though apparent similarity may be shown to a character of another Adetomyrma species collected from distant localities. In addition to the above species, the distribution of A. aureocuprea is parapatric with A. clarivida. Separation between A. aureocuprea and A. clarivida is strongly supported by the morphological differences observed in the aedeagus.

Similar to other real estate leases, a telecommunications lease is put in place as an agreement to lease space on the landowner’s property for a telecommunications site or cellular tower for a specified length of time. In exchange for the use of space, the telecommunications provider (also referenced as a tenant) agrees to pay the landowner (a monthly or annual) rent.\\"Helping landowners understand telecoms lease agreements\\" \\"Talents Solicitors\\", May 5, 2011 Telecom leases can be excellent sources of ancillary income, in some cases providing the landowner with thousands of dollars per month.  Industry growth  The telecommunication industry is growing as the need for 4G and 5G networks flourishes. As a result of this growth there is a constant demand for cellular networks to increase their coverage. Therefore, more cellular towers are constructed and more leases are drawn up between the cellular provider and landowners, which can include municipalities and private landowners, such as homeowners.  Types of leases  In the telecommunications industry, there are two types of telecommunications leases: a rooftop lease agreement and a ground lease agreement. In some cases, cellular sites are installed on the roofs of commercial office buildings and even residential living complexes. These rooftop installations take advantage of the height of the buildings on which they are installed to provide quality cellular coverage.\\"Mining the Roof: An article on telecommunication rooftop installations and leases\\" \\"Phillips Nizer LLP Articles\\", 2013 Ground leases, on the other hand are contracts typically made between the cellular provider and the landowner of a property for space at the ground level on which a cellular tower is installed.\\"Canada: Ground Lease Characteristics - Lender Issues\\" \\"Mondaq\\", July 3, 2013  Rooftop leases  Rooftops are leased for many different communication purposes, including many different types of antennas. Panel antennas are commonly placed on rooftops in urban and densely populated residential areas. These antennas typically range from 1–10 feet in height and have the ability to service multiple technologies, including: cellular antennas, PCS antennas, specialized mobile radios, fixed wireless services, and paging services.\\"New Technologies Bring New Revenue for Property Owners Who Know the Issues\\" \\"CCIM Institute\\" Satellite dishes are also mounted on some rooftops, primarily for satellite TV service, but in other cases much larger dishes are used. These antennas generally address Internet and cable needs and therefore are used for services such as video conferencing.\\"The Vertical Investment: What You Should Know About Cell Towers\\" \\"Accuplan\\", November 8, 2013 Rooftop leases include details about the amount of space leased, installation methods, and upgrade procedures that allow the tenant to operate at the site as needed, while protecting the landlords building.  Ground leases  Ground leases generally address antenna towers or billboards in which the landowner leases the space, or land, to the cellular provider to build the tower.\\"Leases Generally\\" \\"McTexLaw\\", 2008 Antenna towers range between 50 and 300 feet tall. These large, free standing cellular towers can sometimes be “disguised” to blend in with the natural architecture of the building or the surrounding landscape. An example of this is a church property that may have a tower built to resemble, or in some cases built into an existing steeple. Alternatively, a property owner for another type of property may have a monopine or monopalm cellular structure.\\"Camouflage and Concealment Products\\" \\"Environmental Integration\\" These are built to resemble pine or palm trees respectively. Cellular providers such as Verizon Wireless and AT&T; most commonly use ground leases.  Components = Location  Zoning  Proposals for new cell towers sometimes face public opposition in zoning proceedings from residents who raise aesthetic objections and fear health hazards.John Larson, Cell tower draws resistance , Tacoma Weekly (April 1, 2009).Shelby Carignan, Proposed Scarborough zoning change to allow cell towers near homes with poor reception hits snag, Bangor Daily News (August 15, 2014).Andrew Dys, Clover residents rail against 180-foot cell tower - zoning board approves it anyway, The Herald (January 14, 2016). Local zoning boards must follow the rules set forth in the Telecommunications Act of 1996.Telecommunications Act of 1996, Federal Communication Commission, May 31, 2011 which sets guidelines for what are acceptable reasons to not permit the construction of a new cellular tower.  Redundancy  Generally cellular providers look for property that is in a densely populated area and that falls outside of a five-mile radius from the nearest tower. For a cellular company, redundancy occurs when two or more towers serve the same area.\\"What will happen to my cell tower lease if AT&T; acquires T-Mobile?\\" \\"Best Portable GPS\\", 2013 This often causes a loss of income for the cellular provider, as they generally need one tower rather than multiple. As companies continue to merge, redundancy has become a rising issue within the telecommunication industry.\\"How Much Is My Cell Tower Lease Worth?\\" \\"Cell Tower Lease Buyout Experts\\", 2013  Duration and termination  Generally, telecom leases are for an initial five-year term followed by additional five-year renewal terms. Leases typically also have a 30- to 90-day cancellation period when the cellular provider has the right to terminate the lease within 30 to 90 days of giving notice to the landowner. This specific portion of a telecom lease is due to recent mergers in the industry, which render some towers useless.\\"Tips For Negotiating a Rooftop Antenna Lease\\" \\"Niles, Barton & Wilmer LLP\\", 2013 Due to cellular providers merging with other cellular companies, one company can double its number of towers. This often causes redundancy, as previously mentioned, which often leads to the termination of leases and removal of redundant towers.  Fair market value  The fair market value of a lease is generally determined by the importance of the location to the cellular carrier's network, or the value of the coverage the location provides. Value will also be driven by the availability of surrounding alternate sites. Determining the fair market value of a cellular lease is difficult for most landowners due to lack of available information. Cell tower lease rates are not public information, and these rates vary widely. There are however companies that specialize in providing information and assistance to property owners in this highly specialized field. In order to make money, cellular carriers often undervalue a lease. Leasing agents typically receive bonuses for signing low-priced leases, and therefore undervalue leases because the worse the deal is for the landowner, the greater the benefits are for the leasing agent. There are several methods for a landowner to evaluate their property: #Are there cell towers owned by the cellular company near by? #Is your property located in a densely populated area? #Is there a high demand for cellular coverage near your property?  Footprint  Colocation  Colocation is when the cellular company allows other companies to build on their tower. As a result, the cellular company that owns the tower receives a rent from the co-locators. Within a lease, landowners can address colocation and receive a portion of the rent received by the cellular company.\\"Telecommunications Leases\\" \\"STCL.edu\\"\\"The legal ins and outs of telecommunications leases\\" \\"Real Estate Weekly\\", April 21, 1999  Cell tower lease buyout  Property owners have the ability to sell their cell tower lease separate from their parcel. Investors purchase the cell tower lease as an easement or lease assignment. Three main factors that influence cell tower buyout prices are: current rent, the rent escalator, and the date of lease expiration. Different types of cell tower lease buyout offers have different implications for landowners. For example, a cell tower lease buyout on farmland is much different than the purchase of a lease on a building rooftop. Some necessary considerations for cell tower lease buyout transactions are: * Access requirements. * Tax implications. (easement vs. lease assignment) * Property redevelopment rights. * For rooftop sites, how is property damage addressed. The challenges of selling a cellular leasehold is the acquisition market is highly unregulated. Lease Acquisition agents have the ability to modify and deliver information to the landowner to acquire leaseholds at a highly discounted price. Similar the oil barons of the 1800s, these agents are compensated heavily to obtain these rights, and often the underlying value of expiration and an expanded sale market is shielded from the landowner.

First appearing in the Oligocene these foraminifera are found in all modern oceans. Species of this genus occupy the euphotic zone, generally at depths between 10-50m, in waters which cover a range of salinities and temperatures. They are a shorter lived species, especially when compared to Globorotalia genus. As a genus Globigerinoides is widely used in various fields of research including biostratigraphy, isotope geochemistry, biogeochemistry, climatology, and oceanography. Morphology The foraminifera of genus Globigerinoides are all shallow-water species with spinose forms made of hyaline calcite. Most species have trochospiral chamber arrangement, though some species exhibit further complexity with streptospiral chamber arrangement. Tests are composed of thin perforated walls, with very large pores, and spines being added at the end of individual chamber formation. Certain species are known to produce a modified type of calcium carbonate, O enriched-gametogenic calcite, at the end of their life cycle. Prior to gametogenesis and the production of the final calcite layer, the spines are reabsorbed by the foraminifera leaving behind a test that is heavily calcified, and shows the remnants of spine holes. As with other amoeboids these foraminifera utilize pseudopodia. Pseudopodia are widely used throughout their entire lifecycle for various purposes including feeding, movement, protection, and chamber formation. Symbionts Many Globigerinoides species bear photosynthetic symbiotic algae. The relationship between the symbiotic algae and its host foraminifera provides the host with at least three main advantages, including energy from photosynthesis, an enhancement of calcification, and uptake of host metabolites. All in all it is a prime example of ectosymbiosis. For those species that bear symbiotic algae, experiments have shown that their symbionts play a hugely important role in the success of individual foraminifera. Experiments using Globigerinoides sacculifer found that the life cycle of individuals is severely shorted when the symbionts photosynthetic cycle is disrupted or stopped (via darkness or removal of symbionts). Notable species Certain species of Globigerinoides are more commonly used in various types of research than others. Commonly used species include G. ruber,G. sacculifer, G. subquadratus, and G. altiaperturus. Globigerinoides sacculifer Globigerinoides sacculifer exhibits two different morphologies, known as G. sacculifer with sac and G. sacculifer without sac. The sac feature is a sac shaped terminal chamber that is formed prior to the production of the gametogenic calcite. When using G. sacculifer tests for bulk isotope analysis tests without the sac morphology are often preferentially selected. G. sacculifer is also notable for certain in vivo experiments that have been conducted on it. It was found that individuals of this species are able to reconstruct their tests after injury when subjected to slight crushing in a laboratory setting. These repaired tests would often have nonstandard morphologies. Globigerinoides ruber Globigerinoides ruber are carnivorous and prey upon copepods and nauplii. Once a copepod or nauplii is caught in its spines G. ruber uses its pseudopodia to draw the caught prey close to its test to allow it to feed. Also notable about G. ruber is its two morphologies, a form with pink tests, and a form with whitish tests. White test individuals are found today in warm to temperate climate zones of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, where as pink tested G. ruber is now only found in the Atlantic Ocean. It is unknown why the pink individuals are no longer found in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, but this variety disappeared from those oceans ~120,000 yr.G. ruber has been found to tolerate hyposaline waters, in laboratory cultures it was able to remain alive in salinity ranges of 22-49%. Globigerinoides subquadratus Among other microfossil evidence, the last common occurrence of G. subquadratus is defined as the beginning of the Tortonian stage of the geologic time scale. The boundary is defined at the Monte dei Corvi Beach section in Italy. Globigerinoides altiaperturus The first appearance datum of G. altiaperturus is the proposed base of the Burdigalian stage of the geologic time scale. The boundary has not yet been defined with a GSSP by the International Commission on Stratigraphy.

Throughout his life, he designed a number of important urban architectural buildings, mainly in Colombia, where he worked as the department of Antioquia's official architect during the 1920s. Some of his works have been declared National Monuments in Colombia. He died at the age of 58 in Brussels due to leukemia caused by typhoid. Biography Rafael Uribe Uribe Palace of Culture in Medellín, Colombia Augustin Goovaerts was born in Schaerbeek (Brussels) in 1885. He was the son of Celina and Alfonso Van Engelgeny (1847-1922), a leading intellectual in the European academic circles, as a librarian in Antwerp and later as a senior archivist of the Kingdom of Belgium. His father was also a polyglot, historian, musicologist, genealogist, editor. From very young, Augustin Goovaerts began studying drawing at the Academy of Arts in Brussels, which he later completed in addition to architecture and engineering at the University of Leuven. Mandatory practices for students at Belgian universities allowed him to have direct contact with the work of Victor Horta, who was commissioned, the old Abbey of La Cambre, and the Dutchman Hendrik Berlage. He took up residence in Etterbeek, Brussels neighborhood where he began his architectural production, such as: the family home of Goovaerts, completed in 1907, and residences for families Desmet-Sillis and Desvaux-Berleur. He worked for a time in the office of the architect Edmond Serneels (1875-1934), who influenced the work of Goovaerts. There, he was responsible for the construction of the Church of Saint-Antoine, in Etterbeek, completed in 1910. In 1914, he volunteered as a soldier at the beginning of the First World War. He was discharged from military service because of wounds suffered in combat. However, he continued as an active military organizer of a bilingual education network in Calais, the Belgian military barracks on the border with France. Before that, Goovaerts had taught drawing at the Belgian Military Institute of Vocational Rehabilitation. He served military service until 1918. The initial period of his work in Medellin time between 1921 and 1924. During this period he created his largest projects, almost none of which is preserved, such as the Junín Theater, Cellular Jail La Ladera, and Ismael Correa Calpe, which hosted the mayor of Medellin in the twenties. Style When Goovaerts arrived in Colombia, he came with a lot of knowledge to implement. There was division between two stylistic tendencies: a very traditional, orthodox and academic type and an oriented position with the avant-garde, especially the art nouveau and modernism. The first was reflected more in public buildings and the second in his work for individuals. Goovaerts was involved in the design and construction of more than 40 religious buildings.

Jon Hamm and Daniel Radcliffe portray the show's main characters (a doctor at the fictional Muryevo Hospital in Russia at different ages). The first series was broadcast between 6 December and 27 December 2012 on Sky Arts 1, and a second (and final) series aired from 21 November to 12 December 2013. The first series takes place in the year 1917 during the Russian Revolution, and the second series takes place in the following year during the Russian Civil War. Production Mikhail Bulgakov (pictured in the 1910s) wrote the short story collection A Young Doctor's Notebook, drawing upon his own experiences as a newly graduated doctor in 1916–1918, practicing in a small village hospital in Smolensk Governorate and his addiction to morphine and subsequent rehabilitation. The second series is based on the short story titled \\"Morphine\\" by Bulgakov. The title cards and credits use faux Cyrillic. The music for the programme was composed by Stephen Warbeck. It features violin, a clarinet, acoustic guitar, and cello. The theme song was featured on Sky Arts' compilation album Sky Theme Tunes, Vol. 2.Young Doctor's Notebook by Stephen Warbeck \\"Sky Theme Tunes, Vol 2\\", on Amazon.com Series overview Dr. Vladimir Bomgard leads a team at the fictional Muryevo Hospital in Russia. The team consists of Pelageya Ivanovna (Rosie Cavaliero), a junior midwife; Demyan Lukich (Adam Godley), a feldsher; and Anna Nikolayevna (Vicki Pepperdine), a senior midwife. The typical episode follows the team in their attempts to treat patients' illnesses. Bomgard contends with the uneducated populace, which refuses his treatment. He regularly provides them with rapid and accurate diagnoses. Bomgard has a physical relationship with Pelageya. In the third episode, they have sex for the first time. In the second series, they try being a couple, and make their relationship work. In the sixth episode, Bomgard tells Pelageya he never loved her, and they separate. A Young Doctor's Notebook is set in the fictional town of Muryevo, Korobovo in Russia. The first series takes place in the year 1917 during the Russian Revolution, and the second series takes place in the following year during the Russian Civil War. The programme also takes place in the years 1934 and 1935. The show's main character reads his old diary and recalls his experiences, interjecting himself into the story of his younger self. The doctor interacts with his younger self, having conversations that reveal aspects of the story yet to unfold. In the second series, the Russian Civil War begins to affect the fictional Muryevo Hospital, as an influx of wounded soldiers from both the Bolsheviks and the White Guard arrive for treatment. Meanwhile, the young doctor is battling an all-encompassing morphine addiction. His older self stands watch over him, and a young aristocrat named Natasha arrives in the hospital. The young doctor takes an intense, destructive interest in Natasha. At the same time, The Feldsher takes a romantic interest in a tall, moustached Colonel of the White Guard, who is also staying in the hospital. They are both fond of each other, and share a love for pickled sprats. At one point, The Feldsher is seen bringing him a bouquet of flowers. The Colonel reciprocates. A significant plot element is Bomgard's use of morphine to manage pain, caused by living in a remote and isolated community and abdominal pain. When he has no access to morphine, he occasionally self-medicates with cocaine. Bomgard also frequently chain smokes when he is on medical duty. In the first series finale, the young doctor reacts to mercy killing by taking morphine, and his addiction recurs. At the close of the first series finale, the young doctor begins to hallucinate. His addiction leads to conflicts with Pelageya. In the last episode, the young doctor admits he is addicted to morphine, describing himself as a \\"hopeless addict\\". In the first series, the older doctor is under investigation for writing false prescriptions for morphine for himself, before he attempts suicide via overdose, and is subsequently incarcerated as a result. At the opening of the second series premier, the older and rehabilitated Doctor Bomgard is released from a mental institution, with his addiction under control. The young doctor is constantly reminded of the former doctor Leopold Leopoldovitch's austere presence through comments comparing them by the midwives, and the several large, foreboding portraits of Leopold sporting a huge beard on the walls of the medical practice. The young doctor often feels insecure and inadequate when faced with Leopoldovitch's reputation and skills, which grows into resentful annoyance. Cast All five of the main actors appeared in every episode. All five play staff who work at the fictional Muryevo Hospital in Russia. Jon Hamm and Daniel Radcliffe received star billing. * Jon Hamm as the older Dr. Vladmir \\"Nika\\" Bomgard. The older doctor fails to prevent his younger self from making the mistakes he currently regrets. * Daniel Radcliffe as the young Dr. Vladmir \\"Nika\\" Bomgard. A graduate at the top of his class at the Moscow State University of Medicine and Dentistry, he arrives, idealistic, and with no practical experience. In the face of ignorant patients, an endless workload of hopeless cases, little support, a personal illness, and extreme isolation, the young doctor quickly degrades into apathy and despair. The young doctor struggles all the while, gradually descending from chain smoking into morphine addiction. * Rosie Cavaliero as Pelageya Ivanovna, a junior midwife. She is brusquely kind. * Adam Godley as Demyan Lukich, a feldsher. Trained as a field doctor, he practices as the doctor's assistant during operations. He smokes a tobacco pipe, and is fond of pickled sprats and atlases. The young doctor views Lukich as socially inappropriate and annoying, though well-intentioned. * Vicki Pepperdine as Anna Nikolayevna, a senior midwife. She is very stern, and treats the doctor as a child because of his age and inexperience. She has a loving devotion to Leopold Leopoldovitch, the much-admired, much-accomplished previous doctor, and often compares Bomgard to him or cites his many accomplishments. Despite the programme's short run, several recurring characters emerged: * Christopher Godwin as Leopold Leopoldovitch, the former doctor at the hospital. He has an austere presence and high reputation and skills. He appears in hallucinations in the final two episodes of the first series. * Shaun Pye as Yegorych. He appears in three episodes of series one. * Tim Steed as NKVD Agent Kirill, who investigates the older doctor on behalf of the law enforcement agency.

Terminology Both Chinese names hanshisan and wushisan have the suffix -san (, lit. \\"fall apart; scattered\\"), which means \\"medicine in powdered form\\" in Traditional Chinese medicine. Wushi (lit. \\"five rock\\") refers to the component mineral drugs, typically: fluorite, quartz, red bole clay, stalactite, and sulfur. Hanshi (lit. \\"cold food\\") refers to eating cold foods and bathing in cold water to counteract the drug-induced hyperthermia produced by the pyretic powder. Hanshi can also refer to the traditional Chinese holiday Hanshi jie ( \\"Cold Food Festival\\"), three days in early April when lighting a fire is prohibited and only cold foods are eaten. Xingsan (, lit. \\"walk powder\\"), meaning \\"walking after having taken a powder\\" (tr. Mather 1976:19, cf. walk off), was a therapeutic practice believed to circulate poisonous inorganic drug throughout the body, thus enhancing the psychoactive effects and preventing side effects. Mather (1976:20) claims the practice of xingsan \\"to walk a powder\\" was adopted from Xian Daoism, the \\"Immortality Cult\\" of the late Han period. Although some authors transliterate the Chinese terms and (e.g., han-shih san Sailey 1978), many translate them. Compare these renderings of wushisan and/or hanshisan: *powder of the five minerals & swallowed-cold powder (Needham and Lu 1974) *five-mineral powder & cold-food powder (Mather 1976, Akahori 1989) *Five-Stone Powder & Eat-Cold Powder (Schipper 1993) *Five-mineral-powder (Huang and Zürcher 1995) *Five minerals powder & Powder to take with cold food (Obringer 1995) *Cold Food powder (Declercq 1998) *five-mineral-powder (Spiro 1990, McMahon 2002) *cold eating powder (Dikköter et al. 2004) *Cold Food Powder (Kohn 2008) *Five Minerals Powder & Cold-Food Powder (Englehardt 2008) *Cold-Food Powder (Richter 2011) Minor differences in capitalization and hyphenation generally account for these English variants. History Five Minerals Powder was used medicinally in the 2nd century BCE, became a popular recreational entheogen and stimulant, known as Cold-Food Powder, among prominent counterculture literati during the 3rd century, and was deemed immoral and condemned after the 10th century. Han Dynasty Texts from the Han Dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE) refer to using the Wushi Five Minerals to cure fevers and to prolong life. The (109–91 BCE) Shiji biography of the physician Chunyu Yi (, c. 216–147 BCE) contains the earliest Five Minerals reference, according to Joseph Needham, the eminent British historian of science and technology in China. This history includes 25 case reports by Chunyu, including one in which he treated a Dr. Sui () for poisoning around 160 BCE. > Sui, the Physician-in-waiting to the Prince of [Qi], fell ill. He had > himself made preparations of the Five Minerals and had consumed them []. > Your servant therefore went to visit him, and he said 'I am unworthy and > have some disease; would you be so kind as to examine me?' So I did, and > then addressed him in these terms: 'Your malady is a fever []. The > Discussions say that when there is a central fever along with obstipation > and suppression of urine one must not ingest the Five Minerals. Mineral > substances considered as drugs are fierce and potent, and it is because of > having taken them that you have several times failed to evacuate. They ought > not to be hastily taken. Judging by the colour, an abscess is forming.' … I > warned him that after a hundred days or more an abscess would gather above > the pectoral region, that it would penetrate (the flesh by) the collar-bone, > and that he would die. (, tr. Needham 1976:47) Needham (1976:46) describes this pharmaceutical use of the Five Minerals \\"the first well-documented evidence of the taking of inorganic substances\\" in China. The (c. 1st century BCE) Liexian Zhuan biography of the legendary Zhou Dynasty (c. 1046–256 BCE) Daoist xian \\"immortal\\" or \\"transcendent\\" Qiong Shu () mentions the Five Minerals. It says Qiong, who was called Shizhongru (, lit. \\"stone bell milk\\", \\"stalactite\\"), roasted and ate stalactites (), slept on a stone bed, and lived for several hundred years on Mount Song. Qiong obtained the Eight Delicious Foods and Five Minerals, which all provide longevity, and refined their essences into dumplings. A person can thus live to be one hundred, have a light body, sleep among mountain peaks, and wander with the Daoist immortals. [] The Han scholar and alchemist Zheng Xuan (127–200) specified that to make hanshisan, the medically active minerals chalcanthite (shidan), cinnabar (dansha, red mercury sulphide), realgar (the arsenic sulphide xionghuang or xiongshi) and magnetite (cishi) should be enclosed in an earthen receptacle, continuously heated over three days. The drug obtained from the concoction could then be applied to the affected areas of the sick body (Dikötter et al. 2004:30). Six Dynasties The Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove, reputed connoisseurs of the cold food powder, as depicted in the Long Corridor of the Beijing Summer Palace. The historical term \\"Six Dynasties\\" collectively refers to the Three Kingdoms (220–280), Jin Dynasty (265–420), and Southern and Northern Dynasties (420–589). Sources from this period of disunity after the fall of the Han describe both medicinal and recreational uses of Five Mineral Powder or Cold Food Powder. The Three Kingdoms scholar and doctor Huangfu Mi (215–282) took this \\"ecstasy-inducing drug\\" (Declercq 1998:168) to recover from a stroke, but suffered and likely died from the deleterious side effects. His Lun Hanshisan fang ( \\"On the Recipe for Cold-Food Powder\\"; Cao Xi wrote another book with the same title) records his disastrous self-medication that resulted in \\"pain and a general numbness and weakness of the body\\" (Sailey 1978:428). Huangfu said (tr. Schipper 1993:181), \\"The longest one can hope to live when taking the drug is ten years or so; for some, it is only five or six. Even though I myself can still see and breathe, my words resemble the loud laugh of someone who is presently drowning.\\" The Book of Jin says that Huangfu Mi used hanshisan poisoning as an excuse to decline a position offered by Emperor Wu (r. 265–290). The Cold Food Powder (tr. Declercq 1998:188) \\"disagreed with his nature and each time he was convulsed with excruciating pain. Once in a rage of suffering he prayed for a sword with which to kill himself, but his aunt remonstrated with him and made him stop.\\" Huangfu said that the vogue for consuming Cold-Food Powder began with the Cao Wei state (220–265) scholar and politician He Yan (c. 195–249), who used the drug to achieve greater spiritual clarity and physical strength (Englehardt 2008:473). He Yan and his friend Wang Bi (226–249), co-founders of the Daoist Xuanxue School, propagated the consumption of the drug in their philosophical circles. The French sinologist Paul Demiéville's (1986:829) described He Yan: \\"He was reckoned a paragon of beauty, elegance, and refinement, a floating flower (fou-hua) as his enemies used to say, or a dandy. He \\"loved Lao-Huang\\" and shone in \\"pure conversation.\\" His lack of constraint brought down on him the ill-will of the orthodox traditionalists. He is even said to have brought into fashion a drug that brought on a state of ecstasy, and many of his friends and epigones were drug addicts.\\" Many other famous literati, such as the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove, especially the musician Ruan Ji (210–263), the alchemist Ji Kang (223–262), and the calligrapher Wang Xizhi (c. 303–361), reportedly were enthusiastic users of the drug. \\"Like an indulgent lifestyle of alcoholic excesses, the use of this drug became the hallmark of the free thinkers of the age\\" (Englehardt 2008:473). Livia Kohn describes Ruan Ji's artistic expression, > His friends and fellow poets induced ecstatic experiences through music, > wine, and drugs, especially the notorious Cold Food Powder which created > psychedelic states and made the body feel very hot, causing people to take > off their clothes and jump into pools. When back in their ordinary selves, > they wrote poetry of freedom and escape, applying the Zhuangzi concept of > free and easy wandering in the sense of getting away from it all and > continuing the text's tradition in their desperate search for a better world > within. (2008:44) The extant calligraphic writings attributed to Wang Xizhi mention taking hanshisan, for instance, two letters (tr. Richter 2011:388, 400) to his friend Zhou Fu (, d. 365), Regional Inspector of Yizhou prefecture. A thank-you note requests Zhou to send rongyan ( \\"rock salt\\"), \\"Turkestan salt is another thing I require. I need it when I take Cold-Food Powder.\\"; and a lament over their 26-year separation says, \\"Of late, I have been missing you more than I can say. I have been taking Cold-Food Powder for a long time, but I am still weak.\\" The Jin Dynasty Daoist scholar Ge Hong's (c. 320) Baopuzi (\\"[Book of the] Master Who Embraces Simplicity\\") contains invaluable details about the drug powders. Three of the esoteric \\"Inner Chapters\\" (1–20) refer to taking Cold-Food Powder, and using the Five Minerals to make waidan \\"external alchemy\\" miracle elixirs and magic daggers. One of the exoteric \\"Outer Chapters\\" (21–52) criticizes using Five Minerals Powder during mourning. \\"The Genie's Pharmacopeia\\" (chap. 11) compares jade and Cold-Food Powder as drugs that can cause fevers. > Whether taken in small fragments or liquefied and sipped, jade renders man > immortal. It is inferior to gold, however, in that it frequently causes > fever, for it resembles han-shih-san. When jade is taken in small fragments, > a spatula of both realgar and cinnabar should be taken once every ten days. > Then you will not run a fever when traveling against the wind after you have > taken down your hair, washed it, and bathed. (tr. Ware 1966:189) Compare Sailey's (1978:427) translation that after taking the drug one \\"loosens his hair and takes a bath: [having used] cold water, he welcomes the breeze and goes walking. Thus he does not get a fever.\\" Two other Baopuzi Inner Chapters mention wushi. First, \\"Gold and Cinnabar\\" (chap. 4) has several references. The Five Minerals are used to produce the Jiuguangdan (九光丹) elixir that will supposedly raise the dead. > There is also the Ninefold Radiance Elixir, which uses a method similar but > not quite like that of the Nine-Cycle Elixir. Various ingredients are mixed > and fired separately with each of the five minerals, cinnabar, realgar, > arsenolite, laminar malachite, and magnetite []. Each mineral is put through > five cycles and assumes five hues, so that altogether twenty-five hues > result. Separate containers are each filled with one ounce of each hue. If > you wish to raise a body that has not been dead for fully three days, bathe > the corpse with a solution of one spatula of the blue elixir, open its > mouth, and insert another spatula full; it will revive immediately. (tr. > Ware 1966:82) The Five Minerals are also ingredients for making: \\"T'ai-I's elixir for Summoning Gross and Ethereal Breaths\\" () that can revive a corpse up to four days after death, as well as \\"Mo Ti's elixir\\" (), \\"Ch'i-li's elixir\\" (), and \\"Duke Li's elixir\\" () that cure one's illnesses and, if taken over a long period, make one immortal (tr. Ware 1966:87–88). Second, \\"Into Mountains: Over Streams\\" (chap. 17) tells how to make a Five Minerals protective charm that will ensure water-travel safety. > Chin chien chi [] reads; \\"At noon on the ping-wu day of a fifth moon pestle > the Five Minerals to a mixture. The Five Minerals are realgar, cinnabar, > orpiment, alum, and laminar malachite []. When they have all been reduced to > a powder, wash it in 'Gold Flower' solvent and place in a Six-One crucible, > heat over cinnamon wood using a bellows. When this mixture has been > completed, refine it with hardwood charcoal, having young girls and boys > approach the fire. With a male mixture, make a male dagger; with a female > one, make a female dagger, each of them 5.5 inches long. (Earth's number, 5, > is used in order to suppress the stream's powers.) Wear these daggers when > traveling on water, and no crocodiles, dragons, large fish, or water gods > will dare approach you.\\" (tr. Ware 1966:294) Compared with the previous Baopuzi list of the Five Minerals, this one replaces \\"arsenolite\\" () with \\"orpiment\\" () and \\"magnetite\\" () with the logographically similar \\"alum\\" (). One Outer Chapter, \\"Censuring Muddle- headedness\\" (chap. 26), abbreviates wushisan as shisan () in criticizing mourners who use the drug. > I have also heard that noblemen, when in the 'great sorrow' [mourning a > parent's death], or when they take [wu-]shih-san, have several meals [to get > the drug to circulate in the body]. People drink great amounts of wine as if > one's life depended upon it. When their illness has reached the crisis > stage, they cannot endure the wind and the cold [from the fever]. … \\"It gets > to the point where they become very drunk. They say, 'This is the custom in > the capital, Loyang.' Is this not a sad thing? (tr. Sailey 1978:159–160) Ge Hong's friend Ji Han ( c. 262–306) wrote a fu \\"rhapsody; poetic exposition\\" on Cold-Food Powder, which claims \\"it cured his ailing son when other treatments had failed\\" (Lagerway and Lü 2010:358). The (554) Book of Wei records that both the Northern Wei emperors Daowu (r. 386–409) and Mingyuan (r. 409–423) often took Cold-Food Powder, and (tr. Lagerway and Lü 2010:246), \\"In the end, they were 'unable to handle state affairs' and eventually died of elixir poisoning.\\" Wagner (1973:142, Sailey 1978:431) noted that the Northern Wei \\"barbarian\\" rulers regarded the drug as a \\"status symbol.\\" The Liu Song Dynasty (420–479) A New Account of the Tales of the World (Shishuo xinyu ), compiled by Liu Yiqing (, 403–444), contains contemporary references to using the drug. The text uses xingsan four times, wushisan once, fusan ( \\"take powder\\") once, and has two references to harmful side effects. The Shishuo xinyu (tr. Mather 1976:36) only directly refers to wushisan in quoting He Yan (see above), \\"Whenever I take a five-mineral powder, not only does it heal any illness I may have, but I am also aware of my spirit and intelligence becoming receptive and lucid\\" []. The commentary of Liu Xun (, 462–521) explains, > Although the prescription for the cold-food powder (han-shih san) originated > during the Han period, its users were few and there are no accounts handed > down concerning them. It was the Wei president of the Board of Civil Office, > Ho Yen, who first discovered its divine properties, and from his time on it > enjoyed a wide currency in the world, and those who used it sought each > other out. (tr. Mather 1976:36) Two contexts refer to Wang Chen (, d. 392), son of the Eastern Jin official Wang Tanzhi. First, Wang Chen enjoyed taking wushisan with his lifelong friend Wang Gong (, d. 398), brother of Jin Dynasty Empress Wang Fahui (cf. Mather 1976:75 and 143). > Wang Kung was at first extremely fond of Wang Ch'en, but later, encountering > the alienation of Yüan Yüeh, the two eventually became mutually suspicious > and estranged. However, whenever either of them came upon any exhilarating > experience, there would unavoidably be times when they missed each other. > Kung was once walking after having taken a powder (hsing-san), on the way to > the archery hall at Ching-k'ou (near Chien-k'ang). At the time the clear > dewdrops were gleaming in the early morning light, and the new leaves of the > paulownia were just beginning to unfold. Kung looked at them and said, \\"Wang > Ch'en is surely and unmistakably as clear and shining as these!\\" (tr. Mather > 1976:246) Keith McMahon cites the Wangs' wushisan camaraderie as a historical analogy for 19th-century opium addicts. > In one old anecdote, two fourth-century friends of considerable status think > fondly of each other whenever they have a euphoric experience. One of the > friends takes the powder and, coming upon a beautiful scene, immediately > thinks of the brilliance of his absent friend. It was not necessarily that > individuals took the powder together at the same time, but that people of > like interests and status enjoyed the special effects of this drug and did > so without embarrassment or sense of shameful indulgence. (2002:117) Second, when Huan Xuan was summoned to the capital in 387 to serve the crown prince Sima Dezong, his friend Wang Chen came to visit (tr. Mather 1976:390), and was \\"slightly drunk after having taken a powder [fusan ]\\" ... Huan set out wine for him, but since he was unable to drink it cold (because of the powder), Huan unthinkingly said to his attendants, 'Have them warm (wen) the wine and bring it back.' After doing so, he burst into tears and cried out, choking with grief.\\" The commentary explains that Huan, who tended to be overemotional, violated the Chinese naming taboo of his deceased father Huan Wen () when he said wen ( \\"warm\\"). Two Shishuo xinyu contexts mention medical problems that commentators identify as wushisan side effects. When Yin Ji (, d. 397—\\"apparently from an overdose of drugs\\" Mather 1976:604) learned his cousin Yin Zhongkan () was plotting a coup, he refused to participate, took wushisan, and walked away in resignation from his post. \\"When Yin Chi's illness became critical [bingkun ], when he looked at a person, he only saw half of his face\\" (tr. Mather 1976:287), citing Yu Jixia (1963) that \\"temporary impairment of vision\\" was one harmful effect. When Bian Fanzhi () was capital intendant for Huan Xuan in 402, his friend Yang Fu (, c. 373–403) sought help for a bad reaction to wushisan (tr. Mather 1976:370). Yang went to Bian's house and said, \\"My illness is acting up [zhidong ], and I can't endure sitting up.\\" Bian had him lie down on a large bed, and \\"sat keeping vigil by his side from morning until evening.\\" Tang Dynasty The Tang Dynasty (618–908) era was the final heyday for Cold-Food Powder drug users. According to Sun Simiao's (c. 670) Qianjin yifang ( \\"Supplement to the thousand Golden Remedies\\", tr. Englehardt 2008:473), the powder \\"contained five mineral drugs — fluorite, quartz, red bole clay, stalactite and sulfur, one animal drug, and nine plant drugs. It was claimed to be effective in curing many diseases and in increasing vitality, but was also said to have several side effects.\\" Needham and Lu (1974:288) refer to Sun's prescriptions for wushisan and hanshisan (\\"powder of the five minerals\\" and \\"swallowed-cold powder\\"), as well as wushi gengsheng san ( \\"five minerals resurrection powder\\"), and wushi huming san ( \\" five minerals life-preserving powder\\"), \\"all to be used in cases of sexual debility\\". Sun Simiao attributed one formula, the cishi hanshisan ( \\"purple mineral cold powder\\") to the Han Dynasty doctor Zhang Zhongjing, and remarked, \\"There have also been those who have acquired an addiction to the Five-Mineral preparations on account of their avidity for the pleasures of the bedchamber\\", namely Daoist sexual practices. They conclude, \\"China was certainly not the only civilisation to believe that arsenic had aphrodisiac properties; such a view long prevailed in the West.\\" Needham and Lu quote Fan Xingjun ( 1947:42) on historical developments in Chinese aphrodisiacs. > The ancients of Chou and Han times, he said, relied upon perfumes (hsiang), > wine and beguilements (chiu, yu huo); in Chin and Northern Wei the mineral > mixtures (such as Han Shih San) were famous; Thang and Northern Sung people > consumed especially the alchemical elixirs (chin tan), generally mercurial > and often doubtless arsenical. Then in the Southern Sung came the regular > isolation of mixtures of steroid sex hormones (chiu shih, hung chhien), much > used in Yuan and Ming, while the Chhing afterwards succumbed to opium > (yaphien). (1974:289–290) While Chinese historians have traditionally believed the practice of consuming hanshisan persisted into the Tang dynasty and almost disappeared afterwards, Obringer (1995:219) thinks, \\"it may be more accurate to say that the name of the drug has been eclipsed, but not the habit of taking it.\\" Evidencing the disappearance of the name wushisan, Obringer compares parallel descriptions of exactly the same medical treatments and troubles for drug-using patients. The (752) Waitai biyao ( \\"Arcane Essentials from the Imperial Library\\"), compiled by Wang Tao (), quotes the rules for wushisan users; the (992) Taiping shenghui fang ( \\"Imperial Grace Formulary of the Taiping Era [976–983]\\") medical compendium, which does not mention wushisan or hanshisan, quotes them for rushi ( \\"stalactite and quartz\\") users. Song Dynasty During the Song Dynasty (960–1279) period, Englehardt (2008:473) says, \\"Cold-Food Powder was ethically condemned and became synonymous with a heterodox ideology and an immoral lifestyle. This may explain why the name of the drug was banned after the Tang, while the use of identical pharmaceutical drugs has continued under different names.\\" Su Shi's (1060) Dongpo zhilin (\\"Recollections of Su Dongpo\\", tr. Obringer 1995:218) exemplifies Song era moral condemnation of the drug: \\"The vogue for taking stalactite and aconite, for stooping to alcoholic and sexual debaucheries in order to obtain long life began in the times of He Yan. This person, in his youth, was wealthy and of noble birth: he took hanshisan to maintain his concupiscence. It is not surprising that the habit was sufficient to kill, day by day, himself and his clan.\\" Dikötter (2004:30) says that \\"From the Song onwards, mineral powders became more varied, including increasing quantities of medical herbs, ginger, ginseng and oyster extract, thus changing in character from alchemical substances to formal medicines (yao).\\" Ingredients Cinnabar (mercury sulfide), quartz (silicon dioxide), and dolomite crystals (calcium magnesium carbonate) from Hunan, China Orpiment (arsenic sulfide) from China Prepared realgar (arsenic sulphide) The precise components of hanshisan or wushisan are uncertain. Sailey describes the difficulties in identifying the ingredients. > The drug has not been made since the Tang; surely, if scholars believed they > could make it, they would have tried. Also, there is the problem that the > term chih 脂 (paste) implies the addition of other materials to make it > congeal, materials which are not identified. … Perhaps the greatest problem > of all, though, is the fact that drug-makers have traditionally guarded > their secrets well, and references to major ingredients by color lead the > reader to the inevitable conclusion that an esoteric formula is being used, > hinting at, rather than explicitly stating, the contents of the mixture. > (1978:425) Needham (1976:96) estimates \\"at least a half dozen\\" quite different ingredient lists, \\"all from authoritative sources.\\" The Baopuzi records two different lists of the Five Minerals (given below with literal meanings). Chapter 4 lists dansha ( lit. \\"red sand\\"), xionghuang ( \\"male yellow\\"), baifan ( lit. \\"white alum\\"), cengqing ( lit. \\"once green\\"), and cishi ( lit \\"compassionate stone\\", cf. ci \\"magnet\\"). English translations include: *cinnabar, realgar, pai-fan (synonymous with fan-shih , potash alum), malachite and tz'u-shih (magnetic iron ore, magnetite, black oxide of iron) (Feifel 1944, with footnotes added) *cinnabar, realgar, arsenolite, laminar malachite, and magnetite (Ware 1966:82) *cinnabar, realgar, purified potash alum, stratified malachite, and magnetite (Needham (1976:86) Needham translates baifan () as \\"purified potash alum\\" rather than \\"arsenolite\\". Chapter 17 lists xionghuang, dansha, cihuang ( lit. \\"female yellow\\"), fanshi ( lit. \\"alum stone\\"), and cengqing. *realgar, cinnabar, orpiment, alum, and laminar malachite (Ware 1966:294) Note the \\"male/female yellow\\" contrast between orange-red xionghuang ( \\"realgar\\") and yellow-red cihuang ( \\"orpiment\\"). Compared with chapter 4's list of the Five Minerals, this version rearranges three ingredients (cinnabar, realgar, and stratified malachite) and replaces two: baifan ( \\"arsenolite\\") with cihuang ( \\"orpiment\\") and cishi ( \\"magnetite\\") with the graphically similar fanshi ( \\"alum\\"). In traditional wuxing \\"five phases/elements\\" theory, the correlating wuse ( \\"five colors\\") are blue, yellow, red, white, and black (, and ). Needham says, > The [chapter 4] series cinnabar, realgar, alum, malachite and magnetite > would be most consonant with the colours (red, yellow, white, caerulean and > black) required in the traditional five-element symbolic correlations, so it > may have been one of the earliest. Yu shih ([] arsenolite), also white, > because of the similarity of its orthography, tended to get substituted for > fan shih ([] alum) but the latter is much more common in the alchemical > texts—here perhaps was a real pitfall for the unwary experimentalist. > (1976:96) Ingredients listed in the above Tang Dynasty Qianjin yifang (Obringer 1995:216) include \\" five mineral drugs (fluorine, quartz, red bole clay, stalactite and sulphur), one animal drug (shell of Cyclina sinensis) and nine plant drugs (Saposhnikovia divaricata, Trichosanthes kirilowii, Atractylodes macrocephala, Panax ginseng, Platycodon grandiflorus, Asarum sieboldii, Zingiber officinale, Cinnamomum cassia and Aconitum sp.). Besides giving this detailed hanshisan formula, the Qianjinfang ironically warns the toxicity \\"was so great that one was compelled to burn any record of its formula\\" (Obringer 1995:218). Mather (1976:20) translates the five mineral substances as: stalactite (shih-chung-ju []), sulphur (shih-liuhuang []), milky quartz (pai- shih-ying []), amethyst (tzu-shih-ying []), and red bole or ochre (ch'ih-shih- chih []).\\" Based upon numerous hanshisan recipes, Wagner's (1973:111–113) \\"Das Rezept des Ho Yen\\" lists 13 ingredients: First, 2.5 liang ( \\"tael\\") of six ingredients: zhongru ( \\"stalactite\\"), baishiying ( \\"milky quartz\\"), haige ( \\"oyster shell\\"), zishiying ( \\"amethyst\\"), fangfeng ( \\"Saposhnikovia divaricata\\"), and gualou ( \\"Trichosanthes kirilowii fruit\\"). Second, 1.5 liang of two: ganjiang ( \\"Zingiber officinale; dried ginger\\") and baishu ( \\"Atractylis ovata\\"). Third, 5 fen ( \\"candareen\\") of two ingredients: jiegeng ( \\"Platycodon grandiflorus; Chinese bellflower\\") and xixin ( \\"Asarum sieboldi; Chinese wild ginger\\"). Fourth, 3 fen of three: renshen ( \\"Panax ginseng; ginseng\\"), fuzi ( \\"Aconitum lycoctonum; monkshood\\"), and guixin ( \\"Cinnamomum cassia; cinnamon; cassia-bark tree\\"). Sailey (1978:425) criticizes a \\"number of difficulties\\" in Wagner's attempts to identify the drug's ingredients. Schipper (1993:180) summarizes Wagner's recipe as \\"stalactite milk and quartz, along with some realgar and orpiment, as well as a mixture of circulation- increasing medicinal plants like ginseng and ginger.\\" Some of these ingredients, such as Platycodon and cinnamon, are tonic and can be used medicinally. Other ingredients are highly toxic. Cinnabar is the ore for mercury. Realgar, orpiment, and arsenolite contain arsenic – but magnetite removes arsenic from water. Fluorine is highly reactive and poisonous. Aconitum can be lethal. The Dutch historian Frank Dikötter (2004:30) suggests, \\"Resembling fresh blood, the realgar was probably an early ingredient in alchemical attempts at creating an elixir of immortality.\\" Usage Chinese sources provide little reliable information about how hanshisan was prepared and used. > There are only a few discussions of the actual manner in which the drug was > taken. Apparently it was taken in three doses, sometimes with food. Numerous > sources mention that the drug was washed down with wine, sometimes heated, > sometimes cold. This undoubtedly was to heighten the effects of the drug, > but certainly, it must have made it more dangerous to the body. We are also > told that after consuming the drug, it was necessary to \\"circulate the > powder\\" (hsing-san ), that is, to move about so that the drug would > circulate in the bloodstream. (Sailey 1978:427) \\"Wine\\" is the common English translation of Chinese jiu ( \\"Chinese alcoholic beverages\\"), which inclusively means \\"beer\\", \\"wine, and \\"liquor\\". Sailey (1978:430) notes that early drugs certainly varied in purity and quality, and \\"this factor certainly must have influenced the effectiveness of han-shih san.\\" Effects Cold-Food Powder had both positive and negative effects, which could sometimes be incongruous, such as having \\"simultaneously tranquilizing and exhilarating properties\\" (Mather 1976:20). Obringer (1995:216–217) classifies 52 symptoms described by Huangfu Mi. *Pain: Various pains appeared very often, and occurred in almost every parts of the body: head, waist, heart, throat, extremities, arms and legs, skin, and eyes. *Digestive disorders: Swollen stomach, diarrhea, lack of appetite, constipation. *Urinary troubles: Strangury, frequent micturitions. *Fever symptoms: Fever, chills, sensation of cold with involuntary shivering. *Pulmonary disorders: qi (life-breath) back flow in the chest, coughing. *Sensorial troubles: These mainly concern eyes and vision: eye pain, sight trouble, dizzy spells, but also buzzing noise in the ears, and loss of smell. *Skin troubles: This category is very important. Two great groups are mentioned: the first consists of all kinds of \\"rottenness\\" of flesh; the second is the group of cutaneous disorders like abscesses, ulcers, especially on the legs and on the back. *Behavioural disorders: Huangfu Mi relates, in a one passage, his own experience of depression and suicidal tendencies after ingesting the drug. A trail of troubles like insomnia, anxiety, sadness, confusion, and fright are also described. *States of shock: Cases of dramatic troubles like loss of consciousness, stoppage of breath or falling into comatose states are said to occur sometimes after taking the powder. Obringer (1995:217) notes that acute or chronic arsenic poisoning can cause many of these symptoms: \\"abdominal pains, diarrhea, nasal and ocular congestion, cutaneous disorders, extremities pains, vision troubles (in relation, we know, with optical neuritis).\\" Sailey summarizes Yu Jiaxi's (1963:59) comprehensive Chinese-language analysis. > He stresses the idea that the effectiveness of the drug lay in its ability > to create warmth. If the taker went too far, he would catch a fever, while > if he cooled off too quickly, it would be extremely dangerous. Yu maintains > that the greatest danger would occur (1) if the drug was taken too often, > (2) if it was taken merely for stimulation and not to cure a serious > illness, or (3) if the heat entered the marrow. In the last case, Yu > believes, chronic illness and even death might result. In comparing the drug > to opium, he notes that it could create even more injurious effects, but he > conjectures that it was not addictive if taken twenty or thirty days apart. > Yu believes that the drug \\"caused death or at least chronic disease that in > the end could not be cured.\\" (1978:429) The Baopuzi translation of Jay Sailey (1978:428) notes that hanshisan had \\"different types of effects upon different types of people, and even to have affected the same person differently depending on his mood when he took the drug. In some cases it led to depression, suicide, or madness; in others it resulted in anger, lethargy, changes in appetite, or disregard of custom.\\" Sailey (1978:430) also says, \\"Having initially been used as a medicine to cure severe illnesses, its mind-expanding properties were apparently discovered and exploited during the mid-third century, which marked a high point in the development of all sorts of drugs and medicines made from organic and inorganic substances.\\" Schipper gives a detailed description of the powder's efficacies. > One of the immediate effects of this drug was a sharp elevation in the > body's temperature, forcing the user to drink a lot and to eat cold things; > hence its name. Among the beneficial effects of this drug, the most > frequently mentioned are sedation, an increase in aesthetic sensitivity, > vision, and sexual energy, and greater physical resistance. The drug may > also have been hallucinogenic. Aside from the immoderate rise in body > temperature, other disadvantages included a gradual decrease in intellectual > capacity, partial paralysis, aches and inflammation of the joints, ulcers, > intercostal pains, and, over time, a general deterioration of the body.

Lu Xun (1927:111, tr. Sailey 1978:424) claimed, \\"most of the famous men [of Wei-Chin] took drugs.\\" Based upon historical accounts of hanshisan users, scholars generally associate the drug with the scholar-gentry social class. However, Akahori Akira (1989:93) proposes an economic class distinction between users of the two popular drugs during the Three Kingdoms period. Only the \\"rich and powerful\\" could afford the rare Chinese alchemy ingredients for dan (丹 \\"cinnabar\\") elixirs of immortality – \\"Common folk instead took drugs that were easier to get, like cold-food powder (which, though actually less toxic, would cause a greater number of deaths).\\" In addition, Lu Xun compared the ingestion of hanshisan powder to opium addiction in China during the nineteenth century. During the Six Dynasties period, Chinese society was generally uncritical of hanshisan, which Sailey calls an \\"unexpected silence\\". > We hear scholars condemn the use of the drug only for two reasons: its > danger to health, and, as in the case of Ko Hung, its use during the > mourning period and at times when the taking of stimulants is inappropriate > or disrespectful. Use of drugs such as han-shih san was apparently never > regarded as illegal, immoral, or basically wrong. This \\"drug culture'\\" of > han-shih san apparently, as Wagner suggests, integrated itself into the > activities of wine-drinkers and skirt-chasers. Curiously, this may have led > to its demise by T'ang times, since it could not compete with presumably > less dangerous forms of entertainment. (1978:432) This refers to Ge Hong's Baopuzi above (26, tr. Sailey 1978:159–160) criticism of \\"noblemen\\" from Luoyang who violated mourning rules by taking wushisan and getting drunk. Ge, who praises many other drugs as integral to achieving xian immortality, only denounces this \\"powerful hallucinogenic\\" drug as contributing to the \\"decline of propriety and morality\\" and \\"disorder in society\\" (Sailey 1978:338). In addition, Sailey (1978:431) suggests that Southerners like Ge Hong opposed hanshisan because it probably originated in North China and was not widely used in the South until after the fall of Luoyang in 317. \\"Users of the drug comprised, at least in their own eyes, an elite group. This caused envy on the part of certain other people.\\" In Ge Hong's time, \\"there must have been an association between the drug on the one hand and the Northerners' image as occupiers who discriminated against the scholars of the South with regard to holding high office on the other.\\" The German sinologist Rudolf G. Wagner (1973, cited by Sailey 1978:431–432) speculated that hanshisan, which was associated with \\"greater mental awareness and perceptiveness\\", was used by some Chinese Buddhists. For instance, Huiyi (, 372–444) who infamously ingratiated himself with Emperor Wu of Liu Song and General Fan Tai. Audry Spiro proposes that wushisan transformed Chinese clothing fashions during the Wei-Jin period. > This temporary restorer of vitality had an important influence on fashions > of the day. To ensure efficacy and avoid negative effects, the user had to > consume heated wine and to exercise after taking it. The resulting fever > required the wearing of thin, loose clothing. Skin lesions, among the many > negative consequences of this drug (which may have contained arsenic), also > dictated the necessity for loose clothing. For the same reason, close- > fitting shoes or slippers that exacerbated the lesions could not be worn, > and they were replaced by clogs. It is obvious that the use of five-mineral > powder required a specific regimen, one clearly not appropriate for > attendance at court. Strolling in clogs and drinking wine, the wide robe > loosely belted—some men dressed and behaved this way because they took the > powder. Others of their class, eschewing the powder, nevertheless adopted > the lifestyle. It became, in short, the fashion. (1990:79–80) Using the drug powders was associated with Chinese poetry. Huang Junjie and Erik Zürcher (1995:256) say that when the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove took wushisan, \\"they had to drink cold liquor and take walking excursions in order to avoid arsenic poisoning. Intoxicated enchantment with nature's beauty led to their writing poems on landscape, and thus they initiated the genre of 'Nature Poetry'.\\" See also *Chinese alchemical elixir poisoning *List of traditional Chinese medicines *Realgar wine References        * * External links *Han Si, Tripsit.

Hanlon was an American stockbroker from Boston. Early life Hanlon was born in Boston, Massachusetts. He graduated from Suffolk Law School and Harvard Business School. He broke his leg skiing which kept him out of active military service during World War II. Business career Hanlon was proprietor and owner of Gordon B. Hanlon & Company, a securities broker dealer. On October 1, 1941, he purchased controlling interest of the Aldred Investment Trust at a public auction. Suffolk Downs On February 20, 1944, the Aldred Investment Trust purchased a majority of the voting stock in Eastern Racing Association, Inc, which operated Suffolk Downs. Hanlon was elected president of the Eastern Racing Association that same day. Hanlon purchased the track strictly for business reasons, not because he was interested in the sport. On May 19, 1944, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it had filed a complaint in federal court accusing Hanlon his fellow directors of the Aldred Investment Trust of gross abuse of the trust, including drastically changing the investment policy of the trust without giving adequate notice to security holders by purchasing stock in the Eastern Racing Association, keeping the trust insolvent since 1937, operating at a loss since 1939, and paying the directors large salaries. It asked the court to appoint a receiver to liquidate the trust's assets and distribute them to creditors. On January 19, 1945, Judge George Clinton Sweeney found Hanlon and five other Aldred officials guilty of gross abuse of the trust. On April 24, 1945, the Eastern Racing Association elected Allan J. Wilson to succeed Hanlon as track president, although he had not exercised any power since the receivers took over the trust. The track was sold to a group led by John C. Pappas at a public auction on May 1, 1946. Bannwart estate Hanlon served as the executor of the estate of Emilie T. Bannwart. Hanlon was to receive the bulk of the will after the death of Bannwart's brother.

Located for most of its history in the Erdington area of Birmingham, England, the college was originally independent but came under the control of Staffordshire education department in 1955 as part of a financial rescue deal. In 1975 it was taken over by Birmingham Polytechnic and renamed the Anstey Department of Physical Education. The Erdington premises remained in use until 1981, when the Anstey Department was transferred to the Edgbaston campus of the polytechnic, before being closed down in 1984. College history Anstey College, 1921: Greek DancingRhoda Anstey (1865–1936), the founder of the college, grew up on her family's farm near Tiverton, Devon, and later became a feminist, theosophist, astrologer and advocate of meditation. From 1893 to 1895 she attended the Hampstead Physical Training College for young women run by the physical education instructor and suffragette, Martina Bergman- Österberg. Bergman-Österberg's strict regime for her students included isolation and cold baths, and upon leaving in 1895 Anstey set up a health farm called The Hygienic Home for Ladies at South Petherton, Somerset. In 1897 she moved to The Leasowes, Halesowen, Worcestershire, and wrote to her former instructor, Bergman-Österberg, requesting that the latter accept Sophie Knight, Anstey's assistant at the health farm in Somerset, as a student at a reduced fee. Bergman-Österberg refused, so Anstey decided to train Knight herself, and established the Anstey Physical Training College at her new home, initially with just three students.Connecting Histories: Rhoda Anstey (1865–1936) In 1898 Anstey College hosted a meeting that would lead to the creation, the following year, of the Ling Association (later renamed the Physical Education Association of the United Kingdom), and in 1907 the college moved to new premises at Yew Tree House, Chester Road, Erdington, Birmingham, which would remain its home for nearly 75 years. Rhoda Anstey stepped down as principal in 1927, after having partially retired in 1920, though she remained a co-director until 1930, in which year the college gained the approval of the University of London to grant accredited diplomas. During the 1930s and 1940s Anstey College students represented England at many international events and exhibitions, and in 1947 the college changed its name to the Anstey College of Physical Education. In 1949 it became a founder member of the International Association of Physical Education and Sport for Girls and Women. By 1955, however, the college was in severe financial difficulties and in danger of closing. Staffordshire County Council agreed to fund the college and it became part of the county's education service. The college had 104 students by 1962, and was organising regular camps in Shropshire, as well as many other activities such as gymnastic and dance competitions in conjunction with other local colleges. By the late 1960s the college was awarding degrees accredited by the University of Birmingham, and had successfully resisted a proposed merger with the larger and co-educational Madeley College, based near Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, which would have entailed the closure of the Chester Road premises. In 1975 Anstey College, along with two other teacher training facilities in Birmingham, the Bordesley College of Education and the City of Birmingham College of Education, was incorporated into Birmingham Polytechnic (now Birmingham City University). The Chester Road premises continued in use as the Anstey Department of Physical Education until 1981, when its staff were transferred to the polytechnic's Edgbaston campus on Westbourne Road, becoming the Anstey School of Physical Education. The old college building was sold off and subsequently demolished to make way for a housing development, and the Anstey School at the polytechnic ceased to exist as a separate body in 1984. Alumnae The Anstey Old Students' Association (AOSA) was founded in 1911 by Rhoda Anstey during the Ling Christmas Course in London and became very active in holding reunions for former students, enabling them to remain in contact by supporting the college and other worthy causes. The association changed its name to the Anstey Association of Past and Present Students (AAPPS) in 1972, and again to the Anstey Association (AA) in 1984 when the Anstey School at Birmingham Polytechnic was closed. Subsequently, in addition to organising regular reunions and fundraising events, the association also helped administer the Anstey College archives kept in the Anstey Room, Ravensbury House, Westbourne Road (part of the polytechnic). The archives were transferred to Birmingham Central Library in 2005 (and later, in 2013, to the Library of Birmingham), but the association continues to hold regular events across the country.

It is a contraction of self-quenching. A squegging or self-blocking oscillator produces an intermittent or changing output signal. Wildlife tags for birds and little mammals use squegging oscillators. The Armstrong super-regenerative radio receiver uses a self- blocking oscillator, too. The receiver sensitivity rises while the oscillation builds up. The oscillation stops when the operation point no longer fulfills the Barkhausen stability criterion. The blocking oscillator recovers to the initial state and the cycle starts again. The receive frequency of the Armstrong Super-Regenerative receiver was some hundred kilohertz. The self- quenching frequency was ten kilohertz, just above the highest audio frequency the headphone could reproduce. Squegging is an oscillation that builds up and dies down with a much longer time constant than the fundamental frequency of the oscillation. A self-quenching oscillator circuit oscillates at two or more frequencies at the same time. Unwanted squegging In an audio amplifier, all forms of oscillation are generally unwanted. Poor design and layout can sometimes lead to squegging in such an amplifier. As always, this arises from a combination of high and low frequency oscillations. Poor layout or poor shielding leads to high-frequency oscillations where the output has been coupled back to the input, especially if the input and output cables are run together for a distance. The high-frequency oscillations cause heavy currents in the output stages and, with poor power supply decoupling, these upset the input stage biasing and disrupt the high frequency oscillations. Squegging then arises. Squegging in audio amplifiers is commonly called motorboating because it sounds in the loudspeaker like an outboard boat motor at low speed. A series resistor or a ferrite bead close to the gate or base connector of the active element reduces high frequency oscillations. Patents * * See also * AI Mk.

He also served briefly as a stamp distributor during the controversial Stamp Act 1765 protests and later fled Rhode Island after the Revolutionary War due to his Tory sympathies. Early life and career The Lucas-Johnston House in Newport was built by Johnston's grandfather in 1712 Johnston was born near Perth Amboy, New Jersey around 1729 to George Johnston and Bathsheba Lucas. His paternal grandfather emigrated from Scotland. Johnston's father died when he was young and his mother remarried to Matthew Robinson. Johnston was eventually educated in New York before moving to Newport, Rhode Island, where he became a voter on April 30, 1751. Johnston studied law with his step-father, Matthew Robinson, a prominent, well-read Rhode Island lawyer with a large private library. Johnston's maternal grandfather, Augustus Lucas, a French Huguenot also lived in Newport and built the Lucas-Johnston House, which Johnston later inherited. After building a successful reputation as an attorney, Augustus Johnston was appointed in 1754 and again in 1756 to assist in drafting legislation for General Assembly. In October 1756 Johnston became a first lieutenant in a military regiment to be sent against Fort Crown Point during the French and Indian War. In June 1757 he was acting as attorney-general because the candidate elected died, and he was then reelected each year until May 1766. As Attorney General he helped to revise the colony's laws and worked to start a smallpox inoculation hospital. When the town of Johnston separated from Providence in 1759, it was purportedly named for the Attorney General. Stamp Act and American Revolution In 1765, Johnston served as a stamp-distributor under the Stamp Act 1765. On August 27, 1765 Johnston and two others who had supported the rights of the Parliament of Great Britain were hanged in effigy and the next day a mob damaged their homes and rioted outside the Newport Colony House. The three individuals fled to a naval ship, , moored in Newport's harbor. Johnston came ashore the next day and signed a document agreeing not to act as stamp distributor without the colonists' consent. The other two refugees fled to England and requested compensation for their damages and informed the British government of their losses. Johnston also requested compensation, and all three were accused of inflating their claimed losses. The British Treasury requested that the Rhode Island General Assembly pay the claims, but the Rhode Island government refused until the British Treasury reimbursed Rhode Island for their expenditures during the French and Indian War in 1756, which had never been repaid. Negotiations over the claims took place until 1773 but were never settled. Augustus Johnston remained in Newport until July 18, 1776, but when he refused the Patriots' oath of allegiance he was ordered interned at South Kingstown for a time. During the British occupation of Newport, he was appointed to various civil positions, but he moved to New York when the British left Newport in 1779 and then possibly South Carolina. Johnston's property was eventually confiscated. Although he had a pension from the British government, Johnston died insolvent in 1790 leaving a widow and four children. Despite his advanced age, Johnston's step-father, who had been Johnston's surety, had to defend various suits which were brought against him.

It was formed in November 2013 as a corporate spin-off from Penn National Gaming. The company owns 44 casino properties, and operates two of them. History The company was created as a corporate spin-off from Penn National Gaming, effective November 1, 2013. The corporate breakup was designed to increase investor returns by taking advantage of the lack of federal income taxes on REITs. In November 2013, GLPI agreed to finance a proposed billion-dollar casino in Milford, Massachusetts, but the project was killed days later when town voters rejected the casino. In January 2014, the company acquired the real estate assets of the Casino Queen in East St. Louis, Illinois for $140 million, and leased them back to the casino's operating company for $14 million a year. GLPI also loaned $43 million to the casino. The company's Argosy Casino in Sioux City, Iowa was forced to close in July 2014, and GLPI then sold the casino's real estate. In May 2014, GLPI agreed to buy The Meadows Racetrack and Casino in western Pennsylvania from Cannery Casino Resorts for $465 million. The company said it would sell the facility's license to a third-party operator, while retaining ownership of the land and buildings. The deal ran into trouble, with GLPI filing a lawsuit accusing Cannery of fraud in October 2014; the lawsuit was eventually settled with an agreement on a reduced purchase price of $440 million. After casino operator Pinnacle Entertainment announced its own plan in November 2014 to spin-off a REIT with the real estate assets of its 15 casinos, GLPI approached Pinnacle with an offer to buy those assets, which it said would be simpler and faster than Pinnacle's plan. Pinnacle did not respond to the offer, so GLPI went public with its offer in March 2015. In July, the companies reached a deal for GLPI to buy 14 of Pinnacle's 15 properties for $4.75 billion in stock, and lease them back to Pinnacle, with rent starting at $377 million per year. The acquisition was completed in April 2016. GLPI also completed its purchase of The Meadows in September 2016 and sold the racetrack operation to Pinnacle for $138 million. In May 2015, GLPI agreed to finance the real estate portion of a proposed $650-million casino in New Bedford, Massachusetts, but the plan was canceled months later after developers failed to secure the rest of the needed funding. In May 2017, GLPI purchased the real estate assets of Bally's Casino Tunica and Resorts Casino Tunica for a total of $83 million, while Penn National simultaneously acquired their operating assets. In October 2018, the company acquired the real estate of five casinos from Tropicana Entertainment for $964 million. The purchase was part of a three-way deal in which Eldorado Resorts simultaneously acquired Tropicana's operating business and leased the casinos from GLPI for a total of $88 million per year. Weeks later, GLPI completed a four-way deal that saw its two largest tenants combine into one, as Penn National acquired Pinnacle. GLPI also gained a new tenant in Boyd Gaming, which purchased the operations of three of Pinnacle's leased properties. In connection with the merger, GLPI acquired the real estate of Plainridge Park Casino from Penn National for $250 million, and lent $58 million to Boyd to acquire the real estate of Belterra Park. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Penn faced the prospect of financial issues brought on by resort closures. As a result, Penn National Gaming sold the land occupied by the Tropicana Las Vegas to its spin-off company, Gaming and Leisure Properties. Penn sold the land for $337.5 million in rent credits, and the sale was finalized in April 2020. Penn will continue to operate the Tropicana for another two years, or until the resort and land are sold.

The Unio'n vun de Fräiheetsorganisatiounen or just Unio'n (Union of Freedom Organisations) was an organisation of members of the Luxembourgish Resistance which was founded in World War II. It emerged in March 1944 from the merger of the Luxembourgish Patriot League, the Luxembourgish People's Legion, the Luxembourgish Red Lion and other resistance movements, shortly before the end of the war in Luxembourg. In September 1944 the Luxembourgish Freedom Union also joined. It was the head of the Luxembourgish People's Legion, Lucien Dury, who contacted the other resistance movements in 1943 with a view to a merger. The resistance movements at the time had been weakened by raids and arrests by the Gestapo, and the goal was also to create a movement which could act as a representative body after the liberation. It was also planned that the organisation should, in creating a militia, contribute to maintaining order after the liberation. The Unio'n continued its existence after the war as an association, with the goal of keeping the memory of the active resistance in the years 1940-1945 alive. In 2011 it had about 150 members. In March 2011 the organisation had a memorial plaque put up outside the house in Bonnevoie where the Unio'n was founded.

It is used in beekeeping to give the bees a foundation on which they can build the honeycomb. Wax foundation is considered one of the most important inventions in modern beekeeping. History Foundation press in the Encyclopaedia Britannica (1911) Wax foundation was invented by German Johannes Mehring in 1857, a few years after Langstroth designed and patented the Langstroth hive on October 5, 1852. Mehring's wax foundation had only the bottom of the cells, and today's base with the foundation of the cells was invented by US beekeeper Samuel Wagner. The Langstroth patent did not call for foundation and let the bees build their own comb.US Patent # US9300A At first, wax foundations were made in the wax foundation press. The first presses were made of wood, while later presses could be made of plaster, cement, and finally metal, which are the ones used today. Wagner also invented the wax foundation rollers, but never perfected them; the first usable rollers were made by Amos Root and precise mechanic Alva Washburn in 1875. In 1895. Detroit inventor Edward Weed invented rollers that can make wax foundation in a continuous roll. Use Sheet of foundation out of a cardboard box Wax or plastic foundation is inserted into a wooden frame through the top and is usually connected to the side bars with wire. It is not used in foundationless frames or in plastic frames where the foundation is made of plastic and is part of the frame itself. Foundation is not usually used in top-bar applications (where no frames are used) such as Top Bar Hives or Warre Hives except sometimes as starter strips. Wax foundation has some advantages over letting bees build their own comb: * It provides a guide for bees to build straight comb. Without foundation, the beekeeper runs the risk of having comb built outside the Hive frame when they start, preventing its easy removal for inspection. * Foundation built comb is usually stronger in part due to the wiring embedded in the wax. This allows for centrifuge extraction. * Foundation allows beekeepers to increase the size of the cells on the honeycomb. By stamping bigger cells on the foundation than what bees would naturally build, the beekeeper is guiding bees to build bigger cells, increasing the size of worker bees as well as the volume of the cells for honey storage. Most foundation being stamped with cells measuring while the naturally built worker cell measures to that leads to an increase of a linear increase of 110% of the original size and a volume increase of 157% of the original size.Natural Cell Size - Michael Bush - Bush Farms http://www.bushfarms.com/beesnaturalcell.htm For these reasons, foundation had been used extensively in commercial operations. Recently there has been a large movement toward foundationless beekeeping by hobbyists for various reasons. Some of which are listed below: * Varroa: With the expansion of Varroa destructor around the world, some believe that natural cell size helps bees combat this pest. Cutting out drone cells is also an effective way in an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) plan to fight varroa.Scientific Beekeeping - Fighting Varroa - http://scientificbeekeeping.com/fighting-varroa- biotechnical-tactics-ii/ * Chemicals in the wax: Most beekeepers purchase their foundation from beekeeping suppliers. In addition to honey, beekeepers also need pollen and nectar from their colonies. Honey contains vitamins and other valuable nutrients for bees. The cost of honey, including beeswax, is variable depending on how many of these components are used and where they are purchased. The price of honey, with a wide range of beekeepers' items, is also variable. These suppliers manufacture these sheets of foundation with wax purchased from various beekeeping operations which may have used chemicals or worked near fields where chemicals were sprayed. With an increase awareness for pesticides and their impact on bees as well as the organic and natural beekeeping movements, some beekeepers are concerned with the traceability of the wax used.Bee Culture - Ditch the foundation - http://www.beeculture.com/ditch-the-foundation/Beekeeping Like a Girl - Why Try Foundationless Beekeeping http://beekeepinglikeagirl.com/why-try- foundationless-beekeeping/ * Cost and/or time: The foundation needs to be manufactured. The beekeeper can make it or purchase it and this leads to him or her spending time and or money on foundation or equipment to manufacture it. * Natural Cell size: Comb is not uniform. Natural worker cells range from to and Drone cells range from to . This means that the bees have to adapt the foundation to build drone cells. With the advance in research, the importance of drones being present in the hive had led some beekeepers to let the bees built their own comb in the spirit of natural beekeeping. * Production of raw honeycomb: Since the comb will be cut out, it is easier to not have any wires in the comb. It is also better to not have chemicals (pesticides) in the wax if it is going to be used for human consumption. A frame has to be wired so that the wax foundation could be inserted into it. The foundation is then soldered with the wire by using a spur embedder or electric current. Also extant are wax foundations with embedded wire that only need to be inserted into the frame. Wax foundations are made in various sizes, depending on the frame they will be inserted into. If needed, roller knife is used to cut wax foundations.

The Galaxy Express 2 can access and play traditional media formats such as music, movies, TV programs, audiobooks, and podcasts, and can sort its media library alphabetically by song title, artist, album, playlist, folder, and genre. It also includes Samsung's own proprietary music management and download application called \\"Music Hub\\", designed to compete with Apple's iTunes, iCloud, and iTunes Match services. Music Hub's music catalogue contains over 19 million songs. The phone enables video calling with its 0.3 MP front-facing camera, and with support for the aptX codec, improves Bluetooth-headset connectivity. Texting on the Galaxy Express 2 does not embody any new significant features from other Samsung Galaxy devices. Speech-to-text is aided by the Vlingo and Google's voice-recognition assistant. Not unlike other Android devices, there are a multitude of third- party typing applications available that could complement the Galaxy Express 2's stock keyboard. Hardware and design The Galaxy Express 2 has a polycarbonate plastic chassis measuring long, wide, and thick, with the device weighing . Internally, the Galaxy Express 2 uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 400 SoC featuring a dual-core 1.7 GHz Krait CPU and an Adreno 305 GPU. The Galaxy Express 2 has 1.5 GB of RAM which comes with 8 GB of internal storage, with a 64 GB version to be available internationally; additionally, microSDXC storage offers a further 64 GB for a potential total of 72 GB. The Galaxy Express 2's PLS TFT LCD display measures which comes with a 540x960-pixel resolution with a 245 pixel per inch (PPI, a measure of pixel density). The Galaxy Express 2 has a 5-megapixel camera which can take 2,592x1,944 resolution photos and record videos in (720p) resolution. Samsung improved the camera's software over that of its predecessor to include zero shutter lag, and Burst Mode and Best Shot, which work together to quickly take numerous photos before the best-judged frame is selected. The phone can also take pictures while recording videos. The rear-facing camera is complemented by a 0.3-megapixel front-facing camera. The phone has LED flash and autofocus. In addition to the touchscreen, the Galaxy Express 2 has several physical user inputs, including a home button located below the screen, a volume key on the left side and a power/lock key on the right. At the top there is a TRRS headphone jack and one of the two microphones on the Galaxy Express 2; the other is located below the home button. The Galaxy Express 2's li-ion 2,100 mAh battery is said to have a 581-hour standby time or 11 hours of talk time on 3G, compared to 586 hours in standby and 19 hours of talk time on 2G. Built into the battery is near field communication connectivity, which allows users to share map directions and YouTube videos quickly using Wi-Fi Direct (through Android Beam), and perform non-touch payments at shops that employ specially equipped NFC cash registers. To help minimize battery consumption, Samsung has introduced \\"Smart Stay\\", an ability to track a user's eyes and turn off whenever the person is not looking at it. The battery can be wirelessly charged using a special charging pad (sold separately) that utilizes magnetic resonance to produce a magnetic field through which electricity could be transferred.

Results During this first congress, the Kuomintang's reorganization process to become the Kuomintang of China () in 1919 from the previous Chinese Revolutionary Party was formally completed. A policy declaration was also drafted to fight against imperialism and feudalism, determining three policies of alliance with Soviet Union and alliance with the Communist Party of China. This first congress eventually led to the reunification of China four years later after the Northern Expedition. As time progressed, the Chinese Kuomintang (KMT) lost its grip on China and after its defeat on the Chinese mainland, the party retreated to Taiwan. From 1950 to 1952, the KMT underwent a thorough organizational restructuring. The result was a renewal of its Leninist origins from the previous reorganization in 1924.a. Dickson, B. J. (1993).

However, as the 2004 election unfolded, many forecast its triumphant return. The party pursued a reform strategy before forging a pact with like-minded parties, and reestablished its leadership among the alliance of political opposition parties. The party itself however, is still going through an identity crisis and is struggling to maintain a foothold in the political format of China.

When he moved to Mashhad, the Islamic seminary of Mashhad flourished. He contributed to the establishment of many Islamic seminary schools across Iran, as well as focused on a lot of Islamic propagation. After the death of Hossein Borujerdi in 1961, al-Milani was considered to be among Iran's leading grand Ayatollahs, besides Muhammad-Kazim Shariatmadari and Ruhollah Khomeini. He also taught Iran's current supreme leader, Ali Khamenei.  Lineage  al-Milani was born to a prominent religious family, that emigrated from Medina, and settled in Milan in the 14th century. al-Milani's great ancestor was Ali al-Asghar, the son of the fourth Shia Imam, Ali Zayn al-Abideen. His lineage is as follows: > Muḥammad-Hādi bin Jaʿfar bin Aḥmed bin Murtadha bin ʿAli Akbar bin Asadallāh > bin Abu al-Qāsim bin Ḥusayn al-Madani bin ʿUbayd bin Musa bin Aḥmed bin > Muḥammad bin Aḥmed bin Musa bin Shihāb al-Dīn bin ʿAli bin Aḥmed bin ʿAli > bin Aḥmed bin Muḥammad bin Muḥammad bin al-Ḥasan bin ʿAli bin Ḥusayn bin > Zaid bin ʿAli bin Muḥammad bin ʿAbdallāh bin al-Ḥasan al-Afṭas bin ʿAli al- > Asghar bin ʿAli al-Sajjad bin Ḥusayn al-Shahid bin ʿAli Ibna Abi Talib.  Early life and education = Early life  al-Milani was born to Sayyid Jafar al-Milani (d. 1907) and Bibi Khanum Mamaqani, in Najaf. Both of his parents were ulama. He was the eldest of three sons and three daughters. Both of his brothers, Musa al-Milani and Kadhim al-Milani were merchants. His father died when he was sixteen years old, and al-Milani was taken in by his uncle and to-be father-in-law Sheikh Abdallah Mamaqani.  Education  al- Milani grew up in Najaf and was educated in its seminary. He studied under scholars like Mirza al-Hamadani, Sheikh Hasan Tabrizi and Sheikh Ali al- Irawani. He studied philosophy under Sheikh Husayn Badkubehi and Sheikh Muhammad-Hassan al-Gharawi. He studied akhlaq under Sayyid Ali al-Qadhi and Abd al-Ghafar al-Mazindrani. He studied debate and Quranic exegesis under Sheikh Muhammad-Jawad al-Balaghi. He studied the dissertation in advanced seminars under Sheikh Dhiya al-Din al-Iraqi. He was invited to reside in Karbala at the invitation of Hossein Tabatabaei Qomi, and so he moved there in 1936, and remained there for just under two decades. After the death of Qomi in 1947, al-Milani, alongside Mirza Mahdi al-Shirazi and Mirza Muhammad-Hadi al-Khurasani, were considered the highest ranking jurists in Karbala. He was granted ijaza of ruwaya (narrating) from Sayyid Hasan al-Sadr, Abd al-Husayn Sharaf al-Din, Abbas al-Qomi and Agha Buzurq al-Tehrani.  Travel to Mashhad  In 1953, he travelled to Mashhad, to visit the Imam Ridha shrine. He then decided to remain in Mashhad, at the request of its notable religious figures, who gathered and signed a petition for this. After moving to Mashhad, he became the head of the religious seminary and the Imam of the Goharshad mosque inside the shrine. al-Milani founded numerous Islamic schools, such as the Haqqani Seminary and Imam al-Sadiq Seminary. He revolutionised the structure and organisation of the seminaries and introduced new training programmes. Propagation of religious teachings were of utmost importance for al-Milani, and so he would send his students as missionaries to different areas, cities and villages across Iran. There were approximately four hundred advanced students of the seminary who had attended his lectures. al-Milani sponsored Islamic institutes and organisations that did not just belong to the Shia seminaries, such as the Center for the Propagation of Islamic Truths which contributed to the propagation of modern Islamic thoughts and responses to objections, made by anti-Islamic movements, that were popular among the educated class of Mashhad at the time, from the 1940s to the 1970s.  Political Activism  al-Milani was active during the Iraqi revolt against British presence, in 1920. In Iran, he was active in the 1963 demonstrations in Qom, pioneering the clerical movement, and harshly criticised the Shah for his murderous actions. al-Milani supported Khomeini during the capitulation treaty in 1964, supporting the sentiment that the treaty was “a document pointing to the slavery of the Iranian nation”. In 1967, he published a statement regarding the six-day war between the Arab nations and Israel. In this statement, he sympathised with the Muslim Arabs, and because of this, he was threatened by General Nassiri. In the same year, his passport was confiscated and he was ordered to leave Iran because he did not congratulate the Shah for his coronation, but the decision was not executed because of al- Milani's spiritual influence among people and his place among Shiite clergies and authorities.  Personal life  al-Milani was married to two women. His first marriage was to his cousin, the daughter of Sheikh Abdallah al-Mamaqani, and from her he had two sons (Nur al-Din and Abbas) and one daughter. His wife was highly attached to Najaf, and when al-Milani moved to Mashhad, she remained. al-Milani's second marriage was to the daughter of Sayyid Hasan al- Musawi al-Jazayeri. From her he had one son (Muhammad-Ali).  Works and students  al-Milani has a number of publications including: * Qadatona Kayfa Na'rifahum (Our Leaders, How We Know Them) * Tafsir Surat al-Jum'a wa al- Taghabun (Exgesis of al-Juma and al-Taghabun Quranic Chapters) * Mi'at Wa Ashr As'ila (A Hundred and Ten Questions) * Hashiya Ala al-Urwat al-Withqa (A Brief Notation of the Indissoluble Link) * Mukhtasar al-Ahkam (Religious Laws in Brief) His most notable students were: * Sheikh al-Wahid al-Khurasani * Sheikh Muhammad-Ridha al-Mothafar * Sayyid Yusuf al-Hakim * Sayyid Ibrahim Alam al- Huda * Sayyid Ali Khamenei  See also  * Bibi Khanum *Mohammad Hasan Mamaqani * Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari *Ali Khamenei  References  Category:1892 births Category:1975 deaths Category:Iranian ayatollahs Category:Al-Husayni family Category:People from Najaf Category:Iranian expatriates in the Ottoman Empire Category:Founders of educational institutions Category:Iranian philanthropists Category:20th-century Iranian people Category:Iraqi people of Iranian descent ","title":"Mohammad Hadi al-Milani"},{"id":"41017951","text":"Fluorescent microscopy image of peptoid nanosheets viewed using Nile Red dye. In nanobiotechnology, a peptoid nanosheet is a synthetic protein structure made from peptoids. Peptoid nanosheets have a thickness of about three nanometers and a length of up to 100 micrometers, meaning that they have a two-dimensional, flat shape that resembles paper on the nanoscale.Nam, K.T., Shelby, S.A., Choi, P.H., Marciel, A.B., Chen, R., Tan, L., Chu, T.K., Mesch, R.A., Lee, B., Connolly, M.D., Kisielowski, C., Zuckermann, R.N. “Free- floating ultrathin two-dimensional crystals from sequence-specific peptoid polymers” Nat. Mater. 9(5), 464-460 (2010). This makes them one of the thinnest known two-dimensional organic crystalline materials with an area to thickness ratio of greater than 109 nm. Peptoid nanosheets were discovered in the laboratory of Dr. Ron Zuckermann at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in 2010. Due to the ability to customize peptoids and therefore the properties of the peptoid nanosheet, it has possible applications in the areas of drug and small molecule delivery and biosensing. Synthesis For assembly, a purified amphiphilic polypeptoid of specific sequence is dissolved in aqueous solution.Kudirka, R., Tran, H., Sanii, B., Nam, K.T., Choi, P.H., Venkateswaran, N., Chen, R., Whitelam, S., Zuckermann, R.N. “Folding of a single-chain, information-rich polypeptoid sequence into a highly ordered nanosheet” Pept. Sci. 96, 586-595 (2011). These form a monolayer (Langmuir–Blodgett film) on the air-water interface with their hydrophobic side chains oriented in air and hydrophilic side chains in the water. When this mono-layer is shrunk, it buckles into a bilayer with the hydrophobic groups forming the interior core of the peptoid nanosheet.Sanii, B., Kudirka, R., Cho, A., Venkateswaran, N., Olivier, G.K., Olson, A.M., Tran, H., Harada, R.M., Tan, L., Zuckermann, R.N. “Shaken, not stirred: collapsing a peptoid monolayer to produce free-floating, stable nanosheets” J. Am. Chem. Soc. 133, 20808–20815 (2011). This method has been standardized in the Zuckermann laboratory by repetitively tilting vials of peptoid solution at 85° before returning the vials to the upright position. This repetitive vial “rocking” motion lessens the interfacial area of the air-water interface inside the vial, compressing the peptoid mono-layer by a factor of four and causing the mono-layer to buckle into peptoid nanosheets. Using this method, nanosheets are produced in high yield, and 95% of the peptoid polymer starting material is efficiently converted into peptoid nanosheets after rocking the vials several hundred times. Applications Peptoid nanosheets have a very high surface area, which can be readily functionalized to serve as a platform for sensing and templating.Olivier, G.K.; Cho, A.; Sanii, B.; Connolly, M.D.; Tran, H.; Zuckermann, R.N. \\"Antibody-mimetic peptoid nanosheets for molecular recognition\\" ACS Nano. 7, 9276-9386, (2013). Also, their hydrophobic interiors can accommodate hydrophobic small molecule cargos, which have been demonstrated by the sequestration of Nile red when this dye was injected into an aqueous solution of the peptoid nanosheets.Tran, H., Gael, S.L., Connolly, M.D., Zuckermann, R.N. “Solid-phase submonomer synthesis of peptoid polymers and their self-assemble into highly-ordered nanosheets” J. Vis. Exp. 57, e3373, (2011). For these reasons, the hydrophobic interior of the 2D nanosheets could be an attractive platform for loading or embedding hydrophobic cargo, such as drug molecules, fluorophores, aromatic compounds, and metal nanoparticles.

It is believed that the Christ's Hospital school in London in 1552 was the first school to use a uniform for its students.see The earliest documented proof of institutionalised use of a standard academic dress dates back to 1222 when the Archbishop of Canterbury ordered the wearing of the cappa clausa. The practice of wearing school uniform has been adopted by many other countries, and is now common in many parts of the world. Uniforms can be regarded as promoting social equality among students and an esprit de corps, but have also been criticised for promoting a form of uniformity characteristic of militarism. The decision as to whether to implement school uniform policy or not is a controversial one and also polarised in societies and countries. In countries such as the United Kingdom, South Africa and a number of Asian nations, school children have to wear approved school uniforms that conform to the uniform policy of their school. In modern Europe, Britain, Malta and Ireland stand out as the only countries where school uniform is widely adopted by state schools and generally supported by national and local governments, although there is no legislation governing school uniform in the U.K. There are some independent schools and state schools that do not have school uniforms: their pupils are at liberty to dress in a way considered to be appropriate by the school, themselves and their parents or guardians.  Australia  Barack Obama with students at an Australian high school in 2011. In Australia, each school or school system can set its own uniform policy. Wearing a uniform is compulsory in most Australian private and all Catholic schools, as well as in most public schools, although it is sometimes less enforced in primary schools that have uniforms. Uniforms usually have a color scheme based on the school colors. Uniform and appearance are generally strictly enforced in private and Catholic schools, though less so in public schools, which generally allow their students a reasonable amount of leeway. Most, if not all, private schools have the school logo incorporated in the uniform ensemble, typically on the necktie and the blazer breast pocket. For boys, the uniforms generally include a button-up or polo shirt with either shorts (especially for summer wear) or long trousers, usually in grey or navy blue or the school color. Some schools allow boys to wear shorts only in younger years, and they must wear long trousers once they are a senior (17-18). At others, even older boys wear shorts in summer due to the heat.See e.g. School uniform price list making a distinction between summer uniform and winter uniform. Where short trousers are to be worn, socks in school colors (more commonly white) are often required. Girls' uniforms generally include a checkered or striped dress (usually sleeveless or short-sleeved) worn over a blouse for summer and, in most secondary schools, girls wear a skirt as well as a button-up or polo shirt in winter with a blazer and tie. In a number of schools, girls are also permitted to wear a button-up or polo shirt and dark trousers. In public schools, the uniform is usually a polo shirt for juniors and a different one for seniors and trousers or skirt. This set may be complemented by a school necktie and, typically, a v-neck jumper (pullover or sweater) or a blazer. In the summer, boys usually do not wear ties, pullovers, or blazers. Instead, they wear a short-sleeved version of the shirt and short trousers. A neck-tie, blazer, and hat are also common in private and Catholic schools. In most high schools a PE uniform is the norm for sports days only. At many high schools, children are required to change into and out of their PE uniform around the PE lesson. The PE uniform usually consists of shorts and a polo shirt, as well as a light weatherproof rain jacket (mainly at private or Catholic schools), usually made of polyester, for winter and wet weather and sometimes a netball skirt for girls. It is common for students in their final year of primary school or secondary school to have their own jersey, jumper or jacket to denote their final-year status.  Bangladesh  School uniforms are mandatory in all public and private schools (up to 12th standard) in Bangladesh. While the color and exact cut of the uniform depend on school regulations and policies, male students in Bangladesh are usually expected to wear full/half sleeve shirts with trousers and female students are expected to wear skirts/pants with shirts or salwar kameez with belts and dupattas. The uniform rule only applies to students of primary, secondary, and higher secondary education. Although there are no uniforms for university students in Bangladesh, they are expected to follow the respective dress codes of their institutions. The rationale behind the uniform policy of Bangladesh is that the authorities want to protect the students from class stratification that can become apparent when students are given the choice to dress as they like. In addition, authorities believe that students should not misuse their time in trying to dress up for school.  Brazil  There is no legal requirement for school uniforms in Brazil. On a state-by-state or city-by-city basis, governments may issue uniforms to public school pupils but may not require their use. Private schools are free to set their own uniform policy. Brazilian school uniforms can vary widely by school. There are many schools that opt for a more elegant outfit, while others opt for a simpler one (social shirt, shorts). In this country, where schools have set a uniform, it is the student's obligation to wear it. Most schools in Brazil choose the use of uniforms. The average Brazilian school uniform for boys is a T-shirt with the school's logo, sweatpants or Bermuda shorts and a sweatshirt or hoodie. The uniform for girls is very similar, but instead leggings or short shorts are worn, although ballerina pants are also popular. Girls may also wear mini- skirts/skirts. Most schools require sneakers.  Burundi  School uniforms are compulsory for school children in Burundi. Burundi, like most African countries, has a compulsory school uniform policy. Burundi's school uniform policy dates back to the colonial days. During those days, chiefs' sons wore a white uniform and all other children wore khaki. The uniform policy is still in force in Burundi to date. However, schools decide on what uniform the pupils wear. It is also argued that the cost of buying the school uniform and poverty, especially in the rural areas, negatively affect school enrollment.  Cambodia  School children wearing uniforms in Cambodia In Cambodia, students of all ages (pre-school to college) wear school uniforms. The uniforms differ by school and age level. Generally, boys wear a white dress shirt and a pair of shorts. The color and length of the shorts varies at each school. Male college students wear the same kind of uniform, but instead of shorts, they wear black dress trousers. Girls usually wear white blouses and a skirt. Their skirts vary in color and length depending upon the school and their ages. Generally, the younger students wear long skirts that almost reach their ankles and older students, particularly in college, wear shorter ones. Skirts are generally blue or black but may be other colors as well, depending on the school. Some schools also have alternative uniforms which students of both genders wear every other day. These often consist of a colored shirt and slacks. High school girls must wear black or blue long skirts. High school boys wear long black or blue trousers. The white shirt can be short-sleeved or long-sleeved for both genders. High school students are also required to wear name tags on the left hand side of their shirts. Canada High school uniforms on sale at a warehouse store in Montreal, Quebec. In Canada, the province of Quebec is the only province where school uniforms are present in a majority of schools. Within the English school system of Quebec, almost all schools from elementary to high school have mandatory school uniforms. In the rest of Canada, school uniforms are not required in most public schools or separate schools, except in exceptional circumstances such as school performances or international field trips. However, the majority of Catholic high schools in southern Ontario (Grade 9-12) do require uniforms. These uniforms generally have long- or short-sleeved shirts with the school logo or crest near the collar and trousers or kilted skirts. Schools often allow girls the option of choosing to wear a skirt or trousers. Some schools also mandate dress shoes and a particular type and length of socks to go with the uniform. A cardigan sweater, vest, or blazer may be part of the ensemble, particularly in winter. Additionally, as of 2011, the Toronto Catholic District School Board has implemented an Appropriate Dress Code of navy blue and white in all elementary separate schools which do not already have their own uniforms. Otherwise, specific regulations and policies regarding school-appropriate dress and the extent of dress code enforcement will vary by school. Uniforms are used in most private schools, and also in special or alternative programs of public and Catholic schools, such as the Traditional Learning Centers, a program that takes a liberal arts approach, while focusing on high levels of academic excellence. In Quebec, most metropolitan anglophone school boards require a uniform.  Chile  In Chile, most schools have a uniform. Until 1930, it was uncommon for students to wear a uniform. Under the government of Carlos Ibáñez del Campo, all students became obliged to wear a school uniform. During the administration of Eduardo Frei Montalva, a unified uniform was introduced for all public and private schools and other education centers. Today, these uniforms have disappeared in private schools, who prefer to use a customised one.  China  Chinese high school students in their summer school uniforms. Uniforms are a common part of the schools in China. Almost all secondary schools as well as some elementary schools require students to wear uniforms. Uniforms in mainland China usually consist of five sets: 2 formal sets and 3 everyday sets. A formal set is worn on Mondays or special occasions (school anniversaries, school ceremonies, etc.) They consist of a white collared shirt with a sweater on top and a skirt for girls or a suit for boys. There is one formal set for summer and one set for winter. Everyday uniforms for boys in the winter usually consist of a zippered sweater and trousers and a collared shirt (usually white). Thinner materials are worn in the spring and fall and short or long trousers may be worn in the summer. The everyday uniforms for girls are very similar to the boys' uniform. It is relatively common for there to be some kind of sponsored advertisement on some non-formal school uniform shirts, though this trend has fluctuated in recent years.  Colombia  Colombian primary school students with their teacher. In Colombia, all students are required to wear uniforms in public and private schools. Uniforms in Colombia consist of two sets, one for everyday use and a sports one for physical education. Everyday uniforms for girls generally include a knee-length skirt, a white T-shirt with a vest, and white calf- length socks. For boys, the uniform generally includes dark-colored long trousers and a short- or long-sleeved shirt. The shoes for both girls and boys are black lace-up shoes (sometimes the shoes may be dark blue or wine-colored, depending on the uniform colors) and the shirts usually have the school's symbol at the left side. The sports uniform includes sweat pants, a collared T-shirt, and white sports shoes. The designs and the colors of the uniforms depend on the school's colors and the principal's preference.  El Salvador  Salvadoran school students celebrating independence day In El Salvador, all students from public schools and private schools are required to wear uniforms.  France  Uniforms have not been enforced in French schools, a few exceptions (such as Maison d'éducation de la Légion d'honneur, les Écoles TUNON, and Vatel). Xavier Darcos, a former teacher and Minister of Education from 2007 to 2009, is an advocate of the reintroduction of uniforms: \\"This is not outrageous. This removes the visible differences in social status or wealth. This is an additional factor of integration\\". Since March 2012, the students of the Boarding School of Excellence Sourdun wear a uniform with the insignia of their establishment. Les lycées de la défense, formerly known as military schools, require their students to wear uniforms. At some universities, the academic dress is becoming popular. In the French Antilles (Martinique and Guadeloupe), as well as French Guiana, a uniform has been required since September 2008.  Germany  German school children wearing voluntary \\"Schulkleidung\\" (2009). There is no tradition of wearing school uniforms in Germany, and today, almost all students of state schools, private schools or universities do not wear school uniforms. However, certain garments have been common to students in former times: From the 16th century, students (especially of secondary or grammar schools and similar institutions) were often subject to regulations that prescribed, for example, modest and not too stylish attire. In many cases these regulations were part of wider laws concerning the clothing of all citizens of certain social classes. A blue coat became a widespread obligatory status symbol of students of secondary schools; it fell out of use during the latter half of the 18th century. In more recent times, school uniforms in any real sense did not exist outside of convent schools and private boarding schools. At times, certain fashions became so widespread that they approached uniform status; this is true in particular for so-called student hats (Schülermützen) that became widespread from the 1880s on and remained somewhat popular until they were banned by the Nazis. Their wearing was advocated by teachers and the students themselves and occasionally made mandatory, but never on a national or statewide level. Another instance are the sailor suits that became fashionable around the turn of the 19th century. These, too, were not usually a prescribed uniform. The Nazis banned student hats – the last remaining, if voluntary, form of unified student clothing – because they considered them an attribute of class society. They did, however, institute mandatory membership in the uniformed Hitler Youth (HJ) from 1936 until their fall. HJ uniforms were worn in the HJ training academies and in the Napolas; students of other schools sometimes wore them to school at their own discretion. In recent times, the introduction of school uniforms has been discussed, but usually the expression \\"uniform\\" (the word is the same in German) is avoided in favor of terms like \\"school clothing\\" (\\"Schulkleidung\\"). School clothing has been introduced in a small number of schools, for example in Hamburg-Sinstorf in 2000, and in Friesenheim and Haag (Oberbayern) in 2005. In these cases the clothes are collections of shirts, sweaters, and the like, catering to contemporary fashion senses. Uniforms in a more traditional sense are almost never proposed in earnest. The debate on mandatory school uniforms intensified in Germany when two Muslim girls dressed in burkas arrived at a school in Bonn in 2006. The girls' actions were interpreted as political action and they were subsequently suspended from school. Then-Justice Minister Brigitte Zypries in an interview with the Welt am Sonntag stated that the simple solution to the issue under consideration is mandatory introduction of school uniforms for boys and girls across Germany. She further argued that school uniforms would help to prevent conflicts arising from religious or political differences. Her stance was supported by then-Minister Of Education Annette Schavan. The proposal was met with opposition from the teacher union and opposition political parties. The teacher union argued that school uniforms are not the solution for integration problems nor the issue of fashion obsession. The leader of the teacher union Heinz-Peter Meidinger also added that the school uniforms have been a controversial issue in Germany over the years. Opposition to school uniforms A senior member of the Green Party, Krista Sager, also said that the introduction of school uniforms would be unacceptable state interference in religious matters. She then proposed that individual schools have to find their own solutions and rejected solutions imposed by government. She further noted that school uniforms are no longer up to date and their imposition would be rejected by the current generation of students. The Conference of Education Ministers, a body which decides on school policies, also kicked back against school uniforms. They cited historical reasons dating back to WWII with memories of Hitler Youth's uniform still fresh in people's minds. They also concluded that the imposition of school uniforms would be excessive government encroachment on personal liberty of pupils and parents. However, a number of schools sell branded clothing that can be worn as a sign of school pride. The Bildungsstreik movement fights against school uniforms due to their belief that it represents some kind of militarism.  Ghana  Students in Ghana wearing their uniform All children have to wear school uniforms in Ghana. Pupils in public schools have the same type of school uniform with the school's emblem imprinted on the left chest. This helps to distinguish pupils of one school from the other. Private schools determine which uniforms their pupils wear. On April 11 2019, the Director-General of the Ghana Education Service, Prof Kwasi Opoku Amankwa announced at a press conference in Accra that public Junior High School pupils will start wearing a new uniform beginning from the 2019-2020 academic year. The new uniform is primarily to distinguish the Junior High pupils from their peers at the primary level. The current brown and yellow khaki school uniform, locally referred to as Konkonte and nkate nkwan (groundnut soup) and worn by pupils at the basic level in public schools, was introduced over 30 years ago by the government.  Hong Kong  Cheongsam as School Uniform. Note- uniform is plain - markings are signatures of owner's classmates. The vast majority of schools in the former British colony adopted uniforms similar to that of British schools, while Catholic schools in Hong Kong usually follow the tradition of Catholic school uniforms. A number of older Christian girls' schools established around the midpoint of the 20th century, however, retain the heritage of using the Chinese cheongsam as their uniform, such as St. Stephen's Girls' College, True Light Middle School, Ying Wa Girls' School, and Heep Yunn School. Sailor suits are also used as uniforms in some kindergartens for boys and girls, and secondary schools but for girls only, for example the Bishop Hall Jubilee School and New Method College. St Paul's Girls' College, now St Paul's Co- educational College, introduced a cheongsam as its uniform in 1918, making it Hong Kong's first school uniform. True Light Girls' College was the first Hong Kong secondary school to have a cheongsam uniform. While Hong Kong campuses of British public schools use hats for reasons of tradition, most Hong Kong schools have no hats in their uniforms.  India  Indian school students in their summer uniform Uniforms are compulsory in India in both public and private schools. The boys' uniforms are often made of a light-colored shirt, long trousers usually blue, white or black, and those of the girls are often a shirt and a skirt. At the state level, the secondary schools are required to use a salwar kameez. This is not compulsory but they do have certain specific dress code. Many schools require students to wear uniform shoes, ties and ID cards, and comb their hair down and keep it clean and short. Long hair is tied in braids. Uniform is one of the most important components of school life and is taken very seriously in India. Some institutions also require the use of a tie, especially the schools run by Christian missionaries, and the Indian government does not prohibit the children to have religious symbols, so the Muslim girls can wear the veil (hijab) (burka) and Sikh boys a turban in addition to the uniform. However, most of the schools, whether public or private, prohibit students to have a ponytail or dyed hair.  Indonesia  In Indonesia, school uniforms are mandatory for every student. They can be simply described as below for each stage of education: * Primary schools or Sekolah Dasar (SD) students wear a white short-sleeve shirt with red shorts for male students, and below-knee skirts for females. * Lower secondary schools or Sekolah Menengah Pertama (SMP) require navy blue shorts or trousers with a short-sleeve white shirt for male students. Females wear a below-knee-length or long navy blue skirt and short-sleeve white shirt. * Upper secondary schools Sekolah Menengah Atas (SMA) require blue-grey trousers with a short- sleeve white shirt. Females wear a below-knee-length or long blue-grey skirt, and wear short-sleeve or long-sleeve white shirts. Public schools in Indonesia tolerate religious freedoms. For example, Muslim girls may opt to wear long- sleeve shirts, longer skirts, and jilbab to cover their heads. Most schools in Indonesia also have a batik uniform, usually worn on Thursday or Friday. This kind of uniform consists of a batik short-sleeve or long-sleeve shirt, with long or short trousers for SMA and below-knee or long skirts for females. The motifs and colors of batik depend on the school. Some schools tend to issue neckties and/or vests for their students. These neckties and vests may vary from school to school in color and sewing pattern, even among public schools. Nowadays, with the increase of private schools in Indonesia, most private schools have their own signature school uniform. Most consist of shirts with shorts or trousers for males, and skirts for females, only with differences on the color. Every school has its own standard grooming. Males are not allowed to have long hair. Accessories are also normally prohibited for males, except for watches. Females are usually allowed to use simple accessories such as watches, earrings, and sometimes bracelets. Wearing nail polish is usually not allowed. Most schools pay attention to the shoes that can be worn. Black or white sneakers with white laces are the most common shoes. Few higher-level students, such as in SMA or SMK, are normally required to wear black leather shoes. Schoolgirls in Indonesia in 1971 The school badge is usually put on the right sleeve of a shirt, consist of school's name and location, and some have their own school's logo. Others prefer to wear the school's logo as a lapel or breast plastic or metal pin. The emblem of OSIS (Organisasi Siswa Intra Sekolah), or School's Intern Student Organization, is put on the shirt's left pocket. Students' names are usually on the right side of the shirt and embedded by sewing, ironing or as a detachable badge. Some schools (usually \\"SMP\\" and \\"SMA\\") distinguish the grade of their students by stripes on the official neckties issued or an emblem below the school emblem (it can be stripes, chevrons or numbers). Nowadays some schools require the students to wear an Indonesian flag school badge sewn on top of their left pocket. The scouts (pramuka) uniform is used in many schools in Indonesia at least once a week. It consists of light-brown short-sleeve or long-sleeve shirts, with dark-brown shorts or trousers, and below-knee skirts or longer for females. The common day to wear the scout uniform usually falls on Wednesday, Friday, or Saturday. Furthermore, on certain occasions (usually on ceremonies or competitions), the uniform should be worn as full dress, with red and white scarf/necktie, dark brown beret, rope, dagger and scout's stick. The scout uniform has two breast pockets. Above right pocket is the student's name. The Gerakan Pramuka Indonesia (Indonesian Scout Movement) logo is sewn on the left pocket (for male students). On the right sleeve there are scouting organization's location, number and logo, while on the left sleeve usually are the student's scouting team logo and chevrons denoting his/her grade. Male students wear International Scout Organization logo above their name and female students on their lapel.  Israel  According to former Education Minister Limor Livnat, about 1,400 Israeli public schools require pupils to wear uniforms. School uniforms used to be the norm in the state's early days, but have since fallen out of favor. However, in recent years, the number of schools using school uniforms has been increasing once more. Many teachers, parents and students are in favor of returning the school uniform to common use to prevent the deepening of the gap between affluent children and those less well-off. Nowadays school uniforms are mainly associated with \\"national religious\\" schools within the Israeli system of education.Dr. Zvi Zameret, Fifty Years of Education in the State of Israel, Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 14 July 1998. Schools for Arab citizens of Israel also frequently require uniforms: for girls, it is often a pinafore to be worn over trousers and shirt. In the Haredi or ultra-Orthodox school system, uniforms are compulsory in essentially all girls' schools. In the vast majority of these, the style adopted by the Beit Ya'akov network is used: a sky-blue, button- down, open-collar, loose-fitting blouse with an Oxford-blue, pleated skirt which comes to just below the knee and dark stockings. In cold weather, a Yale-blue sweater may be added. A small fraction of schools alter the color scheme to pink and burgundy, while otherwise retaining the same overall appearance. In boys' schools there is usually not an identifiable school uniform, distinct from what is considered acceptable for ordinary street wear. However, the standards of acceptable street wear for boys and men in Haredi communities are so precise and exacting that in almost all cases all of the boys in a particular school will be dressed identically. In non-Haredi schools today, school uniforms in Israel consist only of a shirt with the school logo. In the summer, the uniform shirt is a simple T-shirt, while in the winter, the shirts worn are warm or hooded sweaters. Although the shirts are uniform, they usually come in various colors, and allow students to customize and express themselves even while wearing a uniform. The shirts sell for a very small amount of money, so that even the less well-off can acquire them.  Italy  In Italy, school uniforms are uncommon, partially because child uniforms are associated with the era of Benito Mussolini before World War II when children were placed according to their age into Italian Fascist youth movements and had to wear uniforms inside and outside school. However, until the early 1960s many high schools required girls to wear black grembiule (resembling a doctor smock) on top of their clothes: no uniform was required for boys. Nowadays, many pre-schools advise parents to dress their children with a grembiulino, i.e., a small grembiule, usually shorter and more colourful, that can be purchased cheaply. Some elementary schools advise some kind of grembiule for the younger pupils. Sometimes girls are required to wear a pink or white grembiulino, while boys may be required to wear a short cotton jacket, usually blue or black. In other cases both boys and girls may be required to wear a more neutral blue grembiule. Some parents send their children to school in a grembiule even if the school does not require it. Poet and children's writer Gianni Rodari has described adult life as \\"a school without grembiule and school desk\\".\\"la scuola dei grandi\\" . In 2004 the Italian chapter of WWF warned that synthetic grembiuli were harmful to pupils.\\"WWF: attenti ai tessuti di grembiuli e abitini per bambini\\" , VITA magazine, 13 September 2004. In July 2008 Education Minister Mariastella Gelmini proposed the re- introduction of the compulsory smock in public schools, provoking a debate in the Italian press.  Japan  Japanese schoolgirls wearing knee-high loose socks. Japan introduced school uniforms in the late 19th century. Today, school uniforms are almost universal in the public and private school systems. They are also used in some women's colleges. The Japanese word for uniform is . In the majority of elementary schools, students are not required to wear a uniform to school. Where they are required, many boys wear white shirts, short trousers, and caps. Young boys often dress more formally in their class pictures than they do other days of the school year. Girls' uniforms might include a grey pleated skirt and white blouse. Occasionally the sailor outfit is used for girls. The uniform codes may vary by season to work with the environment and occasion. It is common for boys and girls to wear brightly coloured caps to prevent traffic accidents. It is normal for uniforms to be worn outside of school areas. However, this is going out of fashion and many students are wearing casual dress. The Japanese junior- and senior-high-school uniform traditionally consists of a military style for boys and a sailor outfit for girls. These uniforms are based on Meiji era formal military dress, themselves modeled on European-style naval uniforms. The sailor outfit replace the undivided hakama (andon bakama 行灯袴) designed by Utako Shimoda between 1920 and 1930. While this style is still in use, many schools have moved to more Western-pattern parochial school uniform styles. They consist of a white shirt, tie, blazer or sweater vest with school crest, and tailored trousers (often not of the same colour as the blazer or sweater vest) for boys and a white blouse, tie, blazer with school crest, and tartan skirt for girls. Much like the male uniform, the gakuran, the sailor outfit bears a similarity to military-styled naval uniforms. The uniform generally consists of a blouse attached with a sailor-style collar and a pleated skirt. There are seasonal variations for summer and winter: sleeve length and fabric are adjusted accordingly. A ribbon is tied in the front and laced through a loop attached to the blouse. Several variations on the ribbon include neckties, bolo ties, neckerchiefs, and bows. Common colours are navy blue, white, grey, light green and black. Shoes, socks, and other accessories are sometimes included as part of the uniform. The socks are typically navy or white. The shoes are typically brown or black penny loafers. Although not part of the prescribed uniform, alternate forms of legwear (such as loose socks, knee-length stockings, or similar) are commonly matched by more fashionable girls with their sailor outfits. Regardless of what type of uniform any particular school assigns its students, all schools have a summer version (usually consisting of a white dress shirt and dark slacks for boys and a reduced-weight traditional uniform or blouse and tartan skirt with tie for girls) and a sports-activity uniform (a polyester track suit for year-round use and a T-shirt and shorts for summer activities). Depending on the discipline level of their school, students may wear seasonal and activity uniforms in the same classroom during the day. Students may attempt to subvert the system of uniforms by wearing them incorrectly or by adding prohibited elements such as large loose socks or badges. Miniskirts have been very popular in Japan, where they became part of school uniforms, and they came to be worn within the Kogal culture.  Lebanon  In Lebanon, all private schools require uniforms. Most of the uniforms are made of a skirt, a shirt, and a pull-over for girls, and for boys it's made of trousers, a shirt, and a pull-over. Some public schools there do not require school uniforms.  Lesotho  In Lesotho school uniforms are still compulsory.The Global Fund, PROPOSAL FORM – ROUND 9 Many poor families can not afford them, which is one of the reasons for the high dropout rate in primary schools.  Malaysia  In Malaysia, school uniforms (Malay: Pakaian Seragam Sekolah) are compulsory for all students who attend public schools. Western- style school uniforms were introduced to present-day Malaysia in the late 19th century during the British colonial era. The present design was standardised beginning in January 1970. Today, school uniforms are almost universal in the public and private school systems. The uniforms at Malaysian public schools are as follows:Kementerian Pendidikan Malaysia 1997.

Some schools require students to sew their name tags in addition to the badge. For upper forms, students generally have to wear a school-specific tie, except those who are wearing the baju kurung. In Malaysia, Muslim girls tend to wear the baju kurung. Most of them start wearing a white tudung (Malaysian version of the Muslim headscarf or hijab) upon entering secondary school, for religious reasons. Non-Muslim girls tend to wear the pinafore. Some non-Muslim girls wear the baju kurung but without the tudung. Malaysian secondary school boys uniform. Muslim boys may wear baju melayu at school on Fridays, often with a songkok hat, to be dressed for going to the mosque for prayers at lunchtime. Girls who choose to wear the pinafore, especially those attending co-ed schools, usually wear shorts under their pinafore to allow for carefree movement as the skirt only covers up to the knee. Those who wear the baju kurung tend not to wear shorts under their long skirt as their skirt covers their legs. Neckties are often worn by prefects, class monitors, librarians, and other students of rank. Some schools have neckties as standard issue; even then, the neckties are generally reserved for school events and public appearances, and are not part of the everyday school uniform. The tropical climate makes them uncomfortable. The hairstyle of students is given attention by schools and the Ministry of Education.Kementerian Pendidikan Malaysia 1997.

For boys, there is usually a maximum length allowed, for example, the hair must be a few centimetres above the collar, and no sideburns are allowed. Violation of boys' hair regulations is often punished with a caning; some offer the alternative of an enforced haircut at the school (although the result of the haircut may be deliberately made to be humiliating as part of the punishment).\\"Students get a trimming from their peers\\", The Star, Kuala Lumpur, 12 August 1998. The use of hair gel is prohibited in some of the stricter schools, to prevent excessive hairdressing. Girls' long hair must be properly tied up, often into a ponytail. Some schools dictate the colour and type of hair accessories that can be used. Some prohibit even girls from having long hair. Wearing make up in school is prohibited. Schools usually enforce their uniform code thoroughly, with regular checks by teachers and prefects. Students who fail to comply may be warned, given demerit points, publicly punished, sent home from school, or caned.Kementerian Pendidikan Malaysia 2003.

Mauritius being a former British colony, has been using the system from back then. The students have to wear uniforms from primary school until higher secondary level. However, there are a few private schools that are based on the French system and do not require the student to wear school uniform.  Mexico  Mexican schoolgirls wearing P.E. uniforms, 2010 In Mexico, students from all public primary and secondary schools, and some public high schools are required to wear uniform (except on special days and/or occasions like holidays in which the school allows students to wear normal clothing rather than the uniform). Most private schools require uniform even since nursery school, however, many private secondary and high schools are opting to eliminate it. Mexican uniforms have the school's logo and colours. Most Mexican schools have 2 types of uniforms: one for P.E. and another for regular school days. Many public secondary schools have a different regular uniform for each grade, especially for girls. Uniforms usually consist of the following (but may vary by school): * Regular ** Boys *** Polo shirt **** Vest or sweater **** Cloth pants **** Socks **** Black shoes ** Girls *** Polo shirt *** Vest or sweater *** Pleated skirt (plaid most of the time) *** Knee high socks (white for most public schools) *** Black mary janes (elementary school) / black laced shoes (secondary school) * P.E. Note: The uniform is unisex most of the time. ** Polo or shirt ** Open sweatshirt ** Athletic pants **socks and sneakers (preferably white) Nowadays, a complete school uniform set cost can go up to 98.39USD for girls, and 102.32USD for boys, which contradicts the uniforms implementation original goal during the 1930s: to reduce clothing costs and avoid classism.https://lopezdoriga.com/vida-y-estilo/por-que-se-usan-uniformes-en- la-escuela/ On 2019, Mexico City's government announced a new Law that permitted pupils to choose whether to wear the pants or skirt version of their regular uniform, regardless of their gender.

New Zealand  School boys in New Zealand Traditionally, many New Zealand intermediate and high schools, and state-integrated and private primary schools, have followed the British system of school uniforms,Elaine Webster, \\"New Zealand School Uniforms in the Era of Democracy: 1965 to 1975\\" in Costume, Volume 42, Number 1, 2008 , pp. 169-183 (15). although it is common in state schools for the boy's uniform to have a jersey and grey short trousers rather than a blazer with tie and long trousers. This usually consists of a variety of the following apparel: for boys, a business-style shirt with an official school tie, and long or short trousers; and for girls, a blouse, and a plain and/or plaid (usually tartan) skirt, and in some schools, especially in the South Island, kilts. Both sexes wear an 'official' school jersey. Blazers and jackets are of varied colours according to the school - dark or light blue, grey, crimson, scarlet, green or black. Some follow the British practice of having contrasting colours edging the lapels and jacket fronts. Caps have generally been discarded since the 1970s but in many primary schools there is a compulsory broad-brimmed floppy hat, in the school colours, to help prevent sunburn. Where short trousers are worn, boys are usually required to wear long dark socks, which may require garters to hold them up.Pictured at The History of School Uniforms. Since 1990 an increasing number of schools, especially in the North Island, include sandals as the standard summer footwear. Many schools also allow students to attend barefoot, with a relatively large number of students choosing to do so. During the 1980s and 1990s there was a tendency for the traditional uniform to be replaced by cheaper and more 'modern' options: polo shirts,See e.g. Uniform rules at Logan Park High School. polar fleece tops, or a complete doing away with uniforms in favour of mufti. Intermediate schools usually provide the option of skirts or culottes for girls and sometimes shorts while boys will wear shorts. Bike shorts or tights are sometimes worn under girls' skirts and dresses. Some high schools have introduced trousers as an option for girls instead of skirts, however demand is low with several Christchurch high schools estimating only 1% of girls at their respective schools wear trousers.  Nigeria  School uniforms are used in Nigeria for all public and private schools right from the nursery school to the primary and secondary schools. This originally came with the introduction of western education by the Christian missionaries and the act continued during the colonial era up till the current era of independence.

Philippines School uniforms (Filipino: uniporme or kasuotang pampaaralan, \\"school attire\\"), much like Mexico, are commonplace in public schools and required in private schools. In some private schools, there are specified days when students can wear civilian clothing, typically in special occasions like a holiday or last day of school. There is usually no uniform in universities and progressive schools except for uniforms used in P.E classes, and in specific schools such as the University of Santo Tomas. Public school uniforms for primary levels are typically white, short-sleeved, buttoned-up shirts, with long skirts for girls and light brown knee-length trousers for boys. Uniforms for public high schools and private schools vary widely in pattern and colour, but most often are in the official school colours. Muslim girls in some higher institutions are often required to wear a white hijab versus other colours. Some school uniforms in the Philippines can bear resemblance to Japanese school uniforms. The material for these usually loose uniforms is often light and suited to the country's tropical climate (e.g. cotton).

The idea of school uniforms in Poland did not exist before the early 20th century. In the People's Republic of Poland, uniform ceased to be compulsory in most schools during the 1980s due to economic issues. Since then, there has been made only one effort to reintroduce uniform into Polish schools - by the former minister of education Roman Giertych, in 2006. It was then decided that school uniform would not be enforced by the state onto the whole country, but would be a matter decided upon by the principal of each school respectively. Initially this was meant to permit only a dress code, but this was later modified in 2007 to address school uniform. From 2007, all primary schools and middle schools were to enforce compulsory uniform, whilst high schools and other forms of further education were given the choice to decide on their own. The appearance of school uniform was decided upon locally, which meant that \\"uniform\\" in most schools consisted of a jacket or shirt only - selected by the school management purely to avoid breaking regulations (the rest of clothing was still up to the students to decide). By mid-2008, compulsory school uniforms were repealed and it remains so to this day.  Ireland  In Ireland, almost all primary and secondary schools require students to wear a uniform. These can vary from school to school but for the most part include trousers for male students, a skirt or pinafore for female students and a shirt, a jumper and a necktie. In recent years many schools also offer the option of trousers for female students. Some schools require blazers rather than jumpers. Some primary schools now let their pupils wear a school tracksuit rather than a formal uniform. In recent years there has been criticism, including by the Department of Education of the requirement that a school uniform jumper must have the school crest or name imprinted onto it and of the practice where a school's uniform can only be bought from a certain supplier, which can markedly increase the price of a uniform. As well as rules regarding the wearing of a uniform many schools have regulations regarding hair, footwear, the growth of facial hair for males, the wearing of makeup and the length of school skirts.  Russia  Uniform for high school students model 1954 (In use 1954-1962). During the Soviet period, a standardised \\"universal\\" school uniform was worn by all schools. Originally of a military style with peaked cap and high collared tunic, by the 1980s boys wore a functional dark blue pattern with shoulder patches identifying the school. For formal occasions such as the first day of term, girls wore white lace collars and aprons dating back to the reign of Catherine the Great. During the initial post Soviet period from 1994 to 2013, the mandatory uniform policy was abandoned and pupils generally wore casual clothing such as jeans, T-shirts and sweaters. However, uniforms were reintroduced under a new education law in September 2013.http://one-europe.info/school-uniform-the- russian-experience Among the supporters of the new uniform law of 2013, arguments included tackling social inequality, but also putting an end to the controversial problem of whether school students are allowed to wear traditional religious clothing to school. Each school can now choose its own uniform. Also, there are many instances in which schools do not enforce the rules on school uniform. Generally, schools without school uniforms enforce dress-code, with \\"business-casual\\" style of clothes.  South Africa  Typical example of an assembly in a South African school. All students are in uniform, with a sharp difference between the sexes. Students of Sinenjongo High School in Cape Town, South Africa. As in many other former British colonies, all South African private and public schools have a uniform, and it is compulsory in all public schools and in the vast majority of private schools for children above pre-school level.\\"A parent's guide to schooling\\", SouthAfrica.info. Uniform types vary less between public and private schools than they do across regions, where schools in more rural areas tend to forgo the daily wearing of ties and/or blazers for boys and girls regardless of their public or private nature. However, many of these same schools will have a \\"number ones\\" uniform for special occasions which include such items. In cities such as Cape Town, on the other hand, it is more common to see formal apparel required in public and private schools on a daily basis. Many schools across South Africa also provide the choice between a summer and winter uniform, with khaki uniforms and brown shoes being very common in the summer. Although many schools allow girls to also wear trousers (especially during winter months) South African law has not required gender neutrality in school dress codes and a distinction between girls' and boys' uniforms remains. Boys of all ages are normally required to wear grey or khaki long or short trousers with socks, and the socks are usually long when worn with shorts, as in the illustration (right). Until recently, the straw boater was a common accessory in affluent public and private high schools, although these have now become optional in some cases.Picture of senior high school boys in blazers, short trousers and straw boaters. Nearly all schools, public or fee paying, have sports' kits (uniforms) that often allow bare feet for junior schools, regardless of the season.  South Korea  South Korean school uniform Almost all South Korean secondary students wear a uniform called \\"gyobok\\" (Korean: 교복, 校服). The majority of elementary schools, except some private ones, do not have uniforms; however, the uniform is strictly monitored from the start of middle school and up. Based on Western-style ones, the South Korean uniform usually consists of a shirt, blazer and tie, with skirts for girls and trousers for boys. More recently, the uniform is often worn by celebrities who target the younger, teen audience to sell entertainment products. The school uniform and school setting is frequently used as a venue for romance. As a result, the uniform has become something akin to an expression of fashion among students. Name tags that are worn usually have different colours per grade. Oftentimes the writing is in black or white, whereas the background is coloured.  Spain  In Spain the use of school uniforms is not compulsory in the public school at any stage. Their use depends on school councils involving parents. However, it is customary to wear uniforms in private schools, where typically girls wear uniform shirt and jersey skirt and boys wear white shirt and tie and sometimes jacket.  Sri Lanka  It is mandatory for Sri Lankan school students to wear a uniform regardless of them attending a government, semi-government or private school. In most government and semi-government schools, boys will wear a short-sleeved white shirt and a navy blue short when they are in the junior grades. This will later transition to white shorts and then to white trousers towards the latter part of the school life. A tie is not always worn, but may be worn for special school events along with a long- sleeved shirt. Proper black dress shoes and socks are also a part of this uniform. Certain schools also require the uniform to have the school's insignia stitched to a corner of the pocket of the shirt. Girls who attend government and semi-government schools will wear a white one-piece dress. This may or may not have sleeves. Certain schools make wearing a tie mandatory for girls and some may have a plastic badge or the school's insignia stitched to the dress. Proper dress shoes and socks are mandatory in most schools. On special occasions, students who bear a post in a sports team, club or association, would wear a blazer which would normally be white and having accents based on the school colours. In privately run schools, the suit is very similar but the colours might differ. They range from khaki and dark green to bright blue.  Taiwan  High school girls in uniform during a school ceremony in Taiwan. As Taiwan experienced a long period of Japanese colonial rule, it is influenced by Japanese culture and the uniform style can be said to be close. However the school uniforms in the two regions are not identical. There are a total of 471 Taiwanese high schools. All schools have two sets of uniforms, a summer uniform and a uniform for winter. According to the provisions, sportswear is worn. Summer Elementary school (Chinese: 國小)：White short pants and shirts are most common for the boys, while girls will wear a pleated skirt Junior high school (Chinese: 國中)：Males wear short- sleeved shirts with shorts. Females wear shirts with pleated skirts or skirt pants. Some schools have sailor uniforms. Senior high school (Chinese: 高中)：Short sleeved shirts with long pants for males, pleated skirts for females in public schools; private schools will always have skirts Winter Long pants and long sleeved shirts are worn in most schools. In the past, many schools had khaki uniforms but this has been phased out with the exception of a few schools. See also: Uniform Map.  Thailand  : :: '''' Thai students wearing school uniforms Uniforms are compulsory for all students with very few variations from the standard model throughout the public and private school systems, including colleges and universities. The dress code in primary and secondary grades for boys comprises dark blue, khaki, or black shorts with a white open-collar short-sleeved shirt, white ankle socks or long dark socks, and brown or black trainers. Female students, wear a knee-length dark blue or black skirt, and a pale white blouse with a loosely hanging bow tie. The bow tie is dropped in favour of an open-necked pale blue shirt from Matthayom 4. The girls' uniform is complemented by white ankle socks and black school shoes. The student's name, number, and name of the school are often embroidered on the blouse or shirt. Some independent or international schools have uniforms more closely resembling British school uniform standards, and boys in senior high school grades may be allowed to wear long trousers. The standard dress for children in kindergarten is a red skirt and white blouse for girls, and red short trousers and a white shirt for boys. In all Thai schools, one day per week, usually Wednesday, is dedicated to scouting, when beige scout uniforms for boys and dark green guide uniforms are the rule, both wearing yellow neckerchiefs. The hairstyle of students is also given attention by schools and the Ministry of Education. Males are not allowed to have long hair. Some prohibit even girls from having long hair. The use of accessories is prohibited for males, while females are sometimes allowed to use simple accessories. Some schools dictate the colour and type of hair accessories that females can use. Thailand however has a few international schools which do not require uniforms.  Tonga  Royal New Zealand Navy Petty Officer Richard Boyd dances with Tongan school children during a Pacific Partnership 2009 community service project at Faleloa Primary School. In Tonga all schools require a uniform. Uniforms are usually in the colours of their respective churches and Red for Government Schools. Catholic schools are usually light blue, Wesleyan (Royal Blue), Anglican (Navy Blue) and LDS Schools (Green). A Ta'ovala bordered with school colours and a tupenu are usually worn by boys with a white button-up shirt. Pupils usually wear shorts and a white button up shirt. Nearly all Tongan secondary schools require girls to wear a pinafore dress with a white shirt, except for Catholic schools which allow a striped blouse and skirt. Pupils are usually required to wear Roman sandals in English-medium schools, and thongs (flip-flops) in most other schools.  Turkey  Turkish school uniforms. School uniforms were used in all public and private institutions. There were several exceptions and most kindergartens did not require school uniforms. The uniforms varied in their appearance; primary schools used one-piece blue uniforms, while in secondary and high schools boys wore dark grey trousers with white shirts, jackets and a tie. Girls had skirts and shirts coloured like the boys' uniform, plus a tie. Most private institutions have their own uniforms. School uniforms for primary schools were black until the 1990s. None of the universities or higher-education institutes have uniforms. School uniforms abolished in 2012 and schools gave a poll to families to select uniform or casual cloths. Dress code says that students' shoulder should be covered, girls cannot wear leggings or miniskirts. This caused a controversy in Western cities since some students were wearing mini's, shorts and leggings. New law says that students can wear hijabs at school but it's prohibited to wear makeup, tattoos, piercings, dye ın hair etc. School uniforms have a long history in Turkey. They were first introduced because normal clothing would give hints about the child's family's economic situation. In order to prevent groupings amongst children from different social classes, uniforms were accepted. However, school uniforms were officially abolished on 27 November 2012, when the Turkish Ministry of Education suddenly abolished the nationwide uniform requirement in schools (international/foreign schools are excluded) and lifted the headscarf ban for religious imam-hatip schools, prompting fierce criticism from opposition parties, unions and educators. Opponents claim that economic differences cause pedagogical traumas for children and that permitting headscarves harms secular education. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan defended the move, saying education in uniform has drawn complaints for many years. But students attending minority schools (Greeks, Jews and Armenians), which are also part of the Turkish Ministry of Education, have been excluded from this change, and are still required to wear school uniforms.\\"Obligatory School Uniforms Abolished amid Criticisms\\". Hürriyet Daily News. 28 November 2012.  United Arab Emirates  Uniforms are compulsory in many schools across the United Arab Emirates. In June 2013, the Abu Dhabi Education Council standardised the uniforms for pupils in public school across Abu Dhabi. Earlier, each school had its own uniform. Uniforms include options for varying weather conditions. Boys in Kindergarten and Cycle 1 (Grades 1 to 5) can wear either a long- sleeved shirt and trousers or a short-sleeved shirt and shorts. Tie, winter blazer, and cardigan are optional. Boys in Cycle 2 and Cycle 3 (Grades 6 to 12) wear a kandoora (traditional white robe) and ghetra (head scarf). Pullover sweater or blazer are optional Girls in Kindergarten or Cycle 1 (Grades 1 to 5) wear a long sleeved shirt with either a school dress or skirt. Cardigan, blazer, and scarf are optional. Girls in Cycle 2 or 3 (Grades 6 to 12) wear a long sleeved shirt with a choice of a skirt or two different styles of dress plus a scarf. Cardigan or blazer are optional. These are only for the schools with the Arabic curriculum, not the other schools. Private schools in the UAE require a school uniform. It can range from a T-shirt or a simple white/black polo bearing the school logo to a more complete uniform with a button up shirt worn with a skirt, shorts or trousers. In the British schools, there is a blouse and either a skirt or trousers for the girls or a button up shirt with trousers. Shirts bear the school logo. Certain schools have certain codes on the use of makeup (some don't condone it at all) and the sporting of bracelets/jewellery.  United Kingdom  While school uniform is common in the United Kingdom, there is no legislation enforcing it in any of the three separate legal jurisdictions of England & Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, and enforcement of school uniform policy and dress codes is generally for individual schools to determine. However, schools do have to take into account Equality legislation in dress policies to prevent discrimination on grounds such as age, sex, race, disability, religion or belief and sexual orientation. School uniforms are required to be similar in cost for both boys and girls, to be reasonably low cost, and to tolerate religious freedoms, e.g. allowing male Sikhs to wear turbans and female Muslims to wear headscarves.\\"School uniform\\", CBBC Newsround, retrieved on 28 August 2008. In order to ensure that policies are fair and non-discriminatory schools are expected to consult widely with staff, pupils, parents and governors when introducing or amending dress policies.  England  English girls in modern school uniform. In 2011, more than 90% of English secondary schools had a compulsory uniform. School uniforms were first introduced on a large scale during the reign of King Henry VIII. The uniforms of the time were referred as \\"bluecoats\\", as they consisted of long trench-coat-style jackets dyed blue. Blue was the cheapest available dye and showed humility amongst all children. The first school to introduce this uniform was Christ's Hospital in London (now in Sussex). The Elementary Education Act 1870 introduced free primary education for all children. The popularity of uniforms increased, and eventually most schools had a uniform. During this period most uniforms reflected the trends of the age, with boys wearing short trousers and blazers until roughly the age of puberty and then long trousers from about 14 or 15. Girls mainly wore blouses, tunic dress and pinafores.I These uniforms continued until the 1950s when after the Butler reforms secondary education was made free and the school leaving age was raised to 15. These reforms encouraged schools to implement uniform codes which were similar to other schools. Distinct \\"summer\\" and \\"winter\\" uniforms were sometimes required, particularly for girls, for whom dresses were mandated for summer and gymslips for winter. In the 21st century, the typical primary school uniform is fairly casual while secondary school uniform is often formal. Uniform in primary school is generally a polo shirt or T-shirt, a jumper with the school logo, and trousers or shorts or a skirt. The typical secondary school uniform is a blazer, white shirt or blouse, a tie, trousers or skirt, and black shoes. Some primary schools have more formal uniform, with tie and blazer, and for secondary schools to require only a jumper. Uniforms sometimes match the school colours, but are most commonly found in blue, black and grey.  Scotland  A school uniform worn in Scotland – Marr College in Troon (socks and shorts are not part of the uniform, pupils can wear either trousers or skirts and shorter socks) Scottish law is not specific on the question of school uniform. Generally, the school must provide information on its policy on clothing and uniform and the Education Authority must provide written information on its general policy on wearing school uniform. Some Education Authorities do not insist on students wearing a uniform as a precondition to attending and taking part in curricular activities. Children cannot be disciplined for not wearing a uniform if their parents do not want their child to wear it. However, a child that simply refuses to wear the school uniform can be disciplined by the school if it thinks that academic or disciplinary problems might be caused by the refusal. Many schools do have a policy covering the wearing of school clothing. The policy may state that certain items must be worn and that other items cannot be worn, for example, jeans. Schools must take religious and cultural requirements into account when drawing up a school uniform policy. Although the way that the uniforms are worn is usually not an issue, some state schools may have regulation on the subject (e.g. height of ties, whether the shirt is tucked in or not), the selection of clothes worn, whether they follow the policy, can be very strict. For example, in black and white uniform schools, wearing colours such as grey or wearing white shoes is forbidden. However, in schools that only use a basic uniform (e.g. jumper and trousers) the policy is often less strict.  Wales  The Welsh Assembly Government issued detailed guidance to governing bodies on uniform and appearance policies that begins by making explicit, \\"There is no education legislation specifically covering the wearing of school uniform or other aspects of appearance such as hair colour and style, and the wearing of jewellery and makeup. However, as part of its responsibility for the conduct of the school, a governing body can specify a uniform which pupils are required to wear and other rules relating to appearance.\\"Guidance to Governing Bodies on Uniform and Appearance Policies. Welsh Government. 25 February 2008.  Northern Ireland  The Northern Ireland Executive supports poor families with the cost of paying for school uniforms with a £350 primary school uniform allowance. This is claimed via local Education and Library Boards for parents in receipt of income support. At the end of August 2009, there were 24,135 successful applications for the grant. The most common secondary school uniform in Northern Ireland is a shirt, blazer and sweater with a tie and a skirt or trousers. The uniform (most likely the sweater and tie) may change after Year 12. The uniform in primary school is similar to those used in the Republic of Ireland.  United States  Most schools in the United States do not require uniforms. Private schools and other specialized schools sometimes require an informal uniform, called a “standardized dress code”. Policy regarding school-appropriate dress, and the extent of enforcement, will vary by school and school district. A study conducted in 2000 found that only 23% of public, private, and sectarian schools had any sort of uniform policy in the United States at or before 2000. Over the subsequent decade, more public schools, specifically those in urban areas, instituted stricter dress codes. For instance, red, white or blue polo shirts, with a logo, with navy or khaki bottoms and a belt, was the uniform policy imposed at Palmer Elementary School in Houston, Texas. Schools may also have polo shirts and trousers as a uniform. Roughly half the public schools in the United States had these more limiting dress codes by 2011.http://nces.ed.gov/programs/crimeindicators/crimeindicators2011/tables/table_20_1.asp The schools that do require uniforms, or a more common standard dress code in towns and suburbs, tend to be more casual than those in Britain or other commonwealth nations. Commonly, students wear collared, buttoned shirts, with a tie for boys and a tie for girls, worn with khaki trousers, and a belt, depending on the age of the school's student body. Skirts of a modest length are occasionally an option for girls. Dress codes vary widely among private schools, although a Catholic school uniform tends to keep the shirt and tie.  Research studies and legislation  The National Association of Elementary School Principals (NAESP) conducted a phone survey of 755 principals in 2000, which revealed that 21% of public schools had a uniform policy; 23% had firm plans to create one.Public School Uniform Statistics. Retrieved on 21 December 2011. However, this only accounts for those with school uniform policies and not for standardised dress codes, which provide for allowable student dress but are slightly more lax: For instance, instead of requiring everyone to wear the same shirt, or set of shirts, they may specify \\"any solid collared three-button polo/oxford shirt\\" and leave more specific details up to the parents. In 2007-2008, 55% of public school principals said their schools enforce a strict dress code, requiring students at least wear a collared shirt and trousers with an acceptable belt to school.NCST Fast Facts - School Uniforms.

Mitchell of The Journal of Negro Education stated that little empirical research exists regarding how effective school uniforms are in enhancing academic performance and social environments, and that little research exists regarding teachers' beliefs regarding issues related to dress codes, especially so regarding racial and ethnic minorities.Alleyne et al. 418 In the United States, literature regarding public school student clothing and behavior cites anecdotal viewpoints from teachers. The literature discussed opinions on faculty, staff, and other employees on how to deal with student dress issues.Alleyne et al. 418-419 A 2003 article of The Journal of Negro Education said that research and reports regarding the beneficial impact of school uniforms was not conclusive. Despite the federal government of the United States issuing a set of guidelines encouraging school uniforms in public schools, as of 2003 political support varied.Alleyne et al. 419 In 1994, the Long Beach Unified School District, in Southern California, required school uniforms in all elementary and middle schools. This began a trend for uniforms in American elementary public schools, especially in urban school districts. President Clinton praised the idea in his 1996 State of the Union Address, saying that \\"if it means that teenagers will stop killing each other over designer jackets, then our public schools should be able to require their students to wear school uniforms.\\" The adoption of school- or district-wide uniform policies (or \\"standardised dress codes\\", less rigid than uniform requirements and allowing some leeway in parameters) has been motivated by a need to counter \\"gang clothing\\" or the pressure for families to purchase upscale-label clothing (to avoid the ostracism of their children by \\"fashion cliques\\"), as well as to improve morale and school discipline. The proportion of U.S. public schools requiring uniforms had increased from 3% in 1996 to 25% in 2010. In Puerto Rico, the Department of Education requires all students to wear school uniforms, with only medical exemptions.  Vietnam  Most schools in Vietnam require uniforms. The rules on uniform vary between schools and areas. The most common type of uniform consists of a white shirt with a school logo on left sleeve and navy/black trousers, with a red scarf for students from grade 3 to grade 9. This kind of uniform is often seen in public schools in North Vietnam and in rural areas. There is no differences between boys' and girls' uniforms. However, many schools (usually private or famous public schools) have their own designed uniforms, which often replace trousers with skirts for girls or include bows, ties or vests/blazers.Examples of different school uniforms in Vietnam http://www.asiafinest.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=305508&st;=0 School uniforms of Lawrence S. Ting School in 7th District, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam The white áo dài is also a tradition uniform for high school girls in Vietnam, but most schools in Northern Vietnam only require it for important events or ceremonies, since wearing áo dài is uncomfortable for daily use. Otherwise, áo dài is very familiar with school girls in Mekong Delta, where it is \\"daily uniform\\" of all them. The image of a high school girl with nón lá and white áo dài on a bike is still considered symbolic. Two highschool girls in áo dài in HCMC There are also uniforms for Physical Education in Vietnamese schools, this usually includes T-shirt and tracksuit, the T-shirts have school logo on them. The tracksuit jacket is popular and often used as a winter uniform, even outside of gym activity. There are no specific shoes for Vietnamese students, however, flip-flops, slippers and high heels are forbidden. Sandals and boots are allowed, although students normally wear sneakers or flats to school. Dyed hair, nail polish and make-up are banned in many schools.  Venezuela  School uniforms are used in Venezuela. By Venezuelan decree, uniforms are required at all schools in all grades. Boys wear navy trousers and girls wear navy skirts or trousers, depending on the school. The shirts have short sleeves and the colour varies by the level in which the student is. Students in nursery wear yellow shirts, while students in kindergarten wear red shirts. From first to sixth grade, students wear white polo shirts. From seventh to ninth grade they wear light blue polo shirts, and from tenth to eleventh grade they wear beige polo shirts. These shirts are to be stuffed inside the trousers with a black belt. Black dress shoes are the norm in public school, however some private schools can be more flexible with the shoes to be worn.

The matter related to establishing inheritance for grandchildren of Henry Howard, 22nd Earl of Arundel including grandchildren who were not yet born. Facts of the Case In this case, the Earl of Arundel tried to create a shifting executory limitation so that some of his property would pass to his eldest son, Thomas (who was mentally deficient), and then to his second son, Henry. Henry would at first receive other property, but that would pass to the fourth son, Charles, if Henry succeeded to Thomas's property. The estate plan also included provisions for shifting the property many generations later if certain conditions should occur. The earl's sons had the revived title of \\"Duke of Norfolk\\". When Henry succeeded to Thomas's body of property, he did not want to pass the other property to Charles. Charles sued to enforce his interest, and the court (in this instance, the House of Lords) held that such a shifting condition could not exist indefinitely. The judges believed that tying up property too long beyond the lives of people living at the time was wrong, although the exact period was not determined for another 150 years. Cadell v. Palmer 1 Cl. & Fin. 372, 6 Eng. Rep. 936 (H.L. 1832, 1833)  Rule in the Case The rule against perpetuities is closely related to another doctrine in the common law of property, the rule against unreasonable restraints on alienation. Both stem from an underlying principle or reference in the common law disapproving of restraints on property rights.Cole v. Peters, 3 S.W.3d 846 (Mo. Ct. App. W.D. 1999). However, while a violation of the rule against perpetuities is also a violation of the rule against unreasonable restraints on alienation, the reciprocal is not true.Cole v Peters, 3 S.W.3d 846. As one has stated, \\"The rule against perpetuities is an ancient, but still vital, rule of property law intended to enhance marketability of property interests by limiting remoteness of vesting.\\" The rule has been recognized in some jurisdictions in the United States in Wedel v.

He is sometimes called \\"Lambert of Vignory\\", but this is a result of confusion with bishop Lambert II. Nothing certain is known of his family, save that he had a married sister named Letgardis. Lambert was a cathedral provost under his predecessor, Bruno. Lambert's election as bishop, after Bruno's death on 30 January 1016, was orchestrated by King Robert II of France, who in return received from the bishop the county of Dijon. Whereas Bruno had been a Carolingian legitimist, Lambert's election represented a shift in allegiance in the Duchy of Burgundy towards the new Capetian dynasty. In October 1016, Lambert presided over the dedication of the renovated abbatial basilica of Saint-Bénigne de Dijon, a project of Bruno's. According to the contemporary chronicler Radulfus Glaber, at the dedication the abbot, William of Volpiano, ranted about the unusual dress and hairstyle of those from southern France who had accompanied King Robert's wife, Constance of Arles. The rant probably belongs in the context of a dispute between old guard (anti-Capetian) and new (pro-Capetian). In 1019, Lambert extended the proprietary rights of Aimo, count of Bolenois, over the abbacy (abbatia) of Sexfontaines. He granted him the abbey \\"to make improvements\\" (in melius augmentando), and permitted his wife and sons to inherit it in lordship (dominatio) under the bishop's authority. Upon their deaths it would have reverted to episcopal control, but in 1030 Lambert authorised its sale to William of Volpiano. On 8 April 1022, Lambert made a grant to Count Humbert I of Savoy.

He recalls that when he was asked as a primary school student about his dream for the future, he answered unhesitatingly, \\"to become a writer.\\" Due to the colonial circumstances of the time, he spoke and wrote in Japanese, and because his first encounters with literature were in Japanese, he was greatly interested in Japanese novels and poetry, especially the haiku.\\"Bak Hui-jini\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: Park attended Korea University where he majored in English, and worked as a teacher at Tongseong Junior High and High School. He was a member of the Sahwajip literary club in the 1960s, and also a member of the poetry reading club, Space. Park, who has remained single his entire life, admitted in his own words, \\"I married poetry.\\" He refrained from participation in writers' groups which often fell into the snares of political ideology, rather devoting himself to the perfecting of his poetic art. He has boasted that he \\"made real contributions to the literary coterie magazine movement in Korea,\\" and also has great pride as the poet \\"who first truly experimented with the poetry recitation movement.\\" Defining poets as those who are \\"insanely in love with words,\\" he emphasizes that poets \\"must pour every ounce of their effort into language\\". Work Park's literary world starkly contrasts heaven and earth and contradictions between light and darkness. Following Korea's liberation from Japan, Park engrossed himself in writing poetry in his mother tongue. At first, his Korean was clumsy, but he strove to create his very own poetic world, drawing upon artistic trends from both inside and outside Korea. Majoring in English literature as a college student, Park was heavily influenced by Romantic poets like T.S. Eliot and W.B. Yeats; as well as Rainer Marie Wilke from Germany, and Paul Valery from France. Park says he also received great inspiration from traditionalist poets such as the renowned Seo Jeong-ju and Yu Chi-hwan, with whom he interacted, as well as Jo Ji-hun, Bak Mog-weol and Bak Du-jin, who wrote traditional nature poetry. Park, unusually for modern Korean poets, has also written traveling poems, a result of this extensive travel to the United States and Europe.

Although Lee Yun-gi (1947~ ) made his official literary debut in 1977 and published his first collection of short stories, White Helicopter in 1988, it was not until the mid-1990s that he gained recognition as a fiction writer. For the first twenty years of his career, Lee was better known as a prolific translator and by the time his first novel, The Gates of Heaven, appeared in 1994, he had translated and published over 150 works including Umberto Eco’s The Name of the Rose and Foucault’s Pendulum.\\"Lee Yun-gi\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# Work Lee Yun-gi utilizes his knowledge of mythology to build narratives rich in symbols and metaphors. His background in translating, which requires attention to the exact meaning of each word, gives his language precision and accuracy. His writing contains a great deal of dialogue. Although Korean writers tend to focus more on descriptions than dialogues, Lee Yun-gi relies much on dialogues to drive his narrative forward. His dialogues are pithy but meaningful and so dynamic that the readers often imagine themselves listening to a real conversation. In his works, Lee focuses on understanding various forms of life through communication with others and thereby embraces life. Lee’s attitude toward life is marked by a sense of generosity and optimism. He does not complain about life’s cruelties, become frustrated by hardships or despair over the baseness of human nature. Rather than exposing the problems in life, he concentrates on resolving them through his work. Lee often uses aphorisms—old ones reshaped or new ones penned by the author and strategically placed throughout the text—that attempt to express a certain universal truth about life. Another characteristic of Lee’s fiction is humor and wit. The comedy of a given situation is brought to life through the author’s multi- layered style of writing that initially delays understanding and then allows his characters an epiphanic moment later on. Lee draws freely from his knowledge of both eastern and western history, mythologies and culture. In 1998 Lee won the Dong-in Literature Prize and in 2008 he won the Daesan Literature Award and the Korean Translation Award.

Contents The 8 stories in this collection are: *\\"The Resurrection of Father Brown\\" *\\"The Arrow of Heaven\\" *\\"The Oracle of the Dog\\" *\\"The Miracle of Moon Crescent\\" *\\"The Curse of the Golden Cross\\" *\\"The Dagger with Wings\\" *\\"The Doom of the Darnaways\\" *\\"The Ghost of Gideon Wise\\" According to The FictionMags Index, the first story was original to the collection; the last was published in the April 1926 number of Cassell's Magazine; the six intermediate stories had appeared in Nash's Pall Mall Magazine from December 1923 to July 1925, in a different sequence. Summaries=The Resurrection of Father Brown The scene begins with an American journalist named Paul Snaith critically assessing Father Brown's church and the other clerics there. He quickly changes his mind to please the famous businessman, Mendoza, who walks in with a lavish respect for the Church. Snaith then goes on a journalistic quest to make Father Brown's name great. Meanwhile in South America, Brown quickly begins to resent his growing fame and after dealing with his likewise growing workload (including endorsing a wine for a man named Eckstein and responding to a letter from a political rival named Alvarez), he goes out on a walk at night. During this walk, as he passes under a bridge, he is attacked by two mysterious men and left injured or killed. The story shifts over to John Adams Race, an electrical engineer from America who was hired by Mendoza to improve the same small South American town in which Father Brown resides. Race, Chesterton says, is a man who is firmly attached to his Protestant and American background, despite not particularly being devoted to them, and in spite of himself, Race sees in Father Brown a reminder of what he loves about his upbringing. The story flashes back to show Race looking out his window to see Father Brown pass by in the night, soon followed by two other men. Race identifies these men as Eckstein and Dr. Calderon, a physician who attended to Mendoza. Race follows the two men out of suspicion, and immediately after they both disappear under the bridge after Brown does, where there are sounds of a fight. A mob gathers around the scene and identifies Father Brown to be dead. As Race nears the bridge, Snaith comes out to confirm the story and describe what appears to have happened. As Race looks at the body of Brown, Alvarez, who is also near the body quickly claims to have no part in the murder. Mendoza and Dr. Calderon enter the scene as well, and again pronounce Father Brown dead. A funeral is held for the simple priest, in which Mendoza decides to give a long, drawn-out speech. In his ramblings, he attacks all atheists, and is soon in a fiery argument with Alvarez, who rages against resurrection of the dead in part of his argument. Snaith silences the two by claiming that Father Brown is beginning to move. Father Brown then sits up and the mob attending the funeral becomes a frenzy of excitement about the event. Father Brown tries without success to calm the crowd, but when he is unable, he runs to the telegraph office to send to the Bishop's secretary that there was no miracle that had happened. John Race walks Father Brown back to the church, where Brown begins to attempt to solve his own murder case. As Brown describes his assault, he seems to indicate that it was faked. He says the weapons used against him never actually hit him, but instead he seemed to collapse and faint of some unknown source. He mentions to Race that the wine from Eckstein may have been drugged, and Race, who started as a druggist before coming to engineering, confirms the suspicion. In a flash of intuition, Brown realizes the schemes of his would-be murderers and recounts the details to Race. The plan was to fake the priest's death, then debunk it in order to show Brown as a sham. Brown concludes, saying he must go thank God that he was saved from disgrace and that he had so quickly contacted the Bishop with an unknowing counter-claim to the antagonists' plot against him and inviting Race to a drink of un-drugged wine. The Arrow of Heaven The story opens with Father Brown stepping off of a ship into America. He is immediately assaulted by journalists, then finally, upon answering their many questions, spoke with a tall man in goggles. The man asked if Brown was looking for \\"Captain Wain\\" and introduced himself as Norman Drage. The goggled man rambled on a little while and the simple priest was left very confused. Soon the two were driving with Captain Peter Wain down the road, as Wain and Drage recounted stories of two recent murders connected with a mystical \\"Coptic cup\\" by a notorious man known only as Daniel Doom. An associate of Wain's uncle came into possession of this cup; the man was named Merton. As Wain explains, the previous two owners began receiving threatening letters from Doom before their murders, and at the death of the last victim, the widow was forced to sell many possessions the family had owned; Merton apparently purchased this cup, and presumably has begun to receive threatening letters. When the three arrive at Merton's enormous mansion, just as they are about to enter, Drage stops and says that Merton would be too happy to see him, and leaves. Father Brown is curious at this behavior and as he surveys the house, notes with a surprise how thoroughly guarded it is. Wain describes how important Merton is to the world and how vital it is that he is protected while Father Brown laments how caged he must be. As the pair is about to go into a safe-room to meet with Mr. Merton, Wain's uncle (Crake) and Merton's lawyer walk out, having just talked with him about business for a while. Soon Mr. Wilton (the secretary to Mr. Merton) comes out of the safe room to announce that Merton will be available in ten minutes. He also tells the priest of Merton's schedule and of having only fifteen minutes alone every day to worship the Coptic Cup. He brags of the defenses he apparently devised to protect Merton and claims them to be near- impenetrable. After Brown comments that Wilton seems to be more intent on catching the murderer than saving Merton, the secretary reveals that one of the previous victims of Daniel Doom was his father, so he means to protect Merton, but is very personally connected with catching the killer. Father Brown remarks that it is time to go in to speak with the millionaire, and as he walks into the inner room, he reveals Merton to have been shot with an arrow and murdered. Crake, having a history with Red Indian war tactics, along with his nephew Captain Wain, are implied to be suspects of Father Brown's search to find the murderer and over the course of a few weeks, he speaks with each of them. Potentially, Wain flew a plane over or near the mansion, while his uncle shot Merton with an arrow through an open window. Both men are astounded to realize Brown's possible story of the event, but the priest refuses to comment on his thoughts. Soon a conversation with Drage ensues. Whereas previously he was very finely dressed and upbeat, he is now bitter and appears to be clothed much more shabbily. He seems glad that Mr. Merton has died, and praises old Eastern technology and religion that more or less would have helped kill him. Brown quickly dismisses the possibility of Drage having killed Merton, leaving Drage shocked at Brown's statement that he had needed the victim and would never have killed him. After another interlude, Father Brown meets with a council of many people who had contact with Merton. There he debunks the idea that Drage could have killed the man, and instead claims that the arrow that was found in the victim most likely had been used to stab him, and later configured to appear as if it had been shot. Further, the priest explains that Wain and Crake could not have been the murderer either. He breaks in to then say that after speaking to Wilton, that Wilton had killed Doom in some wild struggle. Everyone in the room applauds Wilton's brash justice. After much questioning, Father Brown reveals that Merton had been Daniel Doom and that Wilton, having hunted for so long to find him, finally killed him in vengeance of his father. The group becomes conflicted and angry, and Brown comments on the necessity of consistency in the case, pausing to mention that by now, Wilton is long gone. The Oracle of the Dog In the beginning of this story, Father Brown is petting a dog, next to a young man named Fiennes. The young man informs him of a recent murder and shows him a newspaper clipping describing the details of the case. A man named Colonel Druce was murdered in his summer home on the coast of Yorkshire. Apparently, he was stabbed to death in his room, but the murder weapon is nowhere to be found. His son, daughter, and secretary all had no idea the murder took place, despite the home having only one entrance down a straight path through the garden. A man named Dr. Valentine (fiance of Miss Druce) was nearby and Druce's lawyer Aubrey Traill had just met with the Colonel, and both confirmed this story as well. Shortly after Traill met with the Colonel, his daughter came in to see him, only to find his body on the ground. Fiennes reveals he had been walking a dog with Druce's nephews (Herbert and Harry) near the summer house when the man was murdered. He describes the secretary and the lawyer to Brown, and then goes on to tell of how ominous the walk felt and how the dog howled at just the moment before Druce's daughter found the body, when previously it had been chasing a walking stick that Harry Druce had thrown into the water. As Fiennes and the nephews neared the house, Fiennes reports that Traill was just leaving and looked happy when normally he was downcast or unpleasant. Just then the dog had started barking furiously at the lawyer, who seemed to flee away. The priest jumps up after this description and scolds Fiennes for being superstitious and believing that a dog could condemn a man. Fiennes argues by saying that the lawyer had a tie pin that potentially could have fit a stiletto into it. He then goes on to say that one of the nephews who was with him (Harry) had former training as a detective. Harry had seen the dog growl at a few people before, including the secretary (Patrick Floyd), and growling was a better predictor of a dog's anger than barking. Additionally, Harry had found blood on the shears Floyd was using to trim the garden at the time. At Brown's prompting, Fiennes further reveals that Traill had been in the house to help revise the Colonel's will and that the original witnesses of the signing were Dr. Valentine and the secretary. The secretary had gotten angry with Dr. Valentine for having changed his name at some point, which invalidated the will, to which Valentine made a comment attacking Americans. Druce was very angry at the doctor for this, and later Miss Druce and the doctor were seen whispering to each other something about murder. Brown suggests perhaps the couple had worked together to kill the Colonel (the will was primarily favoring the daughter), at which Fiennes is appalled. Brown says he cannot do much to actually uncover the situation, but that Fiennes should continue searching and perhaps speak again with Harry Druce. Several days later, Fiennes comes back, reporting Harry Druce to have committed suicide. Brown states that it was likely to have been the course of action after young Druce realized he had killed his uncle for nothing, after not having been written into the will. Fiennes is aghast and asks Brown to explain the murder. As Brown describes it, the change of name by the doctor was from a French noble's title to the old family surname (Brown had heard of the family before). As a point of French etiquette, he considered challenging the secretary to a duel because of the debate of his name, while the Colonel's daughter tried to dissuade him from this. Brown tells of how important the dog was to solving the crime, to which Fiennes remarks that it is surprising for him to suddenly trust in the instincts of a dog. The priest mentions that if people were not as superstitious about dogs as they were, then the animals could be used to actually help. He lays out the type of men that the secretary and the lawyer were: nervous, jumpy men; the type to scare suddenly and cut themselves on garden sheers when a girl screams, as well as the type that dogs would instinctively distrust. Dogs are very straightforward, he says. They bark at people they do not like and people are afraid of dogs that do not like them. However, the murderer would have no fear of a witness who could not talk. Moreover, dogs pursue with everything they have in themselves. So the whine for not having found the walking stick that Harry Druce threw into the water was most likely because the stick had sunk and could not be found. That is, it had to house a sword used to kill the Colonel. The Miracle of Moon Crescent The story opens with a man named Warren Wynd sorting letters in an apartment in the town of Moon Crescent. Wynd is described to have an uncanny gift for snap decisions (apparently there is a story of him being approached by three beggars, two of which he immediately sent away, the third going on to be a useful personal assistant of his). A millionaire oil magnate named Silas Vandam is with him in the room, along with Wynd's personal servant (Wilson) and private secretary (Fenner Collins). Soon, the man dismisses the three of them so he can attend to more work. In the hall, a man named Alboin comes to speak with Wynd. He speaks of a new atheist religion that Wynd will want to know about. The secretary refuses him access, along with Father Brown who mysteriously appears as part of the group, with no explanation. Brown insists on getting into the room to ensure Wynd is alright, due to having spoken with a man he had helped previously who called some curse down upon Warren Wynd and after doing so, fired a blank shot under Wynd's window. Brown insists on checking, and Alboin soon strides forward to simply open the door. However, inside, Wynd is gone. Soon they call the authorities and answer questions until nightfall, at which point they leave and walk around Moon Crescent together. As they look into the distance, they see what appears to be a broken branch in a tree, but as the group gets closer to it, they soon recognize it to be the body of Wynd, who apparently hanged himself on the tree. The police were soon pelting the group with questions again, making sure to avoid any superstition. Newspapers and magazines picked up the tale too, and attempted to give nearly the exact opposite effect, raving of Father Brown's mysterious intuition and the superstitions involved in the group. The police hired a famous psychologist named Dr. Vair to speak with the witnesses in order to more accurately assess what happened in the events of Wynd's death. The professor begins to interrogate the group (without Father Brown) and attempts to convince them that Brown pulled some sort of trick in order to convince them to believe in a supernatural manner of Wynd's death. Collins becomes fed up with these accusations of their apparent lunacy or whatever else, and brings the rest of the group to talk with the priest about why the events happened the way they did. They bring Father Brown in to Wynd's office a few days later to sign an official report of a miracle. They want Brown to sign first as an honor for having spotted it first; he politely refuses. The group is confounded and asks why, and Father Brown explains the whole event was in fact natural. The shot, Brown explains, caused the victim to initially look out his window. Immediately, Wilson, who was a big strong man, from the floor above (where he was sent to collect papers) slipped a noose around Wynd's neck and hoisted him up, killing him. An unknown third man likely helped to get the body out to the tree, far away from the apartment, where the group found him hanging. As Brown reveals, these men were likely the three homeless men that Wynd sized up many years ago and passed off without having known them. The Curse of the Golden Cross This mystery starts in the Moravia, a ship travelling to England. Immediately introduced are Professor Smaill and Lady Diana Wales, along with the ship's register, Paul Tarrant. Also sitting at the table, Chesterton says, are Father Brown and a man named Leonard Smyth. The group has a conversation on the Byzantine empire, Smaill's specialty, and at the end, Brown points out that the professor mostly avoided the subject altogether. The professor seems to instantly trust Brown and launches into a description of some recently discovered tomb in Sussex. In it was found a special cross that has great importance to history, but a fabled curse as well. However, as he describes it, the curse seems more likely a conspiracy. Smaill jumps into another tale of his own golden cross, the only one similar to the other that has just been uncovered. Upon finding it in a labyrinth in Greece, Smaill realized there was a man following him in the ancient catacombs. The man threatened him and promised that someday he would murder the professor, were the cross not given up. Every now and then, the man still sends the professor notes to tell him that the plans for murder are going well. Smaill describes him as a cold, methodical man, likely from the West, due to the detached sense of a collector simply trying to find the prize. With the discovery of the new cross, the mad-man apparently increased his threats sevenfold and is desperate that Smaill never get his hands on the second cross. The professor and the priest disembark to go to the tomb and upon arriving, find the entire group from the dinner table already at the tomb with them. The group meets with the Vicar of the church under which the tomb was found, and begins to explore the dark caverns leading to the golden cross. They finally reach the room in which the cross is held, and just as Smaill reaches out to touch the cross, the large stone slab of the coffin the cross is lying in slams shut, smashing the professor painfully in the head. It is found out, after the professor is taken to a nearby doctor, that the Vicar has committed suicide. Father Brown goes to speak with the dinner party group, who then is ranting about the curse and how it will destroy them all. Brown dismisses this notion and tells of the falsehoods in the history of the stories associated with the tomb. Additionally, the cross seemed to be rigged to a small wooden peg that was holding the casket open. When the professor pulled the cross, the peg fell out, shutting the coffin, and hitting him in the head. But Brown reveals it was really the vicar who had been in the coffin; the maniac who had been pursuing Smaill thought that he had finally committed the murder and wanted to end his own life abruptly. Smaill recovers after a while and the group is able to go on with their lives in peace. The Dagger with Wings The renowned priest is called up one day by a doctor/ policeman named Dr. Boyne. A man named Aylmer had three sons and an adopted son named John Strake; when he died, he left a great fortune to Strake, but the three sons disputed the case with the law and managed to get the inheritance. Strake swore he would kill all three, and so far two are dead. Arnold Aylmer is the last alive and he is requesting police protection. The other two brothers died of apparent suicide or accident, but there is a chance Strake had managed to simply kill them masterfully and get away with it. Aylmer is now demanding police protection after his servants left because of his increasing agitation and impatience. Boyne admits that Father Brown is called in to be a compromise to Aylmer's demand. When Brown gets to the mansion, it is dark and lonesome. He cannot get in, nor does there appear to be anyone at home. The place appears to have been barricaded. Finally, Father Brown manages to climb in through a window and is immediately confronted by a ragged Aylmer. The two begin to speak, and Aylmer recounted the deaths of both of his brothers and seeing a shadowy figure before their deaths, near the scenes of their murders. On the body of both men, notes were found with winged daggers on the notes, similar to threatening notes they had received before. Aylmer brings the priest another note he had recently received with similar design and shows off a blunderbuss capable of firing silver bullets. He speaks a good deal about superstition and when he goes upstairs to get a picture of Strake to show Brown, the priest calls the police office to request backup. Suddenly, there is a shout and the sound of gunfire, and Father Brown finds himself soon standing over the body of Strake along with Aylmer, who apparently shot him in some sort of confused vision of some sort. The man is satisfied that he has finally killed the apparent murderer of his brothers and goes back into his house to have a drink. Aylmer tries then incessantly to convince Brown of some sort of universal existence among all things, which Brown denies. The priest then convicts Aylmer as the true John Strake for having killed the last of the brothers, just as the police arrive to detain Strake, who is even boastful of his murders. As Boyne probes for answers, Brown uncovers the murder. Just as Brown had been entering the house, Strake had killed the last brother. He quickly swapped clothing and being much larger than Aylmer, hung the body in a cloak on the hat-stand, putting a hat over the head to cover it up. Then he put on the victim's nightgown in order to pretend to be Aylmer, and went down to meet Brown.

The character was created by then head writers Marlene McPherson and Darrell Ray Thomas, Jr. Introduced under executive producers, Lisa De Cazotte and Greg Meng in 2012 as the previously unmentioned son of Celeste Perrault, and younger half-brother of popular character Dr. Lexie Carver. The role was originated by Schuyler Yancey, but was quickly recast with Owens who made his debut in late 2012. In addition to joining the staff at the local hospital, Cameron is also a romantic interest for Abigail Deveraux and romantic rival of her ex-boyfriend, Chad DiMera. Cameron's most controversial storyline involved the character's secret life, moonlighting as a male stripper to help his mother make ends meet and to pay back student loans. In late 2013, Owens departed the series and his character was written out. Creation=Background Schuyler Yancey gave some background on the character in an interview where he revealed that Cameron is taken away from Celeste at the age of 5, and raised by [yet to be named] father. Cameron longs for a familial connection because his father kept him away in boarding schools, so he grew very lonely. Upon the character's introduction, he and Celeste have recently reconnected. Initial speculation point to Lexie's father, Stefano DiMera (Joseph Mascolo). Schuyler Yancey revealed in an interview that his original uncredited role as Bryan, the bartender at The Brady Pub which began airing on July 22, 2010 and appears on a recurring basis until September 2011 was retconned into the role of Cameron. Casting In February 2012, Schuyler Yancey was cast in the role of Dr. Cameron Davis. Yancey made his debut on the April 5, 2012 episode. Supermodel, turned actor, known for his appearance as Rihanna's love interest the California King Bed music video, Nathan Owens began taping the role in late September, in secret. On October 1, 2012, several sources, including Soap Opera Digest confirmed that Owens had joined the cast. Owens was spotted on set for the show's 12, 000th episode during a press conference. However, the producers refused to comment on the role Owens would be playing. The actor himself later confirmed through his own personal Facebook that he had been cast in the role of Cameron. Owens's Instagram message about the casting was believed to be an accident. Soaps In Depth later confirmed that Owens would make his first appearance on the December 21 as a replacement for Yancey. However, due to news coverage of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Davis first air date was postponed to December 24, 2012. Owens found out about the role through his manager. In an interview, Owens revealed that he went out for the role of Rodney. He worked with casting director, Marnie Saitta and went through several tests. Owens admitted that he had a good feeling about the casting because he was given several opportunities to go over the material. Saitta called him back shortly after his test and told Owens to come back in a few days. He went back and forth a few times before he met with the producers and tested with Kate Mansi who portrayed Abigail. Owens signed on to play Cameron and beat out 15 other actors for the role. Owens admitted to being hesitant about replacing someone, though Yancey was only in the role for a short period of time, people had already gotten used to him, and Owens said that he felt like he was under a magnifying glass when he started, and that the potential critics made him a bit nervous. On September 21, 2013, at Kate Mansi's birthday party, Owens announced his departure from the series and revealed that he would last air in November. Development Soap Opera Digest revealed that Yancey's Cameron would play a key role in the upcoming storyline featuring Celeste Perrault (Beverly Todd) and Lexie Carver (Renée Jones). According to Owens, with the recast, the character of Cameron would develop an edge and bring more excitement; not unstable, just edgier. In an interview with Soapdom.com, Owens revealed that Cameron has issues that need to be explored. The actor explained that the character has \\"skeletons\\" in his closet and those secrets will eventually bring him to a breaking point. Owens drew on personal experience to help him prepare for the role as he also faced issues with his family — Cameron has to develop a sense of family and what it means to him because he does not grow up in the \\"ideal\\" family. Owens also avoided seeing clips of Yancey's portrayal to make sure he could put his own spin on the character. However, he did take the opportunity to learn more about the cast members and Days as a whole. Cameron wants a relationship with his late sister, Lexie's family, the DiMeras because he longs for familial acceptance, something he did not grow up with. According to Owens, Cameron has strong feelings for Abigail and does not see her ex, Chad DiMera (Casey Jon Deidrick) as an obstacle. Owens revealed that he hoped for the chance to work with the veteran Mascolo as Stefano.  Storylines  Cameron arrives in Salem in April 2012 and bumps into Abigail Deveraux who helps him track down his half-sister, Lexie Carver at the hospital. Cameron is shocked to learn that Lexie has an inoperable brain tumor. Cameron and Abby bump into one another again when he is working the bar at the Brady pub; he explains that he sometimes helps out when they are short staffed; as Cameron and Abby tease one another, they develop an attraction. Lexie's other half-brother, Chad DiMera and his girlfriend, Melanie decide to show Cameron around and he ends up on a double date with Abby where he saves her from choking on popcorn. Meanwhile, Lexie's health continues declining and Cameron promises to spend more time with his nephew Theo before and after Lexie is gone. Celeste notices the growing closeness between Cameron and Abby, and warns Cameron that she will only cause him trouble. Despite Celeste's warnings, the two begin seeing each other and share their first kiss in late May 2012. In June 2012, Abby comforts Cameron when Lexie passes away, much to Celeste's dismay. Instead of going back home, Cameron chooses to relocate to Salem permanently, mainly to stay close to Theo and Abby, despite Celeste warning him against getting involved with her. However, Abby is afraid to get too serious with Cameron believing he will eventually leave town. In early July, Cameron assures her that he is staying in Salem for several reasons, but mainly so they can be together. Cameron supports Abby when her father Jack suddenly dies. During her grief, Abby struggles with her emotions and has trouble being intimate with him. Realizing Abby needs to get help before their relationship can go any further, Cameron breaks up with her. During the holidays, Cameron and Chad bond over their memories of Lexie. Cameron later rekindles his relationship with Abby but when she admits to him that she has feelings for her ex Chad, he gives her time to choose between them, just as they both compete for Abigail's affection. On 9 August 2013, after doing a test on Chad, Cameron finds out that Chad has a brain tumor, he requests Cameron to keep it a secret, to which he agrees. Just as Abigail makes up her choice and is about to choose Cameron, he breaks things off with her and pushes her to Chad's arms. In September 2013, at the hospital, Maxine tells Cameron she's glad Abigail has someone to lean on with everything she's going through right now. He admits they're just friends and looks deflated. Maxine's sorry she assumed. He leaves. She can tell he's got it bad for Abby. In the square Gabi walks by, she drops her books and Cameron sees. He helps pick them up. Nick walks over, picks up Gabi's bag and hands it to Cameron saying \\"You missed one.\\" It's awkward. He leaves and goes back to the hospital and texts Chad. They need to talk. Maxine tells Cam to find Gabi in the waiting room. She has questions about her brother's therapy. Cameron heads over and overhears Abigail tell Gabi she and Chad 'did it'. He shakes his head and looks upset. Cameron decides to pay Chad a visit and asks how could he lie to Abby and set her up? Chad notices his computer is open to the treatment search and feigns a headache. He closes the laptop as Cam gets him water. Chad apologizes that he had to lose in this situation. Cameron's worried about Abigail's vulnerability. Chad says Abby wanted it and gives him a reason to live. Cameron won't say how he found out but agrees to stay out of it. Chad realizes Cameron loves her. Cameron only says Abby's his friend and he cares for them both before going back to the hospital where he bumps into Abby and they share an awkward moment. Reception Nathan Owens's picture message fed into speculation that he was replacing Yancey as Cameron. Fans immediately take to Owens as Cameron with some immediately wanting to know when he would appear shirtless. Greg In Hollywood said that Owens was just another \\"hunky\\" reason for viewers to watch Days. Owens revealed that he was worried about the recast because he was unsure of how he would be received. Mark Willows of Soapdom.com described the character as a \\"man of mystery.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Category:Days of Our Lives characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2012 Category:Fictional physicians Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Cameron Davis (Days of Our Lives)"},{"id":"41018896","text":"Frog City, Rhode Island is a village (not a city) in Johnston, Rhode Island within another village of Thornton, Rhode Island and according to one source was \\"probably termed Frog City because of the numerous frogs along the Pocasset River and ponds near Victoria Mill at Mill Street and Victoria Mount.\\"FROG CITY Old Mill Tap, Frog City The British Hosiery Mill, later known as the Priscilla Worsted Mill was built in Frog City in 1884, and the Victoria Mill on John Street was the largest of the mills in the area.Rhode Island's Mill Villages: Simmonsville, Pocasset, Olneyville, and Thornton by Joe Fuoco, (Arcadia Publishing, Mar 1, 1997) pg. 12  References  Category:Villages in Providence County, Rhode Island ","title":"Frog City, Rhode Island"},{"id":"41018936","title":"2013–14 Arkansas State Red Wolves men's basketball team"},{"id":"41018981","title":"2013–14 Northern Illinois Huskies men's basketball team"},{"id":"41018983","text":"Jarral () is one of the 57 Union council of Abbottabad District in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan.

It covers , including the Baisley Pond in the center of the park. It is maintained by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation.  Description  The park is a popular place for sports and other forms of outdoor recreation. Facilities include barbecuing areas, baseball fields, basketball courts, bicycle paths, cricket fields, fitness equipment, a football field, handball courts, five children's playgrounds, a running track, a soccer field, spray showers, and tennis courts. Several parts of the park have free Wi-Fi. The Sutphin Playground is notable for its sculpture of an American mastodon, an extinct elephant-like animal, recalling a time in the 1850s when workers dredging the pond found the bones of an individual mastodon that lived in the area almost 10,000 years ago, just after the end of the last ice age. The Mother Carter Garden, which is surrounded by an ornamental fence and has seating with views of the pond, memorializes Laura “Mother” Carter (1914-1999), a beloved community leader. Several events take place in the park, most notably the annual Southern Queens Gospel Festival, the eighth of which took place in July 2013. Pond The pond is a natural waterway located in the center of the park's three discontinuous tracts. The northern part of the pond was fed by Beaver Brook and Jamaica Creek, which in turn were respectively derived from Beaver Pond and One-Mile Pond. The park's northernmost tract dips slightly, a remnant of the two streams that converged there. Additionally, Riders Creek entered the pond from the eastern side. To the south, the pond enters Cornell Creek, which flows into Jamaica Bay. The construction of John F. Kennedy International Airport and the JFK Expressway made the creek subterranean, depressed underground and diverted southeast. A bridge and a boathouse were both proposed for the pond, but never built. The pond itself hosts diverse fauna and flora. It is known for its lily pads which shelter American Bullfrogs. The Parks Department lists three turtle species (red-eared slider, snapping turtle, and musk turtle). Fish species include several of interest to anglers, including largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, pumpkinseed, brown bullhead, and common carp. Many species of water birds favor the pond. Summer species include great egret, snowy egret, great blue heron, and double-crested cormorant. In winter the waterfowl population is especially large and diverse, with several species that are less common in the area, such as American wigeon, redhead duck, and grebes, mixing with more common species like mallard and Canada goose. History A row of stone frog statues graces the southeastern shore of Baisley Pond. Baisley Pond hosts a large and diverse population of waterfowl in winter. Baisley Pond is located in the Jamaica Bay watershed of western Long Island, where the intersection of 130th Avenue and 150th Street would be. It was formed in the 18th century, when local farmers dammed three streams to power a grain mill. It was named for David Baisley, a farmer who owned the mill in the early 19th century. In 1852, the burgeoning City of Brooklyn acquired the pond from Baisley for its new water system. On April 6, 1858, while draining the lake for use as a reservoir, the remains of an American mastodon (similar to a mammoth) were discovered at the bottom of the pond. The remains included bones and teeth. By that year, water from the pond was being transported through the Ridgewood Aqueduct (or \\"conduit\\") and then pumped uphill to the Ridgewood Reservoir, from which it was distributed to Brooklyn neighborhoods. As the city grew this water system was expanded to include additional bodies of water in what are today Queens and Nassau counties. Eventually farmers in this area complained that the local water table was being depleted. In 1898, after Brooklyn became a borough of the City of New York, the pond was connected to New York's larger and more reliable upstate water system, and the old Brooklyn system, including Baisley Pond, was no longer used as a water source. New York City transferred the northern section of the park, including the pond, to the Parks Department in 1914 and opened it to the public in 1919. At this time the surrounding area was still rural. However, it developed rapidly in the 1920s with the building of new houses and streets. In the 1930s, during the Great Depression, the Parks Department under Robert Moses built additional recreational facilities with the help of the Works Progress Administration, including a boat landing, playgrounds, tennis courts, and baseball fields. The \\"Southern Extension\\" of the park, located south of Rockaway Boulevard, remained undeveloped and neglected until 1984, when new sports facilities were built.

Origins and influences  Summerhill, the model for the first American free schools, pictured in 1993 As disenchantment with social institutions spread with the 1960s counterculture, alternative schools sprouted outside the local public school system. Funded by tuition and philanthropic grants, they were created by parents, teachers, and students in opposition to contemporaneous schooling practices across the United States and organized without central organization, usually small and grassroots with alternative curricula. Their philosophical influence stemmed from the counterculture, A. S. Neill and Summerhill, child-centered progressive education of the Progressive Era, the Modern Schools, and Freedom Schools. Influential voices within the movement included Paul Goodman, Edgar Z. Friedenberg, Herb Kohl, Jonathan Kozol, and James Herndon, with titles such as A. S. Neill's 1960 Summerhill, George Dennison's 1969 The Lives of Children, and Jonathan Kozol's 1972 Free Schools. The movement's transference of ideas was tracked through the New Schools Exchange and American Summerhill Society. The definition and scope of schools self-classified as \\"free schools\\" and their associated movement were never clearly delineated, and as such, there was a wide variation between schools. The movement did not subscribe to a single ideology, but its \\"free schools\\" tended to fall into the binaries of either utopian cultural withdrawal from external concerns, or built on the legacy of freedom schools with direct political address of social injustices. This dichotomy was also seen in the type of students the school attracted with the former usually white, middle class students and the latter usually poor, black, and inner-city. Some schools practiced participatory democracies for self-governance. The \\"free schools\\" movement was also known as the \\"new schools\\" or \\"alternative schools movement\\". Author Ron Miller defined the free school movement's principles as letting families choose for their children, and letting children learn at their own pace.  Growth  Allen Graubard charted the growth of the free schools from 25 in 1967 to around 600 in 1972, with estimates of 200 created between 1971 and 1972. These schools had an average enrollment of 33 students. Almost all of the first American free schools were based on Summerhill and its associated book. Many of the schools were started in nontraditional locations, including parks, churches, and abandoned buildings. The movement peaked in 1972 with hundreds of schools opened and public interest in open education.  Decline and legacy  The movement subsided with the rise of 1970s conservatism, particularly due to the Nixon administration's education policies. The Huffington Post wrote in 2012 that \\"the movement is revving up again\\", citing Education Revolution's listing of over 100 free schools in America. The schools are mostly private in America, and generally serve middle and upper-middle-class families. Author Ron Miller credits the rise of standardization with grassroots interest in alternative schools. CBS News reported in 2006 that the remaining free schools, while unknown in number, are \\"democratic\\", as the students share in the school's governance. Education historian Diane Ravitch said in 2004 that these schools function best for students from educated families due to the free schools' emphasis on individual contribution. Victoria Goldman of The Manhattan Family Guide to Private Schools and Selective Public Schools and E. D. Hirsch, Jr. echoed similar thoughts, with Hirsch adding that \\"it doesn't work for children who haven't had those advantages.\\" Ravitch believed that the free schools' values would conflict with predominant student testing trends.

John Liggins (11 May 1829 – 8 January 1912) was an English-born Episcopalian missionary to China and Japan. The first Protestant missionary and ordained representative of Anglican Communion to reach Japan, together with his seminary classmate Channing Moore Williams, he helped found the Nippon Sei Ko Kai.  Background and early life  Liggins was born in 1829 in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England. In 1841, following the death of his father, Liggins emigrated to the United States of America, initially residing in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was among 14 people confirmed at Emmanuel Episcopal Church in Philadelphia's then-developing Holmesburg neighborhood by Alonzo Potter on April 4, 1848.Church records on ancestry.com  Missionary in China  In June 1855, Liggins graduated from the Virginia Theological Seminary (VTS) at Alexandria, Virginia, which had sent several missionaries to China to assist VTS graduate bishop William J. Boone after that country opened to foreigners following the First Opium War. Virginia bishop William Meade on July 1, 1855 ordained Liggins as a deacon, together with Williams and other classmates, and soon the Board of Foreign Missions in New York interviewed and accepted both Liggins and Williams as missionaries. In November of the same year they sailed for China around South America, the ship stopping in Rio de Janeiro to repair damage, and Sydney, Australia to reprovision.Beverley D. Tucker, Channing Moore Williams: Apostle to Japan, 1829-1910 (bound manuscript dated 2000) pp. I-15 Liggins arrived in Shanghai on June 28, 1856, and attended morning prayer in Chinese the next day (a Sunday) at the Church of Our Saviour,http://www.virtualshanghai.net/Data/Buildings?ID=432 which Boone had established (together with a boarding school). Then they visited the city's other Episcopal Church, Christ Church in the city's Chinese section. They needed to learn the local dialect, as well as Mandarin (the main dialect) and the literary language Wen-li—although dictionaries were poor, textbooks unavailable, and most Chinese teachers focused on Confucian classics and memorizing thousands of characters. Boothe, Cleveland Keith (who had arrived in 1851) and local teachers helped the young missionaries, who studied nine hours daily. Soon, Liggins substituted for the British chaplain, John Hobson, who ministered to foreign sailors and the British settlement at Trinity Church. More seasoned VTS graduates (class of 1845) Robert Nelson and Edward Syle allowed the young missionaries to accompany them as they were able. Before Boone returned to the United States for health and furlough, he ordained both to the priesthood on January 11, 1857.Tucker, pp. 2-1 to 2-5 Soon, Liggins and the others began to preach, including on boat journeys outside Shanghai, especially after Keith and his wife returned to Hawaii for health reasons later in the year. Liggins and Williams realized that of the roughly 20 missionaries sent during the previous decade, half had left before their own arrival, due to fevers (Shanghai being in the delta of the Yangtze River and surrounded by rice fields), and rough conditions. The countryside was ambiguous about foreigners, and smarting from the defeat in the First Opium War. Many were curious about Western ways, but slavery, gambling, alcoholism, and opium addiction had also become problems that some Western merchants fostered (especially near Canton). The Taiping Rebellion (1850-1864) had begun and in 1853 captured Nanjing only 200 miles from Shanghai. Its leader proclaimed himself as the younger brother of Jesus Christ and fought the ruling Manchus (whom he portrayed as devils), and also preached about the equality of women, communal ownership and revitalized ethics. On October 2, 1857, Liggins and Williams started on a missionary journey of about 12 days toward Suzhou, about 100 miles from Nanjing. Sometimes they preached jointly near temples and their pamphlets and books were well received; at other times the young missionaries (alone or jointly) faced hostile audiences which drove them back into their boat. Liggins suffered health problems as November began, so Williams proceeded alone on the next journey.Tucker, pp. 2-5 to 2-18 Nonetheless, they both traveled (together with their Chinese teacher Mr. Wong whom Nelson had converted) toward Changshu (Dzang Zok), a city of about 100,000 people, about 70 miles northwest of Shanghai in February 1858. They preached, including on Chinese New Year's Day, and confirmed Nelson's suggestion that it might be a good place to establish a mission, and accordingly wrote Boone for permission in May. However, a week after they received accommodation at a temple in February, a police officer advised the priest who gave them shelter not to harbor foreign devils. Before they returned in June, Britain's gunboat diplomacy had led to the Treaty of Tientsin. While Changshu's mayor was interested in their preaching (and became their new landlord), and many others also wanted the missionaries to stay, other Mandarin officials opposed them. On April 5, 1859, Liggins was in Changshu during a festival known for disorder (which they had avoided the previous year), thinking locals had accepted them. A mob broke into their house, beat him and stole many items. Williams arrived five days later and took his incapacitated friend back to Shanghai for medical treatment. A medical missionary who had recently returned from Nagasaki, Japan (recently opening to Westerners after less-martial American gunboat diplomacy, a visit from Syle and appointment of active Episcopalian Townsend Harris as first American consul in 1856) recommended that Liggins go there to recover and teach English.Tucker, pp. 2-11 to 2-13, 2-19 to 2-21, 2-26 to 2-27  Missionary in Japan  Liggins arrived in the port of Nagasaki on May 2, 1859, two months before the official opening of the foreign settlement. By month-end he received a letter from the Foreign Missions Committee in New York officially sending him and Williams to Japan, as he later noted in the Spirit of Mission. Liggins thus became the first recorded Protestant missionary to arrive in Japan after the country ended over two centuries of self-imposed isolation. available at available at (PDF) Williams arrived in Nagasaki on June 29. Liggins (and later Williams) was initially housed at Kotokuin within Shofukuji Temple since the official foreign settlement was not yet ready. Liggins immediately began teaching English to Japanese interpreters. However, the new Nagasaki bugyo, in line with centuries of official government policy, forbad him to teach Christianity. His religious duties (and later Williams') were thus mainly limited to ministering to American and British residents of the foreign settlement and visiting sailors. Religious texts could not be openly distributed, but the sale of academic publications afforded Liggins and Williams some engagement with eager Japanese purchasers on matters relating to Christian teaching. While in Nagasaki, Liggins prepared a book entitled One Thousand Familiar Phrases in English and Japanese, one of the first books of its kind published in Japan.Tucker, pp. 3-1 to 3-Edward Abbot, Japan and the Nippon Sei Kokwai, A Sketch of the Work of the American Episcopal Church (Church Missions Publishing Company, Hartford, CT,1900) available at However, a cholera epidemic struck fast-growing Nagasaki by September. In October 1859 Presbyterian missionaries Dr. and Mrs. James Curtis Hepburn also arrived in Nagasaki from Shanghai, but chose to continue by boat, eventually settling in Kanagawa. Liggins' health problems returned, so on February 24, 1860 he set sail from Nagasaki for the United States. Liggins never again set foot in Japan, although he only resigned his missionary post in 1869 due to continued ill health.1891 historical sketch  Later years and death  Returning to America, Liggins wrote, spoke and campaigned for the Temperance movement. He and Mary Liggins (either 1 or 2 years his senior) were recorded in New York City in the 1870 census and South Orange, Essex County, New Jersey in the 1880 census. At some point he became a naturalized American citizen. Liggins retired to Cape May, New Jersey where he spent the remaining years of his life, and was recorded in the 1900 and 1910 census as a bachelor living in a boarding house.U.S. Census records on ancestry.com He was a regular contributor to the letters page of the New York Times, such as his letter defending New York bishop Henry C. Potter (son of bishop Alonzo Potter who had confirmed him), who though abstaining from alcohol, recognized that the saloon had become a poor man's clubhouse because temperance societies did not provide attractive places where intoxicating drinks were not sold.New York Times, February 3, 1899 p. 6 Among Liggins' published works were: England's Opium Policy, A Missionary Picture Galler, and The Great Value and Success of Foreign Missions. Liggins died on January 8, 1912 in Ocean City, New Jersey (a stronghold of the temperance movement).Death Notice, New York Times (January 11, 1912) p. 13 His will was admitted to probate in Cape May County, New Jersey on August 17, 1911probate records on ancestry.com, Vol. H-K (1907-1915), p. 90  References  Category:1829 births Category:1912 deaths Category:English Anglican missionaries Category:Anglican missionaries in Japan Category:Virginia Theological Seminary alumni Category:Anglican missionaries in China Category:British expatriates in China Category:British expatriates in Japan Category:English emigrants to the United States ","title":"John Liggins"},{"id":"41019314","text":"Engineers Lake, a small oval-shaped lake, has a surface area of .

He was responsible for making the Israel Neurosurgical Society a member of both the European Neurosurgical Association and the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies. During his career, he served as a neurosurgeon, researcher, and professor in many areas of science and medicine including anatomy and neurosurgery. His scientific contributions laid the foundation for old and new generations of neurosurgical students who achieved high honors at the top of their profession, both in Israel and abroad.Gruber Ruth, Raquela, a woman of Israel, 1978, pg. 199-228, chap.20 July 1948 pg.273, printed in the United States of America. Library of Congress RC12327 Early life Professor Harden M. Askenasy was born in Bucharest, Romania to Mihail Askenasy, a merchant, and Buca née Leibovici, an art teacher. His parents only had one other child, a younger boy named Henry. During his early years, Askenasy was sent to a Christian primary school. Later, he was sent to the Realgymnasium Der Evangelischen Gemeide Zu Bukarest, from which he graduated in 1926. After graduation, Askenasy continued his education at the University of Montpellier in France. After Montpellier, he attended the University of Paris, where he received his Diplome de Docteur de Medicine in 1934. Medical training From 1933 to 1937, Askenasy worked on his neurosurgical residency at the Hospital de la Pitie. He had the luxury of working under the direction of Professor Clovis Vincent, a legendary French neurosurgeon. He had the chance to work amongst many other renowned scientists and physicians during his residency, such as Gerard Guiot, P. Puech, Jean Talairach, Marcel David, and Count Thierry De Martel. All were heralded as neurosurgical leaders throughout France and the world for their scientific contributions. The field of neurosurgery began to grow during Askenasy’s tenure in France, with many neurologists and neurosurgeons paving the way in the development of surgical practices. During his residency, Askenasy discovered the use of sulphur amides followed by cystic lesion puncture to treat brain abscesses. This therapy avoided the need of an early surgical procedure to remove infected areas of the brain. It was considered the first minimally invasive surgical therapy technique used to treat brain abscesses, replacing the need of craniotomies to treat acute cerebrates. Sulfur amides revolutionized brain abscess therapy, and their use along with modern antibiotics is still being practiced today. Along with Professor Clovis Vincent and Marcel David, Askenasy described the association of brain tumors with psychiatric disease, and the associations of the vascular brain stem lesion with ataxia and astereognosis. In 1937 he continued his studies at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, USA, with the famed American neurosurgeon Walter Dandy. During the following year, Askenasy had the opportunity to travel around the United States and Canada, visiting and working in some of the most prominent centers for neurosurgery. He even had the opportunity to meet Harvey Cushing, the pioneer and father of American neurosurgery. During his tenure, Askenasy completed additional neurosurgical training as a fellow in the U.S.A. and Canada at Lahey Clinic with Gilbert Horrax (Boston, MA), Mayo Clinic with Alfred Adson (Rochester, MN), University of Illinois at Chicago with Paul Bucy (Chicago, IL), University of Chicago with Percival Bailey (Chicago, IL), McGill University with Wilder Penfield (Montreal, Quebec, Canada), University of Michigan with Max M. Peet (Ann Arbor, MI), and the University of Pennsylvania with Charles Frazier (Philadelphia, PA). During his training with Walter Dandy, Dr. Askenasy learned trigeminal nerve vascular decompression of the cranial nerve entry zone. It was after his visit with Charles Frazier that he became convinced that the resection of the Gasserian Ganglion was a better technique than vascular decompression. Professional career In 1939, Dr. Askenasy arrived in Romania and took a position as a neurosurgeon at the Jewish Hospital in Bucharest. Life soon became very difficult for Askenasy as a Jewish man during World War II. Anti-Semitism, including the infamous Iron Guard, began to take a more sinister form. There was widespread persecution that included dismissing Jews from their jobs, non- hiring of Jews, beatings, and public hanging of Jews. Dr. Askenasy could not escape the atrocities surrounding him. In 1940, Askenasy became a Professor of Anatomy and studied the nervous system at the College for Jewish Students in Bucharest. Not long after, he was exiled to Transnistria on the Ukrainian border, together with hundreds of thousands of Romanian Jews. They were all sent there to die from disease and hunger. While they were in the camp, Askenasy was obligated to clean the extremely dirty community bathroom (latrine), creating a traumatizing memory for him. In 1943 he returned to the Neurological Department at the Hospital of the Red Cross in Bucharest because of the need for neurologists. In 1946, after World War II, he returned to his academic endeavors that had been previously interrupted. He decided that it was best for him and his family to go to Palestine, the historic land of the Jewish people. When Jewish citizens were selected to leave Romania on Christmas Eve, his and his wife’s names were not called on the list. This was because Dr. Askenasy was a precious asset to the post-war government due to his medical expertise. However, after a meeting with the Interior Minister of Romania, Teohari Giorgescu, he was granted permission to leave with his wife and family. Professor Askenasy departed Bucharest, Romania by boat, the “Pan- York”, where he was able to smuggle his neurosurgical instruments. After departing from Bulgaria, the English Royal Navy diverted the ship to a refugee camp in Famagusta, Cyprus on January 2, 1948. However, the Haganah organization granted him and his wife English immigration certificates under the false names of Mr. Jacob and Mrs. Rivka Schwartz so that they could leave the camp. The Mossad Le’Aliya Bet managed to arrange false documents from allies that helped them to arrive in Haifa, Palestine aboard the “Kedma Haganah Ship” on February 19, 1948. After the Second World War, England had organized chaos in order to destroy all Jewish institutions and promote tension amongst them and the Arab community. Deception, delays, and misinformation were common factors of post-World War II British mandates over Jerusalem. Chaos and inter-religion fighting between the Jewish and Arabs were promoted in other to divide and conquer. British Prime minister Clement Attlee, who was the leader of the Labor Party (1945–1951) can be blamed for the inhumane care of the Jewish inmate concentration camps in Europe, which included food and water blockades and especially blockades for foot entry to Jerusalem. Permit certificate was required to enter into Palestine. Abuse of authority led England to detain members of the Jewish community. Dr. Askenasy arrived in Israel two years after the departure of the only neurosurgeon at the time, Dr. Henry Wigderson (Montefiore Medical Center, New York). He was heavily recruited at Beilinson Hospital by Dr. Chaim Sheba. Soon after arriving in Palestine, he accepted the offer to work at the Hospital on March 24, 1948. For the next 27 years, he would work as a neurosurgeon under the Kupat Holim Clalit health service organization, providing the best modern neurosurgery and all of its sub-specialties relating to brain and spinal cord disorders. The treatments that he provided during the next decade increased as a result of soldiers injured in the war, civilians harmed in auto accidents, and victims injured during Arab terrorist attacks. In 1950 he became head of the Department of Neurosurgery within Beilinson Hospital’s new building, serving as the largest of its kind in Israel. The surplus in head trauma caused an influx of patients in a limited amount of space. Therefore, the Pediatric Department would also host neurosurgical cases when needed. Various articles about the successful Neurosurgery Department were frequently published in Israeli Newspapers. In addition to leading the Neurosurgical Department, he also began teaching students in 1950 and officially became a Professor of Neurosurgery at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1959. Askenasy also became a Professor of Neurosurgery at Tel Aviv University in 1963. In 1964, he was rewarded as a permanent member of the Tel Aviv University Senate. Personal life Professor Harden Askenasy married Nina née Sussmann before departing to Palestine. They remained married for 31 years until his death on July 19, 1975. Together, they gave birth to one child, a daughter named Karin Askenasy-Taub. Karin resides in Israel and is an advocate in establishing and maintaining her father's legacy. She has two children, a daughter named Dana Bensimon, born February 9, 1982 and a son named Tom Harden Mihail Askenasy Taub, born September 8, 1989. Professor Harden Askenasy dedicated much of his life to improving the scope of neurosurgery not only in Israel and the Middle East, but also internationally. He often came to the aid of other countries when his medical expertise was needed. Askenasy was also very generous, and even donated his precious neurosurgical instruments to Beilinson Hospital on two different occasions so that the department would be supplied with modern equipment. At that time, Palestine, like many other parts of the world, lacked modern medical instruments. Askenasy worked very hard to save lives during a destructive part of history in Israel, and he committed his practice to improving medical and neurosurgical science. Legacy In 1962 Professor Askenasy, together with Professor Ephraim Frei from the Weizmann Institute, developed a magnetic catheter (POD) for intra-arterial endovascular navigation to brain circulation. This approach was an early development for endovascular therapy and treatment of occlusion, cerebral arterial aneurysms, thrombolysis, and arterial venous malformations. Professor Askenasy researched the interaction between the 100 watt CO2 laser and brain tissue. This served as an analysis for its use to remove brain tumors. Professor Askenasy also studied the outcome of low level radiation on the development of intracranial meningiomas along the scalp to search for parasites in the heads of Jewish immigrants on their way to Palestine in the early 1920s-1930. It was discovered that application of low level radiation led to epilepsy. He also established a relationship between meningiomas, extrapyramidal disorder, and Parkinson's disease. The legacy of Professor Askenasy lingers on in the form of new generations of Israeli excellence in medicine and the reputation that Israeli surgeons have gained around the world. To this day, Israeli neurosurgeons are sought after in medical centers across the world as leaders and teachers, thanks to the foundation laid out by Professor Askenasy and many others during his generation. In spite of hardships experienced during the Holocaust, wars, and prevalent anti-Semitism, they rose from the ashes. Professor Askenasy was a neurosurgical pioneer in the Middle East. Along with his predecessors and successors, he provided an everlasting contribution to the fields of cutting-edge science and medicine. Professor Askenasy also played a major role in the research and development of the following: Minimally invasive therapy for brain abscesses, Endovascular Magnetic Catheter for cerebral artery catheterization, Minimally invasive Trans nasal esphynoidal Stereotactic radioactive Isotope selective implantation (Iridium, Gold, Yttrium); FL-18 Isotope for the detection of brain tumors; INDPTA (intravascular) for the detection of giant aneurysms; Stereotactic Singulectomy for intractable cancer pain; Radioactive Iodine 131 Serum Albumin early detection of cerebral hydrocephalus in mielomeningocele; Sulfonamides early treatment later followed by evacuation of the brain abscess.

Written by Matthew Hodgson and directed by Paul McCrane, it aired on Fox in the United States on November 28, 2013. The episode features the return of special guest star Demi Lovato as Dani, and of Adam Lambert as Elliott \\"Starchild\\" Gilbert. The reason why Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) always wears tracksuits is finally revealed. Plot Glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) is caught up with the school board's upcoming inspection of McKinley High and instructs the New Directions to brainstorm ideas for Nationals while he is unavailable. Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss) makes several suggestions that highlight him, and becomes offended when the others, aside from Jake Puckerman (Jacob Artist), reject his ideas and accuse him of being controlling. Angry and frustrated, Blaine storms out of the choir room and calls Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer), who warns Blaine not to force his ideas upon the others and become a \\"puppet master\\". Kurt also reveals he booked Pamela Lansbury's first gig at Callbacks, which Blaine promises to attend. Rachel Berry (Lea Michele), Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera), Dani (Demi Lovato) and Elliott \\"Starchild\\" Gilbert (Adam Lambert) disagree over the choice of venue, but are convinced by how Kurt envisions their first performance, in which they sing \\"Into the Groove\\". The school board visits McKinley ahead of the inspection to discuss with Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) the possibility of becoming full-time Principal, to which she agrees. She develops a crush on Superintendent Bob Harris (Christopher Cousins), and is disappointed to find out he thinks she is a man. Sue confides in Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter) that she changed her more feminine appearance and adopted her trademark tracksuits when she started working at McKinley, in order to be respected by the students. Becky then encourages Sue to embrace her femininity. Blaine refuses to perform due to the New Directions' treatment of him and sits in the back of the choir room. Due to a gas leak, he hallucinates that his friends are puppets who idolize him, and leads them in a rendition of \\"You're My Best Friend\\". Blaine later thanks Jake for supporting him and mentions his experience at the back of the choir room that he is unable to explain. Jake continues to choreograph the Cheerios' dance routines, and upsets Bree (Erinn Westbrook) by bragging about having sex with the entire cheerleading squad. Will wants Jake to create a dance number for Nationals, but he refuses, claiming the glee club is not up to par with his talents. Sitting at the back of the choir room at Blaine's suggestion, he then hallucinates performing a mash-up of \\"Nasty\\" and \\"Rhythm Nation\\". Like Blaine, he is later unable to explain his hallucination. Shortly afterwards, Bree tells Jake she is pregnant and wants him to accompany her to the doctor's appointment. Will offers to help Sue in exchange for additional money for the New Directions' Nationals wardrobe, but Sue refuses. While sitting in the back of the choir room, she hallucinates performing \\"Cheek to Cheek\\" with Will. Sue also confiscates a puppet of Kurt that Blaine made in crafts class due to him being unable to get over being called a \\"puppet master\\", and sends him to detention after he breaks into her office after hours to retrieve it, which prevents Blaine from attending Kurt's performance. He and Kurt get into a brief argument over the phone when Kurt finds out about the puppet, and Pamela Lansbury is later disappointed to discover the only person in their audience is a misguided old man hoping to meet Angela Lansbury. Blaine, Jake and Becky meet in detention, and Blaine has another hallucination that helps him realise his need to try and control the situation due to stress is the reason he is hallucinating about puppets. Blaine then covers for Jake while he prepares to take Bree to the hospital. Bree, however, announces she just had a pregnancy scare. Jake is relieved, but Bree warns him that his narcissism and promiscuous ways will have unwanted consequences and he is more or less doomed to repeat his father and older brother's mistakes if he doesn't change soon, and cuts ties with him due to his bad influence. Moved by her words, Jake apologizes to Marley Rose (Melissa Benoist) for his selfish behavior and tries to make amends with her. Though Marley harbors no ill feelings for him, she confesses she now only views him as a friend and leaves him heartbroken. Sue recruits Wade \\"Unique\\" Adams (Alex Newell) to help her, and impresses the school board, even fixing the gas leak. They promote her to full-time Principal, and Sue asks Harris out on a date, but he still refuses. Simultaneously, Kurt announces that the old man from their audience happened to be the uncle of a scout, who has booked them a second gig at a popular nightclub. As an apology for his behaviour, Blaine crafts puppets of all of his friends and presents them. To end this episode, The New Directions and Pamela Lansbury then simultaneously sing \\"The Fox\\". Production The episode was in production around the end of October, when co-creator Ryan Murphy tweeted pictures of the puppets being featured in the episode, including a picture of Criss as Blaine surrounded by puppets. Recurring characters in this episode include Santana's girlfriend and member of Kurt's band, Dani (special guest star Lovato), band member Elliott \\"Starchild\\" Gilbert (Lambert), McKinley cheerleaders Becky Jackson (Potter) and Bree (Westbrook), Lima schools superintendent Bob Harris (Cousins) and McKinley janitor and former principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba). Six songs from the episode are being released as five singles: Queen's \\"You're My Best Friend\\" sung by Criss; \\"Cheek to Cheek\\" from Top Hat performed by Morrison and Lynch; the Janet Jackson mashup \\"Nasty / Rhythm Nation\\" performed by Artist, Benoist and Westbrook; and Madonna's \\"Into the Groove\\" sung by Colfer, Lambert, Michele, Rivera and Lovato, and Ylvis's \\"The Fox\\" sung by the members of New Directions and Pamela Lansbury. Reception=Ratings The episode, which aired on Thanksgiving in the United States, was watched by 2.84 million viewers and received an 18-49 rating/share of 0.9/3, making it the lowest rated episode of the series to date. Critical reception The episode received mixed reviews from critics. Rae Votta of Billboard gave the episode a positive review, saying it \\"is pretty straight-forward in that it’s about control -- characters who want to control the world around them, characters who can't control the image thrust on them by others, and characters who want to control themselves. It’s clean, and relatively linear for all its wackiness. And it actually works. If only all of Glee could be this good.\\" She did, however, criticize the casts' performance of \\"The Fox (What Does the Fox Say?),\\" saying \\"it's absolutely batshit and nonsensical and yet somehow the perfect ending to an hour of gas- induced puppet, Janet Jackson and Fred Astaire related hallucinations.\\" Brandon Nowalk of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B-, saying \\"Clearly there’s new life in these characters—hell, old life in half of the New Directions—and low-key episodes like “Puppet Master” make great opportunities to explore and define them. Artists are certainly allowed to fail. Hopefully Glee starts failing bigger.\\" Miranda Wicker of TV Fanatic gave the episode a more negative review, rating it a 1.5 out of 5, saying \\"The good news is that they buried an otherwise ridiculous and silly episode on a night when (probably) no one was watching, what with all the tryptophan comas and shopping. The bad news is that Glee Season 5 Episode 7 was 45 minutes of my life I can never get back and very little about it was redeeming.\\" Samantha Highfill of Entertainment Weekly also received the episode negatively, saying \\"Overall, I think the episode was trying just a little too hard, and what maybe could have been cute (but probably not) forced me to watch most of the hour through squinted eyes, and not because I was tired from eating turkey.\\" ReferencesExternal links * \\"Puppet Master\\" at Fox.com * * Category:2013 American television episodes Category:Glee (season 5) episodes ","title":"Puppet Master (Glee)"},{"id":"41019466","text":"Mula (, also Romanized as Mūlā and Mowlā) is a village in Farim Rural District, Dodangeh District, Sari County, Mazandaran Province, Iran.

Biography Historical data about van der Goes’ life are scarce. He was together with Hans Witdoeck a pupil of Lucas Vorsterman during the years 1630–31. He was admitted as a master of the Guild of St. Luke of Antwerp in 1632–1633.Biographical details at the RKD He had three pupils: Alexander Goubau, Antonius Coolberger and Gaspard Leemans.Biographical details in H. HYMANS, Histoire de la gravure dans l’école de Rubens, Brussel, 1879, pp. 204, 408–13 He worked as an engraver for the leading Flemish painters of his age. In Rubens' studio he belonged to the 'new generation' of engravers with the likes of Hans Witdoeck. There are 18 engravings made by van der Goes on the basis of Rubens’ designs. The technique of van der Goes was more free than that of Vorsterman and was thus extremely well suited to the Rubens’ style. The burin is applied with great finesse and fairly tightly and preserves across the plate a transparency and lightness that allows van der Goes to achieve the correct effect through relatively tempered black tones. He also made engravings for other prominent painters such as Jacob Jordaens, Adriaen Brouwer, Hendrik Martenszoon Sorgh and Theodoor van Thulden. He signed all his engravings with Marinus. He died on 27 April 1639 in Antwerp and was buried in the local St. James' Church.De levens en werken der Hollandsche en Vlaamsche kunstschilders In the burial register of the parish he was referred to as 'Marin van der Goes'.Supplément au catalogue du Musée d'Anvers ReferencesBibliography * H.

Together with Evgeny Lifshitz and Vladimir Berestetskii, Lev Pitaevskii has also been the co-author of a few volumes of the influential Landau–Lifschitz Course of Theoretical Physics series. His academic status is professor. Education Pitaevskii was born on January 18, 1933, in Saratov. He graduated from Saratov State University in 1955. In 1958 he joined the staff of the Institute of Physical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences. In 1971 he became a professor at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. Research Collaborating with Vitaly Ginzburg, Pitaevskii developed a theory of superfluidity in the neighborhood of a transition point. He showed that, at sufficiently low temperatures, liquid helium-3 should undergo a transition to the superfluid state. Lev Pitaevskii was educated at the Landau school in Moscow. He was a PhD student of Lev Landau and during the first years of his scientific activity at the Institute for Physical Problems (now Kapitza Institute), he made contributions to the theory of condensed matter physics, including the most celebrated paper on quantized vortices where he developed what is now called the Gross–Pitaevskii theory of Bose–Einstein condensates, one of the theories more systematically used to describe the physics of ultracold atomic gases nowadays. Another famous paper was written in collaboration with Igor E. Dzyaloshinsky and Evgeny Lifshitz on the van der Waals forces where the theory of the thermal and quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field was developed in a systematic way with important implications on modern applications to solid state physics and atomic physics. Lev Pitaevskii started collaborating with the University of Trento at the end of the 1980s through a series of long term visits. After a few years spent at the Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa he eventually became professor of Trento University in 1998. Since then he is working in the Trento BEC team, a joint initiative of the Italian National Institute of Optics (part of CNR) in Italy and of the Physics Department of the University of Trento where is currently carrying out his scientific activity. Honors and awards *1980 – Landau Prize in recognition of his research in plasma physics, *2008 – Landau Gold Medal in recognition of his contributions to modern theoretical physics, including the theory of Bose condensation of the Gross–Pitaevskii and for his contribution to the writing of new and previously unreleased update parts of the world-famous course in theoretical physics Landau–Lifshitz.

In all those cases, the General Procurator's Office does not charge Tymoshenko's associates with «stealing or appropriating funds», none of them were charged with taking or paying bribes — mainly, they are accused of «abuse of office» and «exceeding official powers» (Articles 364 and 365 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine), see paragraph 2 of the PACE resolution of 27 January 2012. As for those cases, there exist several statements by the EU, the USA, the Human Right organizations, public organizations both within Ukraine and from Diaspora which indicate the political constituency of all those cases.

Assessment in USA  On October 5, 2010 in Kyiv, Drago Kos, the president of the Group of States against Corruption (GRECO), stated he saw no improvements in the country's anticorruption efforts since the Yanukovych government took office.

Overall assessment of the situation in Ukraine in 2010–2013  1 February 2013 former U.S. Ambassadors to Ukraine (William Green Miller — 1993–1998, Steven Pifer — 1998–2000, John Herbst — 2003–2006) recommend the new U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry not to meet with Viktor Yanukovych and insist on Kyiv's compliance with democratic standards. Ukraine is «slipping into authoritarianism», are contained in the new report «Assessment of risks around the world», which the Director of National Intelligence James Clapper presented to the U.S. Senate. Media have repeatedly reported that «Yanukovych regime» is actively using lobbyists in the EU-USA,The Yanukovych Administration's image in the West is made by Americans. Oleksandr Mykhelson. March 14, 2011. probably why, to date, to the regime of Yanukovych did not apply any sanctions by the EU and the U.S. «The Economist» wrote about the political situation in Ukraine (April 2013): * «With Viktor Yanukovych, a thuggish president, in charge and his arch-rival, Yulia Tymoshenko, in jail, Ukraine is clearly not a democracy. But it is not a dictatorship either… Oligarchs treat Ukraine as a cash cow… According to the Ukrainian edition of Forbes, companies linked to ten beneficiaries win 60% of all government contracts. The leader of the Forbes list is Alexander Yanukovych, the president's elder son… But politically Mr Yanukovych is not as strong as he seems… His defeat was most striking in Kyiv where the ruling party (Party of Regions) got under 13% of the vote (in October's parliamentary elections-2012)».  Assessment of criminal cases of Tymoshenko's associates in EU  On 13 January 2011, the Czech Republic «granted an asylum» to ex- Minister for economics Bohdan Danylyshyn.  Assessment in the United Kingdom  On 22 June 2010 (just before the beginning of the trial on Tymoshenko), British Ambassador in Uklraine Leigh Tuner gave an interview to Day newspaper in which he warned the Ukrainian authorities against persecution of the opposition: * «We are carefully watching the development of criminal prosecution of the former government officials…we are concerned about the allegedly political grounds lying these criminal cases…. By presently, we have clearly defined to the Ukrainian authorities that whatever selectivity and inadequacy in exercising legal prosecutions might significantly, and for a long term, spoil the international image of Ukraine».  Six Resolution of Europarliament on cases of Yulia Tymoshenko and other officials of former government  Within the period of 2010–2012, the European Parliament adopted six resolutions as regards the criminal cases of Tymoshenko and her associates. On June, 9th 2011, the European Parliament approved a very important resolution on Ukraine — «Cases of Yulia Tymoshenko and other officials of the former government»: * «having regard to its previous resolutions on Ukraine and particularly that of 25 November 2010… having regard to the Statement of its President on the detention of Yulia Tymoshenko on 26 may 2011, having regard to the Statement by the spokesperson of EU High Representative Catherine Ashton on the case of Yulia Tymoshenko on 26 May 2011, having regard to the Statement by Commissioner Stefan Fule following his meeting with Yu. Tymoshenko on 24 March 2011… : 2. Expresses concern about the increased selective prosecution of figures from the political opposition in Ukraine». On 25 October 2011 the European Parliament approved (by majority of 5 factions out of six) the resolution on Ukraine (the third during a year) in which having regard to the statements of the EU member-states, declared : * «whereas a growing number of officials are being held criminally accountable for their actions including former government ministries, but mostly (deputy) heads of state departments and inspectorates, heads of sub-units of law- enforcement agencies, district court judges and heads of local authorities… the Parliament deplores the sentencing of former PM Yulia Tymoshenko (Par. 2 of the Resolution)… insists that all judicial proceedings against former and current senior government officials should be conducted in accordance with European standards» (Par.6 of the Resolution). On 13 December 2012, the European Parliament approved the sixth resolution to show concerns about political arrests of «Tymoshenko's associates»: * The European Parliament «expresses regret at the fact that according to the OSCE, PACE, NATO Parliamentary Assembly and European Parliament observers, the electoral campaign, electoral process and post-electoral process failed to meet major international standards». In particular, it concerns such aspect as «the arrest of opposition political leaders» The Resolution calls on Ukrainian authorities «to free and rehabilitate politically persecuted opponents, including Yulia Tymoshenko , Yury Lutsenko and others» (European Parliament Resolution of 13 December 2012 on the situation in Ukraine 2012/2889 (RSP), Human Rights Committee, European Parliament, Brussels).  PACE, OSCE resolutions  On 26 January, PACE adopted the resolution on «The Functioning of Democratic Institutions in Ukraine». It points out the political character of criminal cases against the ministers of Tymoshenko's government (including those of Jurij Luzenko, Valeriy Ivashchenko, Bohdan Danylyschyn, Georgy Filipchuk, general Anatoliy Makarenko, Eugene Korniychuk). The resolution, also, calls on the Ukrainian government «to consider all legal means available to release these members of the former government and to allow them to stand for the upcoming parliamentary elections» in autumn of 2012. For the first time, it mentions the possibility of introducing «sanctions» against some of the Ukrainian top officials now in power. However the Ukrainian government has, actually, ignored the key requirements of the resolution and no «sanctions» were applied (during, at least, the year 2012). On 11 July 2012, OSCE resolution was adopted on Ukraine, which declared that «there should not be any political prisoners» and called on Ukraine «to free all political prisoners».  European Court of Human Rights  On 3 July 2012, the European Court of Human Rights recognized Lutsenko's arrest «arbitrary» and his human rights «breached». As Jean-Claude Mignon, president of the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly said, the trial «had been politically motivated» and «charges were absolutely no justification for a prison sentence».  The case of ex-minister for economics Bohdan Danylyshyn  The logo of the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade (Ukraine) On 5 August 2010 Bohdan Danylyshyn flew to Germany. On 12 August 2010 the General Procurator's Office of Ukraine started a criminal case against minister for economics in Tymoshenko government (2007–2010) Bohdan Danylyshyn convicted in abusing his power and exceeding his office authorities under Part 2 Article 364 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. Danylyshyn was announced for international search. On 18 October 2010 Danylyshyn came from Germany to the «Ukrainian Embassy in the Czech Republic» where his lawyer allegedly had agreed about a «meeting for the sake of reconciliation» but after that meeting Danylyshyn was detained on 18 October 2010 by Czech Police (at Interpol request) when he was leaving the Ukrainian Embassy in Prague. Being imprisoned, Danylyshyn applied for a «political asylum» and was granted a political asylum in the Czech Republic on 12 January 2011. September 26, 2013 all criminal cases against Danylyshyn were closed, and he was questioned as a witness. Danylyshyn said : * «Interrogation touched my cases, completion of airport „Borispol“ and others. But all the prosecution was ceased. Currently I have not got any problems with the Ukrainian authorities». Media indicate that these criminal cases are closed only with a view to preparing the Association Agreement EU and Ukraine. This unexpected termination of criminal cases has shown that the prosecutor's office of Ukraine may unnecessarily open criminal cases against innocent people, and can unexpectedly close criminal cases without explanation or apology.  The case of ex-minister for defense Ivaschenko  The logo of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine On 24 August 2010, ex-minister for defense Valery Ivaschenko was arrested, the Prosecutor General's Office opened a criminal case against Ivaschenko under Part 2, Article 364 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (abuse of power or office). He was charged with adoption of an illicit decision as for sale of the property belonging to the Feodosia ship-mechanical plant. On 20 June 2011, V. Ivaschenko announced a hungry strike as a protest against his detention, however because of sudden deterioration of his health he had to terminate his action. On April 12, 2012 Pechersky District Court of Kyiv has sentenced former Acting Defense Minister of Ukraine Valeriy Ivaschenko to five years in prison and barred him from fulfillment of organizational and administrative activities in state agencies for three years. He was accused of abuse of power. Ivashchenko called the Prosecutor General of Ukraine «criminal organization» and warned judges and prosecutors on criminal liability for illegal, unlawful actions and decisions. According to him, «it's only a matter of time». Last week, the District Court of Kyiv Solomensky sentenced to three years imprisonment of former Environment Minister Georgy Filipchuk. In August 2012 year the Appeal court of Kyiv has reduced the sentence, replacing the real term for identification. The European Union Delegation has issued the statement in agreement with the EU Heads of Mission in Ukraine : * «The Delegation takes note of the release of Mr Ivaschenko after nearly two years in detention, during which his health condition deteriorated», «a now suspended sentence due to be appealed by the defence». In January 2013 Ivashchenko went abroad. January 14, 2013 Valery Ivaschenko was granted political asylum in Denmark.  The case of ex-minister for environment protection Georgy Philipchuk  Logo of the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources of Ukraine On 14 December 2010, ex-minister for Ukrainian environment protection Georgy Filipchuk was taken under arrest: * «The General Procurator's Office of Ukraine, on 13 December 2010, opened a criminal case against former minister for Ukrainian environment protection Georgy Philipchuk for the evidence of crime specified by p.2 art.364 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (an office abuse) which resulted in ill consequences». Filipchuk was incriminated co-acting as for the case on Kyoto money (see Legal proceedings against Yulia Tymoshenko since 2010 year). On 8 April 2011 the procurators informed about Georgy Filipchuk release from jail «for the reason of terminating the process of investigation on the case materials». April 5, 2012, the Solomiansky District Court of Kyiv sentenced former Environment Minister Heorhiy Filipchuk to three years in prison, finding him guilty under Part 3, Article 365 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. Filipchuk was convicted for abuse of office and power over the signing of an agreement with the AstapovLawyers law firm on the provision of consultations to the Environment Ministry during the consideration of a dispute at international law institutes regarding the cancellation of an agreement signed between the Ukrainian government and Vanco International Ltd. on the development of the Black Sea shelf. In accordance with the decree of April 7, 2013 (under the proposal of the Presidential Commission on Pardons) president Yanukovych pardoned six prisoners: in particular, ex-Minister of Environmental Protection Heorhiy Filipchuk was released from the principal and additional sentences.  The case of former first deputy minister for Justice Korniychuk  On 22 December 2010 procurators arrested former first deputy minister for justice (in Tymoshenko's Cabinet of Ministers) Yevgen (Eugene) Korniychuk; he is a son-in- law of Vasyl Onopenko, head of the Supreme Court of Ukraine. Korniychuk was detained on the day when his wife gave birth to their baby — two days after, the newly-born baby got in a reanimation. Just several weeks later, Yevgen Korniychuk was released under condition of «travel limitation» (after Vasyl Onopenko had seen President Yanukovich). On 15 February 2011 the Procurators Office changed the measure of suppression for a recognizance not to leave. Coat of arms of Kharkiv  The case of Arsen Avakov, ex-governor of Kharkiv region  Governor of Kharkiv region Arsen Avakov — had to stay in Italy for almost a year where he was given an asylum. In November 2012 Avakov was elected to parliament and returned to Ukraine.  The case of ex-minister for regional development and construction Vasyl Kuybida  Coat of arms of Lviv In June 2010 the criminal case was started against Vasyl Kuybida (the minister of regional development and construction in Tymoshenko's government in 2007–2010; the Mayor of Lviv in 1994–2002; a doctor of sciences in the field of state administration). The Office of State Security (SBU) convicted Kuybeda in that he had appointed, without announcing a contest, a head of the state office for architectural — and -construction monitoring in the Rivnenska region. The trial started in August 2010 but was over and over postponed — for September, October, November. Kuybida witnessed that according to the regulation, in case if an applicant for the position of the regional head for architectural and construction monitoring was approved by the Minister and agreed on with the Governor, a contest should not be conducted. Ex-governor of the Rivnenska region Victor Matchuk confirmed Kuybida's witnessing. On 13 December 2010 the a. m. case was suspended following the decision of the Shevchenkovsky District Court of the city of Kyiv. The prosecutor made a protest against closing the case, but on 14 January 2011 the Kyiv Appeal Court confirmed the decision on terminating the case. Vasyl Kuybida said that the case was initiated with the aim not to let him take part in the election for the position of Mayor of Lviv: * «They started „to hook“ me as soon as I had conducted consultations as for my might-be participation in balloting for the position of a city Mayor. After that, I was enforced to spend lots of time in Kyiv and, hence, to give up the idea of taking part in the elections. Therefore, finally they managed to get that I was not on balloting».(Russian language) Kuibida: Yanukovych's power reached its goal — not to admit me to the election. Site Ukranews. January 14, 2011. True, the local elections in Ukraine were held on 31 October 2010 — and soon after «the case of Kuybida» was closed. It is worth mentioning that prior to the local elections in Ukraine, criminal cases were launched against mayors of a number of locations\\".[37][36] After the final fall of Yushchenko's rating, since 2010 Kuibida stands firmly on the side of Tymoshenko. In June 2013, he said: * «Tymoshenko has proven to the world that it is possible to set the tone and manage complex political processes even behind bars, meaning that her neutralization from the political arena has failed once again». Coat of arms of Dnipropetrovsk  The case of Victor Bondar, ex-governor of Dnipropetrovsk region  June 16, 2010 Viktor Bondar said : «I left the policy». On 24 December 2010, ex-minister for transport, ex-governor of the Dnipropetrovsk region Victor Bondar was detained by the procurators. Strictly speaking, Bondar joined the team of Prime-Minister Tymoshenko in the months on the very eve of presidential election-2010, nevertheless his support (as governor of one of the largest regions of Ukraine) was very important in the course of election campaign. V. Bondar's case was opened in relation to his work as acting minister for transport in the year 2006 in Yekhanurov's government (after the previous minister for transport Ye. Chervonenko had been sacked) at the time of construction of the bus station Teremki in Kyiv — losses were estimated at 5 mln grn (about $950 thousand). Viktor Bondar was charged under Part 5 Article 27, Part 2 Article 194, Article 353 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine — complicity in intentional elimination of stranger property resulting in heavy losses, combined with willful appropriation of office duties. After his release from prison Viktor Bondar was not involved in politics in 2011–2012. However, in autumn 2012 Viktor Bondar took part in the parliamentary elections as «independent candidate» — in the electoral district № 191 in western Ukraine. He won the election because he was perceived as an opponent of «Party of Regions», but in parliament joined the faction «Party of Regions». Although in January 2013 Viktor Bondar voted for the «Law for the release of Tymoshenko and Lutsenko».  The criminal cases on the gas crisis RosUkrEnergo and Gazprom (January 2009) = Chronology of events as for the RosUkrEnergo claim to the Stockholm Arbitral Court  The main office of «Gazprom» in Moscow The logo of the Ministry of Fuel and Energy of Ukraine The logo of the State Customs Service of Ukraine For the first time RosUkrEnergo put a suit against NAK Naftogaz of Ukraine in April 2008 (to the Arbitrary Court under the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce), but in January 2009, RosUkrEnergo claimed on Naftogas another three suits. Naftogaz filed four counter-claims as for RosUkrEnergo. All the claims on the issue were combined under one case. On 2 April 2010, The Stockholm Arbitrary Court approved the interim decision (concerning the claims of RosUkrEnergo towards NAK Naftogaz of Ukraine as for $2 bln) and obliged Naftogaz to pay back the borrowed $19 mln. On 8 July 2010, The Stockholm Arbitrary Court adopted a decision (based on «amicable settlement» under which Naftogaz of Ukraine had admitted all the RosUkrEnergo claims) according to which NAK Naftogaz of Ukraine was bound to return to RosUkrEnergo «11 bln cub.m of gas plus 10% of compensation». Those 11 bln cun. m. of Russian gas were destined, in January 2009, to RosUkrEnergo (RUE), but RosUkrEnergo did not pay to Gazprom for it. Therefore, in 2009: * Naftogaz paid off the debt of RosUkrEnergo to Gazprom in the amount of $1.7 bln, and in return, Gazprom transferred Naftogaz the a.m. 11 bln of gas as compensation (that is, at the price of $156 per 1000 cub.m.). * Also, RosUkrEnergo was expelled from the gas supply scheme (within Ukraine and beyond its boundaries); the Gas Agreement was concluded directly between the state-owned companies Naftogaz and Gazprom. Prior to April 2010, Gazprom owned 50% of RosUkrEnergo shares, but in April 2010, Gazprom withdrew as co-founder of RosUkrEnergo — RosUkrEnergo became a fully private company with a controlling block of shares at Firtash's hands. During the period from November 2010 to April 2011, Nagtogaz transferred to the Swiss company RosUkrEnergo 12.1 bln cub.m of gas (11 bln + 10% of compensation); the RUE paid Nagtogaz back $1.7 bln. As for the year 2011 (at the gas price for the EU being $490 per 1000 cub.m.), the total value of the transferred gas should have been no less than $5.4 bln. The Firtash's point of view can be seen from his interview to the Focus magazine.(langue russe) (Russian language) «Mr. F. Interview with Dmitry Firtash». Sergei Vysotsky, «Focus». December 9, 2010.  The case of Igor Didenko, Anatoly Makarenko  On 23 June 2010 Anatoly Makarenko, ex-head of the Ukrainian Customs was jailed. On 8 July 2010, arrested was Igor Didenko, former first deputy head of Naftogaz. On 22 July 2010 first deputy procurator general Victor Pshonka (half a year later he has already become a procurator general) informed: «Taras Shepitko, a deputy head of a department of the Energy Regional Customs was taken under guard» (21 July 2010). Pshonka emphasized that the decisions of the Stockholm Court could not be taken as ground to launch a criminal case. All the three people were blamed for that they, within the terms of the Ukrainian-Russian interstate Agreement of 19 January 2009 (aimed at overcoming Ukrainian-Russian gas crisis−2009), had cleared and placed into a balance account of the state-owned company NAK Naftogaz 11 bln cub.m. of gas from the Gazprom company (supplied originally for the Swiss company Rosukrenergo but not paid by it); exactly that Rosukrenergo indebtedness of 1.7 bln USD, was the principal reason why Russia stopped, for 20 days, gas transition to Ukraine and Europe in January 2009).  The case of Taras Sheptko in March 2009  Yet under president Yushchenko, on 2 March 2009, the Office of Ukrainian Security, SBU (head — Nalivaichenko, first deputy head — Khoroshkovsky) started the criminal case as for the fact, allegedly, of appropriation by Naftogaz « of 6.3 bln cub.m. of transited natural gas for the amount of more that 7.4 bln. Grn (nearly 1 bln. USD)». Under this case, detained was deputy head of a Department of Energy Regional Customs Taras Shepitko. However Igor Didenko acting as head of the Naftogaz Managing Board appealed against the decision to open the case in «the Shevchenkovsky District Court of the city of Kyiv». On 24 March 2009 the Shevchenkovsky District Court recognized as unlawful the SBU particular actions and rejected the SBU decision to open the a.m. case.  The case of Maria Kushnir — Deputy Chief Accountant of Naftogaz  Maria Kushnir was the fourth convict in the «gas case of RosUkrEnergo» (under which Didenko, Makarenko, Shepitko were arrested). On 23 July 2010, the Office of Ukrainian Security (SBU) initiated a criminal case against «deputy chief accountant of Naftogaz» Maria Kushnir. On 26 July 2010, the Pechersky District Court of the city of Kyiv sanctioned the detention of Kushnir. Head of SBU Valery Khoroshkovsky claimed that Kushnir had been appointed to that job in the Naftogaz of Ukraine specially to take part in customs clearance of the gas belonging to RosUkrEnergo; « Her only duty was just to fix the needed signature. It was exactly she who gave orders to place the gas into the balance account of the Naftogaz, and who signed the origin of the document». At first, Kushnir was incriminated «p.2 art.367 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine» (duty negligence resulted in ill losses) pursuant which it might be up to a three-year sentence. However, on 9 September 2010, the criminal case was opened against Kushnir under p. 2 art.364 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine («abuse of office duties» causing ill consequences). On 10 September 2010 due to mutual actions with the law- enforcement bodies of the Russian Federation, Kushnir was detained in the Volgograd region (the Russian Federation)\\" and a month later was extradited to Ukraine. Since then, (and until October 2011) M. Kushnir had been in a detained centre (SIZO), there was not any information on further developments round her case in mass media.  Release of Makarenko and Shepitko after a year of being kept in detention centre (SIZO)  On 5 July 2011, Makarenko and Shepitko were unexpectedly released from detention but their criminal cases were not terminated and there still existed «restrictions to travel». The press saw the connections between Makarenko's freeing and the coming meeting (on 6 July 2011) of the Russian Prime Minister Putin and President Yanukovich in the Crimea. Yet in the summer of 2010, «commanders of the Russian Navy» (who have known Makarenko since his years in the Russian navy) applied to V.Putin and V. Yanukovich with the request to release Makarenko from detention. Putin expressed his support for the request in his speech on the Day of Russian Navy, 2010. In response to Makarenko release, in the Ukrainian mass media there appeared «information leaked from deputies representing radically opposed factions of the Verkhovna Rada that, presumably, Russia advised Ukraine to „stop persecutions of Tymoshenko“». Also, at the press-conference in Moscow on 7 July 2011 on the results of Putin-Azarov talks, Prime Minister Putin said that Russia was against re- consideration of «the gas agreement of 19 January 2009» and, as he thought, criticism of that agreement by Ukrainian government had a «political constituent; an intention to impose the opinion that the predecessors had everything done badly». 20 July 2012 Kyiv's Pechersky district court returned a verdict under former head of Ukraine's Customs Anatoly Makarenko, he was sentenced to four years’ imprisonment with a delay of penalty.  Heads of State Treasury's Office: Tetyana Slyuz and Tetyana Hrytzun  The logo of the National Bank of Ukraine. State Treasury of Ukraine — structural unit of the National Bank  Tetyana Slyuz  On 24 December 2010 Tetyana Yaroslavivna (Head of Ukrainian State Treasury's Office) was declared to be on search; she was incriminated in relation to the case of Kyoto money (see Legal proceedings against Yulia Tymoshenko since 2010). The prosecutors affirmed that Slyuz was staying abroad. February 21, 2011, Yulia Tymoshenko said about Tetyana Slyuz : * «The police are visiting her 77-year-old mother. Oleksiy Sytnykiv is threatening her with some strange things, telling her that her daughter was killed by opposition forces… Tetyana Slyuz's son, Andriy, is also being dragged to questionings». In the parliamentary elections of 2012 Tatiana Sliuz was elected member of parliament, and received parliamentary immunity.  Tetyana Hrytzun, first deputy head of the Ukrainian State Treasury's Office  On 19 July, detained was Tetyana Hrytzun (former first deputy head of the Ukrainian State Treasury's Office). On 22 July 2010, The Pechersky District Court gave sanction to her arrest — she was charged with «abuse of power or official authorities that led to serious consequences» (Part 2 of Article 364 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine foresees 3–6 years in jail): * «According to investigators, from September 2009 through April 2010 she gave instructions to her subordinates not to transfer UAH 800 million ($100 million) of competition guarantees to bidder companies in a tender for the privatization of the Odesa Port-Side Plant (OPSP), Nortima Ltd. and to Frunze-Flora, in spite of an order on the return of the funds issued by the State Property Fund». As of October, 11th, 2011, Tetyana Hrytzun was kept at the detention centre (SIZO). The main point of the conflict around the Odesa Port-Side Plant is as follows: — Prime Minister Tymoshenko is intention was, via privatization of the strategic enterprise OPSP, to substantially inject into the state budget in «the crisis 2009 year». It was, also, the time, when Ukraine was preparing to the presidential election. President Yushchenko fought against Tymoshenko, and he vetoed privatization of the Odesa Port-Side Plant. Due to that, «the most affluent investors» did not take part in the auction; the claims for participation were presented by just three companies. At the auction, the price, practically, remained at its basic level. The auction was won by the firm «Nortima» (owned by Ihor Kolomoyskyi), but Tymoshenko informed that the plant would not be sold off so as «the participants had agreed about the minimal price». In response, Kolomoyskyi promised to start suing while Tymoshenko stopped discharging pledges deposited by the firms «Nortima» and «Frunze-Flora». But the third member of the auction — the Russian company «Azot-Service» (which represented the interests of Gazprom) immediately received the money that previously made a pledge at the auction. Tymoshenko explained that at the moment the state has no money to spend (the crisis 2009 year), but promised to immediately repay the full amount as soon as the plant will be privatized.  The case of ex-minister for internal affairs Yury Lutsenko  The logo of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine On 26 December 2010,Lutsenko:Tymoshenko ties get you arrested. Kyiv Post, 25 February 2010. ex-minister for internal affairs of Ukraine Yuriy Lutsenko was detained.All cases against former minister Lutsenko merged. Website «kyivpost.com». December 27, 2010. ThreeAll cases against former minister Lutsenko merged.

Kyiv Post, 12 November 2010. * For money spent on celebration of the Militia Day in the Ukraina Palace in 2008–2009 [52] — during two years, it was spent, all in all, about 600,000 grn (about 60,000 euros). * For unlawful pursuing the figures involved into the case of Yushchenko poisoning (p. 3 art. 364 of the Criminal Code — abuse of power duties by an officer of law- enforcement body).The European Court ruling on Lutsenko case takes effect. Kyiv Post, 20 November 2012.  Starvation by Yuriy Lutsenko — 30 days, and 25 kg of weight loss  As a protest against his unlawful detention, on 23 April 2011 Yuriy Lutsenko started a hunger strike (during his starvation, he fully stopped eating, but drank coffee with sugar).Lutsenko transferred to clinic from prison, says party's press secretary, Kyiv Post (4 December 2012) On 28 April he signed his formal letter addressed to the SIZO authorities with which he informed about «his will to stop eating». Before May the 10th he had already lost 19.5 kg of weight and was placed into the medical unit of the Lukyanovsky SIZO (a detention centre) because of worsening of his physical state. That same day, he was sent to the Kyiv Emergency hospital in 3, Bratislavska street. On 19 May, his condition was so bad, that «his veins were dripped with glucose solution». The 23 May 2011 was the day of a trial which had to settle the question on «measures of suppression» (that is, Lutsenko might have been released). Lutsenko ceased starvation only after the trial, on 23 May (thus, having sustained a 30-day hunger strike and lost nearly 25 kg of weight). He said: * \\"I think, it is not expedient to go on with starvation. I started it to bring to the knowledge that in our Ukraine there are no procurators. Due to today's trial I\\"ve managed to let everyone know that we do not have a justified court; however, further on, I need to be in good health to break all that down\\". After the hunger strike Lutsenko has deteriorated state of health. In January 2013, Yuri Lutsenko had surgery on his intestines.Lutsenko to undergo surgery at his own expense. Site «for-ua.com», 28 December 2012. Yuriy Lutsenko in opposition (20 March 2007), seven months before the early elections to the Verkhovna Rada.  Letters from jail  From a jail Lutsenko had written (by June 2011) six letters — publicist articles on actual political issues.  Lutsenko refused to plead guilty and ask for pardon  Lutsenko and his family had repeatedly stated that they would not seek a pardon, because they believe the charges where groundless and political punishment. On 3 July 2012, the European Court of Human Rights recognized Lutsenko's arrest «arbitrary» and his human rights «breached». On 21 July 2012, Lutsenko was supported by head of the Committee of Parliamentary Co-Operation of EC-Ukraine in the European Parliament Marek Sivec (a former head of the Bureau for the National Security of Poland). He officially applied to the Ukrainian authorities with the request to release Yu. Lutsenko until the beginning of a trial under his personal guarantee: * «I have made a decision to apply to the fully authoritative legal bodies of Ukraine with the request to take into consideration my personal guarantee as for Lutsenko's release and to make it possible for him to feel free when responding before the court». Sivec reminded of the Resolution of the Europarliament which established «growing persecutions of the previous cabinet officials and opposition».  Pardon Lutsenko  April 7, 2013 a decree by Yanukovych pardoned Lutsenko (under the proposal of the Presidential Commission on Pardons) for health reasons and «to decriminalize and humanize Ukrainian legislation».  Tax Maidan-2010  The Tax Maidan (Kyiv). 29 November 2010 The Tax Maidan (Kyiv). 2 December 2010 In the autumn 2010, Ukraine saw the wave of mass protests from the entrepreneurs of small-size and medium-size businesses; they protested against a number of steps by Yanukovich officials towards cuts in «social standards» through a number of oligarch reforms : * The new «Pension Code» and «Labour Code» tended to essentially deteriorate the lives of ordinary people. * The new «Tax Code» significantly (several times more) increased taxes for «small business» («the smallest business» that was under a simplified tax system before, suffered mostly); The medium-size business also suffered losses. Natural persons were not permitted (at the cost of surcharge introduction) to execute work for legal persons; besides, the Code allowed to carry out «inspection of an entrepreneur's living place by Tax Inspection without any sanction by the Procurator's Office». The Tax Maidan became the culmination point in the protest movement (the All-Ukrainian rallies of small and medium-size entrepreneurs against «the Azarov-Tigipko Tax Code» took place on 22 November 2010 — 3 December 2010). Maidan-2010 achieved that «the heaviest tax provisions of the Azarov-Tigipko Tax Code» were abolished. Those protests of «small and medium businesses» were supported by, almost exclusively, Tymoshenko's BYuT (on the 22 November 2010 Tymoshenko made a program speech at the Maidan in Kyiv).  Repressions against Tax Maidan−2010, activists arrests  On 27 November 2010, President Yanukovich and Prime Minister Azarov came up to the tents of protesters. They promised business people «to hear all their requests and intentions». Really, a part of the most odious provisions of the Tax Code was removed in the new edition of the Code of 29 November 2010, Nevertheless: * On 3 December 2010, at 5:00 am, the Maidan was surrounded by four rows of «special police». Policemen demolished the tents of the Tax Maidan activists.Ukraine police clear Kiev tax protesters' camp. 3 December 2010. * On 28 December 2010, the three activists of the Tax Maidan : Garkavenko I., Zaplatkin O., and Gruzyniv V. were arrested; the fourth detained (co-organiser of the action O. Mandich) was soon released. As for January, the 14th, the criminal cases were launched against seven activists of the Tax Maidan, among them being entrepreneurs : Okhtyrsky, Mandich, Kavenko, Gruzynov, Zaplatkin, Melnichenko, Fedchuk. They were incriminated with «the damage of the tiled cover at the Independence Maidan to the money amount of 230, 000 grn (21,000 euros)». * In December 2010 detained was, also, an activist of the Tax Maidan Sergey Kostak (as for July 2010, he was kept in the SIZO (a detention centre)). Therefore, «peaceful protests against the Tax Code» (which had been afterwards considerably changed and amended due to the agreement with the President and Prime-Minister) resulted in detentions eight people were being kept, without a trial, at the detention centre for more than 7 months and released only in July 2011. Leader of the Tax Maidan-2010 Olexander Danilyuk and his «organization of small business undertakers Spilna Sprava (Common Cause)» have joined the protest actions against the trials on Tymoshenko and her associates.  Collaboration of President Yanukovich with the part of the opposition who do not recognize Tymoshenko as a leader  Yet, there exists a part of the opposition who do not consider Tymoshenko as their leader and, hence, can not be seen as «Tymoshenko associates», though they are also a certain subdivision of oppositionists.  V. Yushchenko's political team  After Victor Yanukovich had taken the office (February 2010), persecutions were executed almost exclusively against the Tymoshenko's political team as well as the ministers of her Cabinet. Victor Yanukovich collaborates with the part of the opposition — Victor Yushchenko's closest associates have been offered top positions : * Viktor Baloha — minister for emergency (2010-2012)(Ukrainian language) Decree Appointing Viktor Baloha as Minister of Emergencies and Protecting the Population from the Consequences of the Chornobyl Disaster. 12.11.2010.

January, 2008 There are the examples of Yanukovich collaboration even with former BYuT politicians, but only with those who have completely torn off their ties with BYuT. Two of them have significant positions in government: * Olexandr Feldman (№ 43 in the BYuT passing lists at the election-2007, ex-head of the BYuT branch in the Kharkiv region, an owner of the biggest market place in Kharkiv) — 25 June 2010 was expelled from BYuT-Batkivshchyna, yet he refused to give back his deputy mandate from BYuT; on 16 March 2011 he joined the Party of Regions. On 8 July 2011 he was elected a member of the political council of the Party of Regions. * Andrey Portnov (№ 58 in the BYuT passing lists at the election-2007, a known lawyer of the PrivatBank group (headed a team of Tymoshenko's lawyers at the trial following presidential election-2010). On 2 April 2010 he was appointed a deputy head of the Presidential administration (PA head had 9 deputy heads). That same time, he was expelled from BYuT- Batkivshchyna; on 16 April 2010 he gave his BYuT deputy mandate back, on 5 April 2011 he was dismissed as deputy head of presidential administration. Both Feldman and Portnov were, in the past, the deputies of «certain significance» for BYuT, but not at all the close associates of Tymoshenko (№ 43 and № 58, respectively, in the BYuT lists). As a total, during 2010–2012 years, the BYuT faction expelled (basically, for voting against faction decisions) more than a third of deputies — out of 156, remained «slightly more than 100 deputies» (October 2012).

Presently, the JASMS system occupies three campuses: the nursery (3-year-olds) to grade 6 levels of PWU JASMS Manila (formerly JASMS Indiana) on Pilar Hidalgo-Lim Street in Malate, Manila; the PWU JASMS Manila High School (grades 7 to 12) in the PWU main campus on Taft Avenue in Malate, Manila; and the nursery to grade 12 campus of JASMS Quezon City (QC) in 51 Congressional Ave. cor. Villa Soccoro St., Barangay Bahay Toro, Project 8, Quezon City. History JASMS evolved from the preschool (est. 1933) of the Philippine Women’s University (PWU) under the leadership of President Francisca Tirona Benitez. President Benitez hired Doreen Barber Gamboa and Priscilla Abaya to first set up and run the preschool in the fenced-in area which was the PWU gymnasium. In 1949, the PWU elementary department was renamed the Jose Abad Santos Memorial School (JASMS) in honor of José Abad Santos, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines and chairman of the PWU board of trustees, who was executed by the Japanese invading forces during World War II. * 1933 Nursery class opens for children 18 months to 3 years of age under the Elementary and Training Department of the PWU at A. Flores Street in Ermita, Manila, * 1936 Kindergarten expands into the Child Development Department headed by Doreen Gamboa, * 1938 Boarding nursery is set up for children whose parents were working or not in the city. * 1941 Experimental grade 1 is opened when parents ask that the child development approach is carried on to the grade school. The class is abruptly closed by the onset of WWII but Gamboa sets up a kindergarten and ungraded primary classes in an old house at the corner of Taft Avenue and Tennessee (now Malvar Street) in Malate, Manila. * 1944 PWU building was burned during the war. Quonset huts are built to house the kindergarten and elementary by day and to serve as a dormitory by night. Fronting PWU, these huts were at the site of what would later be referred to as the JASMS Annex. Other big houses undamaged by the war became the classrooms. One such house was owned by the late Chief Justice Abad Santos, once PWU board chair, who was executed by the enemy during the war. * 1949 Doreen Gamboa leads the rebuilding of the preschool and elementary department following the principles of child development; the school is renamed the Jose Abad Santos Memorial School (JASMS) * 1956 JASMS in Quezon City (QC) is established through the generosity of Earl Carroll, president of the Philamlife Assurance Company to serve the new communities opening up in the vicinity such as the Philamlife Homes, West Triangle Homes, and the government housing projects. The new JASMS QC with Gamboa as director offers preschool to Grade 7. * 1961 JASMS QC high school opens. * 2010 JASMS QC is cited as the Quezon City Gawad Parangal Most Outstanding Institution by the QC government. * 2012 JASMS Manila and the PWU High School and JASMS QC are selected by DepEd to model the Grade 11 curriculum. * 2015 PWU JASMS Manila and JASMS QC are granted permits by the Department of Education to open Senior High School (Grades 11 and 12). * 2017 JASMS Quezon City campus relocated from its original site in EDSA, West Triangle to Congressional Avenue in Project 8, Quezon City.

Early life and education Barbara J. Risman was born on 20 July 1956 in Lynn, Massachusetts to an immigrant Jewish family. Risman’s grandparents fled antisemitism in Europe and immigrated to the United States in the early 20th century. She grew up in a multi-generational extended family home with grandparents, aunts, and cousins as well as her parents and three siblings. An early experience of sexual discrimination occurred at her bat mitzvah in 1968. At that time, only boys were permitted to read from the Torah. Professor Risman has been interested in gender inequality ever since that first “click.” She earned her bachelor's degree in Sociology and Women's Studies from Northwestern University in 1976, and her Ph.D. in Sociology from the University of Washington in 1983.  Academic career  Professor Risman joined the Department of Sociology at North Carolina State University (NCSU) in 1984. She was also the founding director of the NCSU Women's Studies program from 1989 to 1993. In 2006, she became Professor and Head of the Department of Sociology at the University of Illinois at Chicago. She has been a Visiting Professor at the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Trento in Italy, and the Free University in Amsterdam. Professor Risman was elected as Vice-President of the American Sociological Association. From January - March 2018 she was a Fellow of the Institute of Advanced Study based at Durham University, and affiliated with St Mary's College.  Organizations  Currently, she is president of the Board of the Council of Contemporary Families, a non-profit, non-partisan organization of family scholars and practitioners dedicated to providing the press and public with the latest research and best-practice findings about families. She has also served as Co- Chair and Executive Director of the Council on Contemporary Families, president of Sociologists for Women in Society, and a member of the Executive Council of the American Sociological Association. She was the president (2015-2016) of the Southern Sociological Society.  Gender as a social structure  A major career contribution is Risman's theory of gender as a social structure. Her book, Gender Vertigo: American Families in Transition (1998, Yale University Press) is an early presentation of this theory. In this monograph, Risman introduces a theoretical framework that conceptualizes gender as a social structure, comprising three distinct but interlocking levels – individual, interactional, and institutional. Risman argues that it is the recursive relationship between all three levels that constructs and perpetuates gender inequalities in society. The monograph includes research on single fathers as parents, how baby boom women balance work and family, and egalitarian couples. In her forthcoming book, Professor Risman traces the history of ideas and development of the use of gender in sociological theory and analysis. She then offers her own feminist theory of gender as a social structure. This is a major revision of her argument about how social change towards gender equality might effectively occur with far more attention to cultural issues. The book provides elaboration of how gender is constructed and sometimes deconstructed at the individual, interactional and institutional levels. She illustrates the use of efficacy of her theoretical argument with three different research studies: The first study is based on life history interviews with young people ages 18 and 30 about the meaning of gender in their lives. The second study is based on a major national survey of college students, as well as nearly 100 interviews with University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) students about sexuality. The third study is an analysis of the effectiveness of major federal grants to universities to do \\"gender transformation\\" projects; the data are based on a meta-analysis of new research and an analysis of both quantitative climate surveys and interviews with people involved in the project at the UIC. The book concludes with a utopian vision for a society that has moved beyond gender.  Influence on gender studies  Numerous studies have drawn on Professor Risman's theoretical framework of gender as a social structure. These include, but are not limited to, analyses of double standards in hooking up, men's talk about home cooking, involvement in gay and lesbian rights activism, sexual violence on college campuses, the “ex-gay” movement, gendered migration, the division of housework and child care, and how society can move toward greater gender equality.  Awards  Barbara Risman's numerous awards include the Sociologists for Women in Society (SWS) Feminist Lecturer Award in 2003, the Southern Sociological Society Katherine Belle-Boone Jocher Award for lifetime contributions to the study of gender in 2005, the SWS Feminist Mentoring Award in 2007, and the American Sociological Association Award for the Public Understanding of Sociology in 2011. Most recently, she was named among the \\"100 Women that Mattered\\" at North Carolina State University.  Selected bibliography = Books   * Second edition forthcoming in 2014.

It was donated to the state with certain provisions as to its management as a wildlife sanctuary. It is a biodiverse habitat and is visited annually by many migratory birds. Much research is undertaken into marshland management and alligator ranching, and the income from the sale of alligators contributes to conservation of the marshland. History In 1913, the naturalist and businessman Edward Avery McIlhenny bought abought 86,000 acres of marshland in Louisiana with the help of donated money. The following year the land was sold to the Rockefeller Foundation for the preservation and protection of migratory birds. The Rockefeller Foundation entrusted control of the land to the Conservation Commission of Louisiana for a period of five years. After this was successfully completed, the land was donated to the state, and in 1920 became the Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge. During the early years the marsh was patrolled to prevent poaching and the land was periodically burnt to encourage the growth of suitable fodder for muskrats and geese. The expenses of the Refuge were at least partly met by the sale of muskrat pelts. The primary aim of the project was to conserve the wetlands habitat. The provisions of the bequest stipulated that all revenue must be ploughed back into the project. Fur–bearing mammals, waterfowl and alligators could be cropped on a sustainable basis and these and the oil available underground have been carefully harvested and have provided a steady source of income. In the 1960s, the commission used these funds for a pioneering program of alligator management with the whole area becoming, in effect, a vast alligator ranch. The refuge Nutria control is sometimes necessary to prevent damage to the levees The Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge occupies a strip of low-lying flat treeless land adjoining the Gulf of Mexico for and extending inland for about to the Grand Chenier Ridge, a marine terrace. The original 86,000 acres of the site have been reduced to about 76,000 by coastal erosion. It is one of the most biodiverse wildlife areas in the United States. When the Rockfeller Foundation donated the land it stipulated that: * The property must be maintained as a wildlife refuge. * The boundaries must be posted. * Enforcement agents must protect the area from trespassers and poachers. * No public taking of fish or animals to be allowed. * The refuge staff must study and manage the property for wildlife. * Mineral revenues must be used on behalf of the refuge with any surplus going towards education or public health. Animals resident in the refuge all year round include mottled ducks, rails, nutria, muskrat, raccoon, mink, otter, opossum, white-tailed deer and alligators. Large numbers of migratory birds including about 160,000 waterfowl visit it each year including geese, ducks, coots, shorebirds and wading birds. Fish present include redfish, speckled trout, black drum and largemouth bass. Some recreational fishing is permitted but no hunting is allowed, although some animals are trapped if their populations seem to be getting out of control. There are eleven impoundments on the site with some method of water control. Levees and sluice gates are built and maintained so as to divide the land into areas with varying degrees of salinity. The land is managed so as to stabilise water levels as far as possible. A reduction in the level of salinity in some areas encourages the growth of submerged aquatic and annual plants which provide suitable habitat for wildfowl. Some mineral developments have been allowed to produce revenue but these have been managed so as to minimise their impact on the environment. The research centre employs biologists, conservation officers and maintenance staff. Management The Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge is best known for its pioneering research into alligators, their natural history, their requirements and ranching. Some aspects covered include penning, stocking rates, egg incubation, hatching, rearing and diet. This information has been used by other crocodilian farms and ranches around the world. Brown pelican and bald eagle restoration projects are managed from here and striped bass are raised for distribution to river systems in the west of the state. Other research studies include wildfowl habitat management, marsh management, various wildlife projects, alligator snapping turtles and how to reduce the impact of mineral extraction in wetlands. The refuge is visited each year by about 80,000 people.

The University of Queensland estimates that hunters investe $556,650,000 annually into the Australian economy. There is around 5.8 million legally owned firearms in Australia, ranging from bolt-action, to pump-action, to lever-action, to semi- automatic firearms. A survey of recreational hunters identified the following usage rates of particular hunting methods: rifle, 92.3%; bow, 16.4%; black powder, 3.4%; shotgun, 56.0%; dogs only, 8.6%; and other, 3.3% Animals Many species of animals in Australia have been introduced by European settlers since the 18th century. Among these are rabbits, hares, cats, foxes, goats, pigs, dogs, deer, donkeys, horses and feral cattle (including banteng), camels, and water buffalo. The most commonly hunted animals by recreational hunters are rabbits, foxes, ducks, pigs, feral cats, and feral goats. Hunting of rabbits is encouraged across all of Australia, as they are considered a highly invasive pest. The most common form of hunting is ground shooting. The recreational hunting of foxes is also commonly done by shooting. However, this usually requires other techniques to lure and shoot the animal such as the use of the fox whistle, which makes a sound like a distressed rabbit (otherwise known as spotlighting). The commercial harvest of kangaroos by professional hunters was recorded as 1,560,586 in 2012. Six species of deer can be found in Australia. *The chital (Axis axis) is also known as the Indian spotted deer; they are light to dark brown with permanent white spots which appear as broken lines running along the body. They typically have three tined antlers. *The hog deer (axis porcinus) is a close relative of the chital; they range from a uniform dark brown during winter to a rich reddish-brown in summer, at which time light-coloured spots along the sides and on either side of the dark dorsal stripe are visible in individuals. Typically, they have three tined antlers, but extra points are not unheard of. *The sambar (Cervus unicolor) is the largest deer species to be found in Australia. They are normally brown, but individuals of grey to almost black are seen. Typically, they have three tined antlers, but they often sported with a wide variety of styles. *The rusa (Cervus timorensis) is a close relative of the sambar but smaller in size; they are a uniform grey-brown, variable between individuals and season. It typically has three tined antlers. *The fallow deer (dama dama) is the most common species of deer in the world. In the summer, they are light to reddish brown with white spots. In the winter, this changes to a greyish brown. *The red deer (cervus elaphus) ranges from a dull brown in winter coat to a rich reddish brown in summer; a permanent straw-coloured rump or caudal patch is retained throughout the year Legislation Laws related to hunting vary between each state or territory. Except where otherwise stated, most states and territories allow the hunting of pest species - feral dogs, feral goats, feral pigs, foxes, hares, and rabbits - at any time of year with the landowner's permission. Every state and territory requires those carrying firearms to be licensed to do so. Australian Capital Territory All that is required to hunt in Australian Capital Territory is a valid firearms licence. Individuals between the ages of 12 - 17 can hold a minor's firearms licence, allowing them to hunt under adult supervision. However, hunting is restricted to pest animals on private property and may only be carried out with the landowner's permission. New South Wales New South Wales allows the hunting of some deer during open season and the hunting of all other deer and specified game animals on private land and crown land at any time throughout the year. In NSW game species include ducks, which may be hunted under the New South Wales Game Bird Management Program, as well as wild deer, California quails, partridges, pheasants, peafowl and turkeys. Dogs, cats and hares are classified as both feral and game. Northern Territory The Northern Territory freely allows the hunting of feral animals on private land with the landowner's permission as long as the hunter holds a valid firearms licence. This excepts feral pigs and waterfowl, for which a permit is required to hunt on certain reserves. As well as species that can be hunted anywhere in Australia, the Northern Territory considers many animals to be feral: Arabian camels, buffaloes, banteng, cane toads, donkeys, feral cats, horses, wild dogs, feral cattle, house sparrows, pigeons, sambar deer, rusa deer, chital and turtle doves. All waterfowl hunters require a permit to hunt and may only do say during the declared open season. Waterfowl includes the following species: magpie geese, Pacific black duck, wandering whistling duck, plumed whistling duck, grey teal, pink-eared duck, hardhead duck, maned duck. Queensland In Queensland, some native species (with a permit) and all pest species may be hunted at any time of the year with the landowner's permission. A weapons licence is required to carry firearms. No species are declared as game animals. Many animals are declared pests in Queensland. Species commonly hunted include red deer, chital, fallow deer, rusa, dingo, feral dog, rabbits, hares, cats, foxes, goats, pigs, dogs, donkeys, horses and feral cattle. South Australia South Australia allows the hunting of game species during open season. Species listed as game are the stubble quail, Pacific black duck, grey teal, chestnut teal, Australian shelduck, pink-eared duck and maned duck. Some native species and all introduced species may be hunted at any time of the year. Namely camels, deer, starling, domestic pigeon, European blackbird and the spotted turtle-dove. Tasmania A game licence is required in order to hunt in Tasmania, pests and feral creatures are eligible to be hunted on private, state and crown land. Pests can be hunted on crown land at any time, however on private and state land hunts are only carried out with explicit permission from the owner of the private land. Minor permits in both firearms and hunting can be applied for if under the age of 18 years. There are two different grades of minor permits available to those between 12 - 16 and 16 – 18 years. Tasmania classifies as game species: deer, wild duck, brown quail and pheasant. For non-commercial purposes, muttonbirds and wallabies may also be hunted. Victoria Victoria makes no restrictions on the hunting of pest or feral animals on private land or in state forests, as long as the hunter has permission from the landowner. Hunting of game species is allowed during open seasons under a state licence scheme. Game licence numbers in Victoria Duck-26,200 Quail-29,000 Deer-32,000 Victoria allows the hunting of many game species. These include stubble quail, pheasants, partridges, European quail, California quail, Pacific black duck, grey teal, hardhead, Australian shelduck, pink-eared duck, Australian wood duck, chestnut teal, Australasian shoveller, hog deer, red deer, sambar deer and fallow deer. Both hares and feral dogs are classified as pests, and can be hunted at any time throughout the year. Western Australia In Western Australia, only feral species may be hunted on private land with the landowner's permission, subject to holding a valid firearms licence. These species include camels, donkeys, feral cattle, wood ducks, feral dogs, feral horse, hares and starling. Aboriginal hunting Aboriginal Australians lived on the Australian continent for thousands of years before Europeans settlement in the late 1700s. They had a wealth of animals to hunt and had very refined and sometimes ingenious ways of hunting them. Hunting techniques ;Boomerang Boomerang Boomerangs have been used as a hunting tool by Aborigines for tens of thousands of years. The way a hunter tends to use a boomerang is to rustle tree branches, causing the birds inside to be startled and fly into nets that the hunter had already set up between trees. Contrary to popular belief, Aboriginal hunting boomerangs are not designed to return to the thrower. ;Throwing sticks Related to the boomerang, a throwing stick is bigger and heavier. These heftier weapons are used to hunt bigger animals such as kangaroos. They were thrown straight at their target and could even break bones on impact. This made it a lethal tool in the hands of an experienced hunter. ;Fire Aboriginals use fire to clear vegetation from patches of land to make it easier to hunt game. Among the animals hunted are monitor lizards. Surprisingly in areas where the technique is used, the lizard population increases by as much as 100%. This is thought to be because burning established vegetation clears land for the growth of new plant species, increasing biodiversity thus improving the lizards' habitat. Legal framework The National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 (Cth) mandates Aboriginal people are not subject to general conservation restrictions so long as they engage in hunting only for food, ceremonial or religious purposes (in all cases must be non-commercial).National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 (Cth) S70(1) However, restrictions may be put in place in order to protect wildlife and must specifically state that such restrictions apply to Aboriginal people.National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 (Cth) S70(2) This section does not give an Aboriginal person right of entry onto land. Entry onto private land, state forests, national parks or other kinds of crown land is regulated under State or Territory Legislation and is variable.http://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/35.%20Aboriginal%20Hunting,%20Fishing%20and%20Gathering%20Rights%3A%20Current%20Australian%20Legislation/au Controversy There has been a number of controversies surrounding indigenous Australians and the Australian government regarding their hunting rights. In 1993, the Australian Government brought in legislation called the Native Title Act. This act meant that the Australian Government recognised that the Aboriginal Australians have rights to and interests to their land that come from their traditional laws and customs. One of the activities that are covered by the Native Title is the right for the Aborigines to hunt otherwise endangered species for food or ceremonial purposes. The killing of endangered is a wide source of outrage with many calling for a rewrite of the legislation to protect the endangered species.

TanzaniteOne Mining Ltd is located in Block C, Merelani, Tanzania. Merelani is the world's only known source of tanzanite. TanzaniteOne Mining Ltd was founded by Richland Resources - a gemstone development and mining company who are listed on the London Stock Exchanges AIM market (AIM:RLD) in 1994 . In 2014 TanzaniteOne was sold to a private company, Sky Associates, who are now the current owners. The tanzanite resource is a long narrow area, divided into four blocks , named \\" A\\" to \\"D\\". TanzaniteOne Mining own the licence to mine the largest area Block C. Medium scale mining is undertaken by Kilimanjaro Mining in Block A and Tanzanite Africa in Block D-extension. The Company’s neighbouring Blocks B and D are mined largely by thousands of artisanal miners who use non mechanised methods which do not allow them to mine as deep or as efficiently as Tanzanite One in C block. This poses a challenge for TanzaniteOne, notably in terms of undermining, whereby, the artisanal miners are mining into TanzaniteOne’s designated license area to access deeper and better ventilated tunnels than their own. Ongoing security issues from the illegal mining and the lack of support from the local police and government agencies are stated as the major factor in the sale of TanzaniteOne by Richland Resources in 2015. TanzaniteOne traditionally sell only rough gemstones to wholesale customers called \\"Sightholders\\", adopting a sales strategy which is based on the Debeers style of distribution where the sightholder companies are guaranteed a consistent bulk supply of the gemstone, but must purchase all quality grades of the gem as opposed to selecting the goods they require for production. The role of the sightholders is to process rough tanzanite and to manufacture jewelry. They have the ability to purchase large amounts of rough and have wholesale and retail distribution networks in place to facilitate the sale of loose tanzanite and finished jewelry. In August 2013 TanzaniteOne announced they had opened an online boutique - dubbed www.tananiteoneonline which sold tanzanite gemstones and tanzanite set gold jewelry. This is the first time the mining company has offered its gemstones to retail customers. In 2015 the website was renamed as richlandgemstones.com after Richland Resources sold TanzaniteOne.

In “Welcome, Baby” a young child watches a middle-aged couple have intercourse from inside a motel room closet, an infant without eyes or ears is abandoned, and a man tries to hang himself from a fan. In “Here Comes Cricket,” an aged mother who is beaten by her own son plans to end both their lives through joint suicide and “Dress Shoes” features a father who kills his entire family and then takes his own life. Although these ruthless stories fill readers with much discomfort, they are not too far-fetched, for the newspapers, television, and the Internet are full of stories like these.\\"Baek Ga-heum\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# Baek Ga-heum's “The Tomb of a Ship” describes blood-curdling crime in a small port town. The return of a photo criminal past the statute of limitations to his hometown results in vengeful violence and murder, a subversion of dichotomy between good and evil. Paik's characters tend to the neglected and marginalized—those who are both socially and economically on the bottom rung of society: prostitutes, itinerant manual laborers, sailors running from the law, the mentally and physically handicapped, the elderly homeless living in condemned buildings, and women who are physically and sexually abused. A great number of these characters suffer from speech disorders or lack the mental capacity to recognize the gravity of the situation; the few who do realize their dire circumstances are without the proper education to articulate themselves.\\"Baek Ga-heum\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# Works in Korean (partial) * Flounder (2001) * When the Pear Blossoms Fade * Welcome, Baby * Here Comes Cricket * The Tomb of a Ship  References  Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:South Korean writers ","title":"Paik Gahuim"},{"id":"41021089","text":"Acmanthina albipuncta is a species of moth of the family Tortricidae.

Tanaka was politically active in the Meiji Restoration and leader in the Freedom and Popular Rights Movement. In Japan's first general election of 1890, he was elected to the House of Representatives as a member of the Rikken Kaishintō, a liberal political party. He is most well known for his advocacy of rural residents around the Watarase River whose health and livelihoods were negatively effected by pollution from the Ashio Copper Mine in the 1880s. Tanaka also contributed to philosophical thought on nature in the early Meiji era.  Early Life  Tanaka was born in the Watarase River Basin. He was raised by his father, the headman of Konaka Village and principal of the Jōrenji Temple school in present-day Sano, Tochigi. Tanaka struggled with reading and writing in school, however, he excelled in aural memorization. For example he had the Confucian Analects and Mencius committed to memory. He was an apt farmer and engaged in some entrepreneurial farming projects during his youth. His community came to know Tanaka for his steadfast sense of judgement and responsibility. In 1857, Tanaka's father was promoted to superintendent of the eight villages that made up the domain. Even at the age of 17, Tanaka's village was happy to elect him as headman in his father's place, where he served for twelve years.  Political Activism  Tanaka participated in the Freedom and Popular Rights Movement through his position as headman in the village of Kanaka. The end of the Tokugawa era saw major changes in Japanese economic system, which allowed for a national market, domestic trade, and the commercialization of agriculture. Such changes created a stratified lower class, with village elites (Gono). Headmen like Tanaka were at the top tier of this newly stratified peasant class. As a headman, Tanaka rose up and challenged the feudal system made up of shogun government controlling the domain which encompassed his village. One of the only ways of doing this was through petition, which, Tanaka dedicated himself to at the risk his own life. In 1890, Gono took over local prefectural assemblies. These assemblies pushed against the oligarchical government and made demands on behalf of the peasant class they represented. The government halfway relented to these demands; however, it came at the expense of the Freedom and Popular Rights Movement. Although it took 10 years, successes of the prefectural assemblies eventually included a constitution from the emperor and an elected body. In May 1868, Tanaka was imprisoned for challenging a higher-ranking official. Tanaka submitted a petition which called for the official’s arrest for the embezzlement of government money. In prison, Tanaka was tortured. He was forced to maintain to stress positions for extensive periods of time and survived for 30 days by licking a stick of dried bonito.Tanaka was convicted of, \\"...disturbing the peace of the Fief, betraying the trust of his position (as Headman of Kanaka), plotting in a nefarious manner and submitting presumptuous petitions...\\". He was released from prison in 1869. After being released from prison, Tanaka taught in a small shrine. He studied with Oda Takizaburō in Tokyo before leaving for Iwate Prefecture. In 1870, Tanaka was arrested in relation to the murder of a man named Kimura. A biography about Tanaka Shozo, Ox Against the Storm by Kenneth Strong, contends that the blame shifted upon Tanaka was wrongful and likely due to his isolated position as an \\"...ex-peasant, with no samurai connections to protect him...\\" Kimura's son was eventually cross-examined and asserted that he had seen the killer before he left and that it could not have been Tanaka. He was placed in Iwate prison where he studied Jean Jacques Rousseau’s (1712–78) Du Contrat Social (1762) and Samuel Smiles’s (1812–1904) Self-Help (1859). He was released in April 1874. In 1879, he founded the Tochigi Shimbun (or Tochigi News), a periodical in which he discussed human rights and contemporary issues. Tanaka became a member of the Tochigi Prefectural Assembly in 1880, and served as its Chairman in 1886. In the General Election of 1890, the first ever held in Japan, Tanaka was elected to the House of Representatives as a member of the Rikken Kaishintō, a liberal political party. In 1902, Tanaka engaged in a political battle against the second Pollution Prevention Committee, which was an attempt to shift the blame of contamination from the Ashio Copper Mine incident to the movement of the river, \\"...they had concluded that only amounts of soluble copper were still reaching the rivers from the mine, committee held that the cause of current suffering was not mining, but flooding that agitated the polluted mud, allowing the embedded insoluble copper to escape and cause damage.\\" The second Pollution Prevention Committee adopted a zero tolerance policy on flooding, asserting that the Watarase and Tone Valleys, historically Japan's most fertile agriculture zones, were ill suited to agriculture and required massive reengineering to make the river system flood-proof. This schema nationalized rivers and required a village called Yanaka to be demolished to make way for a flood control reservoir. Tanaka moved to Yanaka and protested these measures. He did so through a philosophical discourse portending the ineffectuality and hostility of such measures. See philosophy section for more. This was Tanaka's final political campaign before death.  Ashio Copper Mine Activism  Tanaka is known for his anti-pollution activism and often referenced as Japan's first conservationist. Tanaka is best known for his advocacy in connection with the pollution caused by waste from the Ashio Copper Mine owned by Furukawa Ichibei. The events resulting from the mine's industrial waste are considered to be Japan's first experience with industrial scale pollution and the birth of Japan's environmental movement. Tanaka's early political efforts in 1891-1892 involved questioning the inviolability of property rights versus the public rights in article 27 of the Meiji Constitution. In the mid-1880s, people located on the watersheds near the mine, such as Watarase and Tone watersheds, began to observe and experience negative effects of the industrial pollution from the mine, such as dying fish populations, poor harvests, and ill health. In 1890, a large flood carried poisonous wastes from the mine into surrounding areas. The effects on the communities and industries in the area were deleterious, “Copper, arsenic, mercury and a host of other pollutants from the Ashio mine located at the headwaters of the Watarase river entered the river and destroyed significant agricultural, fishing and artisanal (silk, indigo) industries in the watershed.” In 1891, after having been elected to the National Diet via Japan’s first parliamentary elections, Tanaka gave a famous speech questioning why the Meiji government had not suspended Ashio's operations based on the Meiji Constitution’s guarantees of individual property rights. An activist uprising consisting of farmers, fishing households, soil scientists, Tokyo intellectuals, nationalists, anarchists, Christian socialists, and early Marxists developed against the environmental pollution caused by the mine. Tanaka was at the center of the farmers movement and also a member of the Diet. In 1891, Tanaka raised questions in the Diet as to the cause of the damage. Some historians assert that the National Diet had financial ties to the Ashio Copper Mine. In Trends on Ecology in Japan since 17th Century, author Ui Jun states, “... [the government's response to the Ashio Copper Mine was] not clear and superficial, because high-ranked officers had the vested interest with the mine, and copper was strategic important export product.” In 1900, villagers in the valley of the Watarase River, downstream from the mine, planned a mass protest in Tokyo, but were rebuffed by government troops and forced to disperse. In 1901, Tanaka resigned from the Diet. At 11:20 on the morning of 10 Dec 1901, Tanaka attempted to perform a jikisio, “...an illegal, out-of-channels direct appeal to the sovereign punishable by death.” As an act of sacrifice, he attempted to deliver a petition written by himself and radical journalist Kotoku Shusui, directly to Emperor Meiji, who was returning to his residence from the 17th session of the Diet. He was arrested, placed in jail for the night, evaluated for mental stability, and then released. Newspapers ran editorials and front page news stories about the “Jikisio Scandal” the following day. One success of this activism was the 1897 Third Mine Pollution Prevention Order. The order directed Furukawa, owner of the mine, to make mitigation efforts to control erosion and prevent waste from getting into the Watarase River. In 1911, the Diet passed the Factory Law, requiring factory inspectors to conduct pollution control. This law was Japan's first law to address industrial pollution; however, Tanaka was unsatisfied with the little impact the law made by the laws weak wording.  Philosophy  Tanaka was a leader in a larger movement re-conceptualizing nature during the Meiji period. His activism associated with the Ashio Copper Mine touches on the Freedom and People's Rights Movement's ideologies of Natural Rights and Utilitarianism, ultimately leading to the development of environmental politics in Japan. Tanaka’s political activism against the 1896 River Law led to the development of his ecological philosophy and terminology; poison (Doku) and flow (Nagare). This philosophy is described by Robert Stolz as an \\"...ecological theory of society based on the twin processes of nature...\\" In relation to the 1896 River Law, which sought to remake the Kanto Plain, Doku represented the unnatural damning of the river and the inevitable build up poisons in the watershed, while Nagare represented the natural way of things. Through his ideas on river flow, Tanaka predicted real engineering problems the dam would face. Tanaka believed his philosophy to be applicable, not only to nature, but to social and political situations as well. Tanaka further developed his environmental philosophy upon moving to Yanaka, where he pioneered the philosophy of Yanakagaku (Yanaka studies). \\"Yanakagaku was meant to be a method of living in harmony with nature’s flows.\\"According to Yanakagaku thought, the Japanese state's construction of dams and sluices inhibits the natural flow of the river, thereby increasing Doku. He studied ecology with the Tochigi water control research group by walking and surveying the river catchment. He died on tour of this practice.  Later Life  Tanaka was a supporter of local autonomy and the primacy of agriculture. He spent the rest of his life developing a unique environmental philosophy and encouraging villagers to protest against various environmentally harmful construction projects. After leaving the Diet, he lived in Yanaka village, now a district of the city of Sano, until his death by stomach cancer in 1913. At the time of his death, Tanaka was penniless. His last possessions were an unfinished manuscript, a book of the New Testament, handkerchief paper, river nori, three pebbles, three diaries, a bound copy of the Meiji Constitution, and the Gospel of Matthew in a cloth bag.

E. Blanton House is a two-and-a-half-story Craftsman style historic building in the community of Aloha in the U.S. state of Oregon. Built in 1912, it is situated along Southwest 170th Avenue less than a block south of Tualatin Valley Highway. The interior of the house is of the Arts and Crafts style. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989 and is used as a law office. History The land where Blanton House sits was first owned by Portland butcher Arthur Johnson. Starting in 1857 he began buying land west of Portland and eventually ended up with over that his estate sold in 1909 to the Merchants Savings and Trust. In 1907, the Southern Pacific Railroad started service in the area, which was converted to an electric interurban line in 1914, and had a station at Huber. The bank sold the land it had acquired from the estate to William A. Shaw, a partner in the Shaw-Fear Company. Shaw-Fear was a local real estate development firm, and Mr. M. E. Blanton was a road grader for Shaw-Fear. Blanton purchased the lot where the house stands in 1911, and the next year a 2.5 story home was built on the property along what was Huber Road, today's 170th Avenue, and what became Blanton Street. Blanton's employer developed the area and donated five lots to build a school, with Blanton grading the road through what was then the community of Huber. Tualatin Valley Highway was built in 1918 adjacent to the railroad. In 1922, Blanton sold his house to the Avondale Farm Company, with the property going through several ownership changes during the next thirteen years before Leonard H. and Alice M. Place bought it in 1935. The Places owned the home until 1949, and it was later used as a group home for drug and alcohol dependency. In 1929, the interurban railroad ceased service. Blanton house was turned into a commercial office in 1987. On March 2, 1989, the house was added to the National Register of Historic Places.. In 1989, attorney Lauren J. Paulson purchased the property and restored it. Washington County decided in 1999 to widen 170th Avenue, which would eliminate much of the yard and cause the removal of two arched entrance ways along with several trees. After a year of proposals, the project was approved in April 2001 despite neighbors objecting to the project, including Paulson. Paulson even filed an appeal with the Oregon Land Use Board of Appeals, but it was rejected in September 2001. As of 2013, the building was used as the law office for Paulson. Architecture Blanton House has with seven bedrooms over storeys, plus a full basement. There is also a matching pump house and small pool on the grounds. The pool was the only pool in Aloha. When the property was listed on the NRHP it also had decorative entrances to the property consisting of two archways, but those were removed due to a road widening project. The exterior is of the Craftsman style with horizontal lap siding and a hip roof. There are gables with truss ornaments and dormers in several places, plus a brick endwall on the south side. The building has two porches, and at the time of listing on the NRHP it had leaded, double-hung sash windows. Inside, the style is Arts and Crafts, which includes dark woodwork throughout. The first floor includes a living room, dining room, den, kitchen, foyer, and a small bathroom. The second and third floors consist of seven bedrooms and one bathroom, while the basement is unfinished. There are also a variety of pieces of built-in wood-furniture, such as a bench.

Life The son of Silvanus Taylor, a parliamentary committee-man for Herefordshire and supporter of Oliver Cromwell, he was born at Harley, near Much Wenlock, Shropshire, on 16 July 1624. Anthony Wood calls him Domville or D'omville by surname, but it is not clear that Taylor ever used that name himself. After Shrewsbury School, he entered New Inn Hall, Oxford, at the beginning of 1641. Taylor left Oxford to join the parliamentary army, in which he bore a captain's commission under Edward Massey. After the First English Civil War he became, by his father's influence, a sequestrator in Herefordshire. Initially the position was joint with Captain Benjamin Mason; after a sharp quarrel over the details of distraining money, and the accounts, Taylor emerged as the sole holder of the office. He was accommodating to the local gentry. At the Restoration of 1660, Taylor had to rely on patronage. Sir Edward Harley, appointed governor of Dunkirk in June of that year, took Taylor with him in the capacity of commissary for ammunition. He returned to London in 1663, out of work for nearly two years. Sir Paul Neile with others found him the keepership of naval stores at Harwich. He held the post until his death, which took place on 4 November 1678 at age 54. He was buried in the chancel of Harwich Church. Collector Under the Commonwealth Taylor had access to the cathedral libraries of Hereford and Worcester for manuscripts; from the latter he copied an original grant of King Edgar dated 964, printed in John Selden's Mare Clausum. Allegations of the time that he misappropriated the contents on a large scale are now rejected. Taylor left his collections for a history of Herefordshire at Brampton Bryan, the seat of Sir Edward Harley in the county; some went to the Harleian collection. His collections relating to Harwich fell into the hands of Samuel Dale, by whom they were published under the title of The History and Antiquities of Harwich and Dovercourt, … first collected by Silas Taylor alias Domville … and now much enlarged … in all its parts, with notes and observations relating to Natural History … by Samuel Dale, London, 1730 (second edition) 1732. The manuscript had been previously made use of by Edmund Gibson for his edition of William Camden's Britannia, by Richard Newcourt for Repertorium Ecclesiasticum, and by Thomas Cox for Magna Britannia. John Duncumb later used it for his Collections towards the History and Antiquities of the County of Hereford (1804). Taylor died in debt, and his remaining collections were sold by his creditors. Works The only work Taylor published under his own name was The History of Gavel-Kind, with the etymology thereof … With some observations upon many … occurrences of British and English History. To which is added a short history of William the Conqueror, written in Latin by an anonymous author, i. 2 pts. London, 1663; the Latin tract had been passed to Taylor from the Bodleian Library by Thomas Barlow. He dated gavelkind to an earlier period than William Somner. Magnus Imposter was an anonymous attack on Richard Delamaine the younger. Taylor, his father and John Tombes took against Delamaine for religious and personal reasons, and some linked to the local politics of the quarrel with Benjamin Mason and Wroth Rogers. Taylor left a manuscript play with Samuel Pepys for his opinion. He knew musicians: the Playfords, Henry Purcell the elder, and Matthew Lock. Two of his own compositions were published in John Playford's Court Ayres, London, 1655. Pepys heard an anthem of Taylor's performed in the Chapel Royal.

It was first published in 1977. The novel describes the eventful epic journey of the narrator, which seems to begin as a story of Cold War espionage but, involving life forces beyond Earth, finally leads to Jupiter. Plot summary The story is set in a future time where, after civilization decayed because of fuel shortage, the Outlanders came to Earth and provided energy from power beams, one to each of the political blocs; there is world peace because of the threat to cut off the power to either the Eastern or Western Bloc. Peter, the narrator of the story, lives in Idaho, USA; he is a student of Byzantine art and a part-time ski instructor. His father Anaxagoras, known as Alex, was a grandson of a Russian priest; Alex taught Peter to ski; he disappeared in the mountains while skiing, presumed dead, when Peter was fifteen. Peter arranges to spend a year at a Moscow university; before going, he finds he is being recruited as a spy. In Moscow, after a sequence of planned encounters, he acquires instructions for a journey to Georgia; on the way he is instructed to cross into Turkey by ski via a mountain pass. In the snow in the mountains of Georgia he meets his father Alex. They continue the journey; during a break Alex heats food with a battery, a source of power which he says would last billions of years. He says that he and Peter are Outlanders; there are two batteries, the one which was in America having been already removed from Earth after humans realized they could be independent of the power beams, which would threaten world peace; the remaining battery must be sent back. Alex says he will not go with him; that Peter is to go over the pass, where he will meet someone he recognizes. Telling Peter to leave and return, he turns up the battery's power and there is a huge explosion which produces a crater and melts the surrounding snow. At the centre of the crater Peter retrieves the battery and continues his journey. After a difficult crossing of the pass, he finds a mountain hut and meets Edelstam, a physicist whom he once taught to ski back in Idaho; he must be the man Alex mentioned, and presumably an Outlander. He says that the explosion was to make the world powers think the battery was destroyed, and to delay matters with fear of radiation. To cause a diversion, Peter is to continue with a substitute pack instead of the battery, which Edelstam takes away. In Turkey, Peter is picked up by local people in a truck; there is an explosion, seemingly caused by his replacement pack, and he later finds himself in hospital in Erzerum. Trying to leave the hospital, he is picked up outside and driven to a house in Ankara where he is interrogated by Russians. After eventually giving a muddled account of his contacts, he is given an injection which is meant to kill him; however he is revived and rescued from a coffin by another Outlander, who takes him to a farm to recover. Peter realizes that each Outlander has a particular function. Peter is taken to a house where there is a gathering of upper-class people, some of whom he supposes are Outlanders; the host receives him as an expert on Byzantine art. He talks to another guest and realizes he is to go to Mars to take part in an energy conference. From the Outlander space terminal in Anatolia he travels with other conference delegates to Mars; however on arrival he is unexpectedly transferred to another spaceship destined for Jupiter. On this second voyage Peter is accompanied by a Yorkshireman who plays cards extremely well but who seems unable to answer any of his questions. At the end of the journey Peter finds himself in a strange hall close to Jupiter itself. The hall is empty except for the physicist Edelstam, who has the battery. He says that he himself is not an Outlander, but is there to learn. He says that Outlanders are like robots, each with a speciality; the real power, says Edelstam, is with the Incandescent Ones, who have been around longer than mankind; they operate the power beams, and they control the Outlanders \\"through ideas in the mind; ideas appear which seem spontaneous, but which are not really so.\\" Peter is different from other Outlanders, \\"more complex, more all purpose, more given to responding to events as they arise.\\" The Outlanders Peter met regarded him as their boss. They see on a wall of the room an image of a skier on Jupiter, which seems to be a message from the Incandescent Ones. In a space suit and equipped with the two batteries (one on each ski), Peter skis on Jupiter towards a ball of light; arriving, he realizes he has come home. Technical details=The battery In the mountain hut in Georgia, Edelstam tells Peter that he has a notion of how the battery works, although the details are beyond him. He compares it to an ordinary battery, in which there are changes in how atoms fit themselves into molecules; in the Outlanders' battery he thinks the reconfiguration happens not amongst atoms, but in the nucleus of atoms, which has constituent particles and perhaps an unknown fine structure within that. Such reconfiguration would have the power of an H-bomb, which somehow is tightly controlled in the battery. The battery has no visible controls; Peter was unable to operate it. Edelstam, talking to Peter near Jupiter, speculates that Alex's specialty as an Outlander was to be able to send signals to the battery. The power beams There are two power beams, which originate in the region of Jupiter and are directed towards the Sun. They are out of the plane of Jupiter's orbit so that they are never intercepted by another planet or asteroid; they are reflected to Earth, one directed to the Eastern Bloc and one to the West. Nuclear research is forbidden on Earth, in order to ensure reliance on the power beams.

It was established in 1989 with the aim of reducing poverty and ensuring sustainable means of livelihood in what is now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. SRSP is part of the Rural Support Programmes (RSP's) initiated by United Nations Environment Programme Global 500 Award winner Shoaib Sultan Khan. It is now the largest regional RSP, with extensive outreach into communities. In recent years because of its vast outreach, SRSP has had to play a prominent role in disasters that have hit Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. As a result, humanitarian work along with development has become a core competency of the organization. Formation SRSP began it operations in 1989. It was established by members of the civil society, members of the government in their individual capacities, and members of the academia, media and training institutions. SRSP was created to replicate the Rural Support Programmes approach from the province now called Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Approach SRSP's framework is based on the Rural Support Programmes (RSP's) approach to community empowerment, and economic and livelihood development. At the heart of this approach is the belief that marginalized communities and disadvantaged people have within them the capacity for self-help. Pakistan’s Rural Support Program (RSP) movement pioneered bottom-up, community-driven development using a flexible, autonomous, politically neutral approach, which has been replicated successfully across PakistanPakistan as well as in India and Bangladesh. Programmes SRSP specialises in social mobilisation, gender and development, community infrastructure, education, micro-finance, micro- enterprise development, governance, conflict resolution, humanitarian assistance, and human resource development. SRSP’s wide array of programmes includes support for developing/sustaining/advancing: #Community physical infrastructure #Renewable energy #Community investment/livelihoods funds, microcredit, village banks #Social sector services #Human resource development #Enterprise and value chain development #Development and humanitarian programmes #Legal empowerment #Education #Health care Achievements Since its inception, SRSP has emerged as the largest non- government, non-profit organization in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. It works in 22 out of 25 districts in the province. In 2007 it also initiated a programme for community empowerment and economic development in parts of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). SRSP has organized over 21,000 Community Organizations, covering 500,000 households; one third of the members being women. It has established over 7,000 small-scale infrastructure schemes worth PKR 32.6 billion benefiting a population of more than 10 million. Its major community infrastructure schemes include drinking water supply schemes, farm to market link roads and bridges, sanitation schemes, irrigation channels, micro-hydels, mini dams and rehabilitation of schools. SRSP has also installed more than 180 micro hydro power plants across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, with production capacities ranging from 20 kilo-watts to 2 mega-watts. SRSP has played a significant role in leveraging resources and providing humanitarian assistance to disasters affected communities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and its contribution has been acknowledged by the Federal and Provincial Government. During the earthquake of 2005, it helped rebuilt 62,000 houses in one of the biggest community driven housing programmes, funded by the Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Programme (PPAF). In addition to this, 40 public, public-private and community-based schools were reconstructed enabling over 5000 children to return to school. Following the IDP crisis in Pakistan of 2009 and the Pakistan floods of 2010, SRSP emerged as one of the largest implementing partners for United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), reaching out to over 3.5 million Internally Displaced Persons (IDP's). SRSP has reached out to over 263,000 families with its flood response projects and programmes. SRSP, has remained one of the main partners of the government in the health sector and ran 570 basic health units (BHUs) throughout the province in 17 districts.

In the English Civil War he was first a Royalist captain and then in 1646 changed sides and joined the Parliamentary army. He was a captain in Ireton's horse (cavalry) in Ireland in 1649 and had risen to the rank of major by 1662. He was a Member of Parliament for the Irish constituency of Wicklow and Kildare in the parliaments of 1654 to 1658, and represented the Irish constituency of Meath and Louth in 1659. The Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell knighted him in 1656 and after the Restoration, he was also knighted by King Charles II in 1660. He was a commissioner of the English auxiliaries in France and an original member of the Royal Society in 1663. Biography Morgan was born in 1621, son of Anthony Morgan, D.D., rector of Cottesbrook, Northamptonshire, fellow of Magdalen College, and principal of Alban Hall 1614-1620. cites Foster, Alumni Oxon. 1500-1714, iii. 1027. The elder branches of the family were seated in Monmouthshire, where they possessed considerable influence. Anthony matriculated at Oxford from Magdalen Hall on 4 November 1636, was demy of Magdalen College from 1640 until 1646, and graduated B.A. on 6 July 1641. cites Bloxam, Reg. of Magd. Coll. v. 172. Upon the outbreak of the First English Civil War he at first bore arms for the king, and was made a captain. The prospect of having his estate sequestered proved, however, little to his liking. He therefore, in March 1645, sent up his wife to inform the Committee of Both Kingdoms that he and Sir Trevor Williams undertook to deliver Monmouthshire and Glamorgan into Parliament's hands if they received adequate support. He also hinted that he ought to be rewarded by the command of a regiment of horse (cavalry). Colonel (afterwards Sir Edward) Massey was instructed to give him all necessary aid. cites Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1644-1645, p.356. By January 1646 he had performed his task with such conspicuous success that Sir Thomas Fairfax was directed to give him a command in his army until a regiment could be found for him in Wales, cites Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1645-7, p. 313. and on 3 November following the order from the House of Lords for taking off his sequestration was agreed to by the House of Commons. cites Commons' Journals, iv. 713. Morgan, an able, cultured man, soon won the friendship of Fairfax. By Fairfax's recommendation he was created M.D. at Oxford on 8 May 1647. cites Wood, Fasti, ed. Bliss, ii. 106. On 8 October 1648 Fairfax wrote to the Speaker William Lenthall, asking the Commons to pass the ordinance from the Lords for indemnifying Morgan for anything done by him in relation to the war, and on 27 October he wrote again, strongly recommending Morgan for service in Ireland. cites letters in Tanner MS. lvii. 341, 391. Both his requests were granted, cites Commons' Journals, v. 668. and Morgan became captain in Ireton's regiment of horse. cites Spkigge , Anglia Hediviva, ed. 1647, p.325. Various grievances existed at the time in the regiment, and the officers, knowing that Morgan could rely on the favour of Fairfax, asked him to forward a petition to the general. cites his letter to Fairfax, dated from Farnham, Surrey, 16 Oct. 1648, together with the petition, is printed in ' The Moderate,' 1724 Oct. 1648. He took up his command in Ireland about 1649. cites Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1656-7, p. 103. In 1651 Parliament granted him leave to stay in London for a few weeks to prosecute some chancery suits upon presenting a certificate that he had taken the engagement in Ireland; cites Commons' Journals, vi. 606. and in 1652, upon his petition, they declared him capable of serving the Commonwealth, notwithstanding his former delinquency. cites Commons' Journals, vii. 169. By then He was a major. In the First (1654) and Second Protectorate parliaments Morgan represented the counties of Kildare and Wicklow, and in Third (1659) Meath and Louth. He became a great favourite with lord-deputy Henry Cromwell, and when in town corresponded with him frequently. states his letters from 1656 to 1659 are preserved in Lansdowne MS. 822. In July 1656 on being sent over specially to inform the Protector of the state of Ireland, cites Thurloe, State Papers, v. 213. he was knighted at Whitehall. The next year Henry Cromwell requested him to assist Sir Timothy Tyrrell in arranging for the purchase of Archbishop Ussher's library. At the Restoration Charles II knighted him, 19 November 1660, cites Townsend, Cat. of Knights, p. 49 and appointed him commissioner of the English auxiliaries in the French army. When the Royal Society was instituted Morgan was elected an original fellow, 20 May 1663, cites Thomson, Hist. of Roy. Soc. Append, iv. p. ii. and often served on the council. Pepys, who dined with him at Lord Brouncker's in March 1668, thought him a \\"very wise man\\". cites (Diary, ed. Braybrooke, 1848, iv. 380. He died in France between 3 September and 24 November 1668. states that the dates of the making and probate of his will (registered in P. C. C. 143, Hene; cf. Probate Act Book, P. C. C., 1668.

He was described as the \\"Son of God killer\\" in the media, having claimed to be the Son of God during a court-hearing before his trial. His victims died of burns and smoke inhalation after he threw a petrol bomb into the shop in which they worked. Witnesses described him \\"laughing\\" as he ran from the scene. Crimes Torto, who suffered paranoid schizophrenia and had a \\"history of assault\\", set out to target Hindus, Muslims and other communities in London. His first attack was on a newsagent in Tulse Hill on April 14, 2006. He threw a petrol bomb into the shop and caused serious burns to a customer, who later required skin grafts to his legs. Four days later, he attacked an off licence in South Norwood, leaving the owner with severe burns. Finally, on April 27, he fire-bombed a food-and-wine shop in Kennington. Of the four people then on the premises, two were able to escape by running through the flames, although they suffered burns as they did so. However, staff-members Khizar Hayat and Hamidullah Hamidi were trapped because the rear door of the shop was locked. They suffered burns and smoke inhalation before the fire brigade was able to reach them. Hayat was declared dead on arrival at hospital, Hamidi died five days later on May 2. Arrest and trial Witnesses had seen Torto \\"laughing\\" as he ran from the scene of the arson. Using their description, the police examined CCTV footage and saw Torto leaving the scene in a green Ford Cougar, which he had also used for his two previous attacks. The car was placed under surveillance and Torto was arrested leaving his home in Stockwell. The police searched his home and found a handwritten list of targets, which included gay clubs, hospitals where sex changes were performed, prostitutes and members of all non-Christian religions, including Muslims, Hindus and pagans. Torto refused to explain why he had carried out his hate-crimes and did not express remorse for the deaths and injuries he had caused. Detective Chief Inspector David Garwood, who had led the investigation, said: \\"Robert Torto clearly had a mission in mind and that was to attack people from a number of different communities with crude yet dangerous homemade accelerant devices. ... I am convinced that had Torto remained undetected he would have attacked again, which may have resulted in the further loss of life.\\" The judge at the trial, Peter Beaumont, ordered Torto to be detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act. He was sent to Broadmoor Hospital, a high-security hospital for the criminally insane. Psychiatric history Torto had a long history of involvement with police and mental services. In 1996, he confronted two Asian men, threatening them with a handgun and hitting one in the stomach. He was jailed for eighteen months for assault. In 1998, he twice targeted a supermarket, first telling the owner he would set him on fire, then saying he would blow up the premises. He was jailed for three months for using threatening words and behaviour and common assault. After release, Torto was examined by psychiatrists and prescribed anti-psychotic medication, but he failed to keep his appointments and was assessed again by psychiatrists in February 2001. He claimed he could influence the Ghanaian government and wanted the United Nations to ban sin. He was given a place at a psychiatric unit in March 2001, where he received compulsory medication, but after a month he \\"managed to fool doctors into letting him out\\". He seems to have had no further contact with psychiatric services until his arrest for double-murder in 2006. At a pre-trial hearing, he claimed to be the \\"Son of God\\".

Built in 628-630 AD, it is believed to be one of the oldest mosques in the world and along with Cheraman Juma Masjid in Kodungallur, Kerala and Barwada Mosque in Ghogha, Gujarat , the first mosque in India.Gibb & Beckingham 1994, pp. 814–815 Vol. 4. It has an Islamic heritage of more than 1000 years. It is located in Kilakarai, an ancient port town in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu known for its Islamic culture. It was built in 628–630 AD and was re-constructed in 1036. The mosque along with the others in the town, is one of the greatest examples of Dravidian Islam architecture. History and Construction Constructed by the Yemeni merchants and trade settlers of the pre-Islamic period in Pandiya kingdom ordered by Baadhan (Bazan ibn Sasan) Governor of Yemen at the time of Prophet Muhammad, after they accepted Islam in 625–628 AD at the time of Kavadh II son of Khosrau II (king of Persia). This mosque was rebuilt in the 11th century after saheed war. It is one of the oldest mosques of India. Bazan Ibn Sasan, Tamim Ibn zayd al ansari, Ibnu Batutah, Nagoor Abdul Cadir, Ervadi Ibrahim Sahib, Sultan of Ottoman Murad and other most famous Islamic scholars visited the mosque and Ibn Batutah said in his travel notes \\"it's the place of where most arab settlers live and he surprised to see them living as in Arab land\\". Structure  The mosque looks like a temple from outside and inside, but does not have any idol carving on the pillars or walls. There is the Mihrab on the wall like all mosques for identifying the direction of prayer, which is the only proof that it is a mosque. Elaborate carvings are present on the surfaces of the walls of the mosque and lofty beams are also present in the 'pallavasal' of the mosque. The mosque bears a Tamil architectural look, which implies a distinctive architectural pattern.

Joseph Connolly migrated from his native Ireland to Dekalb County in the mid-1830s. He settled lands that were ceded by the Creek (Muscogian) Indians to Georgia in 1821. The local government known as Fulton County was created out of part of DeKalb County in 1853. Mr. Connolly established two mills along the tributaries of Utoy Creek. The first was a grist mill on the Connolly family plantation farm that supplied local farmers with the means to grind dried corn into meal and grits. This mill was mentioned in the reports of Lowery's Confederate Brigade. Major General Patrick Cleburne's Infantry Division of Hardees Confederate Army Corps was posted along a ridge adjacent to the mill. The saw mill was built three-quarters of a mile away from the grist mill, on the main branch of South Utoy Creek—now the middle of GA Hwy 166. The large millpond supported the local lumber business. During the American Civil War, this millpond was noted as an obstacle to the US (Union) Forces of the XXIII Army Corps, Hascall's division, who attempted to break the line near the Connolly Grist Mill on August 18, 1864. The local Hopewell Church was destroyed by Union Army artillery fire during this engagement as the spire was used to aim at the opposing line. The two mills were in operation until 1910–1911, when the discovery that malaria was carried by mosquitoes led to the draining of the millponds by the US Army.

It is a major insect pest of rice. The damage to the crop is done by the larvae which form galls commonly known as \\"silver shoots\\" or \\"onion shoots\\". The rice plant is stunted and the seed heads fail to develop. History In 1890, an unidentified insect was found to be attacking the rice crop in Munger district of Bihar, in India. The English zoologist James Wood-Mason identified the insect as a midge, called it Cecidomyia oryzae, and wrote about it in the American Naturalist, but did not formally describe it. The original outbreak faded away, but another occurred in Mysore in 1901, and others followed. By 1922, the rice crop in Tonkin Province in northern Vietnam was devastated and in 1936, crops in Indonesia were being attacked. It was the Indian entomologist M.S. Mani who in 1934 formally described the insect, retaining the name given it by Wood-Mason, because this was already widely known. In 1941 the midge was reported to be damaging crops in China and in 1946, it was reported from Sudan. In 1951, the Chinese researchers Li and Chiu worked out its life history. Description The Asian rice gall midge is a fly about the size of a mosquito. The females are about long, bright red, with broad abdomens and dense short hair, while the males are slightly smaller, yellowish-brown and more slender. Distribution It is a major insect pest of rice in Southern and Southeast Asia. The pest is distributed in various regions of India, Asia, and other neighboring countries and farmers face many problems due to the monetary loss caused by this insect pest. It is also found in rice-growing regions of Africa. Life cycle The adults are mainly nocturnal and hide during the day. The females lay small batches of eggs (up to six) on the undersides of rice leaves. The eggs are red at first, but by the time they hatch, two to four days later, they are chocolate-brown. The tiny larvae crawl down the leaf sheath till they reach the leaf axil where they bore their way into the stem. After feeding for about ten days and forming a gall, they pupate inside. Four to seven days later they use spines on the tip of the abdomen to make a hole in the gall near its tip. Here the adult insects emerge. They live for three or four days, and there may be as many as eight generations of midge in the year. Damage The larvae of the Asian rice gall midge irritate the tissues of the rice plant which forms a gall commonly known as a \\"silver shoot\\" or \\"onion shoot\\". This is a pale cylindrical, hollow tube with a green tip replacing the normal culm (stem). The gall is formed from the walls of the leaf sheath growing together, after which the culm stops developing. The stem is stunted and the seed-head does not develop. When the adult insects emerge, the gall withers away and the shoot dies. The plant may respond by producing more tillers, but these usually become infected in their turn. The disease may be localised and patchy or widespread throughout the crop. ReferencesFurther reading *Bentur, J. S., and M. B.

Work Many of Choi's poems are about time and memory. She usually uses fragments of time and memory as tools for looking into others and the world, or for identifying herself. What ultimately emerges from her exploration of fragmented memories and chaos of time is the sense of emptiness and loneliness, which is the core of existence. Choi's poetic language is simple and condensed. She uses plain words and turns it around to make them unfamiliar and strange.\\"박상순\\" biographical PDF available at LTI Korea Library or online at: In Instances, her work is described as: :\\"There is a quality of imagination in her work that is still a rare thing in poetry—despite the opening up of form, content, and linguistic exploration that current innovative poetry has given us in the last few decades. Choi uses the image less for description than as enactment—almost as if the residue of the phantom in the poet’s brain were an action in itself—of reality.\\" :\\"Choi’s images are what might be termed “surreal,” but they are also “magical realism,” and at times quite abstract. ... Her style of image-making has odd wit and sweep; she makes the memory a layered reality that speaks to the current poetic moment. Her reality is a braid of metaphor, memory, intellect, and feeling. ... Images can be quite radical—and the dazzle of Jeongrye’s work can remind American readers about the mental variety and hopes for art brought from Modernism.\\" Choi has received several awards including the Modern Literature Prize in 2007, the Baekseok Literature Prize in 2012, the Midang Literature Prize and the Ojangwhan Literature Prize in 2015.

He passed that exam, becoming a petitions writer and started his work in the town of Bhalwal.  Acting career  Nand Lal was always keen on drama and theatre, performing the role of the character Kanut in a drama During his fifth standard in school. Always enthusiastic to take part in political and religious dramas, he later wrote the Ramayan in a drama form and organized a play on the same on navratras and Dussehra festivals. Along with performing the role of Dashrath in the play, he was the director of those plays, earning the moniker \\"Master Ji\\". In 1909, Lala Banke, a well- known freedom fighter and editor of the newspaper Jhang Sayal, came into contact with Master Ji in Jhang. This incident proved to be a turning point in his life.  Political life  In 1911, he moved from Bhalwal to Jaranwala in the district of Lyallpur, where he started working as a petition writer, and began considering seriously his political ideologies. In 1919, he went to Haridwar with some of his friends, and came across, Kana Bali, a female leader, giving a public lecture in support of Gandhi's call against the Rowlatt Act. This had a great impact on Master Ji's mind, who was so impressed that he fasted on her appeal. Subsequently, he witnessed Anti-Rowlatt Act protests gaining ground, mass hartals and non-violent satyagrahas, and this period of his life proved a milestone in shaping his political ideology as well his intent to participate in the National Movement actively. After returning home to Jaranwala from Haridwar he organized a public meeting to chalk out a political programme. Public processions, strikes and satyagraha methods were followed, including boycotting foreign cloth in favor of Khadi in support of the ongoing Non-Cooperation Movement. When Martial Law was proclaimed in Punjab against protestors, Master Ji was arrested in April 1919 and sentenced to 18 months of Rigorous Imprisonment. He was released early in January 1920 on grounds of general amnesty. During the Nagpur Session of the Indian National Congress in December 1920, some crucial changes were made in its organizational setup, following which the first Congress Committee was formed at Jaranwala of which Master Nand Lal became the General Secretary. Subsequently, he became a member of the Punjab Congress Committee, and General Secretary to the District Congress Committee as well. Later, he also served as the District Congress Committee's President for about three years. He remained a member of the All India Congress Committee from 1925 to 1957. In the coming years, he partook in all major National Congress-led struggles including protesting against the Simon Commission, the Civil Disobedience Movement and mobilized local public opinion through frequent meetings and processions. He was also highly active in taking up local issues and grievances. He was arrested in 1930 after he led a \\"jatha\\" (procession) in defiance of the Salt Act during the Civil Disobedience Movement. Master Ji was present at the historic AICC meeting at Bombay, where the Quit India Resolution was passed on 8 August 1942. He was arrested upon his return on 14 August and remained at Multan and Sialkot jails for the next three years. A few months after his release he was again arrested in July 1945 for defying restrictions and continuing political activity. Between 1919 and 1947, Master Nand Lal was imprisoned for nearly 11 years in various jails at Lahore, Multan, Sialkot, Dera Ghazi Khan, Ferozepur, Rawalpindi, etc.  Election to the Constituent Assembly  During the partition, Master Ji, along with his family, moved to India in September 1947, in order to avoid the riots in Jaranwala, and settled at Panipat in November. Master Ji initially lived with a Muslim family, Panipat still being home to a number of them. A \\"Basau committee\\" was formed to help the incoming refugees, and Master Nand Lal was appointed as its President. He also contributed, among other things, by helping bring the Model Town and Industrial Area Schemes to Panipat. Following the advice and support of some close friends and political leaders, Master Nand Lal applied for the reserved seats in the Constituent Assembly for the Hindu community. He was one of the two candidates elected by the Provincial Legislative Assembly and became a member in March 1948, and subsequently of the Provisional Parliament until 1952.  Later political life  He stood for the first General Election of the country in 1951-52, defeating Jan Sangh candidate, Dr. Gokul Chand Narang, vice-president of the All India Hindu Mahasabha, and became the first MLA from Karnal. He was denied a ticket for re-election in 1957 on grounds of ill health. Nevertheless, he helped organize the election campaign with the Congress candidate, winning by a wide margin. Lal died on 17 April 1959. ReferencesSources *Congress Hand-book by Indian National Congress. All India Congress Committee - 1946 - Page 10 *Debates: Official report by Punjab (India). Legislature.

He served as a well-noted and beloved catechist in his village and was entrusted with the local parish during World War II when the Japanese occupied the region. He stood up for religious values in the face of Japanese oppression and continued to hold secret services when the Japanese restricted him from active pastoral service. To Rot valued marriage - he himself had been married since 1936 - and he was an outspoken critic of Japanese views on taking multiple wives. His beatification was celebrated in Papua New Guinea in 1995. Life=Education and marriage Peter To Rot was born on 5 March 1912 on the New Pomerania island in the then-German New Guinea as the third of six children to Angelo Tu Puia (the well-respected village chief) and Maria Ia Tumul who had both converted to Roman Catholicism in 1898. His father taught him the basics of catechism and sent him to the local mission school in 1919 despite the fact that education was not an obligation at the time. He was quite agile in climbing coconut trees and he was more than willing to do this to acquire coconuts for older villages. It was rare for him to be mischievous at school but he was honest and quick to help those in need. In 1930 the parish priest of Rakunai - Father Laufer - asked his father if he would allow To Rot to start his studies for the priesthood. His father said that the time was not right for that but it would be more than appropriate if his son studied to become a catechist. In 1930 he began his studies at Saint Paul's College of the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart in Taliligap after which he was commissioned as a catechist for the parish of Rakunai in 1933 when the local bishop gave him the catechist's cross. To Rot then returned to his village where he would go on to aid Father Laufer. He was an excellent teacher and an organizer of classes for people and he had a Bible on his person at all times. On 11 November 1936 he married Paula Ia Varpit and the couple went on to have three children; one died as an infant and another died soon after the war. His final child lived into old age and was born after To Rot's death. The pair were married in a church though some of the local and traditional customs were observed. Catechist Once the Japanese forces occupied the nation in March 1942 (forcing an Australian garrison out) their soldiers interned all of the foreign missionaries though remained indifferent to religion on the whole. The parish priest left To Rot in charge of his parish and he became its active leader as a result of this. In this role he cared for those who were ill and poor while also aiming to better educate converts. Towards late 1943 the Japanese authorities restricted religious services and a few months later forbade them in full. But To Rot continued to hold them in secret and did not fear the implications on his own life despite the fear of those around him. The destruction of the church a short while later saw him build a \\"bush church\\" outside the village to hold secret services; he kept records of baptisms and weddings there. Metepa was married Christian and a policeman who worked for the Japanese; he lusted after a Protestant's wife named Ia Mentil. To Rot and Mentil's father prevented Metepa from kidnapping Mentil as his second wife and the furious officer reported him to his superior Kueka who summoned To Rot. The Japanese authorities had legalised taking a second wife but To Rot opposed this as being the opposite to doctrine. To Rot met Kueka who ordered that he cease his pastoral activities while meanwhile Metepa and another seized Mentil and beat up her husband. But To Rot and the village chief managed to find Mentil and get her back to Rakunai. This event served to augment To Rot's defense of traditional marriage with spies monitoring him to catch him in the act of piousness so as to arrest him. One couple reported him and the police arrested him after finding religious objects in a house search. He was planting vegetables to give to the Japanese when he was arrested on Christmas 1944. To Rot was taken to the police headquarters where the chief of the police Meshida asked if he was preaching to which the catechist affirmed. Meshida beat him on the face and the back of his neck and ordered him to be imprisoned. The Methodist chief of Navunaram and the Christian Rakunai chief failed to secure his release even though he told them not to fret over it. He confided to his mother that he would die but assured her that he was more than prepared to die for Jesus Christ if that was the case; he was locked in a small and windowless cell. To Rot was sentenced to two months' imprisonment in the Vunaiara concentration camp. On one occasion his wife and two children came to visit him and she begged him to give up being a catechist so he would remain safe. But To Rot was adamant he would not relinquish his responsibilities to the people. On the date of his death he said to his mother: \\"the police told me that, this evening, a Japanese doctor will come to give me some medicine. Surprising since I'm not sick. I suspect this is a trick\\". He told his wife to bring his cross and good clothes so he could go to God dressed in proper attire. Death He was given lethal injection in 1945 and then given something to drink. But the guards saw that the poison was slow so made him lie down while the doctor covered his mouth; he was stricken with convulsions and was held down as he died while being struck on the back of his neck with a beam.Upon his death a policeman went to Rakunai and said: \\"Your catechist is dead\\". The incredulous chief of the village demanded to know what the officers did to To Rot but the officer said: \\"He fell ill and died\\". His uncle Taura was sent to the prison with Commander Meshida to view To Rot's remains and to take them for burial.His remains were found warm and still curled up with cotton stuffed in his ears and nose with blood and a red scarf wrapped around his neck. The back of his neck was swollen and bore wounds and a clear needle mark was present on his right arm. To Rot's remains were soon buried in Rakunai. Commemoration Pope Benedict XVI - in 2012 - encouraged all married couples to look to To Rot's \\"example of courage\\" and he later dispatched Cardinal Joseph Zen Ze-kium to participate in the celebrations at Rabaul to mark the centennial of the late catechist's birth. The pope had discussed To Rot in his \\"ad limina\\" meeting with the Papuan bishops on 9 June 2012 while the Archbishop of Rabaul Francesco Panfilo issued a pastoral letter around that time addressing the life and example of To Rot. On 5 March 2012 the Papuan government issued a series of postage stamps in honor of the centennial of his birth. Beatification The beatification process began on 14 January 1986 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" to the cause and titled him as a Servant of God; the formal diocesan phase collecting documentation occurred in the Rabaul archdiocese from 21 January 1987 until 30 March 1989 when all documents were sealed in boxes and sent to Rome for the C.C.S. to review. The C.C.S. validated this inquest on 2 June 1989 and after received the Positio dossier from the postulation of the cause in 1991. Theologians approved the dossier's contents on 26 June 1992 as did the C.C.S. members on 1 December 1992. His beatification received approval from Pope John Paul II on 2 April 1993 after the pope confirmed that To Rot had been killed \\"in odium fidei\\" (in hatred of the faith). John Paul II beatified To Rot on 17 January 1995 while on his visit to Papua New Guinea. \\"Address of His Holiness John Paul II to the clergy, religious, and lay faithful of the parish of 'Mary Help of Christians'\\" John Paul II 16 January 1995 \\"Address of His Holiness John Paul II to the Bishops of Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands\\" John Paul II 17 January 1995 The current postulator for this cause is Fr.

He was capped twice for Norway. Olsen had two spells in Fredrikstad first-team squad, once in 1931 and another between 1938 and 1946, and won two Norwegian league titles and two Norwegian Cup while playing for the club. He also played bandy for Fredrikstad. Career Olsen was born in Fredrikstad, and made his debut for Fredrikstad FK in 1931. After an injury sidelined him, he started to play for Fredrikstad FK's bandy team. He scored two goals in the first ever bandy match played in Fredrikstad in 1935 and was a part of the Fredrikstad-team that won the district championship () in bandy in 1936. In 1938, Olsen was back in the first-team squad of Fredrikstad's football department, and won both the 1937–38 League of Norway and the 1938 Norwegian Football Cup. Olsen was also a part of the team that won the Norwegian league during the 1938–39 season and the Norwegian Cup in 1940. In the 1940 Norwegian Cup Final against Skeid, Olsen was named as one of Fredrikstad's best players along with Gunnar Andreassen by Fredriksstad Blad. No organized football was played between 1940 and 1945, because of the Second World War. Olsen was at that time involved in the Norwegian resistance movement Milorg. After the war was over, the Norwegian national team was meeting Denmark in a friendly match, which was dubbed \\"the independence match\\". The Football Association of Norway decided to primarily call-up players from the reigning Norwegian Cup champions, Fredrikstad. Six Fredrikstad-players started the match, and Thorleif Larsen, Bjørn Spydevold, Kjell Moe and Olsen made their international debut. Aged 34 years, 11 months, Olsen is the second oldest player ever to have made the debut for the Norwegian national time; Kjell Moe who was almost one year his senior and played in the same match being the oldest. Olsen made another appearances for the national team in the 10–0 loss against Sweden in Stockholm in October 1945. Olsen played all three matches against Lyn, when Fredrikstad lost the 1945 Norwegian Football Cup Final. After his retirement, Olsen was head coach of Østsiden IL between 1948 and 1951, and in 1954. He was also head coach of Fredrikstad in 1963. Personal life Olsen's brother, Ivar, was playing as a goalkeeper when Fredrikstad won their first-ever Norwegian Cup in 1932. Reidar Olsen died in 1997.

The vicinity, now part of metropolitan Atlanta, was the scene of the August 1864 Battle of Utoy Creek during the American Civil War and is today the site of Utoy Indian Village, a tourist center with renditions of historic Native-American structures and which offers a \\"Civil War Battlefield Tour.\\" History=Aboriginal period A branch of the Creek (Muscogian) people living on the boundary of the Chattahoochee and Cherokee lands existed since the 15th century in this area hunting local deer and farming maize, peas, squash, the polk plant and other items. They lived in wood cabins known as lodges which were filled with clay. Early settlers were taught to subsist in the Muscogian manner and to survive the winter using local herbs and plants. They were peaceful farmers who subsisted well with their neighbors. In 1521, the vicinity was likely visited by Spanish Explorer Juan Ponce de León in his travels looking for both gold and the fountain of youth. He traveled to modern day Atlanta up the Indian Sandtown Trail, today's Cascade Road. Colonial period At the time of the American Revolution the Muscogee (Creek) people maintained peaceful relations with the white settlers to the south who were fighting the British Army. In return in 1789 they were granted a treaty from the United States Senate ostensibly guaranteeing the sanctity of their lands. In 1816 a South Carolina Missionary from the Methodist Church named Gilbert ministered to the local Indians at the village of Utoy. In 1821 the US Government forcibly moved the local Creek Indians to Oklahoma on what is referred to as the so-called Trail of Tears. In 1822 the First US Post Office was established here the first in Dekalb at the former site of the Utoy Trading Post. The first settlers in the Atlanta area settled here as the lands had already been cleared and were ready for immediate farming. Existing trails, taking the form today of Sandtown Road, provided a major trading path that developed trade into the new county seat of Decatur from the Chattahoochee River. Civil War period : Full article: Battle of Utoy Creek In 1864 the town of Utoy was visited by US Forces moving to break the railroads at East Point. August 267th 1864 the Entire US Army moved down the Fairburn Road in the vicinity of the town of Utoy en route to Shadnar Church (Red Oak) to cut the West Point Railroad bringing supplies to the Confederate Army. Post-war years In 1933 the postal function was moved to Adamsville (The former village of Lick Skillet, named for the \\"Lickskillet Pub\\") and the Utoy post office was closed. In the 1950s the area became one of the most affluent suburbs of Atlanta with many prominent citizens residing here in Cascade heights. The housing boom with US Army veterans purchasing homes utilizing the VA Housing Guarantee caused great expansion of the former farmlands In 1975 the area became predominantly African American 85% and still maintained as one of Atlanta's affluent suburbs. Former Mayor Andrew Young, Shirley Franklin, Hank Aaron and the first president of the Savannah College of Art and Design are all from the area.

It was located East South East of the city of Chaumont, in the Haute-Marne department in the Champagne-Ardenne region of north-eastern France, between the main road and the \\"Ferme d'Heurtebise\\", west of the village of Laville aux Bois (in April 1919, French escadrille VB 101 stayed a few days on the airfield called \\"Laville aux Bois\\" in French Army archives). Overview The airfield was first leased by the Air Service on 11 October 1917, consisting of 89 acres. Air Service engineers constructed 12 wooden barracks and a mess hall on the site, plus five buildings to be used as warehouses and maintenance shops. A station administration building and a hospital clinic were constructed, plus an electrical grid and a telephone grid. The airfield had four French Bessonneau hangars erected.Series L, Miscellaneous Sections of the Air Service, Volume 11, History of the Design and Projects Section of the Construction Division, Gorrell's History of the American Expeditionary Forces Air Service, 1917–1919, National Archives, Washington, D.C.

A few weeks later, the 12th Aero Squadron arrived at Chaumont, also in its ground training phase, staying from 16 January to 2 February 1918. Chaumont Hill 402 Airdrome was selected as the Headquarters airfield for the nearby Headquarters, Air Service, AEF, which was stationed in the city of Chaumont; after February 1918, it was only occupied by a small detail of men, whose duty was to guard the Headquarters' aircraft. The airfield was placed back into combat status in September 1918, station for the 85th Aero Squadron 30 September – 4 November 1918 (De Havilland DH-4), initially on training then being part of the Second Army Observation Group (with some French escadrilles stationed on other airfields), when the later's HQ arrived on 25 October 1918 and stayed until been demobilized on 4 November 1918. The 1st Pursuit Wing had its HQ in Chaumont, 24 September to 17 December 1918, but most probably barracked downtown, which did not excluded liaison flying from the airfield. After the Armistice was signed, the 99th Aero Squadron, part of the V Corps Observation Group flew from 13 December 1918 to 19 February 1919, with detachments on Prauthoy, Bourbonne-les-Bains, and Montigny-le-Roi airfields, before starting its demobilization at 1st Air Deport at Colombey-les- Belles.Series \\"D\\", Volume 2, Squadron histories,.

The airfield was maintained for use by Headquarters until June 1919, when the Air Service in France was ordered demobilized and was turned over to the 1st Air Depot for de-construction. All hangars and other structures were dismantled, and all useful supplies and equipment were removed and sent back to the Depot for storage.

Originally built by Henry VIII in 1539 to protect England against the threat of invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire, it comprised a circular bastion, flanking wings and a keep, and in 1547 it housed 17 pieces of artillery. With its companion fortification at East Cowes, the castle overlooked the entrance to the River Medina, an important anchorage. The invasion threat passed but the fortification continued in use until the middle of the 19th century, very briefly seeing action in 1642 during the English Civil War. Decommissioned in 1854, the castle was first leased, and later bought outright, by the Royal Yacht Squadron to form their new clubhouse. The Squadron then employed the architect Anthony Salvin to rebuild large parts of it between 1856 and 1858. It became the headquarters for part of the D-Day invasion force during the Second World War, but has otherwise remained in use by the Squadron and is a distinctive landmark in yacht races along the Isle of Wight. History=16th century Cowes Castle was built as a consequence of international tensions between England, France and the Holy Roman Empire in the final years of the reign of King Henry VIII. Traditionally the Crown had left coastal defences to the local lords and communities, only taking a modest role in building and maintaining fortifications, and while France and the Empire remained in conflict with one another, maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of England seemed unlikely.; Modest defences, based around simple blockhouses and towers, existed in the south-west and along the Sussex coast, augmented by a few more impressive works in the north of England, but in general the fortifications were very limited in scale. In 1533, Henry broke with Pope Paul III to annul the long-standing marriage to his wife, Catherine of Aragon, and remarry. Catherine was the aunt of Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, and he took the annulment as a personal insult.; This resulted in France and the Empire declaring an alliance against Henry in 1538, and the Pope encouraging the two countries to attack England.; An invasion of England appeared certain.; In response, Henry issued an order, called a \\"device\\", in 1539, giving instructions for the \\"defence of the realm in time of invasion\\" and the construction of forts along the English coastline.; The Solent, a stretch of water that gave access to the ports of Southampton and Portsmouth, was considered vulnerable to attack. Two castles were built on the west and east sides of the River Medina, the entrance to the principal harbour of the adjacent Isle of Wight, and were intended to attack any enemy ships that might approach.; The castles took their names from the traditional term for this location, \\"the Cowes\\". Constructed in 1539, the western fortification, which became known as West Cowes Castle, had a D-shaped bastion at the front, a round, two-storey keep at the rear and two low buildings on either side, all of which mounted artillery guns.; ; The landward side was protected by a ditch wide and a stone wall at least wide at the top.; It was built from limestone ashlar stone, which may have been recycled from the demolition of nearby Beaulieu Abbey, a consequence of Henry's recent dissolution of the monasteries. Settlements grew up around both castles on the Medina, but East Cowes Castle was rapidly abandoned and ultimately destroyed by coastal erosion; as a result, today West Cowes Castle is often simply referred to as Cowes Castle.; Inspections in 1547 showed that there were 17 iron and brass artillery pieces at the fort, but that nine of these were inoperable; nonetheless it continued in use as a fortification after the original invasion scare had ended, staffed with a garrison of a captain, porter and three gunners during Queen Elizabeth's reign.; 17th–19th centuries 1725 plan of the castle Cowes Castle was used to house important visitors to the Isle of Wight and also as a prison; the captain of the castle had further responsibilities for managing the arrival of foreign vessels. When the English Civil War broke out in 1642 between the supporters of Charles I and Parliament, the castle was initially held for the King by its captain, Humphrey Turney. On 12 August, as tensions between the rival factions on the island increased, Turney personally fired one of the castle's guns at the nearby Parliamentary naval vessel Lion.; An unidentified Scottish naval captain then came ashore on 16 August and captured Turney, before landing more men and taking the castle for Parliament, who held it for the rest of the war. During the Interregnum, the castle continued to be used as a prison.; Charles I could not be housed in the castle while en route to his imprisonment by Parliament at Carisbrooke Castle in 1647 because the facility was full, and he stayed at a local alehouse instead. The Royalist Sir William Davenant was imprisoned in Cowes during 1650, writing the poem Gondibert while incarcerated.; As with East Cowes Castle, coastal erosion proved a particular problem for the fortification.; An inspection in 1692 reported that the walls were cracked and at risk of collapse, and the antiquarian Francis Grose observed in 1785 that the castle was \\"strongly fenced with piles and planks\\" to prevent erosion from the sea. During the course of the 18th century, Cowes became a fashionable location for visitors, with several bathhouses, one of them located beside the castle, and by the early 19th century the town had become a noted resort.; ; Cowes Castle was partially rebuilt in 1716 to modernise its accommodation. Most of the front of the keep was demolished and rebuilt with new windows, a turret for a spiral staircase was erected, new three- and two-storey residential wings were added, and a garden was created over the landward defences. In 1795, the writer Richard Warner noted that the garrison consisted of the captain, a porter, two soldiers, a master gunner and five regular gunners, their wages coming to £103 a year. The castle remained in use during the Napoleonic Wars, and in 1825 was equipped with eleven guns.; Warner had already complained, though, that the castle was \\"utterly useless\\" in military terms and a guidebook in 1824 echoed this judgement, describing Cowes as \\"useless as a place of defence\\" and ridiculing the sentries on duty there.; An engraving of the castle in 1796 Lord Anglesey became the captain of Cowes Castle in 1826, by now a sinecure rather than a regular military appointment, and spent part of each year at the castle, making further, lavish improvements to the interiors. Anglesey was also a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron, first established in 1815, which then operated from the Gloster Hotel in Cowes.; By this time yachting had become a prestigious local event; the painter J. M. W. Turner sketched the yachts sailing off the castle when he visited in 1827.; When Anglesey died in 1854 the government decommissioned the castle and leased the property initially to Anglesey's son-in-law Lord Conyngham, and then to the Squadron in 1855.; The architect Anthony Salvin, an expert on adapting medieval buildings, was employed by the Squadron to remodel the building between 1856 and 1858. He enlarged the house, altered its profile and built a new tower, platform and a gatehouse, along with a service wing, a ballroom and more accommodation for the members, at a cost of around £6,000.; ; Prince Albert and Edward, the Prince of Wales, visited the castle before it was formally reopened in 1858; the work received mixed reviews, one local newspaper likening the result to \\"a discipline establishment\\". Cowes became a major centre for yachting. After the destruction of William IV's miniature frigate the Royal Adelaide in 1877, its 21 brass cannons were donated to the castle by the Prince of Wales. 20th–21st centuries William IV's brass cannon at the castle in 2012 Cowes Castle was bought outright from the Crown by the Royal Yacht Squadron in 1917. Further development work was carried out on the property in the 1920s, and a ballroom in an adjacent hotel was purchased for use as an annexe for female members. The Isle of Wight became an important staging location for the Allied efforts to invade France during the Second World War. By October 1942, the castle was occupied by the British Admiralty and became the senior officer's headquarters of the HQ Naval Commander Force \\"J\\" Landing Craft base, known as HMS Vectis.; The force's vessels docked in the nearby Solent, and took part in the D-Day landings.; The castle was damaged during the German bombing raids on the island. After the war, the architect A. G. Biggs carried out substantial additions to the castle between 1962 and 1968, including remodelling the western range to provide for more female accommodation, using stone from the second East Cowes Castle, an 18th and 19th-century stately home, which had been demolished the previous year.; A prefabricated conservatory extension followed in 1988, and a new pavilion designed by Sir Thomas Croft was added in 2000.; Archaeological excavations in the winter of 2010–11 rediscovered the remains of the old castle wall and ditch, and more than 400 artefacts were removed for storage at the Isle of Wight County Museum. Cowes Castle is a distinctive landmark in yachting and powerboat events, particularly at the start and finish of local races.; It is protected under UK law as a Grade II* Listed Building.

He was a Lieutenant-Governor of the Isle of Wight, Early life Morgan's parentage is unknown. He married Catherine Urry, daughter and heir of Thomas Urry of Freshwater, Isle of Wight by 1691, and by the marriage, acquired the manor of Freshwater. He was an army officer in the Life Guards and was Brigadier and lieutenant by 1691. He was exempt and captain in 1692, guidon and major in 1694 and cornet and senior major in 1697. Political career Morgan began building up an electoral influence at Newtown and Yarmouth, and came into conflict with the new governor Lord Cutts who tried to bring the island's constituencies under government control. At the 1695 English general election Morgan was elected Member of Parliament for Yarmouth and signed the Association. He voted for fixing the price of guineas at 22 shillings in March 1695 and for the attainder of Sir John Fenwick on 25 November 1696. Under an electoral accord of 1697, he was returned unopposed at the 1698 English general election, and voted in support of a standing army on 18 January 1699. He was returned unopposed again at the two general elections of 1701 and was classed as a Whig. In 1702, he was appointed Lieutenant- Governor of the Isle of Wight, much to the annoyance of Lord Cutts, who still held a grudge against him and tried to prevent the appointment. At the 1702 English general election, Morgan was returned unopposed for Yarmouth again. He was returned again at the 1705 English general election and voted for the Court candidate as Speaker on 25 October 1705. He also supported the Court over the place clause of the regency bill in February 1706. He was returned as a Whig MP for Yarmouth at the 1708 British general election and voted for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell in 1710. He lost his seat and his position with the change of government at the 1710 British general election and did not regain them until after the Hanoverian succession. At the 1715 general election Morgan stood as a Whig at Yarmouth and Newport. He was returned at Newport and though initially defeated at Yarmouth was then seated after a petition on 12 April 1717. Thereupon he yielded the seat at Newport. He voted consistently for the Whig Administration. He was Lieutenant-Governor of the Isle of Wight again from 1715 until his death and was also governor of Cowes Castle from 1715 until his death in 1729. He was returned again at Yarmouth in the 1722 British general election. In the 1727 British general election he changed seats and was returned unopposed at Lymington. Death and legacy Morgan died on 19 April 1729. He left six sons and a daughter, but disinherited his eldest son, and left the Freshwater estate to his five younger sons. His second son Maurice was MP for Yarmouth.

The law is considered by some as \\"confusing\\" and \\"complicated\\", and containing \\"inconsistencies\\",Law Commission 2006, p.50. in November 2013 the Law Commission consulted about the possibility of reform. Much of existing UK law dates from pre-Victorian times. Wildlife was viewed as a resource to be utilised by the landowner or occupier, phrases such as \\"game\\" or \\"sporting rights” appear. Public opinion is now much more in favour of protection of birds and mammals rather than the landowners’ interests.Farm Law #189, p. 4. Scope A \\"wild bird\\" is: ...\\"Any bird of a species which is ordinarily resident in or is a visitor to the European territory of any member state in a wild state but does not include poultry or, except in sections 5 and 16, any game bird.\\"Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, Section 27 It is an offence to kill, injure, or take any wild bird, to have possession of a wild bird (alive or dead) or any part of a wild bird, to obstruct or prevent any wild bird from using its nest, to take or destroy a wild bird's egg, to have possession of a wild bird's egg or any part of an egg. It is also an offence to keep or confine a wild bird in a cage or other receptacle in which it cannot stretch its wings freely.Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, Section 8. A \\"game bird\\" is a pheasant, ptarmigan, partridge, or grouse (or moor or heath game).Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, Section 27. Historically the bustard was also a game bird but this has been hunted to extinction in the UK. A \\"specially protected wild animal\\" is: a badger, bat, wild cat, dolphin, dormouse, hedgehog, pine marten, otter, polecat, shrew or red squirrel.Law Commission 2006, p. 19. The law defines certain other species as vermin and landowners are permitted (or, in the case of wild rabbits, are required) to cull them. Enforcement Police can, without warrant, on suspicion with reasonable cause of an offence under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, stop and search; seize and detain evidence; or make an arrest.Law Commission 2006, p. 20. Most wildlife crimes are crimes of strict liability. There is a general defence for well-intended welfare-related actions such as taking an injured animal for tending or treatment, or for the euthanasia of a seriously injured animal that has no chance of recovery.Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010, Section 42 Generally, proceedings must be brought within six months of the prosecutor coming into possession of evidence which, in his opinion, warrants proceedings. They may not be brought later than two years after the date of the offence. The maximum penalty for most wildlife crimes is six months' imprisonment and a fine of up to £5,000. The Court may also order the offender to pay or contribute towards the prosecution costs.Farm Law #183, p. 20. History=Game laws The history of wildlife management begins with the Game laws, which regulated the right to kill certain kinds of fish and other wild animals (game). In Britain game laws developed out of the forest laws, which in the time of the Norman kings were very oppressive. Under William the Conqueror, it was as great a crime to kill one of the king's deer as to kill one of his subjects. A certain rank and standing, or the possession of a certain amount of property, were for a long time qualifications indispensably necessary to confer upon any one the right of pursuing and killing game. The Game Act 1831 protects game birds in England and Wales The Game Act of 1831 protected game birds by establishing close seasons when they could not be legally taken. The act made it lawful to take game only with the provision of a game licence and provided for the appointment of gamekeepers around the country. The purposes of the law was to balance the needs for preservation and harvest and to manage both environment and populations of fish and game. Emergence of wildlife conservation The late 19th century saw the passage of the first pieces of wildlife conservation legislation and the establishment of the first nature conservation societies. The Sea Birds Preservation Act of 1869 was passed in Britain as the first nature protection law in the world after extensive lobbying from the Association for the Protection of Seabirds. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds was founded as the Plumage League in 1889 by Emily Williamson at her house in Manchester as a protest group campaigning against the use of great crested grebe and kittiwake skins and feathers in fur clothing. The group gained popularity and eventually amalgamated with the Fur and Feather League in Croydon to form the RSPB. The Society attracted growing support from the suburban middle-classes as well as support from many other influential figures, such as the ornithologist Professor Alfred Newton. The National Trust formed in 1895 with the manifesto to \\"...promote the permanent preservation, for the benefit of the nation, of lands, ...to preserve (so far practicable) their natural aspect.\\" On 1 May 1899, the Trust purchased two acres of Wicken Fen with a donation from the amateur naturalist Charles Rothschild, establishing the first nature reserve in Britain.. Rothschild was a pioneer of wildlife conservation in Britain, and went on to establish many other nature reserves, such as one at Woodwalton Fen, near Huntingdon, in 1910.Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Northamptonshire and Peterborough During his lifetime he built and managed his estate at Ashton Wold in Northamptonshire to maximise its suitability for wildlife, especially butterflies. Concerned about the loss of wildlife habitats, in 1912 he set up the Society for the Promotion of Nature Reserves, the forerunner of The Wildlife Trusts partnership. During the society's early years, membership tended to be made up of specialist naturalists and its growth was comparatively slow. The first independent Trust was formed in Norfolk in 1926 as the Norfolk Naturalists Trust, followed in 1938 by the Pembrokeshire Bird Protection Society which after several subsequent changes of name is now the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales and it was not until the 1940s and 1950s that more Naturalists' Trusts were formed in Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, Leicestershire and Cambridgeshire. These early Trusts tended to focus on purchasing land to establish nature reserves in the geographical areas they served. Statutes This is a list of relevant statutes.

The period that he spent with the ICS in Assam evoked an interest in tribal cultures of that region that was of seminal importance. His research work was recognised subsequently with his appointment to the chair of William Wyse Professor of Social Anthropology at the University of Cambridge and with various honours.  Early life  John Henry Hutton was the son of a Church of England clergyman. He was born on 27 June 1885 at West Heslerton, then in the East Riding of Yorkshire and now in North Yorkshire. He attended Chigwell School in Essex and then obtained a third- class degree in modern history from Worcester College, Oxford in 1907.  Career  Hutton joined the ICS in 1909, spending most of his career in India in Assam. He held positions as a Political Officer and as a Deputy Commissioner, for which his duties included undertaking lengthy tours within the Assam region to inspect facilities and infrastructure as well as to settle legal disputes. To his role as Deputy Commissioner was added in 1920 that of Honorary Director of Ethnography for Assam. Between 1929 and 1933 he was Census Commissioner, having responsibility for organising the 1931 census of India and compiling the subsequent report on it. Hutton's interest in anthropology was piqued around the time of his 1920 appointment. He was encouraged in his researches by Henry Balfour of the Pitt Rivers Museum, who visited Hutton in the Naga hills. Many published works on the tribal culture of the area were written by him from 1920, including the seminal The Angami Nagas and The Sema Nagas, which earned him a DSc from the University of Oxford in 1921. Later, during official discussions about the formulation of the Government of India Act 1935, Hutton worked with some success to protect the interests of tribal minorities despite opposition from Indian nationalists who suspected that it was a scheme intended to divide the country. Hutton resigned from the ICS in 1936 for family reasons, and possibly also because he wanted to devote more time to his research. In 1937, he succeeded T. C. Hodson as William Wyse Professor of Social Anthropology at Cambridge University, where he was also elected a Fellow of St. Catharine's College. In writing Caste in India, published in 1946, he was able to draw on his experiences in charge of the 1931 census. In other works he demonstrated an interest in comparative anthropology, writing of possible links between the culture of the eastern Himalayas and other megalithic cultures in south-east Asia and in Oceania. He retired from his professorship in 1950 and was made an honorary fellow of St. Catharine's in 1951.  Death  Hutton died on 23 May 1968 at his home in New Radnor, Radnorshire. A fellow anthropologist of India, Christoph von Fürer- Haimendorf, said in an obituary that the death of Hutton \\"... ended a chapter in the history of British anthropology. He was the last of the distinguished class of civil servants who in their time contributed so greatly to the knowledge of the indigenous peoples of Britain's far-flung empire and in a later phase of their career achieved positions of eminence in academic life.\\"  Family  Hutton married Stella Eleanora Bishop, a widow, in 1920. The couple had two sons and a daughter. Stella died in 1944 and in 1945 he married Maureen Margaret O'Reilly.  Honours and legacy  Hutton had assisted in quelling a rebellion by the Kuki tribal people between 1917–19 and was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire for that work. He was High Sheriff of Radnorshire in 1943 and President of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland (RAI) in 1944–45. He had won the Rivers Memorial Medal, awarded by the RAI, in 1929 and the silver medal of the Royal Society of Arts in 1932. He gave the Frazer Lecture in 1938. Kathleen Gough was among his doctoral students and von Fürer-Haimendorf was among those who were inspired by him. He loaned to the Pitt Rivers Museum, and later donated, his collection of tribal materials accumulated while in Assam.

With the exhibition \\"TAKING CARE – Designing for the Common Good\\", the TAMassociati curatorial team has developed inside the Italian Pavilion the theme of architecture as a social art and an instrument in the service of the community, ensuring its access to the common goods. The reflection was embodied in an initial theoretical section (“Thinking”). Then a double section in the middle presented good architectural and social practices that give visible form to the idea of the Common Good (“Meeting”). Finally there was an explicit call to action in favor of communities in degraded and marginal areas (“Acting”). The catalogue and the media that recount the curatorial project used original and immediate displays and methods of communication.

He is best known for his early association with and promotion of the Mellotron, a tape-based sampling keyboard, and for co-writing the theme music for the first On the Buses film. Biography Unwin was born on 8 October 1936 and grew up in Norris Green, Liverpool. He studied at a branch of the London College of Music in Liverpool and started playing in variety theatre in 1947. By 1962, he was working in The Magic Carpet Inn in Chelsea, London, where he was spotted by big band leader Eric Robinson and television personality and magician David Nixon. He started working for Robinson and Nixon through their company Mellotronics, and it was through this association that he became the featured artist on Mellotron promotional appearances, both live and on television and radio. He featured on a ten-minute promotional film made by Pathé that was regularly shown in cinemas and appeared on the children's television show Blue Peter, demonstrating the Mellotron to Valerie Singleton. Unwin claims to have visited John Lennon when Lennon was living in Weybridge, Surrey in the mid-1960s \\"to give him a few pointers\\" and toured South Africa in 1966. Unwin left Mellotronics in 1969 and started working for EMI as an A&R; man and producer, where he composed the music for the first film version of On The Buses, including co-writing the theme tune with Roger Ferris. Unwin moved to Spain in the mid-1980s after his daughter, Naomi, decided to relocate there after getting married but returned to the UK in 1988. Naomi later found fame on the Spanish television show Un, Dos, Tres.

Peter Robert Keil (born 6 August 1942 in Züllichau, Brandenburg)Allgemeines Künstlerlexikon, S. 519Eingegrenzt – Ausgegrenzt, S. 615 is a German painter and sculptor.  Life  Peter Robert Keil was born to an artist blacksmith father whom he lost very early in his childhood during World War II. During the end phase of the war, Keil's mother, also an artistically talented woman, took her son and struggled her way to West Berlin where they settled. This is where Peter Robert Keil grew up in the working-class neighbourhood of Berlin-Wedding and where he discovered his interest in painting – particularly in expressionistic artists and in Pablo Picasso's work.Allgemeines Künstlerlexikon, S. 520 From 1954 on, the East Berlin-based painter Otto Nagel became his mentor and taught him first craft skills and painting techniques.Lexikon Künstler der DDR, S. 425 In 1954, he began his traineeship as an artist metalworker and between 1959 and 1961, he studied at the University of Arts in Berlin. When the Berlin Wall was built, he lost contact with his mentor Otto Nagel and from the early 60s on, Keil started to spend more and more time abroad. During his studies at the University of Arts in Berlin, he came in contact with numerous other artists who later became influential artists of their generation, like for example Georg Baselitz, Eugen Schönebeck, Markus Lüpertz and Joachim Schmettau.ArtProfil 90-2011, S. 16ArtProfil Heft 2 2007, S.47 During his time in Mallorca, he also met with Joan Miró in his studio several times. From the early 60s on, Keil established studios in Paris, London, Berlin and in the US. Today he mainly lives and works in Zimmerau (Bavaria, Germany), Berlin and Los Angeles.  Techniques and works  In the beginnings of his artistic career, Peter Keil's style was influenced by German expressionism. In the works from his early Berlin years, he mainly focused on typical big city settings and characters on the fringes of society. However, his style changed visibly at the beginning of the 60s when he lived in Paris for a while and emerged in the city's nightlife. Keil increasingly parted with his realistic approach and developed a new, much more spontaneous and dynamic painting style which he developed further during his years in London and finally during his time as one of the \\"Berliner Neue Wilden\\" at the beginning of the 80s.ArtProfil 96-2013, S. 44 Since then, the use of intensive to lurid colours and the absence of realistic representation have become characteristic of his painting style.ArtProfil 93-2012, S. 33 In his paintings, the colour is applied with quick brushstrokes and occasionally with impasto techniques and the images are additionally abstracted by the use of Graffiti elements. Keil prefers to paint human figures, portraits, big city scenes, landscapes and still life images of flowers. His emotional way of painting is mainly driven by a desire for freedom from social constraints and conventions. In the past 50 years, he has created numerous large- and small scale paintings in oil and mixed media on canvas but also some sculptures in wood and steel and a great number of majolicas.

The album was released through Mute Records on 11 November 2013 in the UK, and 12 November 2013 in North America. The album has a holiday music theme, including classic Christmas carols with original tracks written by band members Vince Clarke and Andy Bell. The band purposely went with a \\"stripped-down\\" and \\"eerie\\" feel to many of the tracks. Clarke has stated, \\"Everything about Christmas has been written already. We thought it would be more interesting to look into the darker side of the season. For a lot of people, Christmas is not a happy time.\\" The album was produced with longtime collaborator Gareth Jones. Snow Globe was preceded by the first single \\"Gaudete\\" on 28 October, a medieval Latin carol that was also a hit for Steeleye Span in 1973. The second CD of the limited edition of Snow Globe also includes an acoustic cover version of the 1980s Christmas pop hit \\"Stop the Cavalry\\" by Jona Lewie. Commercial response to the album was limited, Snow Globe appeared briefly at the lower reaches of the albums charts peaking at #49 in the UK and at #100 in Germany. The album reached #5 in the UK indie albums chart and #30 in US indie album chart. Track listing Snow Globe was initially released as a standard CD, a digital download, and a limited edition 3-CD box set which includes the original album as well as alternative versions. The box set, produced in a single run of 3,000 copies, contained an autographed Christmas card, red 'Erasure' branded Christmas tree ornament, a desktop calendar, postcards, 'Erasure' branded balloons (one red, one green), windows stickers, a bag of sweets, and a cocktail book. It sold out via pre-orders before the official release date. In 2014, an extended \\"Deluxe Nutcracker Edition\\" digital download was made available including the album, all additional tracks from the second disc of the box set, as well as additional remixes - comprising 29 tracks in all, as well as the videos for \\"Gaudete\\" and \\"Make It Wonderful\\".

The parkland includes a pond, play maze, bocce court, Venusburg mound, small licensed zoo (Cedars Nature Centre), café, beautiful benches and a wide range of palace ruins that are still standing today. The park has received a Green Flag award every year since 2009. History Cedars Park is the site of a 16th-century Royal Palace known as Theobalds Palace which was built between 1564 and 1585 by Sir William Cecil.http://library.thehumanjourney.net/77/1/BROXCP07.pdf On his accession, James I persuaded William's son Sir Robert Cecil to exchange Theobalds Palace, the royal palace on the site of the present Cedars Park, for Hatfield House, so that it became a Royal Palace.Borough of Broxbourne. Cedars Park. Conservation Management Plan. April 2008 James I dramatically extended the park and buildings.

Conservation Management Plan. April 2008James I died here in 1625. Charles I rarely used Theobalds Palace and granted the estate to various nobles as an acknowledgement of their services until it was sold to the Prescott family in the late 1700s, when it underwent great changes. In 1820, Theobalds including the new mansion The Cedars built by the Prescott family rented it out to Sir Henry Meux in 1820. In 1921 The Cedars was given to the town of Cheshunt by Admiral of the Fleet the Hon. Sir Hedworth Meux and a public park was created, demolishing the house. Sir Hedworth Meux, formerly The Hon Hedworth Lambton, had been involved in the siege of Ladysmith and inherited The Cedars from Valerie, Lady Meux on condition that he change his surname to Meux. The park was donated to the public in 1919 by Admiral of the Fleet the Hon. Sir Hedworth Meux. On 2 July 1921 Cedars Park was officially opened by the Earl of Cavan and Admiral Meux.Borough of Broxbourne. Cedars Park Conservation Management Plan. April 2008.

It was located near the commune of Haussimont, in the Marne department in north-eastern France. Overview The airfield was originally built for the French \\"Aeronautique Militaire\\", perhaps as a satellite to the observation school at nearby Sommesous. In early 1918, it was turned over to the Air Service, United States Army, and used by the 99th Aero Squadron from 11 March 1918, in charge of flying for the US 3d Artillery Observation School which had been created at the Mailly-le-Camp training grounds. On 31 May, the squadron received orders to move to Amanty Aerodrome, where it worked for the I Corps Observation Group School. The airfield sheltered two pursuit Aero Squadrons (13th and 95th) from 11 May to 24 June, most likely for their further training, as the airfield was rather far from the front line and they both were at their final stage of organization. The airfield was located at the southwest corner of the N 4 and D 318 crossroads, south of Haussimont - the other corners being occupied by artillery depots.Series \\"D\\", Volume 2, Squadron histories,. Gorrell's History of the American Expeditionary Forces Air Service, 1917–1919, National Archives, Washington, D.C.

The church was built in 1865, and the architect was William Butterfield. History In 1865 the curate of Holy Trinity, Brompton, the Reverend R. R. Chope, had a temporary iron church put up in his garden off Gloucester Road, and there he would conduct services which, for one writer of the time, were \\"the nearest approach to Romanism we have witnessed in an Anglican church … if indeed it be not very Popery itself under the thinnest guise of the Protestant name\\". Finding the temporary church inadequate, a group of influential members of his congregation approached the Church Commissioners later that year with a request for the formation of a new parish in South Kensington to be known as St Augustine's. They offered a 'benefaction' of £100 per annum, stipulating that the first incumbent should be Mr Chope. Retrieved 15 January 2016. As there was no shortage of churches in the neighbourhood, the Bishop of London, A. C. Tait, objected strongly to the proposal and it was not until after he became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1868 that a site was purchased and the new parish formed. It was a difficult site, for although plans had been formulated to extend Queen's Gate to Old Brompton Road, at this time the road went no further than the crossing of Harrington Road. Access to the site had to be made through what is today Reece Mews, and the church plan was aligned with this. This accounts for the strange angle the church presents today in relation to Queen's Gate. William Butterfield was appointed architect, and the estimated cost of his plan was £18,000. As there was not enough money, it was proposed to build the church in two stages. The nave and aisles were ready for services in 1871. The chancel and sanctuary were completed in 1876. The seating capacity was for 853 people. Gerald Hocken Knight was organist of St Augustine's from 1931 to 1937. Present day In 2010, St Augustine's was joined with the neighbouring parish of Holy Trinity Brompton (HTB). It was fully absorbed into its parish in March 2011, with the parish being renamed \\"Holy Trinity w St Paul, Onslow Sq and St Augustine, Sth Kensington\\". Unusually, given that HTB is a charismatic evangelical Anglican church, St Augustine's has \\"kept its Sung Eucharist, vestments and incense\\". It stands within the Modern Catholic tradition of the Church of England. The Revd Paul Cowley, a curate of HTB was assigned to St Augustine's as its 'pastor'. He had no previous experience of High Church Anglicanism, having trained for ordination at Oak Hill College (a conservative evangelical theological college) and served as a minister of HTB (a charismatic evangelical church). Though he leant the High Mass that was the main service of St Augustine's, he made a number of changes: a faculty was obtained to remove the pews and replace them with chairs but original pews as agreed with English Heritage are clearly on display in various parts of the building. Clergy from HTB wear albs and coloured stoles appropriate to the liturgical seasons to celebrate the weekly 11 am Sung Eucharist. There is also a service of Holy Communion at 9 am . A more informal, evening service was also introduced though this now takes place at St Paul’s Onslow Square. In November 2018 The Revd Tom Jackson took over from Revd Paul Cowley. Under both these priests the congregation has flourished and grown and is an example to the rest of the church as to how different church traditions can happily and fruitfully coexist in a spirit of mutual understanding and respect.

The term \\"Kong Kids\\" was coined in 2009 in a book titled Kong Kids: The Nightmares for Parents and Teachers published by MingPao. The book summarizes five negative characteristics common in children born in Hong Kong after the 1990s. The book cited parents who spoil their children from an early age as the party responsible for the upbringing of \\"Kong Kids\\". Treating their children like \\"princes and princesses\\", parents tend to spoil their children with material gifts and money (not dissimilar to the \\"little emperor syndrome\\" prevalent in mainland China). In addition, parents often have a hand in tackling everyday, trivial problems that their children might face, limiting opportunities for the children to problem-solve on their own. Growing up under a spotlight, children often develop a self-centred personality, believing that the Earth revolves around them. It's also likely for Kong Kids to have a short temper when faced with problems, since they are not used to solving problems on their own. These harmful habits and characters may influence future generations, forming a vicious cycle. Description They are typically born during the 1990s to 2000s, are middle-class families, and are pampered and spoiled by domestic helpers. Kong Kids typically have several common characteristics. For young children, they often lack life skills, such as bathing, cooking, and tying shoelaces. They are used to relying on their parents and foreign domestic helpers.Parry, Hazel. Hong Kong kids need to learn self-care skill. South China Morning Post. 7 May 2013. According to a survey by People's Daily Online, almost half of the parents who responded said that their children cannot eat, bathe or dress themselves independently and 15% of the respondents even said their children could not use the toilet independently. When faced with difficulty, \\"Kong Kids\\" expect others to solve the problems, because they are inexperienced with managing setbacks and have low self-esteem. They are usually emotional and self-centered. With low Emotional Quotient (EQ), Kong Kids cannot control their emotion in any circumstances, such as dealing with unpleasant situations. They want to be under the spotlight and cared for by everyone. Kong Kids are almost always not willing or able to solve problems by themselves. Being afraid of failure, they evade adversity and rely on parents. They are usually weak in interpersonal communication and self-control. Being self-centered, they cannot put themselves into others' shoes and respect others' opinions. They lack basic manners and come into conflicts easily. Most of the parents are over- protective of their children and shield them from difficulties and injuries. They are often referred to as \\"monster parents\\". Parents usually hire foreign domestic helpers to take care of their children, spoil them excessively and satisfy most of their requests. Indulging by parents may lead children to narcissism. Kong Kids often love chasing new trends and pursuing well-known brands. Most of them own brand name goods and electronic gadgets such as mobile phones, iPads, iPods, digital cameras, etc. They do not treasure what they have and look for a materialistic life. Causes Nowadays, Hong Kong families typically have one or at most two children. According to some educational experts, some so-called 'monster parents 'protect their children so well that they do not allow children to experience any setback.\\"Helicopter Parents\\"? \\"Monster Parents\\"? \\"Free-Range Parenting?\\" – Part 2 – I Am Not a Monster Parent\\". Lifetime Development. For instance, in 2010, the Hong Kong students could not get on the planes because of a snowstorm in London. The parents then strongly requested the government to assist students stranded at the airport. This issue induced a lot of criticisms towards parents because of their over-protection. The over-protected children hence have low resilience and can hardly overcome difficulties, which results in Kong Kids.Hong Kong Kids. Ming Pao. 1 January 2011. Most parents in Hong Kong also work full-time. This frequently means they employ a foreign domestic helper to take care of their children. According to a survey, nearly 90% of parents employ a foreign domestic helper to take care of their children. The domestic helpers are not responsible for correcting children's behaviour even though the kids behave wrongly. Therefore, some children become rebellious, impolite and disrespectful of others - characteristics of Kong Kids.培養孩子自理能力的重要性. Mama Station. 11 October 2010. Finally, Hong Kong is an exam-obsessed city where most parents emphasise their children's academic results. The parents understate the need for resilience in their kids. Some children are expected to focus exclusively on academic matters, and not housework or other chores. As a result, these kids become dependent, both physically and psychologically, that is, they become Kong Kids.Exam-obsessed Hong Kong makes celebrity tutors rich . Tengri News. 31 May 88881 Effects=Dependent individuals Kids with \\"Kong Kid\\" symptoms have little ability to care for themselves and poor problem-solving skills. When faced with adversity, they immediately give up which can lead to feelings of melancholia and, in serious cases, suicide. Kong Kids tend to remain childlike and stunted psychologically. For instance, in 2011, a snowstorm paralysed the London Heathrow Airport, many Hong Kong students who came home for holiday were stranded at the airport.\\"Hong Kong Kids\\"家長不成長「港孩」如何成長？. Ming Pao. 2011-01-11 They stayed in the banquet rooms of hotels or slept in the airport. During that period, those Hong Kong students complained continuously about the situation and that the banquet rooms were like concentration camps. Kong Kids have negative effects on themselves. Being spoiled, they do not know how to take care of themselves but to depend on others to live their lives. Therefore, Kong Kids have low self-care ability when compared to normal kids. For most of the time, Kong Kids' parents will help them to deal with all difficulties they face, such as handling conflicts between friends and communicating with teachers. In short term, Kong Kids lose a lot of social chances and cannot deal with hurdles by themselves while in long term, Kong Kids will lack essential communication skills and initiation of solving problems.家 長 聘 外 傭 礙 「 港 孩 」 獨 立 . Sing Tao. 20 August 2010 Poor family situations and relationships Because the children rely excessively on others for care, this pressures parents to be responsible for their child's actions. The embarrassment and frustration of managing children's poor behavior at home and in public prevents the growth of a healthy parent-child relationship and parents may feel frustrated and humiliated by their children's behavior.  Burdens for Hong Kong's society  Children are the future generations, but Kong Kids may not be equipped to survive in the real world as they are unable to interact with and accommodate others. They do not cherish what they have and are less able to tolerate hardships at work and are at risk for termination of employment. This decreases the effectiveness of the workforce. Kong Kids also negatively impact society. Depending on their parents, Kong Kids have low problem-solving abilities. As a result, once they step into society, they cannot solve problems efficiently, decreasing the productive potential of society. Because their parents solve their problems for them, Kong Kids usually lack motivation to work. The short supply of motivated and enthusiastic citizens reduces the society's competitiveness and therefore its affluence.唔識綁鞋帶 港孩堪憂.Oriental Daily. 23 May 2010. Solution To avoid children becoming Kong Kids, parents and schools need to cooperate.黃明樂着，《港孩》，明窗，2009年。 According to child and education psychologists, parents should stop over-protecting their children and allow them to learn life self-care skills from daily life like buttoning shirts, tying shoe laces and feeding themselves. They should explain to their children the importance of these skills but not simply tell them to follow. Moreover, parents need to give children room to learn being independent. In order to equip children with the ability to cope with adversity, when they face difficulties, parents should let children solve it on their own rather than tackling it for them. While at school, teachers should guide students to develop interpersonal skills. This is a rare opportunity at home as the family size are usually small. In media In the book Kong Kids: The Nightmares for Parents and Teachers,黃明樂著,《港孩: 父母教師的噩夢》, 明窗出版社有限公司, 2009年10月. written by Wong Ming Lok, Hong Kong Children are defined as those born from the middle of 90s to the early 2000s, which is an affluent era with information explosion.
