Shortgrass prairie in relation to the Great Plains of the United States The shortgrass prairie is an ecosystem located in the Great Plains of North America. The prairie includes lands to the west as far as the eastern foothills of the Rocky Mountains and extends east as far as Nebraska and north into Saskatchewan. The prairie stretches through parts of Alberta, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Kansas, and passes south through the high plains of Colorado, Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico.Hill, R.T. 1901. Geography and Geology of the Black and Grand Prairies, Texas. In: Walcott, C.D. (ed), Twenty-First Annual Report of the United States Geological Survey to the Secretary of the Interior (1899-1900), Part VII - Texas, 666 pp. The prairie was formerly maintained by grazing pressure of American bison, which is the keystone species. The two most dominant grasses in the shortgrass prairie are blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) and buffalograss (Bouteloua dactyloides), the two less dominant grasses in the prairie are greasegrass (Tridens flavus) and sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula). Due to its semiarid climate, the shortgrass prairie receives on average less precipitation than that of the tall and mixed grass prairies to the east.https://www.nps.gov/tapr/learn/nature/a-complex-prairie- ecosystem.htm  History  The shortgrass prairie has a long human history. The Kiowa, Comanche, and Arapahoe peoples occupied the land, hunting bison and pronghorn. Seasonally, these tribes would stage hunts in the adjacent mountains such as the Rocky Mountains. To manage the prairie these tribes and their predecessors likely used fire. They would create fuel breaks, a gap in vegetation or other combustible material that acts as a barrier to slow or stop the progress of a brushfire or wildfire. A firebreak may occur naturally in areas without vegetation or other fuel, such as a river, lake or canyon around their settlements. These fuel breaks would also entice large herbivores to patches of fresh new growth. European explorers, trappers, and fur traders began to settle the shortgrass prairie. They developed an extractive economy that led to the later growth and industrialization of the prairie. In the mid- and late 19th century the railroads expanded transportation channels, helping to increase settlement, predominantly in rural and small towns. While more people began to settle in the prairie, large-scale cattle and sheep ranching increased as well. This later led to the development of gold, silver, and copper mining communities. = Dust Bowl = In the 1920s, El Ni√±o played a big role in the success of crop growing in the short grass plains. El Ni√±o caused more precipitation throughout the prairie, promoting plant growth. The success encouraged farmers to buy more efficient farming equipment. With the new equipment, farmers turned up the native land, exposing the soil. By the time the 1930s came around, it was too late to protect the soil with grass. The unprotected soil contributed to the Dust Bowl by being blown around and creating dust storms. = Acts =  Food Security Act of 1985  The Food Security Act of 1985 allowed for lower commodity prices and income supports. This Act also laid the foundation for the dairy herd buyout program. The Act made changes to several other USDA programs.  Conservation Reserve Program  Farmers enrolled in the program agree to abolish environmentally destroyed land from agricultural production and cattle grazing to improve and regrow healthy grass and habitats in exchange for a yearly rental payment. = Today = Today much of the shortgrass prairie is grazed by domestic livestock, with a human population that still is dependent upon agriculture. However, energy and mining exploration have increased. Over time, there has been a precipitous decline of many species, but inhabitants of the region today are demonstrating that sound land management practices can help sustain the native species, natural communities, and ecosystems.  Climate  The shortgrass prairie is a long thin stretch of territory that starts at the top of the country and makes its way to the bottom. Due to this, the climate varies from North to South, but is essentially the same from East to West. The temperature in the North is significantly colder on average then the temperature in the South. Also, there is more precipitation to the south, and more precipitation to the East. An interesting distinction about the shortgrass prairie compared to the tall and mixed grass prairies is that it has a one to two month summer drought, where the other two do not. This means that it also the driest prairie of the three. In addition, this region has various amounts of hailstorms, blizzards, tornadoes, and dust storms.  Population  There are two significant population trends currently impacting the shortgrass prairie region. Firstly, the population in the region is decreasing, with many of those people moving westward. Additionally, more people are moving to metropolitan areas, and about three quarters of the population in this region live in those metropolitan areas. The human population today is still mainly dependent on agriculture, but fields such as energy exploration and mining have become more popular in the area. Due to the increase in people this has affected the ecosystem of the region and there has been a decrease of amount of species and diversity of those species.  Economy  = Crop production = Large portions of central grasslands of the United States are used for intensive agriculture. The shortgrass prairie has copious amounts for economic potential as it is estimated that only about 50 percent of the shortgrass prairie is still uncultivated. The shortgrass prairie yields for a lot of crop production, and in this specific prairie wheat is the major crop grown. Other major crops grown are maize, soybeans, and cotton. = Livestock production = The dry grasslands of the shortgrass prairie yield for extensive grazing operations. Typically cow-calf operations with the young animal sold for finishing in feedlots. Stocking rates and the economy in this region highly depend on the amount of precipitation, range conditions, and other environmental factors. = Art = Parts of the shortgrass prairie are untouched and pastoral. Many artists and photographers travel to this prairie for inspiration and economic opportunities. Paintings and photographs are often sold at high prices for their aesthetic beauty. The Dust Bowl brought a lot of artistic and photographers to this area in seek of fame and economic opportunities.  Boundaries  The shortgrass prairie is located on the western side of the Great Plains with the Colorado Rockies to its west and the mixed grass prairie to its east. However, it is pretty much impossible to define exact boundaries of the prairie. This is due to the shifting of plant communities over time and space because of the dynamics of grassland vegetation. So, the prairie extends to the eastern part of the Rocky Mountains to the west, up to Canada to the North, as far as Nebraska to the East, and as far as parts of Texas to the South. Those are just the general boundaries of the shortgrass prairie which is everything inside those said boundaries.  Conservation  In Colorado, which contains a substantial portion of the shortgrass prairie biome, no legal ecosystem protection exists. More than 85% of prairie is privately owned and used for agriculture, particularly for dry land wheat, irrigated corn, soybeans and alfalfa. Roughly half of the original prairie extent is still present, however conservation in the long run is uncertain. Urban expansion is likely to continue having an impact. Climate change has less of an effect here than in other areas of Colorado due to the lower elevation, but can still be expected to affect the biome. = Prairie Dog Coalition = The Prairie Dog Coalition is a non- profit group of scientists, organizations and citizens who are fighting for the protection of prairie dogs and their environments. The alliance educates people on the declining populations of prairie dogs and engages with projects likely to destroy prairie dog habitat. = Southern Plains Land Trust = The Southern Plains Land Trust (SPLT) creates and protects a network of shortgrass prairie preserves to ensure the future of all native animals and plants in the region. As of 2019, over 25,000 acres are included in SPLT's preserve network.  Ecosystem  The shortgrass prairie was once filled with huge herds of free-ranging bison and pronghorn. The prairie also teemed with large prairie dog colonies, deer and elk, and predators such as gray wolves and grizzly bears. The prairie is home to healthy populations of plains blue grama, a vast array of songbirds and raptors, carpets of buffalo grass and a broad diversity and abundance of wildflowers and butterflies. It was a landscape so teeming with life it has been compared to the South American Pampas. Today the most popular animal on the prairie is domestic cattle. The short grass prairie is used to having animals graze the land, so the pressure of grazing animals does not harm it. Pronghorn and prairie dogs still inhibit the prairie however, in fewer numbers. Top predators have been replaced by coyotes. Ecological processes on a large-scale level such as climate, fire and grazing have strong influences in this system. Today, the shortgrass prairie has suffered the greatest biological destruction of any major biome in North America. The three central processes historically shaping the shortgrass prairie are herbivory, drought, and fire. Through habitat destruction, extermination of native herbivores and predators, proliferation of noxious weeds, and altered fire regimes have negatively been impacted. Flora Shortgrass prairie The short grass prairie consists of different varieties of vegetation. Notably abundant grasses are blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), sod- forming grass, and buffalo grass (Bouteloua dactyloides). Less prevalent is galleta grass (Hilaria). These grasses are native to the short grass prairie and therefore are drought and grazing resistant. Not many plant varieties appear in short grass prairies owing to its extreme changes in annual precipitation and temperature from one year to the next. Two of the main plants that are able to thrive are soap weed yucca (Yucca glauca) and plains prickly pear cactus (Opuntia). In the years of greater precipitation, otherwise dormant wildflowers bloom in the spring, quickly diminishing in the hotter and drier summer months.  Fauna  The short grass prairie consists of many kinds of birds, reptiles and mammals. Most of these animals have adapted to living in such an open area, many having adapted to living under ground or traveling long distances to find shelter. =Birds= Grassland birds are part of the fastest decreasing groups of animals in North America. Grassland birds that reside in the short grass prairie add to this decrease by being Colorado's largest category of declining animals. Some of birds that still inhabit the short grass prairie are the Cassin's sparrow, loggerhead shrike, sandhill crane, scaled quail, Swainson's hawk, burrowing owl, mountain plover and thick-billed longspur. Although the loggerhead shrike and scaled quail are among the more common birds to see in the short grass prairie, they are also some of the few who are on the fastest decline. =Reptiles= Round-tailed horned lizard, Texas garter snake, Texas horned lizard, Texas long-nosed snake and Western Massasauga are among the most dominant reptiles in the short grass prairie. Most of these animals are cold blooded, so in the winter months they live under ground until spring comes. =Mammals= Mother and calf grazing on the prairie. Cattle, pronghorn and white-tailed deer are the most abundant mammals on the short grass prairie today. Domestic cattle were placed in the prairie and have essentially replaced the native species that used to live in the short grass prairie such as bison and elk. In addition, the top predators used to be Gray wolf and Grizzly bear, but today, coyotes have replaced those animals. Prairie dogs were once the most abundant animals in the short grass prairie, living in colonies across a range that historically spanned 11 states. Presently, prairie dogs are found in 1 percent of their former range. The decrease has been driven by poisoning campaigns, habitat disruption, and hunting. The decline in prairie dogs has significantly impacted many of the other animals that reside in the short grass prairie, including the black-footed ferret, whose diet relies on prairie dogs. Other animals negatively affected by the decline of prairie dogs are the mountain plover, swift fox, ferruginous hawk and the burrowing owl.

Myriel is the Bishop of Digne in southeastern France. The actual Bishop of Digne during the time period in which Myriel's appearance in the novel is set was Bienvenu de Miollis (1753‚Äì1843). He served as Hugo's model for Myriel.Edward Behr, The Complete Book of Les Miserables (Arcade, 1993), 29 In both the novel as well as the film and musical adaptions of it, the Bishop is a heroic figure who personifies compassion and mercy. As Hugo set to work on the novel in 1848 after a long interruption, his anti-clerical son Charles objected to presenting Myriel as \\"a prototype of perfection and intelligence\\", suggesting instead someone from \\"a liberal, modern profession, like a doctor\\". The novelist replied:  Bishop Myriel in the novel  The novel begins with an account of the life and practices of Myriel. He was born into a noble family: \\"the whole of the first portion of his life had been devoted to the world and to gallantry.\\"Victor, Hugo, Les Mis√©rables, Kindle Edition (English language), 17 His wife died while they were living in Italy as exiles from the French Revolution. The narrator reports his next transformation with a rhetorical question:Victor, Hugo, Les Mis√©rables, Kindle Edition (English language), 17-18 While a little-known priest, he had a chance encounter with Napoleon and praised him, as a result of which he was made a bishop. He continues to act like a common, compassionate, country priest, generally known by the name \\"Monseigneur Bienvenu\\" (\\"welcome\\"). He moved into the small town hospital, so that the episcopal palace could be used as a hospital and keeps only a tenth of his salary for himself, spending the rest on alms. He once accompanied a condemned man to the scaffold, after the village priest refused to do so. Hugo devotes one chapter to a transformative episode for Myriel, in which the Bishop visits an old revolutionary on his deathbed. They discuss the politics and morality of revolution, and Myriel comes to marvel at his \\"spiritual radicalism\\", asking his blessing as he dies.Victor Brombert, \\"Les Mis√©rables: Salvation from Below,\\" in Harold Bloom, ed., Modern Critical Views: Victor Hugo (Chelsea House, 1988), 221-3 The narrator summarizes Myriel's philosophy:Victor, Hugo, Les Mis√©rables, Kindle Edition (English language), 54; Vol. 1, Book 1, Chapter 14 One night Jean Valjean shows up at his door, asking a place to stay the night. Bienvenu graciously accepts him, feeds him, and gives him a bed. Valjean takes most of Bienvenu's silver and runs off in the night. The police capture Valjean and take him back to face Bienvenu. When the police inform Bienvenu they have found the silver in Valjean's knapsack, Bienvenu tells the police that he had given them to Valjean as a gift. He chastises Valjean for not taking the silver candlesticks as well. After the police leave, Bienvenu tells Valjean to use the silver to become an honest man. Myriel is referenced several times later in the novel. In 1821, Valjean, while serving as a mayor under the name Monsieur Madeleine, learns from a local newspaper of Myriel's death at 82.Victor, Hugo, Les Mis√©rables, Kindle Edition (English language), 125; Vol. 1, Book 5, Chapter 4 Not long after, as Valjean contemplates allowing Champmathieu to be convicted in his stead, a \\"terrible voice\\" tells him: \\"Destroy these candlesticks! Annihilate this souvenir! Forget the Bishop! Forget everything! Destroy this Champmathieu, do! ... Yes, it is well arranged thus. Ah, wretch!\\" The voice then warns that one person, presumably Champmathieu, will curse him if he follows that advice. The voice is not identified, but the passage implies that it is the recently deceased Myriel as it concludes with Valjean asking who is there:Hugo, Les Mis√©rables (English language) Kindle Edition, 169-70 Just before Valjean's death, when a female porter asks if he wants a priest, he replies \\"I have one,\\" and points upward. The narrator adds: \\"It is probable that the Bishop was indeed a witness of this death-agony.\\"Victor, Hugo, Les Mis√©rables, Kindle Edition (English language), 954; Vol. 5, Book 9, Chapter 5 The silver candlesticks, Myriel's gift to Valjean, are mentioned several times near the novel's end, and Valjean dies in the glow of their candles.Vol. 5, Book 5, Chapter 5; Vol. 5, Book 9, Chapter 3; Vol. 5, Book 9, Chapter 5 Role and significance Writing in the Contemporary Review in 1885, Margaret Oliphant welcomed Hugo's portrait of Myriel as a refreshing change from his depiction of religious life in The Hunchback of Notre Dame, a \\"surprise of sweetness and relief\\". Calling Myriel \\"the keynote of the wonderful tale\\", she considered all the adventures of Valjean and Javert \\"on a much lower level of art than the opening\\". She continued: Kathryn M. Grossman describes Myriel's work in transforming the lives of the poor as a moral \\"investment\\". His \\"fraternal demeanor thus corresponds to an economy marketing in souls.\\" She continues:Kathryn M. Grossman, Figuring Transcendence in Les Miserables: Hugo's Romantic Sublime, Southern Illinois University Press, 1994, p.128. The Catholic writer Theresa Malcolm says that after Valjean leaves, \\"Monseigneur Myriel never again appears in the story, but he is the soul of the novel, he who sowed love where there was hatred, light where there was darkness.\\"Theresa Malcolm, National Catholic Reporter, May 29, 1998, p. 19  Adaptations  Since the original publication of Les Mis√©rables in 1862, the character of Bishop Myriel has been in a large number of adaptations in numerous types of media based on the novel, such as books, films,Bishop Myriel (Character) at the Internet Movie Database musicals, plays and games. Bret Harte parodied Les Mis√©rables in his Condensed Novels. In this version, Myriel confesses to stealing his own candlesticks. When the police can take no action against him, \\"He had a charming ball and chain made, affixed to his leg, and wore it the rest of his life.\\"Bret Harte, Condensed Novels (Kindle edition), location 1309) = Bishop Myriel in the musical = In the stage musical of the same name, which is loosely based on the novel, the role is called \\"Bishop of Digne\\" and the character is not otherwise identified. All of Myriel's history is omitted, and he is not mentioned or referenced after his encounter with Valjean. He sings twice. In \\"On Parole\\", he welcomes the starving and tired Valjean into his house and offers him food, wine, and a bed. In \\"Valjean Arrested, Valjean Forgiven\\", he explains to Valjean that his act of mercy was for a greater cause, instructs Valjean to use the silver \\"to become an honest man\\", and says that he has bought Valjean's soul for God. Although his role is highly condensed compared to that of the novel, the Bishop retains the same heroic character and has a major significance in the story, moving Valjean to mimic the Bishop's strong values of kindness and mercy. At the end of the 2012 film (and recent stage revivals of the musical), he and Fantine are shown in the embrace of God and welcome Valjean into life after death. As well, the 2012 film has Myriel played by Colm Wilkinson, who originated the stage role of Valjean in 1985.

The theoretical relationship between growth in a chemostat and growth in a turbidostat is somewhat complex, in part because they are similar. A chemostat has a fixed volume and flow rate, and thus a fixed dilution rate. A turbidostat dynamically adjusts the flow rate (and therefore the dilution rate) to make the turbidity constant. At steady state, operation of both the chemostat and turbidostat are identical. It is only when classical chemostat assumptions are violated (for instance, out of equilibrium; or the cells are mutating) that a turbidostat is functionally different. One case may be while cells are growing at their maximum growth rate, in which case it is difficult to set a chemostat to the appropriate constant dilution rate. While most turbidostats use a spectrophotometer/turbidimeter to measure the optical density for control purposes, there exist other methods, such as dielectric permittivity.

Today, it is a central location for rallies, celebrations, and demonstrations, and serves as a general, all-purpose recreation area. The College describes the Green as \\"historic\\" and as the \\"emotional center\\" of the institution.  Geography  A diagram of the Green The Green is a five-acre (two-hectare) plot located in the center of downtown Hanover, New Hampshire. It is crossed by seven gravel walking paths, the locations of which varied until about 1931, when the configuration was last altered. Three of them bisect the Green, running southwest to northeast, northwest to southeast, and east to west. The northernmost of its two east- west paths was added after Massachusetts Hall was constructed in 1907, and links the central entrance to that dormitory west of the Green to the northern entrance to Dartmouth Hall, east of it. Two paths run from the northwest and southwest corners respectively to the middle of the Green's eastern edge. A final path runs north-south along the eastern side. The Green also has paved sidewalks along its southern and western edges. The Green is not perfectly rectangular, as its southern border along Wheelock Street runs slightly to the northeast rather than due east-west. This irregularity is due to the Town of Hanover's 1873 seizure of part of the southeast corner of the Green, which it used to straighten Wheelock Street. The Green had previously extended 30 feet (nine meters) farther south on that corner.Childs 267. The outside edges of the Green are bordered by benches and trees; two flagpoles stand at the center of the western side. The plot is bounded by four streets: Wheelock Street to the south, College Street to the east, Wentworth Street to the north, and Main Street to the west. All but Wheelock Street are one-way roads, with traffic circulating counter-clockwise around the Green. Many of Dartmouth's important campus buildings are located around the Green. To the north lies Baker Memorial Library, Dartmouth's principal library, Webster Hall, containing Rauner Special Collections Library, and Sanborn Hall, home to the English department. On the west side sits the administration building, Parkhurst Hall, the admissions building, McNutt Hall, and two student buildings, Robinson Hall and the Collis Center. To the south sits the Hanover Inn, a College-owned hotel, and the Hopkins Center for the Arts. To the east lies the historic Dartmouth Row buildings, composed Wentworth Hall, Dartmouth Hall, Thornton Hall, and Reed Hall, as well as Rollins Chapel.  History  An 1890 baseball game being played against Amherst College on the Green. The land on which the Green sits was originally a pine forest, with some trees reaching the height of 270 feet (82 m), high enough to block out the sun.Chase 225. The process of clearing the pines was begun in 1770 by the newly founded Dartmouth College. The village plan of Hanover was laid out the following year and included as its central feature an open square of (three hectares). Even though the land had been cleared, many tree stumps remained until 1831; for a long period, it was a Dartmouth tradition for the graduating class to remove one stump. The Green was not maintained at first; after being cleared, it was unkempt and ragged, sloping sharply towards a swamp in the southwest corner. As early as 1807, the College was debating as to the future of the plot, considering using it for a variety of purposes. In 1828, the Board of Trustees finally voted to plow, seed, level, and fence the area. Lack of funding would delay this plan from being carried out immediately;Lord 1928:23. the Green was leveled in 1831 and finally fenced in 1836.Childs 266.Lord 1913:241. The main road from Hanover to the northward Lyme, New Hampshire had previously led diagonally across the Green, and due to the new fences, had to be diverted around it. The Green is prominently featured in the earliest known image of Dartmouth (circa 1793). The engraving may also be the first visual proof of cricket being played in the United States. One of the Green's earliest uses was as a pasture for cattle belonging to the residents of the town. Dartmouth students resented this use, and in the early 19th century herded all the cattle into the basement of Dartmouth Hall as a protest. The fence constructed during the 1836 renovations was in part a response to this action, and was meant to keep animals out. Students playing old division football on the Green, 1874. In 1824, a Hanover ordinance permitted \\"the playing at ball or any game in which ball is used on the public common in front of Dartmouth College,\\" confirming the Green's ongoing use as an athletic field. Cricket was among the games regularly played on the Green in the 18th century, and old division football was played by the 1820s. Dartmouth's first intercollegiate matches in baseball (1866), track and field (1875), football (1881), and tennis (1884) took place there. The College built its first gymnasium (Bissell Gymnasium) on the southeast corner of the Green in 1866-67. In April 1873, the Town of Hanover seized part of the southeast corner of the green to align East and West Wheelock Streets; the town moved the fence thirty feet to the north of its original position. Dartmouth students protested by tearing down and burning the rebuilt fence; the town responded by threatening to reopen Main Street on its previous route from the Green's southwest corner across to the northeast. In an effort to quickly replace the fence and prevent the road from being reopened, College President Asa Dodge Smith convinced students to pay for the new fence.Lord 1913:395-396. In 1893, when the fence's original purpose of keeping out livestock was no longer needed, the College decided to tear it down, to much student and alumni outcry. The class of 1893 restored and sponsored part of the fence as a \\"senior fence,\\" and today the Senior Fence runs along the parts of the southern and western borders closest to the southwest corner. Only senior students were allowed to sit on it, and underclassmen in violation of this policy were soaked in a nearby watering trough. Men carving canes while sitting on the Senior Fence. In 1906, the Board of Trustees voted to officially name the space \\"the College Green\\", although at the time the space also went by names such as \\"the College Square\\", \\"the Common\\", and \\"the Campus\\".Tucker 309. Aside from minor changes in furnishing, vegetation, and crosspaths, the Green has remained largely unchanged since being cleared.  Uses  The 2007‚Äì2008 edition of Dartmouth's Student Handbook states that the Green is reserved \\"for informal use, including rallies and other assemblies, by students, faculty, staff, and guests of the College... and for a limited number of traditional events\\". Since other facilities have superseded its use as such,See List of Dartmouth College buildings#Athletic and outdoor recreation buildings for a current list of Dartmouth sporting facilities. the Green is no longer used for official athletic competitions. Nevertheless, informal sports and games frequently occur on the Green. Like all of the Dartmouth campus, the entirety of the Green is Wi-Fi-enabled. = Rallies and protests = Given the Green's role as \\"the physical and emotional center of campus life,\\" it is often the setting for protests, rallies, and demonstrations. Dartmo, an online directory of Dartmouth College's buildings, describes the Green as being \\"used any time when collective joy or frustration is to be expressed\\". Dartmouth's Student Handbook explicitly permits the Green to be used for demonstrations and rallies. 2008 Presidential election. One of the earliest student demonstrations took place in 1814, when students gathered on the Green to celebrate Napoleon's defeat in Europe. At the height of the Vietnam War in the late 1960s, the Green regularly saw antiwar demonstrations, some attracting up to a thousand protesters. A 1969 protest over the presence of the campus Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) program culminated in the occupation of Parkhurst Hall, the College's administration building. In 1986, students constructed shanties on the Green to encourage the College to divest from South African companies supporting Apartheid; staffers of the conservative newspaper The Dartmouth Review took sledgehammers to the structures. More recently, the Green was the location of a controversial 2006 May Day rally in favor of immigrant rights. The 2004 Winter Carnival snow sculpture on the Green On September 26, 2007, Dartmouth hosted a Democratic Presidential Candidates Debate. The Green was the site of student rallies in favor of various candidates, and also saw the live broadcast of Hardball with Chris Matthews.

At Homecoming each fall, a bonfire is constructed on the Green by the freshman class; students and community members gather to watch the freshmen run around it as it burns. The wintertime celebration of Winter Carnival sees the construction of a snow sculpture on the Green. In the springtime, Green Key Weekend is marked by concerts and performances on the Green, which until 1984 was also the site of fiercely competitive Green Key chariot races. Other traditions involving the Green include the placement of a Christmas tree at the center each December and an annual Native American Pow-Wow. Students gather on the Green on the night of the winter's first snowfall for a school- wide snowball fight. The College's commencement ceremonies are traditionally held on the Green, regardless of weather conditions.

The Mormon trailblazers who established this trail crossed the Colorado River and ended their journey in the town of Bluff. The Hole-in-the-Rock expedition established the trail in 1879. The trail is located within the borders of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, the adjacent Glen Canyon National Recreation Area and federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM) public land to the east of the Colorado River. A geologic feature called the Hole in the Rock gave the trail its name. A modern unpaved road called the Hole-in-the-Rock Road (BLM Road 200) closely follows this historic trail to the point where it enters the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. The modern road is an important access route for visiting the Canyons of the Escalante and the Devils Garden. The trail is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, being added to that list in 1982. Route description The trail follows a route starting near Escalante, Utah, and ending in Bluff, Utah, and is named for the place where the San Juan Mission of Mormon pioneers constructed a descent to the Colorado River. The natural crevice on the cliff above the Colorado was enlarged by the party to lower the wagons down to river level, where it could be forded. The portion of the trail below the Hole-In-The-Rock is now flooded by Lake Powell. After the river crossing the trail continued past the Register Rocks, where the settlers recorded their names, now covered by the lake. The road rises through the Chute and across slickrock sandstone to Grey Mesa. Another difficult descent was required from Grey Mesa, requiring the party to cut a road from one ledge to another on the face of the mesa, taking a week. Another week was spent in constructing a road down Clay Hill Pass. Further on, blocked by Comb Ridge, the trail follows Comb Wash to San Juan Hill, where yet another road was built up the hill. The trail ends in Bluff.

Background Lindig was born in P√∂√üneck, Germany. Initially trained as an artist and modeler, he also studied sculpture with architect and designer Henry van de Velde in 1913-15 at the Weimar Kunstgewerbeschule (Arts and Crafts School), in the building that would soon become the first location of the Bauhaus. Shortly after the Bauhaus opened in 1919, Lindig enrolled in the program and, beginning in 1920, studied ceramics with sculptor Gerhard Marcks, his Formmeister (form master) and Master Potter Max Krehan, his Lehrmeister (craft master) at the school‚Äôs pottery annex in Dornburg on the Saale River, about fifteen miles from Weimar. At the time, he was one of four Bauhaus student potters who successfully completed their journeyman examinations (along with Theodor Bogler, Werner Burri and Marguerite Wildenhain). In 1923, coincident with its first public exhibition of student work, there was a rift at the Bauhaus, in which some faculty and students were in sympathy with a shift in the school‚Äôs philosophy toward ‚ÄúArt and Technology: A New Unity,‚Äù while others opposed it (Marcks and Krehan in particular). In contrast, Lindig and Bogler, who sometimes collaborated, were willing and eager to learn about machine production. In 1924, they were put in charge of an experimental production workshop (housed in a remodeled stable down the hill from the Krehan Pottery) in which they developed slip-cast molds that could be used to mass-produce ceramic containers. Marcks was put in charge of both the \\"upper\\" and \\"lower\\" workshops. Later life In 1925, the Bauhaus moved to Dessau, at which time its pottery workshop was discontinued. Remaining in Dornburg, Lindig continued as manager of the workshop, referred to as the Ceramics Department of the State Building School of Weimar, until 1930. That year, he leased the building for his own purposes, and continued to manage the workshop until 1947, at which time he joined the faculty at the Landeskunstschule (Regional Art School) in Hamburg, where his former master Gerhard Marcks had been teaching sculpture since the end of World War II.

There was a holy well near the churchyard and Sir John Lloyd's History of Carmarthenshire refers to an ancient stone, Yr hen lech, to which was attributed healing powers. Sick persons were required to bathe in Ffynnon Celer, the holy well, before sleeping on the stone. There were nine holy wells in the parish of Llangeler. Their existence was recorded by Francis Jones in his book Holy Wells of Wales. Such wells were often roofed and had small chapels with niches for statues of saints, and pilgrims came in large numbers to visit them. The exact whereabouts of many of the wells in the parish have now been lost.Nine Wells of Llangeler References Category:Communities in Carmarthenshire Category:Villages in Carmarthenshire ","title":"Llangeler"},{"id":"13714035","text":"Dyfed-Powys Police Headquarters Llangunnor is a village and community located in Carmarthenshire, Wales.

Saint Ceinwr's church The parish church of Saint Ceinwr is the resting place of David Charles the famous Welsh hymn-writer. The oldest part of the present church building dates possibly from the 14th century, But the site has probably been a holy place since the earliest years of Celtic Christianity. The church is a Grade II listed building. The vicars of St Ceinwr's can be traced back to at least 1661 and are recorded on the Incumbent board inside the church. A stone tablet inside the church commemorates the well-known essayist and politician Sir Richard Steele. The organ was a gift from the Francis family, installed in 1951, and originally stood in the mansion at Deri Ormond, Betws Bledrws, Ceredigion.

Development In recent years major developments in the area have particularly affected Pensarn, a former residential area which saw many houses demolished in the early 1980s, to make way for the Southern bypass. The Belle Vue Hotel and the Square and Compass public house were also demolished. The area was affected with the building of the Eastern bypass. The area has attracted major national retailers which have helped to establish Pensarn as a major out of town shopping district for the local populace in Carmarthen and the surrounding area. In September 2014 Domino's Pizza and Dunelm Mill opened stores in the area. References Further reading *Jones, Major Francis. (1986), Llangunnor, A Contribution. *Treharne, Cyril L.

It includes a cluster of 19th century stone-built houses around the church, and it is surrounded by farmsteads and modern residential development. History =Early settlement= On Allt Cunedda, a hill about a mile north of the village, are Bronze Age burial mounds found during an excavation in the 1850s. Findings included a skeleton and remains of an Iron Age fort. Other evidence of human settlement is inscriptions made into stone walls. The village of Llansaint developed around a cemetery in the 5th and 6th centuries. The holy well of Ffynnonsaint, close to the current location of the Tabor chapel and Jinni Will well in the Cwm valley, indicates an early Christian settlement. The church was built in the 12th century, and a tower was added in the 14th century. Two early Christian monuments of Ogham stones are embedded in the south eastern external wall and commemorate two 6th century Irish priests named Cimestle Avicat and Vennestl. =Llansaint= Up until the 17th century Llansaint was known as Halkenchurche meaning church of the saints. In the 18th century Pengay Farm was the seat of Bevan family, prominent supporters of Methodism who introduced improved agricultural methods. Although the present house and farm buildings are 18th century, the arched gateway contains a 1760 bell from a wrecked Dutch ship. In 1896 the \\"Silver band\\", who won national competitions, was well respected in the community. The band continued until the early 1990s, and yet the musical tradition continues with many former band members and youngsters providing musical entertainment for the community. During World War II, Llansaint was one of the villages that took in evacuated children from London and other areas. File:Joiners Arms 02.jpgAll Saints Church Tower File:Joiners Arms 03.jpgSupported by the Heritage Lottery Fund Government Village Crest Llansaint is governed on a local level by Carmarthenshire County Council and on a community level by St. Ishmael's Community. Economy =Cockle harvesting= Cockles were harvested for centuries by women to supplement their families' income. Once the cockles were gathered and bagged, they were transported on donkeys to the Ferryside railway station, a 2-hour round trip. The arduous work was in addition to the care they gave their families and home. Their husbands worked in the mines, at the brickworks or on the land. Women's harvesting of cockles ended in 1973. In 1900 the author H. C. Tierney wrote: \\"Llansaint... a place inhabited for generations by a somewhat primitive and exceedingly hardy race of people who live by gathering shellfish, especially cockles. The trade is almost entirely in the hands of the women, often assisted by children. The business seems to pay them remarkably well... there is some truth in the old saying, so well known in St. Ishmael's parish, that 'he who marries a Llansaint woman marries a fortune'.\\" =Current industries= Today the primary industries are cattle and sheep farming, fishing, and tourism. File:Llansaint Donkeys.jpgLlansaint Donkeys File:Cattle Farming.pngCattle Farming Demographics Welsh and English are spoken in Llansaint. =Religion= The area religious institutions are Christian. Within the foreignry of St Ishmael to the west, a nucleation around Llansaint Church - which occupies a distinct, central location within the village - lies at the focus of a number of roads within a discrete area of former field strips. The Medieval All Saints Church, Llansaint, with a landmark tower, is Grade B listed. Community services and amenities Buses run through the village regularly. Children are transported by school bus the Ysgol Y Fro school for their education. To support the villages literary needs, there is a mobile library service that comes to the village every month. Nearby St Ishmael's community magazine is STISH. The village has a camera club and a garden club. A Women's Institutes (WI] group meets regularly. There is one pub in the village - The King's Arms.

Licensed to Kansas City, Kansas, United States. The station is currently owned by Mahan Janbakhsh's TBLC Holdings, LLC, through licensee TBLC Kansas City Stations, LLC, and operated by Reyes Media Group under a LMA. History =Establishment as WLBF= Entrepreneur and businessman Everett L. Dillard is the individual credited with putting the station on the air as WLBF. Dillard began broadcasting from his personal residence, with the original studio and transmitter being built at 32nd and Main streets in Kansas City, Missouri. The station moved across the river in 1928, when it began to occupy the 11th floor of the Elks Lodge Building (905 North 7th Street) in downtown Kansas City, Kansas. The building was last known as the Huron Building and was demolished in 1999. Like many early stations, WLBF moved around the dial in its early years; it started on 1420 kHz and relocated to 1430, where it broadcast with just 50 watts. In September 1928, it was allowed to move to 1200 kHz with 100 watts, only for a massive national radio reallocation (General Order 40) to send the station back to 1420 on November 11. Dillard went bankrupt in the Great Depression, and in 1930, the station was placed into receivership. That June, the station was sold to Alexander Maitland and Herbert Hollister, doing business as the WLBF Broadcasting Company. =KCKN= Sale to Arthur Capper On November 13, 1935, the station was sold to Kansas U.S. Senator Arthur A. Capper who also owned the Kansas City Kansan daily newspaper. Capper's other related properties were the Topeka Daily Capital, the Topeka State Journal and WIBW, all in Topeka. Capper purchased the radio station to promote the Kansan and to give him a piece of the growing Greater Kansas City advertising market. When Capper acquired the property, it operated at 1420 kHz.Clipping file, \\"Kansas Room\\", Kansas City, Kansas (66101) Public Library The Capper organization moved the station one block west into the offices of the Kansan at 901 North 8th Street. A new, self-supporting 186-foot box-tower was erected atop the three-story building. While the call letters were officially changed on October 20, 1936, it was not until Thanksgiving Day, November 26, that the station formally made the change to KCKN, which was derived from the letters in the name of the newspaper and the initials of its city of license, and another change, a relocation to 1310 kHz that was approved earlier in the year and reduced interference. In 1939, KCKN was authorized to increase its power to 250 watts. It was on the air daily between 7 a.m. and 9 p.m. The newspaper reported the station could be heard up to 300 miles away from Kansas City, Kansas, with the new broadcast equipment and a higher tower. In 1941, under the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement, KCKN was moved to 1340 kHz, the frequency on which the station still remains. KCKN became national news in the November 24, 1941, edition of Time magazine, after it broadcast a weeklong serial reading of journalist Clarence Streit's famous book, Union Now. Time referred to author Streit as a \\"level-headed zealot\\" for advocacy of the immediate federal union of the United States, England and other democratic states as a means of winning World War II. The consensus was that KCKN had broadcast the piece on orders from station owner and known isolationist Capper. In 1944, KCKN became a basic Mutual Broadcasting System affiliate; it had also reestablished a physical presence in Kansas City, Missouri, with additional offices in the Waltower Building. KCKN after World War II Changing American tastes and lifestyles along with new technology changed radio in the wake of World War II. Principal among the threats to radio was the emergence of television. As radio moved from local programming and network shows to playing recorded music, some things stayed the same. Among the carryovers on KCKN after the war included sports announcer Larry Ray, who continued to provide play-by-play of the Kansas City Blues minor league baseball team; he later moved to WHB and KCMO, called Kansas City Athletics games on the radio, and became an insurance executive. KCKN also sought to enter the world of television. In 1948, it filed to build a station on channel 2. After the four-year freeze and reallocation, KCKN applied again, this time for channel 5, in an application mutually exclusive with that of the KCMO Broadcasting Company. On June 3, 1953, the FCC dismissed the KCKN application, clearing the way for KCMO-TV to launch. In the early 1950s, KCKN emerged as a dominant station in the Kansas City radio market. Wayne Stitt was the popular host in the mornings, Joe Farrell shared middays with Frank Hassett, and in the evening it was Eddie Clarke from 9 to 11pm. Joe Story was station manager, while George Stump was the program director. Print (newspapers and magazines still dominated) ahead of radio and television was in its infancy. \\"Prom Magazine\\" was a weekly publication targeted at the high school and college audience. The station advertised in every edition and coordinated contests on the air and with retail merchants through the magazine.Kansas Resources, Library of American Broadcasting, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742 In 1954, however, Kansas City radio was in for a major shake-up. An innovative and well-financed entrepreneur, Todd Storz, came from Omaha and purchased WHB across the river in Kansas City, Missouri. He pioneered a new concept of pop radio, which would come to be known as Top 40. Storz would survey record sales at retail outlets to determine the top 40 songs being purchased each week and then release WHB's \\"Top 40 Survey\\" every Friday afternoon. The survey songs then comprised the station's playlist. Storz knew that to make the new concept successful, he needed to hire the market's highest-rated DJ talent, who would bring their listeners along with them to WHB. Storz raided KCKN, starting by hiring away Stitt and Clarke. The Storz programming at WHB was a huge success, and it led him to develop a chain of stations, all using the same Top 40 format. The loss of talent at KCKN led to a rapid decline in every aspect of the radio station. Longtime announcer Buddy Black went to WGN in Chicago, while Stump went across the river to KCMO in Kansas City. Soward left for Topeka's WIBW in Topeka, and Bicknell remained in the Kansas City area at KMBC. KCKN was to spend the next few years drifting with little creative focus and a much smaller listening audience. Cy Blumenthal and \\"countrypolitan\\" radio Arthur Capper died in December 1951, and in 1956, his estate sold Capper Publications to Stauffer Publications. Stauffer immediately put KCKN up for sale. It was purchased in 1957 by a well-financed country music operator who had been successful in several smaller markets in Virginia. Cy Blumenthal relished the opportunity to take ownership of KCKN in the same market where Storz had so successfully transformed WHB with the Top 40 format. KCKN would remain a low-powered, 250-watt AM signal at 1340 kHz, but the station was still a valuable asset: it operated 24 hours a day, the signal was non-directional, and the call letters were a brand name in the market. Blumenthal flipped the station to a country format, competing against daytimer KIMO. After a year of success, changes in country music, notably competition from rock and roll, hurt the station, and KCKN tried Top 40. While it did fine, other Blumenthal stations, some of them daytimers, did not fare as well, and Blumenthal decided to flip his entire chain back to country music. At KCKN, this entailed luring away Ted Cramer, then the program director of KIMO; Blumenthal appointed Glen M. George as general manager, a post he would hold for the next 16 months. In order to help shed perceptions about country radio and move beyond the \\"really barefoot sound\\" at most country stations of the time, Cramer installed a country format with Top 40-esque presentation, called \\"countrypolitan\\" radio. Cramer then took a job in West Virginia, and native Kansas Citian Harry Becker returned from Texas in 1961 to become program director. Becker brought \\"Uncle Don\\" Rhea with him to work the vital morning drive shift. In 1962, Blumenthal received FCC permission to operate full-time at 1,000 watts. Cramer returned from West Virginia to become program director, and Becker took a midday air shift. from the clipping file in \\"Kansas Room\\" of Kansas City, Kansas Public Library (Jack Lester's new reference 2 to Clipping file) As part of the Stauffers' spinning off of KCKN, the station had to be relocated out of The Kansas City Kansan's offices. The station purchased a three-story, wood-frame farm house on the edge of town, at 4121 Minnesota Avenue, and converted it into studios and offices. A new, 150-foot guy-wired tower was constructed at the rear of the property. The large, open acreage, accessible by an asphalt road, was named \\"Radio Park\\". The kinds of changes that Blumenthal had found successful in the smaller markets with the country audience were put into practice at KCKN. On-air voices were more professional and with a higher energy level than the hokey, down-home approach used in earlier years. The broadcast equipment was new and production values were high. The dee-jays were tight, with no dead air or long pauses. These changes got the positive results Blumenthal wanted; despite an increasingly competitive radio market, KCKN's listenership grew steadily. In March 1962, Blumenthal received the construction permit for an FM station at 94.1 MHz, with an effective radiated power of 20,000 watts.FCC History Cards for KCKN-FM (KFKF) The FM antenna was added near the top of the tower built in 1957, and on May 28, 1963, KCKN-FM signed on, carrying a simulcast of its AM sister 50 percent of the day while originating its own country music format for the remainder. It had an effective signal for approximately 50 miles and was non-directional. from the clipping file in \\"Kansas Room\\" of Kansas City, Kansas Public Library (Jack Lester's new reference 6 to Clipping file was \\"a b c d e f g h i j\\") Becoming a country leader One of the methods of attracting listeners and building loyalty for Storz and WHB was applied by program director Cramer. Each week, retailers at geographically even locations across the metropolitan area were surveyed to determine the lists of the best-selling songs. Then Cramer, using an intricate points system, determined the sales level 1 through 50 and the KCKN Fabulous 50 countdown survey was developed. This, along with the major-market sounding dee-jays, quality production values, reliable news, weather and traffic elements, were key reasons KCKN became a dominant station again in a much more competitive marketplace than it had in those early years of radio. Jack Lester's reference 1 to the Ted Cramer presentation at Great Plains Radio History Symposium There were several other innovative and creative methods that were used in the 1960s and 1970s to enable the low-powered, 1,000-watt KCKN to get the most reach possible from its signal. Chief engineer Jim Jett was using several equalizing techniques to make the signal sound brighter, fuller and bigger than it was to the listener. Cramer came up with the concept that reverberation or reverb would give the AM signal a sound of more depth. Jett purchased a $10 reverb section from an old Hammond organ and integrated it into the transmitter's audio processing chain. This made the small signal sound huge for only 1,000 watts. A simple doorbell chime was installed and every time an on-air time check was given, the chime was rung. The chime gave AM and FM the most identifiable sounder in Kansas City radio, and it took positive advantage of the other enhancements made to the AM side. In July 1965, Cy Blumenthal sold the radio stations to entertainer Danny Kaye and his business manager Lester Smith. He sold them the AM station, but gave them the FM station at no cost as a bonus. While many FM stations were going on the air, it would be another decade before the significant listener migration from AM to FM would begin in earnest. The new enterprise was known as Seattle, Portland and Spokane Radio‚Äîthe names of the cities where Kaye and Smith owned other radio stations. With the Kansas City acquisition, the operation was renamed Kaye-Smith Radio, Inc., and was headquartered in Bellevue, Washington. Because of the success George and Cramer were having with the country music format, Kaye and Smith remained hands-off owners, and KCKN-AM-FM continued with the same on-air product. The station remained successful, and Kaye-Smith invested heavily in studios, offices, and equipment, reflecting its status as a market and industry leader. In 1971, a new custom-designed building, built at a cost of $500,000, was constructed to the east of the old farmhouse, which was demolished. Kansas City, Kansas built a previously non-existent street, 41st Terrace, one-third of a mile from US 24-40 (State Avenue) to the station's parking lot, and adjacent property was sold to a company which built a big box store. Interstate 635 was built along the west side of the property, making the station facility easily accessible from the entire region. A new guy-wired tower was built in the summer of 1971 to replace the tower constructed in 1957. The additional height was necessary to allow KCKN-FM to increase its power to 100,000 watts. The AM station also moved to the new tower, retaining its existing power level. KCKN's success in country music attracted national attention. When Time published a full-page article in 1972 on the growth of country music, it featured general manager George and program director Kramer. Cramer was also tapped by Kaye-Smith to revamp Cincinnati's WUBE-AM-FM along the lines of KCKN. One of the first promotional tools used on the street was a striking green Nash Metropolitan car, sporting the station call letters painted across each side and the rear in garish yellow and used as a mobile unit. It was equipped with a two-way radio to go on the air from the street and a speaker so people could hear what was on the air at promotional events. Later promotions built on this theme under PD Mike Shanin. The \\"Fun Spot\\" van (which cruised KC streets looking for bright yellow decals on vehicles) was driven by an attractive personality, K C Denim, who gave away prizes to listeners with the Fun Spot. \\"Happy Harry\\" Becker held down the 9 a.m. to noon slot for more than 15 years. Harry attracted a following by interspersing \\"Becker's-Bargain-Basement\\" in five-minute segments during each hour of the three-hour show. Listeners could call in with one item to sell or buy, give a phone number and get right off. Becker was quick and the calls were tight, with no dead air. Following Becker's hemorrhoid surgery, he had to sit on an inflated plastic ring for several weeks, and a contest was created so that a listener would win a prize by guessing the day Harry no longer had to sit on the rubber ring. Becker's show ended each day at 11:58 with Kansas City, Kansas Deputy Fire Chief George Casey who would list the department's runs and the outcomes with his monotone voice: \\"Fire calls the past 24 hours in Kansas City, Kansas...\\". George and Cramer established a growth pattern for the station with revenue being generated by the added FM signal, the audience gains generated by Rhea and Becker, and the goal that KCKN-AM-FM be \\"full- service\\" stations. In the news department, the much larger AP replaced the UPI radio news wire. The ABC Information Network audio service and a direct-line National Weather Service wire were added. Morning and afternoon drive time traffic reports were added with Kansas City, Missouri, police officer Steve Untriff. The local news staff was built up to four full-time people, who eventually produced 24-hour-a-day sponsored newscasts. Newscasts were seven minutes at the top of each hour with half-hour headlines during morning and afternoon drive time. The Associated Press cited KCKN News for nationally breaking the news of former President Harry S. Truman's fatal illness in December 1972. The AP recognized the station's news department again in 1974 for \\"Best Weekend News Coverage - State of Kansas\\". KCKN became a widely respected radio station in every competitive aspect of the broadcast industry. Other on-air DJs and newscasters included: Dave Estes (employed 1967‚Äì77), Doug Dillon (1966‚Äì1975), Bill Abbott (1967‚Äì72), Gary Brazeal (1968‚Äì73), Jim Beedle (1969‚Äì74), JB Carmicle (1972‚Äì77), \\"Moon\\" Mullins (1961‚Äì66, Country Music Hall of Fame inductee, 2009); Dave Morton (News 1965-83), Bill Freeman (ND 1966-1970), Jack Emmerson (ND 1970-72), Mike Shanin (ND 1972-1980), Joe Vaughan (1972‚Äì77), Jim Bowlin (1969‚Äì73), Pam Voreis, Neil Stempleman, Jim Clark, Tim Wallace, \\"Uncle\\" Don Rhea, Noel Scott (1977‚Äì1981), Rick Douglass, Dan Roberts, John Leslie, Don Perry, John Duncan, Roger Carson, \\"Cactus Jack\\" Call, Don Burley, Charlie Knight, Don Register, Wes Cunningham, Chris Collier, Bill Honeycutt, Jesse Sherwood, Jay Sanders, Bob Compton, Dan Crary, Jack Rudnay (Sports) and Lupe Quintana (one-hour weekly Spanish language program for more than 20 years). Long-term DJ Jack Wesley \\"Cactus Jack\\" Call moved to KCMK a week before his death in a car crash on January 23, 1963 near U.S. Highway 40 and Sterling in Independence, Missouri. Six weeks later, on March 3, Patsy Cline along with numerous other stars sang at a Memorial Hall benefit for the family he left behind. After leaving from Fairfax Airport two days later, Cline, along with Hawkshaw Hawkins, Cowboy Copas and concert promoter/manager Randy Hughes were all killed in the 1963 Camden, TN Piper Comanche plane crash en route to Nashville. In 2010, Cy Blumenthal was posthumously inducted into the Country Radio Hall of Fame, recognized as the first man to own a chain of large-market country music stations. Several of Blumenthal's former staffers, including Don Owens, Ted Cramer, Don Rhea, Joe Hoppel, Moon Mullins and Dale Carter (who would later work at KFKF), are enshrined in the Country Music DJ Hall of Fame. =Post-KCKN era= In 1980, Kaye-Smith began to sell its stations, and in late October, it sold KCKN-AM-FM to Allbritton Communications for $4 million. At the time, Allbritton owned three television stations and several newspapers but no radio stations. In February 1982, Allbritton broke off the simulcast and changed both stations' call letters. On FM, KFKF-FM would continue to be Kansas City's country music station of record. 1340 AM became \\"KR 1340\\" KRKR with an album rock format. Late in 1983, Allbritton exited radio and sold KRKR and KFKF-FM to Sconnix Broadcasting, a group headed by Scott R. McQueen. Under the new ownership, 1340 became a partial simulcast of KFKF-FM with a country music format, taking on the KFKF calls for itself. In 1985, with the KCKN callsign having been claimed by a station in Roswell, New Mexico, 1340 became KCKM until 1987, when it became KFKF again. =Synchronous operation as KNHN= The relationship between AM and FM was severed once and for all in 1991 when KFKF was sold to KCBR-AM Limited Partnership, owned by Bill Johnson, and became KNHN, a news/talk station known as \\"CNN 1340\\". KNHN executed an ambitious and experimental plan to expand its coverage; in 1993, it bought another station on 1340, KSEK in Pittsburg, Kansas, and began synchronous operation with the station (which took on new KPHN call letters). In between the two facilities, KNHN received a construction permit to build a synchronous 200-watt booster at Amoret, Missouri. KNHN offered listeners news/talk programming, CNN Headline News audio overnights, and Kansas State University sports coverage. In 1997, KCBR-AM Limited Partnership acquired 1190 AM KFEZ (now KDMR), a 5,000-watt station running an adult standards format. Ownership decided to relocate the news/talk format to the stronger 1190 signal, and on March 3, 1997, the talk programs moved to 1190 as KPHN and 1340 became KFEZ with the adult standards programming. Additionally, the Pittsburg 1340 station, which sported the KNHN calls after the swap, was spun off and returned to local operation as KSEK that August, unwinding the synchronous operation experiment (though KDTD continues to possess the authorization for the Amoret booster, it was dismantled). =The return to KCKN= In 2000, KCBR leased KFEZ to James Crystal Holdings, a religious broadcaster, with an option to buy. While Crystal's time programming 1340 AM with a contemporary Christian format would be short, running just 18 months, Crystal would take an unusual step. It bought KCKN in Roswell, New Mexico, for $2.5 million and changed its calls so that the Kansas City station could reclaim the call sign. While Crystal had an option to buy the Kansas City station, they never exercised it. Instead, Miles Carter and the Carter Broadcast Group acquired KCKN in 2001, and new programming followed on November 15 when the station became sports-formatted \\"Fox Sports 1340\\". The station was sold to All Comedy Radio in 2004 and began running that network's programming. =KDTD and Spanish-language programming= Davidson Media Group, owner of 1480 KCZZ, acquired KCKN in 2005 and changed its call letters to KDTD on December 12. KCZZ had been running a hybrid sports/Regional Mexican format, and the Regional Mexican programming moved to 1340. (The KCKN calls returned to Roswell in 2006.) KDTD would be leased to Reyes Media Group, publisher of the Dos Mundos local Spanish- language newspaper, which operates KCZZ, KDTD and separately owned 1250 KYYS. As KDTD, the station has occasionally had sports coverage, though sports events have since migrated to the other Reyes stations. KDTD was the former Spanish-language flagship of Sporting Kansas City, now heard on KCZZ, and until 2017, it was also the Spanish-language home of the Kansas City Chiefs (whose games moved to FM translator-bearing KCTO). In July 2015, the Kansas City Royals broadcast their first-ever game in Spanish on KDTD; they are now heard on KYYS. In 2015, Davidson sold KDTD and KCZZ to TBLC Holdings, owned by Mahan M. Janbakhsh, in a transaction also involving stations in Virginia and North and South Carolina. The deal was consummated on November 9, 2015.

Licensed to Lewistown, Montana, United States. The station is currently owned by Kxlo Broadcast. Radio host Rick Rydell started his radio career at KXLO. History KXLO-AM was the creation of brothers George and Russell Bennitt, owners of the Lewistown Democrat News Newspaper and the Argus Farmer Newspaper. The Bennitts sold their newspaper interests to Ken Byerly in 1947, but retained their radio construction permit. They are credited with bringing radio to Central Montana under the banner of the Capitol Broadcast Company. KXLO started broadcasting on a frequency of 1230 kHz, with a power of 250 watts, using a Western Electric Transmitter. Designated a ‚Äúlocal‚Äù channel by the Federal Communications Commission, the power was increased to 1000 watts, with FCC permission, in approximately 1961. FCC rules required it be reduced at night to 250 watts. A few years later, most local stations were allowed to broadcast at 1000 watts full-time. The ownership of the station has changed several times over the years. In 1950, the Bennitts sold the station to William G. Kelly under the name the Montana Broadcasting Company. Three years later, Marlin G. Obie of North Dakota joined Kelly, and they incorporated as Central Montana Broadcasting Incorporated. The station‚Äôs license and corporation was sold in 1958 to Asger Mikkelsen. Obie, along with Leroy Tappe and David L. Sather purchased the station, changing its corporate name to KXLO Broadcast, Incorporated. Obie and Tappe sold their interests in 1960 to Sather, William Yaeger and Lewis G. Boucher. Seven years later, Sather and Boucher bought out Yaeger‚Äôs interest. Fred Lark, Beulah G. Lark, and Luann T. Lark, all of Boone, Iowa, purchased controlling interest in KXLO Broadcast, Incorporated in 1973. Beulah Lark‚Äôs interest reverted to the corporation following her death a year later. Boucher sold his interest to Fred Lark and Luann Lark in 1982. In February 2007, Bethany Lark and Melody Lark were brought into ownership by Luann Fortenbery (n√©e Lark). Fred, Luann, Bethany and Melody continue their ownership and operation through 2009. KXLO has broadcast country music since its start date in 1947. Until the early 1970s it also broadcasts a weekly classical ‚Äúconcert hall‚Äù program. In the 1970s the concert hall was changed to a \\"Beautiful Music\\" format Sunday mornings. For many years, KXLO broadcast many agriculture-related programs. In 1973, Denver based farm broadcaster and Inter-Mountain Network (IMN) affiliate, Evan Slack, provided early morning ‚Äúfarm and ranch‚Äù coverage. Later in 1973, the Northern Ag Network (NAG), headquartered out of Billings, established a reel-to-reel taped network, and eventually a land line network. In the 1980s, Taylor Brown became owner/manager and the network changed its land-line format to satellite. KXLO has subscribed to several other network and wire services, including: Mutual, ABC, ABC - Information, Inter-Mountain Network, United Press International News Service, and the Associated Press. KXLO utilizes specialty programs from ABC, CBS, Westwood One, and ESPN. In October 2005, KXLO began to broadcast 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

Their discovery in 1840 raised great scientific interest. To protect the monuments, the site was acquired by the department of Deux-S√®vres in 1873. Excavations resumed in the late 1960s. The oldest structures of this prehistoric monument date to 4800 BC. The archaeological site The site is located on a limestone plateau within a loop of the river Bougon. The area used to be known as \\"Les Chirons\\". =Tumulus A= Tumulus A Tumulus A, entrance Tumulus A, rear The stepped mound, erected in the early 4th millennium BC, has a diameter of 42 m and a maximum height of 5 m. Its large rectangular chamber (7.8 x 5 m, 2.25 m high) lies south of its centre. It is connected by a non-centrally placed passage. There is evidence that the passage was still used by the 3rd millennium BC. The chamber's walls contain artificially shaped orthostats, the gaps were filled with dry stone walling. The chamber is covered by a capstone which weighs 90 tons. It is supported by two monolithic pillars, which also serve to subdivide the chamber. During its excavation in 1840, about 200 skeletons were discovered in three layers, separated by stone slabs. The vague reports of that early excavation prevent any detailed chronological analysis. Accompanying finds included flat-bottomed and round-bottomed pottery, beads, pierced teeth, chains of seashells and stone tools, including a diorite mace. More recent excavations showed that the grave was abandoned shortly after its construction. The passage had been blocked with a large stone slab. At its base lay the skull of a man who had undergone three trepanations during his lifetime. Pottery was also found in front of the monument's facade, suggesting that cult activities, entailing the deposition of pottery, took place after its closure. About 1,000 years later, the monument was re-used for more burials by people of a different culture who reached the passage from above. =Tumulus B= Tumulus B Tumulus B is a long mound, 36 m long and 8 m wide. It has four chambers. Two of them are very small cists, with no access passage. The mound's west part has two larger rectangular chambers, each accessible via a passage from the south. Chamber B1 The chamber B1 is a small square structure, built from monolithic slabs. Such constructions are known as dolmen angoumoisin. A 2.2 m long passage leads to a chamber of 2 by 1.5 m, built simply from four wall slabs. One of them has a hook carved out of its side. A fifth slab covers the chamber. Little archaeological material was found in it, probably because it had been cleared and reused in the 3rd millennium BC. Chamber B2 Excavation here revealed a distinctive treatment of human remains. About ten skullcaps were found placed upside down in two rows. They were associated with several longbones. Cists The cists in the east part of the mound were discovered in 1978. Set in the centre of the mound, they were built of small stones. Both were empty, but they may possibly be associated with a large heap of Late Neolithic pottery sherds found nearby. =Tumulus C= Tumulus C Tumulus C, entrance, partially obscured This circular earthen mound with a diameter of 57 m and a height of 5 m is a complex structure. It reached its final shape through several phases. The mound covers two earlier monuments: *a rectangular platform and *a smaller circular mound. Earlier mound The earlier mound had a diameter of 24 m and a height of 4 m. It contained a small off-centre chamber (2 by 1.45 m), accessible by a passage from the west. Six slabs formed its floor. It contained four skeletons (including an old woman), as well as pottery and flint tools. Platform Attached to the east side of the earlier mound was a large platform, 20 m x 40 m in size (possibly an excarnation platform). In front of each of the three sides of its tall facade wall, a double burial of an adult and a child was found. =Structure D = A 35m long and 2 m tall drystone wall subdivides the Bougon complex in two zones, separating Tumuli E and F from the rest of the site. Several finds, including a piece of wood, proved the Neolithic date of this feature, unparalleled among the megalithic monuments of France. =Tumulus E= Tumulus E Tumulus E This doubly stepped mound, 22m long and 10 m wide, has two chambers accessible by near-central passages from the east. Originally, the chambers were contained in separate circular mounds. Chamber E1 The southern chamber has a diameter of 3m and has a circular, tholos-like structure. Its foundation level is built with 11 blocks, set in a foundation trench. The construction is reminiscent of the chamber of a tumulus in Bazoges-en-Pareds (Vend√©e). Excavation revealed five or six skeletons, accompanied by pottery, bone tools and stone tools, dated to between 4,000 and 3500 BC, making it one of the most ancient dolmen structures in Central France. Chamber E2 E2, in the northern part of E, is near- square, with one apse-like side. It is suggested that it was altered around 2500 BC, long after it was erected. Materials from the chamber included arrowheads, knives and scrapers. Coarse round-bottomed pottery was also present. =Tumulus F= Tumulus F, elongated, with stepped mound at each terminal Tumulus F, other end This trapezoidal long mound, 72 m long and 12 to 16 m wide, is the largest monument of the Bougon complex. Its west end abutted a pit that has been filled in since prehistory. The pit was the source of the material of which the mound (originally 3 m high) was built. The mound contains two chambers (F0 and F2), one at each end. Between them are seven different chamber-less structures (F1). F0 This monument was built in the first half of the 5th millennium BC and reused in the 3rd millennium BC. It is one of the oldest examples of monumental architecture in Atlantic France. Excavation in 1977 revealed a steep hemispherical mound containing a circular structure of 2.5 m in diameter. It lies within a triple concentric drystone facade and is covered with a corbelled vault. The architecture is similar to the complex of Er-Man√© near Carnac in Brittany. The tomb, which dates from about 4700 BC, contained the unarticulated remains of about ten individuals, half of them children. A layer of red clay had been placed atop the natural floor level. There were few artifacts, mainly two pots, six bone chisels and some flint tools. They lay near the bones on two stones of around 30 cm height that protruded from the wall. The latter use was also associated with that structure. F1 The area known as F1 contains no burial chamber. It consists of a series of structures, some of them rectangular, that served to stabilise the monument. The walls separating them reach the ground level the tomb was built upon. The earth of the mound contained the remains of a man, a woman and a child. F2 Neolithic jewellery in Bougon Museum This chamber, dated to the early 4th millennium BC, is at the north end of monument F. It also underwent reuse in the 3rd millennium BC. The chamber, approximately 5 m by 2 m, is covered by a 32-ton slab, made from a type of stone available near Exodoun, 4 km away. The scarce finds from the chamber included pottery fragments, some unusual jewellery (beads) and flint tools. =Synopsis= The 1,000-year development of architecture at Bougon can be subdivided in three phases: #round or oval mounds with corbel-vaulted chambers #elongated mounds with small rectangular megalithic chambers #large rectangular megalithic chambers The Bougon Museum Display illustrating megalith-building technology Bougon Museum The Bougon Museum, opened in 1993, is a modern structure, incorporating an ancient farmhouse. The exhibition is focused on prehistory in general and the Neolithic in particular. It includes the excavated material from the site, but also replicas of a room in the Neolithic settlement of Catalhoyuk (Turkey) and of the passage tomb art from Gavrinis (Brittany). The museum also has an outside area with displays of experimental archaeology, including reconstructions concerned with prehistoric methods for the transport and construction of megalithic monuments.

Words and music were composed by the group's members, Eric Burdon, Vic Briggs, John Weider, Barry Jenkins, and Danny McCulloch. A paean to San Francisco, it was the biggest hit that the new band ‚Äì as opposed to the first- incarnation Animals of the mid-1960s ‚Äì would have. It reached a peak position of number 1 on the Canadian RPM charts, number 9 on the U.S. pop singles chart, and number 7 on the UK pop singles chart. Background The band wrote \\"San Franciscan Nights\\" themselves as a protest song against the Vietnam War. Looking back on the tune in a 2010 interview with Songfacts, Burdon said: \\"The 'Love Generation' helped the anti-war stance in the States. It certainly turned a lot of soldiers' heads around, making them wonder why they had to be out fighting a war when back home their girlfriends were frolicking around and it caused a lot of anguish on that level. Maybe it helped politically with the so-called enemy. I'm not sure.\\" The song opens with a brief parody of the Dragnet theme. This is followed by a spoken word dedication by Burdon \\"to the city and people of San Francisco, who may not know it but they are beautiful and so is their city,\\" with Burdon urging European residents to \\"save up all your bread and fly Trans Love Airways to San Francisco, U.S.A.,\\" to enable them to \\"understand the song,\\" and \\"for the sake of your own peace of mind.\\" The melody then begins with lyrics about a warm 1967 San Franciscan night, with hallucinogenic images of a \\"strobe light's beam\\" creating dreams, walls and minds moving, angels singing, \\"jeans of blue,\\" and \\"Harley Davidsons too,\\" contrasted with a \\"cop's face is filled with hate\\" (on a street called \\"Love\\") and an appeal to the \\"old cop\\" and the \\"young cop\\" to just \\"feel all right.\\" Pulling in as many 1960s themes as possible, the song then concludes with a plea that the American dream include \\"Indians too.\\" The flipside of the UK version of this single was a song called \\"Gratefully Dead\\", another nod from the Animals to the San Francisco scene. Burdon's notion that San Francisco's nights are warm drew some derision from Americans more familiar with the city's climate ‚Äì best exemplified by the apocryphal Mark Twain saying \\"The coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in San Francisco\\" ‚Äì and music writer Lester Bangs thought Burdon's notion \\"inexplicable\\". But in fact, Burdon and his group had recently played in San Francisco during a rare 10-day stretch of exceptionally warm spring weather, which left a strong, if erroneous impression on them. At a concert in Naperville, Illinois in 2010, Burdon said the song was written about an evening with Janis Joplin in San Francisco.

A native of the North Yorkshire town of Harrogate, Charles studied violin at college, but gained local notability with his party- trick performances on the musical saw, occasionally playing with his local brass band. As audience appreciation of his skill on the instrument became ever more apparent, he began making professional appearances at old-time musical hall events, charity concerts and sessions as a soloist and/or with accompaniment from either piano or brass band. As well as taking part in the \\"BBC music live\\" festival he has also played in a skip outside Belfast City Hall for a \\"Catalyst Arts\\" Festival, in a folk festival at Broadstairs and as part of the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival in Buxton. He appeared in the BBC's A Symphony for Yorkshire in 2014 and featured in Britain's Got Talent in 2014, duetting with Banbury's Saw Lady, Caroline Watsham in a duo called \\"Saws Crossed\\". Charles plays his musical saws at events throughout the UK. He is now actively involved in promoting the instrument through workshops and public concerts. He composes music for the instrument, provides backing tracks for other musicians and gives advice to saw makers and other composers. In 2009, he approached a saw manufacturer in Sheffield with the aim of finding a local musical saw maker. It was a surprise that the saw maker Thomas Flinn had recently procured the firm that had manufactured the Roberts & Lee Parkstone Melody Saw. After demonstrating what was possible Thomas Flinn, started producing the saws again and has become an established British musical saw maker. In 2013, he formed the \\"Euro Sawchestra\\" to perform at Sheffield's 100 year celebration of stainless steel. Charles also conducts three Brass Bands in Yorkshire. They include Garforth Jubilee Brass, Summerbridge and Dacre Silver Band and Golcar Brass Band. He has also appeared in the feature film, Asylum, playing tuba with some members of the Lindley Brass Band. The film starred Natasha Richardson, Marton Csokas, Ian McKellen and Hugh Bonneville and it was filmed in High Royds Hospital in Menston, near Leeds.

Licensed to Springfield, Missouri, United States, it serves the Springfield area. The station is currently owned by iHeartMedia, Inc. and licensed to Clear Channel Broadcasting Licenses. History =KWFC= The Baptist Bible College signed on 97.3 as KWFC on April 17, 1969. The new commercial Christian station aired religious and gospel music, as well as programming from local Baptist churches. KWFC held a commercial license, and by 1983, Baptist Bible College officials began to look at selling it and obtaining a new noncommercial license for their radio station. In May, Pat Demaree was announced as the buyer of the 97.3 facility for $925,000; the sale would not include any of KWFC's broadcasting equipment, programming, or call letters, while the new owner would get free rent on the tower for 10 years. Demaree's purchase would be complicated, as he had to avoid overlap with KKUZ, his station in Joplin, and the sale was contingent on Baptist Bible College obtaining a new noncommercial license. On September 15, 1983, the Baptist Bible College filed for 94.1 MHz. Two factors combined to make the KWFC sale process last nearly two years. Baptist Bible College's first application for the noncommercial frequency was returned because of a competing bid from Southwest Missouri State University, which ultimately abandoned its push. Then, Stewart Broadcasting, the owners of KWTO radio filed a petition to deny, claiming that there was overlap between KKUZ and KWFC even though Demaree had moved KKUZ's tower in order to make the purchase of the Springfield station possible. By November 1984, some 18 months after Demaree had agreed to purchase KWFC, Demaree was still waiting for final approval from the Federal Communications Commission. =KXUS= It was not until January 31, 1985, the deadline after Demaree had extended the option on his agreement, that the FCC approved the Baptist Bible College application for 89.1 MHz and its sale of KWFC at 97.3. Studios were quickly fitted out, and on March 23, 1985, 97.3 relaunched as contemporary hit radio outlet KXUS. Baptist Bible College resumed broadcasting on 89.1 FM on April 27. Branding as \\"US 97\\", \\"The Ozarks' New Power Station\\", KXUS was just the second 100,000-watt commercial station in Springfield, behind KWTO-FM. Its first ratings survey gave it a respectable 10.2 rating for third in the market behind KWTO-FM and KTTS-FM. The station's success was exemplified by the response to a 1986 contest giving away $9,700 and a trip to Puerto Vallarta, which generated so many calls it jammed all of the telephone circuits for Springfield for an hour, halting the contest leading to delayed dial tones impaired 911 service. By 1990, KXUS had shifted from CHR to album-oriented rock, leading it to a number-one finish among young adults that year in the Arbitron ratings. Tragedy struck in 1991 when program director Kevin Allen Barton died in a one-vehicle car crash at the age of 45. However, KXUS's ratings success did not translate to the entire Demaree group. When a bank loan in Cincinnati was called in, Demaree filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in February 1992. Matters worsened when ASCAP sued for $100,000 to force KXUS to stop playing songs it represented, saying that the ASCAP license for KXUS had been terminated in April 1991 for nonpayment. In May, Demaree filed to sell several stations, though not KXUS, to Hendren-McChristian Communications, owned by two Arkansas principals. KXUS would not be sold until 1997, when Sunburst Media, owners of KGBX-FM and KGMY-AM-FM, bought it from Demaree and immediately took over programming. Sunburst in turn sold its entire Springfield cluster, along with its stations in Bryan, Texas, and Abilene, Texas, to Clear Channel (forerunner to iHeartMedia) in 2000 in a $57 million transaction.

The city stands about 16 miles between Owere and Umuahia. It was the location of Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu's Ahiara Declaration during the Nigerian Civil War. It is the location of the Catholic diocese in Mbaise. The first recorded Ahiara contact with the Europeans was around 1905 when the British Aro expedition got mixed up in inter-village war which eventually had Dr. Steward a victim, as a consequence the Ahiara people were severely punished by the British forces with an invasion which forced many citizens to flee and never return. The Ahiara Slogan is Decent Dexterity. Origin Ahiara was founded by a man of that name. He was the son of Anunu, popularly called Odo ji Anunu. His sibling Avuvu became a part of Ikeduru. Etymologically, the name Ahiara is a type of plant among the Igbo people. The leaves of this plant signify peace. The great Ezes of Igbo used to travel with Ahiara leaves to guarantee peaceful journeys across several territories. Before Christianity, which 89 percent of the people practice, traditional religion held sway. Ahiara does not practise a centralized system of government. The ten chief priests and chief priestess were the symbol of authority and they occasionally met to deliberate and pass motions which eventually became tradition and laws. They also conferred titles to deserving citizens. Among those was Hon Nze.H.C. O Uhegbu who was conferred with the title of Nze Onugotu of Ahiara as at the time he was the first man in Ahiara to represent the clan in the state legislature.

A Roman senator from LucaniaCassiodorus, Chronicle; Chronica Gallica of 511, 636. Severus was one of the last Western emperors, emptied of any effective power (the real power was in the hands of the magister militum Ricimer), and unable to solve the many problems affecting the empire; the sources describe him as a pious Christian.Laterculus imperatorum.  Biography  = Rise to the throne = On August 7, 461, the magister militum (commander in chief) of the Western Roman army, Ricimer, had Emperor Majorian killed, thus leaving the western throne empty. A struggle for the succession thus ensued, with the Eastern Emperor, Leo I, the King of the Vandals, Gaiseric, and Ricimer himself involved. The Eastern Emperor traditionally had the right to accept his \\"colleague,\\" for the empire was nominally still united. Ricimer needed a weak emperor on the throne, in order to control him: his barbaric descent barred him from taking the throne for himself. Gaiseric had captured the wife and the two daughters of the Western Roman Emperor Valentinian III ‚Äì Licinia Eudoxia, Placidia and Eudocia ‚Äì during the sack of Rome (455), and, through the marriage of one of them, Eudocia, with his son Huneric, he had entered the imperial family. Gaiseric's candidate to the Western throne was Olybrius, who had married Placidia and was thus a member of his family. In order to push for Olybrius' election, Gaiseric decided to put pressure on the empire with several raids on the coasts of Italy and Sicily, maintaining that the peace treaty he had signed with Majorian was no longer valid; Ricimer reacted by sending an embassy to Gaiseric and asking him to respect the treaty, while a second embassy was sent by Leo I asking for the end of the raids and the release of the wife and daughters of Valentinian. Despite the pressure of the Vandal raids, Ricimer ignored Olybrius and put the senator Libius Severus on the Western throne; he was probably chosen in order to please the Italian aristocracy. Severus was elected Emperor by the Roman Senate on November 19, 461, in Ravenna.Theophanes, Chronografia, AM 5955; Chronica Gallica of 511, 636. = Reign = Severus had to face several problems during his reign, because of the presence of Ricimer and because his rule was not recognised in several provinces.  Unrest in the provinces  At the beginning of the 460s the Western Roman Empire no longer ruled several imperial provinces even nominally: Britain had been abandoned; Africa had been conquered by the Vandals; and Hispania was occupied by the Suebi and the Visigoths (who were foederati of the empire). However, the area under Libius' control was even smaller, as the governors of several provinces did not recognise him as Emperor: both Aegidius, who controlled Gaul, and Marcellinus, who ruled semi- autonomously over Illyricum, had been supporters of Majorian and thus did not accept Libius' election. Even the Eastern Emperor Leo I the Thracian did not recognise Libius Severus; the historical sources related to the Eastern part of the empire, Marcellinus Comes and Jordanes, consider Libius a usurper of the Western throne.Marcellinus, Chronicle, s.a. 465. Jordanes, Romana, 336. Libius Severus feared that Marcellinus, who commanded a powerful army, could descend upon Italy, and asked for Leo's help; the Eastern Emperor sent Philarcus as envoy to Marcellinus and dissuaded him from the attack. This episode is also important because it marks the passage of Illyricum from the Western to the Eastern sphere of influence. To oppose Aegidius, Severus appointed his own supporter Agrippinus to the office of magister militum per Gallias, thus officially giving him power over Aegidius. During Majorian's reign Agrippinus had been accused by Aegidius of treachery; found guilty and condemned to death, he had been pardoned, probably because of Ricimer, who then supported him in opposition to Aegidius. Agrippinus asked for support from the Visigoths, and with their help moved against Aegidius and his Frankish allies, led by King Childeric I. In exchange for their support, in 462 the Visigoths received the city of Narbonne from Severus, thus getting access to the Mediterranean Sea and separating Aegidius from the rest of the empire. Among Severus' few official acts is the (464) appointment of Arvandus as Praetorian prefect of Gaul who, in 468, was to be prosecuted for treachery and condemned to death for having tried to obtain the throne. Therefore, Severus actually ruled only over Italy, even if in 465, with the death of Aegidius, Gaul returned to his sphere of influence for a short time. It is probably to this temporary control over Gaul that the limited issue of his coins by the mint of Arelate is to be dated.  Under Ricimer's control  Ricimer put Libius Severus on the throne, though he retained actual power. Some coins exist issued in Severus' name yet bearing a monogram sometimes identified with Ricimer; even if these coins were actually issued in the period between the reign of Severus and of his successor, Anthemius, it is nonetheless an honour unheard of for a barbarian, who was even mentioned on the inscriptions just after the emperors (¬´salvis dd. nn. et patricio Ricimere¬ª, ). Ricimer's control was so clear that, in recording the defeat and death of Bergor, the King of the Alans, by his hand (February 6, 464, near Bergamo), the historian Marcellinus Comes calls Ricimer a king: \\"Bergor, King of the Alans, is killed by King Ricimer\\" (Beorgor rex Alanorum a Ricimere rege occiditur, Marcellinus Comes, Chronicle, s.a. 464).  Vandals  The Vandals continued their raids during the reign of Severus. On one hand Gaiseric justified the raids complaining that he had not received part of Valentinian's legacy; on the other hand, he still hoped to put Olybrius on the Western throne. Vandal raids deeply affected the economy of the Italian landowners, typically senators; some representatives of the Italian aristocracy went to the Emperor to plead for a reconciliation with Gaiseric. Severus chose the patrician Tatian and sent him to the king of the Vandals, who, however, rejected the peace proposal.  Relationship with the Eastern Empire  Even if Severus was not officially recognised by Leo I, nonetheless the Eastern and Western Empires did collaborate, as shown by the episode of Leo's intercession with Marcellinus and the embassy led by Philarcus. Another sign of the collaboration between the two courts is the choice of Consuls. According to tradition, each court chose a consul and accepted the one chosen by the other court. Without Eastern recognition, Severus named himself consul for 462 (his first year as Emperor) and chose an influential member of the Roman senatorial aristocracy (Caecina Decius Basilius, Praetorian prefect of Italy from 463 to 465) for the following year. Severus then decided not to indicate a consul for the years 464 and 465 and chose to accept the two designated by the Eastern court. = Death = The details of Severus' death are obscure, but the majority of modern scholars agree that he died of natural causes in 465. In a passage from his Getica, Jordanes claims Severus ruled for only three years;Jordanes, Getica, 236. it is probable, however, that this is a mistake by the 6th-century historian. As regards the day of his death, it is recorded as August 15 by Fasti vindobonenses priores, but a law by Severus dated September 25 has been preserved; either he died after that day or the law was issued after his death in his name. Cassiodorus, in the 6th century, maintains that Severus was treacherously poisoned by Ricimer in his own palace,Cassiodorus, Chronicles, s.a. 465. but three years after Severus' death, the poet Sidonius Apollinaris wrote that he had died a natural death.Sidonius Apollinaris, Carmina, ii.317‚Äì318. According to modern historians, Ricimer had no reason to kill Severus, who was actually a puppet under his control, unless he was an obstacle to Ricimer's reconciliation with Leo.O'Flynn, John Michael, Generalissimos of the Western Roman Empire, University of Alberta, 1983, , pp. 111‚Äì114.

Their role is to ascertain that official acts are consistent with the law. Such courts are considered separate from general courts. The administrative acts are recognized from the hallmark that they become binding without the consent of the other involved parties. The contracts between authorities and private persons fall usually to the jurisdiction of the general court system.

Accordingly, there is a local administrative court of first instance, possibly an appeals court and a Supreme Administrative Court separate from the general Supreme Court. The parallel system is found in countries like Egypt, Greece, Germany, France, Italy, some of the Nordic Countries, Portugal, Taiwan and others. In France, Greece, Portugal and Sweden, the system has three levels like the general system, with local courts, appeals courts and a Supreme Administrative Court. In Finland, Italy, Poland and Taiwan, the system has two levels, where the court of first instance is a regional court. In Germany, the system is more complicated, and courts are more specialized. Conseil d'Etat in Paris is the Supreme Administrative court in France . In Sweden and Finland, legality of decisions of both state agencies and municipal authorities can be appealed to the administrative courts. In accordance with the principle of the legal autonomy of municipalities, administrative courts can (if not stipulated otherwise) only review and rule on the formal legality of the decision, not its content. In the case of state agencies, administrative courts may rule on the actual content of the decision. In the United States, administrative courts are tribunals within administrative agencies, and are distinct from judicial courts. Decisions of administrative courts can be appealed to a judicial court. Notably, in 1952, the Communist East German government abolished the administrative courts as \\"bourgeois\\". This limited the citizens' ability to contest official decisions. In 1989, re-establishment of the system began in DDR, but the German reunification made this initiative obsolete.

The music and lyrics were composed by the group's members, Eric Burdon, John Weider, Vic Briggs, Danny McCulloch, and Barry Jenkins. In 1968, two different video clips of the song were aired. Background Eric Burdon and the Animals performed at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival at the peak of the Summer of Love; they followed Johnny Rivers onstage and were introduced by Chet Helms. In his book, Monterey Pop, Joel Selvin wrote that, at the festival, \\"Burdon did nothing short of reinvent himself in front of the audience.\\" The song \\"Monterey\\" was subsequently written in tribute to the group's experiences at the festival, and proved to be one of the new band's biggest hits. The lyrics describe the atmosphere of the festival and some of the notable musicians who played, including The Byrds, Jefferson Airplane, Ravi Shankar, The Who, Hugh Masekela, The Grateful Dead, and Jimi Hendrix, as \\"young gods\\" with music \\"born of love\\" and \\"religion was being born.\\" The band described a scene at which \\"children danced night and day\\", and \\"even the cops grooved with us.\\" \\"His Majesty Prince Jones\\" referred to Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones, who was an MC at the event. Before the ending of the song, Burdon quoted the Byrds song \\"Renaissance Fair\\": \\"I think that Maybe I'm Dreamin'\\". Burdon mispronounces Shankar's name as \\"Shanknar.\\" The song featured a brass section as well as a string section. The longer version of the song begins with a spoken recitation by Burdon. The ending as the song is extended with the instruments dropping out, with only the sounds of a mystical instrument play before the fade. Almost each of the musicians mentioned are represented by a corresponding instrument: Ravi Shankar by a sitar sounding electric guitar, The Who by electric guitars and drums, Hugh Masekela by a trumpet, The Grateful Dead, by electric guitars, and Jimi Hendrix by a different sounding electric guitar. The sound of a distortion of the guitars is heard when the \\"ten thousand electric guitars\\" are playing. The Strings come in on the line: \\"You wanna find the truth in life,/ Don't pass music by,/ And you know I would not lie\\", sounding like a Hindu chant. Some radio edits omit the instrumental section, which is heard in the middle of the song, as well as shortening the ending, due to its going over the three minute limit. Charts Released as a single in 1967, the song reached number 15 on the U.S. pop singles chart and number 16 on the Canadian RPM charts. It did not appear as a hit in the UK, where the image of the festival was not as strong. It was included in the new band's second album The Twain Shall Meet as well as their 1969 U.S.-only compilation, The Greatest Hits of Eric Burdon and The Animals. Releases The Mexican MGM release gives the song titles in Spanish as \\"Monterrey\\" and \\"No Es Muchos\\". Monterrey is in fact an entirely different city in Mexico. In 1967 and 1968, the song was included on their live shows. Burdon re-recorded the song many times at his live shows, adding more and more sequences every time. In 1993, the Eric Burdon - Brian Auger Band released it on their live album \\"Access All Areas\\". In 1999, it was featured on Eric Burdon & The New Animals' concert film Live at the Coachhouse. In 2000, the same band released another long live version, which runs for nearly eight minutes. When Burdon had a completely new band in 2006 they also performed it.

Hasbro continued the production of Vac-Man in 2018, one year after continuing production of the Stretch Dolls, which included Fetch Armstrong and the Stretch Octopus. A second variant of Vac-Man was created, this time half the size of the original Vac-Man (14 inches). This smaller version could be pumped by pulling up on the head then pushing down to make a built-in pump. Vac-Man was made by Cap Toys (later purchased by Hasbro) starting in 1994.

(BBC DVD release, from edited 1973 VHS video of original 1972 telecast). BBC Worldwide Ltd. B00918-9. Running time 40 minutes although with some omissions. In early October 2007, 35 years after the original broadcast, a full unedited version was broadcast on BBC 7, the digital radio channel dedicated to re-runs of classic shows. Different versions of the show could be heard in different contexts. The television broadcast began with pre-show announcements by the producer, John Browell, and introduction of the participants, followed by warm-up routines by the cast. The broadcast proper begins with Spike Milligan, Peter Sellers and Harry Secombe each trying and failing to lead the other two in saying \\"It's great to be back.\\" This was the start of the show from the radio audience's point of view. Announcer Andrew Timothy then intervenes with \\"They haven't quite got the hang of it yet, but after another smoke they should be switched on.\\" From there the show re-capitulates the cast introductions with typically skewed humour. There is a spoof \\"warm-up\\" where Sellers, using a \\"dramatic voice\\" announces that the best way to warm up an audience is to have the gentlemen squeeze the thigh of the lady sitting next to them. Timothy then announces that, since Her Majesty the Queen is not available,The performance was attended by some of the Royal Family, including Prince Philip and Princess Anne. Prince Charles, an avid fan, famously sent a telegram from the Navy ship on which he was serving. Mr. Secombe has donned a \\"floral cretonne frock\\" and stepped in for her at the last minute. Secombe then attempts to \\"start the show\\" which sounds a lot like starting, or rather failing to start, a car. This play on words was used by Milligan in his other scripts, particularly the contemporaneous \\"Milligna Show\\". The tone of the whole show, in fact, was much more like Milligan's then-current writing than any of the original shows. Although all the stock characters put in an appearance, the humour consists mostly of one-liners. Secombe eventually starts the show with the help of \\"a Constabule (sic) of Olde England played by an aging Peter Sellers\\" who points out that the show has no jokes in the \\"fuel tonk\\". Again, humorous typographical errors were a staple of Milligan's writing at the time. For this interlude, Sellers used his impression of Michael Caine's voice, complete with the catchphrase \\"There's not many people know that!\\" This is a reference to Caine's supposed fondness for telling people obscure facts. Secombe shouts in some old jokes and \\"starts\\" the show. Before the \\"plot\\" begins, there is a musical interlude in which Ray Ellington performs a very upbeat version of The Tennessee Waltz. Ellington was introduced as \\"Mrs Dale's last husband\\". There is also a reference to Eric Sykes, a fellow comedy actor, who co-wrote a number of episodes of The Goon Show with Spike. Present in the audience was Princess Anne (now Princess Royal), whose brother Prince Charles was a well- known Goon fan. A joke telegram was read out apologising for his absence. A joke is made about \\"us directors of Harlech TV\\" by Harry Secombe. Harry was one of several directors of the erstwhile TV company at the time. Actors Richard Burton and his wife Elizabeth Taylor were also directors. Plot Andrew Timothy takes us to the Westminster City Council Rubbish Dump, situated in Hyde Park, where Hercules Grytpype-Thynne and Count Jim Moriarty, more ragged than ever, are starving. The Council has just dumped a huge amount of lagging, because \\"it was in feet and inches, and we have gone metric\\". Secombe, now in character as Neddie Seagoon, arrives \\"driving an unlicensed Goon Show with CD plates on\\".Cars registered to diplomats bear a special plate with the letters \\"CD\\" standing for Corps Diplomatique\\". Such cars are ubiquitous in London, and are notorious for ignoring traffic laws, to the irritation of residents. Gritpype's comment is \\"Yes, it does look a bit seedy, doesn't it.\\" The two villains then attempt their usual swindle of Neddie, in this case convincing him that his legs must be lagged to keep them warm for the coming winter, the payment being his \\"war gratuity\\" of one hundred pounds. However when Seagoon lifts his trouser leg, it is revealed that Bluebottle has been hiding inside, and is threatening to release pictures of Neddie's bloomers unless he is given money he will use to impress his schoolyard paramour, Mollie Quotts. Bereft of all cash, Seagoon decides to head for Blackpool to earn some money doing his old stage act, the \\"shaving routine\\", which was Secombe's own stock-in-trade. Seagoon fades away, Andrew Timothy dismissing him with \\"Mr. Secombe's departure is a timely one. Any departure of his is timely.\\" Timothy then introduces Max Geldray as follows: \\"Just before this show started, Mr. Max Geldray died. His wife described his condition as: satisfactory.\\"In the 1960s and 70s \\"satisfactory\\" was one of the terms used in medical bulletins issued to the press when a public figure had medical treatment. Geldray then plays \\"The Carioca\\" with the orchestra. After the interlude Andrew Timothy announces that \\"Seagoon is hauling his huge bloated Welsh body up the M1 to Blackpool, and all lanes are blocked.\\" The show moves to the home of Henry Crun and Minnie Bannister for a typical exchange between the two old fossils, with no consequence to the plot other than to link to the entrance of Major Bloodnok, pursued by the Red Bladder, played as always by Ray Ellington. After an exchange of empty threats with the Bladder, Bloodnok is told by his aide, Singhiz Thing, that it is time for his \\"perversion\\". There follows an interlude of bizarre and suggestive sound effects overlaid with ecstatic yelps from Bloodnok, although this could be more of a satire on the kind of lascivious roles Peter Sellers played in several of his films up to that point. Bloodnok then sends Seagoon to the cellar to rest, this serving to re-introduce Eccles to the audience. Eccles has been in the cellar since he delivered coal and forgot to let go of the sack. He has been eating coke to survive and letting his nephew, Little Jim, live in his boot. Possibly the highlight of the show, the encounter of Seagoon and Eccles produces what may be the quintessential Eccles quote: :Seagoon: What are you doing down here? :Eccles: Everybody's got to be somewhere! The philosophical appeal of this was not lost on the audience, who responded with slow-building but long-lasting laughter. Neddie eventually falls asleep, setting the stage for Bluebottle to re-emerge from his bloomers and thus begin a conversation with Eccles, usually another high-point in a Goon Show. This section ends with Bluebottle persuading Eccles to help him push Seagoon down a well, which naturally leads to Little Jim's catchphrase \\"He's fallen in the water!\\" During the subsequent audience applause, Milligan shouts \\"Had to get it in, folks! Had to get it in!\\" Bloodnok reappears, pursued by the Red Bladder, but mysteriously transforms into Grytpype-Thynne, who announces to Neddie that \\"we have found Goon Show number 1-6-3,The \\"number\\" of this edition of the Goon Show was, along with Neddie dressing as the Queen, one of the few running gags in the show. Secombe begins by announcing the start of \\"Goon Show number 1-6-1\\". Later Bloodnok answers the telephone and announces that the BBC has switched to \\"number 1-6-2\\". Grytpype announces \\"number 1-6-3\\" and at the end, Bluebottle declares that the show is now \\"number 1-6-4\\" in which he charges people to poke at Neddie's belly through the hole in the floor. Based on the publication \\"More Goon Show Scripts\\" and the chronology therein, the final Goon Show proper was number 264. in which you play the lead all the way through as an underfloor heating detective\\". Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, this line falls victim to one of Sellers' \\"fluffs\\", for which he was notorious, followed by an attack of giggling, another one of his trademarks. After some asides by his castmates, he delivers the line, which plays into a risqu√© reference to former Goon Michael Bentine. Neddie is then nailed under floorboards for his role, and left there for some months. In fact he is under the floor of a dressing-room at the Palace Theatre, Blackpool, and this room is given to Bluebottle to prepare for his appearance with \\"Capt. Goatcabin's Balancing Stallions\\". He hears Neddie's cries for help, then sees his belly through a knot-hole. The show ends with him poking Neddie in the stomach, as a cacophony of pre-recorded lines from previous parts of the show rise up, followed by a recording of an explosion, a common end to a Goon Show plot. Andrew Timothy finishes the show with \\"The next Goon Show will be on July 7th, 1982. And from Goon Show number 167, farewell. P.S.: Forever\\". The orchestra plays the signature tune, as Andrew Timothy announces the credits, then moves into \\"Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead\\", the regular play-out for the show. In the full recording broadcast on BBC 7, the cast are then heard saying their thank-you's to the audience, with Milligan coming close to abusing them, again something for which he was known in the years after The Goon Show. There follow some minutes of silence after this, then a dirty limerick can be heard, recited by Sellers and accompanied by laughter from Secombe and Milligan. Credits * Performers ** Harry Secombe, Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan * Musicians ** The Ray Ellington Quartet, including Judd Proctor (guitar) and Dick Katz (piano). ** Max Geldray, jazz harmonica player. ** The Wally Stott Orchestra, conducted by Peter Knight. * Announcer Andrew Timothy. * Writer Spike Milligan. * Producer John Browell. Cuts and edits * Spike Milligan's contribution to the pre-show warm-up was cut to a minimum in the TV broadcast and on the vinyl release. Only in the BBC 7 broadcast is his parody of \\"I Left My Heart In San Francisco\\" heard. * The script referred to then-Prime Minister Edward Heath, as \\"Grocer\\" Heath, a sobriquet invented by the satirical magazine Private Eye. This was heard during the TV broadcast but the word \\"Grocer\\" was cut for the vinyl release. It was left intact in the BBC 7 broadcast. * Sellers' line ending with \\"underfloor heating detective\\" leads to the following scripted exchange: ::Seagoon: I've always wanted big parts! ::Grytpype: You've always had them Neddie, you and Bentine! :This was cut from the original television and radio broadcast, but left untouched in other versions. * Andrew Timothy's winding up of the show is heard as ending with \\"...farewell, P.S. forever\\" in the BBC 7 broadcast. \\"P.S. forever\\" was cut from all other versions. * The VHS, and subsequent DVD release (which is verbatim the VHS release) lasts 40 minutes. However, the live telecast, and subsequent LP release were longer. The CD release is faithful to the LP release, with a total running time of about 52 minutes. In editing the VHS release down to 40 minutes, the lead-up to a delayed punch-line is lost. The punch line comprises Bluebottle asking Moriarty: \\"...what is that lump on your nut?\\", to which Moriarty replies: \\"That is the difference between margarine\\". The primer for this punch-line was edited out between announcer Andrew Timothy's follow-on at the end of Ray Ellington's song, and the part where Neddy drives up on an unlicensed Goon Show. Amongst the banter, Grytpype- Thynne tells Moriarty to place his head on an anvil, followed by a clang, and screams of pain from Moriarty. Grytpype then says: \\"now, taste this margarine\\". Moriarty complies. Grytpype says: \\"There. Can you tell the difference?\\". Moriarty: \\"No\\". Grytpype (triumphantly): \\"You see! You can't tell the difference between a lump on the head and margarine. The leadership of the Conservative Party is yours for the asking!\\" In his Technical Notes for The Goon Show Compendium Volume Twelve (2016), remastering engineer Ted Kendall describes how he and Dirk Maggs decided to produce a 25th Anniversary \\"restored\\" version of the programme in 1997 by selecting material from all of the available sources. These included the BBC Transcription Services multitrack tapes which also contained rehearsal material. For the Compendium, Kendall remastered the 1997 version and, in his words, removed some rough edges. Topical jokes As with the original series, references to contemporary events are heard in the show, and with the passage of time the significance of the references has faded. For instance, at one point Neddie declares that he must get Bluebottle's photographs back \\"before Bryan Forbes turns them into a novelty!\\" This was a reference to the recently published first novel (The Distant Laughter) by the film director Forbes. The novel had been received with derision in certain quarters, particularly in Private Eye. There are other references to Private Eye and its humour to be heard. At the time the magazine was celebrating its tenth anniversary. During the warm up, Secombe jokes that he is broadcasting \\"live via satellite from Neasden\\", a reference to the all-purpose urban location used in Private Eyes parodies and fake news articles. Reviews The British press celebrated the event more for its historic significance than the actual content of the show. There was extensive reporting of the pre- and post- show publicity including interviews with the participants. Since Sellers was by then an internationally known film star, and Secombe had become a regular performer in other contexts, such as his appearance as Mr. Bumble in the film of Oliver!, the Lionel Bart musical, there was much public interest even among those unfamiliar with the original show. The sleeve notes for the LP release quote newspaper articles, including one from The Guardian headlined \\"Goons Reithed in Glory\\". > Fifty years of nation speaking peace unto nation. Fifty years of Reith, > Normanbrook, Hill and Alvar Lidell and how does the British Broadcasting > Corporation celebrate the occasion? Answer: with a maniac cackle. It showed > a fitting sense of history. The Goons, after all, were the fathers of the > great national in-joke and a private language.

The largest settlement in the parish, which covers , is Solva, whose own church is dedicated to St Aidan. The parishes of Whitchurch and St Elvis make up the community of Solva. History By the churchyard gate is a standing stone called ', believed to be the lower part of a large Celtic cross. Whitchurch was a chapelry in the parish of St David's before becoming a parish in its own right. It is marked on a 1578 parish map held by the British Library. A later, but pre-1850 parish map shows the extensive parish including several smaller settlements, including the village of Solva, in which there were numerous chapels. Much of the land was still unenclosed in the 19th century. Whitchurch was in the ancient hundred of Dewisland and in the 1830s had a population of 1,028. The population varied from 599 in 1801 to a maximum of 1,252 in 1851, then had fallen to 800 by 1961. Whitchurch and Solva share a War Memorial, on which the names of 50 parishioners are listed as having lost their lives in two world wars.

First theater performances are staged in 1825 by the teacher Djordje Evgenijevic and his pupils. During his second visit to Kragujevac Joakim Vujiƒá worked together with them. In the autumn of 1834 at the invitation of Grand Duke Milo≈°, Joakim Vujiƒá, best known and highly esteemed person for his theater work, came to Kragujevac with large experience and repertoire.

The song, released in May 1956, went on to become a number 1 country hit that year, establishing Price's sound, and redefining honky-tonk music. It was Price's first No. 1 hit. The song was published in 1949 by pedal steel player Ralph Mooney and Charles \\"Chuck\\" Seals. The actual lyricist may have been Paul Gilley of Kentucky, who worked as a ghost writer for various artists including Hank Williams. Background \\"Crazy Arms\\" first appeared in the style of a traditional country ballad.Malone, Bill, \\"Classic Country Music: A Smithsonian Collection\\" ((booklet included with Classic Country Music: A Smithsonian Collection 4-disc set). Smithsonian Institution, 1990), p.51. Ralph Mooney reportedly wrote the song in 1949, at a time when he was playing in Wynn Stewart's band on the West Coast. In 1954 in Pasadena, California, Stewart recorded a demo version of the song on 78 rpm acetate ‚Äì this version was never released. The story of the song continues with recollections by country singer Hank Cochran, who said that successful California baker Claude Caviness and his wife Marilyn Kaye both thought Kaye was a great singer, but that other musicians could tell she was not. Caviness formed the Pep record label to promote Kaye, hoping to find her a hit. Mooney sold \\"Crazy Arms\\" to Caviness, and Caviness released a duet version of the song on 45 rpm vinyl, catalog number PEP 102, featuring Kenny Brown and the Arkansas Ramblers, with accompanying vocals by Marilyn Kaye. This version of the song was fairly well received in Tampa, Florida, broadcast on radio station WALT by disc jockey Bob Martin, and when Ray Price toured through the station, Martin played him the record, recommending the song to Price. Price reworked the music and some of the lyrics, and recorded his own version on March 1, 1956, at Bradley Recording Studio in Nashville. After the song became a hit for Price, Caviness contacted Price to tell him that he held the rights to the song. Caviness and Price joined forces in 1959 to publish music under Caviness' reworked Pamper label, with artist manager James Harrell \\"Hal\\" Smith as the third owner. The up-and-coming Price, who already had several successful recordings by 1956, used \\"Crazy Arms\\" to establish himself as a star and to introduce fans to his new Texas shuffle sound: fiddle, pedal steel guitar, walking electric bass and swinging 4/4 rhythm. Those hallmarks became part of many of Price's biggest hits throughout the mid-to-late 1950s and early 1960s, and set a new standard for rockabilly songs. Conflicting song origin Mooney, a pedal steel player on many recordings for Waylon Jennings and Wynn Stewart for over 20 years and a member of the Strangers, said he got the idea for the song after his wife left him because of his drinking problem. However, research came to light in 2012 showing that relatively unknown songwriter Paul Gilley from Kentucky (no relation to Mickey Gilley) probably wrote the lyrics and sold them outright to Mooney, who then took credit for them. Commercial performance Price's version of \\"Crazy Arms\\" reached No. 1 on each of the Billboard magazine country music charts (jukebox, best sellers and radio airplay) in June 1956 and has been credited with spending 20 weeks atop the chart; only three other songs spent longer at No. 1. In addition, Billboard named the song its No. 1 country single of 1956 in its year-end issue. The song's run at No. 1 (which came two years prior to the introduction of the all-encompassing Hot Country Songs chart in October 1958) would not be matched until July 27, 2013, when \\"Cruise\\" by Florida Georgia Line matched its run at No. 1 with 20 weeks. Only two songs since 1956 ‚Äì \\"Walk On By\\" by Leroy Van Dyke (19 weeks, 1961-1962) and \\"Love's Gonna Live Here\\" by Buck Owens (16 weeks, 1963-1964) ‚Äì had come reasonably close to matching the run of \\"Crazy Arms\\" before Florida Georgia Line. Cover versions \\"Crazy Arms\\" has been covered many times by performers both in country music and other genres. Some of the more notable names include Marion Worth, Bing Crosby (for his 1965 album Bing Crosby Sings the Great Country Hits), Louis Armstrong, Chuck Berry, the Andrews Sisters, Gram Parsons, Patsy Cline, Waylon Jennings, Trini Lopez, Mickey Gilley, Great Speckled Bird, Willie Nelson, Patty Loveless, Jerry Lee Lewis 1956, Marie Osmond, and the Jerry Garcia Band. In addition, Price had a cameo role on a version recorded by Barbara Mandrell, on her 1990 album Morning Sun. Karen Chandler and Jimmy Wakely directly covered the Price version in 1956. In 2000 Van Morrison and Linda Gail Lewis performed the song on their album You Win Again. Linda Ronstadt recorded a cover for her 1971 album, Linda Ronstadt. Marty Stuart recorded an instrumental version with Mooney on his 2010 album Ghost Train: The Studio B Sessions. Also recently recording \\"Crazy Arms\\" was Chris Isaak on his CD 2 of \\"Beyond the Sun\\" collection. The Cajun band Kevin Naquin and the Ossun Playboys recorded the song for the 2018 album Man in the Mirror.

Briefly adjutant to Heinrich Himmler, his career was later stalled by Himmler himself. During World War II he served with distinction in the Yugoslav campaign. After the war he remained devoted to National Socialism and Holocaust denial, claiming that Jewish deaths in the Holocaust were exaggerated and becoming an activist in the neo-Nazi Deutsche Reichspartei.Figge, Susan, \\"Father books: Memoirs of the Children of Fascist Fathers\\", 'Revealing Lives, Yallom and Bell, eds, pp 196-200 His life and ideas were recorded by his politically unsympathetic son Sigfrid Gauch in a memoir which was the first significant example of the genre of \\"father memoirs\\" written by the children of former Nazis. Early life Gauch was born in Ein√∂llen. His father was a farmer, who died of malaria in Africa when Hermann was 14. From 1913 to 1917 he studied at Kaiserlautern and Augsburg. In 1917 he joined the German army, participating in the late stages of World War I. He was badly injured at the Battle of Soissons in 1918 and captured by American troops. He escaped from a French prison camp in 1919.Copley, Antony, \\"Hitler's Children, A Preface to Sigfid Gauch's Vaterspuren\\", in Gauch, Sigfrid, Traces of My Father, William Radice, trans. Northwestern University Press, xi-xx. In the post-war years Gauch trained to become a physician, qualifying in 1924. In 1922 he joined the Nazi party, becoming a member of Rudolf Hess's S.A. unit. In 1924 he participated in the assassination of Franz Josef Heinz, leader of the separatist government of the Palatinate. At this time Gauch was closest to the circles of the Nordicist and neopagan faction within the party led by Himmler, Alfred Rosenberg and Walter Darr√©. After the Nazi party was disbanded following the Beer Hall Putsch, Gauch's party membership lapsed. He did not renew it in 1925 when the party was re-established because by that time he was employed as a doctor in the Handelsmarine (merchant marine) and later the Kriegsmarine, which precluded party membership. He rejoined the party in 1934, also becoming a member of the SS. He was briefly Himmler's adjutant for cultural and racial affairs, but was not a success in the post. He resigned from the SS in 1935 after marriage became a requirement for membership. His application to rejoin in 1937 was turned down by Himmler personally. Theories Gauch remained close to Darr√©, whose vision of the agricultural self-sufficiency of Nordic peasantry he shared. He wrote six books of \\"race research\\" while a member of the SS, expressing both antisemitic and Nordicist ideas, emphasising them to an extent that was extreme even in Nazi Germany. He insisted in 1933 that the fact that \\"birds can be taught to talk better than other animals is explained by the fact that their mouths are Nordic in structure.\\" He further claimed that in humans, \\"the shape of the Nordic gum allows a superior movement of the tongue, which is the reason why Nordic talking and singing are richer.\\" In 1934 his most important book New Foundations for Racial Research was published. Gauch argued that, > We can advance the assertion that at the base of all Racial Science there is > no concept of \\"human being\\" in contradistinction to animals separated by any > physical or mental trait; the only existing differentiation is between > Nordic man, on the one hand, and animals as a whole, including all non- > Nordic human beings, or sub-men, who are transitional forms of development. > It has not been proven, moreover, that the non-Nordic man cannot be mated > with apes.Stetson Kennedy, Southern Exposure, Doubleday, 1946, p.331 However Gauch soon caused embarrassment to the leadership when he published Out of the Flower Garden of Racial Research, in which he went further, calling Italians \\"half-ape\\". As a result, the work was banned in Nazi Germany. He also believed that racial mixture led to disease, claiming that \\"Hereditary cancer is the conflict of races within the human body.\\"Hamilton Fish Armstrong, We or They:Two Worlds in Conflict, Macmillan, New York, 1936. p21 Gauch also advocated de-Christianising German culture. He submitted a proposal to Darr√© to reform the calendar, getting rid of Christian festivals and replacing them with Germanic pagan ones. The proposal led to a protest from the future Pope Pius XII.Gauch, Sigfrid (trans. Radice, Wilhem), Traces of my Father, Northwestern University Press, p.92. He also proposed that Charlemagne, known as Karl the Great (Karl der Grosse) in German, should be officially renamed Karl the Slaughterer, because of his wars against the pagan Saxons in the name of Christianity. He was instrumental in the creation of a memorial to pagans murdered by Charlemagne in the Massacre of Verden, which was erected in Verden an der Aller in 1935. World War II Gauch enlisted on the outbreak of World War II, serving initially in the Luftwaffe, but was later invalided out after damaging his spine in an accident during a training flight. He subsequently claimed that he had suggested to Himmler the policy of Germanisation in Poland, by absorbing racially suitable Polish children, who showed \\"Nordic\\" characteristics. On 13 October 1939 he took custody of downed RAF officer Harry Day, with whom he remained in contact after the war.Gauch, p.81-82. He served in the Yugoslav campaign and was commended for his actions capturing Zagreb with a few men. He then became a doctor with the 23rd Luftnachrichtenregiment. Reapplying once more to the SS in 1942, his application was supported by Oswald Pohl, but he was again rejected by Himmler. He ran a hospital in Lauterecken until the final stage of the war, when he was transferred to the Western front, suffering a serious injury in the last few weeks of the conflict. Post-war Gauch was cleared of involvement in war crimes following the denazifaction process, but could not work as a state physician. He maintained a successful private practice in Kaiserlautern. According to his son, he continued to believe in his racial theories after the war, convincing himself that neo-Nazis would eventually take power in Germany. He also argued that accepted statistics of Jewish deaths in the Holocaust were highly exaggerated, and indeed impossible. He was an active member of the Deutsche Reichspartei, and acted as its regional spokesman on culture and education. In 1961 he was named in the Eichmann trial for providing ideological justification for the Holocaust because of his view that non-Nordics are \\"sub-human\\".The Trial of Adolf Eichmann, Sessions 6-7-8, Nizkor Project. Family He married in 1943. His son Sigfrid was born in 1945, a few weeks before the end of the war. The couple also had a daughter. Hermann's womanising led to him separating from his wife seven years later, and he subsequently lived with a mistress. Soon after his death in 1978 Sigfrid published Vaterspuren (1979; translated as Traces of my Father), a book which provided a model for later memoirs about coping with a Nazi family background.

Training of Young Leaders is achieved through eleven lettered modules covering the necessary skills to play an active part of the leadership team, with members challenged to apply what they have learned through four 'missions' in their sections. Recognition of the scheme is achieved through a series of badges and culminates in the Young Leader belt buckle award which is worn with their uniform. The Young Leaders Badge is awarded upon the completion of the compulsory training module and is surrounded by one of four mission badges as each 'mission' is completed; the buckle is awarded only through the completion of every module and mission. The scheme has been popular with young people looking to volunteer in their community. Since its launch in 2002, the scheme has grown from 1,245 young leaders to 10,394 a decade later with transferable skills being highlighted as a benefit.  History  The 2003‚Äì2015 design of Young Leader award badges. The Young Leader's scheme emerged in the early 21st century from the newly introduced Explorer Scouts programme for 14 to 18-year olds, which was formally launched in 2002 following six years of reviews looking at the future of the movement and the youth programme. The full scheme launched in 2003, allowing Explorer Scouts and those of a similar age to volunteer with the younger sections as part of the leadership team. Training was split into self- contained modules, lettered for identification, to match the refresh in the adult volunteer training scheme that was launched in September of that year. Completion of the first module awarded the Young Leader with the diamond shaped badge, dark blue in colour with a purple border and 'YL' in the centre, while completion of the missions that put the learnt skills into action was recognised through a further trapezium-shaped badge being awarded that was placed around the edge of the original award. Completion of the full scheme, including all missions and modules completed, resulted in the award of the Young Leader's belt buckle to be worn with uniform. The scheme was an unexpected success and the number of Explorer Scouts volunteering as Young Leaders had reached 10,394 by 2012, within the first 10 years of the scheme. That year the contribution made by Young Leaders was recognised by the Scout Association in evidence provided to Parliament's Education Select Committee linked to services to young people and the then current ideology of the big society. In it, the Scouts supported the creation of a National Citizen Service, believing that graduates of the scheme may seek to continue volunteering as a Young Leader while describing the benefits of the scheme saying that \\"It is our view that this exposes young people to a culture of volunteering at an early age and encourages them to take active leadership roles in their communities.\\" In 2015 the wider Scout programme was refreshed which included the Young Leader's scheme with the modules receiving updated content and delivery methods. The design of the badges and awards was also updated to an acorn and oak leaves to reflect the Gilwell Oak and the role of Young Leaders as future leaders of the movement. The Young Leader belt buckle was also added to the adult uniform and a recognition badge for the adult uniform added to mark a young person's time as a young leader upon becoming an adult leader.  Membership and organisation  Members of The Scout Association's Explorer Scout section are able to become Young Leaders, instead of or in addition to the normal Explorer Scout programme, between the core ages of 14 and 18 years of age although they can join from 13.5 years of age. These full Explorer Scout Young Leaders wear the Explorer Scout uniform and make the promise like any other Explorer Scout as well as being able to take part in the full Explorer Scout programme. In addition, 14 to 18-year-old members of Girlguiding and 14 to 18-year-old young people completing The Duke of Edinburgh's Award can become Young Leaders to complete the volunteering elements of their awards. They must complete training like other young leaders but cannot access the wider Explorer Scout programme and can only volunteer for a fixed amount of time. The Young Leaders of a District are considered to be in a separate Explorer Scout Unit, and are under the supervision of an Explorer Scout Leader, although this may not always be the case, in which case the District Explorer Scout Commissioner or District Commissioner takes on this responsibility. A Young Leaders' Unit might have its own weekly programme, separate to other Units within the District, or may only provide training and possibly some other events in the year.  Training  =Modules= Young Leaders have a training programme, similar to that of adult leaders, comprising 11 self contained modules. These can be run individually over a longer time frame or combined into a longer course. These modules also count towards part of their Wood Badge if they choose to become an adult in Scouting at the age of 18, counting as prior-learning. * Module A ‚Äì Prepare for take-off (Essentials and Expectations). Covers the values of the scout movement, health and safety of participants including the importance of risk assessments and the Young Leader's role in the safeguarding of members and child protection systems. It is the only compulsory module and must be completed within three months of starting with completion marked by the award of the Young Leader's badge. * Module B ‚Äì Taking the lead. Covers different leadership styles, the importance of self review and features of good leaders and teams. * Module C ‚Äì That's the way to do it! Introduces the concept of learning styles and different methods of instructing young people in skills, leading sessions and communicating. * Module D ‚Äì Understanding Behaviour. Introduces Young Leaders to the basics of behaviour management including causes and triggers for challenging behaviour and methods of managing behaviour. * Module E ‚Äì Game on! Covers different types of games, selecting games suitable to the programme and how to play them effectively. * Module F ‚Äì Making Scouting accessible and inclusive. Covers additional needs, making adjustments to the programme to accommodate young people with additional needs and makes reference to the Scout Equality policy and definitions of key terms. * Module G ‚Äì What is a high quality programme? Covers the Scout programme including badges and awards, reviewing the programme for quality and the importance of providing a balanced programme. * Module H ‚Äì Programme Planning. To be completed after Module G looking at programme, covers planning techniques and both longer term and individual session plans. * Module I ‚Äì What did they say? Covers the importance of getting feedback from section members and how to involve young people in the decision making of the section and programme plans. Links to the Scout youth empowerment initiative 'YouShape'. * Module J ‚Äì Communicate it! Covers adapting communication styles, aspects of non-verbal communication and communicating the skills learnt during the Young Leader's scheme to those outside of the movement including potential employers. * Module K ‚Äì First Aid. Trains the young people in first aid techniques to become a first responder in case of medical emergencies. It is the same content as adult leader First Aid training. = Missions = There are also four missions for Young Leaders to complete, which involve running games and activities for their relevant section. The purpose of the missions is to apply what has been learnt in their sections day to day, similar to the validation phase of adult Scout leader training. Upon completing each mission, an additional badge can be added around the edge of the standard Young Leader badge. Upon completing all modules and missions, Young Leaders are entitled to wear a Young Leader belt buckle to recognise this achievement. * Mission 1 Run three games of different styles, including indoor and outdoor games, with their section. * Mission 2 Run an activity that is not a game with their section. * Mission 3 Gather the ideas and feedback of the section and present them at a programme planning meeting. * Mission 4 Be responsible for organising and running a part of the programme such as a camp or night away, running a particular challenge award or exploring a wider skill.  Links to other organisations  Part of the scheme's appeal is that volunteering with the Scouts as a Young Leader can contribute towards completing other awards and schemes by other youth organisations. *Explorer Scouts and young people often partake in the Young Leaders scheme to complete the volunteering element of The Duke of Edinburgh's Award. Volunteering with the Scouts, including as a Young Leader, was the fourth most popular way for young people to achieve this part of the award in 2019. Additionally three top awards for Explorer Scouts, the Chief Scout's Platinum Award, the Chief Scout's Diamond Award and the Queen's Scout Award, are linked to the Duke of Edinburgh's Award (Bronze, Silver and God respectively) including the volunteering aspect. *Members of Girlguiding aged between 14 and 18 years of age are able to become a Young Leader to complete any Girlguiding award that has a volunteering element. The Scout Association explicitly mention this is possible for the Queen's Guide Award although Girlguiding do not mention it explicitly in any of their literature. *Some Scout groups since 2017 have been using the Young Leader's scheme to hep deliver the National Citizen Service to encourage personal development, social mobility and cohesion and civic engagement. This was announced in July 2017 as part of a three-year pilot initiative. While the partnership was seen by some as a way of making the NCS more viable and connected into the wider youth sector, there were concerns that the ¬£1,500,000 available to the partnership could be put to better use by partnering with other smaller organisations.

The target is 50% of the workforce in the Industry and Energy sector. Qatarization is one of the focuses of the Qatar National Vision 2030. While the expatriate population has rapidly grown since the late 20th century, the Qatari population has increased only at a marginal rate. Therefore, as a means to decrease dependence on foreign labor, the Qatari government has heavily prioritized Qatarization in recent years. History The first Qatarization scheme was formulated in 1962, with Qatari Labor Law No. 3, which stipulated that Qatari nationals are to be given first priority for filling vacant positions in the workforce. A government census conducted in 1970 revealed that only 16% of the economically active population were Qatari nationals. The only industry with a higher proportion of Qatari citizens to foreigners was the oil industry, which was a result of Qatarization policies. In the early 1970s, after Qatar gained independence, administrative posts in the public sector were Qatarized. This resulted in 97% of the top administrative positions in the school system being occupied by Qataris by the 1990s. In May 1997, an emiri decree stipulated that at least 20% of the employees of private sector businesses must be Qatari citizens. On 1 June 2000, the most comprehensive Qatarization program went into effect with the aim of reaching a 50% national workforce in the energy sector by 2005. The program fell short of its target, with Qataris comprising only 28% of the labor force in the energy sector by the deadline. Challenges A study by the RAND Corporation found that Qatari women are twice as likely to be university-educated as males. However, as a result of gender-exclusionary degrees in public universities, certain sectors are unable to benefit from the more proportionately educated female population.

Listed at 6' 2\\", 170 lb., Hesketh batted and threw left-handed. He was selected by the Expos in the 1980 draft out of the State University of New York at Buffalo. One of the most dominant pitchers in UB history, Hesketh compiled an overall 1.77 ERA, including a notable 0.91 during his junior season. He also had 10 complete games for the Buffalo Bulls and pitched one of the greatest wins in school history ‚Äì a 4‚Äì0 shutout against powerful St. John‚Äôs team and future major league star Frank Viola. Hesketh also picked up the save in a victory on the road over nationally ranked University of Miami. In 1979, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Cotuit Kettleers of the Cape Cod Baseball League. After that, he earned the 1980 ECAC New York-New Jersey District Player of the Year honors, as his six shutouts for the Bulls remain a school record. In 1984, Hesketh was named the American Association pitcher of the year after going 12‚Äì3 with a 3.05 ERA and 135 strikeouts in 147‚Öî innings for the Indianapolis Indians. He joined the Montreal Expos late in the season and ended with a 2‚Äì2, 1.80 ERA in 11 appearances. His debut on August 7 against the Philadelphia Phillies was unusual, in that he was called for a balk before he delivered his first pitch. In 1985 he was 10‚Äì5 with a 3.29 ERA in 25 starts, allowing just 125 hits in a career-high 155‚Öì innings into late August, but a home plate collision broke his leg and his season was over. He was considered in the National League Rookie of the Year vote. In 1986 he was bothered by an impinged nerve in his left shoulder, then missed virtually all of 1987. While Hesketh did bounce back to some extent as a reliever, he never completely recovered. Hesketh was released by Montreal in April 1990. At least a half-dozen teams claimed him, so he ended up in Atlanta by virtue of the Braves' poor record. Then, although he had recorded five saves, the Braves released him after 31 appearances. Once more, he was not out of work long, as the Boston Red Sox quickly signed him in late July. in 1991 Hesketh came back of several injury-plagued seasons. He ended with a 12‚Äì4 mark in 39 games for Boston, including 17 starts and a career second-best 153‚Öì innings, as his .750 won-loss % topped American League pitchers. The next three years he divided his playing time as a starter, middle reliever, and occasional closer. He retired after the 1994 season. In an 11-season career, Hesketh posted a 60‚Äì47 record with a 3.78 ERA in 339 appearances, including 114 starts, four complete games, two shutouts, 79 games finished, 21 saves, 726 strikeouts, 378 walks, and 961‚Öî innings of work. Hesketh is a member of both the UB Athletic Hall of Fame (Class of ‚Äô86) as well as the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame (2002). In 2006, he was named the Bulls‚Äô pitching coach by head coach Ron Torgalski. His tenure with the UB Bulls ended after the 2007‚Äì2008 season.  1984‚Äì1988 seasons  In this time period, Joe Hesketh played for the Expos, with stats totalling 22-15, 3.07 ERA, 129 games, 11 saves, 384.1 innings pitched, 341 hits, 152 runs, 141 bases on balls, and 307 strikeouts.

It is one of some 40 related species of the genus Actinidia, and closely related to Actinidia deliciosa, which is the source of the most common commercial kiwifruit. Fruit colour may vary from green to lime green or gold, depending on breeding. Description A sliced golden kiwifruit Inner pulp of the fruit, edible Actinidia chinensis has a smooth, bronze skin, with a beak shape at the stem attachment. Flesh colour varies from bright green to a clear, intense yellow. This species is sweeter and more aromatic in flavour compared to A. deliciosa, similar to some subtropical fruits. One of the most attractive varieties has a red 'iris' around the centre of the fruit and yellow flesh outside. The yellow fruit obtains a higher market price and, being less hairy than the fuzzy kiwifruit, is more palatable for consumption without peeling. A commercially viable variety of this red-ringed kiwifruit, patented as EnzaRed, is a cultivar of the Chinese hong yang variety. 'Hort16A' is a golden kiwifruit cultivar marketed worldwide, first as Zespri Gold, then as SunGold. This cultivar suffered significant losses in New Zealand from late 2010 to 2013 due to the PSA bacterium. A new cultivar of golden kiwifruit, 'Gold3', was found to be more disease-resistant and most growers changed to this cultivar, with its worldwide demand continuing into 2019. Habitat In its native habitat Actinidia chinensis grows in thickets, thick (oak) forests (e.g. Quercus aquifolioides, Quercus oxyodon, Quercus lamellosa), and light secondary forests and bushland. A. chinensis prefers slopes and likes also to grow in ravines, top heights of 200-230m, relative to the local microclimate. In Western gardens it may range 30 feet in all directions, making it unsuitable for all but the largest spaces unless pruned back hard at the end of every growing season. Origin and cultivation The origin of Actinidia chinensis is from Hubei or Sichuan, China exported to New Zealand in 1904. In China, Actinidia chinensis is dispersed in the entire southeast of the country. It was first grown commercially in New Zealand, where it has been bred commercially as the variety, Actinidia deliciosa. Herbarium specimens, but not plants, were forwarded to the Royal Horticultural Society by the British plant hunter Robert Fortune, from which Jules √âmile Planchon named the new genus in the London Journal of Botany, 1847. Charles Maries, collecting for Messrs Veitch noted it in Japan, but the introduction to Western horticulture was from E.H. Wilson, who sent seeds collected in Hupeh to Veitch in 1900.Alice M. Coats, Garden Shrubs and Their History (1964) 1992, s.v. \\"Actinidia\\". Uses The fruits - about the size of a chicken egg - are edible, providing a rich source of vitamin C and dietary fiber.

Parepa's aristocratic father died soon after her birth, and her mother turned to the stage to support them. Parepa made her operatic debut in 1855, at age 16, and soon earned enthusiastic reviews in the major London opera houses. In 1867, following the death of her first husband, Parepa married the violinist and conductor Carl Rosa in New York, and they founded an opera company with Parepa as the leading lady. They toured successfully in America for several years. After their return to Britain with ambitious plans for their opera company, Parepa fell ill and died in 1874 at only 37 years of age. Early life and career Bust of Parepa-Rosa at the Royal Academy of Music Euphrosyne Parepa was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, to the soprano Elisabeth Seguin (b. 1812, sister of basso Arthur Edward Seguin) and the Wallachian boyar Demetrius Parepa, Baron Georgiades de Boyescu of Bucharest.\\"Madame Parepa-Rosa\\", Illustrated London News, 7 February 1874, p. 129 Her father died when Parepa was an infant, leaving her young mother impoverished.

Her operatic d√©but was in 1855 at the age of 16 in Malta as Amina in La Sonnambula, followed by engagements in Italy, Spain and Portugal. She gave her first London performance at the Lyceum Theatre, in the role of Elvira in I Puritani, with the Royal Italian Opera company, with whom she spent the 1857 season.Rosenthal, Harold and Elizabeth Forbes. \\"Parepa(-Rosa), Euphrosyne (De Boyescu, Parepa)\\", Grove Music Online, 20 January 2001, accessed 22 May 2018The Royal Italian Opera company held their 1856‚Äì57 season at the Lyceum because the Royal Opera House was being remodeled after a fire.

She acts and sings well. Her version of \\"Son vergine vezzosa\\" elicited applause terminating in a recall, and ‚Ä¶ [after the finale] she was again called for. ‚Ä¶ \\"Qui la voce\\" ‚Ä¶ was correctly and brilliantly executed; and the artiste was again summoned back to the stage to receive the homage of the audience.\\"\\"Royal Italian Opera: First Appearance of Mdlle.

During this time, she participated in two operatic premieres, creating the title role in Alfred Mellon's Victorine in 1859 and the role of Mabel in George Alexander Macfarren's opera Helvellyn in 1864. She also was a successful oratorio and concert soloist, in constant demand in Britain and beyond. She sang with Charles Santley at the opening of the Oxford Music Hall in 1861, appeared before the Royal Philharmonic Society in Schumann's Paradise and the Peri and participated in the 19th-century English revival of the music of Handel, performing at the Handel festivals of 1862 and 1865, and in Germany.R.

She travelled to the United States in 1865 with cornetist Jules Levy and violinist Carl Rosa, the latter of whom she married in New York City in 1867. Together they quickly established the Parepa-Rosa English Opera Company there, featuring her as the leading soprano, which became popular, and which introduced opera to places in America that had never staged it before. They opened at the French Theatre on Fourteenth Street, New York City, in September 1869 with a performance of Balfe's opera The Puritan's Daughter, with Parepa singing the title role. The subsequent tour of the eastern and midwestern states included a repertoire that ranged from The Bohemian Girl and Maritana to Weber's Der Freisch√ºtz and Oberon. In 1870, the Parepa-Rosa Opera Company returned to Britain and then appeared in Italian opera at Cairo, Egypt, followed by a return to America for another successful tour in 1871‚Äì72. In 1872, Parepa sang at the Lower Rhine Festival in D√ºsseldorf, and they then returned to London, where she sang Donna Anna in Don Giovanni and the title role in Norma at the Royal Opera House. In September 1873, the company changed its name to Carl Rosa's English Opera, since Parepa was pregnant. Parepa died in London, after an illness, at the age of 37 while preparing to sing Elsa in an English version of Wagner's Lohengrin as part of her husband's planned season a Theatre Royal, Drury Lane; after her death, Rosa cancelled the season.Obituary: \\"Madame Parepa Rosa\\", The Times, 23 January 1874, p. 10 She is buried at Highgate cemetery.Legge, R.

Reputation William Winter wrote that \\"Great vocal powers have seldom found such ample or such touching expression as those of Parepa-Rosa did in the first act of Norma. ‚Ä¶ [O]ne of her best successes was made as Rosina in The Barber of Seville ... to indicate the versatility of her talents and the scope and thoroughness of her culture.\\"Winter, William. Brief Chronicles, Ayer Publishing (1970) Her obituary in Illustrated London News stated: \\"Her voice was a genuine soprano, of extensive compass and fine quality, while her highly-cultivated execution and her general musical knowledge gave her exceptional advantages, both mechanical and intellectual\\". Her achievements were recognised by the Philharmonic Society of London (now the Royal Philharmonic Society) with the rare award of their Gold Medal in 1872.

Life Euphrosyne was the first daughter of Grand Prince Mstislav I of Kiev and his second wife, Ljubava Saviditsch. =Hungary= In 1146, Euphrosyne married King G√©za II of Hungary, who had come of age shortly before. During her husband's reign Euphrosyne did not intervene in the politics of the kingdom, but after his death on 31 May 1162, her influence strengthened over their son, King Stephen III. The young king had to struggle against his uncles Ladislaus and Stephen to save his throne, and Euphrosyne took an active part in the struggles. She persuaded King Vladislaus II of Bohemia to give military assistance to her son against the invasion of the Emperor Manuel I Komnenos. Euphrosyne's favourite son was the youngest, Duke G√©za of Hungary. When King Stephen III died on 4 March 1172, she was planning to ensure his succession against her older son, B√©la, who had been living in the court of the Emperor Manuel I Komnenos. However, B√©la came back, and he was crowned on 13 January 1173, although the Archbishop Luk√°cs of Esztergom denied his coronation. Shortly after, King B√©la III arrested his brother, which increased the tension between Euphrosyne and her son. Duke G√©za soon managed to escape, probably with Euphrosyne's help, but in 1177 he was again arrested. =Later life= In 1186, Euphrosyne tried to release her younger son again, but she failed. King B√©la III ordered the arrest of Euphrosyne and kept her confined in the fortress of Barancs (Serbian: Braniƒçevo). Shortly after, Euphrosyne was set free, but she was obliged to leave the kingdom for Constantinople. From Constantinople she moved to Jerusalem where she lived as a nun in the convent of the Hospitallers, and then in the Basilian monastery of Saint Sabbas.

With the new band, featuring guitarist Vic Briggs, bassist Danny McCulloch, and electric violinist John Weider, Burdon began to move from the gritty blues sound of the original mid-1960s group into psychedelic music. The album is the first to feature nearly entirely original material, written by Eric Burdon and band members, and involving equal songwriting credit. This practice would continue with the following album, The Twain Shall Meet, and was then discontinued. The album opens with the sound of waves washing over the title track, \\"Winds of Change\\". \\"Poem by the Sea\\" is a spoken-word piece by Burdon with a swirl of echo-drenched instruments. \\"Good Times\\" and \\"San Franciscan Nights\\" were two of the most popular tracks, the latter breaking into the top 10 in 1967. Burdon dedicated the album to George Harrison of the Beatles, whose espousal of Hindu philosophy following a visit to India the previous year Burdon cited as an inspiration. Burdon was also a fan and friend of Jimi Hendrix and wrote the fifth track as an answer song to Hendrix's \\"Are You Experienced\\", which was still unreleased at the time the \\"answer\\" was recorded. (Hendrix recorded the track Are You Experienced on 4 April 1967, which puts doubt on the recording date given here as \\"over a two week period in March 1967\\" for Winds Of Change) Reception In their retrospective review, AllMusic described Winds of Change as the band's first real psychedelic rock album. They praised the closing track \\"It's All Meat\\" and the hard-rocking cover of \\"Paint It, Black\\" as rare examples of psychedelic rock songs by the Animals that are strong and convincing.

It was the center of the Scuola dei Greci, the Confraternity of the Greeks in Venice. For centuries, despite the close ties of Venice to the Byzantine world (Venice has been part of the Byzantine Empire), the Greek Orthodox rite was not permitted in Venice. In 1498, the Greek community in Venice gained the right to found the Scuola de San Nicol√≤ dei Greci, a confraternity which aided members of that community. In 1539, after protracted negotiations, the papacy allowed the construction of the church of San Giorgio, financed by a tax on all ships from the Orthodox world. Construction was started by Sante Lombardo, and from 1548, by Giannantonio Chiona. The belltower was built in 1592. The interior has a monument to Gabriele Seviros (1619) by Baldassarre Longhena. The dome of the church was frescoed with the Last Judgement (1589‚Äì93) by Giovanni Kyprios. The iconostasis employed Kyprios, Tommaso Bathas, Benedetto Emporios, and Michael Damaskinos. Emanuele Tzane-Buniales, a priest and hagiographer from Crete, frescoed the Saints Simeon and Alypios, ascetic hermits, atop the pilasters. Amongst the treasures in this church are three icons which Anna Notaras, daughter of Loukas Notaras, the last megas doux of the Byzantine Empire, brought with her to Italy before 1453, and she later gave to the Scuola de San Nicol√≤ dei Greci in trust for when a church observing the Greek Orthodox faith could be constructed. These icons comprise: one of Christ in His glory surrounded by symbols of the four Evangelists and figures of the 12 Apostles; another of Christ Pantokrator; and the third is an image of the Virgin Hodegetria. Near the church lies the Flanginian School, a Greek teachers' school, which today houses the Hellenic Institute of Byzantine and Post- Byzantine Studies in Venice. The Museum was established by Sophia Antoniadis.Manousakas, Manousos (15 February 1972). \\"\\"The facts and issues: Sofia A. Antoniadis\\"\\". Nea Estia. 91: 269‚Äì271.

Overlapping with Toryism, traditionalist conservatism is a conservatism based on the political philosophies of Aristotle and Edmund Burke. Traditionalists emphasize the bonds of social order and the defense of ancestral institutions over what it considers excessive individualism. Traditionalist conservatism places a strong emphasis on the notions of custom, convention and tradition. Theoretical reason is derided over and is considered against practical reason. The state is also seen as a communal enterprise with spiritual and organic qualities. Traditionalists believe that any change is not the result of intentional reasoned thought but flows naturally out of the traditions of the community. Leadership, authority and hierarchy are seen as natural products. Traditionalism developed throughout 18th-century Europe, particularly as a response to the disorder of the English Civil War and the radicalism of the French Revolution. In the middle of the 20th century, traditionalist conservatism started to organize itself in earnest as an intellectual and political force.  Key principles  = Religious faith and natural law = A number of traditionalist conservatives embrace high-church Christianity (e.g. T. S. Eliot, an Anglo-Catholic??; Russell Kirk, a Roman Catholic??;).?? Another traditionalist who has stated his faith tradition publicly is Caleb Stegall, who is an evangelical Protestant.Citation needed. A number of conservative mainline Protestants are also traditionalist conservatives, such as Peter Hitchens, Roger Scruton, writers for TouchstoneNames and citations needed as to both formal religious affiliation and traditional conservatism. and some traditionalists are Jewish, such as the late Will Herberg, Irving Louis Horowitz, Mordecai Roshwald and Paul Gottfried.Citatition needed as to both formal religious affiliation and traditional conservatism. = Tradition and custom = As the name suggests, traditionalists believe that tradition and custom guide man and his worldview. Each generation inherits the experience and culture of its ancestors and through convention and precedent man is able to pass it down to his descendants. To paraphrase Edmund Burke, often regarded as the father of modern conservatism: \\"The individual is foolish, but the species is wise\\". = Hierarchy and organic unity = Traditionalist conservatives believe that human society is essentially hierarchical (i.e. it always involves various interdependent inequalities, degrees and classes and that political structures that recognize this fact prove the most just, thriving and generally beneficial). Hierarchy allows for the preservation of the whole community simultaneously, instead of protecting one part at the expense of the others. = Agrarianism = The countryside and the values of rural life are highly prized (sometimes even being romanticized as in pastoral poetry). The principles of agrarianism (i.e. preserving the small family farm, open land, the conservation of natural resource and stewardship of the land) are central to a traditionalist's understanding of rural life. = Classicism and high culture = Traditionalists defend classical Western civilization and value an education informed by the texts of the Roman and Medieval eras. Similarly, traditionalists are classicists who revere high culture in all of its manifestations (e.g. literature, music, architecture, art and Theatre). = Patriotism, localism and regionalism = Unlike nationalists who esteem the role of the state or nation over the local or regional community, traditionalists hold up patriotism as a key principle. Traditionalist conservatives think that loyalty to a locality or region is more central than any commitment to a larger political entity. Traditionalists also welcome the value of subsidiarity and the intimacy of one's community, preferring the civil society of Burke's \\"little platoons\\" over the expanded state. Alternately, nationalism leads to jingoism and views the state as abstract from the local community and family structure rather than as an outgrowth of these local realities.  History  = British influences = Edmund Burke Traditionalist conservatism began with the thought of Anglo-Irish Whig statesman and philosopher Edmund Burke, whose political principles were rooted in moral natural law and the Western tradition. Burke believed in prescriptive rights and that those rights were \\"God-given\\". He defended what he referred to as \\"ordered liberty\\" (best reflected in the unwritten law of the British constitutional monarchy). He also advocated for those transcendent values that found support in such institutions as the church, the family and the state.Frohnen, Bruce, Jeremy Beer, and Jeffrey O. Nelson (2006) American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia. Wilmington, DE: ISI Books, pp. 107‚Äì09. He was a fierce critic of the principles behind the French Revolution and in 1790 his observations on its excesses and radicalism were collected in Reflections on the Revolution in France. In Reflections, Burke called for the constitutional enactment of specific, concrete rights and warned that abstract rights could be easily abused to justify tyranny. American social critic and historian Russell Kirk wrote: \\"The Reflections burns with all the wrath and anguish of a prophet who saw the traditions of Christendom and the fabric of civil society dissolving before his eyes\\".Kirk, Russell (1967, 1997) Edmund Burke: A Genius Reconsidered. Wilmington, DE: ISI Books, p. 154. Burke's influence extended to later thinkers and writers, both in his native Britain and in continental Europe. Among those influenced by his thought were the English Romantic poets Samuel Taylor Coleridge, William Wordsworth and Robert Southey, Scottish Romantic author Sir Walter Scott,Kirk, Russell (1976, 1997) Edmund Burke: A Genius Reconsidered. Wilmington, DE: ISI Books, p. 155 as well as the counter- revolutionary writers, the French Fran√ßois-Ren√© de Chateaubriand and Louis de Bonald and the Savoyard Joseph de Maistre.Blum, Christopher Olaf, ed. (2004)Critics of the Enlightenment, Wilington, DE: ISI Books, pp. xv‚Äìxxxv. In the United States, the Federalist Party and its leaders, such as President John Adams and Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, best represented Burke's legacy.Viereck, Peter (1956, 2006)Conservative Thinkers from John Adams to Winston Churchill. New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, pp. 87‚Äì95. = Critics of material progress = Burke's traditionalist conservatism found its fiercest defenders in three cultural conservatives and critics of material progress, namely Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Thomas Carlyle and John Henry Newman. According to traditionalist scholar Peter Viereck, Coleridge and his associate and fellow poet William Wordsworth began as supporters of the French Revolution and the radical utopianism it spawned. However, by 1798 their collection of poems, Lyrical Ballads, had rejected the Enlightenment thesis of reason over faith and tradition. Coleridge's later writings, including Lay Sermons (1816), Biographia Literaria (1817) and Aids to Reflection (1825), justified traditional conservative positions on hierarchy and organic society, criticism of materialism and the merchant class and the need for \\"inner growth\\" that is rooted in a traditional and religious culture. Coleridge was a firm believer in social institutions and a harsh critic of Jeremy Bentham and his utilitarian philosophy.Viereck, Peter (1956, 2006)Conservative Thinkers from John Adams to Winston Churchill. New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, pp. 34‚Äì37. Writer, historian and essayist Thomas Carlyle was also an early traditionalist thinker, defending medieval notions such as aristocracy, hierarchy, organic society and class unity over socialism and the \\"cash nexus\\" of laissez-faire capitalism. According to Carlyle, the \\"cash nexus\\" was when social relationships were merely reduced to economic gain. A champion of the poor, Carlyle believed that the fabric of British society was being threatened by mobs, plutocrats, socialists and others who wanted to exploit them and perpetuate class resentment. A devotee of Germanic culture and Romanticism, Carlyle is most known for his writings Sartor Resartus (1833‚Äì1834) and Past and Present (1843).Viereck, Peter (1956, 2006)Conservative Thinkers from John Adams to Winston Churchill. New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, pp. 37‚Äì39. In the mid-19th century, the Church of England experienced a \\"catholic revival\\" in the form of the Oxford Movement, a religious movement designed to restore the Catholic nature of Anglicanism. Led by John Keble, Edward Pusey and John Henry Newman, the Tractarians (so called for the publication of their Tracts for the Times) condemned religious liberalism while defending \\"dogma, ritual, poetry, [and] tradition\\". Like Coleridge and Carlyle, Newman (who became a Roman Catholic in 1845 and eventually a Cardinal in the Church) and the Tractarians were critical of material progress, or the notion that wealth, prosperity and economic gain were the sum of human existence.Viereck, Peter (1956, 2006)Conservative Thinkers from John Adams to Winston Churchill. New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, pp. 39‚Äì40. = Cultural and artistic criticism = Culture and the arts were also important to British traditionalist conservatives and two of the most prominent defenders of tradition in culture and the arts were Matthew Arnold and John Ruskin. Matthew Arnold, a poet and cultural critic, is best known for his poetry and literary, social and religious criticism. His book Culture and Anarchy (1869) took on the middle-class Victorian values of the day (Arnold viewed middle class tastes in literature as \\"philistinism\\") and argued for a return to the classical literature of the past. Arnold also viewed with skepticism the plutocratic grasping in socioeconomic affairs which Coleridge, Carlyle and the Oxford Movement criticized.Viereck, Peter (1956, 2006)Conservative Thinkers from John Adams to Winston Churchill. New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, p. 40. Arnold vigorously attacked Liberal Party, and its Nonconformist base. He ridiculed William Ewart Gladstone and Liberal efforts to disestablish the Anglican Church in Ireland, establish a Catholic university there, permit burial services to dissenters in Church of England cemeteries, demand temperance, and ignore the need to improve the middle class members rather than impose their unreasonable beliefs on society. Liberal education was essential, and by that Arnold meant a close reading and attachment to the cultural classics, coupled with critical reflection. He feared anarchy--the fragmentation of life into isolated facts that caused by dangerous educational panaceas that emerged from materialistic and utilitarian philosophies. He was appalled at the shamelessness of the sensationalistic new journalism of the sort he witnessed on his tour the United States in 1888. He prophesied, \\"if one were searching for the best means to efface and kill in a whole nation the discipline of self-respect, the feeling for what is elevated, he could do no better than take the American newspapers.\\"Quoted in One of the themes that traditionalist conservatives have consistently reiterated has been the theme that industrial capitalism is as questionable as the classical liberalism which spawned it. Carrying on in this tradition was cultural and artistic critic John Ruskin, a medievalist who called himself a \\"Christian socialist\\" and cared much for standards in culture, the arts and society. For Ruskin (as with all the 19th-century cultural conservatives), the Industrial Revolution had fomented dislocation, rootlessness and the mass urbanization of the poor. In his art criticism, he wrote The Stones of Venice (1851‚Äì1853), which took on the Classical tradition while defending Gothic art and architecture. His other works included The Seven Lamps of Architecture and Unto This Last (1860).Viereck, Peter (1956, 2006) Conservative Thinkers from John Adams to Winston Churchill. New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, pp. 40‚Äì41. = One-nation conservatism = In politics, the ideas of Burke, Coleridge, Carlyle, Newman and other traditionalist conservatives were distilled into the policies and philosophy of former British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. Disraeli in his younger years was an opponent of middle class capitalism and the industrial policies that were promoted by the \\"Manchester liberals\\" (the Reform Bill and the Corn Laws). Seeking a way to alleviate the suffering of the urban poor in the wake of the Industrial Revolution, Disraeli sought out to unify the nation by way of \\"one-nation conservatism\\", where a coalition of aristocrats and the common working man would unite to stave off the influences of the liberal middle class. This new coalition would serve as a way to work with the enfranchised masses while grounding them in \\"ancient conservative traditions\\". Disraeli's ideas (including his criticism of utilitarianism) found fruit in the \\"Young England\\" movement and in writings such as Vindication of the English Constitution (1835), The Radical Tory (1837) and his \\"social novels\\" Coningsby (1844) and Sybil (1845).Viereck, pp. 42‚Äì45. A few years later, his one-nation conservatism found new life in the \\"Tory democracy\\" of Lord Randolph Churchill and in the early 21st century in the \\"progressive conservatism\\" of the Red Tory thesis of British philosopher Phillip Blond. = Distributism = Hilaire Belloc in 1915 In the early 20th century, traditionalist conservatism found its defenders through the efforts of Hilaire Belloc, G. K. Chesterton and other proponents of the socioeconomic system they advocated: distributism. Originating in the papal encyclical Rerum novarum, distributism employed the concept of subsidiarity as a \\"third way\\" solution to the twin evils of socialism and capitalism. It favors local economies, small business, the agrarian way of life and craftsmen and artists. In such books as Belloc's The Servile State (1912), Economics for Helen (1924) and An Essay on the Restoration of Property (1936) and Chesterton's The Outline of Sanity (1926), traditional communities that echoed those found in the Middle Ages were advocated and big business and big government condemned. In the United States, distributist ideas were embraced by the journalist Herbert Agar, Catholic activist Dorothy Day and through the influence of the German-born British economist E. F. Schumacher and were comparable to the work of Wilhelm Roepke.Frohnen, Bruce, Jeremy Beer, and Jeffrey O. Nelson (2006) American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia. Wilmington, DE: ISI Books, pp. 235‚Äì36. T. S. Eliot was a champion of the Western tradition and orthodox Christian culture. Eliot was a political reactionary who used modernist literary means for traditionalist ends. His After Strange Gods (1934) and Notes towards the Definition of Culture (1948) align with the grand tradition of Christian humanism extending back to Edmund Burke, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Thomas Carlyle, John Ruskin, G. K. Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc. Educated by Irving Babbitt and George Santayana at Harvard University, Eliot was friends with Allen Tate and Russell Kirk.Frohnen, Bruce, Jeremy Beer, and Jeffrey O. Nelson (2006) American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia. Wilmington, DE: ISI Books, pp. 263‚Äì66. Praised by T. S. Eliot as the most powerful intellectual influence in Britain, historian Christopher Dawson is a key figure in 20th-century traditionalism. Central to his work was the idea that religion was at the heart of every culture, especially Western culture and his writings, including The Age of Gods (1928), Religion and Culture (1948) and Religion and the Rise of Western Culture (1950), reflected this view. A contributor to Eliot's Criterion, Dawson believed that after World War II, religion and culture were central to rebuilding the West in the wake of fascism and the rise of communism.Frohnen, Bruce, Jeremy Beer, and Jeffrey O. Nelson (2006) American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia. Wilmington, DE: ISI Books, pp. 219‚Äì20.  In Europe  = Philosophers = Roger Scruton British philosopher Roger Scruton was a self-described traditionalist conservative. Known for writing on such topics as foreign policy, animal rights, arts and culture and philosophy, one of his most noted books is The Meaning of Conservatism (1980). Scruton was affiliated with the Center for European Renewal, the Trinity Forum, the Institute for the Psychological Sciences and the American Enterprise Institute. He wrote for such publications as Modern Age, National Review, The American Spectator, The New Criterion and City Journal. Recently British philosopher Phillip Blond has risen to prominence as an exponent of traditionalist philosophy, more specifically progressive conservatism, or Red Toryism. In Blond's view, Red Toryism would combine civic communitarianism with localism and traditional values as a way to revitalize British conservatism and British society. He has formed a think tank, Res Publica. = Publications and political organizations = The oldest traditionalist conservative publication in the United Kingdom is The Salisbury Review, which was founded by British philosopher Roger Scruton. The Salisbury Reviews current managing editor is Merrie Cave. Within the British Conservative Party there is a faction of traditionalist MPs which formed in 2005 who are collectively known as the Cornerstone Group. The Cornerstone Group stands for traditional values and represents \\"faith, flag, and family\\". Prominent members include Edward Leigh and John Henry Hayes. The Edmund Burke Foundation is an educational foundation based out of the Netherlands which is traditionalist and is modeled after the Intercollegiate Studies Institute. Originally a think tank, it was founded by such traditionalists as scholar Andreas Kinneging and journalist Bart Jan Spruyt. It is affiliated with The Center for European Renewal. In 2007, a number of leading traditionalist scholars from Europe as well as representatives of the Edmund Burke Foundation and the Intercollegiate Studies Institute created the Center for European Renewal, which is designed to be the European version of the Intercollegiate Studies Institute.  In the United States   Political organizations  Other traditionalist organizations include the Trinity Forum, Ellis Sandoz's Eric Voegelin Institute and the Eric Voegelin Society, the New Centurion Program of the Conservative Institute, the T. S. Eliot Society, the Malcolm Muggeridge Society and the Free Enterprise Institute's Center for the American Idea. A major funder of traditionalist programs, especially the Russell Kirk Center, is the Wilbur Foundation.  Literary  Literary traditionalists are often linked with political conservatives and the right-wing while contrasted with experimental works and the avant-garde, which in turn are often linked with progressives and the left-wing. Postmodern writer and literary theorist John Barth, said: \\"I confess to missing, in apprentice seminars in the later 1970s and the 1980s, that lively Make-It-New spirit of the Buffalo Sixties. A roomful of young traditionalists can be as depressing as a roomful of young Republicans\\".John Barth (1984) intro to The Literature of Exhaustion, in The Friday Book. There are numerous literary figures featured in Russell Kirk's The Conservative Mind (1953), including James Fenimore Cooper, Nathaniel Hawthorne, James Russell Lowell, W. H. Mallock, Robert Frost and T. S. Eliot. In Kirk's The Conservative Reader (1982), the writings of Rudyard Kipling and Phyllis McGinley are featured as examples of literary traditionalism. Kirk was also known himself as a writer of supernatural and suspense fiction with a distinct Gothic flair. Novels such as Old House of Fear, A Creature of the Twilight and Lord of the Hollow Dark and short stories such as \\"Lex Talionis\\", \\"Lost Lake\\", \\"Beyond the Stumps\\", \\"Ex Tenebris\\" and \\"Fate's Purse\\" gained praise from fiction writers such as Ray Bradbury and Madeleine L'Engle. Kirk was also good friends with many literary figures of the 20th century, namely T. S. Eliot, Roy Campbell, Wyndham Lewis, Ray Bradbury, Madeleine L'Engle and Flannery O'Connor, most of whom could be labeled traditionalist in their poetry or fiction. The British novelist and traditionalist Catholic Evelyn Waugh is often considered a traditionalist conservative.

The school serves about 1,882 students in grades 9 to 12. History Angelo Rodriguez High School is the newest and smallest of the three main high schools in Fairfield, California. The school is named after Angelo Rodriguez, a local English teacher who had drowned off the coast of Spain in 1986 after rescuing two children. This school has been recognized as a California Distinguished School and a National School of Excellence. The school is encompassed into the Fairfield-Suisun Unified School District (FSUSD), which includes several other area high schools, junior high schools, and elementary schools. Their athletic teams are known as the Mustangs and the school colors are green, white, and black. The school was established in the year 2001, with only freshman and sophomore classes. These students continued instruction at the school for their junior and senior years. By the 2003-04 academic year, the school was offering instruction for students grades 9-12. The class of 2004 was the first graduating class. The class of 2005 was the first graduating class to begin their education at the school as freshmen. Campus The campus is smaller than the other Fairfield-Suisun Unified School District high schools. It contains the first school building in Fairfield with two stories, consequently including 4 staircases leading up to the second-story classrooms and an elevator for the handicapped. The campus also includes a theatre for high school productions that was built in a former auto garage by Nathan Day, the school's former theatre teacher. In the 2005-06 academic year, the school built their own track, allowing the physical education classes to run and use it. In the year 2006-2007, work began on the Ed Hopkins football stadium, which was not completed until the year 2007-08. The stadium was put to use on September 24, 2007, for a match against Fairfield High School. A pool was completed in the summer of 2008 to allow for aquatic sports.

The Union Navy placed her into service as a ship's tender, whose task was to serve the fleet blockading the Confederate States of America. However, she was outfitted with a powerful rifled gun, which helped her in the role of gunboat and the capture of a prize on her own.  Captured and acquired by the Union Navy  Fox, a schooner, was built in 1859 at Baltimore, Maryland; used as a blockade runner by the Confederates under the name Alabama; captured 18 April 1863 by Susquehanna; purchased from the prize court 6 May 1863; renamed Fox, her former merchant name; and first put to sea 10 June 1863, Acting Master A. Weston in command.  Civil War operations  = Serving as tender with the East Gulf Blockade = Assigned to the East Gulf Blockading Squadron, Fox sailed out of Key West, Florida, throughout the remainder of the war. Her primary duty was as tender to the ordnance ship Dale and other large ships, but in her patrols alone and with the squadron, she shared in the capture of several blockade runners sailing out of Havana, Cuba. Sailing alone, on 20 December 1863 she discovered a side wheel steamer grounded at the mouth of the Suwannee River, and after firing on her, sent a boarding party which found the steamer's crew had fled. Finding the engine room flooded and the job of getting the steamer off beyond her limited capacity, Fox burned her to prevent her further use by the Confederates. = Winning prizes on her own = Four days later, again sailing alone, Fox encountered a British schooner from Havana in the Suwannee River, and after firing several shells, boarded her and took her prize. On 18 April 1864, Fox chased a British schooner until the schooner's crew ran her aground and abandoned her. A party from Fox boarded and burned the blockade runner. Again she took a prize singlehanded on 1 May, when she apprehended a sloop running the blockade off Cape Romano, Florida. Her first prize in 1865, taken 23 January, was another British blockade runner out of Havana. On 12 March, Fox chased a schooner ashore in Deadman's Bay. The blockade runner's crew set her afire, but part of her cargo of cavalry sabers and farming equipment was saved from the flames by Fox's boarding party. Several times during these years boat parties from Fox destroyed valuable salt works ashore, such expeditions combining with her captures to make hers a most significant role in the total effort to cut the Confederacy off from key supplies. Detached from duty 1 June 1865, Fox was sold 28 June 1865.

Merrie Melodies cartoon directed by Bob Clampett. The short was released on June 9, 1945, and stars Tweety. This is the last Tweety film directed by Clampett, following 1942's A Tale of Two Kitties and 1944's Birdy and the Beast, and the last one before he is permanently paired with Sylvester. One of the cats in this cartoon is a caricature of the comedian Jimmy Durante. Plot The cartoon opens up with two cats (a couple) talking/singing in meows (set to the tune of the 1909 pop tune Me-ow). Then we see a red cat (a caricature of Jimmy Durante) who hits a yellow cat with a frying pan while the yellow cat is talking to the female cat. Then the red cat tries to get the girl to kiss him. As he tries to kiss her, out of nowhere an insane dog (who admits that he \\"doesn't actually belong in this picture\\") pops up and kisses the female cat, prompting the Durante cat to exclaim that \\"Everybody wants to get into the act. Umbriago! IT'S DISGUSTING!\\" As the two cats fight, the female tells them whoever can bring her a bird can be her \\"fella\\". Then the red cat uses numerous tricks to stop the yellow cat. Then we see the cats climbing up the pole. Tweety states his usual catchphrase \\"I tawt I taw a putty tat\\" followed by \\"I tawt I taw ANOTHER putty tat\\". Then both cats realize that the other one is up with them and they fight and Tweety hits them with a mallet causing them to fall off the pole; then Tweety states \\"Aw, the poor puddy tats! They fall down and go BOOM!\\" (on the word BOOM, Tweety yells at the top of his lungs) and smiles. Then the red cat wakes up, and so does the yellow but the yellow gets hit by a frying pan again. Then the cats fight again and the red cat realizes that they must use strategy (which the Durante cat pronounces \\"stragedy\\"). Then the red cat comes up with a plan. We then see them in an unrealistic horse costume and the red cat states that he is the head. Then Tweety pops out of the tail and grabs a bee. As he slaps it he puts it in the horse costume and hits the costume and the cats get stung and crash into a tree. Then the red cat comes up with another plan. But then Tweety lures a dog to attack the cats by grabbing its bone and putting it into the cat's costume and the cats get attacked; then Tweety says \\"You know I get wid of more putty tats that way!\\" then does the Durante \\"hot cha cha cha\\" as the film irises out.

Additionally he held the titles of vice chairman of the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council and Vice President of Iraq. Early life Hardan was born in 1925 in Tikrit. His father was a police officer, a Sunni Arab and a member of the tribe of Al-Shiyasha. Air Force and Baath Party As an officer in the Iraqi Air Force, he was educated at the flight academy in Baghdad and was commissioned as a Flying Officer in 1946. In 1961, Hardan joined the Baath Party and he played a key role in both the 1963 and 1968 revolutions in Iraq. By the start of 1963, Hardan was the commander of the Iraqi Air Force base near Mosul. On 8 March 1963, with the Baath Party fighting to gain control of Syria, Hardan ordered an air attack on the part of the Syrian air base at Aleppo that was in the hands of supporters of the old government. However, whilst the strike aircraft were en route, the Syrian Baathists took the air base and the attack was cancelled. During the period in 1963 when the Baathists were in power in Iraq, Hardan was appointed as commander of the entire Iraqi Air Force. However, when the President Abdul Salam Arif withdrew his support from the Baath Party in late 1963, Hardan followed suit. Hardan then relinquished his command and was appointed Defence Minister in which capacity he served from November 1963 until March 1964. Role in the 1963 February coup d‚Äôetat Prior to the coup, Hardan came together with other major political figures in the Ba‚Äôth Party and Nationalist officers to carry out the plans made for the change in government. Military officials felt that too many civilians and important leaders had been wrongfully killed under Abd al-Karim Qasim, the current President. Qasim has also aligned himself with some of the Communist militia who was imposing violence on citizens of Iraq. Key players in this coup attempt included Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, Salih Mahdi Ammash, Abd al-Sattar, Abd al-Latif, Mundhir al- Wandawi, Makki al-Hashimi, TahirYahya, and Hardan al-Tikriti.Farouk-Sluglett, Marion, and Peter Sluglett. Iraq Since 1958: From Revolution to Dictatorship. New York: I. B. Tauris, 2001. Print. (pg 84, 93, 119) Abd al-Karim Qasim was to be removed from his position in office and to do this the communist commander of the Air Force, Jalal al-Awqati, had to be killed. They also believed that the capture of Qasim and his sentencing to death was necessary for the transfer of power to take place.Tripp, Charles. A History of Iraq. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2007. Print. ( Pg 163, 165, 168- 169, 178-179, 184-185) On 8 February after Qasim‚Äôs seat was captured by members of the coup, he was killed and his body was displayed on television for all of Iraq to see. Abd al-Salam Arif was the person placed into the Presidential seat by the National Command of the Revolutionary Council (NCRC) after the February 8th events. He appointed Ahmad Hasan al-Bakr, a devoted Ba‚Äôthists, to be his vice president and Ali Salih al-Sa‚Äôdi as his Minister of the Interior. Although Abd al-Salam Arif was the President, al-Sa‚Äôdi managed to maintain most power among the three because he was the leader of the Ba‚Äôthist Party at the time. Bakr was also a member of the Ba‚Äôth Party; Arif, on the other hand, was not. The government setup with Arif, Sa‚Äôdi, and Bakr had no firm foundation because of the way that these men assumed their positions (the coup) of power. There was also an inability to find stability and common agreement among the three men. Opposing views began to surface as a result of unresolved opinions regarding the direction of the state of Iraq and an imbalance of power between Arif, Bakr, and Sa‚Äôdi. On 18 November 1963 Hardan would once again assist in a power transfer, this time it was in collusion with the current President of Iraq, Abd al-Salam Arif. Arif wanted to regain control of the state that was handed to him by the NCRC so he brought Hardan and General Tahir Yahya together to launch an attack on the National Guard currently residing in Baghdad. Arif managed to regain his control over the state after the attack also making the decision to remove Sa‚Äôdi from the government because he had become a threat to Arif and the Iraqi people. Sa‚Äôdi was accused of attempts to spread Socialism throughout the state corrupting the government setup that Arif had in play. On November 11, after being asked to step down from his position in government as Minister of Interior, Sa‚Äôdi refused and went on with his plans to attend the Extraordinary Regional Conference. At the conference he planned to have Hardan al-Tikriti, along with others who threatened his power and intentions, removed from their political positions. Instead Sa‚Äôdi was met by the National Guard who arrested him and the rest of his supporters, forcing them onto a plane set to leave the state and land in Madrid. Role in the July 1968 coup d‚Äôetat Hardan played the major role in this coup by delivering the final blow. During the 1968 coup, in the early hours of 17 July 1968, Hardan telephoned the sitting Prime Minister Abdul Rahman Arif to inform him that he had been removed from office. Hardan then escorted Arif to the airport where the deposed Prime Minister was flown out of the country.Rautsi, Inari, and Efraim Karsh. Saddam Hussein: A Political Biography.

During his time as Defence Minister, Hardan was instrumental in securing large-scale military aid for Iraq from the Soviet Union. Although Hardan was promoted in office, there was still one remaining man ahead of him with the power to control him ‚Äì Sa‚Äôdun Ghaidan. In order to change this, Hardan needed to gain the favor of Ghaidan, which he managed to do with the help of Hasan al-Bakr. Ghaidan decided to join the two members of the Ba‚Äôthist Party by helping overthrow al-Dawud and his Republican Guard. After that was done, the Ba‚Äôthist Party was fully restored to power in Iraq on July 30, 1968.Tripp, Charles. A History of Iraq. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2007. Print. (Pg 163, 165, 168‚Äì169, 178‚Äì179, 184-185) With Hasan al-Bakr assuming the position as the President of Iraq, Hardan as the Defence Minister and Premier Deputy, and Salih Mahdi Ammash as the Minister of Interior, the Ba‚Äôthist regime was on its way to successfully controlling the country.Farouk-Sluglett, Marion, and Peter Sluglett. Iraq Since 1958: From Revolution to Dictatorship. New York: I. B. Tauris, 2001. Print. (pg 84, 93, 119) After some time in their respective offices, the men began to grow concerned with each man‚Äôs next move. Ammash, Bakr, and Hardan al-Tikriti had helped each other make their way to the top with the 1968 coup. The positions they held in government were very powerful and each one of them was only looking for a way to increase that power and extend his control and influence within the government. Hasan al-Bakr had managed to gain the support of Saddam Hussein, who helped boost his own career and popularity, placing him a few steps above Ammash and Hardan. Saddam needed a way into a higher position in government. Because he didn‚Äôt have a strong military background, it would have been a little harder for him to gain power. He thought strategically that Bakr was his key to that power. He aligned himself with Bakr by supporting his policies. Slowly he started to work through Bakr, making him his puppet. By aligning himself with Hasan al-Bakr and other powerful figures within the state, he was in a safety zone. In order to keep making advancements, Saddam had to recognize that most of the power in the state lay within the hands of military forces and the men controlling it; those men happened to have been Bakr, Hardan, and Ammash.Aburish, Said K. Saddam Hussein: The Politics of Revenge. New York: Bloomsbury, 2000. Print. (pg. 85) Since Saddam had already aligned himself with Bakr, the only two threats remaining were Hardan and Ammash. Both men also recognized the threat that Saddam posed to their careers. Hardan was the biggest political challenge because the military had become his stronghold where he controlled almost all if not everything that concerned the military.Coughlin, Con:. Saddam: King of Terror. New York: HarperCollins Publishers, 2002. Print. (pg 86) Fall from power and assassination Because Hardan recognized what Saddam Hussein‚Äôs intentions had been, he started to set up a strategy of his own. In 1969 Hardan tried to show his power and authority by convincing Bakr to send Saddam into exile for having questioned his power and motives in front of the council. Saddam was sent away on a plane just as several other exiled Iraqis in the past had been but he was to return just one week later with vengeance in his heart. After having returned to Iraq, Saddam set out to destroy Hardan right away. First he had his Deputy Premier Position taken away by merging the title into the president‚Äôs position. Saddam did this by simply convincing Bakr that Hardan was after his presidential seat. Listening to what Saddam suggested, Bakr started to implement a plan that would strip Hardan of actual controlling power. Hardan al-Tikriti was soon given the position as Vice President but this meant nothing because he no longer had the power to control cabinet meetings. Finally on 15 October 1970 Hardan was dismissed from all positions he carried because he was accused of disregarding efforts of the Ba'thist Party to help the Arabs. These posts included the Minister of Defence and Deputy Premier of Iraq. He was also dismissed from the Revolutionary Command Council. The charge against him meant that he wasn‚Äôt helping the Ba‚Äôth live up to their oath to help protect the Palestinians. This charge was based on his opposition to Saddam Hussein‚Äôs plans to use an Iraqi brigade located in Jordan to support Palestinians against the Jordanian government in the Black September uprising.Michael K. Beauchamp, in: The Encyclopedia of Middle East Wars. ABC-CLIO, 2010. p. 1241. Hardan was later sent into exile and like all others he was put on a plane and flown out of the state. He was sent to Madrid initially. He returned weeks later to Iraq to try to clear his record. However, he was unsuccessful and was turned around right away and sent to Algeria to be the Iraqi Ambassador. He wasn‚Äôt accepted there so he later left. After a period of exile in London, Hardan was appointed as Iraqi Ambassador to Sweden. However, Hardan disliked being away from the Iraqi political scene and he travelled to Kuwait from where he attempted to organize a coup against Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr and Saddam Hussein. On 30 March 1971, Hardan was assassinated on the orders of Saddam Hussein in Kuwait.Rautsi, Inari, and Efraim Karsh. Saddam Hussein: A Political Biography. New York City: Free Press, 1991. Print.

A pioneer of applied behavior analysis, he developed errorless learning and was a colleague of B.F. Skinner's at Harvard University, co-authoring the book Schedules of Reinforcement (1957). Career Ferster received his bachelor's degree at Rutgers University in 1947 followed by his Master's in 1948 and Ph.D. in 1958 from Columbia University. He then worked as a colleague with B. F. Skinner at Harvard University, where they established the Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior in 1958. While at Harvard, he devised errorless learning to train animals, and used other forms of what was then termed behavior modification for clients with depression and obesity. While serving as an assistant professor of psychology at Indiana University School of Medicine from 1957 to 1962, Ferster employed errorless learning to instruct young autistic children how to speak. Ferster's research also influenced the work of other pioneers of behavioral research, such as Donald M. Baer and Sidney Bijou, who together founded the Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis at the University of Kansas. Another well-known researcher was Ivar Lovaas, who applied Ferster's procedures to autistic children at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and developed early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI), or 6.5 hours per day of what he called, \\"discrete trial training\\" (DTT).

Accreditation and membership CROEM was founded in the 1967‚Äì1968 school year, and was academically adopted in the 1990‚Äì1991 school year by the University of Puerto Rico Mayag√ºez Campus. In the 1992‚Äì1993 school year CROEM was inscribed in the Specialized School Unit of the Puerto Rico Department of Education. That same year, in its silver anniversary, it obtained the Blue Ribbon Award, an award of excellence granted by the US Department of Education. The school is accredited by the General Council of Education of Puerto Rico every six years. Admissions The admissions process is available to students from across Puerto Rico and is open for the 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th grades. As part of the process of admission, the prospective students must meet some requirements, such as: a standardized test, several letters of recommendation and a GPA higher than 3.50. The school only accepts approximately 300 students per year. Location View from CROEM towards the Caribbean Sea The center is located in State Road 349, km 6.6 of Cerro Las Mesas in Mayag√ºez, Puerto Rico. It has a panoramic view of 360 degrees where the municipalities of Cabo Rojo, Hormigueros, San Germ√°n and Lajas can be appreciated, as well as the Caribbean Sea. Due to the high altitude and distance from urban centers, CROEM students are not allowed to leave the center on their own. The convenience of the location is such that it has been used by Federal programs such as The Globe Program. Town Fair The Fair celebrated its 40th anniversary on March 3, 2008, having been founded in 1968, and their 50th anniversary in 2018.

The band had a large following in Ontario. Brian MacLeod was spotted by promoter Martin Onrot while Stingaree was playing in Toronto and left the band to join Chilliwack. The remaining members of Stingaree played for another six months before disbanding in 1978. Jones also played bass on the 1981 hit \\"Dream Away\\" by LaBarge.

Their name approximates to \\"Wrekin-dwellers\\". It is also suggested that Wrexham also derived from Wreocens√¶te. The literal meaning of Wrocensaete is 'those dwelling at Wrocen'. N.J. Higham interprets this as referring to Wroxeter, the former civitas of the Cornovii, which became the centre of government of this early sub-Roman kingdom which was the successor territorial unit to Cornovia. He states that, 'It may refer quite specifically to the royal court itself, in the first instance, and only by extension to the territory administered from the court.' The hillfort on the Wrekin has to date produced no archaeological evidence of Roman, sub-Roman or Anglo-Saxon settlement. The name Wrocensaete was long in use, first occurring in the Tribal Hidage (a tribute list which is normally dated to the seventh century) and was last documented as Wreocensetun, a province or district of Mercia in which the Vikings were reported to be active in 855. Wreocens√¶te in Mercia The boundaries of the kingdom are uncertain, but it was substantial as the Tribal Hidage lists it as 7000 hides, equal to the kingdoms of the East Saxons and South Saxons. The evidence suggests that the Wrekinset were the most northerly of the three large Mercian subject kingdoms facing Wales, with the Magons√¶te to their south, and the Hwicce farthest south. The chief place was seemingly the former Roman Viroconium Cornoviorum (modern Wroxeter), the former civitas of the Cornovii and close to the hill fort known as The Wrekin. The kingdom may have covered much of modern Cheshire, Shropshire and into North East Wales, Wrexham, Denbighshire and Flintshire. The border between Wales and Wreocens√¶te would have been Offa's Dyke. As with the neighbouring Magons√¶te, the lands of the Wreocens√¶te appear to have included a number of lesser tribes or kingdoms. Place-names suggest that the much smaller Meres√¶te and Rhiws√¶te lay within the lands of the Wreocens√¶te. These, and the more southerly examples in Magons√¶te, appear to be spaced regularly along the line of the frontier with Wales, and it is suggested that they may be artificial in origin, created by a king of Mercia to delineate and defend that border.

He is currently a Circuit Judge for the 39th Judicial Circuit, which consists of Stone, Barry, and Lawrence counties.  Biography  Jack Goodman grew up in Pierce City, Missouri, and graduated from Pierce City High School in 1991. He attended the University of Missouri, where he earned his bachelor's degree in Philosophy in 1995 and his juris doctorate in 1998. After graduating from law school, Sen. Goodman served as an assistant prosecuting attorney for Dade County, Missouri until 2002, when he was elected to his first term in the Missouri House. Then- Representative Goodman represented the 132nd District, covering almost all of Lawrence County. During his three-year House tenure, Sen. Goodman rose in the House ranks to serve as the Assistant Majority Floor Leader. In the summer of 2005, Senator Larry \\"Gene\\" Taylor died less than one year into his first term in the Missouri Senate. Jack Goodman was nominated by the Republican Party to run in the special election to succeed Sen. Taylor. In his first race for the Missouri Senate, Goodman was elected to serve the remainder of that term ending in 2009, beating his Democratic opponent by 35 points . In the 2008 election, Senator Goodman ran for a second term in the Missouri Senate. No candidate of any party chose to challenge him in his reelection bid. The 29th District, which he represents, includes McDonald, Lawrence, Barry, Stone, Taney and Ozark counties. Sen. Goodman also represents Branson. In addition to his duties as Assistant Majority Leader, Sen. Goodman chairs the General Laws committee. He also serves as vice-chair of the Judiciary committee and is a member of the Job, Economic Development, and Local Government; Small Business, Insurance and Industry; and the Select Committee on Oversight of the Federal Stimulus. On the Stimulus Oversight Committee, Sen. Goodman serves as the majority party's point man on stimulus dollars allocated for judicial and law enforcement issues. In early 2009, U.S. Congressman Roy Blunt announced he would run for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by the retirement of Senator Christopher \\"Kit\\" Bond. Blunt's announcement leaves a vacancy in Missouri's 7th Congressional district in 2010. Senator Jack Goodman has announced his candidacy for the seat and is often mentioned as a leading contender to succeed Rep. Blunt . He currently lives in Mount Vernon, Missouri with his wife, Laura, and two sons, Jack Elliott and William True Goodman. Major Legislation During his time in office, Sen. Goodman sponsored several high- profile bills that have gained national attention. Sen. Goodman was the author of Missouri's Castle Doctrine, which allows homeowners to use lethal force against illegal intruders. The Stop Meth Act was also signed into law and gives law enforcement officials a wider range of tools to respond to the growing domestic production of methamphetamine. In the 2008 legislative session, Sen. Goodman sponsored Senate Bill 1194, which would allow prosecutors to seek the death penalty for criminals convicted of forcible rape of a child under twelve years of age. This issue had gained national attention since the Supreme Court heard Kennedy v. Louisiana (2008). In 2009, Sen. Goodman introduced an altered version of that bill, which would give life imprisonment without the possibility of parole to any person convicted of forcible rape of a child under twelve years of age. Congressional Campaign Senator Goodman announced on February 27, 2009 his intention to run for the United States Congress seat then held by Congressman Roy Blunt.\\"Goodman running for Blunt's House\\" February 27, 2009 Goodman finished second in polling behind eventual winner Billy Long with 30,401 votes and 29.1%.

Yeruham Zeisel was born in 1909 in Tarnov, Galicia, (then Austria-Hungary, today Poland). Zeisel was raised in a Zionist home, and already in his youth was a member of Hashomer Hatzair and a counselor for a group of youths in the \\"Pioneer\\" movement. In 1932 he made Aliyah and joined kibbutz Ein HaMifratz. He also worked as a porter in the Post of Haifa, and worked in the digging of fish pools in the area of the swamps of the Ne'eman Valley. In 1933, Zeisel moved to Haifa, and began work as an electrician for the Israel Electric Corporation. Zeisel was a member of the Haganah, and served as the metalworkers secretary. In 1936, he moved to Kiryat Chaim. Zeisel was elected to the Haifa city council in 1961, and eight years later, in 1969, he was elected to the position of vice-mayor. Due to the illness of then-mayor Moshe Flimann, Zeisel was appointed substitute mayor. With Flimann's subsequent death, Zeisel remained in office, and served in that capacity until the election of Yosef Almogi in 1974. Almog's term didn't last long: in 1975 he was chosen to be the chairman of the Jewish Agency and the Histadrut. It was then that Zeisel was elected as mayor of Haifa, and he served until 1978. During his time in office, construction of the promenade in Bat Galim began. In 1979, Zeisel was chosen to serve as the head of the secondary council of Kiriyat Chaim; he held that post until the day he died.

Black River Improvement Co., 113 U.S. 81 (1885), was a writ of error in the circuit court of Wisconsin for La Crosse County, and a motion was made to dismiss it.. The first ground of the motion was that the writ should have been directed to the supreme court of the state instead of to the circuit court of the county. The circuit court denied the relief and dismissed the bill. On appeal, the supreme court of the state reversed this judgment and delivered an opinion that plaintiff was entitled to relief in the premises; It was claimed that the writ of error was not brought within the statute of limitations, and although the writ of error was dated the tenth day of May 1884, and was noted by the clerk as having been filed on that day, it was also marked by the clerk of the circuit court of La Crosse county, as filed on the twenty-ninth day of that month. Since it was not disputed that this was the day it was filed in his office, it was held that this was the date on which the writ of error was brought. The courts of Wisconsin kept a book called a judgment docket containing the names of plaintiffs who recovered judgment, the defendants against whom they are recovered, the amount of the principal judgment, the costs, and the date of the judgment itself. This record is kept for the convenience of parties who seek information as to liens on real estate or for other purposes. This docket is made up after the main judgment is settled and entered in the order-book, or record of the court's proceedings, and it may be many days before this abstract of the judgment is made in the judgment docket, according to the convenience of the clerk. This record of the court's proceedings constitutes the evidence of the judgment, and the statute of limitations begins to run from that date. The writ of error in this case was brought five days after the two years allowed by law had expired and was thus dismissed.

He was imprisoned by the Russian authorities because of his Zionist activities, but was released a short time after his arrest. After completing high school, he went to Moscow to study electrical engineering. In 1929 he was imprisoned because of his continued participation in Zionist organizations, and was sent to Siberia to serve a three-year sentence. However, in 1930, his sentence was shortened; he was banished from the U.S.S.R. and then emigrated to Palestine. After emigrating to Palestine, he worked in the \\"Stein\\" factory in Yafo, and subsequently as an electrician, until he found work as a teacher of physics and math in Tel Aviv. He only taught for a short time, however, as he soon began working as an electrician in a quarry in Atlit. In 1932, he was accepted to work for the Israel Electric Corporation. By 1957, he had been promoted to the manager of the national grid, and was elected to the board of the company as a representative of the workers. Flimann lived in Kiryat Haim, and was a member of the city council there. After Kiryat Haim became part of the city of Haifa, he became a member of the Haifa municipal council. In 1959 he was elected deputy mayor. In 1959, after the death of his predecessor Abba Hushi, he became mayor and served in this office from 1969 until 1973. During his tenure, the Israeli National Maritime Museum in Haifa was established. Also during his time in office, the Dan and Nof hotels in Mercaz Ha-Carmel were established. Likewise, the building of the Haifa nursing hospital began during his tenure, and upon its completion, which was after his death, it was named after him.

Most of the sex scenes are fogged.Motion Picture Purgatory: Entrails of a Virgin (Shojo no harawata)  Cast  * Saeko Kizuki as Rei * Naomi Hagio as Kazuyo * Megumi Kawashima as Kei * Osamu Tsuruoka as Itomura * Daiki Kat√¥ as Asaoka * Hideki Takahashi as Tachikawa * Kazuhiko Goda as A murderer  Critical reception  In his Asia Shock; Horror and Dark Cinema from Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, and Thailand, Patrick Galloway says that Komizu's mix of sex and horror works as a film. He describes the film as \\"essentially one long fuck-fest interspersed with the occasional impaling, hanging or beheading...\\" and concludes, \\"It's all rather sordid and there's a definite misanthropy to the film reminiscent of Henri-Georges Clouzot (Diabolique), but somehow the elements click into place, making for an uncomfortable-yet-can't-look-away film experience.\\"  Release  Along with its sequel, Entrails of a Beautiful Woman, Entrails of a Virgin became a notorious example of the low-quality blackmarket VHS copies which American enthusiasts traded in the 1980s. These copies usually had no English subtitles. The film was released on DVD first on the Japan Shock label in PAL format, and then by Synapse Films in NTSC. The Synapse release was a restored, widescreen version.  Production  During the 1980s, slasher film-makers had begun adding increasing amounts of sexuality into their movies. Working in the pink film genre, director Kazuo \\"Gaira\\" Komizu decided to inject elements of horror into these softcore pornographic productions. The film became a box-office success.  Sequel  One of a series of three by director Kazuo \\"Gaira\\" Komizu, the other two were the considerably more graphic and hardcore Entrails of a Beautiful Woman (1986), as well as Female Inquisitor (1987).

The research facility provided synchrotron radiation to a large number of experimental stations and had an operating cost of approximately ¬£20 million per annum. SRS had been operated by the Science and Technology Facilities Council. The SRS was closed on 4 August 2008 after 28 years of operation. History Following the closure of the NINA synchrotron, construction of the facility commenced in 1975 and the first experiments were completed using the facility by 1981. In 1986 the storage was upgraded with additional focusing to increase the output brightness, the new 'lattice' being termed the HBL (High Brightness Lattice). Design and evolution Like all second-generation sources, the SRS was designed to produce synchrotron radiation principally from its dipole magnets, but the initial design foresaw the use of a high-field insertion device to provide shorter-wavelength electromagnetic radiation to particular users. The first storage ring design was a 2 GeV FODO lattice consisting of alternating focussing and defocussing quadrupoles, with one dipole following every quadrupole (i.e. two dipoles per repeating cell), giving a natural beam emittance of around 1000 nm-rad with 16 cells. The HBL upgrade implemented in 1986 increased the total number of quadrupoles to 32, whilst retaining the same number of cells and geometry, and reduced the operating emittance to around 100 nm-rad in the so-called 'HIQ' (high tune) configuration. A 'LOQ' (low tune) configuration was also provided, to allow the efficient storage of one intense bunch of electrons (instead of up to 160), to provide radiation bursts at 3.123 MHz (the revolution frequency of the electrons, corresponding to the 96 m circumference).  Scientific Output and Achievements  The SRS supported a broad range of science, including pioneering work on X-ray diffraction, structural molecular biology, surface physics and chemistry, materials science and upper atmosphere physics. Following its closure, a detailed study of the economic impact of the SRS was made. Two Nobel Prizes in Chemistry have been received by scientists who performed part of their prize- winning research using the SRS: Sir John E. Walker in 1997 for his contribution to the understanding of the synthesis of ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate), a key component of the body‚Äôs energy transport, and Sir Venki Ramakrishnan for his work on the structure and function of the Ribosome, the molecular machine that constructs proteins from ‚Äòinstructions‚Äô coded in mRNA. Over 5000 academic papers were produced.

Two Sisters was put into service as a gunboat and, when required, as a ship's tender, by the Union Navy to patrol navigable waterways of the Confederacy to prevent the South from trading with other countries.  Captured and acquired by the Union Navy  Two Sisters, a schooner built in 1856 at Baltimore, Maryland, was captured on 21 September 1862 by Union steamer off the mouth of the Rio Grande while attempting to slip through the Federal blockade to Brownsville, Texas, with a cargo of 87 bales of gunny cloth needed by the Confederacy for baling cotton. Subsequently-purchased by the Navy from the Prize Court at Key West, Florida, Two Sisters was commissioned on 30 January 1863 at Key West, Acting Master William A. Arthur in command.

On 30 April, the Union schooner captured cotton-carrying blockade runner Agnes off the Tortugas, before taking schooner Oliver S. Breese off Anclote Keys, Florida. Two Sisters continued her patrols on the blockade through the spring, summer, and early fall, keeping a wary eye on the route between Bayport, Florida, and Havana, Cuba. On 15 October, she, , and assisted in the capture of the Havana- bound British steamer Mail, which had attempted to run the blockade laden with cotton and turpentine.

The Union schooner's patrol duty was broken in May by service as tender to steam frigate . She then resumed independent blockade service through the onset of winter. On 3 December 1864, Two Sisters participated in an early amphibious- type operation. Her boats and crews joined others from , , and , all under the command of Acting Lt. Robert B.

It was last assigned to the 315th Bombardment Wing, being stationed at Northwest Field, Guam. It was inactivated on 15 April 1946. During World War II, the unit was initially a B-17 Flying Fortress and B-24 Liberator operational training unit (OTU). Redesignated as a replacement training unit (RTU) in December 1943. Inactivated on 1 April 1944 when Second Air Force switched to B-29 Superfortress training. Late in the war the group was reactivated and trained as a Very Heavy (VH) B-29 Superfortress group The group served in the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II as part of Twentieth Air Force. The 331st Bomb Group's aircraft engaged in very heavy bombardment B-29 Superfortress operations against Japan. History =Heavy bomber replacement training= The 331st Bombardment Group was first activated in July 1942 at Salt Lake City Army Air Base, Utah with the 461st, 462d, 463d and 464th Bombardment Squadrons assigned. In September it moved to Casper Army Air Field, where it conducted Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress replacement training until 1943, when it converted to the Consolidated B-24 Liberator. Replacement training units were oversized units which trained aircrews prior to their deployment to combat theaters.Craven & Cate, Introduction, p. xxxvi However, the Army Air Forces found that standard military units, based on relatively inflexible tables of organization, were not proving to be well adapted to the training mission. Accordingly, it adopted a more functional system in which each base was organized into a separate numbered unit,Goss, p. 75 while the groups and squadrons acting as replacement training units were disbanded or inactivated.Maurer, Combat Units, p. 7 This resulted in the 331st, along with other units at Casper, being inactivated in the spring of 1944 and being replaced by the 211th AAF Base Unit (Combat Crew Training Station, Heavy), which assumed the 331st Group's mission, personnel, and equipment.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 568Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 568‚Äì569Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 569‚Äì570Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 570‚Äì571 Bell-Atlanta B-29B-60-BA Superfortress \\"Pacusan Dreamboat\\" (44-84061) =Very heavy bomber operations= Redesignated 331st Bombardment Group (Very Heavy). Activated on 12 July 1944 at Dalhart AAFld, Texas. Assigned to Second Air Force. Trained for combat with B-29B's initially at Dalhart, then to McCook AAFld, Nebraska. The 331st was assigned the B-29B model. This model was built at Bell-Atlanta. The B-29B was a limited production aircraft, built solely by Bell-Atlanta. It had all but the tail defensive armament removed, since experience had shown that by 1944 the only significant Japanese fighter attacks were coming from the rear. The tail gun was aimed and fired automatically by the new AN/APG-15B radar fire control system that detected the approaching enemy plane and made all the necessary calculations. The elimination of the turrets and the associated General Electric computerized gun system increased the top speed of the Superfortress to 364 mph at 25,000 feet and made the B-29B suitable for fast, unescorted hit-and-run bombing raids and photographic missions. Moved to Northwest Field, Guam, April‚ÄìJune 1945, and assigned to the 315th Bomb Wing, Twentieth Air Force. Bombed Japanese-held Truk late in June 1945. Flew first mission against the Japanese home islands on 9 July 1945 and afterward operated principally against the enemy's petroleum industry on Honsh≈´. Despite the hazards of bad weather, fighter attacks, and heavy flak, the 331st bombed the coal liquefaction plant at Ube, the Mitsubishi-Hayama petroleum complex at Kawasaki, and the oil refinery and storage facilities at Shimotsu, in July and August 1945, and received a Distinguished Unit Citation for the missions. After the war the group dropped food and supplies to Allied prisoners of war in Japan. Inactivated on Guam on 15 April 1946. =Hurricane Ike (2008)= The unit was reactivated at Randolph AFB, Texas, in 2008 as the 331st Air Expeditionary Group, a special unit formed to support Hurricane Ike relief efforts. Units and personnel assigned to the 331st came from both the active and reserve components of the Air Force and Navy.

It was designed and manufactured by Barrett Firearms Company. In 1995, Barrett stopped production of the M90, and replaced it with the M95. Summary The M90 was designed and produced from 1990 to 1995 as a bolt-action alternative to the semi-automatic Barrett M82. It was a bolt- action rifle in a bullpup design. The weapon featured a fluted barrel with integrated muzzle brake, 2 part receiver (upper and lower), folding bipod, and a 5-round detachable box magazine. The M90 had no iron sights, but instead had a Picatinny rail for the mounting of a scope. Overview The Barrett M90 is a BMG .50 caliber bolt-action sniper rifle. The rifle was produced by Barrett Firearms Company in 1990 until 1995. The Barrett M90 is the alternative bolt- action version to the Barrett M82A1, which is the semi-automatic counterpart. The Barrett M90 has a bullpup design, making the rifle a more compact version of a BMG .50 caliber. The bullpup design made the gun more civilian-friendly in its usage. Barrett Firearms initially created the Barrett M90 to attract consumers who were seeking to find a bolt-action .50 caliber. Unlike the larger semi-automatic Barrett M82A1, the Barrett M90 is compact, has a fluted muzzle to reduce recoil, and has a special picatinny rail in order to mount a different variety of scopes. The Barrett M90, like other Barrett rifles, incorporates the picatinny rail instead of iron sights due its larger caliber. The gun was originally used for civilian long-range division shooters incorporating them into competition style shooting. The Barrett M90 is very light in comparison to the Barrett M82A1. This was due to its smaller, more compact design.Books, H. (2011). Articles on Barrett Firearms Company, Including: Barrett Firearms Manufacturing, Barrett Xm109, Barrett M82, Barrett M98, Ronnie Barrett, Barrett M95, Barrett Rec7, Barrett M99, .416 Barrett, Barrett M90, Barrett Xm500, Barrett M98b. Charleston, South Carolina: BiblioBazaar. Design and history With its smaller design came more technological advancements in order to add to effectiveness and adaptation to the smaller design. The Barrett M90‚Äôs barrel has the same length as the Barrett M82A1. Due to it being a bolt-action rifle other than its semi- automatic counterpart, it uses three large lugs that are locked into the barrel to improve its overall sturdiness to handle a BMG .50 caliber round. The Barrett M90 uses a muzzle brake to redirect propellant gases to reduce recoil and rising of the gun during rapid firing. The gun has a two-chamber muzzle brake, same as the gun‚Äôs counterpart M82A1 and its future replacement, the Barrett M95. The Barrett M90 isn‚Äôt affected very much from rising due to it being a bolt action. Muzzle brakes are very effective in combat and competition use because it adds to the accuracy of the weapon.Michaelis, D. (2000). The complete .50-caliber sniper course hard-target interdiction. Boulder, Colo.: Paladin Press. The Barrett M90 uses a muzzle brake due to its high caliber as with any other high caliber gun as well, alongside artillery guns.Long, D. (1988). Modern sniper rifles. Boulder, Colo.: Paladin Press. The Barrett M90 is composed of stamped sheet steel to add to its durability and reduced weight. This reduces the number of parts going into the gun, making assembly and disassembly simpler. The gun is composed of two parts, upper and lower. The upper part is the top assembly of the weapon such as barrel and rail, and the lower is the handle and trigger mechanism. The upper and lower parts of the Barrett M90 are held together by very strong push pins. Due to the advancement in the bullpup design, the magazine is located in the stock of the weapon, adding to its more compact design. The Barrett M90 has a much shallower magazine than the Barrett M82A1 and can only hold five rounds. This is due to the smaller design of the weapon. The handle and trigger mechanism is located just in front of the gun‚Äôs magazine. The butt of the gun is positioned directly to the receiver as well, increasing stability when firing. The gun uses a foldable bipod to add to accuracy and stability while firing. This also decreases the initial force of recoil from the weapon. The scope of the Barrett M90 varies. For a stock scope the Barrett M90 uses a 10x Leupold M series sight. The Barrett M90 was produced between 1990 and 1995. In 1995 its replacement the Barrett M95, which is currently being used by multiple armies, was made after technological advancements in Barrett Firearm‚Äôs weapon systems. The Barrett M95 is the improved variant of the Barrett M90. The Barrett M95 has better magazine clearance because the pistol grip and trigger have been moved forward on the gun. Also, there were minor changes to the firing pin, bolt handle, and the barrel chamber is plated in chrome. The Barrett M90 still remains very popular because of its bullpup design and light weight. The Barrett M90 was bought at a slow pace and sometimes in bulk. By now, the Barrett M90 is found for sale through firearm collectors and is sold online. Weapon operation The Barrett M90 is not meant to be a shoulder-fired weapon. Upon setup when preparing to fire the M90, it is first set up by folding down the attached bipod on the weapon and set on whatever space is being used to fire the weapon. The gun is first inspected to see if there is any debris that might cause the weapon to malfunction. Being a bolt-action rifle, there is typically little cause for error, whereas a semi-automatic rifle could jam or the round might have problems ejecting after firing. After the gun is set up in the desired firing space, the five-round magazine is loaded and the gun is ready to be fired after proper safety precautions are followed. The gun is rested on the bipod with the user holding the rifle‚Äôs handle firmly to prevent the gun from sliding back. The design that has gone into the M90 allows it to be fired in this manner without being pressed against the shoulder. The gun is able to reduce recoil through the muzzle brakes, and bipod usage. If the Barrett M90 did not have any muzzle brake then the recoil of the gun would be considerably larger and would need a different design incorporating the shoulder being pressed to the gun.

It was written in 1859, after eight years of effort. Mir√®io, a long poem in Proven√ßal consisting of twelve songs, tells of the thwarted love of Vincent and Mireille, two young Proven√ßal people of different social backgrounds. The name Mireille (Mir√®io in Provence) is a doublet of the word meraviho which means wonder. Overview Mistral used the poem to promote the language, Occitan the lingua franca of Southern France until the vergonha, as well as to share the culture of the Proven√ßa area. He tells among other tales, of Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, where according to legend the dragon, Tarasque, was driven out, and of the famous and ancient Venus of Arles. He prefaced the poem with a short notice about Proven√ßal pronunciation. Mir√®io was translated into some fifteen European languages, including into French by Mistral himself. In 1863, Charles Gounod made it into an opera, Mireille. The plot In Provence, Mir√®io is the daughter of a rich farmer. She is in love with a modest basketmaker, Vinc√®nt. Her father disapproves of the relationship and seeks other suitors. Mir√®io, in despair, escapes from her house to Saintes- Maries-de-la-Mer. There she prays to the saints that her father will accept her relationship with Vinc√®nt. The way is hard and unbearably hot. At the end, the saints appear to Mir√®io. They tell her of their happiness in Paradise, and Mir√®io dies in peace. Dedication Mistral dedicated his book to Alphonse de Lamartine, a French writer, poet and politician who was instrumental in the foundation of the Second Republic and the continuation of the Tricolore as the flag of France, as follows: \\"To Lamartine: To you, I dedicate Mireille: It is my heart and my soul; It is the flower of my years; It is bunch of grapes from La Crau, leaves and all, a peasant's offering.\\" Lamartine wrote enthusiastically: \\"I will tell you good news today! A great epic poet is born ... A true Homeric poet in our time; ...

He was also a younger brother of Andries de Witt and the father of Johan and Cornelis de Witt. Career Jacob was a member of the patrician De Witt family. He studied law at Leiden University and obtained a law degree there. In 1618, he became treasurer of the Synod of Dort, where he held several positions in public service, serving as burgomaster six times. He also served as emissary to Sweden along with Andries Bicker. He was a member of the States of Holland and an opponent of William II, Prince of Orange, stadtholder of Holland and four other provinces. Together with the republican-minded brothers Cornelis and Andries de Graeff and their cousins Cornelis and Andries Bicker, De Witt supported the Peace of M√ºnster. In May 1650 they proposed to reduce the size of the army, which was opposed by William as commander of the army. This dispute led to a coup by William, who tried to seize Amsterdam. On 30 June 1650, William arrested De Witt and the burgomasters of Delft, Hoorn, Medemblik, Haarlem, and Dordrecht (all prominent members of the States of Holland) at the Binnenhof in The Hague. They were imprisoned in Castle Loevestein. On 17 August they were released after having reversed the reduction of the army size. Death In 1657 he moved to The Hague, but after the murder of his sons on 20 August 1672, on which he was brought to safety, he avoided The Hague, then spent a short time in Dordrecht where he died on 10 January 1674.

The station is licensed to Belle Plaine, Kansas. History KANR was first issued a construction permit for 92.7 FM on February 10, 1993, issued as KUOY. The station signed on as an All-News station on March 4, 1996, and has been the only station in Wichita providing that format. In March 2000, it became the temporary home to Smooth Jazz KWSJ. It was formerly located on 105.3 (now Hot AC KFBZ). Later that month, KWSJ would relocate yet again, this time to 98.7 (now KNSS-FM). 92.7 would flip to Rhythmic Top 40 as \\"Fly 92.7\\" to compete against Rhythmic KDGS \\"Power 93.9\\", whose studios are (literally) a few hundred feet from KANR. Former KDGS personality Christopher \\"Kidd Chris\\" Foley was also a DJ on KANR and was fired for an infamous run-in with police (he is now at WEBN in Cincinnati). A year later, the station flipped to Alternative. Despite the signal's moderate to poor coverage over Wichita, KANR had a large following of listeners with its Alternative format. The station changed format on September 1, 2006 to Spanish Top 40, branded as \\"Fiesta 92.7\\". KANR listeners were upset over the format change. The Wichita market was without an alternative station until August 29, 2014, when KTHR dropped classic rock. On December 21, 2011, KANR moved from 92.7 to 99.7 FM. In March 2013, Daniel D. Smith sold the station to Air Capitol Media Group, LLC for $2 million; the transaction was consummated on June 28, 2013. On April 1, Air Capitol registered various domains under the name \\"Lite\\", as well as \\"Wichitas997.com\\", signaling that the \\"Fiesta\\" format will come to an end by May 1, when Air Capitol takes over the station via a Time Brokerage Agreement.http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/81521/wichitas-fiesta-to- give-way-to-ac/ It was also hinted by the Wichita Eagle that Brett Harris, formerly of KRBB, would be a part of the new station when his non-compete clause expires that summer. On May 1, 2013, at Midnight, KANR officially flipped to adult contemporary, branded as \\"99.7 Lite FM\\" under the new KHLT-FM call letters.http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/81521/wichitas-fiesta-to- give-way-to-ac/ The first song on \\"Lite\\" was \\"It's My Life\\" by No Doubt. On July 29, 2015, Air Capitol Media Group announced that the station would be sold back to Daniel D.

On August 17, at Midnight, the station went silent. Three days later, on August 20, the station signed back on and returned to Spanish, this time with a Regional Mexican format, branded as \\"La Raza 99.7.\\"http://andoverleader.com/2015/08/word-on-the-street-its-lites-out- at-99-7/ The sale was consummated on October 26, 2015, at a purchase price of $1,420,717.60; most of the price represented forgiveness of debt still owed from Air Capitol's 2013 purchase of the station.

Early life Schoepf was born in Podg√≥rze, Poland, which was then part of the Austrian kingdom of Galicia. He entered the Vienna Military Academy in 1837, became a lieutenant of artillery in 1841,While these dates seem correct by multiple sources, this is a very quick progression through the academy. Normally it took 8 years to move through the academy (see http://listsearches.rootsweb.com/th/read/AUSTRO- HUNGARIAN-MILITARY/2005-01/1104873140), on the other hand, he was late going to the academy (from the same source). and served in Hungary as a captain in the Austrian Army. At the beginning of the Hungarian Revolution in 1848, he resigned his commission and enlisted as a private in the Hungarian Revolutionary Army under Lajos Kossuth. He was soon promoted to major. When Kossuth abdicated in 1849, Schoepf was exiled to Turkey, where he served under Gen. Jozef Bem against the insurgents at Aleppo, and afterward became instructor of artillery in the Ottoman Empire's army with the rank of major. Washington, D.C. He emigrated to the United States in 1851. Befriended by Joseph Holt, Schoepf served as a clerk first in the U.S. Coastal Survey and later in the U.S. Patent Office and the War Department (working under Holt). While working in Washington, D.C. Schoepf married Julie Bates Kesley in 1855; they had 9 children together. Civil War Appointed a brigadier general of volunteers on September 30, 1861, Schoepf's brigade fought well at the Battle of Camp Wildcat, repulsing Confederates under Brig. Gen. Felix Zollicoffer. This was followed a few weeks later by Schoepf's precipitate retreat, by order of his superior officer, from London, Kentucky, to Crab Orchard, which the Confederates called the ‚ÄúWild-Cat stampede.‚Äù Schoepf and his troops later fought Zollicoffer at the Battle of Mill Springs. Proving himself an aggressive and able field commander, Schoepf was promoted to division command in August 1862, but often found himself at odds with Army of the Ohio commander Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell, especially after being denied orders to attack until late in the Battle of Perryville. Appointed to a military board of inquiry investigating Buell's conduct during the campaign, Schoepf made no secret of his disapproval of his commander's actions ‚Äî so much so that Buell raised Schoepf's hostility as an issue. Not wanting his involvement to affect the Buell investigation's outcome, Schoepf asked Army general-in-chief Henry W. Halleck to transfer him to another assignment. On April 13, 1863, Schoepf was ordered to report to Fort Delaware as commanding office and served the balance of the war in that command. He was mustered out of service on January 15, 1866. Fort Delaware, located on Pea Patch Island, served as a prisoner-of- war camp for captured Confederate soldiers and sailors. According to Laura M. Lee, historian at Fort Delaware State Park, \\"...it was not a pleasant place by any standards, historical records and the death rate testify to the fact that it was one of the more survivable prison camps, North or South.\\" The prisoner complex held up to 11,500 at its peak (July 1863), with a cumulative population of 33,000 by war's end. According to \\"They Died at Fort Delaware 1861‚Äì1865\\" by historian Jocelyn P. Jamison and compiled from NARA records, about 2,460 prisoners died, 109 guards and 39 civilians. Postbellum career After the war, Schoepf returned to the U.S. Patent Office and died after a long illness, likely stomach cancer. He is buried in the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

Fogging is used for censorship or privacy. An area for a picture or movie is blurred to obscure it from sight. This form of censorship is used for sexually related images/scenes, hiding genitals, pubic hair, or sexual penetration of any sort. Pixelization is a form of fogging. In Japan, where it is called bokashi, fogging is employed on most films that show pubic hair or genitals, including hardcore pornography. This form of editing also appears in television programs where an individual's face may not be shown due to legal or privacy concerns. As it does not contrast with the surrounding image very much, it is preferable over most other forms of censorship.. However, unlike other forms of visual censoring, it does not allow to preserve any information about the original stimulus. Fogging is also used if the scenes which are too bloody and gruesome to be rendered even in black and white, over vehicle license plates, mainly to protect the identities of the vehicles' owners, and over branded items and specific company names to obscure their background.

Elihu Ely (1777-1839), son of Captain Levi Ely (1732-1780).Genealogical and Personal Memoirs Relating to the Families of the State of Massachusetts, Vol. II (1910), pp. 665-8.Scannell's New Jersey's First Citizens and State Guide, Vol. 2 (1919), pp. 143-4.Genealogical History of Hudson and Bergen Counties, New Jersey (1900), pp. 365-6. He attended the University of Michigan and New York University Law School, receiving his LL.B. degree in 1913. He served as a lieutenant in the National Guard on the Mexican border in 1916 and was with the United States Army Motor Transport Corps during World War I. He married Mary E. Rogers of Paterson, New Jersey on April 30, 1917, and they had three sons and two daughters.\\"William H. J. Ely, Jersey Ex-Leader\\", The New York Times, March 3, 1942. Career In 1924 Ely was named a district judge in the Second Judicial District of Bergen County, and he served on the bench for five years. He began his political career in 1926 as a member of the Rutherford Borough Council. He was elected to the New Jersey Senate in 1931, the first Democrat from Bergen County to serve in the Senate in sixteen years. He was defeated for reelection in 1934. In 1935 he was appointed the State WPA Administrator. He resigned two years later to run for the open seat in the United States Senate created by the resignation of A. Harry Moore. In the 1938 election he faced Republican William Warren Barbour, who had served in the Senate from 1931 to 1937. Ely campaigned as a \\"100 per cent\\" supporter of the Roosevelt administration. He was seen as in the pocket of notorious political boss Frank Hague of Jersey City, and a few days before the election referred to Hague as \\"my leader.\\" Ely lost to Barbour by a margin of 112,508 votes. Death Ely died at the age of 50 in 1942 at his home in Rutherford after suffering a stroke.

States Air Force (USAF) series of lightweight and simple fighters. Only two aircraft were built; one aircraft was used primarily for aerodynamic research and the other served as an armament testbed, both aircraft being destroyed in accidents during testing.Bowman 2000, p. 33. The XF-104s were forerunners of over 2,500 production Lockheed F-104 Starfighters. During the Korean War, USAF fighter pilots were outclassed by MiG-equipped Soviet pilots. Lockheed engineers, led by Kelly Johnson, designed and submitted a novel design to the Air Force, notable for its sleekness, particularly its thin wings and missile-shaped fuselage, as well as a novel pilot ejection system. Flight testing of the XF-104s began with the first flight in March 1954, encountering several problems, some of which were resolved; however, performance of the XF-104 proved better than estimates and despite both prototypes being lost through accidents, the USAF ordered 17 service-test/pre-production YF-104As. Production Starfighters proved popular, both with the USAF and internationally, serving with a number of countries, including Jordan, Turkey, and Japan. Development =Original requirement= Clarence L. \\"Kelly\\" Johnson, chief engineer at Lockheed's Skunk Works, visited Korea in December 1951 and talked to fighter pilots about what sort of aircraft they wanted. At the time, U.S. Air Force pilots were confronting the MiG-15 \\"Fagot\\" in their North American F-86 Sabres, and many of the pilots felt that the MiGs were superior to the larger and more complex American design. The pilots requested a small and simple aircraft with excellent performance.Bowman 2000, p. 26. One pilot in particular, Colonel Gabby Gabreski was quoted as saying; \\"I'd rather sight with a piece of chewing gum stuck on the windscreen\\" and told Johnson that radar \\"was a waste of time\\".Bowman 2000, p. 26. alt=Four sketch drawings of an aircraft On his return to the U.S., Johnson immediately started the design of just such an aircraft realising that an official requirement would soon be published. In March 1952, his team was assembled, and they sketched several different aircraft proposals, ranging from small designs at 8,000 lb (3.6 t), to fairly large ones at 50,000 lb (23 t). The L-246 as the design became known remained essentially identical to the \\"Model L-083 Starfighter\\" as eventually delivered.Bowman 2000, p. 32. =Tender of performance= The design was presented to the Air Force in November 1952, who were interested enough to create a new proposal, inviting several companies to participate. Three additional designs were received: the Republic AP-55, an improved version of its prototype XF-91 Thunderceptor; the North American NA-212, which would eventually evolve into the F-107; and the Northrop N-102 Fang, a new General Electric J79-powered design. =Selected design= Although all were interesting, Lockheed had an insurmountable lead and was granted a development contract in March 1953.Bowman 2000, p. 32. Test data from the earlier Lockheed X-7 unmanned ramjet/rocket program proved invaluable for aerodynamic research since the XF-104 would share the general design of the X-7's wing and tail.Reed 1981, p. 10.Upton 2003, p. 13. Experience gained from the Douglas X-3 Stiletto was also used in the design phase of the XF-104.Bowman 2000, p. 27. Over 400 surplus instrumented artillery rockets were launched to test various airfoils and tail designs; from which the camera film and telemetry were recovered by parachute.Upton 2003, p. 14. =Prototypes= The wooden mock-up was ready for inspection at the end of April, and work started on two prototypes late in May. The J79 engine was not yet ready, so both prototypes were instead designed to use the Wright J65, a licensed built version of the Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire. Construction of the first prototype XF-104 (US serial number 53-7786, Buzz number FG-786) began in summer 1953 at Lockheed's Burbank, California factory. This aircraft was powered by a non-afterburning Buick-built Wright J65-B-3 turbojet. The first prototype was completed by early 1954, and started flying in March. The total time from award of the contract to first flight was only one year, a very short time even then, and unheard of today, when 10‚Äì15 years is more typical.Upton 2003, p. 13. Construction of the second prototype (s/n 53-7787) proceeded at a slower pace. =F-104 production= Official approval of the XF-104 design led to a contract for 17 YF-104A service test aircraft and a production run of over 2,500 aircraft built both in the United States and under license worldwide. Visible changes from the XF-104 to production versions of the Starfighter include a longer fuselage (to accommodate the J79 engine and extra internal fuel) and a forward-retracting nose landing gear (except two-seat versions) to increase clearance for the downward-ejecting seat. A ventral fin for increased stability was added during the YF-104A test program. Inlet shock cones and a fuselage spine fairing between the canopy and fin that housed fuel piping were further added features.Bowman 2000, p. 32.Upton 2003, p. 38.Gunston, W. L., ed. \\"F-104: Holder of the Absolute Records for Speed and Altitude.\\" Flight International, 30 May 1958, p. 743. Retrieved: 29 June 2011. Production aircraft would also feature a redesigned fin structure using stainless steel spars to eliminate the flutter problem.Upton 2003, p. 45. Since the internal fuel capacity was low limiting the useful range of the aircraft, extra capacity was provided on later versions by lengthening the forward fuselage. Design In order to achieve the desired performance, Lockheed chose a minimalist approach: a design that would achieve high performance by wrapping the lightest, most aerodynamically efficient airframe possible around a single powerful engine. The emphasis was on minimizing drag and mass.Bowman 2000, p. 29. =Wing design= The XF-104 had a radical wing design. Most supersonic jets use a swept or delta wing. This allows a reasonable balance between aerodynamic performance, lift, and internal space for fuel and equipment. However the most efficient shape for high-speed, supersonic flight had been found to be a small, straight, mid-mounted, trapezoidal wing of low aspect ratio and high wing loading. The wing was extremely thin, with a thickness-to- chord ratio of only 3.4%. The leading edges of the wing were so thin (0.016 in/0.41 mm) and so sharp that they presented a hazard to ground crews, and protective guards had to be installed during ground operations. The thinness of the wings meant that fuel tanks and landing gear had to be contained in the fuselage. The hydraulic actuators driving the ailerons were only one inch (25 mm) thick to fit into the available space and were known as Piccolo actuators because of their resemblance to this musical instrument. The wings had electrically driven leading and trailing edge flaps to increase lift at low speed. The XF-104 did not feature the Boundary Layer Control System of the production aircraft.Bowman 2000, p. 28. alt=Black-and-white photograph of male personnel working on a wooden mock-up of jet aircraft =Tail fin= After extensive wind tunnel testing, the stabilator was mounted at the top of the fin for optimum stability and control about the pitch axis.Bowman 2000, p. 28. Because the vertical tail fin was only slightly shorter than the length of each wing and nearly as aerodynamically effective, it could act as a wing on rudder application (a phenomenon known as \\"Dutch roll\\"). To offset this effect, the wings were angled downward to give 10¬∞ anhedral. The rudder was manually operated and supplemented by a small yaw damper surface mounted at the bottom of the fin.Bowman 2000, p. 28. =Fuselage= The fuselage of the XF-104 had a high fineness ratio, i.e., tapering sharply towards the nose, and a small frontal area of .Upton 2003, p. 17. The fuselage was tightly packed, containing the cockpit, avionics, cannon, all internal fuel, landing gear, and engine.Bowman 2000, p. 29. The air intakes, designed by Ben Rich, were of fixed geometry without inlet cones, since the J65-powered aircraft was incapable of Mach 2 performance. They were similar to those of the F-94 Starfire, being mounted slightly away from the fuselage, with an inner splitter plate for the boundary layer bleed air. The combination of these features provided extremely low drag except at high angle of attack, at which point induced drag became very high. =Ejection seat= The XF-104 featured an unusual downward-ejecting Stanley B seat. It was feared that contemporary ejection seat designs would not have enough explosive power to clear the high \\"T\\" tail assembly. In the event of the seat not firing, it was possible to manually release the lower fuselage hatch and then exit the aircraft via gravity. The F-104 series aircraft would later convert to upward-ejecting seats but the fuselage hatch was retained as a useful maintenance feature.Bowman 2000, p. 33. Operational history =Testing and evaluation= alt=Pilot in overall black suit crouching on jet aircraft's nose First flights The first XF-104 (Lockheed 083-1001, s/n 53-7786) was transported to Edwards AFB amidst high secrecy during the night of 24‚Äì25 February, where Lockheed test pilot Tony LeVier was to do the initial testing.Bowman 2000, p. 32. On 28 February 1954, the XF-104 made a planned hop of about five feet off the ground during a high-speed taxi, but its first official flight took place on 4 March.Pace 1992, p. 17. During that flight, the landing gear did not retract, and LeVier landed after a low-speed flight of about 20 minutes.Jenkins and Landis 2008, p. 168. Adjustments and further flights discovered that the problem was low pressure in the hydraulic system. Bad weather kept the XF-104 on the ground until 26 March, when further flights were carried out with the landing gear retracting normally. The second prototype (Lockheed 083-1002, s/n 53-7787), fitted with the afterburning J65 from the start, first flew on 5 October. Since it was to be the armament test bed, it was fitted with the 20 mm (.79 in) M61 Vulcan cannon and was equipped with an AN/ASG-14T-1 fire control system.Upton 2003, p. 38. XF-104 #2 achieved a top speed of Mach 1.79 at on 25 March 1955, piloted by Lockheed test pilot J. Ray Goudey. This was the highest speed achieved by the XF-104.Bowman 2000, p. 29. Performance XF-104 #1 was subsonic in level flight when powered by the non-afterburning J65, but Mach 1 could be easily exceeded during a slight descent. In July 1954, the J65-B-3 was replaced by the afterburning J65-W-7 turbojet. With this engine installed, the performance of the XF-104 was greatly improved. Maximum level speed was Mach 1.49 at , and an altitude of could be attained in a zoom climb, while Mach 1.6 could be attained in a dive. The first XF-104 was accepted by the USAF in November 1955. alt=Seven- barrel rotary gun resting on metal rig Firing tests Initial aerial firing tests with the Vulcan cannon on the second aircraft were successful, but on 17 December, there was an explosion during a firing burstBowman 2000, p. 35. and the J65 engine suffered severe compressor stalls. Tony LeVier immediately shut down the engine and glided back to make a successful deadstick landing at Rogers Dry Lake. An investigation later showed that one of the 20 mm cannon rounds had exploded in the breech, blowing the bolt out the rear of the gun and through the structure into the forward fuselage fuel cell. Jet fuel had run into the gun bay, and leaked out of the compartment door seals and into the left engine air intake. The engine immediately flooded with fuel, causing the compressor stalls.Gunston. W. L., ed. \\"Starfighter: Lockheed's Mach 2 Fighter for the U.S.A.F.\\" Flight International, 20 April 1956, p. 442. Retrieved: 28 June 2011. =Crashes= XF-104 53-7786 was lost in a crash on 11 July 1957 when it developed an uncontrollable fin flutter while flying chase for F-104A flight tests. The entire tail group was ripped from the airframe, and Lockheed test pilot Bill Park was forced to eject. Fin flutter was a known problem and the aircraft had been limited to speeds of no more than Mach 0.95 at the time of the accident. Tony LeVier had attempted to have the aircraft removed from flight status and placed in a museum, arguing that its performance was not suitable for chase duties.Bowman 2000, p. 35.Upton 2003, p. 45.Pace 1992, p. 22. XF-104 53-7787 was lost on 14 April 1955 after accumulating over 1,000 flying hoursKinzey 1991, p. 6. when test pilot Herman Salmon was forced to eject during gun firing trials at . The gun malfunctioned during a test firing, and severe vibrations began to build up which knocked loose the ejection hatch below the cockpit. Cabin pressure was lost with Salmon's pressure suit inflating and covering his face so that he could not see. Recalling LeVier's harrowing experience with the exploding cannon shell the previous December, Salmon believed that the same thing had happened to him and that he had no option but to eject. He later found out that he could have saved 53-7787 by bringing it down to a lower altitude and waiting for his pressure suit to deflate. With the loss of the armament testbed, Lockheed engineers were forced to find an alternative, and armament trials were continued on a modified Lockheed F-94C Starfire.Pace 1992, p. 20. The two XF-104s amassed an approximate total of 2,500 flight hours. =Testing conclusions= Flight testing proved that performance estimates were accurate and that even when fitted with the low powered J65 engine, the XF-104 flew faster than the other Century Series fighters being developed at the time. The XF-104's ceiling at was higher than predicted, and it exceeded estimated speed and drag figures by two to three percent.Kinzey 1991, p. 4. It was noted however that the low thrust of the J65 engine did not enable the full performance potential of the type to be realized. alt=Five aircraft parked on ramp for black-and-white photo shoot A number of minor problems surfaced, but were readily fixed. The yaw damper of the XF-104 was found to be ineffective and the rudder did not positively center; these problems were corrected by revising the rudder control system.Pace 1992, p. 20. The unpowered rudder did not provide adequate directional control at high air speeds, which problem was fixed by using hydraulic power on all subsequent versions of the F-104; and some concern was expressed over poor subsonic maneuverability at higher altitudes.Pace 1992, p. 20. During a later interview, Kelly Johnson was asked about his opinion on the aircraft. \\"Did it come up to my designs? In terms of performance, yes. In terms of engine, we went through a great many engine problems, not with the J65s but with the J79s.\\"Reed 1981, p. 13. For his part in designing the F-104 airframe, Johnson was jointly awarded the Collier Trophy in 1958, sharing the honor with General Electric (engine) and the U.S. Air Force (Flight Records).Greenfield, Art. \\"Collier Trophy winners, 1950‚Äì1959.\\" National Aeronautic Association.

The book is the second in a trilogy of books known as the Moonlight Bay Trilogy, involving Christopher Snow, who suffers from the rare (but real) disease called XP (xeroderma pigmentosum). The first in the series is Fear Nothing and the third is tentatively titled Ride the Storm (release date unknown). Seize the Night was originally released by Cemetery Dance Publications as two different limited edition hardcovers, both with different artwork on their front cover: *A traycased lettered edition of 52 signed and lettered copies *A slipcased limited edition of 698 signed and numbered copies Plot summary Seize the Night begins a few months after Fear Nothing. It starts with Chris and his dog Orson happening upon Chris's ex-girlfriend, Lilly Wing, whose son Jimmy has just disappeared. Chris swears to Lilly he'll find Jimmy, and departs with Orson to begin the search. The trail leads them to Fort Wyvern, the abandoned military base Chris likes to explore. They search the base, but soon become separated, and Orson goes missing. Fearing for his dog's well-being, along with that of Jimmy, Chris calls his best friend Bobby Halloway to join him in the search and then sends his current girlfriend Sasha Goodall to Lilly's house to console her. Soon after calling them, Chris sees about thirty or so of the rhesus monkeys encountered towards the end of Fear Nothing and takes refuge from them in a nearby bungalow. The monkeys follow him in, and he is saved from being found by Bobby's arrival. Bobby and Chris search the base, but find nothing except a few strange devices and rooms. After leaving, they stop by Lilly's house. Sasha and Chris head to their place, while Bobby heads off to Lilly's mother-in-law Jenna, to bring her back to Lilly's. The next day, Chris calls Manuel Ramirez, the acting chief of police, to give him information about Jimmy Wing's kidnapper's vehicle. Getting no answer, he leaves a message for Manuel to call him after noon. Bobby stops by a bit later to say that Jimmy is not the only child missing. Later, Manuel tells Chris in no uncertain terms to back off, while confiscating his and Bobby's guns and trashing his house. After he leaves, Roosevelt Frost arrives with his cat, Mungojerrie. They all leave and head out to an old road a few miles away where Sasha's coworker at the radio station, Doogie, meets up with them. They then head back to Fort Wyvern to continue the search for the children and Orson. Chris and company head into the base, where Bobby is critically wounded in an ambush. He sends everyone else on to find the kids and Orson, and when they return with them in tow, Bobby dies. Chris, refusing to leave Bobby's body behind, demands it be taken with them on the way out. On the elevator ride back up, they actually encounter themselves at the top of the shaft, and Chris is able to stop Bobby's past self from being shot. With the past now altered, Bobby's body disappears from the elevator, and Chris takes the live Bobby with him out of the base to return Jimmy and the other kids to their parents.

The channel has a length of approximately 96 nmi and is divided into two arms: the northwest arm, which is scarcely used as navigation route and is 50 nmi long, and the south arm (46 nmi long), which is a major waterway for commercial sailing and that stretches from its connection with the Sarmiento Channel at southern tip of the Victoria Pass until the point already named, where it joins to the Strait of Magellan. The channel is flanked by mountain ranges of exposed granite that at their foothills have limited vegetation cover, because the continuous winds that blow against it. In the northwest arm the hills are high, including the Monte Nuestra Se√±ora de la Victoria (890 m) and the Lecky Look Out (890 m) on the Contreras Island, and the Monte Luc√≠a of 510 m on the Diego de Almagro Island. In the vicinity of its south arm is Monte Burney, which lie on Mu√±oz Gamero Peninsula in mainland. This imposing volcanic peak stands out from the mountains that surround it. Other mountains in the area include Monte Joy (443 m) and the peaks Sainte Agnes and Sainte Anne with elevations of 323 and 513 m high respectively, which stand on the Manuel Rodr√≠guez Island. The tidal currents are stable and weak, but influenced by the wind. On the south branch, there are a number of lighthouses, buoys and beacons as a pilotage aid, which are located specialty at the passes Summer and Shoal, and at the channels Gray and Mayne, all of which lie along its course. There exist special instructions for the navigation in the places mentioned.

Admiral Beauchamp Seymour was in command of a fleet of fifteen Royal Navy ironclad ships which had previously sailed to the harbor of Alexandria to support the khedive Tewfik Pasha amid Ahmed ‚ÄòUrabi's nationalist uprising against his administration and its close ties to British and French financiers. He was joined in the show of force by a French flotilla as well. The move provided some security to the khedive, who withdrew his court to the now-protected port, but strengthened ‚ÄòUrabi's nationalists within the army and throughout the remainder of Egypt. On 11 June, anti-Christian riots began in Alexandria. The city's European residents fled and the Egyptian ‚ÄòUrabist army began fortifying and arming the harbor. An ultimatum to cease this build-up being refused, the British fleet began a 10¬Ω-hour bombardment of the city without French assistance. Historians argue about whether Admiral Seymour exaggerated the threat from the Egyptian batteries at Alexandria in order to force the hand of a reluctant Gladstone administration. Once the British had attacked the city, they then proceeded to a full-scale invasion to restore the authority of the khedive. Egypt remained under British occupation until 1956. Origins In 1869, Khedive Ismail of Egypt inaugurated the Suez Canal, which was a joint venture between the Egyptian Government and the French-led Suez Canal Company. During the excavation of the canal so many Egyptian workers died that it became common in the collective memory of Egyptians to say that Egyptian blood ran in the canal before the water of the seas. The canal cut sailing time from Britain to India by weeks and Britain's interest in Egypt grew. Due to the excessive spending of the Egyptian Government under the ambitious Khedive, Britain purchased the Khedive's shares of the Suez Canal company in 1875, thus becoming a substantial partner, owning 40% of the total share issue. French and British concern led to the establishment of an Anglo-French Condominium over Egypt which was still nominally under the Ottoman Empire. Egyptian nationalism was sparked and, after a revolt by Egyptian troops in 1881, complete control of the government was held by ‚ÄòUrabi Pasha by February 1882. The rebellion expressed resentment of foreigners. ‚ÄòUrabi organized a militia and marched on Alexandria. Meanwhile, the European powers gathered in Constantinople to discuss reestablishing the power of the Khedive and an Anglo-French fleet was ordered to the port of Alexandria. The Egyptians began reinforcing and upgrading their fortifications and the British House of Commons ordered ships to be temporarily dispatched from the Channel Fleet to Malta under Admiral Seymour's command. On 20 May the combined Anglo-French fleet, consisting of the British battleship , the and four gunboats arrived in Alexandria. By 5 June, six more warships had entered Alexandria harbour and more cruised off the coast. The reasons that the British government sent warships to Alexandria is an object of historical debate, with arguments proposed that it was to protect the Suez Canal and prevent anarchy, and other arguments claiming that it was to protect the interests of British investors with assets in Egypt (see 1882 Anglo- Egyptian War). The presence of the foreign fleet exacerbated the tensions in Alexandria between the nationalist forces and the large foreign and Christian population. On 11 and 12 June ferocious riots erupted, possibly started by ‚ÄòUrabi's supporters but also blamed upon the Khedive himself as a false flag operation. Over 50 Europeans and 125 Egyptians were killed in the fracas that began near Place Mehmet Ali with British Admiral Seymour, who was ashore at the time, narrowly escaping the mob. Upon learning of the riot, ‚ÄòUrabi ordered his forces to restore order. The reaction by European countries to the disturbance was swift. As refugees fled Alexandria, a flotilla of over 26 ships belonging to most of the countries of Europe gathered in the harbour. By 6 July nearly every non-Egyptian had evacuated Alexandria. Meanwhile, the garrison had continued to fortify the various forts and towers with additional guns until Admiral Seymour issued an ultimatum to ‚ÄòUrabi's forces to stop fortifying or the British fleet would bombard the city. That same day, the French Admiral Conrad, had informed Seymour that in the event of British bombardment, the French fleet would depart for Port Said and would not participate in the bombardment. The ultimatum, which was ignored amid denials of the defensive works by the Egyptian governor, was set to expire at 7:00 am on 11 July. Battle Plan of the Bombardement British ships shelling Alexandria. At daybreak the gun-ship Helicon was dispatched into the harbour flying flags saying she was carrying a message from the Egyptian government to the city defenders.Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, .293 At 7:00 a.m. on 11 July Admiral Seymour aboard HMS Invincible signaled to to commence firing at the Ras El Tin fortifications followed by the general order to attack the enemy's batteries. According to Royle, \\"[a] steady cannonade was maintained by the attacking and defending forces, and for the next few hours the roar of the guns and the shrieks of passing shot and shell were alone audible.\\" The attack was carried out by the off-shore squadron as it was underway, the ships turning from time to time to keep up the barrage. This was not entirely effective and by 9:40, HMS Sultan, HMS Superb and HMS Alexandra anchored off the Lighthouse Fort and concentrated their now-stationary batteries on Ras El Tin. The fort battery was able to score hits, particularly on Alexandra, but by 12:30, Inflexible had joined the attack and the fort's guns were silenced. Meanwhile, HMS Temeraire had taken on the Mex Forts (with Invincible splitting its broadsides between Ras El Tin and Mex) and was causing damage to Mex when she grounded on a reef. The gunboat HMS Condor (Beresford) went to her assistance and she was refloated and resumed the attack on the Mex fort. While the off-shore squadron was engaging the forts at long-range, HMS Monarch, HMS Penelope and HMS Condor were ordered into close engagements with the forts at Maza El Kanat and Fort Marabout. HMS Condor, seeing that Invincible was within range of the guns at Fort Marabout, sailed to within 1,200 feet of the fort and began furiously firing at the fort. When Fort Marabout's guns were disabled, the flagship signaled \\"Well Done, Condor.\\" The Condors action allowed the ships to finish off Fort Mex. With the Mex Fort's guns silenced, HMS Sultan signaled to Invincible to attack Fort Adda, which she did with the assistance of Temeraire. At 1:30, a lucky shell from HMS Superb blew up the magazine of Fort Adda, and those batteries ceased firing. At about this time, the British fleet began to run short of ammunition. However, nearly all of the guns from Fort Adda west were silenced. HMS Superb, Inflexible and Temeraire focused their fire on the remaining eastern forts until, at 5:15, the general order to cease fire was issued. The Egyptians, both outmanned and outgunned, had used their firepower to good effect, but the outcome of the bombardment had never been in doubt. The Cairo newspaper El Taif erroneously reported that the Egyptian forts had sunk three ships. The next day, HMS Temeraire reconnoitered the forts and discovered that the Hospital battery had reconstituted its defences. At 10:30 a.m., Temeraire and Inflexible opened fire, and the battery raised the flag of truce at 10:48 a.m. Very soon an Egyptian boat set out to the flagship bearing the flag of truce, and a cease-fire was ordered. By 2:50 p.m., HMS Bittern signaled that the negotiations had failed and the bombardment was to resume. Still, most of the forts flew white flags and an irregular cannonade by the British fleet began. By 4:00 p.m. a fire had broken out on shore, and by evening the fire had engulfed the wealthiest quarter of Alexandria, the area predominantly inhabited by Europeans. The fire raged for the next two days before it burned itself out. Admiral Seymour, unsure of the situation in the city, didn't land any troops to take control of the city or fight the fire. It was not until 14 July that British marines and sailors landed in Alexandria. Photo in Alexandria after the bombardment and fire of 11‚Äì13 July 1882. Attarine Mosque Street after bombardment Aftermath Fires continued to break out in Alexandria over the next few days, and the city was chaotic and lawless, which permitted Bedouins, among others, to loot the city. British sailors and marines landed and attempted to take control of the blackened ruins of the city and prevent the looting, while propping up the Khedive's shaky government. Eventually order was restored, and a month later General Garnet Wolseley landed a large force of British troops in Alexandria as a staging location for attacking ‚ÄòUrabi near the Suez Canal at the Battle of Tell El Kebir. Photographer created an album of fifty pages showing the changes in Alexandria from start to finish of this attack. These photos can now be found online at The American University of Cairo in the Rare Books and Special Collections Digital Library. This digital library was established in the fall of 2011 and the photographs of the Bombardment of Alexandria were compiled between June and August 2012. The bombardment was described in disparaging terms by British MP Henry Richard: > I find a man prowling about my house with obviously felonious purposes. I > hasten to get locks and bars, and to barricade my windows. He says that is > an insult and threat to him, and he batters down my doors, and declares that > he does so only as an act of strict self-defence. After that the Urabi revolt was put down.

The collection The stories are not united by any theme, but three of four are set about 2500 years \\"After Landing\\", the beginning of human settlement on Pern. That is just before or during the \\"Ninth Pass\\" of the \\"Red Star\\", an erratic planet that periodically brings a biological menace from space. Those three stories therefore share a Pernese historical period with most of the previous books in the series (11 of 16). The seventeenth Dragonriders of Pern book, A Gift of Dragons was the last one in the series written by Anne McCaffrey alone, before the entry of her son Todd (see Dragon's Kin). It was published first in the US and four months later in the UK with the same cover art, by Del Rey Books and Bantam UK, two imprints of Random House.

It tells of Keevan, a boy who is a candidate for Ramoth's latest clutch in Benden Weyr. Keevan is shorter than the other candidates, and is teased about this by Beterli, a boy who has stood for eight Impressions and has not been chosen. Keevan works hard but his size downgrades his abilities to most. When he overhears some of the senior dragonriders talking about dropping some of the younger candidates from the Impression, Keevan automatically thinks he will be dropped. The next day, when shoveling coal, Keevan gets in a fight with Beterli, who says he will be dropped. Keevan is badly injured and is assured by Lessa that he will have other Hatchings. When the Hatching occurs, Keevan manages to find his way to the Ground and Impresses a bronze dragon named Heth. =The Girl Who Heard Dragons= : Published as a Cheap Street book (1986) and as the cover story of The Girl Who Heard Dragons (1994 collection)\\"The Girl Who Heard Dragons\\".

ISFDB. \\"Runner of Pern\\" is set shortly before the Ninth Pass. It tells of a runner (messenger) named Tenna, who is new to the craft her family has been in for generations. After being accepted as an apprentice runner, Tenna begins her career, running from one end of Pern's Northern Continent to the other. During her first run to Fort Hold, Tenna is almost to her destination, running on the \\"trace\\" (paths marked by moss that are reserved for runners only) when a rider on a fast runner beast runs her off the trace. Tenna falls into a sticklebush, which are covered in sharp spines at this time of the year. The spines of the sticklebush can be dangerous as they can cause infections or enter the bloodstream. She manages to get to a runner station, where she recovers from the fall. After telling the manager about the incident, she gains a name: Haligon, the older of Lord Groghe's two sons. Haligon is known by the other runners at the Fort Hold Station to have used the traces before, nearly causing other accidents. After healing at the station for three days, Tenna goes to the Fort Hold Gather, where she identifies Haligon with some help from her new runner friends and by his stance (arrogant and haughty). After planning on how best to humiliate him, she walks up and punches Haligon, knocking him unconscious and landing him in a pile of dung. While walking back to her friends, speaks with one of the young men in Haligon's group, asking why she had attacked Haligon. Once back with her friends, she learns that she had actually attacked Haligon's twin brother Horon, the nice young man who spoke with her was actually Haligon. Worried that she may get in trouble, Tenna and her friends are met by Lord Groghe, who sincerely apologizes for his son's errors and advises the runners that Haligon will not use their traces any more. Tenna is then met by Haligon himself, who apologizes again for his actions and asks Tenna to be his guest at the gather. She accepts and after spending the entire gather with Haligon, begins to feel strong feelings for the man, which are returned in kind by Haligon. =Ever the Twain= : Original to the collection\\"Ever the Twain\\". ISFDB. \\"Ever the Twain\\" was the only story original to the collection. It tells of twins, Neru and Nian, who are inseparable. The brother Neru dreams of being a dragonrider; the sister Nian is more practical. The two live at a hold on Ista Island. One day, when dragons come to Search, they identify Nian as a good candidate for the queen, but she will not go without Neru. The dragons take them both on Search, along with Nian's friend Orla and another boy called Chaum. At the Weyr, Orla tells Nian that another girl, named Robina, has been promised the queen. The twins work in the infirmary for a day, but on Impression, the queen dragon hatches and Nian Impresses her and learns her name is Quinth. The two of them manage to break the egg Neru is next to, revealing a bronze dragon named Larinth, who Neru impresses. Later, in the weyrlings' barracks, N'ru tells Nian that he was upset that she was chosen on Search and he was taken along as a mere afterthought. Nian tells him that she never wanted his dream, she wanted him to be happy. They contemplate the fact that Nian and Quinth would probably be transferred to another Weyr. Quinth assures them that they will always be held together by their dragons, and that they would never be alone.

The two-lane highway travels east from SR 19 in Port Hadlock-Irondale across the Portage Canal to Indian Island and Marrowstone Island, turning north and ending at the entrance to Fort Flagler State Park. SR 116 was created in 1991 and follows the route of Flagler Road, built and paved in the 1960s. Route description SR 116 begins at an intersection with SR 19 in Port Hadlock-Irondale, located between Port Ludlow and Port Townsend. The highway travels east as Nees' Corner Road over Chimacum Creek and through the community of Port Hadlock before crossing the Portage Canal onto Indian Island. SR 116 continues east on Indian Island as Flagler Road along the coast of Oak Bay and turns north along Scow Bay onto Marrowstone Island, entering a heavily wooded area. The highway continues north through central Marrowstone Island and passes through Mystery Bay State Park before ending at the entrance to Fort Flagler State Park. Every year, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that the busiest section of the highway was its western terminus at SR 19, carrying 6,500 vehicles, while the least busiest section was the eastern terminus at Fort Flagler State Park, carrying 440 vehicles. SR 116 is designated as a part of the National Highway System between SR 19 and Indian Island. History A road connecting Fort Flagler State Park and Marrowstone Island with Indian Island and Port Hadlock-Irondale on the Olympic Peninsula has existed and been paved since the late 1960s. The roadway was codified in 1991 as SR 116, traveling east from newly created SR 19 and was formally added to the state highway system on April 1, 1992. The bridge over the Port Townsend Ship Canal, also known as the Portage Canal, was retrofitted by WSDOT in late 2007 and early 2008 to add safer railings for pedestrians.

The town is located in the Darling Downs on the New England Highway, from the state capital, Brisbane and from the nearby city of Toowoomba. In the , Crows Nest had a population of 2160 people. History Jarowair (also known as Yarowair, Yarow-wair, Barrunggam, Yarrowair, Yarowwair and Yarrow-weir) is one of the languages of the Toowoomba region. The Jarowair language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Toowoomba Regional Council, particularly Toowoomba north to Crows Nest and west to Oakey. Giabal is the Southern neighbour in Toowoomba City. Crows Nest, established on Dalla tribal lands, was declared a town in 1876. Crows Nest Post Office opened on 1 July 1878. A branch railway line from Toowoomba, which serviced a number of sawmills and a dairying district, was finished in 1886. Jimmy Crow statue, Crows Nest Centenary Park It is claimed by some that the town was named after an Aboriginal man, Jimmy Crow, who gave directions to early European settlers. He lived in a big hollow tree near the police station, which became known as Crows Nest. It became a popular overnight camp for the bullock teams hauling timber, which in turn attracted farmers and settlers. A 6-foot 6-inch high statue of Jimmy Crow was unveiled in the Centenary Park at Crows Nest on 12 July 1969 by Minister for Labour and Tourism, John Herbert. The statue was sculpted by Fred Gardiner of the Tia Art Gallery. The statue was cut from a single block of Helidon freestone and weighs over one ton. An 18-foot high hollow tree stump was also moved to Centenary Park and a fig tree was planted on top so the roots could be trained around it to form a living hollow tree. It is believed to be the only memorial in Australia to an Aboriginal person after whom a town was named. However, it is also claimed that the name derives from the indigenous name for the area Tookoogandanna, meaning \\"the home of crows\\". Some researchers acknowledge there are many possible origins of the name. Jimmy Crow Statue information In 1913, the Shire of Crows Nest was formed with the town becoming the administrative centre for the new local government area. The shire expanded in 1949 and was merged into the Toowoomba Region local government area in 2008. In the 1950s and 60s the town's population declined, together with the local industries. On Saturday 7 April 1951 Archbishop Reginald Halse dedicated a new Anglican church in Crows Nest, built from concrete blocks. Heritage listings Crows Nest has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 19 Curnow Street: Crows Nest Post Office Amenities Town facilities include a large pavilion for sports activities and other functions, showgrounds and a 25 m heated swimming pool. east of the town is the Crows Nest National Park.

Memorial Library is open Monday to Saturday; the name commemorating Jack French, a local man who was killed in World War II and was awarded the Victoria Cross for his valour in the face of the enemy. The library is located on the corner of William Street and the New England Highway and is operated by the Toowoomba Regional Council. The current library facility opened in 1996 with a major refurbishment in 2014.

While a small amount of backflow may occur ordinarily, it is usually only shown on an echocardiogram and is harmless. More pronounced regurgitation that is noticed through a routine physical examination is a medical sign of disease and warrants further investigation. If it is secondary to pulmonary hypertension it is referred to as a Graham Steell murmur. Signs and symptoms Because pulmonic regurgitation is the result of other factors in the body, any noticeable symptoms are ultimately caused by an underlying medical condition rather than the regurgitation itself. However, more severe regurgitation may contribute to right ventricular enlargement by dilation, and in later stages, right heart failure. A diastolic decrescendo murmur can sometimes be identified,( heard best) over the left lower sternal border. Causes Rheumatic heart disease, Among the causes of pulmonary insufficiency are: Pathophysiology The pathophysiology is due to diastolic pressure variations between the pulmonary artery and right ventricle, differences are often very small, but increase regurgitation. An elevation in pulmonary insufficiency due to elevated intrathoracic pressure is relevant in ventilated patients (having acute restrictive right ventricular physiology). The reasons for changes in stiffness of the right ventricle's walls are not well understood, but such stiffness is thought to increase with hypertrophy of the ventricle. Diagnosis In the diagnosis of pulmonary insufficiency both echocardiograms and EKG is used to ascertain if the individual has this condition, as well as, the use of a chest x-ray to expose enlargement of the right atrium or ventricle. Treatment In treating pulmonary insufficiency, it should be determined if pulmonary hypertension is causing the problem to therefore begin the most appropriate therapy as soon as possible (primary pulmonary hypertension or secondary pulmonary hypertension due to thromboembolism). Furthermore, pulmonary insufficiency is generally treated by addressing the underlying condition, in certain cases, the pulmonary valve may be surgically replaced.

Built in 1846, it is a heritage property under the Ontario Heritage Act. It was the last timber-frame water powered mill along the Grand River in Ontario. In 2018 the mill was dismantled by Riverside properties and is currently being rebuilt as an office complex. Location The Caledonia Mill was located on the banks of the Canadian Heritage Grand River, in Caledonia, Ontario Canada. History The Old Mill is thought to have been built . From then to 1892, it would seem the flour milling industry in Caledonia was big business but not without competition across the river or financial difficulty. Caledonia founder Ranald McKinnon's milling enterprises on the Northside by 1850 comprised a sawmill, flour mill, and woollen mill. This Northside area of mill was known to be within the Village of Oneida. James Little's Southside mill was known to be within the Village of Sunnyside. Doomed by fire and daunted by flood, McKinnon had his share of bad luck with mills. His sawmill, many times damaged by ice and shifted off its location by the 1861 flood, lasted until it burned in January 1942. The 1844 flour mill was rebuilt twice following fires in 1862 and 1876 and remained until Sept. 6, 1969 when fire struck again for the last time. The 1848 woollen mill burned and was rebuilt in 1863 but was left down after claimed arson took it in 1881, two years following McKinnon's death. The Southside mill, left free from fire and flood, withstood and still remains over 150 years later. Our concentration on the flour mills only is where the claimed big milling business of the 1860 and 70's took place. Up to then the two flour mills can only be presumed to have either been rented or managed for Little and McKinnon. Daniel McQuarrie was in partnership with McKinnon in the Northside mill from 1865 to 1869. This partnership came to a close and McQuarrie and James Thorburn bought the Southside mill known as Balmoral Mills, renaming it Grand River Mills. In 1873 William Munro joined McQuarrie and Thorburn to buy out McKinnon's flour milling business. Thus, the trio had the successful flour business in Caledonia all to themselves. The fire that required rebuilding of the Northside mill in 1876 didn't hold them back. The partnership was said to have the largest dealers in grain in the County of Haldimand. The Haldimand Atlas of 1877 also states they were turning out 1500 barrels weekly, paying out in cash a half million dollars annually, shipping mostly to Montreal where it was sold in the lower provinces of Canada and Europe. In 1877 they shipped 6000 barrels direct to Glasgow, Scotland. Employment to about 40 men added to the prosperity of the village. The Caledonia Dam was registered to them under a \\"Bargain and Sale\\" from the Haldimand Navigation Company in 1875. Purchasing and improvements cost $5,000 which allowed them to furnish water power to McKinnon's Woollen mill and a plaster mill. They were anxious to secure the erection of some other manufacturing establishment to which they would furnish water power at a reasonable rate. Things seemed to be going very well for McQuarrie, Thorburn, and Munro, according to the 1877 atlas. But in 1880 the golden years of the partnership came to an abrupt halt and they were declared bankrupt. One wonders what part the 1876 rebuilding of the Northside mill played in the financial difficulty, and or just how true the hype really was in the 1877 Haldimand Atlas account. The Northside mill was taken over by Robert Shirra. Scott Brothers It was an employee of Grand River Mills, William Scott, a younger brother-in-law of Munro, who wanted to see the milling of flour continue at the Southside mill. So he formed a partnership called Scott Brothers in which he was joined by his brothers Samuel and Hugh and his brother-in-law Simeon Hewitt, a lawyer, of Brantford. Samuel Scott and Simeon Hewitt are claimed to be the financial principals. Robert Shirra paid $14,000 for undivided half of the rights and privileges in the dam, Samuel Scott paid $9,800 for an undivided half of the rights and privileges in the dam. An agreement of January 1880 stated that William and High Scott, and Robert Shirra each of the two parties would be responsible for an undivided half of the dam, water and maintenance. In Feb. 1884 a declaration of trust stated that Samuel, William and Hugh Scott and Simeon Hewitt as owners in equal shares of Balmoral Mills including share in the dam. Samuel Scott died in 1886 and in time William became convinced that their mill might be better served another way. He canvassed many of his farmer friends and customers for miles around Caledonia persuading them to invest in shares of a new milling firm. There were successful examples in other milling establishments. And so on Feb 16, 1892 The Caledonia Milling Company Limited received its provincial charter and in March, 1892 a Bargain and Sale was recorded: \\"William Scot and wife and Hugh Scott and wife to The Caledonia Milling Co. Ltd. Supposed flouring mill and an undivided interest in Dam #5 ‚Äì 2 acres, 2 roods, 9 perches.\\" (A rood is the fourth part of an acre, and a perch is a land measure of 5 and a half yards). The Caledonia Milling Company Limited The Caledonia Milling Company (Limited) received its charter February 16, 1892 with capital stock of $25,000, divided into 500 shares of $50 each. Each shareholder was to pay 20% on or before the first day of December 1891 and the balance at six percent per annum was due within one year. The new Caledonia Milling Company (Limited) would be taking over the manufacturing and merchant milling business of the firm of Scott Brothers of the Town of Caledonia in the County of Haldimand. Farmers would be forming a joint stock company for the purpose of purchasing and taking over the business of what we know today as the Old Mill and all other businesses and property owned by Scott Brothers. William Scott would manage the business for the company. A provisional Board of Directors was set up to pay necessary preliminary and promotion expenses and then to pay Scott Brothers for the business and property within three years from the date of the incorporation. When one half of the stock was subscribed and 20% paid, application was made for the incorporation of The Caledonia Milling Company (Limited). The Provisional Board of Directors had to approve the subscriptions for stock. According to the prospectus for purchasing, the property which was located partly in the town of Caledonia and partly in the Township of Oneida consisted of a large modern and recently refitted and improved roller mill known as \\"The Balmoral Mills\\" with about three acres of land, ownership of one-half interest in the dam across the Grand River and of all rights connected, two Flour and Feed Stores together with the lands on which they stood and a large storage and shipping warehouse on the lands of the Grand Trunk Railway Company at their station in Caledonia. Caledonia, at the time was said to be the centre of one of the wealthiest and finest wheat producing districts in Canada, the water power hard to equal and the railway shipping facilities all that could be desired. The Balmoral Flouring Mill, formerly a four run stone mill of first class reputation, had a modern improved system of patent rolls with an easy capacity of 100 barrels per day. Its flour had earned a high reputation in the general markets and commanded a ready sale. At the time of incorporation it was run by water power rarely equalled in the province which would add to the profits of the business. The Village Flour and Feed Store composed part of lot number one on the west side of Argyle Street corner of Caithness St. However, the new Milling Company would own the entire building which contained the head office, and two other stores as well as the upper storeys which would be rented at remunerative prices. It was said to be one of the most valuable properties in the town. The other store known as the Caledonia Flour and Feed Store was on the east side of Wigton Street, on the second division of lot number 10, Southside of Forfar Street, and was said also to be a valuable property and a good business. There were storehouses in connection with the flour and feed stores that were capable of storing large quantities of grain too. The storehouse on lands of the Grand Trunk Railway Company was under a ground lease from Grand Trunk, had a switch from the railway in connection with it and had capital facilities for storing and shipping. Later history The Caledonia Milling Company surrendered its charter in 1964. Immediately, the mills and their adjoining properties were sold off to a company by the name of LH&J; Enterprises, made up of three gentlemen. In the early 1970s, it seems that LH&J; had sold the north mill and were leasing the south mill to Jan and Leona Buta. The north mill burned September 6, 1969. Through a change of hands, the south mill was purchased by the Grand River Conservation Authority, who were hoping to turn the site into a conservation area and park. In 1979, they put the mill up for demolition. A committee of the Golden Horseshoe Antique Society saved the mill from demolition by having it designated under the Ontario Heritage Act through the Haldimand County LACAC (Local Architectural Conservation Advisory Committee). The Golden Horseshoe Mill Committee put up a new roof, and re-painted the mill building. In 1998, The Caledonia Old Mill Corporation was formed by community members to take over the restoration of the mill. In 2017, the Mill was sold for $1 to Riverside properties who have since demolished the structure and plan to turn the site into an office complex. Construction (architecture) =Power= The Caledonia Mill was powered by three water turbines. One being significantly smaller than the others. Most lineshafting which connects leather belts and pulleys to machinery is still connected to the turbines which are currently still in place. =Equipment= The Mill contained a large amount of its machinery, as well as machinery transported from Apps Mill near Brantford, Ontario. Machinery on display in the mill prior to demolition included: Roller Mills, centrifugal flour dresser, swing-sieve sifter, several bolting reels, separators, purifiers, and bucket elevator systems. Inside Caledonia's Old Mill. =Later extensions= There have been two major additions to the Mill. The first occurred in the 1880s when a two-story L-shaped addition was added. The second was a two-story annex added in the 1900s. The three sections combine to make up the look of mill as it stands today. The Mill featured a distinctive cupola, a decorative feature rarely seen in Canadian mills of the era. The cupola gave a view of the Grand River Bridge, the only nine-span bridge in Canada. It is likely that this cupola was used to allow light to shine on lineshafting on the top floor of the building. Usage The Mill building was demolished by Riverside Properties in 2018 and work has commenced on the construction of an office complex. =Owners= The land on which the Mill once stood is now owned by Riverside Properties. The river-front park is owned by Haldimand County, and the Millrace or Head race is owned by the Grand River Conservation Authority. =Tenants= For a short time in the 2000s, the Mill was utilized by the Grand Mill Theatre Company who used the main floor as a performing arts space. Public access In 2011, the mill was included in Doors Open Haldimand County. The river-front park is utilized by many organizations because of its scenic location along the Grand River. Notable events From 2008 to 2016 the Caledonia Mill was home to one of the largest winter light displays in Southern Ontario. The display which ran each year from late November to early January attracts thousands. A large number of holiday lights are synchronized to popular holiday music. =Culture & media= The Caledonia Mill is featured on many websites including Facebook, YouTube, and on the website for the Caledonia Old Mill Corporation.

She was put into service by the Union Navy to patrol navigable waterways of the Confederacy to prevent the South from trading with other countries.  From blockade runner to Union Navy schooner  Early in the Civil War‚Äîa small, privately owned schooner -- worked out of Mobile, Alabama, under Confederate papers as a blockade runner. Few details of these operations have been found; but we do know that, on the night of 11 October 1862, she succeeded in slipping through the Federal blockade off Mobile Bay and sailed to Cuba laden with cotton. After arriving at Havana, Cuba, six days later, she delivered her cargo and filled up with lead, tin, medicine, wine, coffee, and other items needed by the South. On the evening of 14 November, as she was attempting to return to Mobile, Ariel was detected and captured by the Union screw steamer Huntsville. Sent to Key West, Florida, for adjudication, the schooner was eventually condemned as a lawful prize and was purchased by the Union Navy from the Key West prize court on 24 July 1863.  Assigned as a tender to the East Gulf Blockade  However, long before her formal acquisition, Ariel was fitted out for service in the East Gulf Blockading Squadron. On 21 December 1862, Rear Admiral Theodorus Bailey detached Acting Master's Mate William C. Molloy from the recently arrived bark Gem of the Sea and ordered him to assume command of the schooner; and she began service as a tender to the squadron flagship, the frigate St. Lawrence. For the remainder of her service in the Union Navy‚Äîsome two and one-half years‚Äîshe spent most of her time acting as a tender to a larger warship, often the flagship.  Despite her small size, Ariel wins a few prizes  While carrying out the unglamorous, monotonous, but important tasks assigned to her as she labored in her ancillary capacity, Ariel managed to take three prizes. The first came on 6 January 1863, As she was cruising off Key Biscayne Bay, Florida, about mid-afternoon, she \\". . . saw a suspicious looking craft . . .\\" sailing close to shore and immediately changed course to investigate The stranger attempted to flee; but, after a chase lasting over two and one-half hours, was overtaken and forced to heave to. The prize proved to be the sloop Good Luck, bound from New Smyrna, Florida, with a cargo of turpentine and cotton to be delivered to Nassau, New Providence Island, in the Bahamas. Her master, Edward Dexter, had already achieved considerable notoriety as a blockade runner. Since the sloop was leaky, Ariel towed her to Key West where she was turned over to the prize court. Her next score did not come until late in the year when she captured Magnolia on 16 December 1863. When Ariel took that Confederate sloop, she was in the Gulf of Mexico, some 70 miles west of Charlotte Harbor, Florida, and heading for Mobile, Alabama, with medicines and liquor. Off the mouth of the Chassahowitzka River, Florida, on 28 May 1864, two boats from Ariel captured General Finegan carrying cotton and turpentine from Crystal River, Florida, and heading for Havana. The cargo was removed and sent to Key West; but, since she was leaking, the sloop was burned.  Supporting Army operations  About this time, Ariel became active in supporting Army operations. In mid-April 1864, she assisted troops which had been ordered to reinforce Fort Myers, Florida, and she continued to conduct similar operations through the ensuing summer. For instance, on the evening of 16 September, while Ariel was acting as a tender to screw steamer Hendrick Hudson, the schooner's commanding officer, Acting Master J. Russell, organized an expedition to a point near Tampa Bay, Florida, to take possession of a large amount of cotton owned by David Hope, a renowned skipper of southern blockade runners. What cotton the expedition could carry was sent to Key West and the rest was put to the torch.  Ariel‚Äôs final days in the war before decommissioning  Thereafter, Ariel continued to serve along the Florida coast through the end of the Civil War. After the collapse of the Confederacy, she was sold at Key West on 28 June 1865 to a John Curry  References  * Category:Ships of the Union Navy Category:Gunboats of the United States Navy Category:Schooners of the United States Navy Category:Tenders of the United States Navy Category:American Civil War patrol vessels of the United States ","title":"USS Ariel (1862)"},{"id":"13716739","text":"Reeve Township is one of ten townships in Daviess County, Indiana.

The 19th-century romantic period saw the largest development of this genre, with the emergence in particular of The Five, a group of composers associated with Mily Balakirev, and of the more German style of Pyotr Tchaikovsky. Early history In the period of Muscovy (12831547), a distinct line was formed between the sacred music of the Orthodox Church and that of secular music used for entertainment. The former draws its tradition from the Byzantine Empire, with key elements being used in Russian Orthodox bell ringing, as well as choral singing. Neumes were developed for musical notation, and as a result several examples of medieval sacred music have survived to this day, among them two stichera composed by Tsar Ivan IVMarina Ritzarev. Eighteenth-century Russian music. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2006. , in the 16th century. One of Russia's earliest music theorists was the Ukrainian Nikolay Diletsky (c. 1630, Kiev - after 1680, Moscow). Although several of his compositions survive, Diletsky's fame rests chiefly on his composition treatise, Grammatika musikiyskago peniya (A Grammar of Music[al Singing]), which was the first of its kind in Russia; there are three surviving versions of this work, of which the earliest dates from 1677. Diletsky's followers included Vasily Titov, whose most enduring composition was the prayer Mnogaya leta (–ú–Ω–æ–≥–∞—è –ª–µ—Ç–∞), or Bol'shoe mnogoletie (–ë–æ–ª—å—à–æ–µ –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ–ª–µ—Ç–∏–µ), which was sung well beyond his time possibly because its relatively simple polyphony was more in line with the ideals of Classical music era. It was sung in Russian churches up to the October Revolution.Dolskaya-Ackerly: p. 220. 18th and 19th century Nikolai Rimsky- Korsakov, a prominent Russian composer of 19th century (Portrait by Valentin Serov) In the 18th century, Peter I brought in reforms introducing western music fashions to Russia. During the subsequent reign of Empresses Elisabeth and Catherine, the Russian imperial court attracted many prominent musicians, many from Italy.\\"Russian Music before Glinka: A Look from the Beginning of the Third Millennium.\\" Marina Ritzarev (Rytsareva), Bar-Ilan University They brought with them Italian traditions of opera and classical music in general, to inspire future generations of Russian composers. A number of composers received training in Italy or from these recent Italian emigres and composed vocal and instrumental works in the Italian Classical tradition popular in the day. These include ethnic Ukrainian composers Dmitri Bortniansky, Maksim Berezovsky and Artem Vedel who not only composed masterpieces of choral music but also included operas, chambers works and symphonic works. The first great Russian composer to exploit native Russian music traditions into the realm of Secular music was Mikhail Glinka (1804‚Äì1857), who composed the early Russian language operas Ivan Susanin and Ruslan and Lyudmila. They were neither the first operas in the Russian language nor the first by a Russian, but they gained fame for relying on distinctively Russian tunes and themes and being in the vernacular. Russian folk music became the primary source for the younger generation composers. A group that called itself \\"The Mighty Five\\", headed by Mily Balakirev (1837‚Äì1910) and including Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov (1844‚Äì1908), Modest Mussorgsky (1839‚Äì81), Alexander Borodin (1833‚Äì87) and C√©sar Cui (1835‚Äì1918), proclaimed its purpose to compose and popularize Russian national traditions in classical music. Among the Mighty Five's most notable compositions were the operas The Snow Maiden (Snegurochka), Sadko, Boris Godunov, Prince Igor, Khovanshchina, and symphonic suite Scheherazade. Many of the works by Glinka and the Mighty Five were based on Russian history, folk tales and literature, and are regarded as masterpieces of romantic nationalism in music. This period also saw the foundation of the Russian Musical Society (RMS) in 1859, led by composer-pianists Anton (1829‚Äì94) and Nikolay Rubinstein (1835‚Äì81). The Mighty Five was often presented as the Russian Music Society's rival, with the Five embracing their Russian national identity and the RMS being musically more conservative. However the RMS founded Russia's first Conservatories in St Petersburg and in Moscow: the former trained the great Russian composer Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky (1840‚Äì93), best known for ballets like Swan Lake, Sleeping Beauty, and The Nutcracker. He remains Russia's best- known composer outside Russia. Easily the most famous successor in his style is Sergei Rachmaninoff (1873‚Äì1943), who studied at the Moscow Conservatory (where Tchaikovsky himself taught). Alexander Glazunov also took this romantic style. The late 19th and early 20th century saw the third wave of Russian classics: Igor Stravinsky (1882‚Äì1971), Alexander Scriabin (1872‚Äì1915), Sergei Prokofiev (1891‚Äì1953) and Dmitri Shostakovich (1906‚Äì1975). They were experimental in style and musical language. Some of them emigrated after the Russian revolution, though Prokofiev eventually returned and contributed to Soviet music as well. 20th century: Soviet music After the Russian Revolution, Russian music changed dramatically. The early 1920s were the era of avant-garde experiments, inspired by the \\"revolutionary spirit\\" of the era. New trends in music (like music based on synthetic chords) were proposed by enthusiastic clubs such as Association for Contemporary Music.Amy Nelson. Music for the Revolution: Musicians and Power in Early Soviet Russia. Penn State University Press, 2004. 346 pages. In the 1930s, under the regime of Joseph Stalin, music was forced to be contained within certain boundaries of content and innovation. Classicism was favoured, and experimentation discouraged.Soviet Music and Society under Lenin and Stalin: The Baton and Sickle. Edited by Neil Edmunds. Routledge, 2009. Pages: 264. (A notable example: Shostakovich's veristic opera Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District was denounced in Pravda newspaper as \\"formalism\\" and soon removed from theatres for years). The music patriarchs of the era were Prokofiev, Shostakovich and Aram Khachaturian. With time, a wave of younger Soviet composers, such as Georgy Sviridov, Alfred Schnittke, and Sofia Gubaidulina took the forefront due to the rigorous Soviet education system. The Union of Soviet Composers was established in 1932 and became the major regulatory body for Soviet music. 21st century: Modern Russian music The profile of \\"Classical\\" or concert hall music has to a considerable degree been eclipsed by on one hand the rise of commercial popular music in Russia, and on the other its own lack of promotion since the collapse of the USSR.See Richard Taruskin \\"Where is Russia's New Music?\\", reprinted in On Russian Music. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2009: p. 381 Yet a number of composers born in the 1950s and later have made some impact, notably Leonid Desyatnikov who became the first composer in decades to have a new opera commissioned by the Bolshoi Theatre (The Children of Rosenthal, 2005), and whose music has been championed by Gidon Kremer and Roman Mints. Meanwhile, Sofia Gubaidulina, amongst several former-Soviet composers of her generation, continues to maintain a high profile outside Russia composing several prestigious and well-received works including \\"In tempus praesens\\" (2007) for the violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter.

Many Vii titles and similar games appear on these consoles. However, these consoles' controllers do not have true motion sensors as the Vii does (with the exception of the Wireless Air 60), so the controls are simplified to the point where any motion just triggers a press of the A button.

Directed by Andrew Lawrence, the film was released to video-on-demand on July 10, 2020. Plot Jack Reese (Adam Copeland) is a professional thief deep in debt. Darius Grouch (Kelsey Grammer) offers to forgive Reese's debt if Reese commits a seemingly impossible robbery for him. The target is a \\"money plane\\" ‚Äî a futuristic airborne casino filled with the underworld's most dangerous criminals. Grouch threatens Reese's family to ensure that he will attempt the heist. Cast * Adam Copeland as Jack Reese * Kelsey Grammer as Darius Emmanuel Grouch III, aka \\"The Rumble\\" * Thomas Jane as Harry Greer * Denise Richards as Sarah Peters * Katrina Norman as Isabella Voltaic * Patrick Lamont Jr. as Trey Peterson * Joey Lawrence as The Concierge * Matthew Lawrence as The Cowboy Production Inspired by heist movies such as Ocean's Eleven, airplane movies such as Con Air, and their experiences in Las Vegas, producers Switzer and Konney turned to Andrew Lawrence. Lawrence proposed an airplane casino movie, which Switzer and Konney agreed to fund after Lawrence wrote a screenplay. After securing Adam Copeland for the role of Jack Reese, the producers cast Thomas Jane as Reese's mentor. Kelsey Grammer was their first casting choice for Darius Grouch, though they did not expect him to accept the role. To their surprise, Grammer accepted, later saying that the role \\"seemed like a fun, mustache-twirling kind of character.\\" Principal photography began in October 2019 and continued through late December. After plans to film in Romania and Toronto proved unworkable, the production moved to Baton Rouge. The project's low budget and rushed schedule frequently required Lawrence to improvise and to adjust shooting based on which sets were available: \\"We were literally building the plane set while we were shooting ... We picked corners of the set that were built, and shot in those corners. We had to do that all the time,\\" he said. After post-production early in the year, the film was released in July of 2020. Reception Money Plane received an overall negative critical reception. , the film holds a 25% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on twelve reviews with an average rating of 3.94/10. The Daily Beast described Money Plane as \\"the dumbest movie of 2020\\". The Action Elite gave the film 2.5 stars out of 5 and called it \\"the kind of movie that will likely be forgotten about within a matter of weeks\\". A review from Decider said that it was \\"the best and worst of what a bad movie experience can be\\".

He was not classically trained as a chef but worked after school at a neighborhood restaurant in his hometown. O'Connell holds an undergraduate degree in drama from the Catholic University of America and he studied at George Washington University. The Inn at Little Washington Along with his now former business and romantic partner, Reinhardt Lynch, he began a catering business in 1972 in Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains. In 1978, O'Connell and Lynch opened the Inn at Little Washington in an abandoned gas station. Opening first for friends and acquaintances on January 28, 1978, then officially to the public on February 1, 1978, the Inn at Little Washington was met with immediate success and notoriety despite antagonism from many locals. Three weeks after opening, a food critic for The Washington Star, John Rosson, visited the Inn for dinner after the insistence of one of his loyal readers. Familiar with Rappahannock County, Rosson accepted the challenge to visit the new restaurant in the sleepy town of Washington, VA, located 67 miles west of the younger but more recognizable Washington D.C. Upon visiting for the first time, he was amazed by what he experienced. To be certain that it was more than just a \\"fluke\\" or a \\"series of fortunate events,\\" Rosson would return the next week. Upon doing so, equally astonished by the depth and breadth of his experience, he thought it best to introduce himself, despite regarding his anonymity as a food writer as a well-guarded secret. The critic had met his match at least in terms of his ability of uncovering any weak underside of a fledgling new entity, especially one centered in the midst of a sparsely populated village of less than 300 residents. By introducing himself to the new chef and proprietor, he gave a not-so-subtle warning that was more prophetic than conciliatory: \\"I am going to write a story about you that is going to change your life. You are going to need to hire someone full time just to answer your phone!\\"In April, 1978, John Rosson's article was printed, proclaiming Patrick O'Connell's Inn at Little Washington as \\"the best restaurant within 150 miles of Washington D.C.\\" The Inn has won the Mobil Travel Guide‚Äôs Five-Star Awards for its restaurant and accommodations for 14 years. In 2018, the Inn received a coveted three-star rating from the Michelin Guide. The International Herald Tribune rated it as one of the Top Ten Best Restaurants in the World. The Zagat Survey for Washington, D.C. rated it number one in all categories for 14 consecutive years. Awards and recognition O'Connell was one of the first American chefs courted by the France-based Relais & Chateaux. He is recognized as one of their \\"Grands Chefs\\" (formerly the designation was \\"Relais Gourmands\\" referring to establishments of two Michelin Star quality or better, among the very best in their country). He has been called \\"The Pope of American Cuisine,\\" and anyone who has been invited to dine in the kitchen is welcomed with the pageantry (and incense) of a religious ceremony. He has won numerous awards including Outstanding Chef in America in 2001 and Best Chef in the Mid-Atlantic region in 1993, both awarded by the James Beard Foundation. In 2019, he was awarded their Lifetime Achievement Award. He is a member of the American Culinary Federation and was inducted into the ACF Hall of Fame in 2009. In 2019, O'Connell was awarded the National Humanities Medal.

His Ah Louis Store building is on the National Register of Historic Places. Ah Louis was a central figure in the development of the Central Coast of California, serving as an organizer of Chinese laborers during the construction of the Pacific Coast Railway's Avila‚ÄîPort Harford spur and the tunnels through Cuesta Grade over the Santa Lucia Range.  History  Ah Louis traveled from his home in Guangdong Province, (today's) Greater Taishan Region, China,Wong, H[enry]. K[wock]. 1987. Gum Sahn Yun/Gold Mountain Men. San Francisco: Fong Brothers Printing. Pp. 4 & 42. and arrived in California between 1856 and 1861 in order to strike it rich during the California Gold Rush. Unsuccessful at mining, he became a laborer working in Corvallis, Oregon and points further south. Wong eventually settled in San Luis Obispo, California in 1870, and was working as a cook in a hotel there in 1871. Soon he began to organize work-crews to help construct the Pacific Coast Railroad, delivering 160 Chinese Americans from San Francisco by schooner. In 1877, Ah Louis was awarded two large road construction contracts, including a road from Paso Robles, California to Cambria, California (now the westernmost portion of State Route 46) and the first stages of a road connecting San Luis Obispo to Paso Robles, California (now referred to as Cuesta Grade, a portion of which is still drivable and is labeled off the freeway as \\"Old Stagecoach Road\\" and a portion of U.S. Route 101). In 1884, Wong received the contract to construct the four Cuesta Grade tunnels for the Southern Pacific Railroad's coast route, requiring the provision of 2,000 laborers and taking ten years to complete. =Store= Seeing a need for the California Central Coast's Chinese community, Ah opened a small East Asian mercantile in 1874, the first in San Luis Obispo County, from which he sold goods, including rice, rum, and opium (opium use was legal until 1915). The wooden structure was replaced by a sturdy brick building in 1885, made from bricks from his own brickyard, at 800 Palm Street on the corner of Chorro Street in downtown San Luis Obispo, marking where San Luis Obispo's Chinatown once stood. The shop is currently owned by Dr. William Watson, MD, Ah Louis's great-grandson, and the ground floor is now operated as a retail store. The Ah Louis store has been designated as a California State Historical Landmark number 802; and recognized by the United States National Park Service being also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Family Ah Louis married his first wife in China in 1860. She was in California in 1868, but returned to China about 1873. Wong last saw her in China in 1888. The 1880 census shows a wife living with him, but no children are shown. In May 1889, Ah Louis married Eng Gon Ying (Silver Dove) in San Francisco. Together they raised their eight children (five sons and three daughters) in their residence above the Ah Louis Store. ;Louis Children :* Lena Ah Tye Louis (1891‚Äì1975) :* Young \\"Cholly\\" Jung Yeong Louis (1893‚Äì1988) :* Mae Ah May Louis (1895‚Äì1988) :* Walter Ah Sing Louis (1897‚Äì1993) :* George Ah Him Louis (1899‚Äì1993) :* Helen Ah Heong Louis (1903‚Äì1994) :* Fred Ah Yuey Louis (1907‚Äì1994) :* Howard \\"Toby\\" Ah Toa Wong Louis (1908‚Äì2008) In 1909 Eng Gon Ying Louis was murdered by Willie Wong, Ah Louis' son from his first marriage. Willie Louis was born about 1868. He testified in court he was born in California, that he went back to China with his mother about 1873, that he returned to California about 1893, that he made several trips back and forth, and that his latest arrival was about 1905. He was executed at San Quentin Prison in 1912. In December 1932, accompanied by sons Fred and Howard, Ah Louis returned to China, intending to visit family and to follow the tradition of dying where one was born. Disappointed with the lack of progress and modern technology and the high rate of banditry, Ah decided to return to San Luis Obispo. He died on December 18, 1936. The youngest and last surviving of Ah Louis' children, Howard Louis, who had a degree in economics and fought with Gen. George Patton, continued to run the store until the late 1990s and died on August 15, 2008, at the age of 100. The store was damaged from the San Simeon earthquake in 2003 and afterwards condemned by the City of San Luis Obispo. Around this time, the store was fully acquired by William J. Watson, MD, who restored the building and its interior. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.

Founded in 1994, the company manufactures its own cheeses and sells other imported and domestic cheese and fine artisan foods. Its own cheeses include Red Hawk and Mt. Tam (named after Mount Tamalpais). The company operates a storefront in the Ferry Building of San Francisco. Founders Peggy Smith and Sue Conley worked for years in the kitchens of the Bay Area, and Alice Waters' Chez Panisse, where Peggy worked for many years, is among many Bay Area establishments to incorporate cheeses from Cowgirl Creamery into its menu.  Cheesemaking  St Pat, a spring seasonal cheese Cowgirl Creamery crafts its own cheeses using organic milk from the neighboring Straus Family Creamery, as well as John Tavernas' dairy. Mount Tam, a triple cream cheese similar to Explorateur, and Red Hawk, also a triple cream, with a washed rind, are the more well-known of their aged cheeses, but the company also makes four seasonal soft cheeses: Pierce Point, Saint Pat, Chimney Rock, and Devil's Gulch. Only two of their aged cheeses are in a slightly different format: Inverness looks like an aged goat cheese but is actually made with cow's milk, and is only available at Cowgirl's stores due to a short shelf life; Wagon Wheel, which is a semi-firm cheese designed to melt, is made in 25-pound wheels. Their most recent cheese is the semi-firm Hopalong. They very, very rarely make an unpublicized aged cheese, Sir Francis Drake, which is the same size, shape, and base as the Mount Tam, but is washed in Muscat wine and topped with macerated currants and has a stronger, sweeter flavor. Their aged cheeses are named after landmarks or other features local to the Marin Headlands. Cowgirl Creamery also makes fresh cheeses: a fromage blanc and a cr√®me fraiche and recently resumes making their clabbered cottage cheese; they no longer make Niloufer's Panir (which is named for chef Niloufer Ichaporia King).  History  The company was started in 1994. In addition to its San Francisco store and Sidekick Cafe, the original creamery in Point Reyes Station includes a store and cantina, and a storefront in the Penn Quarter neighborhood of Washington, D.C. (where founders Sue Conley and Peggy Smith are from) was open from 2006 to 2013. On May 17, 2016, the company announced that they had been acquired by the publicly traded Swiss dairy company Emmi AG.  Popular culture  Cowgirl Creamery was referenced in episode 6.1 of the popular TV sitcom Will & Grace, \\"Dames at Sea\\", in the scene where Will is trying to ease the mind of Jack in suspicions of a drunken rendezvous with each other. It has also been mentioned as being a favorite among several notable celebrities.

It was ruled by the Saxon comital House of Regenstein, named after their residence at Regenstein Castle near Blankenburg north of the Harz mountain range.  History  Ruins of Regenstein Castle The progenitor of the family, Count Poppo I of Blankenburg (c. 1095 ‚Äì 1161 or 1164) probably was related to the Rhenish ReginbodonidReginbodonen dynasty of Archbishop Siegfried of Mainz (d. 1084), a cadet branch of the Franconian Conradines. His uncle Reinhard of Blankenburg was Bishop of Halberstadt from 1107 onwards and provided him with large estates in the Eastphalian Harzgau region between the Ilse and Bode rivers. Poppo was first documented as comes in an 1128 deed, serving the Saxon duke Lothair of Supplinburg and his Welf successors. His son Conrad was the first descendant to call himself Comes de Regenstein in 1162, while his brother Siegfried continued to rule as Count of Blankenburg. After the deposition of the Saxon duke Henry the Lion in 1180, the Regenstein counts were temporarily arrested by the forces of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, but were reconciled with the Hohenstaufen monarch soon after. After a lengthy feud Heimburg Castle, built about 1170 by King Henry IV and soon after devastated during the Saxon Rebellion, was acquired by the Regenstein counts in the early 14th century. The Regenstein-Heimburg branch re-united the Regenstein and Blankenburg estates in 1343, under the rule of the most renowned Count Albert II (1310‚Äì49),Albrecht II. von Regenstein who since the 1330s was frequently in dispute with the leaders of the surrounding estates like the Halberstadt bishops and the Abbesses of Quedlinburg; he was finally assassinated by the henchmen of Bishop Albert II of Halberstadt. These tales were romanticised in the ballad The Robber Count () by Gottfried August B√ºrger, melodized by Johann Philipp Kirnberger and the novel of the same name by Julius Wolff.Julius Wolff In the 15th century the comital family finally relocated its seat to Blankenburg Castle; the Regenstein fortress lapsed and was left to ruin. In order to gain greater independence from the Halberstadt bishops, the counts turned Protestant in 1539. The last scion of the comital family, Count John Ernest, died in 1599. With Blankenburg, the County of Regenstein fell back to the Prince-Bishopric of Halberstadt. Shortly thereafter Blankenburg and Regenstein were separated: Regenstein remained with the secularised Principality of Halberstadt, while the remaining County of Blankenburg was annexed and held by the Dukes of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel.

Greenson (born Romeo Samuel Greenschpoon, September 20, 1911 ‚Äì November 24, 1979) was a prominent American psychiatrist and psychoanalyst. Greenson is famous for being Marilyn Monroe's psychiatrist, and was the basis for Leo Rosten's 1963 novel, Captain Newman, M.D. The book was later made into a movie starring Gregory Peck as Greenson's character. There has been much conjecture, by investigating officers, press and the public, about Greenson's involvement in a possible cover-up concerning the circumstances of Monroe's death.M. Schneider, Marilyn's Last Sessions (2011) Greenson was well known for his early work on returning WWII soldiers suffering from Post Traumatic Stress. He also had other famous clients, such as Tony Curtis, Frank Sinatra, and Vivien Leigh. Greenson and his wife, Hildi Greenson, were the darlings of the Southern California psychoanalytic community, intellectuals and with certain notables in the entertainment industry. They were good friends with Anna Freud, Fawn Brodie and Margaret Mead. Biography He graduated from Columbia University in New York City. In a time when Jews were not readily accepted into American medical schools, he studied medicine in Switzerland, Bern and was analysed by Wilhelm Stekel, a distinguished if controversial student of Sigmund Freud, and again by Otto Fenichel and Frances Deri in Los Angeles.M. Schneider, Marilyn's Last Sessions (2011) He published psychoanalytic material often dealing with analyzability, beginning of analysis, interpretations, dreams, working through, acting out, countertransference, and termination.

He writes mostly in Afrikaans and has won a number of prizes for his work. Biography Fran√ßois Bloemhof was born in the town of Paarl in the Cape Province, South Africa. In Grade 9 his English teacher awarded him 97% for a short story, ‚ÄúMurder by the Number‚Äù, which he considers the start of his writing career. While in Grade 11 he won the Amstel Playwright of the Year Award with the play A Social Gathering. Since then he has become the only author in the world to write so extensively and successfully for the adult, teenage and youth markets. He didn‚Äôt attempt to write a novel until some years after leaving school, chiefly because he believed there was no room for ‚Äúhis type of story‚Äù in what was then a rather conservative Afrikaans market. Die Nag Het Net Een Oog was a Gothic novel set in a small (and totally un-Gothic) rural community, and with this in 1991 he won the De Kat Prize, at that time the country‚Äôs most prestigious literary award. Many books for adults followed, as did numerous awards and nominations. Bloemhof‚Äôs adult work contains thriller, supernatural and more conventional dramatic elements. He has also written a secret agent (Rooi Luiperd) series as well as one starring a female detective, Alma van der Pool, both being the first of their kind in the Afrikaans publishing field. To date he has also written a cabaret, the filmed screenplay Double Echo, award-winning stage plays and radio dramas and serials. He also writes for teenagers, winning several prizes in competitions (including Sanlam, MML and FNB) with books like Slinger-slinger, Die Dae Toe Ek Elvis Was, Stad aan die Einde van die W√™reld and Nie Vir Kinders Nie. A ‚Äúscary story‚Äù series for young readers, Rillers (translated in English as Chillers), comprises eight titles and were regular winners in the annual ATKV-Veertjie Competition, in which readers of the relevant age evaluate the books. The author‚Äôs latest youth series, a trilogy, is called Spooksoeker. Bloemhof was the first Afrikaans author to publish a comic strip series, the Agent Snoet books in which a hapless secret agent is aided by his faithful yet domineering Siamese cat, Felino. World-firsts by this author include an interactive newspaper serial (in Rapport); a youth novel with its own PC game; a Flipom, which is a two-in-one book with two covers that can be read first from either side and with both stories having the same characters; and a novel including an author-composed soundtrack CD performed by renowned South African musicians and singers. Bloemhof has now published over 100 books for different age groups.

It hosts live music productions, musicals, and theatrical plays. History In 1938, Lubbock businessmen Joe H. Bryant, M. A. Sanders, and Glenn Woody built Lubbock's first suburban neighborhood movie theater. The Art Deco style theater was designed by architect Robert Maxey. The theater was built as a \\"second-run\\" movie theater and boasted a seating capacity of 720. It also had \\"washed air\\" cooling and a marquee with over 750 feet of neon lighting. The Cactus remained opened for twenty years. However, by 1957, there were seventeen movie theaters in the city. The competition from the other traditional theaters and the popularity of six new drive-in theaters forced the older Cactus out of business. The Cactus closed on May 6, 1958. Remodeled theater As part of the development of Lubbock's Depot District in 1993, Don Caldwell, along with a group of investors, bought the Cactus Theater and refurbished it into a live performance/movie theater. The refurbished theater retains its original balcony, slope, and stage. The seating was replaced with four hundred modern seats. The old projection booth was redesigned with spotlights and a state-of- the-art sound and light package. The theater's West Texas heritage was recognized with murals on both walls, painted by artist John Russell Thomasson, depicting Caprock Canyon. The theater now features shows such as Nostalgia Nights, The Cactus Family Christmas Celebration, Gospel Night, Cactus Cuties local artist showcase, new artist showcase, and The JD's, a doo wop group founded by the late Don Allison, a musician and producer at the Cactus. Artists like Joe Ely, B. J. Thomas, Gary Morris, Jerry Jeff Walker, and The Maines Brothers Band have played at the venue. The theater features live theatrical plays and music including Fiddler on the Roof, The Odd Couple, Jesus Christ Superstar, Buddy - The Buddy Holly Story, The Rainmaker, Hello Dolly!, Oklahoma!, and more. The Cactus Theater has also played host to several debut musical plays from local writers, such as Heavenly Country and Holy Rock ‚Äòn Rollers. Cactus Cuties No longer singing as a group, the girls of The Cactus Cuties were one of the many popular acts at the Cactus Theater. These singing girls were coached and managed by Cameron Caldwell at Terri Caldwell Music. Originally, the Cactus Cuties were Baylee Barrett, Blaire Elbert, Andi Kitten, and Madeline Powell. In the summer of 2007 the Cuties were invited to guest star on Disney Channel's \\"Cory in The House\\" which aired around the same time their first YouTube video went viral in early 2008. The video featured five Cactus Cuties (one of whom no longer sung with the group) singing their own rendition of the \\"Star-Spangled Banner\\" and captured the hearts of over three million people in one month. Their unique and amazing harmonies as well as their character and charm made the girls very popular on the internet.Cactus Cuties site (accessed 2010-10-24). As of 2017, the video has over 10 million views. The Cactus Theater continues to host programs such as the Holly Ave and the Cactus Kids aimed toward developing young talent and upcoming artists. The Cactus Cuties performed on The Rachael Ray Show, Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon, National Day of Prayer at Cannon House Office Building in the District of Columbia, and Oprah Winfrey's Search for the Most Talented Kids.Search for the Most Talented Kids, oprah.com Their singing is also available on a compact disc and a DVD both titled Cactus Cuties: Live at the Cactus 2009. For personal reasons, Andi Kitten decided it was time to leave the group in September 2010. Makenzie Patton joined the remaining three girls shortly thereafter.

It was purchased by the Capital Regional District in 1975 and has been directly operated by its Environmental Sustainability Department since 1985. It is located in the District of Saanich on top of a hill, between Victoria and Sidney, at the end of Hartland Avenue. There is a public waste drop-off area, a recycling centre, a household hazardous waste collection facility and an electricity generating station that utilizes landfill gas as a fuel source. It has won several international environmental awards.Hartland Landfill Site Rehabilitation At current disposal rates it is estimated that the landfill will be full by 2045. Cycling, Hiking, Tours & Sights There are varying levels of mountain biking trails for people who wish to use ATB, All Terrain Bikes. These paths are located outside the fenced garbage disposal and processing areas. The cycling, or hiking areas have park signs and water hose stations to clean cycling equipment . The mountain bike and hiking trails are in the land areas within the Mount Work Regional Park boundaries. Abundant birds in the Hartland area include raven, bald eagle and several species of hawk. The CRD conducts public tours of the Hartland landfill facility, on the subject of waste management, recycling, and capture of waste gas as a supplementary source of electricity generation . History The Hartland landfill started as a private dump site in the 1950s. The Hartland landfill was bought by the Capital Regional District in 1975. As it began to fill up, construction began on phase two in 1997. This involved blasting out the side of a rock face and covering phase one with dirt and vegetation. This procedure is still taking place. In 2003 the Hartland landfill installed an electricity generating station, to create electricity from the methane gas that was being collected from the decomposing refuse. This generating station now creates 1.6 megawatts of electricity, enough to power about 1,600 homes. After analysis of its garbage composition, the landfill found that 30 percent of its garbage was organic in nature. This has resulted in calls for local food waste collection and composting, which is currently done in some of the region's municipalities either as a regular service or as a pilot project. Procedures and policies The Hartland landfill is a sanitary landfill, which means that it has a comprehensive system of environmental controls and monitoring programs to mitigate its effects on the environment. Landfill gas created by the decomposition is collected by gas wells and is used for generating electricity. Leachate is collected in two lagoons and it is disposed of through the sanitary sewer system. The landfill has had challenges with the introduction of the non-native species of plants and animals, including the European wall lizard. The Hartland landfill operating bylaw prohibits scavenging of any kind. This is due to safety liability. The Hartland landfill gives free public tours.

She was put into service by the Union Navy to patrol navigable waterways of the Confederacy to prevent the South from trading with other countries.  From blockade runner to Union Navy schooner  Nita, a wooden sidewheel steamer built in 1856 at Mobile, Alabama, was captured while carrying food and medicine from Havana, Cuba, toward Mobile, Alabama, by Union blockading schooner 17 August 1863. Taken to Key West, Florida, under a prize crew, Nita was condemned by a prize court; transferred to the Navy 10 September 1863; and commissioned 8 January 1864, Actg. Vol. Lt. Robert B. Smith in command.  Assigned to the East Gulf Blockade  Assigned to the East Gulf Blockading Squadron, Nita patrolled the west coast of Florida for the remainder of the Civil War, operating primarily between the mouth of the Suwannee River and the Anclote Keys. On the morning of 24 February, Lt. Smith, alerted by Union intelligence agents in Cuba, spotted steamer Nan Nan, laden with cotton, attempting to slip to sea through the east pass of the Suwannee River. Nita at once gave chase. Twice she ran aground in the shallow coastal waters, but forced Nan Nan to throw her cotton overboard in attempting to escape. The blockade runner then stranded on the beach where her crew burned her to prevent capture. Boats from Nita took her next prize, schooner Three Brothers, 11 April, at the mouth of the Homosassa River after a chase of three hours. The schooner had been attempting to slip into the river laden with supplies from Havana. Nita took her final ship on the morning of 24 October when two of her boats boarded abandoned and burning schooner Unknown off Clearwater Harbor. They promptly put out the fire and sent the prize to Key West, Florida, for adjudication.  Destroying the salt works near Tampa, Florida  On 12 November Nita and steamed to Tampa Bay on a reconnaissance mission and landed a party to destroy Confederate salt works near Rocky Point, Florida. However, the sailors were driven back by Southern cavalry. Early on 3 December, Nita and four other Union ships returned and destroyed the salt works.  Nita‚Äôs final days at war and final decommissioning  The efficiency of the Union Navy throughout the war made prizes scarce during the conflict‚Äôs final months. Nita continued patrolling along the coast until she decommissioned at Key West 3 May 1865, and was sold at public auction the same day.

Arilda was a virgin martyr who, according to John Leland, was slain by a youth named Municus when she refused to have sex with him. Two churches in Gloucestershire are dedicated to Arilda, one at Oldbury-on-Severn near her traditional home, a second (\\"St Arild's Church\\") at Oldbury-on-the-Hill. Both places were called \\"Aldberie\\" at the time of the Domesday Book, suggesting that their names may be derived from the saint. Leland claims that Arilda lived in Kington, a hamlet in the parish of Oldbury-on-Severn, where there is a holy well bearing Arilda's name. The waters from the well are said to run red with her blood, though a more prosaic explanation is the presence of a red algae of the Hildenbrandia genus. There was a shrine to Arilda at St Peter's Abbey, Gloucester, which is now Gloucester Cathedral, but it was destroyed after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Notes  References  * G.

Billy Green was born February 4, 1794 in the Saltfleet Township in Upper Canada, and died March 15, 1877. His father was a New Jersey Loyalist named Ensign Adam Green. His mother, Martha Green, died after a year or so after Billy was born, so he was raised by his oldest sister. He was the last born of the eleven children in his family. According to local tradition, he is believed the first white child born in the vicinity of Stoney Creek, Ontario.1813 Billy Green on Battle of Stoney Creek The War of 1812 Billy Green's contribution to the battle Photograph taken of a painting in the house William Green built, and occupied by his great, great granddaughter Barbara Green. Artist unknown. On June 5, 1813 Billy's sister reported to him that her husband, Isaac Corman, had been captured by the Americans, who held him near the beach on Lake Ontario. Corman convinced some American officers that he was a cousin of William Henry Harrison, an American politician (and later president) who was major-general of US troops in the north-west. The officers released Isaac, who then requested the counter-sign so that he could get past the American sentries and go home. They gave it to him‚Äîit was Wil-Hen-Har, after the major general, and released him. Billy caught up to Corman and got the password. The Americans, realizing their mistake, promptly caught up to Corman and recaptured him. Billy took his brother Levi's horse \\"Tip\\" and rode to Burlington Heights to warn the British. The British, who had recently themselves spied on the Americans, assumed Billy was a spy. After questioning him, Lieutenant-Colonel John Harvey decided he was not a spy. He realized that the password and Billy's intimate knowledge of the countryside would help Harvey's planned surprise attack on the American camp at night. He gave Billy a swordThe sword is held by the Stoney Creek Historical Society, Accession number 012-017-003. and asked him to guide the troops. They left just before midnight, with Harvey in charge. They first encountered American sentries at Davis' tavern at Big Creek (now Red Hill Creek), who fired their muskets and dispersed. They encountered more sentries along the way, in the woods and near a church. Billy dispatched one of the sentries with his sword, while giving him the countersign. As they snuck up to the American camp they saw fires set by the American troops, on the other side of a lane. Billy was present at the battle but was not injured. The monument, erected on the battlefield in 1913, at the centenary of the Battle, is inscribed Scout Green.Battlefield House Museum - Billy Green and the Battle of Stoney Creek - June 6, 1813 - Stoney Creek, Ontario, Canada Controversy and proof Various accounts have greatly embellished this version of events. For example, one account called Green the \\"Paul Revere of Canada,\\" and claimed that he \\"sighted the American army massing below the mountain at Stoney Creek\\" and \\"felt it his duty to inform the English troops of their nearness\\".Anon. \\"Descendants of Billy the Scout Recall his Deeds\\", Hamilton Spectator, March 12, 1938. This is a fabrication, as the British knew exactly where the Americans were, and knew they were being pursued by them. Such easily demonstrable inventions have fueled commentary that the whole story is a legend, raising substantial questions as to the authenticity of the accepted historical record regarding Billy Green's purported actions and presence at the Battle of Stoney Creek, most notably by journalist James E. Elliott.Strange Fatality: The Battle of Stoney Creek, 1813 A shorter version of Elliott's analysis of the historical record was published in The Hamilton Spectator in December 2009.Is the Billy Green Story Balderdash? The sword Lieutenant-Colonel John Harvey gave to Billy Green the Scout before the Battle of Stoney Creek, June 5, 1813 Articles published in 2011 and 2013 rebut questions raised about Green's actions at Stoney Creek. The first is an articleGreen, Philip E. J. 2013. \\"Billy Green the Scout and the Battle of Stoney Creek (June 5-6, 1813)\\", War of 1812 Magazine, Issue 20, May 2013. in the War of 1812 Magazine, in which author Philip Green reviews primary and secondary source evidence and material cultural evidence from the time of the battle. The primary source evidence consists mostly of written correspondence from British officers and American officers in the periods leading up to and immediately after the battle. The article compared the correspondence with accounts by Billy Green, and found a close correspondence. The conclusion from the article is that, by the standard of evidence used to accept Laura Secord as historical fact, the story of Billy Green must be accepted as historical fact.

It diverged from the Seddonville Branch at Waimangaroa and followed the southern bank of the Waimangaroa River to the line's terminus at Conns Creek at the foot of the Denniston Incline. The line operated from 1877 until 1967 and existed for the sole purpose of conveying coal from mines to the port of Westport.  Construction  Construction of the Seddonville Branch railway from Westport to Seddonville had begun in 1874. In September 1875 the Wellington Coal Mining Company called for tenders for a private line from a junction with the Seddonville branch at Waimangaroa to a site 1.6 kilometres (1 mile) up the Waimangaroa River adjacent to the company's mine. The Seddonville Branch was completed as far as Waimangaroa on 5 August 1876 and the first portion of the Conns Creek Branch - as far as the Wellington Mine - opened in 1877. A bridge across the river connected the then terminus of the branch on the south bank with the Wellington Mine on the north bank. In 1877, good quality coal was found high on the Mount Rochfort Plateau and the Westport Colliery Company was formed to exploit it. Tenders to extend the Wellington Coal Mining Company's railway by 1.1 kilometres (0.7 miles), and build the Denniston Incline, closed on 30 April 1878. The extension to the new terminus at Conns Creek at the foot of the Denniston Incline was ready for running in February 1879,Prebble, B (Ed) (2008). p. 19. and in April 1880 the Denniston Incline began operation.Prebble, B (Ed) (2008). p. 23.  Ownership  Ownership of different parts of this short branch line changed many times. The lower 1.6 kilometre (1 mile) section from Waimangaroa was owned by the Wellington Coal Mining Company from the line's opening in 1877Prebble, B (Ed) (2008). p. 16. until 1880, when the company folded. The line was then bought by the Koranui Coal Mining Company, which was building the Koranui Incline from the north bank of the Waimangaroa River, adjacent to the Wellington Mine, up Simms Spur to access its mine on Mt Frederick. This lower part of the line was bought by the Union Steam Ship Company of New Zealand on 1 August 1885,Grey River Argus Volume XXXI, Issue 5226, 26 June 1885, p. 2. and then by the Westport Coal Company (which operated the nearby Denniston Incline) in February 1887.Grey River Argus Volume XXXIV, Issue 5830, 26 February 1887, p. 4. Prior to 1887, the Westport Coal Company had to pay high fees to carry coal over this part of the line, first to the Wellington Coal Mining Company and Koranui Coal Mining Company, then to the Union Steam Ship Company; ownership released the company from this difficulty. The upper 1.1 kilometre (0.7 mile) section to Conns Creek was owned by the Westport Colliery Company (which was reformed into the Westport Coal Company in 1881) from its opening in 1879 until 1948. In 1948, the whole 2.7 kilometre (1.7 mile) Conns Creek Branch was taken over by the New Zealand State Mines Department,Prebble, B (Ed) (2008). p. 29. and on 25 September 1958 ownership passed to New Zealand Railways.Prebble, B (Ed) (2008). p. 35.  Operation  The Conns Creek Branch was operated throughout its life by the New Zealand Railways Department (NZR), which also supplied all locomotives and rolling stock. It was a steep line, with a ruling grade of 1 in 37.Prebble, B (Ed) (2008). p. 64. Motive power on the branch was always provided by steam locomotives. Traffic other than coal being conveyed to the harbour in Westport was insignificant. At the start of the 20th century, four trains operated each way daily; these were initially mixed trains as provisions were made to convey passengers (a passenger carriage attached to each train). These were removed in 1931 and the line became goods only. For most of its life, essentially all traffic on the Conns Creek Branch was to or from the Denniston Incline. The Wellington Coal Mining Company's mine was unsuccessful and closed in 1880. From October 1882Grey River Argus Volume XXVI, Issue 4433, 7 November 1882, p. 2. until the beginning of 1887,New Zealand Tablet Volume XIV, Issue 48, 25 March 1887, p. 9. coal from the Koranui Coal Mining Company's mine on Mount Frederick was brought ‚Äì via the Koranui Incline and a bridge over the river ‚Äì to sidings 1.2 kilometres (0.75 miles) up the branch. The Koranui mine and incline closed in 1887. Traffic was in significant decline by the time the railway passed into NZR ownership, and trains no longer ran through to Westport; a shunting locomotive based in Waimangaroa shuttled wagons up and down the branch, and Seddonville Branch trains took the wagons between Waimangaroa and Westport. The Denniston Incline closed on 16 August 1967, and much of the Conns Creek Branch subsequently closed in November 1967. A one kilometre long portion to a location known as East Backshunt (essentially a long siding from the Waimangaroa yard) was retained to receive coal carried by truck from the Denniston plateau. This operated for only a short time before being closed and the track lifted.Prebble, B (Ed) (2008). p. 40.  The branch today  Although remnants of closed railways deteriorate and disappear over time due to natural and human activity, some remains of the Conns Creek Branch still exist. Some of the old formation is still visible and a road to the foot of the Denniston Incline follows it for 1.3 kilometres (0.8 miles). At the Conns Creek terminus are a couple of 'Q' class coal wagons (hopper wagons of the type used on the incline), a crane, stone retaining walls, and other relics. From this point, the remains of the incline extend up to Denniston.Leitch and Scott, Exploring New Zealand's Ghost Railways, p. 54.Petchey, P G (2007). p. 32.

During World War II he interrupted his studies to serve in the U.S. Navy. In 1946 his observations on the condors continued. In 1953 he published the report \\"The California Condor\\" where he gave a first estimation of the world population of about 60 individuals.

The satirical tale pokes fun at the notion that all literature should have a moralSilverman, Kenneth. Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance. New York: Harper Perennial, 1991. p. 169. and spoofs transcendentalism. Plot summary The narrator, presented as the author himself, is dismayed by literary critics saying that he has never written a moral tale. The narrator then begins telling the story of his friend Toby Dammit. Dammit is described as a man of many vices, at least in part due to his left-handed mother flogging him with her left hand, which is considered improper. Dammit often made rhetorical bets, becoming fond of the expression \\"I'll bet the devil my head\\". Though the narrator tries to break Dammit of bad habits, he fails. Nevertheless, the two remain friends. While traveling one day, they come across a covered bridge. It is gloomy and dark, lacking windows. Dammit, however, is unaffected by its gloom and is in an unusually good mood. As they cross the bridge, they are stopped by a turnstile partway across. Dammit bets the devil his head that he can leap over it. Before the narrator can reply, a cough alerts them to the presence of a little old man. The old man is interested in seeing if Dammit is capable of making such a leap and offers him a good running start. The narrator thinks to himself that it is improper for an old man to push Dammit into making the attempt ‚Äî \\"I don't care who the devil he is\\", he adds. The narrator watches as Dammit makes a perfect jump, though directly above the turnstile he falls backwards. The old man quickly grabs something and limps away. The narrator, upon checking on his friend, sees that Dammit's head is gone (\\"what might be termed a serious injury\\"). He realizes that there is a sharp iron bar above the turnstile that severed his friend's head. The narrator sends for the \\"homeopathists\\", who \\"did not give him little enough physic, and what little they did give him he hesitated to take. So in the end he grew worse, and at length died\\". After the bill for his funeral expenses is left unpaid, the narrator has Dammit's body dug up and sold for dog meat. Analysis \\"Never Bet the Devil Your Head\\" is a clear attack on transcendentalism, which the narrator calls a \\"disease\\" afflicting Toby Dammit.

He was originally signed by the Atlanta Falcons as an undrafted free agent in 2003. He played college football at Georgia. He is the younger brother of Robert Edwards, a former first-round pick of the New England Patriots and a former member of the Toronto Argonauts and Montreal Alouettes. College career Like his older brother, Terrence Edwards attended the University of Georgia, where he played from 1999 to 2002. In his career, he caught 204 passes for 3,093 yards and 30 touchdowns. His yardage total is an SEC record and his 204 receptions rank second all-time in the conference. As a senior in 2002, he caught 59 passes for 1,004 yards and 11 touchdowns. Professional career =Atlanta Falcons= After going undrafted in the 2003 NFL Draft, Edwards signed with the Atlanta Falcons on April 29, 2003. Despite missing the team's final preseason game due to injury, Edwards made the team out of training camp. He was active for six games during the regular season, making his debut on September 28 against the Carolina Panthers. His first and only NFL reception to date came on November 30--a 10-yard grab against the Houston Texans from quarterback Doug Johnson. A groin injury sidelined Edwards during most of the 2004 preseason, and he was released prior to the regular season. He has yet to reappear in the NFL, and his career stats include one reception for ten yards, one punt return for two yards, and one solo tackle. =CFL career= After spending the 2004 NFL season out of football, Edwards signed with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League and went to training camp with the team. He was later released and picked up by the Montreal Alouettes later in the season, for whom he caught six passes for 44 yards in two games. In 2006 with Montreal, Edwards caught 33 passes for 393 yards and a touchdown. He also carried the ball twice for 18 yards. Edwards signed with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers on May 24, 2007. This would prove to be his breakout season in the CFL, as he was the league's fifth leading receiver in receptions (80), second in yards (1,280) and tied for second in touchdown receptions (9). He then won his third East Division All-Star award for his performances during the 2011 Winnipeg Blue Bombers season. Despite being 33 years old when the 2012 season begins, Edwards continued production and quality leadership lead the Bombers to extend his contract for an additional 2 years on April 16, 2012.https://www.tsn.ca/cfl/story/?id=393342 Edwards' contract extended On February 18, 2014, Edwards announced his retirement from professional football.Saying good bye: Edwards announces his retirement =Statistics= { BORDER=\\"0\\" CELLPADDING=\\"1\\" CELLSPACING=\\"0\\" width=\\"65%\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\" - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"2\\"  Receiving ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"6\\"  Regular season ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"6\\"  Post-season - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

History Emsleyan mimicry was first proposed by M. G. Emsley as a possible explanation for how a predator species could learn to avoid an aposematic phenotype of potentially dangerous animals, such as the coral snake, when the predator is likely to die on its first encounter. The theory was developed by the German biologist Wolfgang Wickler in a chapter of Mimicry in Plants and Animals, who named it after the German herpetologist Robert Mertens. Sheppard points out that Hecht and Marien had put forward a similar hypothesis ten years earlier. Mimicry of a less deadly species The scenario for Emsleyan mimicry is a little more difficult to understand than for other types of mimicry, since in other types of mimicry it is usually the most harmful species that is the model. But if a predator dies, it cannot learn to recognize a warning signal, e.g., bright colours in a certain pattern. In other words, there is no advantage in being aposematic for an organism that is likely to kill any predator it succeeds in poisoning; such an animal is better off being camouflaged, to avoid attacks altogether. If, however, there were some other species that were harmful but not deadly as well as aposematic, the predator could learn to recognize its particular warning colours and avoid such animals. A deadly species could then profit by mimicking the less dangerous aposematic organism if this reduces the number of attacks. Non- Emsleyan mechanisms Turquoise-browed motmot innately avoids snakes with red and yellow rings. Non-Emsleyan mechanisms that achieve the observed result, namely that predators avoid extremely deadly prey, are possible. Proposed alternatives include observational learning and innate avoidance. These provide alternative explanations to Emsleyan mimicry: if predators innately avoid a pattern then there is no need to suppose that the more deadly snake is mimicking the less deadly species in these cases. =Observational learning= One mechanism is observational learning, for example through watching a conspecific die. The observing predator then remembers that the prey is deadly and avoids it. Jouventin and colleagues conducted exploratory tests on baboons in 1977 that suggested this was possible. =Innate avoidance= Another possible mechanism is that a predator might not have to learn that a certain prey is harmful in the first place: it could have instinctive genetic programming to avoid certain signals. In this case, other organisms could benefit from this programming, and Batesian or M√ºllerian mimics of it could potentially evolve. Some species indeed do innately recognize certain aposematic patterns. Hand-reared turquoise-browed motmots (Eumomota superciliosa), avian predators, instinctively avoid snakes with red and yellow rings. Other colours with the same pattern, and even red and yellow stripes with the same width as rings, were tolerated. However, models with red and yellow rings were feared, with the birds flying away and giving alarm calls in some cases. The models would not have to be other snakes. Large red and black millipedes are common and foul-tasting; various species of these millipedes form M√ºllerian mimicry rings, and some are the models for mimicry in lizards. Coral snake system Some harmless milk snake (Lampropeltis triangulum) subspecies, the moderately toxic false coral snakes (genus Erythrolamprus), and the deadly coral snakes (genus Micrurus) all have a red background color with black and either white or yellow rings. Over 115 species or some 18% of snakes in the New World are within this mimicry system. In this system, Emsley stated that both the milk snakes and the deadly coral snakes are the mimics, whereas the false coral snakes are the models. It has also been suggested that this system could be an instance of pseudomimicry, the similar colour patterns having evolved independently in similar habitats.

Before the fall of the Soviet Union, over half the 1.5 million acknowledged Baptists and Pentecostals in the USSR lived in Soviet Ukraine.Catherine Wanner. Missionaries of Faith and Culture: Evangelical Encounters in Ukraine. Slavic Review, Vol. 63, No. 4. (Winter, 2004), pp. 732-755. Prior to its independence in 1991, Ukraine was home to the second largest Baptist community in the world, after the United States, and was called the ‚ÄúBible Belt‚Äù of the Soviet Union. Today Ukrainian Baptists continue to be among the largest Protestant denominations in Ukraine and the country has the second highest number of Baptist churches in the world. History The predecessors of today's Baptists, the Anabaptists, came to Ukraine in the 16th century, seeking refuge from their persecution by state churches in the Holy Roman Empire (mostly Germany today) and other European states. They were later followed by the German Mennonites and Baptists. They sought to spread their faith to the native Ruthenian/Ukrainian population, so Slavs were invited to Anabaptist prayer meetings and Bible studies. The first Baptist baptism (or \\"baptism by faith\\" of adult people) in Ukraine took place in 1864 on the river Inhul in the Yelizavetgrad region (now Kropyvnytskyi region), in a German settlement. In 1867, the first Ukrainian-speaking Baptist communities were organized in that area. From there, the denomination spread to the south of Ukraine and then to other regions as well. One of the first Baptist communities was registered in Kyiv in 1907, and in 1908 the First All-Russian Convention of Baptists was held there, gathering believers from all over the Russian Empire. The All-Russian Union of Baptists was established in the town of Yekaterinoslav (now Dnipro, Ukraine). At the end of the 19th century, it was estimated that there were from 100,000 to 300,000 Baptists in Ukraine.History of the AUC ECB –í—Å–µ—É–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–∏–π –°–æ—é–∑ –¶–µ—Ä–∫–æ–≤ –Ñ–≤–∞–Ω–≥–µ–ª—å—Å—å–∫–∏—Ö –•—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–∏—è–Ω-–ë–∞–ø—Ç–∏—Å—Ç—ñ–≤ web site =Persecution= During the 1920s, Evangelical Christians and Baptists were prohibited in Soviet Ukraine; they were, to some extent, revived during and after World War II in a Soviet effort to weaken the cultural influence of the Russian Orthodox Church. In 1944, Baptists and Evangelical Christians united in the Church of Evangelical Christian Baptists (ECB). They were later joined by other smaller Baptist and Evangelical trends. At the end of the 1950s, 75% of the believers of the All-USSR Council of ECB lived in Ukraine. Baptists in Ukraine experienced a revival in the 1970s, and are now among the most active Christian denominations in the country. Under the 1996 Constitution of Ukraine, Ukrainians were given the right to free practice of religion.Text of the Constitution of Ukraine ‚Äî Verkhovna Rada official site However, as a minority and non-traditional religion the Baptists have been subject to persecution and discrimination, including being arrested. The Government of Ukraine facilitates the building of houses of worship, and Baptists have difficulties with the local authorities in Kyiv and other large cities while attempting to obtain land and building permits.USDOS International Religious Freedom Report 2005 - Ukraine Baptist leaders have criticized the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) for continuing to publicly referring to Baptists with the pejorative Ukrainian word \\"sectanty\\" (\\"sectarians\\"), and about the activities of the group \\"Dialogue,\\" which Baptists and human rights groups characterized as a front for the UOC-MP that promoted hostility toward non-Orthodox Christians.USDOS International Religious Freedom Report 2006 - Ukraine =Migration to North America= In the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, some Baptists (as well as other Protestant groups from Ukraine) emigrated to the United States and Canada.

Nearly 90% of Baptists in Ukraine are united in the All-Ukrainian Union of Churches of Evangelical Christian-Baptists (AU–° E–°B), established in 1994 at the 22nd Convention of the ECB of Ukraine. Today, the union includes 3 seminaries, 2 universities and 15 Bible colleges, and is estimated to have 150,000 conscious believers, and about 300,000 people that attend church services in more than 2,800 churches, with 3,160 clergy members.Structure of the Union The union is engaged in publishing activity and has an extended mass media network. The AU–° E–°B is governed by a council composed of senior presbyters (bishops) of regional associations headed by the president of the council. From 1990‚Äì2006 the council was headed by Hryhorii Komendant. From May 2006 it has been headed by Vyacheslav Nesteruk. The union closely cooperates with Ukrainian Baptists in the diaspora.

She attempted to bombard Finnish coast defense guns during action in the Winter War, but was driven off by a number of near misses that damaged her. She led the Evacuation of Tallinn at the end of August 1941, before being blockaded in Leningrad where she could only provide gunfire support during the Siege of Leningrad. She bombarded Finnish positions during the Vyborg‚ÄìPetrozavodsk Offensive in mid-1944, but played no further part in the war. Kirov was reclassified as a training cruiser on 2 August 1961 and sold for scrap on 22 February 1974. Description Kirov was long, had a beam of and had a draft between . She displaced at standard load and at full load.Yakubov and Worth, p. 84 Her steam turbines produced a total of and she reached on trials.Yakubov and Worth, p. 90 Kirov carried nine 57-caliber B-1-P guns in three electrically powered MK-3-180 triple turrets. Her secondary armament consisted of six single 56-caliber B-34 anti-aircraft guns fitted on each side of the rear funnel. Her light AA guns consisted of six semi-automatic 21-K AA guns and four DK machine guns.Yakubov and Worth, pp. 86-7 Six 39-Yu torpedo tubes were fitted in two triple mountings.Yakubov and Worth, p. 88 =Wartime modifications= By 1944 Kirov exchanged her guns for ten fully automatic 70-K AA guns with a thousand rounds per gun, two extra DK machine guns and one Lend-Lease quadruple Vickers .50 machine gun MK III mount. Kirov lacked any radar when war broke out in 1941, but by 1944 was equipped with British Lend-Lease models. One Type 291 was used for air search. One Type 284 and two Type 285 radars were for main battery fire control, while anti-aircraft fire control was provided by two Type 282 radars. =Post-war refit= Kirov was completely overhauled from 1949 to 1953. Her secondary armament was upgraded with electrically powered, fully automated 100 mm B-34USM mountings and her fire-control system was replaced with a Zenit-26 system with SPN-500 stabilized directors. All of her light AA guns were replaced with nine twin gun water-cooled 37 mm V-11 mounts. All of her radars were replaced with Soviet systems: Rif surface search, Gyuys air search, Zalp surface gunnery and Yakor' anti-aircraft gunnery radars. All anti-submarine weapons, torpedo launchers, aircraft equipment and boat cranes were removed. While expensive, about half the cost of a new Project 68bis , it was deemed a success and allowed Kirov to serve for another two decades. Service A model of Kirov displayed in the alt= Kirov was laid down at the Ordzhonikidze Yard, Leningrad on 22 October 1935. She was launched on 30 November 1936 and was completed on 26 September 1938. She was commissioned into the Baltic Fleet in the autumn of 1938, but was still being worked on into early 1939.Yakubov and Worth, p. 91 Kirov sailed to Riga on 22 October when the Soviet Union began to occupy Latvia, continuing on to LiepƒÅja the following day.Rohwer, p. 7 =World War II= During the Winter War, Kirov, escorted by the destroyers Smetlivyi and Stremitel'nyi, attempted to bombard Finnish coast defense guns at Russar√∂, south of Hanko on 30 November. She only fired 35 rounds before she was damaged by a number of near misses and had to return to the Soviet naval base at LiepƒÅja for repairs. She remained there for the rest of the Winter War and afterwards was under repair at Kronstadt from October 1940 to 21 May 1941. Based near Riga at the time of the German attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941, Kirov was trapped in the Gulf of Riga by the rapid enemy advance. She supported minelaying sorties by Soviet destroyers in the western half of the Irben Strait on the evenings of 24‚Äì25 and 26‚Äì27 June. Off-loading her fuel and ammunition to reduce her draft, she passed through the shallow Moon Sound Channel (between Muhu island and the Estonian mainland) with great difficulty, and managed to reach Tallinn by the end of June. Kirov provided gunfire support during the defense of Tallinn and served as the flagship of the evacuation fleet from Tallinn to Leningrad at the end of August 1941.Rohwer, pp. 82, 94-5 For most of the rest of the war she was blockaded in Leningrad and Kronstadt by Axis minefields and could only provide gunfire support for the defenders during the Siege of Leningrad. She was damaged by a number of German air and artillery attacks, most seriously on 4‚Äì5 April 1942 when she was hit by three bombs and one shell that damaged all six 100 mm AA guns, the aft funnel, the mainmast, and killed 86 sailors and wounded 46. Repairs took two months during which her catapult was removed; a lighter pole mainmast was fitted and her anti-aircraft armament increased. After Leningrad was liberated in early 1944, Kirov remained there, and took no further part in the war except to provide gunfire support for the Soviet Vyborg‚ÄìPetrozavodsk Offensive in mid‚Äì1944.Whitley, p. 211 =Post-war= Kirov was damaged by a German magnetic mine while leaving Kronstadt on 17 October 1945 and was under repair until 20 December 1946. She was refitted from November 1949 to April 1953, during which her machinery was completely overhauled and her radars, fire control systems and anti-aircraft guns were replaced by the latest Soviet systems. She participated in fleet maneuvers in the North Sea during January 1956. She was reclassified as a training cruiser, regularly visiting Poland and East Germany, on 2 August 1961 and sold for scrap on 22 February 1974. When Kirov was decommissioned, two gun turrets were installed in Saint Petersburg as a monument.

A deserted volcanic island, it is located just off the northern shore of I≈çjima, Kagoshima. Geography Sh≈çwa I≈çjima is one of the ≈åsumi islands, and is located north of I≈çjima. The island has an area of approximately with a coastline of in length. The island is an exposed lava dome associated with the submarine Kikai Caldera, a stratovolcano rising from the ocean floor. History Sh≈çwa I≈çjima came into existence during an eruption in 1934. On September 12, 1934, earthquakes began, continuing for several days. On September 17, a plume of ash and smoke erupted from the ocean surface, and by September 20 an island of ash and pumice began to form. Lava flows were confirmed on November 25, and on December 7, the existence of a new island was confirmed. The volcanic peak on the island reached a height of about 30 meters by December 23, but on December 30, the island sank beneath sea level and disappeared. However, the island reemerged on January 5 and on January 19 a strong eruption with black clouds of volcanic smoke, ash, lava flows and an acidic rain began, continuing for several weeks.

It has taken on various meanings in various contexts since the 20th century. The term was introduced into Vernacular Chinese by Sun Yat-sen as a way of describing his followers. Following the establishment of the People's Republic of China, \\"tongzhi\\" was used to mean \\"comrade\\" in the Communist sense: it was used to address almost everyone, male and female, young and old. In recent years, however, this meaning of the term has fallen out of common usage, except within Chinese Communist Party discourse and among people of older generations.Chou Wah-shan, p. 2 In contemporary Macau and Hong Kong, the term mainly refers to LGBT people instead of the traditional political usage. Usage in Party Politics It remains in use in a formal context among political parties in both mainland China and Taiwan. In the Communist Party of China, the labelling of a person as a \\"comrade\\" is especially significant for a person who has been denounced or demoted, because it indicates that the party has not completely rejected the person as \\"one of its own\\". In Taiwan, it also remains in formal usage in party politics. For example, Frank Hsieh said, after losing the 2008 Republic of China presidential election: \\"ÂæàÂ§öÂêåÂøóÂ∏åÊúõÊàëËÉΩÂ§†ÁïôÂà∞‰∫îÊúà‰∫åÂçÅ‰∫îÊó•\\" (\\"Many comrades hoped that I could stay to May 25\\").ÂáùËÅöÈª®ÂÖßÂúòÁµê Ë¨ùÈï∑Âª∑ÔºöÊàëÊ±∫ÂÆöÁïôÂà∞‰∫î‰∫å‰∫î In October 2016, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a directive urging all 90 million party members to keep calling each other \\"comrades\\" instead of less egalitarian terms. =Military usage= The word comrade is in the regulations of the Chinese Armed Forces as one of three appropriate ways to formally address another member of the military (\\"comrade\\" plus rank or position, as in \\"Comrade Colonel\\", or simply \\"comrade(s)\\" when lacking information about the person's rank, or talking to several servicepeople.) Usage in contemporary Macau and Hong Kong Since the 1990s, the term is, however, increasingly being used to refer to sexual minorities mainly in Macau and Hong Kong and increasingly in Mainland China and Taiwan, including lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. This way of using the term was first adopted by Michael Lam (ÊûóÈÇÅÂÖã), a columnist writing in Hong Kong magazine City Magazine (ËôüÂ§ñ), and popularised by the inaugural Hong Kong Lesbian and Gay Film Festival in 1989, with the aim of presenting same-sex relationships are positive and suggesting solidarity between LGBT people, while also providing an indigenous term to capture the Chinese experience of same-sex love. It is preferred by LGBT communities over the term t√≥ngx√¨ngl√¨an (), the formal word for homosexuality, which is seen as being too clinical and having pathological connotations. The use of tongzhi over t√≥ngx√¨ngl√¨an roughly parallels the replacement of \\"homosexual\\" with \\"gay\\" in the Western discourse. Although it initially referred to gay (male tongzhi, Áî∑ÂêåÂøó) and lesbian (female tongzhi, Â•≥ÂêåÂøó) people, in recent years, the term gradually covers a wider range of meaning including \\"LGBTQIA\\". For example, Taiwan LGBT Pride parade (Âè∞ÁÅ£ÂêåÂøóÈÅäË°å), Asia's biggest LGBT pride parade, can be literally translated as \\"Taiwan Tongzhi Parade.\\" According to Chou Wah-Shan, T√≥ngzh√¨ is a very fluid term which can refer to all people who are opposed to or fall outside of heteronormativity. He views T√≥ngzh√¨ as a means of signifying \\"politics beyond the homo-hetero duality\\" and \\"integrating the sexual into the social\\".

Two types of landfills fires are generally recognized. Surface Fires and Deep Seated Fires. Surface fires typically occur in underdeveloped countries that lack capacity to properly cover waste with inert daily and intermediate cover. Modern examples of such fires include the Deonar and Ghazipur Landfills in India, Cerro Patacon Landfill in Panama and the New Providence Landfill in the Bahamas. In landfills that do not cover their waste with daily cover, air intrusion provides the oxygen required for increased biological activity decomposition that creates substantial heat and can cause material in the landfills to spontaneously combust.. If unchecked, spontaneous combustion fires in particular tend to burn deeper into the waste mass, resulting in deep seated fires. In the U.S. 40% of landfill fires are attributed to arson.U.S. Fire Administration - Landfill Fires Landfill fires are especially dangerous as they can emit dangerous fumes from the combustion of the wide range of materials contained within the landfill. Key parameters of concern are carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulphide, volatile organics. Production of dioxins and furans is also a documented risk factor. Subsurface landfill fires also, unlike a typical fire, are difficult to put out with water unless an overhaul operation is undertaken. They are similar to coal seam fires and peat fires. Oxygen intrusion control is the best method to prevent and fight subsurface landfill fires as long as the fire fighting team can be confident that all air entry pathways are effectively blocked. \\"Fuel quenching\\", by allowing landfill gas build-up, can work well, especially in conjunction with maintenance of the daily cover of soil or material places on landfills. However, this oxygen suppression method can be compromised if cracks develop in the soil cover due to settlement. Nearby streams can be threatened by leachate pools which may form if water is used to extinguish fires in landfills. for this reason, recirculation of fire fighting water should be considered to minimize environmental impacts. There is also the danger that the landfill's membrane, a barrier placed under most modern landfills to prevent contamination of the underlying ground, will be destroyed or penetrated by the fire itself. Normally this liner prevents harmful liquids contained within the landfill from escaping into the groundwater and nearby streams. Destruction of the liner therefore leads to serious environmental problems. Notable landfill fires *On January 26, 1998, in Maalaea, Hawaii, a fire underground. The fire was eventually deemed to be extinguished in a matter of weeks, with injections of more than 1,000 pounds of liquid carbon dioxide. It continued to smolder for four months.‚ÄúMa‚Äôalaea Landfill Fire Sparks State Effort To Develop Guidelines,‚Äù Environment Hawai‚Äôi, Inc., Volume 9, Number 4, October 1998. *An underground landfill fire that was discovered in December 1996 in Danbury, Connecticut caused a strong odor like rotten eggs due to the high concentration of hydrogen sulfide. The fire lasted for weeks and the town was forced to install a gas recovery system, the cost of which exceeded $1 million. *In early November 1999, at the Delta Shake and Shingle Landfill in North Delta, British Columbia. The fire burned deep. On November 27, Delta's Mayor declared a state of local emergency. Extinguishing the fire took slightly more than two months and cost more than $4 million (Canadian).T. Sperling, \\"Fighting a Landfill Fire\\", Waste Age magazine, Jan. 1, 2001 *On September 2, 2007 a large fire at the Fredericton Regional Landfill forced residents to stay indoors because of fears the smoke could be toxic.http://www.cbc.ca/canada/new-brunswick/story/2007/09/02/landfill- fire.html * On December 23, 2010, Republic Services reported elevated gas extraction well temperatures, indicative of a smoldering landfill fire, at West Lake Landfill. The smoldering fire continues to burn today, which has involved the Environmental Protection Agency, Missouri's Attorney General Chris Koster, Missouri Department of Natural Resources, Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, and St. Louis County Department of Health. The smoldering fire is estimated to be roughly 1,000 feet away from radioactive wastes illegally dumped at the landfill in 1973.

He got his law degree from the University of Puerto Rico (in 1965), pursued constitutional law at Harvard University (summers of 1977 and 1978) and got a PhD in Administrative Constitutional Right from Spain's Universidad Complutense de Madrid (in 2002). Political career Cerezo served as a member of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives between 1969 and 1973. Elected in 1968 under the newly founded New Progressive Party at an early age, incoming Speaker Angel Viera Mart√≠nez appointed him to chair one of the House's two most powerful committees, the Government Affairs Committee. Cerezo came out against the Vietnam War and ended up losing his chairmanship, ending his elective career. From 1989 to 1991, Cerezo once again collaborated briefly with the pro-statehood New Progressive Party(NPP) when he accepted party president Carlos Romero Barcel√≥'s invitation to spearhead the party's lobbying efforts to get Congress to approve a bill providing for a referendum in Puerto Rico on political status options. Cerezo put together a group of ad hoc volunteer lobbyists, including Romero, legendary party founder Luis A. Ferr√©, in his late 80's at the time, as well as a younger cadre that included attorney Carlos D√≠az Olivo, now a law professor, businessman Cesar Cabrera, subsequently a United States Ambassador, attorney Luis Fortu√±o, subsequently Governor of Puerto Rico, and Kenneth McClintock, who later became the territory's President of the Senate and Secretary of State. When Pedro Rossell√≥ became party president and Cerezo questioned many of Rossello's policies, Cerezo once again withdrew from collaborating with the NPP. After leaving the NPP sphera, he went on to have a successful law practice and a career as a non-affiliated political analyst. Political analysis Cerezo participated in many political analysis programs from 1969 until his death in 2013. His political analysis style was described very well by Nilsa Pierri Castell√≥n: \\"Benny was bold in the analysis, risky in his judgments, but vertical and almost always accurate\\".Homenage a Benny, by Nilsa Pietri Castell√≥n Cerezo was a harsh critic of the actions he understood wrong, or harmful to the people, regardless of their party or affiliation. * Together with Noel Col√≥n Mart√≠nez, Severo Colberg Ram√≠rez, Juan Manuel Garc√≠a Passalacqua and Jos√© Arsenio Torres (former Secretary of Education)List of Secretaries of Education in Puerto Rico he founded \\"Cara a Cara Ante el Pa√≠s\\", one of the most successful political analysis programs that lasted 10 years on TV. * In 1970, he founded \\"Dialogando con Benny\\" in WKAQ (AM). This program was broadcast on Sundays from 8:30 to 10:30 a.m. on various radio stations, and ended always being the number one program for that time segment. * He founded \\"Voz Primera\\" with Don Roberto S√°nchez Vilella (former governor of Puerto Rico from the Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico-PDP), Victoria Mu√±oz Mendoza (daughter of the first governor of Puerto Rico and the first female candidate for governor in Puerto Rico), El√≠as G√∫tierrez, Jos√© Luis M√©ndez y Santos Negr√≥n. The program was aired in commercial radio and the University of Puerto Rico radio station. * He helped found \\"Avance\\", along with several other political mavericks, including Juan Manuel Garc√≠a Passalacqua and Noel Col√≥n Mart√≠nez a Puerto Rican newsweekly magazine that attempted to provide a heavy dose of political analysis before folding. Cerezo was also a regular columnist for El Mundo (Puerto Rico), El Imparcial y El Nuevo D√≠a newspapers, and an occasional columnist for \\"The San Juan Star\\". At the time of his death, he was a political analyst for several radio and TV stations in Puerto Rico, and was in charge of an hour-long political analysis talk show on Radio Isla 1320 WSKN, an island-wide radio network.

Situated on the Credit River, it is located approximately west of Toronto and is part of the Regional Municipality of Halton. Norval is believed to take its name from the Scottish play Douglas by poet John Home. History Around 1820 James McNab and his family arrived; McNab was a United Empire Loyalist and had fought in the War of 1812. The family raised sheep and built a grist and a saw mill on the Credit River. Some of their wood was shipped to England for use as masts on naval ships. Flour mills also opened in this area; the largest one operated until 1930 when it was destroyed in a fire. In 1836 the post office was established. Previously, the settlement had been called McNabsville and McNab's Mill. In 1838, the mills were sold to Peter Adamson. In 1851, the Guelph Plank Road passed through this area and by 1856 the Grand Trunk Railway had arrived. The latter was useful for shipping goods from this area. In 1846, the settlement had a population of about 200 inhabitants, served by two churches, various tradesmen, a gristmill, an oatmeal mill, a distillery, two stores and a tavern. Norval became a thriving village, complete with a broom factory, ashery, bakery, woollen and flax mills, carriage works, a blacksmith and harness shops, brass foundry, general stores, several hotels, a Mechanics' Institute and an Orange Lodge. It was a main stop on the stagecoach ride from Guelph to Toronto. Upper Canada College's Norval Outdoor School is located at 10444 Winston Churchill Boulevard. Acquired in 1913, it was established in the property after 1935. Author Lucy Maud Montgomery, who wrote the Anne of Green Gables series, lived in Norval from 1926 to 1935. In her journal, Montgomery expressed her appreciation for the village‚Äôs natural beauty, and declared, ‚ÄúI love Norval as I have never loved any place save Cavendish [Prince Edward Island]. It is as if I had known it all my life\\". In 1954 the grist mill was destroyed by Hurricane Hazel. In 1972 the remaining structures were removed to expand Highway 7.

The episode was written by Dawn DeKeyser and directed by Ron Underwood. Plot The story begins with Betty dealing with trying to get into an elevator full of models only to exceed the elevator limits. As Betty prepares to help Daniel to manage his first solo Fashion Week, she has to give Justin's class a tour of MODE. Justin's classmates only seem interested in celebrities, high fashion, and being thin, so they're naturally attracted to Amanda after they see her. When Betty sees the young schoolgirls throwing their lunches in the trash, including a bewildered Hilary, who seems to pressured by a pair of classmates and gives in, she tells Daniel that they have to change MODE and suggests that they use healthy normal looking models for their Fashion Week show, but Daniel isn't so sure about doing this because of one person that would have to agree on changing it, and that would be Alexis, who just gave Daniel a new chair as a gesture to bury the hatchet. That same day, Wilhelmina's hormone treatments have her behaving more lovingly than usual, with assistance from Marc, who has to inject the shots while she binges on ice cream. But hours later, Wilhelmina's doctor tells her that she can't carry a child because she has a hostile womb and she'll have to find a surrogate, so she asks her manicurist, Brandy, who already has five children. Brandy agrees to it and Wilhelmina offers her one of her fur coats as a done deal. In her first staff meeting with all Editors-in-Chief since she became President/CEO of Meade Publications, Alexis not only nixes Daniel's proposal about using healthy models, but when he tried to find a chair, he is stunned that has to sit on a small stool. Later that morning Marc visits Amanda and arranges her to meet with a psychic named Linda to try to find out who her father is. As Linda visits the Love Dungeon for their first meeting it becomes apparent that Linda's \\"visions\\" makes Miss Cleo look tame, but the only thing that Linda tells Amanda is that she's going to be rescuing a black dog. As Betty gets trapped in an elevator with rapper Bow Wow and after Amanda gets them out of there she says his name to herself and then thinks that he's the \\"dog\\" that Linda referred to, so she starts to believe in the woman's powers. Linda tells Amanda to follow the letter \\"B\\" and that the \\"B\\" would lead her to a kiss and the kiss would lead her to her real father. Amanda sees Betty's \\"B\\" necklace after Halston barks at it and gets the idea that Betty is the \\"B\\" who she's supposed to follow, of which Betty dismisses. At The Closet, Marc is stunned to find Stuart there as he waited to see Christina and when she arrives the two talked about the money for the operation, but hours later Henry has the sad responsibility of having to tell Christina that her insurance won't cover Stuart's treatments. When Marc overhears this, he comes by to comfort her, not knowing of what lies ahead for the Scottish seamstress. At a press conference, Alexis announces the change to allow normal women to be included in the MODE fashion show. As they weigh in, Justin notices the scales are really off and when Betty tests it she learns that Alexis rigged the scale to show emaciated models as being 20 pounds heavier than they really are, and when Betty confronts her about it, Alexis tells Betty that fixing the scale was Daniel's idea. Feeling guilty about giving in to Alexis's demands and thereby disappointing Betty because he feels powerless against his sister, this after seeing a vision of a devastated 12-year-old Betty, Daniel decides to go against Alexis' orders and arranges to have actual normal women as models. Later that evening, Marc and Cliff can't find anything at the video store that they both want to watch, so they go into the store's naughty back room where Marc discovers a movie with a picture of Wilhelmina's chosen surrogate, Brandy, on the cover. Brandy would later be dismissed by Wilhelmina, resulting in Wilhelmina going back to square one. As she watches Fashion Buzz she sees Christina giving an interview, and Marc lets Wilhelmina know that Christina needs a lot of money to help her husband pay for his operation, so Wilhelmina gets the idea to offer Christina the money if she'll carry her little Meade heir for nine months, calling her their \\"Scotch On The Rocks.\\" As Amanda catches up with Betty and takes her to the Love Dungeon, they have a tender moment together as Amanda finally learns a few details about Betty's life, especially how Betty's mother died six years ago from cancer, even though Betty believes that Amanda needs to do a little more homework on her life, like her last name and which parent is still living. Betty assured Amanda that it doesn't take a psychic or a good luck charm to find what you're looking for. Before walking away from Amanda, Betty picks up a photo of Gene Simmons, of KISS fame, and hands it to Amanda, leaving her to believe that the long- tongued rocker is her father. At Fashion Week, Daniel finally unveil the alternative fashion show featuring real, normal women, and it proves to be a hit among the crowd and the press, especially after Betty gets Bow Wow to show up with fellow recording artist Omarion as Betty works the runway as one of the models. When Alexis sees this non-sanctioned show, she is upset at first when she sees Daniel's \\"models\\" coming out, but then she takes credit for the whole thing in the end, once again topping her brother. As the show gets tons of attention, one of Justin's alpha-girl friends complains about the \\"fat\\" models and thought it suck and as she sees a confused Hilary, she gives in to the girls. Betty gets gratification, however, when one of the other girls, Taylor comes up to her afterwards to tell her that the show didn't totally suck, and then asks about some of the clothes that she saw on the runway. As the event comes to an end, Betty and Daniel finally walk away into the runway sunset with high fives on a job well done. Production \\"Zero Worship\\" can be considered the first episode to address the issue of body imaging and its effect on young girls, which was the central theme in the \\"Be Ugly\\" campaign back in the series' first season. The single Bow Wow and Omarion performed in this episode, \\"Hey Baby (Jump Off)\\", is the second single release from their collaboration set Face Off. This episode was supposed to make its airing debut on January 3, 2008, but last minute schedule changes pushed its airing back a week.From The Futon Critic (December 20, 2007) This also marks the first episode to filmed without former series regular Alan Dale, while current regular Judith Light is absent from this one.

Released on November 13, 2001 through Island Records, the album serves as a follow-up to her critically acclaimed I Am Shelby Lynne which came out a year before in the US. Producer Glen Ballard, mostly known for producing Alanis Morissette's breakthrough album Jagged Little Pill as well as recordings by the Dave Matthews Band, worked with Shelby on the album. Shifting from what was established by its predecessor, the album brings mostly a pop rock-oriented sound, but maintains the personal lyrics from I Am. Critically, it struggled to make an impact, receiving mostly mixed to positive reviews. As of sales, the album charted very moderately, peaking at number 109 on the Billboard 200 chart. For the second time in Lynne's career, she appears as the main songwriter, receiving credits on nine out of the ten tracks. Co- writers include Glen Ballard, Bill Payne, Sonny Landreth, Michael Landau, Matt Chamberlain and Mike Elizondo, noted for his work on Nelly Furtado's debut record Whoa, Nelly!. John Lennon also appears as a writer for his Top 20 hit \\"Mother\\", covered by Shelby for the album as well as during a special performance after the 9/11 attacks in New York City. Additionally, three extra tracks appear on the album's UK version: \\"Star Broker\\", \\"Close to You\\" and \\"Break Me Open\\", featured on a different track listing. Background and composition After nearly thirteen years as a mostly unknown country vocalist, Shelby Lynne rose to prominence with the release of her sixth album. Following her Best New Artist win at the 43rd Grammy Awards, Lynne quickly started working on new material. Glen Ballard stepped in as the record‚Äôs producer, much to the creation of a diverse and new sound. Impressed by Lynne‚Äôs versatility and music style, Ballard praised her by stating: \\"(‚Ä¶) She has a tremendous stylistic range, from old-school, almost Barry White R&B;, to hardcore punk, rockabilly and everything in between.\\" Around the same time, the album's first single Wall In Your Heart was released. Promoted by several performances, including one on David Letterman's show. The song went as high as number 22 on the Adult Contemporary chart. The album's release announcement came shortly after, arriving at stores on November 13. Mostly a pop-rock record, the album was a drastic change from the singer's previous work. Similar to her previous effort, the album saw Lynne as the record's main songwriter, being responsible for most of the lyrics. It also featured various contributions including Mike Elizondo. Elizondo was then known for his work with Canadian pop star Nelly Furtado. Critical reception and commercial performance Shelby‚Äôs new style and sound were poorly received by critics. Receiving mostly mixed reviews, the album holds a score of 53 on Metacritic, based on 12 reviews. Critics noted that: \\"The edges have all been sawed off of Lynne's sound (‚Ä¶)\\" as well as seeing the record as \\"slickly over-produced and a little forced.\\" Nevertheless, positive reviews came from Billboard and Blender. Commercially, the album performed slightly better than I Am Shelby Lynne but had lackluster sales. The album debuted and peaked at number 109 in the US Billboard 200, and failing to enter the UK Album Charts. Additionally, \\"Killin' Kind\\" became a single release, peaking at number 30 in the Adult Pop Songs chart. The track was included in the soundtrack for the film adaptation of Bridget Jones's Diary (which also featured \\"Dreamsome\\" from her previous album). The music video for the song was notable for being the first country music video directed by hip hop video director Hype Williams.

It was directed by Jules Bass and Arthur Rankin, Jr., written by Romeo Muller, narrated by Buddy Hackett, and starring Robert Morse, Debra Clinger, and Paul Frees. The special premiered on NBC on December 13, 1979, and tells the tale of Jack Frost and his adventures as a human. It airs annually on AMC as part of its Best Christmas Ever programming block. Plot The story is narrated by a groundhog named Pardon-Me-Pete, who has a deal with Jack Frost to extend winter by 6 weeks, letting him sleep that much longer. Pete starts to talk about the legend of Jack Frost. It all starts when Jack Frost, an immortal winter sprite, falls in love with a human girl named Elisa, who proclaims her love for Jack after he rescues her when Kubla Kraus, an evil Cossack king who lives all alone in his castle on Miserable Mountain, except for his iron horse Klangstomper, his clockwork butler Fetch- Kvetch, his army of Keh-Nights, and a ventriloquist's dummy named Dommy as his sidekick, all made of iron since no people or animals could stand to live with him due to his arrogance and greed, cracks the ice she is standing on. Jack asks Father Winter if he can become human in order to be with her. Father Winter gives him a chance but warns that Jack must prove he can succeed as a human, by earning a house, a horse, a bag of gold, and a wife by the first sign of spring. Jack agrees and turns human, assuming the identity of Jack Snip. He runs a tailor shop in the town of January Junction with two friends who also turned human, Snip the snowflake maker and Holly the snow gypsy. Snip and Holly were sent by Father Winter to ensure Jack does not get into trouble. Elisa is charmed by \\"Jack Snip\\", but she harbors romantic dreams of Sir Ravenal Rightfellow, a \\"knight in golden armor\\". Elisa is soon kidnapped by Kraus and taken to his castle. Kraus also possesses all the brick, gold, and timber that January Junction used to have. After Elisa is rescued by Sir Ravenal, Kraus vows to destroy January Junction by sending one-thousand Keh- Nights in an attempt to recapture his bride and throws Jack, Snip, and Holly in the dungeon. Jack gives up his humanity in order to whip up the biggest blizzard ever, freezing Kraus and his 1,000 Keh-Nights in the castle. Snip and Holly change back to sprites as well. This tactic works until Groundhog Day arrives. As the sky is overcast with no sun to cast shadows, Jack Frost uses his magic shadow to scare Pete back into hibernation, and continues whipping up the storm. Finally, with only 1 hour left before the arrival of spring, Jack returns to human form to stop Kraus by tricking his Keh-Nights into walking off the icy mountain to their destruction by imitating Dommy. Afterward, Jack causes Kraus to fall out of his castle and Father Winter literally blows him far away from Miserable Mountain, leaving Jack to claim the gold for himself; tames Klangstomper, making him his horse; and the castle becomes his house. He races off to ask Elisa's parents for her hand in marriage, but during his absence, she has fallen in love with Sir Ravenal, and he with her. Jack becomes a spirit again for good, and blows ice onto Elisa's wedding bouquet, turning it white.

Home media The licensing for Jack Frost was relatively lax for many years and as early as the early 1990s, independent discount home video distributors produced VHS (and later DVD) copies from 16 mm prints. The special did not, as occasionally stated, lapse into the public domain; the Copyright Act of 1976 had taken effect by the time the special was published, which granted Rankin/Bass and its successors automatic copyrights of 75 years, and the program had a valid copyright notice to begin with. In the fall of 2008, Warner Bros. via Warner Home Video (owners of the post-September 1974 Rankin/Bass library) re-released the special as an \\"official version\\" on DVD, using a digitally remastered 35 mm print as the master.

Prior to taking the position, he was for 26 years a law enforcement officer in Wake County with the North Carolina Highway Patrol. From 1988 to 1992, he was also the Chief of Security for Lieutenant Governor James Carson Gardner.Harrison backs McCain Harrison Robocalls for McCrory Elections Harrison's first campaign for Wake County sheriff in 1998 against long-time incumbent John Baker was unsuccessful. Baker, nicknamed \\"Big John,\\" was an iconic Raleigh political figure and former defensive lineman in the NFL. Baker was first elected sheriff in 1978, becoming the first Black sheriff in North Carolina since the Reconstruction era. Harrison sought a rematch in 2002 and won. The two men faced off again for a third time in 2006 which resulted in Harrison winning convincingly, but not without controversy. His 2006 re-election was mired in controversy as it was released that Donnie Harrison had committed adultery with a Garner optometrist's wife while he was still married. Harrison's campaign adviser stated, \\"There's no denying there was an affair, but the marriage was doomed before the affair happened. Then suddenly, six days before the election, this appears? That says there's got to be a lot of political motivation behind this.\\"Harrison Wins Reelection Adultery remains a misdemeanor level crime in North Carolina. In 2008, Harrison helped dedicate the Wake County Public Safety Center in honor of Baker who had died in 2007. In 2018, Harrison ran for reelection for a fifth time but was defeated by Gerald Mauroka Baker during the 2018 midterm elections. Political involvement Harrison is a self-described conservative Republican. He has weighed in on multiple elections during his tenure as Sheriff, including an endorsement of Pat McCrory's 2008 gubernatorial campaign, and Senator Richard Burr in 2010.

Biography  Earned his Juris Doctor from the University of Puerto Rico School of Law. He began his public service as a prosecutor. In 1968 he ran as a candidate for state representative under the banner of the New Progressive Party, which he helped found the year before. In January, 1969, he became Speaker of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives, collaborating closely with pro-statehood Governor Luis A. Ferr√©, while the Puerto Rico Senate, presided by Rafael Hern√°ndez Col√≥n, remained under the control of the opposition Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico. When Hern√°ndez Col√≥n and his party swept the 1972 elections, in 1973 Viera Mart√≠nez became House Minority Leader until he once again became Speaker in 1977. As a result of the 1980 elections, the New Progressive Party had won 26 seats and the Popular Democratic Party 25, but the latter challenged the results of the 35th Representative District, creating a tie with each party holding 25 seats, pending the final results of that district. Since the new House in 1981 was tied, it was unable to elect a Speaker, as required, by an absolute majority. To complicate matters, Ram√≥n Mu√±iz (PPD 32nd District) died on the House Floor in January 1981 and Representative-elect Fernando Tonos Florenz√°n's election was invalidated due to him not having the constitutionally required 25 years to serve in the House,Nogueras v. Tonos Florenz√°n, 110 DPR 356 (1980) and Tonos Florenz√°n v. Bernazard, 111 DPR 546 (1981). leaving the House with 25 New Progressives and 23 Popular Democrats. House Secretary Cristino Bernazard, who normally would have presided over the House only until it elected its new Speaker in its inaugural session, became the first unelected Acting Speaker of the House. During Bernazard's incumbency, he appointed co-chairs to the House standing committees and required that all House decisions and legislation be approved by consensus. After some political wrangling, in what became known as the Viera-Colberg Pact, the House elected Viera Martinez once again as Speaker for the remainder of 1981 and maverick Popular Democratic Rep. Severo Colberg Ram√≠rez as Speaker from 1982 until 1984. In late 1981, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Popular Democratic candidate in the 35th District, and with the Popular Democrats finally filling in the two vacancies they had, that party gained control of the House, with a majority of 26. In 1982, Viera Mart√≠nez once again became the House Minority Leader. In 1983, he joined San Juan Mayor Hern√°n Padilla in bolting the NPP and founding the Puerto Rico Renewal Party, serving as its unsuccessful candidate for Resident Commissioner in the 1984 general elections, ending his elective career. Died at Auxilio Mutuo Hospital due to heart failure at age 90. The House cloakroom was named after him before his death in 2005, when he was honored by Governor An√≠bal Acevedo Vil√°, House Speaker Jos√© Aponte and Senate President Kenneth McClintock with a state funeral.

Powered by a 6.3 L W18 engine, it is a 2-seater mid-engine coup√©. The 18/3 Chiron was the last in a trio of Bugatti concept cars by Italdesign, after the 1998 EB 118 coup√© and the 1999 EB 218 saloon. The Chiron name was used again on the 2016 successor to the Bugatti Veyron. Name origin The 18/3 Chiron is named after Bugatti race driver Louis Chiron, while the \\"18/3\\" prefix stands for the engine's 18 cylinders distributed into three banks of six cylinders each. Description The Bugatti 18/3 Chiron premiered at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 1999. =Design= Fabrizio Giugiaro of Italdesign was responsible for the design with input from Hartmut Warku√ü from the Volkswagen design centre in Wolfsburg. In creating a logical successor to the EB110, they had the unique opportunity to style Bugatti's possible flagship model. Rear three-quarters view Front view Airflow management and aerodynamics were key considerations in the exterior design. Below the traditional horseshoe radiator grille a large opening provides enough air to the radiators of the 6.3-litre engine; much of this air is extracted though vents located forward of the front wheel openings. A similar system is used on the side of the car to cool the rear brakes. At the rear a diffuser was integrated in the rear bumper. A retractable rear wing deploys at high speeds, much like on the EB 110. The 20-inch eight-spoke wheels resemble the cast aluminium wheels first found on Louis Chiron's Type 35B. The stylish body work was made from carbon fibre. Lighting on both ends of the car was cutting edge at its time, including triple Xenon headlights and elongated turn signals at the rear who also served as the tail lights of the car, two double exhaust pipes were visible through a large air extractor at the rear which also served as the underbody spoiler. Inside, the cabin is upholstered in Blu Pacifico and Sabbia leather with aluminium accents as well as a removable watch on the passenger side. Important design elements such as the classic horse shoe grille, inset front lights, converging front hood and an exposed intake plenum would eventually be integrated into the production Veyron EB 16.4. =Engine and chassis= The exposed inlet manifolds of the W18 engine In order to construct a fully working prototype, Bugatti utilised the chassis and four- wheel drive system sourced from the Lamborghini Diablo VT in the 18/3 Chiron. The 18/3 Chiron uses the same Volkswagen-designed W18 engine that first appeared on the 1998 EB 118 and the 1999 EB 218 concept cars. As on the other two cars, the Chiron's W18 has a power output of and of torque. The 18/3 Chiron's W18 engine is composed of three banks of six cylinders with a sixty degree offset between each cylinder bank. In contrast, the W16 engine in Bugatti Automobile's first production car, the 2005 Veyron EB 16.4 features a four-bank configuration of four cylinders each, totalling sixteen cylinders. =Performance= The 18/3 Chiron could accelerate from in 5.3 seconds and could reach a top speed of approximately . But these numbers were never verified.

He was raised in the Rastafari culture from a young age. Biography Born Dwight Duncan in Prospect Beach, St. Thomas, Jamaica in 1973, he was raised as a Rastafarian.Larkin, Colin (1998) The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae, Virgin Books, , p. 47 He attended the Lysson All Age School, where his music teacher noticed his potential for music and nurtured him in his developing stages. Dwight then went on to Yallas High School where he continued to shine musically as a member of the school choir, a member of the Yallas drum core, playing the bass organ, also participating in numerous school concerts. He was also a member of the New Testament Church of God Choir, where he earned the name Ark Angel. As a teenager he worked as a selector under the name Junior Melody (sometimes Junior Buckley) for the Black Star Line sound- system,Leggett, Steve \\"[ Bushman Biography]\\", Allmusic, Macrovision Corporation and took part in several singing competitions and talent searches in and around St. Thomas. Gaining a strong local fan base Junior Melody began to sing dub plates for local sound-systems such as Lee's Unlimited, Mello Construction, King Majesty and others. The rave reviews from the sound selectors and the people of his community encouraged Junior Melody to take his talent to the next level, the studios of Kingston. He hitch-hiked to Kingston, and during an impromptu game of football at Arrows Dub plate studio he met Steely & Clevie. After telling them that he was a singer, they invited him to Studio 2000, where he recorded his first tracks. Their first song together was \\"Grow Your Natty\\", which was followed by the hit \\"Call The Hearse\\". With talks of an album Steely wished to change the name Junior Melody to Bushman. Initially Duncan was unhappy with this name, he thought it somehow derogatory to him coming from the country, until he researched the name only to discover that 'Bushman' was an African name for 'Medicine Man'. \\"Call The Hearse\\" became a big hit in Jamaica, and was followed by \\"Rude Boy Life\\" and his debut album, Nyah Man Chant (1997). Nyah Man Chant was described in The Rough Guide to Reggae as \\"as good an example of modern cultural singing as you could hope to find.\\"Barrow, Steve & Dalton, Peter (2004) The Rough Guide to Reggae, 3rd edn., Rough Guides, , p.369 Bushman then moved on to work with King Jammy, who produced his next two albums - Total Commitment, which collected most of the early singles he recorded for the producer, and Higher Ground. A Better Place was the fourth album from Bushman. For this album Bushman teamed up with the UK-based Stingray team. Despite the ever-increasing recognition of his talent Bushman remains a humble, down to earth figure, who still lives in St. Thomas with his wife and children, follows a strict ital diet, and bathes in the hot water springs of St. Thomas.

Hockett to distinguish the features of human language from that of animal communication. Critically, animal communication might display some of the thirteen features but never all of them. It is typically considered as one of the crucial characteristics distinguishing human from animal communication and provides significant support for the argument that language is learned socially within a community and not inborn where the acquisition of information is via the avenue of genetic inheritance. In essence, the idea of traditional transmission details the process by which language is passed down from one generation to the next. In this manner, it is often also referred to as cultural transmission where it is a mechanism of iterated learning. Common processes would include imitation or teaching. The model purports that present learners acquire the cultural behaviour, that is language in this instance by observing similar behaviours in others who acquired the language the same way. This is an important distinction made in the Scientific American \\"The Origin of Speech\\", where Hockett defines traditional transmission as \\"the detailed conventions of any one language are transmitted extra-genetically by learning and teaching\\".Hockett, Charles F. (1960), \\"The Origin of Speech,\\" Scientific American, 203, 89‚Äì97. While culture is not unique to the human species, the way it exhibits itself as language in human society is very distinctive and one key trait of this uniqueness is the element of social groups. Social Groups Traditional transmission is exemplified by the sociological context of social groups. American sociologist C.H. Cooley classifies social groups on the basis of contact in primary groups. In his paper Social Organization (1909), he describes primary groups (family, playgroups, neighborhoods, community of elders) as \\"those characterized by intimate face-to-face association and cooperation.\\"Cooley, C. H. (1909). Social organization: A study of the larger mind. Charles Scribner's Sons. Although there are other types of classifications by other sociologists, Cooley's classification and description is more applicable to the concept of traditional transmission. The idea of intimate interactions aligns with how the language is transmitted from the parents to their next generation on a fundamental level. Consequently, following this line of thought, social groups play an integral role in the transmission of language from one generation to the next. In support of this notion, the importance of social groups in traditional transmission is illustrated in the presence of social isolation and children end up with an inability to effectively acquire a language. A child raised in social isolation would be commonly known as a \\"feral child/wild child\\". The following examples showcase a few classic case studies of rescued \\"wild\\" children who have gone through language deprivation and forms credible support for the argument of traditional transmission. Some commonly known examples include: 1) Anna - (born in 1932) Anna from Pennsylvania, was raised in private due to illegitimacy. Kept hidden and trapped in an attic, malnourished and unable to move, till she was rescued at six years old. This resulted in her lack of language ability. Once rescued, Anna received linguistic input and showed aptitude for understanding instructions but ultimately never acquired speaking. 2) Genie - (born in 1957) Genie remains one of the most prominent examples of linguistically isolated children ever studied. Only rescued at 13 years of age, Genie was inadequately exposed to language input and demonstrated no language ability upon rescue. Yet with linguistic input that came from her social circles then, Genie gradually acquired communication, albeit neither fluent nor smooth. 3) Victor of Aveyron - (born in 1788) Victor was one of the earliest feral children studied. Rescued at 12, he ran away from civilisation eight times and his case was eventually undertaken by a young medical student who tried to train him to communicate. Victor showed impressive progress with reading and comprehension of simple words. However, he never progressed beyond a rudimentary level.  Significance  A key consideration when it comes to traditional transmission and why it is a significant milestone in language acquisition is its influence on language learning patterns. Traditional transmission denotes naturally that learning is acquired through social interactions and built upon by teaching and enforcement. This influences research when it comes to language learning patterns, impacting our understanding of the human cognition as well as language structure. Compellingly, it also determines the direction of how language should be taught and passed down. From the standpoint of traditional transmission where language manifests as a socially learned, culturally transmitted system, language acquisition is mechanical and is directly affected by the present environment the individual is placed in. This removes the premise of language acquisition from that of a biological construct. Instead of having to biologically explain traditional transmission, it introduces the possibility that the design features of language itself stem from traditional transmission. Of course, for the above to be significant, it means that languages engage in cultural selection for learnability where an assumption of innateness is inconsequential and languages adapt over time due to a need for survival. The above plays a major role in the study of languages, especially in their properties, structure and how it developed with time or throughout human history to be the system it is today; providing valuable insights into language and the human race, language and the human cognition as well as language and its path to survival. Traditional transmission as a design feature is also significant in that it purports that while some aspects of language could possibly be inborn, the human race crucially acquire their language ability from other speakers. This is distinct from many animal communication systems because most animals are born with the innate knowledge, and skills necessary for survival. For example, honey bees have an inborn ability to perform and understand the waggle dance.  Controversy & Criticism  The main argument to the validity of traditional transmission has always been one of social versus biological construct. The concept of language being taught and learnt socially rather than being an innate instinct has been a minefield of debate for years. Specifically, the idea of language being taught extra-genetically has been met with countless criticism. These criticisms mostly stem from the proponents of the American linguist, Noam Chomsky and his school of thought. Chomsky was a supporter of generative grammar. He and his followers believed that humans possess the innate ability for the learning and acquisition of languages. This theory assumes an inborn capacity for language where language learning takes place from a place of priming. As such, Chomsky's view is that humans invariably have a certain language input at birth and therefore language learning after happens as enforcement based on the already present structure of grammar in the individual. Chomsky also introduced the concept of linguistic competence as \\"the system of linguistic knowledge possessed by native speakers of a language\\", to further support the idea of generative grammar. Linguistic competence as opposed to linguistic performance (what is actually uttered) focuses on the mental states, thought processes and representations related to language. Linguistic performance, on the other hand, is defined by Chomsky as the tangible use of language in concrete situations and circumstances. It involves the ideas of production and comprehension of language. The main distinction between performance and competence is the variable of speech errors where one might have full competence of language but yet, still succumb to speech errors in performance because competence and performance are fundamentally two different aspects of language. Related to generative grammar, Chomsky also proposed the idea of a \\"Universal Grammar\\" where he postulates that a specific set of structural rules of language are universal for all human languages which is also a very much controversial topic discussed widely, one of them being the prominent paper by Evans and Levinson (2009). Specifically, Chomsky believed that the reason that children acquired language so easily is due to the innate predisposition of language principles which then enables them to master complex language operations. This in particular is controversial to the ideas of traditional transmission which posits cultural learning and transmission across generations as the tool children capitalise on to acquire language. All in all, Chomsky's ideas and theories have served as the main opposing view to Hockett's design features, remaining highly controversial and a dominant area of research in the linguistics field of studies even till today. On another front, in the domain of evolutionary linguistics, Wacewicz & ≈ªywiczy≈Ñski have argued on the whole against Hockett's design features and why his perspective is largely incompatible to modern language evolution research. For traditional transmission, they argue that \\"the problem with cultural/traditional transmission so conceived is that, again, it has to do purely with the properties of the medium, i.e. the vocal patterns. Per their argument, this is only superficially, if at all, related to what truly counts about human cultural transmission. In their paper, they suggest that comparative research into areas such as critical periods of the acquisition of vocalizations (Marler and Peters 1987) and other areas of vocal learning might raise alternative views that have relevance to language evolution.Wacewicz, S., ≈ªywiczy≈Ñski, P. Language Evolution: Why Hockett‚Äôs Design Features are a Non- Starter. Biosemiotics 8, 29‚Äì46 (2015). https://doi.org/10.1007/s12304-014-9203-2 Hence, their criticisms towards traditional transmission seem to point at an alternate idea of the innate ability in humans for language, instead of being solely dependent on extra- genetic transmission via learning and teaching.

Harry Ice grew up in Kansas City and attended Wentworth Military Academy in Lexington, Missouri from 1936 to 1939. At Wentworth, he was on the football, basketball, track, and baseball teams, captaining both the basketball and track squads. He was named the school's best all-around athlete in 1938. He entered the University of Missouri in 1939, and did not initially go out for football. But legendary coach Don Faurot spotted Ice on the intramural fields, while playing for Beta Theta Pi, and convinced him to try out for the varsity. In 1940 and 1941, Ice established himself as one of the Tigers' top all-time running backs. In 1941, \\"Slippery Ice\\", as he was known, set a number of Missouri records as a member of Faurot's first split-T team that led the nation in rushing. Ice's records include 240 yards rushing (on only 8 carries) against Kansas in 1941, an average of 30.0 yards per in that same game, and a 95-yard touchdown run against Iowa State in 1941. His single game rushing record stood until 1998, and the other records still stand. Ice was an all-Big Six selection in 1941 as Missouri won the conference championship and went on to the Sugar Bowl, where he was the game's MVP. Ice played in the College All-Star Game in the summer of 1942, and was chosen to MU's All-Century Football Team. He also lettered twice in baseball. He joined the United States Army as a Second Lieutenant in January 1942, and was discharged as a Major in August 1946. He was overseas for thirty months in the Southwest Pacific Theater. He was in three campaigns and the occupation in Japan with the 33rd Infantry Division. He received the Combat Infantryman Badge, Bronze Star, Purple Heart with Oak Leaf Cluster and two special citations. Ice joined the M.U. athletic staff in 1952, and served in a variety of capacities, including interim athletic director and assistant athletic director, until his retirement in 1979.

Bullard was born in Allendale, South Carolina, and moved to Florida in 1980. In 1992, she was elected to the Florida House of Representatives from the 118th District, defeating Republican candidate John Minchew. She was re-elected without opposition in 1994, and in 1996, defeated Republican William \\"Bill\\" Greene. Bullard sought a final term in the House in 1998, and defeated Republican James Jones and Independent Denny Wood. She did not seek another term in 2000, and was succeeded by her husband, Edward B. Bullard. In 2002, Bullard sought election to the Florida State Senate from the 39th District, and, in the Democratic primary, faced former State Representative Ron Saunders, former State Representative John F. Cosgrove, Donald Jones, and State Representative Cindy Lerner. Bullard narrowly defeated Saunders to win her party's nomination by fewer than 800 votes, and in the general election, defeated Republican nominee Evaristo Marina in a landslide. Bullard faced a tough re-election campaign in 2004, when former State Representative Saunders, who had run two years prior, and Sheila Chamberlain, ran against her in the Democratic primary. However, Bullard defeated both Saunders and Chamberlain, moving onto the general election, where she crushed her Republican opponent, Joseph Delaney. In 2008, Bullard was unopposed for re-election and won a final term. She was unable to seek re-election in 2012, and her son, Dwight Bullard, was elected to replace her. Bullard died on March 16, 2013. She was absent from 2011 Florida Legislative Session after suffering a heart attack, returning to the Senate floor in 2012 to complete her term.

Repetition was considered necessary, and there had to be enough of it within the period before a consumer buys a product to influence his or her choice of brand.\\"Jones, John Philip. What Does Effective Frequency Mean in 1997? (Part 1 of 2). Journal of Advertising Research, 37 (4): 14-17, July 1997. .  Models/theories = Ebbinghaus = In 1879‚Äì80, Hermann Ebbinghaus conducted research on higher mental processes; he replicated the entire procedure in 1883‚Äì4. Ebbinghaus' methods achieved a remarkable set of results. He was the first to describe the shape of the learning curve. He reported that the time required to memorize an average nonsense syllable increases sharply as the number of syllables increases. He discovered that distributing learning trials over time is more effective in memorizing nonsense syllables than massing practice into a single session; and he noted that continuing to practice material after the learning criterion has been reached enhances retention. Using one of his methods called savings as an index, he showed that the most commonly accepted law of association, viz., association by contiguity (the idea that items next to one another are associated) had to be modified to include remote associations (associations between items that are not next to one another in a list). He was the first to describe primacy and recency effects (the fact that early and late items in a list are more likely to be recalled than middle items), and to report that even a small amount of initial practice, far below that required for retention, can lead to savings at relearning. He even addressed the question of memorization of meaningful material and estimated that learning such material takes only about one tenth of the effort required to learn comparable nonsense material.Hermann Ebbinghuas. (1885: English 1913) Memory . Intelegen Inc. This learning curve research has been used to help researches study advertising message retention. = Thomas Smith = Thomas Smith wrote a guide called Successful Advertising in 1885. The saying he used is still being used today. The first time people look at any given ad, they don't even see it. The second time, they don't notice it. The third time, they are aware that it is there. The fourth time, they have a fleeting sense that they've seen it somewhere before. The fifth time, they actually read the ad. The sixth time they thumb their nose at it. The seventh time, they start to get a little irritated with it. The eighth time, they start to think, \\"Here's that confounded ad again.\\" The ninth time, they start to wonder if they're missing out on something. The tenth time, they ask their friends and neighbors if they've tried it. The eleventh time, they wonder how the company is paying for all these ads. The twelfth time, they start to think that it must be a good product. The thirteenth time, they start to feel the product has value. The fourteenth time, they start to remember wanting a product exactly like this for a long time. The fifteenth time, they start to yearn for it because they can't afford to buy it. The sixteenth time, they accept the fact that they will buy it sometime in the future. The seventeenth time, they make a note to buy the product. The eighteenth time, they curse their poverty for not allowing them to buy this terrific product. The nineteenth time, they count their money very carefully. The twentieth time prospects see the ad, they buy what is offering. = Herbert E. Krugman = Herbert E. Krugman wrote \\"Why Three Exposures may be enough\\" while he was employed at General Electric.Herbert E. Krugman (1965). The Impact of Television Advertising: Learning Without Involvement. Public Opinion 29: 349-356.6. His theory has been adopted and widely use in the advertising arena. The following statement encapsulates his theory: \\"Let me try to explain the special qualities of one, two and three exposures. I stop at three because as you shall see there is no such thing as a fourth exposure psychologically; rather fours, fives, etc., are repeats of the third exposure effect. \\"Exposure No. 1 is...a \\"What is it?\\" type of... response. Anything new or novel no matter how uninteresting on second exposure has to elicit some response the first time...if only to discard the object as of no further interest...The second exposure...response...is \\"What of it?\\"...whether or not [the message] has personal relevance... \\"By the third exposure the viewer knows he's been through his \\"What is it's?\\" and \\"What of it's?,\\" and the third, then, becomes the true reminder . . . The importance of this view . . . is that it positions advertising as powerful only when the viewer...is interested in the [product message]...Secondly, it positions the viewer as...reacting to the commercial‚Äîvery quickly...when the proper time comes round. \\"There is a myth in the advertising world that viewers will forget your message if you don't repeat your advertising often enough. It is this myth that supports many large advertising expenditures...I would rather say the public comes closer to forgetting nothing they have seen on TV. They just \\"put it out of their minds\\" until and unless it has some use . . . and [then] the response to the commercial continues.\\" According to Krugman, there are only three levels of exposure in psychological, not media, terms: Curiosity, recognition and decision.

He is known in Chile for his study of social history and interpretations of social movements, particularly the recent student protests of 2006 and 2011‚Äì12. Salazar was born into a lower class religious Catholic family. His family lived in the Santiago shanty-town (poblaci√≥n) Manuel Montt. He studied history, sociology and philosophy at Universidad de Chile, and for time he was assistant of historian Mario G√≥ngora and classical historian H√©ctor Herrera Cajas. Salazar used to be a member of the Revolutionary Left Movement until 1973. In that year he was tortured in Villa Grimaldi by the military. Having been released from a military prison camp in 1976 he went into exile in the United Kingdom. There he obtained a scholarship for continued studies in University of Hull. He obtained a Ph.D. in Economic and Social History from that university in 1984. Next year he returned to Chile. Relatively unknown Salazar's breakthrough came in 1985. His subject of study has included peons, labourers, proletarians, child huachos and women. Salazar is one of the founders of the historiographic current known as Nueva Historia Social. Salazar considers history as a useful tool for social action. In interview he has declared himself a \\"leftist, critical social historian\\" and rejected the label \\"Marxist\\". Particular views Salazar describes the 2011-2012 Chilean student conflict as being the continuation of a long strife between popular citizen movements and civic and military dictatorships. In October 2011, Salazar led a campaign aiming to hold a citizen's plebiscite on the demands behind the 2011-2012 Chilean student protests. Salazar has been critical of various historical figures like Jos√© Miguel Carrera and Diego Portales. In addition Salazar has sparkled controversy by his criticism of contemporary student leader Camila Vallejo.

Murray, former governor of Oklahoma. Bonds were voted in the amount of $2,000 to erect the first building, a concrete-block, one-room structure, in 1910-11. This district was carved from a very small existing school. For a while, the school could support only one teacher, but by the 1914-15 term, the enrollment had increased to 89. This necessitated the creation of another room and the employment of a second teacher. In 1927-28 two years of high school credits were offered. Two years later, the high school offered all four years of credits and the first graduating class was in the spring of 1931. In the 2014 Bethany High School won the National Blue Ribbon Award.

History  The tower was built for Expo '70 and housed in the Festival Plaza building known as \\"Big Roof\\" designed by Japanese architect Kenzo Tange. The tip of the tower projected out of the Big Roof's ceiling due to the height of the building. After the completion of the tower projecting through the Big Roof, a Japanese science fiction writer, Sakyo Komatsu, looked at it and said he associated it with a sexual description in a Japanese novel, Season of the Sun, where a character broke through a sliding paper door.Shintaro Ishihara, The Season of the Sun The creator of the tower, Taro Okamoto, heard about it, and named the tower as the \\"Tower of the Sun\\".Data of the tower of the sun The tower was open to the public and visitors could enter inside during the expo, yet it was closed after the event. The gallery inside displayed a huge artwork called the \\"Tree of Life\\", which represented the evolution of creatures. Tsuburaya Productions partly produced the artwork. The Big Roof housing the tower was removed in 1979, causing the tower to be exposed for a long time. The tower has gradually deteriorated. Once a claim to demolish it arose, yet it was decided to be preserved and repair work began in November 1994, ending in March 1995.The Tower of the Sun, info On October 11 and 12, 2003, the inside of the Tower of the Sun was opened to a selected 1,970 people (the figure was chosen for the year the expo was held). Prior to the opening, over 24,000 people applied for it so the Commemorative Organization for the Japan World Exposition '70 made a decision to open the tower again in November and December in the same year. The event to release the inside irregularly continued, and over 40,000 peopleCommemorative Organization for the Japan World Exposition '70, about opening the inside of the tower in total visited the inside of the tower until October 2006. Due to the repair and renovation for the 40th anniversary event of the Expo '70 in 2010, access to the Tower's interior was closed again. It was reopened in 2018.

New features such as a reconstructed ‚ÄúSun of the Underworld‚Äù, complete with animation, were installed.  Overview  The tower's height is 70 metres, the diameter at the base is 20 metres, and each of the two arms is 25 metres long. The tower has currently three faces, two faces on the front, and a face in the back. The face located at the top, whose diameter is 11 metres, represents the future. An antenna attached to it works as a conductor. In the eyes of the face, Xenon arc lamps were used during the expo, however they became decrepit and broken down after the expo. On September 25, 2004, new lights were installed next to the old ones and lit to advertise the Expo 2005.The light of the tower, for 35 years A face between two arms represents the present, and a black face on the rear of the tower is the sun of the past. Originally another face, \\"Sun of the Underworld\\" was located on the basement floor, yet currently it has been moved to an unknown location. The jagged red paintings on the front of the tower represent thunder. Inside of the tower, an artwork called the \\"Tree of Life\\" was exhibited, and many miniatures and objects created by Tsuburaya Productions were suspended from the tree. It was 45 metres high and represents the strength of the life heading to the future.From a brochure of the Expo '70 In the tower, there were moving staircases surrounding the tree and a lift which enabled visitors to go to the upper floor. One of the lifts inside was connected to a part of the Big Roof through the opened wall, which was closed after the expo. Originally, \\"The Tower of Mother\\" and \\"The Tower of Youth\\" were also placed on the east and west area in the expo, both were created by Taro Okamoto, and later they were removed. A miniature version of the Tower of the Sun is located in the Taro Okamoto Museum of Art. The tower has also been listed as one of the Best 100 Media Arts in Japan by the Agency for Cultural Affairs. In popular culture In 1997, Naoko Yamano, guitarist and founding member of the Osaka-based pop/punk band Shonen Knife wrote a song called Tower of the Sun which appears on the band's 1997 album Brand New Knife.Shonen Life, The Tower of the Sun In 2007, the tower is briefly shown in the anime Moonlight Miles season 1 and 2. In 2014, Bandai created , a 288mm Chogokin toy replica of the Tower of the Sun that transforms into a giant robot. As part of ad campaign for the model, the tower is shown in a short animated sequence in which would transform and briefly fight a monster in same style as tokusatsu programs. The Tower of the Sun, as well as the Expo of 1970, plays a central role in Naoki Urasawa's manga: 20th Century Boys. In this series the tower becomes one of the main symbols of the \\"cult of the friend,\\" an evil association that wants to conquer the world. It also appears in the film I Wish. The Tower of the Sun, like many of Okamoto's works, was used as homage in the character of Deidara from the Naruto series. In the Tower's case, it is depicted as an explosion in the character's suicidal attack.

During the Middle Ages it was the weakest of the three towns that composed the city of K√∂nigsberg, the others being Altstadt and Kneiphof. Its territory is now part of the Leningradsky District of Kaliningrad, Russia. History L√∂benicht Church in 1908 =Early history= The predecessor of L√∂benicht was the Old Prussian fishing village Lipnick (also Liepenick and Lipnicken, meaning swamp villageGause I, p. 6) with its harbor Lipza,Guttzeit, p. 11 which was conquered by the Teutonic Knights during the 1255 conquest of Sambia. Although an initial German colony northwest of K√∂nigsberg Castle was destroyed during the 1262 Siege of K√∂nigsberg, the Altstadt (German for \\"old town\\") south of the castle was granted Kulm town rights in 1286. By the end of the 13th century settlement had spread east of Altstadt to Lipnick. Altstadt and the new settlement of craftsmen and farmers were divided by the Lebo or L√∂be, later known as the Katzbach, a stream running from the Schlossteich to the Pregel River. The K√∂nigsberg Komtur, Berthold Br√ºhaven, awarded the new settlement Kulm town rights in 1300. Although it was documented in 1299 as Nova civitas (Neustadt, new town), it was known as L√∂benicht by 1338. K√∂nigsberg's third town, Kneiphof, was founded in 1327. Each town had its own charter, market rights, church, and fortifications. L√∂benicht was the least powerful of K√∂nigsberg's three towns; unlike Kneiphof, L√∂benicht was not a rival to Altstadt. L√∂benicht's small Freiheiten suburbs were Anger to the east and Stegen to the southeast.Baczko, p. 182 These districts were granted to L√∂benicht by Grand Master Frederick of Saxony in 1506. Anger contained L√∂benicht's warehouses (see also Lastadie)M√ºhlpfordt, p. 135 and farmland.Karl, p.105 Stegen (or Steegen), originally used for lumber, developed into the Neuer Markt (new market).Boetticher, p. 15 Outlying villages and estates eventually controlled by L√∂benicht included Ponarth, Maraunen, Quednau, Radnicken, and the tile factory near the Oberteich.Gause II, p. 69 Aside from Anger and Stegen, L√∂benicht was bordered by Burgfreiheit to the north, Rossgarten to the northeast, Neue Sorge to the east, Sackheim to the southeast, and Altstadt to the west.Guttzeit, p. 12 =Thirteen Years' War= Altstadt and Kneiphof sent representatives to the Prussian Confederation in 1440, although L√∂benicht did not.Gause, K√∂nigsberg in Preu√üen, p. 41 As members of the Confederation, the K√∂nigsberg towns rebelled against the Teutonic Knights on 4 February 1454 at the beginning of the Thirteen Years' War and allied with King Casimir IV Jagiellon of Poland. The rebellion in K√∂nigsberg was supported by the merchant class and led by Altstadt's B√ºrgermeister, Andreas Brunau. Based upon the example of Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk), Brunau hoped to turn K√∂nigsberg into an autonomous city with control over all Sambia.Manthey, p. 32 On 19 June L√∂benicht's B√ºrgermeister, Hermann Stulmacher, paid fealty to the Polish chancellor, Jan Taszka Koniecpolski.Gause, K√∂nigsberg in Preu√üen, p. 42 However, Brunau lost the support of Altstadt and L√∂benicht on 24 March 1455 due to spontaneous opposition from craftsmen and workers, with the rebels retreating to Kneiphof.Armstedt, p. 97 L√∂benicht supported Plauen and Altstadt during the siege of the Kneiphof. The island town surrendered to Komtur Heinrich Reu√ü von Plauen on 14 July.Manthey, pp. 31-33 =Later history= View of the Neuer Markt and L√∂benicht Church L√∂benicht became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701. In the same year the three towns resisted the efforts of Burgfreiheit to form a proposed fourth town, Friedrichsstadt. By the Rath√§usliche Reglement of 13 June 1724, King Frederick William I of Prussia merged Altstadt, L√∂benicht, Kneiphof, and their respective suburbs into the united city of K√∂nigsberg.Gause II, p. 65 K√∂nigsberg Castle and its suburbs remained separate until the St√§dteordnung of Stein on 19 November 1808 during the era of Prussian reforms.Gause II, p. 334 Much of L√∂benicht, including its church, school, and hospital, burned down in a widespread fire on 11 November 1764 and had to be rebuilt. L√∂benicht was heavily damaged during the 1944 Bombing of K√∂nigsberg and 1945 Battle of K√∂nigsberg during World War II. Buildings which survived the war were subsequently demolished by the Soviet administration in Kaliningrad. Buildings The publisher Hartung'sche Verlagsdruckerei was based in the former L√∂benicht Town Hall from 1876-1906. The L√∂benicht Town Hall was later used by Hartung Verlag, one of the city's largest newspaper publishers. The Protestant L√∂benicht Church dated back to the 14th century and was rebuilt in the Rococo style in the 18th century. The quarter's secondary school was L√∂benicht Realgymnasium, also known as the St√§dtisches Realgymnasium. In 1531 a convent in L√∂benicht was converted into a hospital, which lasted until the great fire of 1764. The large rebuilt L√∂benicht Hospital was dedicated in 1772. It was deteriorating by the 20th century, however, and was dismantled in 1903. L√∂benicht Hospital's third incarnation was built not in L√∂benicht, but on Heidemannstra√üe near Sackheim Gate in eastern Sackheim. Most of K√∂nigberg's breweries were located in L√∂benicht during the 19th century, but by the 20th century they had been replaced by larger breweries in Ponarth, Sch√∂nbusch, and Wickbold.

She served as a member of the Florida Senate for ten years, representing parts of the Tampa Bay Area from 2006 to 2016. She was the Senate minority leader during her last two years in office. Prior to being elected to the Senate, Joyner served three terms in the Florida House of Representatives, representing an eastern Tampa-based district from 2000 to 2006. History Joyner was born in Lakeland, and attended Florida A&M; University, receiving her bachelor's degree in political science in 1964. She later attended the Florida A&M; University College of Law, graduating with her Juris Doctor in 1968. While attending FAMU, Joyner was twice arrested for her role in the civil rights movement for her protests in support of movie theater desegregation. After graduation, she worked as a legal assistant to State Representative Joe Lang Kershaw in 1969. Joyner was a founding partner in the law firm of Stewart, Joyner and Jordan-Holmes, and was the first black female attorney in Polk County and Hillsborough County. From 1984 to 1985, she served as the President of the National Bar Association, and was arrested for her role in a protest against apartheid during her tenure. In 1995, Joyner was appointed by then-President Bill Clinton to serve as the American representative at the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing. In 1991, Joyner was appointed to the Hillsborough County Aviation Authority by then-Governor Lawton Chiles, on which she served as the first black board member. She was criticized by Chiles for billing twenty five thousand dollars to the Authority for airline tickets to attend meetings that did not directly relate to aviation issues. Joyner played a role in the development of the Airport Minority Advisory Council and in promoting hiring diversity for the Authority. She resigned from the Authority in 1999. Florida House of Representatives Incumbent State Representative Les Miller was unable to seek another term in the Florida House of Representatives in 2000 due to term limits. Joyner ran to succeed him in the 59th District, which included Brandon and downtown Tampa. She was opposed in the Democratic primary by Frank Reddick, the President of the Sickle Cell Association of Hillsborough County. Because she and Reddick were the only two candidates who filed for the seat, the primary, which ordinarily would have been closed to only Democrats, was opened to the general electorate. Joyner and Reddick both campaigned on their support for reducing crime, increasing the availability of health care and child care, and creating good-paying jobs. Joyner significantly outraised Reddick, receiving campaign contributions from Bill McBride and Alex Sink. During the campaign, Reddick attacked Joyner for her alleged financial indiscretion on the Airport Authority and for allegedly losing touch with the community. However, Joyner handily defeated Reddick, winning 71% of the vote. When Joyner ran for re-election in 2002, she was opposed by Libertarian nominee Rex Curry. She campaigned on her support for revitalizing east Tampa with economic development projects and on her philosophy that the government should do more \\"to care for the most vulnerable in society.\\" She won re- election in a landslide, receiving 89% of the vote to Curry's 11%. She was re- elected without opposition in 2004. Florida Senate In 2006, Les Miller, whom Joyner had succeeded in the State House, opted to run for Congress in 2006 rather than seeking another term in the Florida Senate. Joyner ran to succeed him in the 18th District, which included parts of Apollo Beach, Bradenton, St. Petersburg, and Tampa in Hillsborough, Manatee, and Pinellas Counties. She faced Gerald White, an electricity company manager, in the Democratic primary, and was endorsed by the St. Petersburg Times. The Times, which noted her \\"mixed\\" record and criticized her for being \\"missing in action,\\" praised her for having \\"her priorities straight\\" and for being \\"a strong supporter of civil rights, health care, and open government.\\" During the campaign, her legislative office was vandalized when \\"racist and vulgar phrases\\" were scratched onto her office's door and the door's lock was damaged. After the incident, Joyner expressed sadness that someone could \\"spew such hatred and venom at another human being in the twenty-first century,\\" and called for an ongoing national discussion on racial issues. Joyner defeated White in the Democratic primary by a wide margin, winning 79% of the vote to his 21%, and advanced to the general election. In the general election, she was opposed by only a write-in candidate and won with nearly 100% of the vote. She was re-elected in 2010 without opposition. When the state's legislative districts were redrawn in 2012, Joyner ran for re-election in the 19th District, which contained most of the territory that she had previously represented. She was unopposed in both the primary and general elections, and won re-election to a final term uncontested. She was term-limited in 2016. While in the legislature, Joyner worked with State Representative Larry Ahern, a Republican, to author legislation that would make prosecuting identity theft easier by eliminating a legal requirement that the stolen personal information be used fraudulently. She strongly opposed legislation passed by the legislature that expedited the execution of inmates on death row, saying, \\"Is swift justice fair justice? We have seen cases where, years later, convicted people were exonerated.\\" During the confirmation process for Public Service Commissioner Lisa Edgar, Joyner lead a bipartisan coalition of Senators to support her in her nomination for a third term, praising her for having \\"a reputation for character and integrity,\\" and rejecting claims made by the opposition that she was too friendly with utility companies. For the 2014-2016 legislative term, Joyner was elected by her colleagues to serve as the floor leader of the Senate Democrats.

Early life Paul Fredericq was born in the Sleepstraat in Ghent, Belgium. A student at the Koninklijk Atheneum of Ghent, where Max Rooses and Jacob Heremans influenced him. He became a Protestant in his youth and his tendencies in religion, as in politics, were liberal. In 1871 he graduated as a high school teacher from the University of Li√®ge and started working as a teacher in Mechelen and Arlon. In 1875, Fredericq received a special doctorate in historical sciences, with his study Essai sur le r√¥le politique et social des ducs de Bourgogne dans les Pays-Bas, and he became professor of history at the University of Li√®ge. Academic career Cover of Fredericq's history of the Flemish Movement After Jacob Heremans became emeritus, Paul Fredericq became professor of history at Ghent University in 1883. His courses included Dutch literature and practical exercises about Belgian history. Characterizing his sociability: Fredericq also taught in the relaxed surroundings of his home. It was probably during this period that he befriended the students of the 't zal wel gaan movement. Fredericq was very active in the liberal wing of the Flemish Movement. During the period of 1891-95, he was a liberal member of the city council, and became president of the local Willemsfonds organization and editor in chief of the liberal magazine Het Volksbelang. Then founded the Hooger Onderwijs voor het Volk (\\"higher education for the people\\") in 1894, an experiment to close the education-gap between the elite and the workforce. However, Fredericq was especially important during the struggle to include Dutch into the Belgian education system. His activism culminated with his Schets eener Geschiedenis der Vlaamsche Beweging (1906‚Äì09), a short history of the Flemish Movement. During World War I, on the invasion of Belgium by the Germans, Fredericq was active in encouraging the patriotic feelings of his countrymen in occupied Belgium and supporting non-violent resistance to the invader. As a result, he was deported to Germany on 16 March 1916, together with his colleague, the historian Henri Pirenne. He was interned successively at G√ºtersloh, Jena and B√ºrgel. The ordeal weakened him both physically and mentally. After the war, he became rector at Ghent University in 1919. But quickly resigned after only a few weeks, disappointed by the anti-Flemish backlash. He died shortly afterwards in Ghent.

H. \\"Bud\\" Frazier is a heart surgeon and director of cardiovascular surgery research at the Texas Heart Institute (THI), best known for his work in mechanical circulatory support (MCS) of failing hearts using left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) and total artificial hearts (TAH). His achievements in heart surgery include the implantation of the first long-term LVAD, the pulsatile HeartMate I in 1986, and the replacement of a diseased heart with a continuous flow device using two HeartMate II pumps, in 2011. His most significant achievements have been in the development of the non-pulsatile implantable LVADs, the Jarvik, HeartMate II and HeartWare. In 1963, Frazier entered medicine at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) on completion of a degree in history from the University of Texas-Austin. Under the mentorship of at first Michael E. DeBakey at BCM, and then Denton Cooley at the THI, he performed research on the testing of LVADs as a form of MCS. He continued to lead and become significantly influential in heart surgery and the development and clinical implementation of LVADs and his surgical career at the THI has spanned over fifty years. Other positions have included chief of the transplant service at Baylor St. Luke's Medical Center (part of the Catholic Health Initiatives system) in Houston. Early life and education Oscar Howard Frazier Jr. was born and grew up in Stephenville, Texas, in a Methodist household. Both his parents were teachers and his grandfather nicknamed him \\"Bud\\" after a distant cousin who was killed in a West Texas saloon shootout at the turn of the nineteenth century. A \\"former high school football star\\", he was initially destined for a career in football, having been asked by Darrell Royal to play for the University of Texas at Austin as a kicker. However, after attending only a few two-a-day football practices, a leg injury ended his football career. Despite this, he later became a black belt in Karate. Frazier, at first gained admission to study history and literature at law school, but switched to medicine, after being influenced by the writings of Anton Chekhov and William Carlos Williams. Interviewed for medicine on the 4 July, he won a place at Baylor College of Medicine, atypically on the ability to answer a question on history. He subsequently completed his BA degree in history from the University of Texas-Austin in 1963 before commencing medical education. Medical education Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) As a medical student at BCM in 1964, he assisted in experimental total artificial hearts (TAH) research, which placed him under the mentorship of Michael E. DeBakey, Domingo Liotta and Denton A. Cooley, who five years later, controversially became the first to implant one. In 1966, at the age of 25, while still a medical student of DeBakey, who he described as a ‚Äútough taskmaster‚Äù, an experience with a teenager who had just had an aortic valve repair, left a lasting impression on him. Frazier was required to manually massage the teenager's heart following a cardiac arrest. He has since repeatedly recounted \\"that as long as I was massaging that kid's heart, he would wake up... I thought then, and I've often returned to this: If my hand can keep this kid alive, why couldn't we make a device to do the same?\\" It was this incident and the experience with DeBakey's research that instilled his interest in cardiac surgery and MCS's. Of the twenty four students that Frazier started his residency with, only five were left. DeBakey, intolerable of error, fired most. Upon graduating with an MD in 1967, he also received the DeBakey Award for Outstanding Surgical Student before then completing his residency at Baylor Affiliated Hospitals in 1968. Vietnam Frazier served in the United States Army from 1968 to 1970 and distinguished himself as a flight surgeon in the U.S. Army 48th Assault Helicopter Company in Vietnam. Once, he was shot down and on return to the States, has described how demoralised he felt about what men were capable of during war. For his achievements, he received three medals, the Combat Flight Medal, Vietnamese Navy Medal, and the Vietnamese Distinguished Service Medal. Surgical career After Vietnam, Frazier returned as a surgical resident to BCM. He remained at BCM until 1974 when he gravitated towards LVAD-research at the near-by THI and subsequently joined Baylor‚Äôs new rival Cooley, at the THI for further surgical training, which he completed in 1976. = Left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) and total artificial hearts (TAH) = Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, he continued experimental work toward the development of the implantable long-term pulsatile HeartMate I LVAD. In 1976, he worked with John C. Norman and the first intra-abdominal LVAD. In 1985, during his tenure on the advisory board of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Frazier recommended that research be initiated on a TAH that would be fully implantable and that would allow people to be discharged and to live a normal lifestyle. In 1986, Frazier successfully used the HeartMate I LVAD in a person with severe irreversible heart failure who was waiting for a heart transplant. Driven by compressed air, the HeartMate LVAD had a textured blood-contacting inner surface, in contrast to a smooth surface. This encouraged a living lining of endothelial cells resembling the inner surfaces of arteries and veins and hence required less blood thinning drugs. Over the course of four decades, his work in the field of other LVAD prototypes, continued with experimental studies that resulted in the first intravascular, implantable, continuous-flow pump (Hemopump), which he first implanted into a human in April 1988. When funding for TAH research was restored in January 1991, Frazier became involved in further animal experiments. In 1994, he instigated research on the HeartWare LVAD and described the first long-term clinical use of a LVAD. This person was the first to make hospital discharge with a LVAD. His most significant contribution was the development of the nonpulsatile implantable LVADs, the Jarvik, HeartMate II and HeartWare. After more than ten years of research, in 2000, he performed the first implant of the Jarvik 2000 LVAD into a human, also a continuous flow pump. By the end of 2013, Frazier and his THI team had implanted their 1,000th LVAD, more than fifty years after Cooley founded the THI and just short of fifty years after DeBakey at BCM was awarded the original NHI grant for the development of an artificial heart.Shelley (2018), p.318 His innovations in the surgical treatment of severe heart failure, heart transplantation and MCS to be used either to substitute for or to assist the pumping action of the human heart led to the THI gaining a reputation as a global leader of transplantation and MCS programmes. Frazier performed more than 1,300 heart transplants and implanted 1,000 LVADs, exceeding the performance of any other contemporary surgeon in the world during his career. = Successful implantation of a continuous flow device = 301x301px In March 2011, Craig Lewis was suffering from amyloidosis and not eligible for heart transplant due to the severity and extent of the disease, affecting also his kidney and liver. Unsuitable for a heart transplant, temporary mechanical TAH or LVAD, his small diseased heart was replaced with a continuous flow device, a pair of HeartMate II pumps, an apparatus of two pumps embraced together, following six years of research on more than fifty calves at the Texas Institute. He awoke from a coma and spent the last five weeks of his life interacting with his family. During the following year, Frazier and his colleague William Cohn engaged with the public and professionals on their experiences. Their TEDMED talk introduced them to Daniel Timms, who was driven to find a technological resolution and whose father had died of heart failure. Timms had an idea and sought out Frazier and Cohn in the States. The surgeons became interested, particularly with the idea that Timms's device had the potential to be a small size. Trialed in numerous calves between 2013 and 2016, some were able to run a treadmill after implantation. Appointments Frazier has been Professor of surgery at the University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston, Clinical professor of surgery at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and Tenured professor at BCM He has served on the editorial boards of several medical journals, including Circulation, the Journal of the American Heart Association, and The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation. He was a chairman of the federal affairs committee for the American Society for Artificial Internal Organs and served on other prominent national committees, including the education committee of the American Society of Transplant Surgeons and the advisory board of the NHLBI. Frazier served as president of The Denton A. Cooley Surgical Society and the American Society for Artificial Internal Organs.

It is a conflation of The War of the Worlds, the Cthulhu Mythos, and the biography of H. P. Lovecraft. Plot summary The story begins on August 12, 1898, twenty-nine days after the death of eight- year-old Howard Philip Lovecraft's father. Howard observes a Martian cylinder crash into Federal Hill, an event that he had been predicting in his dreams for three years.Dreams and their predictive nature were a common theme in Lovecraft's writing; this is also similar to the dreams of Wilcox in The Call of Cthulhu. Being a \\"gentleman of pure Yankee stock [of] the true chalk-white Nordic type\\"See Lovecraft's views on race. Howard decides to investigate the landing, and witnesses the opening of the cylinder and emergence of the Martian occupants. When the Martians fire upon onlookers with their heat rays, he faints. Howard reawakens three days later in his home. His mother, blissfully ignorant of the danger in staying behind in Martian-occupied Providence,In observing this, Howard notes that \\"it was perhaps a blessing that the human mind is unable to correlate its contents,\\" reflecting the famous opening line of The Call of Cthulhu. informs him that he was taken into the Martian cylinder, before being rescued by a Brown University librarian named Armitage.Brown was the basis for Lovecraft's Miskatonic University. Howard observes the spread of the red weed and the movement of fighting machines and feels an intense longing to explore the crash site, but realizes that his mother will not let him. He resorts to drugging her with a sedative in her malted milk, before heading out into the city. Howard arrives at St. John's Church, where he witnesses a tripod placing an artifact into the steeple and to which he feels the strong pull. Climbing to its top, he finds a glowing trapezohedronA reference to The Haunter of the Dark. accompanied by a strange sound of distant flutes.In Lovecraft's work, the sound of flutes is associated with Nyarlathotep. Picking up the object, Lovecraft is surrounded by a shifting, sentient unearthly colour. It asks if he is \\"one of us,\\" stating that prior to the invasion, a number of Martian minds were telepathically sent to occupy human bodies to report, with some failing to return.These are references to the practices of the Great Race of Yith from The Shadow Out of Time. It begins to relate the story of the \\"Martians\\" history to Howard. The species originated in another solar system, emigrating to this one ages ago. They established two colonies, one on Mars that thrived and one in an area of Antarctica that was destroyed due to climate change. The survivors on Mars engaged in selective breeding programs that created an advanced, immortal physical form.These are references to the Elder Things from At the Mountains of Madness. As a side effect, some Martians developed the capability to engage in astral projection, and made contact with the other two races of the system: Humans on Earth, and a \\"fungoid race\\" on a distant planet. The Martians engaged in trade with the fungoid race, entering a golden age and building \\"labyrinthine Cyclopean structures\\" before entering a decline marked with a population shrinkage and increasingly decadent artwork. However, this collapse ends with a discovery beneath Syrtis Major: an underground series of impenetrable vaults that the fungoid beings explained as being the home of the elder godlike beings that were Mars's first masters, and would return from their undead dreaming when the stars were aligned.This is a reference to Cthulhu and his star-spawn. This discovery sent the normally cool and calculating Martians into a frenzy of terror, and they destroyed as many of the elder gods' idols as they could find, before finally deciding to leave Mars for Earth, where the elder gods have no interest. It was for this reason that the Martians sent out their psychic spies - of which Howard apparently was one. By this time, the colour out of space begins to fade, and Howard finds himself on Mars, in a vast hall filled with \\"mathematically-perfect music\\".This could refer to the speech of the Elder Things and their shoggoth imitators from At the Mountains of Madness, or to the eponymous Music of Erich Zann. Howard enters the hall, and as he does, the Martian inhabitants begin to exit in fear; Howard realized the cause when he looks up and sees that one of the feared elder gods is standing within the hall. Howard approaches it - and realizes that he is standing before a mirror.This is a reference to the ending twist of The Outsider. The narration states that the shock of this sent Howard back to Earth, with no memories of the event, and in later years he became one of the skeptics who claimed there had never been a Martian invasion of the Earth. Other notes *Howard described the Martians as eldritch in appearance, and uses descriptions similar to the appearance of Cthulhu and the Elder Things. *The narrative notes Howard's early rejection of Santa Claus and embrace of atheism. *Howard's mother refers to him as Abdul Alhazred. *Howard mentions cylinders landing in London, Paris, St. Louis, and Texas (referring to other stories from Global Dispatches) and also mentions the irony of Martians landing in Providence's Italian section when it was Giovanni Schiaparelli who discovered the Martian canals. *Howard mentions that one of the very few things in the world that seemed true to him were \\"certain tales in The Arabian Nights\\", echoing statements of Lovecraftian characters concerning the Necronomicon. *The back cover of Global Dispatches depicts three Martian tripods excavating something amid icebound glaciers; this is presumably them seeking the remains of their lost Antarctic colony.

The film was produced by Saban Entertainment and distributed by Roger Corman's New Concorde. The film was broadcast on the TV in 1996 under the title Star Quest. Plot In 2035, global warming rendered the Earth barely inhabitable and its human population is on the verge of extinction. The Earth Federation sends a space ship on a century-long trip to a distant planet Trion which could be suitable for colonization. The eight crew-members come from Russia, United States, China, United Kingdom, France, and Saudi Arabia. As the ship approaches Trion, the crew wakes from hibernation. They immediately find a decomposed corpse of the Captain in his capsule. The ship's XO, Commander Hollis, assumes command. When he reads a secure transmission from Earth received while they were sleeping, he commits suicide, leaving a note that he \\"joins his loved ones\\". The new CO, Lieutenant Jammad, reveals the content of the message: the Earth has been devastated in a nuclear holocaust. Zinovitz discovers that the ship's systems have been tampered with. A fight for power ensues and Becker, as a representative of the government, relieves Jammad from command. He is soon found dead in a malfunctioned virtual reality simulator. The remaining crew-members suspect that Becker killed the officers and use force to arrest her, discovering in process that she is an android. When questioned, Becker denies any guilt then sets off the self-destruction sequence. Granier and Han are too devastated to continue and commit suicide with a morphine overdose, and Reese and Zinovitz make it to the escape capsule. As the countdown reaches zero, they find themselves in an underground simulation facility stationed on Earth. There was no space flight ‚Äì it is their final test, an \\"extreme stress simulation\\" scenario which involved the death of the commanding officer and multiple system failures. The crew have only been in hibernation for 6 months, and Hollis, Jammad and Becker apparently knew about the test. However the nuclear war on Earth was indeed real, and the facility is empty and abandoned. The film ends with a view of a destroyed city, as Reese and Zinovitz look on to uncertain future.

In their lengthy positive review of its 1996 television release, New York Daily News began with the qualification \\"Were this the average USA Network or Sci-Fi Channel telemovie, I'd say the shelf is where it belongs, and that it ought to ferment for at least another decade. Star Quest, however, is an above-average effort especially if graded on the USA/Sci-Fi curve\\". They wrote, \\"because of the cast, and a few nice plot twists and surprises, Star Quest ends up being a good effort in this genre certainly good enough to have been released before now\\". They concluded \\"Rick Jacobson has faith in all his actors: Some scenes are photographed in long extended master shots, while others rely totally upon the talents and closeups of single performers. Brilliant? No. Fun? Yes\\". =Awards and nominations= The film received a 1996 Saturn Award nomination for 'Best Genre Video Release' from Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films.

Nelson and Aronberg worked together to investigate European insurance companies that refused to honor World War II era policies sold to victims of the Holocaust. Working with members of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), the investigation led to the establishment of the International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims (ICHEIC) and the enactment of Florida's Holocaust Victims Assistance Act to ensure that insurance claims of Holocaust victims were expeditiously identified and properly paid, compensated, or returned. = Florida Assistant Attorney General - Economic Crimes = Aronberg worked as an Assistant Attorney General in the Economic Crimes Division of the Florida Attorney General's Office on two separate occasions. In 2000, President Bill Clinton selected Aronberg to be a White House Fellow. After the Fellowship was completed in September 2001, Aronberg returned to the Economic Crimes Division.  Phone-Scam Psychic \\"Miss Cleo\\" and the Psychic Readers Network  Aronberg investigated late-night television celebrity, Youree Harris, a/k/a \\"Miss Cleo,\\" and the Psychic Readers Network for deceptive marketing practices.

Aronberg‚Äôs 2009 bill, signed into law by Florida Governor Charlie Crist at a bill signing ceremony at Fort Lauderdale‚Äôs Port Everglades, matched Florida security law to the federal requirements. The bill received unanimous support from labor unions and maritime businesses, leading the Associated Industries of Florida‚Äôs Maritime Council to name Aronberg as ‚ÄúLegislator of the Year‚Äù for his work to improve port security while expanding Florida‚Äôs global position as a leading exporter. = Public Safety & Criminal Justice = Opioid Abuse  When Aronberg was elected to the Florida Senate in 2002, he followed up on his investigation of Purdue Pharma by calling attention to the growing opioid crisis. In 2010, the Florida legislature enacted legislation co-sponsored by Aronberg to regulate the pain clinic industry and to limit the dispensing of narcotics such as oxycodone.  Anti-Looting  In 2007, he was successful in passing an anti-looting law that increased penalties for specific thefts and burglaries committed after the Governor has declared a state of emergency. Gang Violence During 2007 and 2008, Aronberg pushed the Legislature to pass tough anti-gang legislation. The language in Aronberg's proposal, which was enacted into law in 2008, increased penalties for habitual offenders convicted of gang-related crimes and stiffened sanctions for witness tampering and harassment. The legislation also banned gang members from possessing bulletproof vests during the commission of a crime. Sexual Violence Aronberg sponsored a bill to eliminate the statute of limitations for child victims of sexual abuse. His bill, SB 870, passed both the House and Senate unanimously and was signed into law by Governor Crist.

Aronberg was reappointed to two more terms by Florida Bar Presidents Michael Higer and Michelle Suskauer, respectively. = Task Forces = In early 2016, Aronberg launched a task force to protect seniors from scams.  Sober Homes Task Force  Aronberg‚Äôs most notable task force is his Sober Homes Task Force, which has helped to clean up the fraud and abuse in the drug recovery industry in Palm Beach County, also known as \\"The Florida Shuffle.\\" Since October 2016, the Task Force has made more than 85 arrests for patient brokering and insurance fraud, and has led to new Florida laws and regulations that have become the model for other states. Aronberg's efforts also convinced Google to restrict advertisements and improve screening for addiction treatment. The crackdown in rogue sober homes and corrupted drug treatment led to an approximate 40% decrease in opioid overdose deaths in Palm Beach County in 2018, compared to 2017. Aronberg's Task Force has received national attention for its work to combat the opioid epidemic, including a feature story on Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly on June 25, 2017, and a 60 Minutes interview on September 30, 2018.

Since the program‚Äôs inception, thousands of defendants have entered the program and very few have committed a DUI again. The most well-known defendant to enter Aronberg's program was golfer Tiger Woods, whose 2017 DUI case made international news. = Corey Lewandowski Case = Aronberg gained national media attention during the 2016 Presidential Election when he announced he would not move forward with a battery charge against Corey Lewandowski, Donald Trump's campaign manager. Jupiter Police had charged Lewandowski with misdemeanor battery after former Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields alleged that he grabbed her after a Trump press conference on March 8 at Trump International Golf Club. = Nouman Raja Case = As State Attorney, Aronberg filed charges of manslaughter by culpable negligence and attempted first- degree murder with a firearm against Palm Beach Gardens police officer Nouman Raja for the killing of 31-year-old musician and housing inspector, Corey Jones, a black man who had been waiting for help on a highway after his car broke down. On March 7, 2019, a jury found Raja guilty as charged, making him the first officer in Florida to be convicted of an on-duty shooting in 30 years. Circuit Court Judge Joseph Marx sentenced Raja to 25 years in prison. Morning Joe Aronberg has become a weekly guest on MSNBC's Morning Joe to discuss legal issues, particularly those related to the criminal justice system.

He served as Professor of the Old Testament and Dean of McCormick Theological Seminary in Chicago, Illinois from 1924-1954. Early life Ovid Sellers was born in his mother's hometown of Waco, Texas in 1884, and grew up on the campus of Wentworth Military Academy in Lexington, Missouri. He graduated from Wentworth at age 13, the youngest in the history of the school. He earned an A.B. from the University of Chicago in 1904, a B.D. from McCormick Theological Seminary, becoming an ordained Presbyterian minister, in 1914, and a Ph.D from Johns Hopkins University in 1922. His studies concentrated largely on the Old Testament and ancient languages, including Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Aramaic, Egyptian Hieroglyphics, Syriac, and Akkadian Cuneiform. His father, Sandford Sellers, was superintendent of Wentworth Military Academy, and Ovid returned to fill positions at the Academy while gaining his education, serving variously as instructor (1905‚Äì06, 1910‚Äì12), coach, and headmaster (1919‚Äì21). He also was the editor of the local paper, the Lexington Intelligencer News, from 1907-11. In World War I, he served as a chaplain and First Lieutenant in the 17th Field Artillery, Second Division, AEF. Career =Dean of McCormick Theological Seminary= After getting his doctorate from Johns Hopkins, he became a Professor of the Old Testament at McCormick Theological Seminary, serving in that position from 1924 to 1954, and as Dean from 1934 to 1954. He periodically served as a visiting professor at the University of Chicago. =Discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls= He was Director of the American Schools of Oriental Research in Jerusalem in 1948-49 and was immediately thrust into the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls. In early September 1948, Mar Samuel, who had acquired the first four scrolls soon after their discovery in 1947, showed Sellers some additional scroll fragments that he had acquired. A few weeks later, on September 23, 1948, Sellers boarded a small twin engine Arab Airways biplane, flying from Beirut to Amman. Travel was very dangerous. The British mandate in Palestine ended on May 15, 1948. War broke out immediately, and peace would not be restored until November. While en route, Sellers' plane was intercepted and attacked by an Israeli fighter aircraft, forcing it to crash-land in Transjordan territory. Three of the six on board were killed, with Sellers as one of the survivors. A United Nations investigation led by Ralph J. Bunche found that the Provisional government of Israel was \\"responsible for a serious breach of the terms of the Truce as a result of unjustified attacks made by an Israeli fighter aircraft upon the Transjordan aircraft, resulting in the deaths of three persons, burns and injuries to three other persons, as well as the destruction of the attacked aircraft, and the incursion upon Transjordan territory by the Israeli fighter aircraft.\\" In 1950, Bunche would be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to bring peace to Palestine. Sellers recuperated and returned to his job within a few weeks. By the end of 1948, nearly two years after the discovery of the scrolls, no scholar had yet located the cave where the fragments had been found. With the unrest in the country, no large scale search could be undertaken. Sellers attempted to get the Syrians to help locate the cave, but they demanded more money than Sellers could offer. The cave was finally discovered on January 28, 1949 by a UN observer, and Sellers brought his box brownie camera to take the first photos of the cave, which were soon published in Life Magazine. In an attempt to date the scrolls, Sellers took some linen found in the cave, presumably from an outer wrapping of the scrolls, and brought it back to the University of Chicago. Unfortunately, the carbon-14 test, done at Chicago in 1950, was inconclusive, with a range from 245 BCE to 245 CE. It was later found that the carbon-14 test's margin of error was at 500 years. Sellers was a staff member on 10 archaeological expeditions in Palestine, three of which he directed. Retirement and personal life He retired from McCormick in 1954, and moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico the following year. He served as a Lecturer at the School of Theology in Djakarta, Indonesia in 1955, and returned to the American Schools of Oriental Research in 1957-58 as Professor of Archaeology. He married Katherine Wilson Sellers on June 1, 1918. They had three children: Roger Sellers, Elizabeth \\"Betty\\" Sellers Harter and Lucia Sellers Butler, and eight grandchildren. Death Ovid Rogers Sellers died in his hometown of Lexington, Missouri on July 7, 1975 at age 90. He is buried in Machpelah Cemetery in Lexington.

The play involves a female professor and her interactions with a student. Production history Third premiered at Washington D.C.'s Theater J, in January‚ÄìFebruary 2004 as a one-act play, directed by Michael Barakiva and featuring Kathryn Grody.Theater archives potomacstages.com, accessed May 21, 2009 The Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts production opened Off-Broadway at the Mitzi Newhouse Theater, in previews on September 29, 2005 and closing on December 18, 2005. It was directed by Daniel J. Sullivan, a frequent artistic collaborator with Wasserstein. The cast of Third included Dianne Wiest as Laurie Jameson and Charles Durning. Jason Ritter, actor-son of John Ritter, played the part of Woodson Bull, III, the student accused of plagiarism. Ritter won the Clarence Derwent Award and the Martin E. Segal Award for his performance of the title character. The sets were designed by Thomas Lynch, costumes by Jennifer von Mayrhauser, and lighting by Pat Collins.Brantley, Ben. As Feminism Ages, Uncertainty Still Wins. New York Times. 25 October 2005. Original music was by Robert Waldman and the sound design was by Scott Stauffer. Plot The play takes place at a small New England college during one academic year. It focuses on the life of a female college professor at a prestigious liberal arts college, Laurie Jameson, and how her life and fundamental assumptions are challenged by an encounter with a student, Woodson Bull, III. The professor and student have strongly divergent personal and political characteristics. Because of these differences, the professor accuses the student of plagiarism when he turns in an assignment that seems, to her, to be beyond his ability to produce. The play grapples with the issues of stereotyping and identity politics, as well as generational and family issues. Critical response The berkshirefinearts.com reviewer wrote: \\"Easily, it is among her wittiest, wisest, and perhaps most personal play...Set at an unnamed, elite, New England liberal arts college, this play's central character, Professor Laurie Jameson, could be considered one in the line of Wasserstein's \\"uncommon women\\" of middle age. Perhaps she is smugly more certain of her ideas than many of the playwright's other previous major female characters.\\"Favermann, Mark. \\"Third, the Final Play by Wendy Wasserstein\\", berkshirefinearts.com, January 17, 2008 Ben Brantley, in his review in The New York Times, wrote \\"Like Heidi, Laurie is a strong and vulnerable, independent and emotionally needy woman. She is, in other words, a feminine feminist of the stripe that has endeared Ms. Wasserstein to many theatergoers over the years... It's the certainty of uncertainty in life that makes \\"Third,\\" ... so affecting despite itself. Using the hot button of academic plagiarism to trigger the plot, \\"Third\\" suffers from problems common to Ms. Wasserstein's plays: an overly schematic structure, a sometimes artificial-feeling topicality...

He served in the Florida Senate from 2006 to 2016, representing parts of Broward County. He was the Democratic nominee for Chief Financial Officer of Florida in the 2018 election. Early life and career Ring was born in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1970. He grew up in Canton, Massachusetts and attended Canton Public Schools. He attended Syracuse University, graduating in 1992 with a Bachelors of Applied Science in advertising. Ring was one of the early employees of Yahoo, opening the company's first East Coast office and working to build the company up. In 2001, Ring moved to Florida, working as an executive in other tech and innovation startups. In 2018, Jeremy Ring wrote a book called \\"We Were Yahoo\\" which discusses his time working at Yahoo. Florida Senate In 2006, when incumbent Democratic State Senator Skip Campbell was unable to seek re- election due to term limits, Ring ran to succeed him in the 32nd District, which included Coral Springs, Pompano Beach, and Sunrise in northeastern Broward County. He faced Broward County Mayor Benjamin Graber and James W. Haddad in the Democratic primary, and invested nearly a million dollars of his own money to develop an effective field program. Ring defeated Graber and Haddad with 55% of the vote to Graber's 38% and Haddad's 7%. He faced only write-in opposition in the general election and won. In 2010, Ring was opposed in the general election by Patrick Laffey, a condo association manager and the Republican nominee. The Sun-Sentinel endorsed Ring for re-election, praising his \\"willingness to work with rival Republicans to advance public policy\\" and his \\"firmer grasp of business development and the importance of properly funded and targeted university investments.\\" Ring ended up defeating Laffey in a landslide and received 63% of the vote. Following the reconfiguration of the state's legislative districts in 2012, Ring was moved into the 29th District, which retained most of the territory that he had previously represented, while expanding westward into Weston. He won the Democratic primary uncontested, and faced college student Soren Swensen, the Republican nominee, in the general election. Ring campaigned on his bipartisan credentials and his willingness to work with Republicans, saying, \\"I try not to take a political vote. I try not to take a vote based on the next election. It may not align with a political party. I'm not the most ideological person in the Florida Legislature.\\" The Sun-Sentinel endorsed him for re-election, arguing, \\"He's one of the few state lawmakers that can talk authoritatively about venture capital strategies one minute and devise a bill to tweak a problematic law to help city pension plans stay solvent the next.\\" Ring easily defeated Swensen with 64% of the vote to win his final term in the State Senate. While serving in the Senate, Ring voted against an election reform bill sponsored by Republicans that aimed to expand early voting times following long lines in 2012, noting that despite it having \\"some decent provisions,\\" it did not go far enough in ensuring that enough early voting days were provided. While serving in the legislature, Ring requested approval to work for Sterling Partners, a private equity firm that aimed to win state contracts, as a consultant. He emphasized that there was \\"nothing unethical or illegal about it\\" and that he would \\"not...be a lobbyist on their behalf.\\" Ultimately, he received permission from the Florida Commission on Ethics to do so. In 2014, Ring applied for the presidency of Florida Atlantic University, but ultimately was not selected as a finalist for the position. Though he had previously indicated that he would not be a candidate for any position before his term was up, he considered running for Chief Financial Officer of Florida in 2014 when the incumbent CFO, Jeff Atwater, who had also applied for the FAU presidency, was selected as a finalist. Ultimately, Atwater was not selected and Ring did not run for his position. Subsequent media reports said Ring, with a \\"net worth of $13.7 million and an income of $1.2 million in 2014,\\" was considering running for the Democratic nomination to succeed Florida Governor Rick Scott in 2018. Ring announced on May 31, 2017 that he was entering the 2018 race for Florida CFO. He won the Democratic nomination on August 28, 2018. On November 6, 2018, Ring lost the general election to Republican incumbent Jimmy Patronis, 51% to 48%.

The squadron was formed in March 1943 and was deployed to Merauke in Dutch New Guinea in July that year. While No. 86 Squadron was stationed at Merauke until April 1944, it saw little combat. After being transferred back to Australia its aircraft and personnel were transferred to other units, and only a nucleus of the squadron remained. While it was re- equipped with new aircraft in June 1945, the war ended before the squadron was ready for combat and it was disbanded in December 1945. History No. 86 Squadron was formed at Gawler, South Australia, on 4 March 1943 and was equipped with Curtiss P-40M Kittyhawk fighter aircraft.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 92 In May that year it moved to Townsville, Queensland, in May where it completed its training.Eather (1995), p. 97 In early July 1943 No. 86 Squadron moved to Merauke in Dutch New Guinea to protect this base against Japanese air attack. Until this point the base had been protected by CAC Boomerang fighters of No. 84 Squadron flying out of Horn Island, but the completion of an airfield at Meruake allowed a Kittyhawk squadron to take on this duty. The decision to station a fighter squadron at Merauke was made in response to concerns that the Japanese could potentially attack and occupy the strategically located settlement, and the Australian Army garrison there was also expanded.Odgers (1968), p. 114 While there was generally little Japanese activity in the area by the time the squadron arrived, on 27 July sixteen No. 86 Squadron Kittyhawks were scrambled to intercept four Japanese aircraft which had been detected by radar. The Japanese aircraft were able to leave the area before the squadron could make contact with them, however. A force of 16 Japanese Mitsubishi G4M bombers and the same number of fighters raided Merauke on 9 September and were intercepted by 14 Kittyhawks from No. 86 Squadron. While most of the Kittyhawks suffered gun malfunctions and were unable to engage the Japanese, the squadron shot down two G4Ms and a Nakajima Ki-43 fighter without loss. From September 1943, the RAAF units in the Merauke‚ÄìTorres Strait area had little to do as few Japanese aircraft operated in the area.Odgers (1968), p. 116 No. 86 Squadron next saw combat against Japanese aircraft on 22 and 23 January 1944 when it intercepted and destroyed two G4Ms and one Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter near Cape Valsch; after these engagements the Japanese ceased sending aircraft into the Merauke area. No. 86 Squadron also undertook other tasks in addition to its air defence duties. The squadron regularly conducted patrols of the Merauke area, escorted supply ships and exercised with Australian Army units. It also undertook several ground attack missions, including an operation on 31 January 1944 in which four Japanese barges were sunk in the mouth of the Lorentz River. The official history of the RAAF in this period notes that although the two squadrons on Merauke and Horn Island saw little action, they \\"fulfilled a very useful purpose\\" by protecting the flank of the Allied forces in New Guinea.Odgers (1968), p. 117 The squadron's tour of duty at Merauke ended on 25 April 1944, when it was replaced by No. 120 (NEI) Squadron.

In April 2008, Verso conducted an initial public offering and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In January 2015, Verso completed its acquisition of NewPage Holdings. Verso Corporation filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on January 26, 2016. Six months later, the company emerged from bankruptcy after restructuring and reducing its debt by $2.4 billion. As of January 2017, the company moved its headquarters from Memphis, Tennessee to Miamisburg, Ohio in a consolidation of offices as the company set a goal of reducing its overhead expenses by 10% annually. In January 2017, B. Christopher DiSantis was appointed as chief executive officer (CEO) and a director of Verso effective as of February 1, 2017. DiSantis resigned in April 2019 and Leslie Lederer was appointed as interim CEO. At the end of April 2019, Verso gave two months notice of the impending closure of its mill in Luke, Maryland.

On June 9, 2020 ,Verso announced a plan to idle its US paper mills in Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin and Duluth, Minnesota indefinitely by late July of 2020. The closure was due to the decline in demand for graphic paper and reduced use of print advertising in various industries during the coronavirus pandemic. According to the company, a small number of employees will be kept on afterwards for an unknown time until remaining stock is sold. Between the two paper mills, about 1,000 employees are expected to be laid off, with 900 of those at the Wisconsin Rapids Mill.

Family Henry Torr√®s was born in Les Andelys in 1891 to a Jewish family. His grandfather, Isaiah Levaillant, founded the League for the Defense of Human and Civil Rights during the Dreyfus Affair. He married Jeanne Levylier, with whom he had two children Jean and Georges, but they divorced. Career As a young man, Torr√®s became an active Communist and worked as a journalist for various socialist publications. During the First World War, he served as an infantry sergeant, was injured at Verdun and won several medals including the Croix de Guerre. After the war Torr√®s decided to study law and became a criminal lawyer. With Vincent de Moro-Giafferi and C√©sar Campinchi he was known as one of the \\"three Musketeers\\"‚Äîall brilliant young leaders of the Paris bar. In his early years Torr√®s had aspired to become a comedian, but his style was encumbered by a pronounced lisp. Nonetheless, in his later years he was famed for his booming voice and flamboyant personality. Torr√®s was involved in several criminal trials, before the Schwartzbard trial, not only in Paris but in Moscow and in Rumania. Upon returning to Paris he initiated a protest campaign denouncing the barbaric treatment of Jews in Bessarabia. After the Schwartzbard trial he was recognized as one of France's leading trial lawyers and remained active in political affairs. After the Nazi invasion of France, Torr√®s fled to South America, but was expelled first from Uruguay and then from Brazil because of his leftist associations. He moved on to Canada and then the United States. While in America, he campaigned against the Vichy regime and supported Charles de Gaulle. As a Jew, he had been banned from the French bar and because of his anti-government pamphlets and books he was condemned to death by the P√©tain regime. Writer In New York City, Torr√®s served as editor-in-chief of La Voix de France, a political journal for refugees and later as a professor of law at the Universities of Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo. After the war, he returned to his homeland and was reinstated into the French bar. From 1948 to 1958 he was a Gaullist senator for the Seine department. He served briefly as Vice President of the High Court of Justice and did work in the national radio and television system, serving as President of the state monopoly from 1948 to 1959.

Several Nintama Rantar≈ç video games were also published since 1995.  Plot  The series is set near the end of the Muromachi period. It is during the Sengoku period that the story takes place. By his father's recommendation, Rantar≈ç enters the Ninjutsu Gakuen in order to study and become an elite ninja. However, since joining and befriending Kirimaru and Shinbee, everything for him usually results in failure. Ninjutsu Gakuen is an educational institution established in the mountains of the Kansai region. Because it is a ninja school, the exact location is kept a secret (which is really because the author had not thought of one). Students attend in grades 1 through 6, which are divided up into three classes: I-gumi, Ro-gumi, and Ha-gumi, based on the old order of kana (the Iroha). Male and female students attend separate classes. Despite its detail in historical accuracies, there are also a considerable amount of deliberate anachronisms to provide humor, such as speech using katakana or the appearance of a vending machine, radio or a wristwatch.

Despite being born into a line of poor, second-class ninjas, he is determined and constantly strives to be top of his class, though the opposite always tends to be the case. Although he has an awful astigmatism and must wear glasses, he is an exceptionally swift runner, having been able to run 100 meters in 10 seconds. Being a member of the health committee, he is often called \\"Fuun Kozou\\" (lit. bad luck boy) since this committee in particular is deemed unlucky and any student in it, as a rule, is said to suffer constant mishaps. ; :Age 10, lives in Settsu province, Books Committee :One of Rantar≈ç's friends. A boy obsessed with money, he will try to gain any amount, no matter how small. This often results in his amassing as many part-time jobs as he possibly can, which are sometimes more than he can handle and has to have Doi-sensei help him, with less than favorable results. He's also very thrifty because of this. Dislikes words such as \\"give\\" and \\"pay\\". One of the reasons for this is that he is an orphan, having lost his parents after his village burned down, leaving him with no other living relatives. He managed to pay his entrance fees with money earned selling bento boxes. He lives with Doi-sensei during breaks. ; :Age 10, lives in Sakai, Tools Committee :Another one of Rantar≈ç's friends. He is a short, pudgy boy with a constantly runny nose who loves to eat. In fact, his weight seems to increase after every break. In the beginning, he started out as a crybaby, but gradually grew accustomed to the lifestyle. He is not good at schoolwork. The reason he was made to attend Ninjutsu Gakuen was to help with his success as an heir, being the son of a rich merchant. However, he does have advantageous qualities. In addition to being unusually strong, his sense of smell is greater than that of any dog. Under certain circumstances, his hair stands up straight and is stiff and sharp enough to be used as a lethal weapon.

History of World War I, Volume 1. Marshall Cavendish Corporation, 2002. Pp. 255 Aided both financially and militarily by the British, Husayn's forces gradually moved north through the Hijaz and, fought alongside the British-controlled Egyptian Expeditionary Force, eventually taking Damascus. Once there, members of the Sharifian Army set up a short-lived monarchy led by Faisal, a son of Sharif Husayn. Background For centuries in the Hijaz, the western region of Arabia where the Muslim holy cities of Mecca and Medina are located, power was strongly centralized in the hands of the family of the sharif. Members of this family, as descendants of Muhammad, were called Hashemites in English. Unlike many areas of the Ottoman Empire, there were few competing political influences among the urban elite. The tribal chieftains served as intermediaries between their tribes and the sharif but rarely challenged his authority. The sharif's lone political rival was the Ottoman vali (governor) of the region, who was responsible for ensuring Ottoman sovereignty over the region. A power struggle existed between the sharif and the vali; the authority to make decisions switched back and forth between the two over time. As a whole, the political climate left a large amount of influence in the hands of the sharif and in the early years of the twentieth century this was Sharif Husayn.Ochsenwald, William. Religion, Society, and the State in Arabia: The Hijaz Under Ottoman Control, 1840‚Äì1908. Columbus, Ohio: Ohio State University Press, 1984. Dissatisfied with his limited power, Sharif Husayn began discussions with tribal leaders in the region, Arab nationalists, and the British High Commissioner in Egypt, Sir Henry McMahon. Husayn knew that many Muslims believed that the Sharif of Mecca was the rightful claimant to the caliphate, which was currently held by the family of the rulers of the Ottoman Empire, the Ottomans. The British support that was pledged in the Husayn-McMahon Correspondence caused Husayn to emerge from these talks with a strengthened belief of his right to claim both the caliphate and sovereignty over Arab land. Furthermore, and more importantly, the promises made by the British to Husayn in the Husayn-McMahon Correspondence of 1915 and 1916 led Husayn to think that if he were to lead a successful revolt against the Ottomans, the British would help him establish an Arab Caliphate encompassing most of the Arabian Peninsula stretching as far north as present-day Turkey. Although the British could not promise a few districts that they had already pledged to give the French, the pieces seemed to be falling into place for Sharif Husayn, and he prepared to launch the Arab Revolt.Kedourie, Elie. In the Anglo-Arab Labyrinth: the McMahon-Husayn Correspondence and its Interpretations, 1914‚Äì1939. Cambridge, New York : Cambridge University Press, 1976. The revolt In early June 1916, the Ottoman government was putting pressure on Sharif Husayn to supply Hijazi troops and to issue a call for jihad from Mecca in support of the Ottoman participation in World War I. In exchange for the troops, Husayn wanted greater autonomy but the Ottoman authorities would not play his game. Ottoman officials were holding Husayn's son Faysal and told Husayn that if he ever wanted to see his son again, he must send the troops. On June 9, 1916 the Ottomans sent Faysal to Medina to get the armed forces that Husayn had been organizing there but when he arrived, he escaped with his brother ‚ÄòAli. At the beginning of the revolt, the Sharifian Army consisted of these forces that had been assembled by Husayn and his sons under the guise that they were to fight with the Ottoman forces. After escaping, Faysal wrote a letter stating that if Husayn's demands for greater autonomy were not met their relations with the Ottomans would end. Rather than wait for a reply, the Arab Revolt was started with an attack on the Hijaz Railway by forces that consisted of members of local Arab tribes and Ottoman defectors.Pasha, Djemal. Memories of a Turkish Statesman- 1913‚Äì1919. New York: Arno, 1973. The following day the first shots of the revolt were fired in Mecca and within two days, the Sharifian Army was in control of Mecca. By June 16, the Sharifian Army, with the assistance of the British Royal Navy, captured the important port of Jeddah. By the end of the summer, the Arab forces under the control of Sharif Husayn had managed to overtake coastal cities as far north as Yanbu and as far south as Qunfudhah. The Ottomans decisively won a battle for the first time when the Sharifian Army attacked Medina in October 1916. The Ottoman forces were entrenched in Medina with artillery that the poorly equipped Sharifian Army lacked. The Sharifian forces retreated and were forced to develop a new strategy in regard to Medina. Rather than attack the well- protected Ottoman army and suffer large casualties, the Arabs surrounded the city and cut it off from access to other Ottoman forces. For much of the war the Ottomans managed to keep the Hijaz Railway open to Medina and, through this, were able to continue to supply their men with weapons, ammunition, and other equipment until near the end of the war. The constant need for supplies in Medina played into the Sharifian strategy which was designed to have the Ottomans station troops along the railway and in Medina, wasting troops and supplies, while the Arabs continued up the coast of the Red Sea. As the British and Sharifian forces sought a way to overtake the Ottoman forces at Aqaba, the British decided to send Captain (later Colonel) T. E. Lawrence (commonly referred to as ‚ÄúLawrence of Arabia‚Äù) to help Faysal lead his forces.Parnell, Charles L., CDR USN \\"Lawrence of Arabia's Debt to Seapower\\" United States Naval Institute Proceedings. August 1979. Lawrence's plan was to make the Ottomans think that the Arabs were planning on attacking Damascus by creating a few diversions, including the destruction of a railroad bridge in Baalbek. Upon arrival in Aqaba on July 6, 1917, the Sharifian forces brutally massacred about three hundred Ottomans before their superiors could get them under control. Another 150 Ottoman troops were taken prisoner and after a few subsequent small scale attacks by Ottomans, the Arab and British forces solidified control in Aqaba.Lawrence, T. E. Seven Pillars of Wisdom. Doubleday, Doran, and Co. 1935. From this point onwards, the Sharifian Army fought at the side of the British armed forces that were coming from British- occupied Egypt. The well executed Battle of Megiddo included a small amount of Sharifian forces who marched into Damascus on October 1, 1918 with their revolt almost complete. The only city still under Ottoman control in the Hijaz was the city of Medina. Although they were cut off from the rest of the Ottoman world, forces inside of Medina continued to resist Sharifian forces until their lack of supplies forced them to surrender in January 1919. Forces The Sharifian Army consisted of about 5,000 regular forces and many thousands of irregular forces.Tauber, Eliezer. The Arab Movements in World War I. London: Cass, 1993. Many of the regular forces were former Arab members of the Ottoman military who defected and joined the Arab Revolt. Irregular forces refer to largely untrained Arabs who joined the revolt for a short period of time when the fighting was taking place near their home. As the fighting stretched further from Mecca, many soldiers from around Mecca decided that they had done their part and returned home. The constant flow of British gold and weaponry into the hands of the Sharifian Army was the main driving force behind the Revolt. Many tribes would fight for whoever offered them the most money. Some tribal leaders would agree to fight for the British and accept their payment and weapons and soon afterwards begin fighting for the Ottomans because they offered to pay the tribes more. This fickleness showed that many of the tribes were not interested in Arab unity, the ultimate goal of Sharif Husayn, but rather just wanted to be paid. While this made things more difficult for the Sharifian Army, Faysal's strong negotiating skills won many tribal chieftains over, giving the Hashemites the support they needed to challenge the Ottomans.Lawrence, T.E. ‚ÄúThe Howeitat and their Chiefs‚Äù. The Arab Bulletin. 24 July 1917. The army was divided into four groups led by Sharif Husayn's sons, ‚ÄòAli, ‚ÄòAbdullah, Faysal, and Zayd. Nuri al-Said and his brother-in-law Ja‚Äôfar al-Askari, who had previously been a Colonel in the Ottoman Army, joined the Sharifian Army because of their strong belief in Arab nationalism and rose to become leaders within the Sharifian Army. The first few months of the revolt were led by ‚ÄòAli and his forces which consisted of about 30,000 men, most of whom were irregular forces who only fought for a short period of time. By September 1916 these 30,000 were divided amongst all four of Husayn's sons who each now had at least 6,000 irregular forces under their control. The Sharifian Army consisted of about 4,000 regular forces by the beginning of 1917. The majority of these regular soldiers served under Husayn or ‚ÄòAli. As the revolt continued, Faysal emerged as the most successful of the four brothers and most of the forces fell under his control. The fact that Faysal worked alongside Lawrence of Arabia gave him access to more British intelligence, which is a large part of the reason he was the most successful. Aftermath Following the capture of Damascus at the end of the Arab Revolt, Faysal had set up a government in Syria and ruled there until the French won the Franco-Syrian War on July 24, 1920 and ousted him from the country. In 1920, the League of Nations decided that the lands of the Ottoman Empire would be divided by a newly created mandate system. The country that received the mandate was responsible for guiding the new state formed by the mandate to its independence. The British received the Palestinian and Mesopotamia (Iraq) mandates and the French received the Mandate of Syria and Lebanon. These mandates and their maps closely followed the divisions presented in the secret Sykes-Picot Agreement of 1916. The Balfour Declaration complicated things in the region because rather than including Palestine within the land promised to Sharif Husayn as part of the Arab kingdom because of the Husayn-McMahon Correspondence, the British had promised to create a Jewish state in the region. While the question of Palestine was never resolved, in Cairo, in 1921, the British decided to put Husayn's son Abdullah as the emir in the newly created Transjordan. The British left Husayn in control of the Hijaz and, since Faysal was deposed by the French from his Kingdom of Syria in 1920, helped Faysal come to power in Iraq, becoming Faisal I of Iraq. Sharif Husayn continued to rule the Hijaz and on March 23, 1924 declared himself Caliph. In that same year the Saudis ousted Husayn from the Hijaz and he lived the remainder of his life in exile, dying in Jordan in 1931.Paris, Timothy. Britain, the Hashemites and Arab Rule, 1920‚Äì1925 The Sharifian Solution. London: Frank Cass, 2003. Many other officers from the Sharifian Army, including Nuri al-Said, Jafar al-Askari, Jamil al-Midfai, Ali Jawdat al-Aiyubi, and Jamal Baban, played a prominent role in Faysal's Iraq. Nuri al-Said and Ja‚Äôfar al-Askari both served terms as Prime Minister. Officers from the Sharifian Army continued to play an important role in Iraqi politics until the 1963 coup led by Colonel Ahmad Hasan al-Bakr.

A Republican, he represented the 28th District from 2000 to 2009, which included portions of Indian River, Martin, Okeechobee, Palm Beach and St. Lucie Counties. He was previously a member of the Florida House of Representatives from 1990 through 2000. On November 21, 2006, Ken Pruitt was chosen by the unanimous vote of his colleagues to serve a two-year term as President of the Florida Senate. He succeeded Tom Lee and preceded Jeff Atwater in this capacity. From 2006 to 2008, Pruitt served as the 78th President of the Florida Senate. His other prominent leadership roles have included committee chairmanships of the Senate Rules Committee (2004‚Äì2006), Senate Appropriations Committee (2002‚Äì2004) and House Appropriations Committee (1998‚Äì2000). Florida Bright Futures After the 1996 general election, with Republicans the majority party in the Florida House of Representatives, Rep. Pruitt was able to shepherd through the Bright Futures Scholarship Act (CS/CS/SB 858 ‚Äì 1997) during the 1997 legislative session. The bill was responsible for creating the state's popular merit based aid programs for college students known as Florida Bright Futures Scholarships. These lottery funded scholarships have helped more than 300,000 Florida students attend a post-secondary institution and Pruitt has remained an ardent supporter of the program throughout his political career. In late 2003, Senator Ken Pruitt embarked on a statewide tour of all eleven state universities and all 28 community colleges in an effort to draw up support for higher education in Florida. The Brighter Futures Express Educational Tour traveled to the various state institutions of higher learning with the intention of reminding fellow lawmakers to \\"keep the promise\\" they had made to Floridians on programs like Florida Bright Futures and Florida Prepaid. Most notably from the tour was that Pruitt traveled from school to school in a used yellow school bus. The tour concluded on March 17, 2004 with a gathering on the steps of the historic state capitol. Over 3,000 students, teachers, and parents attended the political rally which was addressed by numerous speakers, including Senator Pruitt and Miss America 2004, Ericka Dunlap. The crowd was also treated to a performance by the Florida A&M; University Marching 100. =Bright Futures Debate= The Florida Legislature created the Florida Bright Futures Scholarship Program to reward students for their academic achievements during high school by providing funding to attend postsecondary education in Florida.\\"Florida Department of Education\\" The Bright Futures Scholarship was inspired by the Hope Scholarship. Originally the Program dispersed just above 42,000 scholarships for about $70 million. Over the last decade the cost for the scholarship has increased substantially as more students remain in Florida to receive higher education thereby, stopping the brain drain.Tampa Bay Online The Scholarship currently costs the Florida Lottery more than $436.1 million, with about 170,000 students taking advantage of the program this ensures the promise that lottery money will be used to supplement education.Naplesnews.com article about costsSun-Sentinel article about problems Expensive Program Lake Okeechobee During the 2000 Florida Legislative Session, Pruitt sponsored and passed the landmark Lake Okeechobee Protection Program (LOPP). The act (CS/CS/HB 991 ‚Äì 2000) called for the implementation of phosphorus load reductions, construction of stormwater treatment areas (STA), monitoring of water quality in the Lake Okeechobee watershed, and the development of \\"Best Management Practices\\" (BMP) for both agricultural and non-agricultural sources within the watershed. The enactment of LOPP has helped Florida protect and preserve the largest fresh water lake in the southern United States and contributed to the overall health of the Everglades. This important legislation (along with the 2005 Lake Okeechobee & Estuary Recovery Program (LOER)) has helped earmark tens of millions of dollars to the restoration of Lake Okeechobee, the St. Lucie River and the Indian River Lagoon. Bert Harris Act & the APA In 1992 as a Republican and member of the minority party in the Florida House, Pruitt teamed with veteran Representative and Democrat, Bert J. Harris Jr., in an effort to address the over-regulation and ownership rights of privately owned property. After two unsuccessful pushes to pass their Private Property Rights Protection Act, the two Representatives caught the break they needed in the third year. Prior to the 1995 Florida Legislative Session, Governor Lawton Chiles, having recently experienced a regulatory roadblock when he attempted to build a \\"cook shack\\" on his own private property, was ready to support the lawmakers' efforts. The Governor's momentum helped enabled the two representatives to pass the bill (CS/HB 863 - 1995) through both chambers with only a single dissenting vote. Representative Pruitt honored his partner and friend by renaming the bill the Bert J. Harris Jr. Private Property Rights Protection Act. Governor Chiles signed the act on May 18, 1995 and the Bert Harris Act has since served as a model to other states addressing environmental and land use regulation in respect to the rights of private property owners. Furthermore, the Governor's \\"cook shack\\" difficulties and crusade against superfluous rulemaking, government red-tape and over-regulation set the stage for an overhaul of Florida's Administrative Procedures Act, reforms the legislature had been attempting for several years. In addition to sponsoring the Bert Harris Act in 1995, Pruitt was the prime sponsor of the APA legislation. While the act was vetoed by Chiles in 1995 as being too burdensome for the implementing agencies, it was passed the following year, making the first major reforms to Florida's APA since its inception in 1974. Committee for a Sustainable Treasure Coast and the \\"Research Coast\\" On March 30, 2004, Governor Jeb Bush signed Executive Order No. 04-61 creating the Committee for a Sustainable Treasure Coast, Pruitt's proposed 37-member, three-county regional commission designed to increase cooperation and coordination between St. Lucie, Martin, and Indian River counties. The committee's main objective was to provide local governments with the tools to plan for and create incentives for responsible and sustainable growth on the Treasure Coast of Florida. A final report was adopted in late September 2005 and delivered to the Governor, Speaker of the House, and Senate President. The following legislative session in 2006, Senator Pruitt was a fervent supporter of legislation introduced and passed by Senator Mike Fasano creating Florida's Innovation Incentive Program (CS/CS/2728‚Äì2006). This economic development initiative provides resources for the recruitment or expansion of major research and development entities and innovation businesses in Florida. With the groundwork already laid by the CSTC, Pruitt and a motivated group of local leaders, both public and private, were able to attract the Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies to Port St. Lucie to set up an east coast operation. Two years later, in April 2008, the Innovative Incentive Fund also helped bring the Oregon Health and Science University Vaccine Gene Therapy Institute (VGTI) to the area. The development of this biotech cluster, in addition to the cluster including the Scripps Research Institute and the Max Planck Institute in Jupiter, Florida, has allowed the area to become known as Florida's \\"Research Coast,\\" a designation first given by Senator Ken Pruitt.

Life Little is recorded concerning the life of Mr. Bucke, but he is remembered for his eloquence with nature writing and a dispute with the actor Edmund Kean.Apple English Poetry . He worked for over thirty years on his publications, often recalling them repeatedly to re-edit them. This caused some of the same works to be published under different titles, most notably his two-volume series \\"The Philosophy of Nature, or the Influence of Scenery on the Heart and Mind\\", which he later expanded to four volumes under the title \\"On the Beauties, Harmonies, and Sublimities of Nature\\".Internet Archive Disputes with contemporaries In the midst of writing, Mr. Bucke also clashed on occasion with fellow writers, and, in one instance, an actor, Edmund Kean. In the dispute with Kean, Mr. Bucke relates that in 1817 he submitted his play \\"The Italians, or; The Fatal Accusation\\" to the Committee of Management at Drury Lane where it was accepted and put on the bill for future performance. Upon the death of Princess Charlotte of Wales the theatre closed for three weeks out of respect and Bucke conceded his priority in favour of a play that was thought to better appeal to the feelings of the general public regarding the princess's death. After various delays and assurances that the play was well- liked and would be performed, Kean made an offhand comment suggesting that one of the female supporting actors had a superior role than his and that his part should be rewritten to be more centre-stage, much to the surprise of Bucke. After speaking with the theatre management, the issue was pushed aside in favour of focusing on the current production of a play by Jane Porter, who Kean had a personal dislike for, that was to be shown in February 1819. The play was performed and, according to Bucke who was at opening night (and also according to popular media at the time), it was almost as if the entire production staff and actors were against the play's performance. Despite a concerted effort by some of the actors, Porter's play was a devastating failure and was not repeated. Upon witnessing this spectacle and bearing in mind the strange reaction he'd received previously from Kean, he went back stage to the management and requested his play to be pulled.The Works of Lord Byron, footnote pg. 202 After being called back by the theatre's committee and the insistence of the theatre's benefactors that 'The Italians' still be performed, Mr. Bucke then later had it republished with a preface concerning the incident, including excerpts from correspondences between himself, the theatre, and Mr. Kean which was later challenged in two books, The Assailant Assailed and A Defense of Edmund Kean, Esq.. The ending result was loss of face on both sides and the play being performed anyway on 3 April 1819 to disastrous results due to the sensationalism surrounding Kean's contempt for the play as well as his behaviour towards the production of Jane Porter's piece beforehand.\\"The Italians, or; The Fatal Accusation\\", preface pages v through xxvi Death Charles Bucke died on 31 July 1846 at the age of 65, presumedly of natural causes, leaving behind a widow, two sons (the eldest recorded as being 'imbecile from birth') and two daughtersGoogle Books- The Gentleman's Magazine, obituaries (May 1847, pg. 558) Bibliography *The philosophy of nature: or the influence of scenery on the mind and heart 2 vols, 1813; later 4 vols (under the title 'On the Beauties, Harmonies, and Sublimities of Nature', 1821) *Amusements in retirement; or the influence of science, literature, and the liberal arts 1816 *The fall of the leaf, and other poems 1819 *The Italians, or; The Fatal Accusation 1819 *A classical grammar of the English language; with a short history of its origin and formation 1829 *Julio Romano, or the force of the passions: an epic drama in six books 1830 *On the life, writings, and genius of Akenside; with some account of his friends 1832 *The book of human character 2 vols, 1837 *A letter intended (one day) as a supplement to Lockhart's Life of Sir Walter Scott 1838 *The life of John, Duke of Marlborough 1839 *Ruins of Ancient Cities: with general and particular accounts of their rise, fall, and present condition 2 vols, 1840 References External links Category:1781 births Category:1846 deaths Category:People from Worlington, Suffolk Category:English nature writers Category:English dramatists and playwrights Category:18th-century English people Category:19th-century English people Category:English male dramatists and playwrights Category:English male poets Category:English male non-fiction writers ","title":"Charles Bucke"},{"id":"13719513","title":"Lisa Carlton"},{"id":"13719524","text":"Whale barnacles are species of acorn barnacle that belong to the subfamily Coronulinae, family Coronulidae. They typically attach to baleen whales, though they may settle on toothed whales and, rarely, turtles, which have their own species of barnacle, which split from whale barnacles in the Late Pliocene around 3.5 to 3 million years ago (mya). Whale barnacles passively filter food, using tentacle-like cirri, as the host swims through the water. The arrangement is generally considered commensal as it is done at no cost or benefit to the host. However, some whales may make use of the barnacles as protective armor or for inflicting more damage while fighting, which would make the relationship mutualistic where both parties benefit; alternatively, some species may just increase the drag that the host experiences while swimming, making the barnacles parasites. After hatching, whale barnacles go through six molting stages before searching for a host, being prompted to settle by a chemical cue from the host skin. The barnacle creates a crown- shaped shell, and in most instances, deeply embeds itself into the skin for stability while riding a fast-moving host. The shell plates are made of calcium carbonate and chitin. Whale barnacles may live for up to a year, and often slough off along migration routes or at whale calving grounds. Because of this, fossil whale barnacles can be used to study ancient whale distribution. Taxonomy =Evolution= The turtle barnacle Chelonibia testudinaria on a loggerhead sea turtle Whale barnacles may have originated from the turtle barnacles (Chelonibiidae)‚Äîwhich attach to turtles, sirenians, and crabs‚Äîas a group that changed its specialization to baleen whales. Turtle barnacles are known from before the Early Tertiary which ended 23 million years ago (mya), and whale barnacles probably diverged in the Late Pliocene 3.5 to 3 mya. Chelonibia testudinaria turtle barnacle remains from the Pliocene of Italy seemed to have been associated with right whales (Balaena spp.), and could represent a transitional phase; the lack of competing barnacle species and the softer skin compared to the turtle carapace may have led to a divergence and a dispersal. Since whale barnacles are monophyletic (the family contains a common ancestor and all its descendants), this dispersal only successfully occurred once. Since whale barnacles may become detached from their hosts along migration routes and at breeding grounds, their remains on the seabed are used as indicators of ancient whale distribution and migratory habits, similar to the function of trace fossils. =Classification= Whale barnacles are a family of acorn barnacles. The family Coronulidae was first erected in 1817 by English marine biologist William Elford Leach, and was placed into the order Campylosomata with Balanidae alongside the order Acamptosomata with Cineridea and Pollicipedides, under the superfamily Coronuloidea. In 1825, English zoologist John Edward Gray divided Coronulidae into four subfamilies: Tubicinella, Polylepas, Platylepas, and Astrolepas. In 1854, Charles Darwin reclassified barnacles, and moved all sessile barnacles into the family Balanidae, separating this into the subfamilies Chthamalinae and Balaninae. He was unsure whether to classify whale barnacles into the latter subfamily or follow Leach and Gray and create the subfamily Coronulinae to include sessile barnacles that attach to large vertebrates. In 1916, biologist Henry Augustus Pilsbry differentiated turtle barnacles from whale barnacles and assigned them to Chelonibiinae and Coronulinae, respectively; he also recognized two forms of Coronulinae, coronulid and platylepadi, based on anatomical differences and host preferences. In 1976, the family Coronulidae was redefined to include Coronulinae, Platylepadinae, Chelonibiinae, and Emersoniinae; Coronuloidea was rearranged to include Coronulidae, Tatraclitidae, and Bathylasmatida. In 1981, Coronulidae was reorganized to include the subfamilies Coronulinae, Chelonibiinae, and Xenobalaninae. In 2007, these were redefined as Coronuloidea comprising three families: Coronulidae, Chelonibiidae, and Platylepadidae. According to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS), there are 14 accepted species of whale barnacles, 6 of which still exist today. ‚Ä† denotes extinct: *‚Ä†Cetolepas Zullo, 1969 **‚Ä†C. hertleini Zullo, 1969 *Cetopirus Ranzani, 1817 **C. complanatus M√∂rch, 1852 *Tubicinella Lamarck, 1802 **T. major Lamarck, 1802 *Xenobalanus Steenstrup, 1852 **X. globicipitis Steenstrup, 1852 *Cryptolepas Dall, 1872 **‚Ä†C. murata Zullo, 1961 **C. rhachianecti Dall, 1872 *Coronula Lamarck, 1802 **‚Ä†C. aotea Fleming, 1959 **‚Ä†C. barbara Darwin, 1854 **‚Ä†C. bifida Bronn, 1831 **C. diadema Linnaeus, 1767 **‚Ä†C. dormitor Pilsbry and Olson, 1951 **‚Ä†C. ficarazzensis Gregorio, 1895 **‚Ä†C. macsotayi Weisbord, 1971 **C. reginae Darwin, 1854 The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) both have different classifications for Coronulidae, though neither are authoritative like WoRMS. NCBI defines Coronulidae as containing Coronula, Cryptolepas, Xenobalanus, and the turtle barnacles Chelonibia; and ITIS Coronula, Cryptolepas, Cetopirus, Xenobalanus, and Polylepas. Description C. diadema on the throat of a humpback whale calf =Adulthood= All acorn barnacles create a crown-shaped shell with six to eight plates and a hole at the peak. C. diadema is typically barrel-shaped, has most of the shell emergent from the skin, and has been measured in the North Pacific to reach in height. Coronula reginae, which is typically high; Cetopirus, which has been recorded in two individuals as high and in diameter, respectively; and Cryptolepas are flattened and deeply embedded in the skin. Tubicinella is tall and tube-shaped with ridges that may serve to prevent the skin from rejecting the barnacle, and typically exceeds in height. Xenobalanus has a star-shaped shell deeply embedded into the skin, and develops a long stalk, much like goose barnacles, which hangs off the host; Xenobalanus may be around in size. Shed barnacle scars on a humpback whale The fleshy appendage exiting the hole‚Äîthe \\"apertural shroud\\"‚Äîis more prominently displayed than in other barnacles. The cirri, feeding tentacles which extend out of the aperture, are short and thick, probably enabling them to remain more stable while riding a fast-moving host. Whale barnacles have reduced opercular plates which only partially close the hole at the top, probably because these barnacles lack predators and thus any need to defend themselves. The plates, like in turtle barnacles, are made of calcium carbonate and chitin. Inside the plates, the soft barnacle itself is encased in a cuticle which is periodically molted. When they are shed from the host, whale barnacles can leave round marks, but Xenobalanus leaves a unique star-shaped scar. C. diadema, based on infestation sizes and the number of juveniles that are present as the year progresses, may have a lifespan of about a year. C. diadema has been observed to slough off in areas with high whale traffic, such as migration routes and breeding areas. =Development= Unlike coastal acorn barnacles which have been widely studied, the development of a whale barnacle was first researched in 2006 with Coronula diadema collected from the fin of a beached humpback whale. Immediately after hatching, the newly born nauplius larvae molted and, after six molts, reached the cyprid stage, the last stage before maturity. Unlike other barnacles, the stage II and III nauplius had a pair of horns projecting from the head, and the eyes in stage IV were crescent shaped. The cyprid had circular eyes and, like other barnacles, had several oil cells in the head which probably acted as food reserves as cyprids do not feed. The cyprids seemed to be induced to settle onto a substrate by a cue released from whale skin, though they do not have to settle on the skin. Though the mechanism is not fully understood, coastal barnacles receive settling cues from a certain protein, so it may be that whale barnacles use the alpha-2-macroglobulin, a plasma protein of the blood common in vertebrates. After settling, the juvenile barnacles formed a ring-shaped structure that firmly gripped onto the skin, growing upwards as a cylinder. Wall plates did not form at first, though the juveniles did develop stripes. This cylindrical shape is similar to the adult T. major, which attaches to right whales. Ecology Xenobalanus shells embedded into the flukes of a striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba) =Cirri= Cirri are used by barnacles to capture food particles in the current. The barnacles extend their cirri into a fan- shape, catch particles, and then retract the cirri back into the shell to transfer the particles into the mouth. First, a membrane‚Äîthe opercular membrane shielding the barnacle from the water‚Äîis opened and the cirri emerge from the shell and are spread. At full extension, three of the six cirri do not protrude past the membrane. The cirri then do a forward stroke, and the long cirri and membrane begin retraction. They do a backward stroke and the cirri roll back up into the shell. In Cryptolepas, this process was observed as taking 1.2 to 1.9 seconds, however the forward and backward strokes can be skipped entirely, and the cirri can simply be extended and quickly coil back up. Adolescent barnacles have shorter cycles than adults. In fast currents, the cirri do not retract. Land-based barnacles have to reorient their cirri depending on the direction of the current; but since the current only flows in one direction for whale barnacles‚Äîfrom the head to the tail of the host‚Äîadults have lost that ability. However, the cirri do have a special function during copulation. At this time, the barnacle acting as a male (barnacles are hermaphrodites) fully extends its cirri, and the penis begins a searching movement around its circumference. Having encountered another barnacle, the pair begin a series of intense cirral movements which was observed in Cryptolepas as lasting around 32 seconds. =Symbiosis= Gray whale rostrum covered in the endemic Cryptolepas rhachianecti barnacles and cyamids often called whale lice Whale barnacles typically attach to baleen whales and have a commensal relationship‚Äìthe barnacle benefits and the whale is neither helped nor harmed. A single humpback whale may carry up to of barnacles. On right whales (Eubalaena spp) an endemic species of barnacle, Tubicinella is embedded in patches of roughened, calcified skin called callosities. The distribution of callosities and the light colored cyamids that occupy the callosities forms a unique pattern for individual whales, and is used to identify markers by researchers. Since barnacles require that water flow independently over them to filter food, colonies may follow the direction of water currents produced by the animal in areas with moderate flow. However, Xenobalanus exclusively inhabits the most turbulent environments for barnacles on flippers, flukes, and dorsal fins. Barnacle larvae may reach these sites passively, being deposited naturally by vortexes created by the animal, or may crawl to more suitable locations. Xenobalanus stimulates the growth of calcified skin around itself which prevents the skin from shedding and dislodging the barnacle. On baleen whales, barnacles are often found in conjuncture with whale lice. The goose barnacle Conchoderma auritum often attaches to the shell of C. diadema. Though whale barnacles are generally considered to be commensals, callosities could be an adaptation to prevent barnacles from adding to drag by concentrating infestations, and a heavy infestation may lead to eczema. Xenobalanus can more easily grow on sick skin with a weakened immune system, and younger individuals tend to have larger infestations presumably because they are less resistant; further, given it has a stalk, it increases the drag felt by the host and may be considered parasitic in that sense. A Cryptolepas infection on captive beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) elicited an immune response by the skin, and the barnacles were ejected after a few weeks. Gray whales have been observed rubbing against the gravelly seafloor to dislodge barnacles. Coronula on a gray whale Conversely, some whales may use barnacles as weapons or protective armor to add power to a strike in mating battles or against killer whales (Orcinus orca), or as a deterrent to being bitten by killer whales. This would make the relationship between whale barnacles and certain whales mutualistic in which both parties benefit. It may be that some baleen whales, in the context of the fight-or-flight response, are adapted for a fight response, namely the humpback and gray (Eschricthius robustus) whales. As such they may have evolved to attract barnacles, sacrificing speed for damage and defense. Others, the Balaenoptera, are adapted for a flight response, probably evolving an antifouling mechanism in their skin to deter infestations, avoiding unnecessary weight which would hinder speed. However, the bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus), the North Atlantic (Eubalaena glacialis), and North Pacific (E. japonica) right whales, which favor fight responses, are generally barnacle-free. It may be that a reduction in population caused by historic whaling restricted their distribution and contact with other whales, thus impeding the barnacles' ability to infect other whales. =Hosts= Dolphins swimming with Xenobalanus on their tail fins C. diadema are common to abundant on the humpback whale (Megaptera novaengliae), and uncommon to rare on other species of whale. Cryptolepas is abundant on the gray whale, but has been recorded on the killer whale, the beluga whale, and in the stomach of the topsmelt silverside (Atherinops affinis). Topsmelt are known to pick off the dead skin and whale lice often found in association with barnacles. Tubicinella major has been recorded only the southern right whale. Cetopirus complanatus inhabits exclusively the southern right whale Eubalaena australis. Xenobalanus has been recorded on: the pilot whales (Globicephala spp.), common bottlenose dolphin (Tusiops truncatus), Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (T. aduncus), pantropical spotted dolphin (Stenella attenuata), striped dolphin, spinner dolphin (S. longirostris), Cuvier's beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris), franciscana (Pontoporia blainvillei), killer whale, false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens), tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis), rough-toothed dolphin (Steno bredanensis), Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus), pygmy killer whale (Feresa attenuata), common dolphins (Delphinus spp.), dusky dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obscurus), melon-headed whale (Peponocephala electra), sperm whale, finless porpoise (Neophocaena phocaenoides), harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), vaquita (P. sinus), Burmeister's porpoise (P. spinippinis), True's beaked whale (Mesoplodon mirus), common minke whale, sei whale, Eden's whale (B. edeni), blue whale, fin whale, and humpback whale.

Biography Meldrum was born in Detroit, Michigan, to a family of musicians and actors (grandfather Thomas Hubbard and Great Uncle Elbert Hubbard). The family moved to Los Angeles, California when she was 13. She started playing guitar at age 14. Ulrich Roth and Michael Schenker were her main influences after listening to albums such as the Scorpions' 1976 album Virgin Killer. Her first move was forming thrash metal band Wargod with later Dark Angel, Death and Strapping Young Lad drummer Gene Hoglan, then moving on to become both co-founder and lead guitarist in Phantom Blue, an all-female heavy metal band. Phantom Blue released their self-titled debut album on Shrapnel Records in the US (Roadrunner Records in Europe and Japan, and on to a major label deal with Geffen Records). The band toured internationally with much success. Meldrum married Europe guitarist John Norum in 1995Michelle Meldrum tribute ‚Äì Lastingtribute.co.uk and they moved to Sweden, where she went on to form Meldrum, a multi-national hard rock band. In 2005, Meldrum toured for three months with Zakk Wylde's Black Label Society, appearing in sold out venues across the US and Europe. In the fall of 2005, Meldrum joined Mot√∂rhead as special guests on their 30th anniversary tour throughout Europe. Meldrum has also toured with Sepultura, Danzig and Nashville Pussy, among others. In addition, she performed with her former Phantom Blue bandmate Linda McDonald and The Iron Maidens on a handful of gigs in late 2006. Death Michelle fell into a coma on May 18, 2008 and died three days later on May 21 due to complications of a cystic growth on her brain that had restricted the oxygen and blood flow, rendering her brain-dead. She was 39 years old. She is survived by her parents, her husband John Norum and their son, Jake Thomas. Meldrum had just completed writing and recording a new album at the time, which the surviving band members released in 2009 in tribute to her.

Life and career  Latimore was born in Darien, Connecticut. He came from a well-to-do family, and was able to trace his lineage back to the American Revolutionary War. He ran away from home at an early age, and shortly thereafter got the lead part in a Broadway play. He began his acting career in the 1930s, when he and longtime friend Lloyd Bridges performed in summer stock theater at a playhouse in Weston, Vermont. Latimore then went to Hollywood where he signed a contract with 20th Century- Fox, and proceeded to appear in such hits as In the Meantime, Darling, The Dolly Sisters, Three Little Girls in Blue, and Shock. After his years at Fox, he made films in Europe, most of which were swashbucklers such as Balboa, Conquistador of the Pacific, The Golden Falcon, Devil's Cavaliers and many others, including two Zorro films and some westerns. These were starring roles, much bigger than his Hollywood roles, to the effect that he became the darling of the swashbucklers during the late 50s and early 60s. He appeared in the French film Purple Noon, as well as in the Italian melodrama A Woman Has Killed (1952). Latimore appeared in two soap operas, playing Dr. Ed Coleridge on Ryan's Hope from 1975 to 1976, and Dr. Emmet Scott on Guiding Light from 1976 to 1979. He did some work for PBS, most notably appearing in a film about the Civil War. He married Rukmini Sukarno, an opera singer who was a daughter of President Sukarno of Indonesia. Their son, Chris Kline, is a journalist. On November 29, 1998, he died in his sleep, at the age of 73. His remains were cremated and buried beneath a venerable old apple tree on ancestral property in Vermont.  Selected filmography  * In the Meantime, Darling (1944) ‚Äì Lt.

The Guardians of Independence used both nationalist and religious rhetoric against the British presence and contributed greatly to the rise of emotions that led to the 1920 revolt. It called for Iraqi and Syrian independence, the establishment of a constitutional monarchy, and the rejection of technical or economic assistance from the British.

In the Ojibwe language, his name meant \\"Man of Dawn.\\" Biography =Early years= One of 12 children in his family, Bellecourt was born on the White Earth Indian Reservation, where he lived until he was 16 years old. In 1947 his family moved to the city of Minneapolis, where his parents sought better opportunities for themselves and their children. When Bellecourt was 19, he was convicted of robbing a Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul tavern and sentenced to time in St. Cloud prison. At his release, he started working as a hairdresser and opened a series of beauty salons in Saint Paul. He married and had children with his wife. In the mid 1960s, he sold his business and moved his family near Aspen, Colorado. =American Indian Movement= Bellecourt was a long- time leader in the American Indian Movement, which his younger brother, Clyde Bellecourt, helped found in 1968. Vernon soon became involved as well. He co- founded the AIM chapter in Denver, and was its first Executive Director. It worked in urban areas to ensure civil rights for American Indians, as well as to educate people about their cultural and spiritual heritage.\\"In Remembrance: Vernon Bellecourt\\", Native American Church Bellecourt took part in the 1972 Trail of Broken Treaties caravan to Washington, DC. He served as a negotiator during AIM's occupation of the Bureau of Indian Affairs headquarters building at the Department of Interior. Bellecourt was present briefly during the 1973 Wounded Knee occupation at Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. He acted as an AIM spokesman and fundraiser during the 71-day standoff with federal agents. After Wounded Knee, Bellecourt worked with the International Indian Treaty Council, which advocates on behalf of Indigenous rights throughout the Western Hemisphere. He became a leader of AIM's work abroad, meeting with foreign leaders such as Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, Muammar al- Gaddafi of Libya, and Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat. Bellecourt was active for many years in the campaign to free AIM activist Leonard Peltier, who was convicted in 1977 of killing two FBI agents during a 1975 shootout on the Pine Ridge Reservation. Peltier was sentenced to two consecutive life sentences. =Sports mascots and nicknames= As president of the National Coalition on Racism in Sports and Media, Bellecourt worked to end the unauthorized use of American Indian tribal land nicknames in American sports. Bellecourt fought against nicknames such as the Washington Redskins, Atlanta Braves or Kansas City Chiefs. He was arrested twice in Cleveland in protest of the Cleveland Indians' mascot, Chief Wahoo. During the 1997 World Series Bellecourt was arrested for setting fire to a stuffed doll of Chief Wahoo while protesting outside of Jacobs Field. Charges against him were dropped. Bellecourt was arrested in 1998 but was not charged. =Final days= In August 2007, Bellecourt accepted an invitation from the Venezuelan government to attend the First International Congress of Anti-imperialist Indigenous Peoples of America. He met with President Hugo Chavez in Venezuela. The two discussed the possibility of Chavez' providing aid to Native American groups. According to his brother Clyde, Bellecourt fell ill soon after the trip and was hospitalized. He died of pneumonia at age 75, in Minneapolis where he lived.

Historical Dictionary of Iraq, pp. 59-60. Scarecrow Press, 2004, Most of these officers would serve in Sharif Husayn's army during the Arab Revolt and later in Faisal's Syrian army. It called for the independence of Iraq, with Amir Abdullah, son of Sharif Husayn, as king and Prince Zayd as his deputy; and the eventual union of Iraq with Syria. Later on, it sought economic and technical support from Britain as long as this aid did not hamper or undermine true freedom. The group held its first meetings in Damascus and then established a number of branches in other Arab areas, including Iraq, notably in Baghdad and Mosul. It published a magazine, al-Lisan. Its Iraqi members included Yasin al-Hashimi, Nuri as-Said, Jafar al- Askari, and Jamil al-Midfai. 'Aziz 'Ali al-Misri was one of its Egyptian members. It also gained the support of Talib al-Naqib, who provided financial as well as moral support for its activities. Muhammed Sharif al-Faruqi, an officer whose talks with the British partially led to the British support of the Arab Revolt, claimed to be a member of Al-'Ahd, however studies later showed that this was not true.A Peace To End All Peace, David Fromkin, Avon Books, New York, 1990 Following the ouster of Faisal's Arab government from Syria in 1920, the group transferred its headquarters to Aleppo and Deir ez- Zor to continue to seek the establishment of an Arab government for Iraq. However, Faisal's collapse had greatly weakened the group, and its activities ceased soon after.
