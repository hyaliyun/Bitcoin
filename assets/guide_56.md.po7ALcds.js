It is one of the city's most popular restaurants, serving about 4,000 customers per day in 2000, and is open daily from 5 am to 1 am. The restaurant has five dining rooms covering a total of and is decorated with over 100 Western- themed artworks including several portraits of John Wayne, referencing the nickname that both he and the city of Albuquerque share, ‚ÄúThe Duke‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Duke City‚Äù. History Frontier Restaurant was established in 1971 by Dorothy and Larry Rainosek, who had recently moved to Albuquerque from Austin, Texas. Hoping to attract college students, they leased a barn-shaped building on Central Avenue across from the University of New Mexico which had previously housed a short-lived restaurant called the Country Barn. Earlier, the corner had also been the site of a popular soda fountain called Chisholm's. The Frontier opened on February 10 with just 15 menu items and five employees. Initially, the restaurant served breakfast, hamburgers, sandwiches, and some Tex-Mex foods like enchiladas. After requests from customers, they began to incorporate New Mexican cuisine into the menu by the end of 1971. By 1989, the Frontier had expanded into the adjoining buildings on the block for a total of five dining rooms and of space. The restaurant was open 24 hours a day beginning in the early 1990s, but was forced to cut back its hours in 2006 after repeated problems with unruly patrons. Menu The Frontier serves primarily New Mexican cuisine along with American diner fare like sandwiches, hamburgers, and breakfast plates. Some of the best-known menu items include the sweet rolls, green chile cheeseburgers, green chile stew, carne adovada, and breakfast burritos. The restaurant also sells some bulk items including tortillas, chile, carne adovada, posole, green chile stew, and sweet rolls.

Domestic support for the war by the population of France had declined. The United States was concerned and worried that a French military defeat in Vietnam would result in the spread of communism to all the countries of Southeast Asia‚Äîthe domino theory‚Äîand was looking for means of aiding the French without committing American troops to the war. A map of North and South Vietnam after the Geneva Accords of 1954. Ho Chi Minh, President of North Vietnam. In a last ditch effort to defeat the Viet Minh, the French had fortified a remote outpost in northwestern Vietnam named ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Ph·ªß with the objective of inducing the Viet Minh to attack and then utilizing superior French firepower to destroy the attackers. Viet Minh General V√µ Nguy√™n Gi√°p described the French positions in a river valley as being at the bottom of a rice bowl with the Viet Minh holding the high ground surrounding the French. In May, French military forces surrendered to the Viet Minh concluding the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. In July, a cease fire agreement was reached by the Geneva Accords dividing Vietnam into two provisional states at the 17th parallel of latitude. Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám became Prime Minister of South Vietnam and Ho Chi Minh became President of North Vietnam. Di·ªám overcame an early challenge to his rule from army leaders and the H√≤a H·∫£o and Cao ƒê√†i religious sects. The United States pledged its support to the Di·ªám government and began to replace France as the principal foreign power involved in South Vietnam. China and the Former Soviet Union began to provide economic assistance to North Vietnam.  January  ;12 January Emperor and Chief of State B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i appointed B·ª≠u L·ªôc as Prime Minister of Vietnam. ;29 January United States President Dwight D. Eisenhower announced that 26 B-26 bombers and 200 U.S. Air Force mechanics would be provided the French to aid them in their war against the Viet Minh.  February  ;18 February The United States, United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union agreed to discuss a solution to the war in Indochina at a Geneva Conference scheduled to begin on 26 April.  March  The flag of the Viet Minh. ;13 March The Battle of Dien Bien Phu began. The French garrison was surrounded by the Viet Minh commanded by V√µ Nguy√™n Gi√°p. During the nearly two-month course of the siege a total of about 20,000 soldiers in the French army defended themselves against 49,500 Viet Minh fighters. ;15 March The National Security Council of the United States approved the assignment of CIA operative Col. Edward Lansdale to Saigon. Lansdale was given much credit for advising Philippine President Ramon Magsaysay and helping defeat the Hukbalahap Rebellion. ;25 March President Eisenhower met with the National Security Council to consider U.S. intervention to assist the French at Dien Binh Phu. Eisenhower imposed four conditions for U.S. intervention: France would have to request U.S. intervention; the United Nations would have to approve; intervention would have to be a multi-national effort; and Congress would have to approve. A U.S. army study concluded that the use of nuclear weapons by the U.S to relieve the siege of ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Ph·ªß was feasible and suggested an operational plan. The study met with opposition from senior military officers and was quickly abandoned.  April  ;3 April President Eisenhower met with eight Congressional leaders, including Lyndon Johnson, to discuss Operation Vulture, a proposal to aid the French trapped in Dien Bien Phu with carrier-based air strikes. The members of Congress said they would support air strikes only if it were part of a multinational effort. ;5 April The National Security Council met again to consider U.S. intervention at ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Ph·ªß. The Army, including Army Chief of Staff General Matthew Ridgway, was negative, stating that U.S. intervention would require 7 army divisions and heavy air support. ;7 April President Eisenhower used the phrase \\"falling dominoes\\" in a press conference. This was the origin of the domino theory which postulated that if Vietnam became communist the other nearby states would soon follow. The domino theory was a prominent justification for the Vietnam War in the United States during the 1960s. ;14 April Secretary of State John Foster Dulles returned to the United States after having failed to persuade France and the United Kingdom to support a multinational effort to assist the French in ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Ph·ªß. The French wanted American air strikes, but opposed a multinational coalition; the British preferred to rely on the upcoming Geneva Convention to resolve the problem of the war in Vietnam. ;17 April Vice President of the U.S. Richard M. Nixon said at a press conference: \\"the United States as a leader of the free world cannot afford further retreat from Asia...If the French withdrew [from Vietnam], the United States might have to take the risk now by putting our own boys in.\\" 22 April French Foreign Minister Georges Bidault told Dulles that only massive U.S. air strikes could save ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Ph·ªß and withdrew French objections to a multinational effort. Winston Churchill in Great Britain, however, said he 'was not prepared to give any undertakings about United Kingdom military action in Indochina in advance of the results of Geneva.\\" ;26 April The Geneva Conference (1954) on Korea and Vietnam began.

In 1954: orange areas controlled by Viet Minh; purple areas controlled by France; dotted areas contested. ;1 June Colonel Edward Lansdale arrived in Saigon from the Philippines to create and lead the CIA's Saigon Military Mission (SMM). Lansdale, a former advertising executive, was tasked with helping pro-Western elements in Vietnam wage psychological and political warfare against the communist-dominated Viet Minh.

Nhu asked what policies would persuade the U.S. to support his brother as Prime Minister. Harwood's terms were that the U.S. must participate directly in the training of the South Vietnamese army and the government of Vietnam must show uncompromising resistance to Viet Minh efforts to expand the territory under its control. Harwood's commitment to Di·ªám was unauthorized by the U.S. Government, but was tacitly accepted. ;4 June A CIA secretary in Saigon, Virginia Spence, established a close relationship with Ng√¥ Dinh Nhu. She said of him and his followers. \\"The men who have schemed and fought...to get political power don't have any idea what to do with it now that it's within their grasp. They are like the bride who couldn't see beyond the end of the church aisle...They need support, all right, but they don't realize how much. ;14 June B·ª≠u L·ªôc resigns as Prime Minister of Vietnam, paving the way for the appointment of Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám. It is uncertain whether the U.S. encouraged, or merely acquiesced, in the appointment of Di·ªám. Both France and the United States appear to have decided he was the only viable candidate for the job.

The French suffered more than fifty percent casualties before finally extricating the survivors on July 17.\\"The Valley of Crosses\\" , accessed 29 Jul 2014 Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám, Prime Minister of South Vietnam. ;26 June Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám arrived in Saigon after four years of exile in France and the United States to assume the post of Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam. Di·ªám was appointed to the post by Emperor and chief of state B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i, who lived in France most of the time. Di·ªám was a Catholic appointed to rule a country that was predominantly Buddhist. In the words of one historian, \\"Di·ªám's attractiveness to his first American patrons derived from three qualities: he was a certified anti-communist nationalist, he was a Roman Catholic, and he understood English.\\" English language ability was rare among Vietnamese at the time.  July  The Geneva Conference in 1954 which divided Vietnam into two provisional states: North Vietnam and South Vietnam. ;21 July The Geneva Accords were signed in Paris. The accords called for a cease fire in the war, the independence of Vietnam, its division at the 17th parallel of latitude into two provisional states, North Vietnam and the State of Vietnam (South Vietnam), and the establishment of a demilitarized zone 10 kilometers (6 miles) wide separating the two provisional states. Viet Minh soldiers were to withdraw to the north and military forces allied to France to the south. Free movement between north and south was granted for 300 days. The Final Declaration stated that the demarcation line at the 17th parallel between North and South Vietnam was only \\"provisional and should not in any way be interpreted as constituting a political or territorial boundary.\\" Elections by secret ballot were to be held in July 1956 to unite the north and the south into a single country. (In his autobiography published in 1963, Eisenhower noted that \\"had elections been held as of the time of the fighting [1954], possibly 80 per cent of the population would have voted for the Communist Ho Chi Minh ... rather than chief of State Bao Dai.\\" This clearly indicated major difficulties for any candidate other than Ho Chi MInh in those 1956 elections.) Neither the United States nor the Viet Minh were pleased with the Geneva Accords, the U.S. because Vietnam north of the 17th parallel was given to the communist Viet Minh, the Viet Minh because, despite their military victory, they gained control over only one-half the country. Under pressure from the Soviet Union and China, the Viet Minh (hereafter called North Vietnam) signed the agreement.McNamara, Robert S. Argument without End: In Search of Answers to the Vietnam Tragedy New York: Public Affairs, 1999, pp. 87-89 Neither the United States nor South Vietnam signed the Accords. The U.S. only \\"took note\\" of the Accords and promised not to \\"disturb them\\" by the threat or use of force. ;24 July Commenting on the Geneva Accords and U.S. objectives in Vietnam, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles said \\"The important thing...is to seize the future opportunity to prevent the loss of northern Vietnam from leading to the extension of Communism throughout Southeast Asia and the Southwest Pacific.\\"  August  Lansdale and a dozen operatives in the Saigon Military Mission began sabotage efforts which included distributing leaflets warning of the fate of the Vietnamese under the Viet Minh, encouraging immigration from the north to the south, discouraging immigration from the south to the north, contaminating the oil supply to ruin the motors of Hanoi buses, training potential guerrillas, hiring astrologers to make dire predictions of disaster in the north and peace in the south, and smuggling arms and other equipment to paramilitary anti-communist groups in the north. ;12 August President Eisenhower and the National Security Council decided that the U.S. would provide assistance for military training in South Vietnam \\"working through the French only insofar as necessary.\\" The U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff were reluctant to undertake the training mission as they believed conditions in South Vietnam were too unsettled to make training the South Vietnamese army feasible. The decision to train the South Vietnam army, in the opinion of one historian, \\"set in motion a chain of events that would prove irreversible.\\" ;16 August An Air Vietnam Bristol Freighter evacuating civilians from Hanoi to Saigon crashed while making an emergency landing at Pakse, Laos killing 47 onboard.

The Geneva Accords allowed for free movement between the northern and southern zones of Vietnam for a period of 300 days. The Menard was the first of many U.S. and French navy ships to transport refugees from north to south.Lindholm, Richard Vietnam: The First Five Years. An International Symposium Michigan State University Press, 1959, p. 63 The navy program to transport refugees from the north to the south was called Operation Passage to Freedom. From August 1954 until July 1955, between 600,000 and one million northerners moved south, while between 14,000‚Äì45,000 civilians and approximately 100,000 Viet Minh fighters moved in the opposite direction. About 75 percent of the migrants to the south were Catholics.Ruane, Kevin (1998) War and Revolution in Vietnam London: Routledge, pp. 323-325; Tran Thi Lien (Nov 2005) \\"The Catholic Question in Vietnam\\" Cold War History London: Routledge, Vol. 5, No. 4, 427-449; Hansen, Peter (2009) \\"Catholic Refugees from the North of Vietnam, and their Role in the Southern Republic, 1954‚Äì1959\\" Journal of Vietnamese Studies Vol. 4, No. 3, p. 280 North Vietnam left behind in South Vietnam 8,000 to 10,000 covert civilian and military personnel, most of them members of the communist party. The task of the \\"stay-behinds\\" was political activism to ensure a victory for Ho Chi Minh in the national elections called for in 1956 in the Geneva Accords. Among the American naval personnel working in Haiphong was Dr. Tom Dooley who would write an influential, best-selling, anti-communist book, Deliver us From Evil, and become one of the most outspoken anti-communists of the day. ;24 August President Eisenhower wrote President Di·ªám a letter assuring Di·ªám that the United States would support his government if he continued to implement democratic reforms. This letter was later cited by U.S. President Lyndon Johnson as the first step in the U.S. commitment to support South Vietnam.  September  ;8 September In Manila, the U.S., Australia, France, New Zealand, Pakistan, Philippines, Thailand, and the United Kingdom signed the treaty creating the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), a collective defense agreement that had among its objectives protecting Laos, Cambodia, and South Vietnam from communist aggression. ;15-24 September Prime Minister Di·ªám faced the first crisis of his new government. He dismissed the Army chief of staff General Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Hinh and ordered him to leave the country. Hinh refused to obey and a few days later surrounded the Presidential palace with tanks.

With his supporters absent, Hinh called off the proposed coup. ;29 October The record for the most passengers taken in one journey during Operation Passage to Freedom was set by the USS General Black, which sailed with 5,224 Vietnamese aboard.Frankum, p. 159.  November  ;8 November General Lawton Collins arrived in Saigon as special representative of the United States. He affirmed President Eisenhower's earlier expression of support for Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám. Collins promised $100 million in U.S. aid and stated that the Di·ªám government \\"is the legal government in Vietnam.\\" He warned the South Vietnamese army that it would receive American assistance only if it supported Di·ªám. ;14 November U.S. Ambassador Donald R. Heath departed Vietnam, leaving Collins as the senior U.S. official in the country. Heath was considered by Washington to be too accommodating to the French and too disparaging of Prime Minister Di·ªám. ;29 November General Vinh left Vietnam for exile in Paris, thereby reducing the possibility of a military coup against the Di·ªám government. His principal co-conspirators followed. Vinh had been ordered to leave Vietnam almost two months earlier by Di·ªám, but had ignored the order until ordered to depart by B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i.  December  North Vietnam concluded an aid agreement with China for equipment and technical assistance to repair roads, railroads, and other infrastructure. Russian and Chinese technical advisers began to replace the French. ;13 December General Collins and General Paul Ely, commander of the French military in South Vietnam, signed a \\"Minute of Understanding\\" to govern the withdrawal of French military forces from South Vietnam. The South Vietnamese army would be reduced in size from 170,000 to a more-affordable 90,000 men, the Americans and French would cooperate in training the army, and France would turn over full control of the Vietnamese army to Vietnam by July 1955. ;16 December Collins quickly came to agree with former Ambassador Heath's low opinion of Di·ªám. Collins suggested that the U.S. give thought to \\"possible alternatives\\" if the Di·ªám government did not make progress and, if no acceptable alternative to Di·ªám could be found, the U.S. should consider withdrawing from Vietnam. ;24 December U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles rebuked Collins for his suggestion that an alternative to Di·ªám be sought. Dulles said that under \\"present circumstances...we have no choice but to continue...our support of Di·ªám.\\"  See also  * 1940‚Äì1946 in French Indochina * 1947‚Äì1950 in French Indochina * 1955 in the Vietnam War  References  Category:1954 in French Indochina Category:1954 in Vietnam Category:Years in the Vietnam War Category:United States history timelines ","title":"1954 in Vietnam"},{"id":"43417272","text":"Petrophila jalapalis is a moth in the family Crambidae.

He was the head baseball coach at both Jacksonville, from 1967 to 1973, and Mercer, from 1978 to 2003. At Jacksonville, he led the Dolphins to their first two NCAA Tournaments, one each in the College and University Divisions. At Mercer, he won three TAAC Tournaments and was named TAAC Coach of the Year four times. A native West Virginian, Myers attended Marshall University, where he played baseball for the Thundering Herd under head coach Bill Chambers. He was also Mercer's soccer coach from 1974 to 1976, amassing a 12-21-3 overall record. Coaching career =Baseball= Early career After graduating from Marshall in 1960, Myers coached high school baseball in West Virginia for a few seasons. He began his college coaching career as a graduate assistant at Florida State in 1963. He then spent three seasons (1964‚Äì1966) at Miami-Dade Junior College as an assistant under Demie Mainieri. In 1964, Miami-Dade won the NJCAA National Championship. Jacksonville Ahead of the 1967 season, Myers was hired as the head coach at Jacksonville, then a College Division school. Myers said of the hire, \\"I think coaching at Jacksonville is going to be a tremendous challenge, but that's why I chose coaching as a profession, because of the challenge.\\" In his second season, Jacksonville had a 21-11-2 regular season to qualify for its first NCAA Tournament. It went 1-2 in the District 3 Regional held in Fort Eustis, Virginia. It lost its opener to Long Island, defeated Belmont Abbey in an elimination game, and was then knocked out by Long Island. Myers was named the season's College Division District 3 Coach of the Year. Jacksonville began playing in the large-school University Division in 1969. In 1972, it went 36-12 in the regular season to qualify for its first University Division Tournament. At the District 3 Regional in Gastonia, North Carolina, the team went 0-2, losing games to Ole Miss and South Alabama. During Myers's tenure, Jacksonville had three All-America selections and four MLB Draft selections. Tom McMillan, a second-round selection of the Cleveland Indians in 1973, later played in Major League Baseball. Mercer Myers left Jacksonville to become an assistant at Mercer from 1974 to 1977. He was promoted to head coach to replace Claude Smith. He was Mercer's head coach from 1978 to 2003 and had an overall record of 663-677-5. After going 32-16 in Myers' first season, 1978, Mercer joined the newly formed Trans America Athletic Conference. In its first five seasons in the league, 1979 to 1983, it had four 30-win seasons and won three TAAC Tournaments. Myers was named TAAC Coach of the Year in each of the tournament-winning seasons. The team returned to the TAAC Tournament in 1984. The Bears won three of the first four TAAC Player of the Year awards, including Craig Gibson's in 1985. Mercer struggled from 1986 to 1993. It had three winning seasons but no winning seasons in the TAAC. In 1994, however, Myers was named Coach of the Year for the fourth time as the team won West Division and played in the conference tournament. The Bears won their division again in 1997 and appeared in another conference tournament in 1999. Myers retired after the 2003 season. He was replaced by Gibson, who had been an assistant from 1987 to 1988 and 1994 to 2003. During his tenure, Mercer had 13 MLB Draft selections, including a high of three in both the 1983 and 1990 drafts. One former player, Mike Mimbs, went on to play in Major League Baseball.

One R&B; vocal group, for example, known as the Orioles, sang \\"gospel-styled reworkings of songs that had been popular country, blues, or R&B; songs.\\"Handyside, Christopher. A History of American Music: Soul and R&B; (p. 8). Chicago: Heinemann Library, 2006. Print In 1953, the Orioles recorded a gospel song called \\"Crying in the Chapel\\"; yet the band was considered to be R&B.; A strong influence on the merging of gospel and R&B; came from Sam Cooke. He started out as the lead singer for the gospel group Soul Stirrers, but had always loved blues and jazz. He would incorporate elements from these two musical styles into his gospel recordings. Even though he was making a nice living, he wanted to venture into secular music. In 1956, for fear he would upset his fans, bandmates, and his record label, he released his first R&B; single (called \\"Lovable\\") under the assumed name 'Dale Cooke'. Because his voice is distinctive, people were not fooled by the name Dale Cooke. Soon, other singers followed Cooke's footsteps, crossing over from gospel to R&B;/soul and merging the two. Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin and James Brown are other important figures who combined gospel and R&B.; In the early age of R&B;, the musicality distinguishing gospel from R&B; was blurred. There was little or no way to tell whether a person was listening to gospel music or R&B; music, unless they paid close attention to the lyrics.  Public reaction and acceptance  The success of a person's Christian music is partly based on how the songs are composed and who is performing those songs. Even secular R&B; artists are known to record Christian music.Breezy, Elle. \\"The R&B-Gospel; Connection: 10 Artists Who Straddle the Line.\\" . Singersroom, March 17, 2013. Web. July 29, 2014. .Cadet, Alesha . \\"Secular Artists Singing Gospel: Is That Okay?.\\" . Tribune 242, February 21, 2013. Web. July 29, 2014. . There are Christian singers with a balanced R&B; and contemporary gospel blend whereas other singers fuse hip hop with contemporary R&B;, a combination that has been in existence since the 1980s.\\"New Jack Swing.\\" . Wikipedia, July 17, 2014. Web. July 30, 2014. .\\"Hip Hop Soul.\\" . Wikipedia, July 30, 2014. Web. July 30, 2014. . Singers in the former will mainly attract those who prefer gospel music, and singers in the latter appeal to those who favor hip-hop and contemporary R&B.; Some artists, like Canton Jones, tend to alternate between both combinations, which may have garnered him a relatively larger audience than those who fuse gospel sounds only or hip-hop sounds only. = Religious reaction = Many people continuously listen to their favorite style of music after professing their Christian faith. They begin to find sacred music of the same genre. This would mean that those who listen to R&B; music could still do so after their religious conversion, embracing artists like J. Moss, Canton Jones, Mary Mary, One Nation Crew, 21:03, Mali Music, Cynthia Jones, and Debra Killings. Some Christian circles believe certain musical styles are inherently immoral, even if positive lyrics are being sung over the music.Solomon, Jerry. \\"Music and the Christian.\\" Music and the Christian.

They say genres like rap, rock, blues and R&B; should not mix with Christian music and that music should never veer away from the topic of Jesus, praise, or worship.\\"Bible Guide to Christian Music.\\" Bible Guide to Christian Music. Dial-the-Truth Ministries, n.d. Web. July 30, 2014. . In light of this info, it is no surprise that secular artists are backlashed after releasing gospel records. Several R&B; artists like Dave Hollister, Michelle Williams, Shei Atkins, Kelly Price, Coko, Shirley Murdock, James Ingram, Al Green, Montell Jordan and Aretha Franklin are said to have straddled the fence. In 2012, gospel singer Johnny Mo appeared on Christian television program Atlanta Live singing a Christian imitation of R. Kelly's 1994 hit \\"Bump n' Grind\\", titled \\"I Don't See Nothing Wrong with Living for Jesus\\".Armstrong, Drenna. \\"He Sees 'Nothing Wrong': Check Out Johnny Mo Singing a Gospel Song to the Tune of \\"Bump-N-Grind\\".\\" MadameNoire RSS.

Some of the comments on Madame Noir supported this song while others rejected it. One of the issues that some Christian music listeners may have with listening to Christianized versions of secular music is that the newer Christian version may cause the listener to have a flashback, tempting that listener to commit behaviors they no longer wish to enact.Stetzer, Ed. \\"7 Biblical Tests for Christians and Music.\\" . Christianity Today, June 5, 2013. Web. July 30, 2014. . = Secular reaction = Devout Christians are not the only ones enjoying Christian/gospel music. As one blogger who claims to be a black atheist said, \\"It‚Äôs not about the message. It‚Äôs about the sound and the feeling.\\" He goes on to say that although he doesn't believe in a god nor in the testimonies of gospel artists, he accepts gospel music because it is rooted in his African heritage. It is generally known that people listen to music that they can relate to. In this case, non-Christians and those who aren't serious about the faith may sometimes come across Christian music that affects them in emotions (giving them hope) or entertainment (loving the style of music without necessarily caring for the lyrics). Mary Mary, the R&B;/gospel singing duo, released their single \\"God in Me\\" in 2008, featuring Kierra \\"KiKi\\" Sheard. On the Billboard charts, the song peaked at No. 68 on the Hot 100 chart, reached the top 5 on the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs chart during its 43rd week, and went No. 1 on both the Dance Club Songs and Hot Gospel Songs charts. Mary Mary had another popular song, \\"Shackles (Praise You)\\", released between 1999 and 2000, peaking at No. 9 on the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs chart and No. 28 on the Hot 100 chart. Yolanda Adams is another popular R&B;/gospel singer, whose successes include four albums that reached the top 10 on the Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums Billboard chart. Her album Mountain High, Valley Low was on the chart for 94 weeks and peaked at No. 5\\\\. Her album Believe remained on the chart for 67 weeks and peaked at No. 7\\\\. Day By Day charted for 58 weeks and peaked at No. 4, and The Best of Me peaked at No. 9 while being on the chart for 18 weeks. Without going into further chart performances for other R&B;/gospel musicians, the two examples above reveal that these songs/albums were not only played on gospel channels, and that they were received by secular audiences. Other musicians whose music charted among the top 10 or close to the top 10 R&B;/Hip-Hop songs and the top 10 R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums are Oleta Adams, J. Moss, Trin-i-tee 5:7, BeBe Winans, and CeCe Winans.

These immigrants founded settlements in which descendants of Serbs live to these days: Bojanci, Marindol, Paunoviƒçi, Adle≈°iƒçi, ≈Ωuniƒçi, Miliƒçi and others. The majority of the community () have kept the Serbian Orthodox faith and their distinctive culture, although they have been almost completely assimilated to their Slovene-speaking environment. Some of them became Uniate (Eastern Catholic) in the 17th and 18th century. History With the Ottoman conquest of Serbian territories, groups of Serbs fled to the north or west; of the western migrational groups, some settled in White Carniola and ≈Ωumberak. In September 1597, with the fall of Slatina, some 1,700 Uskoks with their wives and children settled in Carniola, bringing some 4,000 sheep with them. The following year, with the conquest of Cernik, some 500 Uskoks families settled in Carniola. At the end of the 17th century, with the stagnation of Ottoman power due to European pressure during internal crisis, and Austrian advance far into Macedonia, Serbs armed themselves and joined the fight against the Ottomans; the Austrian retreat prompted another massive exodus of Serbs from the Ottoman territories in ca. 1690 (see Great Serb Migrations). Location of ƒårnomelj municipality. White Carniola, being the southernmost region of Slovenia, by the Kupa river, is also the northwesternmost Serbian linguistical island, heard from often repeated phrases. In reality, the Serbian language is rarely heard in the last four villages in which descendants of Serb uskoks live, who continue to espouse a Serb identity: Bojanci, Marindol, Miliƒçi and Paunoviƒçi. In the other historical European‚ÄìOttoman frontier villages in the region, there are today Uniate (Eastern Catholic) and Catholicisated descendants of Serbs who only speak the Slovenian language. The community had traditionally taken wives from other Serb communities, such as in nearby Gorski kotar (in Croatia). The first mixed marriage was recorded in Bojanci and White Carniola in 1947, and since then, Bojanci Serbs \\"seek wives in the Slovenian milieu\\". Before World War II, the gravestones were written in Serbian Cyrillic, while today, they are written in Serbian Latin. The assimilation of the White Carniolan Serbs continued, with a Serbian primary school being closed in 1992. In 1967, there was an estimated 500‚Äì600 Serbs in White Carniola. The number of Serb households shrunk with 300% during the 1981‚Äì1991 period, with a total number of 121 households in 1991. According to Zdravko Vukƒçeviƒá from Bojanci and Orthodox priest Jelenko Stojanoviƒá from Moravice, Serb children from Miliƒçi and Paunoviƒçi began entering Slovenian schools in Adle≈°iƒçi and ƒårnomelj. In the area of White Carniola are mentioned Vlachs from Marindol in 1668. \\"die Walachen zu Marienthall beclagen sich\\" Pifoƒái o poku≈°aju osloboƒëenja Like iz koje Vlasi ƒçine nasilja i zloƒçine po sredifojoj Hrvatskoj, provaljujuƒái i u dubinu Kranjske, lviƒá sugerira svome ƒçitatelju kako je amtrijski_ nadvojvoda naredio ¬ªproterivanje Srba iz Like¬´.

The middle generation speak Serbian and Slovenian equally, while the youngest generation do not speak Serbian, while passively knowing it ‚Äì grandparents speak to their grandchildren in Serbian, while they answer in Slovenian. =Religion= Bojanci, Marindol, Miliƒçi and Paunoviƒçi are Orthodox villages, with the population espousing a Serb identity. The Serbian Orthodox Church gradually loses its integral function in the region; Orthodox churches exist in Bojanci and Miliƒçi, while the parish of Miliƒçi include Marindol and Paunoviƒçi. The churches are for long without priests. Miliƒçi had their priest until 1950, while today the priest comes from Moravice, while the priest in Bojanci comes from Gorimje in Lika (the priest came once a month up until some years ago, today only for the biggest religious holidays. Serbian Orthodox clergy in White Carniola have traditionally taken monastic vows in the Gomirje Monastery, and still today serve in the villages of Bojanci and Marindol. =Folklore= In old folk poetry of White Carniola, Serbian hero Prince Marko is often mentioned, sung in \\"clean Shtokavian\\". =Monuments= Serbian Orthodox churches *Church of the Beheading of St. John the Baptist in Bojanci.

Hansma is an American physicist at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Early life and education Paul K. Hansma was born in Salt Lake City, Utah on April 28, 1946. He received his undergraduate degree from New College, and his PhD in physics from the University of California, Berkeley where he studied electron tunneling and Josephson junctions. Career Hansma became an Assistant Professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1974. He then became an Associate Professor three years later. In the 1970s, Hansma began working in electron tunneling spectroscopy, and moved to STM-based experiments by the early 1980s. This included biological STM as of 1985, when he adapted his STM microscopes to work in water (previously STMs would only work in air). Over the 1980s, Hansma worked in conjunction with IBM Zurich, researching the use of probe microscopy and its use in a variety of different fields. As a part of this work, he co-developed three scanning tunneling microscopes for the University of California, Santa Barbara. In the late 1980s, Hansma then worked on the development of atomic force microscopes and their use in research. This included the use of AFMs in genetic research, using them to observe DNA and RNA molecules in manner that did not disturb their natural interactions during the late 1990s. In 1991, Hansma researched the process of corrosion in infrastructure and other places like car batteries, and looked at the role the type of electrolyte involved has on the corrosion‚Äôs progress. In 2005 Hansma‚Äôs discovered the existence of a biopolymer in human bones that provides a ‚Äúglue‚Äù like function, correlatively strengthening or weakening the bone.http://pubs.acs.org/cen/news/83/i30/8330notw6.html Around this time he also began to develop high-speed scanning AFMs. During his research into bone glue, Hansma developed the OsteoProbe, and also spent time researching the use of natural adhesives to create optimized adhesives for other applications. He is also the developer of Reference Point Indentation, which tests bone quality. He is also the inventor of Scanning Ion Conductance Microscopy. Recognition Hansma is the namesake of the Paul Hansma Research Group at the Department of Physics of the University of California, Santa Barbara. In 1964 he was named a Presidential Scholar by President Lyndon Johnson. He is a fellow of the American Physical Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and was the 2000 recipient of the Max Delbruck Prize in Biological Physics.

For more than three decades she has been a leading researcher in the field of swallowing abnormalities. Her work has uncovered correlations among elderly populations who are at increased risk for pneumonia, choking and other serious medical conditions as a result of dysphagia. Using grants from N.I.H. and the Department of Veterans Affairs, Robbins developed a medical device designed to help people afflicted with swallowing disorders. Career highlights Robbins is a noted academic, researcher and entrepreneur. She holds teaching positions at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and serves as associate director of research at the William S. Middleton Memorial Veterans Hospital. She has conducted extensive studies on aging. Although motor exercises have been used widely as a treatment for speech problems for many decades, Robbins applied strengthening therapy to swallowing rehabilitation. In 2012, she began a clinical demonstration project which sought to improve swallowing and eating-related care for dysphagic veterans. In 2013, Robbins introduced a new medical device to provide isometric exercises for treating patients with dysphagia. The product, sold through a company called Swallow Solutions, is an oral mouthpiece which uses sensors to measure pressure at five locations on the tongue. She frequently speaks via Internet trade portals and at conferences around the United States. She is coauthor of a culinary book targeted for those who have difficulty swallowing. First published in 2002, the book is titled, The Easy-to-Swallow, Easy-to-Chew Cookbook. Education Robbins earned a B.A. degree from Temple University in 1972, an M.S. degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1973, and a Ph.D. from Northwestern University in 1981. She completed a postdoctoral fellowship program through NIH‚Äôs National Research Service Award.

The farm has been in the hands of the Weston family for many generations, and is one of the largest agricultural operations in Fryeburg. The centerpiece of the complex, on the south side of River Street, is an impressive Second Empire house built 1870-73, and believed to be designed by Portland architect Frances Fassett. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure on a stone foundation. Its main block has a mansard roof; ells extend to the rear of the house that have gable roofs. The main facade is three bays wide, with a center entry flanked by paired sash windows, and a four-column porch extending across its width. The roof cornice and dormers have fine woodwork decoration typical of the Second Empire style.National Register nomination for Rivercroft Farm; available by request from the National Park Service Adjacent to the house is the Yellow Barn, which was built sometime before 1880, and added to in c. 1950 and c. 1985. It is connected to a c. 1950 silo by a short single-story connector. The farm stand, which is also one of the older buildings in the complex, was originally used as a wagon shed, and was converted to its present use in the 1980s. An addition with modern facilities was added to the rear at that time. On the north side of River Street, across from the main complex, stands the White Cape. This 1-1/2 story wood frame Cape style house was built c. 1834. The first colonial settler of the farm was Henry Brown, who was granted land believed to be north of that granted to Joseph Frye, for whom Fryeburg is named. Brown sold the land when it was established that his grant fell within Fryeburg, and it was purchased in 1800 by Ephraim Weston. In the first half of the 19th century Weston and his successors amassed a significant number of land holdings in Fryeburg and surrounding towns in Maine and New Hampshire, reaching over at its greatest extent. John Weston (1834-1909) specialized the farm for livestock production, and had what is now the main farmhouse built, replacing an older Federal-style house. A portion of the Weston's farm holdings, encompassing more than and including their houses and major outbuildings, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Alice Elizabeth Mulholland, and was granddaughter of John Mulholland, 1st Baron Dunleath of Ballywalter, County Down. She was involved in the Northern Irish unionist militia Ulster Volunteers during the Home Rule Crisis, and participated in the distribution of firearms associated with the 1914 SS Clyde Valley Larne gun-running operation led by Major Frederick H. Crawford. Wichfeld's favorite brother, Lieutenant John Clarina Massy-Beresford served with the Royal Field Artillery in World War I and was killed in action in 1918 at the age of 21. After this event, Wichfeld was reported to have harboured a personal hatred of the Germans. Marriage Portrait of Monica Wichfeld in the National Museum of Denmark On 15 June 1916, she married Danish aristocrat and diplomat J√∏rgen Adalbert Wichfeld (16 August 1885 - 30 July 1966), the Secretary of the Danish Legation to London. Wichfeld and her husband moved to his Engestofte Estate in Maribo Denmark, where she became a Danish citizen and had three children: Ivan (1919), Varinka (1922) and Viggo (1924). During this time, she became friends and lovers with Kurt Heinrich Eberhard Erdmann Georg von Haugwitz-Hardenberg-Reventlow who lived in neighbouring Hardenberg Manor. The relationship with Reventlow would continue for nine years. J√∏rgen Wichfield was aware of the relationship and unconcerned with it, naming Reventlow as Varinka's godfather. When the relationship ended, Reventlow went on to marry Barbara Hutton. The 1920s Danish tax reforms created a decline in the family's financial status, and the Wichfelds moved to Campo dei Fiori, a house owned by Wichfeld's mother in Rapallo on the Italian Riviera. Wichfeld travelled widely in Europe during this time and socialized with many notable people of the era, including No√´l Coward, Clementine Churchill and Tallulah Bankhead. As The Great Depression came to Europe, the family fell further in decline, and Wichfeld took matters into her own hands. She moved alone to Paris to develop a custom line of beauty products, including a Coco Channel-based essence, a fingernail protectant called No- Crax, as well as a profitable line of jewelry which reinvigorated the family's financial standing. Danish Resistance in World War II Engestofte Estate with the private Wichfeld family burial plot in the foreground After the outbreak of World War II Wichfeld's family was forced to leave Italy when Mussolini ordered British citizens leave the country in 1941. She returned to Engestofte in Denmark, and began to actively seek out supporters of the Danish resistance. In the summer of 1942 she rented a cottage at Engestofte to journalist Hilmar Wulff and his wife along with dissident poet Halfdan Rasmussen. All three were members of the Danish Communist Party and Wulff was the editor of two underground newspapers Frit Denmark (Free Denmark) and Land og Folk (Land and People). Wichfeld began to drum up funds to feed the production and distribution of the papers, and to fund the underground activities of the Communist Party. Later that year, in a new partnership with Erik Kiersgaard a member of the resistance who had organized a sabotage unit, Wichfeld began to store firearms, ammunition and explosives at Engestofte to support their cause. Through Count Carl-Adam \\"Bobby\\" Moltke, the son of a former Danish Foreign Affairs Minister and deeply connected member of the political underground of Copenhagen, Wichfeld met Flemming Muus, a man that had trained under Winston Churchill's Special Operations Executive, and would eventually become her son-in-law. Wichfeld made her estate available to Muus to house the top-secret SOE agent Jens Jacob Jensen, codenamed \\"Jacob\\" and shelter him. Eventually she and Jacob grew to lead the Lolland resistance and Engestofte became central to the recruitment, training, arming, planning, direction and organization of the actions of the resistance (such as the bombing of the Naskov shipyard), as well as being a receiving ground for British paratroopers and weapons drops. When the resistance gained momentum and the Nazis sent in forces to quell it, Wichfeld was instrumental in facilitating the escape of Danish patriots fleeing the country, including Himar Wulff and his wife. During this time, she also challenged the Danish resistance, who was reticent to facilitate safe passage for Jewish families, and personally began to harbour a Jewish family being sought by the Gestapo. Arrest, imprisonment and death In late 1942 telephone transmissions between Jacob and other resistance members were intercepted by Gestapo wiretaps and led to the arrest of Jacob in √Örhus. Under interrogation and torture, Jacob gave away the names of forty-four resistance fighters and a hundred Danish families working with them. Wichfeld was one of them. Despite having received rumours that the Gestapo had evidence against her and would be coming to arrest her, Wichfield refused to leave Engestofte saying \\"I have joined the struggle for Denmark. I am willing to pay the price.\\" In January 1944, she was arrested at Engestofte and imprisoned in Copenhagen's Vestre F√¶ngsel prison where she was subjected to daily interrogation for four months. The resistance did mount a rescue plan that involved bribing a Gestapo agent to help facilitate her escape with a staged ambush, but the agent bungled the plan by getting drunk and having himself revealed. The Gestapo staged the transfer of an agent disguised as Wichfeld to try and capture the resistance ambush team that included her daughter Varinka and Flemming Muus, but the team recognized the agent as a decoy and did not attack. In May 1944, Wichfeld stood trial with ten other defendants in the resistance. Together with Georg Quistgaard and two others she was sentenced to death but told she could beg clemency to have it commuted to a life sentence. She asked the court if the same offer extended to the other defendants, and when it was not, turned it down flatly, and then sat down and casually powdered her nose. There was outrage across the country at her sentence, as capital punishment for women had long since been considered barbaric in Denmark. The sentence was later turned over into a life sentence, and because there was no penal servitude for women in Denmark, she was transferred with other women captured as part of the resistance Hvidsten group to Cottbus POW camp in Germany, and eventually transferred to Waldheim Prison. She died there of pneumonia on 27 February 1945 after a long bout of tuberculosis, one month before the end of World War II. Wichfeld is listed on the memorial wall in Ryvangen Memorial Park indicating that the whereabouts of her remains are unknown.

Early years David Milton Salman was born in Houston, Texas, on 11 February 1936. He was from a Jewish family that was involved in shipping in Houston. He graduated from high school in Las Vegas, New Mexico and went on to Princeton University, graduating in 1958. In 1958‚Äì59 he served in the Army Field Artillery. Salman purchased the former La Cueva Ranch in Mora County, New Mexico, which he revitalized by producing farm products, particularly raspberries. He was president of the Salman Ranch from 1960 to 2002. Salman was president of Sierra Gold Dairy for over twenty years at the same time as being a vice president of the First National Bank in Las Vegas. He was a member of the Board of Trustees of the Las Vegas Hospital. Salman was a member of the board of regents of the New Mexico Highlands University from 1963 to 1969. Political career Salman was a member of the House of Representatives in New Mexico from 1969 to 1978 for District 69 in Mora, Harding and San Miguel counties. From 1971 to 1978 he was the majority floor leader. He was a member of the \\"Mama Lucy Gang\\", a loose coalition of centrist Democrats and some Republicans that controlled the House during most of the 1970s. The group included Bernalillo County liberals and Northern New Mexico representatives. Salman was the main sponsor of the Public Schools Financing Act in 1971 and the School Equalization Fund in 1972. He was also behind the foundation of the International Space Hall of Fame in Alamogordo. In 1974 Salman was injured in an automobile accident that was followed by years of reconstructive surgery, and this hampered his political career. Salman campaigned for the protection of mountain lions. At one time he arranged for a lion to be brought in the House. He was a sponsor of the public school funding equalization formula. He also sponsored severance taxes on finite natural resources, a higher minimum-wage law and bilingual education Other measures supported by Salman included incentives for solar heating and power systems, energy savings in public buildings, environmental improvement board powers, sulfur emissions control, radioactive materials disposal, the beverage container act and acquisition of Vermejo Park. In 1978 Salman was the main sponsor of the state's 1978 Controlled Substances Therapeutic Research Act, which allowed the medical use of marijuana. The act was to legalize the use of the drug to relieve pain and suffering from debilitating illnesses. The House Judiciary voted 9‚Äì1 to recommend passage of bill. Salman said, \\"What are we saying to the young people? We're saying that New Mexico, this Legislature, cares about your fellow citizens and (doesn't) want to see them suffer needlessly, subject to Draconian laws.\\" However, the bill did not legalize sale of marijuana. Patients could keep a three-month supply, but would have to grow their own or buy it illegally. Later years In April 1980 the Taos News reported mounting opposition to a music and ecology festival that was proposed to be held on the Salman ranch. A number of businessmen in the Mora area had signed a petition against the festival in the remote mountain area of Northern New Mexico, expected to attract up to 300,000 people. The ad hoc committee opposing the festival said \\"Ours has been a life-long sacrifice to remain free and isolated; It has been our free choice to live, defend and die for our land. It (the festival) Is not only an abuse of our human dignity but also a breakdown of our moral upbringing. At Issue is the violation of our human rights, Invasion of our privacy and security... Our traditional way of life is being abused by publicly advertising that there will be 'practical demonstrations of alternate energy and life systems, display of Southwestern art and culture and ecological restorations projects'.\\" After leaving office Salman served in the New Mexico Arts Commission for seven years and the New Mexico State Game Commission for four years. David Salman died on 28 February 2010 at the age of 74. At the time of his death he was a board member of the Capital Arts Foundation.

The empress dowager is now increasingly unhappy with Xiaoyanzi, believing she is not ladylike to be Yongqi's wife, particularly in carrying on the family line. At the same time, Qing'er and Xiaoyanzi's brother, Xiao Jian, were also in love. But empress dowager dislike Xiao Jian, especially after when she finds that Xiaoyanzi and Xiao Jian's father was killed by Qianlong. She thinks that the siblings may want to kill Qianlong for revenge. Before she finds out this fact, they went to Chen's family, where she met Zhihua. The Dowager likes Zhihua more than Xiaoyanzi, and wants Zhihua to marry Yongqi. After returning to the imperial palace, the empress dowager makes a plan to separate Yongqi and Xiaoyanzi, Qing'er and Xiao Jian. She threatens them that she would kill Xiao Jian if Yongqi does not marry Zhihua, and requests that Zhihua should be wife and Xiaoyanzi should be a concubine. To save Xiao Jian's life, they accept the empress dowager's conditions and Xiao Jian is sent away. Yonqi marries Zhihua, as the empress dowager requests. The empress dowager also sends many servants to come and serve the couple. First, they pretend that they really love each other. However, Zhihua really loves Yongqi, and forces him to bathe with her, which angers Xiaoyanzi. Although Yongqi gives in and marries Zhihua, Zhihua remains a virgin after marrying Yongqi for quite a long time. But eventually, Erkang and Ziwei persuade Xiaoyanzi that Zhihua has the right to have a child of Yongqi. Xiaoyanzi, being convinced, forced Yongqi to enter Zhihua's room. Not long later, Zhihua is found pregnant. Not much time after the news, both Yongqi and Erkang volunteer to go into war with Burma. In the war, when Erkang fights with the eighth 'prince', who he finds that 'he', or rather 'she', is actually the eighth princess, Musha. Musha is attracted to Erkang, and plans to take him back to Burma. Musha disguises another soldier to look like Erkang to make the Qings think that Erkang is dead. After the war ends, Xiao Jian remains in YunNan, because he is suspicious about Erkang's death. Xiao Jian later discovers Erkang may not be dead and has been captured to Burma. Xiao Jian takes the news back to Yongqi, Xiaoyanzi, Ziwei, Qing'er in Beijing. The Group travels to Burma in order to rescue Erkang. They initially ask Qianlong to let them go to Burma to rescue Erkang, but Qianlong doubts the news and refuses to let them go. They resolve to go to Burma on their own by sneaking out of the palace. Xiaoyanzi wants to stay in YunNan, and she convinces Yongqi to stay with her. Zhihua hears their conversation and gets angry. Qianlong also asks to see the person who brought the news, Xiao Jian, but Xiao Jian refuses to see the emperor. Eventually, Xiao Jian is forced to make an appearance, and Zhihua tells everything that she knows. She tells Qianlong that Xiao Jian and Xiaoyanzi's parents were killed by Qianlong. Xiao Jian attempts to kill Qianlong, who is rescued by Yongqi. Xiao Jian, raged, wants to kill Yongqi, but Xiaoyanzi pushes Xiao Jian out of the way. She convinces Xiao Jian that Yongqi was the love of her life. Qianlong, not knowing what to do, sends them all back to where they came from, and researches what really happened. Then, Qianlong calls them over to tell them what really happened to Xiaoyanzi and Xiao Jian's father. After that, Qianlong decides to let them go. Yongqi also abandons Zhihua and her son, and lives like a commoner with Xiaoyanzi, Qing'er and Xiao Jian. After finding Erkang, Xiao Jian and Qing'er are married.

His poetic, individualistic and unexpected visions about contemporary art made lasting contributions to the lives of countless artists and colleagues at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City where he worked from 1959 to 2008. He is said to be the first curator of color at a major American museum and at his retirement he had risen to the position of chief curator at large of painting and sculpture.  Early life and education  Born Kynaston Leigh Gerard McShine to Leonora Pujadas and Austen Hutton McShine, Kynaston McShine was the elder of two children. Pujadas was president and founder of the League of Women Voters in Trinidad while his father was president of a bank. As a child, McShine and his brother attended Queen's Royal College in Trinidad and Tobago. In 1958, McShine earned a bachelor of arts degree from Dartmouth College, where he studied philosophy while working at the Hood Museum of Art. He began graduate studies at University of Michigan in 1959. After a brief period of employment, he continued his graduate studies at New York University.  Career  In 1959, McShine was hired in the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA)'s public information department. From there, he moved to its department of circulating exhibitions, where he organized a traveling exhibit of work by Robert Motherwell. After becoming associate curator at the MoMA in 1968, he initiated the Projects series, devoted to emerging, experimental art. Exhibitions in the Projects series included an early survey of Conceptual art, titled Information in 1970, as well as exhibitions of Marcel Duchamp (1973), Joseph Cornell (1980), Andy Warhol (1989), The Museum as Muse: Artists Reflect (1999), Edvard Munch: The Modern Life of the Soul (2006) and Richard Serra Sculpture: Forty Years (2007). He held the position of associate curator in MoMA's Department of Painting and Sculpture until 1971, after which he assumed the roles of Curator of Exhibitions from 1971 to 1984; Senior Curator, 1984‚Äì2001; Acting Chief Curator 2001-03, and Chief Curator at Large from 2003 until his retirement in 2008. McShine was also curator at the Jewish Museum and served as acting director there from 1967-68. There he organized the first museum survey of Minimalist art, Primary Structures: Younger American and British Sculptors'. From 1965-1968 McShine taught at Hunter College. In 2003, McShine was the recipient of the CCS Bard Award for Curatorial Excellence.  Notable exhibitions  = Primary Structures = McShine's 1966 exhibition, Primary Structures: Younger American and British Sculptors, at the Jewish Museum was the first museum survey of minimalist art. It included work by artists such as Tony Smith, Gerald Laing, Carl Andre, Donald Judd, Robert Morris, and Sol LeWitt before the term \\"Minimalism\\" was used to describe their work. The groundbreaking show was restaged by the Jewish Museum in their 2014 exhibition Other Primary Structures. The show posited for the first time that artist may master design rather than a craft. Mark di Suvero called the exhibition \\"the key show of the 1960s.\\" = Projects series = McShine began MoMA's Projects series that focuses on small scale experimental work by emerging artists. The first exhibition in the series was work by artist Keith Sonnier, and continued with work by artists like Jonathan Borofsky, Sam Gilliam, Bill Beckley and Rafael Ferrer. = Information = In 1970, McShine curated an international survey of new conceptual art. The exhibition included 130 artists, filmmakers and collectives and was centered around the new influence of communication technologies and criticized the involvement of the US government in the war in Vietnam. The exhibit was effectively institutional critique, disrupting the accepted canon, unpacking art's new direction and introducing lesser known international artists like H√©lio Oiticica, Marta Minujin and Group OHO alongside more familiar American artists like Lucy R. Lippard, Robert Smithson, Richard Serra, and Yvonne Rainer. The catalog for the exhibition featured a typewriter font and inexpensive stock, offering each artist space to do as they chose. In the catalog, McShine suggested painting might not be suited to tackle more contemporary issues that Conceptual art can. = Museum as Muse = In his 1999 exhibition, Museum as Muse: Artists Reflect, McShine re-examined institutional critique, bringing together artists that use the museum as their subject matter. He brought together work from artists like Marcel Duchamp, Joseph Cornell, Hans Haacke, Ed Ruscha, Sherrie Levine, Fred Wilson, Louise Lawler, Daniel Buren and Janet Cardiff. There were 182 works included of painting, video, printed brochure and installation art that ranged from critiquing the museum to celebrating it.  Controversies  In 1984, McShine curated An International Survey of Recent Painting and Sculpture at MoMA. The exhibition purported to present the most notable recent work in contemporary art. Of 165 artists in the show, only 13 were women, spurring a group of women artists of the time to form Guerrilla Girls, who continue their activist performance and multi-media work today. In 2017, it was revealed that a wedding cake sculpture commissioned by McShine for the Museum of Modern Art from Pat Lasch as part of its fiftieth anniversary celebrations in 1979 was discarded by the museum sometime in the 1990s, a fact which was not disclosed to the artist until 2016.  Personal life  McShine was photographed by Robert Mapplethorpe in 1988.

The aircraft is under development by MVP.Aero Inc. of Delaware. The company has its design and engineering team in Duluth, Minnesota, with management and administration based in Minneapolis. In January 2016 it was announced that the plane will be built in Brunswick, Maine. Design and development The MVP Model 3 is designed to operate on land, water, snow and ice. The floor panels can be rearranged to accommodate fishing or camping. The design will be marketed in several versions, including the E-AB, E-LSA, and S-LSA. The aircraft is a two-seats in side-by-side configuration with a pusher propeller and folding wings, which are constructed with carbon-fiber composite spars and covered with fabric. The balance of the airframe is constructed from a combination of carbon fiber and fiberglass. Electric thrusters help the aircraft manoeuvre in the water.Tacke, Willi; Marino Boric; et al: World Directory of Light Aviation 2015-16, page 69. Flying Pages Europe SARL, 2015. The design allows the canopy to be raised on a four bar system to sit above the engine cowling. This leaves the cockpit area open for fishing from and can also allow mounting of a tent for camping, with the floor panels inserted. With the canopy fully open the engine can still be run for water maneuvering.

During a regular service, \\"attendees are offered a warm welcome, the praise choir that leads a vibrant worship, and the congregants who clap and sway with the spirit of the music present a mosaic of black, white, and every shade in between.\\" Cornerstone Maumee's children's ministry, with a 22,000-square-foot wing, has several themed rooms - including a rain forest and a 1950s diner - designed by former Disney employees.

Philanthropy and Outreach Cornerstone Church has a strong history of local and global outreach. The biggest local outreach is an annual event titled Volunteer Outreach Week (VOW), which mobilizes volunteers throughout a week in Summer. These volunteers partner with over 50 organizations to provide assistance however needed. In 2015, the first year the Church coordinated VOW, over 350 volunteers participated. This grew to over 450 volunteers across all campuses by the third year. By year five, this had grown to over 700 people. To date, the Church has invested over $150,000 in volunteer service through VOW. Asked by the Toledo Blade about the importance of being a racially integrated church, Bishop Pitts responded, \\"I think it's important for every person to see someone who looks like them being used by God\\". \\"And it's important for every person to see someone who doesn't look like them to be used by God. When I see someone who looks like me, then I can identify and know that God has something for me\\", he said, expanding on the point. \\"But if I only see people like me, then I think that's who God uses, people who look like me. So I need to see someone different as well, so I know that God uses other people.\\" Their outreach arm is known as Heal The World, which has historically worked locally and globally with various partners, from covering the cost of soup kitchen Thanksgiving meals, to collecting Bibles for US soldiers, to partnering with Mercy Ministries, to hosting the African Children's Choir, and supporting Dr Patricia Bailey-Jones who ministers with Master's Touch Ministry Global. For over 20 years of ministry, Cornerstone Church partnered with, and hosted annual WOWJAMs, a ministry started by Stephen and Linda Tavani aimed at reaching poorer communities around the city by utilizing music, games, dances, and prizes. In summer 2015 the Eastwood Theater Campus began a partnership with Lucas County Feed The Children. The free meals were supplemented with wholesome activities during the afternoons. Easter egg hunt 2018 After decreased city funding for Toledo city pools caused several to remain closed for several summers, in spring 2016, Bishop Pitts pledged $52,000 to open Navarre Pool, on the East Side of Toledo, on behalf of the church. The pool is blocks from the Eastwood Campus, in East Toledo. Cornerstone also provided funding to open Savage Park Splash Pad in the inner city of Toledo. Both the pool and splash pad were opened with the intention of running summer programs and activities, as well as adding additional sites to the Summer Meal Program partnership. The church has packed thousands of backpacks throughout the years for local school children in preparation of their upcoming academic year. In 2017, the church transitioned to funding and supporting the United Way of Greater Toledo Kickoff To Caring event which packs over 5,000 backpacks annually. Later that same summer the church responded to Hurricane Harvey by raising over $22,000 of relief funds across their campuses and in partnership with the Cornerstone Global Network, and sending a team of thirteen volunteers to Victoria, Texas to assist in the relief efforts of Samaritan's Purse. The team gutted homes, tarped roofs, and counseled those who had undergone loss in the community. In 2019 the church sent a team of 14 members from its Global Network to Kenya for a 2-week missions trip. The Church's Lima Campus regularly gives away turkeys as a part of their Thanksgiving outreach. Each Easter the church hosts a Glow in the Dark Easter Egg Hunt which sees thousands of people across all locations hunting for eggs during Easter weekend. The event started in 2014, and consistently prepares over 50,000 eggs per year. In late 2019 the church responded to Hurricane Dorian that caused widespread devastation across The Bahamas.

After 1955, however, a separate riding called Oshawa was created to serve the city of Oshawa, Ajax and parts of Pickering and Whitby, while the Ontario riding continued to serve the more rural areas in the county. In 1966 a new Ontario South was created to represent Ajax, Pickering and Whitby. The remainder of the riding was divided into the new ridings of Durham West, Durham East and Durham‚ÄîYork in 1975.

It spun into a scandal in Franco‚ÄìJapanese relations, becoming the first major international affairs challenge for the fledgling Meiji government. The incident occurred during a period of time that Hy≈çgo Port was open to foreign trade, with a community of foreign merchants and soldiers living and working in the Kobe foreign settlement. In response, the foreign militaries seized nearby Japanese warships and occupied the center of the city under the pretense of protecting their settlement. The Imperial court sent a representative to negotiate and inform the Westerners that power had shifted from the Tokugawa Shogunate to the newly-formed Meiji government. The Western representatives demanded Taki Zenzaburo, who was involved, be executed; Taki committed ceremonial seppuku on March 3. Initial incident On January 27, 1868, with the outbreak of the Boshin war, the new Meiji government ordered that Nishinomiya in Settsu be guarded in order to check the pro-Shogunate forces of Amagasaki Domain. By the 29th, 2,000 troops had been raised in Bizen Domain to the west, and among these were 500 (alternately 800) troops under the command of the domain's kar≈ç , accompanied by cannons, who marched over land for their destination. Because the port of Hy≈çgo had been opened on January 1, the troops advanced on the road rather than that built by the Tokugawa shogunate, in an effort to avoid encounters with enemy forces or foreigners. Sometime after 1 o'clock on February 4, as the line of Bizen troops marched along in the vicinity of Sannomiya Shrine, two French sailors emerged from a nearby building and attempted to cross the line. The Japanese troops saw this as constituting , an act of extreme disrespect under the Laws for the Military Houses, and Taki Zenzaburo, in charge of the third cannon group, took a spear and attempted to stop them. However, neither side could understand the other, and when the sailors attempted to force their way through, Taki stabbed at them with his spear, inflicting light wounds. The sailors briefly retreated indoors but reemerged with handguns. Taki, seeing this, shouted out \\"Guns, guns!\\", which his troops took as an order to shoot, beginning a firefight. The roadside skirmish soon also targeted the European and American dignitaries who were inspecting the adjacent planned site of a foreign settlement, and several full volleys were fired.According to Brandt 1901, \\"six or seven\\" volleys. Most of the bullets missed and flew over the heads of their intended targets, but did pierce the various foreign flags flying over the old Shogunate customs house on the other side of the planned site. Whether this was warning fire or simply badly aimed shots intended to kill was unclear even in the testimony of Western witnesses.Mitford (1915) and Francis Ottiwell Adams (1875) argued that the shots were intended to kill. Brandt (1901) said that the shots were aimed upwards, as if targeting the flags over the customs house, and inflicted only light wounds on two American apprentice sailors and one other foreigner. However, when the new government appealed for clemency for Taki, Brandt argued that the shots had been aimed to kill and only God's grace had spared his side's soldiers, and so there was no reason to lessen the punishment. Foreign response The British envoy Harry Smith Parkes, who happened to be present at the skirmish, was enraged, and notified the vessels of various nations present to celebrate the opening of the port of Hy≈çgo of a state of emergency. U.S. Marines, British guardsmen, and French sailors pursued the Bizen troops outside of the foreign settlement and exchanged fire at .According to Satow (1921). The area along which the river flowed at the time is now called Flower Road. On the Bizen side, Heki ordered his troops to cease fire and withdraw. There was one \\"coolie\\" killed, and a few wounded on either side. On that same day, the Great Powers that possessed consulates in Kobe militarily occupied central Kobe under the pretext of protecting the foreign settlement, and seized the Tokugawa warships anchored off the Hy≈çgo port. At this point in time, the Japanese imperial court had not yet informed foreign countries of the transition of power from the Shogunate to the Meiji government, and It≈ç Hirobumi attempted negotiations that quickly broke down. On February 8, the imperial court hurriedly announced the transfer of power to the Meiji government and declared the opening of Japan. Higashikuze Michitomi was assigned as a representative and reopened negotiations. The foreign countries demanded safety for their people and harsh punishment for the Japanese person responsible for the incident‚Äîin short, Taki's execution. There was some complaint that this was too harsh for an incident in which no one had actually died, and to the Japanese Taki's response to the foreign troops' tomowari seemed altogether natural, but in the face of a demand from the Great Powers there was nothing to be done. Date Munenari sent an appeal for clemency via It≈ç Hirobumi and Godai Tomoatsu, which arrived just in time, but was rejected by a vote of the foreign ministers, beginning with the French Consul General L√©on Roches. Finally, on February 24, Bizen Domain acceded to the foreign countries' demands. Taki committed seppuku before the assembled foreign officials at Eifuku-ji Temple on March 3. Heki, who had been in command of the troops, was simultaneously placed under house arrest, and the incident was tentatively resolved. Significance The Kobe Incident represented the first international diplomatic incident faced by the new government after the restoration of Imperial rule. Though this incident was ultimately resolved when the foreign powers forced the execution of Taki Zenzaburo (jp), it did demonstrate to them that the new Meiji government was now the ruling administration to deal with in terms of Japan's foreign policy. Furthermore, this incident showed the court's foreign-relations philosophy turning quickly from that of to . However, as the j≈çi faction did retain support in the new administration, the new foreign policy was not made clear internally. An official declaration of the change was finally made the next year, on July 7, 1869, based on a decision by the national council.

Summary  This documentary exposes the stresses and aggressions of soldiers at war, in which a few are driven by boredom, anger, hatred, social pressure, or sociopathy to commit war crimes. Private Adam Winfield was a 21-year-old soldier in Afghanistan when he attempted with the help of his father to alert the military to the murders his platoon was committing. But Winfield's pleas went unheeded. Pressured by threats to his life from his superior and other members of his unit, Winfield was drawn into a moral abyss and forced to make a split- second decision that changed his life forever. The film follows him and his family through wartime events and the legal proceedings that followed, interspersed with interviews of the soldiers in his platoon and photos and video footage from Afghanistan.

The name of the building came from the Italian for \\"little house\\"; the Casino itself was not a gambling business.  Operation  The building was originally designed by Calvert Vaux in 1862 as part of the Greensward Plan for Central Park. Initial plans called for a chalet-styled wooden structure with a low, broad hip roof. Before construction began, however, Vaux decided that a more permanent building was needed. The following year, with the assistance of Edward C. Miller and Jacob Wrey Mould, the Casino was redesigned as a Gothic Revival stone structure. The building opened in early 1864 as a restaurant intended for unaccompanied female visitors to Central Park, and was one of Central Park's three original restaurants. Soon, it was patronized by both men and women. While the building that housed the Casino belonged to the City of New York, the City often leased the Casino to independent operators. By the early 1920s, the Casino was rundown, and so it was renovated during the winter of 1921‚Äì1922. Jimmy Walker, mayor of New York City during the late 1920s, frequented the Casino and reportedly spent more time there than in New York City Hall. Besides entertaining elite guests in the restaurant, Walker had an office in the Casino and conducted city administration there while meeting with political cronies. In 1929 Walker terminated the lease of C.F. Zittel and allowed a friend, Sidney Solomon, to transform the Casino into one of New York's most expensive nightclubs. Plans for the renovated Casino were released in February 1929. Solomon renovated the interior of the Casino using a design from Viennese designer Joseph Urban, though he kept the exterior mostly the same. The renovated Casino reopened on June 4, 1929.  Demolition  When the Great Depression hit four months after the Casino reopened, the nightclub faced increasing criticism for operating on city land while maintaining prices only the wealthiest New York residents could afford. In 1930, as part of an enforcement of Prohibition, the United States government raided the Casino and seized alcoholic beverages. Walker's successor Fiorello H. La Guardia and his parks commissioner Robert Moses, who held a vendetta against Walker, wanted to tear down the Casino with the intention of building a playground on the site. In 1934, Moses served an eviction order to the Casino's management. When the Parks Association of New York City objected to the proposed playground because it would take away from the park's rural character, Moses dismissed the opposition as \\"preposterous\\". The Casino was ultimately demolished in 1936. Only the stained-glass windows of the Casino were preserved. They were installed in, and later removed from, the police station at the 86th Street transverse. The remaining fixtures were auctioned off for pennies on the dollar. The Rumsey Playfield was built on the site of the former restaurant, though it was also razed to make way for SummerStage.

Bogue came to Chicago, Illinois when he was fourteen and soon found employment with his brother. He was elected to the Board of County Commissioners of Cook County in 1872, then served a two-year term in the Illinois House of Representatives two years later. In 1883, he co-founded the Bogue & Hoyt real estate firm, later known as Bogue & Co. He was an early settler to Hyde Park, Illinois and often represented the town in political positions. Late in his life, Bogue was an arbitrator for several railroad traffic associations. Biography George Marquis Bogue was born in Norfolk, New York on January 21, 1842. When he was fourteen, his family moved west to Chicago, Illinois, where his brother Hamilton B. had moved four years earlier. Bogue attended public schools there for a year and then found work with his brother with the Merchant Dispatch Fast Freight Line. He moved to Hyde Park, Illinois in 1858; he was one of the first eight families to settle in the suburb. In April 1859, he matriculated at the Cayuga Lake Academy in Aurora, New York, studying for two years. He returned to his brother's office in 1864, then joined the Land Department of the Illinois Central Railroad. From 1864 to 1868, he served as Hyde Park town clerk. In October 1867, Bogue joined the office of Ogden, Sheldon & Co., the oldest land agency in Chicago. In his free time, Bogue invested in real estate interests with his brother. He was named Hyde Park treasurer in 1869 and served in this capacity for three years. He was then elected to the Board of County Commissioners of Cook County. Bogue served for two years until he was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives in 1874. He served one two- year term there. When Shelby Moore Cullom was elected governor in 1877, he named Bogue to the Board of Railroad & Warehouse Commissioners. Bogue served on the board until March 1883. In 1883, he founded Bogue & Hoyt with his brother and Henry W. Hoyt. The partnership lasted until Hoyt died eight years later, whereupon the company was renamed Bogue & Co. with junior partner Harry W. Christian. Also in 1883, Bogue was elected Arbitrator of the Southwestern Railroad Traffic Association, the Northwestern Traffic Association, and the Colorado Traffic Association, serving for two years. He moved to Hinsdale, Illinois in 1888. Bogue retired July 1, 1893, though he still maintained personal real estate interests. Bogue married Catherine M. Van Doren on January 26, 1871. They had six children, three surviving to adulthood. The Bogues were Presbyterians and attended the Hyde Park Presbyterian Church. From 1864 to 1892, Bogue was a member of the church's board of trustees.

The division was formed twice, first from a cadre of NKVD soldiers that went on to become the 16th Guards Rifle Division after distinguishing themselves in the fighting for Toropets during the Soviet counteroffensive in the winter of 1941-42. The second formation was largely made up of ethnic Estonians and was known as the 249th Estonian Rifle Division. It fought under that name for the duration, and shortly after the German surrender became the 122nd Guards Rifle Division.  1st Formation  The division began organizing on June 26, 1941, in the Urals Military District. It was one of a series of rifle divisions numbered in the 240‚Äì260 range that were built on cadres taken from the NKVD, in this case internal troops. Its order of battle, based on the first wartime shtat (table of organization and equipment) for rifle divisions, was as follows: * 917th Rifle Regiment * 921st Rifle Regiment * 925th Rifle Regiment * 779th Artillery Regiment * 307th Antitank Battalion * 326th Antiaircraft Battery (later 526th Antiaircraft Battalion) * 328th Reconnaissance Company * 417th Sapper Battalion * 267th Medical/Sanitation Battalion * 247th Chemical Defense (Anti- gas) CompanyCharles C.

The division was assigned to 31st Army of Reserve Front until October, giving its troops more time to form up and train than many other divisions in that period. During that month it was assigned to 22nd Army in Kalinin Front, which was rebuilding after being partly overrun by the Germans in September.Russian Wikipedia In December the 249th was transferred again to 27th Army, which was soon renamed 4th Shock Army, in time for the general Soviet counteroffensive against the German Army Group Center starting on December 5. The division led the attack of its Army in January 1942, advancing over 100 km through deep snow and without regular supplies until capturing the German supply base at Toropets on January 21. During this advance it played a leading role in the encirclement and destruction of the 189th Infantry Regiment, together with the 2nd Battalion of Artillery Regiment 181 and the 3rd Company of Engineer Battalion 181 of the 81st Infantry Division at Okhvat. Other German forces were cut off in the Demyansk and Kholm pockets. For its efforts in this offensive, the 249th Rifle Division was re-designated as the 16th Guards Rifle Division on February 16.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", pp. 44-45  2nd Formation  A new division, originally designated the 423rd Rifle Division, then the 2nd Estonian Rifle Division, began forming on Feb. 10, 1942 in the Chelyabinsk Oblast of the Urals Military District. On Feb. 28 it was finally re-designated as the 249th Estonian Rifle Division. Its order of battle remained the same as the 1st Formation, with the addition of an unnumbered mortar battalion.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. X, Nafziger, 1996, p 97 The division was recruited from Estonians who had fled eastwards in front of the German invasion, including members of the Communist Party of Estonia. Recruitment was slow given a restricted manpower pool; by early March there were only 3,000 men on strength and the commander was not designated until May 6.Sharp, Red Swarm, p 97 Eventually over half of the division was descendants of Estonians who had emigrated to Russia in the previous century, and of non-Estonians. The division stayed in the Urals until September, then was shipped to the Moscow Military District where it joined the 7th Estonian and the 19th Guards Rifle Divisions to form the 8th Estonian Rifle Corps. The 249th remained in that Corps for the duration.Sharp, Red Swarm, p 97 In November the corps was assigned to Kalinin Front, and reinforced 3rd Shock Army in its attack against German Third Panzer Army in and around the city of Velikiye Luki. Its first battle was costly, and in spite of receiving the 162nd Machinegun Battalion and a training battalion as replacements in December, by the end of the battle on Feb. 1, 1943, the 249th was at about 50% strength, with a total of 4,213 officers and men.Sharp, Red Swarm, p 97 The division and its corps remained directly under Front command (in October Kalinin Front became 2nd Baltic Front) for the remainder of the year, attacking alongside 4th Shock Army towards Vitebsk in the Battle of Nevel in November and December. In February, 1944, 8th Corps was reassigned to the reserves of Leningrad Front, following the breaking of the German siege and that Front's advance towards the Baltic States. Once the 249th entered Estonia it could draw on the local population for replacements. By August it was at a strength of 7,946 officers and men, making it a very strong rifle division for that stage of the war. In September, 8th Corps became part of 8th Army, which was clearing the coasts of Estonia and Latvia as well as the islands offshore. On Oct. 6, the 1st Battalion of the 925th Rifle Regiment, along with the 328th Reconnaissance Company, staged an amphibious assault on one of these islands, mounted on US Lend Lease DUKW amphibious trucks of the 283rd Special Purpose Truck Battalion.Sharp, Red Swarm, p. 98 Two men of the 925th, Lt.

She headed the Department of Molecular Biology and Biophysics at the University of Connecticut Health Center and served as president of the American Society of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB). Early life and education Mary Jane Merten was born on September 24, 1927 in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Her family moved to Beverly Hills, California when she was five, and her father was very supportive of her scientific interests and ambitions. She received a bachelor's degree. in physiology from the University of California at Berkeley in 1948. She then earned a Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of Washington in 1958, where her thesis research investigated the function of folic acid-dependent enzymes and vitamins. In 1957, she discovered the mechanism of action of methotrexate, a pharmaceutical drug used to treat cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis. Career After receiving her Ph.D., she began a postdoctoral microbiology fellowship at the New York University College of Medicine, and was appointed assistant professor there in 1962. In 1963, she joined the Albert Einstein College of Medicine as an assistant professor, and was promoted to associate professor in 1996. She joined University of Connecticut School of Medicine as professor in 1968, where, as one of the founding members, she helped develop their medical school program. She served as professor of microbiology in the Department of Molecular, Microbial and Structural Biology and remained at the University of Connecticut until her retirement in 2014. While there, she served as a professor of microbiology and of molecular biology and biophysics, and headed the University of Connecticut's Department of Microbiology from 1980 to 2002. It was during her postdoctoral fellowship that she switched research focus to microbiology, examining the biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharides which contributed to the development of new antibiotics. Lipopolysaccharides, also known as bacterial endotoxin, are large molecules that are abundant on the surfaces of Gram-negative bacteria and contribute to bacterial toxicity and the immune response they provoke. She used a combination of biochemical experiments, bacterial genetics, and electron microscopy to investigate how bacteria transport lipopolysaccharides from the cellular interior where they are produced to the outer membrane where they reside. This work required the development of a new technique to separate the inner and outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria, which became known as the Osborn method. She also researched the mechanisms of bacterial cell division. Later in her career, she pursued an interest in space biology. Osborn worked for NASA and the National Research Council from the mid-1990s through 2008 on lunar and space exploration projects. In this capacity, she chaired NASA's Committee on Space Biology and Medicine, which helped plan U.S. space biology research in the early 2000s. Osborn served as editor of the journal Biochemistry and the Journal of Biochemistry. She chaired the National Institutes of Health Advisory Council, Division of Research Grants from 1992 to 1994 and served on the Council of the American Society of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB) from 1974 to 1975). She was the second woman to be elected ASBMB president (1981) and she also served as president of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (1982). Personal life She married painter Ralph Osborn. She had no children. She was interested in poetry and the arts, including ballet and opera. Osborn died January 17, 2019 at the age of 91 following complications after emergency surgery. Honors and awards Osborn was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1977, the National Academy of Sciences in 1978, and the American Academy of Microbiology in 1992. She was appointed to the National Science Board (governing body of the National Science Foundation) by President Jimmy Carter in 1980. She was chosen for the Chancellor's Distinguished Lectureship at the University of California, Berkeley in 1982. In 2002, the University of Connecticut Medical School established an annual Osborn Lectureship to honor female scientists.

The town was originally the plantation of John Gurley, who came to Madison County from North Carolina in the 1830s. In 1857, the Memphis and Charleston Railroad built its line through the property, and Gurley constructed a water tank to service the line's locomotives. A post office was established in 1866, at which time only a few families lived in the area. The town incorporated in 1890, and the population immediately began to grow. Industry was attracted to the area by its abundance of lumber; many sawmills, producers of wooden barrels, and the Eagle Pencil Company set up shop near the town. Retail establishments were centered on Joplin Street, however a fire in 1923 destroyed most of the structures. Depletion of the area's timber and the greater influence of neighboring Huntsville drew industry away in the 1920s and 1930s, though despite declining population a new Madison County High School was built in 1936. The oldest extant building in the district is the Captain Elijah F. Walker House, built in 1874 by the Civil War veteran who would later serve in the Alabama House of Representatives. The majority of the remaining structures were built between 1891 and 1910; notable among them is the H. A. Smith House, an elaborate Queen Anne house built by a carpenter who would later serve as postmaster. Several other houses exhibit Queen Anne, American Craftsman, and Bungalow details, though most are less decorated folk architectural forms. Two churches in the district, the United Methodist church built in 1891 and the Presbyterian church built in 1912, are Gothic Revival in style. See also: The district was listed on the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage in 1995 and the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.

Treaty of Managua On 28 January 1860, Britain and Nicaragua concluded the treaty of Managua, which transferred to Nicaragua the suzerainty over the entire Caribbean coast from Cabo Gracias a Dios to Greytown but granted autonomy to the Miskito in the more limited Mosquito Reserve (the area described above). King George Augustus Fredric II accepted this change on condition that he should retain his local authority, and receive a yearly subvention of ¬£1000 until 1870. On his death in 1865, Nicaragua refused to recognize his successor, William Henry Clarence. The reserve nevertheless continued to be governed by an elected chief, aided by an administrative council, which met in Bluefields; and the Miskito denied that the suzerainty of Nicaragua connoted any right of interference with their internal affairs. The question was referred for arbitration to the Habsburg emperor of Austria, whose award (published in 1880) upheld the contention of the Indians, and affirmed that the suzerainty of Nicaragua was limited by the Miskitos' right of self-government. Annexation of the Mosquito Reserve In early 1894, Nicaragua invaded the Mosquito Reserve, occupying Bluefields and deposing Prince Robert Henry Clarence, its Hereditary Chief, on 12 February 1894, only to be forced out in July by British and American intervention. When foreign forces withdrew a month later, Nicaragua launched a second invasion, forcibly removing all American and British residents to Managua. After enjoying almost complete autonomy for fourteen years, on 20 November 1894 the Mosquito Reserve formally became incorporated into that of the republic of Nicaragua by Nicaraguan president Jos√© Santos Zelaya. The former Mosquito Coast was established as the Nicaraguan department of Zelaya. British occupation of Corinto When Nicaragua refused to pay Britain an indemnity for the annexation of the Mosquito Reserve, the British responded by occupying the Nicaraguan Pacific port of Corinto on 27 April 1895. Eventually the British left after being paid indemnities by the Nicaraguan government.

Families There are numerous prominent Palestinian families who have contributed to the society, politics and economy of historical Palestine. Usage of the term Palestinian tribe is relatively uncommon and has differed depending on context. One refers to ancient tribes typically described in scriptures and Abrahamic religious texts, such as the Hivites. However, the historicity of such communities is often questioned due to their claimed descent from Noah who is described by some academic references and tertiary sources as being a fictional figure.Article \\"Ark\\" in the 1960 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica More modern groups however are verifiable and include the Khalidi family, the El-Issa family, the al-Husayni clan, the Al-Omari family, the Abu-Ezam family, the Nashashibi clan, the Tuqan clan, the Assali family, the Nusaybah clan, the Qudwa family, Shawish clan, Shurrab family, Al-Zaghab family, Al-Khalil family, Ridwan dynasty, Al-Zeitawi family, Abu Ghosh clan, the Dajani family, Doghmush clan, Douaihy family, Hilles clan, Jarrar clan, Negev Bedouins and the Jayyusi clan.Ottoman Brothers: Muslims, Christians, and Jews in Early Twentieth-Century, Michelle Campos - 2011Journal of Palestine Studies - Volume 15, Issues 3-4 - Page 97, 1986Palestine, Israel, and the Politics of Popular Culture - Page 148, Rebecca L. Stein, Ted Swedenburg - 2005U.S. News & World Report - Volume 129, Issues 9-17 - Page 137 Prominent Palestinian families sometimes assigned specific roles to members of their community. For example, Khalidi and Alami clan members held senior administrative positions in society.The Palestinian People: A History - Page 72, Baruch Kimmerling, Joel S. Migdal - 2009 One of the oldest and biggest families in Palestine is the Barghouti clan who trace their ancestors back over 1000 years with over 2.65 million family members with the majority spread over seven countries. The Barghouti clan claims to have ancestral roots in Spain though this has not been independently confirmed. Genetical tests have proved that the family is closely related to the prophet Mohammad‚Äôs friend Omar Bin Al-khattab which has given them a big role in the politics of Islam . Significant Christians Although Palestinian Christians represent a relatively small minority, many of the most socioeconomically influential families in Palestine have been Christian. The El-Issa family, from Jaffa, are one of the most well known families due to their numerous contributions to Palestinian journalism dating from the late 1800s to the middle of the 20th century. Their first newspaper Al-Asma'i' dates back as early as 1887. Another prominent well-to-do Greek Orthodox family, the Abu-Ezam family, were of the wealthiest business families in Ramla.Palestine, Israel, and the Politics of Popular Culture - Page 148, Rebecca L. Stein, Ted Swedenburg - 2005U.S. News & World Report - Volume 129, Issues 9-17 - Page 137 The Abu-Ezam family owned and operated multiple businesses that ranged from the manufacturing of halva, a sweet confection popular in the Levant, to construction materials.

He represented his nation Nigeria at the 2004 Summer Olympics and produced a remarkable tally of four career medals, including a bronze in the 66-kg division at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, England and a welterweight title at the 2003 All-Africa Games in Abuja. Jessey also trained for his native Bayelsa State's wrestling club under his personal coach Jackson Bidei. Jessey made sporting headlines at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, England, where he grappled his way over New Zealand's Ricardo Aryan to clinch the bronze in the 66-kg division. Following his immediate sporting success, Jessey went on to celebrate a boastful victory for the Nigerians, as he beat Algeria's Farid Hanoun for the gold in the same class at the 2003 All-Africa Games in Abuja. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Jessey qualified for the Nigerian squad, as a lone wrestler, in the men's welterweight class (66 kg). Earlier in the process, he placed sixth at the Olympic Qualification Tournament in Sofia, Bulgaria, but managed to fill up an entry by the International Federation of Association Wrestling through a tripartite invitation. Jessey lost his opening match 1‚Äì3 to South Korea's Baek Jin-kuk, and then lost to Japan's Kazuhiko Ikematsu on a pin with a minute remaining; he was ranked penultimate out of 22 wrestlers in the final standings.

It was the only battle of the Krakow Uprising: a 380-strong rebel unit commanded by Jakub Suchorzewski was defeated by a 480-strong Austrian Army detachment under Ludwig von Benedek. The Austrians were supported by some 500 local peasants (see Galician slaughter). Rebel losses were estimated at 154 killed in action, while Austrian losses were negligible. right  Background  After the Krakow Uprising had begun, an Austrian detachment under Colonel Ludwig von Benedek left Tarn√≥w, heading towards Krakow. Von Benedek had almost 500 men, including 330 infantry and 150 cavalry. Along the way, his unit was reinforced by local peasants from several villages, such as Marszowice, Nieznanowice and Pierzchow. The peasants were promised a hundredweight of salt and 5 Krakow zlotys for each captured rebel.  Battle  Meanwhile, a rebel unit of 380 men (mostly residents of Krakow and local szlachta) under Colonel Jakub Suchorzewski concentrated in Lazany, 8 km southeast of Wieliczka. In the morning of the February 26, insurgents reached Gd√≥w and they scattered around the town seeking food. Boles≈Çaw Limanowski wrote that Suchorzewski didn't expect the Austrians to trace him so quickly and that is why he allowed his soldiers to rest. Whereas, Suchorzewski himself headed to a local manor for a meal, so that he presumably even wasn't in Gd√≥w during the battle. The Austrian troops at first met a few insurgents who were standing on guard over the bridge on Raba. They started shooting to each other but Poles retreated quickly to the centre of Gd√≥w, where they warned the rest of insurgents about the approaching enemy. Those, in most cases drunk, chaotically escaped from inn and houses, crowding in the town centre. Meanwhile von Benedek launched a flanking manoeuvre and surrounded a unit of kosynierzy near the cemetery's wall. They were then attacked by furious peasants and only few were saved by the Austrians who intervened too late. Suchorzewski himself fled to Dobczyce, taking with him rebel money. Altogether, rebel losses were 154: all were buried in three pits, dug at the cemetery. Survivors fled to Krakow, while on the next day the Austrians entered Wieliczka.

It took place in late June 1797 in the regions of Pokucie and Podole, which after the Partitions of Poland became part of Austrian Galicia. Joachim Mokosiej Denisko was born in ca. 1756, in a Polish szlachta family of Volhynia. A Jacobin, he took part in the Kosciuszko Uprising, as a political and military commandant of the County of Krzemieniec. In 1794, he carried out a failed rebel raid on Volhynia, after which he fled to the Ottoman Empire, a traditional enemy of the Russian Empire. While in Turkey, Denisko worked on another rebellion, cooperating with a patriotic organization from Lw√≥w, Centralizacja Lwowska. Centralizacja Lwowska was founded in January 1796 in Krakow, but soon afterwards its office was moved to Lw√≥w. Its members were mainly rich landowners from Austrian and Russian occupied parts of Poland, with bulk of them living in Galicia. Centralizacja also had members in Volhynia and former Grand Duchy of Lithuania: its target was a general insurrection, with support of Turkey and revolutionary France. The organization was commanded by Walerian Dzieduszycki, while Joachim Denisko was one of key members. First Polish military units were organized in Podole, Bucovina and Wallachia in 1795. Polish patriots hoped for an armed conflict between Russia and Turkey (see History of the Russo-Turkish wars), in which they supported the Ottomans. The number of Polish military personnel in northern provinces of the Ottoman Empire was about 1700; their camps were visited by French and English officers. In early March 1797, a group of Polish officers created Zwiazek Wojskowy (Military Association), commanded by Joachim Denisko. An Act of Insurrection was published, in which the abolition of social divisions and serfdom was promised. Walerian Dzieduszycki was named military leader of the rebellion, while Karol Kniaziewicz became its civilian leader, and speaker of the National Assembly. In May 1797, after an internal conflict, Denisko was forced to give up his post. Furthermore, as a result of activities of Russian intelligence services, several members of Centralizacja Lwowska were arrested, including Dzieduszycki. Despite these setbacks, on June 26, Denisko with 200 supporters crossed the Austrian - Turkish border near Zaleszczyki. Four days later, on June 30 after the Battle of Debronowice (the only major battle of the uprising), Austrian forces destroyed the Polish detachment. Some Poles managed to return to Turkey; those captured were hanged on July 11 near Czerniowce. By the end of July, all Polish military camps were destroyed. Denisko himself fled to Turkey. In 1798 he returned to Volhynia, after the Russian government declared an amnesty. He died in 1812 in Saint Petersburg.

He was one of the most prominent photographers in Argentina in the 19th century. During a time, Christiano Junior was associated with British colleague Alexander Witcomb, who would later acquire Junior's studio and photographs, adding them to his own material. In 1970, Witcomb's entire artwork became part of the General Archive of the Nation as an evidence of the history of Argentina registered on photographs.  Biography  Born in Ilha das Flores, Azores Islands, Portugal, he emigrated to Brazil in 1855. It is unclear how Christiano Junior learned the techniques of photography. In 1863 he began its activities in Rio de Janeiro. During that period, the subjects of his photos are mainly slaves and people affected by Lymphatic filariasis. In 1865 he moved to Buenos Aires with his wife and two children, opening his first studio in 1867. It was located in Florida street N¬∞ 150. Soon after, he moved to another building that provided more space. At the beginning of the 1870s, C. Junior opened another studio in Artes street, named \\"Fotograf√≠a de la Infancia\\" (Childhood Photography), hosted by his son Jos√© V. Freitas Henriques. Christiano Junior soon gained reputation in the city, being requested by personalities such as Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, Adolfo Alsina, Lucio V. Mansilla and Luis S√°enz Pe√±a among others. Between 1873 and 1875 he took more than 4,000 photos, with an average of 5 customers per day. Cover to Vistas y Costumbres de la Rep√∫blica Argentina (1876), where Christiano Junior published his work After 1875 Christiano Junior was the official photographer and member of the Sociedad Rural Argentina, even collaborating as a writer. He had a keen interest in agriculture, and as a result of his friendship with many managers of the institution, he was called for the project. During 1876 and 1877 the first volumes of a photo album were released. They were part of a project named Album de vistas y costumbres de la Rep√∫blica Argentina desde el Atl√°ntico a Los Andes, passing through some cities of Argentina and taking photos of each one of them. To make the trip to complete his project, Christiano Junior sold his studio to the Witcomb & Mackern society (predecessor or famous Casa Witcomb) in 1878. After leaving Buenos Aires, he went on an \\"artistic tour\\" (in his own words) visiting the Santa Fe, C√≥rdoba, Mendoza, San Luis, San Juan, Santiago del Estero, Catamarca, Tucum√°n, Salta and Jujuy provinces. The trip took 4 years. Nevertheless, the project was not concluded, so in 1883, the artist ceased his activity as a photographer. Even unfinished, the work made by Christiano Junior during those 4 years is considered one of the most important and ambitious projects in Argentine and Latin America. Christiano Junior died in Asunci√≥n, Paraguay, in 1902.

Kiwerski was killed in action on April 18, 1944, during Operation Tempest during World War II. Kiwerski was born on May 23, 1910 in Krak√≥w. His father was Wladyslaw Kiwerski, a physician, and his mother was Maria Jadwiga n√©e Rogalska. By the age of 14, Kiwerski was an orphan, and in September 1923, he was accepted into Military Cadet School Nr. 2, graduating with honors in June 1928. Since he was among top graduates, Kiwerski had the right to make a choice about his further military career: he decided to join the sappers. In June 1928, Kiwerski entered the School of Military Engineers in Warsaw. In August 1931 he graduated, and as a podporucznik (Second Lieutenant) he began service as platoon commandant at 3rd Sapper Battalion in Wilno. On March 19, 1933, Kiwerski was promoted to the rank of Poruchik (Lieutenant). In November 1934, Kiwerski was transferred to Bridge Battalion at the Modlin Fortress. In July 1937, he was called to Wyzsza Szkola Wojenna (Higher War School). On March 19, 1939 he was promoted to the rank of Captain, and on August 18, two weeks before German Invasion of Poland, Kiwerski graduated from Higher War School. On August 20, 1939, Kiwerski was sent to Grodno, where he was named operating officer of the 33rd Infantry Division. Later, as an officer of the Independent Operational Group Polesie, he fought in the region of Polesie. After the Battle of Kock, General Franciszek Kleeberg allowed those soldiers who wanted to escape German captivity to disappear. Kiwerski took advantage of this, reaching Warsaw in November 1939. Soon afterwards, he became one of key members of Service for Poland's Victory. Since 1942, he commanded a sabotage unit of the Kedyw, using noms de guerre Ziomek, Rudzki, Kalinowski, Lipinski and Dyrektor. In November 1942 he was promoted a major. In December 1943, the Home Army headquarters sent him to Volhynia, where Ukrainian nationalists had been murdering Polish civilians (see Massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia). Kiwerski was named chief of staff of Volhynian Home Army. In February 1944, he was named commandant of the Home Army in the province, and commandant of the 27th Home Army Infantry Division.

Crosby was the son of Ernest Howard Crosby, a noted author and reformer who served in the seat in the New York State Legislature formerly held by Theodore Roosevelt. Crosby was also a nephew of Eugene Schieffelin, the bird enthusiast who introduced the starling to the U.S.Maunsell Schieffelin Crosby (1887-1931) The 1933 book The Birds of Dutchess County by Ludlow Griscom based much of its information on records compiled by Crosby. Early life and education Crosby was born to Ernest Howard Crosby and Fanny Kendall Schieffelin Crosby in New York City on February 14, 1887. He graduated from Morristown School (now Morristown-Beard School) in Morristown, New Jersey in 1904. During his three years of study at Morristown School (1901-1904), Crosby grew his interest in ornithology. In 1915, he published an article titled \\"Some Notes from Morristown, N. J.\\" in The Oriole, a magazine published by the Somerset Hills Bird Club in Somerset Hills, New Jersey. The article describes his experiences observing birds as a youth. In 1908, Crosby completed his bachelor's degree at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1908. While studying at the school, he ran for the Harvard Crimson's cross country team. Following his graduation from the school, Crosby went on a three-month overseas trip to Western Europe. He traveled through the countries of England, France, the Netherlands, Germany, and Austria-Hungary (now the countries of Austria and Hungary). Crosby and noted poet John Hall Wheelock were classmates at both Morristown School and Harvard; Wheelock and Crosby roomed together during their sophomore year at Harvard. Wheelock later served as the best man at Crosby's wedding. Birding expeditions Crosby made several expeditions to Central America and South America for the Museum of Natural History in New York City. In 1921, he traveled on an expedition to Panama with Ludlow Griscom that brought back about 500 species of birds. Many of these species had been previously unknown to scientists in the United States. Dutchess County farm Returning from his overseas trip to Europe, Crosby took over management of Grasmere, the family farm. His mother Fanny had operated Grasmere for 15 years after purchasing it from Margaret Livingston Lee. Crosby raised livestock, including Jersey cattle, Brown Swiss cattle, Holstein Friesian cattle, hogs, chickens, turkeys, and ducks. He also grew apples, pears, potatoes, beans, and other crops. In 1987, Grasmere received a placement on the National Register of Historic Places. The property, which dates from the 18th Century, one served as the birthplace of William Alexander Duer, president of Columbia College (now Columbia University). Military and government service Crosby worked at the Division of Forests at the New York State Conservation Commission (now the Department of Environmental Conservation) from 1912 to 1913. In 1912, he joined the 10th New York Infantry Division as a second lieutenant. Crosby received promotions to first lieutenant in 1914 and captain in the Quartermaster Corps on 1917. Later that year, he entered into federal military service with an assignment to the New York State Arsenal. Crosby transferred to Camp Mills in August 1917. While serving in the military, Crosby received an appointment to serve as an aide to Governor Charles S. Whitman. He served in that role from 1915 to 1917. Historical legacy Crosby developed a close friendship with Franklin Roosevelt during their days in Hyde Park, New York; They were neighbors who shared a common interest in ornithology. The Hudson River Valley and Dutchess County Manuscript Collection at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum houses many of Crosby's writings. The collection includes his birdwatching records, his scratch list of birds observed, and his six volume birding diary.Franklin D. Roosevelt, Hudson River Valley and Dutchess County Manuscript Collection, 1540-1952 The ornithology collection at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. contains a black and white photograph of Crosby. Crosby also developed a friendship with noted artist John Butler Yeats. Writer and historian Van Wyck Brooks, a mutual friend, introduced them. Yeats sketched Crosby and his wife and spent time with them in Rhinebeck. Crosby's granddaughter, Susan Schieffelin McCabe Gillotti, wrote an extensive history on Crosby, their family, and their relationships with Wheelock and the Roosevelts.Looking Beneath the Surface of Things: Norwich Couple's Two New Books Examine Lives and Institutions With Secrets Accessed April 15, 2018 Family Crosby married Elizabeth Coolidge on June 11, 1908 during his senior year at Harvard.

Baldwin's entire career playing for team on the West Coast of the United States, mostly in the Pacific Coast League (PCL). His career began in the Northwestern League in 1916. Baldwin broke into the PCL in 1917 after being traded to the Portland Beavers. His baseball career took a hiatus during the 1918 season during his service in the 91st Division of the United States Army during World War I. He returned to baseball in 1919 and played in the PCL for the next 11 seasons. During that time he played for the San Francisco Seals (1919, 1931), the Seattle Indians (1920, 1924‚Äì26), the Los Angeles Angels (1921‚Äì23) and the Mission Bells/Reds (1927‚Äì30). Professional career =Northwestern League and Portland Beavers (1916‚Äì17)= Under the recommendation of former player Jim Byrnes the Vancouver Beavers of the Northwestern League (NWL) invited Baldwin to try out for the club but was not offered a contract. Instead Baldwin signed with the Tacoma Tigers. He finished the season with a .242 batting average with 39 hits in 161 at bats. Before start of the 1917 season, Baldwin negotiated his way out of his contract with Tacoma. After he became a free agent, the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League offered him a contact. However, Baldwin signed with the NWL Spokane Indians. In early June Baldwin was traded to the Portland Beavers in exchange for Bill Stumpf and Gus Helfrich. Baldwin's batting average with Spokane was .302 with two home runs. Baldwin arrived in Portland on June 10. Roscoe Fawcett, the sports editor of The Oregonian, wrote on June 24 that, \\"'Red' Baldwin behind the bat doesn't seem to be able to hit a lick. He is a nifty receiver, but helpless on offense\\". With Portland that season, Baldwin batted .219 with five doubles and two triples. =Military service and semi- pro baseball (1917‚Äì18)= After the 1917 season Baldwin signed with a winter league club based out of San Francisco, California named \\"Maxwell\\". He also played for a semi-professional team named the Oakland Native Sons. In October 1917 Baldwin was drafted to serve in World War I as a member of the United States Armed Forces. Baldwin did not claim exemptions to his draft. In November, Baldwin was informed to report to Camp Lewis near Tacoma, Washington. He wrote The Oregonian in December and said he was not sure where he would be deployed, but thought it would likely be France or Italy. As a member of the 91st Division, Baldwin served in France during the Battle of Saint-Mihiel and the Meuse-Argonne Offensive from 1917 to 1918. Following the 1918 season, the New York Yankees selected Baldwin in the rule 5 draft, but he was unable to report to the team due to his service in World War I. The Portland Beavers's owner Judge McCredie claimed the Yankees failed to pay the arranged draft price for Baldwin, who was still under contract with the Beavers while serving in the U.S. Armed Forces. The case was reviewed by the National Commission and eventually the Yankees were allowed to sign Baldwin. =Pacific Coast League journeyman (1919‚Äì31)= After returning home from service in World War I, Baldwin reported to the New York Yankees spring training camp at the start of the 1919 season. However, he was cut from the roster before the start of the regular season and signed with the San Francisco Seals of the PCL. He played 82 games for the Seals and finished with a .217 batting average with 11 doubles, one triple and two home runs. Before the 1920 season Baldwin was negotiating to re-sign with the San Francisco Seals, but they did not reach an agreement. The Seattle Indians offered Baldwin $500 a month, which he accepted. On the season, Baldwin appeared in 108 games and batted .240 with 12 doubles and two triples. Baldwin requested another $500 a month contract from the Seattle Indians, which they declined instead offering him $400 a month. He eventually signed with Seattle for an undisclosed amount. Baldwin was traded to the Los Angeles Angels before the start of the 1921 season in exchange for Curly Brown. Baldwin was the team's first string catcher that season. He played 108 games that season and batted .266 with 18 doubles, six triples and one home run. In his second season with the Angels, Baldwin appeared in 91 games and batted in .293 with 90 hits, 18 doubles and two home runs. Baldwin played his final season with Los Angeles in 1923. He appeared in 101 games with 32 doubles and two home runs. Following the 1923 season Los Angeles sold Baldwin to the Seattle Indians. During the 1924 season, he batted .282 with 31 doubles, 10 triples and 10 home runs. His double and home run totals were a career high. In 1925 Baldwin batted .269 with 16 doubles, one triple and six home runs. Baldwin's batting statistics for 1926 are not available. The Seattle Indians sold Baldwin to the Mission Bells in exchange for $3,000. In his first season for Mission, Baldwin did not make a plate appearance. He played in 17 games on defense. In 1928 he appeared in 118 games and finished with a .277 with 18 double, one triple and three home runs. His final season with Mission was in 1930. That year he batted .247 with 10 double, one triple and three home runs. Baldwin signed with the San Francisco Seals in 1931. His contract stipulated that Baldwin would be paid for the entire season, regardless how much he played. He played 65 games with eight doubles and two triples in what would be his final season in professional baseball. =Relatives= Baldwin's brother-in-law was William Lawrence Plummer, who played with Baldwin from 1924 to 1925 on the Seattle Indians. His nephew, Bill Plummer, was a major league catcher from 1968 to 1978, and pro baseball manager and coach from 1980 to 2017 with the Seattle Mariners, Colorado Rockies, Detroit Tigers, Cincinnati Reds, and Arizona Diamondbacks organizations as well as the independent Chico Heat and Yuma Bullfrogs.

Originally formed in 1884 as the Waterbury Horse Railroad Company, which began service in 1886.

Connecticut Lighting and Power Company bought out Waterbury Traction Company in June 1899. The name of the new consolidated company was changed to Connecticut Railway and Lighting Company in 1901. In 1906, the streetcar lines were leased to the Consolidated Railway, which later became the Connecticut Company, a subsidiary of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. Connecticut Company (1906-1936) By 1908, it was possible to travel by trolley from Waterbury to Thomaston, Naugatuck. Derby, and New Haven. Increased competition from improved roads and more affordable automobiles began to take its toll on the trolley lines. The interurban route to Thomaston was abandoned in 1929, and was not converted to bus operation. Independent operation resumed in 1936 when Connecticut Company was no longer able to maintain lease payments due to parent New Haven entering receivership. From trolley to bus (1936-1973) Connecticut Railway and Lighting company resumed operation of the former Waterbury Traction lines in 1936. All local streetcar operations in Waterbury ended on May 22, 1937, and the route to New Haven closed a month later. Connecticut Railway and Lighting Company bus operation continued over many of the same routes for years.

The hut was brought from Sacramento and set up at its current location on California State Route 49 in Nevada City. Eventually, he sold the bar to two locals named Smitty and Smokey. It was then bought by Peggy and Bob Tucker in 1963. They named it Tuck's Hut. They expanded it to have a grill and served hamburgers. It was then leased to Frank Williams in 1969. Williams named it The Willo, which is a blend of his last name and Lola, his wife's given name. The restaurant was expanded to its current size by Williams and Veda Folden, who partnered to create the steakhouse. It was bought in 1976 by Ken and Jeannie Hiebert. Around 2003, the restaurant was purchased by real estate brokers Mike Byrne and Nancy Wilson. They wanted to purchase a business in the area and decided to buy the Willo. The restaurant averages 150 dinners a night on the weekends. The Willo claims to have sold over one million steaks since the restaurant opened. Cuisine A ribeye steak, beans and iceberg lettuce at the Willo. The Willo is a steakhouse. The house speciality is a strip steak.

The News & Review called the Willo one of the \\"few bastions of culinary Americana,\\" and the reviewer acknowledges that they were surprised to see that they still serve Catalina dressing and that the martini glasses are smaller than most used today. 7x7 calls it a dive bar and called the bartender \\"surly\\".

Barbaree typology According to Howard Barbaree, a psychologist at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, most rapes are impulsive and opportunistic, and committed by people who may commit other impulsive acts, including impulsive crimes. These rapists tend to show no anger except in response to their victim's resistance, and use little unnecessary force. Then there are rapists who are preoccupied with a fixed sexual fantasy, which they try to act out in the rape, such as a fantasy in which they force a victim to have sex, and they then fall in love with them. These are the least aggressive of rapists, and are the most likely to flee if the victim puts up a strong resistance. Then there are vindictive rapists whose assaults are physically harmful and whose intent is clearly to degrade and humiliate the victim. Then there are rapists whose compelling motive is anger at the world at large; these are likely to inflict the most physical damage on their victims. These rapists tend to have a long history of violent crime of all sorts. Then there are sexual sadists, who enjoy the victim's fear.  Groth typology  Nicholas Groth has described three types of rape based on the goal of the rapist. = Power rapist = thumb Amna Sur Museum in Sulaymaniyah. A replica of a Kurdish girl in prison. The girl was imprisoned at a young age. She was repeatedly beaten and raped by the guards in the prison. For these rapists, rape becomes a way to compensate for their underlying feelings of inadequacy and feeds their issues of mastery, control, strength, authority and capability. The intent of the power rapist is to assert their competency. The power rapist relies upon verbal threats, intimidation with a weapon, and uses only the amount of force necessary to subdue the victim. The power rapist tends to have fantasies about rape and sexual conquests. They may believe that even though the victim initially resists them, that once they overpower their victim, the victim will eventually enjoy the rape. The rapist needs to believe that the victim enjoyed what was done to them, and they may even ask the victim to meet them for a date later. Because this is only a fantasy, the rapist does not feel reassured for long by either their own performance or the victim's response. The rapist feels that they must find another victim, convinced that this victim will be \\"the right one.\\" Hence, their offenses may become repetitive and compulsive. They may commit a series of rapes over a short period of time. This is the most common type of serial rapist of strangers in the United States.Types of Rapists from HopeforHealing.org = Anger rapist = The aim of this rapist is to humiliate, debase, and hurt their victim; they express their contempt for their victim through physical violence and profane language. For these rapists, sex is a weapon to defile and degrade the victim, rape constitutes the ultimate expression of their anger. This rapist considers rape the ultimate offense they can commit against the victim. Anger rape is characterized by physical brutality, much more physical force is used during the assault than would be necessary if the intent were simply to overpower the victim and achieve penetration. This type of offender attacks their victim by grabbing, striking and knocking the victim to the ground, beating them, tearing their clothes, and raping them. The experience for the offender is one that is of conscious anger and rage. = Sadistic rapist = For these rapists, there is a sexual association with various concepts, so that aggression and the infliction of pain is eroticized. For this rapist, sexual excitement is associated with the causing of suffering upon their victim. The offender finds the intentional maltreatment of their victim intensely gratifying and takes pleasure in the victim's torment, anguish, distress, helplessness, and suffering; the offender finds the victim's struggling an erotic experience. Sadistic rape usually involves extensive, prolonged torture and restraint. Sometimes, it can take on ritualistic or other bizarre qualities. The rapist may use some type of instrument or a foreign object to penetrate their victim. Sexual areas of the victim's body become a specific focus of injury or abuse. The sadistic rapist's assaults are calculated. They will often wear a disguise or will blindfold their victims. Prostitutes or other individuals whom they perceive to be \\"promiscuous\\" are often the sadistic rapist's targets. The victims of a sadistic rapist may not survive the attack. For some offenders, the ultimate satisfaction is gained from murdering the victim.  Sexual Gratification rapist  According to Shannon M. Barton-Bellessa, one type of rapist is the sexual gratification rapist. For this rapist, the motivation is to obtain sex. Such an offender may otherwise be lonely and may have difficulty obtaining an outlet for their sexual desires in other ways due to being unsuccessful at courtship.

During the preliminary competition, Zakhartdinov lost his opening match 4‚Äì1 to Russia's Murad Ramazanov, but bounced back to subdue Turkey's Harun Doƒüan (3‚Äì0) and pin Moldova's Octavian Cuciuc with only thirty seconds left. Zakhartdinov placed first during the preliminary competition based on technical points, reached the semifinals, but fell behind Ukraine's Yevhen Buslovych in overtime with a 2‚Äì0 decision. Zakhartdinov faced U.S. wrestler Terry Brands in the bronze medal match, but could not throw him down the mat and missed the podium by a single point to close the record 3‚Äì2, finishing only in fourth place. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Zakhartdinov qualified for his third Uzbek squad, as a 28-year-old, in the men's 60 kg class. Weighing at two kilograms heavier than the previous Games, Zakhartdinov received a berth and rounded out the ninth spot in the lightweight category from the 2003 World Wrestling Championships in New York City, New York, United States. He started the preliminary competition with a surprising 3‚Äì2 victory over Japan's Kenji Inoue, before being overwhelmed by Austria's Lubos Cikel in a 5‚Äì6 verdict and South Korea's Jung Young-ho on a marvelous technical fall. Placing last in the preliminary competition and ninth overall, Zakhartdinov failed to advance to the quarterfinals. Zakhartdinov also competed in two editions of the Asian Games (2002 and 2006), but fell behind the medal podium. Shortly after his sporting career ended in 2006, he moved to the United States to work with Rod Gaddy and coach young wrestlers for the Alabama State Wrestling Team in Birmingham, Alabama.

The program airs each Tuesday night at 8pm AEST. Its current co-hosts are Alan Jones and Peta Credlin, while previous co-hosts alongside Jones include Graham Richardson and Mark Latham. The series focuses on mainly political topics. The program usually beings with the duo interviewing a prominent politician or political commentator. In the final segment of the show, Richo and Credlin discuss a variety of topics between themselves. Background The program is a spin-off of the Richo program which premiered 23 February three years earlier and is hosted solely by Richardson. It was originally titled Richo + Jones and co- hosted by Graham Richardson and Alan Jones when it premiered in February 2014, but due to Richardson's ill health, Mark Latham replaced him as co-host in 2016 (at Jones' suggestion), and the program was re-titled to its current name. Management declined to simply retitle the show Jones and Latham because they were concerned Latham was \\"too much of a risk\\" as host and instead used the more general name Jones & Co. Latham's employment was terminated by Sky News on 29 March 2017 following several controversial statements made on the program and his other program Outsiders with his last appearance on 21 March 2017. In May 2017, Peta Credlin was named the new co-host of the program. From 25 November 2014 the show was simulcast on radio 2GB alongside the Sky News broadcast, however this has since been discontinued. = Guest hosts = Title card used for Richo + Jones (2014-2016) For a few weeks in July 2014 while Jones was commentating the 2014 Commonwealth Games for another network, Peter Reith filled in for Jones on the program, however it was still referred to on air as Richo + Jones. Jones hosted the program solo on September 23, 2014 when Richo was absent for an unspecified health reason. On September 30 and October 7, 2014, Kristina Keneally filled in for Richo while he was on holidays, and the show was also referred to as Jones + Keneally in some promos during this period.https://twitter.com/KKeneally/status/516738223645544448 Frequently throughout 2015, Jones hosted the program alone due to Richo's ill health and associated cancer treatments. The program was referred to as Jones + Beattie when Peter Beattie filled in for Richo on June 23, 2015.https://twitter.com/SmartState1/status/613256632508657664 From April 2016, the program was retitled as Jones + Co due to Richardson being absent while undergoing major surgery, with Mark Latham among those guest co-hosting with Jones. Reception The highest rating episode of the season (as of September 2014) was on 21 August 2013, which reached 55,000 viewers. The episode on 22 April 2014 was the twentieth most watched show on subscription television reaching 39,000 viewers and was the channel's second highest broadcast that day.

Active since 2010, the website is created and maintained by Cherokee Nation scholar Adrienne Keene. Subjects Some of the most frequently discussed topics on the blog are \\"hipster headdresses\\", the Native American mascot controversy and appropriation and misrepresentations of Native American cultures in Hollywood movies. Targets of critique include the Washington Redskins use of an ethnic slur as the name for their football team, The Lone Ranger movie remake, misrepresentations of Native American spiritual beliefs in the work of author J.

Though much of the blog's commentary is critical, it is not exclusively so: Nelly Furtado, for example, has been praised for her respectful engagement with Native hoop and shawl dancers. Coverage and influence Keene observes that Native Americans are barely represented in mainstream media, and journalists often turn to non- Native sources, rather than to Natives themselves, on the rare occasions when they do cover Native issues. However, the increasing popularity of her blog and appearance on other social media such as Twitter has made her a widely quoted expert on matters to do with appropriations, with mentions in the BBC, NPR, The Guardian, the Phoenix New Times, Al Jazeera, Time magazine and other major news outlets. The Guardian has credited her with leading a successful campaign against stereotypical imagery created by Paul Frank Industries: the company later invited Keene and other experts to help design new product lines working with native artists.

The film is about friendship and two friends. The film stars Manoj Joshi, Darshan Jariwala, Divyang Thakkar, Pratik Gandhi, Amit Mistry, Samvedna Suwalka. The film was released on 29 August 2014, to positive reviews and became a box-office success. It completed 50 weeks in theatres. The film was screened at New York Indian Film Festival, becoming the first ever Gujarati film hosted by the festival. Plot Childhood friends Chintan \\"Chako\\" (Divyang Thakkar) and Tapan \\"Tino\\" (Pratik Gandhi) aspire to invest in a real estate project called The Other Side, located near the scenic Nal Savorar area and their residence of Ahmedabad. They currently work as MRs while hoping to make quick money through a Godman who promises to triple their profit. The Godman turns out to be part of a larger con and his scheme is discovered by the police. As a result, Chako and Tino are scammed out of ‚Çπ1,80,000 (or 180,000 rupees). Chako's father, Jeetu (Darshan Jariwala), runs a small local tea stall, in which hangs a painting from a prominent artist named M.F. Hassan (based on the late M.F. Husain). The piece was gifted to Jeetu as a sign of their close friendship, before Hassan's rise to prominence and eventual death. Upon learning that Jeetu's tea stall painting is highly coveted, Tino comes up with another idea to secure an investment with The Other Side: secretly replace the painting with an identical fake one, and then loan the original for cash. Initially hesitant but desperate, Chako assists in the plan along with their friend Uday (Kavin Dave), an avid painter who begrudgingly agrees to compose an exact copy of the piece himself. With the switch successful, Chako and Tino mortgage the original painting to a local art dealer, Y.B. Gandhi (Manoj Joshi). Shortly thereafter, however, Gandhi informs Chako that the painting he received is fake and that someone else had tried to sell the same painting to another dealer. Gandhi convinces Chako that either Tino had double-crossed him, or that his father had been lying about the painting's authenticity. Chako returns the money back to Gandhi, and angrily confronts Tino, who indeed went to a separate dealer, but was sent by Uday for an art survey only. Chako then meets his father and accuses him of confabulating a friendship. Angered by the accusations and hurt by Chako's loss of the painting, Jeetu kicks him out of the house. The M.F. Hassan painting, however, was an original all along, and Gandhi - whom Hassan hated and never lent his work to - had cheated Chako and Tino out of the painting. Gandhi then publicly humiliates Jeetu by telling the press he never had a friendship with Hassan, and that the stories of him making his paintings at the tea stall are all false. Hoping to redeem themselves, Chako and Tino devise a plan to take advantage of Gandhi's own greed in order to get the painting back for Jeetu. Helping with the elaborate scheme include Uday and Jigisha (Samvedna Suwalka), Tino's girlfriend. They hire a method actor named Pranav (Amit Mistry) to pose as \\"Prabodh Gupta\\", a fictitious international artist from Bihar whose work has yet to be exhibited in India. The group successfully lures Gandhi into funding a fabricated NGO and conducting Prabodh's supposed lucrative first exhibition in India, in exchange for the tea stall painting. Pranav and Uday narrowly retrieve the painting on the day of the held exhibition, just as Gandhi realizes that Prabodh is a fraud. He confronts the place of the fake NGO but encounters Chako, Tino, and Jeetu. Chako and Tino demand that he publicly retract his earlier statements about Jeetu, or else be arrested for selling fake paintings and creating the fictitious \\"Prabodh Gupta\\" himself (since Gandhi was tricked earlier into funding the fake NGO). Realizing his defeat, Gandhi tries to offer money, but Jeetu declines and chastises him for his greed being the reason Hassan never worked with large art curators. Gandhi holds a televised news conference the next morning, apologizing for his previous accusations against Jeetu. Hassan's piece is returned to Jeetu's shop, after he and Chako fully reconcile. Uday, whose own paintings were used as Prabodh's work from earlier, is offered his own local exhibition, attended by much happier Chako and Tino.

Jain also took inspiration from K.H. Mohammad, who was the owner of a real life Ahmedabad tea stall, then-named Lucky Tea Stall, and had a painting gifted to him by the late Indian artist M.F. Husain, a close friend and regular customer of the stall. According to the restaurant's current manager, Siddiqui Ansari, Husain had personally presented the painting in 2004 to Mohammad, now deceased. Similar to the film's character Jeetu, as a promise to both Mohammad and Husain, Ansari and original co-partner Kutti Nayar have refused to sell the painting that still hangs in what is now called Lucky Restaurant. =Casting= Announcing the cast, Abhishek Jain mentioned that the writer of OMG ‚Äì Oh My God! and national award winner, Bhavesh Mandalia will be co-writing the film and composer duo Sachin‚ÄìJigar will compose the music for the film.

Several notable Gujaratis appeared as cameos in the film, including columnist Jay Vasavada, author Tushar Shukla, actor Archan Trivedi, art promoter Sonal Ambani and critic S.D. Desai. =Filming= The film was shot in Ahmedabad, specifically at 50 different locations in 35 days. Talking about filming locations, Abhishek Jain said, \\"We have shot in the most rustic locales of Ahmedabad to bring out the real essence of the city in every scene.\\" In March 2014, it was announced that the film is almost ready. To help with keeping the film's principal photography organized, Jain revealed in an interview that he had 10 assistants for Bey Yaar. He wanted to narrow his responsibilities towards directing, a desire which inspired him to also hire fellow Whistling Woods International film school alum Amit Desai, who serves as the movie's Creative/Executive Producer. In an interview with his Alma mater, Desai said that all business-related and marketing choices for Bey Yaar were ultimately decided by him. Soundtrack Music for the film is composed by Sachin‚ÄìJigar. The director Abhishek Jain said, about the music of the film, \\"With Bey Yaar's music we are trying to create a friendship anthem\\" Music review site Milliblog reviewed the soundtrack as \\"short but competent affair\\".

History Lone Buffalo was started in 2007 by the Maddux family in Auburn, California. They owned a one-acre vineyard. Phil Maddux, who is the winemaker and works as a real estate lawyer, is originally from Sonoma County, California. He has studied oenology at Sonoma State University and University of California, Davis. He started making wine in 1971. He has worked under Dirk Arrowood and Cecil DeLoach. He also made his own home wine prior to opening his own winery. Maddux's wife, Jill, handles the sales, accounting, and also assists with their property management. The couples daughter, Jocelyn, is in charge of public relations. They all work in the tasting room. The name for the winery came from Phil Maddux's fascination with the American bison. He believes that the comeback of the American bison from near extinction is similar to the comeback that the Sierra Foothills region is attempting to make after its decline in economic success after the Prohibition closed many wineries in the area. The bison is depicted on the wine labels and the wine names have an American West theme. They also make a brand titled \\"jbrand\\" which is co-created by Phil and Jocelyn. It is an attempt to make wine of interest to younger consumers. It took the company three years before they brought in a profit. The majority of their sales come from tasting room visits, online sales, and wine club memberships. They also distribute their wine to regional restaurants and businesses. In January 2013, Lone Buffalo opened a new tasting room northwest of Auburn. It took them three years to find and acquire the property. The new property and facility is larger than the previous, with 12 acres. The facility is 2,400 square feet in size and is modeled after a ranch. The new location allowed them to crush their grapes and complete the entire winemaking process in the same place, unlike the previous building. It is located in the Sierra Foothills AVA and is part of the Placer County Wine Trail. Wine production They produce approximately 1,200 bottles per year, as of 2013. One-third of the wine they produce is estate grown. Estate grown grapes include zinfandel and petit syrah. The rest of the grapes they source come throughout Placer County. Their most widely distributed wine is a Rh√¥ne wine called \\"Where the Buffalo Roam.\\" It is a blend of grenache, mourvedre, and syrah. They also make a port wine called \\"Pawnee Tawny\\" which is made of grapes from Madera County, California. The jbrand is small production and consists grenache, syrah and pinot grigio wines.

He made his professional debut in May 2007. He took the second division j≈´ry≈ç championship in his third tournament in the division in January 2014 and was promoted to the top makuuchi division in the following tournament. His highest rank has been maegashira 5 East. He is the older brother of fellow professional sumo wrestler Chiyo≈çtori, and has served as his younger brother's attendant or tsukebito. Early life and sumo background The future Chiyomaru was born in what is now Shibushi city in Kagoshima prefecture. During his primary and middle school years he practiced judo rather than sumo. Upon graduating from a junior high school in Shibushi, he joined Kokonoe stable. His year and a half younger brother, Y≈´ki, would follow him into this stable a year later. Career He first entered the professional sumo ring in July 2007. He slowly worked his way up the ranks, and after two years and two months in the ring his shikona (ring name) was changed to Chiyomaru following the Kokonoe stable custom of giving wrestlers a ring name that starts with Chiyo upon promotion to the sandanme division. Chiyomaru was judged by his appearance of his big, round belly when given the shikona of Chiyomaru which literally means ‚ÄòEternally round‚Äô in Japanese. It would take him over four years rising slowly through the lower divisions before reaching the professional ranks of j≈´ry≈ç. During this time, in 2011 he and his brother's family home was lost in a fire and they agreed building their parents a new house could be motivation for them to achieve more success in sumo. Chiyomaru's coach, the former Chiyonofuji remarked that before his brother overtook him he lacked motivation and disliked training, and in many ways it was being passed up by his own brother that spurred him on to improve his sumo. To add insult to injury, when Chiyomaru's younger brother became a sekitori (a salaried wrestler) and in need of an attendant, his coach chose Chiyomaru in hopes of motivating him to try harder to make the professional ranks and divest himself of this role. Chiyomaru admits that the indignity of being his own brother's attendant did motivate him and he might not have achieved promotion if this hadn't happened. In July 2013 with a 4‚Äì3 record at makushita 1, he finally achieved promotion to j≈´ry≈ç for the following tournament. When he made his j≈´ry≈ç debut in September 2013 his brother, Chiyo≈çtori was already in the division, marking the 17th time in history that two brothers were in the professional ranks at the same time. He only managed a 7‚Äì8 losing record in his j≈´ry≈ç debut, but followed this with an impressive November tournament, winning 8 of his first 9 bouts and ending with an 11‚Äì4 record. In the January 2014 tournament, his success continued, and from the rank of j≈´ry≈ç 6 he logged in a 13‚Äì2 record and the championship. Coincidentally, this was the tournament immediately after his younger brother also won the j≈´ry≈ç division with a 13‚Äì2 record. This was the first time in history two brothers had achieved consecutive championships.> Chiyomaru's promotion to the top makuuchi division in March 2014 followed his brother's ascension by one tournament and marked the tenth time in history two brothers had been in the highest division at the same time. At an event celebrating his promotion he expressed his incredulity at this turn of events and surmised that perhaps even the two brothers sharing the rank of ≈çzeki in the future was not out of the range of possibility. In his debut at this level, he defeated several makuuchi veterans and accumulated an 8‚Äì4 record on the 12th day before losing his last three bouts to end at 8‚Äì7. In the following May tournament he was promoted to maegashira 11, his highest rank to date. He struggled however, losing to a number of wrestlers he had beaten in the previous tournament and logged in only a 5‚Äì10 record. This was still enough for him to remain in the top division for the July 2014 tournament. Though he won his first five matches he started to struggle somewhat afterwards, still managing to end the tournament with an 8‚Äì7 winning record. After the May 2015 tournament Chiyomaru fell back to the j≈´ry≈ç division after scoring only three wins against twelve losses. He had to withdraw partway through the September 2015 tournament (with a sprained right acromioclavicular joint) and the January 2016 tournament (due to a knee injury). After a 12 tournament absence he returned to the top division for the July 2017 tournament. In March 2018 he reached his highest rank to date of maegashira 5, but five consecutive make-koshi or losing records saw him relegated to the j≈´ry≈ç division after the November 2018 tournament. After two straight 10‚Äì5 records in January and March 2019 he was promoted back to the top division for the May 2019 tournament in which he got a 7-8 record and got a 5-10 record in the July tournament which saw him drop down to East jury≈ç 1 in the following September Tournament. He ended that tournament with an 8-7 score losing to Ichiyamamoto on the final day, which was enough to ensure he was promoted back to the top division for the next tournament. In November he recorded a 9-6 score, losing to Shimanoumi on the final day preventing him from achieving double digit wins for his first time in the top division. He withdrew from the March 2020 tournament in Osaka, held without spectators due to the coronavirus outbreak, with a fever on Day 8. He agreed to a test for the coronavirus after his temperature was recorded at above 37.5C for two straight days, although it was suspected that the cause is a skin infection. On Day 10 of the tournament, Chiyomaru's test results came back as negative for the novel coronavirus.NHK: Â§ßÁõ∏Êí≤ Âπ≥Âπï ÂçÉ‰ª£‰∏∏ Êñ∞Âûã„Ç¶„Ç§„É´„ÇπÊ§úÊüª„ÅØÈô∞ÊÄß Êò•Â†¥ÊâÄ„ÅØÁ∂ôÁ∂ö Fighting style Chiyomaru relies heavily on pushing and thrusting techniques, or oshi- sumo, but is also very commonly seen winning by the hataki-komi slap down technique. His most common winning kimarite are oshi-dashi (push out), hiki- otoshi (pull down) and hataki-komi (slap down). He is at a disadvantage if his opponent manages to grab his mawashi or belt. Away from the dohyo Chiyomaru is known for his cherub-like looks and is popular with female sumo fans or \\"rikijo.\\" In 2014, a photo of him taking a nap, which was posted on the Japan Sumo Association's official Twitter account, became an internet hit. In March 2015 he shook hands with Derek Jeter who was visiting the Osaka tournament, but admitted not knowing who the retired Yankees star was.

Shepherd had a number of views that were criticized as being contrary to the Westminster Standards, and this led him to be dismissed from his post at Westminster.Guy Prentiss Waters, \\"The Theology of Norman Shepherd: A Study in Development, 1963-2006,\\" in The Hope Fulfilled: Essays in Honor of O. Palmer Robertson, pp. 225-226. Firstly, Shepherd argued that evangelism should be carried out with covenant in mind rather than election, which will lead the evangelist to say to people, \\"Christ died to save you.\\" This was criticized as being a denial of limited atonement.Waters, \\"Theology of Norman Shepherd,\\" p. 218. Secondly, Shepherd spoke of Christians being justified by \\"obedient faith,\\" a phrase that was criticized as denying justification by faith alone.Waters, \\"Theology of Norman Shepherd,\\" p. 222. On May 4, 1976, the faculty of Westminster Theological Seminary requested that Shepherd produce a written statement detailing his view of the doctrine of justification sola fide, due to concerns that his teaching on the subject might be out of accord with the Westminster Standards. The controversy over Shepherd's views gradually spread from the seminary to the broader Reformed theological community. Shepherd was repeatedly exonerated by the faculty and board of trustees during their investigation of his views.Hewitson, Trust and Obey, p. 19. On November 21, 1981, the board of trustees dismissed Shepherd from his teaching post, expressing a desire to distance the seminary from the intensity and longevity of the controversy.Hewitson, Trust and Obey, pp. 90-92. Jelle Faber, Principal of the Canadian Reformed Theological Seminary, compared Shepherd's dismissal to that of Klaas Schilder, and noted that Shepherd was in agreement with Francis Turretin.Jelle Faber, Shepherd's Concept of the Covenant. Faber also wrote at the time that Westminster had \\"lost an eminent Reformed dogmatician.\\"Jelle Faber, Shepherd's Dismissal from Westminster Seminary. Shepherd's views were also controversial in the Orthodox Presbyterian Church, the denomination in which he was a minister. Shepherd left the OPC and became a minister in the Christian Reformed Church in North America.David VanDrunen, Justification by Faith In the Theology of Norman Shepherd. In 2012, a Festschrift was published in his honor. Obedient Faith: A Festschrift for Norman Shepherd included contributions from James B. Jordan, Peter Leithart, Andrew Sandlin, and Rich Lusk.

Yoshikawa was awarded many honors for his scholarship, including membership in the Japan Art Academy and he was named a Person of Cultural Merit. In 1969 he was awarded the Prix Stanislas Julien for the entire body of his work. Life and career Yoshikawa was born on 18 March 1904 in Kobe, Japan, as the second son of a local merchant. He entered middle school in 1916 and was introduced to the classics of Chinese history and historical fiction, such as the Records of the Grand Historian, Water Margin, Journey to the West, and Romance of the Three Kingdoms. In 1920, Yoshikawa entered the Third Advanced School in Kyoto, where he met fellow China enthusiast and future colleague Masaru Aoki and began studying Mandarin Chinese. In 1923, prior to entering university, Yoshikawa traveled to China, spending time in and around Jiangsu Province. Yoshikawa's interest in literature increased during this period as he read the works of noted Japanese authors Ry≈´nosuke Akutagawa and Haruo Sat≈ç. Yoshikawa matriculated at the Department of Literature of Kyoto University in 1923, where he studied Chinese and classical Chinese literature under the guidance of scholars Naoki Kano (1868-1947) and Torao Suzuki (1878-1963). He graduated in 1926 with a thesis on rhythm and prosody in Chinese poetry. After graduating, Yoshikawa was accepted as a graduate student and began advanced study in Tang poetry. From 1928 to 1931, Yoshikawa studied in Peking (modern Beijing), where he became friends with fellow sinologist Takeshir≈ç Kuraishi (1897-1975). Following his six years in China, Yoshikawa returned to Japan where he took up a position at what is now The Kyoto University Research Centre for the Cultural Sciences and taught courses in Kyoto University's Department of Literature. Yoshikawa was an ardent admirer of Confucius and sought to emulate traditional Chinese Confucian scholars in his personal conduct, even adopting a Chinese courtesy name: Zenshi ÂñÑ‰πã (Mandarin: Sh√†nzhƒ´). In 1932, Yoshikawa married a woman named Nobu Nakamura and bought a home in the Saky≈ç area of Kyoto, where he and his wife lived together their entire lives. During the late 1930s and 1940s Yoshikawa and his colleagues worked on editing and translating an edition of the 7th century Chinese work Shangshu zhengyi , a commentary on the Book of Documents written by scholar Kong Yingda.

Life He was of Norman origin, and was probably a son of the Hugh de Plessis who occurs as one of the royal knights from 1222 to 1227; he was possibly a grandson of the John de Plesseto who witnessed a charter of John, King of England in 1204, and was in the royal service in 1207. Amauricius and William de Plessis, who were provided with benefices by the king's order in 1243, may have been his brothers. Du Plessis is first mentioned in 1227, when he was one of four knights to whom ¬£60 was given for their support. He served in Wales in 1231, and on 2 March 1232 witnessed a royal charter to Stephen de Segrave. On 30 May 1234 he was appointed warden of Devizes Castle and of Chippenham Forest. In 1239 and 1240 he was sheriff of Oxfordshire, and on 9 December 1241 had the wardship of the heiresses of John Biset of Combe Biset, Wiltshire. In May 1242 du Plessis accompanied Henry III to Poitou. On 2 November he was granted a charger worth ¬£30, on 23 November freedom of bequest, and on 25 December the marriage of Margaret de Neubourg, countess of Warwick, and widow of John Marshal, son of John Marshal (1170?-1235). He returned to England with the king in October 1243. Through the royal influence his suit with Margaret de Neubourg was successful, but he did not assume the title of Earl of Warwick until his tenure of it for life was assured by the consent of the next heir, William Mauduit, father of William Mauduit; he is first styled earl in April 1245. On 18 October 1250 he had a grant of his wife's lands for life. On 24 June 1244 du Plessis had been appointed constable of the Tower of London; and he appears as one of the justices to hold the pleas of the city of London on 24 September 1251. In 1252 he is mentioned as one of the royal courtiers who took the cross, and in May 1253 was one of the witnesses to the excommunication of those who broke the charters. On 3 June 1253 his wife died so her estates settled on William Maudit as 8th Warwick. In August 1253 he again went with Henry to Gascony, and was in the royal service there till August 1254. On 11 February 1254 he was employed to treat with Gaston de Bearn, and on 5 March received ¬£200 in payment for his services. He was at Bordeaux in August 1254, but, having obtained letters of safe-conduct from Louis IX, started home through Poitou early in September, in company with Gilbert de Segrave and William Mauduit. The party was treacherously seized by the citizens of Pons in Poitou; Segrave died in captivity, and John du Plessis was not released until the following year. In the spring of 1258 du Plessis sat with John Mansel and others at the exchequer to hear charges against the mayor of London. At the parliament of Oxford in June 1258 he was one of the royal representatives on the committee of twenty four, was one of the royal electors of the council of fifteen, and a member of the latter body. He was appointed warden of Devizes Castle by the barons, and in 1259 was one of the council selected to act when the king was out of England. On 28 Nov. 1259 he was a commissioner of oyer and terminer for the counties of Somerset, Devon, and Dorset. When Henry removed the baronial sheriffs in July 1261, du Plessis was given charge of Leicestershire, and on 10 August was also made warden of Devizes Castle, a post which he held till 15 June 1262. He died on 26 February 1263, and was buried at Missenden Abbey, Buckinghamshire. Arms The coat of arms of John du Plessis was: six annulets gules (red) on a field of argent (silver). Family John du Plessis's first wife was Christiana (died before 1242), daughter and heiress of Hugh de Sanford of Hook Norton. They had three children: *Hugh (1237-1291), Knt. Hugh married his father's ward, Isabella, elder daughter and co-heiress of John de Biset. Their children were: **Hugh (1266-1301), who was summoned to Parliament in 1299, and left a son Hugh, who died before 1356 without male issue. **John of Quainton, who in 1270 was married to Annabel, eldest daughter of Nicholas Segrave, 1st Baron Segrave. They have numerous descendants; the direct male descendants perpetuate the du Plessis surname. **Christiana, who in 1270 married John Segrave (1256-1325), who subsequently succeeded his father Nicholas as 2nd Baron Segrave. They have numerous descendants, including the Mowbray and Howard Dukes of Norfolk, and Queens Elizabeth I of England and Elizabeth II. *Robert, who married Ela, his father's other ward, and the younger daughter and co-heiress of John Bisset. They have numerous descendants; the direct male descendants perpetuate the du Plessis surname. *Beatrice John du Plessis's second wife had no issue, and he was succeeded as Earl of Warwick by her nephew, William Mauduit, grandson of the 4th Earl. A nephew called Hugh de Plessetis was ancestor of the family of Wroth of Wrotham, Kent. There was a family of the name of Plessis or de Plessetis settled at Plessy in the township of Blyth, Northumberland. Alan de Plessis and John de Plessis were concerned in a forest dispute in Northumberland in 1241. The latter was a person of some note in the county, and was no doubt the warden of Northumberland in 1258, though Dugdale and others have erroneously assigned this office to the Earl of Warwick.HODGSON, Hist. of Northumberland, II. ii. 292-6BAIN, Calendar of Documents relating to Scotland, i. 276, 2141, 2611 =Surname= The surname du Plessis also had other spellings in England, including de Plescy, de Plessis, and the Latinized forms de Plessitis and de Placetis. The descendants of John du Plessis generally adopted the Latinized form but dropped the preposition, and over the centuries the surname was corrupted into various spellings, including Pleisted, Plaisted, Playsteed, Pleastid and Plestead.

Broomhead (13 November 1950 ‚Äì 24 July 2014) was a British mathematician specialising in dynamical systems and was professor of applied mathematics at the School of Mathematics, University of Manchester.  Education  Broomhead was born on 13 November 1950 in Leeds. He attended Aireborough Grammar School and, after spending a year teaching in Uganda, Broomhead moved to Merton College, Oxford, where he read chemistry for his first degree. He remained in Oxford for his D.Phil., researching quantum mechanics under the supervision of Peter Atkins. He completed his thesis Molecules in Electromagnetic Fields in 1976.  Career  After a year as a postdoc at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment, Broomhead moved to Japan. He held at two-year NATO Postdoctoral Fellowship in the Department of Physics at the University of Kyoto, in K. Tomita's group. On returning to the U.K., he worked as a postdoc with George Rowlands at the University of Warwick, again in the Physics Department. In 1983, Broomhead began working in the Signal Processing group at the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment (RSRE, now QinetiQ) in Malvern, becoming Senior Principal Scientific Officer. In 1995 he moved to Manchester, taking a Chair in Applied Mathematics, initially at UMIST and then after 2004, at the School of Mathematics at the new University of Manchester. From 1989 to 1992 he was Coordinator of the EPSRC Nonlinear Mathematics Initiative. He held visiting positions at University College London, the University of Oxford and Hiroshima University. Broomhead was a Fellow of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications (IMA), a member of the IMA Council from 1998 and was Chair of the Editorial Board of Mathematics Today from 2002. In 2013 he was made an Honorary Fellow of the IMA.  Research  Broomhead in 2010 Broomhead's main interest was the development of methods for time series analysis and nonlinear signal processing using techniques from the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems. He also championed applying these ideas in interdisciplinary research. In Japan, Broomhead began to work seriously on applied nonlinear dynamics and chaos. With Greg King he developed techniques to determine whether an experimental time series had been generated by a deterministic chaotic system by combining the pure mathematical results on topological embedding due to Takens with the engineering method of singular value decompositions. While in Malvern, Broomhead wrote his influential papers on delay embedding and on neural networks. In 1989 he was awarded the John Benjamin Memorial Prize for work with David Lowe and Andrew Webb that exploited an analogy between neural networks and interpolation using the newly developed radial basis functions from numerical analysis. At Manchester he became increasingly interested in applications to biology. He worked initially on eye movement control with Richard Abadi. Later, as a member of the Manchester Centre for Integrative Systems Biology, he worked with Douglas Kell on large-scale models of metabolism, and with Mike White on the dynamics of intracellular signalling cascades. He also developed a deep interest in hybrid systems and asynchronous processes, founding the Centre for Interdisciplinary Computational and Dynamical Analysis (CICADA).  Personal life  Broomhead met his wife Eleanor at Merton College, and they had one son, Nathan. He died suddenly on 24 July 2014 at the National Hospital in London.

After beginning training in 2007 with the Russian national team, he earned a bronze medal in the 2008 European U23 Championships in Monza. Amongst senior he made his breakthrough in the 2010‚Äì11 season: he reached the quarter-finals in the Paris and St Petersburg World Cups and he won the L√∂we von Bonn, defeating four-time World champion Peter Joppich in the semifinals and Olympic silver medallist Choi Byung-chul in the final. He was called into the national team for the European Championships in Sheffield. Russia saw off Israel, but were stopped by France in the semifinal. They overcame Germany in the match for the bronze medal, bringing Rigin his first European distinction. At Catania 2011, his first World Championships, he was defeated in the second round by USA's Gerek Meinhardt. These results pushed him to a world No.17 ranking at the end of the season and he was named ‚Äúbreakthrough of the year‚Äù by the Russian Fencing Federation. Rigin failed however to qualify to the 2012 Summer Olympics and the 2011‚Äì12 and 2012‚Äì13 seasons proved disappointing.

Drafted back into the Russian national team for the 2014 European Championships, he helped them cruise past the Czech Republic. Russia were largely defeated by France in the semifinals, but overcame Poland to earn Rigin his second European bronze. He finished the season No.9 in world rakings, a career best so far. Rigin began the 2014‚Äì15 season by a silver medal at the Prince Takamodo World Cup in Tokyo, after a defeat in the final to USA's Race Imboden.

Life  Gustav Gro√ü was born on 12 June 1856 at Reichenberg in the Kingdom of Bohemia, a part of the Austrian Empire. His father, Gustav Robert Gro√ü, was a railway industrialist, and a participant in the Frankfurt Parliament, as part of the 1848 revolutions across the German Confederation. Gustav Gro√ü studied political economics at the universities of Vienna and Berlin. From 1877 to 1881, he was a political official in the province of Lower Austria and from 1885, a privatdozent (independent professor) of political economics at the University of Vienna. He later moved to Iglau, and became a member of the Diet of the Margraviate of Moravia. In 1889, he was elected to the House of Deputies (), the lower house of the Imperial Council. He represented the city of Iglau as a German liberal. Whilst in the House of Deputies, he became a spokesman for all ethnic Germans in the Council.Austrian Biographic Lexicon, Vol II, Verlag Hermann B√∂hlau, Graz and Cologne, 1959, page 73 He was a member of the German School League, and was chairman of the League from 1885. Gro√ü was also a biographer of Karl Marx . From 1911, Gro√ü was chairman of the Deutscher Nationalverband, a broad coalition of German nationalist and liberal political parties that was formed to contest the 1911 election to the Imperial Council. The Deutscher Nationalverband swept to victory in that election. Despite this, the Council was suspended after the breakout of the First World War in 1914. Gro√ü would later serve as president of the House of Deputies in 1917‚Äì1918, during the last days of Austria-Hungary, towards the end of the war. In his function as president of the House of Deputies, Gustav Gro√ü delivered the \\"nine minute closing address\\" at the session on 12 November 1918, the day after the abdication of Emperor Charles I. As proposed by Gro√ü, a motion \\"to vote for no day for the next session\\" (keinen Tag f√ºr die n√§chste Sitzung zu bestimmen) was passed. After ten minutes, the session was finished, and so was the Imperial Council.Stenographisches Protokoll. Haus der Abgeordneten. XXII Session, 95th Sitting, Tuesday, 12 November 1918, p. 4699 f. On the following day, the Council was replaced by the \\"Provisional National Assembly\\", which proclaimed the Republic of German-Austria. As chairman of the Greater German People's Party, Gro√ü was a member of the Provisional National Assembly from 21 October 1918 to 16 February 1919. He represented Germans in Moravia, who ultimately were not able to remain part of German Austria, as this was forbidden by the Allied powers. Instead, the new Czecho-Slovak Republic, which had military occupied the lands inhabited by Germans in Moravia and Bohemia, was granted these lands. Germans in these lands were not allowed to participate in the election of the Austrian Constitutional Assembly in 1919. The proposal by Vienna to appoint German MPs for these regions had to be discarded. Gro√ü died on 23 February 1935 in Vienna.  Works  * Die Lehre vom Unternehmergewinn.

European discovery Map of Rivoli Bay, 1882 Rivoli Bay was named in 1802 by Peron and Freycinet of the Baudin expedition of 1800-03 after Andr√© Mass√©na, the Duke of Rivoli and Marshal of France. A shore-based whaling station operated in Rivoli Bay from the late 1830s and into the 1840s. It was initially operated by William Dutton and the Henty family who were associated with bay whaling at Portland Bay. Australian sea lions were hunted in Rivoli Bay for their skins in the 1870s. Ports and other settlements The following two settlements are located on its shores: Beachport and Southend. Both settlements have port infrastructure consisting of jetties. Protected areas The following protected areas adjoin the bay's extent: the Canunda National Park and the Penguin Island Conservation Park.

The Swiss Confederation recognizes the archives as the country's leading research facility for social issues and social movements. The Social Archives run their own research endowment fund, the Ellen Rifkin Hill Foundation. The SSA play an important role in communicating scholarship to the broader community. They have convened several exhibitions of essay collections on Swiss social history and conduct lecture series, presentations and information sessions. The archives work with Swiss secondary and tertiary educational institutions, archives and libraries and with similar institutions abroad. The SSA are a founding member of the International Association of Labour History Institutions (IALHI).http://www.ialhi.org/ Organization Run by an independent association funded by the Swiss Confederation, the Canton of Zurich, the City of Zurich and other sources, the archives employ about 20 historians, archivists, and librarians. The SSA's director is Christian Koller. History The SSA were founded in 1906 by Paul Pfl√ºger, a social reformer, politician and pastor from the working-class Zurich district of Aussersihl.http://www.socialinfo.ch/cgi-bin/dicopossode/show.cfm?id=541 Originally known as the Centre for Switzerland's Social Literature and inspired by the Mus√©e social in Paris, their aim was to document social questions. Early visitors included emigrants from Germany and Russia, notably Lenin and Trotsky. During the interwar period, antifascist refugees from Italy and Germany frequently visited the reading room, and in the 1940s the archives assumed their present name. The reading room became a popular meeting place for Eastern European refugees from the Cold War. In 1974 the Swiss Confederation recognised the archives as a research facility, and ten years later the archives moved to their present home at the Sonnenhof.

Among Pennsylvania high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduate in three years.National Center for Education Statistics Per the Pennsylvania Department of Education, one in three recent high school graduates who attend Pennsylvania's public universities and community colleges takes at least one remedial course in math, reading or English. Dual enrollment ‚Äì Warrior Run High School does not offer the Pennsylvania dual enrollment program which permits students to earn deeply discounted college credits while still enrolled in high school. Over 400 school districts in Pennsylvania offer this state-funded program. The district does, under limited circumstances, permit a student to leave the campus to attend higher education courses, which may be counted towards graduation credits. ACE Warrior Run School District students have access to Bloomsburg University's Summer College and Advanced College Experience (ACE) during the summer of their sophomore, junior and senior years (after high school graduation). Tuition is deeply discounted to 75% of the regular student rate. Successful students earn college credits that can be transferred to other Pennsylvania public colleges and universities through the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Center (PA TRAC) system. AP Courses In 2013, Warrior Run High School offered 6 Advanced Placement (AP) courses at a higher cost than regular courses. Students have the option of taking College Board approved courses and then taking the College Board's examination in the Spring. Students, who achieve a 3 or better on the exam, may be awarded college credits at US universities and colleges. Each higher education institution sets its own standards about what level of credits are awarded to a student based on their AP exam score. Most higher education give credits for scores of 4 or 5. Some schools also give credits for scores of 3. High schools give credits towards graduation to students who take the school's AP class. At Warrior Run High School, 37.8% of the students who took an AP course earned a 3 or better on the exam.PDE, School Performance Profile - Academic Performance Data - Warrior Run High School, December 2013 *2014, Warrior Run High School offered 6 Advanced Placement (AP) courses, with 33% of pupils earning a 3 or better on the AP end of course exam.PDE, School Performance Profile - Academic Performance Data - Warrior Run High School, November 2014 *2015, Warrior Run High School offered 13 Advanced Placement courses, with 39.5% of pupils earning a 3 or better on the AP end of course exam.PDE, School Performance Profile 2015 - Academic Performance Data - Warrior Run High School, December 2015 *2016, Warrior Run High School offered 13 Advanced Placement courses, with 54% of pupils earning a 3 or better on the AP end of course exam.PDE, School Performance Profile 2015 - Academic Performance Data - Warrior Run High School, October 2016 Graduation requirements The Warrior Run School Board has determined that students must earn 25 credits to graduate, including: 4 credits in English, 4 credits in social studies, 4 credits in math, 3 credits in science, 2 credits or 4 courses in physical education, 1‚ÅÑ2 credit in health, 1 course in driver education, and enough electives to complete the total requirements. By law, all Pennsylvania secondary school students were required to complete a project as a part of their eligibility to graduate from high school. The type of project, its rigor and its expectations are set by the individual school district. Effective with the graduating class of 2017, the Pennsylvania Board of Education eliminated the state mandate that students complete a culminating project in order to graduate.Pennsylvania State Board of Education, Proposed changes to Chapter 4, May 10, 2012 By Pennsylvania School Board regulations, beginning with the class of 2020, public school students must demonstrate successful completion of secondary level course work in Algebra I, Biology, and English Literature by passing the Keystone Exams. The original intent was to gradually add seven more exams including civics and geometry. In 2017, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed legislation that eliminated developing any more Keystone Exams in other subjects.PA General Assembly, Act 6 of 2017, June 21, 2017 In 2011, Pennsylvania high school students field tested the Algebra 1, Biology and English Lit exams. The statewide results were: Algebra 1 38% on grade level, Biology 35% on grade level and English Lit - 49% on grade level. Individual student, school or district reports were not made public, although they were reported to district officials by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Students identified as having special needs and qualifying for an Individual Educational Program (IEP) may graduate by meeting the requirements of their IEP, regardless of their test scores. Students have several opportunities to pass the exams. Schools are mandated to provide targeted assistance to help the student be successful. Those who do not pass after several attempts can perform a project in order to graduate. In 2017, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed House Bill 202, which makes modifications of the Keystone Exam mandates for students who attend VoTech and Career Tech schools. These pupils will be allowed to use alternate assessments or industry-based certifications. School safety and bullying The Warrior Run School District administration reported there was one incident of bullying in the High School in 2012-2013. Additionally, there was a case of sexual harassment. The local law enforcement was involved in six incidents at the schools, with no arrests. Each year the school safety data is reported by the District Administration to the Safe School Center which then publishes the compiled reports online. Nationally, nearly 20% of pupils report being bullied at school. The federal No Child Left Behind Act established the Unsafe School Choice Option. Each state that receives federal funds was mandated to establish a statewide policy requiring that a student at a ‚Äúpersistently dangerous‚Äù public school be allowed to transfer/enroll in a safe public school. The policy permitted a student who becomes the victim of a violent criminal offense, while in or on the grounds of any public school that he or she attends, to transfer to a safe public school. Each year since 2006, the Pennsylvania Department of Education has released a list of Persistently Dangerous Schools. Area School District schools have not been on the lists. The Warrior Run School Board has provided the district's anti Bullying Cyberbullying Policy online. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, Warrior Run School District is required to conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and anti harassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. =Safe School grant= In 2013, Warrior Run School District was awarded 13,190 in a state Safe Schools Targeted Grant. The maximum of $25,000 grants were awarded through a competitive application process. The funds must be used for research based interventions, like: peer mediation, staff training in managing behavioral issues and creating a positive school climate. The High School did not participate in the state's school resource officer grant. Wellness policy Warrior Run School Board established a district-wide Student Wellness Policy in July 2006 ‚Äì Policy 246. The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 ‚Äì 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity hat are aligned with the Pennsylvania State Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district administration to submit a copy of the policy for its approval. The Warrior Run High School provides both a free breakfast and a free lunch to children whose families meet federal poverty levels. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of the lunch. In 2014, President Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. The Food and Drug Administration requires that students take milk as their beverage at lunch. In accordance with this law, any student requesting water in place of milk with their lunch must present a written request, signed by a doctor, documenting the need for water instead of milk. Warrior Run High School provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. Nurses are available in each building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health's extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Certified School Nurses also monitor each child's weight and height, reporting the data annually to the state. In 2016, the Pennsylvania Department of Health made available to each Pennsylvania high school the overdose antidote drug naloxone in a nasal spray. School nurses were also provided with educational materials and training developed by the National Association of School Nurses. The cost was covered by a grant from a private foundation. Enrollment According to Pennsylvania Department of Education enrollment reports, there were 145 students in the Class of 2007 at Warrior Run High School. There were 134 students in the Class of 2008. The Warrior Run School District Class of 2010 had 119 students. Enrollment is projected to be 119 pupils in the Class of 2020. In 2008, the district administrative costs were $631.78 per pupil. The lowest administrative cost per pupil in Pennsylvania was $398 per pupil.Fenton, Jacob., Pennsylvania School District Data: Will School Consolidation Save Money?, The Morning Call, February 2009 A study of Pennsylvania public school spending, conducted by Standard and Poor's, examined the consolidation of small public school district in Pennsylvania in 2007. The study found that consolidation of the administration with an adjacent school district would achieve substantial administrative cost savings which varied by district. According to a 2009 school district administration consolidation proposal by then Governor Edward Rendell, the excessive administrative overhead dollars could be redirected to improve lagging academic achievement, to enrich the academic programs or to reduce property taxes. Consolidation of two central administrations into one would not require the closing of any schools. The Governor's proposal called for the savings to be redirected to improving lagging reading and science achievement, to enriching the academic programs or to reducing residents' property taxes. In March 2011, the Pennsylvania Institute of Certified Public Accountants Fiscal Responsibility Task Force released a report which found that consolidating school district administrations with one neighboring district would save the Commonwealth $1.2 billion without forcing the consolidation of any schools. From 2000 through 2010, rural Pennsylvania public school district enrollment has decreased by 8 percent. In 2010, there were 726,417 children in rural Pennsylvania, or 21 percent of the total rural population. From 2000 to 2010, the number of children in rural counties decreased 7 percent. The decline in the number of children impacted most rural counties with 42 of Pennsylvania's 48 rural counties experiencing a decline. Cameron County, Elk County and Sullivan County experienced the greatest declines, with a decrease of more than 21 percent in all three counties. Northumberland County's live birth rate was 1,167 births in 1990. Northumberland County's live birth rate in 2000 declined to 919 births while in 2011 it had declined to 961 babies.Pennsylvania Department of Health, Birth Age County Reports 1990 and 2011, 2011 Over the past 50 years (1960 to 2010), rural Pennsylvania saw a steady decline in both the number and proportion of residents under 18 years old. In 1960, 1.06 million rural residents, or 35 percent of the rural population, were children. Pennsylvania's birth rate has been declining for two decades. According to data from the Pennsylvania Department of Health, in 1990, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's birth rate was 171,053.Pennsylvania Department of Health, Health Statistics - Resident Live Birth rate by county, 1990 In 2000, Pennsylvania's birth rate was 145,874.Pennsylvania Department of Health, Health Statistics - Resident Live Birth rate by county, 2000 Finally in 2011, the State's birth rate declined further to 142,021.Pennsylvania Department of Health, Health Statistics - Resident Live Birth rate by county, 2013 From 2000 to 2009, the number of babies born in rural counties declined 5 percent.Center for Rural Pennsylvania, Number of Children Decreasing, Number of Seniors Increasing in Rural Pennsylvania, July 2011 Urban counties have also experienced a decline in the number of school aged children. From 2000-2010 urban Pennsylvania counties had a 3 percent decline in the number of residents under 18 years old. In 2010, there were 2.07 million residents, or 22 percent of the urban population, who were under age 18.Pennsylvania Department of Health, Birth Statistics, 2013 The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has one of the highest numbers of school districts in the nation. In Pennsylvania, 80% of the school districts serve student populations under 5,000, and 40% serve less than 2,000. This results in excessive school administration bureaucracy and not enough course diversity.2009‚Äì10 Executive Budget Fast Facts. Pennsylvania Office of the Governor In a survey of 88 superintendents of small districts, 42% of the respondents stated that they thought consolidation would save money without closing any local schools.

It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on August 5, 1969, and is included in the Col. Elias Earle Historic District. Until the end of the 20th century, the house was widely believed to have been built about 1810 for Congressman Elias T. Earle; but Earle never owned the property. The house is more likely to have been built c. 1829-1833 by one Samuel Green or possibly as late as 1834 after the land had been acquired by Elias Drayton Earle, half nephew and son-in-law of Elias T.

Local legend had it that Elias T. Earle built the house for his daughter Elizabeth's marriage in 1810. In 1856 James A. David bought the house and 35 acres. His son, Charles A.

With A. T. Odell, Oliphant also collected and published six volumes of her grandfather's letters. In the 1920s Oliphant had Greenville architect William Riddle Ward renovate the house to what she believed was its original Federal style, demolishing one wing, removing the colonnaded porch, and adding three rooms to the second floor. Some original features were preserved, including hand-hewn timbers, brick and rock supports, six-paneled doors, a hand-carved mantelpiece, and a Palladian window in the second story.Greenville News, December 3, 1950, 1.

He was also an explorer and a founding member of the Himalayan Club. It was 'largely owing to his influence and the esteem in which he was held in Lhasa' that Tibet permitted the 1935 and 1936 Mount Everest Expeditions. His life was cut short by a chronic illness which occurred in Lhasa during November 1935 on a mission to negotiate a settlement between Tibet and Thubten Choekyi Nyima, 9th Panchen Lama. On the announcement of his death, the Government of India stated that 'it robbed the Government of a most valuable officer'. Life Williamson was born on 31 January 1891 and educated at Bedford Modern School and Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He entered the Indian Civil Service in 1914, serving in Bihar and Orissa. At the outbreak of World War I, he saw military duty with the Gurkha Rifles in India (1915‚Äì16) and Mesopotamia (1916‚Äì18) where he was wounded. He saw service in Palestine and Egypt (1918‚Äì19) where he was mentioned in despatches. After World War I he held appointments in Bihar (1919‚Äì22), was Secretary to the British Resident of Mysore (1922), and was Secretary to the British Resident of Hyderabad (1923). He later became the British Trade Agent at Gyantse (1924) and Assistant to the Political Officer in Sikkim. His obituary in The Times states that he 'quickly felt the attraction of the romance and mystery' of those lands, and 'in his close study of the customs, folklore, and languages of the people followed in the footsteps of Sir Charles Bell'. Kula Kangri from Moenla Karchung 1933 In 1926, Williamson was made Officiating Political Officer in Sikkim and, in 1927, Consul-General to Kashgar, a position he held until 1930. In 1931, Williamson returned to Gangtok as Political Officer in Sikkim. His brief life was cut short by a chronic illness which occurred in Lhasa during November 1935 on a mission to negotiate a settlement between Tibet and Thubten Choekyi Nyima, 9th Panchen Lama. On the announcement of his death, the Government of India stated that 'it robbed the Government of a most valuable officer'. His obituary in The Times states that he may well 'have wished nothing better than to end his days where his heart was‚Äîamid the eternal snows of Tibet'. In 1933, Williamson married Margaret Dobie Marshall who had accompanied him on his travels. Margaret Williamson wrote a memoir of their life in Tibet, Sikkim, and Bhutan. Explorer The Trapchi Regiment A keen explorer, Williamson was a founder member of the Himalayan Club. In Kashgar and Gangtok he explored unknown routes and in 1928 established a new route from Yarkand to the Kara- Tash Valley by way of Kichik Karaul.Himalayan Journal, vol. iii, 1931, p. 36. In 1933 he travelled in Bhutan with his wife, crossing the Great Himalayan range into Tibet via Mon-La-Kar-Chung La, the difficult glacier pass. It was 'largely owing to his influence and the esteem in which he was held in Lhasa' that Tibet permitted the 1935 and 1936 Mount Everest Expeditions. On his travels, Williamson and his partner and future wife were prolific photographers. Between December 1930 and August 1935, they took approximately 1700 photographs throughout the Himalayan region. The photographs they took are at the University of Cambridge and are described as 'providing an unusually well-preserved and well-catalogued insight into social life in Sikkim, Bhutan, and Tibet during the 1930s'.

After the Prague Defenestration in 1618 and subsequent Protestant uprising of the Bohemian estates against the Catholic Habsburgs resulted in Thirty Years' War and a final defeat in the Battle of White Mountain, Habsburgs took their revenge and executed some of the key leaders of the uprising, although with some others the punishment was reduced and some were pardoned.  Execution  The execution of the 27 leaders of the Bohemian Estates Uprising began on 21 June 1621 in Prague on the Old Town Square. The executioner was an utraquist, so they could pray before the execution. Joachim Andreas von Schlick was beheaded first. This was followed by the execution of Jan Jesenius, whose tongue was cut out first, then he was beheaded. His body was quartered and the parts impaled on stakes. Jan Jesenius was punished most severely for several reasons: firstly, he persuaded Hungary to break up with the emperor and secondly, he wrote a political-philosophical treatise Pro vindiciis contra tyrannos (en: Can a tyrant be overthrown by people?). Others were beheaded by the sword; some of them had their right hands cut off first. The members of the Unity of the Brethren were hanged, which was the most disgraceful death for them. Headless bodies were handed over to the families, who buried them. Twelve heads were put into iron baskets and attached by the executioner to the Old Town Bridge Tower. The heads hung there until the invasion of the Saxon army took place here in 1631. City clerk Mikul√°≈° Divi≈° was nailed to the gallows by the tongue for one hour for welcoming Frederick V of the Palatinate on his arrival to Prague. Some nobles involved in the uprising escaped into exile, such as Jind≈ôich Maty√°≈° Thurn. Martin Fruwein z Podol√≠ (cs, de) was also expected to be executed, but he was found dead before the execution.

Other consequences were the possession of the Czech royal crown in the hands of the Habsburgs (now hereditary), which meant another nearly 300 years of their domination. Another major consequence was the subsequent recatholization, and since 75-90% of Czechs were Protestant, it meant a great emigrant wave (which was the majority of Czech intelligence). The German language was made fully equal to the Czech language, so Germanization of the entire population (not only the nobility) was also carried out. The executioner's sword, on whose blade the names of eleven executed are engraved, is in the collections of Hus House (Hus≈Øv d≈Øm) in Prague. However, it is likely that it is a fake sword, as in the list on the blade is engraved the name of Jan Kutnauer, who was actually hanged. At that time there was a struggle for balance in Europe, Europe was divided into Catholic and Protestant, absolutist and estates monarchy. The uprising itself triggered a conflict to which the powers were already heading. Execution in the Old Town Square celebrated Spanish-Catholic party the triumph of victory. Eventually, in the Thirty Years' War, there were no winners or losers, leaving only a ruined Europe.

Founded by Sir Ernest Beachcroft Beckwith Towse in 1928, the organisation provides adapted radios and audio players on free loan to registered blind and partially sighted UK residents over the age of eight, where hardship circumstances can be demonstrated by receipt of a means-tested benefit. Organisation British Wireless for the Blind Fund has been providing specially adapted radios to visually impaired people for more than 80 years. It prides itself on providing a personal service to each individual who receives a new set. For people with sight loss, life becomes a challenge; not just the difficulty of getting out and about, but also the everyday tasks that we take for granted - like turning on the radio in the morning to listen to the news, so the charity exists to help improve the daily lives of visually impaired people, who are unable to afford a specially adapted radio, by providing the equipment on free loan. BWBF is committed to providing a choice of high quality, specially adapted radio and audio sets on a free loan basis, undertaking to repair or replace equipment free of charge if necessary and is also committed to monitoring new developments in radio technology and endeavouring to adapt these to the needs of recipients where possible. It is made up of a small team of 17 staff, most based at its head office in Maidstone, Kent, and four regional development managers who work around the country. The charity is supported by a network of local agents, usually blind societies or local authority sensory teams. It also has around 45 trained volunteers who help across the charity. There are currently around 40,000 people with BWBF sets across the UK and the charity aims to distribute around 3,500 new sets each year. History British Wireless for the Blind Fund (BWBF) was founded in 1928 by Ernest Beachcroft Beckwith Towse, who had lost his eyesight in action during the Boer War. He was awarded the Victoria Cross. for two acts of bravery, the second of which cost him his sight. At the time of foundation, radios were commonly known as wirelesses. Although concession had been made in the 1926 Telegraphy (Blind Persons) Act, waiving the license cost for a wireless, the price of a radio was still prohibitive for many blind people. BWBF aimed to remedy this situation. BWBF Sonata plus+ recipient Roy WilliamsWinston Churchill broadcast the first BBC radio appealhttp://gasdisc.oakapplepress.com/cb1929r.htm for funds for the newly formed BWBF on Christmas Day, 1929,http://www.devonheritage.org/stentiford/Issue_48/Article3/05Dec3art1.htm starting a tradition of broadcast appeals that continued until the 1980s. He said: Churchill - A major new assessment of his Life in Peace and War. Edited by Robert Blake and Wm. Roger Louis. pg 217. Oxford University Press Following the appeal, the first 100 crystal radio sets made by Burne-Jones & Co Ltd were issued to blind people at a cost of 31/6d per set. Headphones cost 7/3d a pair. :File:Crystal radio for the Blind.tif/thumb/right/Crystal radio issued early 1930shttp://www.bbceng.info/Information/eng_inf_top.htm Winston Churchill made another Appeal at Christmas in 1930 asking for a further ¬£20,000 to provide another 10,000 people with radios. He reminded listeners that it had been a year since he first appealed for the cause and wondered whether the year had gone quickly for blind listeners. He said that wireless brought the blind each night a pageant before their mind's eye. \\"That mysterious lamp of inner conscientiousness will be continually fed by your unfailing care. The blind will hear, and by hearing, see.\\"https://archive.org/stream/newbeacon1415193031unse/newbeacon1415193031unse_djvu.txt By 1931, ¬£37,000 had been raised and 17,000 radio sets provided to blind listeners. In 1932 Lord Snowdon made the appeal, asking for donations to provide 2,000 more blind people with sets.https://archive.org/stream/newbeacon161932unse/newbeacon161932unse_djvu.txt James Ramsay MacDonald, Labour Prime Minister between 1931 - 1935, continued the tradition and appealed for additional funds on behalf of British Wireless for the Blind Fund from his home in Lossiemouth on Christmas Day 1933.https://archive.org/stream/newbeacon171933unse/newbeacon171933unse_djvu.txt Legislation, passed in 1945, exempted blind people from having to pay purchase tax on radios.http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/11-12/29/section/41/enacted BWBF has had many distinguished chairmen since Towse. Of note is Sir John Wallhttp://www.braillechess.org.uk/obituaries/johnwall.html who was chair from 1977 to 1991. A distinguished lawyer and high-court judge, Wall did not consider his blindness an impediment to his career and outside of his professional life, served the blind community in a number of roles. The first president of the fund was H.R.H. The Prince of Wales.http://www.biography.com/people/edward-viii-9542031 later to become King Edward VIII. Radio sets The first adapted radio set issued was a crystal radio receiver with a Braille dial.Radio Society of Great Britain article May 2014 ‚ÄòFrom Crystal sets to the Internet‚Äô. In the 1990s, a Magnum ‚Äò1 valve‚Äô receiver made by Burne-Jones & Co. Ltd. of London was discovered complete in its original postal packaging. The box contained not only the set but also batteries, earphones, a coil of copper aerial wire and some china ‚Äúegg‚Äù insulators. The 100-foot aerial wire was needed to give a strong signal. Even in 1932, when the D9150 was issued and when receiver controls had already been simplified, setting up the set would have required some skill and would not have been easy for someone with a visual handicap.British Vintage Wireless Society Bulletin Vol 18 no. 4, The Story of 'Wireless for the Blind' Hawes, Robert ISSN 0955-9345 Like the crystal set, all the early Magnum radios specifically manufactured for BWBF utilized the newly formalised Braille code invented by Louis Braille to label the dials on the set. Magnum sets from the E301 to the 3AS1691, with their wooden cases, thermionic valve and braille dial markings were issued between 1939 and 1943. Valve radios were a big advance in technology as they allowed incoming signals to be amplified. However, they needed heavy batteries to power them which did not last long. BWBF volunteers used to take and replace the batteries to users of the Magnum sets. Bush Radio started trading in 1932. They worked with BWBF on producing specially adapted sets which included the Bakelite-cased DAC10 which was issued in 1950. This set had five top-mounted push-button controls, medium- and long-wave preset stations and was smaller and easier to move than the Magnum sets. 440x440pxBWBF collaborated with Roberts Radio in the early 1950s to produce new models suitable for those whose lack of vision meant they had difficulty using a standard set. The use of transistors to amplify sound instead of vacuum tubes meant that the radio could be much smaller, required far less power to operate than a tube radio and was more shock resistant. This advance in technology, coupled with modifications to mainstream sets that improved usability for visually impaired users, resulted in a series of sets being produced by Roberts from the early 1950s onwards. The R55 issued in 1954 had a turntable mounted into the base of the set for easy turning and also had top mounted controls. The R303, R600 and R505 incorporated both these features and were manufactured in the trademark red leather, specifically customized for BWBF. The R505 issued in 1974 also had a specially adapted waveband switch. Bush also continued to make radios for BWBF and their VTR set issued in 1970 had a non-tilting aerial with a smooth plastic moulding on the tip to prevent accidental eye damage. During the 1980s sets such as the Roberts RM33 incorporated up to five buttons on which radio stations could be preset. This feature has continued through to sets issued present day. With the development of magnetic tape data storage, sets were produced with either a single or dual tape deck. This gave visually impaired people the additional option of listening to pre-recorded music and books and of recording messages to send to friends and family. The Roberts RSR50 incorporated a cassette tape facility as well as having large buttons, and tone and balance controls. BWBF briefly collaborated with Clarke and Smith,http://www.radiomuseum.org/dsp_hersteller_detail.cfm?company_id=11412 who specialised in educational equipment such as the \\"Tapete\\"-based audiobook system. Their simple, easy-to-use radios and sound receivers with large controls were a further step towards improved usability. The CS1 1318 model saw the new usage of yellow control knobs against a charcoal grey body set to provide a colour contrast to help those people who had some residual sight. The yellow and charcoal grey have become standard BWBF set colours. With the move to compact discs for storage of data, a CD player was added to the range of features of the Roberts specially adapted sets. The ‚ÄòSymphony‚Äô set issued in 2004 was one of the earliest sets with this feature and also included a ‚Äòbookmark‚Äô facility so that the user could return to the place in the music or story where they had left off. As new data storage devices have developed, so have the facilities to play them. The ‚ÄòConcerto 2 ‚Äò set, first issued in 2011 is both a DAB and FM radio, can play tapes, CDs, and files from an SD card or a USB memory stick. Ten radio stations can be pre-set, five on DAB and five on FM. It has a built-in microphone and headphone socket, controls with tactile symbols, a large backlit LCD display and can be mains or battery-powered. Internet radio, which involves streaming media, was pioneered in 1993. The Sonata and Sonata Plus+ sets which use this technology were developed by Solutions Radio of the Netherlands. Sonata Plus+ is a wireless internet radio and audio library, fully accessible to blind and partially sighted people. It has five buttons, one dial and an audible menu. BWBF hold a collection of most of the sets issued since the 1930s, partly thanks to the efforts of members of the British Vintage Wireless Society. In the early 1990s Maurice Steadman, a radio engineer and member of that society was asked to repair and restore old sets held by, or donated to BWBF:A ‚ÄôWireless for the Blind‚Äô set. Steadman, Maurice MSERT, Bulletin of the British Vintage Wireless Society Vol 15, no. 4 12.1990 ISSN 0955-9345Collecting old Wireless for the Blind sets. Steadman, Maurice, Bulletin of the British Vintage Wireless Society Vol 24, no.2 Summer 1999 ISSN 0955-9345 In 2012, BWBF received a Heritage Lottery Fund grant to bring together the history and heritage of the radio sets issued since the fund was set up.http://www.hlf.org.uk/aboutus/decisionmakers/committees/Documents/SEAllOurStories.pdf An article in The Radio Magazinehttp://edition.pagesuite- professional.co.uk//launch.aspx?eid=08833659-d32b-432b-8860-f6e52e06ef79 entitled ‚ÄòStay tuned‚Äô looks at how the information was uncovered. Tablet devices In 2017, BWBF launched Bumblebee an easy to use app, specially designed to meet the changing needs of the people we support and to unlock the digital world for those with sight loss. It has been developed by experts at British Wireless who have worked closely with blind and partially sighted people to ensure the product meets differing needs. File:Bumblebee from BWBF.jpg The large, simple menus can be viewed in a variety of contrasts, including black and yellow so they stand out to those with residual vision. Combined with audio description of each menu item, it is also user friendly for people with very little or no vision. Bumblebee provides access to thousands of radio stations, podcasts, talking newspapers and magazines, online content pages and a wealth of useful information, all from one portable device. There is also a community section, where users can share their experiences, discuss trending topics, share tips, talk about popular content and help and support each other ‚Äì all by using the in-built text-to-speech function. Part of the exclusivity of Bumblebee is the user-led content aspect, where listeners can essentially create their own personalised audio library in their pocket. It requires a wireless connection to stream live radio and download content. Once the audio files have been saved to the tablet which the app is issued on, they can be accessed anywhere; making Bumblebee perfect for listening on-the-go. Governing document BWBF is registered at Companies House as a private company limited by guarantee.

Danninger had made items for the court since 1801 and received the court commission (Hoftitel) in 1811. He made mirror fittings and decorative items for the court. By the 1840s, he was heavily indebted, which he attributed to increasing foreign competition and the burden of having to care for his mentally ill son. In 1844, Emperor Francis I agreed to buy a centrepiece from Danninger in order to save his business from imminent bankruptcy. Nonetheless, Danninger's house and business were sold at auction prior to his death in 1848, and were likely taken over by the originally English firm of John Morton und Sohn.

After the Civil War, Lanneau, a veteran of Hampton's Legion, first worked as a bookkeeper for Camperdown Mill and then in 1882 organized Huguenot Mill, one of the first steam-powered textile mills in Upstate South Carolina. Perhaps with money inherited by his first wife, Lanneau was able to build a fashionable and unusually grand residence for contemporary Greenville.

Life A native of Anglesey, he entered St. Mary's Hall, Oxford, and studied logic and grammar, but did not take a degree. On leaving university he became tutor to Charles Stuart, the son of Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox, and with him travelled through France and Spain. After his return he became a teacher of Greek and Latin in London. Works In 1569 Rowland published An Epytaphe of my Lorde of Pembroke, licensed to Thomas Colwell. For the use of his pupils he also wrote A Comfortable Aid for Scholers, London, 1578, a collection of renderings of English phrases in Latin. It was based on a work of Giovanni Andrea Grifoni. Rowland's major work was the translation of the first part of Lazarillo de Tormes, which he published under the title of The Pleasant History of Lazarillo de Tormes. The translation was influenced by the earlier French version of Jean Saugrain. It was itself an influence on English theatre, with the 1603 play Labyrinthus of Walter Hawkesworth combining a plot of Giambattista della Porta with a subplot from the book; and possibly on William Shakespeare and Edmund Spenser. The translation appeared in 1576, printed by Henry Bynneman and with a dedication to Sir Thomas Gresham, but it had apparently been licensed by 1568 to Colwell. No copy of the first edition is extant. Another edition of 1586, London, contains laudatory verses by George Turberville. The Spanish original was imperfect, having been expurgated. The translation ran through several editions, the last being that of 1677, which was supplemented by a translation of the second part of the history by James Blakeston. An earlier translation of the second part was by William Phiston. Rowland's translation was superseded in 1726 by a translation into more modern English (anonymous).

Sea Mither, or Mither of the Sea, is a mythical being of Orcadian folklore that lives in the sea during summer, when she confines the demonic nuckelavee to the ocean depths. Each spring she battles with her arch-enemy Teran, another spirit of Orcadian legend capable of causing severe winter storms, to gain control of the seas and the weather. Eventually Sea Mither overcomes Teran and sends him to the depths of the ocean, but the effort of keeping him confined there along with her other benevolent labours during the summer exhaust her, until in the autumn Teran takes advantage of her weakness to wrest control from her once again. Stories of the Sea Mither and Teran are among Orkney's oldest legends, perhaps invented to explain the vagaries of weather and other naturally occurring events. In Shetland fishermen petition Sea Mither to afford them protection from the Devil. Etymology Mither is defined in the Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue as the Scots variant of \\"mother\\", which may particularly reflect oral Orcadian use. The name of her opponent, Teran, is local Orkney dialect meaning \\"furious anger\\", and may be a derivative of ', Norse for \\"angry\\". Folk beliefs =Description and common attributes= Sea Mither is a spirit of summer days that quells the turbulent sea waters around the northern isles of Scotland. Shetland islanders, particularly fishermen, seek her protection from the Devil. Control of the seas is maintained by Teran, the spirit of winter, until Sea Mither arrives around the time of the vernal equinox in mid-March. Both spirits are invisible to humans. Teran is her arch-enemy and the pair fight bitterly, often for weeks as she tries to gain control. Their arguments cause gale force winds and heavy tumultuous seas as she tries to wrest control from him. Teran's screeches are carried by the howling gales as the two spirits try to oust each other. The period of the spring combat between the pair is termed the \\"Vore tullye\\" or the \\"spring struggle\\". Eventually Sea Mither overcomes Teran, relegating him to the depths of the ocean; inclement summer weather is caused by Teran's attempts to escape. During summer months the Sea Mither also keeps the demonic nuckelavee creature confined, and undertakes benevolent labours: she empowers aquatic creatures with the ability to reproduce; warms and calms the seas; and instils a softer song-like quality to the gentle summer breeze. According to folklorist and Orkney resident, Walter Traill Dennison, during Sea Mither's reign in summer the conditions reported by islanders may have \\"tempted one to believe that the Orkney archipelago had become the islands of the blessed.\\" But the continual work she undertakes to keep everything calm and the strain of maintaining control over Teran gradually tires her. As autumn approaches, Teran takes advantage of Sea Mither's exhaustion to break free, and conflict between the two starts again. The power struggles cause the weather to change with darkening skies and howling winds. This time, Teran triumphs in the conflict termed the \\"Gore vellye\\". Control of the ocean and weather is returned to Teran and Sea Mither is forced to leave. No details are given as to where she spends the winter, but during the storms caused by Teran the fishermen were consoled that Sea Mither would return refreshed and powerful in the spring, to again oust Teran from his malevolent grip over the seas. Origins Orcadian tales were strongly influenced by Scandinavian mythology with a blending of traditional Celtic stories. Folklorist and writer Ernest Marwick describes the Sea Mither and Teran as \\"pure personifications of nature.\\" Several ancient myths were based upon the natural elements of the turbulent and ever changing sea surrounding Orkney, but the stories of the two spirits are among the oldest legends on the islands. People had to be able to explain the vagaries of weather and other natural life cycles without the benefit of science; Traill Dennison hypothesises that this is why \\"the imagination of some half savage\\" may have formed the foundations of the myth.

Career  As a very young officer he played a part in suppressing the 1745 Rebellion, an experience which is said to have given him a lifelong aversion to the Scottish nation.Ffrench Blake, R.L.V.

John Hale co-owned the privateer Musketo, 120 tons, eighty men, and the Hertford. These vessels sailed on their first cruise in November 1756.Notes on Nova Scotian Privateers The regiment was renumbered the 17th Lancers in 1761. That year they were stationed in Scotland, where Hale's proverbial dislike of Scots people caused him to become engaged in a serious fracas with a toll-keeper, which might have had ended fatally. He was not disgraced, but was personally reprimanded for his conduct by King George III. The following year he acted as secretary to Earl of Albemarle during the Battle of Havana.Pointon, Marcia Strategies for Showing: Women, Possession and Representation in English Visual Culture Oxford University Press 1997 p. 181 After 1762 he gradually withdrew from regimental affairs, due it seems to quarrels with some of his fellow officers. In politics he was something of a reformer, and during the Yorkshire by-election of 1785 he made a celebrated speech which was considered by most of the electorate to be dangerously radical.The speech of Lieutenant-General Hale in favour of the people at the nomination and election of a member of Parliament for Yorkshire' Printed at York 1785' Hale was promoted major-general in 1772, lieutenant-general in 1777 and general in 1793.

None of the General's sons held high military office. Hale was not a rich man, and there is good reason to believe that he had some difficulty in providing for so large a family. Although his wife was the sister of a Countess, her own will shows that some of the younger sons were badly provided for.Pointon p.181 There is a celebrated portrait of Mary Chaloner Hale as Euphrosyne, one of the three Graces, by Sir Joshua Reynolds, who also painted her husband.

Early life He was born in London on 17 December 1855, the fifth son of the wine merchant James Butler and his wife, Frances Mary, the eldest daughter of Butler's business partner, William Hedges. He was educated a preparatory school in Brighton and a boarding school in Upper Clapton, and then studied in France and Germany in order to learn the languages. Career Butler became a partner in the family business, Hedges and Butler, in 1882. He was one of the first people in Britain to own a motor car, buying a Benz in 1897, and was the first honorary treasurer of the Automobile Club of Great Britain. With Charles Rolls, he helped to organize races from 1898, including the RAC 1000 mile Challenge, in which he took part, accompanied by his daughter. He was introduced to ballooning by Charles Rolls, and during an ascent accompanied by his daughter, Rolls and Stanley Spencer made on 24 September 1901 in a balloon named City of York, he suggested forming an aero club within the Automobile Club. This, the Aero Club of Great Briain, later the Royal Aero Club, would become the regulatory body for aviation in England, responsible for issuing pilot's licenses and also playing an important part in the development of military aviation in Britain. By 1907 he had made more than a hundred balloon ascents, including the longest solo flight made in England in 1902, and what was then the longest cross-channel balloon voyage, from Wandsworth in London to Caen in 1905. This flight had not originated as an attempt to fly the Channel: the intention had been to observe an eclipse of the sun.Butler, Frank Hedges. Fifty Years of Travel by Land, Water and Air. London, 1920. p. 328 In 1907 he published an account of his ballooning career, entitled 5000 miles in a Balloon.

He later became the first person to take a flying lesson at the flying school established at Hendon by Louis Bl√©riot, although he never gained a pilot's license. He was an enthusiastic traveller, not only frequently visiting France, Spain and Portugal in connection with his business, but also travelling to the Far East, North and South America, Lapland and Russia. An account of his trip to Lapland, Through Lapland with Reindeer and Skis, was published in 1917, and other travel books include Fifty Years of Travel by Land, Water and Air (1920), Round the World (1925) and Wine and the Wine Lands of the World (1927).

A homogenitus, anthropogenic or artificial cloud, is a cloud induced by human activity. Although generally clouds covering the sky have only a natural origin, from the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the use of fossil fuels and water vapor and other gases emitted by nuclear, thermal and geothermal power plants yield significant alterations of the local weather conditions. These new atmospheric conditions can thus enhance cloud formation.Describing Wilson's cloud chamber. Various methods have been proposed for creating and utilizing this weather phenomenon. Experiments have also been carried out for various studies. For example, Russian scientists have been studying artificial clouds for more than 50 years.Russian scientists create artificial cloud August 28, 2010 NECN/CNN But by far the greatest number of anthropogenic clouds are airplane contrails (condensation trails) and rocket trails.  Anthropogenesis  Three conditions are needed to form an anthropogenic cloud: # The air must be near saturation of its water vapor, # The air must be cooled to the dew point temperature with respect to water (or ice) to condensate (or sublimate) part of the water vapor, # The air must contain condensation nuclei, small solid particles, where condensation/sublimation starts. The current use of fossil fuels enhances any of these three conditions. First, fossil fuel combustion generates water vapor. Additionally, this combustion also generates the formation of small solid particles that can act as condensation nuclei. Finally, all the combustion processes emit energy that enhance vertical upward movements. Despite all the processes involving the combustion of fossil fuels, only some human activities, such as, thermal power plants, commercial aircraft or chemical industries modify enough the atmospheric conditions to produce clouds that can use the qualifier homogenitus due to its anthropic origin.  Cloud classification  The International Cloud Atlas published by the World Meteorological Organization compiles the proposal made by Luke Howard at the beginning of the 19th century, and all the subsequent modifications. Each cloud has a name in Latin and clouds are classified according to its genus, 'species, variety : * There is 10 genera (plural of genus) (e.g. cumulus, stratus, etc...). * There is a number of species for these genera that describe the form, the dimensions, internal structure, type of vertical movement (e.g. stratus nebulosus for stratus covering the whole sky). Species are mutually exclusive. * Species can further be divided into varieties that describe their transparence or their arrangement (e.g. stratus nebulosus opacus for stratus covering the whole sky and thick). Further terms can be added to describe the origin of the cloud. Homogenitus is a suffix that signifies that a cloud originates from human activity. For instance Cumulus originated by human activity is called Cumulus homogenitus and abbreviated as CUa. If a homogenitus cloud of one genus changes to another genus type, it is termed a homomutatus cloud.  Generating process  The international cloud classification divide the different genera in three main groups of clouds according to their altitude: * High clouds * Middle clouds * Low clouds Homogenitus clouds will be generated by different sources at those different levels. =High homogenitus= Condensation trails with Cirrocumulus homogenitus (Cca) and Cirrostratus homogenitu (Csa) observed over Barcelona (Spain, November 2010). Despite the fact that the three genera of high clouds, Cirrus, Cirrocumulus and Cirrostratus, form at the top of the troposphere, far from the earth surface, they may have an anthropogenic origin. In this case, the process that causes their formation is almost always the same: commercial and military aircraft flight. Exhaust products from the combustion of the kerosene expelled by engines provide water vapor to this region of the troposphere. In addition, the strong contrast between the cold air of the high troposphere layers and the warm and moist air ejected by aircraft engines causes rapid sublimation of water vapor forming small ice crystals. This process is also enhanced by the presence of abundant nuclei of condensation produced as a result of combustion. These clouds are commonly known as condensation trails (contrails) and are initially lineal cirrus clouds that could be called Cirrus homogenitus (Cia). Due to the large temperature difference between the air exhausted and the ambiance air generates small-scale convection processes. These processes favor the evolution of the condensation trails to Cirrocumulus homogenitus (Cca). Depending on the atmospheric conditions at the upper part of the troposphere, where the plane is flying, these high clouds rapidly disappear or persist. When the air is dry and stable, the water rapidly evaporates inside the contrails and can only observed up to several hundreds of meters from the plane. On the other hand, if humidity is high enough it exists an ice oversaturation and the homogenitus get wide and it can exist for hours. In the later case, depending on the wind conditions Cca may evolve to Cirrus homogenitus (aCi), or Cirrostratus homogenitus (Csa). The existence and persistence of these three types of high anthropogenic clouds may indicate the approximation of air stability. In some cases, when there is a large density of air traffic, these high homogenitus may inhibit the formation of natural high clouds, because the contrails capture most of the water vapor. =Middle homogenitus= The intermediate layers of the troposphere are the regions with less influence of human activity. This region is far enough from the surface for not being affected by the surface emissions. Additionally, commercial and military flights only cross this region during ascending or descending maneuvers. Moreover, in this region there exist two types of clouds with a large horizontal extension: Nimbostratus and Altostratus, which cannot originate from human activity. Consequently, it is assumed that there are no anthropic clouds of these two genera. However, what can occur is enhancing existing Nimbostratus or Altostratus due to the additional water vapor or condensation nuclei emitted by a thermal power plant, for instance. The only anthropic clouds existing in the middle region of the troposphere are Altocumulus homogenitus (Aca) from contrails at this region. =Low homogenitus= Stratus homogenitus (Sth) formed due to the emissions of a dairy factory near Gurb (Spain, February 2011). Cumulus homogenitus (Cua) formed due to the emissions of the thermal power plant in Sant Adri√† del Bes√≥s (Spain, December 2008). The lowest part of the atmosphere is the region with the largest influence of human activity emission of water vapor, warm air, and condensation nuclei. When the atmosphere is stable, the additional contribution of warm and moist air from emissions enhances fog formation or layers of Stratus homogenitus (Sth). If the air is not stable, this warm and moist air emitted by human activities creates a convective movement that can reach the lifted condensation level producing an anthropic cumulus cloud, or Cumulus homogenitus (Cuh). This type of clouds may be also observed over the polluted air covering some cities or industrial areas in high-pressure conditions. Stratocumulus homogenitus (Sch) are anthropic clouds that may be formed due to the evolution of Sth if the atmosphere is slightly unstable or from Cuh if the atmosphere is stable. Finally, Cumulonimbus (Cb) presents such a great vertical development that only in some particular cases they can be created by anthropic causes. For instance, large wild fires may yield to the formation of pyrocumulus that can evolve to Pyrocumulonimbus cloud and nuclear explosions produce mushroom clouds. Experiments Anthropogenic cloud can be generated in laboratory or in situ to study its properties or use it for other purpose. A cloud chambers is a sealed environment containing a supersaturated vapor of water or alcohol. When a charged particle (for example, an alpha or beta particle) interacts with the mixture, the fluid is ionized. The resulting ions act as condensation nuclei, around which a mist will form (because the mixture is on the point of condensation). Cloud seeding, a form of weather modification, is the attempt to change the amount or type of precipitation that falls from clouds, by dispersing substances into the air that serve as cloud condensation or ice nuclei, which alter the microphysical processes within the cloud. The usual intent is to increase precipitation (rain or snow), but hail and fog suppression are also widely practiced in airports. Numerous experiments have been done with those two methods in the troposphere. At higher altitudes, NASA studied inducing noctilucent clouds in 1960 and 2009.Artificial cloud created at the edge of space 23 September 2009 Magazine issue 2727 New ScientistNight Time Artificial Cloud Study Using NASA Sounding Rocket September 9, 2009 (press release) In 1984 satellites from three nations took part in an artificial cloud experiment as part of a study of solar winds and comets.Success is reported for space triple play Spokane Chronicle - Aug 16, 1984 A European satellite released and ignited barium and copper oxide 43,000 miles in space to create a 2,000 mile mauve and green plume visible for 22 minutes.

For the particular case of Cia due to contrails, IPCC estimates positive radiative forcing around 0.01 Wm‚àí2. When annotating the weather data, using the suffix that indicates the cloud origin allows differentiating these clouds form the ones with natural origin. Once this notation is established, after several years of observations, the influence of homopogenitus on earth climate will be clearly analyzed.

Biography Zaza Tuschmalischvili was born in 1960 in Skra, a small village near Gori in Georgia. When he was nine years old he underwent surgery for an inguinal hernia. In hospital he met the painter and art teacher Nugzari Zhochuaschvili. Zhochuaschvili discovered the talent of the young boy and started teaching him every afternoon in an art school in Gori. At the age of 15 Zaza was admitted to an art technical school in Zchinvali, a city 30 km away from Gori. After his graduation in 1979, Zaza did his military service. He stayed in Leningrad (St. Petersburg) for two years and during that time, had to employ his talent and creativity for political purposes. He was required to paint slogans and portraits, for example, of Stalin or Lenin, for International Labour Day and other events. At the age of 22 he was awarded a scholarship and began studying at the Academy of Arts in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia. He specialized in fresco restoration and studied techniques for restoring medieval mural paintings. Between 1984 and 1987 he spent his holidays in the cloister Gelati. There he participated in the restoration of the apsidal mosaic of the Mother of God Church. In 1988 he lived and worked for nine months in the church Ateni Sioni as a restorer. Here he wrote his diploma thesis which involved painting a copy of a mural painting of the archangel Gabriel from the 11th century. After perestroika and the fall of the Berlin wall, Tuschmalischvili came to Berlin in the year 1991. He soon started to display his paintings next to the bookstands near Humboldt University. In 1994 he met Annilie Hillmer and she became his gallerist. She specialized in Georgian art, showed his pictures in her art salon and at international art fairs. (Annilie Hillmer founded the Georgia Berlin Gallery in Berlin- Charlottenburg in 1997.) In 1996 the artist won the competition of the New Society of Fine Arts. His painting Harmony for Love, a tempera work measuring 187 x 377 cm, was displayed throughout 1997 at the underground station Berlin- Alexanderplatz. Work Zaza Tuschmalischvili‚Äôs work is rooted in his home country, Georgia. Recurring and central symbols are the fish, the tree, the cherub and the bull. His painting techniques over the years have included oil, watercolor and tempera. More recently he has experimented with new techniques, blending watercolor and egg tempera, sometimes supplementing this combination with pencil. In his Cubist-influenced collages, shaped patches of color convey the light and colours reminiscent of both the Mediterranean and Zaza‚Äôs home country, Georgia. Themes that appear frequently in his work are love, childhood and play. Zaza‚Äôs early paintings hava a relationship with Georgian mural paintings, in which compositional ideas and views date back to Byzantinium and Greco-Roman antiquity. In Georgia even the smallest village church was often painted inside and out with scenes of the Christological cycle and legends of the saints. Themes and motives are heaven or paradise, archangels and cherubim, or a king holding the model of a church in his hand. Zaza‚Äôs figures from that time are mostly one-eyed. During the mid-1990s, Zaza‚Äôs image structure becomes more tectonic, and the narrative wealth of detail disappears in favor of a consistent composition which captivates the viewer. After 2000, he almost completely leaves behind three-dimensional shapes. A pictorial depth enters the pictures instead, with a perspectival space deriving from superimposing individual surfaces (for example, Kiss Mask, Men with Mask and Romance, all created during 2003). Although the artist is still working with bright primary colors, it becomes clear how consistently this coloring submits to tectonic structures. Where the illusionistic width of the earlier pictures gave the painter the opportunity to use different shades, he now opts for a more basic approach, which usually consists of two to three color scales which interweave with each other. From 2004 onwards, this is done in a prismatic manner, so that the composition becomes increasingly transparent, gaining in depth of perspective (The City and Composition 7, both 2004).

On 5 February 2009, the French national competition regulator, the Autorit√© de la concurrence, found SNCF in breach of the code of commerce for unequal treatment of travel agencies and ordered the railway to pay euro in fines.Capitaine Train signe avec la Deutsche Bahn, Press release, Captain Train, 14 May 2012D√©cision du 5 f√©vrier 2009 relative √† des pratiques mises en ≈ìuvre par la SNCF et Expedia Inc. dans le secteur de la vente de voyages en ligne, Autorit√© de la concurrence This led to a relaxation of access requirements for the SNCF's reservation systems, and the project that became Captain Train was launched three days later, on 8 February. In May 2009, El√©gantes Solutions SAS, later to be renamed Capitaine Train SAS, became licensed as a travel agency and began negotiations and testing to enable the necessary access to the SNCF reservation systems.

He is the holder of the British 100 km record, after winning the 2014 British Championship in a time of 6:19:20 at the age of 39. He only began running seriously in 2007 to overcome lifestyle-related health issues, when he weighed over 100 kg. , he has run the London Marathon in under 2:20 four times, breaking the Commonwealth Games qualifying time of 2:17 for the first time in 2014. He represented England at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, coming in 10th overall, first for England, setting a new British veterans record with a personal best of 2:15:16. Following his 2014 performances, the media has lauded him as the 100 kg, 20-a-day man turned elite athlete. Running career Way entered his first marathon in 2006 and with only three weeks' training, finished in 3:07:08. He did not run again until 2007, when he started running in order to get fit, having weighed over 100 kg, smoked 20 cigarettes a day and subsisting on a diet of high-fat and high-sugar junk food. In order to make time for his training, running 130 miles a week, Way gave up a lucrative career in IT with long hours at Barclays Bank for a 9-5 clerical role. Following a 24-week training programme, Way ran the 2008 London Marathon with the goal of breaking 3 hours. He finished 100th in a time of 2:35:12. He began training with a running club and entered the 2009 London Marathon, this time finishing in 2:25:00. In 2010 he ran it in under 2:20 for the first time, repeating the achievement in 2011 and 2012. Injury prevented him from competing in 2013. On 13 April 2014 Way came 15th in the 2014 London Marathon with a race time of 2:16:27, having started some way behind the elite field in the sub-2 hours 45 minutes group. He was the third-best British runner in the competition, behind Olympic athletes Mo Farah and Chris Thompson, achieving the qualifying standard for the Commonwealth Games with 33 seconds to spare. He had not intended to race, instead planning to use the event as preparation for the 100 km British Championship in May. After the initial busy stages, he caught up with the 2:15 official pacer and settled in behind him, running under 32 minutes for the first and second 10 kilometres, reaching the halfway point in 67:21. In the 2014 Commonwealth Games marathon in Glasgow, Way finished 10th overall, first for England, just behind Derek Hawkins of Scotland. He ran a personal best time of 2:15:16 and also broke the previous British veterans record. At the 2014 British Athletics National 100 km championship in May, Way completed the course in 6:19:20, coming in first place and setting a new British record. However, representing Great Britain at the 100 km World Championships in Qatar in November, Way was unable to repeat his form due to a stomach bug. Nevertheless, despite stopping repeatedly to use the toilets, he finished 13th out of a field of 200 runners, in 6:57:23 and helped Great Britain to Bronze in the men's team event. In 2016, Way ran 63.75 km to win the Cambridge race that was part of the Wings For Life World Run.https://results.wingsforlifeworldrun.com/us/en/2016 In 2017, Way competed in the South African Comrades Marathon and, at his first attempt, finished 9th winning a gold medal for coming in the top 10 and being the first novice (first timer) over the line. Way became the first male British runner since Mick Orton, who won the race in 1972, to win a Comrades gold medal. Way won the Dorchester Marathon on 27 May 2018. In 2018, Way returned to the Comrades Marathon and, at his second attempt, finished 3rd winning a gold medal for coming in the top 10.

From 1885-1888, he was a student at the Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry. His breakthrough as illustrator was the children's book Norsk Billedbog for B√∏rn (Kristiania : L.E. Tvedtes Forlag) by Elling Holst from 1888, which is regarded as the first colored picture book in Norway. The book became widely popular and has been reprinted numerous times (the 17th edition was issued in 1998). He also illustrated the sequels from 1890 and 1903. The main subjects were naturalistic produced but kept separate by an ornamental framework, usually in the form of tree roots or other organic shapes. In total he illustrated 38 books. He is also known for his ceiling decorations in the Nationaltheatret. He was a teacher at the Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry from 1890 to 1934.

Messrs Scott and Nickolls owned the property in 1867. In 1888 a prospector named William Jones applied for a mining lease south of Corunna, which was granted in 1890. The French family acquired the property in 1977. In 2005 the family took the Federal Government to the Federal Court of Australia after it tried to acquire the property. The Government wanted to take the property and give it to the Barngarla Aboriginal people as compensation for the land the Government took from them for the Australian Army's Cultana training area.

Constable. p333 Alternative names are Licklihead; and Licklyhead Castle.  History  The estate originally belonged to Clan Leslie, but William Leith, who had twice been Provost of Aberdeen, acquired it from George Leslie in the 13th century. It remained in that family until, in 1625, Patrick Leith sold it to William Forbes of Leslie, who is thought to have restored the main element of the building, perhaps with the help of John Bell of Aberdeen. While residing in the house, William Forbes, illegitimate son of John Forbes, accidentally shot off his hand. This was believed to be judgment on him for the murder of Alexander Irvine, who was thought to be a supporter of the Marquess of Montrose. After the Restoration, he was executed for the crime. The house was owned by the Hays for a period from the end of the 17th century.Coventry Martin (1997) The Castles of Scotland. Goblinshead. p239 Patrick Duff of Craigston purchased the castle in 1723. He and his son built a new wing to the castle and remodelled its interior. There were further additions during the 1820s by Henry Lumsden, after he acquired the property from the Ogilvy-Maitland family. The castle was the seat of the lairds of Premney. Don Guillermo de Landa y Escandon, the Governor of Mexico City, purchased the castle for his daughter Maria Luiz in 1922 when she married a Leslie. Her great-granddaughter Rose Leslie, the actress, lived at Lickleyhead Castle when young. The castle was lost by her father in 2018. The current owners are the Davies family, originally from the Wirral.  Structure  The main block of the castle lies east to west, with the wing providing cover over two faces by jutting out southward. In the main block there are corbelled two- storey turrets on the north front, the upper floors having oval windows. A heavily corbelled semi-circular stair turret, corbelled out to square, rises in the west re-entrant; it provides access to a watch-room in the wing. The castle has crow-stepped gables. It is harled, and has a slated roof. The tower rises to three storeys, with an attic and a garret. While it has no gun-loops it has twelve shot-holes. There are decorated pediments. There is a vaulted basement, with kitchen and cellar, lit by slit windows; this is accessed by the entrance in the main re-entrant angle to the south. Narrowing turnpike stairs give access to the first floor; ascent afterwards is by the turret stair. There is an excellent hall. It is a category A listed building.

He was a senior official in the constitutional department of Nelson Mandela‚Äôs government in the immediate post-Apartheid years, and was the first post-Apartheid City Manager of Cape Town. Boraine later founded the South African Cities Network and helped to establish the Cape Town Partnership, of which he was CEO for 10 years between 2003 and 2013. He is currently CEO of the Western Cape Economic Development Partnership (EDP). In 2017, Andrew participated in the Rockefeller Foundation Bellagio Center Residency Program where he researched \\"the role of partnering and partnerships in steering and managing complex societal transitions\\" in relation to city and regional development.  Early life and education  Boraine was born in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa on 18 February 1959. He attended Kearsney College (1972‚Äì74) and Diocesan College (1975‚Äì76) before reading for bachelor's degrees in History and Economic History at the University of Cape Town. Boraine was elected National President of NUSAS (the National Union of South African Students) in 1980 and 1981 and was a committed anti-Apartheid activist throughout his student years and until the end of the regime in 1994.http://www.aluka.org/action/showContentImage?doi=10.5555/AL.SFF.DOCUMENT.SPE19801129.026.022.000 In 1983, he was a founding member of the United Democratic Front (UDF), a large popular movement in South Africa during the 1980s against Apartheid.

He acted as a facilitator in their negotiations with local government, particularly looking to build capacity amongst the most marginalised and disadvantaged communities.  Early career  When South Africa‚Äôs first democratic government was established in 1994 under the leadership of Nelson Mandela, Boraine was appointed Deputy Director-General in the Department of Constitutional Development. Boraine was responsible for the amalgamation of South Africa‚Äôs local authorities to form integrated (i.e. non-racially segregated) authorities, and assisted in drafting the local government chapter for the new South African Constitution, which adopted an innovative definition of local government as an equal, rather than subordinate, sphere of government to national and provincial governments.http://www.ilex- urc.com/ILEX/.../A-Boraine-Derry-presentation-May-09.doc In 1997, Boraine moved from national government to take up the position of City Manager of the City of Cape Town. The role required Boraine to restructure the city administration and address the needs of populations and areas which had been excluded from the local government system for many years under Apartheid. In 2001, Boraine became Special Advisor to the Minister for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, where he advised on city development strategy and urban policy. Boraine used his experiences as Cape Town City Manager to conceptualise and coordinate the establishment of the South African Network (SACN), which encourages the nine largest cities in South Africa to exchange information, experience and best practices on urban development and city management.  Cape Town Partnership and Western Cape Economic Development Partnership  In 2003, Boraine joined the Cape Town Partnership (CTP) ‚Äì an institution which he had helped to establish during his time as City Manager. The Partnership, which operated for 17 years, was a non-profit collaborative organisation in which public, private and civic sectors worked together to develop, promote and manage Cape Town Central City.http://www.capetownpartnership.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Lessons- FINAL-8-Sep-09.pdf The Partnership developed a vision of an ‚Äúinclusive, productive and diverse city centre that retains its historic character and reflects a common identity for all the people of Cape Town‚Äù. Its initial role was to bring the private and the public sectors together to find workable solutions to create a safe, clean and high-quality environment in Cape Town‚Äôs Central City in which to work, play, study and live. A specific urban management vehicle, the Central City Improvement District (CCID) was launched in November 2000 to implement the CTP‚Äôs plans on the ground. Within a decade of the Cape Town Partnership‚Äôs establishment the Cape Town Central City had become one of the cleanest and safest in the country. Crime dropped by 50%, serious crime by 90%, and today 74% of people say they feel safe in the CBD.http://www.capetownpartnership.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Lessons- FINAL-8-Sep-09.pdf The CTP developed an internationally recognised social development programme, innovative job creation schemes, attracted investment of between R14-18bn with a further R20bn in the pipeline, upgraded and redeveloped over 170 buildings, many of them of important heritage significance, restored property values and municipal revenues, revitalised public spaces and improved pedestrian environments, fostered innovative cultural, sustainable development and 2010 FIFA World Cup programmes, and developed an agenda for the future in the form of the Central City Development Strategy.http://www.capetownpartnership.co.za/wp- content/uploads/2009/08/Lessons-FINAL-8-Sep-09.pdf As CEO of the CTP, Boraine led Cape Town‚Äôs successful bid for the title of World Design Capital 2014.http://www.capetown2014.co.za/home/2014-starts-now-andrew-boraine-on- winning-world-design-capital-2014/ The CTP sourced and developed content for the bid ‚Äòbook‚Äô, prepared supporting material to strengthen the case, and hosted the judges in the city for a three-day site inspection in mid 2011.http://www.wdccapetown2014.com/static/7HuDe38sSw6xgYRi8Xwtoyk4HkWrLRzDswArwubF5Ag.pdf Cape Town was announced as the 2014 World Design Capital in October 2011, beating the shortlisted cities of Bilbao and Dublin to the title. Boraine was CEO of the CTP for nearly 10 years, stepping down in April 2013 to focus his efforts on the wider Cape Town and Western Cape region, through his formation and leadership of the Western Cape Economic Development Partnership (EDP). The Western Cape Economic Development Partnership, known as the EDP, was established in April 2012 to improve the performance of the Cape Town and Western Cape socio-economic development system. It helps leaders and institutions from different sectors - public, private, civil society, education and research - to work together, to grow the local, metropolitan and regional economy, and to address complex system challenges.http://wcedp.co.za/ Formally, the EDP was set up to ‚Äúimprove the performance of the Cape Town and Western Cape economic development system, by creating and sustaining partnerships between economic stakeholders, in support of the goal of creating a resilient, inclusive and competitive region, thus contributing to South Africa‚Äôs national economic success.‚Äùhttp://wcedp.co.za/introduction/  International career  Boraine has become an international thought leader in city, economic and urban development strategy ‚Äì he has spoken at the World Urban Forum, the Brisbane G20 Global Cafe, the UK Sustainable Cities Summit and Chatham House.

Its name is derived from the Latin word \\"spongia\\", the spot where rainwater was collected. The rectangular building with an inner courtyard was built in a mixed Gothic and Renaissance style between 1516 and 1522 by Paskoje Miliƒçeviƒá Mihov. The loggia and sculptures were crafted by the brothers Andrijiƒá and other stonecutters. The palace has served a variety of public functions, including as a customs office and bonded warehouse, mint, armoury, treasury, bank and school. It became the cultural center of the Republic of Ragusa with the establishment of the Academia dei Concordi, a literary academy, in the 16th century. It survived the 1667 earthquake without damage. The palace's atrium served as a trading center and business meetingplace. An inscription on an arch testifies to this public function: :Fallere nostra vetant et falli pondera. Meque pondero cum merces ponderat ipse deus. :\\"Our weights do not permit cheating. When I measure goods, God measures with me.\\" The palace is now home to the city archives, which hold documents dating back to the 12th century, with the earliest manuscript being from 1022. These files, including more than 7000 volumes of manuscripts and about 100,000 individual manuscripts, were previously kept in the Rector's palace. The Lu≈æa square in front of the palace is used for the opening ceremony of the Dubrovnik Summer Festival. Sponza Palace itself is also used as a performance venue. The palace's atrium is the basis of the \\"Sponza Atrium\\" 3D computer graphics model, created for a rendering contest and now a widely used reference model for global illumination rendering.

Fitzpatrick (15 July 1948 - 14 May 2014) was an Irish urologist, known for his pioneering work on the field of men's prostate cancer. Early life John M. Fitzpatrick was born on July 15, 1948. His father was a prominent Dublin lawyer and his mother's family had a strong medical history. Before going to University College Dublin, Fitzpatrick travelled a lot. With a teenage friend he travelled to Egypt, Jordan and Syria and at the age of 19 visited Czechoslovakia, just before the Prague Spring of 1968. He won a scholarship to do greats at Oxford University, but chose to go to medical school in Dublin instead. In 1971 he qualified in Medicine of University College Dublin. Career Fitzpatrick was among the first in Ireland and Britain to embrace the surgical removal of the prostate if prostate cancer was still confined to the gland, and successfully cured many men. In the past decade, Fitzpatrick worked on developing two second-line treatments, enzalutamide and abiraterone, which both have shown to extend the lives of men whose cancer has relapsed after initial hormone therapy with only modest side effects. He was also involved in the introduction of taxane-based chemotherapy to use for men whose cancer had spread, and were no longer responding to first-resort hormonal therapies. Fitzpatrick was emeritus professor of surgery at the University College Dublin School of Medicine & Medical Science and Head of Research at the Irish Cancer Society Personal life Fitzpatrick has two brothers, a lawyer and a general practitioner. Death On 14 May 2014, Fitzpatrick was taken ill in his own gym at home, and died of subarachnoid haemorrhage.

The 2-1/2 story gambrel-roofed wood frame structure was designed by Moses Johnson and built in 1793-94 at the Shaker village in Enfield, New Hampshire. At that site the building served as the main meeting space for the Shakers, with a main meeting space on the ground floor, offices on the second floor, and guest living quarters in the attic space. The building is similar in construction to buildings designed by Johnson for the Shaker villages in Canterbury, New Hampshire and Sabbathday Lake, Maine. The Shakers stopped using the building in 1893, and sold it in 1902 to the sculptor Louis St. Gaudens. St. Gaudens had the building disassembled and moved to its present location, making a number of alterations to it in the process. Due to rot in some framing members, the building was shortened by , and a porch was cut into one side. One of the two main entrance doors was relocated to the side of the building, and dormers were added to enlarge the attic space. The lower floors were divided into a living space (living room below, bedrooms above) and a two-story studio space. A 1-1/2 story ell was added in 1904. St. Gaudens was brother to Augustus St. Gaudens, who was a leading figure in the Cornish Art Colony that flourished in the early 20th century, and whose own Cornish property is now a National Historic Site and National Historic Landmark. This property was occupied by St. Gaudens and his wife until their deaths in the 1950s, and then by their son Paul, a potter. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.
