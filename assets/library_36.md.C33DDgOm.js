Exploring the complex relationship between humanity and technology, Kaleda’s work centers on the underlying fear, uncertainty and beauty of the digital age. He is also known for pioneering the use of QR codes within his paintings.Gary Kaleda, Artist’s Statement from Website, garykaleda.com  Background  = Early life = Born on Long Island, New York in 1966, Gary Kaleda's artistic talents became apparent in high school. With encouragement from a teacher, his early work led to a scholarship to Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. He graduated with honors in 1988. After college, Kaleda took a job compositing photographic proofs for a company that manufactured retouching stations. Surrounded by state-of-the-art computers and graphics hardware, he was drawn to the technology. It was here that mixing the science of computers with the art of painting first entered his mind. Although he continued to paint traditionally, in 1993 Kaleda purchased his first computer and began experimenting. During the mid-1990s, the exponential growth of the internet began to have a significant influence on Kaleda and the relationship between humanity, technology and the internet became a primary focus in his work. By 1997, Kaleda was working as a pre-press technician for an established New York City printing firm. Within five years, he had taught himself Adobe PhotoShop, Illustrator and Corel Painter, and expanded his skills into photo retouching and color correction for fashion catalogues. While these skills served him in his commercial work, they also became additional tools for his painting. His work evolved into mixed media, combining manipulated digital images printed on canvas with spray paint and solvents. During the next four years, Kaleda’s work shifted again to a new digital approach reflecting a highly refined and unique style. In 2010, Kaleda broke new ground by incorporating QR codes into his work, adding interactivity and multi-dimensionality to his paintings. He continues to live and work in Manhattan.Gary Kaleda, Biography from Website, garykaleda.com = Transition to Digital = Witnessing the birth and growth of the digital age had a profound effect on Kaleda’s work as an artist. While his formal art training was grounded in tradition, a parallel path developed involving the creation of art with the computer. As advancing technology transformed the social, political and economic landscape, Kaleda’s work progressed from mixed media to all digital: “I saw the world become more connected on a global level, but increasingly isolated on an individual level. And within the terrifyingly vast landscape known as the internet, I looked on as an entire culture turned away from face-to-face communication. Intimacy became cybersex, and true identities were replaced by ideal or false personas, yet we still long to connect. These themes emerged in my figurative paintings and continue to inspire my work today.” Although Kaleda uses software to simulate elements of conventional painting, his technique breaks tradition in many ways, including the use of graphic shapes and patterns as brushes, and creating his own digital models as subjects. Painting with the computer also allows an infinite number of variations with the ability to return to different stages of the process. While technology plays a prominent role in Kaleda’s creations, the human factor remains paramount in both his themes and end results: “In terms of digital painting in general, the basic process is that I interpret the world and the computer interprets my input. Ultimately, the final decisions are mine. The paradoxical truth is that the power of digital art, and using technology to make art, will always rely on the human element. My work is both an example and an expression of this.”  Use of QR Codes  Kaleda began incorporating QR codes into his paintings in 2010. In addition to blurring the line between art and commodity, these codes serve many different functions within Kaleda’s work. Offering an interactive experience, QR codes provide viewers with additional information to deepen understanding about a given painting.Duggal Connect Blog, Art Scene, Digital Paintings by Gary Kaleda In some instances, the codes serve as a stamp or symbol of authorship – much like a modernized Asian chop or seal (East Asia). One painting called “Fetish” uses the codes themselves as paint brushes. According to Kaleda: “As a condensed digital representation of information (or a message), these codes have a natural place within the language and fabric of my work.”  References   External links  * Artists website Category:20th-century American painters Category:American male painters Category:21st-century American painters Category:21st-century male artists Category:1966 births Category:Living people ","title":"Gary Kaleda"},{"id":"33007044","text":"Indiaplaza was an Indian electronic commerce.

Founded in 2008, the league has three competitive co-ed home teams, two junior roller derby teams, an all-female away/travel team and a referee team. History The Ballarat Roller Derby League was founded in June 2008, with the aim to have their first public bout by late 2009. In February 2009 they gained their first venue, and succeeded in hosting their first match in November of that year, The Derbytante Brawl. The two teams consisted of eight of their own skaters combined with members of the Geelong Roller Derby League. Their next public bout was in March 2011, when the BRDL appeared at the ChillOut Festival in Daylesford, Victoria – The Libertines reversing the outcome of their first match by defeating the Gold Diggers 189 points to 165. (Their appearance in Daylesford sparked interest in a league in the city, and thus the Daylesford Derby Dolls were formed, with the BRDL providing support and coaching in their initial stages). After their appearance in Daylesford, the team competed in an interleague season with the Geelong Roller Derby League, fielding the \\"Rat Pack\\" with the Victorian Roller Derby League providing the players necessary to fill out their roster. Although unsuccessful in the five match series, this led up to their appearance at the Great Southern Slam hosted by Adelaide Roller Derby, the largest roller derby competition held outside of the United States. The \\"Maulrats\\", a combined team consisting of members of the BRDL and the Geelong league, finished sixth out of the 20 competitors. Ballarat take on Hobart's Convict City Rollers in November 2010. Towards the end of 2010, the BRDL competed against the South Seas Sirens in the first match in which the Ballarat league was able to field a full team, losing out by 114 to 96. Their first interstate interleague bout was also held in November, 2010, when the Rat Pack travelled to Tasmania to take on the Convict City Rollers. This proved to be the Ballarat team's first win, by a convincing 213 points to 56.

As a result of the treaty Przemysł adopted the title dux Polonie et Pomeranie (Duke of Poland and Pomerania). History Mestwin II, Duke of Pomerania Mestwin, per the agreement, retained de facto control over the province until his death in 1294, at which time Przemysł, who was already the de jure ruler of the territory, took it over in practice. According to some sources, it's possible that Mestwin kept full control of the province and the agreement merely stipulated that whichever ruler lived longer would take over the others territory. The treaty was, per custom, affirmed and approved by an assembly of nobles of both Pomerania and Wielkopolska. Map of the provinces of Wielkopolska and Gdańsk Pomerania unified under Przemysł II as a result of the treaty (in yellow). The agreement would serve as a basis for Przemysł's crowning (1296) as the first King of Poland since 1076, and the first ruler of reunified Poland since 1138. The map shows the situation from 1295, when the province of Kraków (in red), previously controlled by Przemysł, has been taken over by Wenceslaus II of Bohemia. The merger of Gdańsk Pomerania with Przemysł's other Polish provinces of Poznań, Wielkopolska, and Kraków was an important step in the process of reunification of Poland, after its feudal break up, which took place after the death of Bolesław III Wrymouth in 1138. The year after taking full control of Pomerania, Przemysł was crowned as king of Poland in Kraków. In the following year (1296) however, he was assassinated by agents of the Margrave of Brandenburg and some Polish nobles (the Nałęcz family), as both parties opposed the rise of a strong central power in Poland. Przemysł's realm, including Pomerania, became the subject of a civil war between Wenceslaus II of Bohemia and Władysław I the Elbow-high, both of whom at some point crowned themselves as kings of Poland. The immediate effect of the treaty was that Mestwin and Przemysł began to carry out a single foreign policy, particularly in regard to Brandenburg and Western Pomerania. Additionally, Przemysł appointed several of his trusted men from Wielkopolska to offices in Gdansk and the surrounding area. The treaty was followed up with several subsequent extensions and agreements. These included meetings in Nakło (1284), Słupsk (1287), Rzepka (1288) and once again Nakło (1291). The meeting in Słupsk in November 1284 was particularly important as it was also attended by the Duke of Szczecin-Pomerania (one of the duchies of Western Pomerania), Bogusław IV of the Griffins dynasty. The three rulers (Przemysł, Mestwin and Bogusław) concluded a mutual-defense alliance, directed against the expansionistic policies of Brandenburg, and it was agreed that Bogusław was to inherit Pomerania in case if both Przemysł and Mestwin died without heirs. This alliance was reaffirmed at the meeting in 1291 at Nakło. Despite the fact that Bogusław outlived both Mestwin and Przemysł, events on the ground and subsequent political developments, such as the struggle between Wenceslaus and Władysław the Elbow-high, meant that the provisions of the Nakło agreement were never implemented and Bogusław did not succeed come to acquire control over Pomeralia. As part of the treaty Przemysł also granted the town of Kępno municipal rights, based on those of Kalisz.

He kept ownership of his original framing workshop building, which he used as his private home and where he displayed his art collection, which was not open to the public. Radev's friend Eardley Knollys ran the Storran Gallery in London with his partner Frank Coombs from 1936 and 1944. They sold works by artists such as Amedeo Modigliani, Maurice Utrillo and Chaïm Soutine. Coombs was killed in an air raid in Belfast in 1941, which led to Knollys closing the gallery in 1944. Edward Sackville-West, who had briefly been Knollys' lover when they were students at Oxford University in the early 1920s, later became a life long friend. In 1945, Knollys, Sackville- West and the music critic Desmond Shawe-Taylor together bought a Georgian rectory at Long Crichel, Dorset, where they held weekend literary and artists' salons, which Radev often attended. When Sackville-West died unexpectedly in 1965, aged 63, Knollys inherited the art works he had been collecting since 1938 and added them to his own art collection.

Located west of Israel's Leviathan gas field, block 12 is believed to hold of natural gas. In 2014, the reserve estimate for the quantity of natural gas held by Aphrodite was raised by 12% due to new data received from the Yishai prospect as reported by Delek Drilling to the Israel Securities Authority. The cost of the field's development was estimated to range from $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion. Noble Energy received the concession to explore block 12 in October 2008. In August 2011, Noble entered into a production-sharing agreement with the Cypriot government regarding the block's commercial development. Sources in Cyprus indicated in mid-September that Noble had commenced exploratory drilling of the block. The drilling, which took 116 days to complete, resulted in the finding of gas in high-quality Miocene sand intervals at the Aphrodite field. In 2015, Noble Energy, Delek Drilling, and Avner Oil Exploration filed a Declaration of Commerciality of the field to be followed by a development and production plan. Noble Energy sold a 35% stake of Block 12, which includes Aphrodite, to BG for $165 million.  Aphrodite-Yishai Dispute  The Aphrodite gas field has been the subject of a dispute between Cyprus and Israel since a part of the field, known as Yishai, stretches into Israel's maritime zone and gas being pumped from Aphrodite could reduce the amount of gas available on the Israeli side. Some estimates state that up to 10% of the total reservoir could be Israeli, making up to 10 BCM of gas worth nearly $1.5 billion at stake. In May 2018, Israeli Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz attended a meeting in Cyprus with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and said that the dispute could be settled within six months, but that if an understanding would not be reached, a professional arbiter would be asked to examine the findings from both sides and decide on the proper division. In July 2018, development moved forward despite the dispute, which involved how to divide revenues between the Aphrodite and Yishai fields as well as OECD or EU rules should be used. The Aphrodite partners submitted a plan to the government of Cyprus to develop the field, to sell the gas to Cypriot users, and to export it to Egypt. In November 2019, Delek Drilling, Noble Energy, and Shell signed a 25-year concession agreement with Cyprus for the exploitation of Aphrodite. In response, Israeli Energy Ministry Director General Udi Adiri sent a letter to the partner companies on November 24, 2019 saying that development must not begin until an agreement was reached between the governments of Israel and Cyprus. Cypriot Energy Minister Yiorgos Lakkotrypis responded to the letter by saying that the development of Aphrodite would continue as planned, that a procedure for a “special agreement” over unitization of the block was in progress and would be followed, and that there was no link between Aphrodite development and the procedure for the special agreement. Cyprus awarded a development license to the partners, who are to drill appraisal wells and conduct front-end engineering and design (FEED) work over the following two years, with a final investment decision anticipated for 2022. A commercial agreement is being sought to export up to 800 MMcf/d to Egypt via a pipeline that will be constructed as a separate project in which the gas from Aphrodite would be processed at the Shell-operate Idku facility and re-exported as LNG by 2025.

History Calliope was the original seat of Sioux County, Iowa. However, the citizens of a Dutch settlement of Orange City, Iowa believed that the county seat should be moved to their city.

Split payment transaction) is the financial term for the act of splitting (dividing) a single and full amount of payment in two or more simultaneous transactions made by different payment methods. For example: split payment of a $100 to a retail shop can be done when the customer pays $50 in cash and $50 by credit card. Split payment is not installment (a.k.a. Hire purchase), where payments are done periodically with the same payment method.  History  With the era of global trade, the financial possibilities grew and with them the challenges of collecting payments. The global markets made open and the consumer gained an increased buying power. In local and international transaction merchants are required to provide consumers with multiple payment options - this is not only a service required by consumers, it is a must-have for merchants in order to convert their products/services into cash. Statistically, the more payment options a merchant is able to offer, the likelihood of reaching more consumers increases. The various payment methods available world-wide is overwhelming, nevertheless the payment methods available in a specific market are influenced by the local laws, legislations, culture and level of development. For merchants this creates a challenge of adapting their systems to accept a wide range of payment methods in order to enter a market with their offerings.  Split payment vs. Coupon  There are few models for split payment, some use the term for coupons or vouchers, when used to subsidies part of the full amount of payment. While this approach can be used for simplifying the concept, it is yet not what is meant by split payment. The major difference between split payment and coupons is in that coupons are used to discount the full a new amount of payment - which is later paid in full by a single payment method in a single transaction. A significant difference between a split payment implementation and a coupon implementation is the stage at which they appear during the checkout process. A coupon is implemented before the payment process, also referred to as the shopping cart. The split payment is implemented during the process of the checkout, usually one of the lasts steps.  Challenges  = Business challenges = The challenges for the business are all across the organization. It is mainly the accumulation and the reference of two separate transactions into a single order. What is in real-life trivial (the two payments come from the same hand) is for business processes a great challenge, and it is a bigger challenge when these transactions made on the Internet. The business challenges shy both small and large merchants from offering split payment. For example, Amazon mentions on their help pages that they do not allow split payments between a checking account and a gift card or credit card. = Technical challenges = The IT systems dealing with financial transactions process those transaction as atomic unit. Financial systems complete one transaction from beginning to end, a following transaction is therefore a totally new case. Combining the two transactions has impacts on costs, anti-fraud, reporting obligations (law & regulations) and might end up with partial information stored in the merchant system.

It expands on Peggy's rise in the workplace and the marital strife between Don and Betty Draper as Don's infidelities further intrude on his family life. The second season also introduces an unknown acquaintance, with whom Don is corresponding by letter in secret. The second season of Mad Men was met with critical acclaim: it was honored with the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series, the Golden Globe Award for Best Drama Series, and recognition by the American Film Institute, all for the second year in a row.

The Draper marriage seems to be on sturdier footing, while Peggy has returned to work. Joan and Roger have ended their romance. Betty has taken up horseback riding as a hobby and rebuffs the constant flirtations of a male fellow rider, Arthur Case. Sterling Cooper travels further into the \\"Pepsi Generation\\" as signing youth talent becomes a priority at the behest of \\"Duck\\" Phillips, Draper's choice as head of accounts from the previous year. Duck then convinces the firm to try and sign his old client, American Airlines, after the airline publicly announces a shift in marketing. Draper protests, as pitching for the project requires the firm to drop Mohawk Airlines, one of Draper's main clients. The American Airlines pitch fails, significantly harming Phillips' reputation at the firm and creating palpable tension with Draper. Joan, having been outed to her coworkers by Paul as being 31 years old, becomes engaged to medical resident Greg Harris, who ultimately rapes Joan inside Don's office prior to the couple's wedding. In spite of this, Joan remains with her fiancé. As fellow creative Freddy Rumsen devolves into alcoholism, Don has to step in to handle the obnoxious antics of his talent, comedian Jimmy Barrett, and ends up having an extramarital affair with Barrett's wife, Bobbie. Don's relationship with Bobbie is significantly more volatile than his past affairs. After Don discovers that Bobbie and other women around town have been discussing Don's sexual prowess, Don leaves her tied to a hotel bed in her lingerie. Later, a resentful Jimmy tells Betty about the affair, eventually causing her to kick Don out of the family home. Peggy, meanwhile, strikes up a courteous friendship with her priest, Father Gill. Peggy's sister tells Father Gill about Peggy's previous pregnancy during confession, which he subtly reveals to Peggy. Flashbacks to January 1961 reveal that Don was Peggy's only visitor at the hospital after her child was born. Don had convinced her to get out of the hospital and return to work, telling her, \\"This never happened. It will shock you how much it never happened.\\" After a short affair, Roger proposes to Jane Siegel, Draper's secretary, and ends his marriage with Mona, causing personal and (with a looming divorce) financial pressures in the partnership. Don takes a business trip to California during his exile from home. During this trip, he disappears, his whereabouts unknown both to his wife and children and his business associates, including Pete Campbell, whom he accompanied to California and whom he leaves at the hotel where they are staying. After spending a couple of days with a group of European tax exiles in Palm Springs, one of whom he beds, he ends up meeting with Anna Draper, the wife of the original Don Draper, whom he has set up in a bungalow in San Pedro. Anna comforts Don about his current marital troubles and identity crisis. Don returns home as the Cuban Missile Crisis begins. While Don is away, Roger bluntly informs Duck that a partnership is not forthcoming. Duck then meets with executives from his former London firm, Putnam, Powell & Lowe, who refuse to hire him. Duck, in desperation, informs them of Sterling Cooper's vulnerable position and pitches a buyout, with Duck being appointed President. PPL then offers the buyout to Bert and Roger, through Duck. Roger's looming divorce makes the sale especially enticing to him, and after discussions between Bert and his sister, who is revealed as a major partner in the firm, the buyout is accepted in Don's absence. Duck informs Pete that he plans to either have Draper follow his lead or be sent out the door, using the non- compete clause in Don's contract as leverage. In Don's absence, Peggy successfully brings in the Popsicle account and uses this as leverage to acquire Freddy Rumsen's old office. Pete is impressed by this maneuver and his romantic interests in Peggy are rekindled. Although married to Trudy, Pete professes his love for Peggy and tells her that he wishes he had married her instead. Peggy explains to Pete that she could have shamed him into marriage the year before. Pete doesn't understand what Peggy means, so Peggy finally confesses to Pete that he had gotten her pregnant and she had put their child up for adoption, a particularly galling development for Pete, since he and Trudy are so far unable to conceive. Pete also has a blue-blood abhorrence for adoption and now realizes his own blue-blood offspring is being raised by another family. When Don returns, Pete informs Don of Duck's plans. At the initial meeting with the lead SC and PPL executives, Draper informs them that he would not work under Duck's vision of the agency. After Duck directly challenges Don, Don informs him that he is not under any contract to the agency, to Duck's petulant surprise. Duck loses his temper, putting his promotion after the merger in question. Betty learns from her doctor that she is expecting another child. After subtle questions about abortion, the doctor chides her to keep the child. Betty has sex with a stranger at a local bar. She returns home to find a letter from Don, begging her to let him come home. The season closes as Betty informs him of their new child. They hold hands in the kitchen.

Reception  = Critical reception= The second season of Mad Men has received critical acclaim. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 100% of 26 critics have given the season a positive review. The site's consensus is: \\"The second season of Mad Men delves deeper into the personal lives of its characters without sacrificing the show's trademark droll humor and period atmosphere.\\" On Metacritic, the second season scored 88 out of 100 based on 20 reviews, indicating universal acclaim. Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote an extremely positive review, giving the second season four out of four stars and commenting that the series was at the \\"height of its powers\\" and \\"terrifically acted and gorgeously produced, this is a show that's both funny and frightening, that can simultaneously make you miss the '60s and feel blessed that they're gone.\\" Bianco concluded, \\"if this is the future of TV, the future's looking good.\\" The New York Times said Mad Men \\"is more than a period piece. It’s a sleek, hard-boiled drama with a soft, satirical core.\\" TIME said the series was better than other sixties-set series because the \\"characters do not stand in for Important Social Milestones. The changes in society serve to illustrate the characters, not the other way around. Don is right. In the end, no one is nostalgic for fashions or fads or furniture. We're nostalgic for people. And that, for all its sexy Eames-era perfection, is what Mad Men gives us.\\" The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette opined that the series was the \\"sophisticated heir\\" to The Sopranos and observed the historical authenticity of the series extends \\"to the characters, their reactions, their choices and the ways in which they relate to one another. It's a Mad Men hallmark that sets the show head and shoulders above its prime-time peers.\\" Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle said the series \\"reaffirm[s] its place in the upper echelon of television dramas. The writing is a real thing of beauty - from the aforementioned nuance to searing workplace witticisms and pitch-perfect tone from a multitude of characters. You can't overstate how accomplished Mad Men is at understanding the vagaries of dialogue among disparate characters.\\" Salon.com noted that the time period almost acts as an antagonist for the characters and that \\"what sets this drama apart from others is the complexity and depth of its themes beyond the obvious.\\" = Accolades = The second season of Mad Men was recognized with many award nominations and wins. At the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards, Mad Men won Outstanding Drama Series and Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series (Matthew Weiner and Kater Gordon for \\"Meditations in an Emergency\\"), both for the second year in a row.

Don and Sal then leave for a business trip to Baltimore, where Don cavorts with a flight attendant. Sal, meanwhile, has an intimate moment with their hotel's bellboy. After the fire alarm is set off, Don sees Sal with the young man. Don keeps it to himself, then pitches Sal a new advertising tagline, ostensibly for London Fog raincoats -- \\"Limit your exposure\\". Pete is offered the role of Head of Accounts by Lane Pryce, a PPL executive brought in from the London office. Pete is ecstatic until he learns that he will be sharing the title and the responsibility with Ken Cosgrove. At a country club party that Roger and Jane throw, Don and Betty both connect with strangers. Don strikes up a conversation with a man who turns out to be Conrad Hilton, founder of Hilton Hotels. Betty has a friendly conversation with an affable man named Henry Francis, who works for Governor Rockefeller. Roger, meanwhile, takes issue with his daughter, Margaret, who does not want her 20-year-old stepmother, Jane, at her wedding, scheduled for November 23, 1963. Betty's father Gene, suffering from his strokes, comes to live with the Drapers and strikes up a warm relationship with Sally, even teaching the young girl to drive. He is frustrated, though, by Betty not wanting to face up to the practical details of his death. Gene soon dies, and Sally scolds her parents and Betty's relatives for their apparent lack of grief at his demise. Betty gives birth to a boy, named Gene over Don's strenuous objections. Days before Joan's last day at the company, her husband Greg returns home drunk, telling her that he was passed over for an important promotion and that he has been unofficially blacklisted by his teachers from being a professional surgeon in New York City due to his subpar surgical skills, and demands she get another job. Executives from Putnam, Powell, and Lowe travel from London to tour the Sterling Cooper offices and to present a new organization plan that places the agency under a new up and comer, Guy MacKendrick, effectively sidelines Sterling and Cooper, and transfers Pryce to Bombay. After the announcement, Lois loses control of a John Deere tractor and runs over MacKendrick's foot. MacKendrick is presumed unable to perform his duties and Pryce is informed that he will keep his job in the States in the interim. Conrad Hilton starts harassing Don with late night phone calls, seeking off the books help with regard to advertising for his companies. Don finds it both flattering and overwhelming, as he struggles to create quality material. When Connie learns Don has no contract tying him to the agency, Cooper uses his knowledge of Don's assumed identity to pressure him into signing a contract so as to retain Hilton's interest. Betty enlists Henry's help with a neighborhood petition, and becomes smitten with him. She begins sending him letters and meeting with him in secret. Elsewhere, Don begins having an affair with Suzanne Farrell, Sally's teacher. During this period, Duck Phillips tempts both Pete and Peggy with business overtures to entice them to come to work with him at Grey; while neither accepts the business proposition, Peggy does accept Duck's initiation of a sexual relationship with her. While on a shoot for a Lucky Strike commercial, Lee Garner, Jr., makes a sexual advance toward Sal. Sal refuses, causing Lee to call Sterling Cooper and demand his firing. Roger instantly fires Sal due to Lucky Strike's importance with the company. When Sal goes to Don for help, Don expresses little sympathy. Betty breaks into the drawer to the desk in Don's den. She finds his box of Dick Whitman's family photos as well as evidence of Anna Draper's existence and Don's divorce from her. She confronts him. Don is forced to divulge the secret of his former identity and his desertion in Korea. Pete becomes despondent when alerted by Lane Pryce that Ken is to become Senior Vice President in charge of Account Services. The news of the assassination of John F. Kennedy hits the day before Roger's daughter gets married. Pete is adamant about leaving the agency and mourns Kennedy on the couch with his wife. Greg informs Joan that he is enlisting to become an Army surgeon. When Betty is confronted with the lies her husband has told her regarding his identity and infidelities as well as her own growing attraction towards Henry, things come to a head with the Drapers following the assassination of the president. Don's inability to connect to Betty's emotional grief over the death of the President leads Betty to tell Don that she doesn't love him anymore and that she wants a divorce. Connie meets with Don to inform him that Sterling Cooper and PPL both are being bought out by McCann Ericson, the firm handling Hilton's other accounts. Infuriated, Don returns to the office and begins hatching plans with Cooper and Sterling to buy the company. When their offer is rebuffed, Don realizes that Lane's authority to fire the other conspirators would sever their contracts, giving them the ability to walk away and start a new advertising agency. Lane agrees with the scheme and becomes a partner. Don and Roger start reaching out to other employees to join their new agency, including Pete and Peggy. While drinking with Sterling, Don learns about Betty's relationship with Henry Francis and confronts her physically. However, Don later calls Betty and tells her that he will not fight the divorce. Betty leaves with the baby and Henry to get a divorce in Reno. Don, Peggy, Roger, Bert, Lane and Pete subsequently break into the Sterling Cooper office to take necessary supplies and files. Joan and Harry are soon called in to join the company and help them. The group meets in a small hotel room, where Joan answers calls with the name of the new firm: Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.

Lisa Albert remained supervising producer and wrote one episode. Writing team Andre Jacquemetton and Maria Jacquemetton became consulting producers and co-wrote one episode together. Robin Veith was promoted to executive story editor and wrote one episode. Kater Gordon was promoted to staff writer and wrote two episodes.

Reception =Critical reception= The third season of Mad Men has received critical acclaim. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 96% of 26 critics have given the season a positive review. The site's consensus is: \\"Mad Men brilliantly weaves its characters into its historical setting, and the result is thoughtful, shocking, and terrifically entertaining.\\" On Metacritic, the third season scored 87 out of 100 based on 20 reviews, indicating universal acclaim. Time critic James Poniewozik cited the show's excellence in writing and acting, and said \\"Mad Men's willingness to let moments play out seems as much a period flourish as its fedoras and highballs.\\" Of the third season, Poniewozik felt that the third season was \\"a notch behind season 1 and ahead of season 2. It didn’t have the phenomenal run of one staggering episode and scene after another like the first did, but this season built confidently to a climax and did an outstanding job of both capturing the sweep of history and how it related to the characters’ lives.\\" Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle warned viewers from falling for any inevitable backlash after the myriad of award wins for the series, saying that \\"the humor, the note-perfect clothing and sets, the creeping cultural change - are still there to be savored. But what the series traffics in with astute complexity is the troubling notion of self, of identity, of rootless, undefined purpose and unrealized happiness\\". Goodman also noted that the series was not made for a mass audience. Robert Bianco of USA Today said the third season was compelling because \\"we all know the late- stage Camelot universe the characters occupy is about to shatter\\" and that the series was filled with \\"madness and passion\\". Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times described Mad Men as \\"essentially one long flashback, an artfully imagined historic re-enactment of an era when America was a soaring superpower feeling its first shivers of mortality.\\" Robert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times said the series was \\"a moral drama, a show about deciding who you are and who you want to be, of character as the sum of small choices. There are no heroes or villains here, only people working out or being carried toward their individual destinies. And in who we root for and in what we root for them to choose, we also define ourselves.\\" In one of the few negative reviews, Hank Stuever of The Washington Post said that Mad Men \\"has importance sickness, and its idea of levity is to inject moments of utter callousness.\\" Stuever lamented that once \\"a TV show was just a TV show. It was on when it was on; if you missed it, you missed it. You certainly wouldn't build your life around talking about it or telling other grownups they had to watch old episodes of it in order to catch up. You were supposed to give it two seconds' thought.\\" Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said that by the end of the season \\"we've crossed a generational line in the series. Kennedy is dead. The Beatles fly into New York in a few months. The '50s are definitively over, and what we think of as the actual '60s is just beginning.\\" =Accolades= The third season continued Mad Men's streak of award wins and nominations at the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards.

The article is to promote the new Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce advertising agency which, despite its status as the scrappy newcomer, is struggling. The article's finished product does not go over well, making Don look like a cipher. Don comes back from this public relations disaster by cavalierly throwing a client out of his office after they show concern about his supposedly risque advertising pitch. The main narrative of the fourth season is driven by Don Draper's identity crisis after the dissolution of his marriage to Betty. As Don falls deeper into existential despair, his alcoholism worsens and he begins regularly meeting with prostitutes. Don's life is falling apart. He snaps at his maid. He meets with a prostitute over the holidays. He is dismissive toward his blind date. He sleeps with his well-meaning secretary Allison – breaking his own rules and her heart – and she eventually quits in a flurry of anguish and resentment. His relationship with Betty is toxic, and she makes it hard for him to see his children. He is drinking more than ever before; frequently, he blacks out. He makes a trip out to California to see Anna Draper and meets her niece, Stephanie. After he tries to seduce her, Stephanie tearfully tells Don that Anna is dying of cancer, a fact her family has hidden from Anna thus far. Don, unable to spend time with Anna knowing she is going to die, tells her he will return to California soon with his kids, knowing that it's a lie. Sally is having a difficult time at the Francis home. After a friend's mother catches Sally masturbating at a sleepover, Betty demands that Sally be sent to therapy despite Don's protestations. Sally's therapist offers comfort to Sally but additionally spends a significant amount of time analyzing Betty. Pete and Peggy seem to be going off on different cultural paths. Pete accepts fatherhood when Trudy gives birth to a baby girl. Peggy, meanwhile, makes friends with a group of beatniks, including Joyce, a lesbian photo editor at Life magazine and Abe, a liberal writer whom she starts to date. However, Peggy's relationship with Don becomes frayed after Don wins a prestigious award for a commercial whose success largely depended on Peggy. When Don causes Peggy to miss her own surprise birthday party (arranged by boyfriend Mark) in order to work on a presentation for Samsonite suitcases, the tension comes to a head. Nevertheless, the tension is defused when a drunk Duck (still longing for Peggy) shows up and punches Don after assuming the two are lovers. That night, Don and Peggy fall asleep on the couch in Don's office, and Don has a vision of a spectral Anna Draper carrying a suitcase. Anna's ghost simply smiles and walks out of the office. Don having received an urgent message from Stephanie the day prior, returns this call after waking up, who confirms that Anna Draper has indeed died. After hanging up the phone, Don turns to Peggy and breaks down in tears. Peggy comforts Don, and the two hold hands in an act of friendship. After Anna's death, Don cuts down on his drinking and is shown to be increasingly introspective; he begins to keep a journal and exercise regularly. He asks Faye Miller, a consultant at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce, out on a formal date. The two become involved in a relationship. Around the same time, Roger and Joan have sex after getting mugged in a poor neighborhood. Joan becomes pregnant and decides to pass the child off as Greg's rather than take Roger's money for an abortion. At the agency, Roger loses the Lucky Strike account, putting the financial security of the entire company in jeopardy. Don worries about his secret after FBI agents come to the Francis home to question Betty about Don. The interrogation turns out to be a routine response to any requests for security clearance at North American Aviation, the application for which was submitted by Pete and Don's new secretary Megan Calvet. Don forces Pete to drop the aforementioned client in order to prevent any discovery of his identity theft. Furthermore, he confesses his secret to Faye, who advises Don to come clean about his past to the authorities rather than continue living in fear. Don distances himself in response to this as well as her proclamation that she cannot see herself as a mother to Don's children. He later discovers that his past mistress (from season one), Midge Daniels, is now in the throes of heroin addiction. In order to put a positive spin on being dropped from Lucky Strike (and perhaps partly motivated by Midge's desperation and inner destruction), Don writes an Op Ed in The New York Times proclaiming to the nation that Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce is taking a healthful stand and, from here on out, will no longer be doing business with Big Tobacco. The sensational move does not go over well with the other SCDP employees, except Megan, who admires it. In October 1965, Don takes his kids on a trip to California (with Megan in tow) and stops by Anna Draper's home, now occupied by Stephanie. Sally notices a message painted on the wall (\\"Dick + Anna 64\\") and asks Don who Dick is. Don responds: \\"That's me\\", and brushes the question off by claiming it's his nickname. Over the course of the weekend, Don decides that he is in love with Megan and proposes to her the morning after their return. Peggy and Ken, meanwhile, save the company by signing new work with Topaz Pantyhose. Betty and Henry move out of the Drapers' Ossining home after Betty fires their nanny/housekeeper over her refusal to help Betty break up the budding friendship between Sally and Glen, a neighborhood boy who warns Sally of the dangers of parents who remarry. Don announces the news of his engagement to Megan to the office and, later, over the phone to Faye, who is left in tears. Don returns to the Draper home one last time to say goodbye to Betty, who shows signs of regret towards the ending of their marriage as they leave their former home for the last time. They depart through separate exits. The season closes with Don lying awake with Megan, looking out toward the window. Episodes Production =Crew= Series creator Matthew Weiner also served as showrunner and executive producer, and is credited as a writer on 10 of the 13 episodes of the season, often co-writing the episodes with another writer. Lisa Albert became consulting producer and co-wrote one episode. Writing team Andre Jacquemetton and Maria Jacquemetton were promoted to co-executive producers and co-wrote one episode together. Erin Levy was promoted to staff writer and wrote two episodes. Dahvi Waller was promoted to producer and wrote one episode. Brett Johnson was promoted to staff writer and wrote one episode. New writers in the fourth season included consulting producer Janet Leahy, who co- wrote one episode; producer Jonathan Abrahams, who wrote two episodes; co- producer Keith Huff, who co-wrote one episode; and freelance writers Tracy McMillan and Jonathan Igla, who each co-wrote one episode. Other producers included Blake McCormick, Dwayne Shattuck, and executive producer Scott Hornbacher. Phil Abraham directed the most episodes of the season with three, while Jennifer Getzinger, Michael Uppendahl, and series star John Slattery each directed two. The remaining episodes were directed by Lesli Linka Glatter, Scott Hornbacher, Lynn Shelton, and Matthew Weiner, who directs each season finale. Reception =Critical reception= The fourth season of Mad Men received widespread critical acclaim. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 97% of 35 critics have given the season a positive review. The site's consensus is: \\"While Mad Men continues to darken in tone, it remains one of the most provocative, intelligent shows on television.\\" On Metacritic, the fourth season scored 92 out of 100 based on 30 reviews, indicating universal acclaim; it has the highest score of all Mad Men seasons. Robert Bianco of USA Today said that the series was \\"adept at changing course without diminishing its appeal or fundamentally altering its core\\". Maureen Ryan said that \\"the season was really, in the end, all about who Don Draper was and what he felt comfortable sharing, if not in interviews, in life. And it was hard not to root for Don once he'd found happiness\\", yet noted that season 4 was strong because of the focus on Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. She also said that \\"The season began with a reporter asking, \\"Who is Don Draper?\\" He is, if nothing else, loved. And that's a far cry from the man we met in season 1, who wasn't truly known by anyone, except perhaps Anna.\\" Alan Sepinwall of HitFix felt that the fourth season was one of the strongest years, saying \\"this was a very different season for the show, but no less compelling. If anything, that off-kilter quality led to some of the show's best episodes ever, like \\"The Suitcase\\". Mad Men seasons often seem to need a handful of episodes to ramp up, but here all we really needed was the expository premiere, and we were off to the races after that. Great show. Great season.\\" The A.V. Club writer Keith Phipps considered it the best season of the series so far, noting that \\"Matthew Weiner knows every rule of creating tense, dramatic story arcs and then willfully ignores them. Happily, his subversive tendencies have their own sort of satisfaction.\\" Keith also observed that the best episodes of the season were light on plot, praising the \\"ruminative depth\\" of \\"mood pieces\\" like \\"The Good News\\" and \\"The Suitcase\\". James Poniewozik of Time magazine said that Season 4 was the second-best season, slotting in just behind the first season, saying that \\"I think that a season that started strong—and had, through its middle, perhaps its best run of episodes ever—seemed to lose a bit of focus and momentum in its last third.\\" Heather Havrilesky of Salon said that during the fourth season, \\"The central identity parable of Mad Men, which seemed like a simple act of deception in the first few seasons, has deepened into something richer and more ominous. Don Draper reflects the American compulsion to sidestep the hard work of living a flawed but authentic life for the empty illusion of perfection, as shiny and skin-deep as an advertisement that promises the impossible.\\" Eric Deggans of the Tampa Bay Times said that \\"I have been told by much more accomplished storytellers than myself that this season was among the series' best. But I have been deeply ambivalent about the episodes\\". Deggans also criticized the lack of focus on race, as well as the show's attempts at unpredictability, comparing it to The Sopranos. He did, however, praise the character development of Peggy Olson. =Accolades= The fourth season was celebrated with 19 nominations at the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards (the most nominations the series has ever received from the Emmys), as well as many other industry honors.

His net worth is at least £606 million according to the 2020 Sunday Times Rich List. He was 43rd in the 2019 Sunday Times Giving List, the annual ranking of the UK's most generous millionaires. Early life Leopold Noé was born in August 1953. He is the son of fellow property developer Salomon Noé (sometimes Solomon Noé, born December 1930). Both of Noe’s parents were in Auschwitz concentration camp before being liberated in 1944 and making their way to London. Career Noé is executive chairman and founder of the Noé Group and latterly non-executive chairman of BMO Real Estate Partners. The Noé Group announced its first deal in December 2017, the sale of the Debenhams department store building in Manchester, for £87m. Also in December 2017, the Noé Group’s real estate business, Capreon, acquired De Haagsche Zwaan (The Swan) office block in The Hague from Union Investment. He joined the BMO REP board on completion of the F&C;/REIT merger in September 2008, having previously been founder and chairman of REIT Asset Management where he was responsible for overall strategy and client liaison. In March 2017, Noé and Ivor Smith sold their aggregate 30% interest in BMO REP to F&C; Asset Management plc (part of BMO Global Asset Management and an existing 70% Partner). With effect from August 2017, the UK Value Add assets that include contracts for the management of Noé family trust assets will return to Noé and his family. The Noé family trust assets in Germany will remain under the management of BMO REP in Munich. Noé established Lee Baron Commercial Limited, a firm of property consultants with a wide range of clients, where he still holds the position of non-executive director, and was chief executive of Bourne End Properties PLC between 1989 and 1997, a listed property investment company where his family trusts were the main shareholders. Noé's British- Israel company, F&C; REIT, is now the largest owner of shopping malls in Israel with a €1.5bn (£1.2bn) portfolio. REIT Israel Group (formerly Azorim Properties) owns a $20 million 11,000 square-meter shopping center at the entrance to Nahariya.Steinberg, J. (2006) In war and peace, they keep investing in Israel International Herald Tribune. September 12, 2006 Noe was the lead buyer in an attempted takeover of Shufersal, buying Nochi Dankner's majority stake in the business. The merging of Reit's £3.45bn portfolio with F&C;’s £5.2bn property arm has diversified Noe's business away from family trusts and private cash to more institutional sources of equity. His companies operate in India, South America and Africa, and Europe. In February 2018, Noé received a lifetime achievement award from UK Israel Business at its annual awards ceremony. He is the owner of Jewish News. Personal life Noé lives in London. His sons Zvi and Raphael work for Capreon, a property group owned by the Noé Group. His daughter Shevi is married to David Bloom, who runs Goldacre Ventures, a private equity group, which is now part of the Noé Group. Philanthropic work Primarily through the Rachel Charitable Trust, Noé is a philanthropist and benefactor to various charities in the UK and Israel and a trustee and patron to a number of education and welfare institutions. Noé was a member of the UK government's Holocaust Commission and a member of the Jewish Leadership Council's Commission on Jewish Schools and chairman of its Schools Strategy Implementation Group (SSIG). He is an active participant in education strategy and planning projects, with a particular and keen interest in Special Needs Education in both the UK and Israel. Noé was instrumental in securing SEN as a specialism under the schools funding programme and has committed his time and energy to SEN within the Jewish Community and to over 50 SEN schools outside of the Jewish Community. While the Rachel Charitable Trust lists some beneficiaries in its accounts, it charges £25 for a full list of the organisations it supports, an unorthodox arrangement among UK foundations.http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Accounts/Ends41/0000276441_AC_20180630_E_C.PDF Noé has been a trustee of Kisharon since 1998. Kisharon is a London-based charity founded in 1976 which provides innovative support to children with complex learning disabilities, their families, teachers and other professionals. Noé established the Kemach Foundation in 2007, based on the belief that for the Haredi community to become part of Israeli economic society and for Israeli society to accept the Haredi community, they have to integrate into the workforce. It has become the premier agency for higher education and employment for the Haredi community throughout Israel, supporting 29,000 Haredi men and women as of January 2018. Noé's philanthropic approach is based on education, training and collaboration, aiming to create employment opportunities, encourage tolerance and build sustainable communities. Noé was a speaker at the Accelerate Conference in New York in December 2015. His speech is here. In January 2016, Noé was reappointed Vice- President and Treasurer of the Jewish Leadership Council (JLC) In April 2017, he was named at number 64 on the Sunday Times Giving list ranking the top 100 charitable contributors in the UK, having donated around £7.8m during the previous year, details here *As Treasurer of Jewish Leadership Council, oversaw 8-fold increase in individual donations in 2016 compared to 2015. *Rachel Charitable Trust, benefactor to various charities within the UK and Israel. *Special Educational Needs (SEN) in both the UK and Israel. *Pledged £750,000 in 2005 to special-needs education in the UK. *Kemach Foundation: \\"...to help Haredi students sustain themselves in dignity.

Wheeler) (1936-2018) was a British writer. His debut novel The Conjunction set in India was shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1970. He published two other novels, From Home in Heaven (1971) also set in India and The Wreck of the Rat Trap (1973) set in Portsmouth where he grew up. He wrote two screen plays titled Spice Island, Farewell and Brent Geese both of which were broadcast by the BBC in the nineteen seventies.Google Books search He also wrote short stories two of which \\"The Philadelphia Connection\\" and \\"Safe Wintering\\" were published by Macmillan in their annual collection Winter's Tales (1979 and 1981 respectively). Terence Wheeler, 1973 (photo by Tom Parker) He lived in Whitstable, Kent and died on 25 December 2018 at the age of 82.Terence \\"Terry\\" WHEELER  Early life and education  Wheeler was born in Portsmouth, England in 1936. His parents were Eddie and Florrie Wheeler and he had a brother Barry. Eddie was a worker in Portsmouth dockyard and joined the Marines in 1941. As a naval dockyard, Portsmouth was subjected to heavy bombing during the war. To escape the bombs, Florrie evacuated the two brothers to comparatively rural Waterlooville. Wheeler's experiences during the war years would form the basis for his third novel, The Wreck of the Rat Trap. 270x270px Despite being active and staunch Marxists, Eddie and Florrie sent Wheeler to a Roman Catholic primary school where they thought he would get a good education. The dissonance between the Marxism of home and the traditional Catholic doctrine of school was intense for him. Nonetheless, he excelled, passed his eleven-plus exam and progressed to a local grammar school. The years at grammar school were happy and productive thanks to the influence of his charismatic English master who fired his love of literature and enabled him to gain a place at Oxford to read English. The public school culture of Oxford was a shock for the boy from Portsmouth. However, he immersed himself into the world of the University Dramatic Society. His time at Oxford cemented his love of words and language and his practical knowledge of the theatre. Wheeler graduated from Oxford and took up his first teaching post at a comprehensive school in Holloway. Whilst at Oxford, Wheeler met Sara Tooze whom he married in 1959. Their marriage would last nearly 60 years and together they would have a son and two daughters. Sara, an artist trained at Goldsmiths College of Art in London, would design the covers of two of Wheeler's books.  India  Shortly after his marriage to Sara and keen to broaden their horizons, Wheeler found a job in Buenos Aires only to receive a message just before they set sail saying, \\"There's been a revolution. Job not available.\\" Wheeler celebrating Holi, the festival of colour, with some of the boys he taught in Pilani, India (circa 1961). Undeterred, Wheeler then found a 3-year teaching post at Pilani Public School in the middle of the Rajastan desert in North India. They (with their new born daughter, Rachel) set sail for Bombay (now Mumbai). During their time in India, Wheeler came to see that the anti-colonialist Marxism of his upbringing was in contrast to the influence of the British Raj - the legal system, education, railway infrastructure and even the medical and educational work of the missionaries. His observations prompted him to write his first novel, The Conjunction. The book tells of a divided man educated in India and England and facing discordant world views: traditional Hindu caste attitudes and modern democratic ones, superstitions about pollution and purity against modern medical views. The book was shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1970. Another novel From Home in Heaven also set in India followed in 1971.  America  On returning to England, Wheeler held various teaching posts before taking up a position in 1968 at the then new Christ Church College, Canterbury founded to train Anglican teachers. There he lectured in 18th century and later modern literature. The family had by now moved to Whitstable \\"because it was the cheapest place in England\\". There Wheeler became heavily involved in amateur dramatics directing many productions from Restoration Comedy to Gorky. In 1974 Wheeler took up a one-year exchange lectureship at Villanova University in Philadelphia. Wheeler departed England again with Sara and now their three children (Rachel, Charlotte and Matthew). At the end of the year (and as a result of a wager) Wheeler took the family on a month long road trip from Philadelphia to Mexico City camping all the way and listening to John Denver singing Take Me Home, Country Roads on the radio. Wheeler relished encountering characters on the journey such as a Louisiana peanut farmer who invited them to shell a pan of nuts. The trip inspired his short stories. Macmillan published two of these in their prestigious annual collections by leading authors called Winter's Tales. The first, \\"The Philadelphia Connection\\" in 1979 and the second \\"Safe Wintering\\" in 1981. His fellow contributors to Winter's Tales included Martin Amis, John Wain and Fay Weldon.  Later life  In 1982, Wheeler stopped writing altogether, partly due to his growing administrative duties as a lecturer. But also, he said, “It just didn’t seem important any more”. He remained a lecturer at Christ Church College (now a university) until retirement. In retirement, he devoted himself to animal welfare, collecting for and assisting at local animal sanctuaries.

(March 10, 1937 in Hyderabad, India - January 31, 2011 in Toronto, Canada) was an Indo-Canadian Urdu scholar, writer and politician. He emigrated from India and settled in Canada. He was a writer and columnist for Paaras, a monthly bilingual Urdu and English family magazine. Early life and education The son of Abdul Jabbar, a math teacher at Osmania University, Razaul Jabbar suffered from Infantile Paralysis of both his hands and legs at the age of one, which later continued to partially paralyse his neck and back. He gained some strength in his hands later in life, but his but legs remained paralyzed for life. Jabbar's father played an important part in Jabbar's early home education. Due to the lack of rehabilitation facilities during his childhood, Jabbar's early life was challenging. Wheelchairs were not common in India, so he faced many problems in school and college. He started writing from an early age to vent his emotions. This hobby later came became a job. While in a Mumbai hospital, Jabbar submitted three stories to a story-writing contest for a newspaper. The editors of the paper were so surprised at the quality of the submissions that they visited the hospital themselves. Winning the contest drove Jabbar to write articles for Indian and American newspapers. Jabbar received a Bachelor of Commerce and Master of Commerce from Osmania University in Hyderabad and became a Chartered Accountant. He received a Bachelor of Laws from Bombay University and, in his retirement, he was working on taking courses towards equivalency of a Law degree at the University of Toronto. He married Zarina Rangwala in 1967. They later had a son and daughter, along with six grandchildren. He has a brother living in Toronto and in Australia and one sister in India and Australia. He also has an extended family of first cousins in Canada, India, and Pakistan. Migration In the late 1970s, Jabbar visited Canada to attend an international conference for the disabled in Winnipeg. He was taken back by the civilized atmosphere of the country, and decided to settle in Ontario. He saw Canada as a gift for individuals with disabilities to reach their potentials; nevertheless, he faced systemic and attitudinal barriers with regards to his qualifications in his early career. Career Jabbar struggled through his Charted Accountancy exams due to the disfigurement of his forearm and hands. He was unable to finish the exams in a timely manner to receive the passing grade. This was due to lack of awareness and accommodation that he needed due to his weak grip. When he became a Charted Accountant in Mumbai, he worked for a shipping firm called Mazgon Dock (Ship builders) for ten years while he was a part-time professor at the Burhani commerce college. He resided in Andheri East in Mumbai, India. He continued his writing from India for Urdu magazines. He was also approached by Bollywood for potential film stories and Urdu dialogues.

According to the Census in 2001, a total number of 17,692 people claimed themselves to be Slovaks in Hungary. The total number of people who can speak the Slovak language is 56,107. According to the estimates of minority organisations, there are about 100,000-110,000 people with Slovak ancestry in Hungary. Hence, the estimated population of Slovaks in Hungary is ranging from 0.18% to 1.1% of the total population of Hungary. History = Early Middle Ages = The presence of the Slovak ethnicity in the territory of present-day Hungary dates back to the Middle Ages. In the 9th-10th century, the Slavic-populated territories were part of the Great Moravia. Subsequently, in the 9th century these areas were included into the Principality of Hungary out of which the Kingdom of Hungary emerged in AD 1000. = Renaissance = In the 16th century, after the Battle of Mohács during the Turkish wars, the Kingdom of Hungary was split into three parts and the Slovak-populated regions mostly became part of the Habsburg controlled Royal Hungary. After the Ottomans were defeated in the end of the 17th century, all Slovak-populated areas were included into the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary. At that time, Slovaks mainly lived in the northern parts of the country, often referred to as Upper Hungary (today mostly Slovakia). = Age of Enlightenment = In the 18th and 19th century, some Slovak migrants started to settle in other counties (in the northern parts of present-day Hungary) and developed strong mutual language contact with the Hungarians and later also settled in the some southern regions. Following a period of Slovak demand for autonomy within Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary, conflicts between Slovaks and Hungarians arose. = After the Treaty of Trianon = According to the Treaty of Trianon from 1920, most of the Slovak-speaking territories of the pre-war Kingdom of Hungary were recognized as part of Czechoslovakia. Some Slovaks, however, remained within the borders of post-Trianon Hungary. According to Austro-Hungarian data from 1900 there was 192,200 Slovaks in the territory of present-day Hungary (2.8% of total population). According to the Hungarian census, 141,882 people spoke Slovak in 1920. = After World War II = The Czechoslovak–Hungarian population exchange that took place after 1920 was repeated after World War II when about 73,000 Slovaks resettled from Hungary to Slovakia.

This species is one of the most succulent and xerophytic, but at the same time one of the most attractive species of Tradescantia. It is endemic to dry areas of the State of Nuevo León in northeastern Mexico.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant FamiliesCONABIO. 2009. Catálogo taxonómico de especies de México. 1. In Capital Nat. México. CONABIO, Mexico D.F.. Description This plant has a very recognizable and distinctive appearance. The leaves are arranged in a precise geometric shape. Almost completely white hairs cover all parts of the plant: leaves, shoots, and even the buds. These protect the plant from direct sunlight and excessive evaporation. Shoots and stems reach a height of 30–40 cm, first erect, later prostrate and rooting at the soil surface. The leaves are fleshy, ovate, 3–7 cm long, covered with grayish-white short hairs. During the summer, the flowers appear at apical growth points or in the axils of the bracts; these are typical Tradescantia flowers. The corolla consists of three bright purplish-pink to purple petals and three small sepals. In culture Tradescantia sillamontana is almost as easy to grow as other species of the genus Tradescantia. However, unlike most species of Tradescantia, this species is almost succulent and nearly xerophytic. (Perhaps the only more xerophytic and succulent member of the genus is Tradescantia navicularis.) T. sillamontana should be grown in a well lit position, although direct summer sun can cause burns, so gradual acclimatization is needed.Hermann Jacobsen. Sukkulenten Das lexicon. VEB Gustav Fischer Verlag Jena. 2.Auflage, 1981. While it is native to arid areas of Mexico, it does best with roughly 30 inches of water per year. https://www.highcountrygardens.com/perennial-plants/unique- plants/tradescantia-sillamontana-cobweb-spiderwort. It will go dormant in cooler desert winters. Flowering in summer is quite abundant, if well- cultivated. The plant quickly loses its desirable appearance with excessive watering, too dark a location, and an excess of nitrogen. Spraying the leaves is not recommended at all. Soil should allow good drainage, with at least a third to a half made up of coarse sand and gravel. Moderate watering is required during the growing season; the plant should be kept almost dry in winter maintenance. The minimum temperature during the period of dormancy is 10 °C. The plant can be divided in Spring, with any shoots which are too long being trimmed.Gardeners' Encyclopedia of Plants & Flowers. – Dorling Kindersley Limited, London, 1995. In the subtropical zone this is one of the most popular garden plants. In Europe it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and rock gardens, but in the winter it is brought into a cool greenhouse or protected from cold and moisture with a temporary shelter. Reproduction is easy by cuttings 5–8 cm long, rooted in sandy soil, or by dividing and transplanting the bush.Cacti and other succulents. Teresa M.

In September 2017 Almaty Management University (AlmaU) opened the Knowledge Building - a new intellectual innovation building. The new building of AlmaU, built using the latest technology, is probably the most ambitious project in the field of education. Modern infrastructure, including coworking centers, food courts, places for relaxation, conference rooms, modern laboratories, classrooms; beautiful design, versatility, innovation and convenience in everything are the main criteria which the developers of this building of the southern capital were guided by. On the 1st floor there is Atrium Grand Hall for 600 seats with a huge LED display and professional acoustic and lighting equipment, and a reading room with a book-crossing sector and a cafe with flavorous coffee. On the 2nd floor there are student classrooms, a relaxation room and 4 laboratories: “Petroleum Transportation Lab” Laboratory of School of Economics and Logistics (General sponsor - Petroleum LLP). Creation of “PetroleumTransportLab” laboratory is one of the key steps towards implementation of a number of projects: creation of a transport hub, logistics outsourcing, development of transport services, operator and forwarding business, etc. Neuromarketing Laboratory of Graduate School of Management (Magnum Cash and Carry helped to purchase equipment for this laboratory) is equipped with a video camera, microphone and Tobii Glasses 2 mobile eye tracking system, which provides objective data on consumers' perceptions of various trademarks and brands and reveals hidden factors affecting decision making process. Using this technology, it is possible to study the visual perception of consumers when making a purchase decision. The laboratory allows to conduct applied research using neurobiological analysis tools and expert opinions for business. This project has no analogues in the Republic of Kazakhstan. Simulation room of Center for Mediation and Center of Excellence is equipped with four video cameras, microphones and voice recorders. It is used to resolve disputable situations and conflicts that may arise in the educational process, for example, between a student and a teacher (student and management, employee and manager, etc.). Situations are played in the simulation room, audio and video recording is conducted, which makes it possible to analyze the process. The room is also used for conducting research with participation of focus groups, and conducting in-depth interviews with possibility to observe the process from the adjacent sector: whether the methodology is not violated, whether there is no pressure on respondents. The oratory workshop of Graduate School of State and Public Administration and Law is a mirror room equipped with a video camera for recording and analyzing the speaker's speeches. A photograph of a listening audience on the wall creates an atmosphere of real-life performance. In the course of trainings, the psychological barrier is overcome, communication and oratorical skills are developed. The workshop is aimed at shaping the culture of public speaking: the conceptual apparatus, wide vocabulary range, techniques of verbal and non- verbal communication, as well as presentation and self-presentation skills. On the 3rd floor of Knowledge Building there are classrooms of Graduate School of Business equipped with a smart system, in particular, MBA programs and doctoral programs, as well as the classroom of MBA Association, whose accreditation is got by Almaty Management University (AlmaU), the only university in Kazakhstan and Central Asia, in the list of the top 200 best universities in the world. On the 4th floor there are 3 laboratories: DesignLab Laboratory of Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation Development, is equipped with a sound system and a projector, glass boards for design processes, as well as tools and accessories for creating and modeling prototypes. In the process of working in the laboratory, students and trainees perform dozens of practical tasks, simulating prototypes of business processes on their own - this is how fast experience is formed, practicing thinking and various methods of working with the project are applied in order to find their own ways of solving creative problems. The value of design thinking for business is that this technique allows to work with “implicit knowledge” of the consumer, which he cannot recognize and tell on his own. That, ultimately, allows you to get products and services that are focused on people. Cyber- Polygon \\"EngEkon\\" Laboratory of the School of Economics and Logistics (general sponsor is Kazakhstan GIS Center JSC, Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Kazakhstan) is considered to be the brightest laboratory. Its walls are painted in three different colors: red, green and blue, the laboratory is equipped with 4 displays, 7 computers, a projector, an audio system. As planned by the authors of the project, two opposing forces are involved in the simulation: the attacker, occupying the red corner, is trying to make a hole in the system; defenders, sitting opposite the screen in the green zone, use preventive methods to isolate the attack. Each side has 3 computers. The blue zone is the zone of observers, where the overall picture of the unfolding battle between “hackers” and “Information Security” (IS) is visible on the display. The purpose of the cyber-test site is to teach students to counteract cyber-terrorism, preventing hacking of databases and data leakage. MediaLab Center for Multimedia Journalism of Graduate School of State and Public Administration and Law is equipped with a projector, computers and a voice recorder. It is an open working media space operating on the principle of dual education. A feature of the project is the working format of the center: students under the supervision of mentors initiate their own topics independently and in project groups and experiment with the production of various content, as well as learn how to work in social networks and how to create and maintain their own brand. It is important: MediaLab helps not only to students-journalists and PR specialists, but works “at the junction”, teaching economists, financiers, and logisticians to create media content. On the 5th floor there are administration offices, equipped with smart systems, student classrooms, meeting room of AlmaU Board of Trustees. On the 6th floor, visitors will see “SMART-conference hall”, where it is possible to control light, sound, air conditioning, a projector, roll-up curtains from the iPad; Also, guests can view the magnificent panorama of the mountains from the windows of Panorama Hall. All the laboratories of the new building, whose construction was financed by Capital Bank Kazakhstan, are equipped with innovative technologies and work together with the partners of the university - government agencies, business structures, media companies. It is this format that allows the university to implement the principle of Win-Win-Win, according to which any mutually beneficial cooperation between the two parties (Win-Win) should be of benefit to a third party - society (Win). It is also an excellent example of successful implementation of the “triple spiral” theory, the essence of which is in dynamic development of relations between the state, universities and business for effective development of new industries and solving existing problems. It is worth noting that the new building will be managed in a new way. It is facilitated by the knowledge management system launched at AlmaU. Created to improve university management efficiency, the Knowledge Management System processes large streams of information (BIG DATA), integrates various information systems, and automates business processes.

In October 1935, he took a position in the public prosecutor's office of the Kammergericht. Erich Koch wanted Vollmer back in East Prussia and had already tried to get him returned to Königsberg. In summer 1937, Koch won Göring's approval to have Vollmer returned to Königsberg and the Reich Ministry of Justice named Vollmer general state attorney (Generalstaatsanwalt) in Königsberg on December 1, 1937. He began work on January 5, 1938. He later became a Ministerial Director. Koch was of the opinion that Vollmer (and others) were beholden to him for their careers and should therefore be obedient to him.Ralf Meindl: Ostpreußens Gauleiter.

He was a son of Count Edzard II of East Frisia and Princess Katarina of Sweden, and a younger brother of Count Enno III of East Frisia. John married in 1601 with Sabina Catherine, the daughter of his brother Enno III. Under the Treaty of Berum, Sabina Catherine had been awarded the County of Rietberg, which her mother Walburgis had brought into the Cirksena family. John had converted to the Roman Catholic faith at an early age, and needed papal dispensation to marry his niece. Sabina Catherine converted to Catholicism in 1601. Together, they reverted the reformation in the county of Rietberg. That he didn't convert only for political reasons, was made evident when he founded a Franciscan monastery in Rietberg. Being a catholic, John could make his career in the imperial service. He became an officer in the imperial army and later in the Spanish army. John conquered the Prince-Bishopric of Paderborn, which had turned Protestant, committing atrocities against the population in the process.

They are mentioned (although wrongly assigned to the city's cathedral) by late Renaissance art biographer Giorgio Vasari in the first edition of his Lives (1550).

Early life  Born in Buitenzorg (today's Bogor) in 1924, Tan Tjin Hin, adopted the Indonesian family name of Tabalujan soon after Indonesia became independent on 17 August 1945. He was the fourth son of an Indonesian Chinese trader in a small town near Bogor. The family moved to Manado in Sulawesi and prospered until the outbreak of the Pacific War in 1941 which resulted in the complete loss of the family business. Educated at the Anglo-Chinese College on the island of Kulangsu near Xiamen, (Amoy) and at a business college in Jakarta, Carlo Tabalujan at the age of seventeen was stranded entirely alone and without money when the Japanese occupied Java. He survived for three and a half years with the help from schoolmates and some poorly paid work. In 1945, his first real job was with the British Seaforth Highlanders, part of the Allied Forces that landed to take back control of Indonesia from the Japanese. Business In 1945, he began trading on his own by renting a desk in the office of a businessman. From that basic beginning, Carlo Tabalujan built up successful trading and manufacturing businesses.

Augustine is credited with developing the first form of the theodicy now named for him. The Augustinian theodicy, named for the 4th- and 5th-century theologian and philosopher Augustine of Hippo, is a type of Christian theodicy designed in response to the evidential problem of evil. As such, it attempts to explain the probability of an omnipotent (all-powerful) and omnibenevolent (all-good) God amid evidence of evil in the world. A number of variations of this kind of theodicy have been proposed throughout history; their similarities were first described by the 20th-century philosopher John Hick, who classified them as \\"Augustinian\\". They typically assert that God is perfectly (ideally) good, that he created the world out of nothing, and that evil is the result of humanity's original sin. The entry of evil into the world is generally explained as consequence of original sin and its continued presence due to humans' misuse of free will and concupiscence. God's goodness and benevolence, according to the Augustinian theodicy, remain perfect and without responsibility for evil or suffering. Augustine of Hippo was the first to develop the theodicy. He rejected the idea that evil exists in itself, instead regarding it as a corruption of goodness, caused by humanity's abuse of free will. Augustine believed in the existence of a physical Hell as a punishment for sin, but argued that those who choose to accept the salvation of Jesus Christ will go to Heaven. In the 13th century, Thomas Aquinas – influenced by Augustine – proposed a similar theodicy based on the view that God is goodness and that there can be no evil in him. He believed that the existence of goodness allows evil to exist, through the fault of humans. Augustine also influenced John Calvin, who supported Augustine's view that evil is the result of free will and argued that sin corrupts humans, requiring God's grace to give moral guidance. The theodicy was criticised by Augustine's contemporary Fortunatus, a Manichaean who contended that God must still be somehow implicated in evil, and 18th-century theologian Francesco Antonio Zaccaria criticised Augustine's concept of evil for not dealing with individual human suffering. Hick regards evil as necessary for the moral and spiritual development of humans, and process theologians have argued that God is not omnipotent and so cannot be responsible for any evil. The logic of Augustine's approach has been adapted by Alvin Plantinga, among others. Plantinga's adapted Augustinian theodicy, the free will defence – which he proposed in the 1980s – attempts to answer only the logical problem of evil. Such a defence (not a \\"theodicy\\" proper) does not demonstrate the existence of God, or the probable existence of God, but attempts to prove that the existence of God and the presence of evil (or privatio boni) in the world are not logically contradictory. General forms The Augustinian theodicy was first distinguished as a form of theodicy by John Hick in Evil and the God of Love, written in 1966, in which he classified Augustine's theodicy and its subsequent developments as \\"Augustinian\\". Hick distinguished between the Augustinian theodicy, which attempts to clear God of all responsibility for evil, based on human free will, and the Irenaean theodicy, which casts God as responsible for evil but justified because of its benefits for human development.Hall 2003, p. 132 The Augustinian theodicy is a response to the evidential problem of evil,Svendsen & Pierce 2010, pp. 48–49 which raises the concern that if God is omnipotent and omnibenevolent, there should be no evil in the world. Evidence of evil can call into question God's nature or his existence – he is either not omnipotent, not benevolent, or does not exist. Theodicy is an attempt to reconcile the existence and nature of God with evidence of evil in the world by providing valid explanations for its occurrence. The Augustinian theodicy asserts that God created the world ex nihilo (out of nothing), but maintains that God did not create evil and is not responsible for its occurrence.Bennett, Peters, Hewlett & Russell 2008, p. 126 Evil is not attributed existence in its own right, but is described as the privation of good – the corruption of God's good creation.Menn 2002, p. 170 The Augustinian theodicy supports the notion of original sin. All versions of this theodicy accept the theological implications of the Genesis creation narrative, including the belief that God created human beings without sin or suffering. Evil is believed to be a just punishment for the fall of man: when Adam and Eve first disobeyed God and were exiled from the Garden of Eden.Corey 2000, pp. 177–178 The free will of humans is offered by the Augustinian theodicy as the continued reason for moral evil: people commit immoral acts when their will is evil. The evil nature of human will is attributed to original sin; Augustinian theologians argue that the sin of Adam and Eve corrupted the will of human beings,Green 2011, p. 779 maintaining that God is blameless and good, and not himself responsible for evil.Geivett 1995, p. 19 Development =Augustine= Augustine of Hippo (AD 354–430) was a philosopher and theologian born in Roman Africa (present-day Algeria). He followed the Manichaean religion during his early life, but converted to Christianity in 386. His two major works, Confessions and City of God, develop key ideas regarding his response to suffering. In Confessions, Augustine wrote that his previous work was dominated by materialism and that reading Plato's works enabled him to consider the existence of a non-physical substance. This helped him develop a response to the problem of evil from a theological (and non-Manichean) perspective, based on his interpretation of the first few chapters of Genesis and the writings of Paul the Apostle.Korsmeyer 1995, p. 47 In City of God, Augustine developed his theodicy as part of his attempt to trace human history and describe its conclusion. Augustine proposed that evil could not exist within God, nor be created by God, and is instead a by-product of God's creativity.Menn 2002, p. 168 He rejected the notion that evil exists in itself, proposing instead that it is a privation of (or falling away from) good, and a corruption of nature. He wrote that \\"evil has no positive nature; but the loss of good has received the name 'evil.'\\"The City of God, Augustine of Hippo, Book XI, Chapter 9 Both moral and natural evil occurs, Augustine argued, owing to an evil use of free will, which could be traced back to Adam and Eve's original sin.Svendsen & Pierce 2010, p. 49 He believed that this evil will, present in the human soul, was a corruption of the will given to humans by God, making suffering a just punishment for the sin of humans.Menn 2002, p. 174 Because Augustine believed that all of humanity was \\"seminally present in the loins of Adam\\", he argued that all of humanity inherited Adam's sin and his just punishment.Bennett, Peters, Hewlett & Russell 2008, p. 127 However, in spite of his belief that free will can be turned to evil, Augustine maintained that it is vital for humans to have free will, because they could not live well without it. He argued that evil could come from humans because, although humans contained no evil, they were also not perfectly good and hence could be corrupted.Menn 2002, p. 176 Augustine believed that a physical Hell exists, but that physical punishment is secondary to the punishment of being separated from God. He proposed two reasons for this: Firstly, humans have free will, and only those who choose to follow God will be forgiven and able to avoid Hell.Cavadini 1999, p. 422 Secondly, he believed that Adam and Eve's choice to sin affected our free choice, and that humans are left unable to resist sin.Cavadini 1999, p. 423 Augustine proposed that the grace of Jesus Christ freed humans from original sin, but he maintained that humans can only be saved if they choose to receive grace, and that this choice is formed by the character of individual humans. Accepting that even those who will be saved continue to sin, Augustine proposed that those who choose God's grace will still go to Hell for a time to purge them of their sin, before going to Heaven. =Thomas Aquinas= Gentile da Fabriano's portrait of Thomas Aquinas, who developed a theodicy heavily influenced by Augustine Thomas Aquinas, a thirteenth-century scholastic philosopher and theologian heavily influenced by Augustine, proposed a form of the Augustinian theodicy in his Summa Theologica. Aquinas began by attempting to establish the existence of God,Little 2005, p. 44 through his Five Ways, and then attested that God is good and must have a morally sufficient reason for allowing evil to exist.Geivett 1995, p. 18 Aquinas proposed that all goodness in the world must exist perfectly in God, and that, existing perfectly, God must be perfectly good. He concluded that God is goodness, and that there is no evil in God. Aquinas supported Augustine's view that evil is a privation of goodness, maintaining that evil has existence as a privation intrinsically found in good.Geivett 1995, pp. 19–20 The existence of this evil, Aquinas believed, can be completely explained by free will. Faced with the assertion that humans would have been better off without free will, he argued that the possibility of sin is necessary for a perfect world, and so individuals are responsible for their sin. Good is the cause of evil, but only owing to fault on the part of the agent. In his theodicy, to say something is evil is to say that it lacks goodness which means that it could not be part of God's creation, because God's creation lacked nothing. Aquinas noted that, although goodness makes evil possible, it does not necessitate evil. This means that God (who is good) is not cast as the cause of evil, because evil arises out of a defect in an agent, and God is seen to be without defect.Little 2005, pp. 42–43 The philosopher Eleonore Stump, considering Aquinas' commentary on the Book of Job, argues that Aquinas has a positive view of suffering: it is necessary to contrast Earth with heaven and remind humans that they still have the propensity to commit evil. Aquinas believed that evil is acceptable because of the good that comes from it, and that evil can only be justified when it is required in order for good to occur.Howard- Snyder 1996, p. 51 Attempting to relieve God of responsibility for the occurrence of evil, Aquinas insisted that God merely permits evil to happen, rather than willing it.Korsmeyer 1995, p. 45 He recognised the occurrence of what seems to be evil, but did not attribute to it the same level of existence that he attributed to spirituality. Like Augustine, Aquinas asserted that humans bear responsibility for evil owing to their abuse of free will.Wawrykow 2005, p. 53 =John Calvin= John Calvin, a sixteenth-century French theologian and principal figure in the development of Calvinism, was influenced by Augustine's works.Cavadini 1999, pp. 116–118 Unlike Augustine, Calvin was willing to accept that God is responsible for evil and suffering; however, he maintained that God cannot be indicted for it.Case-Winters 1990, p. 70 Calvin continued the Augustinian approach that sin is the result of the fall of man, and argued that the human mind, will, and affections are corrupted by sin. He believed that only the grace of God is sufficient to provide humans with ongoing ethical guidance, arguing that reason is blinded by humans' sinful nature.McKim 2004, p. 93 Calvin proposed that humanity is predestined, divided into the elect and the reprobate: the elect are those who God has chosen to save and are the only ones who will be saved.Steele & Thomas 1963, pp. 15–17 =Peter van Inwagen= The philosopher Peter van Inwagen put forward an original formulation of the Augustinian theodicy in his book The Problem of Evil. Here he suggests that whilst an extended formulation of Augustine's presentation of the free-will theodicy can answer the problems of global human and natural evil, it is incapable of answering what he calls local arguments from evil, which focus upon specific instances of evil that could have been removed from the world for the better without interrupting God's plan- for example, it would surely take away nothing from God's plan for the world to simply remove one woman who has been raped and murdered, as this amount would be too small in comparison to the rest of the world's evils to take away from God's purposes for evil as put forward by Augustine. In response, van Inwagen argues that there is no non-arbitrary amount of evil necessary for God to fulfil his plan, and he does this by employing a formulation of the Sorites paradox. He argues that there is no smallest amount of evil necessary for God's plan to be fulfilled, and thus that God chose an arbitrary amount of evil for this world that would fulfil his purposes, such as showing the world that there are great amounts of evil and that these cannot be prevented. However, van Inwagen notes that even if readers disagree with him and do believe that there is a minimum amount necessary, his response can be easily reformulated to accommodate for them: theists can simply say that God did choose the minimum amount, and thus that there is no gratuitous evil, as every evil has a purpose in God's plan for the world. He notes that this response would be especially open to Molinists- indeed, many Molinists, such as William Lane Craig, have chosen to answer in this way as a result. Criticism John Hick criticised the Augustinian concept of Hell, vividly depicted in this twelfth-century painting by Herrad von Landsberg. =Fortunatus= Augustine's Acts or Disputation Against Fortunatus the Manichaean, which partly touches on the problem of evil, records a public debate between Augustine and the Manichaean teacher Fortunatus. Fortunatus criticised Augustine's theodicy by proposing that if God gave free will to the human soul, then he must be implicated in human sin (a problem that Augustine had himself considered four years earlier, in Free Will). Quoting the New Testament, Fortunatus proposed that evil exists beyond the evil acts people commit, and that people commit such acts because of their own flawed nature.Fredriksen 2010, p. 146 Augustine replied by arguing that the sin of Adam constrained human freedom, in a way similar to the formation of habits.Acts or Disputation Against Fortunatus the Manichaean, Augustine of Hippo, Ch. XXII This was not a teaching on original sin (a view that Augustine was yet to formulate), but on the limitations of human freedom caused by sin.Fredriksen 2010, pp. 146–147 Fortunatus proposed that Augustine was reducing the scope of evil only to what is committed by humans, though Augustine writes that Fortunatus finally conceded the debate when he admitted that he could not defend his views on the origin of evil.Fredriksen 2010, p. 147 =Buddhism= The scholars of religion Paul Ingram and Frederick Streng argued that the teachings of Buddhism challenge Augustine's view of good and evil, proposing a dualism in which good and evil have equal value instead of casting good over evil, as Augustine did. This is similar to the Manichean account of good and evil – that the two are equal and in conflict – though Buddhism teaches that the two will come to a final conclusion and transcend the conflict.Ingram & Streng 1986, p. 148 Ingram and Streng argued that the Augustinian theodicy fails to account for the existence of evil before Adam's sin, which Genesis presents in the form of the serpent's temptation. =Francesco Antonio Zaccaria= The Italian theologian Francesco Antonio Zaccaria criticised Augustine's concept of evil in the eighteenth century. He noted a distinction between using the term evil to imply blame (sin) and to imply lament (suffering) and argued that Augustine posited sin to have occurred before suffering. This was problematic for Zaccaria, who believed that it made Augustine seem offhand and uninterested in human suffering. For Zaccaria, Augustine's perception of evil as a privation did not satisfactorily answer the questions of modern society as to why suffering exists.Zaccaria 2009, p. 104 =John Hick= John Hick criticised the Augustinian theodicy when he developed his own theodicy in 1966. Hick supported the views of the German theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher, which he classified as Irenaean, who argued that the world is perfectly suited for the moral development of humans and that this justifies the existence of evil. He insisted that, while the Augustinian theodicy attempted to justify historical occurrences of evil, the Irenaean theodicy seeks to justify God eternally. Hick saw Augustine's view that a perfect world went wrong as incoherent and contradictory, and argued that, if humans were made perfectly good, then it should have been impossible for them to have made an immoral choice. He questioned the success of the theodicy with the charge that it does not remove the blame for evil from God: Augustine presented a theology of predestination; Hick argued that, if God knew the choices that his creation would make, he must be responsible for them.Cheetham 2003, pp. 40–42 Hick's theodicy rejected the idea of the inheritance of sinfulness, and he believed that an eternal hell would render \\"a Christian theodicy impossible\\".Hick 2010, p. 237 The Irenaean theodicy does not, as the Augustinian theodicy does, attempt to protect God from being responsible for evil; rather, it argues that God is responsible but justified for it because of the benefits it has for human development. Both theodicies stress the perfection of God's creation, but differ in why the world is seen as perfect. Augustine also believed, as Hick did, that bringing good out of evil is preferable to the evil not occurring in the first place.Barber & Neville 2005, p. 141 =Process theology= In God, Power and Evil: A Process Theodicy, published in 1976, David Ray Griffin criticised Augustine's reliance on free will and argued that it is incompatible with divine omniscience and omnipotence. Griffin argued in later works that humans cannot have free will if God is omniscient. He contended that, if God is truly omniscient, then he will know infallibly what people will do, meaning that they cannot be free. Griffin argued that the human will could not oppose God's will, if God is omnipotent. He proposed that original sin as Augustine conceived it must itself be caused by God, rendering any punishment he wills unjust.Griffin 1976, pp. 60–66 Process theology argues that God is not omnipotent: rather than coercion, he has the power of divine persuasion, but he cannot force his will. Griffin, a prominent process theologian, argues that God feels the pain of the world (both physically and emotionally) and does everything within his power to achieve good, but he can neither force beings to be good nor prevent evil because he does not play a coercive role in the world.Melse 1993, pp. 13–24 Process theology teaches that, rather than creating the world ex nihilo (as Augustine proposed), God created it out of a pre-existent chaos.Cobb & Griffin 1976, p. 65 =Alvin Plantinga= Alvin Plantinga, who presented a version of the free will defence as an alternative response to the problem of evil In the 1970s, Alvin Plantinga presented a version of the free will defence which, he argued, demonstrated that the existence of an omnipotent benevolent God and of evil are not inconsistent. He believed that, unless it could be shown that the two are not inconsistent, they would be necessarily contradictory.Plantinga & Sennett 1998, pp. 22–23 To do this, Plantinga believed that a \\"possible state of affairs\\" must be proposed which, if actual, would make God's existence and the existence of evil consistent.Plantinga & Sennett 1998, p. 23 He argued that a third proposition – that evil is the result of the actions of free, rational, fallible human beings – allows the existence of God and evil to be consistent.McGrath 1995, p. 193 Plantinga supported this argument by claiming that there are some things that an omnipotent God could not do, yet remain omnipotent – for example, if an omnipotent God has necessary existence, he could not create a world in which he does not exist. For this reason, Plantinga argued that an omnipotent God could not create any universe that he chooses, as Leibniz had proposed. He suggested that, even in a world where humans have free will, their actions may be so predictable that God could not create a world where they would do something unpredictable. Finally, he argued that if every moral agent freely makes at least one bad moral decision in any possible universe, God cannot create a universe where there is human freedom and no evil. Plantinga maintained that the existence of an omnipotent, benevolent God and the existence of evil are not inconsistent.Duncan 2007, pp. 105–106 Plantinga's version of the defence embraces Augustine's view of free will, but not his natural theology.Geivett 1995, p. 59 Rather than attempt to show the existence of God as likely in the face of evil, as a theodicy does, Plantinga's free will defence attempts to show that belief in God is still logically possible, despite the existence of evil.Geivett 1995, pp. 60–61 The theologian Alister McGrath has noted that, because Plantinga only argued that the coexistence of God and evil are logically possible, he did not present a theodicy, but a defence. Plantinga did not attempt to demonstrate that his proposition is true or plausible, just that it is logically possible. =Compatibility with evolution= John Hick criticised Augustine's theory for being implausible in light of scientific insights on evolution, as it would make Augustine's idea of a fall from perfection inaccurate;Davis 2001, p. 54 this is reiterated by Nancey Murphy and George F. R. Ellis, who also contend that Augustine's idea of transmitting original sin from Adam to the rest of humanity requires biological explanation.Ellis & Murphy 1996, p. 244 The comparative religionist Arvind Sharma has argued that natural evil cannot be the result of moral evil in the way Augustine suggested: scientific consensus is that natural disasters and disease existed before humans and hence cannot be the result of human sin.Sharma 2006, pp. 85–86 The twentieth-century philosopher Reinhold Niebuhr attempted to reinterpret the Augustinian theodicy in the light of evolutionary science by presenting its underlying argument without mythology. Niebuhr proposed that Augustine rejected the Manichean view that grants evil ontological existence and ties humans' sin to their created state. Augustine's argument continued, according to Niebuhr, by proposing that humans have a tendency to sin because of a biologically inherited nature and rejected the Pelagian view that human will could overcome sin on its own.Bennett, Peters, Hewlett & Russell 2008, p. 128 Niebuhr believed Augustine's argument placed sin in the human will, which was corrupted by Adam's original sin. He argued that the logic behind Augustine's theodicy described sin as inevitable but unnecessary, which he believed captured the argument without relying on a literal interpretation of the fall, thus avoiding critique from scientific positions.Bennett, Peters, Hewlett & Russell 2008, p. 129 See also * Theodicy and the Bible Notes References =Footnotes= =Bibliography=           Category:Philosophy of religion Category:Problem of evil Category:Theodicy Category:Augustine of Hippo Category:Augustine studies ","title":"Augustinian theodicy"},{"id":"33008786","text":"Sir Thomas St George (1615 – 6 March 1703) was an English officer of arms who rose to the rank of Garter Principal King of Arms (1686–1703).  Life  He was the eldest child of the herald Sir Henry St George and his wife, Mary Dayrell, daughter of Sir Thomas Dayrell. He lived at Woodford in Essex.D. Lysons, The Environs of London, vol. 4 (1796), 273-87 Around 1646 he married Clara Pymlowe (d. 1691), whose father, John Pymlowe, was a Northamptonshire rector. They had six children, including Thomas junior, who was Vicar of Bexley, and Eleanor, who married the eminent Irish judge Thomas Coote. At the Restoration he was appointed Somerset Herald. As deputy to Sir Edward Walker he went on a mission to Dresden and invested John George II, Elector of Saxony on 13 April 1669 with the Order of the Garter. He was knighted in 1669 and appointed Norroy King of Arms in 1680, in succession to his younger brother Henry. The seniority was reversed when in 1686, he was appointed Garter on the death of William Dugdale. In 1690 he appointed a deputy to deliver the Garter to a Continental recipient, but the following year he undertook the task himself as William III was to attend the ceremony. In 1693, Gregory King acted as his deputy to deliver the Garter to the Elector of Saxony. On his return to London in May 1693 he was knighted.Ashmole, Elias (1672): The Institution, Laws and Ceremonies of the Most Noble Order of the Garter. London: J. Macock, p. 426 Following his first wife's death, he married Anne (d. 1721), daughter of Sir John Lawson and widow of William Attwood in 1692. Their only daughter Isabella died in infancy. In 1693 he and his brother Sir Henry were appointed commissioners for the rebuilding of St Paul's Cathedral after the Great Fire of London. He died at the College of Arms on 6 March 1703 and was buried at Woodford. His manuscripts were purchased by Peter Le Neve, Norroy King of Arms. According to Noble, ‘he died more esteemed as a good, and more respected as an elegant man, than praised for his knowledge’.M. Noble, The History of the College of Arms (1804), 331-3 His estates passed to his granddaughter Eleanor, who was the only child of his son Thomas and his wife Damaris Renter. She married Thomas Dare of Taunton.

The blast killed 15 people and injured 79. Background Previously, a low-intensity blast also occurred at the High Court outside Gate No. 7 on 25 May with no reported casualties. The attack took place while Indian Prime Minister M.Singh was on a historic two- day official state visit to Bangladesh, to discuss Bangladesh–India relations. The attack also happened less than two months after bombings in Mumbai on 13 July which killed 26 people. Attack The blast took place at 10:14 IST on 7 September 2011. Explosives were placed in a briefcase at the high court reception where hundreds of people throng every day to attend court cases, home secretary R.K. Singh said to reporters. According to the special secretary in the Home Ministry, two kilos of explosives were used, with ammonium nitrate and PETN to cause considerable damage even though used in a small amount. Responsibility According to reports immediately following the blasts, responsibility for the bombings was claimed by the Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami (HuJI) group. In an email attributed to HuJI, the group is alleged to have demanded that Mohammed Afzal Guru, convicted for the 2001 Indian Parliament attack, should not be hanged as ordered by the Supreme Court. However, Afzal Guru strongly denied any such link to the attack, and said that his name was being \\"unnecessarily\\" dragged into the \\"cowardly act\\" which \\"must be condemned by all\\". A day after this email, another email was sent by the Indian Mujahideen to television media, allegedly claiming that the attack was carried out by IM and not HuJI and also threatened it would carry out more attacks on shopping complexes on the coming Tuesday. On 10 September, the Indian Union Home Secretary stated that it was not necessary that the emails claiming responsibility for the Delhi High Court blast were sent by the actual perpetrators and added that it could have been other people who, when they heard about the blast, sent the emails.  Investigations  A sketch of two suspected persons was released by the Delhi Police Department on the day of the bombing. According to police sources, the sketches were based on the description given by an eyewitness. The sketch showed one person in his 50s, and another in his mid-20s. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) took over the investigations, and set up a 20-member team to examine the email. The Central Forensic Science Laboratory is examining the composition of the explosives and it is expected to release the results in the next few days, on which NIA will act accordingly. The email sent by HuJI with the email address harkatuljihadi2011@gmail.com was traced to have been sent from a cyber cafe named Global Internet Cafe located at Malik Market in Kishtwar, Jammu and Kashmir. The NIA team in Jammu and Kashmir detained three suspects including the cyber cafe owner and his brother for questioning. However, the Director- General of the NIA, said that it was too premature to comment on the HuJI mail but (they) were looking at it seriously because HuJI was a very prominent group which considered India its primary target. A NIA team arrested a man from Patna due to his alleged involvement in misusing a stolen ATM card and was cross-examined by the NIA team. Another email sent in the name of Indian Mujahideen was traced to a Monu Ojha, a 22-year-old school dropout in Ahmedabad, who confessed to deliberately creating a hoax email. A separate investigation was set up by the Delhi Police Department after the Intelligence Bureau said that only one input was received, which specifically cited Muslim extremists who are supporters of the Khalistan movement and may conduct illegal activities in the city. On 7 October, the National Investigation Agency arrested a medical student from Kishtwar, Jammu and Kashmir named Wasim Akram Malik, who they claimed was a key conspirator of the blast. Kashmiri Wasim Akram Malik, a student of Unani medicine in Bangladesh, was arrested from the Indo-Bangladesh border, on basis of leads derived from other detained suspects. The NIA team had zoomed in on Kishtwar after receiving emails from a cyber cafe in the area. The NIA claimed that the arrested have strong links to the terrorist group Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami. Public Relation Officer (PRO) Defence, Col R K Palta claimed killing of two terrorists on 6 August 2012 in the Trothil forest area of the Kishtwar district. These have been identified as Amir Ali and Mohmmad Shafi alias Sakib. Deputy Inspector General (DIG), Kishtwar-Doda-Ramban range claimed that Amir Ali is the prime accused in the Delhi High Court blast.  Court trial  In March 2012, the NIA filed a charge sheet against six accused, including a minor. The accused named in the charge sheet are: Wasim Akram Malik, Malik's brother Junaid Akram Malik, Amir Abbas Dev, Shakir Hussain Seikh alias Chota Hafiz and Amir Kamal. Out of them, Amir Dev turned approver and was granted pardon by court. Junaid, Shakir, Amir are still absconding. On 4 September 2012, a special NIA court in New Delhi found sufficient prima facie evidence against Malik under Indian Penal Code provisions dealing with criminal conspiracy, murder and attempt to murder and various terror charges. However, the court dropped the charges dealing with waging war against the nation and conspiracy and collecting arms to wage a war against the nation. The court fixed 1 October for framing of charges.  Reactions  = Domestic = President Pratibha Patil condemned the blast and condoled the loss of lives in the incident. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, while on a two-day stay in Dhaka, remarked: \\"I just heard the sad news from Delhi about the bomb blast. I am told that 10 people have been killed. This is cowardly act of terrorist nature. We will deal with it. We will never succumb to the pressure of terrorism.\\" Indian Home Minister P. Chidambaram said the blast was likely a job of local militants and remarked that \\"India was concerned about how to prevent the radicalisation of its youth.\\" Indian Muslim religious leaders termed the blast as an act against humanity and suspected that it could be a deep conspiracy to destabilize the secular system of India. They appealed to the members of Muslim community to oppose such acts with loud voice and extend all possible support to the government in tackling the crisis. As attack coincided with Manmohan Singh's visit to Bangladesh, and also because of the 13 July 2011 Mumbai bombings coincided with meetings between the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan, some analysts suggested the attack was an attempt to divert attention from the agreements reached between Bangladesh and India. = International = * - Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon strongly condemned the terror attack in Delhi. * - Prime Minister Julia Gillard said that: \\"The government and people of Australia unreservedly condemn the bombing.

History It is thought that the church originated no later than the 9th century, and possibly as early as the 7th century, although there is no mention of the church in the Domesday Book. By 1199 the advowson of the church was owned by West Dereham Abbey. The whole church was completely rebuilt in the 15th century. It was restored in 1879–81 by the Lancaster architects Paley and Austin. Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed in millstone grit, with roofs of lead, slate, and stone slate. Its plan consists of a four bay nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles, both with side chapels, a south porch, a north hearse house, a two-bay chancel, and a west tower. The tower is in two stages, with diagonal buttresses. Towards the top of the southeast tower are the carved coat of arms of Fountains Abbey. There are more coats of arms on the southwest buttress. The tower contains a three- light west window, a trefoil-headed niche on the south side, clock faces on the east and west sides, and three-light bell openings on each side. At the summit of the tower is an embattled parapet. The porch contains two consecration crosses. Along the side of the south aisle, and in its west wall, are three-light windows. The south chapel is known as the Lady Chapel. This has a doorway on the west side and a three-light window on the east side. The north aisle contains two-light windows at the west end and along the sides, a blocked entrance and a hearse house. The north chapel is dedicated to Saint John the Baptist. It has a three-light east window. The windows on the south of the clerestory have three-light windows, and the windows on the north side have two-lights. The parapet of both clerestories is embattled. In the east wall of the chancel is a five-light window. =Interior= Inside the church three of the piers of the arcades contain trefoil-headed niches. In the north aisle are some box pews dating from the 17th and early 18th centuries. The baptistry contains a font dating from the 11th century. This is decorated with zigzag moulding, and is set on a 19th-century base. In the south aisle are two piscinae. The single-manual organ built at an uncertain date by Isaac Abbott of Leeds was removed in 1980. There is a ring of eight bells. The oldest of these were cast in 1602 and 1617 by William Oldfield of York, one was cast in 1785 by Robert Dalton, and fourth was by John Warner & Sons and is dated 1897.

A 69-year-old Jewish American man in a wheelchair, Leon Klinghoffer, was murdered by the hijackers and thrown overboard. The hijacking sparked the \\"Sigonella Crisis\\". Background Several events before the October 7, 1985, hijacking provide a context for what took place. =Palestine Liberation Organization= Since being driven out of Jordan in 1970 and Southern Lebanon and Beirut, by Israel in 1978 and 1982, respectively, Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) guerrillas had dispersed (under international guarantees of safety) to Tunisia, Yemen, Southern Yemen, Algeria, Jordan, Syria, Iraq and the Sudan. (The presence of PLO strongholds in some of these countries would play a part in where the hijackers of Achille Lauro felt they could find safe haven.) While in Lebanon PLO chairman Yasser Arafat had run into problems with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad who in 1983 sought to wrest effective control of the group from him by backing a mutiny within the PLO. Arafat was backed by the Soviet Union and was helped to escape Lebanon by the Syrian President's brother Rifaat Assad and his \\"Red Knights\\" of Alawite notables near the Lebanese border with Syria. When the attempt to wrest control failed, the Syrian military backed the mutineers in an attack on Arafat loyalists within Tripoli, Lebanon. Arafat moved his loyalists and the PLO headquarters from Tripoli to Tunisia. (The hostility between Al-Assad and Arafat explains some of the Syrian reaction to the hijackers of the Achille Lauro.) Throughout the 1980s, the Palestine Liberation Front (PLF) and other members of PLO launched attacks on both civilian and military targets in the north of Israel, across the Lebanese border. One such attack by the PLO's Force 17 on September 25, 1985, on an Israeli yacht in Larnaca, Cyprus, where three Israelis were killed, triggered the Israeli Air Force to bomb the PLO headquarters in Tunis in (Operation Wooden Leg) on October 1, 1985. The headquarters was completely destroyed in this attack, and 60 PLO members were killed. Speculation arose that the hijacking of Achille Lauro was an act of retaliation for the Israeli bombing of the PLO headquarters in Tunis. This was disputed by Abbas' widow Reem al-Nimer in 2013. According to al-Nimer, the hijacking had been planned 11 months in advance, and the hijackers had already been on two 'dummy' training runs on Achille Lauro. The plan was to open fire on Israeli soldiers when the ship reached Ashdod – a suicide mission. =Palestine Liberation Front= The hijacking of the Achille Lauro was planned and executed by one of the three factions of the Palestine Liberation Front (PLF). The PLF as a whole was one of the eight constituent groups that had originally formed the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) which was under the chairmanship of Yasser Arafat. The first faction of the PLF was headed by Taalat Yacoub, a Palestinian who opposed Arafat and was supported by Syria. (Yacoub would immediately denounce the hijacking.) The second PLF faction was headed by Abd al-Fatah Ghanim, who also opposed Arafat. The last faction was headed by Abbas, who was loyal to Arafat and sat on the PLO Executive Committee. His faction of the PLF had already carried out a series of armed raids in Israel and the West Bank since the late 1970s. The hijackers of the Achille Lauro in their demands to be met before they freed their hostages specified only one by name; Samir Kuntar. The Lebanese Kuntar was a friend of Abu Abbas, the mastermind behind the hijacking. Kuntar and an accomplice had been jailed by Israel five years before for attempting on April 22, 1979, to kidnap a Jewish family in Nahariya, Northern Israel, close to the Lebanese border. The botched kidnapping (which had been planned by Abbas and Kuntar) had resulted in the death of Israeli policeman Eliyahu Shahar, 31-year-old father Danny Kaiser, and his two daughters, four-year-old Einat and two year-old Yael, leaving only wife and mother Smadar Haran Kaiser alive. Prelude to the hijacking Events on the Achille Lauro cruise in the days before the hijacking inform the conditions during it. =Itinerary & embarkation= The Achille Lauro embarked from Genoa, Italy, on Thursday, October 3, 1985, with an itinerary for an eleven-day cruise with ports of call in Naples and Syracuse in Italy; Alexandria and Port Said in Egypt; Ashdod in Israel; Limassol in Cyprus; Rhodes and Piraeus in Greece; and returning to Italy for a stop at Capri before finishing back in Genoa. The fares for a double-berthed cabin were between $955 and $1,550. The ship had become the property of the Italian government when its previous owner, Costa Lines, went bankrupt. The vessel was seized by the company's creditors, who in 1983 sold it to the state, who in turn leased it to Chandris cruise line under an agreement that would last until 1987. The ship set out with 748 passengers. Among them was a group of close friends from New York and New Jersey who forewent their usual Jersey shore vacation in favor of a cruise. The trip celebrated the 58th birthday of Marilyn Klinghoffer, a personnel manager at a small publishing firm, who had fought colon cancer into remission, as well as her 36th wedding anniversary with Leon, who owned and operated a small appliance manufacturing firm. The pair had two adult daughters, 34-year-old Lisa, who was married, and 28-year-old Ilsa, who was engaged. Paralyzed on his right side as a result of two strokes, Leon could occasionally walk with a cane but usually relied on a wheelchair. In fact, the group had specifically chosen the Achille Lauro over other ships due to its wheelchair accessibility. Travelling with the Klinghoffers were their friends Frank and Mildred Hodes, Neil and June Kantor, Seymour and Viola Meskin, Sylvia Sherman, and Charlotte Spiegel. Because ship hijackings were relatively rare at the time, the cruise line's security amounted to checking passports at Genoa. Standard procedure at the time did not include checking luggage. The New York Times reported at the time that the ship had security personnel, but it could not determine if they were armed. This lax security is particularly notable in a year that had already seen a spate of terrorist incidents within Europe and the Middle East, including the hijacking of TWA Flight 847, in which a hostage was slain. The TWA incident had even impacted the Mediterranean cruise business: Greece's Epirotiki Line took three of its ships – Jupiter, Jason, and Neptune – out of service when terrorism fears led to decreased travel demand overall in the region. =Early events= On Friday, October 4, Achille Lauro called in Naples, then sailed through the Straits of Messina; the Mediterranean was calm and the fall day was warm. Cruise manager Max Fico would later recall that he noticed that several young men were acting suspicious, in that they kept to themselves, refusing any of the congenial friendliness common to the other cruise guests. They claimed to be Argentinean when other guests tried to engage them in English, but did not understand fluent Spanish when it was spoken to them. They had passports from Portugal, Norway, and Argentina; later, it was theorized that they were trying to maintain a cover story. On Sunday, October 6, the Klinghoffers and friends celebrated Marilyn's fifty- eighth birthday. On October 7, at Alexandria, Egypt, 651 of the passengers from the Achille Lauro left for a bus tour of the pyramids. They were to rendezvous with the ship fourteen hours later at Port Said, at the mouth of the Suez Canal, 150 miles to the east. Passengers who stayed aboard the Achille Lauro, such as Rene Sprecher, would later report watching a camera crew record what appeared to be people running on and off the ship firing guns with blanks. At the end of this, a car arrived, and a man took two wrapped packages from it, carrying them aboard ship. It was later theorized that this was how weapons were brought aboard. Hijacking The taking of the Achille Lauro was triggered by a surprise discovery and quickly turned violent. =Seizure of the ship= On Monday, October 7, 1985, four PLF militants hijacked Achille Lauro off Egypt. The hijackers had been surprised by a crew member and acted prematurely. The Palestinians had hidden their weapons in the gas tank of a car parked in Italy in preparation for boarding the ship. Their smuggled weapons, still with gasoline residue on them, gave off a smell that the crew had noticed but had not acted on. A cabin steward, with the hijackers' stateroom in his responsibilities, surprised the four Palestinians (as they were trying to use a hairdryer to clean the residue off their weapons) by entering their unlocked room in order to deliver complimentary fruit. The hijackers' original plan to launch an attack on Ashdod, Israel, was put aside as the terrorists panicked and moved to hijack the ship instead. The four terrorists stormed into the ship's dining room. They fired their automatic weapons over the heads of the eating passengers. Screams from the passengers meshed with the shouting of the gunmen and with the sound of falling glass shards and splinters. Viola Meskin tried to run to a door but was intercepted by a terrorist with a gun who turned her back. Austrian passenger Anna Hoeranter ran to an exit but was pushed down an adjacent flight of stairs by one of the terrorists. Other passengers ran in a panic from the dining room into the kitchen and were chased by one of the terrorists. Inside the kitchen, the pursuing terrorist beat two of the kitchen staff to the floor. The ship's executive officer notified Captain Gerardo de Rosa that there were armed men on board, shooting at passengers. Captain De Rosa descended quickly through several decks, moving towards the ship's stern. An agitated voice came over the ship's loudspeakers requesting that he come immediately to the bridge. Arriving there, De Rosa was faced with machine guns. The terrorists fired some shots into the deck and then shouted in Arabic. They demanded he sail the ship 300 miles to the northeast, to the Syrian port of Tartus. Due to most of the passengers having disembarked at Cairo to tour the pyramids, only 97 remained on board and became hostages. The hijackers rounded up the rest of the passengers aboard and herded them into the dining room. They missed Hoeranter, who, after having been pushed down the stairs by a terrorist, had entered the first open cabin she found and had hidden in the bathroom. She would remain there until found by the cleaning staff four days later (after the hijackers had left). She survived on two apples she had found and rationed. The terrorists ordered Captain De Rosa to instruct the 450 crew members to continue with their normal duties but to stay clear of the hostages. They claimed to have a total of 20 hijackers on board. Only later would De Rosa and his officers discover that there were only four hijackers. Within the dining room, the terrorists put on displays of power to intimidate the hostages, menacing them with their machine guns, and pulling the pins from their grenades but keeping the safety levers depressed. They had two of the women hostages hold the live grenades, causing the worry that if they fell asleep, the safety levers would detach, causing an explosion. The hijackers veered erratically from politeness to barbarity – one moment one would wash a cup for a hostage to use, the next a hijacker would ram a gun stock into Mrs. Klinghoffer to force her from the floor, then a hijacker would escort a captive to her cabin to change out of a wet swimsuit. The hijackers also tried to engage in some political persuasion, telling the hostages \\"Reagan no good, Arafat good.\\" Before the hijackers enforced radio silence, the crew of the Achille Lauro managed to send out an S.O.S. that was picked up by a monitoring facility in Sweden. This alerted the international community that Palestinians had seized an Italian ship. As night approached, the hijackers took all the hostages up several decks to the Arazzi Lounge on the Promenade deck and gave them blankets to spend the night. While they ordered the ship's kitchen to send food up for the hostages, they placed containers they claimed were filled with gasoline around the room (apparently as a bluff to ward off the ship's crew). Despite fears of grenades and gasoline, the passengers attempted to sleep on the floor while the ship steamed towards Syria. The tourists who had visited the pyramids reached Port Said by 10:30 but found no ship. At first, they were told that traffic in the canal had delayed the ship, but at 1:30 a.m. were given the truth. Passengers began to worry. =Government reactions= Upon learning of the hijacking and that there were Americans on board, members of the Reagan administration in Washington, D.C., in a time zone seven hours behind Egypt's, moved to take decisive action. The Terrorist Incident Working Group (which included National Security Council staff member Marine Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North) met in accord with predetermined counter-terrorist procedures. They recommended that a State Department Emergency Support Team be sent to Rome to assist the embassy there as the vessel was Italian. The Group also recommended that the Pentagon dispatch a team of special operations forces to Europe in case the ship needed to be seized to rescue the hostages. These recommendations were approved by the Operational Sub-Group chaired by John Poindexter and orders were sent to the State and Defense Departments. U.S. Army Major General Carl Stiner put two platoons, drawn from the Navy's counter-terrorism unit, SEAL Team Six, Army commandos from Delta Force and Air Force Combat Controllers from BRAND X en route to Europe to be operating with NATO ally permission from a British base at Akrotiri, Cyprus. The U.S. State Department asked countries along the Mediterranean to deny Achille Lauro access to their ports in order to keep it in International Waters. They also sought to keep the press away from the ship to prevent giving the terrorists a worldwide stage. The Italian Government took a mixed approach. Defense Minister Giovanni Spadolini had the military send 60 paratroopers, four helicopters, and experts on the ship's layout to the British base at Akrotiri. Prime Minister Bettino Craxi looked for a diplomatic solution beginning a near-continuous dialogue with every country involved, including the nations with citizens aboard, and the Arab states of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and Tunisia. Italy had called on the PLO to publicly declare whether they had any involvement. In response Yasser Arafat denounced the hijacking and offered to assist in negotiating for a peaceful conclusion to the incident. Arafat sent two men to Egypt to join a joint negotiating team alongside Italians and Egyptians – one of his advisors and PLO executive committee member Hani al-Hassan and Abu Abbas. At Port Said, Egypt, these two joined the PLO representative from Cairo – Zohdi al-Qoudra. (It is unknown if Arafat was ignorant of Abbas involvement or if he was sent to ensure the incident would end quickly.) =Demands= On the morning of Tuesday, October 8, the hijackers began to separate the hostages. They were looking for Jews and Americans, asking for the hostages to identify themselves but meeting refusal. They collected the passports of the passengers and pulled aside 12 Americans and six female British dancers who had been hired as entertainers (originally set to perform in the very lounge they were being held hostage in). Looking at the passports of an elderly couple, the hijackers asked if they were Jewish. Upon hearing that they were, one of the terrorists knocked the man to the floor and repeatedly hit him with the butt of his gun. The terrorists ordered the 20 separated passengers up the stairs but Leon Klinghoffer's wheelchair could not make the climb and his wife Marilyn refused to abandon him. She was ordered by the terrorists to leave him, when she protested they put a machine gun to her head and ordered her up the stairs. Fellow passenger Anna Scheider offered to take Mr. Klinghoffer but was refused, with one of the hijackers saying \\"You go! We will take care of him.\\" On Lido Deck, below the bridge and above the lounge the other hostages were being held on, the separated hostages were forced to lie on the deck. Containers said to contain fuel were placed around them with threats from the terrorists that they would shoot the cans if provoked. One of the terrorists told hostage Evelyn Weltman that if commandos tried a rescue all the hostages would be executed. At this point it became clear to the hostages and Captain De Rosa that one of the four hijackers was their leader – twenty-three year- old Youssef Majed Molqi (recruited by Abbas from a crowded Palestinian refugee camp in Jordan). The Achille Lauro arrived off Tartus at 11:00 a.m. and Molqi broke radio silence. He asked Syrian authorities to allow him to dock the ship at Tartus and demanded that they send someone from the International Red Cross to the ship, along with British and American representatives. He stated that he was with the PLF and demanded that the Israeli Government be contacted and given the demand that 50 Palestinians held in its jails be freed, including specifically Samir Kuntar. If the prisoners were not released, Molqi said they would begin killing hostages, \\"We will start executing at 3:00 p.m. sharp.\\" Syria, having consulted with the U.S. and Italian governments, did not respond to any of the demands. =Murder of Leon Klinghoffer= As 3:00 p.m. neared, the terrorists began to decide whom to kill by shuffling the U.S., British, and Austrian hostages' passports. They selected Leon Klinghoffer to be killed first, to be followed by Mildred Hodes. Several reasons have been put forward that may have contributed to why Klinghoffer was chosen. Earlier in the hijacking, he had refused to be silent when gunmen took his watch and cigarettes, becoming brusque and complaining in his slurred speech, which antagonized some of the hijackers, though one of them gave Klinghoffer his possessions back. Additionally Klinghoffer was Jewish and American, and his wheelchair made him both hard to move around the ship and meant his extended absence from the main group was less likely to trigger a chain reaction of resistance among the surviving hostages. Molqi later gave a statement on why he was chosen: \\"I and Bassm [al-Ashker] agreed that the first hostage to be killed had to be an American. I chose Klinghoffer, an invalid, so that they would know that we had no pity for anyone, just as the Americans, arming Israel, do not take into consideration that Israel kills women and children of our people.\\" Molqi ordered Manuel De Souza, a Portuguese waiter, to accompany him and push Klinghoffer outside onto the open deck. Klinghoffer was taken back along the entire deck of the ship to the stern. Molqi ordered De Souza to return into the ship. The other terrorists moved the rest of the hostages back down into the lounge. Marilyn Klinghoffer noticed that Leon was not there and began to weep. A hijacker told her that he had been moved to the ship's infirmary due to illness. Molqi shot Leon Klinghoffer once in the head and again in the chest. He died instantly, toppling onto his face. Molqi then went in and ordered De Souza to throw the body over the side of the ship. When De Souza was unable to do the task alone, Molqi found Italian hairdresser Ferruccio Alberti and forced the two of them at gunpoint to throw the body and then the wheelchair into the sea. Several of the hostages heard the shots and splashes, including Marilyn Klinghoffer. She pleaded with the hijackers to let her see her husband in the infirmary, but they refused. She feared the worst but remained hopeful. Molqi, with blood splattered clothing, returned to the other terrorists and told them \\"I have killed the American.\\" He and Bassam al- Ashker then went to the bridge. Handing Klinghoffer's passport to Captain De Rosa, he raised a finger and said \\"boom, boom.\\" He then handed Mrs. Hodes' passport to him and said \\"This will be the second one.\\" At that point, De Rosa told them they could kill him instead of the passengers. Molqi ordered De Rosa to tell the Syrians that a passenger had been killed and that they were prepared to kill another. The Syrians responded by telling Molqi to \\"go back where you came from.\\" Finding no help in Syria, Molqi ordered De Rosa to sail for Libya. Negotiations In an effort to resolve the situation, communications with the hijackers and discussions about their fate took place. =Abbas' interaction= Before Achille Lauro could head towards Libya, Abbas, unable to contact the ship using Egyptian Naval communications, called into Cyprus' Arabic language station Radio Monte Carlo. He, using the name \\"Abu Khaled\\", asked the station to broadcast a message to the vessel, instructing the hijackers to return immediately to Port Said and treat the passengers \\"kindly.\\" Molqi on the bridge with Captain De Rosa was listening to the station and became overjoyed ordering the captain to set course for Port Said at 7:20 p.m., Tuesday, October 8. Following the instructions of Abbas, the Achille Lauro headed back towards Port Said, where it had previously made a tourist stop. Abbas, still using the name \\"Abu Khaled,\\" was later able to contact the ship by naval radio from Port Said. Abbas told Majed to treat the passengers well and to apologize to them, the crew, and the captain. He told Majed to tell them that their objective was not to take control of the ship and that their friendship with Italy was \\"so important that it is unthinkable that any action would be taken against our European friends.\\" Abbas then spoke to Captain De Rosa; he apologized to him, saying, \\"We are truly sorry, because we didn't intend to hijack you, but our situation was such that we had to assume control for several hours.\\" De Rosa replied \\"I am familiar with your situation and I understand it well. We understand the Palestinians, we understand the Palestinian aspirations, and for that reason we are all with you.\\" The radio contact allowed the International community to pinpoint the location of the vessel. The Israelis were able to provide information about Abba's radio discussions with the ship to the Reagan administration and notified them that it was Abbas' faction behind the hijacking. Fearing that the terrorists threat to kill passengers had been followed through, and not wanting a repeat of the TWA Flight 847 terrorist incident where the administration looked impotent to act, the American special forces staged in Cyprus were ordered to make preparations to storm the vessel. =Government discussions= That afternoon, Maxwell M. Rabb, U.S. ambassador to Italy, advised Prime Minister Craxi of the U.S. intention to mount a military assault on the vessel, after Italy had already weighed taking the same action. Craxi protested, saying the ship was Italian, and therefore only Italy should act and that there was no confirmation of any killings. He maintained that negotiations for the release of the ship seemed possible. He relayed that in response to his inquires the Egyptians had told him that no one had been killed. The Egyptian Government began to conduct negotiations through the medium of PLO representative Muhammed \\"Abu\\" Abbas. By Tuesday evening, the PLO began seeking to have the hijackers turned over to them should they surrender. Arafat had Abbas communicate to Italian Prime Minister Craxi that the hijackers promised to release unharmed all the passengers and to drop demands for the release of prisoners. Arafat, through Abbas, also got Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to pledge to turn over the hijackers to the PLO in Tunis for prosecution. The PLF issued a statement from Nicosia, Cyprus, apologizing to the passengers for the hijacking, \\"The aim of the operation was not to hijack the ship or its passengers, or any civilian of any nationality. The operation was likewise not aimed against states that are friendly to our people and their cause. ... [The mission was to] travel on an ordinary sea journey to Ashdod harbor in occupied Palestine, from where our comrades were to proceed to a specified Israeli military target, as a reply to the war of extermination and terrorism against them and to avenge the martyrs of the Israeli raid on Tunis. Our comrades were compelled to take control of the ship before reaching the specified target. We wish to mention that the course toward Arab ports was the result of the situation and the confusion into which the squad fell.\\" At 7:30 a.m. Wednesday, October 9, the Achille Lauro anchored off Port Said. While the hostages remained in the lounge, a small boat approached the ship. Molqi descended to speak with the new arrivals which included Abu Abbas and Hani al-Hassan. Speaking with the support of both the Egyptian and Italian officials, Abbas and Hassan began talking to the hijackers – giving the appearance of real negotiations. The PLO hailed the incident as successful negotiations and took credit for it. Hassan notified Arafat of the talk and Arafat called Italian Prime Minister Craxi midday Wednesday. Arafat told him that the hijackers would release the captives if two demands were met, that the ambassadors from U.S., Italy, West Germany, and Great Britain visit the ship, then the hijackers be given safe passage off the ship. Italian ambassador Giovanni Migliuolo asked the other ambassadors to accompany him on a helicopter flight to Port Said in order to speak to the hijackers. U.S. ambassador to Egypt Nicholas A. Veliotes refused, saying it would give the hijackers the media platform they wanted and that more importantly the U.S. policy was not to negotiate with terrorists. While the diplomats were reviewing their options the Egyptian foreign minister Abdel Meguid telephoned and asked them to report to his office. There he proposed a new offer – the hostages would be released if the four governments promised not to pursue the hijackers. The ambassadors told him that they could not commit to that without consulting with their governments. Meguid loaned each an office and telephone. He demanded an answer in twenty minutes, the ambassadors ignored his deadline and began discussing the matter with their governments. The American and British ambassadors informed Meguid that their governments refused, repeating their policies of not negotiating with terrorists. By Wednesday morning, the Reagan administration had implemented a plan for the Achille Lauro to be liberated by the U.S. military that evening. SEAL Team Six embarked on board the USS Iwo Jima an Amphibious assault ship which then steamed for Port Said. It was decided that the raid would go ahead as long as the ship was in international waters, but would be put on hold if it was found in Egyptian waters. At mid-afternoon Wednesday, a ship-to-shore radio broadcast was made by Captain De Rosa, \\"I am the captain. I am speaking from my office, and my officers and everybody is in good health.\\" It was later discovered that De Rosa had made this false claim because Molqi was holding a gun to his head. =Hijackers disembark= Citing De Rosa's broadcast the Egyptian foreign minister met again with the four ambassadors urging them to accept a transfer of the hijackers to PLO control rather than seeking their arrest. Veliotes refused, holding that even without any murders the terrorists must be arrested for the hijacking itself. The British ambassador also refused to sign-off on the proposal. The Italian ambassador embraced the agreement, and the West German ambassador offered general but undefined support. The split positions was enough for the Egyptian government, and Foreign Minister Meguid informed Abbas and Hassan that the hijackers could leave the ship. Captain De Rosa told the passengers that the Palestinians had told him to relay an apology and the message that they had never intended to hijack the ship, \\"They had an assignment to do something in Israel.\\" At 5:00 p.m., the four Palestinian hijackers left the ship being taken ashore by the Egyptians in a tugboat. The terrorists waved goodbye to the former hostages, who applauded in relief at finding themselves freed. A crowd of Egyptian civilians ashore burst into cheers for the hijackers as they came into view of land, \\"Fedayeen, fedayeen, Allah akbar!\\" (\\"The guerrillas, the guerrillas, God is great!\\"). British Journalist Robert Fisk reported from the shore that one could see a streak down the side of the vessel, which turned out to be Klinghoffer's blood. As soon as the hijackers left the ship Marilyn Klinghoffer rushed to the infirmary looking for Leon. Not finding him the staff informed her to ask the captain who was still on the bridge. Klinghoffer climbed the steps on the infirmary's level – near the bottom of the ship, all the way to the bridge – near the top of the vessel. Captain De Rosa informed her of her husband's murder. Klinghoffer collapsed uncontrollably sobbing, friends helped her to her cabin. Freed hostages from Achille Lauro returning to the US by military aircraft De Rosa received a call from Italian Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti in Rome. He confirmed that he had regained control of the ship but inexplicably relayed that all of the passengers were well. Andreotti informed Craxi who was about to have a new conference on the successful conclusion of the situation. Craxi decided that it was best to double check the condition of the passengers and called De Rosa who finally admitted the murder of Leon Klinghoffer. Craxi altered his prepared remarks and at the new conference the world learned from him of the murder for the first time. The Klinghoffer's daughters and friends in New York had been celebrating the previous news which claimed all the hostages were safe, were contacted by the New York Times which had a reporter at the Craxi press conference, and informed of the death of their father and friend – turning their joy into despair. American ambassador Nicholas Vliotes boarded the Achille Lauro to confirm Craxi's information about Klinghoffer's death. He found De Rosa distraught, learned that Molqi had held the gun to his head during the ship-to-shore communication that claimed all the hostages were healthy. De Rosa in tears handed the ambassador Klinghoffer's passport. Veliotes called the American embassy with the ship-to-shore radio to give orders \\"Leon Klinghoffer was murdered by the terrorists off of Tartus when they were trying to get the attention of the Syrians. In my name, I want you to call the [Egyptian] foreign minister, tell him what we learned, tell him the circumstances, tell him in view of this and the fact that we – and presumably them – didn't have those facts, we insist that they prosecute those sons of bitches.\\" The American passengers of the Achille Lauro, having been held hostage for 51 hours, were taken by a U.S. military aircraft back to America on October 12, 1985. The aircraft had flown out of Rhein-Main Air Base, West Germany and stopped back there for refueling when heading to America from Egypt. =Hijackers in Egypt= With the hijackers on Egyptian soil and the knowledge of Klinghoffer's murder revealed different state actors put forward their position on what should be done. Italy's position was that the ship being Italian, it was legally Italian territory and therefore the hijackers should be extradited to Italy. Israel demanded that the hijackers be prosecuted, Benjamin Netanyahu (its representative to the United Nations) declared \\"Klinghoffer and his wife were singled out for one thing – because they were Jewish.\\" Ronald Reagan speaks at Sara Lee On Thursday, October 10, 1985, U.S. President Reagan, while on a tour promoting his tax-overhaul plan, at a planeside news conference at O'Hare International Airport, he told reporters it would be \\"all right\\" for the PLO if Arafat has \\"kind of a national court set up, like a nation that they can bring them to justice.\\" The President's aides realized that this would be tantamount to recognizing the PLO as a legitimate government which would be a reversal of the current policy that named it as a terrorist organization. At the next stop, national security affairs adviser Robert \\"Bud\\" McFarlane told the press that Reagan \\"meant that he wants the PLO to turn these hijackers over to competent authority for trial.\\" Minutes later, and less than an hour after his initial comments, Reagan held another question-and-answer session with the press, saying \\"I really believe that the PLO, if the hijackers are in their custody, should turn them over to a sovereign state that would have jurisdiction and could prosecute them as the murderers they are.\\" Administration officials (implying that the hijackers were also guilty of piracy) said the president's position was complicated due to uncertainty if the pirates had been released to the PLO or were still in Egypt. Later speaking to reporters at a stop to tour the kitchens of Sara Lee, Reagan said on the issue \\"apparently there's a little confusion, and maybe I'm responsible.\\" He said he had \\"not meant to imply\\" that the PLO should try the hijackers. When Abbas had ordered the hijackers to return the ship to Port Said, and the ship's captain had radioed Egyptian port officials – the problem fell onto Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak. The Egyptian government had competing interests he was attempting to balance. Mubarak wanted to maintain Egypt's peace treaty with Israel, the 1978 Camp David Accords, but also keep good relations with its fellow Arab states in the Middle East. The Israeli bombing of the PLO's Tunis headquarters the previous week had left many innocent Tunisians killed or wounded, adding to the pressures on Mubarak. He also wanted to maintain good relations with the US to not jeopardize billions of dollars in foreign aid. Mubarak decided to try to get the hijackers out of Egypt quickly. He thought this would work because of the recent previous precedent where the U.S. had \\"made no claims on the hijackers\\" of the TWA airliner earlier that summer. Additionally President Reagan had told the media that it would be \\"all right\\" if the PLO put the hijackers on trial. Mubarak's main impetus for his decision was Captain De Rosa's false report of no casualties. The Egyptian Government had intervened solely for humanitarian reasons to secure the release of the hostages and the vessel. Egypt had no normal basis for jurisdiction as the ship was of Italian registry, carried no Egyptian passengers, none of the hijackers were Egyptian, and their actions were outside Egyptian territorial limits. The Egyptian Government decided to honor its agreement to allow the Palestinians access to a plane to travel to a place of safety. The Egyptian government had given PLO officials in Tunisia 48 hours to take control of the four hijackers by Egypt. Arafat had told the Egyptians that he needed time to find a nation that they could take the four for trial. If the PLO could not find a cooperative nation, Egypt would release the men or turn them over to Italy. The PLO did not feel anxious about the agreement, one of its officials saying \\"Italy is a friend of ours, so it's no problem.\\" The PLO also asserted that the four were not PLO members but only a part of the PLF. Some in the International community, such as the US, held that this was a common tactic by Arafat. Holding that when one of the PLO's constituent groups committed an act of violence, he would claim that the group was rebelling from PLO control and beyond his control or influence. PLO official Farouk Kaddoumi also said that the claim that Kilinghoffer had been murdered was \\"a big lie fabricated by the intelligence service of the United States.\\" At a United Nations meeting in New York, he suggested to the UN Security Council that Klinghoffer might have died naturally, \\"Is there any evidence that those hijackers had killed the civilian? Where is the evidence?\\" The Reagan administration set a series of urgent messages to Cairo, urging the Egyptians to swiftly turn over the hijackers for prosecution either to Italy or the US. Reagan approved of a draft message to be sent on his personal behalf to Mubarak stating the same to be delivered by Ambassador Veliotes. Apparently seeking to avoid having to lie directly to the Americans, Mubarak refused to see Veliotes and also refused to take calls from George Shultz. On October 11, the day after the hijackers had disembarked the ship, Mubarak lied to the media when asked about them saying they had left within hours of coming ashore, \\"They have actually left Egypt. I do not know exactly where they have gone. Perhaps they have left for Tunisia.\\" His foreign Minister Esmat Abdel Meguid reiterated the same message \\"They left Egypt. I know where they are, but I am not going to tell you.\\" Mubarak would also falsely insist that the hijackers had left Egypt before he had information about Captain De Rosa's correction, \\"If the captain had told us that a passenger had been killed, we would have changed our position toward the whole operation. But when this [news of the murder] emerged, we already had sent the hijackers out of the country.\\" Mubarak also repeated the suggestion that no one had been killed \\"There is no body and no proof he has been murdered. Maybe the man is hiding or did not board the ship at all.\\" At the time of Mubarak's statements to the news media, the U.S. Administration had already received intelligence information that the hijackers were still in Egypt. Interception of EgyptAir jet Learning of the murder of a U.S. citizen, fearing the escape of the hijackers, and desiring a victory over terrorism, the Reagan administration ordered the EgyptAir passenger jet to be forced to land so the perpetrators could be brought to justice. =Planning= On the morning of Thursday, October 10, 1985, Oliver North had contacted Israeli Major General Uri Simhoni, the military attaché at the Israeli embassy in Washington. (Simhoni had been helpful in giving information that helped locate the Achille Lauro during the hijacking.) He relayed to North that the four hijackers were at the Al Maza airfield near Cairo. Later that morning American sources confirmed the information and added that the Egyptians were planning to transport the men out of the country at night, presumably to Tunis, aboard a commercial EgyptAir jet. James R. Stark realized that due to ongoing disputes that Egypt had with Libya and Chad that the plane would most likely fly over the Mediterranean sea which raised the option of intercepting it with U.S. Navy fighters. Stark recalled that during World War II, American fighters had acted on intelligence to intercept Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto and advocated a similar action (with a forced landing rather than shooting the aircraft down). Due to anticipated political problems the idea of forcing the plane to land in either Israel or Cyprus was dismissed. The NATO base at Sigonella, Italy, was chosen. North and Stark passed the idea onto John Poindexter who agreed with it and called Robert McFarlane who was traveling with Reagan to run the idea past the President. Reagan speaking with employees of Chicago's Sara Lee Bakery was informed of the option along with potential problems (such as finding the correct EgyptAir jet and possibly damaging relations with Egypt and Italy). A desire for successful assertive action against terrorism in the Reagan administration was further spurred by the memory of the political cost borne by President Jimmy Carter for a lack of the same (his inability to free American hostages seized by student demonstrators in Iran was held to been a major factor in his failed 1980 reelection bid). Despite covert CIA searches, the Reagan administration had also been frustrated in its inability to find American hostages held being in the Lebanon hostage crisis that had begun in 1982, nor had they had an opportunity for decisive action in the recent TWA hijacking. After listening to the idea of intercepting the EgyptAir jet, Reagan approved the operation in principle in what was called the \\"Sara Lee decision\\". Reagan's decision style was to reflect the broad-bush issues and leave details to his staff and Poindexter was tasked with fulfilling the President's decision. North was to remain in contact with Simhoni for any situational changes regarding the hijackers. Poindexter called Vice Admiral Art Moreau (then serving as assistant to Admiral William J. Crowe – the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff). Poindexter, on behalf of the President, told Moreau that Crowe was to start planning an intercept mission. Communications for planning began between the Pentagon, U.S. military headquarters in Europe, and the Navy's Sixth Fleet. Progress on difficulties (such as how to force the airliner to land or if weapons could be fired in warning) proceeded quickly, largely due to a lack of criticism from Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, who had developed a reputation for objecting to \\"incidental\\" use of armed forces. Upon learning of the idea while traveling in Ottawa, Canada, Weingberger objected, telling Crowe on a phone call \\"That's a terrible idea. I'm dead set against it, interfering with a civilian aircraft. We'll be castigated all over the world.\\" He told Crowe to \\"stop everything\\" and then called President Reagan in Air Force One to argue against the idea. Speaking to the president on an open, unencrypted radio channel Weinberger listed reasons to abort the plan. This discussion later became public because it was monitored by a ham radio operator. The operator revealed to the press that Reagan had not been convinced by his defense secretary and ordered him to make it happen. The final go-ahead was given by Reagan late that afternoon while returning to Washington on Air Force One. McFarlane contacted Poindexter who alerted the Pentagon. Orders were sent across the Atlantic to the aircraft carrier USS Saratoga and her aircraft made ready for the intercept. On October 10, 1985, the four hijackers boarded an EgyptAir Boeing 737 accompanied by Abu Abbas, Ozzuddin Badrakkan (also called Mohammed Oza – he served as chief of PLF military operations and a PLO official), and several members of Egypt's counterterrorism unit Force 777. The flight was set to fly to Tunisia, which was where the PLF headquarters were located. The airliner took off from Cairo at 4:15 p.m. EST. =Search for Flight 2843= The Saratoga was the flagship of a Sixth Fleet taskforce commanded by Rear Admiral David E. Jeremiah. It had just finished participating in a NATO exercise and was headed for Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia, when late in the evening it received the orders from commander of the Sixth Fleet, Vice Admiral Frank Kelso, and reversed course along with the rest of its task group. The Saratoga had been following the news of the Achille Lauro and had earlier tried to help locate it by dispatching aircraft, but the new orders came as a surprise to Jeremiah. He was to locate and intercept a commercial jet with the hijackers onboard coming out of Egypt but he did not know from where at what time and which jet. Jeremiah sent out F-14 Tomcat fighters along with an E-2C Hawkeye early-warning aircraft which carried a special radar that allowed its crew to track all aircraft within hundreds of miles. The operation would only be successful if the Hawkeye's crew could find the Egyptian airliner. The Saratoga launched several planes from Carrier Air Wing 17 (CVW-17) – four Grumman F-14 Tomcat (two belonging to VF-74 Be-Devilers and two belonging to VF-103 Sluggers), one Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye (belonging to VAW-125 Tiger Tails), two Grumman A-6 Intruder (belonging to VA-85 Black Falcons) and one Northrop Grumman EA-6B Prowler (belonging to VAQ-137 Rooks). Additionally another E-2C, three more F-14s and two electronic intelligence aircraft (a Boeing RC-135 and a Douglas A-3 Skywarrior) joined the mission. The flight operation was planned by Robert \\"Bubba\\" Brodzky. Before the Tomcats could be launched they had to have their radar-guided missiles removed and simpler weapons including tracer bullets installed. Around this time, Israeli intelligence agents found that the plane carrying the hijackers was an EgyptAir Boeing 737, flight 2843. They also determined its tail number and departure time. The information was passed onto Oliver North, relayed to the Pentagon, who relayed it to the Sixth Fleet, who relayed it to the Saratoga. The Hawkeye crew received the information before taking off. Ralph Zia, commanding officer of the Hawkeye, monitored the airways designated for commercial jets focusing on a converge point south of Crete. He and his crew tracked radar contacts flying west out of Egypt, presumably towards Tunisia. Zia had to send a Tomcat to visually determine if the contact was an EgyptAir 737, as there was no sensor that would confirm the exact identity of each radar blip. The fighter jets were commanded to perform the operation with lights out. Steve Weatherspoon, one of the Tomcat fighter pilots later recalled that the nighttime intercepts were not overly difficult \\"It wasn't a big deal. We got a good radar picture which safely controlled the intercept, and pulled close enough to get a visual identification. As we slowly closed, either we illuminated the aircraft with he glow of our exterior position lights, or tried to make out a silhouette by starlight. If its shape was similar to a 737, we had to get closer to see the carrier or national markings.\\" Two of the blips checked on by the Tomcats were U.S. Air Force Lockheed C-141 Starlifter transport planes flying without lights. They were carrying Major General Stiner and his special operations troops who had been set to storm the Achille Lauro. They were now being moved to Sigonella to capture the hijackers should the Navy jets succeed at their mission. After approaching between six and eight aircraft without finding the airliner, Weatherspoon and the pilot of the other Tomcat (William Roe \\"Skid\\" Massey) were instructed by Zia to approach another aircraft. Massey saw that the plane was a 737, his Radar Intercept Officer in the backseat, Dennis \\"Doc\\" Plautz, saw that it had an EgyptAir logo. Shining a flashlight on the fuselage they made out the tail number \\"SU-AYK\\". A radio call to the Saratoga confirmed that this was the correct plane. (Massey was able to close to within 15 feet of the Boeing 737 to read its registration.) The time was 5:30 p.m. EST. =Intercept= Unknowingly being shadowed by Tomcats, the EgyptAir Boeing 737 sought permission to land at Tunis but was refused. A request for permission to land at Athens was also refused. The Hawkeye had directed additional Tomcats to close with the airliner, and it began to communicate with the Boeing 737 on a VHF frequency demanding it divert to Sigonella, Italy. When the pilot of the EgyptAir Boeing 737 refused to comply, the Hawkeye gave the command to the Tomcats \\"Lights on, now!\\" With the illumination of the American aircraft, the Egyptian pilot suddenly realized he was surrounded by advanced war planes. The Hawkeye relayed to the Boeing that one way or another they must reach Sigonella. The Egyptian pilot later reported that the American fighter pilots had ordered him to comply with their commands or be shot down. He also stated that the military jets were in such close proximity that he had to request that they give him more room to safely maneuver. The airliner, flying wing-to-wing with several of the Tomcats, complied with the order to divert to Sigonella, touching down at 6:45 p.m. EST. The American position had hardened with news of the murder and it was ascertained that the PLO did not have plans to try the terrorists, rather they were being flown to a place of asylum. It was further discovered that the negotiator, Abbas, had actually been the mastermind behind the hijacking. This discovery also threw Arafat's claims of authority within a fractious PLO into question for the Americans and raised questions of his own culpability. Reagan viewed Egypt's allowing the terrorists safe passage to asylum as an unfriendly act when he had ordered the US military to intercept the Egyptian plane. =Securing the airliner= Minutes after the 737 touched down, two United States Air Force C-141 cargo planes landed with counter terrorist members of SEAL Team Six who quickly surrounded the airplane at the airstrip as it came to a halt. The Seals were prepared to assault the aircraft and secure the terrorists. With the 737 safely on the ground in Sigonella the Naval warplanes had closed the airspace overhead for all incoming aircraft. Stiner called the Egyptian pilot on the radio, telling him that his plane was now in the custody of US military. The pilot informed Stiner that an Egyptian ambassador was aboard and wanted to talk with him. A ladder was lowered from the forward door and the pilot, Captain Amed Moneeb, descended followed by Egyptian diplomat Zeid Imad Hamed. SEAL Team SIX commanding officer Robert A. Gormly met them and examined Hamed's credentials – finding them in order he escorted Hamed into the base and let him phone Egypt's foreign minister. Stiner then boarded the plane with an officer from SEAL Team Six. They found the four terrorists, Abbas, and Badrakkan onboard being guarded by ten armed members of Egypt's elite Force 777. Though Stiner had orders to arrest the terrorists, he made no attempt to do so at this time. The American special forces had surrounded the airplane, but soon found themselves surrounded by Italian military security (from the Italian Air Force and Carabinieri – the military police). They insisted that Italy had territorial rights over the base and jurisdiction over the hijackers. A standoff between both United States and Italian armed forces began. Sigonella crisis The choice of the Sigonella base to divert the EgyptAir 737 that had the hijackers of the Achille Lauro aboard caused a dispute between the governments of the US and Italy and included elements of their militaries. =Jurisdiction dispute= On the orders of U.S. President Ronald Reagan and his Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, the Egyptian airliner carrying the hijackers was intercepted by F-14 Tomcats from the VF-74 \\"BeDevilers\\" and the VF-103 \\"Sluggers\\" of Carrier Air Wing 17, based on the aircraft carrier USS Saratoga, and directed to land at Naval Air Station Sigonella (an Italian NATO air base in Sicily under joint Italian-American military utilization). The choice of Sigonella's airport became problematic for the Americans as they had no jurisdiction, and the Italians were not consulted regarding its use for this operation. The Egyptian flight, having been authorized by its government, was lawful under international law. The Egyptian government protested the American interception of its plane, which was not legal under international law. (Egypt's arguments were somewhat diminished by its own previous justification for its 1978 raid at Locna airport in Cyprus). Not only had the Americans not received consent from the Italians to forcibly land a non-hostile plane flying in compliance with international law at Sigonella, but the American military action was taken solely for American purposes (not those of the NATO alliance) and was taken in order to secure criminals – this was in violation of the purely joint military purposes that the Italians had agreed to when deciding to share the utilization of the base. =Armed standoff= A standoff occurred when 20 Carabinieri and 30 VAM (Vigilanza Areonautica Militare) contested for control of the plane with the 80 armed operatives of the U.S. Delta Force and SEAL Team Six. These contesting groups were soon surrounded by 300 additional armed Carabinieri (the Italian military police) who had also blocked off the runway with their trucks. The Italian Air Force (VAM) personnel and Carabinieri had already been lining up facing the US special forces soon after the American's main contingent had arrived by C-141s. Other Carabinieri had been sent from Catania and Syracuse as reinforcement. These events became known as the Sigonella Crisis. Stiner and Gormly contacted the Pentagon to inform them of the situation, and this information was passed onto the Reagan Administration. Members of the President's staff told the Italian government that the US special-operations team intended to arrest the hijackers. The Italians dismissed the Americans' claim of a right to do so, maintaining that the matter fell within their own jurisdiction due to the ship sailing under an Italian flag. A phone call took place between the US President Ronald Reagan and the Italian Prime Minister Bettino Craxi. Craxi claimed Italian territorial rights over the NATO base.Heymann, Philip B. (2001). Terrorism and America: A Commonsense Strategy for a Democratic Society. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press. Reagan informed Craxi that the US would seek extradition of the terrorists to face charges in US courts. Stiner and his men standing eyeball-to-eyeball with the 300 armed Italians, relayed to the Pentagon \\"I am not worried about our situation. We have the firepower to prevail. But I am concerned about the immaturity of the Italian troops. ... A backfire from a motorbike or a construction cart could precipitate a shooting incident that could lead to a lot of Italian casualties. And I don't believe that our beef is with our ally, the Italians, but rather with the terrorists.\\" The American leadership in Washington concluded that while Stiner and his men could take the terrorists it was unlikely they would be able to get them out of Italy. By 4:00 a.m. CET the next day, orders arrived for Stiner and his men to stand down. After five hours of negotiations, and with the knowledge that the Italian troops had orders (confirmed by President Francesco Cossiga) to use lethal force if necessary to block the Americans from leaving with prisoners, the U.S. conceded the Italian claim of jurisdiction over the terrorists. The Americans received assurances that the hijackers would be tried for murder and Stiner and three US officials were to remain at the airport to witness the arrest of terrorists by Italian authorities.Snyder, William P.; Brown, James (2004). Defense Policy In The Reagan Administration. Diane Publishing. p. 141. . =Talks between Italy and Egypt= After the US turned over control of the 737 to Italy, Egyptian diplomat Hamed returned to the plane with Italian base commander Colonel Annicchiarico. Hamed told the men of Force 777 that the Egyptian government had agreed to turn over the hijackers to the Italians. Both Abbas and Badrakkan refused to leave the plane claiming diplomatic rights – maintaining that they had diplomatic immunity as representatives of the PLO and Arafat. Learning of this the Egyptian government changed its position, declaring that the two were on board an Egyptian aircraft on a government mission – thus accruing extraterritorial rights. Egypt requested Italy let the plane leave with the two men on board as they had been brought to Italy against their will. When the Italians refused this demand the Egyptians denied Achille Lauro permission to leave Port Said. Prime Minister Craxi sent his personal foreign affairs advisor Antonio Badini to interview Abbas after boarding the airliner. Abbas' account held he had been sent by Arafat due to his persuasive argumentation style, that the four Palestinians had been triggered by panic to stage the hijacking, and that decisive role in releasing the passengers was his alone. Craxi appeared at a press conference late on Friday, October 11, acknowledging the role the two played in ending the hijacking, but inviting them to provide \\"useful testimony\\" and turning the matter over to the Italian court system. After continued talks between Italy and Egypt, the four hijackers were eventually removed from the 737, arrested by the Italian Carabinieri at Sigonella, and taken to the air base jail, then transferred to a local prison. The public magistrate in Syracuse announced late on the 11th that his inquires were complete and EgyptAir 2843 could depart for Rome with Badrakkan and Abbas aboard. Craxi saw this as a stalling tactic that was a courtesy to the US. The Italian foreign ministry contacted the U.S. embassy and informed them of the flight, saying that the two wanted to consult with the PLO office in Rome. The Americans viewed this as a prelude to Abbas being released. The 737 was then cleared by the Italians to fly to Rome's Ciampino airport with Abbas and Badrakkan still aboard. =Jet fighter showdown= U.S. Major General Stiner, in command of the American Special Operations Forces at Sigonella, upon learning that the 737 had been cleared by the Italians to proceed to Rome with members of the PLF still onboard, became concerned that there was no guarantee that once airborne it would travel to Rome rather than back to Cairo. He boarded a T-39 Navy executive jet (the North American Sabreliner) with other American Special Operations personnel and planned to shadow the 737. When the Egyptian airliner took off from Sigonella at 10:00 p.m. the T-39 was not granted clearance from that runway. In response the Americans used a runway alongside without receiving Italian permission to do so. In response to the unauthorized act by Stiner and the Americans, the Italians sent in two Aeritalia F-104S Starfighter warplanes of the 36° Stormo (Wing) from Gioia del Colle. These were soon joined by two more F-104s from Grazzanise airbase. In response to the Italian action, other warplanes (that have never been publicly identified but are assumed to have been American Tomcat F-14s) came up behind the Italian jets. The Italian jets also found their radar jammed above the Tyrrhenian Sea, with the assumption being it was done by a U.S. Northrop Grumman EA-6B Prowler. National Security Council staffer Michael K. Bohn in the White House Situation Room at the time, later recalled \\"Pilots on board the US and Italian jets exchanged colorful epithets over the radio about their respective intentions, family heritage, and sexual preferences.\\" Once the 737 approached Rome, the formation of US Naval fighters, turned back – only the T-39 with U.S. Special Operations Forces continued to the Ciampino airport. The Italian air-traffic controllers at Ciampino denied the T-39 permission to land, but the US pilot claimed there was an \\"inflight emergency\\" which gave him an automatic right to land the jet. This American violation of operating in Italian airspace and landing in a Roman airport without overflight or landing permissions was seen by the Italians as an affront to their laws and safety regulations and negatively influenced diplomatic relations between the countries for some time. Diplomatic relations with Egypt also were negatively impacted as they continued to demand an apology from the US for forcing the airplane off course. Abbas question The question of what should happen to Abu Abbas became complicated due to competing international pressures. =U.S. extradition attempt= With Israeli intelligence proving that Abbas was the mastermind behind the hijacking, the US Justice Department sought to deliver a warrant for his arrest to Rome that complied with the requirements of the U.S.–Italy extradition treaty. If such a warrant could be produced Italy in compliance with the treaty would be required to hold Abbas for 45 days. As the Justice department sought to avoid revealing Israeli classified intelligence information they began working with the Israeli embassy in Washington and officials in Tel Aviv to produce a declassified version that was strengthened with U.S. information. The Justice department then petitioned Judge Charles R. Richey of the U.S. District Court in Washington, DC who issued warrants for Abbas and the hijackers. The Situation Room transmitted a message from President Reagan to Prime Minister Craxi about holding Abbas and reminded him of the obligations under the extradition treaty. Attorney General Edwin Meese called his Italian counterpart Mino Martinazzoli informing him of the arrest warrants. The FBI notified Italian law enforcement agencies of the warrants. Maxwell Rabb, U.S. Ambassador to Italy delivered the warrants to Salvatore Zhara Buda at the Italian Ministry of Justice at his home at 5:30 a.m. Saturday, October 12. The Reagan Administration shared transcripts of radio conversations that took place between the hijackers and Abbas (along with other evidence obtained by the Defense Department and the Central Intelligence Agency) to indicate that he had remained close to the ship and directed the hijacking. Within hours of Rabb's early morning visit to his home, Buda met with three judges from the Ministry of Justice to review the petition. The group then advised Craxi and Italian Justice Minister Martinaaoli that the documents did not support a provisional arrest of Abbas. Craxi later announced that the Justice Ministry held that the U.S. request did not \\"satisfy the factual and substantive requirements laid down by Italian law\\", so there was no legal basis to hold him any longer as he was on board an aircraft that had extraterritorial status. While most in the Reagan administration were shocked by Italy's decision, Nicholas Veliotes in Cairo was not. To him, the document had obvious signs of Israeli Mossad involvement, a fact he anticipated would not please the Italians. Craxi and his cabinet meet at 1:30 p.m. on Saturday to discuss Italy's situation. Not only was the American situation clear, but Rabb interrupted the meeting with a personal plea from Reagan to hold Abbas. Craxi weighed whether Italy should upset the senior member of NATO or undermine its relatively good relations among Middle East nations. Egypt's President Mubarak was already lashing out at American arrogance and Italy's assistance in the affair. It continued to demand that Italy return its plane and Abbas, and seemed to be holding Achille Lauro as ransom for their return. The Egyptian populace was irate at the American action, Craxi worried that if the U.S. wound up with Abbas an outraged Egyptian populace might turn against Mubarak for caving in the face of pressure. Italy also had something approaching rapprochement with the PLO that kept its terrorists away from Italian citizens and interests. This was a result of a 1973 deal made between Italy and the PLO after an attack on an airport in Rome. The PLO would not target Italians in exchange for Italian acquiescence of its objectives. Arafat was able to contact Craxi warning him that \\"uncontrollable actions could result\\" if Abbas was turned over to the US. In support of the American position was Defense Minister Spadolini along with the provincial magistrate who had authorized the jailing of the four hijackers – he was joined in his opinion on the U.S. request by a judge in Rome. (Normally, provincial magistrates are the first to adjudicate extradition requests.) After consideration, Craxi and his cabinet voted to permit Abbas to depart from Italy. The Italian foreign ministry informed Egyptian ambassador and the American ambassador Rabb of the decision. Italy had decided that there was insufficient evidence to link Abbas to the hijacking and rejected a preliminary request from the US that Italy hold him. A standing agreement between Italy and the US that allowed suspects to be temporarily detained regardless of evidence was also put aside. Abraham Sofaer, a State Department legal adviser, complained to reporters that the Italians had rushed a decision on Abbas despite America's promise shortly before that even more proof would be provided to link Abbas to the hijackers. =Yugoslav escape= Following a deal made with Yassar Arafat with Giulio Andreotti even before the Craxi government had made its final decision, Abbas and Badrakkan wearing unidentified uniforms had been put back on the EgyptAir 737 airliner. They were joined by Egyptian diplomat Zeid Imad Hamed who had been with them in their initial flight from Cairo. Hamed had arranged for JAT, a Yugoslav national airline, to take the men from Fiumicino (Rome's main airport) to Belgrade. With no objections from Craxi, at 5:30 p.m. EgyptAir flight 2843 flew the 10 minutes from Ciampino airport to Fiumicino. Abbas and Badrakkan left the Egyptian plane, walked across the ramp escorted by Italian security forces and embarked on the Yugoslav aircraft. They left for Belgrade, Yugoslavia, at 7:10 p.m., Saturday, October 12, 1985. The next day, on October 13, the U.S. lodged a protest over Italy's allowing Abbas to depart and also requested his extradition from Yugoslavia (which diplomatically recognized the PLO). According to Abraham Sofaer, a State Department legal adviser, before the plane carrying Abbas to Yugoslavia even touched down, the Reagan Administration gave Yugoslav authorities the intelligence information it had passed onto the Italian government, along with \\"the transcripts and the hard evidence that we have accumulated in the 24 or 48 hours since then.\\" The Yugoslav government rejected the U.S. petition, saying it was legally groundless, and complained about the USS Saratogas participation in the capture of the hijackers. By October 14, Tanyug, the Yugoslav press agency, and PLO officials within Yugoslavia announced that Abbas had left Yugoslavia. The U.S. State Department released a statement declaring \\"extreme disappointment\\" that Yugoslav authorities had denied their request. International relations Egyptian President Mubarak continued his demand for a personal apology from U.S. President Reagan for intercepting the EgyptAir flight. There had been no contact between him and the Reagan administration around the interception and he had learned of it from the news media, he told reporters the incident was \\"unheard of under any international law or code,\\" and that \\"I am very wounded. Now there is coolness and strain as a result of this incident.\\" Mubarak also told reporters the incident was \\"strange and regrettable... When I heard of it, I said, 'What piracy is this?' I never thought that a friendly country would send four jetfighters to intercept an unarmed civilian plane. I was amazed. I believe it is theatrics and not heroism.\\" Reflecting on the U.S. relation with Egypt he said \\"May God help us to get over this matter. A long time must pass before we will be able to forget this painful wound.\\" Outside Egypt's Cario University thousands of demonstrators shouting anti-Israeli and anti-American slogans clashed with police – at least 30 were injured and dozens arrested. Some demonstrators called for Mubarak's assassination. There became a concern in the U.S. that Mubarak believed that he had been publicly humiliated by the U.S. and would move toward reconciliation with other Arab states at the cost of relations with Israel and the U.S. which was seen as being detrimental to Middle East peace efforts and perhaps even another Arab-Israeli war. An unnamed Egyptian source told the New York Times \\"Reagan has humiliated Mubarak and in the Arab world that is unheard of if you are supposed to be a friend.\\" U.S. State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman told reporters \\"What is important now is to put it behind us and concentrate on the larger issues, especially our shared commitment to peace in the Middle East.\\" When asked by a reporter if the U.S. had any reason to apologize for the diversion of the airliner, he replied \\"Never.\\" White House spokesman Larry Speakes stated that while the U.S. would work to restore good relations with Egypt there was to be no apology, \\"We've said everything we need to say.\\" During the incident the U.S. praised Egypt's efforts to save the lives of the hostages, never criticized Mubarak personally, but did make it clear that they were displeased by Egypt's \\"independent\\" decision to give the hijackers safe passage. White House spokesman Larry Speakes told reporters at the time \\"The United States wants to emphasize the fundamental and durable interest that the United States and Egypt share, interests which transcends this difficult incident.\\" Mubarak described what the U.S. had done as a \\"stab in the back\\". The Reagan administration sent a diplomatic envoy led by Deputy Secretary of State John C. Whitehead to Egypt for a \\"thorough and friendly discussion\\" telling Mubarak that they hoped to \\"put our recent differences behind us.\\" U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz met with Italian Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti voicing the American unhappiness with Italy's treatment of Abbas. Schultz also rejected a reporters suggestion that the U.S. interception was itself an act of terrorism. State Department spokesman Redman also said that despite the U.S. unhappiness with the actions of the Craxi government, U.S. relations with Italy remained close \\"We want to preserve the good, overall relations, which are based on shared interests which transcend this incident.\\" On October 17, 1985, Craxi's 26-month-old Italian Socialist-led government fell due to Defense Minister Giovanni Spadolini's Republican Party withdrawing from the five-party coalition the day before out of displeasure of Craxi's allowing Abbas to escape. Spadolini insisted that Craxi had not consulted him in the decision to let Abbas go free. The actions of Syria during the hijacking were seen as a positive by the U.S. with State Department spokesman Redman praising Damascus for its help in determining if a body that washed ashore was that of Klinghoffer. The U.S. also praised the Tunisian Government for refusing to allow the EgyptAir jet landing rights. Relations between the two governments had become frosty when the U.S. categorized the Israeli attack on the PLO headquarters on October 1, 1985, where 12 Tunisians were slain, as an action against a \\"terrorist sanctuary\\" which caused the Tunisians to say relations were \\"irreparable\\". The U.S. not vetoing a U.N. Security Council resolution that condemned Israel for the raid was seen as an attempt to improve relations. Klinghoffer's body On October 15, 1985, the Reagan Administration told reporters that a partially decomposed body that had washed up on the Syrian coast with a bullet hole in the skull fired from above was that of Leon Klinghoffer. At the time the four hijackers, Yasir Arafat, and Farouk Kaddoumi all continued to claim that no one had been murdered during the hijacking. The Administration announced that they would be convening a Federal grand jury to consider an indictment against the four hijackers and Abbu Abbas who was believed to have fled to South Yemen (a pro-Soviet Arab nation with no diplomatic relations to the U.S.).  Legal actions  There were several stages of court and legal actions taken against the hijackers of the Achille Lauro and Abu Abbas. = Jurisdiction = The US had originally planned to charge the terrorists with piracy under its Criminal Code of 1909 \\"whoever, on the high seas, commits the crime of piracy as defined by the law of nations, and is afterwards brought into or found in the United States, shall be imprisoned for life.\\" But this would have been problematic as the US recognized International Law on the matter, specifically the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention that stated \\"a seizure of a ship for political purposes is not considered piracy\\". Due to the murder, the US could claim jurisdiction under the passive personality principle and try the terrorists under its 1790 Crimes Act (although its Supreme Court had questioned in U.S. v. Palmer (1818) if the act extended to non-citizens). However, with the suspects turned over to Italian hands, to try the terrorists the US would have had to use the normal processes of extradition. Even had the Americans done so, Italy could have easily claimed its own right of jurisdiction as primary as the ship flew under an Italian flag, began its voyage in Italy, and the terrorists had come aboard in an Italian port. In the view of the Italian courts it was of no significance that the suspects found themselves in Italy's jurisdiction through no choice of their own, especially as there had been no wrongful act by Italian authorities. = Hijackers = In July 1986, an Italian court ruled the Palestinians guilty of \\"carrying out a kidnap with terrorist intent, leading to the death of a hostage\\". The court did not refer to the hijackers as terrorists, rather calling them soldiers fighting for their ideals.\\" Three of the hijackers were sentenced to prison terms ranging from fifteen to thirty years. While Youssef Majed Molqi (the hijacker who had shot Klinghoffer) received one of the longest sentences of the group, the court cited the conditions of his childhood growing up surrounded by violence in a Palestinian refugee camp as a mitigating circumstance. Another group of three Palestinians received sentences between six months and seven and a half years. The court ruled that Abbas had been the organizer and he and two of his colleagues received life sentences in absentia. Three others were acquitted on the grounds that they had not been properly identified in the indictment. On July 10, 1986, an Italian court convicted three of the terrorists who received prison sentences ranging from 15 to 30 years. An additional three people, including Abu Abbas, were convicted in absentia for planning the hijacking – they were sentenced to life in prison. The hijackers received lighter punishments because it was held by the court that they were acting on \\"patriotic motives\\", while Abbas and the planners had engaged in a \\"selfish political act\\" meant \\"to weaken the leadership of Yasir Arafat.\\" The fourth hijacker was a minor at the time of the seizing of the Achille Lauro and was separately tried and convicted. The fate of those convicted of the hijacking is varied: * Ahmad Marrouf al-Assadi (age 23 at 1986 trial) disappeared in 1991 while on parole, but in 1994 was known to Spanish authorities, during the trial of Monzer al-Kassar. * Bassam al-Asker (age 17 at 1986 trial) was granted parole in 1991. He was thought to have died on February 21, 2004, but according to the Lebanese Daily Star, he had instead fled the country. He spent 14 years in Iraq before travelling to the Nahr al-Bared refugee camp in Lebanon, training Palestinian militiamen to fight the US army alongside Iraqi rebels as of 2007.\\"Achille-Lauro hijacker plays a new game\\". The Daily Star (Lebanon). May 28, 2007. * Ibrahim Fatayer Abdelatif (age 20 at 1986 trial) was sentenced to 30 years' imprisonment. He served 20 and three more on parole and on July 7, 2008, he was expelled from an illegal immigrant detention center in Rome. He planned to appeal this, arguing that he has nowhere else to go since Lebanon will not allow his return as he was born in a refugee camp and is thus not a Lebanese citizen. * Youssef Majed al-Molqi (age 23 at 1986 trial), convicted of killing Leon Klinghoffer, was sentenced to 30 years. He left the Rebibbia prison in Rome on February 16, 1996, on a 12-day furlough and fled to Spain, where he was recaptured and extradited back to Italy. On April 29, 2009, Italian officials released him from prison early, for good behaviour. In June 2009, however, al-Molqui's attorney told the Associated Press that the Italian authorities had placed his client in a holding cell and were about to deport him to Syria. =Klinghoffer settlement= Marilyn Klinghoffer only learned the truth after the hijackers left the ship at Port Said. PLO Foreign Secretary Farouq Qaddumi later denied that the hijackers were responsible for the murder, and suggested that Marilyn had killed her husband for insurance money. Over a decade later, in April 1996, PLF leader Muhammad Abu Abbas accepted responsibility, and in 1997, the PLO reached a financial settlement with the Klinghoffer family. =Fate of Abbas= In January 1988, the US dropped its arrest warrant for Abbas deferring to his Italian conviction and due to insufficiency of evidence at the moment to take him to trial on different charges. The US Justice Department claimed that other countries that had evidence against him were refusing to cooperate with their prosecution. At a 1988 press conference in Algeria, Abbas offered a different explanation for the death of Klinghoffer \\"Maybe he was trying to swim for it.\\" No overt attempt to capture Abbas or enforce his sentence was made by Italy, who desired continued relations with the PLO. During the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, Abbas would move from Tunisia, to Libya. Abbas' PLF continued to receive Arafat's endorsement, and in 1990, President George H. W. Bush rescinded his earlier recognition of the PLO for Arafat's refusal to condemn a PLF attack. (In 1990, he masterminded a plot to attack Israeli beaches with 17 terrorists using hang gliders but they were intercepted by the Israelis who killed four of them.) In 1990, Abbas went into hiding and the US issued a warrant for his arrest with an offer of $250,000 reward for his capture, this was withdrawn in 1992 with the presidency of Bill Clinton and his administrations work towards the Oslo Accords. In 1990, Libya withdrew their support of the PLF, leaving Iraq as the only nation state actor supporting Abbas. In 1994, Abbas was given sanctuary in Iraq by Saddam Hussein. Abbas (born in a Syrian refugee camp) made his new home in Gaza (after being given amnesty in 1996 in line with the 1993 signing of the Oslo peace accords). He became a representative of the Palestine National Council. The administration of President Bill Clinton aware of Abbas' resurfacing neither asked for his extradition nor requested he be turned over to Italy who had found him guilty in absentia. The U.S. Senate passed a resolution 99–0 asking Clinton to request Abbas' extradition to the US. The Congressional Research Service held that the statute of limitations had not expired because Abbas was a fugitive from justice. Clinton's critics also pointed out that the US was not a signatory to the Oslo accords, and that they make no mention of the US's ability to prosecute anyone. Throughout the 1990s, Abbas moved back and forth from Baghdad to the West Bank, secretly recruiting more Palestinians to join the PLF, while he told the news media that he was reformed and that the Achille Lauro hijacking had been an accident. In 2000 during the Palestinian uprising he left Gaza, returning to Baghdad. While in Iraq, Abbas became the conduit through which Hussein, sworn enemy of Israel, paid $25,000 bounties to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers who killed Israelis. In 2001, the Israeli's caught two PLF cells that Abbas had recruited and trained after they had murdered an Israeli teenager. Bassam al-Ashker, one of the four Achille Lauro hijackers, had risen to be Abbas' top deputy in the PLF and was in charge of one of the cell's training, planning, and logistics. Cell members were arrested in the areas of Ramall and Jenin. One of them confessed that the PLF had trained them to use automatic weapons, rocket-propelled grenades, and bomb building at the Al-Quds military camp outside Baghdad. By the time the Israelis had captured the cell they had kidnapped and murdered Israeli teenager Yuri Gushchin, set off a bomb at an Israeli checkpoint (injuring five), planted failed bombs, and shot at Israeli vehicles. The cell was prevented from a planned mass killing at Ben Gurion airport and attacking targets within Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. The group was also charged with smuggling weapons in the diplomatically protected car of Palestinian Authority official Abdel-Razak al-Yehiyeh. Speaking to the New York Times in 2002 Abbas denounced Osama bin Laden and sought to distance the Palestinian cause from Al Qaeda's declared holy war against the United States. He stated that the PLF had a limited, historic goal of liberating Palestine, while Al Qaeda's goal was borderless and limitless. He held that the death of Klinghoffer was unfortunate collateral damage, similar to innocent Japanese civilians killed by the American use of atomic bombs on Hiroshima or Nagasaki. Also in 2002, the Israelis discovered that the PLF had recruited a new cell that had been sent to Baghdad to be trained by the Iraqi intelligence agency to use rocket- propelled grenades and Russian shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles. While training the cell was visited by Abbas and Ashker (who delivered instructions on surveying targets and executing plans). (The Israelis were able to disrupt the new cells plans before they could be orchestrated.) In September 2002, the Israelis found information in material they had seized when they occupied a section of Arafat's compound in Ramallah earlier that year. This information showed links between Abbas and Arafat and that the Palestinian Authority (along with Iraq) financed some of the PLF's expenses. On Monday April 14, 2003, during the Iraq War, Abbas was captured in the outskirts of Baghdad by U.S. Special forces acting on information from U.S. Intelligence. The Palestine Liberation Front had moved from Tunisia to Iraq after the Achille Lauro hijacking. American Special forces captured several others at Abbas' compound and seized documents and passports. Palestinian Cabinet member Saeb Erakat protested that the seizure of Abbas was in violation of the Oslo peace accords (signed by the US, Israel, the EU, Russia, Jordan, Egypt, Norway, and the Palestinian Authority) which agreed that no member of the PLO would be arrested or brought to trial for actions previous to September 13, 1993. In October 2002, President George W. Bush had accused Iraq of having \\"provided safe haven\\" for Abbas, presenting this as another rationale for military action. President George W. Bush In Cincinnati on October 7, 2002 charges Saddam Hussein's Iraq with harboring Abu Abbas. > \\"And, of course, sophisticated delivery systems aren't required for a > chemical or biological attack; all that might be required are a small > container and one terrorist or Iraqi intelligence operative to deliver it. > And that is the source of our urgent concern about Saddam Hussein's links to > international terrorist groups.

Iraq has also provided safe haven to Abu > Abbas, who was responsible for seizing the Achille Lauro and killing an > American passenger. And we know that Iraq is continuing to finance terror > and gives assistance to groups that use terrorism to undermine Middle East > peace.\\" Members of Bush's administration cited Abbas' capture as \\"yet another victory in the global war on terrorism\\" and (paraphrasing a Reagan quote from at the time of the EgyptAir interception) said that it sends terrorists the message \\"You can run, but you cannot hide. We will hold you to account.\\" Under American interrogation in Iraq, Abbas continued to deny direct involvement in the murder of Klinghoffer. He admitted planning the ship's seizure, but stated that he was not aboard the Achille Lauro at the time but in Jordan. On Monday March 8, 2004, Abbas, age 55, died of natural causes while an American prisoner in an Iraqi jail outside Baghdad. He had been held there while discussions about his legal status and whether he could be tried in the US or elsewhere had continued. Most US anti-terrorism laws with extraterritorial provisions had been enacted after the hijacking, and the Italian government despite having sentenced Abbas to five consecutive life sentences in absentia had not sought his extradition. Legacy Following the murder of Leon Klinghoffer, the Klinghoffer family founded the Leon and Marilyn Klinghoffer Memorial Foundation, in cooperation with the Anti-Defamation League. The Achille Lauro hijacking has inspired a number of dramatic retellings: *The Hijacking of the Achille Lauro (1989) is a TV drama based on the hijacking, starring Karl Malden and Lee Grant. *Voyage of Terror: The Achille Lauro Affair (1990) is a TV drama/action movie based on the hijacking, starring Burt Lancaster and Eva Marie Saint and directed by Alberto Negrin. *The Death of Klinghoffer (1991) is an opera by John Adams and Alice Goodman after a concept of theatre director Peter Sellars. Its depiction of the hijacking has proved controversial. * \\"The Visitors,\\" chapter 2 of Julian Barnes's novel A History of the World in 10½ Chapters, is based on the hijacking.

This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of Palau. The Republic of Palau is an island nation in the Pacific Ocean, 500 miles east of the Philippines and 2,000 miles south of Tokyo, forming the westernmost part of the Caroline Islands. Pre- independence The islands first used German colonial issues for the Caroline Islands, and then stamps of Japan from 1914 to 1944. Palau became part of the U.S. Trust Territory of the Pacific in 1947 and used U.S. stamps until 1983. Independence The first of Palau's stamps was issued in 1983 after gaining postal independence. Captain Wilson's Voyage Bicentennial Original stamp cancellation marks for the bicentenary se-tenant stamp set. The inspiration for these unusual bicentenary stamps came from George Keate's 18th-century book, Account of the Pelew Islands. Polly Cianciolo's research led to George Keate's rare book which pictured many Palau scenes dating back to the time when the islands were discovered. The stamp concept tells the story of the August 9, 1783, accidental discovery of the Islands when the English Captain Wilson shipwrecked the East India Company's packet, Antelope. The Antelope wreck off the coast of Palau, led to the first recorded encounter, both extended and harmonious, between Palauans and Europeans. This discovery is the theme of Palau's first postage stamp set. This se-tenant set of two blocks of four stamps, issued in 1983 were designed by New York City designer, Rosemary De Figlio and printed by House of Questa, a security printer in Great Britain. She used a selection of engravings from Keate's 18th-century book, Account of the Pelew Islands. De Figlio also illustrated the cameo of the Antelope that appears on every one of the 8 unique stamps. The Palau discovery story is detailed in a December 15, 1983, article found in Great Britain's Weekly Stamp Paper, “STAMP COLLECTING”, titled, “Captain Wilson’s Voyage”, by Barbara Last. That same publication's front cover featured an image of some of the stamps in color. The se-tenant stamp set received positive reviews from around the world. In addition, there are two original cancellation marks shown here - KOROR 12 June 1984 and Republic of Palau 19 June 1984 with a drawing of the Antelope. Both cancellation marks were designed and illustrated by Rosemary De Figlio.Palau Islands. Sandafayre Stamp Atlas. Retrieved 7 September 2011.

The chorale cantata is based on the hymn by Joachim Neander (1680).  History and words  Bach composed the cantata for the Twelfth Sunday after Trinity. It forms part of a cycle of chorale cantatas which Bach composed in Leipzig over a period of two years 1724–25. In 1724, his second year in the city, Bach had composed chorale cantatas between the first Sunday after Trinity of 1724 and Palm Sunday, but for Easter had returned to cantatas on more varied texts, possibly because he lost his librettist. Later Bach composed again chorale cantatas to complete his second annual cycle. This cantata is one of the completing works. It is based entirely on the unchanged words on the hymn \\"\\" (1680) by Joachim Neander. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from the Second Epistle to the Corinthians, the ministry of the Spirit (), and from the Gospel of Mark, the healing of a deaf mute man (). Unlike most chorale cantatas of the second cycle, but similar to the early , Bach left the chorale text unchanged, thus without a reference to the readings. John Eliot Gardiner assumes, looking at the festive instrumentation and the general content of praise and thanksgiving, that the cantata was also performed that year to celebrate Ratswahl, the inauguration of the town council. Bach used in 1729 the setting of the final chorale, transposed to D major, to conclude the wedding cantata with the last two stanzas of the hymn.  Scoring and structure  The cantata in five movements is festively scored for four soloists, soprano, alto, tenor and bass, a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of three trumpets, timpani, two oboes, two violins, viola, and basso continuo. # Chorus: # Aria (alto): # Aria (soprano, bass): # Aria (tenor): # Chorale:  Music  As Alfred Dürr and Gardiner observed, the text as well as the chorale melody is present in all movements. The cantata is constructed in symmetry: the soprano carries the melody in the outer movements, in movement 2 it is sung by the alto, and in movement 4 played by the trumpet. In the central movement, the beginning of both the vocal and the instrumental theme are derived from it in the most intimate setting of the work. The melody in bar form has a of unusual five measures and reaches a climax at the beginning of the , which Bach also stresses in a variety of means in the movements. In the opening chorus the trumpets, oboes and strings play a concerto; the soprano sings the cantus firmus while the lower voices prepare the entries by imitation on the instrumental motifs. For the words \\"\\" (Come join the crowd, psaltery and harps, awake!), the setting is homophonic and accented. In movement 2, a violin accompanies the embellished melody of the chorale. Bach included this movement in his Schübler Chorales, but on a text for Advent, \\"\\". In great contrast to C major and G major, the central duet is in E minor. Two obbligato oboes take part in the setting. In an unusual way, the first vocal section is repeated three times; only the words \\"\\" (in how much suffering) are set differently in \\"grinding chromatic descent\\". Movement 4 is in A minor, but the cantus firmus of the trumpet is nonetheless in C major, in \\"a battle for harmonic supremacy\\". In the final movement of his Christmas Oratorio Bach would later embed the chorale in doric mode in a concerto in D major. The independent vocal line quotes parts of the chorale melody several times. The words \\"\\" (consider this) are accented to a different meter. Bach set the closing chorale for four vocal parts, doubled by the strings and oboes, in a rather homophonic style, but adds a second quartet formed with the three trumpets and the timpani, the first trumpet \\"[soaring] above all\\", effectively illustrating the words of the final lines for an affirmative conclusion. Gardiner notes that Bach \\"knew exactly how best to use the resources of the ceremonial trumpet-led orchestra and choir of his day to convey unbridled joy and majesty.\\" << << ew Staff { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 3/4 \\\\key c \\\\major \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = \\"muted trumpet\\" \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\override Score.BarNumber #'transparent = ##t \\\\relative c'' \\\\repeat volta 2 { g'4^\\\\markup { \\"Trumpet I\\" } g g  g4. g8 a4  b g b  c b c8 a  b2 c4 } \\\\relative c'' { g'4. bes8[ a g]  f2. \\\\break  c4. d8 d4  e8[ d e f g a]  b2.  g2.~  g8[ f g a g a]  g a16 b b4 c \\\\bar\\".\\" } } ew Staff { \\\\clef treble \\\\key c \\\\major \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = \\"church organ\\" \\\\relative c \\\\repeat volta 2 { << { c4^\\\\markup { \\"Choir\\" } c g'  e4. d8 c4  b4. a8 g4  c d e8 f  d2 c4 } \\\\\\\\\\\\ { g4 g g  g4. g8 fis4  d g g  g b g  g( f) e } >> } \\\\relative c { << { e4. d8 e4  f2.  e4. f8 g4  g4. f8 e4  d2.  g,4 a b  c d e8. f16  d2 c4 } \\\\\\\\\\\\ { g4. g8 cis,8[ a']  a2.  a4. a8 d,4  c g' g  g2.  d4 d d  g g g  g2 e4 } >> } } ew Staff { \\\\clef bass \\\\key c \\\\major \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = \\"church organ\\" \\\\relative c' \\\\repeat volta 2 { << { e4 e d  c4. g8 c4  g' g, d'  c f, c'  d( b) g } \\\\\\\\\\\\ { c,4 c' b  c4. b8 a4  g2 f4  e d c  g' g, c } >> } \\\\relative c' { << { e4. e8 e cis  d2.  e4. c8 b a  g4 b c  b2.  b4 d g,  g g g8 c  c4( b) g } \\\\\\\\\\\\ { c,4 e a  d,2.  a'4 g f  e4. d8 c4  g2.  g'4 f8[ e] f d  e4 b c  g' g, c } >> } } >> >> \\\\layout { indent = #0 } \\\\midi { \\\\tempo 4 = 80 }  Recordings  * Bach Made in Germany Vol. 1 – Cantatas VII, Günther Ramin, Thomanerchor, Gewandhausorchester, soloists of Thomanerchor, Helmut Krebs, Franz Kelch, Eterna 1953 * J.

It was found to bind to many of the same receptors as LSD, but acting as a neutral antagonist rather than an agonist. However its generally similar behavior to LSD in some respects has shown to be very useful in one specific area, the treatment of cluster headaches. These debilitating attacks have been known for some time to be amenable to treatment with certain hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD and psilocybin, but because of the illegal status of these drugs and the kind of mental changes they induce, research into their medical use has been slow and therapeutic application limited to very specific circumstances under strict supervision. It had been thought that this specific therapeutic action against cluster headaches was limited to hallucinogenic drugs of this type, and would always present a major barrier to their clinical use. However a serendipitous discovery found that 2-bromo-LSD is also able to produce this therapeutic effect, despite lacking the other effects of LSD. This has led to a resurgence of interest and research into 2-bromo-LSD and its possible medical uses. Some isolated incidents of hallucinogenic responses have been reported, but as with other non-hallucinogenic LSD analogues such as lisuride, this appears to be a rare side effect occurring only in individuals with an as yet unexplained susceptibility to this reaction.Troxler F, Hofmann A.

Life The eldest son of Samuel Woodward the geologist, he was born at Norwich on 2 May 1816; Samuel Pickworth Woodward was his younger brother. He was sent in March 1822 to the Grey Friars Priory, a private school kept by William Brooke, to whom on 29 September 1828 he was apprenticed for four years. On the expiration of this apprenticeship he worked for a time under his father's supervision, copying armorial bearings and other heraldic devices for Hudson Gurney. He also studied botany, and kept notes, some of which were used by Hewett Cottrell Watson. In January 1834 he went as tutor in J. S. Buck's school at East Dereham, Norfolk, and late in the following year he obtained a post in the banking house of Messrs. Gurney at Great Yarmouth. Through the influence of friends at East Dereham he became attracted to the congregational ministry, and on coming of age left Yarmouth and went to study under William Legge at Fakenham, Norfolk, and Robert Drane at Guestwick. In 1838 he entered as a student at the newly established Highbury College, Middlesex, and graduated B.A. London, 17 June 1841. On 27 April 1843 he was publicly recognised pastor of the independent church of Wortwell-with-Harleston in Norfolk. He soon after began to apply himself to literary work, with the friendship of John Childs, head of the printing firm at Bungay, and acted for a time also as tutor to his grandsons. At the end of 1848 he resigned his pastorate, and, with the view of devoting himself solely to literature, removed to St John's Wood, London, in March 1849. In November 1853 he moved to Bungay to be nearer to his friends the Childs, who were concerned in the production of his larger works, and whom he assisted in many of their undertakings; but in 1858 he returned to the neighbourhood of Hampstead. On 2 July 1860 he was appointed librarian in ordinary to the queen at Windsor Castle. Under the superintendence of the prince consort began the rearrangement of the collection of drawings by the old masters at Windsor. He died at his official residence, Royal Mews, Pimlico, on 12 October 1869; he was succeeded as Royal Librarian by Richard Rivington Holmes. Woodward was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1857.

The band reunited in Minneapolis, MN in August 2017 for their first show in 20 years. Biography The Siren Six! initially formed under the name Stinkfish in Minneapolis around 1994, consisting of vocalist/guitarist Nate Bott, keyboardist Frank Staniszewski, drummer Jeff Conrad, bassist Tim Resudek, trombonist Kevin Matheny and saxophonist John Reineck. After building up a loyal following on the Midwest ska circuit, Stinkfish released their sole LP ...Does It Again in 1995 on the band's self-run label Mr. White Records. Shortly afterwards, Resudek left the band, and, following the addition of Jacy McIntosh, Stinkfish officially changed their name to The Siren Six!. Signing to Minneapolis-based ska label Kingpin Records, home to such bands as Animal Chin and The Pacers, The Siren Six! recorded their debut album The Voice With a Built-In Promise in 1996. Citing the Pixies, Elvis Costello, The Jam and The Selecter among their influences, The Siren Six!'s music stood in contrast to the then-popular ska punk sound, combining 2-Tone-style ska with heavy indie rock and Mod influences and a focus on introspective lyricism, a combination Kingpin Records marketed the band with as \\"2tone/mod/emoska\\". Following a national tour with Slow Gherkin, the band recorded their follow-up album, the EP Young and Professional, in early 1998. Unlike the overtly ska-based sound of their debut, Young and Professional featured a more prominent focus on rock and power pop, though still retained a distinct ska influence. In the summer of 1999, The Siren Six! relocated to Los Angeles, California in the hopes of landing a major record deal. However, heightened tensions within the band eventually led to their break-up the following year. Since their disbandment, members of The Siren Six! have moved on to numerous musical projects. Bott and Staniszewski went on to play in the Los Angeles-based pop rock band Big City Rock from 2001 to 2008, before forming another group called The Remainers in 2009. Jeff Conrad was also a member of Big City Rock from 2001 to 2003, when he left to replace Jason Schwartzman in Phantom Planet. Since 2003, Reineck has fronted the New York indie rock band Soft, while McIntosh has played in several national touring bands in the Twin Cities from 2000-2005 including End Transmission, Askeleton and Ela, before forming his current project THEMES in 2005. McIntosh is also currently a member of Velvet Teen. In 2007, Conrad released a trailer on his YouTube account for a prospective Siren Six! documentary entitled Six Is One, chronicling the band's move from Minneapolis to Los Angeles. On June 26, 2018, the 47-minute documentary was released for free on YouTube. In May 2017, The Siren Six! announced a \\"One Night Only\\" reunion show in Minneapolis at The 7th Street Entry on August 26, 2017, to support the 20th Anniversary Re-releases of the band's previous catalogue on Jump Start Records. The show quickly sold out, so another show was added earlier the same evening. Shortly after, the band announced two additional shows in California in late August, one in San Francisco and another in Pomona, both to be supported by Slow Gherkin.

A tributary of the Enz, it gave its name to the town of Nagold. It merges with the smaller Enz in the town centre of Pforzheim.  Physical geography  = General = The Nagold is 90.7 kilometres in length and has its source in Urnagold in the municipality of Seewald in the Northern Black Forest and flows in an easterly direction past Nagold, Calw and Liebenzell and joins the Enz in Pforzheim, near what is now the Parkhotel Pforzheim. The Nagold flows mainly through the Black Forest. Around the town of Nagold (between Rohrdorf and Pfrondorf) it flows through the Heckengäu region. At the Pforzheimer Kupferhammer, it enters the Pforzheim Enz Valley, which, like the Heckengäu, also belongs to the natural region of the Gäu.Friedrich Huttenlocher & Hansjörg Dongus, Die naturräumlichen Einheiten on Sheet 170 Stuttgart, Bad Godesberg 1967 (series Naturräumliche Gliederung Deutschlands). The Nagold is regarded by convention as a tributary of Enz. However, it carries more water than the upper course of the Enz at their confluence, is longer by a factor of about 2, and has a larger catchment by a factor of 3.5. Hydrographically, therefore, the main line of the Enz-Nagold-river system runs along it them. The upper Enz, however, has the wider valley and maintains its direction of flow. The upper reaches of Nagold run predominantly east and southeast as far as the town of Nagold, where it swings almost completely around, to head to Pforzheim, mainly in a northerly direction. The Nagold has formed numerous loops and 'meander hills' (Umlaufberge), for example at Pfrondorf (Bettenberg), in Wildberg, at Hof Waldeck (Schlossberg hill and Waldeck Castle), near Tannenberg (Rudersberg, with hillfort) and in Weißenstein. The source of the Nagold is a spring called the Nagoldursprung at Urnagold in the municipality of Seewald, on the territory of Besenfeld. After just a few kilometres, at Erzgrube, the Nagold is impounded to form the Nagold Reservoir. Up to the first town, Altensteig, the Nagold valley is mostly uninhabited. In front of Rohrdorf, the Nagold leaves the Black Forest, makes its great change of direction at the foot of the ruins of Hohennagold and enters the Black Forest again north of Pfrondorf. The Nagold now passes through the above mentioned meander hills as well as its most important settlements: Wildberg, Calw, Hirsau and Bad Liebenzell. Between Dillstein and Pforzheim the Nagold leaves the Black Forest and enters into the former old town of Pforzheim merging with the Enz from the right and south. The Enz then continues eastwards to Besigheim where it empties into the Neckar. = Tributaries = The main tributaries of the Nagold are the: * Zinsbach, a right-hand tributary, 13.3 km long with a 33.8 km² catchment, which joins the Nagold before the town of Altensteig * Köllbach, a left-hand tributary, 10.0 km long with a 29.9 km² catchment, which joins after the town of Altensteig * Waldach, a right-hand tributary, 24.7 km long with a 157.1 km² catchment, which joins at the Nagold Knee (Nagoldknie) in the borough of Nagold * Teinach, a left-hand tributary, 15.4 km long with a catchment of 61.5 km², which joins near Teinachtal. * Würm, a right-hand tributary, 53.9 km long with a catchment of 418.3 km², which joins south of Pforzheim, shortly before leaving the Black Forest  Political Geography  The Nagold flows through the counties of Freudenstadt, Calw and Pforzheim (urban county). Until the great territorial upheavals around 1803 and 1806, the course of the Nagold was predominantly on the territory of Old Württemberg. Smaller areas belonged to the Margraviate of Baden or the Order of Saint John. Altensteig, Nagold, Wildberg, Calw and Liebenzell were the administrative centres of the Old Württemberg; Hirsau and Reuthin were Old Württemberg monastic estates. Hirsau Abbey was important in European history. The present areas around Pforzheim (territories of Weißenstein, Dillstein and Pforzheim) belonged to Baden. Rohrdorf was the seat of a commandry of the Order of Saint John under Württemberg's sovereignty.Historischer Atlas von Baden-Württemberg, Map VI/13  Transportation  Weißenstein with the arch bridge in the background The Nagold valley between Pforzheim and Altensteig forms the backbone of various main transport axes. North-south traffic between Pforzheim and Nagold and further towards Horb is carried by the B 463 and Nagold Valley Railway. Between Nagold and Altensteig the Nagold valley picks up the important east- west link of the B 28 (whose traffic increasingly however is switching further south to the direct link between Freudenstadt, Horb and Tübingen, because the B 28 between Tübingen and Freudenstadt via Herrenberg, Nagold and Altensteig runs in a large arc to the north). Until its closure in 1967 there was a narrow gauge railway between Nagold and Altensteig: the Altensteigerle.  Economy  Timber rafting was important in the Black Forest until the early 20th century. Like the Enz, the Nagold was used to transport logs. Many places, such as Weißenstein, earned their living from timber rafting and ponds were created in the river for this purpose, e.g. near the village of Erzgrube. In the Black Forest today, the timber industry is still important; around Nagold agriculture is more prominent. Heavy industry and service industries play a key role, especially in Pforzheim (jewellery, precious metals, clocks, business, administration), as well as Ebhausen, Nagold, Kentheim (historic cotton mill), Calw (county town) and Liebenzell (spa).  Protected areas  On its way to its confluence with the Enz, the Nagold runs mainly through protected areas. #In its upper reaches in the county of Freudenstadt is the Nagoldtal protected area, covering 555.5 hectares, which was established on 1 July 1991 as number 2.37.044 by Freudenstadt council. #In the county of Calw the protected area is still called the Nagoldtal. It covers 4,384 hectares and was established by Calw council as no. 2.35.037 on 24 November 1971. #In its lower reaches to its mouth the Nagold flows through the protected are of Landschaftsschutzgebiet für den Stadtkreis Pforzheim, established by the town council of Pforzheim as no. 2.31.001 on 12 December 1994.

It is located in the glen of the Quair Water, around south-west of Innerleithen, and south-east of Peebles, in the Scottish Borders. The estate is recorded from the 13th century, but the present Glen House was built in the mid 19th century. The house is protected as a category A listed building, and the grounds are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland, the national listing of significant gardens. Besides the house, the Temple, stables, and the \\"Lion Gate\\" are also category A listed. History In 1296, it is recorded that Sarra of the Glen swore allegiance to King Edward I of England. The estate was later split up, and comprised the two estates of Easter Glen and Wester Glen by the 18th century. It was reunited under the ownership of Edinburgh banker Alexander Allan in 1796, who purchased Easter Glen in that year for £10,500. His son William Allan, Lord Provost of Edinburgh from 1829–1831, commissioned William Henry Playfair to extend the existing farmhouse. The first parklands were laid out at this time, with drainage and planting carried out around the house, and a garden temple, designed by Playfair, was built. In 1852, The Glen was purchased, along with , by the industrialist Charles Tennant (1823–1906). Tennant commissioned David Bryce to design a new house, which was built in the Scottish Baronial style between 1854 and 1855. Bryce was commissioned to add a tower to the house in 1874. Tennant also carried out improvements in the parks until the 1890s, adding farm buildings, a kitchen garden, estate cottages and a school. Tennant sat in Parliament from 1879 to 1885, in which year he was made a baronet. His family became prominent members of late Victorian and Edwardian society, and The Glen was regularly used by shooting parties. In 1894 his daughter Margot married the future Prime Minister H. H. Asquith. On Sir Charles' death in 1906 the estate passed to his son Edward (1859–1920), who was created Baron Glenconner in 1911. Following a fire at The Glen in 1905, Robert Lorimer was commissioned to oversee repairs and remodelling of the interior. Formal gardens were also added at this time, to Lorimer's design. Further interior decoration was carried out by family friend Syrie Maugham in the 1920s. Another family friend, Princess Margaret, the Queen's sister, visited The Glen on several occasions. The Glen remains in the possession of the Tennant family, and is leased out for film shoots and conferences and has hosted seminars and other events on green finance and sustainability issues.

Later King George of Poděbrady of Bohemia appointed him to Lord Chamberlain of the District Court at Brno and in 1473 by the Anti- King Matthias Corvinus made him one of the four governors of Moravia.  Life  John's father, William I of Pernstein was in the service of the Margrave Jobst of Moravia. John later inherited some important state offices from his father. John's mother was either William's second wife Agnes of Pottenstein () or his third wife Anna of Sternberg. John II is first mentioned in a document of 1427, when he and his father sold a piece of land to the abbess of the monastery Doubravník, which had been founded by Štěpán of Medlov, a predecessor of the Pernstein family. In the same year, his father gave him the right to manage his own assets. In 1429, he participated in the Hussite invasion of the Margraviate of Meissen. Meissen was looted and pillaged. Prior to 1434, John II acquired the lien of Mitrov from Hynek Hlaváč, which he kept at least until 1448, as in that year an entry was made in Landtafel. Between 1434 and 1436, several knight from villages belonging to the Lordship of Pernstein accused him of occupying their villages illegally. He attempted to settle these feuds. In 1437, King Sigismund of Bohemia died. Sigismund's son- in-law Albert II was a candidate to succeed him. John opposed this; he and Hynek Ptáček of Pirkstein supported the candidacy of Casimir IV Jagiellon, the almost eleven-year-old son of King Władysław III of Poland. Nevertheless, Albert II was elected King of Bohemia. Probably around 1441, John II married his second wife, Bohunka of Lomnitz. Her father, John of Lomnitz, transferred the liens on the margraviate fiefs Zubštejn, Pyšolec and Bistritz to John II. In 1446, King George of Poděbrady made these liens into hereditary possessions of the Pernstein family. John II also acquired the Lordship of Křižanov from the heirs of the late Sigmund of Křižanov. He made claims on lands in Tišnov which had belonged to the Porta coeli Convent before it was destroyed during the Hussite Wars. In the years 1463, 1467, 1469 and 1470, King George authorized John II and his sons Sigmund, William, Jan and Vratislav the use of the usufruct of these lands. In 1462, John II purchased the Lordship of Jimramov from John of Cimburg and Tovačovští and his wife Sophie of Kunštát. He was able to significantly expand his property through acquisitions and liens. King George of Poděbrady appointed John II in 1460 to Lord Chamberlain of the District Court at Brno. John II was an expert on Moravian law. John II always remained loyal to King George. After George's death in 1471, however, he switched sides and supported the counter-King Matthias Corvinus. John II was one of the four governors of Moravia Matthias appointed in 1473. Around this time John's second-born son William II of Pernstein came into the foreground more often. When William II acquired the Lordship of Helfštýn, John II acted as a witness. When John died in 1475, he left his sons and his young widow extensive properties. At his request he was buried in the monastery church of Doubravník. His widow remarried in 1480 with Marquart of Lomnitz and after Marquart's death in 1482, with Berthold of Tworkau. A bible manuscript from the year 1471 in the National Library in Prague is richly decorated with illuminations and contains the coat of arms of John of Pernstein, suggesting that it was commissioned by him. It is therefore referred to as the \\"Pernstein Bible\\" ().  Marriage and issue  John of Pernstein was married three times. His first marriage was with Barbara of Waldstein (). They had two children: * Sigmund of Pernstein (; born: ; died: 1473 or later), a supporter of King George of Poděbrady * Catherine (born: ; died: 1449) After Barbara's death (before 1445), John married Bohunka of Lomnitz (), who died in 1475.

A pupil of Bohemian composer František Martin Pecháček and German conductor Louis Spohr, Wexschall was married to the Danish stage actress and mezzo-soprano opera singer Anna Nielsen. Life He was the son of John Thorkildsen Wexsal, a Norwegian farmer's son who became chief huntsman to the Danish Crown Prince, and later manager of the Amalienborg Palace, and Jacobine Caroline, née Holm. In 1823 he was married to the Danish actress and opera singer Anna Nielsen; the marriage was dissolved in 1831, and later he married Caroline, née Dam (d. 1848). Taught on violin, first by his father and later by music professor Peter Mandrup Lem, he was already appearing at concert halls at a very young age. In June 1812 he became a pupil in the chapel of concert master , evolving to an excellent violin player. Between 1820 and 1822 he traveled with abroad, where he studied under masters such as Karl Moser in Berlin, Pecháček in Vienna and Spohr in Kassel, and gave concerts, which were well received even in the perfectly pampered violin playing circles in Paris. Critics called him Wexschall, and reviews like this he kept for the future, perhaps as a small persiflage against Professor Schall, who always ignored him. Despite the universal acclaim at home and abroad Wexschall did not advance to a higher position than 2nd ballet Répétiteur and 1st second violinist in the chapel after his return to Copenhagen in 1824, but he gradually worked his way to becoming the person whose strong and broad bow-strokes led the ensemble in the orchestra, and by Schall's death Wexschall became director of the royal violin school with predicate of concert master in 1835. Among his students must be mentioned the names of Holger Simon Paulli, Ole Bull and Niels Gade. The music scene suffered a great loss as a corrosive disease led him to death on 25 October 1845, a year after both his parents died.

Chief Constable His appointment at age 37 was not without controversy, but he was a visionary policeman. Nottingham was the first city in Britain to develop an ARP (Air Raid Precautions) network.

It is considered a representation of Joseph Stalin's cult of personality. Plot summary In 1924, veteran Bolshevik Petrov, a resident of Tsaritsyn, begins carrying a letter to Vladimir Lenin, to inform him about Kulak brigands roaming the land and spreading death and misery. The Kulaks murder him. His widow, Varvara, continues his quest, joining a group that travels to Moscow. When they arrive, they discover that Lenin is dead. In the Kremlin, Vyacheslav Molotov tells Anastas Mikoyan that now, Grigory Zinoviev, Lev Kamenev and Nikolai Bukharin will attempt to subvert the party by attacking Stalin, Lenin's devout disciple. Stalin, mourning his teacher's passing, delivers a eulogy at the funeral, calling for all attendants and all the people of the Soviet Union to vow to maintain Lenin's legacy. The people swear. Varvara sees Stalin and hands him over the blood-stained letter, marked \\"To Lenin\\". Varvara's son Sergei becomes an inventor, developing the first Soviet tractor with Stalin's encouragement. Her other son, Alexander, becomes manager of the Stalingrad Tractor Factory. Stalin leads the people of the USSR in implementing the Five-Year Plans and in industrializing their country, in spite of Bukharin's resistance. American saboteurs burn the tractor factory, killing Varvara's daughter, Olga. As the Germans threaten war, Sergei travels to Paris to warn of the impending danger. The French and British reject Soviet warnings. As the Second World War begins, the two sons volunteer for the front. At the end of the war, Varvara and Stalin meet again in the Kremlin. Stalin kisses her hand, in recognition of Soviet mothers' contribution to victory, telling her that soon, everything that Lenin foresaw will be fulfilled.

Liehm. The Most Important Art: Soviet and Eastern European Film After 1945. . Pages 51-52. The production of The Vow was delayed by the Second World War, during which the personality cult of Stalin was set aside in favour of patriotic motifs, to encourage the populace to resist the enemy. Even before the German surrender, as victory seemed secure, the cult gradually began its return to the screen; after 1945, it reached new heights, much more than before the war.Denise J. Youngblood. Russian War Films: On the Cinema Front, 1914-2005. University Press of Kansas (2007). . Pages 95-101. Playwright Iosef Prut, who was present when Chiaureli held a screening for Stalin, recounted that the Soviet premier disapproved of the ending scene, in which he was shown kissing Varvara's hand, telling the director he never kissed a woman's hand in his life. Chiaurely replied \\"the people know better what Stalin does and doesn't do.\\"Andrei Konchalovsky, Alexander Lipkov. The Inner Circle: An Inside View of Soviet Life Under Stalin. Newmarket Press (1992). . Page 29.Stalin confirmed his declaration in another occasion. At 1947, during a Kremlin dinner, a drunken guest insulted Nina, Lavrentiy Beria's wife.

Chaiureli, Pavlenko, and actors Gelovani, Sofia Gyatsintova and Mikhail Plotnikov all won the Stalin Prize, 1st degree, during 1947. At 1 July 1946, Pravda's critic wrote \\"In The Vow... It is demonstrated how all the actions of Comrade Stalin were consecrated, in unity with the will of the people... The artistic and ideological merit of the picture is in its portrayal of the love and confidence of the people toward Comrade Stalin.\\" The Vow. kinoglaz.fr. The film was approved by French censors, in spite of police protests that it would threaten public order, although a scene negatively featuring Georges Bonnet was removed.André Bazin, Bert Cardullo. Bazin at Work. Routledge (1997). . Pages 23-30, 34-35. News of the World's critic later dubbed it \\"the film they dare not show in Paris\\".David Caute. The Dancer Defects: the Struggle for Cultural Supremacy During the Cold War. Oxford University Press (2003). . Pages 127-131. In a 1949 article published in Les Lettres Françaises, Georges Sadoul called it \\"a film the qualities of which might offend the delicate, amateurish scholars and the admirers of Orson Welles... The Vow is the future of cinema, no less than Citizen Kane... The beautiful images from it are engraved in memory, monumental and sophisticated.\\" At an article from 25 May 1950, he wrote that the film \\"opened the most glorious era in Soviet cinema.\\"Natacha Laurent. Le cinéma stalinien : Questions d'histoire . Toulouse PU Mirail (2003). . Page 223. Film director Grigori Roshal described the film as \\"an epic legend, a sharp satire, a fiery pamphlet about enemies and a sincere story of simple Soviet people.\\" André Bazin, who researched Stalinist cinema, regarded the film as a piece of propaganda, remarking that \\"the only difference between Stalin and Tarzan is that films about the latter do not pretend to be documentaries.\\" The New York Times reviewer Bosley Crowther noted that the film is \\"a tribute to Stalin... About as flowing and fulsome as could be... In short, The Vow is not subtle. It beats the drum and raises the flag for him... About as coyly as a May Day parade.\\"Bosley Crowther. Movie Review: Klyatva. New York Times, 23 June 1947. After Stalin's death in 1953, The Vow was removed from circulation. Subsequent to the 1956 Secret Speech, it was banned and placed in the archives. Nikita Khrushchev later admitted he greatly disliked the film, calling it and Chiaureli's works in general \\"a bootlicker's idea of art!\\"Nikita Sergeevich Khrushchev, Sergeĭ Khrushchev.

The Red Atlantis: Communist Culture in the Absence of Communism. Temple University Press (1999). . Pages 31-33 =Critical analysis= Richard Taylor noted that The Vow signaled a transformation in Stalin's cult of personality: rather than being seen merely as Lenin's successor, the premier was now also credited as a leader on his own right, by highlighting his role as the nation's savior during World War II. Unlike Chiaureli's next film, The Fall of Berlin, Lenin still had a considerable impact on the plot, but only in an inspirational manner - he was not seen alive, and the film deals with his burial.Richard Taylor. Film propaganda: Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany. I.B. Tauris (1999). . Page 99. According to author Evgeni Dobrenko, Stalin's new status was hinted in another form: on the very month in which The Vow was released, the second part of Ivan the Terrible was sharply condemned by critics. Historical films like Ivan and Peter the Great, that depicted great leaders of the past, served to reinforce the need for a strong ruler and legitimize Stalin's autocracy. With the prestige acquired by victory in World War II, he no longer needed this kind of support.Evgeni Dobrenko. Stalinist Cinema and the Production of History: Museum of the Revolution. Edinburgh University Press (2003). . Page 59. Peter Kenez wrote that it was \\"the first film entirely devoted to Stalin himself.\\" Kenez also noted that the picture was the most exhaustive Stalinist interpretation of history seen on screen.Peter Kenez. Cinema and Soviet Society from the Revolution to the Death of Stalin. I.B. Tauris (2001). . Pages 209-211. J. Hoberman wrote that it \\"replaces history\\", by depicting all that transpired between Lenin's death and the victory in the war, in accordance with the official Soviet narrative: Stalin rises to power, promotes the Five-Year Plans, brings prosperity to the people, attempts to convince the treacherous capitalists to form an alliance against Nazi Germany and then leads the Soviet Union to victory against Hitler. No mention of the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact is made in the film. According to Edvard Radzinsky, Pavlenko intentionally combined Christian motifs in the plot, to induce an identification of Stalin with Jesus; Lenin played the part of John the Baptist in selecting him as Messiah.Edvard Radzinsky (1996). Stalin. Random House. . page 536. Bazin described the funeral scene as \\"a descent of Lenin's holy spirit unto Stalin, the new Moses.\\" Kenez viewed The Vow as \\"a turning point in Soviet cinema... It set the tone for many others to follow.\\" Antonin and Miera Liehm commented that upon its release, \\"a style was born\\" of pictures \\"with Stalin always at their center... that fulfilled Andrei Zhdanov's requirements in their entirety... And so became the model for other filmmakers.\\" Awards *1946 - Venice International Film Festival - special mention of the jury of international critics. *1947 - Stalin Prize I degree (to director Mikheil Chiaureli and actors Mikheil Gelovani, Sofia Gyatsintova, Nikolai Plotnikov).

Innovative practices in Lifelong Learning have been developed to support entrepreneurs, managers, and professionals in Small and Medium Enterprises to gain competitive advantage through the exploitation of their Enterprise Cultural Heritage when designing and developing products and services. Research studies, looking at the needs of Small and Medium Enterprises demonstrate the existence of the characteristics of Enterprise Cultural Heritage in businesses (mainly related to the craft sector), describe how Enterprise Cultural Heritage is perceived in business organization in terms of practices, information, knowledge, and address the skills and competences needed to manage Enterprise Cultural Heritage.  The four aspects of Enterprise Cultural Heritage management  The previously mentioned research studies found that Enterprise Cultural Heritage management is based upon the combination of Skills that consist of the combination of four main skill areas: * Brand management * Change management * Heritage management * Intellectual property management For each skill area a number of competences have been identified which can help leverage the Enterprise Cultural Heritage potential of the organisation into competitive advantage. The competence mix needed is determined case by case using structured analysis and planning methodologies to help a business to gain awareness of the core elements of Enterprise Cultural Heritage and identify the heritage values attached to the business. These can then be exploited through Branding and Marketing by applying routines of continuous change in the organization and in production. The elements recognised as important elements of an enterprise’s cultural heritage can be selected, preserved and protected through a suitable Intellectual Property management policy.  The rationale of Enterprise Cultural Heritage  A long-term commitment to the use of Enterprise Cultural Heritage can give a distinct traditional, cultural and symbolic appeal to an organisation and its products with the purpose of stimulating interest in the company and its business. A company might publish its history and vision through a web page, booklet or book aimed at its desired market segment. Communication of heritage could include the year of establishment prominently placed on the company logo, straplines etc. communicating the message of experience, longevity and reliability and the implication of quality. A company might reuse existing objects, information and procedures (e.g. recipes in the food sector) to create an artisan atmosphere (which would imply quality and distinction) for customers or encourage employee commitment to the company.

Located just above Similkameen (Coyote) Falls, the concrete arch-gravity dam stands about high, with a crest length of about , built between 1916 and 1923. The dam was named after the president of the Okanogan Valley Power Company, Eugene Enloe. The dam was operated to generate power at its powerplant, located about downstream from the dam. Lacking fish ladders, Enloe Dam blocks fish passage and completely extirpated anadromous fish migration into the upper reaches of the Similkameen River and its tributaries in Canada. https://www.columbiana.org/pages/SimilkameenRiver.html History The dam replaced a wood crib dam started in 1903 by J.M. Hagerty, a local entrepreneur, and completed a year after his death. The dam fed a generating plant in a wooden powerplant below the dam and falls. Power went to the towns of Nighthawk and Oroville, as well as the nearby Owasco, Ivanhoe, Ruby and Canba mines. Attempts by Hagerty's estate to sell the dam in 1913 met no interest, partly because of the poor state of the crib dam. Eugene Enloe of the Okanogan Valley Power Company was able to secure the rights to the site in 1916, hiring C.F. Uhden to design the dam that year. Construction did not start until 1919 and was completed in 1920 at a cost of $350,000, $150,000 of it Enloe's money. Enloe sold the dam and powerplant in 1923 to Washington Water Power Company, which added a second penstock. Description The dam features an unregulated overflow spillway whose height can be augmented by flashboards. The powerplant replaced a small run-of-river plant, which received water from a diversion channel. In 1923, the site was purchased by the Washington Water Power Company. In 1942 the WWPC was purchased by the Okanogan Public Utility District, which then ceased operations at Enloe Dam in 1958, as power was available from the Bonneville Power Administration system at less cost. The dam's reservoir extends up the Similkameen River. Largely silted up, it is just deep. Storage capacity is only . The concrete powerhouse is in a partly ruinous state, and options have been presented to stabilize or demolish the structure when the proposed new hydroelectric development is undertaken. The powerhouse was fed by two wood stave penstocks, in diameter, running to Pelton wheels driving two 1.6 megawatt generators. The generator hall stands next to a heavily built transformer vault. Redevelopment Enloe Dam Powerhouse with surge tanks on right The Okanogan Public Utility District obtained a new license for power generation from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 1983, but the license was withdrawn in 1986 because the dam's impact on anadromous fish had not been addressed. A second license for a 4.1 megawatt plant was granted in 1996, but was again rescinded on the same grounds in 2000. Yet another application was submitted in August 2008, seeking to build a new powerplant to generate 9 megawatts, fed by a new intake channel. Enloe Dam was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 18, 1978 as an example of early power development in rural Washington.

Life Timothy II Marmarinos was born in Bandırma, on the southern shore of the Sea of Marmara. On 28 February 1601, he became metropolitan of Patras, an office he maintained till he became Patriarch of Constantinople. After the deposition of Neophytus II in October 1612, the Church of Constantinople was temporally left in the care of Cyril Lucaris as locum tenens because of his position as Greek Patriarch of Alexandria. Cyril Lucaris was close to being appointed as patriarch but four bishops opposed and obtained the election of Timothy, one of their own, as Patriarch thanks to a promise to the Ottoman Sultan to increase the annual fee paid by the Patriarchate to 8000 kuruş. Thus after 21 days of interregnum Lucaris gave up and at end October or in November 1612 Timothy became the Patriarch of Constantinople. Timothy remained a fierce opponent of Lucaris, whom he forced to retire on Mount Athos. Timothy obtained an arrest warrant against Lucaris, but the latter fled back to Alexandria in Egypt. Timothy also denounced Lucaris as a Lutheran. The reason for Timothy's opposition to Lucaris did not originate with any alignment with the latter's main enemies, i.e. the Catholics, who opposed Lucaris's pro-Protestant attitude. Timothy also maintained an anti-Catholic attitude, even if in 1615 he wrote a deferential letter to Pope Paul V. In 1614, Timothy rebuilt and expanded the small Church of St. George in the Fanar, that since 1601 had become the See of the Patriarchate. Timothy II died on 3 September 1620, or in March 1621 according to other sources. At the time rumors spread that he had been poisoned at a dinner given by the Dutch ambassador, a supporter of Lucaris, but no proof exists.

Jeffrey (1992) A Dictionary of biblical tradition in English literature pp. 457–458 In these references, the term Water of Life refers to the Holy Spirit. Ὕδωρ ζωῆς is a metaphor with two meanings: literally “flowing water” as in a river, and figuratively “living water.” “Whereas ordinary water sustains life for a while (“flowing water”), the water God provides gives life forever (“living water”).James L. Resseguie, The Revelation of John: A Narrative Commentary (Grand Rapids,MI: Baker Academic, 2009), 253. The passages that comprise John 4:10–26 are sometimes referred to as the Water of Life Discourse. These references in the Gospel of John are also interpreted as the Water of Life. The term is also used when water is poured during Baptismal prayers, praying for the Holy Spirit, e.g., \\"Give it the power to become water of life\\".Baptism in the Early Church: History, Theology, and Liturgy in the First Five Centuries by Everett Ferguson 2009 p. 730Maxwell E. Johnson (2007) The rites of Christian initiation: their evolution and interpretation p. 288 The Book of Revelation Water is another name for life. Drinking it is not limited to the usefulness of water only unless it is exhausted. The reference to Water of Life in Revelation 21:6 appears in the context of New Jerusalem and states: : \\"I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely\\". Revelation 22:1 then states: \\"And he showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb\\". The Revelation reference is interpreted as the Holy Spirit.Thomas Aquinas, Daniel Keating, Matthew Levering (2010) Commentary on the Gospel of John, Chapters 1–5, Books 1–5 p. 91 The Catechism of the Catholic Church, item 1137, considers it \\"one of most beautiful symbols of the Holy Spirit\\".Vatican website: Catechism item 1137 The common theme of thirst for the Water of Life in the Book of Revelation and the Gospel of John may be summarized as follows: Paul Barnett (2002) Jesus & the Rise of Early Christianity p. 312 { style=border-collapse:collapse border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 - align=center bgcolor=#efefef !Revelation 21:6 !John 7:37 !John 4:14 - align=center ... to the thirsty I will freely give from the fountain of the water of life. ... if any man thirsts, let him come unto me and drink. ... the water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up unto eternal life. } The use of the term Water of Life in Revelation 20 is part of the \\"theme of life\\" in the book of Revelation, other instances being the Book of Life in Revelation 21:27, and the Tree of Life in 22:2, 22:14 and 22:19. John R. W. Stott relates this theme to Eternal Life in John 17:3: \\"And this is life eternal, that they should know thee the only true God, and him whom thou didst send, Jesus Christ\\".John R. W. Stott, Sandy Larsen, Dale Larsen (2008) Revelation: The Triumph of Christ p. 53 The Gospel of John Jesus with the Samaritan woman at the well, by Paolo Veronese, 1585 In the Gospel of John some references to water, as in John 4:15, are traditionally identified as the Water of Life being the Holy Spirit.Saint Augustine and Edmund Hill (2009) Homilies on the Gospel of John 1–40 (Works of Saint Augustine: A Translation for the 21st Century) p. 284 The passages that comprise John 4:10–26, and relate the episode of the Samaritan woman are sometimes referred to as the \\"Water of Life Discourse\\". The Water of Life Discourse is the second among the seven discourses in the Gospel of John that pair with the seven signs in that gospel.Ben Witherington III (2009) The Indelible Image: The Theological and Ethical World of the New Testament, Vol. 1 p. 559 Another discourse, called the Bread of Life Discourse appears in John 6:22–59.Thomas L.

The campus of the University of Santo Tomas in Manila was utilized for the camp, which housed more than 3,000 internees from January 1942 until February 1945. Conditions for the internees deteriorated during the war and by the time of the liberation of the camp by the U.S. Army many of the internees were near death from lack of food.  Background  Japan attacked the Philippines on December 8, 1941, the same day as its raid on Pearl Harbor (on the Asian side of the International Date Line). American fighter aircraft were on patrol to meet an expected attack, but a ground fog delayed the Japanese aircraft on Formosa. When the attack finally came, most of the American air force was caught on the ground, and destroyed by Japanese bombers. On the same day, the Japanese invaded several locations in northern Luzon and advanced rapidly southward toward Manila, capital and largest city of the Philippines. The U.S. army, consisting of about 20,000 Americans and 80,000 Filipinos, retreated onto the Bataan Peninsula. On December 26, 1941, Manila was declared an open city and all American military forces abandoned the city leaving civilians behind. On January 2, 1942, Japanese forces entered and occupied Manila. They ordered all Americans and British citizens to remain in their homes until they could be registered. On January 5, the Japanese published a warning in the Manila newspapers. \\"Any one who inflicts, or attempts to inflict, an injury upon Japanese soldiers or individuals shall be shot to death.\\" But if the assailant could not be found the Japanese \\"would hold ten influential persons as hostages.\\"Morton, pp.237–238 The last American forces in the Philippines surrendered on May 6, 1942, except for a few men who took to the hills to initiate guerrilla warfare against the Japanese occupiers. It was the worst defeat of the United States in World War II.Bell, Walter F. Philippines in World War Two, 1941–1945. Westport, CT: Greenwood, 1999, p. 1.  Establishment of the internment camp  Over a period of several days, the Japanese occupiers of Manila collected all enemy aliens in Manila and transported them to the University of Santo Tomas, a walled compound in size. Thousands of people, mostly Americans and British, staked out living and sleeping quarters for themselves and their families in the buildings of the University. The Japanese mostly let the foreigners fend for themselves except for appointing room monitors and ordering a 7:30 p.m. roll call every night. The Japanese selected a business executive named Earl Carroll as head of the internee government and he selected five, later nine, men he knew to serve as an executive committee.Hartendorp, A.V.H. The Japanese Occupation of the Philippines. Manila: Bookmark, 1967, pp. 10, 14 They appointed a British missionary who had lived in Japan, Ernest Stanley, as interpreter. Santo Tomas quickly became a \\"miniature city.\\" The internees created several committees to manage affairs, including a police force, set up a hospital with the abundant medical personnel available, and began providing morning and evening meals to more than 1,000 internees who did not have food or money to buy it.Pratt, Caroline Bailey, ed. Only a Matter of Days: The World War II Prison Camp Diary of Fay Cook Bailey. Bennington, VT: Merriam Press, 2006, pp. 32–33 Many of the internees built huts (shanties) at Santo Tomas to escape the overcrowded conditions in the dormitories. Thousands of Filipinos and non-interned foreigners from neutral countries gathered around the fenced compound every day and passed food, money, letters, and other goods across the fence to the internees. The Japanese put a stop to that by ordering the fence to be shielded by bamboo mats but they permitted parcels to enter the compound after being searched. However, the loose Japanese control of the camp had teeth. Two young Englishmen and an Australian who escaped from the camp were captured, beaten, tortured, and executed on February 15. Carroll, Stanley, and the monitors of the two rooms where the men had been accommodated were forced to watch.Hartendorp, p. 90 Thereafter, no escapes from Santo Tomas, which would have been relatively easy given the small size of the Japanese guard force, were recorded. Carroll and the Executive Committee reported to the Japanese commandant of the camp. In the early days of STIC, as it was called by internees, the Japanese did not provide food so it was purchased with loans from the Red Cross and donations from individuals.Hartendorp, p. 24–25 The Committee did a delicate dance with the Japanese attempting to moderate Japanese orders while following a \\"policy of close and voluntary cooperation … to secure liberties\\" and \\"to retain the greatest degree of self government possible.\\"Ward, James Mace. \\"Legitimate Collaboration: the Administration of Santo Tomas Internment Camp and its Histories, 1942–2003\\". Pacific Historical Review, Vol. 77, No 2, 2008, p. 166 The cooperation of the internees permitted the Japanese to control the camp with a minimum of resources and personnel, amounting at times to only 17 administrators and 8 guards.Ward, 192  Internees  The number of internees in February 1942 amounted to 3,200 Americans, 900 British (including Canadian, Australian, and other Commonwealth people), 40 Poles, 30 Dutch, and individuals from Spain, Mexico, Nicaragua, Cuba, Russia, Belgium, Sweden, Denmark, China, and Burma. About 100 of the total were Filipino or part-Filipino,For example, Roy Anthony Cutaran Bennett, who had an American father and a Filipina mother. principally the spouses and children of Americans. Of the Americans, 2,000 were males and 1,200 females, including 450 married couples. Children numbered 400. At least one Japanese was interned, Yurie Hori Riley, married to American Henry D. Riley, along with their children. Seventy African-Americans were among the internees as were two American Indians, a Mohawk and a Cherokee. The British were divided about equally between male and female. The imbalance in gender among the Americans was primarily due to the fact that, anticipating the war, many wives and children of American men employed in the Philippines had returned to the US before December 8, 1941.Hartendorp, 11 A few people had been sent to the Philippines from China to escape the war in that country.Van Sickle, Emily. The Iron Gates of Santo Tomas. Chicago: Academy Chicago Publishers, 1992, p. 21 Some had arrived only days before the Japanese attack. The internees were diverse: business executives, mining engineers, bankers, plantation owners, seamen, shoemakers, waiters, beachcombers, prostitutes, retired soldiers from the Spanish–American War, 40 years earlier, missionaries, and others. Some came into the camp with their pockets full of money and numerous friends on the outside; others had only the clothes on their backs.Van Sickle, p. 22 Women internees at Santo Tomas wash their hair at a communal bath. During the war, a total of about 7,000 people were resident in Santo Tomas. There was a regular flow of people in and out of the camp, as some missionaries, elderly, and sick people were initially allowed to live outside the camp and more than 2,000 were transferred to Los Baños internment camp. About 150 internees were repatriated to their home countries as part of prisoner exchange agreements between Japan and the United States and the United Kingdom. Most internees, however, served a full 37 months in captivity.Hartendorp, xiii, ff. The Japanese segregated the internees by sex. Thirty to 50 people were crowded into small classrooms in university buildings. The allotment of space for each individual was between 1.5 and 2 square metres (16 to 22 square feet). Bathrooms were scarce. Twelve hundred men living in the main building had 13 toilets and 12 showers.Hartendorp, 50 Lines were normal for toilets and meals. Internees with money were able to buy food and built huts, \\"shanties,\\" of bamboo and palm fronds in open ground where they could take refuge during the day, although the Japanese insisted that all internees sleep in their assigned rooms at night. Soon there were several hundred shanties and their owners constituted a \\"camp aristocracy.\\" The Japanese attempted to enforce a ban on sex, marriage, and displays of affection among the internees. They often complained to the Executive Committee about \\"inappropriate\\" relations between men and women in the shanties.Hartendorp, p. 359–361 Several army nurses were interned with civilians at Santo Tomas. The biggest problem for the internees was sanitation. The Sanitation and Health Committee had more than 600 internee men working for it. Their tasks included building more toilets and showers, laundry, dishwashing, and cooking facilities, disposal of garbage, and controlling the flies, mosquitoes, and rats that infested the compound.Hartendorp, p. 26–27 During the first two years of imprisonment conditions for the internees were tolerable with no serious outbreaks of disease, malnutrition, or other symptoms of poor conditions. At first, most internees believed that their imprisonment would only last a few weeks, anticipating that the United States would quickly defeat Japan. As news of the surrender of American forces at Bataan and Corregidor seeped into the camp, the internees settled in for a long stay.Van Sickle, pp 39–40  Internee government  The internees petitioned the Japanese for the right to elect their leadership and on July 27, 1942, an election was held. Earl Carroll declined to be a candidate. After the votes were counted, the Japanese exercised their prerogative by announcing that Carroll C. Grinnell, who had placed sixth in the election, was appointed as the chairman of a seven-person executive committee.Hartendorp, p. 162 Grinnell, a business executive, would be the leader of the internees for the duration of the war. Grinnell's leadership was controversial. He appeared to many of the internees to be too authoritative in ruling them and too acquiescent to the Japanese, banning community dances, building a recreational shack for the Japanese guards, and setting up an internee court and jail for offenders.Ward, 168 Dave Harvey, the most popular entertainer in the camp, satirized the Grinnell government by saying he was going to write a book titled \\"Mine Camp\\" and dedicate it to Grinnell.Ward, 174. The reference is to Adolf Hitler's book, Mein Kampf  Transfer to Los Baños  Santo Tomas became increasingly crowded as internees from outlying camps and islands were transferred into the camp. With the population in Santo Tomas approaching 5,000, the Japanese on May 9, 1943, announced that 800 men would be transferred to a new camp, Los Banos, 37 miles (68 km) distant, the then campus of the University of the Philippines College of Agriculture, now part of University of the Philippines Los Baños.McCall, James E. Santo Tomas Internment Camp: STIC in Verse and Reverse, STIC-toons and STIC-stistics. Lincoln, NE: Woodruff Printing, 1945, p. 64 On May 14, the 800 men were loaded on trains and left Santo Tomas. In succeeding months, more men and families were transferred to Los Baños including a large number of missionaries and clergymen who were previously allowed to remain outside the internment camps provided they pledged not to engage in politics. Described as a \\"delightful spot\\" on arrival, conditions at Los Baños became increasingly crowded and difficult toward the end of the war, mirroring the situation at Santo Tomas. The population of Los Baños totaled 2,132, including a three-day- old baby, when it was liberated by American soldiers and Filipino guerrillas on February 23, 1945.Cogan, Frances B. Captured: The Japanese Internment of American Civilians in the Philippines, 1941–1945. Athens, GA: U of GA Press, 2000 p. 307  Worsening conditions  As the war in the Pacific turned against Japan, living conditions in Santo Tomas became worse and Japanese rule over the internees more oppressive. Prices inflated on soap, toilet paper, and meat as the supply diminished at camp markets and stores. Those without money mostly went without food, although a fund for destitute internees was established. Meat began to disappear from the communal kitchens in August 1943 and by the end of the year there was no meat at all.Van Sickle, p.181 A blow to internee living standards was a typhoon on November 14, 1943, which dumped 69 cm (27 inches) of rain on the compound, destroying many of the shanties, flooding buildings and destroying much-needed food and other supplies. The distress caused by the typhoon, however, was soon relieved by the receipt in the camp of Red Cross food parcels just before Christmas. Every internee, including children, received a parcel weighing 48 pounds (21.8 kg) and containing luxuries such as butter, chocolate, and canned meat. Vital medicine, vitamins, surgical instruments, and soap were also received. These were the only Red Cross parcels received by the internees during the war and undoubtedly staved off malnutrition and disease, reducing the death rate in Santo Tomas. For internees (and U.S. military prisoners of war) in the Philippines this was the only aid received during the war. More parcels were not received because the Japanese linked prisoner and internee exchanges with Red Cross aid to internees. American officials such as J. Edgar Hoover of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and General Douglas MacArthur objected to proposed prisoner exchanges and the Japanese refused to allow more aid to be delivered without such exchanges.Cogan, pg. 183–185 In February 1944, the Japanese army took over direct control of the camp and dismissed the civilian administrators. Armed guards patrolled the perimeter of the camp and contacts with the outside world for supplies were terminated. The food ration the Japanese provided for internees was 1,500 calories per person per day, less than the modern-day recommendation of 2000 calories.Van Sickle, pp. 221–224 The Japanese abolished the Executive Committee and appointed Grinnell, Carroll and an Englishman, S. L. Lloyd, as \\"agents of the internees\\" and liaison officers with the Japanese. Food shortages became steadily more serious throughout 1944. After July 1944, \\"the food at the camps became extremely inadequate, weight loss, weakness, edema, paresthesia and beriberi were experienced by most adults.\\" Internees ate insects and wild plants, but the internee government declared it illegal for internees to pick weeds for personal, rather than community, use. One internee was jailed by the internee police for 15 days for harvesting pigweed. Some of the hardship could have been alleviated had the Japanese allowed the camp to accept food donations from local charities or permitted internee men working outside the camp to forage for wild plants and fruit.Cogan, p. 193–194 Gardens, both private and community, for food had been planted shortly after the internees arrived at Santo Tomas and, to combat the growing food shortages, the Japanese captors demanded that the internees grow more food for themselves, although the internees, on a 1,100 calorie per day ration by November 1944 were less capable of hard labor.Hartendorp, pg. Vol II, 401–402 In January 1945, a doctor reported that the average loss of weight among male internees had been 24 kg (53 pounds) during the three years at Santo Tomas, 32.5 percent of average body weight. (Forty percent loss of normal body weight will usually result in death.)Cogan, p. 206 That month, eight deaths among internees were attributed to malnutrition, but Japanese officials demanded that the death certificates be altered to eliminate malnutrition and starvation as causes of death. On January 30 four additional deaths occurred. That same day the Japanese confiscated much of the food left in the camp for their soldiers and the \\"cold fear of death\\" gripped the weakened internees.Hartendorp, Vol II 509–512 The Japanese were preparing for a last-ditch battle with American forces advancing on Manila. From January 1942 until March 1945, 390 total deaths from all causes in Santo Tomas were recorded, a death rate about three times that of the United States in the 1940s. People over 60 years old were the most vulnerable. They comprised 18 percent of the total population, but suffered 64 percent of deaths.McCall, pp. 66, 146  Arrival of the American Army  The photo shows hundreds of Santo Tomas camp internees in front of the UST Main Building cheering their release (taken 05 February 1945) The Santo Tomas internees began to hear news of American military action near the Philippines in August 1944. Clandestine radios in the camp enabled them to keep track of major events. On September 21 came the first American air raid in the Manila area.Pratt, 259–269 American forces invaded the Philippine Island of Leyte on October 20, 1944, and advanced on Japanese forces occupying other islands in the country. American airplanes began to bomb Manila on a daily basis. On December 23, 1944, the Japanese arrested Grinnell and three other camp leaders for unknown reasons. Speculation was that they were arrested because they were in contact with Filipino soldiers and guerrilla resistance forces and the \\"Miss U\\" spy network. On January 5, the four men were removed from the camp by Japanese military police. Their fate was unknown until February when their bodies were found. They had been executed.Hartendorp, Vol. II, pg. 561–562 The U.S. rushed to liberate the prisoner of war and internee camps in the Philippines due to a common belief that the Japanese would massacre all their prisoners, military and civilian. A small American force pushed rapidly forward and, on February 3, 1945, at 8:40 p.m., internees heard the sound of tanks, grenades, and rifle fire near the front wall of Santo Tomas. Five American tanks from the 44th Tank Battalion broke through the fence of the compound. The Japanese soldiers took refuge in the large, three-story Education Building, taking 200 internees hostage, including internee leader Earl Carroll, and interpreter Ernest Stanley. Carroll and Stanley were ordered to accompany several Japanese soldiers to a meeting with American forces to negotiate a safe passage for the Japanese out of Santo Tomas in exchange for a release of their 200 hostages. During the meeting between the Americans, Filipinos and Japanese, a Japanese officer named Abiko reached into a pouch on his back, apparently for a hand grenade, and an American soldier shot and wounded him. Abiko was especially hated by the internees. He was carried away by a mob of enraged internees, kicked and slashed with knives, and thrown out of a hospital bed onto the floor. He died a few hours later.Van Sickel, Emily The Iron Gates of Santo Tomas Chicago: Academy Chicago Publishers, 1992, pp. 314–315  Ernest Stanley  Ernest Stanley (white shirt) leads Japanese soldiers out of Santo Tomas after an agreement with the American army to allow the Japanese to depart Santo Tomas peacefully after releasing their internee hostages. In the words of an American military officer, the British missionary of the \\"Two by Twos\\" Ernest Stanley was \\"the most hated man in camp.\\" He \\"spoke Japanese fluently. Always in the company of the Japanese, he spoke to none of the prisoners during all the years of incarceration. On the eve of the liberation, he conversed and laughed with everyone, including high-ranking American Army officers. Speculation arose that he was either a spy or a member of British intelligence.\\"DioGuardi, Ralph. Roll out the Barrel … The Tanks are Coming. Bennington, VT: Merriam Press, 1988, pp. 9–10. DioGuardi called Stanley \\"Stevenson\\" but it is clear that he is referring to Ernest Stanley. Stanley became the essential mediator in the negotiations between the Japanese in the Education Building of Santo Tomas and the American forces ringing the building and compound. His negotiation efforts initially failed, and American tanks bombarded the building, first warning the hostages within to take cover. Several internees and Japanese were killed and wounded. The next day, February 4, Stanley, going back and forth between Americans and Japanese, negotiated an agreement by which the 47 Japanese soldiers in the building would release their hostages but retain their arms and be escorted by the Americans 1st Cavalry Division led by 1st Lieutenant Burt Kennedy to a location of their choosing in Manila and released.Hartendorp, pg. 524–529 Stanley led the Japanese out of the building and accompanied them to their place of release, an event recorded by a photograph that appeared in Life magazine.  After the liberation  The total number of internees liberated at Santo Tomas was 3,785, of which 2,870 were Americans and most of the remainder were British. The American force that liberated the internees at Santo Tomas was small in numbers, and the Japanese still had soldiers near the compound. Fighting went on for several days. The internees received food and medical treatment but were not allowed to leave Santo Tomas. Registration of them for return to their countries of origin began. On February 7, General Douglas MacArthur visited the compound, an event that was accompanied by Japanese shelling. That night and again on February 10, 28 people in the compound were killed in the artillery barrage, including 16 internees.Hartendorp, pp. 544–547 Male internees lost an average of 24kg (53 pounds) during the 37 months of their internment at Santo Tomas. The evacuation of the internees began on February 11. Sixty-four U.S. Army and Navy nurses interned in Santo Tomas were the first to leave that day and board airplanes for the United States. Flights and ships to the United States for most internees began on February 22.Hartendorp, Vol, II, p. 547, 560 Although food became adequate with the arrival of American soldiers, life continued to be difficult. The lingering effects of near-starvation for so many months saw 48 people die in the camp in February, the highest death total for any month. Most internees could not leave the camp because of a lack of housing in Manila. The American military pressured all American internees to return to the U.S., including long-time residents and mixed-blood families who wished to remain in the Philippines. Tensions between the remaining internees and the American military were high. Slowly, in March and April 1945 the camp emptied out, but it was not until September that Santo Tomas finally closed and the last internees boarded a ship for the US or sought out places to live in Manila, almost completely destroyed in the Battle of Manila.Hartendorp, Vol. II, pp. 613–626  Collaborators with the Japanese  American intelligence investigated and detained about 50 internees suspected of being collaborators or spies for the Japanese. Most were cleared, but a few, although repatriated, had their cases referred to the FBI.Hartendorp, Vol II, p. 624. Ernest Stanley, the interpreter, was reportedly investigated, but cleared of charges. He later went to Japan as an employee of the U.S. Army and became a Japanese citizen. He married a Japanese woman and took up residence in Tokyo and adopted a son. He lived in Tokyo the rest of his life. Earl Carroll defended himself and other camp leaders from allegations of collaboration in a series of newspaper articles in which he claimed the internees had waged a \\"secret war\\" against the Japanese. That view was generally accepted by Americans, and most internees were given a campaign ribbon for \\"contributing materially to the success of the Philippine campaign.\\" Carroll and (posthumously) Grinnell received the Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian decoration of the U.S. government.Ward, 181–183 Scholars have characterized the cooperation between the Japanese and the internees at Santo Tomas as \\"legitimate collaboration. By working with the internees, the Japanese suppressed resistance, isolated Americans from Filipinos, freed up resources, and exploited the camp for intelligence and propaganda. In return the camp obtained greater autonomy, security, and a higher standard of living.\\"Ward, p. 198 Internees * Beulah Ream Allen (along with her 2 children), medical doctor * Roy Anthony Cutaran Bennett * Henry J.

The ~22 nucleotide mature miRNA sequence is excised from the precursor hairpin by the enzyme Dicer. This sequence then associates with RISC which effects RNA interference. miR-338 is located in an intronic region within the gene for apoptosis-associated tyrosine kinase (AATK). It has been predicted that it may downregulate genes which have a downstream negative effect on AATK expression.  Function  miR-338 is a brain-specific miRNA which regulates the expression of cytochrome c oxidase IV (COX4). The mature miR-338 miRNA sequence is complementary to a short section of the 3' untranslated region of COX4 mRNA. This mRNA sequence is presented atop a stem- loop structure, indicating it is accessible to miRNA processing.  Applications  miR-338 is dysregulated in neuroblastoma, and could potentially be implemented as a biomarker or future therapeutic agent. miR-338 has also been linked with hepatocellular carcinoma, and a large-scale diagnostic test has been suggested involving measurement of miR-338 expression in tissue samples. Furthermore, miR-338 is one of seven microRNAs whose expression profiles can be combined to give a prediction of the probability of survival of a patient with gastric cancer.

He is one of the artists who consciously refused to bow down to the current trends in order to create a highly distinct, coherent piece of work. Giuffrida who comes from Catania initially worked in Rome until he relocated to Germany in the mid eighties. During the self-imposed exile in the foreign language environment, he developed his artistic vocabulary with which he formulated his own cosmos. With the Adjustable Elements, Giuffrida bypassed the boundaries of the term “sculpture” known until then. Ambiguity and variability become basic principles which constitute Giuffrida’s sculptures as well as his paintings. Biography ELEMENT LVIII-Animation, 2003 Giuffrida was born in Zafferana Etnea. His relationship to art could be described as scientific, even at a very young age: he applied himself with persistent dedication to drawing, painting and constructing. A scale model reproduction of the church in his home town became a research project lasting years. He kept destroying the work, so that he could start it immediately from scratch again taking lessons from his previous experimentation, applying even greater precision and oriented more closely to reality. The uncompromising striving for perfection, aiming at the best possible expression of his creative visions, would always stay with him in years to come as well. In his early youthful phase Giuffrida primarily approached nature and man’s creative potential in his painting, and these remained a constant reference point in his art in the years ahead. He experimented with the possibilities of painting and collage techniques. His paintings tend to feature calm, predominantly blue spaces, punctuated by white light reflexes that constantly reoccur in his later work. The blister packing he adds to the pictures evokes the image of a computer keyboard, and also looks like a picture taken from space of geographical and city structures, a bird’s eye photo of urban landscapes seen through a lunar filter. A period of intense nature studies followed these works, though he did not formulate them as naturalistic reproductions but instead took them in an abstract direction. With scientific precision, he examined plant structures in particular, dissecting organic material and making cross sections in natural tissue in order to study the essence of things and figure out the basic nature of form. Giuffrida understood the minutiae at the heart of the elements he analysed as fundamental forms of nature, which are combined in natural creation in myriad, endlessly varied formations. He reduces these basic shapes to geometric patterns which he captures in small square pictures in equally diverse variations. These mainly take the form of black-and-white dabbed paintings, some of which are on transparent paper that seems to correspond to the materiality of the diaphanous floral tissue. It is at this point that he begins to be captivated by the technical quality and effect of transparency, another guiding principle running consistently through Giuffrida’s art and his constant search for the best forms of expression for the wide range of materials suited to him. Works There was a concentrated series of works in the early 1970s influenced by Minimalism (Minimal Art). Among other things, he created transparent, folded canvases that incorporated superimposed folded shapes, form elements – cut out and therefore definitively liberated from their original context: floating particles in a solidified fluid, like scattered inlays in radiant amber. The colour only becomes apparent in the light and iridescence, further differentiated by the surface. As in other still haptic works, the first configurations are not created through construction but through attachments that allow forms to emerge through a mechanical process, almost by chance and in a semi-experimental way. Impression, abrasion, reprinting, reduction are pseudo-objective processes that resemble scientific production methods in the infusion of chance and methodology, subjectivity and objectivity. Pastel colours are dabbed on paper then gently lifted off, their image detached onto gauze impregnated with glue, the colour particles sticking to it like delicate pollen. In the milky-white of the semi-transparent base mass, the detached pigments float like preciously preserved spolia and spores, sprinkled like stars over the universe of the paper. Imperceptibly yet inexorably their blaze expands the sfumato-white background into an all-encompassing space which attains cosmic dimensions and spans light years. In 1975 he returned to non-figurative representation. This period saw him participating at the X Rome Quadriennale that year. Between 1977 and 1985 he worked as a freelance painter and set designer in Rome. At this point he began to develop a substantial body of painted work, a stringent transitional route in which the reduction of form revealed his early proximity to Minimalist Art and at the same time took on mythical, fantastic features. His pictorial language incorporates traces of Italian Futurism (Giacomo Balla, Carlo Carrà), of painters such as Lucio Fontana, Mario Nigro, Gustav Klimt, Sonia and Robert Delaunay, Pablo Picasso and Wassily Kandinsky. Added to which, it can also be traced back to Pre-Columbian Mayan art. Experience of post-Impressionism (Pointillism) combines with computer graphics techniques (raster graphics), which in turn have links to the visual effects of his current high-tech constructions (microwave towers). He moved to Cologne in 1986, deliberately setting his sights on one of the most active centres in contemporary art at that time. The colours appear in characteristic dapple style on large-format canvasses, under which shapes are silhouetted, apparently moving as if behind textured glass. The horizontally layered colours are broken up in irregular though rhythmic sequences, and in this way suggest the movement of an undetected being that is captured in a distortion akin to a wipe effect in photography. Something similar happens in the human images group of works in which figurative representation becomes an experimental sphere. The human images develop their suggestive power through serial sequencing and dynamic distortion. In their mask-like reproduction of almost identical forms, they run counter to any expression of unique personality, which differs from the classical portrait emphasizing one person‘s individuality. The human being mutates into a prototype, appearing in diverse variations within the serial arrangement and disappearing in the masses. From 1990 to 2004 he worked in his studio in Bonn. Still committed to varied sequences and rhythmic movement, Giuffrida ended up in his new group of works at the picture puzzle using abstract elements and shapes. Canvasses were now inspired by architectural and ornamental structures captured in mysterious light and shadow arrangements, in shades of grey-blue and white. With the wooden reliefs and sculptures that then followed in 1995, Giuffrida transposed the notion of picture puzzles into the third dimension. He made assemblages from dismantled individual items and furniture freed from its functional context, combining them with worked wood panels. The relief-like wooden sculptures look like magnified details of the painted puzzles. Symmetrical arrangements, repetitions and sequences crop up here as well. Following his principle of systematically carrying on the experiments he had begun with these expressive tools, Giuffrida used the static wooden reliefs to develop symmetrical yet mobile iron sculptures in similar dimensions, the so-called Elements or Adjustable Sculptures. Giuffrida linked iron strips with multiple joints together in such a way that they could pivot on the joints; the observer consciously becomes a participant in art by being encouraged to alter the sculptures. ELEMENT LVIII-Einstellung 11, 1997/98 From this point the road led to new materials and dimensions. Sculptures made of iron and Perspex represented a new group of works. Initially they were made life-size. Everyday found objects were put on Perspex plinths and became assemblages associated with new meaning. Later they took up so much room that the Perspex bases grew into navigable spaces with corridors and transparent walls, while antenna-like watchmen or signals loomed high above the viewers. Giuffrida increasingly brought his creative drive to the public space. The project The whole world as a sculpture park was conceived and presented in public for the first time in September 1997. A tower made of steel struts about 21 metres high forms the end point of a series of steel sculptures, each of which denotes one of the steps linking the graphic design and the end result of the monument. The structures of the steel sculptures are reminiscent of electricity pylons, bearers and conductors of energy that belong to the absolutely essential nature of the living world, just like art. The ultimate aim of the project is to gradually replace all pylons with new large-scale sculptures designed by artists that are both art works and functional objects. B-731 R, 1996/97 2003 saw the founding of the fictitious factory A.G. Sinnwerke®. The first products to appear under the A.G. Sinnwerke label were the CDs, CD-Sets, and Selbstbau- Sets. More concentrated object cycles followed: CD-Roms, Samples, Ovali, Kugeln, Irrigatoren, Mona Lisa, and Sample-Sets, all offered in blister packs. Adjustable, space-consuming sculptures were made in parallel, their models presented in the form of corsets. Many ideas were captured in painting. He followed the same principle when he continued the richly varied idea of the objects in painting : Irrigatoren, Irrigatoren-Sätze, CD-Homes, Figuren, Enthüllungen, Bezüge, Seitenblicke, Antennen, Töpfe, Tempel, Angebote, CD- Stapel, Kathedralen etc. Eventually the artist provided only the material, that is, the Do-it-yourself-Baukästen, allowing the buyer to come to a personal decision about what form to use for his or her individual picture.

Stage design Alongside his creative work Giuffrida has devoted himself to set design for dance theatre ever since his days in Rome. The stage images he has created are characterized by light, transparency, movement and a lightness of touch. Typical features are large- scale objects without a fixed installation, like steel struts and frames that the dancers can move around in the space: the rhythm and variation of stage set and dance are mutually complementary. This allows the creation of ever-new spatial definitions and flexible images, in which the notion of the relativity of viewer and object through the movement in space or the movement of space itself in turn becomes the theme itself. From 1995 he has been set designer for, among others, Tanzforum Köln, Euregio Tanzforum, and Jochen Ulrich. Notebook, Premiere, 2 May 1995, Oper der Stadt Köln.

As Vice President of Engineering at the Fruehauf Trailer Corporation his inventions played a major role in containerization. Working with a Fruehauf customer, Malcom McLean, they spearheaded the container ship revolution in the 1950s, Tantlinger developed much of the early technology that made modern container shipping possible while at Fruehauf. After its initial order of containers from Brown Trailer, Sea-Land switched to containers made by the Strick division of the Fruehauf Trailer Company. Fruehauf had been one of the dominant players in building truck bodies and trailers for a long time, and, as already described, had previously innovated in the design and construction of the early commercial semi-trailers. President Roy Fruehauf was impressed with the idea of containerization, so in addition to manufacturing containers for Sea-Land his company agreed to make the trailer chassis that were needed, and also to provide financing to Sea- Land for the purchase of these containers and chassis. In 1958 Tantlinger left Sea-Land and became chief engineer at Fruehauf, where he continued to work with containers. More importantly, over the years he played a key role in the process of container standardization, working extensively on a committee of the American Standards Association (ASA) and later being critically involved with the ISO's efforts.The Shipping Container and the Globalization of American Infrastructure, by Matthew W. Heins His designs included the corner casting and Twistlock systems found on every intermodal container, the spreader bar for automatic securing of containers lifted on and off ships, and the ship-shore container transfer apparatus for the first cellular container ship. In the course of his professional career, Tantlinger was granted 79 United States patents, all related to transportation equipment. Many of his patents related to commercial highway freight trailers and transit buses. Life and career Tantlinger was born in Orange, California, on March 22, 1919. He was educated the University of California, Berkeley, where he was awarded a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering. During World War II, he worked for the Douglas Aircraft Company (later McDonnell Douglas), where he designed tools used to produce the B-17 bomber. He married Marjorie Cunningham. They had a daughter, Susan Tantlinger, and they later divorced. In the 1950s, Tantlinger persuaded McLean that shipping containers should be built so they could be separated from a chassis, with strong corner posts and built so they could be stacked on top of each other. Tantlinger also worked on the basic structure and many features of the Bay Area Rapid Transit cars for San Francisco and the rapid transit cars for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transportation Authority. During his career he also worked as chief engineer and vice president of engineering at Brown Trailers in Spokane; vice president of engineering and manufacturing at Fruehauf Corporation in Detroit; and senior vice president, ground transportation systems at Rohr Industries in Chula Vista, California. On September 10, 1981, he married Wanda Mae Gunnell Delinger in Las Vegas, Nevada. In 2010, Tantlinger was awarded the Gibbs Brothers Medal by the National Academy of Sciences for his role in developing the expansion of world trade. He died in Escondido, California, on August 27, 2011, age 92. References External links * K. W. Tantlinger USPO Patent for Container Crane Apparatus * K. W.

The company, which started as a bicycle repair shop in 1922, was founded by Simeó Rabasa i Singla. History The first Rabasa bicycle shop opens to the public in 1922. Founded by Simeó Rabasa i Singla, its business activities originally consist of the sale, rental and repair of bicycles.Rabasa Derbi history, by Derbi official website. Three years later, Rabasa enters into partnership with his brother in law, Vicens Solà, and within a few years they manage to open twenty-one bicycle sales and rental branches throughout the Vallès region in Barcelona, Spain. The company introduces sale on credit without interest and promotes bicycling classes for women.El meu avi. Simeó Rabasa, bicicletes i derivats , Documentary script about Simeó Rabasa (text in Catalan). 2001, 7 october. In 1930, Rabasa and Solà separate and, one year later, Rabasa opens a new shop in the municipality of Martorelles (Barcelona). The new building allows him to manufacture fenders and specialize in the production of frames and accessories. During the Spanish Civil War, production is greatly reduced due to the difficulty of supplying the factory. Later during the war, the factory is confiscated by the Republican Government for use in the repair of military airplane engines. After the civil war, production resumes. In 1944 Simeó Rabasa i Singla creates a corporation with his brother, Josep Rabasa i Singla, called Bicicletas Rabasa. From then on, the company adds the production of motorcycle components to the existing bicycle business.Rabasa Derbi history, by Derbi official website. In 1950 Bicicletas Rabasa transforms into Nacional Motor S.A. and launches the first Derbi motorcycle (acronym comes from the expression « derived from bicycle») in the Barcelona Exhibition Fair.Rabasa Derbi history, by Derbi official website. The company is hence known as Rabasa Derbi. In 1970 the company is divided into two separate companies. Bicycle production remains under the direction of Margarita Rabasa (daughter of Simeó Rabasa i Singla) and Dante Adami, who found a new bicycle manufacturing plant in the municipality of Mollet del Vallès. The new plant occupies 26,000 square meters. They produce nearly two million bicycles until 1996, when the plant closes its doors.«Cierra bicicletas Rabasa». El País Spanish journal. 1996, 5 january.

The Festival of Trees is Canada's largest annual literary event for children, attracting over 10,000 youth every year. The winners of each program, as chosen by the young readers, are announced at the Festival of Trees events, and many authors and illustrators are in attendance, delivering hands on workshops and mingling with their young fans. In 2012, the Festival began touring and now has events in places around Ontario reaching thousands more young readers.  Program background  The main objective of the Forest of Reading program is to encourage a love of reading in people of all ages, as well as to introduce students and library patrons to the high quality Canadian books available on the market today.  History  In the early 1990s, the OLA conducted a small survey about recreational reading programs being offered by school libraries and concluded that more needed to be done to encourage reading for pleasure in school-aged children. Inspired by the huge success of the Texas Bluebonnet Awards (a reading program based out of Texas), OLA representatives decided to adapt the program for Ontario and re-stimulate school library interest in reading through the promotion of reading simply for pleasure. They were also hopeful that such a program would increase awareness for Canadian books and authors. The first Forest of Reading Awards program, the Silver Birch Awards program, was up and running by 1994. It targeted children in grades 4–6 and focused on fiction and non-fiction books. As the program gained traction, the Silver Birch Award started to attract the attention of principals and teachers who encouraged its adoption in ever-widening circles, providing teacher-librarians with much needed support. Five years later, a program for Grades 7–9 would be built in response to growing school demand (Red Maple Awards program). Today, the Forest of Reading has expanded to include eight reading programs and is the largest in the country.  Award programs  The Forest of Reading consists of eight reading programs: * Blue Spruce Award (the best picture books for children in kindergarten–grade 2, ages 4–7) * Silver Birch Awards (the best fiction and non-fiction books for children in grades 3–6, ages 8–12) * Silver Birch Express Award (the best fiction and non-fiction books for children in grades 3–4, ages 8–10. Also great for ESL students, reluctant readers and special needs students in grades 3-6) * Red Maple Award (the best fiction books for youth in grades 7–8, ages 12–14) * White Pine Awards (the best fiction and non-fiction books for high school-aged teens) * Le Prix Tamarac Awards (the best French fiction and non-fiction books [from 100 to 250 pages].) * Le Prix Peuplier (the best Short French chapter books [maximum 100 pages] or mature picture books.) * Golden Oak Award (fiction and non-fiction for adults learning to read and adult ESL students) * Evergreen Award (fiction and non- fiction for adults of any age)\\"Individual Trees\\", http://www.accessola.org/ola_prod/OLAWEB/Forest_of_Reading/About_the_Forest/Individual_Trees/OLAWEB/Forest_of_Reading/Individual_Trees.aspx?hkey=148b7727-2a75-4f45-aed8-6f5b6cee61a1  Festivals and ceremonies  The school-aged programs have one large award ceremony in the spring called the Festival of Trees, at the Harbourfront Centre, Toronto. The festival is spread out over three days and includes workshops, author signings, and the awards ceremonies themselves. Additional satellite festivals and celebrations occur in other cities throughout Ontario around this time. The Golden Oak Award is given during the Toronto Public Libraries Literacy Conference in June. Adult learners join together for a luncheon and the nominees of the Award are invited to share in this celebration. The Evergreen Award winner is announced in November and the award is presented during the OLA's Super Conference in Toronto in the winter.

It consisting of mostly granitic islands and reefs that provide breeding sites for Australian sea lions and support colonies of short-tailed shearwater. It also includes the island group known as the Isles of St Francis. All the islands with exception of a part of Evans Island, are located with the following protected areas - the Nuyts Archipelago Wilderness Protection Area and the Nuyts Archipelago Conservation Park. Description Of the roughly 30 islands and reefs in the archipelago, those lying furthest from the coast of the Eyre Peninsula are known as the Isles of St Francis, after the largest. Most of the islands are formed of calcarenite lying on granite; where the softer calcarenite is close to sea level it has been heavily eroded by wave action. The area is biologically unique in South Australia due to the influence of the Leeuwin Current, flowing eastwards across the Great Australian Bight and bringing features more typical of western than south-eastern Australia. In and around the archipelago the subtropical Leeuwin Current meets and mixes with the colder waters of the Flinders Current creating a biodiversity hotspot. Examples of the effect of the Leeuwin Current include the presence of plate corals and fish such as the Western Footballer. History The archipelago was named in 1802 by Matthew Flinders after Dutch diplomat Pieter Nuyts, who was the senior official of the Dutch East India Company on the ship 't Gulden Zeepaert (\\"The Golden Seahorse\\"), captained by François Thijssen who mapped the southern coastline of Australia from Albany to Ceduna in the course of a 1626–27 voyage from the Netherlands to Formosa and Japan. Nuyts was in the region of the archipelago in January 1627. Both Flinders and Nicolas Baudin, who also explored the area in 1802, named several of the islands. During the early 19th Century the archipelago and adjacent coast were used as a base for sealing and for whaling, usually by Hobart-based entrepreneurs who established whaling stations on St Peter Island as well as at Fowlers Bay and Streaky Bay. List of constituent islands =St Francis Island= St Francis Island was named in 1627 by Thijssen after his patron saint, at it is the second largest island in the archipelago. It is covered by a mix of grassland, saltbush and low shrubland and supports a large population of muttonbirds (estimated at 273,000 pairs). The highest point, above sea level, carries an automated lighthouse and radio beacon. It has a long history of agricultural use as well as of guano mining. =Masillon Island= Masillon Island is located about south of St Francis, it was named in 1802 in the course of Baudin’s expedition after a Bishop of Clermont, Jean Baptiste Massillon. It is vegetated with heathy shrubland and saltbush, and supports muttonbirds (39,520 pairs). =Fenelon Island= Fenelon Island is located about south of Masillon, it was named by Baudin after François Fénelon, a French archbishop and theologian. It features heathland on shallow soils and supports a large population of white-faced storm petrels (13,000 pairs), as well as a sea lion breeding colony. =Smooth Island= Smooth Island is a dome-shaped island with a covering of dense, low scrub, it lies north of St Francis. =Egg Island= Egg Island is located about north-east of St Francis, it is dome shaped with a high point 41 m above sea level. It has deep soils and muttonbirds (400 pairs). =Dog Island= Dog Island is located about east-north-east of St Francis, it has saltbush shrubland and muttonbirds (1816 pairs). =Freeling Island= Freeling Island is located about north-east of Dog Island, it was named after Major-General Sir Arthur Henry Freeling, Surveyor General of South Australia. The island first obtained protected area status as a fauna conservation reserve declared under the Crown Lands Act 1929-1966 on 16 March 1967 . It has muttonbirds (112 pairs). =West Island= West Island is located in the open ocean about west of St Francis, it features exposed granite surfaces and is used by Cape Barren geese. It supports a sea lion breeding colony. =Lacy Island= Lacy Island is located about north-east of St Francis, it was named by Flinders on 3 February 1802 after Mr Lacy, a crew member of HMS Investigator. It has low heath, shrubland, and supports muttonbirds (4740 pairs). =Hart Island= Hart Island was named after Captain John Hart, a Premier of South Australia. =Evans Island= Evans Island is located about between the two protected areas but is part of neither. It serves as a lighthouse reserve managed by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA). It features Marsh Saltbush shrubland on deep soils, and supports muttonbirds (29,472 pairs). =St Peter Island= St Peter Island (also called St Peter's Island) is located about in length and in area, is the largest and most accessible island in the archipelago, and holds the greatest number of muttonbirds (334,800 pairs). It lies only from the mainland and was farmed from 1859 until it was added to the conservation park in 1988. Since sheep grazing ceased the vegetation has become dominated by regenerating native plant communities with patches of mallee woodland. It was named in 1627 by Thijssen after Nuyts' patron saint. =Gliddon Reef= Gliddon Reef is an islet to the south-west of St Peter, it supports a sea lion breeding colony. =Purdie Islands= Purdie Islands are little more than a chain of low rocks, they were named by Flinders on 3 February 1802 after Robert Purdie, the surgeon’s assistant on the Investigator. They support a sea lion breeding colony. =Lounds Island= Lounds Island is covered by low, dense vegetation, it was named by Flinders on 7 February 1802 after midshipman Sherrard Lound. It supports a sea lion breeding colony. =Goat Island= Goat Island is a island lying 2 km south- west of St Peter Island, it supports muttonbirds (94,800 pairs). The wreck of the single-screw steamer, Eleni K (originally Johns Hopkins) lies on the north side of the island. =Breakwater Island= Breakwater Island is an islet to the south-east of Goat Island, it supports a sea lion breeding colony. =Eyre Island= Eyre Island is a sand island supporting large numbers of pied oystercatchers, it was named after explorer Edward John Eyre. The island first obtained protected area status as a fauna conservation reserve declared under the Crown Lands Act 1929-1966 on 16 March 1967 . =Franklin Islands= Franklin Islands – both East and West Franklin Islands are covered by nitre bush on deep soils, with breeding muttonbirds (102,080 pairs). They were named by Flinders on 3 February 1802 after midshipman John Franklin who was later to become well known as a polar explorer. Similar calcarenite-capped plateaus on granite platforms, the islands are joined at low tide by a strip of sand. Once part of the St Francis Island pastoral lease, they were occasionally used for grazing sheep. Public access to the Franklin Islands is prohibited in order to safeguard the relict population of stick-nest rats there. =Lilliput and Blefescu Islands= Lilliput and Blefescu Islands are small islets which were only officially named in 2007, lying off East and West Franklin respectively, they both support sea lion breeding colonies. Other animals Tiger snakes and southern carpet pythons occur in the archipelago. Greater stick-nest rats are found on the Franklin Islands. An isolated subspecies of the southern brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus nauticus) is endemic to the archipelago and confined to St Francis and the Franklin Islands. An unsuccessful attempt was made to reestablish a colony of brush-tailed bettongs on St Francis Island, where the species had previously become extinct; a similar introduction to St Peter Island has been more successful. The archipelago is important for Australian sea lions; it contains eight breeding colonies as well as several haul-out sites. southern fur seals also use haul-out sites in the archipelago, while southern right whales migrate along the coast from May to October.Department of Environment and Natural Resources (2010), Environmental, Economic and Social Values of the Nuyts Archipelago Marine Park, Department of Environment and Natural Resources, South Australia. Protected area status and other arrangements =Statutory reserves= The majority of islands within the group are within the Nuyts Archipelago Wilderness Protection Area which was proclaimed on 25 August 2011 and was excised from all of the Isles of St Francis Conservation Park and from the Nuyts Archipelago Conservation with exception to Eyre Island and St Peter Island. Evans Island which was previously unalienated Crown land has only partially included in the wilderness protection area as part of the island is held by AMSA for use as a site for a lighthouse. The waters around the archipelago and adjoining the mainland have been within the 4000 km2 Nuyts Archipelago Marine Park since 2012. =Non-statutory arrangements= Important Bird Area The archipelago, with the exception of Hart Island, has been identified by BirdLife International as a 110 km2 Important Bird Area (IBA) because it contains over 1% of the world populations of short-tailed shearwaters (with an estimated maximum of 890,740 breeding pairs), white-faced storm-petrels (22,750 breeding pairs) and pied oystercatchers (about 250 individuals). Other birds nesting in the IBA include little penguins (over 1000 pairs), Pacific gulls (about eight pairs), Caspian terns (about 250 pairs) and crested terns (at least 3000 pairs), as well as eastern reef egrets, ospreys, white-bellied sea eagles and hooded plovers. Rock parrots occur on Lounds Island and probably Smooth Island.

Thomas Overskou (11 October 1798 in Copenhagen– 7 November 1873 in Copenhagen) was a Danish actor, playwright and theater historian and a titular professor in 1852. His plays are preserved in the Dramatic Collection of the Royal Danish Library. Life Unlike his slightly younger contemporary Hans Christian Andersen, Thomas Overskou was born in what was then the societal bottom, and he had to fight a hard battle to come forth in the Danish artistic scene. He was commissioned by the theatre once he had a keen understanding of the requirements for dramatic production. He was not only successful in achieving the position of stage actor in minor roles, and later theater director, but a number of his original stage plays was performed at the Royal Danish Theatre. Capriciosa, as well as East Street and Western Street were some of his well-known solid successes in the Casino Theater in Copenhagen. Overskou's permanent profit happened as theater historian. His first five-act comedy The Danish stage in its history (1854–64) is a fundamental tool. Also his autobiography entitled Of my life and my time (1868), re-released with notes by Robert Neiiendam (1915–16), is worth reading. Here he tells, among other things, about Copenhagen bombardment of 1807 which he witnessed at first hand, in addition to the story of how he made a career in the theater. He died in Copenhagen. After his death, a road in the Åløkke Quarter, in central Odense, has been named after him.

He was a collector of rare books and coins. From his father, Henry Brevoort, he inherited about 6,000 volumes, mostly Americana, which were collected in Europe during the turbulent years from 1810 until 1832. To this library, Brevoort made large additions, until in 1875 it comprised about 10,000 volumes, many of them very rare and costly. He also collected medals and manuscripts. About 1875 he began to bestow many of his treasures upon various institutions. His collections also embraced entomology and ichthyology (books and specimens). Brevoort removed, in early life, to Yonkers, but returned to New York and was a member of the Common Council for many years. Brevoort married Elizabeth Dorothea Lefferts in 1845, and they had one child, Henry L. Brevoort (1849-1895).Brooklin Historical Society. Guide to the Brevoort Family papers. Retrieved on May 8, 2014.

The hotel opened fifteen years after the opening of the then leading luxury Kaiserhof Hotel. It also competed with the nearby Central-Hotel that opened 1881. The hotel initially had the address Unter den Linden 5–6, but after the numbering of the buildings on the street changed in 1936/37, it became Number 65.http://www.potsdamer-platz.org/bristol.htm In 1904, following the hotel's bankruptcy, the Hotelbetriebs-Aktiengesellschaft (now Kempinski) acquired the hotel. The company paid over 10 million marks for the property, it also took over the nearby Behrenstraße property for 1.2 million marks.

Family and the Seven Years' War Francis was baptised on 14 September 1729, at Buckland Monachorum, Devonshire. He was the fourth son of Sir Francis Drake, 4th Baronet, and Anne Heathcote. He was the younger brother of Sir Francis Henry Drake, 5th Baronet, the last in the line of baronets descending from Sir Francis Drake, 1st Baronet, nephew of the Elizabethan naval hero Sir Francis Drake. He served for a time as lieutenant aboard the 44-gun and the 60-gun . He was promoted to command the 10-gun sloop on 30 March 1756, during the Seven Years' War, and achieved the rank of post-captain later that year with a posting to command the 20-gun on 15 November. On 11 March 1757 he was appointed, in succession to his second brother, Francis William Drake, to the 50-gun . He commanded the Falkland for the next five years. He was present in the West Indies during the operations under Commodore John Moore between 1757 and 1758, and then went to St. Helena to escort the homeward-bound trade in the spring of 1759. He served on the south coast of Brittany that autumn with the squadron under Captain Robert Duff, and was present at the defeat of the French at the Battle of Quiberon Bay on 20 November 1759. Drake then served in the Saint Lawrence River with Commodore Swanton in the summer of 1760; with Lord Colville on the coast of North America, and with Sir James Douglas at the Leeward Islands in 1761 during the Invasion of Dominica, continuing there under Sir George Rodney in 1762 during the Invasion of Martinique, when he was moved into the 50-gun , which he commanded until the end of the war. Peace and American War of Independence Drake was appointed to command the 70-gun in 1766, and moved from there to the 74-gun HMS Torbay between 1772 and 1775. Torbay was the guardship at Plymouth during this time. With the outbreak of the American War of Independence, Drake was appointed to command the 74-gun in the spring of 1778. The Russell was one of the squadron which sailed for America under the command of Vice-Admiral John Byron. The Russell was badly damaged in a gale which scattered the squadron, and Drake was forced to return to England for repairs. He therefore did not sail to America until the spring of 1779. During that year and the early part of 1780, Drake operated as part of the fleet under the command of Vice-Admiral Mariot Arbuthnot. Drake was then sent to join Rodney in the West Indies, and accompanied him to the coast of North America, and back again to the West Indies, where he received a commission as rear-admiral, dated 26 September 1780. He then hoisted his flag in the 70-gun ; took part under Rodney in the operations against the Dutch Islands, including the Capture of Sint Eustatius, and was detached under Sir Samuel Hood to blockade Martinique, where, with his flag in , he was warmly engaged in the Battle of Fort Royal against with De Grasse on 29 April 1781. In August, with his flag again in the Princessa, he accompanied Hood to North America, and commanded the van at the Battle of the Chesapeake on 5 September, with the fleet under Sir Thomas Graves. The Princessa was heavily damaged in the battle, forcing Drake to shift his flag temporarily to the 74-gun . He afterwards returned with Hood to the West Indies, took part with him in the Battle of Saint Kitts in January 1782, and on 12 April, by the accident of position, commanded the vanguard of the fleet under Sir George Rodney in the Battle of the Saintes. He was made a baronet on 28 May 1782 for his conduct on this occasion. He continued in the West Indies until the end of the war, after which he had no further service. Later life On 12 August 1789 was appointed a junior lord of the admiralty, but died shortly afterwards, on 19 October 1789. He was twice married, first, to Elizabeth Hayman, of Kent; and, secondly, in January 1788, to Pooley, daughter of George Onslow, Esq., M.P. for Guildford, but left no issue, and the baronetcy became extinct. His elder brother, Francis William, a vice-admiral, with whom he is frequently confused, died about the same time, with descendants by his daughter but no male issue; and the eldest brother, Francis Henry, the hereditary baronet, dying also without issue this title too became extinct.

It is housed in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, Austria. The work was part of a series executed by Correggio for Federico II Gonzaga in Mantua, about the loves of Jupiter. History The series of Jupiter's Loves was conceived after the success of Venus and Cupid with a Satyr. Correggio painted four canvasses in total, although others had been programmed perhaps. In the first edition of his Lives, late Renaissance art biographer Giorgio Vasari mentions only two of the paintings, Leda (today at the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin) and one Venus (presumably the Danae currently in the Borghese Gallery of Rome), although he knew them only from descriptions provided by Giulio Romano. Vasari mentions that the commissioner, Duke Federico II Gonzaga, wanted to donate the works to emperor and King of Spain Charles V: the fact that the other two works, the Ganymede and Jupiter and Io, were in Spain during the 16th century implies that they were part of the same series. British art historian Cecil Gould suggested that Federico had commissioned the Io and Ganymede for himself, and that they were ceded to Charles V only after the duke's death in 1540, perhaps on occasion of the marriage of the king's son, Philip; others hypothesized that Federico ordered them for the Ovid room in his Palazzo Te. In 1603–1604 the painting was acquired by emperor Rudolf II together with Parmigianino's Cupid Making His Arch, and sent to Prague. The canvas was in Vienna since as early as the 1610s, when it is mentioned in the Habsburg imperial collections together with Io.

An application is the smallest unit of install, deployment, and update. Rational Requirements Composer, Rational Team Concert, and Rational Quality Manager products are groups of applications. Different license and role combinations enable varying levels of access (read only or read/write) to the capabilities within the applications. A capability, such as Change Management, is the smallest unit of function that can be enabled through licensing.  Products, applications, and capabilities  Rational Requirements Composer, Rational Team Concert and Rational Quality Manager are delivered as a set of shared applications together with a Jazz Team Server, with each application delivering capabilities for one or more products. The four applications available to be installed on a Jazz Team Server are Requirements Management (RM), Change and Configuration Management (CCM), Quality Management (QM), and Design Management (DM). DOORS Next Generation (DNG, formerly RRC) primarily makes use of the Requirements Management application and Rational Design Manager makes use of Design Management application . Rational Team Concert makes use of the Change and Configuration Management application and Rational Quality Manager makes use of all four applications. Each of the applications provides one or more capabilities. The Change and Configuration Management application delivers capabilities for Change Management (work items), Planning, Software Configuration Management, IBM Enterprise Platforms Development, and Automation/Build. The Requirements Management application delivers capabilities for capturing, managing, and tracing requirements throughout the development lifecycle. The Quality Management application delivers capabilities for test management including test planning, creation, and execution. The role-based license that an individual user holds determines the availability of capabilities and features within those capabilities to that particular user. For example, a user with a Rational Team Concert developer license can create and modify work items and plans, but can only read test plans, assuming someone else in the organization has created them by using a Rational Quality Manager license. The Jazz Reporting Service is the default reporting solution to report on data in your Jazz products. It contains a web interface for creating reports based on application lifecycle data. The Jazz Reporting Service contains several ready- to-use and ready-to-copy reports. These reports can be used to track progress of planned work across development teams with traceability across the CLM lifecycle.

It opened in October 1875. It was located next to the Reich Chancellery in what was at the time the city's \\"government quarter\\". Berlin's first \\"grand hotel\\" it was the creation of the \\"Berlin Hotel AG\\" company, founded in 1872 and subsequently renamed \\"Berliner Hotelgesellschaft\\". The commission for the building went to the architects Hude & Hennicke. A few days after the opening ceremony in October 1875 the building was destroyed by fire. It reopened in 1876. The Kaiserhof offered more than 260 rooms which were fitted out in a modern and luxurious manner. It was the first Berlin hotel in which every room had an electricity supply, its own bathroom and its own telephone. The hotel also featured steam heating, pneumatic elevators/lifts. The kitchens used gas cookers. Electric power came from Berlin's second power station, recently built in Mauerstraße by Siemens & Halske. British PM Benjamin Disraeli stayed here in 1878. Dr. Ludwig Roselius had a luxury suite in the Hotel and Barbara Goette cared for him for many months until he died there on 15/5/1943.Leidig, Ludwig. Bombshell. sbpra, 2013, On 22 November 1943 the hotel was badly damaged by British bombers during an air-raid on Berlin. The ruins ended up in East Berlin after the division of the city and were later completely torn down. The present-day Mohrenstraße station on the line of the Berlin U-Bahn was named “Kaiserhof” from its opening in 1908 until 1950. The station underwent several name changes before acquiring its current name in 1991. In 1974 the North Korean embassy to East Germany was constructed on the site. East Germany ceased to be a state in 1990 and the embassy closed. However, in 2001 its successor state, the Federal Republic of Germany, re-established diplomatic relations with North Korea and the North Korean embassy returned to the building. Since 2004, the annex on the south half of the site has been leased to Cityhostel Berlin, which pays the North Korean government an estimated €38,000 per month. In November 1939, Georg Elser's family was imprisoned in the hotel for interrogation in the objective to find out if they contributed towards the assassination attempt on Hitler's life on November 8th in the Bürgerbräukeller, Munich. Even though they were imprisoned, it was like a holiday to Berlin in the Kaiserhof.

Career =Football= Cemil Gürgen Erlertürk was born in İzmir and played six seasons as forward for Galatasaray SK. In 1931 he visited Galatasaray SK and asked to join the team. He was not selected to the team. Cemil Gürgen Erlertürk has never won the Istanbul Football League with Galatasaray, although he became top-scorer of the Istanbul Football League. In 1939-40 he scored 30 goals in 16 games. He was the first and only player to score 30+ goals.

Career summary Sherlock grew up in Thornton Heath, UK, and played the saxophone, clarinet and Flute. On hearing musicians like Andy Mackay of the 1970s band Roxy Music and Davey Payne, Ian Dury and The Blockheads Sherlock developed his own method of playing. This invariably involved experimenting with sound and processing the playing through various effects pedals. He met the vocalist Derek Morris in 1977 and together they formed Electra Vogue. Steve Parry later joined Sherlock and Morris having answered an advert placed by Morris in the NME for experimental musicians into The Velvet Underground, David Bowie. This trio of musicians formed the nucleus of what was later to become Neu Electrikk =Neu Electrikk= Neu Electrikk comprised singer songwriter Derek Morris, guitarist and electronics Steve Parry, bass player Nicholas Chamberlain Hunt, sax/flute/treatments Steve Sherlock and Barry Deller on drums/percussion. Neu Electrikk were based in London and part of the experimental, post punk music scene that included artists like This Heat, The The, Wire and Throbbing Gristle. Live concerts were erratic events, whereby three-minute songs became long passages of improvisation and noise. Neu Electrikk would often take to the stage to the voice of Frank Sinatra being accompanied by pre-recorded tapes of bird song and the sound of an industrial hammer. =The The= Sherlock became involved with Matt Johnson having been introduced by Steve Parry. Keith Laws had quit The and they comprised Matt Johnson with Simon Turner (guitar/vocals), Colin Lloyd Tucker (guitar/vocals) and Steve Sherlock (saxophone). In 1982 he contributed Flute and Saxophone to 'Three Orange Kisses From Kazan' and 'Waitin' For The Upturn', compositions for the intended debut album by The (The Pornography of Despair), but this album was never officially released. Both compositions later appeared on the b-side to the 12\\" version of 'Uncertain Smile' and were included on the cassette version of Soul Mining. Sherlock played Flute and Saxophone on the demo recording of 'Uncertain Smile'. Matt had defined most of the crisp melody lines on his original demo with Sherlock having contributed the Sax and Flute lines. However, Johnson later recorded a version of the composition in New York City with sax and flute session player Crispin Cioe. Sherlock played with The at their month-long Marquee Club residency in London. =Marc Almond= Matt Johnson recommended Sherlock to Marc Almond. Marc and the Mambas was a new wave group, formed by Marc Almond, in 1982 as an offshoot project from Soft Cell. Notably the only consistent members of Marc and the Mambas were Marc Almond, Anne Hogan and Steve James Sherlock. Almond and Sherlock, together with Annie Hogan recorded as Marc and the Mambas. His inventive playing featured prominently on 'Torment and Toreros'. Sherlock notably sharing writing credits with Almond for the track Narcissus for the album. Marc and the Mambas could be considered the blueprint for Marc Almond's solo career. Torment and Toreros being an eclectic blend of Vaudeville, French chanson, goth sensibility, guitar noise, saxophones/flutes, piano and string sections. Marc Almond became mentally ill during the course of making the album and he later noted ironically that the Torment and Toreros album was a nervous breakdown put to music.'Torment and Toreros' reached No. 28 in the UK album charts in August 1983.Official Charts Marc Almond (Marc and the Mambas) Torment and Toreros Shortly after completing the album Almond disbanded the band. Antony Hegarty of Antony and the Johnsons has referred to Marc and the Mambas being his favourite band all through his teens, becoming the starting point for Antony and the Johnsons and the album 'Torment and Toreros' being probably the definitive record of his adolescence. 2012 – Steve James Sherlock featured on Marc and the Mambas limited edition CD/DVD set Three Black Nights of Little Black Bites – Live at the Duke of York's Theatre, 1983. The concert DVD was filmed by Peter \\"Sleazy\\" Christopherson from the industrial, avant- garde visual art group Throbbing Gristle. Other Recordings Sherlock worked on various sessions with Keith Laws The The (unreleased). Recorded with Matt Johnson/Colin Lloyd Tucker/ Simon Fisher Turner contributing to the Deux Filles – 'Silence and Wisdom' LP. Sherlock contributed flute to the track 'The Hungry Years by Marc Almond and Andi Sexgang included on the 1983 compilation album 'The Whip'.

GM used its Hanoi plant to assemble Chevrolets with parts imported from South Korea - a country where the U.S. automaker came close to bankruptcy as it struggled to turn around its debt-laden unit. GM Korea is GM's biggest production base in Asia excluding China. The plant will be used solely to produce VinFast cars after the transfer, while Chevrolet cars will be imported. VinFast will assume ownership of the GM Hanoi factory, and will implement a significant investment program to build an all-new, global small car licensed from GM and manufactured and sold under the VinFast brand. Production of this vehicle will begin in 2019, greatly increasing capacity and output at the Hanoi plant and growing the manufacturing base of the dynamic VinFast operation.

It is housed in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, Austria. History The work appears in the inventory of Francesco Baiardo in Parma, who was a friend and patron of Parmigianino. Late Renaissance art biographer Giorgio Vasari writes that Baiardo had commissioned the Cupido che fabbrica di sua mano un arco. The painting was inherited by Marcantonio Cavalca and later went to Antonio Pérez, secretary of state of Philip II of Spain, who brought it with him to Spain. In 1579 Pérez fell in disgrace, and was forced to sell the painting to an envoy of emperor Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor. It was however blocked by the Spanish crown, and could be acquired and arrive to Prague, together with Correggio's Jupiter and Io and Ganymede Abducted by the Eagle, in 1603. It was transferred to Vienna's Schatzkammer in 1631. A preparatory drawing for Cupid's head is in the Cabinet des Dessins of the Louvre (n. 1662). The work was frequently copied and used as a model by numerous artists. There are copies by Joseph Heintz the Elder and Rubens in the Alte Pinakothek of Munich.

A new feature was a wrap-around front grill of horizontal bars: the new grill, regarded by some commentators as a move towards a more vulgar \\"look\\" would become a general feature across the Renault range during 1939. Prices through in 1938Perhaps surprisingly, there was no price increase announced at the motor show in October 1938. ranged from 84,000 francs for the large steel saloon with its 3210 mm wheelbase to 102,000 Francs for the longer 3720 mm wheelbase eight-seater limousine version. This placed the Suprastella towards the higher end of the price bracket occupied, with their \\"standard\\" coachbuilt bodies, by luxury automakers such as Delage and Delahaye, although with all these cars, any buyers happy to specify car bodies independently from specialist coachbuilders could easily spend considerably more. It was intended primarily as a large limousine, although cabriolet and coupe versions were also listed.Odin, L.C. World in Motion 1939 - The whole of the year's automobile production. Belvedere Publishing, 2015. ASIN: B00ZLN91ZG. In practice the intention will have been to produce the car in “bare-chassis” form for dedicated coachbuilders to fit their own bespoke bodies: typically the car was 5600 mm long. The car was intended to demonstrate that France could still build high-end luxury cars, but because of the way history turned out the Suprastella was the last of this line, and Renault would emerge from the Second World War as a state-owned manufacturer only of small cars. The Suprastella was powered by a traditional 8-cylinder in-line engine of 5448cc which had already appeared, towards the end of its production run, in the Nervastella. Maximum power was listed at at 2,800 rpm, and claimed top speed was between 135 km/h (84 mph) and 145 km/h (90 mph), according to the chassis length and body type specified. A massive 6500 mm long version of the Suprastella, using the longer 3720 mm wheelbase, became one of the most photographed cars in France during the 1940s. This was a cabriolet-bodied limousine with coachwork by Franay, delivered to the government in 1943 after it was decided that Marshal Pétain needed a new state car. The car had high ground clearance, and one unusual feature was the step beneath each door that folded out automatically when the door was opened. Although the car performed its function for Pétain, and in April 1944 was photographed containing him on his first visit as leader to Paris, the better-known images of the state Suprastella date from August 1945 when General de Gaulle, having succeeded in entering Paris ahead of the American army, toured the city, standing straight in the rear part of the car, accompanied by the war hero General Lattre de Tassigny. The car survived to serve the Fourth Republic, taken into government service by President Auriol.

Her work often draws on inspiration from her love of Italy, Modernism, and European Art Deco styles. Considered a leader in the postmodern return to historical styles in book jacket design, Fili explores historic typography combined with modern colors and compositions. Beginning her career in the publishing industry, she became known for her strong typographic approach, designing nearly 2,000 book jackets during her time with Random House. Since opening her own design studio, her work specializes in restaurant identity, food-related logos, and packaging.  Early life  The daughter of Italian schoolteachers, Fili said she was “interested in design before [she] even knew what it was.” As a child she carved letterforms into her walls, designed book covers, and created illuminated manuscripts of Bob Dylan lyrics. A visit to her parents homeland in her teens inspired a life-long love of Italy. When she was 16, Fili taught herself calligraphy using a Speedball guide and an Osmiroid pen. She attended Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, New York to study studio art. Education In 1973 Fili received a Bachelor of Science in studio art from Skidmore College, where she discovered her love for graphic design. Her senior project was an Italian hand-lettered cookbook. Fili moved to New York City in 1973, interning at the Museum of Modern Art and finishing the last semester of her degree at the School of Visual Arts. Career After graduating, Fili began her career as a freelance designer on special project books at Alfred A. Knopf from 1975-76. At 25, she was hired as a senior designer for Herb Lubalin, where she remained from 1976–78. She found type to be an expressive tool, which set the foundation for her later work. In 1978, she joined Random House as the art director at Pantheon Books, where she eschewed standard fonts in favor of creating unique typographic treatments for each book jacket. Her flexible approach extended to the physical surface treatment as well; Fili rejected the standard shiny finishes and foil-stamping on book jackets in favor of matte, laminated coatings which proved softer and more durable. \\"I was on a mission to prove that you didn’t have to shout to capture someone’s attention. The cover that I did for The Lover, by Marguerite Duras, was probably the best example of that.\\" The success of her jacket for Marguerite Duras's bestseller, The Lover, in 1984 allowed her increased creative freedom at Pantheon. Fili designed close to 2000 books during her tenure at the publisher. In 1989, she opened her own studio, Louise Fili Ltd, specializing in the design of restaurant identity, food-related logos, and packaging. “There were a few things I did know when I started my business. I knew I wanted to stay small and I always have. I also wanted to focus on the only three things that interest me: food, type, and all things Italian.” Fili said. She sought to \\"change the accepted formulas of food packaging\\" by pursuing designs that were quiet and subtle, believing that \\"one does not have to shout to be noticed.\\" During that time, there were few female-run companies, so she knew naming the company after herself could be a liability. She embraced this by sending the message: \\"If you have a problem with my being female, then I don’t want you as a client.” She has designed identities for many New York City eateries such as Pearl Oyster Bar, Picholine, Artisanal, The Mermaid Inn, and Via Carota, and has created packaging for Sarabeth's, Tate's, and Bella Cucina. Her geometric, often Cubist-like designs show an affinity to European Modernism, particularly the work of Lucian Bernhard, A.M. Cassandre, Jean Carlu, and Italian posters of the 1930s. In 2014 Princeton Architectural Press published Grafica della Strada, a compilation of her Italian sign photographs. This was followed in 2015 by Graphique de la Rue: The Signs of Paris. Fili has authored and co-authored over twenty books, many of them with her husband, the design historian Steven Heller. A monograph of her work, Elegantissima, was published in 2012. In 2009, she redesigned the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval for its 100th anniversary. In 2000, she received three James Beard Award nominations, and since 1998 she is an elected member of the Alliance Graphique Internationale. In 2004, Fili was inducted into the Art Directors Club Hall of Fame. In 2015 she received the medal of lifetime achievement from the Type Directors Club. For over twenty years, Fili has taught at School of Visual Arts, in both the undergraduate and graduate programs as well as the SVA Masters Workshop in Rome every summer. She has also taught at the New School, New York University and Cooper Union.

It is housed in the Statens Museum for Kunst, Copenhagen, Denmark. History The painting is mentioned by late Renaissance art biographer Giorgio Vasari as among those that Parmigianino executed during his sojourn in Rome. Lorenzo Cybo was a captain of the papal guards and a brother of cardinal Innocenzo Cybo, and at the time was 23/24, as specified in an inscription in the lower part of the painting: \\"Laurentius Cybo Marchio Massa atque Comes Ferentilli anno M.D.XXIII\\". The date 1523 is generally considered to be a mistake of the unknown man who added the inscription, since at the time Parmigianino was still in Emilia. The portrait is known since 1749, when it was part of the collections of cardinal Silvio Valenti Gonzaga, and is in fact included in a painting depicting his pictures by Giovanni Paolo Pannini. The whole collection was sold at Amsterdam in 1763 and in that occasion it was transferred to Denmark.

Life He was the youngest child of Frederick III, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg and his wife Princess Luise Dorothea of Saxe-Meiningen. Their mother made sure both August and his brother Ernest received a good education in literature, science and cameralism. He and Ernest also travelled to the Netherlands and England between 1768 and 1769. August's parents had planned a military career for him, but he gave this up in 1769, handing over his Gotha infantry regiment in 's-Hertogenbosch to his nephew Frederick. August then took a Grand Tour to Italy from 1771 to 1777 and got to know Voltaire in Geneva. In 1777 he was also in London as one of three godparents to Princess Sophia of the United Kingdom, his first cousin once-removed (Sophia's father's mother Augusta was August's father's younger sister). Considered to be an enlightened, open- minded and progressive prince, he gathered a witty circle around him at his palace in Gotha from 1778 onwards. He was also considered as one of the most important translator of French literature into Weimar Classicism. Dagmar Ottmann, Markus Symmank: Poesie als Auftrag S. 48 He also had a lively correspondence with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Johann Gottfried Herder and Christoph Martin Wieland, being considered a particular supporter of Wieland, to whose Oberon he was especially devoted.

It is located near Lemur Island in the National Zoological Park (the National Zoo) in Northwest Washington, D.C. The statue is named after a dinosaur in the children's book The Enormous Egg (1956), by Oliver Butterworth, and a film adaptation televised on the NBC Children's Theatre in which the statue appeared.(1) (2) (3) (4) The book and the film, which aired on April 18, 1968, tell the story of a boy who finds an enormous egg laid by a hen that hatches a baby triceratops. The triceratops, named Uncle Beazley, becomes too big, so the boy brings him to the Smithsonian Institution. Beazley is first kept at National Museum of Natural History, but is eventually transferred to the National Zoo's Elephant House because there is a law against stabling large animals in the District of Columbia. The statue is one of nine dinosaurs of different species that Jonas designed and constructed for the Sinclair Oil Corporation's pavilion at the 1964 New York World's Fair in consultation with paleontologists Barnum Brown and Edwin H. Colbert of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City and John Ostrom of the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University. After the Fair closed, the statue was featured in Sinclair's traveling Dinoland display.(1) (2) (3) (4) Uncle Beazley and S. Dillon Ripley at the opening of the Anacostia Neighborhood Museum on September 15, 1967 In 1967, Sinclair donated the nine dinosaurs to various American museums and the Smithsonian. The Smithsonian's Uncle Beazley was initially displayed at the Zoo. In July 1967, a crew from NBC-TV visited the Zoo to film the statue during the production of The Enormous Egg. After the filming ended, Sinclair donated the statue to the Smithsonian. Uncle Beazley was present at the Smithsonian's Anacostia Neighborhood Museum when the museum opened on September 15, 1967. Uncle Beazley on the National Mall between 1980 and 1994 From the 1970s to 1994, the statue was located at the National Mall in front of the National Museum of Natural History.(1) (2) (3) In 1994, the statue was returned to the Zoo and was displayed in the former rhinoceros yard until 2003, when the yard was renovated for the Zoo's expanding Asian elephant family. In 2007, the Zoo and Smithsonian exhibits staff began work to restore the dinosaur. Zoo staff also created a garden exhibit for Uncle Beazley near Lemur Island with funding from a gift from a Director's Circle donor in memory of her parents. The \\"dinosaur garden\\" features plants such as ferns, papyrus, and giant taro whose ancestors existed during the age of the dinosaurs. The statue was again refurbished in 2011.(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) NBC's telecast of The Enormous Egg also featured five smaller triceratops models that Louis Paul Jonas had created to represent the dinosaur during its youth.(1) (2) In 1979, George Heinemann, the telecast's producer, donated the models to Pittsfield's Berkshire Museum, a Smithsonian Affiliate organization in Western Massachusetts. In 2014, the five models, the largest of which bears the name of Uncle Beazley, were moved to Pittsfield's public library, the Berkshire Athenaeum.

Background According to the club of Galatasaray, they started the match with only six players since their players could not cross the Bosphorus by ferry due to a heavy storm. Emin Bülent Serdaroğlu could join the team after the match started. Galatasaray played with seven players ten minutes into the game.

After the injury of Fenerbahçe's goalkeeper, the remaining players replaced each other to keep the goal post.http://www.bolgegazetesivan.com/yazar-7_kisi_ile_70_kazanilan_mac-243.html Club of Fenerbahçe claims that both teams finished the match with 10 men, but have no evidence and are unable to say who Galatasaray's three other players are. Since there is no coverage by neutral third-party sources about this match at all, any information about this game comes from the club of Galatasaray itself. On 12 February 1911, Galatasaray achieved the team's highest Intercontinental Derby win beating Fenerbahçe 7–0. According to Galatasaray, four goals were scored by Celal İbrahim, two by Emin Bülent Serdaroğlu and one goal was scored by Idris. It is the highest goal difference in a football match between the two teams to date. İdris, one of the goal scorers, was killed in the Tripolitanian War in October 1911.

It has news of a series of houses (the Blackberry, can strip, the Adroit ca ...) to prove a major expansion of agriculture in medieval times. The two parishes also formed a royal bailiwick domain that was for almost all medieval and modern. Viladasens has always been a rural municipality: the 18th century experienced some growth, from 250 inhabitants in 1718 to 404 in 1787, which remained without much change until the mid-20th century. Since then, profound changes in agriculture led to the abandonment of the activity of many houses and the population fell by half: 357 residents in 1960 came under the 189 in 1981.

It is housed in the National Museum of Capodimonte, Naples, Italy. History Parmigianino worked for a short period at the Sanvitale family court in their \\"Rocca\\" (palace-fortress) at Fontanellato (in what is now the province of Parma). The work, dated 1524 on the rear, was executed during his stay there, before he moved to Rome the following year. He also executed the Stufetta of Diana and Actaeon and a cycle of frescoes in the private room of Paola Gonzaga, wife of Gian Galeazzo Sanvitale. The work was part of the Farnese collections in 1587, when it is mentioned for the first time in an inventory. The work had been perhaps acquired by duke Ottavio Farnese in 1561 when he acquired from bishop Eucherio Sanvitale the casino (mansion) of Codiponte, in the Ducal Park of Parma. Eucherio was the son of Gian Galeazzo Sanvitale, and had inherited the family's possessions in 1550. The portrait, together with the whole Farnese collection, left Parma for Naples in 1784. The French removed it in 1799, and it was later at Palermo until 1816, before returning to Naples. During the various changes of hands the painting lost its original identification, and was considered a portrait of Christopher Columbus (likely due to the presence, in the hat, of a representation of the Pillars of Hercules) from Raphael's school. A descendant of Galeazzo Sanvitale, Luigi, recognized his ancestor based on some documents, in 1857. The re-attribution to Parmigianino occurred in 1894. There are some preparatory drawings at the Cabinet des Dessins of the Louvre (6472 recto and verso) and in the Tobley Collection. Description The work is a \\"parade portrait\\", destined to enhance the count's image in front of his guests, and not a private depiction: this is visible in the rich display of objects showing his interests and his refined costumes. Foreground details. The count, then 28, is portrayed on a \\"Savonarola\\" chair from three-quarters but with the face looking towards the viewer. He wears a wide black jacket, according to the contemporary alla Francese (\\"French-style\\") fashion, under which two red sleeves and the white shirt (with embroideries at the wrist) are visible. The elegant beret is in the same scarlet as the sleeves, and sports gilt pearls, a plum and a decorative cameo. The French style of the clothes is an allusion to the political allegiance of the Sanvitale at the time. The left hand lies on the chair's armrest: it has a golden ring with a stone at the little finger, and holds a glove, near the sword's hilt. The other hand is wearing a glove, and shows a bronze medal with two symbols. These symbols have been interpreted as a \\"C\\" and an \\"F\\", hinting to title of Comes Fontanellati (\\"Count of Fontanellato\\"), or as a \\"72\\" (based on earlier inventories). The meaning of the number is subject to several speculations. It has been connected to alchemy, an allusion to the Moon and Jupiter or to the conjunction of the Sun and Moon, referring in turn to the marriage of Galeazzo and his wife Paola Gonzaga. There is no historical record that Sanvitale practiced alchemy: although Parmigiano likely did, art historians have found no reason he should insert coded elements into a portrait. On a table behind Sanvitale are pieces of shining armor and a flanged mace, symbols of his military role as condottiero. Behind a wall, on the right, is a landscape with a tree.

River Fields is the ninth oldest conservation organization in the United States.River Fields: History River Fields currently owns land or holds conservation easements on 33 properties, totaling more than 2,200 acres. River Fields is one of the nation's few land trusts tackling regional advocacy work as well as land conservation. History In 1959, land conservation and environmental advocacy were not yet priorities for the average citizen. Fifty years ago, the late Archibald Cochran and Mrs. W.L. Lyons Brownhttp://www.ket.org/kentucky/sallybrown/bio.htm invited a group of like- minded citizens, who shared a common interest in preserving the integrity of the Ohio River and its corridor, to form the Louisville Area River Foundation, Inc. In 1969, this group was renamed River Fields, Inc. Mission and vision =Mission= River Fields' mission is to protect, preserve, and enhance natural and cultural resources on both sides of the Ohio River between Westport and West Point, KY, and the region, for the benefit of the public. =Vision= River Fields envisions that the natural and cultural environment of the Ohio River, and its corridor, is revered and enjoyed by the citizens of the region. Land conservation Since its inception, River Fields has worked successfully with landowners and supporters to preserve thousands of acres of beautiful open space, farms, woodlands and wetlands along the Ohio River Corridor and watershed.http://tclf.org/sites/default/files/microsites/LandscapeILove/ohio- river-corridor.html Currently, it owns 10 river corridor properties, totaling about 62 acres. These properties are critical to protect the region's natural, cultural and historic landscape. Our largest property, Garvin Brown Preserve, is open to the public year-round. In addition, through conservation easements, River Fields holds development rights to 23 additional properties in metro Louisville and surrounding counties. These easements protect nearly 2,130 acres of land, including sensitive wetlands and watersheds, beautiful scenic vistas and historic properties, as well as wildlife habitats and working farms.http://findalandtrust.org/land_trusts/1466 =Garvin Brown Preserve= Garvin Brown Preserve, a 46-acre nature preserve that is owned and preserved by River Fields in Prospect, Kentucky, is open to the public year-round from dawn until dusk daily.River Fields: Garvin Brown Preserve Advocacy Since River Fields' founding, it has advocated for the protection of land and water resources in balance with responsible growth in the region. River Fields seeks solutions that promote responsible growth, including planned development, growth management, greater public access, environmental and historic preservation, enhancement of scenic views, urban design, and transportation reform. =Bridges Project and settlement agreement= The Ohio River Bridges Project is the largest capital project ever undertaken in the Commonwealth of Kentucky and one of the largest transportation projects in the nation.http://kyinbridges.com/ River Fields has monitored the project for more than two decades. Based on the facts and the law, as well as tax-supported government studies, River Fields favored building a downtown bridge and fixing Spaghetti Junction, the only way to fix cross-river mobility issues. The proposed eastern bridge, on the other hand, offered no significant traffic or safety benefits and will cause significant environmental harms. The Natural Resources Defense Council has called it \\"one of the most environmentally destructive\\" highway projects in the United States. In 2009, The National Trust for Historic Preservation and River Fields filed a lawsuit arguing that project leaders had not followed federal law. The suit was settled in January 2013.http://www.kyinbridges.com/pdfs/Settlement_Agreement_1-4-13.pdf As a result of the suit, which transportation agency officials concede never slowed construction, there was: * Confirmation that the two bridges would be built simultaneously, a major victory for those who feared that only the eastern crossing would be built, while the urgent safety and congestion problems downtown would languish or not be built at all. * Funding for historic preservation projects on both sides of the Ohio River. * Increased public involvement in the ongoing process of building the spans, as well as further safeguards against damage during the construction process for the area's natural, cultural, and historic resources.http://www.kyinbridges.com/project/documents.aspx River Fields has developed collaborative relationships with government agencies at the local, state and national levels. River Fields works closely with key agencies such as Louisville Metro Planning and Design Services, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet, and the State Historic Preservation Offices of Kentucky and Indiana, as well as a number of other organizations throughout the Ohio River Corridor. =Controversy= River Fields is notorious for being against an East End Bridge crossing the Ohio River from Louisville to Utica, Indiana. Widely blamed for the traffic snarl that ensued when the Sherman Minton Bridge was closed in September 2011, their spokesman Lee Cory denied any culpability on River Fields part, but continued to insist that only a new downtown bridge is needed, and that blame should go to those who want an East End Bridge first. In 2009, River Fields threatened to sue Louisville Eccentric Observer for publishing a story concerning how River Fields went from \\"a nationally renowned conservation group to a one-issue monolith\\". It was suggested by some that River Fields stole LEOs from their distribution boxes so that people would not read that story. Education One of River Fields' key goals is to educate the public on the importance and need of conservation easements and on issues that affect the river corridor. To accomplish this, they inform and work closely with local citizen's organizations, decision makers, and the news media. River Fields keeps area residents informed about critical topics that impact the river and region.

She was the wife of Jacob George Strutt and mother of Arthur John Strutt, and an acquaintance and critic of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, whom she describes as having written \\"two of the most absurd and the most unpleasing sonnets in the English language\\". In the 1820s and 1830s she travelled in France and Switzerland, living for a time at Lausanne, and later with her husband and son moved to Rome.  Life  The dates of birth and death of Elizabeth Strutt are uncertain. It is likely that she was the Elizabeth Frost christened at Hull, now in the East Riding of Yorkshire, on 20 February 1783. She was the sister of Charles Frost, Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, of Hull, and daughter of Thomas Frost, solicitor, of Hull. She was awarded a Civil List pension on 18 June 1863, and so can not have died before that date. Lewis gives 1782 for her birth and 1867 for her death. Her first three novels, Anti-Delphine (1806), Drelincourt and Rodalvi (1807) and The Borderers (1812) were published under the name \\"Mrs. Byron\\". At the time of publication of Genevieve, or the Orphan's Visit in 1818 she was \\"Mrs. Strutt\\".

A smoke canopy is a device hung over a fire to gather the smokehttp://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/forb/geutri/all.html and vent it through a wall or roof. Fireplaces were not used during much of the Middle Ages, because there were no chimneys, which were not invented and popularized until the 12th century. Most fires for heating were placed on hearths in the middles of rooms, and the smoke was allowed to rise to vents in the roof or high in walls. Smoke canopies provided an alternative, gathering the smoke above a fire and venting, usually through a wall clearing the living area from harmful chemicals. Most of the pictures we have of medieval smoke canopies show them being used in kitchens. They usually appeared over hearths that were placed against stone walls. Some were over free standing hearths, but this required special venting of the smoke. Fire canopies are used to this day, especially in summer houses and mountain lodges as an alternative to expensive fireplace.

ISR includes more than 250 scientists from many academic disciplines – including political science, psychology, sociology, economics, demography, history, anthropology, and statistics. It has been said to be \\"the premier center for survey research methodology in the world.\\"  History  In 1946, the sociologist and economist Rensis Likert and six colleagues from his wartime work at the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, including Angus Campbell, Leslie Kish, and George Katona, formed the Survey Research Center (SRC) at the University of Michigan in order to apply the social survey techniques they had developed to broader issues facing post-war America. That year, using techniques developed by Katona, the center began conducting surveys to compute the Consumer Sentiment Index that is one of the eleven components the Department of Commerce includes in its Index of Leading Environmental Indicators. The center gained visibility in its field due to a survey conducted in October 1948, when Campbell and Robert L. Kahn added two questions about political leanings to a survey they were conducting for the State Department about foreign policy. Their results, compiled just before the presidential election in November, showed a large number of undecided voters and a small lead for Harry Truman over Thomas Dewey, at odds with most other polls that predicted a landslide for Dewey. When Truman ended up winning the election, the subsequent examination of polling techniques led to the probability sampling utilized by the SRC becoming dominant in the field over the quota sampling that had been favored by other polling outfits. This survey was the first of what became the American National Election Studies (or NES). Psychologist Kurt Lewin had founded the Research Center for Group Dynamics at MIT in 1945, and after his death in 1947 the center's ensuing funding problems prompted its remaining members to find it a new home. The presence of the SRC and the university's support for social sciences led them to move to the University of Michigan Cartwright wrote that one of the most important reasons was \\"the strong emphasis placed upon social science and especially upon social psychology... The Survey Research Center brought to the campus a large group of social psychologists working on many research problems closely bordering upon the work of the Center... There can be no doubt that Ann Arbor in the coming years will be the scene of some of the most important developments in social science.\\" in 1948 under a new director, Dorwin Cartwright. The two groups united to form the Institute for Social Research on February 1, 1949. In 1962, Warren Miller, a political scientist, created the Inter-university Consortium for Political Research (now known as ICPSR) to help fund the maintenance and dissemination of the large data sets that the election studies and others were generating. Making such data sets available to all interested researchers was considered revolutionary at a time when the norm was for researchers to closely guard their data. The SRC's Political Behavior Program, which had taken over direction of the election studies, became the Center for Political Studies in 1970. The Population Studies Center moved from the university's College of Literature, Science, and the Arts in 1998, bringing the total number of centers to five.  Organization  The institute is an independent unit of the university, headed by a director who reports directly to the university's provost and executive vice president for academic affairs. It comprises five separate but interdependent centers: * Center for Political Studies (CPS): An interdisciplinary and collaborative social science research unit of international scope, this center analyzes individual political behavior and the role of institutions in contemporary society. * Inter- university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR): The world's largest digital social science data archive, this unit has nearly 700 member organizations from around the globe. * Population Studies Center: One of the oldest population centers in the United States, the PSC works on domestic and international demographic and population research. * Research Center for Group Dynamics: The RCGD's research programs range from achievement, aggression, and culture and cognition to evolution and human adaptation. * Survey Research Center: The SRC does interdisciplinary social science research involving the collection and analysis of data from scientific sample surveys.

In his lifetime he held the courtesy title of Margrave of Brandenburg. His elder brother Philip William held the town and lands of Schwedt.  Life  Albert Frederick was born in Berlin, a son of Elector Frederick William of Brandenburg and his second wife Sophia Dorothea. His brother Philip William was from 1692 to 1711 Governor of Magdeburg.

The ~22 nucleotide mature miRNA sequence is excised from the precursor hairpin by the enzyme Dicer. This sequence then associates with RISC which effects RNA interference. miR-146 is primarily involved in the regulation of inflammation and other process that function in the innate immune system. Loss of functional miR-146 (and mir-145) could predispose an individual to suffer from chromosome 5q deletion syndrome. miR-146 has also been reported to be highly upregulated in osteoarthritis cartilage, and could be involved in its pathogenesis. mir-146 expression is associated with survival in triple negative breast cancer.  Function  miR-146 is thought to be a mediator of inflammation along with another microRNA, mir-155. The expression of miR-146 is upregulated by inflammatory factors such as interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. miR-146 dysregulates a number of targets which are mostly involved in toll-like receptor pathways that bring about a cytokine response as part of the innate immune system. miR-146 operates in a feedback system or \\"negative regulatory loop\\" to finely tune inflammatory responses. Applications miR-146 could be used as a biomarker for sepsis. In addition it was found to be absent from the exosomes of prion infected cells suggesting it could be used as a biomarker for prion infection. miR-146a could be targeted therapeutically as its depletion has implication in the hyperactive response to infection.

They briefly reformed in late 2008 - playing a short series of live concerts, and self-releasing an incomplete CD retrospective at the same time. History In 1978 the band formed under the name 4th Reich, and made their live debut at The Marquee in January 1979. Within weeks they renamed themselves Lost Property, and supported the U.K. Subs on the Stranglehold tour. They appeared in the UK Subs film Punk Can Take It, and recorded with guitarist Nicky Garrett. The band lineup was Nick Medlin (bass), Benny Di Massa (drums), Mark Chapman (guitar) and Nina Spencer (vocals).Manufactured Romance (Kris Needs, ZigZag November 1981, p16) In 1980 they become a five piece with Canadian Bob Moore on lead guitar, and changed their name to Manufactured Romance. After some touring the band signed to Fresh Records, and released a well-received single \\"Time of My Life\\"/\\"Room To Breathe\\". \\"Time of My Life\\" was included in the label compilation Fresh Collection, and Manufactured Romance headlined the Fresh Festival at the London's Music Machine.

These inventions were created mainly during the age of Portuguese Discoveries, but as well, during modernity. Relying on trade secret explains, in part, the difficulty often experienced by researchers in documenting Portuguese inventions, as many are not described in patent documents, or other technical documents. On the other hand, there are cases, like some types of swords, where the inventions themselves or the underlying documents were lost, having been destroyed, for example, during the French invasions. There are as well documentation and objects of Portuguese origin in private collections or museums outside of Portugal.  Discoveries  The creation of new inventions in Portugal took its peak during the Age of Discovery. These inventions consisted mainly in the improvement of devices and techniques of ocean navigation and coastal cartography, such as the mariner's astrolabe and the chart of latitudes. On the field of military applications, the construction of cannons and new types of swords, like the carracks black sword.  Modernity  More recently, the technical domain varies from computers to medicine. Such examples might be Via Verde, an automatic system for collecting tolls for vehicles, the Multibanco, an automatic teller machine network with a multitude of functions ranging from bank transfers to the payment of tickets for shows, or in the field of medicine, a treatment of epilepsy, the drug Zebinix by Bial Laboratories.Community register of medicinal products for human use: Exalief Gallery of Portuguese inventions File:Frol_de_la_mar_in_roteiro_de_malaca.jpeg Carrack (Nau) - the Oceanic Carrack (a new and different model, and largest carrack) File:Galleon,_Carracks,_Galley_and_Galeota- _Routemap_of_the_Red_Sea-1540_by_D._João_de_Castro.jpg Galleon (the Oceanic Galleon) File:Ships from da Gama’s 2nd voyage 1502.jpg Square-rigged caravel (Round caravel).

Oberon is an epic poem by the German writer Christoph Martin Wieland. It was based on the epic romance Huon de Bordeaux, a French medieval tale,Brown C. Oberon. In: The New Grove Dictionary of Opera. Macmillan, London and New York, 1997. and influenced by Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream and Alexander Pope's version of Geoffrey Chaucer's The Merchant's Tale. It first appeared in 1780 and went through seven rewrites before its final form was published in 1796. Plot For the slaying of Karl the Great's despicable son, Charlot, Huon duke of Guienne, is condemned to go to Babylon (or Bagdad) and demand four molars and a tuft of the beard of the kalif after kissing the latter's daughter and slaying her intended. This feat is accomplished through the friendship of Oberon and the magic power of his horn, a blast of which causes all wicked persons to dance, and of a certain ring, which had been abstracted from its owner, Titania, and to which all the spirit world was subject. Commanded to go to the Pope at Rome before consummating marriage with the kalif's daughter, Huon yields to temptation and the couple are thrown on a desert isle by Oberon, who had deserted his Titania with the vow never to return to her unless a human couple should be found who were absolutely faithful, since she had championed the faithless girl wife of an aged dotard. About the invented quarrel of Oberon and his queen, Titania, is centred the whole conception of Wieland's poem. Thrown by the instrumentality of Titania into captivity in Tunis, Huon and Rezia withstand the first test of temptation and, reunited, return to Paris and reconcile Karl. Influence Sophie Seyler's Hüon und Amande, also known as Oberon It had a major influence on many musical and poetic works of the time, such as Schiller's Don Carlos, Goethe's Faust: The Second Part of the Tragedy and Mozart's The Magic Flute, as well as on the Portuguese poet Francisco Manoel de Nascimento. An adaptation of the poem by Sophie Seyler, titled Hüon und Amande, was re- adapted by Karl Ludwig Giesecke to provide a libretto for Paul Wranitzky, without crediting her. Its English translators include Matthew Lewis, William Sotheby and John Quincy Adams.Listed on a microfilm at the Massachusetts Historical Society The libretto of The Magic Flute by Emanuel Schikaneder was evidently greatly inspired by Giesecke's and thus on Seyler's version of Oberon.David J. Buch, Magic Flutes and Enchanted Forests: The Supernatural in Eighteenth-Century Musical Theater, University of Chicago Press, 2008 Carl Maria von Weber used the poem as the basis for his last opera, Oberon, in 1826.

Biography George Beattie was the son of a crofter and salmon fisher at Whitehill,St Cyrus - Extract from National Gazetteer, 1868 : \\"WHITEHILL, a village in the parish of St Cyrus, county Kincardine, Scotland, adjoining the vil, of Lochside.\\" near St Cyrus, Kincardineshire, where he was born in 1786 to parents, William Beattie and Elizabeth Scott. George was the third eldest of seven children whose names in descending chronology were: James - born/baptised on 10.12.1780; Joseph - born/baptised on 16/05/1784; George/William - born/baptised on 18.09.1786;Ref. 18/09/1786 Old Parish Records of Births 267/00 0010 0151 ST CYRUS/ BEATTIE, WILLIAM / Whitehill / William Beattie and Elizabeth Scott. (Representatives of the National Archives of Scotland strongly suggest that the name George was either an adopted middle name which was later substituted or 'William' was merely a clerical error at the time of Parish Register entry being confused with the father's forename.) Mary - born/baptised on 27.02.1789; Catherine - born/baptised on 19.03.1791; Elizabeth - born/baptised on 08/05/1794 and David - born between 1791-1798. No specific birth/baptism date can be traced for David, either because the OPR was lost or no baptism took place, which would result in no official record.All the Beattie children are listed in a volume of Kirk Session minutes for St Cyrus (ref. CH2/590/1) in a 'List of Inhabitants of the Parish of Ecclesgreig or St Cyrus' on p.29 under 'Whitehill' which was drawn up on 25 October 1798.Barry Dominic Graham, (ed) George Beattie: A Poet Lost in Time, 2013.Researched at the National Archives of Scotland by Barry Dominic Graham and John Molloy, 2013, The George Beattie Project. He received a good education at the parish school of St Cyrus. During his boyhood and even into adulthood, he was notorious for his frolics and love of practical jokes. It is also related of him, that on Saturday afternoons it was his delight to wander among the \\"braes\\" of St Cyrus, and that he used to \\"visit the auld kirkyard with a kind of melancholy pleasure\\". When the boy was about thirteen years of age, his father obtained a situation on the excise at Montrose, and \\"young George\\", it is said, walked all the way to his new home \\"with a tame kae (jackdaw) on his shoulder\\". St Cyrus After an ineffectual attempt to become a mechanic he obtained a clerkship in Aberdeen, but six weeks later his employer died, bequeathing him a legacy of £50. Returning to Montrose, Beattie entered the office of the procurator-fiscal, and on the completion of his legal education in Edinburgh he established himself in Montrose as a writer or attorney. His remarkable conversational gifts, especially as a humourist and his philanthropy rendered him a general favourite among his companions, and, being combined with good business talents, contributed to his speedy success in his profession. Beattie also became factor to the Kirkside Estate in St Cyrus, owned by General Sir Joseph Straton, K.C.B., a Peninsular and Waterloo hero. As an adult, George was considered to be very handsome despite being rather short and stout. He had black wavy hair, blue eyes and a face full of friendliness and fun. =Poems= In 1815 he contributed to the Montrose Review a poem, \\"John o' Arnha\\", which he afterwards elaborated with much care, and published in a separate form, when its rollicking humour and vivid descriptions soon secured it a wide popularity. Its incidents bear some resemblance to those of Tam o' Shanter of which it may be called a pale reflex. In 1818, he published in the Review a poem in the old Scottish dialect, written when he was a mere boy, and entitled \\"The Murderit Mynstrell\\". The poem, which is in a totally different vein from \\"John o' Arnha\\", is characterised throughout by a charming simplicity, a chastened tenderness of sentiment, and a delicacy of delineation which are sometimes regarded as the special attributes of the earlier English poets. In 1819, he published also in the Review, \\"The Bark\\" and in 1820, a wild and eerie rhapsody, entitled \\"The Dream\\". He also wrote several smaller lyrics. Beattie was a freethinker and prone to radicalism in his ideology and was a key member of a small group of like-minded individuals who would meet on a Sunday at the 'Den of Ananias', a picturesque spot near Montrose, to discuss their mutual beliefs. Signature of George Beattie In 1821, Beattie made the acquaintance of a young lady named William Gibson, who was the daughter of his friend, the squire of Stone of Morphie, Robert Gibson. Against her parents wishes, the couple soon contracted a marriage engagement. During the summer of 1822, they would secretly rendezvous in the walled garden of the Gibson owned, but then uninhabited, House of Kinnaber, where was made many vows of fidelity and solemn promises of eternal love. She was proud, aspiring and ambitious whilst he was unreserved, affable and humble. Miss Gibson's affection being sensitive and jealous whilst Beattie's was deeper, more serious and true. Walled Garden at the House of Kinnaber So deeply were the affections of both engaged that a mutual oath, at her behest, was exchanged with these words, \\"May I never know peace in this world or see God in mercy, if I marry another than you.\\" Yet, solemn as it seems, on the part of Miss Gibson, it proved to have been lightly taken and as lightly broken. The course of true love never yet ran smooth and for poor George Beattie, the darkest of clouds hastily approached. In the spring of 1823 a sudden and fearful \\"change came o'er the spirit of his dream\\".Some details sourced from: Andrew (Alexander) Smith, (ed) George Beattie of Montrose: a poet, a humourist, and a man of genius, W. P. Nimmo, 1863. (Public Domain) The story promulgated states that before the marriage was completed, the young lady fell heir to a small fortune from a wealthy uncle, William Mitchell, Esq., who was supposedly a governor of Grenada. Upon discovering the full extent of the sum bequeathed to her mother and herself, she promptly rejected Beattie for a suitor who apparently occupied a better social rank in life, corn merchant William Smart. Deeply wounded by the disappointment, Beattie from that time meditated self-destruction. The following quote in George Beattie's own words from his 'Statement of Facts' is extremely insightful with regard to the generally accepted version of events leading up to his alleged suicide: > \\"That plots were laid by others to oust me and secure Miss Gibson's fortune, > I know well from the inquiries that were made at myself from a certain > quarter. Those who interfered were far too many for me.\\" ~ George Beattie > (1823) =Death= After completing a narrative of his relations with the lady, contained in a history of his life from 1821 to 1823,The 'Statement of Facts', 'Supplement to Statement of Facts', 'Additions to Supplement' and 'The Last'. he provided himself with a pistol purchased in Aberdeen, and, going to St Cyrus, shot himself next to his sister Mary's grave in the Auld Nether Kirkyard on 29 September 1823. He was just 38 years of age. After a wild and stormy night, his body was discovered the following day by a herd boy named William Reith, lying in a 'natural position', resting his head and shoulders on the west wall of the kirkyard, with a letter to his brother David by his side. Of the woman who sent him thus brokenhearted in mad despair to an early grave he takes leave in some lines of touching intensity of feeling within his final poems, \\"The Appeal\\" and \\"Farewell Sonnet\\", if not sublime, they are at least full of sad and sincere beauty. Thus came an end to all the bright, golden visions of a courageous, honest and true heart. Ms. William Gibson (Smart), after a life of alleged loveless comfort, followed by a lingering illness of two years, died in her 42nd year on 22 January 1840 at Castlested in Montrose whilst crying out the name of the man who had given her his heart, George Beattie. She was buried in Rosehill Cemetery of Montrose. Since his death, his poems, accompanied with a memoir, went through several editions. =Obituary= Obituary from the Montrose Review, October 1823. > It is with no ordinary feelings of regret that we have to record the death > of Mr. George Beattie, writer here, which happened on the 29th ultimo. In > his professional capacity, Mr. Beattie was eminent for his integrity, > abilities and conciliatory disposition, which made him regard what was just, > rather than what was scientific.

His > satirical powers (which, keeping a judicious aim, become an active virtue > itself), were elucidated in many instances and thrown with subtle keenness > against vice, folly, and corruption. In testimony of this, he has left > behind him many admired specimens both in prose and verse. The milder > effusions of his genius abound in sentiment and pathos, equal at least to > many of the more lauded poetical pieces of the day; and had he prosecuted > with ardour that gift with which he was favoured, he might have laid claim > to a palm which a less qualified muse may now possess.

The author of the 1863 biography, 'George Beattie of Montrose - a poet, a humourist, and a man of genius' was A.S. Mt. Cyrus, M.A., this name being a pseudonym for an Andrew Smith of Lauriston Mains, who went to the South African Province of Natal, and eventually died in Queenstown, South Africa in 1898 of heart disease, in his early 70s. He was a native of St Cyrus and an avid follower of the works of the Rev. Dr. Alexander Keith. He was also lifelong friends with Dr. Keith's sons. Andrew Smith had three brothers: the Hon. Charles Abercrombie Smith, a vice-chancellor of the University of the Cape of Good Hope; the Rev. David Smith and the Rev. Robert Smith of Carsock. He also had a sister who was the wife of the Rev. W. R. Thomson of Balfour. Grave of George Beattie =Farewell Sonnet= Bibliography *Andrew (Alexander) Smith, (ed) George Beattie of Montrose: a poet, a humourist, and a man of genius, W. P.

Child care is usually undertaken by the parents, and more often the mother who takes leave from employment. Early childhood education in a crèche or nursery is not freely available from the public sector, while fee-paying pre-schools are. History The first pre-school institution was opened in 1816 by Robert Owen in New Lanark, Scotland.education in robert owen's new society: the new lanark institute and schools The Hungarian countess Theresa Brunszvik followed in 1828.Budapest Lexikon, 1993Public Preschool Education In Hungary: A Historical Survey, 1980 In 1837, Friedrich Fröbel opened one in Germany, coining the term \\"kindergarten\\". Leave from work Since the United Kingdom is a highly commodified neoliberal economy, the government does not provide paid health insurance, pensions, and child care, making people dependent on the market economy. Consequently, there is a direct correlation between a family- wellbeing and its welfare. Because of the child poverty rate the United Kingdom experienced in the mid- to late 1990s, the government had to change taxes and imply the benefits, increasing the employment rate and supporting working families. For example, the Child and Working Tax Credits were introduced. Rights to leave from work to care for children have important consequences for career advancement and gender equality. The United Kingdom provides six months of a legal maternal/parental leave. Even though it is longer than the parental leave in the United States, it is also significantly shorter than in the majority of European countries. There is a dependency between the atmosphere a child experienced while growing up and his/her future life. The people who take care of a child can vary: kid's own family, in which mother or/and father takes a leave in order to take care of a child, nannies, foster care, and nurseries; and, consequently, child's experience of transformation into a teenager can vary. Moreover, a child's future perception differs depending on who spent more time with a kid: a mother or a father. Historically, man is a breadwinner and 'good' father is a financially successful man but the father-child relations are crucial and essential in a child's growing up. However, the British parental leave system assumes, first of all, mother's responsibility to take care of children (maternal leave) while father's care (paternal leave) is seen as a question of individual choice. =Maternity leave= The major right, which goes beyond the minimum set by the Pregnant Workers Directive,92/85/EEC is a mix of paid and unpaid maternity leave. A contract of employment can always be and often is more generous. Otherwise, the minimum right to paid maternity leave arises for women employees after 26 weeks' work, though the right to unpaid leave has no qualifying period.Work and Families Act 2006 (c 18) abolished the qualification period for ordinary and additional maternity leave. Under the Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999MPLR 1999 (SI 1999/3312) r 8 mothers must take compulsory leave at the time of child birth for two weeks. After that comes a right to 6 weeks' leave paid at 90 per cent of ordinary salary. Then is 20 weeks' leave paid at a rate set by statute, which was £123.06 per week in 2010. This has to be at least the same level as statutory sick pay.Boyle v Equal Opportunities Commission (1998) C-411/96, [1998] ECR I-6401 Then she may take additional but unpaid maternity leave for another 26 weeks.ERA 1996 ss 72-73 and MPLR 1999 rr 7-8 She must tell the employer 15 weeks before the date of the expected birth, in writing if the employer requests it. Except insofar as they administer the payments, employers do not bear most costs of maternity leave as they are reimbursed by the government according to their size and national insurance contributions.Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 s 167 Along with different forms of leave, mothers have the right to not suffer any professional detriment or dismissal while they are absent, and should be able to return to the same job after 26 weeks, or another suitable job after 52 weeks.MPLR 1999 rr 17-20 =Paternity leave= UK employers are reimbursed by the government when employees take paid leave for child care For fathers, the position is less generous. To redress the balance between how much of child raising each partner bears, under the Additional Paternity Leave Regulations 2010APLR 2010 (SI 2010/1055) it will be possible for a woman to transfer up to 26 weeks of her leave entitlements to her male partner. Otherwise the Paternity and Adoption Leave Regulations 2002 state that a man is entitled to a minimum of just 2 weeks off, at the statutory rate of pay.PALR 2002 SI 2002/2788 r 6; See also Statutory Paternity Pay and Statutory Adoption Pay (General) Regulations 2002 (SI 2002/2822) =Parental leave= Both parents may also benefit from \\"parental leave\\" provisions in the MPLR 1999, passed after the Parental Leave Directive.96/34/EC Until a child turns 5, or a disabled child turns 18, parents can take up to 13 weeks' unpaid leave.MPLR 1999 rr 13-15 Unless there is another collective agreement in place, employees should give 21 days' notice, no more than 4 weeks in a year, at least 1 week at a time, and the employer can postpone the leave for 6 months if business would be unduly disrupted.MPLR 1999 r 16 and Sch 2 Otherwise similar provisions apply on employees not suffering detriment or dismissal and having a right to their previous jobs back. = Emergency leave = \\"Emergency leave\\" is, under ERA 1996 section 57A, available for employees to deal with birth or a child's issues at school, as well as other emergencies such as dependents' illness or death, so long as the employee informs the employer as soon as reasonably practicable. In Qua v John Ford Morrison Solicitors[2003] IRLR 184 (EAT) Cox J emphasised that there is no requirement to deliver daily updates.  Non- familial care  Contemporary Western society is witnessing a major expansion of early childhood services. One of the ways of taking care experience for a kid in the UK is a in-home child care, which is a government supported, non- familial care provided in the child's home. Historically, nannies took care of children in private homes of nobles. To continue this tradition in modern society, the government began to subsidise and regulate such arrangements. Since the number of employed women increased, it was necessary for the government to create programs that would benefit both women and their kids. In 2009, it was estimated that there were 63,000 nannies or non-relative careers to help families in the UK.Social Issues Research Centre, 2009 Even nowadays, nannies are considered to be a privilege of wealthy families, putting the limitations on the working class sample. That is one of the reasons why the UK has different programs that help lower- and middle-class families to take care of their children. Since the UK is a liberal market economy (LME), it relies heavily on market mechanism to deliver the programs. Requesting flexible working Beyond the period around child birth, after EA 2002, employees gained the right to request flexible working patterns for the purpose of caring for a child under the age of 6, or a disabled child under age 18. The right to make the request is contained in ERA 1996 section 80F, and despite the fact that employers may decline the request, statistics show that under the obligation to consider, employers grant requests in 80 per cent of cases. An employee must make the request in writing, the employer must reply in writing, and can only decline the request on the basis of a correct fact assessment,ERA 1996 s 80H and within 8 grounds listed in section 80G, which generally concern business and organisational necessity. In Commotion Ltd v Rutty[2006] IRLR 171 (EAT) a toy warehouse assistant was refused a reduction to part-time work because, according to the manager, everyone needed to work full-time to maintain \\"team spirit\\". The Employment Appeal Tribunal ruled that because \\"team spirit\\" was not one of the legitimate grounds for refusal, Mrs Rutty should get compensation, which is set at a maximum of 8 weeks' pay.See Flexible Working (Eligibility, Complaints and Remedies) Regulations 2002 r 7 (SI 2002/3236) *Instituto nazionale della providenza social v Bruno [2010] IRLR 890, part-time workers and occupational pensions *Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009 (c 22) Pre school =Public nurseries= =Private nurseries= *Nursery school =Sure start= Children's Centres are expected to provide: * In centres in the 30% most disadvantaged areas: integrated early learning and childcare (early-years provision) for a minimum of 10 hours a day, five days a week, 48 weeks a year; and support for a childminder network * In centres in the 70% least disadvantaged areas, which do not elect to offer early-years provision: drop- in activity sessions for children, such as stay-and-play sessions * Family Support, including support and advice on parenting, information about services available in the area and access to specialist, targeted services; and Parental Outreach * Child and Family Health Services, such as antenatal and postnatal support, information and guidance on breastfeeding, health and nutrition, smoking cessation support, and speech and language therapy and other specialist support * Links with Jobcentre Plus to encourage and support parents and carers who wish to consider training and employment * Quick and easy access to wider servicesGovernance guidance for Sure Start Children’s Centres and extended schools Department for Education and Skills, 2007 =Other schools= *Children's Regional Planning Committee *Timeline of young people's rights in the United Kingdom See also *Ageing of Europe Notes References * External links *Childcare costs forces families into debt Category:Child care ","title":"Child care in the United Kingdom"},{"id":"33012176","text":"The Aalbach is a 26.5 km long river in Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg, Germany.

She established herself as one of Germany's leading actresses in the 1760s and was acclaimed for her portrayal of passionate, majestic, tragic heroines. From 1767 she was professionally and personally associated with the theatre director Abel Seyler, whom she married in 1772, as the leading actress of the Hamburg National Theatre and later of the Seyler Theatre Company. With Seyler she led an itinerant life until her death, performing widely across the German-speaking realm. She also stayed for several periods at the Vienna Burgtheater between 1757 and 1772. She was associated with all the leading theatres of her era: Hamburg, Vienna, Weimar, Gotha and Mannheim. She is regarded as one of the most important female playwrights of the 18th century, and her renown as an actress contributed to the popularity of her plays. Her libretto for the opera Oberon (originally titled Huon and Amanda) was a major inspiration for Emanuel Schikaneder's libretto for the opera The Magic Flute; a lightly adapted version of Seyler's opera was the first opera performed by Schikaneder's troupe at their new theatre, the Theater auf der Wieden, and established a tradition within the Schikaneder company of fairy-tale operas that was to culminate two years later in The Magic Flute, which shared several plots, characters, and singers with Seyler's Oberon.Buch, David (2008) Magic flutes & enchanted forests: the supernatural in eighteenth-century musical theater (p. 293). University of Chicago Press. . Early life She was born as Friederike Sophie Sparmann in Dresden as the only child of the doctor Johann Wilhelm Sparmann and Luise Catharina Pöppelmann; her grandfather was the famous architect Matthäus Daniel Pöppelmann. She came from a broken home; her parents divorced when she was eleven years old, and her mother joined a convent. At the age of twelve she was sent to live with an abusive maternal uncle, who treated her so badly that she ran away to another relative, who died already in 1753. In order to escape an arranged marriage that her uncle had set up, she ran away from him to join the theatre at the age of sixteen in 1754.Heinz, Andrea, \\"Seyler, Sophie Friederike\\" in: Neue Deutsche Biographie 24 (2010), p. 301Kürschner, Joseph, \\"Hensel, Sophie Friederike\\" in: Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie 11 (1880), pp. 787–789Wilhelm Kosch, \\"Seyler, Friederike Sophie\\", in Dictionary of German Biography, eds. Walther Killy and Rudolf Vierhaus, Vol. 9, Walter de Gruyter, 2005, , Theatrical career, 1754–1767 In 1754 she joined the troupe of Harlekin Kirsch. In 1755, aged seventeen, she married a fellow actor, 27-year old Johann Gottlieb Hensel (1728–1787), and at the end of 1755 they both joined the troupe of Franz Schuch in Breslau, where she earned acclaim as an actress. In 1757 they joined Konrad Ernst Ackermann's company in Hamburg. Later in 1757 she went to Vienna to perform at the Burgtheater, despite having signed a one-year contract with Ackermann. From that point she lived apart from her husband, and they later formally divorced. Until 1765 she performed in Vienna, Frankfurt and Hildburghausen. For a time she contemplated giving up acting due to an illness, but she finally returned to the Ackermann company in Hamburg in 1765. Hamburg National Theatre, Seyler Theatre Company and marriage to Abel Seyler Abel Seyler, Sophie Seyler's second husband and founder of the Hamburg National Theatre and the Seyler Theatre Company The year 1767 marked the start of her lifelong professional and personal association with Abel Seyler, who later became her second husband. In that year a group of Hamburg merchants led by Abel Seyler took over the Comödienhaus theatre building from the Ackermann troupe, and founded the Hamburg National Theatre, the first attempt to establish a national theatre in Germany on the basis of Ludvig Holberg's ideas. A fervent admirer of Friederike Sophie Hensel, Abel Seyler was a former banker and \\"a handsome bon vivant\\" who had suffered a sensational bankruptcy for an enormous sum in the wake of the Amsterdam banking crisis of 1763, and who would later become one of the great theatre principals of 18th century Europe. It was largely his admiration for Friederike Sophie Hensel, by then 29, that led him to devote himself to theatre from 1767; as a result of her rivalry with 22-year old Karoline Schulze, Friederike Sophie Hensel was at the centre of the intrigue that led her admirer Seyler to \\"establish a theatre for her, where she could reign undisputed without fearing any rivalry.\\"Susanne Kord: \\"Friederike Sophie Seyler. In Ein Blick hinter die Kulissen: Deutschsprachige Dramatikerinnen im 18. und 19. Jahrhundert (pp. 312–314). Springer-Verlag, 2016 Friederike Sophie Hensel was the leading actress of the Hamburg National Theatre, which also employed Konrad Ekhof as its male lead actor and de facto artistic director and Gotthold Ephraim Lessing as a dramaturg. Lessing wrote his influential work on drama and which gave its name to the field of dramaturgy, Hamburg Dramaturgy, as a collection of commentary on the plays; her prominent role within the national theatre is documented by Lessing in the Hamburg Dramaturgy, where Lessing lauded her as one of Germany's finest actresses. The Hamburg National Theatre had to close in 1769 when Abel Seyler's money had run out after two years of lavish spending. In 1769 Abel Seyler established the travelling Seyler Theatre Company, an effective successor of the national theatre, retaining Konrad Ekhof and Friederike Sophie Hensel as its leading actors. The company established itself as the leading theatre company in German-speaking Europe in the 1770s, and is credited with popularising Shakespeare's plays in German-speaking Europe and with promoting the Sturm und Drang playwrights and a serious German opera tradition. Initially based in Hanover, the company stayed for three years at the court of the arts patron Duchess Anna Amalia in Weimar from 1771 to 1774, coinciding with the infancy of the cultural era known as the Weimar Classicism. Friederike Sophie Hensel performed with the Seyler company from 1769, but stayed at the Vienna Burgtheater from 1771 to 1772. In 1772 she reunited with Seyler, her longtime love interest, and married him in November 1772 in Oßmannstedt just outside Weimar. From 1772 she accompanied Abel Seyler professionally, performing mostly at theatres led by him. After the 1774 Schloss Weimar fire, the Seyler company moved to the ducal court of Gotha, and was based in Leipzig and Dresden from 1775 to 1777. From 1777 to 1779 the Seyler company was primarily based in Frankfurt and Mainz and travelled extensively to Cologne, Hanau, Mannheim, Heidelberg and Bonn. In 1779 the Seyler company formed the core of the new Mannheim National Theatre, which her husband led as its founding artistic director. At Mannheim her husband directed several Shakespeare productions, and left a lasting legacy, while Friederike Sophie portrayed key Shakespeare roles such as Lady Macbeth. In 1781 her jealousy provoked an unfortunate incident; in response to repeated insolent remarks during theatre rehearsals by her student Elisabeth Toscani, her husband gave Toscani a slap in the face, which led to his retirement from the directorship. The Seyler couple then left Mannheim and stayed in Schleswig from 1781 to 1783, where her husband was artistic director of the Schleswig Court Theatre. From 1785 to 1787 she again performed at the Comödienhaus in Hamburg under the direction of Friedrich Ludwig Schröder, while her husband sometimes worked as a prompter at the theatre. In 1787 she moved with her husband to Schleswig, where he again became director of the Schleswig Court Theatre and where she performed until her death in 1789. Artistic legacy Friederike Sophie Seyler was widely regarded as the greatest German actress of her time, and the greatest German actress of the 18th century alongside Friederike Caroline Neuber. She mastered diverse roles, but won particular acclaim for her portrayal of passionate, majestic tragic heroines such as Clytemnestra, Medea and Gertrude in Hamlet. Gotthold Ephraim Lessing described her in his Hamburg Dramaturgy as \\"incontestably one of the best actresses that German theatre has ever seen.\\" He praised the ease and precision of her declamations, and her subtle acting. He was particularly impressed by how she mastered the death scene as the heroine in his own play Miss Sara Sampson, writing that \\"one cannot ask more of art than what Madame Hensel does in the role of Sara.\\" Writing about her performance in Françoise de Graffigny's Cénie, Lessing noted that \\"not a word falls from her mouth to the earth. What she says she did not learn, it comes from her own head, from her own heart. She likes to talk, or she does not like to talk, her play continues uninterruptedly. I only knew one mistake; but it is a very rare mistake; a very enviable mistake. The actress is too great for the role.\\" The actor August Wilhelm Iffland described her as one of his greatest role models. While she was regarded as Germany's most prominent living actress, she also had a reputation for being unusually conceited and difficult to work with.Jan Philipp Reemtsma, Lessing in Hamburg: 1766-1770, C.H.Beck, 2007 She felt gravely insulted by the slightest criticism of her acting, even by generally very positive reviews by Lessing; her vanity, career ambition, demand for the most prominent roles and rivalry with other actresses caused tensions throughout her career. Richard E. Schade describes her as \\"a beautiful, if rather solidly built and domineering leading lady.\\"Lessing Yearbook XII, 1980 p. 81 According to Phyllis Hartnoll, \\"even Lessing, who detested her, had to admit she was a fine actress. In private life she was malicious and intriguing, her character contributing to the downfall of the Hamburg enterprise.\\"Phyllis Hartnoll, The Oxford companion to the theatre, p. 386, Oxford University Press, 1983 Friederike Sophie Seyler as a playwright Original cover of Hüon und Amande by Friederike Sophie Seyler (1789) Friederike Sophie Seyler only wrote two plays; nevertheless she is regarded as one of the most important female playwrights of the 18th century, and she was one of very few female playwrights of her era. In her own lifetime she was better known as an actress than as a playwright. Anne Fleig notes that her prominence as an actress was important for the contemporary influence of her plays.Anne Fleig: \\"Friederike Sophie Hensel: Die Entführung, oder: die zärtliche Mutter (1772)\\". In Handlungs-Spiel-Räume: Dramen von Autorinnen im Theater des ausgehenden 18. Jahrhunderts (pp. 145–167), Königshausen & Neumann, 1999 She also translated two plays from French. =Die Entführung oder die zärtliche Mutter= Her first play was titled Die Familie auf dem Lande and was published in 1770. A revised version of the play was published in 1772 under the title Die Entführung oder die zärtliche Mutter (The Abduction, or The Tender Mother). The play was a dramatic adaptation of the 1767 novel Conclusion of the Memoirs of Miss Sidney Bidulph (1767) by Frances Sheridan, a largely forgotten female novelist, that was a sequel to her earlier novel Memoirs of Miss Sidney Bidulph. The latter novel was itself inspired by Pamela; or, Virtue Rewarded by Samuel Richardson. The play is written in the style of a comédie larmoyante, popular with female playwrights, where a happy ending follows a tragic narrative.Susanne Kord (1996). \\"All's Well That Ends Well? Marriage, Madness and Other Happy Endings in Eighteenth- Century Women's Comedies.\\" The Lessing Yearbook 28 (1996): 181–197 =Huon and Amanda or Oberon= As a playwright Friederike Sophie Seyler is best remembered for the influential romantic Singspiel Huon and Amanda (), better known as Oberon. Inspired by Wieland's poem Oberon and one of the earliest plays based on a fairy tale, it was published in 1789, the year she died, and was dedicated to her and her husband's long-time friend and collaborator, the actor Friedrich Ludwig Schröder. It was published in a new edition after her death in 1792 under the title Oberon, or The Elf King (). The play, with original music by Carl Hanke, became a great success in Hamburg; Hanke had been recruited by her husband as music director at the Comödienhaus in Hamburg in 1783. Her libretto was shortly after re-adapted by Karl Ludwig Giesecke for the theatre company of Emanuel Schikaneder, with new music by Paul Wranitzky. Seyler's play with Wranitzky's music became the first opera performed by Schikaneder's troupe at the Theater auf der Wieden, and established a tradition within the company of fairy tale operas within the Schikaneder company that was to culminate in Mozart's and Schikaneder's opera The Magic Flute two years later. Oberon as written by Sophie Seyler and built upon by Giesecke is similar to The Magic Flute in its plot and characters, and a number of the singers who participated in the Schikaneder production of Seyler/Wranitzky's Oberon took similar roles in the later opera. According to Peter Branscombe, \\"it has long been recognized that Giesecke, the named author of Wranitzky's libretto, deserves little credit for what is largely a plagiarism,\\" concluding that \\"Giesecke's \\"Oberon, König der Elfen is hardly more than a mild revision of Seyler's book.\\" After the theatrical success of Giesecke's plagiarized version (and also after Seyler's death), Seyler's original was renamed Oberon and performed under this title.Peter Branscombe, W.

It is observed on the sixth day of Ashwin Shukla Paksha, the seventh day of Ashwin Shukla Paksha (in Bihar) and ends on the tenth day of Ashwin Shukla Paksha.Durga Puja Krishna Jayanthi (Janmastami) and Manikkasamy Swamy Pooja are also very famous. Mega Yaga Pooja and Mega Annathana Pooja are large celebrations. Around 3000 people participate in the event. The Sri Kalaiamman festival is conducted on North Street in the month of Panguni. Then Sri Mangaththayammal kovil Kumbhabhisegam event was conducted on 11,12 May 2014 and more than 3000 peoples participated. The Sri Pethanasamy and Sri Maalaiammal Kovil Kumbhabhisegam events were conducted on 24 May 2013 and saw more than 5000 people participating. Facilities There are good transport facilities to the nearest town, Aundipatty (RAR(Alagarsamy),SIVADHARANI,CDR-I,CDR-II)These for local minibus. A Post Office is present, as are two banks (South Indian Bank, Indian Overseas Bank), and there is a primary health centre, a veterinary hospital, library, and yoga centre.

She was convicted and sentenced to 18 years' imprisonment in July 2014. Career Richardson appeared in minor roles in television series such as The Vampire Diaries, Franklin & Bash, and The Walking Dead. Personal life Richardson was abandoned by her mother at the age of two and raised by her father, Terry Rogers. Rogers worked at General Motors in Doraville, Georgia. She was the oldest of three children, having one younger brother and one younger sister. At the time of her arrest, Richardson lived in New Boston, Texas. She has been married three times. On October 8, 2011, she married Nathan Richardson, a U.S. Army veteran who works as a mechanic in a military depot. He filed for divorce in June 2013. At the time of her arrest in June 2013, Richardson had five children, ranging in age from 4 to 19 with her two previous husbands and was pregnant with her sixth child. On July 4, 2013, Richardson gave birth to a boy, named Brody, while in custody. Officials said that the baby was born four months prematurely, weighed only two pounds at birth, and that he needed to remain hospitalized. In August 2013, Nathan Richardson won temporary custody of Brody. Arrest and conviction In May 2013, while going through a divorce, Richardson called the police and falsely accused her husband, Nathan Richardson, of mailing letters laced with the poison ricin to several politicians. Nathan Richardson was never charged in regard to the matter. He told investigators that his wife set him up. Investigators found evidence that she had mailed the ricin-laced letters herself in an effort to set up her estranged husband. Richardson was arrested on June 7, 2013, for her alleged involvement in ricin-laced letters being sent to politicians such as President Barack Obama and New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. She was charged with \\"mailing a threatening letter to President Barack Obama\\". On June 6, Richardson confessed that she had mailed the three letters, knowing they contained ricin, but claimed her husband made her mail the letters. On June 20, a federal judge ordered Richardson be given a psychological examination, based on a request from her court-appointed attorney, who said she had shown \\"a pattern of behavior\\" that raised questions about her ability to assist in her own criminal defense.Chron.com On June 28, Richardson was indicted and charged in the mailing of ricin-laced letters to President Obama and Mayor Bloomberg. The three-count indictment accused her of mailing three threatening letters around May 20 to Obama, Bloomberg, and Mark Glaze, the director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns. A criminal complaint filed on June 7 revealed that the FBI had used Mail Isolation Control and Tracking (MICT), a previously undisclosed mass surveillance program run by the U.S. Postal Service, to narrow its investigation to Richardson. On November 22, Richardson reached a plea agreement on three counts. On December 10, she pleaded guilty and was sent to the Texas State Prison System. The U.S. government contracts with county and state officials nationwide to hold federal prisoners pending trial. On July 16, 2014 most of the charges against Richardson were dropped as per her plea agreement. The charges of making threats against the President of the United States and mailing threatening communications were dropped. Richardson was convicted of the charge pertaining to manufacture and possession of a biological weapon and sentenced to 18 years in prison, $367,222 in restitution, $100 special assessment fee (for psychological testing), 5 years' supervised release and ordered to undergo psychological treatment while in prison and continue psychological treatment after her release. On March 16, 2015 the Investigation Discovery channel aired episode 10 of season 6 of the television show Who the (Bleep) Did I Marry? which featured Shannon Richardson's case as told by her ex-husband. The episode was titled \\"Poison Love\\". In March 2015, Shannon Richardson filed suit under , for deprivation of rights while imprisoned. The civil action was \\"dismissed with prejudice\\" on 7 March 2015. Richardson is being held in a federal prison in Fort Worth, Texas with a projected release date of Feb. 23, 2029.

In 1919 the two parties merged to form the Estonian Labour Party. Ideology The Radical Socialist Party was founded as a clearly left-wing party, that supported social equality, democracy, but also liberal economic policies, and had a similar programme to the Russian Trudoviks. Its voters came from the poorer classes and therefore it had a radical approach to the land reform and advocated the separation of church and state and a democratic constitution, which would give more power to the parliament.

Geography  = Sources = The Breitenbach has its source at Albtrauf, the northwestern steep drop of the Swabian Alb. Its main source, named Breitenbachquelle, is located about northeast of Gönningen and south of Kreisstraße 6729 and 736.5 m south of Barm on the northern flank of the Pfullinger Berg, a northern spur of the Barm 736.5, in a clearing to just over elevation. The spring, situated under a severe slope, is enclosed in a niche of about with natural stone and is designated as a natural monument. The water rises here at the higher layer boundary of the lower Weißjura-marl to the well-layered limestone formation below the spring, lime sinter cushions grow from the spring water through lime precipitation. A little further south and thus above the main spring there is another spring at a little above elevation. = Course = At the beginning, the Breitenbach, which mainly flows northwards, flows through the Selchen valley and remains in the forest until it crosses the Landesstraße 383 above Reutlingen after about half of its course.

Schellackia is transmitted via insect vectors, primarily mites and mosquitoes, which take up the parasite in blood meals. These vectors then subsequently infect reptilian and amphibian which consume the infected insects. The parasites deform erythrocytes of the host into crescents, and can be visualised using a blood smear. The type species, Schellackia bolivari, was described by Anton Reichenow in 1919. History of Knowledge Schellackia was first described by Anton Reichenow in 1919, with the type species Schellackia bolivari having been discovered parasitizing the spiny-footed lizard Acanthodactylus erythrurus and the Spanish Psammodromus hispanicus within the Iberian Peninsula. At first, many difficulties in describing new species were present – very few characteristics could be described from blood sporozoites within the primary host, with most defining characteristics being restricted to the parasite’s endogenous stages within the gut epithelium of the host. This led to relatively few described species for a parasite genus that was supposedly very geographically widespread. In more recent years, however, molecular characterisation methods have allowed more precise determination of species identity and their phylogenetic relationship. Life Cycle As is typical of Apicomplexans, Schellackia replicates via multiple fission. The parasite utilises both merogony (asexual) and gametogony (sexual), with both processes occurring within the mucosal epithelium of the duodenum of infected hosts. Young meronts can be expected to be around 6 μm in diameter, growing up to around 30 μm as they mature before they divide into merozoites. However, these figures and the time required for maturation can vary between species. The meronts subsequently split via cytokinesis, dividing into usually around 8 to 32 merozoites which are released as the host cell ruptures. Post-merogony, the development of merozoites produces a residual body of variable size. Merozoites are non-motile and proceed to infect other cells in order to rapidly reproduce. Gametogony occurs later in an infection, generally after the majority of merogony activity. Male gametocytes (microgamonts) divide to form flagellated microgametes, while female gametocytes (macrogamonts) concurrently differentiate into macrogametes, sometimes even within the same host cell. These gametes then fuse forming zygotes within the epithelial layer of the duodenum of the host. Subsequently, zygotes transition to an oocyst stage. This transition is marked by the formation of large refractile bodies within the oocysts, soon followed by the appearance of developing sporozoites. The mature octonucleate oocyst is a characteristic phase of Schellackia’s lifecycle. Eventually, the oocyst divides by endopolygeny into eight sporozoites which combine with extensions of the refractory body as they exit the ruptured oocyst. This process leaves behind empty spaces within the epithelium and lamina propria of the host. The sporozoites then make their way into the host’s blood cells including erythrocytes, leucocytes and macrophages. The sporozoites often exist within a common parasitophorous vacuole which is shared with other sporozoites, although some also dwell within their own individual vacuole. The presence of sporozoites within the blood cells of the host allows the parasite to proliferate to additional hosts via blood-consuming insect vectors such as mites, ticks and mosquitos. Hosts and Habitat Schellackia species infect reptiles and amphibians all around the world, and is present in all continents except Antarctica. Although they have primarily been studied in lizards, they have been found to infect other animals including the Brazilian tree-frog, Phrynohyas venulosa. The parasites are highly host specific, tending to infect a single host genus even when other lizard genera are present within the same geographical area. Multiple species of Schellackia are named after their archetypal host, such as Schellackia occidentalis and Schellackia agama.  Description of the Organism  Schellackia gametocytes are contained within parasitophorous vacuoles consisting of two membranes which are connected by numerous points of contact. The outer layer is thicker and bilaminate, while the inner layer comprises a single thinner structure. The vacuoles containing macrogametocytes are dense with fine granular material, while such material is largely absent from vacuoles containing microgametocytes. The microgametocytes and microgametes are contained within their own membrane within the vacuole. Developing microgametocytes have a peripheral nucleus without a visible nucleolus but contain dense patches of peripheral chromatin. The surface of the microgametocyte is covered in deep invaginations which provide increased surface area. Microgametes have flagella with a typical 9+2 axoneme structure, and five microtubules run parallel to the nucleus along the length of the gamete. Macrogametocytes are bound by a pellicle comprising two membranes perforated by multiple micropores. Two shapes of mitochondria are present – large, rounded mitochondria with tubular cristae are located beneath the pellicle, while smaller elongated mitochondria with a single row of cristae are present in aggregates. The nucleus is larger than the one found in microgametocytes and contains a large, compact nucleolus. The cytoplasm contains a dense RER network, as well as food, lipid, and other various vesicles. The presence of a high density of amylopectin granules in the cytoplasm causes it to have a foamy appearance, a characteristic maintained in the zygote. Schellackia sporozoites exist either free-floating or within a parasitophorous vacuole within a host cell. On occasion, multiple sporozoites have been observed to fit into a single expanded parasitophorous vacuole. The space within the vacuole surrounding the sporozoites contains a fine granular substance, and sometimes membranous residues. The sporozoites themselves are bound by a pellicle and contain a nucleus with a nucleolus and peripheral chromatin. One or two refractile bodies are also present, as well as multiple large mitochondria, amylopectin granules, and micronemes which extend from the apical tip along the length of the sporozoites. An important defining characteristic of the genus Schellackia is its octonucleate oocyst stage within the small intestine of a primary host – a combination of the presence of such oocysts as well as a lack of other parasites within the geographical area which share similar characteristics is sufficient to identify the genus. The oocysts are enclosed in a translucent wall which are partially impermeable to Giemsa stain, and the cells leave behind empty rounded spaces upon expiration.

It flows into the Neckar in Neckartenzlingen. On its way from the Karst spring to the next large municipality Bad Urach, a former Erms sedimented, especially during floods, no less than 8 valley cataracts, where chemically precipitated travertine repeatedly drops ca. 2–5 m.  Geography  The Ermstal valley is one of the largest valley systems that have cut into the layer of the Swabian Alb from the northwest. The nearby large waters of the river system of the Rhine lie much deeper than the Danube on the south-eastern side of the Alb, so that regressive erosion of the Rhenish waters is gradually shifting back the European watershed at the expense of the Danube basin. Due to the Neckar river, which runs here particularly close to the Alb's eaves, and the great difference in altitude between them, the Erms possessed sufficient erosive power to form one of the most striking valleys of the Alb's eaves. The valley is rich in karst phenomena. The longitudinal profile, stepped by limestone sinter deposits, was once more conspicuous than today due to several natural reservoirs and favoured the industrial development along the river because of the easily usable water power. =Spring = Ermsursprung The spring known as \\"Ermsursprung\\" is located just under one kilometre southeast of the village Seeburg in the Mühltal. The average flow rate of the karst spring is between 335 l/s and 380 l/s (this corresponds to 20.1 m³ or 22.8 m³ per minute). Depending on the weather, the source discharge fluctuates between 67 l/s and 1000 l/s. = Course = Coming from the Fischburg valley, the much longer Fischbach flows into Seeburg. Its valley is part of the western border of the former Münsingen military training area. Mühltal, Fischburgtal and the Seetal, which flows in from the south, form here a three-part Talspinne. Between Seeburg and Bad Urach the river Erms flows through the upper Ermstal, which here forms the Border of the villages Wittlingen and Sirchingen. The valley section is characterized by the closely opposite, wooded slopes of the Albtrauf, crowned by limestone rocks. Until the 19th century, several natural lakes existed, dammed by Kalktuffbarren. Since the limestone tuff (precipitated lime) is a good building material that is easy to extract, the lakes gradually disappeared. In the area of the old town of Urach lies the centre of another valley spider. Here, from the east, the multi-branched valley system of the Elsach, whose sources lie in the Falkensteiner Höhle and in the Elsachbröller, flows out. From the southwest, from the Maisental, where the Uracher Wasserfall and the Gütersteiner Wasserfall lie, the Brühlbach flows into the Elsachbröller. Below Urach, the Stufenrandtal valley, eroded by the Erms river, widens. Down the valley there are more and more traces of the early use of the Erms' water power during industrialisation. In Dettingen there is still a paper mill. The Glemsbach flows into Neuhausen. Here as in Metzingen, vineyards accompany the course of the river. The Erms leaves the valley of the Jura mountains and flows into the Albvorland. Below Riederich the Riederichbach, which was previously called Stetterbach for a long time, flows out. After the river has passed Bempflingen, it flows into the Neckar at Neckartenzlingen, whose waters reach the North Sea via the Rhine. = Catchment area = The river Erms drains an area of about 179 km², mainly in the middle Swabian Alb and its foreland. Its upper part belongs to the Mittleren Kuppenalb, the lower part almost entirely to the foothills of the central Swabian Alb, where it passes successively through the Neuffen-Vorberge and the Erms-Steinach-Albvorland. Finally, a gusset close to the mouth of the river counts towards the subspace Nürtinger-Esslinger Neckartal of the Fildern. The highest point in the area reaches about 870 m above sea level in the area of the Römerstein on the Alb plateau. = Tributaries = Tributaries from the source to the estuary.

During the Roman period, there was a more important Roman settlement at the strategically favourable place of the valley exit, at the place of today's Metzingen, which was called Vicus Armissium.Der Landkreis Reutlingen, , p. 1020 . At that time the Ermstal was called Swiggerstal, later the name was used as a landscape designation until the 15th century was transferred to a larger area .Der Landkreis Reutlingen, p. 96f. The villages came to Württemberg in the Middle Ages and have shared its fate ever since. Therefore, in the 16th century all communities situated along the river Erms were reformed. Within Württemberg the settlements belonged to Oberamt Urach, only Neckartenzlingen was part of the Oberamt Nürtingen. The towns of Urach were mainly transferred to the district of Reutlingen in 1938 when the district of Urach was dissolved. Bempflingen went with Neckartenzlingen to the district of Nürtingen to the district of Esslingen; the villages above Urach, like Seeburg, Wittlingen and Sirchingen, went to the district of Münsingen in 1938, 1973 also to the Landkreis Reutlingen.

From there the river makes its way through Ottenbach and Krummwälden up to its confluence with the Fils near Eislingen. The hamlet Krummwälden, which was called in former times as \\"Welden,\\" carried for some time the name of this river. It was changed to avoid ambiguity.  Catchment area  The Krumm drains 30.0 km² at the middle Albtrauf southwest of the Fils. Its catchment area has roughly the shape of a parallelogram with a longer diagonal from northeast to southwest of about 10 km, perpendicular to it the maximum width reaches a little over 5 km. Its northwest corner lies on the 684.1 m tall Hohenstaufen, the northeastern one on Rechberg at an elevation of 707.9 m above sea level, the southeastern one at an unnamed, 564.6 m tall peak east of the Salacher Kapfhöfe, the southwestern one at the mouth (below 330 m ). The highest point is at the top of the Rechberg. Beyond the well developed northern watershed between Hohenstaufen and Rechberg the left Rems tributaries Beutenbach, Tannbach and Tiefenbach compete with the Krumm. On the eastern, Rehgebirge, it is briefly the Waldstetter Bach at Rechberg, which also reaches the Rems via the Josefsbach, and then to the south-east corner of the Reichenbach, which, like all subsequent competitors, drains to the Fils.

History Its construction was started and/or completed between the end of the 16th century or beginning of the 17th century, although some suggest the 1500s. By 1678, the house as associated with a Domingos do Amaral. Alterations were made to the house with the inclusion of a formal chapel in 1722 (from an inscription on the door of the chapel). Sometime during the 18th century it became a headquarters for forces during the third Napoleonic invasion of Portugal. Similarly, during the Liberal Wars Brigadier Manuel Cardoso de Faria Pinto, used this reside (where lived at that time) as base during the battles between absolutists and liberals. On 2 January 1997, from a dispatch of the Ministry of Culture (), the residence was classified as a Property of Public Interest (): since 1988, it had already been adapted as a tourist residence. Architecture The residence is into the rural countryside of Mangualde, encircled by walls that divide several patios (with the exception of the western and eastern flanks). Its horizontal plan is composed of a single floor, divided into various spaces and covered in tile roofing. Entrance into the building is made by large portico surmounted with a coat-of-arms framed in sectioned gables, over cornice. The coat-of-arms was sculpted in the 18th century, and belongs to the descendants of the Cardosos, Farias, Amarais and Coutos hereditary lines. The doorway gives access to the main courtyard and Couto de Homiziados (a frontier space that provided sanctuary from justice).Margarida Garcez Ventura (1990), p.603-604 This principal facade is surrounded by porch supported by cylindrical columns with rectangular base. Doors around the house follow the lintel line, while the sash windows have granite frames, which are repeated all around the property. The rear facade, also with access to the interior, is preceded by five granite steps. A chapel abuts the lateral facade of the residence, built in 1722 and dedicated to Santo António, with its main entrance topped by a niche with the image of the patron. To the right of this portico was originally a pulpit in rock, since removed. The parcel's surrounding walls have several openings to access the patios.

It flows into the Aich near Neuenhaus.  Geography  = Course = The Schaich springs at about 544 m from the Hengstbrunnen in the forest south of Altdorf a little east of the Gabeleiche at the Rauhen Hau. Its headwaters lie in the north of the 582.6 m high Bromberg. From there the river Schaich flows in mainly eastern direction through or at the edge of the areas of the municipalities Altdorf, Holzgerlingen, Weil im Schönbuch, Dettenhausen, Walddorfhäslach, Aichtal and Schlaitdorf. At the end of the district Neuenhaus of Aichtal it flows at an elevation of 315.9315.9 m southwest into Aich. At the end of its 23.6 km long path with an average bottom gradient of 9.7 ‰ it flows about 228 meters altitude below its source. The river Schaich flows in mainly eastern direction through the natural area Schönbuch, a mountainous forest area of the south German Keuperberglandes. It has its source at the northern edge of the southern Schönbuch, then moves along the southern edge of the Holzgerlinger Platte, the lower course crosses the northern Schönbuch.Friedrich Huttenlocher, Hansjörg Dongus: Geographische Landesaufnahme: Die naturräumlichen Einheiten auf Blatt 170 Stuttgart. Bundesanstalt für Landeskunde, Bad Godesberg 1949, überarbeitet 1967. → Online map (PDF; 4,0 MB) At the beginning it runs approximately at the northern edge of the nature area Naturpark Schönbuch and later through its north-eastern part. = Catchment area = The Schaich drains an area of 38.1 km², which lies entirely within the Schönbuch natural area. Its highest point is the flat, 582.6 m high summit of the Bromberg south of the Hengstbrunnen, over which the southern watershed runs to the large catchment area of the Goldersbach and its tributaries, which drains over the Ammer to the Neckar. Further east, in the south, the catchment area of the Reichenbach, which flows into the Neckar at Pliezhausen, is bordered by the Reichenbach, then on this side by the continuously shorter Neckar tributaries. On the northern side, from the mouth upwards only beyond Betzenberg only short tributaries compete with the Aich which takes the Schaich, in the area of the upper course then its partly very near tributary Seitenbach which also runs about east. Finally, north of the immediate source area of the Schaich, only about one kilometre away, the Altdorfer Würm, a branch of the Würm, which drains via the Nagold and the Enz only much further down than the Aich into the Neckar.

Members of the genus are massive or thickly encrusting colonial corals, either dome- shaped or flat, and a few are foliaceous. There is a great diversity of form even among individuals of the same species. The corallites project slightly above the surface of the coral and each has its own wall. In most species, the corallites are plocoid and in some, monocentric. The septa and costae linked to the corallite wall are well developed and covered by fine teeth. The polyps only extend and feed during the night. Each one has a small number of tapering tentacles which often have a darker coloured tip; these are called stinger tentacles, or sweeper tentacles. They use these to sweep the water to see if any other coral is in its area; if so, then they begin to sting the other coral. This is commonly known as coral war. Each coral is trying to make sure it has enough room around it so they can continue to grow and have more surface area for their offspring. The columella is parietal and spongy, and there are vesicles on both the endotheca and exotheca. Members of this genus are widespread in both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indo-Pacific.Favia The Coral Hub. Retrieved 2012-02-20.Genus Favia Marine Species Identification Portal. Retrieved 2012-02-20.

HVRHVR And HVR2 stand for \\"Hornby Virtual Railway\\" versions 1 and 2. uses a 3D Planning Environment in which one can plan, build and test a layout. However, HVR, being released many years ago, has fairly low quality graphics. Hornby Track-Master also allows for the development of a shopping list for every thing needed to build a track, but it has no 3D whereas HVR does (though HVR doesn't have a shopping list feature). Users select pieces of track from lists and place them where they wish. Track- Master uses birds-eye view to work. Track, platforms, turntables etc. can be added. Once completed the software develops a printable shopping list.A list of the parts needed for the layout designed by the user, including Hornby retail prices. Hornby Track-Master (2011) Hornby releases the program Track-Master, a 2D planning environment, in 2011.
